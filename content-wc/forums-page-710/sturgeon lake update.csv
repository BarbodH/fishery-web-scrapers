555922,Guest,2006-04-03 17:28:00,0,I was wondering if camping is allowed on Sturgeon Lake? For instance in the northeast arm of the lake.
555925,guidedfishing,2006-04-03 19:58:00,531,"As long as you are on Crown Land then you can buy camping permits at just about any place that sells licenses. It costs $10. per person per day. Not that big of a deal, but does take some extra work to get camp set up especially if you have to deal with rain and wind. One other point is if you have a sportsmans license and you are camping on crown land the bag limit and possession limit is reduced to half ie. 2 eyes per day, 2 pike per day, 1 trout per day, with all length restrictions still in effect. Not that big of a deal, we have found that we really only eat 2 eyes per day per person anyway. Three years ago was the first time I stayed at a lodge for our Sep trip (after 20 plus years of camping) We still camp in June and July, there is something to be said for a hot shower, a nice toilet & a warm bunk at the end of the day. GF"
555929,Guest,2006-04-03 21:59:00,0,"Guidefishing, Thanks for your reply. Our group have been camping the last 10 years on lakes north of the town of Savant Lake and looking for some other lakes to challenge us. The Rusty Myers Road on the north end of Sturgeon Lake going back towards Vista,Beckington, and Squaw Lakes are closed to camping and was not sure if that included Sturgeon Lake. We know about the number of fish on a conservation license and don't care that its 2 per day because we are not meat hunters and do not take fish home. We just enjoy the experience of being out in the middle of nowhere with nature. Have been on fly-ins and also stayed in camps and both do not compare to being in a tent and listening to the loons while dosing off to sleep and untill we went camping we have never experienced the northern lights. September can't get here soon enough,the only question is where are we going to camp this year."
555934,Guest,2006-04-04 07:28:00,0,"INDoug, I have never camped on sturgeon but was also thinking about giving it a try. I wanted to camp by Squaw because it is a much shorter boat ride to the northeast arm from there, but like you said it is not allowed. What lakes have you fished North of Savant? We were thinking about going up that way next year in mid-June. Is the fishing any good up that way. I have fished Squaw and that is one of the best lakes I have ever fished for walleyes and northern."
556160,Guest,2006-04-11 23:40:00,0,Non resident camping is not allowed on Sturgeon Lake - same as the Vista Lake Road by Savant.
555674,Guest,2006-03-26 22:35:00,0,"Thanks for the response.I thought the north end looked pretty big on a map.When we were there in july I could motor thru by the culverts.A co-worker camped up there in september showed me pictures this spring of the landing and I could tell the water was alot lower. He also made it sound like the trail in was even worse than it was in july. I don't have donriggers for laker's so I try for pike and walleye.I've heard cobb bay is good for walleye on sturgeon but I think the northeast arm is closer to where I'm staying.I'll have to watch the weather,either place is a long run on big water.Are there any particular areas or methods you use for pike on sturgeon in late august."
555678,Guest,2006-03-27 07:14:00,0,"GT, You don't need downriggers for fishing Lakers, you can long line them using a husky jerk on a three way swivel and a one once dropper, or what ever weight you need. Some of the best Laker action is vertical jigging them. That can really be a blast. You do need decent sonar, usually you can find them most of the time on Sturgeon in 40 - 80 feet of water, and up shallow spring and fall. You would be surprised at some of large walleyes you catch when vertical jigging for lakers as well. Pike are pretty much incidental to our other fishing. We usually take a couple afternoons and pound them in Cobb bay or any of the other bays off the main lake. A buck tail spinner with a orange blade seems to really whip them up. We have good luck draging fire tiger husky jerks through the bays as well. If you can get back to the 1st bay on Cobb bay which is all the thru 3rd and 2nd bays you will do well on the eye's, Most locals that fish Sturegon head for cobb bay to pick up their eye's, any spot that has the wind blowing in will stack them up, crawler harness with a orange blade, banana baits work well, like the walley diver. When you fished Lake of bays do you use mostly live bait or artifical? GF"
555680,Guest,2006-03-27 08:12:00,0,"GF On lake of bays I used Gulp ribbentail worms on a jig head.Others in the group used powerbait or minnows.When your on fish I dont't know if it really mattered too much,but that trip I think I did better than the rest of the group.I used gulp all week,even on other lakes we fished.When wife and I went back in august gulp didn't work as well,seemed like they wanted minnows. I've heard of deep jigging for lakers.When you try it do you jig over deep holes for suspended fish or go all the way to bottom. Also,can you release them after bringing them up from that deep. Gee Tee"
555683,guidedfishing,2006-03-27 10:53:00,531,"Ok, on the gulp I used that on LOB's, with some success, but they seemed to prefer minnows in September. A one ounce jig with a big twister tail, tipped with herring, usually the lakers are doing one of two things you will see them below a school of bait fish, or they will be relating to structure near usually near deep water, ie water that quickly transitions to water deeper than they are holding in. Look around Islands or plunging shore lines where they can trap the cisco's agains a surface. Usually they are within several feet or near the bottom. Some will come all the way to the surface out of 80 feet of water before they slam the jig, reel in fast then slow down just a little they usually hit right at the change of speed from fast to slow. Or just hop it along the bottom as you drift through them. White is usually a good color. When you hook one keep the pressure on they fight so hard that usually the hook hole is so stretched out that as soon as you let off the jig just falls out. It will seem like you are reeling in a sea monster as the expell air, on the way up you can see the water boil, and actually hear them groaning as they get near the surface. I have never had a problem losing them at the surface or taking a picture and releasing, even when coming out of 80 feet of water. It is an incrediable battle when you hook one deep like that. Have you camped on LOB's at all, usually we will stay near the causeway, mostly catch and release, keeping just a couple to eat. GF"
555685,Guest,2006-03-27 14:14:00,0,No I've never camped on lake of bays.I've only been there the last two years.We stay at silver dollar and trailer in each day.Usually hit lake of Bays one or two days and then try a different lake.Also we go way up to jutten for at least one or two days.I would love to try camping on lake of bays just to avoid hauling in twice.But most of our group is older and not too keen on camping.I think right by the causeway would be a great place to camp.Last year we ended up beaching the boats and stood on the ends of the culverts and fished. Nothing huge but nice eating size and lots of action.
555691,guidedfishing,2006-03-27 18:08:00,531,"Yeah, the camping can be rough if the weather is bad, and it does take a lot out of you. We usually camp June, July trips, then stay in a cabin in Sept. Your bag / possesion limit is reduced when camping but we are not looking to fill a freezer, just catch and release and a couple for lunch. I've had sleet and snow on either end. Looking forward to the trips. We always find something new, I try to stay away from the busy spots, if possible, good luck and stay in touch email me your reports and I will update you as well. tnxs for the info. If I can help on anything let me know. GF"
555765,Guest,2006-03-30 07:37:00,0,"For those of you that fish sturgeon, how is the boat traffic at the northern part of this lake? I only see maybe three or four camps at that part of the lake? Any camps near trappers poimt?"
555771,guidedfishing,2006-03-30 10:52:00,531,"Even during the peak fishing times in June, the boat traffic on the main lake is minimal even in comparison to other drive to lakes in the are. On the other hand, walleye spots like Cobb Bay can concentrate boats in a hurry. Because of the size of sturgeon 55 miles long tip to tip I generally spend most of my time on the south end, so I am not much help in the northern arms. GF"

555569,blue boy,2006-03-24 15:25:00,4,"I've seen many posts talking about good eye lakes in the area of Sturgeon Lake. Names I have from the outfitter are, Lake of Bays, Pnassi, Wintering,and Hut. Has anyone ever fished them? Any info will be appreciated. The group will be staying at Lumberjack Lodge on the south end of Sturgeon."

555648,guidedfishing,2006-03-25 18:28:00,531,"I've fished Sturgeon for eye's and lake trout, and lake of the bays for walleyes. Cobb Bay is where you want to fish eye's on Sturgeon, it is a lot of lake and gets rough, Cobb Bay is made up of 3rd, 2nd and 1st bays, get back in as far as possible. Lake of the bays is pike and eye's, If you have a boat of any size you will / can really mess it up trying to get in on the goat trail, It is a 4 wheel drive for the last mile which will take you up to a hour for that last mile. Paper company owns most of the property around this lake, which requires a permit from them if you fish to camp or put in on their property. I have not fished the other mentioned but I have fished Press, Arethusa, Flatrock all in the same area. GF"
555656,Guest,2006-03-26 09:26:00,0,Thanks for the information. The outfitter says he has boats on the before mentioned lakes. Would we still need to get the permits you mentioned or is it only if you bring your own boat? really appreciate the help. First trip to Canada in a very long time.
555659,Guest,2006-03-26 11:18:00,0,"blueboy, Lake of Bays is the only one that I'm aware of surronded by paper company land. I'm curious which guide / outfitter you are talking about, (do you know his name) I'm not aware of anyone leaving boats on Lake of the Bays, maybe on the others you have mentioned. If you are going to lake of the bays and put in on non-paper company land you will not need a permit as long as you do not spend the night camping. The Lake trout fishing on Sturgeon is usually pretty good. How big are your boats that you are taking up? I've not fished penassi, but have heard it and wintering can give up a lot of nice eye's. I currently have three trips planned for the silver dollar area this summer & fall. Let me know when you will be going, I'll try and help you out with any info that I can, any specific questions let me know. or email me. GF"
555661,Guest,2006-03-26 12:06:00,0,Lake of Bays is exellent fishing.I'm not aware of a need for a permit to launch a boat at the landing our group has used.Is there more than one place to put in.I know a guy I work with camped on Lake of Bays last fall.He said they stopped at silver dollar and bought a camping permit.Your lodge should be able to put you on good lakes.I've stayed at silver dollar the last couple of years and Marty is a good source of info.I have to agree the way in to Lake of Bays is not great but the fishing makes up for it.I'm going up twice this summer.Once mid july at silver dollar and again the end of august to Bergmanns on the north end of sturgeon.Last year didn't do well on sturgeon but did well on harris and jutten for walleye.I'd be interested in hearing of other lakes on the north end of sturgeon for walleye.I also think this year I'll try a long run to the northeast arm to fish.
555662,Catman59,2006-03-26 13:36:00,345,Northeast arm is good..We fish Sturgeon every year....There are some neat smaller lakes around that if your outfitter has a cache on-- are outstanding. Went to one north and east of Savant Lake about 25 miles last year. walk in and use a boat that the outfitter had. Non stop and had the best fishing in my life ! Dont count out Northern Lights and other areas of Sturgeon it self. Just find a stained bay....and you will find fish. BTW the Northern Fishing is awesome anywhere on the lake.
555663,guidedfishing,2006-03-26 13:46:00,531,"You don't need a permit from the paper company if you use the landing on the south end, That is queens land. There is only a small portion of the southern tip of lake of bays that is not queens land. You only need a permit from the paper company if you park or camp on their land. I agree Lake of Bays has some good fishing. I'll be up there three times this year. Many of the neighboring lakes are just as good as well. How do you do for Lakers on lake of the bays? GF"
555670,Guest,2006-03-26 21:38:00,0,I didn't know lake of bays had lakers in it.Deepest water I can remember marking was about fifty feet.Is it deeper on the north end. The farthest up the lake I've been is just past the culverts.The goal this year is to go to north end just to say I've been there.
555672,Guest,2006-03-26 21:59:00,0,"GeeTee, I will be up 3 times this summer, lake of bays, Arethusa, Flatrock, and Sturgeon lake in September. There was not enough water to get my boat through at the causeway on Lake of Bays last summer late. Lake trout in the North end, it is big and can get nasty up there about 7 miles across, don't go if it is windy. It is deceiving when you are on the south end where it is so narrow. A little breeze on the South can be a major event on the north end. Cobb Bay on Sturgeon lake is a reliable place to catch walleyes, I like to chase lake trout. Flat rock on the North end has some dandy lakers but they can be hard to get on. We usually camp on all of these lakes. I tore my gear up pretty good coming out of lake of bays last year, there were several spots late last fall that had 2 foot vertical drops in the road, and several wash outs that I actually had to drag the trailer by the frame through, Marty at Silver dollar said they were going to try and fix the road up, but he gave the impression that it would probably not happen. Sturgeon in my opinion does not get much pressure, except for cobb bay."
