What I have recently heard, is that this lodge is being looked at by some LOTW fishing guides. This is a unique situation, where the guides that work there will also be running it. It's not for sure yet, but I expect that the resort will be one of the best on the lake pretty soon. Anybody else hear anything?"

They had a wonderful memorial service in Nestor Falls where both the Lindner brothers participated. The church was filled beyong capacity, seats in the basement were filled and they had speakers set up outside for the overflow. He was a remarkable man who accomplished remarkable things and had the rare gift of vision. He was always looking forward, even in his final hours. Quite a guy. I am glad to see that his wife is nearing completion of a sale; especially to those who helped him in his last years."

556156,River_eye,2006-04-11 20:08:00,1486,"Well, it's for sure now, some successful guides have taken over Meline's They will not be changing the name, as Al Meline was a very respected man and his name deserves to live on. Bookings are coming in quick, as past Meline guests are very loyal and a number of guests from the guide's former lodges are following them to Meline's. I think a lot of people in the community are very happy that this prestigeous lodge will live on. Way to go boys! Good luck in your inaugural season!:cheers:"
