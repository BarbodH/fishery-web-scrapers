556243,Guest,2006-04-16 11:11:00,0,I was working off the end of my dock yesterday and there was one foot of ice. It's all honeyconed and this morning where I had a hole two feet square yesterday it is now four feet square. It is forcasted to be 19 degrees centigrade today and 17 tomorrow. Opening week of May will not be an issue this year.
