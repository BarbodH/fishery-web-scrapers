I was thinking about buying this chip just to keep me off the rock piles on the NW side of the lake. Do you think it would do that, will be my first time up there. regards, jason"
556049,Brax,2006-04-10 07:50:00,52,"Dogfish, I received some screen shots from Navionics and have posted them in the picture area. They are of the NW corner of Lac Seul. I assume you have a GPS on your boat, I would say this is a MUST when fishing a body of water like Lac Seul. If you take your time around the lake and use the map your resort gives you you should be fine uo there. They will mark the travel routes you should take and this helps. I have been to that end of the lake 3 times and have yet to dent a prop. I usually travel to Mckinsey Bay for most of my fishing so I have covered a lot of water."

555928,Guest,2006-04-03 21:38:00,0,">Hey MTP, > >How does the NW side of Lac Seul look on the card? > >Thanks >Jesse Jesse, I contacted the sales department at Navionics about the NW side of Lac Seul. They sent me some screen shots of what they had and it is not worth it. They will be finishing the survey this summer but right now it's only good for showing you where you are. There are almost no depths in the lake. I asked if there would be some kind of deal if you bought the chip now and upgraded next year, but the only thing is the $50 trade in value. I'll wait until next year before buying the chip."
555945,Guest,2006-04-04 14:28:00,0,Does this chip have the abram/minnitaki lakes? Thanks
555948,scar,2006-04-04 17:02:00,196,no it does not. kind of a surprise since both together are very large lakes and fished by many. scar

556033,Guest,2006-04-09 11:11:00,0,"I took a look at the northwest section and it appears to be fairly detailed. I have never fished that area before, so I can't say that the detail shown is accurate. The Mckineze Bay area had a ton of islands and a bunch of rock piles marked. I recommend that you email Navionics and request them to send you a few screenshots of the area so that you can get a better idea. In my opinion the only down side is the depth contours are not very detailed. The contours are shown in 10' or 20'increments, so if you plan on using this card to find a certain water depth to troll along, I would not recommend it. The reason I purchased it was more for navigation, because all the islands and rock piles seemed to be marked (at least in the northeast section) Hope this helps."
