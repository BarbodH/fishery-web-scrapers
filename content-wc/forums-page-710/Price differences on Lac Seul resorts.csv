Examples are: Lac Seul Outposts,($700.00 per person for a 7 day trip, using your own boat), Gold Pines costs 500.00 for 2 people(250.00 ea) using your boat, Fisherman's Cove costs $530.00 per person and includes 30 gallons of gas+ 14 doz. minnows, Evergreen Lodge costs $500.00 per person and includes 4 doz. minnows per day. What is different/special for these different resorts? Are the more expensive resorts closer to better fishing spots? Are the cabins in better shape? Any insight is appreciated!!"

I believe it is $549.00 per person with 2 dozen minnows a day. Unless something changes, it is a bargain."

556044,Guest,2006-04-09 20:32:00,0,"Just like anything else, the price varies according to the quality of services and facilities available. In the lodge business, there is a wide range of possibilities for packaging together a vacation. Obviously, the costs associated with providing a given level of service offers only a general starting point for prices, and then individual owners/operators can vary the price up or down from there, based on the overall market and the amount of profit desired. Here are some general fishing vacation variables that help determine prices set by lodges. 1. Access (with Lac Seul being almost all drive-in lodges there isn't a lot of variation there, but some; and some lodges are boat-in which should cost a bit more) 2. The quality of the accommodations (cleanliness, power, comfort, size, amenities provided, etc.) 3. Provision of meals. Is it housekeeping? Or do they serve you breakfast and dinner? (Also some places offer 'dinner only' options, and you take care of breakfast and lunch yourself). 4. Quality of boats and motors provided, quality of electronics, boat/fishing accessories. You can also throw provision of bait in here as well. 5. Guide service. (A major one!) 6. Quality of fishing, which is more often a factor between fisheries rather than within a given fishery, but because Lac Seul is so big, there is certainly variation. There is little things as well, but essentially those are the things which usually have the largest impact on price. NOW, if you're talking about ""Price Variation"", or price increase, it can sometimes be the result of major reinvestment in new cabins, or newer/better boats for example, but right now, price increases are the result of increased fuel costs, and for all lodges which take payment in American funds (and most on Lac Seul do), the dropping currency value of the US dollar (because revenue is US$ and costs are Canadian $). But that's essentially the factors. If you go to Silver Water Wheel for example, you'll pay more like $1200 for the week, but that is for full guide service everyday including fully-prepared shore lunch, great breakfasts and dinners served to you in the lodge, clean, comfortable cabins, fishing out of 1800 Tournament Series Pro-V boats, with Lowrance electronics, and everything in the boat you would ever need, all the bait you'll ever need, and is situated in the most productive part of Lac Seul (far from both Ear Falls and Sioux Lookout), known as 'Zone 2' in Lac Seul management terms. Hope this gives you some insight, NWO Fishing Bum"

556051,Guest,2006-04-10 09:14:00,0,"Go to the website for Silver Water Wheel and look at their fishing reports for last year. It will give you a rundown on where the fish are at for that time of year. I have tried but have not been able to get into SWW for a trip. It is a fully guided trip and top notch and always fully booked. The owner and guides there post here all the time. At Goose Bay, you will be a good 35 miles away from where they fish at SWW but you will get an idea about what is going on that time of year on Lac Seul."
556168,Guest,2006-04-12 11:11:00,0,"Blackjack, going up to Gold Pines in middle of August for first time. Will need to use their boats. What are there best boats? Also looking to get a guide for first day. Any suggestions. Also any suggestions on places to fish or best baits at this time. I know I am asking a lot but I am taking my 79 yr old Dad on what could be his last canadian trip and I want this to be something he will really like. He can't stop talking about it now. So any help would be greatly appricated."
556169,Guest,2006-04-12 12:43:00,0,"I have looked on Gold Pines website and there is not a lot of information on it. Is it near Evergreen, or is it out in the area of Goose Bay? Also, what is the price. You talk about Evergreen being more expensive because of their boats. I would have to say that they have the nicest rental boats, but do not think they are that expensive. $599 for two per boat or $549 per person for three per boat. That seems pretty reasonable. I know that Fishermans cove is about the same price and their boats are nowhere near as nice. Lac Seul Lodge and Scout Lake are considerably more."

Where can you find a good map showing hazards & such so that this trip is memorable for the good fishing not ruining a boat/motor? I've also considered a guide but the resort people(Gold Pines) have told me not to worry, they should be able to tell us where the fish have been hitting. I'm also getting anxious and it's only April!! Have a safe & enjoyable trip !!"
556185,2 DOGS,2006-04-12 21:56:00,361,"I don't see a boat & motor listed as coming with the cabin, if there's a separate charge for that, then the prices are considerably closer. I know Golden Eagle and Evergreen include a standard boat & motor with the cabin. You might already know, if not inquire so no surprises."

556056,Guest,2006-04-10 11:44:00,0,"my group and i like evergreen. it costs about $600 per week with 2/boat. boats are great. misty river, i think. 50 hp electric start. better at breaking through and shedding big water than any of the lunds i've rented up there. we spend another $75 per guy for food and we eat like kings every meal. i cannot imagine anyone getting better accomodations. the cabins are nearly perfect in every way. we don't use guides, don't need them. silver water wheel is $1800 per week for 2/boat. that includes meals and guides. i'm sure the fishing is good down there, but not so sure it's $1000 per week better. another thing we like about evergreen is that you are 5 minutes from ear falls and all that it has to offer. good equipment, good accomodations, good owners and close to town. hard to beat. gary is a true catch and release guy and promotes not fishing in water deeper than 22 feet. saves a lot of fish that guys release and think are fine that just die later."

Anything special I >should bring along besides my boat of course. > >thanks for any input Wi-Dogfish, I stayed at Goose Bay lodge 2 years ago. Nice camp for the money, clean and well run. You don't need to run all the way down to the area Silver Wheel is located to find fish. The farthest I ran from Goose Bay was Mckinzie bay, which is about 15 or so miles. But you don't even need to run that far. The fish sanctuary is a good spot once it opens to fishing. If you are going in the spring you will find good fishing up at that end of the lake. In summer the walleyes tend to be more concentrated in the main lake basins, Mckinzie is then an excellent choice. I like to use spinner rigs with bottom bounces tipped with worms to find the fish, then work them with jigs and cranks. Another nice thing about being in that area is it is a short drive to Ear Falls. You can run in for tackle, bait or dinner."

556066,Guest,2006-04-10 20:18:00,0,"Lac Seul Outposts (Obijiway Outfitters) is a little more than the others because you have to boat in 40 miles to camp. It is expensive to guide people into camp on a daily basis (80 miles round trip), that is a lot gas considering boat motors are not that fuel efficient. Not to mention they have to boat in all there supplies and gas. In my opinion it is worth the extra money because you are fishing in a much more secluded area. Other than the fishermen in camp and a couple of houseboats here and there, no one else fishes that section of the lake. I have never fished at Silver Wheel before, but that is priced at $1500 because it is american plan and you have a full time guide. From everything i have heard, fishing any where on Lac Seul is great. You just have to decide which lodge best suits you."

If you're renting a boat,Evergreen has the nicest boats but that's why they cost more.Gold Pines, Evergreen, Goose Bay, Golden Fawn,Timberlane are all in the same end of the lake and relatively close to the town of Ear Falls.I've stayed at Evergreen,Goose Bay & Gold Pines and I prefer Gold Pines."
