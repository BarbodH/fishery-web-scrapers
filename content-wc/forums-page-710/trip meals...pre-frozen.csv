555363,NateW,2006-03-13 14:11:00,96,"Like several folks here we also freeze some stuff ahead. Spagetti sauce, chili, a hash brown casserole...but what we have leaned more towards lately is using a crock pot. We throw some meat & potatoes into crock in the morning, we'll have sandwiches or shorelunch during the day, then come back to the cabin later and all we have to do is set the table and start eating pot roast or a pork loin or beef stew or something like that. There have been times we've returned to find guys from other cabins sitting on our steps wanting to know what's for supper! We have a couple guys in our group that don't like fish enough to eat it more than a couple times during the week. When we do freeze items we use the Foodsaver. If you don't have a Foodsaver, get one. They work great for freezing meals and are the best thing yet for freezing the filets you want to take home."
555396,jigman 2003,2006-03-15 10:03:00,981,Whoa! Looked good until I checked the prices. I'd have to get a part time job to afford that food bill.
556063,Guest,2006-04-10 18:02:00,0,"A couple frozen meals really saves some time during the week. We have had great luck with frozen hot dishes, like Tator Tot hot dish, etc. Even if you are cooking a lot of fish, it is nice to have extra side dishes that require no time or effort. Chili, etc. are all good. Soups, like a wild rice soup are tough to beat, and also go well with fish . . . at camp or with shore lunch. You can also take soup in a Thermos for the boat. Freeze items in an old ice cream pail and you are good to go. It also keeps things cold on the trip up there. Have fun!"

556147,Guest,2006-04-11 15:46:00,0,"Ahhh Food! Mista Walleye pre camp must haves. I use to be a commercial cook in my early years. I love to cook, I professionally cooked for 7 years before I moved up to the great white North... My Favs pre Frozen before I head out on walleye expeditions... MMMM Hot Wings.. I freeze them two ways...I Marinade with hotsauce, lemon juice,chopped garlic, Italian dressing, bbq sauce and whatever I can find in the cupboard. Put in a Freezer bag and Freeze in juices. Great if you have a grill or one of those hand grills to cook on open fire. Or same Marinade roll them in Parmesan or bread crumbs then bbq. Cooked and ready to eat. I freeze them and they last for at least 3 days in cooler. Roladen: Thinly sliced meat. You can add other types of meat, sausage, eggs,etc Roll with spices then bake. Once done freeze , they are great when your in the boat. Quick meal, you can eat them cold or bbq then slap them on a bun... Mmmm. For breaky I make a batch of crepe batter. Put it in a plastic 2 litre bottle and ready for quick meals..Don't forget the corn suryp. I also like a good marinaded steak, sirloin, spiced up with lots of juices. Freeze it, same as wings bring hand grill and cook over fire.. Love cooking those in the late hours as a snack with cold brewskies after a hard day of walleye fishing... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Mista Walleye"
555210,VMS,2006-03-06 09:43:00,1103,"I don't know about the rest of you, but we only make 2 meals each day...a decent breakfast, and a decent dinner. Dinner is usually potatoes with a canned veggie with fried fish and salad. We have one night where we grill steaks but it is still with potatoes and canned veggie. The potatoes are boiled after breakfast for the evening meal to help get them started. Everyone has their job at camp, so things move pretty quickly. We bring bars and Pies from home for dessert and candy bars for boat snacks. We have the pies and bars in the evening after getting the boats tied off and fish cleaned. Sandwich stuff is laid out as well for those who want it. Oh...and cannot forget the truck cookies for the trip up and back... Steve"
555212,czy42strokes,2006-03-06 10:04:00,419,"lasagna, chicken & wild rice soup. pressed hamburger patties, chicken breasts, some personal pan pizzas and a large box of shore lunch."
555217,Frankm,2006-03-06 12:50:00,154,"We bring frozen Chili and Soup, burgers, steaks, french fries. We also do 2 meals a day. We try and do something different each day for breakfast. Eggs, pancakes, biscuits and gravy (Bob Evans pre made and pilsbury biscuits), french toast. For dinner we do different types of fish early in the week then we switch to burgers, etc. For lunch we have chili or soup and then we eat snacks. Jerky, cheese and crackers, beef sticks, etc. We used to plan our lunches out but we always filled up on snacks and didn't eat our lunch items. Good topic got me thinking of plans for the up coming trip in May."

Where were you fishing?
555223,Guest,2006-03-06 14:51:00,0,My question is why aren't you eating fish!?!? We eat fish everynight except the last night so we can take our limit home. Boat food consists of just sandwiches and snacks. Breakfast is easy with cereal and sometime bacon and eggs. We have a steak night once and fish the rest of the week. You can eat lasagna and all that other good stuff at home! Nothing beats fresh walleye!
555239,Guest,2006-03-07 12:07:00,0,"We usually have fish with lunch. The guys pay to come a long way (I have one from TN and one from NC), so they like to have the nice big dinners, along with some blue! I was looking for different stuff to do ahead to avoid any lenghty food prep. Like many of you, we have a steak night. Last year we marinated boneless chicken in zip backs, and grilled that; Spaghetti, etc. I was making baked enchiladas the other day, and that got me thinking about whether I could do ahead, and freeze..... Now, I'm getting excited! Thanks guys. John"
555286,Walleyefisher,2006-03-08 23:54:00,159,I like to concentrate on fishing and relaxing when I go which for me means no cooking. So I go the easy route and buy from here;http://www.familychef.com/ Darn good food and EASY. Good Luck and Good Fishing
555288,Pooch,2006-03-09 08:26:00,4619,You are right in that nothing beats fresh walleye (up to a point). After a steady diet of walleye for several days I'm looking for a good juicy cheeseburger! I'd rather catch them than eat them. Pooch
555289,Guest,2006-03-09 09:09:00,0,"I like to limit the amount of frozen items. It makes for a lot less weight. I do freeze some meat and cheese and that keeps the milk cold until we get to camp. I never have to use ice. I like to cook so I make most things from scratch. I usually just need a pound of meat to make a meal. Like spaghetti, Chili, or Tacos. However, there are several good non frozen alternatives. For example you can use Welch's juice concentrate non frozen instead of frozen or fresh orange juice. Pancake ""just add water mix"" instead of French toast and eggs, will reduce milk and egg needs. There are several types of non frozen ""Meal Helper"" items available from Betty Crocker. Everything you need comes in a box. There are even simple non frozen spaghetti items available. Just add water and microwave. These items are very light weight and require no refrigeration. I keep track every year how many people are on the trip and how much food was needed. That way I don't end up short or way over on items and volume needed. I also have light weight ""just in case"" items for a quick snack and so I don't run short. For example, boxed or microwaveable macaroni and cheese, Peanut butter, just add water muffins and an extra spaghetti and canned sauce."
555340,Guest,2006-03-12 09:40:00,0,"Hey Rod that is the way we do it also. If a person stops and thinks meals are easy. So you might eat more noodles for a week than you would if you were at home. If We need milk to cook with we take some dried milk. If we want some milk to drink you can buy Parmalat Milk (spelled wrong)? or another brand of box milk, you don't have to cool it until you open it and it will be good for 6 mos. on the self. Mustard, hot sauce,mayo,all in the small packs along with the other keeps you from having big bottles you need to put in the frig. I can't think of any food we take in to camp that needs to be in the frig. other than some eggs and you can buy them already mixed up in a milk carton ready for scrambled eggs. You can even buy hamburger ground up in a pack now that is precooked. This kind of planning keeps the work down for us during meals and we eat darn (insert ""M"" for ""R"") good. Good Luck!"
555167,Guest,2006-03-04 22:41:00,0,"I know at one time there was a post about what type of food you have at camp for your main meals. Many of those were the same as what we do. My question is, do any of you do the meals ahead and freeze them. If so, what? My group is 6 this year, and I want to see about maybe doing something new.... Thanks. John"
555169,Pooch,2006-03-04 23:05:00,4619,"We premake and freeze home made BBQ, meat for spagetti, soup and anything that will cut down on preparation time and save dragging ""one time use"" ingrediants. Or as my wife says ""anything you guys can screw up"". We also take a couple frozen pizzas for a quick evening meal. If there is room in the cooler we grab ice cream too! Keep your eyes open when getting groceries and look at what you normally prepare at home. A lot of it can be frozen and taken with you. Wife made stew for supper tonight. I don't see any reason why we couldn't freeze it and take it with us. Weight on a fly in is a consideration for a lot of frozen foods. Pooch"
555181,Guest,2006-03-05 10:19:00,0,"We make the following things to take with us: White Chili, Pulled Pork, Jambalaya, Stew, Split Pea Soup, Ribs,Pancakes, Sausage, Bacon. We Hickory smoke the ribs and pulled pork. All rest of it we cook and then vaccum seal it. This makes it easier to transport and when you want to eat all you have to do is heat it up. It tastes just as good as when it is fresh. The liquid meals we freeze first then vaccum seal. Shoe89"
555185,MN_Moose,2006-03-05 11:15:00,965,We bring up frozen egg bakes for breakfast.
555188,Mr Ranger,2006-03-05 13:13:00,272,We do it as well. The past few years we do three dinners that are not fish to mix it up. One of the favorites is pork tenderloin in gravy and carrots. Make it down here and then freeze it in a seal meal bag. Buy some potatoes in Thunder Bay and after a long day fishing just boil the bag in water and have at it. It is also nice doing it this way as freezer space is always at a premium. Keeps life simple and no mess. Just a few more months :) Have a good one!
555193,scar,2006-03-05 13:59:00,196,last year went up with a group of 20.(14 adults and 6 kids) we did shore lunch every day at 1pm and and then had one of the adults go in each night around 7pm to fix dinner. all boats came back to the cabin around 9pm and we usually ate around 9:30 -10pm. cooking was real easy as we prepared all of our meals at home and transfered them to ice cream buckets with lids and froze them solid prior to leaving for canada. 1. spaghetti sauce with meat(italian sausage and hamburger) and frozen garlic bread 2. beef(round or sirloin) stroganoff over noodles (only prep was boiling noodles) 3. pans of lasagna(frozen in large tin throw away pans) and frozen garlic bread 4.hot shredded beef in gravy served on buns with leftovers 5. frozen hand pattied ground round burgers and brats cooked on the grill 6. steak night this method really is easy and we would serve frozen or canned veggies with each meal. what really made the meals good however was large quanities of labbatts blue and canadian whiskey served before during and after dinner. best part was the 6 boys we had along were responsible for all of the clean up. here is a post for pictures from last years trip.copy it and paste it in to your address bar.http://www.snapfish.com/thumbnailsha...13/t_=40317113 scar
555195,Guest,2006-03-05 14:12:00,0,"We freeze many of the dinners that have already been mentioned. However, A couple of years ago we added chineese (fried rice, chicken/pork/shrimp, oriental veggies, egg rolls). Frozen in different bags, most can be boiled right in the bag, and the eggrolls worked great in the oven. It's now one of the most popular meals on the menu, and any left-overs are eaten for breakfast, cold in the boat the next day for lunch, or as a mid-night snack after downing a few Blue. Don't forget the soy and sweat/sour sauce. Chuck"
555197,JimH,2006-03-05 15:26:00,320,"Pretty much beef stew, chili, and spaghetti. One of us filets the fish, the other heats of the food. Saves a little more time to get back out there."
555204,Guest,2006-03-05 20:59:00,0,"We eat fish every night! Maybe baked on the gril one night in foil, fried in the pan the next. And a lot of dried food where we just add water and boil. Noodles and dried soup mixes work well. Or with Garlic and butter. We also have mashed potatoes that takes boiling water and is ready in 4mins. Some of the packs of mashed spuds are loaded bakes some with cheese. Packs of gravy mix that only use water. Taco shells for fish tacos. We use this system and never go over on weight. All meals are fast and easy. Leaves room and weight for cans of drink. We also buy the Armor brand of bacon percooked from Sam's club that equals 3# of bacon, no need to put in the frig until you open it. Also one trick for bread is a 3 2 1 bread. 3cups flour 2 tea spoon of sugar and 1 can of beer. Mix up and Let it set for 5 mins it will rise a little and bake. 2 cups of sugar in place of 2 tea spoon and you have cake Good luck Elmo"
555208,Guest,2006-03-06 05:00:00,0,"In chicago a lot of the small deli type shops have ""ready to eat"" foods that are pre cooked-roast pork, fresh and smoked polish sausage,dumplings, roast beef,home made soup by the gallon.(I just found why I'm over weight)we just make a menu and freeze the meals in containers, in the morning we take them out to thaw, the two cooks for that day come in 30 minutes earlier and just nuke the food.We all gain a few pounds by the time we get back home -we tell our wives that we rough it-- if they only knew!!!
