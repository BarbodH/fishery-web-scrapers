556246,Guest,2006-04-16 17:02:00,0,What is the effect of early ice and walleye fishing. Due they spawn earlier due to the water warming earlier?
556251,Guest,2006-04-16 22:32:00,0,"my experience with early ice out usually means earlier spawn and less big fish on the opener, Our overall numbers were great but not as many big pigs you hope for..."
556256,515,2006-04-17 09:05:00,254,I've always found with the early thaw that you have to look deeper for the fish as they move away from the creek and rivers alot earlier. My crew gave up on the spring trips in favor of the mid summers as the fish will be establish on a pattern and place by the time we get there. Also the lack of bugs and the warmer water make for more fun then.

Better fishing without going into the sanctuaries... I'll be dropping my boat in on Sunday... Maybe do a little ice breaking..And checking out those humps.... Mista Walleye
