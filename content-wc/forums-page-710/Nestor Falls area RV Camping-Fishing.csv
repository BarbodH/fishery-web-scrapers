556068,Guest,2006-04-10 21:41:00,0,How do you like Youngs camp? What time of year do you go there? I have considered that camp in the past because the owners seemed friendly but I was concerned about their location for fishing in the late summer. Any info you could provide would be appreciated.

556137,Guest,2006-04-10 22:32:00,0,"Have been going to Young's for the past 12 years. We have almost always gone at the end of May thru the first week of June. Great camp, best food ever, super staff and the owners (Perry & Carol) work their tails off to see that their guest have an enjoyable stay. The fishing around there has almost always been top-notch or better and I've never ""had"" to stray too far from their island to find and catch fish. I target about anything that will stretch my line (kinda hard to do as most of my lines are super/braided lines) and put a bend in the rod! We are scheduled to be there once again this year at the same time and preparations are already in order. Ya can't go wrong there in my book, and the mid or late summer fishing is excellent almost every year as well. Give'em a call and book a trip, I really don't think you'll regret it at all! Good luck, tight lines!! Hawker"
556081,Hawker,2006-04-08 09:39:00,3967,"I have some friends that want to make their first excurssion to LOTW this year with their RV and boat. They have asked me if I know of any ""nice"" RV camp sites near Nestor Falls. Not being one that is much into camping myself, I've not paid much attention through the years that I make my fishing jaunts to Young's Wilderness Camp, for camping locations etc. Would/could some of you that know the area well make some reccomendations that I can pass on to them?? Certainly appreciate any info such as names of campgrounds, locations and any contact info for them. Thanks in advance! Hawker"

My friends plan on spending 2-3 weeks in the area and will trailer to several of the lakes to fish that they are able to do so while there. Any and all campground/RV places around the Nestor Falls are would be appreciated. Thanks for the other names/links you already provided as well. Hawker"
