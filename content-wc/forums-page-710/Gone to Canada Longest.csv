555869,ONE TIME DAVE,2006-03-31 16:22:00,110,I have gone at least once every year but 2 since 1966 with numerous trips some years. Before 1966 4 times.
555873,Renn,2006-03-31 19:13:00,87,"I first went when I was 6. All I can remember about that trip was staring at the ceiling of my gandpa's Ford Fairlane(?) the entire night!!! Took a couple of years off and started going back when I was 9. 29 years later I have only missed one year.....for my brother's wedding which only lasted 6 months....should have went fishing!!! :-) Numerous multi trip years, including this year. I think my dad started going in 1959, or earlier, and hasn't missed too many years since. The last 9 years (my son is 9) there have been three generations of our family making the annual trip to Canada. This trip has become sort of a family reunion. It's interesting how rocks, water, pine trees and slimy fish can help you appreciate the time you have with your entire family. Renn"
555882,rpieske,2006-04-01 10:05:00,1276,"Renn: My dad, son and I would go up together, too. Now my son just had his own son this week. There have been three generations of Pieske's and Rusin's who have met in Nestor Falls and fished together since 1955. My son and our friend's son started fishing together at 10. They have stayed friends over the past 20 years, each got engaged the same week on LOTW, now have sons just a month apart. They look forward to the 4th generation being able to fish together just as they have. How neat is that! This whole LOTW experience is hard to define...but you know it when you feel it. It's been drawing me back for 53 years."

It's been a father/son fishing trip every year, except for the last 2, when 2 of my sisters came along with us. This year it is just him and I again...June 19th thru July 3rd. We are very greatful to have made so many unforgetable memories and everlasting friendships over the years. I am also very thankful to be able to share this all with my hero, my best friend, my Dad. Thankyou Canada..."

I always looked forward to meeting old friends, arguing sports with Mike and catching fish and having a few cocktails. After a year under new ownership we went to Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul and have started another list of fine memories. I always look forward to the trip.

A good friend talked me into a trip in the mid 80s, and I have gone up about every year since. Some of the trips with the guys, and for a number of years for family vacations (some years along with my friend's family). This week the oldest daughter of my friend that talked me into going north, called me from our Home Office on a business question, and we got talking about our Canadian family vacations over the years. She was a little older than our kids, and from time to time would baby-sit them. Now she is married and has a child of her own; and was telling her husband about how she wanted to go up north for some vacations - her husband (not a fisherman - sad, but true) looked at the camp's website where we vacationed and said ""I don't see anything special about this place"".....his wife laughed and said ""you're right...there is nothing special about it, other than great memories with my family and some good friends....that I want to pass along to our kids"".
