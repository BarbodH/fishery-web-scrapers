556143,Guest,2006-04-11 09:11:00,0,There is an interesting article on MSN.com today about the price of gas and why it's going up. something about supply and demand. An interesting concept.
556144,hawk82,2006-04-11 09:45:00,126,Just received an email from our outfitter who said that they may have to charge a gas surcharge for our group coming up in May. Wonder what that means on a fly-in trip.
556085,Guest,2006-04-08 11:27:00,0,"Can any one explain how ""W"" is responsible for the price of gas in Canada, too?"
556088,grt1,2006-04-08 12:58:00,259,Most of the gas companies are American owned.

556093,Guest,2006-04-08 20:13:00,0,Well that pretty much explains it.

556050,Guest,2006-04-10 08:14:00,0,We have heard that gas will go up to $?.?? this summer and if they keep telling us it will be $5.00 a gallon next summer and keep beating in our heads. Next year when it is $5.00 a gallon we will be hardened to the fact that the gas was going up and love and live with it. With Exxon making 40+ billion dollars and them seing how easy it is to boost the price of gas they might make $80 billion this year. Canada should be able to get that cheap North Sea gas from the sister land in GB (Scotland) Or I think they ship to England frist. I will still go fishing with the gas high but not as much.

556139,Guest,2006-04-11 01:03:00,0,"I'm with you Mark. How is ""W"" responsible for the price of Gas? Seems to me the price of gas hit all time highs with Carter, Reagan, Bush 1, and Clinton. The last time a President stepped in and artificially controlled prices it sent the US into the worst economic times since the 30's. Anyone remember the misery index from the Carter years?"
555761,wooglin,2006-03-29 21:49:00,371,"Ah, the ole gas question, seems to come up this time every year. For my group, it costs about $50 per person round trip. If gas were to double to $4 per gallon (from last years prices), and cost me a mere $100 - I'd still go and not complain. What's another $50 for a priceless trip with the boys....errrr...men? lol"
555763,Catman59,2006-03-30 06:28:00,345,You guys who to get split your costs are very lucky.......Mine is a family trip all of my expenses are split by 1 ! We just threw in another couple hundred into the pot and am going to try salted minnows this year. Minnow savings could be the biggest return as I go through LOTS of minnows @ $5 dozen !
555766,wooglin,2006-03-30 08:30:00,371,"I see you're point! Just a suggestion, save your cash on minnows and buy a flat of crawlers - 500 of them for $45. Fish bite them just as much as minnows - we used crawlers for 3 straight years and had no problems at all."
555797,Guest,2006-03-31 01:37:00,0,wooglin is right on....crawlers work excellent for us. Jig and a crawler will catch lots of eyes.

555878,Catman59,2006-04-01 05:34:00,345,"Thanks .I have decided to try them again too. We didnt have good luck with them 3 or 4 years ago , but that was a very tough year of fishing and nothing was really the answer as about 15 weather patterns went through in 5 days ! Of course by Friday the weather straightened out and the fishing was non stop !!!!! But thats fishing you know."
555954,grt1,2006-04-05 09:28:00,259,"I got gas yesterday, apr 4, in Red Lake, it was $1.17 a litre. Over $100 for 3/4 tank of gas, what a bummer!!!!"
555973,Guest,2006-04-05 23:44:00,0,$1.05 in Saskatoon
555992,Guest,2006-04-06 18:40:00,0,"Yes, you have to remember that your disposal income is down because you have to pay alot extra for gas THE ENTIRE YEAR, not just one trip. That is what is killing me. I'll sneak in one trip to southern Ontario for bass this year when I combine it with another vacation, but as of now can't make the walleye run. I usually end up paying for 4 people and expenses my self which is why it is a big deal. Not enough rich fishing friends and you need about 4 people to go most fly-in places that I like."

555714,Guest,2006-03-28 14:46:00,0,"Just wondering what you all think the cost of gas will be per gallon by the Memorial day weekend? I suspect that $3.25 will be a reality in the states, this will add an aweful amount to this years trip. Probably my last unless the gas prices ease. I'm not rich so will have to fish closer to Iowa."
555717,Guest,2006-03-28 15:45:00,0,"My group drives a motorhome that get 8mpg (when we're easy on it), and travel 2300 miles round trip. The motorhome carries all 8 of us and we divide the expense equally. With your gas price estimate, our trip would go up approximately $35/guy. That's about the price of a case of beer (Canadian). I don't think that will influence me not to go, but I'm lucky enough to have access to an inexpensive motorhome as well."
555739,wildduck223,2006-03-29 12:35:00,38,"Stehle,iF MY MATH IS GOOD, 2300 MILES by 8 miles per gallon is 287.50 gallon of fuel, time $3.00 per gallons is $862.50 divided by 8 people is $107.81 per person cost of fuel only, not $35."
555740,jigman 2003,2006-03-29 12:38:00,981,"No, he said it would go UP $35 per guy."
555742,hawk82,2006-03-29 13:09:00,126,Gas went up 20 cents per gallon in Iowa today....WHY...Who the he11 knows!?
555746,wildduck223,2006-03-29 14:21:00,38,Sorry about that! Stehle. Didn't read your post right.
555751,Guest,2006-03-29 16:45:00,0,"gas prices? we've been paying $3.00 to $4.00 US a gallon in Canada for over a year now! not too mention: $33 for a case of beer $11 for a pack of smokes (but, hey the government throws in open heart surgeory for free to though) my philosophy is this.......screw it man, you're on vacation, put it on visa and party!!! Life is too short!!! eat, drink, smoke, catch fish and be merry!!!"

555755,Guest,2006-03-29 19:51:00,0,"$3.25 a gallon by Memorial Day?? Nah our boy Dubya(cough cough) will figure out a way to keep gas under $3 a gallon, i just know he will. I mean give the man some credit, you know he just wouldn't feel right flying all over the world for free in air force one while us average hard working americans try to make ends meet and now try and convince our wives that paying an extra $50-$100 in fuel bills just so we can road trip to canada fishing is really worth it. In fact I heard that W is actually an avid fisherman and last summer rumor has it that he made a secret trip to LOTW and one early morning he went for a jog, and as he came to a low water bridge he stumbled on a rock and in the creek he fell. Three boys who were fishing in the creek jumped in and saved old George. When they pulled George to shore he said ""boys, for saving my life i'll give each of you 1 wish, whatever you want it's yours."" The first boy said, ya hey der i'd like me a new pair of Nike Air Jordans. W says no problem i'll even get Michael to autograph em for ya. The 2nd boy says i'd like a trip to DisneyWorld. W says no problem i'll even take you and your whole family on air force one. The 3rd boy says i'd like one of those new high tech motorized wheelchairs with an umbrella and a dvd player on it. George says why would you want one of those, you're not handicapped? The boy says i will be after i get home and tell my dad i saved you behind from drowning."
555758,JimH,2006-03-29 21:33:00,320,"I heard he's so concerned about gas prices, that he cancelled his hunting trip with Cheney.;-)"
