556141,Skylane,2006-04-11 07:21:00,101,"Jigman, the guys in Alaska feel the same way. I sympathise with your problem as I drive from central Illinois, through Wisconsin, to encroach on the people of Ontario. We are all part of the problem to these great areas, whether it be the tourist or even the old time family that moved to that great place 40 years ago (they moved in, which increased the local population and became part of the ""problem"") to the existing residents. The Dryden, Ontario area was not homesteaded until the late 1890's. Look how we all rush through there now. People now have more disposable income, the road systems are better and the media highlites the great getaway places. This is only going to be more of an issue as the population increases. The only hope, space exploration, maybe they will find an untouched planet that resembles the North Woods. Tourists could go there to do all their deer hunting, fishing, boating and snowmobiling. Just a thoght."

555808,Mohleye,2006-03-31 10:37:00,368,"A lot would depend on where you were on Lac Seul. Kenora to Winnipeg is about 2 hours. My mom died in 2002 while I was in the Red Lake area. I had to go through a lot of options in a hurry, but the bottom line was the time was about the same driving vs flying by the time it was said and done. However, I was trying to get to Iowa. To Chicago, I'd think driving to Winnipeg would be the best choice. No one in our group had ever given any thought as to what we would do in a situation like this. If I could offer some advice to those reading this thread, take a little time with your group and put a plan together before you go."

555907,waleht,2006-04-03 05:14:00,132,Maybe they don't want you Chicago guys in Canada? However I would rather see you flying than driving through Wisconsin. :rotflmao:

555920,Guest,2006-04-03 16:31:00,0,You need us hard working people in Chicago so we can go on vacation and spend our hard earned cash and support the people in Wisconsin and Canada. Q. You know what you call a good looking lady in Wisconsin? A. A Tourist!!!!!!!!! :rotflmao: I am saying this in jest for those of you easily offended.

555935,jigman 2003,2006-04-04 08:44:00,981,"Support the people in WI and Canada? If you call buying up all of the lakefront land and creating a situation where the lifelong locals can't afford to live in Vilas, Oneida, and other counties, then yep, I guess you Chicago people are supporting us ""poor"" Wisconsinites. I'm sure Ontarians (?) feel about the same. I realize your comments were in jest, but you should know that most of here would rather you stayed in the Dells than really going ""up north""."
555769,Guest,2006-03-30 09:38:00,0,"I will be going to Lac Seul in June. Even though I plan for everything, emergencies do arise, and I could have to get back to Chicago in a hurry. Are there any airports up north that have regular flights to Chicago?"
555776,Guest,2006-03-30 11:59:00,0,"You won't find any commercial non stop flights directly to Chicago unless you drive over to Winnipeg and fly from there. You might be able to get a direct flight from International Falls as well. For the most part if you fly from Kenora or Thunder Bay or any other small airport up there you will have a connection via Winnipeg, Minneapolis or International Falls then on to Chicago."
555795,tly,2006-03-30 21:45:00,1900,Sioux Lookout has a reasonable airport and apparently some sccheduled flights but am unsure to where. Some of the resorts tout the airport as a quicck way to get there so there must maybe be something. Suggest googling the airport TLY

555796,tly,2006-03-30 21:52:00,1900,"Just googled it. You have no real choices. There are 3 'airlines' listed, none of which get you closer that Ft Francis. You are probably better off getting to International Falls and taking a NWA/Mesaba flight."

555798,Skylane,2006-03-31 06:38:00,101,"I have looked into this in the past and at have not found any quick ways (at least when I was looking). You can get a flight out of Sioux Lookout or Dryden that will eventually get you to Chicago but with the connections and layovers you would probably get back about as fast if you drove, (you could get a one-way rental car if you were with a group). Dryden does not have any charter service options available but you might check with the airport at Sioux Lookout. Let us know what you find out, I would be curious."
