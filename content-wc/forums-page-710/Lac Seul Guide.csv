556187,NateW,2006-04-12 22:31:00,96,"I guess there is one in every crowd, and this time its me. I don't think you need a guide on Lac Seul. This will be our fifth trip to Lac Seul and never once have we hired a guide. we asked questions from the outfitter, we've talked to people on this board, we've studied the lake maps and always had excellent fishing--and we are LOUSY fishermen. Consider this: Of our group (of all late 30's early 40's) two of our guys had not been fishing since we the early teens. One of us has fished nothing but catfish in a small Iowa river. There are basically two of us who have an idea of what we are doing--and even then that isn't much. Most of the time we are the least experienced group in camp, but from what we hear, we catch about as many fish as the guys who have been fishing here for 10 or 15 years. We started going to Lac Seul in 2000. Never once had a guide, we just relied on maps, suggestions from the outfitter and tips from this forum. Each year we have our few favorite places we always hit. But then we just start trying things. Try different structures, try different styles of shorelines. By midway through the second day you will have probably identified a pattern. Go from there. This is not a rocket scientist lake. I am sure the lac suel guides are very good, but my personal experience is they are not necessary. Good luck."
556189,Guest,2006-04-13 02:16:00,0,"Just because it is relevant, I pasted a post I made from just a month ago on the same topic below. The thread developed in a certain fashion, but the question was essentially whether a guide was needed, so it speaks to the point here: Absolutely. I have guided Lac Seul for years, albeit in the larger section of water in the centre of the lake. I challenge most new guests midday to point towards the lodge, or I ask them ""if something happened to me right now, how would you get back to camp?"" In most cases, they have no clue! Granted my section of the lake is more confusing than near Ear Falls, AND my guests are guided everyday so they are not as worried about paying attention to navigation as perhaps they would be knowing they would later be on their own. Lac Seul is full of fish, but a guide will put you on them quicker, give you the right presentation(s), and show you not only structure to fish, but also structure that will cause you to need a tow back to camp if you hit it. I could provide countless examples . . . here's a recent one from September. There were three unguided boats from another lodge fishing an area I have fished alot. They really weren't in a great location (not on the spots-on-spots if you will), though I could see them catching the odd fish. I proceeded to start working a large sand break, where being out of position by as little as a boat length will greatly decrease fish production. After maybe 30 fish in an hour between the three of us, we went for lunch on a nearby beach. Because it was still ""hopping"" when we left for lunch, we went back there. The other three boats (not surprisingly) had moved almost to where we were. And (again not surprisingly) they were catching more fish, but the fish would come and go, because they were not working the structure properly. Because the structure break is very long, I pulled in further down. My guests were laughing because they knew the other boats had moved after seeing us boat so many fish before lunch (this is typical when other boats are within viewing distance). Anyway, I told my guests it was time for a clinic. We then started producing easily three times more fish than all three other boats combined, because of that specific knowledge I had on fishing that particular break (which I had fished four times previously that week; experience that no visiting fisherman could ever have). Most of the time, I just pack up and leave, nothing is ever said. On this particular day, as we were slowly pulling out and putting jackets on, etc., we were within shouting distance, and the one guy called over ""What are you using for bait?"" ""The same thing as you"", I responded (jig with a minnow). The guy then said, ""Yeah, we thought we were doing great until you guys pulled up . . ."", to which I simply responded ""Enjoy the rest of your day""! As I cranked up the motor, my one guest turned to the other and said ""That's why we use a guide"", to which under my breath I said ""Exactly!"" Yes Lac Seul is full of fish, and yes if you go unguided you will certainly catch fish (particularly if you have been there before). But what you think is good, is probably relatively crap, but you don't know any better. Even if you have been there once a year for 20 years, it can't replace having been on the water everyday that current year. And as was correctly mentioned previously, not only is it my experience, but I have the first-hand info. from 10 other guides who sit around the table with me and eat dinner, sharing all their information from that day on the water. No guest, no owner, no textbook, or anything else can replace that amount of first-hand knowledge from a group with that much theory and practical application on that fishery behind them. So the choice for a guide I guess is completely yours. But it's simply laughable, when people spend $400 on gas to travel, around $1000 for a 5-7 day trip, any food, possibly bait, etc., etc., but they contemplate dropping $125 on a guide for a day (per boat). NWO Fishing Bum"
556202,Brax,2006-04-13 12:48:00,52,"I agree, a guide is a very good investment. You can gain a lot of knowledge from a good guide. If it's your first time or your only time going it is probably a good idea to get a guide for one or two days. BUT I must say, I have never hired a guide on Lac Seul. Catching fish is only a part of the act of fishing for me. Finding the spots, trying different lures or baits are all part of it. What it comes down to is that these are my choices and when I catch fish it is my success. It takes a little fun out of fishing when someone drives you to a spot, tells you what to use as bait and how to present it. Yes you catch fish, but it's not the same for me. I go to Lac Seul every year and do pretty good considering it's my son and I. We are not hard core fisherman, so I'm sure many people out fish us. But I am happy with the 50+ fish days doing it my way."
556204,Guest,2006-04-13 14:22:00,0,Right on Brax....Dont need a guide on Lac Seul. I have fished with Guides on Lac Seul and they just get in the way and dont have any more fishing skill than any dummy with a boat and motor who can read a depth finder and fish the windy side of an island. Spend your money on beer and enjoy fishing in the Walleye Factory they call Lac Seul. Having a Guide on Lac Seul is like taking a 6 pack into a bar.....YOU DONT NEED IT.
556205,Hump,2006-04-13 14:50:00,578,"This will be my second year at Lac Seul. We did not hire a guide last year and we caught alot of fish. However... This year I am hiring a guide for the morning, not to fish, but to show us where the dangerous spots are, how to get to different spots and while driving around, mark with the GPS. I know from a comfort level, this will make my trip better. We didn't stray far from camp last year, and doubt we will this year, but at least I know the paths to get there safely. Can't wait, Lac Seul is great!"
556210,Guest,2006-04-13 20:55:00,0,"Hey NWO, what are your thoughts on clients bringing a GPS unit and marking hazards, some fishing spots, and your travel routes? If I was able to make sure I didn't ruin a motor/boat and locate some better fishing areas without getting lost than I agree that your fee is a bargain. Do you have a problem with clients wanting to ""mark"" areas to avoid ruining a trip? As a 1st timer to Lac Seul, and also bringing my aging Dad, any way that I can make the trip more enjoyable & worry free, I'm interested in. Let me know your thoughts."
556211,Guest,2006-04-13 21:12:00,0,"If this post is in reference to my post, I guess I don't understand. I am not looking for his fishing spots, i am looking at safety more than anything. I will give you an example: first time on Lac Seul, carefully making our way thru an inlet and I hit a stump, first hour on the lake. No damage, but I questioned going that way. Why not hire a guide to show you the safe ways around a lake."
556212,Guest,2006-04-13 23:54:00,0,"Ahh Hump, I agree with you 100%. Not just because I guide once in awhile but I've seen first hand on what kind of damage is out there. I've hit so many rocks, that I know where not to go.. hehe Please pay a guide to take you fishing, they have to pay for all those bottom ends. Mind you I still hit rocks while hunting in new spots.. Not often but it happens. My buddy took out the bottom end of his 225 Merc last year $10 000 damage. Ouch.. You want to play you gotta pay.. Yes it's a small investment for peace of mind. Mista Walleye"
556216,Guest,2006-04-14 06:15:00,0,I too am looking to avoid problems not necessarily his best spots. I just want to make sure of SAFE routes around the lake and wondered if a guide would have a problem with marking areas with their GPS.
555440,Guest,2006-03-18 13:17:00,0,"I am going to Lac Seul for the first time & would like to get a guide for the first day. I am staying at Golden Fawn by ear falls. Does anybody know of a guide they can recommend? Thanks, Dave"
555484,Guest,2006-03-21 13:46:00,0,Just ask at the resort for a guide and they will give one a call. All the resorts around there use the same guides. Ask for Fishy or Doug. They will know at the resort who these guys are. Have a good one.
555485,Guest,2006-03-21 15:08:00,0,Dan and Keith at Fisherman's Cove guide and do a great job. They are not far from Ear Falls.
556149,Guest,2006-04-11 16:09:00,0,"Hi Dave, If your looking for a licensed professional guide I know of one that lives on Lac Seul. He does get busy but if he is available I'm sure he would take you out and show you around. The people at Golden would know him well. Ask for Ken. Or you can e-mail me."
556150,Guest,2006-04-11 16:56:00,0,If you want to book a Guide call the Resort and book him NOW. Your date may not be open if you wait.
556154,Guest,2006-04-11 17:14:00,0,"After what I witnessed on Lac Seul last year, I would not hire a guide unless someone referred him to me. My son and I were fishing near an island in Mckinzie bay. A small boat was heading right for us, at first I thought he didn't see me because his bow was so high. As they got closer they started shutting down. They stopped us and asked directions back to a resort up near Ear Falls. Mind you that was about 15 or so miles away through an island filled lake. They told us they came out with a guide the resort owner setup for them. He was in the other boat with their friends. They expained he was drunk on his a** and could barely talk. I half did not believe them until the guide's boat came flying up and almost on shore of the island. I could see this guy was way too drunk. I suggested the fellows in the guides boat drive but it never happened. I told them I would bring them to the area but wasn't sure exactly where the resort was. We started for the narrows and the one boat followed, but the guide just sat there. Once inside the narrows we stopped and waited for the guide's boat. During this time another boat pulled up and asked if there was a problem, so we explained the situation. Just about then the Guides boat came tearing around the corner, he was running flat out half way between the channel buoys and shore. This scared the #### out of me because I thought I was about to witness them hitting a reef at full speed. They did make it through there, thank God. The other boat we meet in the narrows knew where the resort was and volunteered to take them the rest of the way. This whole ordeal lasted about an hour for me. When I got back to the resort I was staying at, I told the resort owner about what had happened and said he should call the police. When he heard the name of the resort, he sounded like he knew exactly which guide it was. He said he would call the other resort owner but that's the last I heard about the incident. Bottom line is don't trust just any local guide or the one the resort sticks you with unless you can get references or a referral. Remember you are entrusting YOUR safety to the Guide. (Note: the resort was not Golden Fawn)"
556164,Guest,2006-04-12 01:16:00,0,"There are plenty of good guides on Lac Seul, so don't let the story deter you too much, though the advice to ensure you are getting somebody trustworthy and safe, it certainly good. From the wealth of different stories I've seen or heard, guides that are associated with one particular lodge, or better yet that live right at the lodge, seem to be more favourable than those who live somewhere locally, and just show up at a given place on a given morning. Guides that eat and live at a resort tend to be much more accountable to that lodge and it's guests. Obviously, lodges that offer alot of housekeeping, don't employ many guides full-time. Conversely, a lodge with almost all fully-guided, full American plan have a constant staff living at the lodge all summer. NWO Fishing Bum"
556165,Brax,2006-04-12 07:17:00,52,"NWO, The post was not to scare off anyone, just to make people aware they should do their homework and find a good guide. I agree with you that there are many good guides in the area. I also agree, I would stay away from the guide that only works once in awhile when he gets a call. There were a few names already given in this posting for good guides. My advice would be to make some calls and get setup with one of these guides before your trip (as soon as possible). That way you are assured of who will be taking you out. Also hiring a guide is not an area you want to skimp on, the cheapest guide is not always the best deal."
556166,Guest,2006-04-12 10:58:00,0,I would recommend hiring the Guide for the first two days you are there. This will give you twice as much info and you will probably get to see twice as much water. A one day trip with a Guide lets him know for sure that you want his spots.
556173,Guest,2006-04-12 14:56:00,0,"Just a little something about local guides. I'd say 99% of them do not have a license or business license where the town does a background check, they would also have to provide references from a goverment employee or persons from the community who would stand for these people. Not that they don't do a great job but they are not liable in case something does happen. You would be hard press to find qualified guides. Local Marina's or maybe the camp that your dealing with would know of one or two in the area. Actually your local MNR would also know. Ask the camp that your dealing with to provide a qualified and licensed guide. I spoke to Ken last night and they know him well, he guided for golden. He is licensed guide and he doesn't drink.. Good luck"
