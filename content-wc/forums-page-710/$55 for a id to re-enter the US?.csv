555422,MTWalleyeHunter,2006-03-16 13:59:00,61,This summer you will need nothing more than a photo i.d. and proof of citizenship (birth certificate or passport).

556240,waleht,2006-04-16 04:45:00,132,In the past all I had was my photo drives license.....is that still good enough. I never have taken my birth certificate?
556250,Guest,2006-04-16 22:10:00,0,In the long run it's easier to ruin the hundred bucks and get a passport. Eventually you'll need it to get back into the country reguardless where you go. I got mine five years ago for Canada and its a lot easier at the border to hand the officer a stack of passports for the whole group then have everyone digging out thier wallets.
556253,Guest,2006-04-17 01:06:00,0,Passport??? Why would we do that..that would make sense. :)
