1567873,Huskerpike,2013-03-17 23:32:00,4,We will be heading to the Big Island Outpost on Kississing this years Canada trip. We have used Curt before when he had an outpost on the Churchill but have never fished Kississing. Looking for some suggestions as this is a much larger body of water than we are used to as we typically visit outpost on much smaller lakes. Any and all info would be greatly appreciated.

We caught fish pretty much all over the lake but here are a few suggestions you might try. For walleye there is a small island at the north end of ""Devil's Narrows"" and the saddle between the small island and the larger island on the west side is a hot spot. If you go to the west end of the lake (most of our biggest pike have come from that side of the lake) walleye can be found jigging in front of a steep rock cliff noted on the map as ""The Wall"" and also in ""Burkes Narrows"". ""Art's Hole"", ""Bottle Neck Bay"" and ""Muskwa Bay"" have been our best Big Pike producers. hottest lure has been a yellow or gold Cyclops spoon. There are some great deep water holes within eyesight of the main lodge for lakers. Good luck and hope you have a great trip."
