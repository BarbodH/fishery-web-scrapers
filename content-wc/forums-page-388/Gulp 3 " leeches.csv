1553105,ftfarms,2013-03-14 11:02:00,444,We've caught very few on the leeches but the gulp minnows have more then once out fished live minnows. I think the leeches need to be thinner and wider so they have more action but that's just me
1577362,Woollybob,2013-03-20 11:15:00,158,"I have had the same experience: Live leeches have far out-performed the Gulp leeches, though I did catch one huge 'eye on Lac Seul with one last year. But, have also caught fish on gummy worms and sliced hot dogs.Can usually out-fish live minnows in early summer with gulp minnows or grubs, but not later in the season."
1545593,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-02 12:02:00,1460,"I find it very interesting that everyone agrees that the Gulp leeches fail miserably to effectively catch walleye. In my group, I've been the guy who especially likes to use leeches for meat. With the price of leeches being so high (approx 40$/pound) yea, I've given em a go. I concur with everyone else. Crap"
1545594,tooski,2013-03-02 12:07:00,393,Can't say on the Gulp leeches but I have had good luck with the Trigger X leeches on Abamasagi.
1545598,KTroller,2013-03-02 12:30:00,237,"Nope, never had any luck with any size Gulp Leeches. Minnow grubs have been ok but Powerbait twisters are better.KT"
1545647,lcwhit,2013-03-02 15:02:00,104,"i've drug them behind bouncers. the 5"". they did ok. i keep them in the boat for when i run out of crawlers."
1545745,Flip Silverlake,2013-03-02 19:44:00,645,I use the 3 inch Gulp Leach with great success after the sun drops below the tree line You have to use a little more rod movement but I have out fished live bait with the Gulp bait. In direct sunlight live bait works better.
1546067,Ranger319,2013-03-03 14:14:00,166,"I would rather fish with my shoe lace than use Gulp. Have tried it year after year and have never had success. Keep buying it because it looks good and each year I cuss myself out for buying more. Trigger X--GREAT. Have always had success using it. That being said, my uncle's group does a fly in somewhere up in Canada and only use Gulp Minnows/Leeches and they swear by them."
1546216,Radnine,2013-03-03 19:33:00,141,I had good success drop shotting last summer with Gulp leeches. Jim
1549391,kona7,2013-03-10 10:33:00,6,"We had good success with a 3"" pumpkinseed color leach on a lake we fished on for several years. NO luck the last two years on another body of water. I am always surprised to see comments about Gulp product not catching any fish for some guys. We have always had good success with the Gulp minnows.. With a fly in we can't take live minnows and last year was our first try with salted minnows. Gulp product still caught as many fish as the salted ones. Not knocking anyone's fishing ability since I am average at best.. Just makes you realize how different baits work on various bodies of water."
1551231,polaris-pete,2013-03-13 13:31:00,343,"I quit using Gulp leeches many Years ago up in Canada when a fella came out with a product called SLIMERS.I have caught many many fish using these artifcial Leeches.They are almost like using the real thing. I order a few jars each Spring just to be sure he has them available when I go. They are called SLIMERS for a reason! When you take them out of the jar and hold one, its so loose and slimy you would think you had a real leech in your hand.No rubbery feeling as in the Gulp version. He came out last Year with a grub that I used ice fishing and put a lot of nice Panfish on the ice using these. No I don't have any interest in his Business just passing along an alternative to the Gulp and costly Leeches."
1552001,team walleye,2013-03-14 07:01:00,336,I have tried Gulp many times in Canada and at home.. 0 fish!
1545320,Gipper,2013-03-01 18:28:00,76,"Has anyone had any experience using Gulp leeches for walleyes? If so, how do they compare with the real leeches as far as effectiveness?"
1545364,Fishin Fun,2013-03-01 20:21:00,218,"I've tried them the past 2 years and have had little to no success. Real ones seems to work so much better for me. Others have had great success with Gulp products, but I haven't."
1545416,Pooch,2013-03-02 03:34:00,4619,"I've never had any luck with anything in the Gulp lineup. And I keep trying. I thought the Gulp leeches would work behind BB and spinners, but did not. That was disappointing as I had high hopes of not buying real leeches.I've all but given up on Gulp, but still catch fish on regular plastic. Which makes no sense to me. Has to be the action or something. Maybe the fish just don't like the gulp smell/odor/texture? Something Berkley has put a lot of effort into.Most all of my fishing is in Canada in stained water so maybe that has something to do with it.Pooch"
1545431,tv4fish,2013-03-02 05:23:00,2694,"I would say that live leeches are always going to be better. However, I always have Gulp with me when we fish Lac Seul (both leeches and minnows). If we get into a good bite, I catch as many walleyes with a Gulp leech as my 2 buddies do with live leeches. If they're ""finicky"" - I stick with a live leech. Oh, we always fish with a small jig and vertical jig as we drift."
1545483,Bill Krejca,2013-03-02 07:24:00,6107,"Gulp leeches have been just OK. I have had very good luck on the older Power Bait black leeches. These are the 3"" flat baits, which are very soft. I rig with a 5/8 oz short shank no collar orange jig head and fish vertically, bait being maybe 2""off bottom. I move the bait up and down - but just barely - think like ice fishing, maybe. Bill Krejca"
1545503,Gipper,2013-03-02 07:51:00,76,Power Bait..interesting. We'll bring both as back up to the real thing. We sometimes run out of leeches at the wrong time......when we need them.
1545519,Mike Borger,2013-03-02 08:13:00,1554,"No luck whatsoever with the Gulp leeches, but the 4"" Gulp minnows on a jighead have been lethal. As good or better than live bait at times."
1545529,Seanik,2013-03-02 08:37:00,218,"We never had much success with Gulp leeches. Live leeches lightly hooked to a #2 red true turn hook attached to a slip sinker about 2' above the hook always worked great. This set up allows the leech to crawl around the bottom or float just above it. Different baits for different lakes, Flindt Landing Camp wher we usually go, leeches are ok but the hot bait last year was salted fathead minnows on a 1/4 oz jig. Usually live bait is better. Seanik"

1545584,JBwvu,2013-03-02 11:16:00,18,"I would guess time of year would be a big factor here. I fish with Gipper and we will be fishing mid to late July at depths of 16-20 feet. Minnows are almost non-existent by then and even if they are available, hard to keep alive and pretty much ineffective. Does this effect some of the above comments? In the past when we went in June, minnows were the bait along with twisters and crank baits."
