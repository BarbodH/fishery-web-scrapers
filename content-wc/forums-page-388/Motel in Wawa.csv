1576714,Overwatchmike,2013-03-20 09:01:00,201,I own a cabin past Wawa and there are hotels past the big goose along 17 also.The flooding last year took out two huge sections of 17 by the Ford dealership. If staying in town remember to stop at Young's General Store for their awesome summer sausage!

1557609,Cut a deal,2013-03-15 11:33:00,38,Ah Fred guess you haven't heard. You can fish from room 5 right out of the bedroom window.http://www.nlmotel.com/
1558073,TIGHTLINER,2013-03-15 13:49:00,223,THERE IS A WAWA MOTOR IN OR LODGE GOING INTO TOWN WOULD BE ON YOUR LEFT. SHORTLY AFTER THE GOOSE. STAYED THERE 20 YEARS AGO WAS LIKE 15 BUCKS A PERSON AND WE HAD BREAKFAST AT 5 AM AND WERE ON OUR WAY BY 6 AM. DO A CHECK THEY HAVE A 800 NUMBER. FILLS UP FAST ONCE THE FISHING SEASON STARTS.
1558553,[emailÂ protected],2013-03-15 15:33:00,21,"I have stayed at Parkway Motel on the south side of Wawa for years. It is like all of them in the area, being a Motel, not a Holiday Inn. It is always very clean."
1560105,grapeape,2013-03-15 20:50:00,156,"As far as I know Northern Lights will be open in the spring. I know the owners personally and saw the flood damage 3 weeks ago. Cheapest place to stay in Wawa is the Sportsman, not bad if your just crashing for the night."
1560705,Mike Borger,2013-03-16 05:17:00,1554,"I've stayed at pretty much every motel in Wawa, and I like the Mystic Isle the best. It's on hwy 17 just south of Wawa. The nice part is it's set way back from the hwy on a high heavily wooded hill. It's a very nice setting, you can't see the hwy or hear any vehicles at all in the rooms. Rooms are fantastic, very nice.http://www.mysticisle.com/rooms.html"
1560809,ed08walleye,2013-03-16 05:52:00,27,I'll second Solo's opinion. Very good food at the restaurant that's there too.
1563209,Tylumps,2013-03-16 17:38:00,73,"Hello, Been to Wawa quite a bit over the years. I would not recommend the Wawa Motor Inn. The Chalets always seemed way over priced and the restaurant is just not very nice. For just plain old hotel rooms, we always liked the Bristol which is in the heart of Wawa. I heard from some others that the Best Northern Hotel and Restaurant is a nice place with good food. We are going to try the High Falls Motel this year. High Falls is rated #1 by Trip Advisor and has some great online reviews. If you stay in town, like at the Bristol, go to the Embassy Restaurant for breakfast. Great breakfast and they open early on Saturday morning."
1563313,unclepaully,2013-03-16 18:05:00,112,"The best place hands down is High Falls Cabins. We stayed there last summer for $90. Huge bathroom, nice little kitchen, 40in flat screen, outdoor bbq, gazebo, and great owners(Anna & Zenon). Upon check in, I asked about a local waterfall. She said if it was too far to walk we could use their bikes.There's a reason why it's rated as the #1 spot to stay in Wawa on tripadvisor. http://www.highfallsmotel.com/rooms.html"
1568929,10lbeye,2013-03-18 10:39:00,61,"I have stayed at the Bristol many times and it is perfect for us. Inexpensive, and every time it was super clean. Also close to many restaurants and Timmies, grocery stores, etc."
