1558681,Skywagon,2013-03-15 16:21:00,1106,This is the bait fish yesterday's catch was snacking on http://i1178.photobucket.com/albums/...ps664fed82.jpg
1554089,MrSimon,2013-03-14 14:54:00,922,"I've started painting my own crankbaits and I'd like to ""match the hatch"" with what fish in canadian shield lakes actually eat. Perch I know, but what else are they eating, and what do they look like? Thanks!"
1554153,Pooch,2013-03-14 15:07:00,4619,"Minnows. Ciscos, whitefish, crawdads, each other.The more I actually try to ""match the hatch"" the less fish I catch. I've never seen a pink or purple native freshwater fish, but we catch a lot of walleye, pike and small mouth on those and other weird colored crank baits.Just look a the colors people are posting of cranks and spinner blades they are hand painting on this forum. I've never seen a fish any of those colors, but you can bet that some of them at any given time will be fish getters.Last year I faithfully copied the colors in pictures of common baitfish and I don't think I ever did catch a fish on any of them. Maybe I got the colors all wrong. Fish see color a lot different than we do and color shifts at depth.Search some of the recent threads on color. Lots of got information.Just a thought.Pooch"
1554305,Guest,2013-03-14 15:49:00,0,A couple of rarely thought of shield lake walleye meals are sculpins and troutperch. A brown jig will represent a sculpin as well as a crayfish. You could google up a troutperch. Walleye like them because they have no spines.
1555577,Hewhocookstomuch,2013-03-14 21:16:00,66,"One the most successful for me has been the Dare Devil. I do not know of a fish of that is red with a broard white horizontal stripe on one side. Yet that lure has been hit so many times at least 10% of it's paint is missing. Yet to see an international orange fish in the Canadian lakes, however that is my #one jig. Just saying."
1555681,zeebee,2013-03-14 21:59:00,1144,"When it comes to cranks and walleye in NW Ont, Ive had my best success over the years on silver/blue, gold/blacks, perch and variations thereof. While the bright parrot colours do work on occaison, I prefer to delegate those spectrums to my jigs. This may vary somewhat from lake to lake but I would not become anxious if the only bright colors in my tackle were the jigs, spinners and spoons."
1555857,Pooch,2013-03-15 04:13:00,4619,"For many years on shield lakes my ""goto"" crank is black over gold. That reinforces my belief that walleye cannibalize their young and each other.Pooch"
1555969,Davis Viehbeck,2013-03-15 05:28:00,48,"Common baitfish or forage for walleye throughout Northwestern Ontario include: -Pearl Dace -Common white sucker -Shiner (more common in the Lake of the Woods region) -Rainbow Smelt (considered invasive but found in certain large bodies of water such as Rainy, Lake of the Woods, Dog Lake, Northern Lights) -Ciscoe (Lake Herring) -Fatheads Although not considered baitfish, yellow perch will make up a component of a walleye's diet on certain lakes. Crayfish, Leeches and a variety of aquatic invertebrates are also critical forage for walleye."
1555977,Davis Viehbeck,2013-03-15 05:29:00,48,"By the way, although it looks nothing like any natural baitfish, Rapala's ""Clown"" colour is without question one of the most productive colours for walleye throughout the northwest."
1556129,Bill Krejca,2013-03-15 06:32:00,6107,"My ""conventional knowledge"" concept, the knowledge portion of which I admittedly am still acquiring, tends to have me lean toward the following conclusion/action plan: - In waters that are murky, algae prone, i.e,. limited visibility, I usually have better success with baits that are high visibility ( at least to me). Colors like bright orange, flouro's, pink, chart green, etc. My belief is that the fish in these waters are prone to strike baits which make their presence known, i.e., are easy to see. - In waters generally considered '""clear"", baits that are of more natural coloration - the ""hatch"" appearance attract more fish, with bright colors being not as appealing to the fish. Selection of baits and colors according to the above precepts is my approach. Except when I do just the opposite. Bill Krejca"
1556577,MrSimon,2013-03-15 08:11:00,922,"Thanks for the info! I will look up some of those bait fish and try and paint a similar pattern. I also agree that fish are weird and often hit things that look completely unnatural .... which should make lure painting fun =) Like someone above already said, silver and blue seems to work well .... so I painted a handful of rattle trap style baits last night. I haven't coated them in epoxy yet, but they still look pretty good."
