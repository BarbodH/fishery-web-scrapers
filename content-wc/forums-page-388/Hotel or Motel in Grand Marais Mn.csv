1558641,camp chef,2013-03-15 15:55:00,915,We've stayed at the Super 8 many times. Nice clean inexpensive.
1558937,Jarbear,2013-03-15 17:23:00,24,Check out the Mangy Moose Motel. Not mangy at all! We stayed there last fall and plan on staying there again this fall on our way to Canada. Very clean and updated. You can park in front of your room. And the rates are reasonable. The motel is also walking distance to restaurants and other shops. The owners are very nice. Not sure about refrigeration. The rooms have small frigs in them.

1568417,Lovetofish,2013-03-18 08:19:00,458,We have stayed at the Aspen Lodge many times. Have a heated pool and hot tub which the kids enjoy. You can walk downtown.
1569033,Ralfeee,2013-03-18 11:12:00,33,"Stayed at the Best Western many times. They have small fridges in the rooms, or at least the rooms I have stayed in. How much space are you looking for refrigeration?"
