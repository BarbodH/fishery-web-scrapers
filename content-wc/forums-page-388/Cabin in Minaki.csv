I am trying to get a group of guys together, but that isnt looking good, due to prior commitments. We have always stayed at Paradise Cove, but that requires as six person minimum. I know that they have two person cabins at other propterties, but I would like AC, TV and a screened in patio/porch to enjoy the evenings. If any of you know of such a place for two people, please let me know. Thanks"
