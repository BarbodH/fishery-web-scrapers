1543199,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-02-25 16:51:00,358,Northern Lights Lake has an amazing smallmouth population. Target rocky shorelines and rock reefs. Try a four inch chartreuse grub on a darter leadhead. Those rock reefs have claimed many a lower unit. Get a map and good fishing.

Long run and be careful through nelson channel. I hit a rock in the dead center of that channel. The first cove on the right after the channel we did well on all 3, pike, walleye, and smallies. we also did very well for smallmouth around moose island. Good luck and let me know how you do."

People who know the lake do well. Great smallmouth fishing, lake trout and some nice walleye. From what I hear, the average size if the walleye seem to be larger. 18"" - 20"" +. It is a cold clear water lake and in the early season, my buddy fishes warmer water shallow bays with big minnows on a single octupus hook, long floro leaders, with barrel type slip sinkers. Cast, light a cigar and kick back. Fish takes the minnow, open the bail, feed slack, fish stops to swallow, tighten up and let him have it. Super simple back to basics approach, but when the fish are there he swears by it. If you like to fire cranks all day, and fidget with tackle and trolling motors and such it may not be for you. Good luck whatever you do! NL is a big, beautiful lake with alot of opportunities. cnb"
