1572242,Mondo,2013-03-19 08:51:00,61,"Just curious on your favorite jig color preferences at different times throughout the year. Last year, I was fishing the 2nd week of June and it seemed like Gold was the hot color ~ 5 to 1. It really surprised me and caught me off guard ~ emptied my tacklebox! During the 1st week of August, I was up for another week of fishing. Of course, I loaded up on Gold and told everyone in the fishing party to make sure they had enough! Needless to say, the 'eyes weren't interested at all in gold ~ instead Chartruese. Any experiences? Makes me curious as to why they favor one color over another on the same body of water. Different water temps (59 vs 67), but water clarity is the same. It didn't seem to matter whether it was cloudy or sunny... Darn fish are always outsmarting me!"
1572546,tackleman,2013-03-19 10:07:00,444,"i don't know if the fish are finiky or not , maybe they are like us, they want to change their diet up occcasionally. I always think, rightly or wrongly, that colour doesn't matter when they got the feed bag on, BUT, when the bite is slower, you got to look for that colour they get turned on by on that given day, in that given spot."

1573418,Habitual Eyer,2013-03-19 13:50:00,144,"I have been loving purple the last few years. Green, black and lime-chartrues always seem to pull fish."
1575114,jkwildhunting,2013-03-19 20:09:00,361,"Gold, Vegas Gold, Blue, Vegas Blue, Black, orange, chartruse, char/blue, pink, pink/chart, green....you get the picture"
1576098,Mondo,2013-03-20 06:51:00,61,"Thanks ~ I'll have to try a few more colors rather than my old habits of sticking to a few tried and true ones. As JK eloquently inferred, throw out whatever color you have until you find one that works... right! Good luck this year, guys."
1576106,johnboat,2013-03-20 06:53:00,2014,"On Gullrock if I could only bring one color it would be chartrousse. But, like others have stated, several colors are good there. I think its more of a matter of presentation than color choice."
