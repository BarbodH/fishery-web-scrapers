It looks like you have a very nice group, definitely know the lake and produce both great fish and a great time. You are a Class Act. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1558753,Walleyeski,2013-03-15 16:42:00,40,"stjoeguy,Any idea on how much snow they have had up there? Maybe Troy can fill us in? Lake was down quite a bit last year but still had great fishing! We will be there the first week of June. Been going to Winago Lodge for about 15 years, it will be my fourth trip to Lake St. Joes. Can't wait for that boat ride and listening to Dick tell stories. One of the best guys out there!"
1562569,stjoeguy,2013-03-16 13:07:00,979,"Walleyeski - I haven't started watching the water level yet, but here's the site: http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Click on Lake St. Joseph I don't know how they measure anything when the lake is frozen, but here is the current chart. It looks normal. http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LakeStJosephGraph2013.03.15.pdf Last year I was a little worried when lake levels were very low in the Spring. During June the level rose dramatically, however, and by the last week in June, when we were there, the lake was relatively high. Every year brings a different water level and different surprises. Last year's visible rocks are now just below the surface or vice versa. One year we fished an area that had 3 visible rocks in a row within 30 yards, so we called it the ""three stooges"". The next year water was down and we had a harder time recognizing the spot, since it was now just a little sandy/rocky island. Or zipping across the lake following a half dozen previously, safely travelled tracks only to realize that with the level 2 feet lower some of these tracks aren't as safe as before. I'm sure you'll have a great time and catch a ton of fish. P/M me and we can trade hot spots or at least help pass the time waiting for June."
1549078,stjoeguy,2013-03-09 12:54:00,979,"A death in the family has forced our 6th man to drop out of our trip to Lake St. Joseph, Ontario, 6/22/13 to 6/29/13. This is a 27 mile boat-in trip to a modern, solar powered cabin with 7 days of solitude and great Walleye & Northern fishing. The cabin will hold up to 10, so we have plenty of room. A search on this site will show that Lake St. Joseph is on many people's bucket list of lakes to fish. As you can tell by my user name, I really like this lake. Our group is from late 40's to mid 60's, from MN, IA & VA. One of the guys returning this year joined us last year via Walleye Central. The pictures below are from last year's trip. If you have any interest in joining us this June, send me a message and we can talk."
1549547,vaquero01,2013-03-10 16:38:00,101,Is this Winoga's cabin?
1549569,stjoeguy,2013-03-10 17:18:00,979,"Yes, it's the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin."
1549612,Hewhocookstomuch,2013-03-10 18:29:00,66,"Great fishing, great cabin, it is so far down the lake, it is as if we have the whole lake to ourselves."
1549824,Munshaw,2013-03-11 09:09:00,279,Someone who put a downpayment for the trip DIED and they won't refund??? Eeek. That seems a little low/selfish even for a camp owner... I'd be looking elsewhere to stay.
1549847,lassh,2013-03-11 09:35:00,553,I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate circumstances. I would offer to join your group but I have a conflicting commitment at Carrol Lake during that time period. St. Joe sounds like a great place. Its a great opportuntiy for someone.
1549855,stjoeguy,2013-03-11 10:04:00,979,"Munshaw,There is no issue with a down payment refund. It's a great camp and the owners have always been very helpful. The owner doesn't even know about any of this (although, Troy follows this site and has probably seen it). I was just saying that a group member had to drop out and I was opening up the trip to anyone that would like to fish a great lake. I'm just trying to increase the size of our group. It's not a money issue."
1550492,Guest,2013-03-12 11:34:00,0,cost?
1550554,Hewhocookstomuch,2013-03-12 12:58:00,66,"Cost, PM stjoeguy, he will break it down for you. I am figuring around $1500. Cabin, food, gas for boat and car. Road meals, licenses, bait and your own personal use items, you cover on your own. It is well worth the trip."
1550566,stjoeguy,2013-03-12 13:15:00,979,"I was going to say $1,400 - 1,500 each, but Hewhocookstomuch was quicker. The camp is 950 for 7 days. With tax some gas & misc. the camp total is usually about $1,100 each. Add another $300 or so for groceries and gas to and from Minneapolis. The biggest variables are gas prices and how many people are going in how many vehicles. What's the old TV add say - It's priceless."
