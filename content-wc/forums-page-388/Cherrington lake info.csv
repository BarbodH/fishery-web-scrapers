The portage lake is worth doing. Overall I was pleased with number and size of walleyes. If you go to the big lake area good fishing but water was very clear. We were there june20th so your pattern should be a liitle different. beautiful lake and cabin. There are 3-4 cabins on the lake but there is a lot of room and it won't be an issue.
