Something with good action.What part of July is best early or late?We would like a lake where you dont need to go 20 milesfor good fishing.Also looking for a maximum of 2 resorts or lodges on the lake.We would like a resort that offers a cabin and boat packagein the $400 - $750 range. This would be for my Wife and myselfso we would like a modern cabin. Thanks

1568833,tackleman,2013-03-18 10:11:00,444,"google sunset country and check out the lodges there.Gullrock, the lake i live on is great for walleye, there are 5 resorts on the lake but so many places to fish, you seem to have lots of privacy.(if you want it)check out 5 lakes lodge, southbay on gullrock, poplar point lodge, golden hook lodge, procyks angler paradise. i'm not sure of their prices but they have to be competitive."

1571370,tackleman,2013-03-18 23:32:00,444,"the whole lake is great fishing in July, August, and September. LOTS of walleye, if you check some of the old posts about gullrock, i think you would find catches of 50 to 100 per day are not uncommon.you can leave any resort on gullrock and be on fish in under 10 minutes. or you can catch them off the dock at most resorts.but if you come this far , i would think you would want to see the lake."
