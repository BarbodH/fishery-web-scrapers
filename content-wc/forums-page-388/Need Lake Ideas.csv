The group consists of myself, two of my good friends, and one of my cousins. Right now our planned trip is to go to Esnagami on a crown land camping trip. We are going in by way of Stinger creek > stinger lake> then portage into Esnagami. We are planning to set up a camp on one of the many islands. Everyone is on board with this plan however I was hoping to have a lake all to ourselves for the week. My questions is: Can anyone think of a lake near Nakina with similar or even better fishing where we would be (or most likely be) the only ones on the lake. Must be in the Nakina area since we are renting boats from a local outfitter there. No cabins, campgrounds, etc. We want to do this trip as rustic and as low budget as possible. Also no fly-ins, (not cheap enough )Thanks guys"

I was just thinking there has to be some lakes where one could portage into and not have an outpost or a lodge there. Really I'm fine with Esnagami, I just don't want to feel like we are ""imposing"" on the lodge guests by camping on a ""fly-in"" lake. I know it's perfectly legal to do so and we would set up camp miles from the lodge. I'm probably over thinking the whole thing."
