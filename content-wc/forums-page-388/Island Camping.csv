1564313,Shotgun,2013-03-17 06:43:00,759,Has anyone camped on islands at Lake Minnitaki. I heard it's not legal but can't find any details on it. Have one in our fishing party that wants to kayak out a couple nights of the week and camp overnight. We plan on keeping in contact with him by our marine radios and know what island he will be at. Any thoughts?
