1578602,Mlaker,2013-03-20 16:28:00,81,"Late summer. People would leave with 3 dozen minnows, fish all day and come back with leftovers and thought they had a good days fishing. If he is going w/ his wife, she probably wants to have nice stable weather and no bugs. You have to be a bit more selective on where you are going, and if it is new to him it might take a bit to find those special hot spots. Late May and early June you don't need to be selective at all on where you go in Ontario and you can do 50+ on Lake of the Woods."
1578634,oldfishhead,2013-03-20 16:36:00,7,thanks for all the great replies. i DO apprieciate it
1552593,oldfishhead,2013-03-14 09:14:00,7,"I'm looking to take a trip with my wife. wanting to fish a lake where we catch a lot of walleyes with a chance of some good quality. I have been to canada serval times and have never experienced a trip where we catch 50 fish a day per boat let alone the 100 fish per day i here about. I dont consinder myself a novice angler by any means. I fish extremely hard every day. I realize a flyin trip is probably best option for less pressured fish, but with 2 people that is kind of hard to do. just want her to experience great fishing (me as well) was thinking about Lost island lodge on lac seul or wildewood on savant. any opinion on which might be better. thank you"
1552705,115 optimax,2013-03-14 09:27:00,650,Lac Seul!!Tons of eaters and lots between 4-7 lbs per day.You have to see it to believe it.I fish Lac Seul on the Dryden side and it is truly awesome.Good luck on your choice!
1553097,rockape,2013-03-14 11:01:00,215,"Minnitaki, Lac Seul, and Eagle. Don't have to fly to any, and there are reasonably priced lodges on all. I've crushed it on all 3. Simple jig and minnow. You can do it on cranks too. Seems like they hit cranks harder. You just have to find the fish. Remember too that there are feeding windows, so don't leave fish to find fish. If you know they are there, it is just a matter of time!"
1553473,jambi,2013-03-14 12:23:00,504,"oldfishheadI've done five flyout trips over the years with only two guys. Rates weren't inflated. These were done both in early September or late May. Dont believe the minimums that they put on their websites. Many will fly two of you. Might have a better chance booking now as the season is about to start and they would rather have two in a camp then zero. If she is ok with flyout, (some without flush toilet or electricity), I would definitly do one. Having a lake or chain of lakes to yourself, primed with basically virgin waters, is an incredible way to go! PS - I can only think of one or two days that we didnt catch at least 50 fish per day over those five trips. Good luck"
1555377,rather-be-fishin,2013-03-14 19:56:00,429,"Oldfishhead ~ You can't go wrong with Lac Seul it is a Walleye Factory! You will catch numbers and size! Average fish you catch is 18-25"" fat walleyes that put up good fights. We have also caught 27"", 28, 30, 32"" walleyes! Simple jig/minnow or spinner/minnow rigs work well. Once you go there to fish Walleye you will be totally spoiled!!! I havent fished Lost Island Lodge, but have seen many positive posts on WC about it and also have seen fishing shows highlighting it. Looks like a nice place. I have been going to Lac Seul for 9 years Fisherman's Cove on Scout Bay area and it's always the highlight of my year! Four months and counting down the days to our return trip to Lac Seul! RBF"
1555865,Mike Borger,2013-03-15 04:15:00,1554,"By all accounts Savant and Seul are both excellent choices. My decision wouldn't be based solely on the fishing as they're both good. If it was me I'd choose Savant mainly because of the remoteness factor. Much more of a ""fly in"" feel than Lac Seul without having to fly in."
1555905,Pooch,2013-03-15 04:27:00,4619,"I fish both annually.The average sized walleye on Savant is larger than Lac Seul by several inches. The chance at an over thirty inch walleye are better on Lac Seul, but you'll have to go through a lot of fifteen incher's first.Lac Seul is a better numbers lake than Savant. On Savant you will probably catch half as many fish as Lac Seul, but the total pounds for the day will be about the same.Pooch"
1556113,stillangling,2013-03-15 06:26:00,149,"I have only fished Savant once but have considerably more experience on Lac Seul. My only experience on Savant was a poor one. I can offer a few thoughts about both. Lac Seul is part of the English River system (much of the surrounding area is clay) and is far more productive than Savant. Portions of Lac Seul are being fished fairly hard though (Ear Falls area especially). Probably the best walleye fishing that I have ever experienced was in the central portions of Lac Seul (north of Dryden). Very little development in that part of the lake so you have limited options in terms of resorts. Although I have not had the pleasure of going there, the NW portions of the lake are supposed to be very good as well. Once again, very little development in that part of the lake. So...when someone describes the fishing on Lac Seul as this or that, appreciate the fact that the lake is huge and varies significantly depending upon your location on the lake. My vote would be Lac Seul all the way but if you are fishing within sight of Ear Falls or Sioux Lookout/Hudson your expectations in terms of fishing quality should be reflective of the amount of fishing pressure in those areas."
1559305,Knoxabilly,2013-03-15 18:18:00,225,"Lac Seul- best fishing experience you'll have. Stay at Evergreen in Ear Falls, great people and they will help put you on fish if you're struggling."
1563073,Mlaker,2013-03-16 16:52:00,81,Thumbs down on Evergreen. Too far from best fishing. We had to travel up to 20+ miles east every day. The lodging was nice but had other issues make for a so-so experience.
