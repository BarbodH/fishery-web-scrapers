1557953,Glenman12,2013-03-15 13:24:00,762,Im sorry..should have been more specific..I meant the Ord River not the lake..
1560297,team walleye,2013-03-15 21:53:00,336,We access the Ord from Perrault
1564593,kseye,2013-03-17 08:26:00,7,You need 4x4 to get to ord lake either way you go.
1564713,JayM5209,2013-03-17 09:09:00,1050,"For sure! And, don't try to pull your own boat into Ord unless you get it from a reliable source that some work has been done on the last 3/4 mile. The last time I pulled my boat to Ord was four years ago and it was a terrible effort. We did it routinely and without problems for many years, but no one has touched that last section of road for years."
1568249,fishguide1800,2013-03-18 07:22:00,84,"There is a logging operation going on this winter and might still go on through the summer,either way the main road should be much better for travelling."
1570297,team walleye,2013-03-18 17:19:00,336,What road are you talking about? And are we talking the Ord River? Can't you get to the Ord river from a hand full of lakes?
1570529,JayM5209,2013-03-18 18:33:00,1050,"I've never been on the Ord River. My comments, and fishguide1800's, relate to accessing Ord Lake by road. Since Ord Lake's Puzzle Bay is my very favorite walleye fishing location in all of NW Ontario I shouldn't be doing this, but here's how you get there.Traveling south from Perrault Falls on Hwy. 105, south of Cedar Lake, south of Camp Robinson Road, at the south end of Cliff Lake and just a mile or two south of Deer Lake Road, turn left and go east on Judy Road. Take a left (north) on Ord Lake Road to April South Road (where the old Camp Robinson Rd. used to come thru from the west). Go east on April South Rd. to the right turn-off for the last 3/4 or 1 mi. into the Ord Lake landing. It's that last 3/4 mile that can get impassible at times. It's probably 12 or 14 miles from the pavement of 105 to Ord Lake.There it is . . . . but since there usually aren't signs with the roads' names and I can't remember mileage between the turns, I won't fret too much about Ord Lake getting crowded! I will tell you that two years ago I left the camp where we've stayed for thirty years to go to Ord, to be followed 5 minutes later by another truck with three guys, the driver having fished Ord Lake for 30+ years. I waited at the last turn off for 2 1/2 hours and the 2nd truck never showed up. When we went looking for them we ran into them at Hwy. 105. The entire time they had been driving the logging roads looking for Ord Lake!"

1549775,team walleye,2013-03-11 07:49:00,336,Going up to Perrault Lake in mid June and stating at Rainbow Point Lodge! Can't wait to get up there. Been many times but this will be the first stay at Rainbow!
1549863,Glenman12,2013-03-11 10:16:00,762,Have a great time..We'll be just south of you on Cedar Lake at about the same time..
1549939,team walleye,2013-03-11 12:39:00,336,"I think we will was over to Cedar one day to throw for some Musky, seems to be the lake for them!"
1550206,Glenman12,2013-03-11 20:17:00,762,"Ive been going to Cedar Lake for over 30 yrs..never fish Perrault until last year..have fished Spadina and the Ord though.. last year we made it a point to fish Perrault..tough winds out of the N/NW so just hit the bays along the south shore..over 40 walleyes between two boats in the 18-22"" range..we will watch the forecast next year and if those conditions arise we will be heading to Perrault.."
1550236,bigdaddyguns,2013-03-11 21:16:00,608,"Glenman, how have you done over on Spadina? We spent an hour or so on Spadina last summer mainly throwing top water over the weeds in the shallow southern section. Caught northerns but nothing else. Is the lake deeper towards the island? Catch any walleye in there? Thanks."
1550649,digjig,2013-03-12 15:11:00,146,"We will be heading up to RPL the last week in June. We have been going to RPL for 5 years now and love it. ""The Wall"" on the East side is a good section to drift. We will catch fish off the dock, in the bay camp is in, 1st bay, 2nd bay, Grassy bay, the wall, rainbow island. Plenty of spots. -DJ"
1550689,Glenman12,2013-03-12 16:36:00,762,It was a few years back..if I remember we trolled cranks and caught a few but not enough to have us make that run again..
1550856,team walleye,2013-03-12 21:24:00,336,"I will be up there the week before you, I can't wait!!"
1554265,digjig,2013-03-14 15:31:00,146,"Bob and Gayle are great owners. George, in charge of dock services, is always happy to help with locations, presentations, etc. Their Tuesday night fish fry is a great way to meet fellow RPLers and see why they have such a following of repeat customers. -DJ"
1556889,GeoFish,2013-03-15 08:57:00,70,Glenman12I am planning a trip and we may stay at the campground on Cliff.We want to fish mostly for Walleye and we were thinking about fishing Cedar.How does Cedar compare to Ord?What are you catching? How are you getting into Ord? A local friend of mine told me the road was washed out and we couldnâ€™t get into the lake without a 4 wheeler.Where do you stay when you fish Cedar?
