1561185,revitup,2013-03-16 07:55:00,140,Ok Juls. Thanks I did print off my license so I have that. Thought I was going to get a copy from them too. Guess I'm so excited about this trip that I don't want anything to go wrong! Just 12 weeks until wetting the line. I've told my fishing partners I want to get netting lessons from them by seeing how they net my big walleye!
1561217,Juls,2013-03-16 08:01:00,13414,Whew! Glad to hear you printed it off.... You're all set. ____________
1569161,Redlabel,2013-03-18 11:37:00,279,"Look on the back of your sportsman card, it should say what type of license you bought and when it expires. I am not saying don't bring your paper copy with you. What I am saying is when you buy both items on line at the same time it has this information on the back of the card. Take alooksee"
1569393,revitup,2013-03-18 13:02:00,140,"I took a good look and it does not say the dates my license is valid for. It says ""fishing"" and gives an expiration date of 12-31-2015. But there is nothing related to the 8 day nonresident license I bought at the same time. Again-I did copy my license when I purchased it online, so I have that to take with me."

1571802,Shellback,2013-03-19 06:39:00,8083,"What's a sportsman card? I have the outdoors card and nothing on my current or previous Outdoors card that reflects what license I bought. I buy annual conservation licences. Just name, height, eye color, date of birth and expiration date."
1571882,Juls,2013-03-19 07:08:00,13414,"My last outdoors card didn't have the lic info on it either. I renewed it this year and now it shows that information, so I think it's something new they are doing. ____________"
1572026,Shellback,2013-03-19 07:55:00,8083,"Okay, just got this off the ON licensing site. A licence to fish in Ontario consists of an Outdoors Card plus a fishing licence tag (either printed on the back of the card or accompanying the card). I'm a little confused because the Outdoors card is for 3 years, but my license is only for one. Now I see they offer 3 year licenses. I guess if you opt for the 3 year license, it part of your outdoor card too. Non-Canadian Residents Non-Canadian residents need an Outdoors Card to fish in Ontario if they are 18 years of age and over. (NOTE: Non-residents 65 years of age or older are not exempt from requiring a licence). The sportfishing licence tag (one year, three year or 8 day) or the conservation fishing licence tag (one year, three year or 8 day) accompanies the plastic Outdoors Card."
