I like to carry my fishing rods in a 4"" diameter x 8' rod carrier mounted on my roof rack. I can see where this device could be an inspection issue at the border crossing. I am thinking worst case I would have to dismantle the carrier and show it to the border crossing agent the contents. Anyone have any experiences crossing the border with one of these rod carriers to confirm or deny my assumption or provide any feedback or guidance on this??? Thanks."

1416801,bigdaddyguns,2012-04-05 11:59:00,608,Thanks guys for the feedback and clarifying that unknown in my mind. Now I can concentrate on more important things like fishing
1416806,Mike Kansas,2012-04-05 12:05:00,1463,Only had them checked one time and that was coming back into the states. I asked the Border Guard why out of curiosity and he said that there had been incidents of people bringing booze across that was bought in Canada. That was back when our USA $1 was $1.40 in Canada which made the booze cheap. Mike Kansas

1418259,JinxCanada,2012-04-09 05:56:00,1306,Sadly booze is NEVER cheap here in Canada. at $13.00 bottle of Jim Beam sells here for $37.00
