1417867,campchick,2012-04-08 05:57:00,96,Thank you everyone. I now have a solid list of worthy reels. Cabela's here I come.
1418790,Nosebleed,2012-04-09 22:07:00,253,"Go Abu. I have a revo SX that's my fave. I also have a premiere and an stx hs. The sx in the 6.4 ratio is my favorite. looking to get a toro HS for my pike rig soon. I have a pfluger patriarch that's really cool looking but not quite as good as the revo's in function. Shimano's are good but there a step behind abu in they're braking systems and overall smoothness. Calcutta's are great, but I'd go low-profile. Don't forget you can get a hoodie sweatshirt free from abu too. I have 2 and they're reall quite nice. Emroidered on both sides. Love em. FYI they run small, I got a 2xl and it's a good fit (I'm 6'-3"" 180lbs)$30 rebate plus a hoodie? that's practacly free!"
1419982,Larry Mac,2012-04-12 07:08:00,530,"Hi Campchick, I too am a big fan of ABU casting reels. We have used them in very tough Canadian Wilderness conditions for years without incident. Many of mine are 10 to 15 years old and just keep on working. IMHO they are very well made reels. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1420122,campchick,2012-04-12 12:06:00,96,Thanks for all the replies. I will be shopping in a couple of weeks and will take a look at all the excellent suggestions. I'll post when I decide. Thanks again.

1417301,BenBeattie,2012-04-06 13:20:00,232,For a low profile reel it's hard to beat a shimano Curado for the price. I think I have 3 of them... love them all.
1417309,nitroman,2012-04-06 13:47:00,368,ABU Revo SX is my all time favorite!
1417484,Pooch,2012-04-07 00:39:00,4619,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=193701Shimanos are hard to beat, but there are more good choices available now than ever.Pooch"
1417499,campchick,2012-04-07 06:10:00,96,Thank you! I will check all of these out.
1417504,wallydave,2012-04-07 06:20:00,2151,Like you I am new to the baitcaster world. I'm taking a couple of baitcaster rigs for this years trip to Lac Seul. One for pike and one for jiggin and worm harness fishing for walleye. Baitcasters can be a challenge. I have found some good You Tubes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44czbkzILSA check out some of others. Good luck!
1417696,rnnonmt,2012-04-07 15:32:00,992,"Kind of fond of the Abu Garcia reels. I have a Ambassadeur lite plus that is atleast 20 years old that I use for jigging walleye. Recently picked up a Black Max $49-$59 range a couple years ago but I continue to use the ""ole favorite."" Last week bought a Revo STX $199 with a $30 mail in rebate. The Revo S, ST, STX all have a mail in rebate right now. Haven't had the Revo on the water yet but I've been pounding the front yard landscape with it. Brian"
1417756,weedsnager,2012-04-07 18:40:00,252,for the money your not gonna beat a carbonlite from basspro
1417765,Yellow Fever,2012-04-07 19:13:00,1809,Hello...been using the Revo SX for a couple of years. I have 7 of them so....i spool them with 30lb suffix 832. And yes they do have a rebate on right now but it ends soon so hurry.
1417816,Neb_ProV,2012-04-07 21:10:00,22,"There are many great baitcasters out there and I own many expensive one. The best ones I have are defiantly the Daiwa Steez, Shimano Core 50 and Aldebaron. Those reels are lightweight and cast like a dream."
