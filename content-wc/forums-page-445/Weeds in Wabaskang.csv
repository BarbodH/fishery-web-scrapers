1414762,Kevin R,2012-04-01 11:20:00,305,I wonder if anyone remembers how many & thick the weeds were in Wabaskang 30 years ago ? Why do the weeds keep getting thinner with each new season ?

I'm not familiar with that body of water, but here's my guesses: Waters can become more ""stained"", for want of a better word, thus limiting the amount of sunlight, which tends to reduce deeper weed growth. The introduction of undesirable invasive crawfish (I believe they are called rusty crawfish) can cause a slowdown in weed growth, I'm told, because they supposedly eat the weeds. A change, or several changes over the years, in water level may cause a less than normal crop. Bill"

1416757,Kevin R,2012-04-05 10:24:00,305,The water has gotten more stained. It was a very clear lake in the early 1970's. Runoff from a variety of sources could be why. It seams all the lakes in that system have become more stained. 2010 high water from all the rain. Last year the water was clearer not much rain for runoff helped. The weeds could be thick this season.
