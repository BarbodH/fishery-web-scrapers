1419845,hommer23,2012-04-11 19:16:00,523,"I use drakes batter and eggs. slice your onion and lay them on a paper towel. Mix your drakes batter with beer and sone garlic powder/salt to a thick mixture (like cake batter or thicker) then crack an egg in another bowl and whip up. Take the oinion and either dip in the egg first or brush on, then dip the onion in the batter. In deep fryer drop in at 350 to 375 until they float up, in a pan heat the oil to 350 to 375 about 2 to 3 inches you will have to flip over if they are laying on the bottom of the pan. The egg helps the batter stick to the onion the beer will not get you drunk (in the batter) you will have to play with the thickness of the batter until you find one that works."
1419915,Mark R,2012-04-11 21:25:00,1538,We have always used Don's Chuckwagon Onion Ring Mix. We use beer to mix it with an it works great. We usually use 2 or 3 three onions per box of the mix.

1419980,Juls,2012-04-12 07:04:00,13414,"I like ""Haystack"" onion rings and just keep it simple, so the taste of the SWEET onions comes through.Slice a very large SWEET onion into thin rings (1/8 inch thick) and break the rings apart. One large onion per two people.In a mixing bowl mix:Whip 2 egg whites till frothy and add 1 cup heavy cream..mix well.Flour the onion rings in plain flour...just to dust them and give the egg wash something to stick to.Add the onions to the wet mix and coat well.Take a handful of wet rings and shake a few times, to drain, before adding to the following dry mix in a large Gallon sized Zip-Loc:Flour with salt and pepper to taste. (easy, eh?)Shake the rings in the bag until the rings are coated, then remove and shake excess flour mixture off......then drop in hot Peanut Oil till golden brown.Remove and drain on paper towels to absorb the oil. Add more salt if you like. Sweet and salt are a perfect combo.They are light and crispy.You won't be able to stop eating them............enjoy!Juls"
1419991,Paul H,2012-04-12 07:31:00,1232,"Coat with flour (add seasoning, salt etc, then egg , then whatever batter or dry mix you want. I use a pancake mix, seasoned similar to the Roach style and use it dry, not as a batter, if you want a little thicker let it set some after you roll in the dry mix and when it gets wet from the egg do it again. Use the same for fish or whatever. I've found a seasoning mix similar to Emeril Lagasse's famous works well. Formula is all over the internet. I mix without salt and will add turmeric too it especially for fish. You can coat as above with any batter, the flour - egg coat helps it stick."
1420020,SSH,2012-04-12 08:31:00,526,"I have used FryCrisp and Don's Chuckwagon Onion or FishnChips mix. The key for me is to not use a basket and make sure the batter is thin enough. I make the batter much thinner than pancake mix because I am not a fan of thick batter. You tend to get that when you order onion rings at the restaurant. 1) Cut and put onion rings in a Ziplock bag to keep them from drying out. 2) Use another ziplock bag for the dry coating ingredient. I use either the batter mix or Krusteaz wheat pancake mix for the dry ingredient. 3) Place a batch of the rings in dry-coating ziplock bag and shake to coat all the rings. 4) Then, place the coated rings in the batter, cover them with the batter and place them in the deep fryer at 350 degrees. 5) I add a little water after each batch if needed to keep the batter for getting to thick from the added dry coating the comes off the dry coated rings. P.S. You can use beer/water/milk for the liquid in the batter. You can add more seasonings if desired."
1420071,Richard B,2012-04-12 09:52:00,735,1) Dip in Flour 2) Dip in Egg wash 3) Coat with mixture of Corn meal/pancake mix 4) Fry in peanut oil to a golden brown The corn meal adds an extra crunch/texture to the onion rings. Ziplocks work great when coating in the dry ingredients.
