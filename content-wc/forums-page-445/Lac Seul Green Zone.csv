1417825,Sutsgold,2012-04-07 21:28:00,219,We are considering camping this summer. The mnr website is fuzzy on its area where camping is allowed and restricted. I believe it is called the green zone. Does anyone know if islands on lac seul fall under that classification? We are definetly looking for an island to camp on and do not want to travel as far west from dryden as lotw. Thanks for any info.
1417836,JDP,2012-04-07 22:32:00,1457,The only people i have seen camping on Lac Seul islands have been working for the Ontario MNR. I don't believe non-residents can camp on Lac Seul. I'll check the Internet in a few places for the facts....
1417838,JDP,2012-04-07 22:46:00,1457,I see what you mean....to be absolutely sure you get the best information call the Ontario MNR at one or both of these Offices:MNR District OfficesDryden 1-807-223-3341Sioux Lookout 1-807-737-1140I will be surprised if you find that non-residents can camp on Crown Landon Lac Seul.Good Luck!
