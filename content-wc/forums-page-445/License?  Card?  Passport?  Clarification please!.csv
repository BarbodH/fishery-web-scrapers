I already have the passport ""book"" so I'm good there...I also know I'll need a fishing license. Most likely a seasonal, non-resident if it's still offered.What else do I need to be able to fish in Canada and take a full limit where legal?Will I need one of those boater's cards to run my own boat?What of those Outdoor cards? What's the story there?Lastly... How long is one allowed to stay in Canada without applying for a visa or something like that? I'm planning a bit of a driving tour around Ontario."

1418260,JinxCanada,2012-04-09 05:58:00,1306,"Let me help. First, you do not require a boaters licence here as you are a non-resident. Second, you are allowed to stay up to 6 months without any documentation from Immigration. That being said, your stay CAN be limited to a lesser time by any officer if they so choose...but the norm is 6 months.You will need an Ontario fishing licence. I hope that helps."
