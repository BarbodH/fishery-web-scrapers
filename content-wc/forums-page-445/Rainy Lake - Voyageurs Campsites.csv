It is important to my wife and daughters that we be on an island and that it have a sand beach with swimming. I started to look at rainy and there are plenty of campsites on the U.S. side, but the makeup of each site is open. Does anyone have any information they could pass along that would meet the family's requirements? Pics would also be great if you could share."
