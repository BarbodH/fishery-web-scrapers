1408627,Guest,2012-03-18 19:54:00,0,"Thanks. Any recommendations on jig colors or lures for trolling? Also, does anyone have any info on the bear hunting at OSullivan?"
1408935,Jiggin_Rob,2012-03-19 16:43:00,26,"Mondo was absolutly correct...for walleyes, troll with rigs and harnesses untill they hit, then throw an arsenal of jigs at them.. I have always started with the basic colors.. chartuse, yellow, orange, during the day... white at dusk or later.. Can't go wrong with the classic thunderstick for pike, we have had great success with them over the years..see you on the way down we are going up the 16thTight linesRob"
1419641,Guest,2012-04-11 11:28:00,0,On the same Clova road you use for O'Sullivan turn left at Pensive for 13 km and you will be at Domaine Shannon. Been going there every year since 1990 and never any problems along with great fishing.
1391992,mkress45,2012-02-09 15:42:00,16,"we are heading up to o'sullivan lake june 12 to 21; we were up there last year& did not do so good it was full moon so we will try it again, I would like to know if anybody ever was back to armentier lake if so how was it & how did you get there. when we were there it was the first week of july, we also will be taken our own boats if anybody could tell us about the fishin it would be greatly app. thank you mel."
1392029,GP-NJ,2012-02-09 16:53:00,156,"Armentier is a trophy lake and all trips are guided by the camp guide- guests can't go alone. The rates for the trip for the day are very reasonable, check with Russ. There are some huge Northerns in that lake. You can go to Lac Clatouche on your own. It' located on the north end up the river & access is easier during your trip because water level is typically higher earlier in the year. Very little fishing pressure. Check with Russ for fishing & tackle recommendations."
1392118,bryand,2012-02-09 19:59:00,6,"We have had very good luck at berthelot, ceasars north and air tamerac. Ceasars and air Tamarac are flyins. Going with air Tamarac to gouin reservoir again this year."
1393846,mkress45,2012-02-13 14:53:00,16,"thank you GP-NJ. for the info, on armentier lake, is there a lot of walleye;s in lake armentier , we as a group release all that we catch except for frying there. we are from Allentown, pa. & I take it you are from N-J. this will be our 46 yr. going to canada, we mainely fish for eye,s, so if you can give us any pointers on lake osullivan it would be greatly app. thank you Mel."
1394002,GP-NJ,2012-02-13 19:39:00,156,"This is a trophy lake that is seldom fished. We fish for walleyes. I personally have not fished there because we always have had success in the main lake with numbers and size so we never found the desire to go to Armentier. I have caught several walleyes 28"" and over in the main lake. I have seen the pictures from others who have fished Armentier- Trophy walleyes & northerns are there. I have been going to O'Sullivan Lake since 1997 and most years multiple trips per year. This June we are there 6/16-23 so we should see you in camp. Also going 1 week in July and 2 weeks end of July and into August. Typical walleye fishing patterns all work at this lake. PM your email and I could provide particular presentations used. Russ & his guide Larry (Chummy) also very willing to provide fishing tips. They will be at the Monroeville, PA show next week (Pittsburgh)."
1394229,mkress45,2012-02-14 10:51:00,16,"thanks for the info GP-NJ. my e-mail is [email protected] hope to hear from you & will be looking to see you at osullivan, thanks mel."
1398929,3dfishguy,2012-02-25 07:30:00,6,"going to lake o'sullivan june 23 to 30, its later than i've been before by about two weeks, always a new experience, great lake. if anyone is going in before that time , i'd appreciate a fishing report,,,,i'll post mine on our return."
1406654,Jiggin_Rob,2012-03-13 19:01:00,26,"Oh Yea, what a gorgeous day It has been. Can you beleive March 13th and it feels like May! thought about nothing else but walleye fishing today while working. Yes Andy we will be heading up the week of the 16th. and hoping that the weather will not be so hot at that time. if all goes well I will have a party of five going. My Son Ryan and I have been fishing sully since 1987 and have a decent perspective on how to fish her, but every time we go we uncover a new location that impresses me. I guess that lake is always full of suprises. This year I am excited to be bringing a Minnesota native who has serious fishing knowledge and skills. am looking forward to his ideas on main lake structures and patterns, so as to catch larger fish on a regular basis. Andy Im not sure, But did we not meet at the Edison sportsman show this past January? Sorry not good with names. Tight lines everyonesee you on the lake."
1408593,dkuosman,2012-03-18 18:38:00,1,We are heading to OSullivan Lake the first week of June this year. Would anyone be able to provide some tips on techniques they recommend for walleyes and pike? This will be our first trip to this lake.ThanksDan
1408611,Mondo_)H,2012-03-18 19:21:00,91,"troll until you find them, then jig"
553917,Guest,2006-01-19 23:50:00,0,"Alright, I'm sitting here in January dreaming of fishing Lake O'Sullivan in Quebec six months from now. We head up June 10 to 17 this year and every year (for the last ten straight) we've loved the Lodge and the fishing which has been great. Good pike and trout too. Who else is going up this year? Is it a return trip? If so what's the hot spot and what worked before? I'll trade ya... Let's get some talk going..."
553924,Guest,2006-01-20 14:55:00,0,"we're going up june 17 - 24 and can't wait. we are mainly fishing for perch but like smallmouth as well. couple questions, is the lake water potable and do the wardens ever visit the area?"
553973,Guest,2006-01-22 21:42:00,0,"If you are interested in catching smallmouth or perch, I think we are talking about two different lakes: O'Sullivan Lake in Quebec is 200 miles due north (as the loon flies) from Ottawa and is great for walleye, pike and lakers but has no bass and few, if any, perch. I think it is too far north for bass. As for Wardens, yes they do show up and did so last year in the middle of nowhere, but I think that's rare. The lake is about 75 miles down the Clova Road, bouncy, gravel etc. Are you going to the O'Sullivan I'm referring too? Andy"
1278662,Guest,2011-03-06 08:19:00,0,"For those who have been to O'Sullivan before, does anyone know what are the native bait fish to this lake?? Trying to decide what type of tackle I will need to catch Lake Trout and Pike. If there are not much Perch (as written above), what are some of the native fish a Pike will strike (walleye?)."
1278739,Mike Borger,2011-03-06 12:33:00,1554,Whitefish and gigantic Fallfish.
1278924,trapperbob,2011-03-06 21:27:00,45,"We are a group of 4 going to osullivan for the first time. We will be there June 18-25. We have fished several other lakes over thw years,but we like to try new places.Last year we were at Gouin res. thru Tamarac. We have heard good things about this lake and hope they are true. I have been looking at a topographic map and noticed alot of drop offs islands and points. I and the group are mostly catch and release and hope to catch some nice sized walleyes. We willalso target some lakers probably trolling. Any info would be greatly appreciated as to good areas to try."
1281395,Guest,2011-03-12 08:30:00,0,Thanks Solopaddler for the response about the native bait fish.
1325350,bryand,2011-07-02 19:43:00,6,"Had a bad experience at O'Sullivan this season. Turns out that the outfitter charges you for a prop if it is in any way scratched...which is hard not to do in lake full of unmarked rocks. Regardless, when we checked out, we were assessed 60 for our prop...not bent or damaged, just scratched up. We insisted that if pay $60, we want the prop. Russell gave it to us and when we looked at it closer later, it showed signs of earlier scratches and damage that were painted over beofre we got that boat and engine. So apparently the outfitter charges customers for a prop, and then repaints it and does the same thing to the next folks. A disgusting way to nickle and dime customers. The accommodations and boats were mediocre and the fishing was average at best. So no way we will be going back there. There are too many other outfitters who don't angle to screw their American customers."
1390724,3dfishguy,2012-02-06 18:49:00,6,"wondering what other outfitters your are pleased with in that area, looking for a change"
1390731,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-06 18:56:00,725,"Most outfitters are not like that, but we have had that happen with an outfitter in Minnesota. the good thing about that is we have been going to Canada since then and would not even think about wasting our precious fishing week in Canada. In Canada, we have been charged for a prop once, which we indeed chipped and a lower unit, which we banged"
