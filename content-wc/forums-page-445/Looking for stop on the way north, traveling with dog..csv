We know the hotels that allow dogs, but we are wanting to fish two or three days at either lake vermillion, pelican or Kabetogama something like that area. Our lab mix is extremely quiet and we take care of his ""mess"" like we should. So we are looking for a bed and breakfast or a lodge that allows dogs. And I'm not familiar with northern minnesota lakes for good walleye, so this is the only place to look for sound advice on such maters as this one. Thank you in advance for they help!"

I have fished Vermilion many times and the walleye fishing there is a slow bite and you really have to work for them. It has been stocked with Muskies, so many people are fishing them now and say that the Walleye fishing has greatly decreased due to this. Pelican is more known for Pan fish (crappie, sunny, bass) and walleye fishing there is tough, from what I have been told, but I have not fished it. Kabetogama has walleyes, but I haven't fished it for many years. Rainey Lake has walleyes and I have fished it many times. It is a very large lake and you have to know where to go and how they are biting and work hard for them. Vermilion, Rainy & Kabetogama lakes are very beautiful. Vermilion is somewhat populated with homes/cabins. It would probably be best to hire a guide the first day you fish to put you on the ""hot"" walleye spots and bite. Hope these sites are helpful to you in finding a place to stay that will allow a dog and fishing some of Northern MN beautiful lakes. GOOD LUCK! RBF"
