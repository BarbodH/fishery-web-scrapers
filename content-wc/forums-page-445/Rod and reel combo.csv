1416701,J Arendt,2012-04-05 08:04:00,45,Looking for some suggestions on rod and reel combo for shallow running crankbaits. Thanks for your help
1416931,keek,2012-04-05 16:54:00,1003,A good combo for the money would be a 7' medium Amp rod paired with a Shimano Sienna reel. Load with 10lb power pro super slick 8. $80 package including the line.

If you are mainly casting I would suggest a higher speed reel with a 6:1 gear ratio. That reel would allow you a wider range in retrieval presentation speed of the crankbait. If trolling the gear ratio is not as critical. Also check the number of ball bearings in the reel, the higher the number the better. I recently bought some 6 ball bearing spinning reels at very modest prices that are smooth and generally nice performers."
