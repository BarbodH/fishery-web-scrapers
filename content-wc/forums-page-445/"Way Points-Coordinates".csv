1418256,Larry Mac,2012-04-09 05:47:00,530,"So many times when I fish a new camp or lake I receive from the owner a map with a few small X's on an 8 1/2"" X 11"" paper representing a 27 Mile long lake marking ""Productive Spots"". My question is how many of you receive a list of actual GPS Coordinates from their camp owners when you arrive? The Coordinates may reference reefs, underwater islands, structure, shore lunch spots and of course fishing spots. I have yet to receive that type of information. Of course the maps and information we do receive along with our general knowledge of Canadian Fishing has been very helpful and appreciated. Thank you in advance and have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1418840,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-10 06:08:00,235,"Have only done fly in lakes which are equipped with very basic boats and our portable depth finders. The fishing is good enough that you can be a bit general with advice. To me there is a bit of the lost magic of fishing when you stumble on a mid lake hump on accident. Having everything mapped out for you takes away the thrill of the hunt a little bit. But I see the value of GPS coordinates on a very large system, and I'm sure many fishem would appreciate getting that info and it would reflect well on the lodge owner for referrals and repeat business."
1418903,Pooch,2012-04-10 07:25:00,4619,"The previous owner of one camp we fished listed coordinates for some ""spots"". Never saw anyone fishing them though. Many of his ""spots"" were little honey holes that we had found years ago before gps. Until then I thought I was the only one who knew about them and was appalled that he published ""my secret little spots"", but elated that no one tried to locate them and fish his recommendations.Finding one's own ""spots"" makes fishing fish'n and not just catch'n.A heads up on water hazards for new folks is much appreciated by everyone.Learning to ""hunt"" fish is rewarding. Using a lower unit to find a rock isn't.Pooch"
1418969,JDP,2012-04-10 08:43:00,1457,"Ron Hunter, who owned a resort on Winnine in northern Minnesotagot in my boat and saved a few spots on my Lowrance gps about 9 years ago.Most of the time when lodge owners mark maps for first time anglersthe spots are traditional locations for fish. Thus they know landmarks on shore, etc to help anglers get in the correct location."
1419050,Larry Mac,2012-04-10 10:47:00,530,"Hi guys, thank you for the responses. I have been fishing remote Canadian Wilderness Lakes for many years and have never brought or used a GPS. I do see some advantages when fishing larger water as to marking your cabin i.e to help get back in fog or bad weather. We still use a compass if needed. I agree there is satisfaction in finding the fish. I have found over the years that learning the habits and life cycles of the quarry you are after seems to work best for us when locating the fish. We have been fortunate in being able to locate our fish pretty regularly. I do feel bad if I see a father/son or family group make their one and only trip to the great north and do not have the experience that many of our members have and struggle to find and catch fish. I think it would be a help to them for both locating areas and getting back to camp (if they have a GPS). I have taken several family groups from camp out fishing with us over the years and the excitement on their faces when successfully catching walleye is priceless. Thank you againLarry Mac"
1419219,JDP,2012-04-10 16:02:00,1457,I agree the GPS on Canadian lakes can as much of a safetypiece of equipment as a fishing tool. I have seen more than one group of people stay overnight on an island on Lac Seul because they were lost as it was getting dark. I also have people drive their boats up for directions many times. With a GPS these situations most likely would not occur.
1419549,dog2,2012-04-11 08:29:00,198,"Always got a map marked with the x's. used it for the newbys so they had starting points. Backin the 70's lucky to get a map so we learned to troll with Buck spoons to find sumbmerged reefs. Now you can go to the gov't map service and buy maps of most lakes. With the advent of GPS we are now able to look at the map and pin point the areas we fish and if productive hit the gps screen and then mark it on the map also. The major use of our gps units are for saf ety .We try to do a combo moose hunt fishing trip in sept. and we are often at the wrong end of the lake or river at dusk ,since we have previously marked a safe run course we can go back to this route and avoid the reefs and rock schoals.On our fly in trips we use it alot saves time in the am if its dark u can work your way safely thru the rocks to get on stand before light . Only takes a sec to hit mark and note rock or fish. then at the end of the week at change over you can share with the inbound crew ."
1420125,Kevin R,2012-04-12 12:10:00,305,"I think a funny thing happened to me last season on a lake that I had not fished before. I was catching pretty good but a friend handed me his secret gps numbers, I plugged them in my gps but never had a chance to use them, on the last day I thought I would just see if I could look them over I checked about five of them out & each one was a spot I had already fished very close to & entered in my gps as a new way point. Now this was on a very large lake it just goes to show you how fast people can find good fishing spots without ever fishing a lake before. Back in the 1970's we had little boats & low hp motors finding fish was easy because the lakes were full of them. Now we have catch & release to protect the waters but even with that some lakes have gotten much tougher to fish. If we didn't have the equipment of today it would be harder to find spots, but if you know how to use the tools it is easy."
