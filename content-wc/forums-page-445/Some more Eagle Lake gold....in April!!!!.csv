My buddy came along...we got a limit, a few swapped up and not as big as the other day but fish for supper...cant be beat.Another good thing is my I-pilot arrived and it worked seamlessly! Locking on the spot and just fishing is amazing, i still dont trust it even though it held us withing inches of our spot all afternoon. All this effortless fishing will take a little while to adjust to.I now have the lock spot function figured out and am getting to like the Advanced auto-pilot feature (auto-pilot with GPS assist). We had fun saving a lock spot...moving a few hundred yards away then making the boat find it...cool. Next time out i am gonna familiarise myself with recording tracks....will be awesome on a few weedlines i know when the weeds arrive.TODAY'S VIDEOhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/nAT9yPUgc44IF YOU HAVE A MINN_KOTA.......GET AN I-PILOThttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1369.jpgGOT SUPPERhttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...IMG_1373-1.jpg"

What are we gonna do then? haha, we've truly been spoiled this year. Awesome to hear the I-pilot works good, sounds like it will help you catch more fish this year (which kinda sounds funny) thanks for the report"

1417796,Limeyangler,2012-04-07 20:13:00,563,"Online ...Ebay, not much cheaper than cabelas.....but i'm tired of Canadian stuff costing way more just cuz we will pay it...saved about 20 bucks in the end. Means i will have to go direct through Minkota for the warranty thoiugh."
