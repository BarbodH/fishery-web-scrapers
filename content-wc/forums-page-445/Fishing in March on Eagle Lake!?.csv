Nothing big but a respectable stringer of 17 inchers(all males)Even managed to `drill`a couple of holes in a passing ice sheet with our paddle.15-18`FOW was where they were at today....jig and minnow the weapon of choice. Straight jigging, with short ,sharp snaps triggering the bite.****...felt good feeling that tell tale 'THUNK' of a walleye bite!http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1333.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1341.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1356.jpgVIDEO FROM SATURDAYhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwza...feature=relmfuTHE NEXT BEST THING TO CATCHING IS.............http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G16-HzXKGnoYUM!http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1359.jpg"

1416629,Limeyangler,2012-04-05 05:31:00,563,Very low.Where i launched yesterday at Osbourne Bay landing there was a spit of land extending out 15' from where i launch that i have never seen there before.
