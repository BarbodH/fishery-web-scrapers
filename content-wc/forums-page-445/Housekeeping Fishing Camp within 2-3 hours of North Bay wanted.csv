1399879,villain189,2012-02-27 11:55:00,33,Haha...funny you say that because that's exactly the place we've decided on after lots of research. Booked our trip to Ellen Island Camp for the end of August with a group of 8 guys and can't wait!!Some of the other camps mentioned were nice but were either further away or more expensive. And like you said the cabins look fantastic..rebuilt in 2005. We used to go to Mitchell's Camp on Evelyn and always did pretty good fishing but it just got too rustic for us...been about 25 years since our group has been up to Evelyn so looking forward to getting back!
1400141,fourize,2012-02-28 09:04:00,287,"Try Lost Lake Willderness Lodge http://www.lostlakelodge.com/ which is 8 miles from Gowganda. They are under new management, and have really made alot of needed improvements. To be honest, I haven't been there since the new owners took over last year...had been going for 18 years straight prior. Talked to the new owners at Harrisburg show, and they told me they are putting new motors on all the outpost boats this year, which was very much needed. Send me a pm and I could give you more details."

1355562,villain189,2011-10-05 18:53:00,33,"Hi, We've based out of Western New York and looking for any suggestions for a good place within a 7-8 hour drive for us. Housekeeping cabin with good fishing (Walleye, Northern Pike)...boats on back lakes would be a bonus. Place on the lower end of the price range would be ideal too..we're spoiled and used to paying about $500CAD PP including boat/motors/cabin. Would like to keep it around $500-550 per person. We used to go to Lady Evelyn awhile back and we've recently been going to the Gowganda area. Looking at changing it up. We usually go towards the end of August and like to fish for walleye, Northern Pike and Smallmouth. Would really like to find a place where we can find some good size & quantity of pike during the daytime. Prefer to fish smaller lakes or systems that are fishable in winds in 14ft boats since we rent boats/motors from the camp. Temiskaming looks like an interesting option....anyone have any lake/camp reccomendations here?thanks"

1355656,ohiojmj,2011-10-06 07:21:00,1262,"I've been to Lac Remigny in Quebec five times and thought it was a great pike fishery and the walleye/smallmouth was decent. Stayed at Camps Ronoda on Lac Remigny and also launched on Lac Des Quinze. The camp got a new owner a few years ago and I haven't been back. There's a second camp on lake as well as few cottages here and there.I've enjoyed a couple trips to Lake Mistinikon (Horseshoe Island Camp, but heard of decent fishing in Lake Matachewan and the Montreal River in that area. Mistinikon has very few cottages and 2 fish camps."
1355674,jdoaks,2011-10-06 08:49:00,89,resevoir decceles camp denis should be close to your price range.big place but broke up enough winds no problem
1355676,villain189,2011-10-06 08:54:00,33,Thanks for the recommendations. We actually went to Horseshoe Island in Mistinikon about 25 years ago. Don't remember too much about it but I remember catching a few big pike and the cabin was nice. Our group generally prefers smaller lakes like that. Lady Evelyn is the biggest body of water we've fished on any of our trips.
1355692,adempsey,2011-10-06 09:47:00,963,"Personally, I think it's hard to beat Lady Evelyn for a drive-to/boat-in destination in that area.The Air Ivanhoe Boat-In camps might be worth a look.Red Pine has some too, but I'd go with Ivanhoe first.Although, perhaps Ivanhoe is a further drive than I remember....and you are almost to Chapleau which opens up a lot more opportunities.Others worth looking at:Ray's Camp on Ramsey LakeGreen Wilderness Lodge on Lake Mattagami. There are a couple other lodges on this lake as well.Horwood Lake Lodge and Horwood Outpost on Horwood Lake. Don't forget about Quebec either. A lot of options there as well and it might be a closer drive, or a similar drive to a more remote location."
1357032,Guest,2011-10-12 07:05:00,0,"I grew up in the North Bay area and have since had the opportunity to move around the Province of Ontario. I ultimately landed in the Northwest. I would NEVER consider going back to northeastern Ontario to fish for walleye or pike. Any of the users of this site who are objective and have had the opportunity to fish around the province would agree. Spend an extra day and drive at least as far west as Geralton but preferrably to the areas west of Thunder Bay. There are areas in the northwest with drive-to fisheries that will blow you away. Warmer climate, more productive water, far more lakes and fewer people. 100 fish days are for real. The area around Sioux Lookout and Ignace would be a good starting point. On one of my first outings in the area my friend suggested that we take 10 dozen minnows with us for a day-trip for walleye. We were out of bait by lunch! Many of the lakes and operators in this area have been thoroughly reviewed on this site. The drive may seem too long but I would suggest that it is better to spend an extra day of driving on either side of your trip than to spend a whole week wondering if you are going to get enough fish for a meal."
1357043,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-12 07:32:00,1460,"Nw fan, I completely agree with your assessment of Villian 189 predicament. Just a few more hours West. I would recommend Forrest Lodge on Caribou. Economical drive-in camp on a world class fishery lake.NW fan, I noticed that you are signed in as a guest. Seems to me, that you have a lot to offer on this board."
1357355,mroyle,2011-10-13 06:27:00,74,"I have fished all over Ontario, Quebec, & Manitoba. Although I generally agree with heading West to fish, there are some fantastic Walleye lakes within a few hours of North Bay. Just this past August my son & I were pressed for time so spent 4 1/2 days fishing Club Trout Lake in Quebec. We caught just shy of 500 walleyes in that time with the largest at 27.5. Will be happy to provide more info if you'd like."
1399847,Nanuk,2012-02-27 10:34:00,6,"Hi, I have fished a few places in the northeast, biggest bang for your buck and nice accomodations is the newly renovated Ellen Island Camp, very reasonable."
