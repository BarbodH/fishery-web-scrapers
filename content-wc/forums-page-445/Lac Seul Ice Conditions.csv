1418755,TroyMansfield,2012-04-09 20:51:00,92,"it is definitley still melting around here, most of Abram Lake is ice off, Pelican Lake too and most lakes in the area are within a few days of the ice coming off. We are experiencing some cold night temps but highs in the 50 degree range with some strong winds, wont be long now"
1415533,NEpiker,2012-04-02 21:07:00,9,Anyone know the state of the ice in the central part of Lac Seul around Mahkwa Lodge? We will be fishing out of Mahkwa the first full week of June. We focus on pike fishing. Is it likely that the water temperature will be abnormally warm and therefore the pike may have already moved out of the shallows?
1415578,BenBeattie,2012-04-02 23:43:00,232,The ice should be gone within a week. Trying to predict water temperatures for 2 months in the future is a guessing game at best. The only predictable thing about the weather here in NW Ontario is that it's unpredictable! You'd be a lot better off to ask this question a week before your trip.
1415690,tv4fish,2012-04-03 08:00:00,2694,"Ben --- Ontario's weather is not like Minnesota's then. Here -- if you don't like the weather --- just wait 5 minutes, it will change."
1415789,Guest,2012-04-03 10:27:00,0,The ice is out in the part of the lake near Ear Falls
1416334,Guest,2012-04-04 11:42:00,0,"Going to Evergree lodge 3rd week of June, will this significantly change our ""normal spots"" Will we have to go deeper? Thanks"
1416361,wallydave,2012-04-04 12:27:00,2151,"Between the seemingly early ice out and the ""summer pattern"" the walleyes are usually deeper, around weed beds this time of year. We will fishing out of Goose Bay Camp the week of Fathers Day, not to far from your lodge. Check with the operators and wait for some more replies, but generally the early season spots are quieter later in the season. I have fished this area in late May early June and late June the fish are there, its just a matter of finding them. Good luck!"
1416390,mr ducks,2012-04-04 13:40:00,1459,Hey Ben!! Great to see you are posting on WC. Great site and with your knowledge and insight you will offer a lot to the site!
1416441,dynamite,2012-04-04 15:58:00,20,We will be in cabin 12 that week for the 14th year. See you there. Dynamite
1416442,BenBeattie,2012-04-04 15:58:00,232,"Hey Ron! I'll send ya an email.AVS - again, the 3rd week in june is a long way off. With the early ice out, yes theoretically patterns you would 'normally' fish in 3rd week june might be less productive. But, who knows what the weather will do, how fast the water will heat up, etc. between now and then. So I won't say yes, everything will be different all season and you'll be fishing deeper then normal on your trip. Ask a week before you come up and then you'll get a better sense of what to expect."
1418655,rnnonmt,2012-04-09 17:56:00,992,Any updates in the last day or so? Last post was 5 days ago. Still warming up and melting I take it? Brian
