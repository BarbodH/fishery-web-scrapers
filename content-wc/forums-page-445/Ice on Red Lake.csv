1417952,stevensinks,2012-04-08 09:10:00,330,Thanks for the report. We are really looking forward to gettting back to Red Lake and Bow Narrows. How is the new motel comming along? Any word on when they will open?
1418717,Enid Elizabeth,2012-04-09 19:38:00,59,The new hotel (Super 8) does not look ready at all but they are having a job fair hoping to hire people. You better call Rob at the Norseman Inn soon if you need a room. 807-727-2858 (I think)
1417384,Enid Elizabeth,2012-04-06 17:55:00,59,Looks like it will be the earliest breakup ever around here. We've got the boat in the water and getting the planes ready to fly
1417446,Enid Elizabeth,2012-04-06 20:36:00,59,Some guys have been fishing by boat already. They have been on the Berens. Crazy early!
1417450,Enid Elizabeth,2012-04-06 20:46:00,59,"Flat Lake, just west of Red Lake, April 2, 2012. Just 2 inches or so of ice. Got the quad off the ice as the sun came out. Now on April 6, the lake is clear of ice."
1417505,Golden Eagle,2012-04-07 06:21:00,2642,Thanks for keeping us posted. I check your blog 4 or 5 times a week. Every week.

1417606,Moondog,2012-04-07 09:50:00,362,"Tackleman is the guy to ask that question to. Hey, Tackleman........pull any of those monster northern out of the Bug yet?"
1417735,Guest,2012-04-07 17:29:00,0,"not yet, just got home from a week away and haven't even unpacked the truck yet. the ice on gullrock is very black and there are large patches of open water, but i haven't been down to the dock to see how thick the ice is around it."
1417918,Moondog,2012-04-08 07:45:00,362,"What is the water level? And dut, duh, da da!!! The final jeopardy question..........how do you NOT catch a walleye before the opener while fishing for northern?? We are planning on getting there a few days before the opener to fish northern and wonder how that works out. I can imagine a walleye biting on almost everything I would throw at a sewer trout."
1417926,Enid Elizabeth,2012-04-08 07:57:00,59,"Brett Geary was up and looking around, April 7. East Bay and around Chukuni is open on Red Lake. Little Vermillion is black and ice could be gone with a good wind."
1417940,Golden Eagle,2012-04-08 08:45:00,2642,"I hit Little Vermilion May 13 last year, for a 15 day stay. It was the first time I didn't pick up a walleye on big baits before the season. Usually they eat my 1 1/8 oz JSM and even a Suick sometimes. Later I found out they had spawned early and moved to deeper water before I arrived."
