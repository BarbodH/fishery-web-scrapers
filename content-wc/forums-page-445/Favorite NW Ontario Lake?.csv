1419843,TIGHTLINER,2012-04-11 19:12:00,223,IT IS A TOSS UP FOR ME MELCHETT LAKE OR EDDIES NORTH BETEAU LAKE. I COULD TOSS BOTH NAMES IN A HAT AND BE HAPPY WITH WHAT EVER ONE COMES OUT. BOTH ARE GREAT LAKES...
1420080,Larry Mac,2012-04-12 10:15:00,530,"Hi Tightliner, I must say you made my head turn when you said it was a toss up between Melchett and Eddie's North. I have not been fortunate to fish either lake yet. Onetimedave has been extremely helpful in providing information and reports about Melchett. The reports about Eddie's North also speak for themselves. I must start paying more attention to Melchett (wow). Thank you for your opinion. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac."

1413764,NARDA 1,2012-03-29 21:17:00,636,That would have to be Eagle Lake. I've been going there yearly since 1988. The fishing is great. The lodge is great and the people I've met have been AWSOME. What more could you want. I even met myself up there a few years ago. Ran into a guy who has the same name as me (same middle name but spells it different) he has an uncle who has the same name as my son and his sisters name is the same as my wife. How weird is that???
1413783,Nimstug,2012-03-29 22:09:00,2605,Northwest Arm of Rainy Lake. We're going in mid-September so I'm not even thinking about how many days. Nimstug.....it's 170.
1413853,stillangling,2012-03-30 06:37:00,149,"Hands down, no contest. Best musky water anywhere, bar none. Good chance at a 15"" crappie, 14"" perch, 30"" walleye, 35+"" lake trout and I guess I shouldn't forget the largemouth and smallmouth for those inflicted with that disease. Better yet, you don't have to be in the boonies to experience it all. It is hard to believe how much water is out there until you try to fish it all. You could spend a lifetime and never even come close to learning all of the water. It is really many lakes in one. Nothing compares."

1413990,ManitouBass,2012-03-30 11:46:00,201,"You cannot beat LOTW, RainyRiver/lake and Lac seul. But for the smaller lakes... Mainville, Big Sawbill, Despair/Jackfish/Footprint, Straw Lake, Cuddle Lake, Weller, Pickwick, Clayton just to name a few..."
1413999,AllenW,2012-03-30 12:05:00,11482,"Gotta be Red Lake and the Chukuni river, probably because we made it our end of summer trip for over 30 years, there are some really big fish in that lake.The crowd has pretty much dwindled to just two of us, hoping to hit Red at least one more time though.Al"
1419262,wallydave,2012-04-10 17:34:00,2151,"My lac of choice is Lac Seul, the NW end. Year after year the fishing is either good or simply excellent! Back to back 29.5 in walleye! Nothing like a 33 in pike, while jigging walleyes with an ultralite!"
1419489,onetimedave,2012-04-11 07:00:00,502,"Without a doubt my lake would have to be Melchett Lake. It is a fly in out of Nakina. With all the inflow of water (Kap River, Meta Creek, and several others) this lake is a fish factory."
1419505,Golden Eagle,2012-04-11 07:23:00,2642,"May 19, 2012 will be my 28th consecutive walleye opener on Little Vermilion Lake, just a short flight north of Red Lake, Ontario. Not much more to say about that. It's also where my wife and I spent 11 days in October 2011.Lots of huge pike and tons of small to medium walleyes. Countless pleasant memories."
1419825,Yellow Fever,2012-04-11 18:37:00,1809,Have to agree with castnblast Lake Superior especially near Nipigon area no equal anywhere
1413367,benn,2012-03-29 08:06:00,48,"Having an early spring, makes me even more excited to be going to Canada this year! I would like to ask...What is your favorite NW Ontario fishing lake, and why?"
1413376,Cash,2012-03-29 08:29:00,73,"I've only been on Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul, and Minnetaki. I've got to go with Lac Seul. There have been days on Lac Seul when we literally lost count on how many over the slot walleyes we caught. I came of age as a fisherman on Minnetaki. I probably made 12 trips when I was in my 20's. Lots of good memories. More memories for me this year as I'm taking my kids for their first trip."
1413405,TroyMansfield,2012-03-29 09:26:00,92,"I grew up guiding on Minnitaki, Lac Seul, Lake St.joe, and several other fly-in lakes, I would say its a tough decision considering the dynamics that put these lakes together and also seperates them at the same time. And it also depends on the species your tageting, but for walleyes I would say that Minnitaki is awesome, walleyes, monster pike and huge lake trout, Lac Seul is awesome, walleyes, monster pike and trophy Muskie, and Lake St. Joe is unreal, walleyes, monster pike, your probably going to catch the 30'' on Lac Seul and Minnitaki first, but at lake St.Joe your going to catch more walleyes hands down, nice ones too, mostly between 17-26 inches, tough to get the 30'' out of there. We go casting for pike and pull in 40-50''pike and 24-26'' walleyes on spoons And for remote fly-in lakes I would say Raggedwood Lake is my favorite, next is Carling Lake, and Roadhouse on the Cat River sysytem.I chose these because I am very familar with these waters and I have had excellent fishing, and I really dont plan on fishing to many other places unless its in the ocean"
1413416,Mike Kansas,2012-03-29 09:50:00,1463,"Ontario has a bounty of great fishing water. I have spent the last 25 years fishing Lac Seul primarly other than a few trips to other waters. My love for Walleye fishing makes me think that it is hard to beat lac Seul. Have had a lot of 75++ Walleye days with the majority being slot and above. Best day ever was on a trip with guys who like to count and bet, three of us boated 422 Walleyes in 12 hours of fishing and never moved more than 100 yards. I know that may be hard to believe but it happened. Mother nature and Lac Seul make a great combination. Mike Kansas"
1413421,TroyMansfield,2012-03-29 09:53:00,92,"true that mike Kansas, I have had days on Lac Seul where we used 50 doz minnows in one boat, and only moved roughly 100 yards as well, man I cannot wait to get back on the water"
1413424,benn,2012-03-29 10:04:00,48,"Troy, you're gonna make my next 65 days painful! Our group will be staying at Abram Lake June 2-9. We love that area as it allows us to fish Minnitaki, Abram, Big Vermillion, Lost/Lac Seul on any day at any time. Our favorite walleye spot that time of year is Finn Bay. We also love to C&R trout on Big Vermillion. We keep a few for a delicious shore lunch. We've never fished Pelican but might have to give that a try sometime. Wish I could've ""grown up"" fishing those waters as well!"
1413648,pickeralarm,2012-03-29 17:48:00,16,"you may have to fish Abram and Pelican only, because the water is the lowest it has ever been. Chutes are insanely low. Pray for spring rain"
1413659,castnblast,2012-03-29 17:57:00,111,....cause there is nothing like it.
1413681,Gunner_Fletch,2012-03-29 18:42:00,74,"Remember troops, it's not the fish you keep or catch in the lake that makes it your favourite lake.......it's the company you keep and the friends you meet along the way."
1413691,bigwalleye1,2012-03-29 18:57:00,2632,"+1 Gunner, the fish are the bonus. All my memories of Canada involve fish and the friends that were there. Had a great discussion today with an old boat partner who's going back after a hiatus. We were both laughing like a couple kids. Can't wait to do it in person."
