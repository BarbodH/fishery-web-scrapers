6591234,UpNorthGuy,2021-08-18 21:05:00,53,"No I haven't looked at any other camps yet. I got this one on a recommendation from my usual camp. I think I'm going to give it try the 2nd week of September. This place looks nicer than the fish camp I frequent, might get spoiled. I'll let everyone know how it goes. I appreciate all the replies and advice. UNG"
6591248,Aspencreek,2021-08-18 21:57:00,2911,"Hahah, Send me a Private message and I'll send you my address, I mark up maps for guys all the time. But I only fish the area from Windigo Pt up to Ear falls. I have not yet had the opportunity to go further east."
6591262,Eckohlt,2021-08-19 03:17:00,3685,"Actually Aspen I don't fish lac s anymore,and when I did I stayed at mahkwa but it became way to crowded so I moved on.Good luck and keep that shore lunch rock to yourself Haha."
6590484,UpNorthGuy,2021-08-15 17:05:00,53,looking for a recommendation. My normal outfitter is booked up for September. They gave me another place to try not far from them in Perrault Falls on Perrault Lake. The place is called Lakehouse 105. website is http://lakehouse105.ca/ Couple of questions. Has anyone fished this lake? is it any good? Has anyone stayed at this place is it a good camp or just a pretty website?? Any help would be appreciated UNG
6590504,Mojo-NC,2021-08-15 19:23:00,1929,I've not fished Perrault but it certainly seems to be a love/hate lake. I would describe it as one of the most controversial lakes I've ever read about here. Some folks have done well fishing the lake and I've read where others have gotten skunked there. I would recommend that you search the Canada Eh forum for the name Perrault and read the posts from those who have actually fished the lake and then make an educated decision.
6590564,Maverick31,2021-08-16 07:25:00,9,"""Secrets of the Canadian Shield"" by Mark Melius is a great reference to fishing at Perrault Lake. The tips and techniques can apply to many of the lakes in NW Ontario. The book is out of print, but you may find one used on Amazon or a Kindle version. A great resource for all of us who love fishing in NWO. Tight Lines."

6590814,bones82,2021-08-17 12:33:00,121,I’ve fished it. Wife’s a nut and uncle owned Rocky Shore Lodge. Good fishing. I’d have the cabin owner mark up a map for me if I was going. The connecting lake is world renowned for Muskie. There is also a small stream to the SouthEast if I remember correctly. If you go as Far East as you can go under an old mining bridge you come to a lake. Decent fishing there and very secluded. Some good fishing in the connecting lakes there. One has a ton of smallmouth if you can find it. There is only a small stream/canoe width path to it.
6590846,Riding high,2021-08-17 14:28:00,69,What lake do you normally fish. I've fished alot of them in that area. Maybe I can help in comparison of the two. I've fished Perreault and cedar. We had best results in cedar for walleyes and caught the biggest smallmouths on Perreault. But did well in both lakes for both. Did the best on cedar for musky.
6590878,UpNorthGuy,2021-08-17 21:32:00,53,"Thanks everybody for the replies, I really appreciate it. I usually fish on the English River west of Manitou Dam. I like that area in general from Vermillion Bay to Ear Falls. Nice scenery, not to overcrowded, all the camp owners seem nice."
6591126,Aspencreek,2021-08-18 17:05:00,2911,"If you are pulling your own boat, you are only a few miles from MUCH better water on Lac Suel, stay there and fish LS.I have never been on Perault Lake, but my good friend did. He is an experienced walleye guy and he and his brother caught 21 walleye.....for the week! You can do that off the dock, in an hour on LS.Have you checked with any of the camps about 10 miles north on LS, Onaway, Fishermans Cove, Scout Lake, etc."
6591174,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 18:33:00,3685,"Aspen I could handle that,10hrs on the dock 10 times 21 sets up for a awesome day,where the hel is that dock??"
6591192,Aspencreek,2021-08-18 18:58:00,2911,"There is a special place on Lac Suel where you can feed the walleye that live under the fish cleaning house. I've done it. But if you try and catch the dock pets, there will be **** to pay, and pay you will. You may have to change docks, but we catch as many fish per hour during shore lunch as we would if we were in the boat. Just have to pick the right rock, that my friend, is up to you. I am a fisherman, a good fisherman does not give up his spots without some kind of ......compensation."
