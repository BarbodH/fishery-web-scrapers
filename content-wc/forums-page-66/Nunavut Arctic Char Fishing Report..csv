You said it very well Grayling are a wonderful gamefish if light tackle is used.Pang is a bigger and busier spot, always on the radar for work for soooo many reasons. But there it takes $$$$$ or knowing someone to really get any full experiences there. At least that's my worry if ever thinking I could make a ""char"" go of it. Best communities I can work with are those that polar bears are less trouble if out hiking and, the landscape is more manageable for getting places on my own or with rentals and such. Would really like to just hike through the pass in Pang though. Before getting too old for that kind of trekking about. Alaska would be wonderful too... Have thought now and again about Dolly Varden there. Hard to justify the costs / exchange rates and such for that kind of trip though... Especially when employers take care of most things and pay me to go to places like Kugluktuk and others in Nunavut. Thanks for reading though, and sharing your thoughts. Cool to meet fellow arctic travelers."

6589394,Moosebunk,2021-08-12 07:27:00,211,Thanks for reading lads. Always try to be entertaining with these travel recaps and any fishing for that matter. Plenty good days left in this season for more.You're not all bullies. But there's certainly some roughnecks out there who are about as refined as the tar sand oil.
