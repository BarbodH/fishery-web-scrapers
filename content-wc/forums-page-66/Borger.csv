Had to evacuate the first portion of the trip due to forest fires and then relocate to another lake system. The next portion of their trip was cut short due to the loss of his mother. He has lost both parents in less than a year or so. It has been a really tough year for him and his family in addition to no fly in trips to lodges he normally would have been visiting , and promoting, last year and this year. PjShorthorn"
