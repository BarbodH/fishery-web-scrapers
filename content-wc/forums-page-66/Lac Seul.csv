6591776,tanderson15,2021-08-21 19:05:00,37,Finally able to go to Lost Island Lodge. New owners and they haven’t skipped a beat. Bob and Sandi Bauer and John and Jean Costello are the new owners. Great people and there staff is super. August 14 Thur 20 we caught over 150 fish per day average. Many over 20 to 28. Have scheduled two trips next year early and again in August. They have many returns that have come for over 20 years if you would like to go try to schedule now. You will not be disappointed

6591874,orchard frank,2021-08-22 08:56:00,1900,"Wife and I went there every year for 15 yrs or so. Usually 2 weeks, sometimes an extra trip thrown in. Hayes family was there then, Basel and Vivian on staff. some of our most cherished memories. Living in Florida now, but Lost Island always has a place in our hearts."
6591916,tanderson15,2021-08-22 13:41:00,37,They are still there. Great people. Basel is our guide now used to be Sam Hayes
6591920,dakota eye,2021-08-22 13:49:00,69,What depth were you in and what was your main method of catching those amazing fish?
6591924,tanderson15,2021-08-22 14:48:00,37,"1/4 to 3/8 jigs with minnow and rippin rap. 14 to 30 depending on wind, cloud cover, heat and time of day. Morning shallow afternoon normally deep. All of our trips have been great but this was best for bigger fish. Maybe because no pressure last year"
