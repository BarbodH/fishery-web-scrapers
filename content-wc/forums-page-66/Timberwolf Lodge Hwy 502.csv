For crappie and walleye, trips to other nearby waters are suggested. Being sort of in the middle of the bush, it could be a good time, if you don't mind running to other vicinity lakes. I'm guessing it was once a fly-in, apparently camp is run on propane, and a generator(s?) is used for battery charging, i may be wrong on this, but that was what I surmised from the reading. Still, it looks like a neat place, getting to it with reduced driving as a benefit. Bill"

6591936,reddemon2,2021-08-22 16:17:00,255,"pretty rustic, propane stove and lights, 2 cabins have electricity for cpap's. Beds could use replacements"

I wanted to do a quick trip and test out the crossing procedures at the border, Glad I did. TWL offers many options for species, You can fish for crappies, Huge Small/Largemouth Bass, Big pike and eater walleyes. I opted for 2 days of backcountry remote fishing guided. small 14' boat put us in some lakes that probably only get fished a few times a yr. 1st day caught about 100 12-15'' crappies in the morning, then off to another lake for Smallies, 2nd day, consisted of largemouth bass and a few pike. All in all it was a great 2 days and was nice to be in Canada again. A return to Eagle Lake is only 3 weeks away"

One trip I had to stop for my buddy to urinate. I pulled over and he was hanging it out going when all of the sudden a woman bursts out of the place swearing about us savage Americans. My poor buddy could hardly keep from going on himself. Not sure if this is true but we heard that when they sold it, the building was in the right of way and they knew it. After the new owners got it they found out the hard way and had to move it."
6590680,reddemon2,2021-08-16 17:56:00,255,Current owners bought it 5yrs ago
6590682,PRO-V16,2021-08-16 18:08:00,454,This happened at least 15 or so years ago.
