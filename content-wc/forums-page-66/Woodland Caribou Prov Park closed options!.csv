6591552,GetTheNet6,2021-08-20 12:28:00,11,Anyone heard about Woodland Caribou Park opening? or any of the other areas in the Northwest which are closed. I still see the closure posted online due to fires....
6590694,lassh,2021-08-16 19:49:00,553,"Our group of 4 is supposed to do a fly in to Woodland Caribou Provincial park Monday Aug 23 through Monday Aug 30. The whole Woodland Caribou Park is currently closed due to the forest fires. What are the chances it will open up before this Monday? We can't reschedule dates due to other commitments that some of the group have. There is a chance of rain later in the week. Does anyone know how quickly they assess opening the park back up? The order was issued by the Red Lake District Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry. Anyone know of a Canadian cabin/lodge in north western Ontario or Manitoba likely to have openings on short notice next Monday to Monday? Could be a flyin or drive/boat to. We can bring boats if its a drive to. We want to keep our traditional trip to Carroll Lake since we missed it so badly last year. But if it looks like its gonna be closed, we still need to get up north."

If you were planning on going camping, you won't mind being off the grid.There's a 2021 trip report here: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=725994 Another option is nearby: http://sleepydogcabins.com/The owner, Tom, grew up on Wine Lake, he might be able to set you up with canoes and suggest an overnight portage trip to replace a part of that wilderness experience. I can't imagine there are people alive who know the area better than Tom."

6590722,LoDo,2021-08-16 22:09:00,721,"If you were going to Woodland Caribou, Id bet you going through Red Lake. Try Bow Narrows lodge. I'm pretty sure Brian was able to get into camp before the border opened."

6590738,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-08-17 06:15:00,240,"Our grouip's trip to Clear Lake with Nestor Falls Outposts also got cancelled yesterday, for the same reasons. This after I bought a license/outdoor card and after I did all the grocery shopping and packing. Oh well. Being newly retired, I can plan on another, possibly solo trip for early- to mid-September. Over the past few years, many outfitters and camps have begun accommodating groups of 1 and 2 people, so I am still optimistic about crossing the border this year. Lots of options. Hope your group can find something that works! On another topic, has anyone seen the number of slots available at Walgreen's for the ID Now test rapidly disappearing? I was looking at having to make a 200-mile round trip today for my covid testing, as stores in Woodruff, Ashland, and Ironwood had zero openings for today. Trying to get tested in the 72-hour window, with stores having a relatively small number of slots available is problematic. I was looking at needing to drive to Houghton, MI for my testing. There are no CVS stores up here, so Walgreen's is basically the only game in town."
6590744,_JTB_,2021-08-17 06:43:00,1,"I would highly doubt it.[/QUOTE] No, definitely not. No fires of any kind during a fire ban."
6590776,valley366,2021-08-17 08:43:00,193,"Last I talked to the owner at Five Lakes Lodge he still had a couple cabins available. Drive in location. Nice cabins, nice boats and good fishing. You can fish Gullrock, Red, Keg and a couple others.Good luck."
6591056,GetTheNet6,2021-08-18 12:05:00,11,"I was a little surprised when I heard this, because it seemed to me that many of the fires were helped by the rains last week. Still must be many fires burning unfortunately. I spoke with our outfitter about our trip August 30 to Woodland. They havent cancelled our trip yet, because they are hopeful the rain this weekend and next week will help things. Outfitter also said they will know more from the Ministry about the timeframe of closure for Woodland Park later this week...."
