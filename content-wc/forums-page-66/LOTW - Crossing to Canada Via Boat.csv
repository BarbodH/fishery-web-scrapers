(20 to 30 mph tomorrow for example, and 10 MPH plus the remainder of the week). I have a V193 Warrior but I know LOTW can be a dangerous body of water with the wrong winds. I think I read somewhere where it's legal to enter Canadian waters by boat as long as you don't have live bait, and obviously have the appropriate license etc, and don't go shore /beach the boat. Can anyone let me know what information you know of? I already have a Canadian license to be able to fish the Canadian side of the Rainy River, but if we do cross into Canadian waters do we have to call or radio in to anyone, or is it even allowed? Any info appreciated. -Justin"

I'd print it out and have it on my person if I were going to do this. Date it and sign it, possibly with a witness signature. It never hurts to cover your butt.Entering Canadian Waters for Leisure Cruising You can now enter Canada for leisure and touring, including pleasure fishing, sightseeing and other discretionary purposes (known as loop movements). However, you must:continuously remain on your boat while in Canadian watersnot land in Canadanot make contact with another boatnot moor or anchor while in Canadian waters If at any point, you land on Canadian soil, come in contact with another boat or drop anchor, you will be required to report to the CBSA and if youâ€™re eligible to enter Canada, you will become subject to all entry requirements including pre-arrival testing and submitting your mandatory information into ArriveCAN. Travellers engaged in transit or loop movements are not required to report to the CBSA."

I have been ""X"" under these requirements since 8/13/2021."
6591686,C182P,2021-08-21 09:11:00,59,"I've called customs in Fort Francis, as have numerous friends regarding fishing in Canada border waters WITHOUT touching shore, anchoring etc as has been the allowed rule for the last number of years. On LOW, Rainy, Sandpoint, LaCroix etc. All of us have been told absolutely positively NOT unless you first clear Canadian Customs at a port of entry by Canadian Customs in Fort Francis. I would give them a call first. Lots of stuff you find on their websites are out of date and don't reflect changes with the COVID shut downs."
