If you test positive at the border, can you just turn around and go home? How about the time length of quarantine? If you only have one week booked, do you have to move to a govt authorized facility costing big bucks? I have a chance to go in Sept, but I don't want to put myself in a position to be quarantined out of the US and costing me a fortune, or sitting in a cabin and not allowed to fish."
