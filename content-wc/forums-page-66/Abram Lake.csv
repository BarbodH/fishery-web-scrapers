6591136,prov1800,2021-08-18 17:24:00,5010,You never know what we're going to get then.Hopefully it isn't this 40c we are having now.
6591144,prov1800,2021-08-18 17:34:00,5010,Bill last time I was by both places it was still good.Nelson had 1 1/2 ft just before rocks and 2 1/2 ft right by rocks.Peephole showed 1.9 ft on sandbar.So definatly can subtract another foot right now.Iam sure you will get in but might have to pole into peephole.Hopefully we will get some rain but will need to be significant amount.Real bad.Would be very low by old bridge to perrault to.We are loosing water everyday with the 40c temps we are having.Tough conditions to fish.iam going to attempt to go on Cedar very early tomorrow and get off water early.Friday we get a cool front and will be cool all next week with some rain showing
6591148,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 17:47:00,3685,I'll bring 2 augers in case one breaks.Also a auger extension in case the ice oct 2 is 4ft thick
6591154,prov1800,2021-08-18 17:56:00,5010,Don't think you wikl need to go that extreme.But wouldn't leave the sunscreen at home.
6591160,prov1800,2021-08-18 18:00:00,5010,I wasn't supposed to put pics up so i havnt but did find these last week on a dreary cold day on east end.
6591166,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 18:24:00,3685,John is that crappie still alive?
6591178,prov1800,2021-08-18 18:40:00,5010,No.And it didn't go into the fry pan lonely either.
6591184,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 18:47:00,3685,Lol
6591296,Bill Krejca,2021-08-19 07:43:00,6107,"Thanks for the water level report, John, I carry several take-apart poles just for that purpose. Nice crappie, I think I recognize the spot where you are, wind driven area. Bill"
6591316,Medy,2021-08-19 08:27:00,40,Last week a person had a 16 foot camp boat coming out of Nelson. Peephole you could still get into with a bow mount on a competitor. 1-1.5ft on the depth finder and I assume it's dropped since
6590936,prov1800,2021-08-18 07:04:00,5010,My wife's month off is over and she went back to Sioux lookout.She stays on Abram Lake and sent me a couple of pics of the dock at the house.Pretty much laying on dry ground and the extension also.Pics really show how low it is.Water is usually right up to the crib.

6590942,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 07:17:00,3685,[QUOTE=prov1800;6590940]See what happens when you drink to much water from the lake!
6590980,Guest,2021-08-18 08:51:00,0,Are they still able to get thru Abrams chute?
6590984,prov1800,2021-08-18 08:54:00,5010,Wife said there are some boats going through but have to stay reallll tight to the wall.Most are launching on Minnitaki.
6591080,skap,2021-08-18 13:16:00,58,"I just came home from Sioux Lookout on Sunday night. Had a great time but I can definitely confirm the water is LOW. I did go through the chutes Saturday but don't think I would do it now. It was probably around 3-3.5 feet in that channel last weekend and I am sure its dropped a little since then. If you are going to try you need to be on plane and hanging tight to that wall before you make the cut towards the buoys. My passengers took videos going both so I will try to add those. A quick question for the group. I am going up again in mid-September. For those that are trailing and launching on Minnitaki, where are you doing that? Not aware of any public accesses. thanks"
6591082,prov1800,2021-08-18 13:22:00,5010,Go down Drayton rd will take you to launch.
6591098,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 14:15:00,3685,I'm hoping for some snow 1st week of oct when I'm up there.
6591110,Wallychowder,2021-08-18 15:11:00,1567,Are you taking an auger ? Or can you borrow one ?
6591132,Bill Krejca,2021-08-18 17:11:00,6107,"John - Any problems getting into Peephole or Nelson, due to low water? Thanks. Bill"
