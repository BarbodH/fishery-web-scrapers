We got on a really good bite immediately with a little advice from previous anglers on the lake combined with good electronics. We fished hard for 10 days and literally slayed them. We found the majority of the walleyes in about 25' of water give or take a few feet, sometimes in very predictable locations and sometimes not. We would slowly pull spinner rigs at various depths to find fish, and once we got on them, we would pick apart the area jigging. Once we marked enough spots, I found it very enjoyable to troll deep diving crankbaits as we headed to and from these tried-and-true destinations, zig zagging along the shoreline testing various depths. We always seemed to catch a few very nice walleye or pike while doing so. It was a nice change from our ""standard"" methods. Important distinction, I'm not a trolling guy. I like to cast, jig, or pull spinner rigs. So having said that. what rod is best for trolling??? I'm thinking a 7' medium heavy power, medium action crankbait rod. I have other rods to choose from so lay it on me. We're heading back up 3 weeks from today. The fish we catch trolling seem to act very differently while reeling them in as compared with other fish. Sometimes they feel like really good ones at the initial hook-set, then swim along until they get to the boat, and crank it up again once they get near the boat. So what is your favorite rod for such situations?"
