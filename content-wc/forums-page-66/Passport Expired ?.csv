6591652,1shooter,2021-08-21 06:51:00,1493,A person in our group just realized their passport expired last year and we are leaving in one week. Does anyone know if he has any chance of getting it renewed in time or should he plan on sitting this one out?
6591654,Wallychowder,2021-08-21 06:59:00,1567,Driver's license and Birth certificate will be just fine !
6591656,RichA$1970,2021-08-21 07:12:00,1159,If have him call the border crossing just to make sure as that would suck to get turned around. Doubtful he can get the expedited service turnaround as that runs around $380 the last time I saw an employee use it.
6591664,bbheli,2021-08-21 07:32:00,1387,"There are services that claim 24 hour turnaround, he can search them online."
6591670,1/4 oz Jig,2021-08-21 07:53:00,90,This happened to my dad 3 years ago. We live near Chicago and they have a dept of state building which has a passport agency inside. He was able to go in person and get a new passport same day. I believe there is one in Minneapolis as well. Hope this helps.https://travel.state.gov/content/tra...-agencies.html
6591674,CI_Guy,2021-08-21 08:26:00,2118,It will be easier if he also brings the expired passport with the DL and birth certificate. There was an article in one of the papers I read that they are cutting people some slack on expired passports on both sides the Canadian border because the wait time for a new one is so long because of COVID.
6591744,MotorPike,2021-08-21 16:21:00,5,I crossed at Int. Falls in 2019 with drivers license and birth certificate. Passport had expired and renewal took longer by mail than expected. No problems either direction. Passport was waiting in mailbox when we returned.
6591756,bubba800,2021-08-21 16:50:00,558,Had one in our group expire. Minneapolis Passport Agency on the corner of S Washington Avenue and 3rd Avenue S was the place to go. Paid an expedited fee and had it in less than a week.
6591768,Baseline,2021-08-21 18:13:00,3207,"A couple years ago I forgot my passport and realized it as we were preparing to cross the border at I Falls / Fort Francis. I checked in with US customs prior to crossing and they told me if you are a US citizen they have to let you back in. Canada just required a DL, but they ask about the passport. I told them I forgot it. They asked me to pull into the hold lot and simply ran my DL then brought it back and told me to enter. When I returned it was basically to same process. The US Border guy told me that I should take a picture of my passport and DL to keep in case it happens again. This isn't bad advice for everyone who needs a passport. I went to Canada on the Wednesday after the border opened and they did ask for a passport, covid vax card and negative test document. I had a passport so I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have one. A passport is listed as required ID documentation on the Arrive Canada App. The app requires you to upload a photo of the passport. So it could be crap shoot if he can get in without it. Those 24 hour turnaround outfits make no guarantee."
