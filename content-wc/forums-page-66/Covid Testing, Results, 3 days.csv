6583692,phishfearme,2021-07-27 11:11:00,1242,from the Walgreen site - the labs promise 24 hr TAT but have been doing 6-8 hours. see:https://www.aegislabs.com/our-services/covid19-testing/ this may get challenged in mid august phish
6583698,Riding high,2021-07-27 11:21:00,69,We have clinics that are part of the hospital around us. I stop and asked them and they are next day or 24 hour if I need sooner the hospital has results in 30 minutes.
6583752,Larry S,2021-07-27 13:22:00,665,My Walgreens here in Henderson Nevada said that it will take 1 to 2 days to get results of a NAAT or PCR Test. Same with CVS. I found a lab here that will get you results in 1 to 2 hours for a fee of $ 149 . Want to got fishing to Canada so will pay the fee
6583768,phishfearme,2021-07-27 14:25:00,1242,"for those of you who don't know and love LarryS like we do, he's worked for the postal service for decades. the old motto: ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds"" the new motto for Larry - heading to Canada from NV: ""Neither snow nor rain, nor expensive rental cars, nor expensive flights, nor expensive Covid tests will stay him from his appointment in Canada with the local walleye population."" Larry - you da man! phish"

6583976,phishfearme,2021-07-28 08:47:00,1242,"i stopped at our local Walgreens this morning - this is how it was explained to me: - all test swaps taken that day are collected and sent to the lab (Labcorp) at 5pm. - the lab should recieve the swabs the next working day - working day that is, don't expect analysis over a weekend although it may occur - once the lab receives it, they've been advertising a 1-2 day turnaround (see https://www.labcorp.com/coronavirus-...-covid-19/news ) - they will then send an email to you with results - you could possibly get the results earlier by logging onto the Labcorp app or web site to check if the results are available - Walgreens will NOT promise anything faster than 2 days TAT - the say 2-3 days - but 2 days or less has been the norm. from this, it seems reasonable that you could take the test say 3-4pm, and possibly have the results the next day via either an email or logging onto the LabCorp web site but it is more likely to be available the second day. so, if you want to cross the border on say a thursday late afternoon, have the swab taken the previous tuesday around 3 pm. this should give you a one day margin if all goes as planned but you should be able to get the results within the 72 window imposed by Canada. if you get a false positive - either wait til next year, things should be a lot easier - or pay the piper. phish"
6583990,Wallychowder,2021-07-28 09:17:00,1567,"All this hype about ""72 hour pre test"" probably isn't going to mean squat, because there probably going to test everyone crossing anyway ! And it's going to have to be a rapid test !"
6584144,Moondog,2021-07-28 16:38:00,362,"This IS a molecular test offered by Walgreens. I just left there. The test is free. I guess it depends on what Walgreens you go to but the people I talked to told me I could wait for the results and have a hard copy and/or the results will be emailed in 15-60 minutes. This particular store has its own in house testing equipment so no sending the swabs out to labs. Obabikon is right on, as usual!!!"
6584304,JDP,2021-07-29 08:58:00,1457,I learned the same from Walgreens as Moondog. It is possible to identify the Walgreens locations that have in house testing equipment on the Walgreens website.
6584384,BuckeyeATC,2021-07-29 13:13:00,88,I've been looking on Walgreens to determine which ones around me have in house testing results for the ID Now tests. Where did you find it on their website?
6582998,mms3rd,2021-07-25 10:49:00,148,"If someone addressed this, I apologize. My research states that getting results from the type of test that Canada wants can take at least a couple days. The accepted test results must be presented in Canada 3 days within date of TAKING the test. How does this work? Do some of the tests have same day turn around? I can't find anything on government web sites. It sounds like some birder crossings are giving testing kits...maybe I have that wrong.....but none were in Ontario. mms3rd"
6583000,BuckeyeATC,2021-07-25 10:57:00,88,Your best bet is the ID now (NAAT) Test from Walgreens. It is accepted by Canada and you can get results in 30-60 minutes from what I have heard. They can be scheduled three days out on Walgreens website. Not sure about the cost.
6583118,reddemon2,2021-07-25 18:31:00,255,"Walgreens NAAT Tests are free, Results within 1hr"
6583140,drew59,2021-07-25 19:18:00,87,My understanding is it's 72 hours which is different than 3 days. Can you imagine taking a test Wednesday morning at 9:00 and getting the border Saturday at noon only to be told 75 hours is outside the window? I'm not taking that chance.
6583220,10lbeye,2021-07-26 08:09:00,61,"I called my local urgent care clinic, affiliated with one of the local hospitals, and was told that I could get the required PCR molecular test and the results in 1.5-2 hours. So, I think that if you call around, you can find a rapid test that meets the criteria. NOTE: the ArriveCan App and other sources I've read states that the ANTIGEN test is not accepted; you need the PCR Molecular test. FWIW..."
6583570,stumcfar,2021-07-27 07:45:00,451,"From what I am understanding the test required, will cost about $200 at the Clinic in my area.. That eats up almost 2 days worth of expenses at a lot of camps! Dang!!"
6583588,Obabikon,2021-07-27 08:04:00,2370,"Walgreens ALL OVER THE MIDWEST do NAAT rapid tests... these are accepted. My local one said we would have the results in 2 hours. This is the way to go guys.... it is free, it is easy, it is fast."
6583590,Obabikon,2021-07-27 08:08:00,2370,"Just go to https://www.walgreens.com/topic/prom...ry_main_053021 That's the link directly to covid testing. Schedule your appointment, and get ready to head north!!! FREE, EASY, FAST!!!!"
6583598,BCNeal,2021-07-27 08:16:00,19,Obabikan...good info! That's my plan. Thanks!
6583662,fishforlife,2021-07-27 10:02:00,77,"Walgreens here in Pennsylvania told me because of volume of tests given they, and cvs, and rite aid cannot get guaranteed results faster than 3 to 7 days. There is a clinic here with 2 day results for $150. Just going to have to pay to play ."
