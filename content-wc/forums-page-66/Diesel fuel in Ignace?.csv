6591926,Guest,2021-08-22 15:20:00,0,"You can get diesel at Silver Dollar, about 45 miles north of Ignace. Put in all new tanks and pumps 3 years ago. We stay there and never had any problems."
6591002,guidedfishing,2021-08-18 09:43:00,531,"I think you mean Troy and Penny's will likely go by there at some point, will see if I find anything out. My assumption is yes since they service many of the camps in that area."
6591004,RichA$1970,2021-08-18 09:45:00,1159,I called and the Northwood Inn restaurant and they are not open on weekends. She said the Robin’s scoop is the place to go for weekends. I’m crossing at Pigeon River around 0230 so doubt much is open near there so plan on stopping in Ignace at 0600 before arriving at Savant next Saturday. Looks like they are roasting up there this week.
6591006,Pooch,2021-08-18 09:59:00,4618,"Troy & Penny's is now ""The minnow Shack"". Their daughter now owns it. After calling all over between TB and Ignace I found leeches there. 807-584-2957 Pooch"
6591008,Wallychowder,2021-08-18 10:06:00,1567,That's odd ! Leeches this late in the season ?
6591010,Lovetofish,2021-08-18 10:09:00,458,"Thanks Pooch, I now have their phone number. They run a nice business. Just want to be sure they were open as that's my last opportunity to buy bait."
6591020,Skywagon,2021-08-18 10:32:00,1106,"I was all set for some ice cream at the Burger Scoop when I went through Ignace 3 weeks ago on a week day, they were closed, there was a for sale sign out front, when I went back through last Thursday nothing had changed, they were still closed. I have since heard it is a permanent situation. I would not be concerned about buying diesel from the the Esso, Morgan fuel is by far the largest fuel supplier in the surrounding area, I buy my bulk premium from them."
6591048,Eckohlt,2021-08-18 12:02:00,3685,They sell crawlers there?
6591074,Pooch,2021-08-18 12:54:00,4618,call them
6591114,Wallychowder,2021-08-18 15:27:00,1567,"Eck , you dont need to buy them there. I think they have plenty of crawlers up at Safeway parking lot in Fort Francis. But be prepared there packed in bedding !"
6591150,Pooch,2021-08-18 17:50:00,4618,"They are trappers and have numerous aircraft. I think they also do a good wholesale business. Very nice people. And, yes this is one of the few times I've found leeches at this time of the year. Especially as hot and dry as it has been. Pooch"
6590870,Pooch,2021-08-17 20:22:00,4618,"I will need diesel fuel for my pickup at Ignace. Which stations would sell a lot of diesel and be safe to buy from? Three years ago I got a bad tank of fuel somewhere on one of our Canada trips. Not sure which station, but not from any station in Ignace. Some where between IF and Duluth. Don't remember which station. So now I am ""goosie"" about buying diesel fuel on the road from small stations. Anyone from that area buying diesel in Ignace? Pooch"
6590874,RichA$1970,2021-08-17 20:42:00,1159,"Just to add onto this, any restaurants open early for breakfast from Pigeon Falls to Ignace as I plan on stopping at Vern’s minnows when they open at 0700 before I make it to Lake Savant?"
6590916,Pooch,2021-08-18 06:25:00,4618,Northland Inn in Ignace has a good breakfast and opens fairly early. Northland is the big green colored hotel on highway 17 not far from the east end of town. Pooch
6590934,guidedfishing,2021-08-18 07:04:00,531,"I always get Diesel at the Esso station on the west end of town in Ignace, other than the funky prepay on the credit card I have not had any issues with bad fuel. Since I am a long way up 599, I always have 15 gallons of spare diesel fuel to make it back as I do not trust any of the diesel in Savant lake."
6590946,guidedfishing,2021-08-18 07:25:00,531,"I second North land Inn on the east end for breakfast in Ignace, Also the The Eddy in Kakabeka falls. Honestly I would not know if I would take for granted what would be open or not open at the moment. I plan on taking sandwichs and assuming amenities will be limited. Heading up this Saturday morning."
6590986,Pooch,2021-08-18 09:01:00,4618,"Was hesitant to carry extra fuel in the topper, but have two yellow race fuel jugs that now have diesel from my own fuel barrels. This I trust. I always try to buy fuel in Canada as it is the right thing to do, but not willing to risk the fuel filter fiasco from two years ago. Probably cost me nearly a grand to finally get the crap fuel out of the injection system. Gasoline is no problem, but diesel can be sketchy. Fueling up at Grand Portage then crossing at Pigeon River, I can barely make it back to Grand Portage without a fuel stop. Cutting it very close so in the past have filled up in Ignace at the Esso, but it always worries me when buying diesel on the road. Pooch"
6590988,Lovetofish,2021-08-18 09:08:00,458,Where will you be fishing?
6590990,guidedfishing,2021-08-18 09:16:00,531,Sturgeon lake up to Minchin and lakes in between with low water it may limited some of the Landings available. Heading up Saturday morning.
6590994,Lovetofish,2021-08-18 09:22:00,458,I' be up that way next month and made a post earlier about the bait trapper by Savant Lake hoping it will be open. I don't have a phone number for them.
6590996,guidedfishing,2021-08-18 09:22:00,531,"Yup, I don't care to carry fuel but.. cost and quality north of Ignace is suspect. I could easily go from Grand Portage to Ignace and return if that is all I did, but I will end up topping off in Ignace and then using all 15 of my take along gallons to either get me back to Ignace or further down the road. And the long runs on Sturgeon even with a 27 gallon on board tank is quickly eaten up."
