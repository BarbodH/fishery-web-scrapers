Am I misreading this, and/or has anyone asked or tried it? I got the thing back in April, so that'd be a relief, just in case the negative tests don't pan out."

If you are now symptom-free, you can provide proof of a positive COVID-19 molecular test when crossing the border, instead of a negative one. The test must have been conducted between 14 and 180 days prior to your scheduled entry into Canada The proof of the positive result must be from an accepted type of molecular test You must show proof of your test results even if you: have tested negative for COVID-19 previous to the 72 hour period have been vaccinated for COVID-19 recovered from COVID-19 and no longer test positive recovered from COVID-19 and continue to test positive The way I read this is you can use a positive test if you are symptom free and it is between 14 - 180 days. Honestly I would not want to test those waters, if all I had to do was get a negative test within 72 hrs. The only way I would go with this is if I could show that I continue to test positive even after the fact which I understand some folks do long after they are symptom free and recovered. Good luck"
