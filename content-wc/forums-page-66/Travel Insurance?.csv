6591930,halfmoon007,2021-08-22 15:27:00,121,I assume they don't cover you in Canada. I start medicare mid week of my trip next week.I will use travel ins. next time.
6592004,38bill,2021-08-22 21:30:00,331,Check with your new Medicare insurer. My basic BCBS Medicare Advantage PPO covers emergency medical service world wide (with a $90 copay).

Anyone have experience or recommendations with doing this? Any suggestions or information would be appreciated! RBF"
6588074,Bstar,2021-08-09 05:12:00,564,We use GeoBlue Travel insurance. Haven't had to use it yet but it's peace of mind knowing you have some coverage in Canada. Relatively inexpensive especially if you have 5+ people in your group.
6588142,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-09 07:38:00,429,Star. Thank you! I will look into it! RBF

6588710,Fisherman Ted,2021-08-10 13:32:00,461,My customers (and myself for personal trips) have been using TravelEx Insurance for years. They pay out claims every year with few issues. I have also personally filed a claim when I had to cancel a cruise last minute and they paid it all.http://www.travelexinsurance.com/ind...HawkLake&go=bp This company is the one I put in every booking (hundreds a year). I would never book a trip anywhere without buying insurance. -FT
6588730,fishingfever,2021-08-10 14:36:00,85,I start out using insuremytrip.com. It searches for a policy that meets your qualifications. I've always ended up using GeoBlue though. Under $100 for a 1 million policy with no lookback period for pre-existing conditions for a week in Canada. Have a great trip.
