1379983,5thsuit,2012-01-06 20:02:00,54,"41 trips to northwestern Ontario, I have caught a dozen or so between 40-43. In 2009 I netted a 47 for my boat partner, biggest I have ever seen. Same year another friend caught a 48 on LOW, his long time guide told him he had only seen 2 or 3 larger. I'm still waiting on that first 30"" walleye, 28 is my largest."
1380756,Guest,2012-01-09 12:58:00,0,"i do a canoe trip to quetico ontario where ive landed a 32.5"" walleye(the first year, nothing over 26"" since) and a 48.25"" pike on the 3rd trip(with 4 or 5 between 38"" and 42"" also). ive been going for 6 years. biggest muskie is 44.5"" so im 1 for 3. ive seen only 2 walleyes over 30 in my life and never a pike over 50"". this last july on our trip one of the guys landed a 49"" pike. nothing gets the adrenaline flowing like a fish like that from a 14' canoe."

1381242,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-01-10 15:10:00,235,"3 lb smallmouth can pull my canoe around in the Sylvania Wilderness. I can only imagine a pike that size. Too bad they can't be tamed, they could be like horses or oxen to pull your canoe."
1382759,Dman CA,2012-01-14 10:45:00,1,"How's this for a first post? Feeling pretty lucky here 47-30 for me both in the same trip, guessing that is a once in a lifetime thing. 2009 Headwaters LakeWill be happy to even get close in the future!"
1382765,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-14 11:07:00,1460,"First post, wow, very cool. Welcome to Walleye Central. Little perspective, I've been to Canada over 40 times. My bests are 44 1/2"" and 27"". But, I'm a guy who loves to fish, never said I was any good at it."
1373085,SteveJ715,2011-12-13 21:29:00,59,"Always appreciate the feedback from everybody, and it was interesting to hear everybody's adventures with big pike. I guess I overshot my objective of having a lofty but attainable goal to strive for in the coming years on the water if (so far) nobody's been able to do it. What's interesting to me is that it sounds like a fair amount of anglers haven't yet pulled in a 40-inch pike (myself included), let alone a 50-incher.Part of what I'm wondering about is if there's a rough equivalent for two elusive-but-achievable trophy fish. Maybe it's 45-30 as was suggested, or maybe even 40-30. Anyway, thanks again for the thoughts and keep chiming in. - Steve"
1373089,Basser,2011-12-13 21:59:00,31,"Obviously I'd love to catch a 50 "" pike or 30"" walleye but if I go to Canada every summer and never catch another pike over 40 or walleye over 25 I will still love every minute of it! Basser"
1373325,jambi,2011-12-14 14:46:00,504,"Great reading here. I've taken an annual Ontario trip twelve years running now to LOTW and four flyouts. I love catching pike, even if they are not of great size. My Dad and I would count 30"" and greater fish, some years we catch only a few and others we'd catch near 20. I think in twelve years we caught about 7 fish in the 40""-42"" range. Also caught five muskie over 40"" largest 48"". Last year was my first real walleye experience and it was a blast. Biggest was 23"". 50-30 club is likely elite company!"
1373345,LOW1,2011-12-14 15:58:00,2828,"I think to be fair and yet hard but realistic to achieve it would need to vary lake by lake. For LOTW, I hereby propose 45-30. Or add Muskie and make it 50-45-30, although these numbers could also look like a fair number of the female dock attendants I have seen at Minnesota resorts.For the record, I am zero for three on the 50-45-30, but closer to the walleye number than the others."
1373463,RickOnt,2011-12-15 07:49:00,217,I think the 45-30 would be more attainable.However I have not reached either!!!44-28 for me
1373479,Larry Mac,2011-12-15 08:13:00,530,"Hi guys; my goal has always been 40-30. I have been fishing the Canadian wilderness for many years and normally do not target pike. To date I have been blessed with a 43"" pike and I am still hunting that 30"" walleye. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1373488,orchard frank,2011-12-15 08:36:00,1900,"Pike was out of Hatchet Lake Lodge outpost lake. Weighed a little over 25, heaviest pike of the trip was a 44 that looked like a fencepost, weighed 27+(both on a good scale). Never caught a 30"" walleye in Canada, lots of 28's and 29's, usually get a few 30's every year in BaydeNoc, had 4 over 30 in one night a few years back. Biggest ever a little over 32, but have not broken the 12# mark yet."
1373681,LeeMB,2011-12-15 17:41:00,83,"I have been lucky enough to fish northern manitoba for a long time and have caught both a 50"" Pike and a ton of 30""walleyes, most of the walleyes thru the ice."
1379527,Babamel2,2012-01-05 14:22:00,414,I got a 30 in walleye a few years ago on Dinorwic. Ironically two days earlier someone from the same camp got one that was almost 30. These are the largest I have seen in all the times I have fished Canada.
1379561,dhottle,2012-01-05 16:23:00,163,"Instead of the 50-30 club it should read 50-35 club. A 35"" walleye would probably be as scarce as a 50"" pike."
1372300,SteveJ715,2011-12-11 12:40:00,59,"So after reading the Biggest Walleye of the Year post the other day, I got to thinking: Which is harder to come by, a 30"" walleye or a 50-inch pike? And how many anglers here could claim membership in the 50-30 Club (or the 30-50 Club if you prefer)? Seems like quite a few people here have a 30-incher to their name, but this being Walleye Central, there's less talk about big pike. My guess is that a 50-inch pike would be more rare than a 30-inch walleye, but I'd be curious to hear everybody's opinion.For the record, I'd be far short of club membership; my career bests would be a 36-inch pike and a 28-inch walleye (a few times over). But I'm hoping to be able to improve on those numbers in the years to come. Just something to think about during the long wait till next June...- Steve"
1372313,JDP,2011-12-11 13:25:00,1457,A 50 inch Northern Pike is an extremely rare creature. It is much more common to catch a 30 inch Walleye. I would speculate that there are many more people that have caught a 50 inch Musky and 30 inch Walleyeversus a 50 inch Northern Pike and a 30 inch Walleye.
1372314,Bill Krejca,2011-12-11 13:29:00,6107,Ditto. Bill

1372355,dhottle,2011-12-11 17:10:00,163,"Hey steve good question, easy answer. 50"" pike in northern america are extremely rare. 30"" walleye although hard to come by IF you don't fish big fish waters are relatively common. I know I have caught well over a dozen 30"" walleye with a 33"" & a 33.25"" as my biggest. I have never caught a 50"" pike although I fish in Canada once a year at a primo location for more than the 15-20 years. I did manage one 49""x22"" from all those trips. And I lost one over 50"" at the boat. We catch a lot of pike over 40"" up to 45"" but the 46"" thru 50"" range are really rare."
1372361,vteye,2011-12-11 17:31:00,812,I think a 45 - 30 club is more realistic.
1372386,J. Merics,2011-12-11 20:23:00,32,"I agree, in general a 50"" pike is more rare than a 30"" walleye. Unless your talking watersheds in the far north where 50"" northerns are not all that uncommon but 30"" walleye are.A legit 60"" musky would be a much more rare animal than both....Jay Merics"
1372832,northernbite,2011-12-13 07:44:00,1186,"I'm With JDP on this one. I've caught a few 30 inch walleye over the years but that 50 inch pike has not came along. I go every year to Canada looking for him and my biggest is 46"". I'm beginning to think that the big pike is in my back door at the Kinzua reservoir.Paul"
1372839,Bill Krejca,2011-12-13 08:12:00,6107,"The best chance at a 50"" pike is probably to fly over to Holland, Finland, Norway, etc. The pike grow big over there, with catch and release promoting big ones staying in the waters. I'm led to believe the pike there are a somewhat different subspecies of the North American strain, but they look pretty much the same in pictures I have seen. My guess is that catching one on this continent approaches the chances of winning the lottery - not impossible, but highly unlikely. Bill Krejca"
