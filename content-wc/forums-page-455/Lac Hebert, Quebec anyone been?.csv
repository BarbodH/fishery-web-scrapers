Its NNW of the Goiun, just wondering if anybody out there has fished it maybe some good spots and hot lures or colors. Done a few drive-in and fly-in trips over the years and only one thing I hate, the wait between booking the trip and the first cast. Also got a couple of planer boards at a garage sale any tips for a trolling newbie? Walleye opens early May here(upstate NewYork) so I have a monthof practice. Thanks fosterthedog"

Jean has stressed catch and release since then and upgraded to Lunds I believe. It is a shallow lake and can get really rough quick and for days at a time. Consider flying out of the Baskatong, your kidneys will appreciate it. Enjoy! RED"

Most tof the time we used worms on jigs, but they bit on anything you put in the water, If you were got tired of Walleyes, you can put on a lure and get big pike. Most of the good spots are in the shallow waters surrounding the island where the cabins are. Be aware that the lake is way up north so we had 82 degree days and it snowed in the same week in June so be prepared for any and all weather possibilities. The day light lasted about 19 hours so you have to learn how to sleep in the light or take a nap or both. Bring a GPS with you if you are going far out from the island as bad storms can come up and you will need the GPS to find the island in the blinding rain or snow."
