1351429,Guest,2011-09-20 20:05:00,0,We usually go in Sept to Gullrock. Next year we want to go in June or July and bring our sons up for the first time. I have a ton of questions about the fishing as you know the boys will need some quick action to get them interested. Thanks for any advice you may have in advance.
1351432,Guest,2011-09-20 20:10:00,0,Is Jr's below the dam too? Is the place old or is a bunch of stuff broken when you say run down?
1351436,Guest,2011-09-20 20:28:00,0,We like to do some Pike and bass fishing as well as the walleye. How's that action? Sorry for the flood of questions but it's hard to switch camps after a number of years at a familiar lake without some info to support the decision. What time of year do you go up?
1351596,jdff21,2011-09-21 11:06:00,17,We go the the 2nd week of aug we mostly do walleye fishing but when do fish for pike we do decent there are alot of big ones there the small bass fishing is also very good and about the place being run down i was talking about the other camp i had stayed at. andersons camp they are below the dam very good fishing there also prob. little better but if you dont have your own boat his are not that good but JR'S boats are excelent and he he will put you on the fish and JR'Sis above the dam so you dont have to worry about the water level as much

Back then it was EJAY's. Fishing: We've been successful nearly every year that I can remember. One year the Walleye were too big to keep. Lots of good fishing and access to more water than you can fish in a lifetime, including south end of Pakwash. Pakwash is about a 45 minute boat ride, but always seems to provide great fishing and my father always catches his ""trophy"" pike there. We've found a sweet spot for Smallmouth, but we go too early in June to really get into them consistently each year, but they are fun! Facilities: Lodging isn't bad. Heat (if needed), plumbing, full kitchen, nice screened in porch. I always enjoyed getting away from the world for a week and you still can, but he does have satellite TV and wireless internet if you need it. May be good for the kids if this is their first time. We usually haul 1 or 2 boats up, but Jim's boats are in great condition. Let me know if you need more info. Maybe we'll see you there in June."

They were starting to reside some cabins last year. I have been told they are purchasing some new motors this year as well as some other items. I have found the cabins to be fine. My son enjoyed fishing of the dock when I cooked meals. He would catch 100 + walleyes a week from the dock, small ones up to 27 in., plus a 45 in. pike. If you would like more information or questions, please send me a p.m."

We have stayed there several times and the fishing is great for Walleye, Pike and Smallies. You have close access to town and the camps rates are very favorable. It is of course on the English River and you have great access to a lot of down river fishing spots. We spent the majority of our time fishing the area by the Dam (5 minutes from camp). Have had some great days catching Walleyes of good size there. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
