1380611,Esoxchaser,2012-01-09 06:29:00,1576,"Sounds to me like the new owners have fired you as clients, or your cabin would have been reserved. Apparently he thinks your complaints were too much to handle, but they don't seem unreasonable to me. Just so I don't make the mistake of expecting working depth sounders and a sink that doesn't drain onto the floor from the wrong resort, who is it that thinks that your requests were too numerous?"
1380613,LLewellin,2012-01-09 06:42:00,1790,http://www.womanlakelodgecanada.com/ I stayed with these new owners last fall and I rebooked for next fall already. What a great wilderness fishing experience. IMHO
1380621,Stu,2012-01-09 07:14:00,472,"I prefer to fish on lakes w/ few resorts too. Previously, I have fished Thaddeus (only one resort about 5 cabins on the lake). This year I booked a cabin on Holinshead (the only resort on the lake). I have tried get into Press Lake also, but they are usually booked. Good luck - Stu"

1380706,tv4fish,2012-01-09 11:08:00,2694,"I honestly think that you would be doing the rest of US a favor by stating which resort did this?? I would hate to reserve a spot there not knowing how they treat their customers??I may be ONLY an old MINNESOTA farm boy , but that is one resort I would not want to go to."
1382393,Andyeye,2012-01-13 11:57:00,179,"I have been to Cygnet Lake Camp many times over the years and everything about the camp, the owners and the fishing has been super. It is a smaller lake about 3600 acres with great fishing for nice numbers of walleyes, northern, smallmouth, and perch. Very reasonably priced and not far from Kenora. I'm sure there are many great places. I have fished Lac Seul, Lake of The Woods, fly-ins out of Red Lake, but for a drive-in lake with good fishing and even better people check this place out. You might find bigger fish on a fly-in or at Lac Seul but you won't spend all day looking for a place to fish either.It is really the only resort on the lake there is another one but it is mainly a family place. Good Luck wherever you end up."
1382916,NWE,2012-01-14 19:19:00,13,"Iowa Farm boy,Check out Skyline Lodge on Florence Lake, in Perrault Falls ON. (20 min south of Ear Falls). They are a family run lodge on a smaller lake, offering all of the species you mentioned. I am sure you and your party will be more than satisfied with the fishing and accomodations. Have a look on-line."
1383235,NorthwestGuide,2012-01-18 11:47:00,1,"I used to guide up on Thaddeus and the fishing is unbelievable, customer service is a huge priority at the camp, I don't think you would be disappointed"

1380416,Iowa Farm Boy,2012-01-08 13:18:00,44,"Found out this week that the lodge operator cancelled our reservation next year without notifying us. We had reserved the cabin upon our departure last year and recently sent an E mail inquiring about when our deposit was due. The lodge operator stated that based on some of our complaints last year he did not think we were coming back and he had no cabins available. If we were not coming back we would have not reserved the cabin. Did not think our complaints were out of line:1) Reserved an upgraded boat but none were available when we got there.2) The boat we received was to come with a fish finder only to find out he pulled the fish finder and installed it into one of the upgraded boats since theirs was not working.3) Fresh water filter in the cabin was broken the entire week.4) Sewer line from kitchen sink disconnected and we had to stand in the slop. You would think they would have jumped on this repair but that was not the case.5) There were not enough minnows in camp at times.We have been going to this resort for 21 of the last 25 years and have worked with two owners and three different resort operators in that time. I am not going to mention the lodge as this was the first year for the resort operator and we could understand the pressure he was under. In any case we are now scrambling to find another resort.Any ideas on a drive in lodge in northwest Ontario? Looking for a smaller lake with a limited number of resorts. We would prefer only one resort on the lake. (Walleye, Northern, Small Mouth and Perch - June 2nd thru the 8th)"
1380420,djarz929,2012-01-08 13:32:00,40,Have you thought of Cedar Lake Lodge? Al runs a pretty nice operation.
1380423,Hump,2012-01-08 13:41:00,578,"Lac Seul, near Ear Falls. Great camp, boats are awesome, great fishing, super owners and staff."
1380433,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-08 14:00:00,1460,For a great drive-in adventure give Scott and Mary Jo a shout.http://www.forrestlodge.com/
1380439,Larry Mac,2012-01-08 14:45:00,530,"Hi Iowa Farm Boy, there are many, many great drive to outfitters that would kill to have your kind of loyal business. You complaints were not out of line in the least. Amazingly your group did not cancel on him. The above suggestions are all great and that is just scratching the surface. I believe you will be pleasently surprised at the options that are out there for your group. Have a great year and please let us know where you decide to go.P.S. IMHO that outfitter ""Just got a kick in the arse"" by loosing such a loyal group. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1380449,wallydave,2012-01-08 15:11:00,2151,"http://www.canadafever.com/index.phpIowa, try this link. They have lots of info on NW Ontario! I would suggest Goose Bay Camp or Cherob, both on Lac Seul, Andrea at GB might be full that time of year, but with the econmoy the way it is you may find a camp or resort to get into.I am glad your have tempered ypour disappointment by not naming the resort in question. Most of us might not be so kind given the years you have been a loyal customer, but given the problems and the lack of customer service you may find a lake and owner/operator that will take care of your groups needs.I have found that it is the group experiance, the fellowship and working together that makes the trip, sure great fishing, a good experiance on the lake and back in the cabin just add to the whole ""big picture"" of fishing Canada. I hope your group finds the lake and camp that will take care of you! When you find a good one lat the rest of us know!"
1380454,v-bay gord,2012-01-08 15:25:00,3168,"A deposit ""on the books"" with both parties having a copy sure solves a lot of these problems. Even with good intentions on both sides, mix ups do happen. Good thing you found out now and not later."
1380493,outdoorsron,2012-01-08 17:53:00,843,Hello: Check out Wenasaga Lodge near Ear Falls. Only resort on the lake. Been going there for last 7 years. Sounds like it's just what your looking for. Good Luck O - R
1380504,lenray,2012-01-08 18:21:00,467,"Yo Farm Boy--67 year old farm boy here---go to water like us farm boys do--water where others don't have what it takes to be brave. We don't have a problem with boats, cabins, minnows, sinks. Just my opinion--lodges are for girlie fisherman. I can well afford to buy a lodge--just won't fish at one. And where we fish minnows are not legal bait and we don't neeedddd emmm."
1380508,Sparkyd,2012-01-08 18:35:00,197,There is a Sport and Vacation show in Des Moines this weekend. Usually lot of the resorts are represented there. It's at the Events center downtown. Always a good way to get in the mood for the vacation..Dave
