1382335,Jaskonie,2012-01-13 09:35:00,80,Met them at the show and was impressed with the boat fleet rates and the Lake. One question I have is how popoulated is it? Frank said there is just one other camp and a cottage or 2 on the lake? Google earth show a lot more than that. Also what about LochIsland or Marmac. We have a group of over 20 people including kids.

There are about 40 cottages on that lake but In defense of Frank ,it is a very large lake and River system (reservoir) so they are spread out and easy to find spots where you won't see anyone else all day. My Biggest walleye was a 27 inch, biggest pike 42 inch (CR) . His lodge is 20 minutes from Wawa so you can go into town when the urge hits you. There are two other lodges on the lake (Hidden River and Whitefish Lodge) Frank;s brother Don is a fishing guide and musician in area see his website for fishing shots. http://www.doncharbonneau.com/fr_home.cfm"
