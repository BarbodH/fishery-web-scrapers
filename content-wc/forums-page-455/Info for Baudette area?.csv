1377262,J-Man,2011-12-29 17:29:00,191,"Lake of the Woods Foods is your grocery option in Baudette. Located right on the corner where you make the turn to head to the bridge to cross the border.Couple liquor stores in the area but I don't know much about selection, price, etc. Municipal Liquor is right on the corner of Main St/Main Ave...a newer liquor store is a few blocks west on Main St next ot the second Cenex gas bar. There is duty free in Baudette just before you cross and LCBO outlet in Rainy River as well. Sometimes much easier at the border not to have a lot of extra liquor. Always better to claim hard liquor for your exemption and pay tax on beer if you have the choice. Bait shop on the east side of town coming in is probably as good bet as any for crawlers if that is what you are after. Not sure where your final destination will take you, but there is a great grocery store in Emo if you are heading up HWY 71..also the best place to exchange some money if you want some Canadian currency. Shop Easy Cloverleaf Foods right on HWY 11. Would be worth the 5-10 miles out of the way if you are heading that direction."

You will spend more for groceries/gas for sure. I have stayed many times in Baudette and everything costs more there, that's the way it is because of where they are."
1381798,MorganMan,2012-01-11 22:35:00,341,"Oh, and by the way....The Ranch House is opening back up in a week or two for those of you familiar with the area. They got rid of the of big cow though, new sign. Gonna miss the cow."
1383775,go dart,2012-01-19 19:16:00,77,Gas up in the USA before crossing. We stopped at the 1st station after crossing Baudette and I know that ole boy got to me. I really never knew what my gas cost and just had a real uneasy feeling about that place.
1383833,J-Man,2012-01-20 02:37:00,191,"Hey Go-Dart:There is only one place to get gas in Rainy River so I'm curious as to what exactly you are implying? Did you pay in US currency? Credit card? Get a receipt? At times, exchanged rates can be pretty subjective and one must be careful of how they use a foreign currency somewhere so that they are getting the best value for their cash. Did you not check the posted price on the gas pump? It certainly does cost a lot more than it would in Baudette, but that alone certainly isn't shady behavior. We Canucks are used to the gov't ripping us off in the form of overtaxation. Over $1 per gallon of our gas is tax. As a winter resident of Rainy River, I would hate to see the town get a bad name over a misunderstanding of some kind, if that in fact is how it turned out. If it was something else, I could certainly discuss that with the owner of the station so that it never happens again.Please expand on your comments so we can get to the bottom of this."
1383885,Obabikon,2012-01-20 07:18:00,2370,"I'm going to agree with Justin on this. Gas in Canada is incredibly overpriced. However, that is not the fault of the gas station owners. It's a small operation, but from what I know, an honest one. For those traveling to areas without fishing licenses, they sell them there."
1383898,jimirjr,2012-01-20 08:01:00,1149,"Thanks Guys for your insights. Coming up to the Souix Narrows area mid-September 2012. We usually come up from the Twin Cities area, this year we will drive direct form Denver, so will probably enter Ca. at Baudette.Guess we will supply up in Bimidji, I've been ther numerous times and it seems to have what we will need. Prices should be a little more consumer friendly, as well."
1383928,J-Man,2012-01-20 08:57:00,191,"Keep in mind that everything is relative to what you are used to. Bemidji and area is a major center for tourism and travellers as well so prices may not be what you would expect in cities either. I was in Fargo a few years ago ahead of a winter storm system to fly out from the airport and went to the walmart there for some snacks and munchies and noticed things as expensive or more than the prices in Winnipeg for the same items. With the exchange rate at that time, it was even more so. The only thing I would say about some places in Canada is to be careful of the rate of exchange for US currency. You can do much better exchanging money ahead of time vs paying what some places offer. That isn't true about all places, but some are that way.With fishing/hunting licenses and the very small margins allowed on them, they are often a cash only item so be prepared for that.The majority of places will try to get as close to the bank rate as possible without taking a chance of losing on the transaction....anything within 2-3% of what they would get at the bank would be reasonable.However, if they are getting .97 cents for a US dollar and are only giving you .90 cents, then they seems a bit like taking advantage in my opionon. If they are giving you .95 cents, then they are being reasonable to ensure they don't lose in case they can only get to the bank once per week."
