1383448,Guest,2012-01-18 20:50:00,0,Have always fished around Pickle Lake- looking to fish near border for less travel time. Thoughts on Young's Wilderness lodge on LOTW? Is there a best time of summer to fish there? Is this area crowdwd compared to other areas of LOTW's? Any other thoughts on LOTW's? thanks for the responses

Perry & Carol are GREAT people and the island camp is an excellent off the beaten path, secluded getaway with great fishing! We've been going for 20 straight years and I won't even consider going anywhere else! We go at the end of May, first of June each year and if we see half dozen boats (other than YWC boat) in a week's time it's rare! Accommodations are excellent, I can't say enough about how well they feed you, the boats are excellent and the staff are always friendly and helpful!! Here is a link to a video on YouTube that gives an excellent representation of a stay at YWC!!(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXDNB...eature=related)Can't go wrong checking them out!!"

A great wilderness setting with easy access (about 1-1/2 miles by boat) to car. I go the housekeeping route, prefer to cook own meals, but other guests rave about the camp meals. Carol is a very conscientious cook! I normally target crappies and walleyes, but many folks go strictly for muskie. Bill Krejca"

They made me a great deal on my son and i or we wouldnt have been able to go, then they treated us like we paid double!! The food was fantastic and the help were all great people. My son turned 16 while we were there and carol and gang made a small cake and sang happy birthday with all the other anglers, he will never forget it. As for the fishing we caught plenty of fish. Im not a huge walleye fisherman, prefer to cast for northerns and smallies. There are three bays almost within sight of our cabin that we spent most of our time in and we caught mid size northerns on every other cast all day. My son by accident did happen to catch two muskies which were really fun and i showed the video of this to the other anglers at dinner and we all had fun so i hope you get my point, great place, great people and great fishing.!"

Dock boys are always out rain or shine to help you in and out of the boat. Food is second to none. The first year up we brought snacks etc and didn't touch them. Oh yeah, their deluxe boats are very comfortable to stand and cast all day long. Even big guys like us have plenty of room. Fishing is really good. Dad and I mainly pound pike in new weed growth late May. Smallmouth are wonderful if it has warmed up by the time we are there. Crappie are plentiful again if we aren't too early. Lots of Muskie in Stevens Bay too. Walleye - we are usually too early for walleye so dont target them, but Perry should be able to show you the holes if you go up in the summer or fall. Easy 70 miles across the border and you are there. Best part about it is there aren't that many other boats that come in here. I would say you will see 2 to 4 none YWC boats each day so it does have the remote appeal. As the video will show you its a 5 minute smooth boatride from the landing to the island. Great place can't wait for another trip here."
1383686,Obabikon,2012-01-19 14:52:00,2370,Perry and Carol are a couple of my favorite people on the lake! You'd love it without a doubt.
