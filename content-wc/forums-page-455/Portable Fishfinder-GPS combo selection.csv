1384267,Seanik,2012-01-21 09:25:00,218,"I have been looking for the right portable fishfinder/gps combo unit for remote Ontario fly in lakes. This unit would be black & white to conserve power (200-300ma draw as oppose to a color unit 800+ma draw). Most of the units I looked at have a uni map that covers the USA only, the units with a card slot that uses navronics or lakemaster don't cover the small remote lakes that i usually fish. I don't need lake dept,ect. just good land definition. I have Garmins topo Canada 4 disk set and wonder it can be downloaded to any of these portable units. I contacted Garmin, Lowrance and Humminbird and didn't get a definitive answer from any of them. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated, the more I study this the more I become confused. Seanik"

The best info came from a place that specializes in marine electronics. They recommended separate units for fish finder and gps. Check out your local specialist and forget BassPro. You must have marine electronics places in Erie or Cleveland. The fishing shows will be starting soon, as well."
1384349,Shellback,2012-01-21 15:05:00,8083,Garmin sells an SD card with Ontario lakes. Here's a link for the list. http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/i...ts/Ontario.pdf Garmin has several handhelds that will work with the chip. Then go with a small portable F/F.
1384434,keek,2012-01-21 18:59:00,1003,Like Shellback I would recommend two separate units. For the GPS I would say get the Delorme PN-60. You can use the Navionics SD card or you can download Canadian Topo maps for it as well. For the sonar I would get the Piranha Max 170. I have both the PMax 170 and the Delorme and I like them both. For the compact sonar units used on fly-ins google search kayak sites for some info. Kayak users mainly install the compact units and they have very good reviews on the features and pros/cons of the different units. Below is one of the better sites. http://www.kayakbassfishing.com/
1384435,keek,2012-01-21 19:02:00,1003,For the last two years I've fished an area that wasn't on the Navionics Canada chip. Having the Canadian Topo maps downloaded onto my handheld was a HUGE bonus as I navigated the many miles of very complex waterways.
