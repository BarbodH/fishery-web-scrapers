Monument Bay to the north, Johnson Passage area, Tug Channel, all of Sabakosing Bay, and all the area west again to Blackhawk Island are all prime areas for multspiecies fishing. You won't be disapointed. I would guess that the owners would give you tips on the good fishing spots. As with any area that you fish for the first time, it would be smart to hire a guide for a day or two to show you some hot spots and presentations that are catching fish! Good luck. Marv"
