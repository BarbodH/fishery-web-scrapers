1075313,cspierings,2009-01-22 12:31:00,230,"Thinking about changing things up a bit this year and maybe saving some drive time versus heading up to Lac Seul besides the last couple years on LS haven't been all that impressive. We are considering trying LOTW. I've fished it once before from a houseboat. It was fun but very expensive. We are looking to try to get into more than just walleyes with a number of us really fired up about trying to pick up Crappie and maybe some Smallies plus decent walleye fishing. Is that possible on Lake of the Woods? If it is possible can you recommend and area and or place to stay. We would bring in our own boats. I would be bringing a 13 year old and 10 year old with me. The other boat would have two adults or maybe two adults and one 14 year old. We can cook for ourselves so I'm leaning more toward a housekeeping plan rather than something where the costs go way up but they cook for us. Thanks, Chris"
1075326,Flip Silverlake,2009-01-22 13:47:00,645,"I have fished LOTW from Sioux Narrows to Kenora and found we have had the best luck, or it's been most productive nroth of Sunset Channel. The water seems darker and day time fishing is easier, at at least for me it is. We go up in June and stay through August. Walleye is king early in the year. You can't keep any Bass, I think, untill July but they are very aggressive in June if you don't mind putting them back into the water. You can just about catch anything in that north end area. The next question is how rustic do you want to get. There is at least one very inexpensie place that I know of and I also know of some fairly expensive resorts. Just to give you an idea how the fishing is in the Kenora area we were up there last year for 12 weeks and had fish every other meal for the whole time and put only 588 miles on the boat. That was GPS numbers. If you want some ideas send me an message and I can give you a couple of links to places up there. By the way we never went over limit so inorder to keep fishing we kept eating. Being U.S. the limits will, if your eating fish, will keep you on the water."
1075327,rpieske,2009-01-22 13:51:00,1276,"I think one of the best options for you on LOTW might be Miles Bay Camp. They are located in the heart of some great walleye and crappie action. The other might be Obabikong Bay Lodge (American Plan only). Crappie fishing there is really good. Here are the websites for these camps. Good Luck!http://www.rextoltonsmilesbaycamp.ca/http://www.obabikon.com/ I can suggest some others which may not have as good walleye fishing, but the muskie, northern and bass fishing might be better. One would be Canadian Haven and another Helliars Resort, both located in Nestor Falls, Ontario. Both are on the mainland and easy to reach. I live summers in Nestor Falls and am very familiar with both these camps. If you have any further questions, send me a personal message or email."
1075333,smallfry,2009-01-22 14:07:00,9,"I'd like to put my vote in for Spruce Island Camp. They're pretty much in the middle fo the lake, which gives you many options of where to fish without having to go very far.We've been going there for a long time now and can't imagine going anywhere else, always have a great time. Walleye fishing seems to be good all season long(we've gone at different times over the years but now fall works best for our group) of course somedays you gotta work'em a little more but have yet to be skunked, other days they're jumping in the boat. We don't fish for Crappy but I have seen them or what's left of them in the fish house, same with bass. We generaly go for walleye, northern and musky.The owners of the place are fantastic as are the staff, always willing to help and if your having trouble finding fish Harv and Paul will try and help you get into whatever your looking for on their maps...if your still having a hard time Paul will make the time to show you where to find em...no charge, now if he has time will fish with ya but usually will drive you around and show on the map where exactly you are and how you got there etc...The cabins are great each one is different, all have 3pc bathrooms, full kitchen, bedrooms and living room, deck, private dock, screen porch and an extra full size fridge on the porch for beer/ bait or extra groceries. One thing we love if you order beer through them which they basicly just pick up for you, they have it waiting in the fridge for when you arrive....nothing like a cold one waiting for you. You don't need to bring anything but food, fishing gear and clothes, towels (pending on time of year). We think the prices are fair but it is cheaper to bring your own boat.Again great fishing(in my book), great accomodations and great owners and staff who are always ready to do what they can to make your stay a great one. I know we're glad we found it, can ya tell.Happy to answer any questions if I can and if I can't just send them an email. Oh and we launch from Gills marina in Morson, it's about an hour from Baudette.www.spruceislandcamp.com"
1075337,rockpt,2009-01-22 14:35:00,589,"Grassy Narrows Lodge is also in Miles Bay. Nice boat-in resort with housekeeping or American Plan. Crappie in that area are scattered and hard to catch until fall. Good bass, walleye and muskie all season. Great location to fish Miles Bay, Sabaskong or go west to the islands on the east side of Little Traverse. Spruce Island is nice but it's way over by the NW Angle, on the Canadian side. Heckuva long boat ride from Morson, especially if it's your first time on LOTW. It's about 30 miles. Owners will come and get you though. The camps in Miles Bay are all about a 15-20 minute boat ride from Morson."
1075369,1shooter,2009-01-22 16:52:00,1493,I'll 2 nd that for Grassy Narrows. WE have been going ther for years and love it. The owners Betty and Jerry are great! (Betty is a little quiet though :-)www.morsonoutfitters.com/grassy
1075387,Wall-i-Lama,2009-01-22 18:09:00,1524,"Chris, We have had a great deal of luck with Tomahawk Resort and RV Campground. We drive up in our motor home for 2 to 3 weeks each year. Based near Sioux Narrrows. Fishing is very good. We do boat out quite a ways each day (at least 15 miles) , but we just like to get away from the crowds. Flip is right, good walleye fishing north of sunset channel. Last July, we clobbered the walleye, did OK on crappie and northern fishing was good. My son caught a 40"" there. We don't fish a lot for Smallies, but I've seen others there that fish them a lot and do real well. Most of all the resort is very clean, maintained and organized. You will not find any nicer dock facility in the area. My two boys like the beach and swimming dock, and the paddle boat. Never stayed in the cabins, but they are very nice. They don't offer food service. Good luck on your trip!http://www.tomahawkresort.com/ Jerry"
1075391,Obabikon,2009-01-22 18:39:00,2370,"Obabikon isn't American plan only, but our housekeeping fills up fast, and we only have one week in July and a couple weeks in August left. However, we have the best crappie fishing on the lake. That said... Miles Bay Camp is a wonderful family run resort Grassy Narrows is also a good choice... they own Tamarak too which is house keeping Sabaskong Bay and Black Island are all excellent resorts. Anyhow, send me a PM if you'd like more detailed info send a pm. But, I highly suggest the Morson area... you avoid the heavy traffic of the big cities, and you can skip the International Falls crossing all together (go to Baudette)... plus, less drive time from the states... win/win/win situation"
1077226,Obabikon,2009-01-30 07:14:00,2370,"If you're going out of Morson, any guide with the last name Gibbons or Gibbins (they're the same family spelled differently, lol) is gonna put you on the fish. Jason, Oliver, and Rueben are all three brothers. John is there uncle. All four have been on the lake their whole life, and 3 are professional fishermen."

1384442,Obabikon,2012-01-21 19:24:00,2370,"Spring.... late may/early june. If you wait until July, you'll probalby be fishing more Miles Bay area that Sab..."
1075489,Flip Silverlake,2009-01-23 08:21:00,645,This is very true. If the weather goes south you really need to get very creative because a quick trip into town is not a real option. All the stuff in the Kenora area are drive in camps that I was talking about.
1075530,Dan G,2009-01-23 11:31:00,31,"Chris:I know Lake of the Woods well out of the Sioux Narrows area. One of the other writers is correct on bass....no bass may be taken from June 1 - 30. They do bite well during this time-frame, however you cannot keep them. If you have a number of guys looking for crappie, I have found later in the season....mid-August on to be best. You will even have lots of bass action then too. Of course, walleye are never a problem anytime you choose to fish LOTW....weather simply determines the depth. Pike and muskie can be caught all summer long.....have often had fantastic pike and muskie fishing just trying to catch June shallow water walleye! My personal best month for numbers of fish and largest walleye, northern, and smallie has been August. The dog days of summer do not happen on LOTW. Can get warm...but the fish bite RARELY slows.My plug for a good place to stay is Red Indian Lodge in Sioux Narrows. I stay there and like it. Both American Plan and Housekeeping."
1075767,smallfry,2009-01-24 13:55:00,9,"Yes Spruce Island Camp is a bit of a hike especialy if your new to the lake. But a good map and gps you'll do fine. The owners will come and get you and you can follow them out for no charge ,if you arrange to do so when they are picking up another group and you don't put anything in their boat(what we did the first trip).I have nothing against the other resorts mentioned and can offer no advice about them as I have never stayed there. One of the reasons we like Spruce so much is because of where it is, there are no other immediate resorts near by, the fishing pressure is rather low unlike Miles Bay where you have a number of resort quite near one another. We do see other boats but they generaly are just passing through. There are days where we don't see another boat until we get back to camp where other guest's have docked their boats. Their prices aren't listed on the website, don't know why..... but they really are a fair price and cheaper than some of the other resorts on the lake. Our bill is generally under 2 grand and we stay for 5 days in the fall. Wherever you decide to go I hope you and your sons have a great time."
1075825,Red Tail Chub,2009-01-24 21:02:00,17,"I second Spruce Island Camp. We went there for the first time last august and we loved it. I can't really think of anything that was not to like about the place. We also brought our own boat and I feel that it is pretty inexpensive. Just arrange to follow the camp boat in if they are picking up others and then save the trail on your gps and you are good to go. It seems a bit daunting at first, but once you do it you will be glad you did. Very unique experience and good people to boot."
1076023,Guest,2009-01-25 18:17:00,0,i'd vote for miles bay camp. been there for 25 years. great spot great fishing.
1076318,1shooter,2009-01-26 21:02:00,1493,How long of boat ride is it from Morson to Spruce Island Camp?
1076332,smallfry,2009-01-26 23:13:00,9,"Morson to Spruce Island is about 30 miles and depending on boat/motor size can take 45min to an hour. If the water is rough and you need to slow down, it will take longer. Little Traverse tends to be the worst spot for the most part if it's rough.I forgot to mention that you can also launch from the NW Angle, I think from there its about 20min to 1/2 hr, just don't forget to check into Canada."
1076490,rockpt,2009-01-27 12:26:00,589,"It's on the NW side of McPherson Island, near the southern entrance to Tug Channel. Nice camp, well maintained. Just a long boat ride from Morson and if there's a strong wind from the south to SW, could be tough getting in or out of camp."
1076897,Davis Viehbeck,2009-01-29 06:07:00,48,Try contacting Lake of the Woods guide Jeff 'Gussy' Gustafson. Gussy lives just west of Kenora at Clearwater Bay and can put you on all the fish you mentioned. His website is www.gussyoutdoors.com -Davis Viehbeck
1077076,Chris K,2009-01-29 16:05:00,278,"As far as a guide goes on Lake of the Woods, I will second the opinion on heading out with Jeff Gustafson. His multi-species knowledge is impressive, and he will put you on fish you are looking for in any season. Chris K"
1075400,Guest,2009-01-22 19:16:00,0,"I would also recommend Obabikon. I have not been there for the past 3 years due to family obligations but I went there as a kid and went for about 10 straight years the first week in October. I also would take my sons and nephews in August when they offered father/son packages. Equipment is good, lodging is decent with a decent shower in each cabin, food is excellant (even though Larry gets a little crazy with ONIONS) but probably the best thing about it is the location. It is situated in the middle of everything. It is a short, sheltered boat ride to the Obabikon where you can get walleye, crappie, smallies and northerns and muskies. Or, it is a short ride to Miles Bay or straight across from Burrows bay. I have not stayed there since Jarret took over but it has surely improved. Steve was the previous owner and even though he ran a good camp with decent equipment, his personality was less than radiant. I don't think you could go wrong with the Obabikon and you will have a great time."
1075457,lotw53,2009-01-23 06:23:00,1,most of the posts were for boating to resorts i have done this for my first 3 years going to canada and found this expensive and inconvenient as far as bringing boating in alot of supplies try myliesplace in morson drive to resort check out there websight and weekly costs and compare rates there a familly run resort very well kept up justin ellen and daryl will treat you well you mentioned crappies they seem to be hard to find during spring and summer not many try to target them till mid sept and into oct are the best times. smallie fishing is good and walleye fishing is good also most posts mentioned miles bay area which is a very good area but also the basin area just to the west of myliesplace is a great area for walleyes and smallies. myliesplace is very centrally located for many parts of the lake so all the areas mentioned are accessible other areas to try are the basil channel not many people mention this area for walleyes but can be very good and of course little traverse to the west is another great area and a nice boat ride that everyone should try to appreciate the beauty of lake of the woods
