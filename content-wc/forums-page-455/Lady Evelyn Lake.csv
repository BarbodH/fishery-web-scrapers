1361799,Dislocated,2011-10-31 12:46:00,27,Almost forgot. The Walleye fishing was slow for all of the folks in camp with us last summer. Our group ended up being the most successful and it was due to trolling #5 and #7 Shadraps in Firetiger over the channel (river) transition points (along the rise). I know that each and every week is different but it did prove successful for us.
1383351,Guest,2012-01-18 16:31:00,0,"Late last june, our group, six of us, traveled to lady evelyn lake. Quite a ride as we live in the Philadelphia area. It was the first time for us and we found Ken and the staff to be exceptional hosts. The adventure of getting there, and the beauty of the lake are part of the charm of Lady Evelyn. We did hit a situation that portends tough fishing. We had a full moon and a week of east winds. From what we learned from the oldtimers it was a nontypical poor week of fishing. We are not new to fishing walleye, having fished Cabonga in Quebec for many years, as well as some other gems. I was fortunate to be the one in our party to catch several large walleye in the 24 to 30 inch category. Not bad for an off week. We learned quickly where to catch eater size walleye and our group is returning again in late june this year. I explored a large part of this beautiful lake and I'm lookintg forward to our return trip and a WEST WIND. Now that we're more familiar with Lady Evelyn we'll be doing shore lunches and a side trip for lakers. hope all who go have a great trip."
1383489,fishincrazy,2012-01-19 06:13:00,1282,I live in the Philly area also and have fished Lady Evelyn since the early 90's.I love this lake and the potential of cow size walleye!We have also had some success on the smallmouth bass.There are some real monster bass in this water!We like to drift fish and with structure abounding in this system you can drift just about anywhere.We normally go the 3rd week of August but this year we are going the last week of July.We stay at Garden Island.FC
1265663,phitans,2011-01-28 09:49:00,21,"Hello,My wife and I are going to Island 10 the 3rd week of July this year and I am wondering if anyone has been there in that time period. I've never been up there and I was wondering what to expect from the fishing and the lodge.We plan on fishing for Walleyes and Pike. My wife does not fish very much and I would like to get her on some fish. Any help is greatly appreciated! I have ordered maps and will study them to hopefully get some starting points and familiarize myself with the lake. Hopefully, when we get there we will be pointed in the right direction from the people at Island 10.thanks again,JH"
1265848,phishfearme,2011-01-28 20:51:00,1242,you need to do a search on this site concerning this lake - it may be a poor first experience for her - you may want to consider elsewhere. phish
1265850,Rich B,2011-01-28 20:55:00,1081,"JH, You and your wife will enjoy Lady Lake Evelyn.....and the Island 10 camp is very nice....I've been there over the years, and at another camp on the lake. For pulling eaters, the camp will probably have you fish the flats they call the ""Supermarket"" which isn't far from camp.....be sure to make a run to ""4 corners"" early in the week if it's not too windy, and you should find some nice sized fish there (though getting a bite some days is tough) - I like 4 corners as it has a current, and you'll find a hump coming out of deep water on the southwestern area of 4 corners that I've pulled nice walleyes (up to 7+ lbs) along with smallies, etc....other guys have pulled 12 lb eyes from this area, though done so in the fall. PM me if you want more info......also, run a search on walleye central for Lady Lake Evelyn, and you'll see other regulars here also fish the lake - you'll enjoy your trip in to camp (and around the dam)....it's a neat adventure. Have a good trip. Rich B"
1266020,adempsey,2011-01-29 14:13:00,963,"I think it's a great lake to fish. I have been twice, once in July at Island 10 and once in August at Garden Island. The fishing was good and seemed similar both times. You wont' have problems finding walleye. You will have to search for the pike and smallies though. There are places you can have 100 fish days (smaller eater walleye) and if you try for the big ones, they are in there.I will try to find a map and mark some spots on it for you.As for the lodge, it's nice. We had bad mosquitoes for a couple of nights when we were there. They can get in through the spaces between the logs in the cabins. Bring mosquito netting if you have it - although I would probably just call and ask how bad they are beforehand so you don't have to worry about bringing it. The boats were great and service was good. Plenty of food and sweets to eat. Not much else to do though, besides fish. So hopefully your wife likes to sit on the cabin deck and read or something if she's not out in the boat. It's truly a beautiful lake, especially considering it's only a 6 hour drive for me. There are plenty places to just go explore the lake and enjoy the environment. You won't likely see many people.Cheers!"
1266027,PMcDonald,2011-01-29 14:29:00,1,"JH,My friends and I will be at Island 10 the week of July 16th. When we booked the owner said contact him a week before you go and he will tell you what the Walleye are biting on. This year I think we are going to listen to what the lodge owner has to say because they usually know!PM"
1266034,adempsey,2011-01-29 15:04:00,963,"I don't think the methods differ much when it comes to walleye fishing, it's more about where they are. Ken keeps a log of the big ones, so you should flip through that for some hints when you get there.At that time of year, you should do well with lindy rigs or bottom bouncers in 6-12 FOW in the morning and evenings. During the day you might want to go to 12-30 FOW - and if you want the big ones, you might try trolling.White and/or pink grubs work well. I have done well with cranks in the morning/evenings too - X-raps, Thinfins, Hot'n'Tots....plenty will work. The biggest walleye (31"") of the week last time I was there was caught (not by me) trolling a Storm Magwart in 30FOW.Cheers!"
1266038,phitans,2011-01-29 15:08:00,21,Thank you everyone for all of the information! I can't wait to go.JH
1361415,KJF1812,2011-10-29 09:04:00,2,"JH, How was your trip? We are set to go for the first time to Island 10 next June (2012). We usually go to Callander Bay on Nippissing but trying something new. Thanks, KF"
1361622,Dislocated,2011-10-30 16:01:00,27,"JH,Was at Lady Evelyn this past summer. All points so far are good but there are things that you can do around the lake besides fishing if your wife wants. At the far south end of ""The Freeway"" (west of White Fish Bay) there are a series of waterfalls that are a very easy hike. Small Speckled Trout are catchable (got three myself). A more challenging hike is up to the firetower on the far western edge of the lake in the conservation area. Round trip from where you drop the boat and start canoeing is 7 miles, and an additional 2.2 miles of hiking. Verticle gain is over 1200 feet but the entire lake is viewable from the tower. I have heard that there are Northern Pike in the small connecting lakes but neglected to bring tackle with me. Couple of beaver dams will need to be portaged but it was an awesome trip. If you do it, bring a knife so you can carve your initials inside the firetower as many hundreds of people have done before us."
