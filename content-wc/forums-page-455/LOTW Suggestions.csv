1383880,Obabikon,2012-01-20 07:13:00,2370,"I would suggest Obabikon www.obabikon.com We're an american plan resort... same cook for 30+ years. Awesome small mouth and muskie fishing within sight of the camp. Almost no traffic around us. That said, feel free to send me a PM, and I will make several suggestions of great places in our area. Someone mentioned Tamarak, and I had the pleasure of meeting Todd. He's a very good person, and will run an excellent operation."
1383986,Tamarack,2012-01-20 10:50:00,16,"Hello, my name is Todd, my wife Kim and I are the new owners of Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge. Our camp offers excellent fishing for Muskie as well as great fishing for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. Our Lodge is quite remote and in close proximity to great fishing. From our location you can get out and fish no matter which way the wind is blowing. We are about a 20 minute boat ride from Hanson Bay. Hanson Bay is just North of Morson which is about a 45 minute drive from Beadette MN. Our camp is mostly a housekeeping camp although we do offer some American Plan. Most of our customers prefer the housekeeping plan because they are not tied down to a schedule and can fish, eat, sleep when they want to. All of our cabins have BBQ's and six of the eight have their own kitchens. Thanks Jered for your kind words, I would also suggest checking him out at Obabikan Bay Camp as well as my old friends Betty and Jerry Fisher from Grassy Narrows Lodge. Both of these are well kept camps out of Morson as well and do more of the American Plan thing.Todd"
1382783,NP4ME,2012-01-14 12:16:00,378,"Guys, Looking at the possibility of doing a LOTW trip this year...our group has never been. We will primarily be targeting muskie and smallies, but also would like to catch some walleye and northern. We want a lodge that offers an American plan and that is remote as possible, but don't want to have an hour boat ride to get to good waters. Any help or suggestions is much appreciated. NP"

1382888,bellbuoy,2012-01-14 17:35:00,490,"Witch Bay, six to seven miles back off the highway, no other resorts close. Service and amenities are great. Steve & Gail are always putting $ back into the camp. Try to have their son Adam take you out if you're looking for muskie and tell him to take a 17"" smallmouth for bait. He'll know what that means."
1382998,balsl6,2012-01-17 20:07:00,426,I would suggest the NW Angle area of the lake. It is not as crowded and seems more remote than the the majority of the lake. Many great resorts that can accommodate many various needs and wants.www.lakeofthewoodsresorts.com/ Good luck and have a great time where ever you go!

1383201,NP4ME,2012-01-18 10:51:00,378,I guess my previous post was deleted. Does anyone have any information about Crow Rock or Tamarack Wilderness Lodge? Thanks for the help.
1383248,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-18 12:21:00,320,"Tamarack ( www.tamarackwildernesslodge.com ) will be under new management for the 2012 season. The resort was purchased from Morson Outfitters that also owned Grassy Narrows Lodge in Miles Bay. It is now owned by Todd and Kim Hacault. After talking to Todd at the Chicago All Canada Show, I believe they will be updating the property over the next few years and he has quite a good vision of what he wants the camp to be. Tamarack is situated 4 to 5 miles west of Gill's Marina in Hanson's Bay. (Morson) That location has great fishing for all spiecies and is in close proximity to Basil Channel, Painted Rock Island, Splitrock Island, Sunset Chain Channel, with loads of islands and reefs close by. Crow Rock Lodge ( www.crowrock.com ) is located about 8 miles south of Kenora on Crow Rock Island. Have never fished that portion of LOTW but can tell you there litterally are hundreds of islands and reefs within a mile or two and I don't believe that wind would ever be much of a factor. Whatever wind you encounter, you could avoid easily if you wanted to! Marv"
