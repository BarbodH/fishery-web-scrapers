Mid-week check in flight and fishing was excellent on the two lakes (one was short walk). Great cabin, fine week!"

The cabins are comparable, but the size of the lakes and the fishing is unbelievable. We have fished with Twin Lakes Outfitters and Arctic Watershed Outposts. Both offer an excellent bang for your buck and truly fantastic fishing."
