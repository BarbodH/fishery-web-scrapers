1347624,CI_Guy,2011-09-07 16:05:00,2118,"ChadJulius, I have to agree that the navionics map is off on the depth of several areas on Minnitaki. When I contacted them they said the info came from the Ontario and Canadian government geological surveys. We got a very accurate contour map at one of the bait shops in Sioux Lookout. It has the navigable channels mapped out pretty well. Don't remember the name of the shop but it is on the main drag across from the thrift store."
1347817,tv4fish,2011-09-08 07:57:00,2694,"Chief: Since we were just up there - I will offer this: We found most of the walleyes in 25-30 feet and in ""mid-lake"" reefs/humps. They had moved from the typical island points or their earlier shallower locations. We caught them both by jigging crawlers/leeches and also using Lindy rigs. We marked a LOT of fish at the 35-40 foot depths and I asked John at Red Pine if these were lake trout - John said they were probably whitefish and NOT lake trout. He thought that the lake trout were more than likely at the 50-60 foot depth at this time of year. Best of luck."
1347989,Chief Diggity,2011-09-08 18:10:00,3,Thanks tv4fish I will for sure hit up those humps! I guess I will have to try some vertical jigging for the lake trout...I don't have downriggers!
1347990,Chief Diggity,2011-09-08 18:12:00,3,I'll post my results when I get back from the trip and thanks again.
1383055,contrail,2012-01-17 23:52:00,59,"Thats the rock that GFish is talking about. We had just fished our way through Harveys and were running to Troutfish and I caught the breakers going over the rocks. There is some old cable or rebar sticking up from it, but deep water right up to it. There is no way that you could see it coming by a depth change on the locator."
1335838,Cash,2011-07-31 12:14:00,73,"I just booked a trip for 3rd week of June 2012. I used to fish this lake back in the 80's. Quit going all together for a few years, then went to Lac Suel for a few years. Anyways, how has the lake changed in the last 25 years. We will be staying at Pickerel Arm Camp. We used to fish at Moonlight Falls, Red Pine Bay etc. Are they still good spots? I'll be taking my kids (18 & 13) for their 1st trip to the North Woods and I want it to be special."
1335928,Red Pine J,2011-07-31 17:17:00,44,"I havn't been to PAC for a couple of seasons, but, I stayed @ PAC from 1993-2009. In that time I'd say the fishing ( walleye ) has gotten better, and, I'd assume the slot limit is the biggest reason. Red Pine can still be good, along with the Rice River & English River. Never fished the East area of the lake, but, it sure is pretty up that way. Some years, one does not really have to leave the arm to find the fish. We started finding more & more gr8 smsallmouth fihin down thru the years. Tell Lee & Julie hi from .....John in Missouri. 3rd week should be gr8!!!!!!!!"

1336836,Guest,2011-08-03 08:55:00,0,"The 3rd week of June you can't miss, should be absolute best time, especially considering that English River and Rice River are open, and you can keep fish in Redpine. This year there were many walleyes still shallow 10 ft or less, especially in weed beds, when we were there the 4th week of June. There were few boats out on the main lake, which tells me people were catchin em just fine inside Pickerel Arm. I stay at Timber Edge Camp on Butterfly Lake, have never been inside Pickerel Arm except to return some lost souls who went out onto the main lake without a map. We went down to Redpine one day and slammed big walleyes one after another, every bottom-bouncing run we got a 20+ incher. I have been told by old-timers that the fishin there is better now than it ever has been. We do much better now than when we started in 2002, especially in terms of large walleyes, altho much of that is the fact that we now are going in June instead of August. This year in June it was actually challenging to catch the 16 to 18 inchers to take home, many fish were in or over the slot. Many of the fish that were over the slot had obviously been caught previously and released, based on slits cut in the webbing of their fins from being netted. This means people are voluntarily releasing fish over the slot, which is bound to help keep the fishin great."
1337254,Cash,2011-08-04 11:01:00,73,Thanks for the info guys. It's exactly what I was hoping for. Walleyes in 10' of water is the can't miss action I am hoping my kid's will get to experience.
1337770,RoughWaters,2011-08-05 19:51:00,98,"I've fished Minnitaki over the last 10 years out of Donnelly's and the fishing has been very good. The slot limit has produced many large, healthy fish (22-25 inches). The traditional areas such as Red Pine bay, southwest bay, moonlight falls, etc. are all good placed to fish. Providing the weather if stable your week of fishing should be great, we are going back the third week of June 2012, see you there."
1337865,gfish,2011-08-06 09:32:00,23,"We fished Minnitaki last week of June this year, and found fish best on humps initially, then went to windswept reefs after getting a good west wind for a while. There is great action at Abrams chutes a couple hours before dusk with jigs. Also, check out the English River for good action on smaller fish. We found bigger fish in 35 FOW, and landed 2 lake trout in 45-55 ft. Get a good lake map with navigational markers - there were several buoys missing from the lake that previously marked rocks."
1338984,Guest,2011-08-10 09:02:00,0,"Agree about the map. There is a big rock on the eastern part of the main lake between Harvey's Narrows and the islands just south of the mouth of Troutfish Bay, about 200 yds out from the north shoreline, used to have a big green buoy on it, now it is not marked at all. The water around it is quite deep, would not expect a rock there. I also hit a rock right in the middle of the narrows leading into the northern and western bays of Troutfish, it was marked with a white jug but there were whitecaps and I could not pick out the jug in the whitecaps. This rock is marked on the maps, shoulda paid more attention to my map, especially since I don't go that way very often. I usually stay in the middle of such channels, this time that's where the rock was."
1339128,ChadJulius,2011-08-10 16:05:00,5,Where is a good place to get a detailed map of the lake? We used the map that the camp gave us which left a lot to be desired. Nothing was named and there wasn't much detail. Our navionics map didn't have the best detail either and some of the depths were way off.
1347602,Chief Diggity,2011-09-07 15:04:00,3,"Hey I was just wondering how the walleyes behave on this lake in mid September, what are some of the common tactics used to catch them and also depths and structures they prefer? I will be staying at Frog Rapids then so I will be fishing Minnitaki much of the time. Also I know it depends on the weather but how shallow are the lake trout running usually that time of year? Thanks"
