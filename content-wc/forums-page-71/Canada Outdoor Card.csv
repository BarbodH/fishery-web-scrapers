6581338,RichA$1970,2021-07-21 12:23:00,1159,Curious as my 3 year Canada Outdoor Card expired last year if they are “grandfathering” another year or if I need to order one for my September trip?
6581342,Obabikon,2021-07-21 12:26:00,2370,I can't imagine them not requiring a new one.

6581356,eyecatcher1,2021-07-21 12:38:00,323,FYI Last year was the middle year of my Outdoor Card and license. When I heard that refunds were being given I called. I was told that since I could have ice fished before the border closed I would not get a refund. The refunds were for a license not an Outdoor Card.
6581358,Bstar,2021-07-21 12:41:00,564,Get a new card they cost less than $10

6581672,Carnhzkr,2021-07-22 06:55:00,964,"Evidently, you haven't read the post about ""Bait"". Crawlers will no longer be allowed into Canada. The only purpose for your long slimy things is to make your yard difficult to mow."
