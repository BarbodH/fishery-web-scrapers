6581640,Hookhunter75,2021-07-22 05:22:00,60,I think the crazy thing to think about is the volume of people crossing the border is not going to be as high one would expect and I think Canada knows that. Only 50 percent of our entire population is fully vaccinated. At its highest point of tourism Canada was seeing 15 million cross the border annually. So now of that 50 percent vaccinated what percent of them is part of the Canadian tourism group and of that 50 percent who would not be hesitant to travel. I think there will be some congestion but I don’t think the volume is enough to even give a rip about.
6581704,emma17,2021-07-22 08:12:00,436,I understand your point on this. I'd just add that the vaccination rate for the age of people that are the likely fishermen to be crossing the border is certainly much higher than 50%.
6581772,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 10:39:00,3685,"Maybe only people from WC will be crossing,so all of you don't show up at the border at the same time."
6582568,elway12,2021-07-23 22:26:00,335,I.M.O. I also think that it won't be as bad crossing the border as some speculate. It probably/might will take a bit longer to pass thru the border but the amount of people actually going into Canada will be greatly reduced.

6581502,Guest,2021-07-21 16:56:00,0,This does not apply to US citizens.
6581536,TritonEbbs,2021-07-21 18:08:00,16,Canada BoardCan someone post something from the US government showing where they will allow US citizens back from Canada using a land crossing? I have been looking all day and can’t seem to find evidence we will be allowed back in? My cabin in NW Ontario needs me to spend multiple weeks fishing ThanksEbbs
6581538,Hookhunter75,2021-07-21 18:14:00,60,I called a port of entry and spoke with Customs for confirmation. It’s tough to find so I confirmed that way
6581544,Eckohlt,2021-07-21 18:22:00,3685,"If the usa locks you out from returning don't wry,you won't run out of fish and besides that it's healthy for you,I'm hoping I get locked into Ontario until freeze up."
6581550,hoppy63,2021-07-21 18:41:00,367,I did post on the thread talking about returning. I talked to US customs and was told US citizens traveling by land have NO...... ZERO restrictions returning to US
6581562,Riding high,2021-07-21 18:51:00,69,Returning to USA hand them your passport answer the questions and drive on thats it. No restrictions!
6581564,hoppy63,2021-07-21 18:54:00,367,Amen!
6581586,Obabikon,2021-07-21 20:14:00,2370,The United States can neverâ¦ And I mean neverâ¦ Prevent a US citizen from entering the United States.
6581590,SweetD,2021-07-21 20:20:00,243,If this variant thing continues to blow up won’t have to worry about returning!!!!
