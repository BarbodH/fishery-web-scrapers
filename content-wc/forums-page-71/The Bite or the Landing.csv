6582366,emma17,2021-07-23 12:44:00,436,"Now that we have real reason to be excited about fishing Canadian waters, I got to thinking about the bite vs landing the fish. I'm not sure how to phrase the question so I'll just use the scenario we all know. You cast the line, slow retrieve through some light weeds, and then the tap that causes you to pause, hold your breath (as though the fish could hear us), gently tighten the line hoping for that tell tale double tap and then the line starts moving. The anxious moment of when to set the hook. And bam, the fish is off the line. Or, bam, it's a good hook set and you land the fish. When looking back on a day on the water, how important is landing the fish when it comes to judging the day? Could you miss every fish but still have a great/successful day because you were on the fish and had all those bite moments? Assuming of course you weren't counting on a fish dinner for survival."
6582374,Hwy101,2021-07-23 13:17:00,18,I pinch down the barbs on all the jigs and rarely use lures with treble hooks. If we can get the fish up to the side of the boat to be netted it counts. My hands get so ripped up over the course of a week I am fine letting fish shake off without any contact. Bonus is that you can now estimate the size of the fish to your boat partner.
6582406,stjoeguy,2021-07-23 14:17:00,979,"No, I couldn't miss every fish and still call it a good day. We also use barbless hooks and count fish as caught when we get it up to the surface (or close enough to identify if it's been a slow day). So I don't mind not landing some, but all day would be too much. For me the best part is the initial tap and hook set, however."

6582806,kzoofisher,2021-07-24 16:25:00,5144,"Yeah, this. Missing them all would be too much, a few is no big deal, but no question the strike is the best moment."

6582982,fishin779,2021-07-25 10:04:00,63,I tell my wife that sometimes catching fish gets in the way of fishing
6583048,emma17,2021-07-25 12:32:00,436,"That's funny and at times true. Yesterday I was getting my wife's jigging pole ready while she took inventory of our Canada bins. We got the idea to relive the feeling of the bite- so we took turns holding the rod while the other mimicked a nibbling fish at the hook. As I recall, felt like the real thing. Man we can't wait to get back at it."
