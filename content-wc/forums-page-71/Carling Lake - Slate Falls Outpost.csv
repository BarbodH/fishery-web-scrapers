6581222,Hillbiehle,2021-07-21 09:05:00,66,We will be going to Carling Lake via Slate Falls Outpost. Sounds like the walleye fishing is great (as expected) and has lake trout as well which is something that I've become more and more interested in and enjoying. I would be interested in hearing from others that have been to Carling.
6581458,Skywagon,2021-07-21 15:25:00,1106,"I flew in to the cabin you will be staying in on Carling, when it was for sale 4-5 years ago. It was a fairly new cabin at the time, I would guess that Slate Falls has done some improvements since then, including a nice solar setup including the fridge. There is only one other outpost cabin on the lake, so my guess is that this year you will have the lake to yourselves. I have not fished the lake, but it has been on my radar to trout fish in the winter sometime. Be prepared for some possible smoky days while you are there, it is very dry in that area, lots of fires."

Ryan will take care of you and treat you well. We’ve been to Miniss with them a couple of times and we’re going to their Arc Lake Outpost Aug 14-21.

6582158,Bstar,2021-07-23 05:16:00,564,Will do
6582372,gordy28,2021-07-23 13:03:00,437,So I can't comment on Carling either but can echo what was said about Slate Falls. We loved our trip with them last summer enough that we booked with them for 2022 Ryan is great and loves to fish. I am sure he will give you good direction on where to start Cheers and have an awesome trip Andrew
