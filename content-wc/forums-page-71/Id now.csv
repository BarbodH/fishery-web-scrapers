Genetic Testing COVID-19 Testing Infectious Disease Testing Company Abbott ID NOW Rapid Molecular Test (NAAT) I would hate to get to the border and they say only the PCR test is valid. What say you OBABIKON??? You seem to be pretty proactive. Thansk ahead of time.

Also, forgot to ask how much so if you know please share."
