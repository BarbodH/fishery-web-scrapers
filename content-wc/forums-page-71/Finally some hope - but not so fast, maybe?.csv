I can't believe how many guests wanted us to hold their spot in the event that the border OPENS! (in which we were happy to do so). We have made numerous updates to our Facebook page sharing that we thought that July was only a chance; August was a possibility and September is a good chance. We were working hard and would be ready for everyone when the border does open. Each time we would share, please let us know if you are planning on your 2021 reservations - rolling it over to 2022 - or receiving a 50% deposit back (this fall) with a voucher for the other 50% good for 3 years. Each time a few would let us know, but most still held their dates and hoped to come, At LEAST WE THOUGHT! These past two days many have made other plans, without letting us know that they no longer intended on making their trip this year. SOOOO, PLEASE let your Outfitter know ASAP if you have made OTHER plans. With understanding, letting your Outfitter know right away will be much better for everyone. Especially for Outfitters, losing most of 2020 and 2021 seasons is hard enough on all of us, let alone calling our guests only to find out today that some have moved on for 2021 without sharing this with us/their Outfitter. Most of us really don't need more disappointment right now with only 8 weeks left this season. I just wanted to share what we and/or some Outfitters could or might be experiencing during this HOPEFUL TIMES. Remember being there for us will help us to be there for you in 2022!"
