6582570,elway12,2021-07-23 22:32:00,335,"I would think anywhere would be ""better"" than FF/International Falls. I personally like the Pigeon River border crossing. However, I think the amount of people trying to cross will be way down/lower compared to a ""regular"" years during August & September."
6582172,Wallychowder,2021-07-23 06:00:00,1567,"I think alot of folks will sit this one out , and wait for the smoke to clear.....so to speak !"
6582182,fishin779,2021-07-23 06:21:00,63,"If it's dark and a little""short"" from all the driving, then is that still indecent exposure ? Just curious ! LOL"

6582240,jambi,2021-07-23 08:05:00,504,Is Baudette going to be a better option that Intl Falls?
6582252,Eckohlt,2021-07-23 08:17:00,3685,"Good idea,your right this may be the year it gets used bill,rod"
6582254,mswope13,2021-07-23 08:17:00,73,"I'm thinking the border crossing will be a log jam. Called multiple hotels for 8/8 stay, first 2 were booked solid, last one I tried in Rainer had 2 rooms left. Camp owner did say they are far from filled for that first short week however."
6582256,Yellowfin123,2021-07-23 08:18:00,2182,"its really easy, just open a car door and just act like your messin with the door trim or somethin. the key is to always keep both hands in the air"
6582354,pjshorthorn,2021-07-23 12:05:00,5654,You sound like you are a professional  urinator... PjShorthorn
6582368,Eckohlt,2021-07-23 12:57:00,3685,"Pj if your over 60 then your a pro also,that's a lot of peeing,you should have it down pat."

6581900,Wallychowder,2021-07-22 15:16:00,1567,"Now I'm going to stick by what i said about very long lines waiting to cross into Canada...........so i think That Minnesota Guy ought to set up a lemonade stand out in front of Border Bob's because it's probably going to be a scorcher the first couple weeks of August, and a freshly squeezed ice cold Lemonade would be NICE !"
6581942,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 16:38:00,3685,"The mn guy said the border would not open this year,so I don't think he has his lemonade ready for business.but mini doughnuts would be a big hit."
6581948,pjshorthorn,2021-07-22 16:45:00,5654,I heard he owns the new Dunkin Donuts that is opening up shortly in IFalls. Stop in and see him while you are sitting in line. They may let you use the restroom for a fee too.... PjShorthorn
6581956,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 16:56:00,3685,"It will be dark when I go through I don't need an indoor restroom,his parking lot"
6581982,pjshorthorn,2021-07-22 17:16:00,5654,"I’m pretty sure that you won’t make into Canada after urinating in front of everyone in line on both 53 and in a business’ parking lot. Last I heard, that is an arrestable offense for both public urination and indecent exposure. Good luck with that... PjShorthorn"
6581988,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 17:20:00,3685,I'll take my chances

6582164,djk50164,2021-07-23 05:26:00,370,"He is to busy setting up his house for a quarantine spot for all of you guys. I'm thinking the border won't be as bad as people think. People with some children will not be going because of the vax regulations, and some just decided to do other things. I am estimating 30% of normal?"
