6580734,troutwater,2021-07-20 07:36:00,299,Nice videos! Just curious Whats the water level and temps been like on the goon? I'm thinking about going there with my girlfriend when the border is open next month
6580750,Limeyangler,2021-07-20 08:15:00,563,"Thanks.The surface temps are surprisingly normal given the hot weather, yesterday was averaging 70F on the main basin areas. Shallower spots up to 74F. Water level is a different story…. She’s LOW! We had hardly any snow last winter and no rain(significant amounts) for months. Fishing is good though, pounding walleye on the reefs, especially reefs that top out between 6’ and 9’FOW and right on top too. Pike are in the weeds mostly, musky weeds too, bass on the reefs and rocks with some in the deeper weed lines…give me a shout when you’re up if ya like.Simon."
