6580168,NM_Trout,2021-07-19 07:29:00,1094,I could not find a reference to Rhuda lake as one of their outposts. Leuenberger's pops up on searches pretty easily though.https://fishingoutposts.com/listing/...ness-outposts/Edit... whoops... found it!https://fishingoutposts.com/listing/...on-rhuda-lake/

6580188,NM_Trout,2021-07-19 07:50:00,1094,Yes. My browser only showed a thumbnail and a link to a picture. Not much information to be had.
6580366,Fishquest,2021-07-19 14:17:00,89,"Hey Chris, I was on the lake and in the camp but never fished it. We stopped on route home from another lake of theirs's to check on the people in camp for the week. Had a quick chat with them about the lake and they said it was not a numbers lake but it was known for producing better than average fish. This was going back 10-15 years or so I can't remember how long ago could probably find out if I dig out the log book. I have heard that it was a bigger than average walleye fishing lake for a long time but the camp wasn't exciting enough to get me to stay there. It was in tough shape back then and I'm hoping they put some money into it or it would not be pretty now. I know your ok with the rough aspect of the camp so it might suit you. Another lake they have with nice camp and bigger fish is Elbow Lake, at the inflow from Muskrat we were into consistent 3-6 lb fish and again that's a few years ago it could have changed by now. Will be interested in hearing how you make out if you get there as I would figure it lightly fished."
