6582414,BrianinVA,2021-07-23 14:51:00,160,"Aren't tests typically ""free"" only if you are symptomatic? Places around where I live require cash payment if you aren't symptomatic. Amazon recently launched a $39.99 PCR test where you overnight the test and get results back within 24 hours of the lab receiving your kit. This might be a cheaper option for some -- the only downside is that it is for 18+ so it won't work for younger travelers."
6582422,Fisherman Ted,2021-07-23 15:01:00,461,"From NOTO FAQs About the Border Q. Do travelers still require a negative COVID-19 test taken 72hr prior to entering Canada? Yes. All travelers must take a PCR (molecular) test with a negative result taken within 72hrs of crossing the border. Q. What are the requirements for children under the age of 12? Unvaccinated children under the age of 12 travelling with fully vaccinated parents must meet all other required criteria to enter Canada, including submitting information electronically through ArriveCAN and all testing requirements (which includes the pre-arrival test). Q. Will non-vaccinated or half-vaccinated Americans be permitted to enter Canada if they are able and willing to quarantine? Entry to Canada will continue to be prohibited for U.S. travelers who are not fully vaccinated and for all other foreign nationals, unless they already meet an exemption set out in the Orders made under the Quarantine Act. Q. Is there a fee attached to the ArriveCAN app? ArriveCAN is a free and secure app. The Government put out a statement warning people of scam apps pretending to be ArriveCAN asking for payment information. Click here for more information on the ArriveCAN app. Q. What constitutes as a proper quarantine plan? The quarantine plan is mandatory for anyone entering Canada, regardless if they are fully vaccinated.  Quarantine locations should be their vacation destination  Guests who are randomly selected for a test and test positive can choose to do their quarantine at their quarantine location here in Canada OR they can leave to go home. We suggest that operators (if possible) have a cabin reserved as a self-isolation location for the guest that tests positive. Q. Are there any testing or quarantine requirements for Americans returning to the USA? As it currently stands, there are no testing or quarantine requirements for Americans returning to the US by land border crossing. There are testing requirements for Americans returning to the US via air. The COVID-19 situation is continuously evolving therefore this may change. We will update the industry if there are any changes. Q. What are all the steps our US guests will need to take prior to entering Canada?  Must have received the full series of a Health Canada approved COVID-19 vaccine or a combination of approved vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca, Johnson & Johnson)  Must have received your last dose at least 14 days prior to the day you enter Canada  Upload information into the ArriveCAN app (this app is free and secure)  All information must be inputted into the ArriveCAN app within 72 hours prior to arrival in Canada.  The app will ask you to input contact information for you and the people you are travelling with, purpose of trip, date of arrival, port of entry, proof of vaccination, and your quarantine plan.  For the quarantine plan, input the location where you will be staying while in Canada (i.e. the lodge).  Must have a negative COVID-19 molecular* test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival (view accepted tests). Antigen tests are not accepted.  Must be asymptomatic upon arrival  Upon arrival, the border officer will ask you for your ArriveCAN receipt, proof of vaccination, negative COVID-19 test results and other typical documentation. Q. What types of COVID-19 pre-arrival tests will be accepted by CBSA? These tests are considered acceptable molecular tests - antigen tests are not accepted*:  PCR - Polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  reverse transcription real time PCR  Quantitative PCR (qPCR)  Nucleic acid test (NAT) or Nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs)  Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)  Isothermal amplification  Droplet digital PCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)  Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)  RNA (Ribonucleic acid)  Ct (cycle threshold)  CRISPR  Sequencing  Next generational sequencing (NGS) or whole genome sequencing (WGS)  Oxford Nanopore sequencing (LamPORE)  Detection of the N gene  Detection of Orf1a/b  Detection of the S gene  Detection of the E gene  Detection of the RdRp gene These tests use methods such as a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, nose swab, or saliva sample. At this time, proof of having a vaccine will not replace a negative test result. Here are links that NOTO members have shared with us that may help your guests find a testing site:  https://www.walgreens.com/findcare/c...vanity_testing  https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing  Please make sure to advise your guests that antigen tests are not accepted. Q. If someone had COVID-19 and have recovered, would that count as proof of immunity/vaccination? No. All individuals must be fully vaccinated and have proof of vaccination in order to enter Canada. Entry to Canada will continue to be prohibited for U.S. travelers who are not fully vaccinated and for all other foreign nationals, unless they already meet an exemption set out in the Orders made under the Quarantine Act."
6582490,Obabikon,2021-07-23 16:47:00,2370,"Most tests are free if symptomatic or not. At least mine was... I told them I needed it for travel purposes, and I had to have the results in 48 hours or less"
6582496,Bstar,2021-07-23 16:57:00,564,I'm guessing that a non-supervised test won't be acceptable.
6582508,Obabikon,2021-07-23 17:38:00,2370,"I should follow this up with... unless you're trying to get fast results. There are clinics that you pay for the test, and have the results quickly."
6582522,Riding high,2021-07-23 18:07:00,69,I had one at our hospital clinic in near by town and it was free. Got results back in less than a hour.
6581874,Slim03,2021-07-22 14:31:00,159,Where at? I have called clinics and hyvee and they have all said 3-5 days yet which obviously will not work.
6581880,fishingfever,2021-07-22 14:45:00,85,"I made my appt. through the Garner Medical Clinic. The test is taken at Britt, IA. Phone # 641-923-2651."
6581894,isumoose,2021-07-22 15:05:00,14,"Walgreens offers free tests. Their ""Rapid Diagnostic Test (ID NOW)"" advertises results in less than 24hrs. This is Abbott's rapid molecular in vitro diagnostic test, so you should be good."
6581896,Bstar,2021-07-22 15:07:00,564,It looks like you can put additional travelers in the ArriveCAN app so you may be able to put the old farts on your phone.
6581916,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-22 16:01:00,90,"Yes this looks like it could be the way to go. Here is from wallgreens website:Rapid Diagnostic Test (ID NOW): The Rapid Point-of-Care (POC) - NAAT (ID NOW) test also detects genetic material (mRNA) of the virus. The test is performed on-site, and results are available within 24 hours. I believe this meets Canadian requirements. I believe it’s free as well!"

6581978,WalleyeTherapy,2021-07-22 17:11:00,49,Thank you for the IDNow recommendation Isumoose. Much appreciated. The travel.gc.ca Canada page definitely lists NAAT tests as acceptable testing
6582002,Obabikon,2021-07-22 17:40:00,2370,"Isolated instances like this should call the border WHERE THEY ARE CROSSING, and make sure they will be allowed if they test positive. Get the officer's name for reference, and give them your name too. I know there are going to be problems with the system. There always are. The good news is... THE BORDER IS OPENING!!!! Wahoo!!!! Be patient with the officers, be respectful, be prepared... remember, none of the people at the border made the rules or were in charge of closing things down. Let's make things as easy as possible for everyone involved!"
6582004,Obabikon,2021-07-22 17:43:00,2370,thank you. Most of us are on the same team... let's go fishing!
6581780,kettyspanky,2021-07-22 11:21:00,271,Just wondering if we do the ArriveCan at home and then get to the border and we can't look it up on my smart phone because there is not any cell service there. Then what?
6581790,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 12:14:00,3685,"I'm not sure,but I think you can print out a receipt after you submit your info,someone else can maybe answer it better for you,I just a flip phone guy"
6581818,lassh,2021-07-22 13:00:00,553,"Jared, do have any knowledge of vaccinated, recovered Covid cases who test positive, long after they are no longer infectious? I think those people if they have a positive test between 6 months and 14 days of crossing, will be allowed in with a positive test."
6581830,eyecatcher1,2021-07-22 13:26:00,323,Can my quarantine plan be to just turn around and go home? I only have a one week trip booked anyway.
6581832,WalleyeTherapy,2021-07-22 13:36:00,49,There are options for rapid result PCR tests available. I'm personally concerned about driving 9 hours and not having test results when I arrive. There is a fairly steep price to pay for PCR tests with results same day or next day I've noticed. $200 is best I've seen in WI so far. If anyone is aware of rapid result PCR testing that is less expensive please share
6581834,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 13:42:00,3685,"Take your test 72 hours before you go you'll have your results before you leave,most results are 24 hours to 48 hours at a clinic."
6581844,fishingfever,2021-07-22 13:57:00,85,We're paying $75 at a clinic for a PCR test with same day results. NC Iowa. What about supposedly having to list a place to quarantine? Is that reallly necessary?
6581848,fishingfever,2021-07-22 14:02:00,85,I haven't seen what you get back from ArriveCan but if it's like a boarding pass for the airlines you may be able to take a screenshot of it so you don't need cell service.
6581864,Obabikon,2021-07-22 14:17:00,2370,"OK guys… We’re thinking way too far into this. Remember they are not opening just for fishing resorts. There are people who plan to come across for several months. So they are making general plans for everyone in order to open the border. Your lodge/cabin is a perfectly acceptable “quarantine plan“ give them the address and you’re done.I am not going to recommend anyone try to cross with a positive test result from their 72 hour precrossing test unless you have long term plans. If that is the case, check with the border.Anyone getting a positive test result from the “random” spot test at the border… Would need to either quarantine or go home. You will be allowed to do either of those… Canada will not keep you hostage. I want to reiterate that this will be an extremely rare event. First off, you would have to have your 72 hour test come back negative, be a random testy, and then have contracted Covid with the vaccine and a negative test within 72 hours… unlikely. You will get your test results, if you are the random person chosen, a day or two into your trip. At that point you can either quarantine at your large or go home."
6581866,Eckohlt,2021-07-22 14:17:00,3685,It's going to be like hitting the lottery trying to get through the gate.
6581714,Obabikon,2021-07-22 08:56:00,2370,"1. On August 9th, US citizens will be allowed to enter Canada. Those citizens will be allowed to return to the US at the end of their trip. RETURNING TO THE US... US Citizens will not be subject to quarantine or require a negative covid test. President Biden's decision to extend the US border closure does NOT affect US Citizens going to Canada. It only affects Canadian citizens coming to the US (which is still bad). Your fishing trip is still on! 2. US citizens over the age of 11 must have proof of vaccination (your card will work) AND a negative MOLECULAR covid test. 11 and under must have a negative molecular covid test. The most common molecular covid test is the PCR test. You can usually get it for free, however, many have a 48 hour wait time. If you are confident, that you're going to come back negative... you CAN provide digital proof. I personally was tested, and then headed north the next day. Since it is a two day drive, I received my results on the road. Showed them the digital proof, and had no problems crossing. 3. ArriveCan should be filled out on your smart phone or computer 72 hours prior to traveling to the border. This is to ensure that your information is uploaded, and it will create a smoother border crossing. If someone has forgotten (or can't figure out the program), you can do this AT the border. Your crossing will go easier, and you won't be holding up traffic, if you take the time to fill out the forms before hand. 4. There will be occasional ""random"" tests. These, from what I understand, will not be rapid tests. So, you will do the test at the border, but will then continue to your destination. From there, IF you test positive, you will be contacted. You then will need to enact your ""quarantine plan"". Resorts are being encouraged to have a place designated, just in case a test comes back positive. From that point... you can either stay in quarantine, or return to the US. Canada will not detain you. 5. There is ZERO non-artificial bait allowed to cross from the US to Canada right now. (frozen, salted, dead, alive, minnows, leeches, worms, shrimp... nothing, zero, zilch) 6. Johnson&Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer are all approved vaccines for crossing into Canada. Astrazeneca is also approved by Canada, but was not approved in the US."
6581722,troutwater,2021-07-22 09:14:00,299,"Fantastic information, thank you. I think I speak for most when I say you've been extremely helpful through all of this!"
6581724,Larry S,2021-07-22 09:16:00,665,Obabikon Are you sure the US will Let Americans traveling by land IN to Canada??
6581726,Obabikon,2021-07-22 09:21:00,2370,Yes. They will not be preventing their own citizens from going into Canada.
6581734,walleyecheek,2021-07-22 09:27:00,2231,"What about ""old farts"" in your group that don't have a smart phone ? Or a home computer ?.........you know the type !"
6581738,Obabikon,2021-07-22 09:32:00,2370,Show up at the borderâ¦ And they will walk you through the process. I don't know if it'll be a paper form or if an officer will come help you through it. I just know that it isn't a reason they will be turned away at the border.
6581750,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-22 10:09:00,90,Question as far as when to take the pre entry pcr test. So if crossing let’s say Friday afternoon my group should get the test Wednesday morning? I assume would get the results Thursday or Friday driving up?
6581756,Windermere,2021-07-22 10:15:00,23,"Just wanted to add some more supportive information to Jared's post. Jared, thanks for all the updates! We called the U.S. Sault border this morning for clarification for our U.S. guests returning back to the U.S. from their fishing trip with us. He was very helpful and said a U.S. resident can always return back to the U.S. (even those traveling between the 9th and the 21st of August). We hope this helps clear up the misunderstanding as we ourselves have customers wanting to cancel because of the misinterpretation. Very frustrating on our part even when we have shared the verified information with them. We hope this information helps those heading north across the Soo border in these coming weeks."
6581760,Larry S,2021-07-22 10:30:00,665,"Obabikon. Thanks a lot for your clarification on the border. I called around and found out.as you said the border Will let Americans driving into Canada come in. As you said you need to be vaccinated and have taken a Covid test (PCR or NAAT) 72 hours prior to entering When you come to border You drive by the American border Patrol and go to the Canadian Officers where you will have to present your Covid Test, Use APP on Phone ArriveCAN or present paper vaccination proof and Covid Testing Proof. Have a plan ready for Quarentine Thanks Again ,My sister and I will be going to Mattice Outfitters in Armstrong for a trip to Ogoki Reservoiy Aug 14 to 21 Larry S"
6581770,Obabikon,2021-07-22 10:38:00,2370,Everyone will have different time frames when their test will be available. From the moment you take the test… You have 72 hours to get across the border. So if your test results take 48 hours… You will only have a 24 hour window to get across. If your test results take three hours… You have a much larger window. I’m just trying to make this as clear as possible. If you were going to cross on Saturday morning…. You could have a test Wednesday afternoon and still be within the 72 hours
