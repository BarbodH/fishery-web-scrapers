For different types of fishing whether jigging for eyes, casting for pike, or trolling. Leaders always, or never, what type of leaders, swivels or no swivels, etc.....would like some input from some of the guys that guide up there as to what their favorites are. Thanks for any info."
6580644,kzoofisher,2021-07-20 03:34:00,5144,"I use the same set ups there as at home. Why bother to change everything for fish that are easier to catch? Canada for me is about casting jig & plastic for walleye: braid, mono leader, swivel in between. Neither the mono or the swivel are necessary they just make changing lures and replacing after bite offs/break offs easier. 8# braid: power pro, suffix, p-line all work. Just about anything else too, probably. Those are what's on my reels right now. 8# mono: maxima ultra green, it's what I have swivels: p-line in 12 or 14. I like the little safety pin type dispenser the come on. Each one lasts a whole season or more and they're tiny. rods: anywhere from 6' 8"" - 7' 4"", bunch of brands, light to medium, fast to very fast reels: bunch of brands again, sizes 1500 - 3000. They're walleye, how well they cast and retrieve is way more important than the drag"
6581372,eyecatcher1,2021-07-21 13:06:00,323,I've never noticed a difference between mono and braid in Canada. The only time that I use a leader is when I'm fishing for pike. Then I use a steel leader.

6581498,adempsey2.0,2021-07-21 16:51:00,611,"Walleye 10lb braid with a 4 to 8lb fluorocarbon leader. I go lower for jigging and higher for cranks/trolling, and sometimes I just use whatever. I will use a 6"" titanium or steel leader if I am getting hammerhandle pike or using blade baits. 4-strand braid for jigging, 4- or 8- stranding for casting. I get too much rod tip wrap with the rounder lines when jigging. Tie directly if no wire leader. Sometimes I will use a swivel though.Pike Spinning set-up 20 lb braid with a 30-65lb titanium leader. Prefer single-strand leaders, but use multi-strand as well for chucking spoons/inline spinners/cranks (1.5oz or less). I will use a solid wire leader (125 to 300lb) for jerkbaits or similar slow weightless presentations (e.g., large 6-8"" grubs). Baitcasting set-up 50 to 65lb braid with 70 to 85lb SS or multi-strand titanium leader. For tossing larger baits and trolling. Also use 150 to 200 lb fluoro or mono leaders when trolling."
6581526,CiscoKid,2021-07-21 17:44:00,28,"I recently switched my setup: Previously: 10#-12# braid to 12# flouro leader to VMC snap (I like to switch baits a lot - it has to be the lure not the fisherman right?) Now: straight 10#- 12# braid to a VMC snap - eliminated the flouro leader. I will use a VMC 12"" multistrand leader from time to time if specifically targeting pike or trolling crankbaits When jigging, I remove the snap and tie directly to the jig. Reson for change is that I do not see any difference in bites with straight braid and it is easier than retying leader material. I should note that I fish in a stained water system, so may explain my personal feeling that flouro leader is not needed."
6581556,Riding high,2021-07-21 18:46:00,69,Seagur Invizx fluorocarbon 8lb and 10lb jigging walleye and pretty much braided line for trolling bottom bouncers or lindy rigs. Braided for musky reels with 120lb fluorocarbon leaders. Used to use braided tied to fluorocarbon for jigging but don't no more. Used to tie jig to braided line but it's a pain when you get snagged. You have to have a stick or something to wrap the line around to pull on it. When you get it un-snagged the jig is junk. Let just put it this way all lines have there ups and downs. Im happy with the way I went this round.
6581558,gordy28,2021-07-21 18:46:00,437,"For walleye I use 15 LB braid with a 10 lb flouro leader - tying leader can be a pain but when snagged much easier to break off flouro than braid For Pike I have a baitcasting set up and I use 50 LB braid with a wire or flouro 10 inch leader I love braid - use it on every set up I own - bass, ultra light, walleye etc - its so sensitive Cheers Andrew"
6581612,sbabaits,2021-07-21 22:26:00,1,I normally fish braid with a flouro leader or braid to a wire leader if fishing for pike.
