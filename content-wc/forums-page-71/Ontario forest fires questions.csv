6581474,1/4 oz Jig,2021-07-21 16:15:00,90,Does a department of the government asses the risk of a fire to damage a town or property when deciding how to fight so many fires? I checked out the Ontario fire website and when clicking on different fires they have designations. I assume listed being observed means theyâ€™re not attempting to put out the fire and letting nature take its course. When it says not under control are they actively fighting that fire? Thanks

If you drive a diesel that uses DEF fluid, you will use considerably more DEF as the diagnostics computer senses the smoke and uses more DEF. Carry an extra jug."
