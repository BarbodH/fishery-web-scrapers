509472,Moose,2000-08-08 13:48:00,248,"Hotels on Monday night should be no problem in Int'l Falls. There will be many ( 5-7) small motels along hwy 53 from edge town to border crossing. The spot you are refering to is International Skillet next to The Fisherman (218, 283-9440) the hotel next to all that is Motel 6. Nice place. After several years of eating cold eggs greasy bacon and long waits my groups have forgone eating at the International Skillet. FYI we stayed at the Vermillion Motel in Cook, Mn. and very mutch enjoyed the place. Nice clean rooms. Fifty dollars for three guys on a Friday night. Nice resturants in town. About an hour south of the border."

Follow it around town to Highway 11. Right at the stop light on 11. Go a couple of blocks and you will see it on your left. For lodging the Holiday Inn is probably the most expensive in town ($75 - $90 per room) but they have a good breakfast. My suggestion, order the vegetarian omlet and have them add ham. Yum Yum Let me know if you want any other local info.Roger"
509474,GregK,2000-08-10 11:35:00,113,My recommendation for breakfast is the Fort Francis hotel.We like the La Place Rendezvous located east on 11 just outside Ft. Francis. Reasonable prices and very nice accomdation.

509475,Karl,2000-08-11 21:29:00,63,"I would also recommend La Place Rendezvous. Been staying there the last three years. It's just as nice, less expensive, and best of all, you're already in Ontario when you wake up - no waiting for the border crossing."
