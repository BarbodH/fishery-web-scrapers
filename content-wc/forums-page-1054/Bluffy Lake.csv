509498,Guest,2000-08-09 21:00:00,0,I am considering fishing this lake next year. It is northeast of Ear Falls. Just wondering if anyone has had experience on this lake and the camp that is there.ThanksJeff

Sounds like a good camp, only reason we didn't go there is you can't take your own boat.We had a really good trip to gullrock at McEwens Northern Shores this year, we're going back next year. One place to stay away from is the next camp south of bluffy lake. I can't rember the name but it's owned by a guy from swisher, iowa.Hope this helps,Fuzzy"
