509456,DanL,2000-08-07 19:48:00,262,Where can I get leeches by the pound when I cross over at International Falls? I will be heading up to Minnitaki Lake up by Sioux Lookout. Is there anywhere on the way up I can get them?
509457,Guest,2000-08-08 10:34:00,0,"Rainy Lake Bait on HWY 11 it's on the left just east of downtown right next to the water. I was up there two weeks ago and they had plenty of leeches, but they were mostly very small. I didn't buy them. TGG"
509459,hoghunter,2000-08-08 17:40:00,159,"If you head west out of town, there is a place called Witherspoon's. It's a bait, tackle, and gas station on the right side of the road, just past McDonald's. It's probably two to four miles past the border checkpoint. Been there a few times, and had decent, but not huge leeches. Good Luck."
509458,Guest,2000-08-10 22:15:00,0,One thing I would like to add is that Rainy Lake Bait is quality bait store. August is getting late in the season for leeches. They see hundreds of customers and I am sure that their supplies get hit hard. We were up at Rainy last weekend. We fished the Canadian side and crawlers did the trick. Long lining nakes hooks with a series or yellow and gold beads. I have also found that from mid-August on I usually have to switch back to minnows to fish the reef and points deep. TGG

It is the end of the leech season and they won't be getting more so if you find some once you get accross the boarded (can't take leeches into Canada) pick them up.

509462,Brad,2000-08-11 21:25:00,95,>> I was just at Eagle Lake for the last two weeks and I found awesome leeches at Nester Falls Bait and Tackle. It is located on the right side of hwy 71 going north as your entering Nester Falls.They sell large leeches by the pound and you can buy jumbos by the dozen. They were the only bait store I found that did not mix their leeches. All the leeches were very nice!!
