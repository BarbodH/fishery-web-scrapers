Wondering how you did, did you try the rock in Whitefish bay? Also where abouts did you get the eyes in Lobstick Bay? Any info would be appriciated!! Yes I am finally going!!"
509414,Bill Coomes,2000-08-07 16:07:00,70,"Hi Dennis,Hope all is well with you.I caught the 25"" at the the east end of Lobstick. There are two humps on the map, one comes up to 8' the other comes up to 10', my GPS co-ordinates are 49N 24' 54"" & 93W 52' 12"".We also did well in Regina @ no too far south from the red buoy as you enter it from Lobstick, GPS 49N 24""27.8"" 94 00' 49.4"". It's a 15 ft hump coming up out of 80 ft of water.We didn't make it into Whitefish, we had my 3 year old in the boat most of the time and my 11 year old niece. Had a good time, would have been better if my niece hadnt been along."

My place in Hayward is great for a family and theres lots to do. It's on Round Lake which is 3000acres and clear! Fishing can be tough but I fish 30-40' deep and do pretty good when the weather is decent. Thank again, will post when I return."
