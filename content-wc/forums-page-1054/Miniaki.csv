We had good luck on #9 perch shad raps(all colors worked but perch seemed best) and green & orange deep thunderstick juniors. Personally I had fantastic results using a couple Cabelas brand cranks my 4 & 6 year old boys picked out for me. (I wouldn't have bought either one, I think I'll let them pick out all my cranks for now on). One of them was like a shallow floating rapala in blue & silver, and it caught the big fish of our trip. (couldn't have been running over 7' deep!)It's not likely you'll hit a dynamite couple nights like last week, but it works to some degree every year we go. Try it, you'll like it.IaCraig"
