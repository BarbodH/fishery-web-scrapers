509439,Guest,2000-08-10 15:14:00,0,"Just saw a good report from James M. dated August 9th, at 2:28 pm. Sounds like the guys are a little concerned about the last couple of years at Tobin not being as good as it was 4 years ago. They are hoping to put an aggressive size limit on the fish for next year to save the big gals.We plan on going there in September and hope to find out more about Tobin between now and then. Please let me know if you hear anything additional that might be helpful.ChuckAKA: Husker Walleye"
