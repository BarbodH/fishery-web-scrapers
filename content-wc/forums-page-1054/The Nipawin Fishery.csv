I drive 6 hours at least 3 or 4 times each fall looking for that fish of a life time. No complaints, i have caught a few really nice fish, the biggest being 12 pounds. The people up there are great, and so is the fishing.But over the last couple of years, i have noticed a decline in the number of big fish. I still catch plenty of little guys, but the big ones are few and far between. I have heard plenty of others who are having the same results.I want to find some way of saving this fishery, before it gets away from us. The regulations next season are going to be that they raise the slot limit by 4 inches, so no walleye between 21 and 32 inches may be kept. It is great that they are trying to help, but i don't think that it's enough.If the fish never get to be that size, who cares if no one can keep them?I want this fishery to be good for years to come. Living in ALBERTA, i have seen fisheries go down the drain. And now finally Alberta fisheries is starting to make some regs. I have seen how in Manitoba, fisheries is not afraid to step in and say this is what the regs are. That is why Pine Falls etc. are still great fisheries. Saskatchewan ios somewhere in the middle. They have been lucky since they are not to willibng to change regs, but there fisheries are still fairly healthy.Well, i have babbled on for a while now, but my question is, what can we do to get tobin back to it's old self? I don't think stocking is the answer, it's not there aren't enough fish, it's that when there are 300 boats on the water, most of them keeping the big fish, there arn't enough big ones to go around.I hope someone has some ideas on this.James M.P.S. What are the regs at Pine Falls?"
