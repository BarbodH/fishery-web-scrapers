509425,Guest,2000-08-07 08:30:00,0,"Just returned from the Sioux Lookout area of Lac Seul with limits of walleye, smallmouth bass, lake trout, and pike. Lakers and bass were taken on Big Vermillion. The fishing was very good. Bass were very easily spooked, but we managed to catch several in the 17""-18"" range with leeches on 1/8 and 1/16 oz. jigs (black) in probably 20' of water. Lakers were naturally deep this time of year. We fished 1 oz. jigs tipped with minnows in probably 120' of water, and drifted over reefs with the fish hitting the bait as it moved up the reef in about 80' of water or so.Walleye on Lac Seul were plentiful with a few 5+ pounders. Fish seemed to be congegating around reefs in big, open water in about 15' to 30'. 3/8 oz. jigs tipped with a minnow did the trick just fine.Fished some for muskie and could raise them but that was all. We ran into one while bass fishing on Big V that must have been 35 lbs. We fished mainly bucktails and got the follows, but couldn't get any strikes.Construction on RT53 and Highway 502 was progressing with very little delay to our trip. I thought the detour route for 53 was well-marked. 502 was almost completely finished, and was very nice to drive on."
509426,Guest,2000-08-07 11:25:00,0,Sounds like a great trip. I appreciate the update on 502. Our group is heading that way last week of the month and we had almost decided to detour to the west. Sounds like we won't have to.
509427,Hawgman,2000-08-07 12:04:00,18,Thanks for the update on road construction. What time of the day did you go through the construction area on 502?
509429,jimbo,2000-08-08 17:33:00,223,where did you stay? I stayed at Deer Path Lodge in early June. ThanksJimbo
509428,Guest,2000-08-09 06:58:00,0,"Coming home, we hit the southern end of 502 early on a Friday morning. There was work ongoing, and we were held up about 10 minutes, but it was nothing significant. We headed up the previous Sunday, so there was nobody out there at that time."
509430,Guest,2000-08-09 07:00:00,0,We stayed at Anderson's Lodge. Its been a family tradition since my grandfather started going up there.
509431,TeeDub,2000-08-12 22:44:00,48,"How'd you enjoy the stay Jimbo? Did Rick and Evelyn treat you good? We didn't make it out there this summer, but will for sure next year."
509432,jimbo,2000-08-13 15:26:00,223,"I can tell you one thing...if they keep running the loge like they did when I was there they will be booked FULL all the time. I am planning to go back next year, They were as nice as owners could be. Really did enjoy the stay. Can you E-Mail me so I can discus fishing with you in that area???"
509433,TeeDub,2000-08-13 22:05:00,48,"Glad you had a good time. It's a nice spot ain't it? Rick's a real story teller, just don't believe any he tells about his old buds! Or if you do... at least have the courtesy to get my side of the story! ;-)"
