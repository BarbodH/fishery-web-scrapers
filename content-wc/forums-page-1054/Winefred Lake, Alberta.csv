Heading up there in less than a month and am interested to hear how the bite is this year - focusing on Walleye but am devoting some time for some *big* 'gators... (any suggestions???)I heard reports of Native netting up there the last couple of years - anyone know if this is true and if it has affected the sport fishery?Thanks!"

It will be tough fishing as most lakes in Alberta are tough to fish in August. They start to pick up in September when the lake ""turns over"". Paul Mathias (the owner) has a web sitewww.winefredlakelodge.com. Give him an e-mail just before you go. He will be gald to give you an update."

We are headed up there the weekend after you, so anything you can help out with ie: presentation, spots on the lake, etc.On a positive note, we have had to contact the lodge on a few occasions for some more info, etc., and have been treated extremeley well - teh owners seem to be very conscientious and I can't wait to go!!!"
