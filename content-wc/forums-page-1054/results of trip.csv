509492,Guest,2000-08-09 06:59:00,0,I just wanted to post our results from our trip to the Gullrock chain last week of July.Fishing was tough was on water from 5:00am to 9:00pm daily with only a small break for lunch. Our two biggest challenges was May Flies and heat. The lack of wind made fishing tough.We did manage to catch some fish everyday. I was working 20-30 ft of water.My plan of attack was to bottom bounce until I found them and than start jigging. We did locate one good honey hole that produced 200 fish in two days of fishing.Here's my question. What do you think of Gullrock?Jeff
