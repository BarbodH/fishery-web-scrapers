509541,Guest,2000-08-15 21:31:00,0,"I was just checking the Alberta Guide to Sportfishing Regulations and came across the following on page 22 ""It is illegal to use scented lures or scented weights where bait bans are in effect"". Does this actually mean (and please note my amazement) that I ***cannot*** use powerbait on a lake with a bait ban in effect?Can anyone verify this? Does Scented lure encompass powerbait? (My suspicion is that is DOES - and I don't feel good about it...)Thanks all...S."
509542,Guest,2000-08-16 06:46:00,0,"Swirlie, you are correct in assuming that Powerbait can NOT be used in Alberta where a bait ban is in effect. I know this really sucks, because there are a few scented baits out there like the Mr. Twister Exude baits that are dynomite on lakers. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.Good fishing,Russ"
509543,JB,2000-08-16 14:55:00,109,"Russ,What style of Exude do you use for lakers? I'm going in late Sept. and fishing lakers for the first time. Thanks."
509544,Guest,2000-08-16 16:25:00,0,"The Exude tubes on a jig head work great. Or you can rig a thing they are using quite a bit now out west is, you take a 2oz snap weight and attach a split ring to one end and attach a treble then slide the weight inside the tube and attach it to your line with a snap. Pound this jig on the bottom a couple of times and then reel it up real fast to the surface. Lakers will chase these things like you would not believe. The colors I like best are white and chartruese. Scented bait and lakers are like kids and candy.Good luck to you,Russ"
509545,JB,2000-08-16 18:30:00,109,"Thanks Russ, I'll give it a try."
509546,Guest,2000-08-17 08:07:00,0,"Thanks Russ...I have one more question after receiving an e-mail regarding this issue - the e-mail stated that *NO* bait was allowed (meaning no soft plastics of any kind - the guy indicated I would have to fish with a bare hook, or cranks, spoons, etc. (which is no problem at this time of year anyway, although jigging with a crank is a little tough... <GRIN>)- in reading the regulations it would appear to me that only scent impregnated soft plastics or artificials were banned. Do you know which it is? Are ALL plastics banned?Sigh.... it was never this tough to fish when I lived in Saskatchewan...."
509547,Guest,2000-08-17 17:13:00,0,"I am pretty sure that the plain rubber twister tails and shad or minnow imitations would be allowed. The National Parks have the stiffest regulations governing the use of bait and plain unscented rubber is allowed. I think if some one is telling you no rubber, they must think rubber is bait. The only fish I have seen hold unscented rubber is a bass. Most will expell a plain rubber tail or whatever just as fast as they sucked it in. If the guy will not let you use rubber then hit them with jigging spoons. Most are stamped steel or brass and there is nothing saying you can't use those products.I do think the way you understand the rules is how I do. No scented baits is just that. Scent Impregnated.Hope you have a great time,Smak a big one,Russ"
509548,Guest,2000-08-27 08:38:00,0,"just finished watching ""sportfishing b.c."" , they mentioned that if there is a bait ban on any body of water or stream in b.c. then any scented artificial bait is also banned on those waters."
509549,Scott,2000-10-04 10:41:00,385,"In Maryland, the term 'bait' officially refers to organic stuff, live or dead (worms, crickets, minnows, etc), while 'lures' officially refers to artificial stuff, plastics, crankbaits, spinners etc. BUT, adding a scent to a 'lure' changes into the 'bait' category. It sounds like the bait-ban in Alberta is the same."
