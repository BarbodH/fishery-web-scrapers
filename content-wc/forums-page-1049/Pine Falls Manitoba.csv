509898,Guest,2000-10-04 08:47:00,0,"Reading the Resource Officer reply...that means if someone catches a >28"" fish in one derby....for the tourney the next weekend he/she is not allowed to weigh a fish over 28""?What if one purchases another fishing licence which would then not be signed...is this legal?"
509900,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-04 08:57:00,3871,"OK, SO if that is true you can weigh in only one 10 or better for the tournament. And also if you have a prior 10 lb. fish weighed in MB this season, your out of the 10 lb. club for this or any other event this season, right?If the fish is released at weigh in does that still count against your license?If that's the case they should do the tournament like Cats on the Red did with there cat releases. No creeling, 8 weigh boats were in the area and when flagged they weighed the fish on the spot! No big cats went into the live well ever! You kept the fish in a large net boat side tell weighed then released it immediately after your weight check and then given a weight receipt. The weigh in boats radioed in the weights to the board and the angler was responsible to check his slips prior to final weigh in of the day. Very fair and fish friendly system I thought!All release, all live fish, low impact, no lasting restriction on your license for the year, and perfectly legal!My thoughts anyway?BE............><,,>"
509896,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-04 09:03:00,3871,"What are you trying to do Chad? Get the CO's to fallow me around so they leave you alone, -AHE-?Yah-AH, on to you there AHE!!:)BE.............><,,>"
509901,Chad,2000-10-04 10:51:00,3523,"Thats assuming you recorded your first 28+ on your lic. Sounds like a mess. Why would you fish a Pine Falls Tourney if you had to toss back anything over 28"". There is too good of a chance you are going to get those two 28"".At least you could take a polaroid but those dont weigh as much."
509902,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-04 11:17:00,3871,"The one fish over deal is fine but the sign your license away thing is a mess, why such a (FUBAR)?If a mandatory live well check before and after is done on all tournaments the ""potential problem"" would not exist. That would seem much more efficient in the end?Polaroid's as proof of piggy's would be too hard to document on tournaments, hard enough to convince friends let alone competitors! Unless a special piggy trough weigh board was developed to calculate girth & length accurately, and take a picture? Imagine all the SNAFU'S there too? On the water trophy tournaments need weigh boats on the spot, fish mortality is far less, especially in 55 or less water! You would think the CO's would jump at a chance to document size's and growth rates of walleye at such a peak time? Good data!BE"
509899,manitobawalleye,2000-10-04 18:58:00,885,gerwhat are u talking about the tourney the next weekenddid i miss something?
509887,Guest,2000-10-01 08:35:00,0,"Just a short note, the Walleyes are biting good on the river at Pine Falls. any of you reading this from south of the border, please note a few things to make your stay more enjoyable; Barbless hooks are the law not the exception!! This last weekend I was doing a compliance check and found that there are a few anglers who just are not reading their regulation booklet they get with their licences. The fine for this is $52, so please ensure you read your regs, as there is lots of stuff in them that you need to know. Good fishing and good luck"
509888,Chad,2000-10-02 07:25:00,3523,"Dont forget only one over 22"" per person and one over 28"" per year. You must imediatly mark you lic once you put the 28"" in the box. I actually like using the barless hooks since it is really easy to release the fish and no hooks caught in the net.We had good lick this weekend. Friday the wind was blowing into the river and fishing was good. 2 over 10, 6 from 6-8, and numerous in the 20"" range. Sat was just beautiful. Wind blowing out and not as many bites. 3 went 8. Sunday we got 4 in the 8-9 range. the 8lbers are around 26"". We caught all our fish trollin #9's in the bay near the Devils Island(I think that is the name). It is almost under water this year. Also got some trolling the point with the big ornage marker."

509890,Guest,2000-10-02 11:38:00,0,"What are the ""rules"" when it comes to tournaments hosted at Pine Falls....what if someone catches a 28 incher and weighs it in...is the angler required to sign his licence and therefore can not weight another 10lber in?"
509891,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-02 12:47:00,3871,"There is NO CREELING to upgrade your wt., you can not keep to over lenglth fish in the boat at the same time."
509892,Guest,2000-10-02 13:18:00,0,"From what I have been told each angler is only allowed to weigh 1 fish each over 28 "". All Manitoba angling rules and regulations apply. Fish will be measured by the tournament officials."
509893,Chad,2000-10-02 15:19:00,3523,"I am not sure what the rules are but the CO's are usually at the weigh in taking care of the fish. I believe that they transport them over to Lac de Bonnet on the other side of the dam.Being that this is a catch and release the may not require you to record a 28""+ on your lic. If this is so, I believe that you could catch 2 28"" (per team) weigh them in and go get 2 more. As if anyone other the BE could be so lucky! LOLAll I can say is dont mess with the CO's in Canada, Eh. I also heard they were going to impose a dress code for the Americans and the Canadians. Canadians in their Red/Orange or Yellow Life Suits and the Americans are to wear Camo. LOL...."
509894,Guest,2000-10-03 09:10:00,0,"No transportation of fish to the upper dam will take place this year, only 2 fish over 28 will be allowed per team."
509895,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-03 15:17:00,3871,"That would be 1 per angler, per day of the tournament, is that right? SO? How do you transport the second fish if you have marked your license the first day? Won't you be in violation then?Correct me if I am wrong.I don't mind, it happens all the time!:)BE.................><,,>"

Possession means in the livewell or other means of transport to the weigh in. Tournament licences specify that ""all Manitoba Fishery Regulations apply"""
