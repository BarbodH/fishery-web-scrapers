509749,Guest,2000-09-12 19:22:00,0,"Returned 10/9 from Lac Suel / Ear Falls area.Lake is about 4' above normal levels. Water temp 60-64 degrees. Fish were caught in 12-20' with the bigger fish in 18-20' area. Caught all fish on spinner rig/minnows. Islands east of Cox's Island, third island in steamboat and Mckenzie Bay reefs produced the best quanity and quality. Weather was warmer than normal.

Lots of 16-17 inchers. biggest walleye was a 28 incher. Also fished the big sand banks in McKenzie Bay. Wind blown points,Reefs, and Islands in 17-20ft. were working best. Good Luck Bill"
509751,zcamp,2000-09-14 19:07:00,26,Thanks guys. Leaving tomorrow. Haven't slept in 2 days...
509752,zcamp,2000-09-27 09:42:00,26,"Thanks for the info. Stayed at Lac Seul's Evergreen Lodge out of Ear Falls. The weather was fun as fall decided to show up in one swoop. Wind, rain and snow. Only made things more interesting. Caught many 'eyes over the 21"" slot. Don't worry Gary, we put them back. The pike were pretty hot too. I think we retied more because of that than due to snags.Fish were from 5-18', with a focus around 12' most of the time. Pretty much ran jigs with red/black combo's hot one day, pink the next and fireballs in clown and parrot smokin' em the rest. Light conditions due to weather seemed to be the key to color.Find a main lake point, reef or narrows area and fish it relative to the wind, etc. Thanks to Gary and Pat for taking good care of us."
509753,Guest,2000-10-03 06:27:00,0,"Thanks for the good word weather has remained the same since you left. The lake turned over about the 25-26th and fishing brcame work for a few days. I was guiding a group from Iowa and we got some nice size fish but not lots. Pete and I took them hunting- got 9 grouse in about 2 hours, but it would have been slim pickings without the dog to point them in the tight cover. Looking forward to next year with you guys; hope to see you at a show. G&P"
