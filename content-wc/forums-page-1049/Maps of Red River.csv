509924,Guest,2000-10-03 17:00:00,0,Is there any maps of the Red River out to the mouth of the lake. I'm heading up on the 8th and staying tell the 13th. Would like to have an idea of what I'm looking at when I get up there
509925,Guest,2000-10-03 21:12:00,0,Natural Resources of Manitoba sells topographical and water charts(depths etc). You can get a complete set from their office on Century Street. About $20 I think. I'll gather more info if you need it.
