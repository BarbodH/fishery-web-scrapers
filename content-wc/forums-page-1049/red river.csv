509795,manitobawalleye,2000-09-19 19:43:00,885,the duck site i have looked at only covers tracking on the south end of lake manitoba..... as far as i know they are not tracking any lake winnipeg walleyes... if you know something different let me know as i would be interested....
509796,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-20 10:54:00,3871,"Yep it is, but the feeling is this is a good comparison to the MB, there are study's on the MB going on, not sure if avalable yet?"
509797,manitobawalleye,2000-09-22 18:53:00,885,backwater eddythe people i talked to that fished pinefalls last weekend all said the fish kept were empty.... the three we got weds. evening at selkirk were also empty.... a couple of the guys figured the smelt were a couple of years away from making an impact...have never found the ducks study on lake winnipeg....the red tomorrow.......
509798,Guest,2000-09-25 19:19:00,0,"Here's the Red River drawdown schedule I just received from the provincial government.Drawdown of the Red River will commence on Oct.16,2000. It will be donegradually over a period of 4 weeks, so during the first week there willstill be quite a big drop across the structure at St. Andews Dam inLockport. Good luck with the fishing.Alf Warkentin204-945-6698"
509799,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-27 06:52:00,3871,"They have shut down the flow on the headwaters of the Red as of yesterday so the Red is VERY LOW in the Wahpeton to Fargo region! Very dangerous to boating! River run is 6"" and falling yet!If they open the gate's up at the other end as planned there will be nothing but a puddle of mud were the Red used to be!I hope they get there poop in a group on the water regulation of the Red! If the Corp keeps the gates closed on this end from the Otter Tail and we see no rain soon this will be a bad deal for the walleye this winter on the Red!Someone best get the dam ##### straight before this is a tragedy!Backwater Eddy! :("
509785,Guest,2000-09-14 12:43:00,0,planning a trip to the red cant deside wether to go at the last week of sept. or the middle of oct. are the walleyes up the river yet by selkirk is the middle of oct to late? thanks for any info.
509786,manitobawalleye,2000-09-14 19:38:00,885,"walleyes are starting in the river... last week in sept better.... after thanksgiving oct. 7,8, they will start drawing down the red for winter, the water turns to chocolate milk... if you come in oct... go to pinefalls.... it can be bitterly cold but the fishing incredible"
509787,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-15 07:57:00,3871,"Word from a informed source up North is it could be a bit earlier this year. First week in Oct. may be hot, may be earlier then that? There are some good forums who keep close tabs on the Red, check Red River Forum on fishingminnesota.com and Fishingbuddy.com along with walleyecentral.com of course. River water levels are a key factor to when they run big, check out this site to keep up on levels in the upper Red. #####://www.gov.mb.ca/natres/watres/sheets.html#####://nd.water.usgs.gov/public/index/resources.htmlHope this is a help.Backwater Eddy........><,,>"
509788,Guest,2000-09-15 12:04:00,0,Fished Pine Falls wed there was a big chop but the fishing at the mouth was absolutaly unreal...... The bite is on right now.... Biggest was 30 1/2 inches and fat like a pig. Jigged with a white jig and a chunky rainbow. Released the fish for another angler. Keep one for the wall another day.
509789,manitobawalleye,2000-09-17 07:59:00,885,"was up at pinefalls yesterday.... fishing at the mouth was excellent until the wind came up and blew us into the river...clown shad raps.. pink glow rattle jigs...salted minnows... 1 fish after another for first 1.5 hours and about 10 boats..largest our boat 28""... largest seen 32"".....smaller fish in the river... lots of white bass still in the river..... water is still high and lots of current...using up to 1/2oz jigs..... also seems like a decent number of 18'-22' fish"
509790,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-18 06:15:00,3871,"*manitobawalleye* -Is the pressure on, or is there few rigs out?Was there any sign there were eating smelt?Interested in the prey preferances now that the smelt has become a factor. And if they are boy watch the piggy's get fat now!ThanksBackwater Eddy.........><,,>"
509791,chrism,2000-09-18 06:27:00,429,"EddyI was up there on sunday and with little wind I counter 26 boats out on the rivermouth - not too crowded, however everyone seemed to be focused on the same two spots. I too was trolling cranks, and did use an imitation rainbow smelt , which did land a few fish - but so did every other crank we put down.I too second Manitoba Walleyes view that they are still out in the lake and that current is rippin'.I did try a jigs with large (5"") live minnows (not rainbows), but had no takers. They did gobble up the smaller minnows. All in all, over 7hrs we caught 23 walleye, largest @ 28.75"" and most between 19-23"".But most of all, was it ever nice out there with warm weather and no wind!!!!!!"
509792,chrism,2000-09-18 07:16:00,429,"SteveI get the impression that the bite is early this year, so I would suggest the earlier the better. On a regular year, mid-oct is around the end of the Red river bite and also I think the authorities open the locks sometime around the 15th."
509793,manitobawalleye,2000-09-18 20:00:00,885,backwater eddyi would say there was about 25 saturday as well..... parking lot about 1/3 full.....of the eaters we kept all stomachs were empty so no sign of smelti will ask around about the smelt....going on the red after work weds... also all day this saturday......the 30th back to pinefalls... big jig in the river also did not see any big grouping of baitfish on the electronics....
509794,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-18 20:51:00,3871,"Thanks for th e info MB!Have you been checking on the walleye tracking survey on the DU site lately? I have not but will tonight see if they are moveing in on there?BE...........><,,>"
