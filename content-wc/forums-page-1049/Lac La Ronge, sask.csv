509843,chadk66,2000-09-21 17:27:00,1650,thats great to hear. My dad grew up fishing that lake a lot in the late 50's and early 60's. They quit going there because the fish got so small. Nice to hear they have been allowed to grow up.chad

Stay next door to B and L Cabins at Long's 4 Seasons Resort accomadations great gtere as well. I suggest you use a guide as this lake is huge. We have gone out several times with the lodge owners son Doug, he has been great. We used spinners and bouncer rigs or Mepps spinners and have always caught lots of walleyes from 2 -6pounds. The owners say the best time is Long weekend in may until the end of July with the biggest walleyes caught in May. Bring along some heavy tackle as well as the lake trout fishing is good as well. We have caught them up to 18 pounds with lots of 8-10 pounders, bring some big spoons."
509846,Guest,2000-09-28 08:53:00,0,"i have been to Lac La Ronge several times and have always stayed at Longs 4 seasons resort I think it is right next door to B and L Cabins. We always get a guide as this lake is huge, we have always got the owners son Doug to take us out. We usually troll with Mepps spinners or bouncer and spinner rigs. Lots of 50 plus fish days with the majority 2 to 6 pounds although there are bigger ones. Don't forget some heavy gear as well as the lake trout fishing is great as well. we have caught them up to 18 punds but again they do catch them much larger. Maybe we will see you there next June."

I sugest you get a guide as this lake is huge, we have hiredd the owners son Doug several times and it has been great. We catch most of the walleyes on Mepps spinners or bottom bouncers and spinner rigs. Most of the fish are 2 to 6 pounds but they get larger. Don't forget to bring some heavier gear as the lake trout fishing is good as well. We have caught them up to 18 pounds"
