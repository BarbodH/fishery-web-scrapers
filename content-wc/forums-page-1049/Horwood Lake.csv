509632,Guest,2000-08-23 15:25:00,0,"Going to Horwood Lake next week. If anyone has been there lately, could you provide a report for walleyes/pike? Thanks, Steph."
509633,Steve,2000-08-28 10:06:00,259,"Just got back yesterday!!!!! Had a great time, as always, stayed at horwood lake lodge, Barry and Cindy Edwards.....caught 242 fish, 202 were walleyes, biggest was 8 lb (biggest for me ever) action was on worms mostly (big eye was on jig and worm) big suckers worked well for pike and nicer walleys too. trolling was working too, but I cant stand to do much of that when there is so much structure to fish!!!!I found them mostly in 26 or so feet of water, near drop-offs,on points, and on humps (just about where there ""supposed to be""!)For me, anchoring and working an area is my best way to catch fish. Also if its windy head for the ""Islands"" and fish on any side that has 20 or more feet of water,seems like the baitfish detour around the island and the eyes wait for them there. another also is the ""sunset bite"" which is my absolute favorite, I know a hump close to the lodge where you anchor about 6 pm or so and the fish move up to feed from then till sunset...it does'nt get any better than that!! Are you staying at that lodge? If so I could tell you more places,but I think I'm ramling on here....still fired up I guess! Too much Tim Hortons coffee!!!!! Good luck and tell Canada I miss it already!!"
509634,Guest,2000-08-28 15:12:00,0,"thanks for the information. I was getting worried since no one responded to my request. This will be the second time for me this year to horwood. I stayed at barry and cindy's in june. caught lots of fish but hated the drive to the lodge, especially since i have an 18 foot lund. took almost two hours. so this time i am going to the outpost to stay. the only bad thing there is that there is more boat traffic. we jigged it in june, glad to know that things have not changed. i was prepared for a whole lot of crank baiting/trolling this trip. what colors worked for you? how was the weather? thanks again for responding, steph."
509635,Guest,2000-08-28 21:47:00,0,"Does Michelle and Richard LeBlonde still own the outpost way up the river By the ""Gold Mine""? Went up there in 1988 and 1992. Fishing was great with Hot-n Tots with yellow with black herringbone being a KILLER."
509636,Steve,2000-08-29 00:32:00,259,"Steph, for me the hot colors were chartruse, orange and hot pink.....weather was HOT but it was worth the instant tan I got....water was still pretty high and the famous logs were everywhere (even saw Barry hit one!) I'm not too familiar with the outpost so I cant help you out there....but I did love my trips up there in the end of sept and october...it was gorgeous and the fishing was great too....oh yeah the herringbone patern hot-n-tots is still producing and also if you wanna do some slow trolling spinner harness' in orange and pink were real good also--just got too many perch that way......good luck....and let me know if you see the mountain lion we saw last year!!!!!!!!"
509637,Guest,2000-08-29 05:41:00,0,"Thanks again for the tips, I will keep my eyes posted for the mountain lion. I hope I see him. I will give you an update when I return. steph."
509638,Guest,2000-08-29 05:43:00,0,"If your talking about ""horwood outpost"" I believe that is now under new ownership. if there is another outpost closer to the falls, it may be the one you are referring to. I have only been to horwood once, this saturday will be my second time. i can further into it if you want me to. steph."
509639,Guest,2000-08-29 21:17:00,0,"Nope, your right it was called the Horwood Outpost. As far as I know the Horwood Outpost is the last resort before you get to the ""Falls"". It is roughly 1/2 mile down from the ""Gold Mine"". If you would, ask the owners what happened to Richard and Michelle the previous owners of the Horwood Outpost. Richard was the caretaker of the ""Dam"" that created Horwood Lake during the winter, while living close to ""Big Bear Camp"" during the winter."
509640,Guest,2000-09-19 09:10:00,0,"Sorry for not responding promptly to your inquiry about the Horwood Outpost. Turns out that Richard & Michelle divorced. Michelle remarried an American from Columbus, Ohio. I met them but forgot her husband's name. Nice people though. I dont know what happened to Richard. Sounded like the divorce was ugly. a new ""richard"" owns the outpost and is very hospitable. we had an awesome time there. in fact, we booked for june. he has a fish fry every wed. for his guests, he provides all the food, with the understanding that you contribute the fish. cant say enough good things about the place. any questions, feel free to email me. steph"
