509706,Beeg,2000-09-05 13:47:00,9,Has anyone ever fished the drive to lakes north of Pickle Lake? What about Fly-in lakes north of Pickle Lake?
509707,Guest,2000-09-05 17:51:00,0,"For driving in - the locals as well as the folks I met from MI and MN really seem impressed with Lk St Joseph.The air service there is exceptional and they are very flexible on weights, depending on group size - North Star Air.We have used Cat River Outfitters to go to camps on Morris Lk and Kinloch (pipestone prov park). We had a great time at each - fish usually 100 per boat/day.We have to drive so far that we are looking for monsters. We havn't found the right place yet but there are plenty of 10 lb pike and 2-4 lb walleyes at these places. We have had some difficulty putting the 20 pounders in the boat and have never seen a walleye over 4 lbs.Most of the camps (there are lots of them)I have looked at are new or newer and are the only camp on a big piece of water.good luck,Lobo"

509709,Beeg,2000-09-06 04:22:00,9,Mawley and Horseshoe Lakes. A guy that I talked to in a store a couple of years ago told me about these lakes and I never persued info on them until now. I go on one fly-in a year and want a second trip that would be cheaper. I have a 14ft boat and a canoe.
509710,Eyesore,2000-09-06 17:33:00,455,"Beeg, I havent fished either of these lakes, but I've heard of them. Horseshoe has a nice camp ground though, as Ive driven into it. All I can say is the water levels very and there are MEGA rocks in the river that takes you to the lake. Ive seen the exposed ones!"
