We will be doing some Lake trout fishing for the first time and would appreciate any tips for lure types and also cleaning or filleting."

509859,River_eye,2000-09-22 14:12:00,1486,"That's a coincidence. I know the owners/operators, Craig and Hugh Carlson, actually, I'm better friends with their daughters. My family used to stay with Craig whenever we visited Red Lake. Actually, they are the only lodge owners in Red Lake that I know personally. Can't tell you much about the lake though, I've only been to one of their outposts, and their main lodge. I'd need to send an e-mail or two to get any info. If you want any specific info, feel free to e-mail me.River eye"
509860,Guest,2000-09-25 07:24:00,0,"Actually we have been to outposts owned by Hugh And Craig two other times including the lake we are going to but never this late. I'm more concerned with where they might be this late. And we have never fished for lakers so I'd like to know a little about them.Thanks,Gary"
