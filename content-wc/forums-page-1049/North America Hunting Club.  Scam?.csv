For $24 a month, I get a monthly hunting magazine, plus they'll send me hunting/camping products to use and then I must send in a review on that product. Apparently I get to keep the product. It sounds a little too good to be true. Anybody else get this in the mail or heard of this club?River eye"
509808,Pops,2000-09-16 00:10:00,61,"River eye,These folks are associated with North American Fishing club of which I am a Life member. Yes, they do send out stuff for you to try and you do get to keep it.I do not know much about NAHC but the mag for NAFC is good and has alot of tips for all types of fishing.Keep your rod bent!!Pops"
509809,River_eye,2000-09-16 01:09:00,1486,"I guess I wish I got sent that one instead, I'd probably consider that, as I don't hunt, but they seem to think that I do.River eye"
509810,Pops,2000-09-16 04:24:00,61,If you like I can send you the URL for the NAFC web site and you can join from there.E-mail me and I will send you the URL.Keep your rod bent!!Pops
509811,MR.Pike,2000-09-16 13:26:00,329,"Not a scam but,,, the chances of you being sent these ""cool new hunting supplies"" to review are pretty slim at best. Also I think he dues are 24 bucks a YEAR, not month. They do have a good magazine like their fishing counterparts( NAFC).Good fishing,<;{{{{{<<( Mr.Pike"
509812,River_eye,2000-09-16 19:38:00,1486,"oops, yeah, $24 a year, that was a typoRiver eye"
509813,IaCraig,2000-10-01 21:17:00,434,"I have been a member of North American Hunting Club for 5 - 10 years. I like their magazines, plus they do send quite a few drawings for free guns etc.. But I a yet to be sent anything to test or trial. I think you have to know someone to get on the testers list, or at least be a lifetime member for $???.00. Take a kid fishing.....IaCraig"
509814,Dmacattak,2000-10-02 18:01:00,14,"Craig is right in order to recieve the ""more"" expensive items you need to be a life member. as a regular member you can get drawn for lures and things like that, but as for top shelf items ya get what ya pay for. lol"
