That'll screw things up for two weeks until water settles.Was out out on the 28th Sept, a Thurs. geez a lot of boats out there for a weekday. Launched at Selkirk. Hate to see the pre-dawn line-up. Slow during the day, but it seemed to pick up after 6:30 pm. Got 3 wally's, nothing to brag about, a 18 inch cat, and 2 stripe bass. Jigged and pickeral rigged. All wally's on a jig and minnow.Weather is going to be cool, so bring the long underwear and a big thermos!"
509840,Guest,2000-10-03 22:52:00,0,Word is that they are nailin' them at Pine Falls. In the river and on Traverse Bay.Lawrence
509841,Guest,2000-10-04 15:50:00,0,Note there are two walleye tournaments coming up on consecutive weekends at Pine Falls.The Voyageaurs on Oct 7/8 and the Walleye Championship on Oct 14/15.
509829,Kurt,2000-09-20 20:44:00,47,Hey guys- heading up there on the 11th of Oct. -any news? Been there the last two years and did well. Are we catching them jigging or trolling? Hope we are not too late this year. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
509830,Guest,2000-09-22 12:02:00,0,Just got off the phone with the guide out of Cat's on the red. They are catching alot of fish in the 4 to 5 lb. range. An occasional fish in the 10 lb range. The locks were closed on Monday and he suspects the next 2 weeks will be outstanding.
509831,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-25 06:56:00,3871,What's the word on this past weekend?Thank's!ED
509832,chrism,2000-09-25 08:54:00,429,"BEI fished the Red for about 6 hours Sat, it was quite slow. Seems like it was just one of those days when it was hard to make them bite. We landed one 24"" eye and more saugers that I care to talk about. I did see a lot of big fish on the sonar in the walleye areas, but very few bites. Chit chat around the launch was the same with the odd exception. Fair amt of 2-5 lb eyes, didn't hear of any ""piggy's"" on Sat!However, believe it or not, I caught a master angler Cat trolling a shad rap! Go figure.My fishing partner was at pine falls sunday and once again, it was excellent fishing. Thier biggest was 26"" caught in the bay. Unfortunately the wind chased them into the river for the afternoon.Fishing pressure is on the rise..."

509834,manitobawalleye,2000-09-27 16:43:00,885,"chrism......i was on the red also saturday and it was slow for me also...they were catching a few jigging by doc reeds....but get this.....i also caught a 34"" cat on a orange/chart. luhr-jensen powerdive crank..... on the big flat opposite doc reeds towards the powerlines....... it was fun and the friends 2 kids had never seen a fish so big so they had a blast........should have had along the cat gear and taken them to the locks... oh well.."
509835,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-02 06:22:00,3871,"What was the weekend like guy's?Good, bad, Great? I have heard good things the past week, is it steady or spoty?BE............><,,>"
509836,chrism,2000-10-02 09:07:00,429,"BESee Chads post - I agree. He didn't mention the amount of boats - most I've ever seen there - but still lots of fish and you could find your own spot. Also, they seem to be moving into the river now, but traverse bay still rules.Red on sunday was spotty - lots of small walleye/sauger but some big ones were being caught. Again, I was seeing lots of big fish on sonar in the walleye zone(s), who knows what they were...I like to think they are the big mamma's!"
509837,Backwater Eddy,2000-10-02 10:33:00,3871,"Cool, thanks!"
509838,manitobawalleye,2000-10-02 19:07:00,885,"i heard the river was bad on sunday, oct 1, but was thinking of going tues.evening if the sun comes out....chris is right traverse bay is till hot,hot,hot,,,going back on the 14th"
