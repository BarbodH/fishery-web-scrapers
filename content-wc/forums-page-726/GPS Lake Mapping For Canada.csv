553098,Guest,2005-11-16 16:04:00,0,"Thanks for the great feedback guys! This will help us deliver a product thats best suited to your needs in the years to come. NWO-Great points, there is no doubt that you know what you are discussing and the technology involved. I understand ""spot-on-the-spot"". Thats our livelihood. Not every map is created equal, and some are far better than others. NONE should be relied on as a sole source of navigation data. There is a disclaimer on every map we sell. Not because its not the best map, but because there are too many variables in the technology and use thereof. NO MAP (paper/electronic/otherwise) SHOULD BE SUBSTITUTED FOR GOOD SEAMANSHIP, COMMON SENSE, and a SECONDARY NAVIGATION SOURCE!!!! We are just cutting our teeth in Canada with help from our partners. It should be a great product and will only get better. We are really looking forward to building out the coverage and quality of our Canadian lake coverage. NWO, as an aside, Your equipment standards and suggestions are very adequate for smaller scope projects, but the actual equipment used on our vessels is a lot more complex, and substantially more costly! You also don't mention the expertise needed for operation of the vessel and the electronics! We take our commitment to being the world leader in inland lake mapping very seriously...our equipment and expertise reflects that! Thanks again for the feedback! More details to follow.

552985,Guest,2005-11-08 05:45:00,0,"Navionics Hot Maps, northern section has detailed Lake of Woods map. After a brief look at it last June on a partners Lowrance 332C it seemed to match closely the Canadian Hydrographic Map for the Sabaskong, Miles Bay areas. He had the Gold Series. I've been told that the Hot Maps elite series had more detail, but have not seen the elite LOW map.

552975,Guest,2005-11-07 14:21:00,0,"I was just going to make a post about this when I saw your post. I have a globalmap 100 that shows about 2/3 of the surface on Lac Seul, it would be great if there was even a full surface map of Lac Seul. I called Lowrance about a week ago and they have nothing with full mapping of that lake. I was told that the gps would still track past the end of the map and you could put a waypoint in at your destination for a route to save, that would only leave a trail with no detail. Does anybody know if there is a full surface map of Lac Seul for a gps unit? Ron"

552978,Jimmy Jig,2005-11-07 19:05:00,1905,"Reed's told me last week that you would have LacSeul in a month, for $149."
552979,Guest,2005-11-07 19:24:00,0,"I can shed lots of light on this topic! Jeff, Fred means Lake St. Joe in northwestern Ontario (the big lake northeast of Lac Seul maybe 100km or so). Rmack, if I had $10 for everytime a guest showed me how the map on their unit stopped in the middle of Lac Seul, I wouldn't be working in the winter! But, what you are discussing is common data these days. What Jeff is proposing, is far beyond what you have now. Jeff, I am a spatial technologist (GPS, GIS, remote sensing, etc.) at Lakehead University (in Thunder Bay)in the winter and a Lac Seul (and sometimes other water) fishing bum in the summer, and have been discussing what you are proposing with a variety of private and public people. There are others which have been doing this for maybe five years or so in Northern Ontario. The quality of these products have varied, but in my opinion are 'OK at best', and from a fishing perspective may give you a starting point, but that's about it. If you are fishing walleye on Lac Seul for example, particularly in the summer (so after post-spawn and transition), you are often working large sand breaks or sometimes rock/reef edges, and being off the ""spot-on-spot"" by a boatlength will often make a huge difference in fish production. To that extent, for the product to be considered great for fishing, you need a very detailed sampling grid. Not a 200 meter grid, or a 100m grid, but at least less than 10m, and ideally less than 5m. The field collection for Lac Seul alone, with multiple crews working, I would estimate would take multiple summers. Anything with less precision and I know (and you know) you would find yourself overselling the product (in terms of accuracy). I have spoken with people at Lowrance. In terms of point collection . . . we are running 12 boats/day, everyday, all summer, all with top-end Lowrance units equipped with GPS. Here is how you could slowly develop a great product . . . -each unit has a portable mass memory storage device (which of course are very common these days) -while on the water, the GPS point and associated depth from the sonar are recorded and stored in a file, on a 1- or 2-second collection interval -at the end of the day, the portable storage device can be removed and put in a PC -you would then need software which could accept such data, interpolate it, and create a coverage -with each passing day, more and more data is being collected (i.e., more data from each boat, for every second of everyday, can be added to the growing dataset, with a new interpolation completed on the fly at the end of each day) -as time goes on, and more and more data is collected, you could produce a very good product -over rarely- or never-fished water, the product would of course be less accurate, but in the frequent fishing locations, it would be extremely accurate, because of the incredibly high number of points Here is what you would need . . . -proper method of data storage (which is portable) within the Lowrance units -software which can accept such data, quickly merge it with an associated database, and perform a proper interpolation (this should be easy! If you had the data in a simple text file, X,Y, and Z, you could do this in ArcView in a matter of minutes; and an ArcView extension could be easily created to complete this step) -you would need a method to differentially correct the GPS data, either post-processed, or in real-time (which would require Lowrance to build in the possibility to connect to WAAS or some appropriate real-time system) So Jeff, I'm not sure just what exactly you had in mind. You stated ""We have some good stuff in house"". I'm curious as to what this means, what is good stuff?? In Lac Seul, Lake St. Joseph, etc. it is common to go from 80' to 1' of water in 10-20 meters of horizontal distance, and then back down to 40 or 60 or 80 again just as quickly. I hope you have the disclaimer ready for your product, because if some guy is going 40 mph across 80' of water and they lose their lower unit, they will be contacting you!! That said, no matter how good the product is, you still need to know fishing and have experience to optimize your fish production. No map will ever help you more than a good, local guide could. I would love to talk more Jeff. Do you have an email or number . . . and we could share thoughts. NWO Fishing Bum"
