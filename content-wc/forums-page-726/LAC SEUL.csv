553047,Guest,2005-11-11 09:55:00,0,Are there any smallmouth in the lake??
553049,Guest,2005-11-11 13:15:00,0,"Yes, absolutely there is smallmouth, and they are ""football"" smallmouth, meaning they have far greater than average height from belly to dorsal fin than do similar length smallmouth from other waters. For the most part, LS smallmouth seem to follow well-documented theoretical behaviour for smallmouth throughout the year. A few weeks after ice-out you can find them on rocky drop-offs from 7-15', and as they progress into pre-spawn and spawning patterns they move shallower up onto spawning locations, with some sand and nearby cobble. You can get them around such locations until shortly after the spawn (somewhere in the first couple weeks of July, depending on the season), and then they go deep. At this point they are difficult to target and few people I know bother trying, when the walleye fishing is so much more productive. We do have some experience to show they do have their feeding frenzy in the fall, but very few people are still around on the lake at that point. NWO Fishing Bum"
553050,Guest,2005-11-11 13:27:00,0,"Our Smallmouth catch has doubled every year for the last 5 years on Lac Seul. We only fish for Walleye but still catch lots of nice SM while jigging. Last year 8 of us caught over 150 SM in one week with average size being 16 to 18"". Central part of lake in mid June."
553052,Guest,2005-11-11 17:40:00,0,Wrong....on LS Once you have in possession your limit you are done fishing for that species. This includes your shore lunch fish. 4 fish>1 for lunch = 3 back to camp or 2 in boat and keep fishing.
553053,Jimmy Jig,2005-11-11 19:03:00,1905,"There is nothing wrong with catch and release on walleyes in L.S. I have cleared with warden and its OK with them, just release as soon as caught. I have been checked with my limit and warden said, ""its caught and release from now on"" ."
553058,MN_Moose,2005-11-13 08:36:00,965,"Wrong, Parts of Ontario that don't feed into Lac Seul you can have live caught fish in live well. Tributaries of Lac Seul such as English river, an angler may not posses live fish other than minnow bait."
553060,Guest,2005-11-13 12:54:00,0,One of the posts stated that you cant even have water in the live well. I have a section in my live well for keeping minnows alive and the water will flow into the entire live well. Would it be unlawfull to just keep live minnows in the livewell and keep the dead fish in a seperate cooler?
553061,Guest,2005-11-13 15:08:00,0,You would be fine if you kept the fish in a separate cooler. If they caught you with fish in water alive in a livewell you would have a problem. The whole reason for this is that they do not want you to cull...you need to make a decision right when you catch the fish what you want to do.

553082,Guest,2005-11-14 22:42:00,0,"That's correct. LS is a must kill lake, meaning any fish you are going to keep must be killed or dead when placed into the cooler or ""dead well"". Last season another boat in camp put too much ice in the cooler and when it thawed by the end of the day there was enough water to allow the fish they were keeping to swim, busted by a warden, to the tune of several hundred bucks. And it is all to prevent you from Culling out fish at the end of the day, releasing very stressed fish, that have a 50/50 chance of survival. Just keep the 16"" and release everything else after you take some pictures. The replica mounts are better anyway in my opinion."
552945,Guest,2005-11-03 23:15:00,0,"If you wait, they will be filled up. They return almost all of their guests every year, I make my reservation for the next year while I'm there. Just a warning, you snooze, you lose. Good Luck"
552948,AllenW,2005-11-04 07:10:00,11482,"Thanks Steve, unfortnately some of us will have to put in for vacation and can't get it ok'd this early for next year, we're trying to do 2 boats this year and it makes it even harder with 4 of us all at the same company. Al"
553025,MrEyes,2005-11-10 00:07:00,360,"Evergreen, The owners are TOP SHELF PERIOD!!! They have quality boats, cabins and would do anything to insure a good trip PERIOD!!! Mark"
553030,Guest,2005-11-10 07:34:00,0,"If you do not own your own boat, Evergreen has the nicest rental boat you could ever find. It is a heavy 18++ foot Misty River and it has a 50 hp on it. It plows through waves without any problems. It is set up for Lac Seul. Since no livewells are allowed to be used on Lac Seul, the livewell on the boat has been converted to extra storage. There are also two aerated baitwells. There is a dock person who cleans and organizes your boat each morning. The cabins are also very clean and modern, and the owners are about the nicest you could ever meet. I think that the owners of Evergreen should put on a course for other resort owners on how to do things right."
553036,AllenW,2005-11-10 12:53:00,11482,No livewells? I take it live bait is not allowed? Might put a crimp on the trip...:) Al
553040,Guest,2005-11-10 14:10:00,0,"You can use livebait, that is what the two aerated livewells are for. They have a policy on Lac Seul where all fish you bring in the boat to keep you must immediately kill. Evergreen supplies wheeled coolers with ice, and a club in every boat. This is why there is no livewell usage. If you have a livewell on your boat, do not fill it with water. fill it with ice."
553043,AllenW,2005-11-10 19:18:00,11482,"Thanks for the info, is that just Evergreen or the whole lake? I think I'll pass if its the whole lake then. I'm sure they have there reasons for it, whatever they are. Al"
553044,Guest,2005-11-10 19:49:00,0,"I believe you have to kill any fish you keep in Ontario. We used ice in our live well and were shown how to break the neck on the Walleyes, very easy, just grab under the head and lift while holding the back behind the head with the other hand. The nice thing about fishing in Ontario is that you can catch and release after you catch your limit. Ron"
553045,Guest,2005-11-10 20:08:00,0,when we fish on LAC SUEL we bleed them and put them on ice. If you have to kill them anyway its the way to go. makes a great white fillet when you bleed them. Not sure why the other gentleman wouldn't go because if you to kill them. just keep a few 16 inchers to eat and the play catch and release all day.
553046,Guest,2005-11-10 21:05:00,0,"Breaking the neck is definately better than clubbing them. Breaking the neck is more instantaneous and the meat is much softer because the fish does not experience those moments of extreme stress between the first and second, or third blow. NWO Fishing Bum"
552732,Guest,2005-10-20 16:27:00,0,IF YOU COULD PICK A RESORT ON LAC SEUL HOUSE KEEPING BRINGING OWN BOAT. CLOSE FISHING GUIDE A FEW DAYS WHAT RESORT WOULD YOU PICK.. THANKS JAKE IF YOU HAVE WEB SITE THAT WOULD BE GREAT

552865,Rich J,2005-10-27 20:18:00,65,"I would recommend Lac Seul Evergreen Lodge, great owners and cabins. Rich Jhttp://www.lacseulwalleye.com/"
552867,Guest,2005-10-27 22:29:00,0,"My recomendation is Onaway Lodge. Great owners, great docks, great facilities, and located 15 miles or so south of Ear Falls in the middle of the northern section of the lake. If you do a search type in ""Lac Seul Onaway Lodge"" and it will come up. Or 1-888-662-9291. Blair & Kathy Campbell. It is a lodge that caters to fisherman, so if you are looking for a swimming beach, campfires and sing alongs, this ain't the place. They fill up fast with returnee's from the previous year so call soon."
552877,AllenW,2005-10-28 17:30:00,11482,"Thanks guys, having trouble with the Onaway web site, but will keep trying. Al"
552934,Guest,2005-11-02 21:49:00,0,"email address for Onaway is [email protected] I have an old brochure, but it is just like everyone else's. Nice pictures. The best thing to do is call them. It may be Moose season so Blair might be hard to get in touch with but they will answer email. Our group will be ther next year last week of June. Another item that may be a consideration, Onaway is Friday to Friday, not Sat.to Sat. I like it because crossing the border on friday is MUCH easier than on Sat. morning. In fact I drive up to Ft. Francis on Thurs. stay at the Super 8, sleep in, have breakfast, and make the rest of the drive to camp, getting in around 2pm rested and ready to FISH. Good Luck"
552936,AllenW,2005-11-03 06:46:00,11482,"Thanks Steve, I'm looking for a Lac Seul or LOTW trip next year, mostly for walleyes, notherns/muskies. Been doing the Red Lake trip for 20+ years now and would like to try somewhere different. Not looking for sing a longs, can't sing worth a hoot and don't remember the cords to Kum Ba Yah, so I'd rather go fish...:) I'll email them and try to get a brocure, no hurry as we're not planning on going till next fall. Al"
552942,Guest,2005-11-03 16:06:00,0,Ojibway Outfitters or Evergreen Lodge. Both do housekeeping and bring your own boat. Both have web sites. One on northeast side and other on west side.
