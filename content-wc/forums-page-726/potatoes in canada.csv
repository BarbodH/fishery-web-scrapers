552953,Guest,2005-11-04 14:02:00,0,How much time does it take to load potatoes in with the other stuff you bring?
552882,Guest,2005-10-29 09:57:00,0,can you bring in can potatoes in to canada
552883,Jimmy Jig,2005-10-29 11:49:00,1905,Yes
552884,Guest,2005-10-29 11:56:00,0,"But, why?"
552887,Catman59,2005-10-29 14:16:00,345,"It aint the taters..........its the American dirt that ""could"" be on them. Same reason you cant bring crawlers in dirt."
552888,Jimmy Jig,2005-10-29 15:12:00,1905,"Its not the dirt. Its the Mop-Top Virus, its spread though seed potatoes. Raw potatoes have eyes and they can grow. Processed spuds will not grow any new potatoes in Canada and spread the virus. This virus showed up in Maine. Maybe in other states by now. Canada has better potatoes anyway!"
552889,Guest,2005-10-29 20:13:00,0,"It isn't worth taking the time to haul spuds. Man, that's about like bringing your own ice."
552891,Bill Krejca,2005-10-30 08:43:00,6107,Re: better spuds - All that I've purchased up there were from the U.S. These are supposedly under supervised control.
552898,jigman 2003,2005-10-31 06:28:00,981,"I have started to bring in frozen potatoes. They are legal, and quicker to get prepared anyway. You can buy hash browns, american fries, steak fries, cottage fries, etc. A little more expensive, but your time is worth something also."
552908,Guest,2005-10-31 13:34:00,0,I just bring a potato gun and shoot them across the border at the Falls
552909,Guest,2005-10-31 15:25:00,0,My son and I were searched at Fort Francis in September. They found our potatoes and made us throw them in the dumpster. The Mantitoba Reds weren't very good.
