He loves to catch big Pike an Muskies. I love walleyes. We dont need much, comfortable, clean,, rustic is ok too. Got college tuition staring me in the eyes so price is also a consideration. We are looking for something around the 1st or second week of june. I have a Ranger boat also,, Am I better off leaving that at home and using camp boats."
553087,VMS,2005-11-15 14:11:00,1103,"If you are looking for Muskies, you will need to wait until the third weekend in June...that should be the opening weekend. I would suggest sabaskong bay lodge on Lake of the woods. http://www.sabaskongbaylodge.com They have a daily rate of $55 american per person for houskeeping plan. Dock fee of $10 per day, with gas and bait available. You can use their boats or yours...and they are only 5 miles from Morson by boat. The cabins are definitely rustic...have running water and hot showers with beautiful views of the lake. If you book before 12/15, you will get a 10% discount on lodging rates. Steve"

553095,Ia Walihntr,2005-11-16 09:38:00,320,eyezforcash likes to fish for walleyes. He wont have much luck on either Manitou lakes.
553106,Guest,2005-11-17 09:03:00,0,Try the Resorts at Northwest Angle Great fishing.....Great ppl.....Great prices
553107,Guest,2005-11-17 09:34:00,0,Try Red Deer Lodge on Sabaskong Bay-- Drive in lodge and its not to far into canada so if you get in early you can get another 1/2 day of fishing in..They also have a website www.reddeerlodge.com
553112,Guest,2005-11-17 14:53:00,0,"I was looking at it in the light that it would be his sons trip, ie good pike and muskie. That is why I mentioned this resort, your right there are no walleyes on the manitou, but they have portage lakes with walleyes in them. good luck."
553114,Shorelunch,2005-11-17 14:57:00,554,"My vote would be for LOTW - great scenery and fishing. Saboaskong Bay resort is nice. I'd also look at Buena Vista and Mylie's out of Morson along with New Moon Landing and Duck Bay, too."
553115,Mark_NE,2005-11-17 15:57:00,58,"Andy Myers Lodge on Eagle Lake, the best for everything. Steve provides a lot of variety for his quests, 4X4's to remote lakes (within an hour or less from the main lodge), fly-ins and of course Eagle itself. My son and I have been going there every year for the last five and we wouldn't consider anyplace else. Walleye, Pike, Bass, Lakers, and of course Muskie; what ever you want Steve will make it work for you. Best guides around. You can go ""housekeeping"" to save a buck or two, but the American Plan is the best, great food and plenty of it. We always go with a guide, a few more bucks, but for a once a year trip you get what you pay for.www.andymyerslodge.com"
553116,Guest,2005-11-17 16:52:00,0,"Lac Seul will fit your needs. Lots of different lodges from which to choose,lots of walleyes,lots of northerns,lots of fun."
