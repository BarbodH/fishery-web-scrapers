We were not disapointed approx 275 fish were boated from 3LBS to 12.5 LBS all but 47 were released. The Bay Of Quinte is a fantastic fishery, with warm water temps the big girls have not moved in yet, but by the end of the month 10 to 12 LBS is the norm, last year I caught my personal best 32.5 inches long 22"" girth and wieghing in at 14.5 LBS. This year ministery of Natural Resourses (MNR) has removed the slot limit from the Bay, but you are only allowed one (keeper) over the 25 inch mark and 4 below.All of the Walleye were taken trolling using inline boards or the big duel boards,a few were flat lining.The fish were suspended at 20 to 50 feet in 80 to 100 feet of water, deep divers like Manns Strech +20's were popular as were Walleye Minnows, and Repala Tail Dancers.I plan to head back this weekend for another go at the big girls , hoping to get one larger than 14.5 LBS, 16 LBS are taken there every year , I hope this year it will be my turn. For More info on the fishing at the Bay Of Quinte you can send me a PM, I'm only to happy to help any one that is planning a trip to this great fishery Phil(Big-O) <!!>< So Much Water , So Little time"

If you can't get any Eyes,she's always good for some Drum catching.I also invited RJ and his better half,that way if the fishing is a bad as last year,we'll just go partying all weekend.With that kind of report Big-O,you might need a body guard your next trip.Captain Hank won't be a happy camper,he's coming to Merlands you know. Bigfish--The hawkers caught all that was left,you OFN'ers might want to stay home."
