Int'l bridge here to be sold November 04, 2005 Press release The International Bridge and Terminal Company and the Minnesota Dakota and Western Railway (joint owners), and their parent companies, Abitibi-Consolidated and Boise Cascade, announced today the international bridge here is for sale pending any necessary government approvals. The companies have determined that owning the bridge is not a core business asset and are prepared to sell the bridge unit that crosses the Rainy River. The international bridge actually consists of two bridges side by sideÂ—a steel bridge constructed in 1908 and a concrete bridge built in 1979. The span of the steel bridge is 860 feet while the concrete bridge spans 949 feet. The companies plan to secure the services of marketing firm to advertise the sale of the bridge. The mayors of Fort Frances and International Falls were notified of the potential sale this morning. The international bridge here always has been privately-owned, and tolls have been collected throughout its history. Paper mills owned by Abitibi-Consolidated in Fort Frances and Boise Cascade in International Falls are located adjacent to the bridge. The bridge is operated 24 hours a day, and includes U.S. and Canadian Customs and Immigration offices since it is an international border crossing. The international bridge averages more than 800,000 vehicle crossings annually. It also serves utilities by supporting telephone, cable television, and natural gas lines. The bridge has undergone structural inspections annually, and every five years underwater inspections are conducted. Reports are provided after every inspection to the state of Minnesota and the province of Ontario."
