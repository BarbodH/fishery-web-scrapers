First 2 weeks of the opener or last 2 weeks of June....or anywhere inbetween? Which would you choose, and why? Thanks...Dave"

If you don't mind some possible snow and cold, the opener can be an adventure and there should be less pressure. Also, if you're going for multi-species, I don't think bass and muskie open until late June (you should check on this as I'm not sure what the regs are in that area)."
