We have been going to Minaki for the past 20+ years, and have done very well with walleye, pike, musky and smallies. I prefer the smallie fishing, but there are others in our group the exclusively fish the walleye. ....just curious. ChuckE"
553122,goater32,2005-11-18 11:18:00,8,hey there. we have been fishing tetu lake below whitedog dam and below the caribou dam. We like the place...just not a good number of larger pike. Walleyes have always been good to us. Plenty of fish in the low to mid 20's just looking for a change and maybe a little more size. Guess i am being greedy in a way
553123,Guest,2005-11-18 13:29:00,0,"I have been to Sportsman Lodge Nungusser Wine Lake Sportmans is the place for pike period. Plenty of walleye 14-15"" hundreds a day per person. Maybe a couple of 18"" walleye in a week.Pike 40"" plus everyday. This has been our experience late may early june. This is a fly-in Nungusser- We fished July 4 week. Once we found the walleye ,did pretty well.Many over 18"". Our group caught numerous 22-26 walleye. We did not fish for pike. Caught a few accidental 38-40"". Wine lake- wonderful experience except for fishing. Fished 1st week Sept. New lake for us and we struggled to catch walleye and trout.Probably caught more fish in one day at above camps than at Wine Lake. Walleye 16-22,4 lake trout ,ling, and fat and chubby 38"" pike. again did not fish for pike hard. Having said that may give it a second chance. We took our wives and had a wonderful time. hope this helps sidewinder"
553128,Guest,2005-11-18 21:52:00,0,"Goater, We fish the Winnepeg, above the Whitedog dam, and the associated lakes connected to the Winnepeg. The lakes include Big Sand, Little Sand, Rough Rock, Gun, Pistol and a few others. We've also fished the MacFarlane River and Black Sturgeon Rivers that connect to the Winnepeg, and have hiked into a few of the remote lakes that are up to 1/2 mile off the river. We put our boats in at Minaki and have about a 2 mile boat ride to the resort. I have either taken my 20 ft Ranger 692VS or my Nitro 896DC, for the past 9 years. In fact, I've been spending 2 consecutive weeks fishing there for the past 8 years, (during the last week of June and the first week in July). My boat partner and I usually manage to catch one or two northern a day that break 36"", and one of us usually gets a 42""+ in a week(plenty below these lenghts too). We generally get a Musky over 42"", with a few above 36"" plus in a week. We also usually catch 400+ smallmouth and 200+ walleye in a typical week, spending the majority of our time beating the banks for smallies and northern, and only really fishing for walleye when we get tired. The bigest northern we've ever caught over the past 20+ years at Minaki has been 48"" and the biggest Musky has be 55"". I feel the northern and musky fishing at Minaki has getten better over the past 5 years or so. We usually spend 50% of our time north of Minaki and 50% south of Minaki, depending on what we are fishing for and the weather. (There is a stretch of river south of Minaki known as the Big Stretch that can be really nasty if there is the slightest northerly or southerly wind.) In general, there is better walleye fishing up north, but better northern fishing down south of Minaki. I'm suprised you haven't gotten into many big northern (or musky) below the dams.... I've spent numerous weeks on Lake of the Woods, Rainy and Kabatogoma, but always like the fishing a Minaki the best. Chuck"
553136,Guest,2005-11-21 08:22:00,0,"If you want Big Pike with some hot lake trout action in the spring on the shoals and walleye action in portage lakes you should try South Bay lodge on Confederation Lake. www.southbaylodge.com I have been for the past two years and it was fantastic. Its a short boat ride(maybe 5 minutes) and its the only lodge on the lake so it was very secluded. We casted spoons and spinner baits for pike and were very successful. We were able to land 12 over 38"" with the biggest being 42"" between the 4 guys in our group. We also spent a day in one of the portage lakes for walleye and wore our wrists out jigging in walleye. We didn't really try the lake trout fishing there but other guests were coming in with lake trout they had caught so i guess they were there. There are lots of good lakes and resorts in Canada, everyone just has to find the one they like and do well at. B. Pulliam"

553146,Guest,2005-11-22 09:14:00,0,We stay at Sunset Point. It is on the point downstream of the bridge (on the right hand side as you head downstream and kinda across from the old Minaki Lodge). There's a big floating boathouse on the very tip of the point--we stay in the big cabin that has the deck that overlooks the water and has the dock out front. It is owned by Ken Stunell. Chuck

553104,VMS,2005-11-17 08:31:00,1103,How far into Canada are you willing to travel? This can help somewhat since it gives others an idea as to locations you are willing to go to for seclusion. Steve
553105,Guest,2005-11-17 08:39:00,0,"I have never been to myself, but have heard great things from friends about Ghost River Lodge, and Separation Lake Lodge. Both are in Ontario. Walleye and pike lakes. The other place that I have heard about, and tried to book for myself next year but couldn't because they are booked my week is Lost Island Resort on Lac Seul."

553113,Guest,2005-11-17 14:56:00,0,"We go to Camp Manitou for muskies and some lake trout, but no walleyes. The same owner owns Happy Landing Lodge on Pipestone, we have been getting the brochure for a couple of years now and it looks like they catch alot of walleyes on their portage lakes. I think their site is www.happylandingfishing.com or www.happylandingfishing.net I'm not sure which one is the right one. Good Luck."
553117,Guest,2005-11-17 19:11:00,0,"Check out Wine Lake Camp. Boat in 23 miles to only camp on Wine Lake. Great camp, very reasonably priced. Herb and Ann are awesome hosts! Walleye fishing isn't great, but tons of pike, and some lake trout. Website is www.winelakecamp.com. Hope this helps."
