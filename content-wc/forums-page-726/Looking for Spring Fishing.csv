We will need a Resort that supplys boats and we will do our own cooking. My wife has never fished in Canada and I would love to find a place that she can catch some fish and hopefully want to go back every year. Our budget for the week is a maximum of $2500 and I would prefer a drive to resort. Thanks, Ray"

They are drive in and all you need to show up with is a fishing pole, and that is not even definte. From their lodge you can fish Minataki and Lac Seul both of which have great June walleye fishing, especially after the sanctuaries open up the third week of june. they book up fast though and may be full for next year already. your can reach them at 807-737-2630, ask for Nicki the office manager and let her know that Bryan from Indiana sent you. They will take care of you and your wife."
