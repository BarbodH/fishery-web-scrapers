People are comming back to the hotel grinning from ear to ear...Its just a smorg out there 70-100 fish in a day is not uncommon. Most of these fish are in the 16-20 range with the odd big one. 8 - 11 lb fish are still being caught every day. Every day on the water now is a bonus......Not really to much to tell about spots fish are all over the place. Shinners, live bait its all working..."

Had I known that this weather would hold out like this, I'd be seeing you for another trip. Unless I can create some magic, won't be back until next September. Thank you and your staff for some great hospitality. Just tell Kim this is from Marlan's son and she'll know who this is! See ya next year and great luck on the rest of the fall fishing. Hawgeye"

Don't know if its the last of the run but will fish some time this week and will keep everyone posted. Something about that east wind that is no good for that lake, we still caught fish but it was slow."

Do you trust that we have provided you with enough rope so that your cinder block will fall safely to the ground? Blue, do you trust that I do not want to see you die here tonight? Blue, you're my boy! Honey, Frank the Tank is not coming back"
