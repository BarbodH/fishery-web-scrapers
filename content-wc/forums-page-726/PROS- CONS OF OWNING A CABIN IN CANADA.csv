552960,Guest,2005-11-06 06:42:00,0,"Hey Phil how are you doing?? Hope your getting better!! Someday I'm going to own that island. Anyways I've had a cabin on Lobstick bay LOTW and is part of old resort that went condo. Ours is pretty new and doesn't require much to mantain, however it's hard raising a family, running a business and being able to get up there when you really need to(to help w/ any condo needs). It is nice being condo as everything is done for us, turn on/off water, pull docks etc, we just have to pay. It has turned out to be a great investment although it's hard to say if I'll see the return($$ anyways). I hope to spend lots of time up there once the kids are gone. Oct would be great, fishing, bear,grouse and deer hunting what could be better? Anyways we bought before the prices went apespit. I don't know if you can find a place for $100K anymore and most are $200 on up!! I may see the return when Canada goes too dumn far w/ their regulations and other crap. They make it harder and harder for me to go back, esp. now w/ gas prices!Dennis"
552992,Guest,2005-11-08 11:11:00,0,"Another option is to look for cabins on leased private or Government land. This is more common in eastern Ontario , eg Wawa Area. Where a cabin on 1 acre can run $35,000 CDN to $100,000 CDN and no taxes if not in improvement area (most are not in improvement areas) leases are roughly $1000 /yr CDN Many Americans own camps up that way, some are road access , some boat access etc.some own complete Islands But the prices the cabin owners sell for are going up /talk to any realestate agent in Wawa or Sault. The private land owners we lease from are prevented from adding more leased cottage lands to the lakes by MNR regulations so supply and demand of this not well known scenario is going to drive prices up . And no mine is not for sale ...maybe in another 4 years !"
553032,Guest,2005-11-10 09:49:00,0,"HEY WAWAJAKE 1 I HAVE NEVER BEEN AROUND THE WAWA AREA .... HOW WOULD YOU SAY IT COMPARES TO THE NESTOR FALLS AREA ? I AM ASSUMING YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND THAT AREA. FISHING PRESSURE? TOWNS? LAKES , LODGES , ETC...? THANKS FOR THE INFO."
553034,Guest,2005-11-10 12:09:00,0,"I have only been in the Nestor Falls area once and it was not for fishing. Wawa area is 2 and half hours North of Sault USA border. Most of fishing pressure is from Americans , May and June, by July the pressure is low and cabin owners can easily find a quiet good spot on their lakes. But every lake is different and there are hundreds of them that do not even have the small amount of cabins that is typical. Many a drive in , or ATV, or canoe in lake within an hour of anywhere. In the winter many of the American cabin owners buy a Snowmachine trail pass and spend a week or weekends to tour the bush on machines or ice fish and then crack a cold one by the cabin fire. But I guess that scenario is available anywhere in Northern Ontario. Fishing pressure is non existent in off months and then the skills to find the walleye and the secret holes comes to the surface. Nothing like being a local on the lake and having the visitors follow you, and then you leave them at a semi good hole and go to the solace of your best spots. :)"
552915,Guest,2005-11-01 09:06:00,0,"JUST INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM YOU GUYS WHO OWN A FISHING PLACE (CABIN) IN CANADA .... WHERE IS IT? , HOW LONG HAVE YOU OWNED IT? GOOD POINTS , BAD POINTS , OVERALL EXPENSE, HOW DID YOU FIND IT? THINGS TO LOOK FOR WHILE INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE LAKEFRONT CABINS... THANKS IN ADVANCE."
552917,bigfish1965,2005-11-01 13:44:00,3210,Wherever you go have a look at the property taxes first. Some area are very affordable while others are insanely expensive.
552920,Guest,2005-11-01 14:48:00,0,"Pros: Have a place whenever you want, don't have to worry about others, sense of ownership, a place to pass on to your kids, a good investment property. Cons: There always seems to be a ton of work that needs to be done which can be difficult unless your retired and have the time (upkeep), taxes, insurance, maintenance costs. My brother, father and I bought property in NW about 12 years ago and so far the pros have outweighed the cons...and it's turned out to be a very very very good investment property."
552922,Trailerguy,2005-11-01 17:23:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I bought a cottage on Wabaskang Lake, Perrault Falls, Ont. in the spring of 2000, the exchange rate was $1.50 at that time. I'd been fishing that area for 20+ years. Taxes are cheap enough, elecrticity is cheap (.04 CND) per kilowatt. Overall annual upkeep expenses aren't anymore than the annual trip to camp used to be, and I can spend more time every year. I've also made a bunch of improvements. They really cut into my fishing time, but the property value has probably doubled. I hope wifey is about done with the honey do's, I intend to spend more time on the water next summer. ;) Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
552925,Guest,2005-11-01 18:51:00,0,"you guys just about hit it on the head. Lots of pros especially if you are in a good location when it comes to fishing and hunting. you cant keep it too nice though or else people perminantly borrow things. i have a problem with anything more expensive than a cordless drill. After a few years of hard core updating, you do have to count on at least 1 work day for every week you spend up there just to maintain. not too big a deal though as i usually have a dozen or so volunteers that come up fishing with me and offer to help, some even chip in a few bucks to cover utilities. however, we were annexed by sioux lookout about 3 years ago and our taxes are almost prohibitivly high. they throw my remote lakeside shack in with the assessments of the full resident lakeside luxury homes in town. not to fair. they also nickle and dime you to death. i have to rent the land from the queen to run my elelctric line in as well as pay a monthly minimum to have the service. I will work till my fingers bleed though just to see my two little rugrats soak in the northern exposure and get a good understanding for what is really important in life. like a 5 lb smalley they pulled in last year while fishing for perch. hope this helps, give me a call if you have any questions in your pursuits."
552926,Guest,2005-11-02 07:59:00,0,"THANKS FOR THE INFO.... IT MAY BE YEARS OFF , BUT I THINK I WILL OWN A CABIN SOMEWHERE IN NWO. DO ANY OF YOU HAVE FLY-IN OR BOAT -IN PLACES... I COULD SEE HOW THESE COULD BE PROBLEMATIC, BUT I THINK THE PRICE MAY BE CHEAPER. WILDCAT.... DO YOU HAVE AN EMAIL ADDRESS I CAN GET WITH YOU AT? AARON IN. WHAT PART OF INDIANA ARE YOU FROM? ANY OTHER INFO FROM ANYONE ELSE WOULD BE GREAT!!! I COULD TALK ABOUT CANADA FISHING FOR HOURS..."
552927,Guest,2005-11-02 08:25:00,0,"Fate had its course when we fell into ours as i was not looking. I had a decade of canada trips behind me and one bad lodge experience the year before the opportunty presented itself so everything kind of hit me in the head at once. Me and my core of 8 guys always picked up the real estate books up there and imagined how cool it would be to have an island somewhere but when it came down to it, for family, for convenience the road access lake front one we have now seemed to work out for the absolute best. I found it rather amusing too, that all 8 of them were so gung ho of purchasing this place together with each other on day one but come money time the only one standing was my wife. God love her for letting me talk her into this ""incredible opportunity"" come closing day but she really enjoys it now with the kids. you can contact me directly here in Indiana at [email protected]"
552928,Guest,2005-11-02 11:49:00,0,Bob....Our place is also a boat in. I live in Greenwood. Email me [email protected]
552943,Guest,2005-11-03 16:21:00,0,"I lived on an island year round. It was ten miles out of Sioux Narrows in the vicinity of Whitefish Narrows. Three weeks during ice out we could not go anywhere, it was great. I think there are better investments but there are not better times. Sure you might make a few bucks but that is not what it is all about. If you own, you will go often-------------make sure you are really cut out for that. Plus depending on many factors, it may take a while to sell. Anyway, it was a wonderfully profound experience. One that has left lasting effects on not only me but my kids as well. It is amazing how many friends you never knew you had til you bought that cabin!!!!!! The indian guides used to stop out in front of the island and tell thier clients about these crazy Americans who live out here in the winter. You know you are special when the indians refer to you as crazy. If you can afford it, if you love it, go for it. Don't do it for the money, there are better places for that."
552949,Guest,2005-11-04 08:36:00,0,THANKS PHIL... HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I HEARD THAT YOU WERE ILL. DID YOU WRITE A BOOK ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCES? I AGREE ABOUT THE $ DEAL.... THIS IS STRICTLY A LOVE OF N.W.O.
