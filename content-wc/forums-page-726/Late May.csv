I know it can change in a moment, but generally what id the weather up there at that time? Is it in the 70's yet? or is still in the 50's for normal high? Is the fishing better in June? I am waiting for good answers to print up for my skepticle friends."

First year on Lac Seul in 98 was in the 70's then, some years since there were a few white flakes in the air during May. Just go prepared for all kinds of weather."
