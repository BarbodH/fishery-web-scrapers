553014,rockpt,2005-11-09 12:30:00,589,"Canada taking action against passport proposal November 09, 2005, Fort Frances Times By Melanie Béchard The federal government released a document last week outlining its official position on the proposed plan by the United States to make document requirements more stringent, and continues to hold discussions with American officials to keep travel at the border both secure and efficient. We don't like the initiative. It's causing us a lot of trouble and we're working very closely with border states who are also against it, said Neil Reeder, director general of the communications bureau at Foreign Affairs Canada. Reeder was speaking to a group of journalists in Ottawa on a trip with Foreign Affairs' Media Outreach Program. Last December, U.S. President George W. Bush signed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) which, among other things, calls on the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and implement a plan to step up document requirements for both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals entering the country. That plan is the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which states that U.S. citizens and non-immigrant aliens may enter the United States only with passports or such alternatives as the Secretary of Homeland Security may designate as satisfactorily establishing identity and citizenship. There has been concern on both sides of the border that such an initiative will cause a reduction in tourism as well as increased wait times at borders, slowing down trade and having an adverse effect on both economies. The implications are not to be underestimated for the country, said Liberal MP Dan McTeague (Pickering-Scarborough East), who is the parliamentary secretary to Foreign Affairs minister Pierre Pettigrew. We're very concerned, obviously, for what this will mean for trade, McTeague noted. It's clear that certain border states are very opposed to this. According to a study by the Canadian Tourism Commission released in July, forcing travellers to carry passports could result in the cumulative loss of nearly 7.7 million inbound trips by Americans between 2005 and 2008, and an estimated gross shortfall in direct receipts by the Canadian tourism industry of $1.7 billion (Cdn.) The same report estimates the U.S. tourism industry will lose some $785 million (Cdn.) and about 3.5 million trips by Canadians to the U.S. during that same time period. According to the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, Canadian visits generated $10.9 billion (U.S.) for the U.S. national economy in 2003 alone. The impact will not be limited to the tourism sector. Border congestion resulting from this initiative could also slow down and congest our key border crossings, leading to increased border crossing time and additional cost for manufacturers, importers, and exporters who move their products across our shared border, the Canadian government noted in its official comment on the WHTI. These increased costs likely would be passed on to consumers, making those products and associated industries less competitive with external competitors, the report reads. Large border cities such as Detroit, Mich. and Buffalo, N.Y. also have complained of the initiative, noting large numbers of Canadians cross the border to attend professional sporting events. It is not the intention of the U.S. government to harm the economy of either country, McTeague noted. For them, security trumps economics, he admitted. Economic considerations aside, delays at the international border can create new security threats. Goods at rest can become potential targets for tampering by terrorists or by those involved with contraband, and idling engines can have significant environmental impacts, Canada's comment reads. The damage may outdo the good it might serve, McTeague warned. The U.S. has set two deadlines for the WHTI: Dec. 31, 2006 for air and sea crossings, and Dec. 31, 2007 for land crossings. Ottawa's approach so far has been to try to convince the U.S. to push back the second deadline in order to have more time to negotiate an alternative to the passport. One proposal has included developing a driver's licence with enhanced security features. The document likely would be more affordableand more convenientthan a passport. Currently, only about 23 percent Americans have passports, compared to 37 percent of Canadians."
553021,Fred_G,2005-11-09 18:44:00,908,"I don't understand how requiring a passport would make wait times at the border longer. It seems to me that it should speed things up. The background check has already been done, therefore the border agent would not need to take as much time to process a person through. Or am I missing something?"
553022,Guest,2005-11-09 19:15:00,0,"Yes Fred, I think you are missing something. I have crossed the border maybe 100 times or so in my life, and I have had to show documentation once! It is normally 4-5 questions and I am on my way, about 20 seconds it takes. Having everyone in the vehicle show their passport to the border agent would definately slow things down considerably. And if the agent actually scans or verifies the documents, it would take even longer. NWO Fishing Bum"
553027,Andre M,2005-11-10 05:11:00,86,"I cross the border every week-end starting mid-April to mid-October and, in most of the case I present my passport but in some occasions I present my driver license and my business card and it's about the same amount of time for the two (passport vs drivers license) The thing that slow down the traffic a lot, is the search inside our old good Coleman cooler. Imagine how dangerous is a rib steak for our US friends. Believe it or not beef is the ennemy not alive beef but a nice thick rib steak. I don't think the US will be safer because of the passport obligation; any criminal will find a way to get a ""clean"" passport. But it's something that we will have to live with in the future."
553028,phishfearme,2005-11-10 05:49:00,1242,i don't think the delays will be caused by reviewing the passport - the delays will be caused by the people trying to cross without a passport. the first year or two will be total chaos. - phish
553029,jigman 2003,2005-11-10 06:40:00,981,I think you hit it right on the head phish. Too many people trying to cross without them because they figure they won't get asked. The first year or two of waiting in line will be painful for those of us who follow the law and just get the passport.
553059,Guest,2005-11-13 10:45:00,0,"The last 2 years on our trip up north, our ID's have checked going in and out of Canada. Seems that's becoming the norm. We go through at Int'l Falls. From my recent experience, I don''t see where checking passports is going to delay crossing. I'm sure like you all have said though, the first few years will be trying because of those who will test the new law."
553108,Guest,2005-11-17 10:18:00,0,I think that the delays would be about the same as they are now coming into the states. Depends what Canada does in response. We have had to show ID the 2 times we went across into Canada once we were told to have a nice day and be on our way. The other time they ran a records check. I think the point of the article is that with so few having passports will folks get them or just stay home. I think those of us that fish in Canada will get the passport so we can continue to get back in the USA after our trip. This isn't a requirement to get into Canada (yet) only to get home. Seems they are up inarms over this passport deal but seem unconcerned over the issues of netting
553109,Guest,2005-11-17 10:37:00,0,PASSPORTS ARE NOT REQUIRED UNTIL 2007....RIGHT?
553120,jigman 2003,2005-11-18 07:27:00,981,"Yes, sooner or later Canada will require the passport. I believe if you are a visitor there from any country but the U.S. they already do. The big argument right now is due to the U.S. requiring a passport to re-enter the U.S. Funny, I would be willing to bet that a lot of the people whining about this were also some of the loudest voices saying the U.S. should have done something to protect us before 9/11. People talk smart until it effects them."
553111,VMS,2005-11-17 14:02:00,1103,"Am I missing something here? My understanding is that a passport will be needed to get back into the US...not leaving it. Please excuse my ignorance on this since I have yet to get my passport but know I will need it... But.... it seems (from my understanding) that if the US is requiring it, going into Canada will be nothing different than checking license and/or passport if you have one, along with the same general questions. Is Canada planning on requiring the passport as well? Thanks Steve"
