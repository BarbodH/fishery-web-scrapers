553090,Guest,2005-11-15 15:43:00,0,"I had a few ""GREAT DAY'S"" this year on a trip to a Lac Seul outpost. I had my son with me for five days. What a time we had and what a joy to catch fish and watch the world go by. We caught way more then any two people should be allowed and didn't really work very hard at it. We did alot of cruising and seeing the lake, eagles, loons, etc. What a trip. Loved one's and best friends fishing together is a great day!"

553007,Wonderer,2005-11-09 01:45:00,10,"Ive read a lot of posts in WC over the years, and one thing I still notice. Thats many people saying how big, how many fish they have caught on what ever body of water, and if they have had a bad day or even entire trip, they blame it on everything under the sun. Yes, at one time I was one of those anglers that went fishing for one thing. To see how many I could put in the boat and the bigger the better too. I did not care if they were full of eggs, off spawning beds, or even 16 18lb northern pike, 5 lb bass, or even 10lb walleye. Who cared (in those days) Now that I am older and maybe wiser I look at fishing a little different. It is no longer how many, or how big. All I want is to catch a few for a nice shorelunch either by myself or with an angling buddy. My angling day today could start at maybe 10am or even 11am. Grab a few walleye or even a northern pike, Stop off at a beaver house and grab some wood, and have a nice quite lunch by myself if necessary and watch the world go by. A better way yet, is to go out at 3 or 4 in the afternoon, and do a supper. Then sit back and watch the sunset and slowly cruise back to town. I dig watching boats moving around (whatever lake) trying this spot and that spot. My idea is to relax and take in the scenery and I wish others would sit back and smell the roses the same way. After all you are on probably holidays and away from the office, factory or even maybe wife and kids and no phone. Stop beating yourself to death trying to catch the biggest, and the most and sit back and see what you are really missing. Im been lucky in my lifetime. Ive fished a good number of lakes here in Ontario from Temagami, to Algonquin Park, all the great lakes Eagle, Wabigoon and LOTW. I rushed through most of those trying to outfish everyone else in the boat and went home more tired than when I left. Now its different. I dig sitting on an island watching the world go by Heres a true story. I once fished crappie with a gent. We were just hauling them in. It was raining cats and dogs. Like I mean ruddy raining. We had a older boat, no bilge pump or live well, and the fish were in the bottom of the boat swimmin around. All of a sudden the fishing action stopped cold. The guy looked at me and more or less asked what we should do NOW. I said ""Fish in the Bottom of the boat"". That is true. believe it or not."
553012,Guest,2005-11-09 07:54:00,0,"Sorry it took you so long to realize that big and plenty is not the key to enjoying fishing. Dont get me wrong big and plenty is fun but the real joy of fishing is in the bounty of nature and the time with friends and family you get to spend. My best memories on the water are the ones that let us laugh at ourselves and tell stories about each other and sometimes the big one that got away. Many of my fishing buddies from the past have gone to the big lake in the sky but every time Im on the water I remember their faces and the good times we had....just fishing. Im lucky enough to enjoy the company of my wife, my children and my grandchildren fishing. They all love to fish and their joy makes my day, every day. Thank God for fishing."
553015,Guest,2005-11-09 12:34:00,0,I've heard it said like this: New fisherman - Just want to catch a fish! Next - Gotta catch a limmit Next - Gotta catch a Hog Next - Gotta catch a limmit of Hogs Next - Just want to catch a fish! End - Just want to go fishing! You've made your journey through the cycle... Congrats!
553016,Guest,2005-11-09 15:11:00,0,"But man, you're ruining the beaver hut! Poor beaver. Or, poor fish? LOL Either way, to-each-his-own. If catching lots is your forte, great. If catching the big one is your forte, great. If sitting on an island watching the world go by is your forte, great. But I think it's wrong for anyone to tell someone else what his or her forte should be. Congratulations on finding happiness."

553039,Guest,2005-11-10 14:05:00,0,Dud....me thinks you are unable to understand the concept behind the thoughts Wonderer has expressed so well. Must be hard to type with boxing gloves on..........
553041,Guest,2005-11-10 15:02:00,0,"Wow, you guys are so quick to judge. I, as a matter of fact, am in the same boat as he is.....but you have already jumped down my throat, so I guess it doesn't matter. Either way, someone pushing their beliefs on someone else, is pretty crappy."
553051,AllenW,2005-11-11 17:23:00,11482,"Have to admit, it may not have been the best way to say, stop and smell the roses. Almost sounded like you were not a good person if you didn't do what he was doing. One of the unfortnate problems with the written word, what they wrote may not always be what you read. Al who stops and smells on his way to find a lunker...:)"
