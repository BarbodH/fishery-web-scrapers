552938,Guest,2005-11-03 11:15:00,0,"So far it seems the majority think that the LOTW has already been affected or will be in the future. The answer about the economic issue on the Indians is worthy of thought, but don't they already get checks from the government. I don't know what the answer is but do believe that once they finish this lake then they will be after Lac Seul, St. Joseph, Eagle and the others. It takes a government with courage that says we are going to stop this madness cause it doesn't make any sense. Kind of like what W would do (like him or not)."
552939,Guest,2005-11-03 11:50:00,0,"My life slogan: If nobody buys walleye, nobody will net walleye."
552950,Guest,2005-11-04 08:45:00,0,"Thats great tmac, if no body buys walleyes, no one will nnet walleyes. I agree. People should choose to eat fish and other food items more sustainable. Not just because the netting occurs in out backyard or where you go for a vacation. It happens many places where practices are not sustainable. Ask questions before you buy anything, where did it come from, how was it farmed. Look at the state of the cod fishery or any ocean fishery for that matter. Most people dont think about it because they can go to safeway and get there fish. Or if the cod isnt there, buy the salmon. Stop to think about it and ask questions."
553018,Guest,2005-11-09 15:56:00,0,Not buying walleye would certainly help but many people will not support this as they do not care what happens in nw ontario. This is mostly a political/judicial issue and probably needs to be resolved in that venue. But the restaurants and food stores are a good place to start.
552793,snaggletooth,2005-10-25 18:22:00,135,"Its a big lake, who knows the TRUTH ? The lake is managed by estimates. One thing is for sure, they aren't ""so called nets"". I have snagged them with my lures. They are real! We fish Sabaskong Bay one week per year for musky only. But...the guides at the camp we go to tell us that its getting harder and harder for them to put their guests on quality walleye on a daily basis. I don't believe there is much, if any, monitoring of the netting quotas in the areas we fish. I am also amazed by the patience & understanding of the camp owners regarding this situation."

552794,Guest,2005-10-25 21:36:00,0,I heard one person has 29 nets right now around Firebag fishing crappie - kind of makes a farce of a game warden who is checking people for two fish. The whole situation is just stupid when all the money for the fish ends up in Warroad in the casino.

The fish did seem to run smaller this yr. 2. 14"" 10 17"" fish are fun to catch and taste great 3. For me, last yr was great fishing....had 8 10# walleyes in my boat. 4. Do not let ppl who fish the lake once or twice a yr determine if the lake is worth fishing. 5. netting on LOTW has gone on for yrs, will continue to go on. It is not the netters so much as the money needed to police the netting. 6. The Resorts on the Minnesota side (Angle Inlet) are great ppl who for the most part carve a living out of very little. Support them when you can. 7. To say that all the money from netting ends up at the casino in Warroad, well, thats just plain stupid !!!!!"

552876,Guest,2005-10-28 09:44:00,0,Well so far it seems a mixed bag. Some say had the best year ever and some say the fish are running smaller. Kind of seems that nearer Kenora gets more pressure. Makes sense to me that if processing plant is in Kenora then they would want to net near there at least until it becomes unproductive. Glad to hear the fishing was good near Sioux Narrows and up towards Andrew Bay. Any more testimonies out there?????
552880,PJM,2005-10-29 00:55:00,3516,"W. Willie I made 5 trips to Lake of the Woods in 2005 and fished from Sabaskong to Mcpherson Island. The average fish was in the 15 1/2 range which is a nice fish, hardly any in the 16 to 17 inch range and a few over 18in. The bigger fish were caught more west of Rubber Island , so I caught more quantity then quality as far as fish go. In October we were fishing near Nanogashing Channel on day and the next day we went though and there were Eagles, pelicans and sea gulls near the point so I check it out and there were dead fish everywhere so there must have been a net there sometime that night. It was a sad site to say the least and I'm not sure that there is anything can be done to prevent this. I know it is there right to net fish and I respect that but waste is something else. Red Lake in Minnesota was almost netted out and the Minnesota DNR went in and help restock the lake with help from the Red Lake band. I don't know if the Canadian goverment has the resources to restock the lake if something like this was happen and I hope it does not get that far. Crappie fishing in Miles Bay has been poor and I don't know if this is a result of netting or just a cycle the fish are in. With the Amount if 15 1/2 in fish I caught and released this year maybe next years class will be bigger. The fish were smaller in 2005 and the crappie fishing seemed to be better in early September. The weather was also different this summer with more heat and the lake levels were high early on might have changed fishing also."
552885,rockpt,2005-10-29 13:14:00,589,"This was my seventh year fishing Miles Bay, Sabaskong and Little Traverse. Two trips each year, eight days each trip, mostly for walleye. Overall, this year was a little better than average. The Oct. trip was good numbers and average size probably 15"". Most guys in our camp caught lots of walleye. Like PJM said, crappie were slow in Miles Bay this fall, and I suspect netting was a cause. Also, during the same week PJM was up, I saw a native pulling in a net at Sand Point (Naongashing), so I'm not surprised that PJM saw eagles there eating fish. Without making this too long, I've followed and researched this netting issue pretty thoroughly. Try reading the Sparrow decision sometime. The LOTW camp operators, NOTO (Northen Ontario Tourist Outfitters Association) and others are focused on and devoting a lot of resources to the netting problem. If I had only my experience at LOTW to go on, I wouldn't be concerned very much. We always catch fish, and guys I know on this board who fish the same area do well, also. However, I used to fish Lake Nipissing and I saw that lake get devastated by native netting. I also know that the LOTW camp operators, NOTO, etc, are very concerned about the netting issue and they don't see any satisfactory resolution occurring. As one knowledgable insider told me, it's a complex problem with economic hardship on the reserves at the bottom of the whole thing. So, I'm very concerned. We'll see what next year brings."
552886,Flip Silverlake,2005-10-29 13:30:00,645,Lake of the woods is being fished with out control. It's callwd netting. If it's not stopped the lake will become a vary large wet wasteland!
552764,Guest,2005-10-24 10:22:00,0,"I am curious to know if those who fished Lake of the Woods felt that walleye action was as good as ever or that it was not. I have heard some say that they are catching more in the 1-15"" range and having to fish deeper for them. That they had more trouble getting the bigger fish, over 18"" than in past years. I am wondering if the effects of netting are showing up. If you ask resort owners, some will say it was the best year ever. What's the truth?"
552770,Guest,2005-10-24 14:21:00,0,"For my money the fishing has gone downhill the last ten years on LOTW. Im going to move to another lake, dont know which one but Im moving. Walleye are getting smaller and farther apart. Dont know if it is the netting or something else. It is happening and while I dont mind slow days catching fish slow weeks have been piling up."
552774,MoWalleyeguy,2005-10-24 15:45:00,409,"I took 2 trips this year to LOTW... totaling 12 days on the water and both trips produced more Walleyes then we had caught ANY other year. Most Walleyes were in the 14""-21"" range. I think this year was very weather sensitive. We fish out of the north eastern corner (WitchBay). It didnt seem to matter where we went, we caught Walleyes every where. As far as big fish, it wasnt as good as some past years, but better then others. My brother caught his 3 personal best on our July trip. I personally don't think the netting has reduced the size of the fish, rather they just were not as easy to find this year. This is just my opinion. Also, we traveled many miles from camp and never saw any so called nets. I do know people that said they saw some, but I didnt see any personally. If I did, I think I would test out one of my Gerber Knives on it...(joking of course) I am very much looking forward to 2 more trips up in 2006. If I ever feel that commercial netting or over harvest of any kind is affecting our fishing then we will be checking out other lakes."
552777,Guest,2005-10-24 19:38:00,0,"This year was my best year for big fish and numbers of walleyes, the fishing was a little different,due to the weather we had this summer.As far as the netting goes (in my area Sioux Narrows), they mainly net the long bay area and thats it and I this season I have only seen nets for about 3 weeks and most are gone.I'm sure they are catching a few fish but the area they net is such a small area of what is out there.People also assume that more people are netting , when actually know they must mark the nets so they are visable as in the past who knew how many nets where out there."
552781,Guest,2005-10-24 23:33:00,0,"Have a camp (cabin)on LOW,near Kenora.Fish every month.Native netting is going on all the time ,but less in summer.I am near a reserve and nets are in front of my place in Jan. Feb.Mar.Apr. May June Sept.Oct.Nov. and Dec. Near a major boat route so no nets in summer,thats when they put nets out of main traffic areas. I fish Kenora area and up to 20 miles S.This year open water season caught walleye between 13 and 16"" every day. lots to eat ,any time of day.__But fewer bigger fish than previous years. Used to have a tough time to get fish under 18"" to keep .Had to release many large fish in order to keep eaters ; FAR fewer big fish this season. Used to get 20"" to 26"" fish EVERY DAY in previous years, BUT NOT THIS YEAR.I am sure that the average size will continue to drop in coming years. The slaughter of large fish by native nets is a tragedy. Next summer will likely catch many walleye 11 to 14""; how unexciting."

552792,Flip Silverlake,2005-10-25 17:28:00,645,"Spent the last two weeks of July in the Kenora area and found fish in the 15"" range running nearly 40 to 45 feet deep. We did have one day where we (me and the wife) boated nearly 60 fish in two hours, but they were all 15"" class. Somebody up there needs to get this mess under control before the fishery is destroyed. They have dropped the limits as far as sport fishing goes but we still had plenty to eat in camp. The problem I have with the limit changes is that the netting is taking way more fish then what sport fishing can. The resort owner, where we stayed, kept sort of a closed lip when it came to talking about the netting issue but did say there was a new conservation officer assigned to Kenora and he was looking into the problem. There were a bunch of guys in camp that fished pretty hard for a week but did not get much in the way of size. By the way all of the fish they caught were released. They ate a ton of beef. Someone here in the states must have gotten the message because Culvers is not selling the ""Walleye fish sandwich"" any more. Kenora lost a paper making machine this summer and if they lose the walleye fishery, the town might not do so well next year. The worst part is that the fish are moving to the winter pattern and the nets will just clean the lake out."
