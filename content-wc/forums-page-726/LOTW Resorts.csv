552649,Wonderer,2005-10-14 08:47:00,10,"I find it someone strange that people even bother to mention things such as guides be fired from this resort or that resort. I find it strange too, that any resort on this body of water, can lay claim to having the BEST guides on the lake. How on earth can a Walleye Guide lets say, be the best as a Bass Fishing guide. How can a walleye guide too be the BEST as a Muskie guide. Now, I will admit that Totem Resorts is probably one of the best resorts on LOTW. It is certainly the biggest, but as I have said, bigger is NOT necessarily better, as normally there is so much infighting going on to be the #1 guide in the place than anything else. Here is how I rate some of the facilities in the Wiley/Totem fishing area. Mainly the wiley/Crow Rock/Western Peninsula areas. There are four or five facilties that fish these waters to any great extent, and they are listed here. Not in order of how I see them, but as to services offered, and I have added my views. I have worked for every last one of them too at one time or another or certainly know how they operate. Wiley Point - Part of the Totem Resort Chain on LOTW. Yes, the biggest and probably most modern on the lake. No other that I know of offers air conditioning in their cabins. I am not even sure why..gads it not that hot here in the summer months. Their guides are no better than any other facility in this area. In fact, I even feel not as good as other places. They are walleye fisherman, not bass, muskie, pike all that much. IF you want bass fishing, you have to travel a good 30 miles to get it. They tend to go to Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows, or did in the past. If I have to travel that far, it's a waste of my day. Plus it can be one nasty ride back home, if the weather turns mean, and that can and does happen. I know. Been their done that. One problem some of their guides did have and probably still do is moving in on other boats fishing spots. Very annoying, but with this reputation of being the biggest, I guess that means you can do whatever. As far as I see things here, they cater to the more affluent or large corporations. If however you want the best then maybe this is the place you should look into. ______ Crow Rock Lodge Located on Crow Rock Island. You nearly go right by their docks while going from Kenora, to Wiley Point. They are a family owned and operated facility. The Dafciks and have been on LOTW for a good 40 years. Wendel Sr, Wendel Jr, Kurt, Chris, (the Dafcik Brothers) are all highly experienced at fishing this area, Shoal Lake Narrows, and they are all too highly experienced fly fisherman in their own right. They will offer you assistance in every way, if you are trying to learn this form of fishing. Over the past few years, this facility has had one wild face lift. It is totally modern, a few new cabins, excellent boats/motors, and a great appearance as soon as you arrive. Clean and everything in place. What sets them apart from the others around here is they have 8 portage/remote/walk-in lakes they use. Smallmouth bass, walleye, pike are available without a long boat ride to other areas. They fish the exact same waters as Wiley/Totem and good at that too. Wendel Jr, Kurt, are superb walleye, smallmouth bass anglers. While Chris is probably the best Muskie guide for this area by far. He sleeps dreaming of muskie. I assure you. The guides they have on staff have for the better part been with them for a good number of years, and very very experienced too in all species. Crow Rock offers too Fly-in fishing to Rowdy Lake. and Crow Rock itself, is American Plan only. ______ Ash Rapids Lodge; Located on the Western Peninsula right at the entrance to Shoal Lake/Shoal Lake Narrows. Here their bread and butter fish in smallmouth bass. Has been for years. Shoal Lake has been closed to walleye fishing for a good 20 years due to over commercial fishing. IF you are looking for a resort for superb smallies then this is the place. In fact, Wiley Point and at times Crow Rock will travel to this area just for the Bass, and Northern Pike. That is a 30min boat ride one way, and as I have mentioned, if the weather turns nasty (and it does here in the north) it can be one mean ride back to Wiley or Crow Rock at the end of the day. Plus why waste one hr a day traveling when you can stay IN the immediate smallmouth bass area. Ash Rapids is a family owned an operated lodge. Now by Andrew and Tannis Clinton. Their guides are all highly experienced in this areas fishing waters, which can be Shoal Lake, Shoal Lake Narrows, Ptarmigan Bay, Cork Screw Channel, White Partridge Bay, Kendall Inlets and other popular smallmouth waters. Walleye fishing, muskie fishing, and trophy pike too are in this area better than most others. It's all knowing where, and their guides certainly do know. It is an American Plan/Housekeeping Plan facility. Holds I believe up to 40 guests at any time. Great meals, service, boats/motors, and certainly staff. These people know what they are doing, as does Crow Rock. _____ North West Outfitters Located 1/2 down Shoal Lake Narrows is right in the heart of great smallmouth, muskie fishing. Don Sauve has owned the place for a long time, and he is a highly experienced guide for both anglers and has a great reputation for bear hunting, deer hunting, and wolf hunting adventures. Hold around 12 or a bit more. Reasonably modern but I understand he still have outhouses, but the great hunting, fishing might help that annoyance. American or Housekeeping plans. Good equipment and guide services. ___ Shoal Lake Lodge New this year. Should be nice since it is new. I have heard nothing about meals, or guides, or services, and have not as yet had the chance to even see the place. If you have, let me know. Well those as far as I am concered are the Best facilities on the Western side of Lake of the Woods. There are a few others probably, and certainly you will find in Kenora a few good private guides. Depends on what you really want. Personally I am not interested in totally modern anything. You are coming to Ontario's Wilderness, remember that. All the most modern conveniences in a cabin such as air conditioning will not make a great fishing adventure. Having an experienced guide is becoming hard to do. Not many really want to guide much anymore I believe. It is hard to support a family on seasonal employment. If a guide is single it might be ok. IF I were married, I would never have even considered guiding as a living myself. I will add here and now. I no longer work or are associated with any of these places. I only add my comments to just show some of you, that NO RESORT as far as I see things has anything such thing as a 100% experienced guide FOR Lake of the Woods. After 20+ years myself ON the lake, I have not see it all, and never will in this lifetime. Anyone that lays claims that they know it all is giving you a line of you know what. I've probably forgotten more than most of them anyway. Thanks Have fun fishing where ever you go. Oh-One last note. You will see on TV shows pertaining to some of the above. Remember....These resorts PAY big bucks for those promotions. You certain would not expect them to say fishing is the pits, the guides are no good etc. etc. They will show you the best the place offers, not whats hidden beneath the operations."
552659,dutchboy,2005-10-14 17:00:00,5717,"Well I got sucked in and read the whole post. Still don't know the point of it. If it was to inform me of the resort situation thank you. If it was to inform me about guides, you wasted your time. From what I can tell the only one's concerned about who's number one and who did what to whom is the guides. They seem to be making a big deal out of something, what I don't know or even care for that matter. Oh well, something to read anyway."
552663,PJM,2005-10-14 22:44:00,3516,"dutchboy I had to laugh because I had the same responce to the post that you did, and yes I got sucked in also"
552664,Guest,2005-10-14 23:21:00,0,"dear Wonderer, So does this mean that the Resort you own doesent have Guides?"
553003,Wonderer,2005-11-08 23:26:00,10,excellent resort and people.
553004,Wonderer,2005-11-08 23:28:00,10,gee I forgot about that one. Not a bad place.
553005,Wonderer,2005-11-08 23:32:00,10,"True true. Not only that, just because a guide leaves a resort for whatever reason does not mean that place will close down. Ive seen many a guide (good ones too) retire and the resort never missed a beat. He was replaced immediately with another guide."
553024,MrEyes,2005-11-09 23:59:00,360,Wonderer A friend is trying to get me to fish LOTW with him this up coming year. Do you know anything about Thunderhook fly in's? Mark
552723,Guest,2005-10-19 14:25:00,0,"Well Dalejr, I'm wondering how a tournament fisherman makes a good guide, were any of the guides that were fired tournament fishermen? I have had a bad experience on LOTW, where a guide I had decided that we should be doing his pre-fishing for him for smallmouth bass, apparently the KBI or somthing was coming up. I think I would have rather had a guide that cared about pleasing us, instead of winning the tournaments"
552816,guide22,2005-10-27 10:30:00,7,"Hey Guy's Did you ever consider some of these guides also just moved on to other jobs...They have families to support and a seasonal job wears on you after awhile.Yes guideing is a great job , but it is in the end just a seasonal thing for most of us...What I'm really trying to say is that just because a guide is gone from a lodge doesnt mean that the lodge has fired him or that there where problems between the 2 sides ...just a guide movin on to something different. PS- you will find good and bad guides no matter where you go! Guide22"

552666,Wonderer,2005-10-15 06:59:00,10,"1- ""I"" do not own a resort. What I was/am trying to point out, is just because ""Jack Flash - Super guide"" quits, leaves, gets fired or retires, is not going to put any resort out of business. I find it totally stupid that a guide would post anything here in Walleye Central ""I just left/quite, this or that resort. Who really cares? I was also trying to point out, that NO dam camp has the Best Guides in the World. There is no guide as far as I know, that knows every fishing hole on this lake. ####...65,000 miles of shoreline, 15,000 islands he would have to be older than anyone I know. There are guides who lay claim to knowing everything, and that is a crock of you know what. I know a few that say I can go here, go their. But in doing so pound rocks doing so. One comes to mind POOF..(nickname) and a Totem guide. He went thru a lower unit several times a year thru his own stupidity. He was stoned 1/2 the time I also find it dumb, that a guest would stop going to a certain resort just because a guide leaves. However...I do suggest to anyone going ""anywhere"" to fish several places over a period of years and look around this lake. It's beautiful. GO to Totem, then try another area to look at for a season then go to another. Find one you like/love then fine, settle in for life, but to judge a resort from one visit, one guiding experience is stupid. There has to be a reason any guide leaves, quits, or gets canned. No matter how long he/she has been their. I judge resorts (as a potential working place) by staff turn over, and believe me, Totem has one massive staff turnover. That alone gives ME a hint, something is wrong."
552667,Guest,2005-10-15 09:40:00,0,"Wonderer, Do you have any information regarding Witchbay Camp. This maybe a little East of you but I have gone there and was hoping you could give me any info on the place and your thoughts regarding their fishing pros as opposed to the usual camp guides. Thanks Wingman"
552675,Guest,2005-10-16 20:26:00,0,"maybe because the guide that left had a superiority complex ,, and w the senior guides as well as the management felt he was not up to par anyways,, we do get alot of that ,, but the senior guides are much better and you hear no complaints about them ,, most of them fish for more than one species of fish ,, and a bunch of us also fish tournaments,, just go look at the leaderboards in local tournaments,, ,,, and there we are ,,, dale jr."
552678,MoWalleyeguy,2005-10-17 09:02:00,409,"Wingman, As far as Witch Bay goes I have been there 5 times and plan to keep going back. The original poster incorrectly stated that Wiley Point was the only one with A/C and in fact Witch Bay has A/C at there camp and it IS a very nice thing to have on those 85+ degree days and even nights. Sure, some years in the summer its nice and cool, but I think it was an awesome addition after staying in some cabins and not being able to cool down after a long day of fishing. As far as the guides at Witch Bay... they don't call them that there. They call them Pros. The reason is that they are not there to just ""guide"" you but rather teach you on new technics that you may not be accustomed to using. I always considered myself an avid fisherman but every trip I learn new things while there. You can choose to go out on your own, or go out with one of the pros or follow them out in your own boat. They will mark your maps of all the known hazards and believe me that will help you keep off the numerous rocks. They will help you go out and put fish in the boat. By the way, Witch Bay has awesome boats. You can choose from a Lund 17' Outfitter Tiller or a Console (steering wheel) Model Crestliner and either is equiped with a 50HP 4-stroke Yamaha motor. If you decide to bring your own boat they can have your dock space ready when you get there. They have hookups for your chargers, etc. The food at the camp is wonderful and the people there are some of the best. The owners make you feel right at home. Another nice thing about Witch Bay is the secluded location of the camp. There is probably no camp/resort as remote as this place. Okay now I would like to say which ever camp/resort a person goes to, I highly suggest you talk to people on here that have been to that place before. There are good places and bad. LOTW is a fantastic fishery but your experience can be ruined by going to a poorly run camp. I know people that have gone to Totem, Wiley Point and Crow Rock and they have had very good experiences so you should look into thoses as well as my pick Witch Bay."
552694,oldlogin,2005-10-18 07:43:00,22,"You seem to be the authority on camps in the western region of LOTW. Wondering why you left out Big Narrows Lodge, which is a 5 min boat ride from Wiley."
552704,Guest,2005-10-18 11:48:00,0,"Gee Corky, you are my hero. Glad to see that you are doing well on the sauger circuit. Still getting those 4 pound saugers ?"
