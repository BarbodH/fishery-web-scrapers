553048,Guest,2005-11-11 11:27:00,0,"Jim...did you catch it there in that trough... or did you end up there due to current and breeze, by the time you got a picture? :) I know that cane patch real well. I have several pics I have taken over the years with that cane patch in the background ;) The fish is a BEAUT!!!"

552964,Dave Q,2005-11-07 06:52:00,1003,"Should I go back to the ""NIP."" (only 3 hr's away)?? two weeks ago the fishing was good one day, fair the second day. Water was 45.f... hogs were caught 9, 10 11. At what TEMP.. will the CRANKBAIT bite slow/end. I have never fished past 3rd week of oct.up there?? Any help/thoughts. Thanks to all :)"
552965,River_eye,2005-11-07 07:52:00,1486,"I've had them hit good on big cranks right up till the water is freezing on the side of the boat, somtimes you just have to slow your lures down to a crawl to trigger them by pumping your rod."
552967,Guest,2005-11-07 08:24:00,0,When the water gets real cold I put a slip egg sinker on about three foot in front of the crankbait like a Carolina rig and fish it slow with lots of twitching and jerking. I anchor the boat and cast and it works good even when there is ice on the water. Seems that smaller cranks work the best.
552993,Guest,2005-11-08 12:14:00,0,"Dave... in that river, they seem to hit cranks as late as you can troll them. Slower seems better when the water gets down in that 40 degree range. I have done well with 37-38 water temps, cranking there."
552994,Dave Q,2005-11-08 13:01:00,1003,"T mac. THANKS!! not sure if I will make it up or not.Most think im ""nuts"" for thinking about it. But hey its a longggggg winter. :) If I do go I will post how it went. If not I will (wind permitting) fish Diefenbacker for white fish. (Average about 4 to 7 lbs. boy can they pull. We use then fishing in the spring in Manitoba for lakers. Thanks again Dave."
552995,Dave Q,2005-11-08 13:08:00,1003,"Thanks Tmac. ""IF"" I go I will post how it went. same depth ect. ect.???? Dave. SORRY FOR THE REPOST MY MISTAKE. :)"
