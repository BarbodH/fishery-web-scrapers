Had to canoe down a river to get to the lake from the end of a logging road. Seems like we went an hour or two north of Red Lake. Man we had amazing fishing. I was just wondering what the lake is like now after 28 years. I hear there is a campground on it. ANyone know anything about the lake?

We were camped on an island and we woke up in the middle of the night to find natives trying to steal the gas out of our boats. Those were the only other humans we saw in ten days there."

Pull the keys on your boat as well even though you may never see people they will come through late at night. Stormed the day we came 2"" snow and two days later it was 70 degrees."
