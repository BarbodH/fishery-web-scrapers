One of my favourite areas is up around Ramsey and Bisco, I've been through the area a couple of times fishing smaller lakes, but my next trip will be to one of the larger lakes in the area, Ramsey, Opeepeesway being the leading candidates at this point, because I will be able to take my bigger boat. So, I was wondering if anyone could provide with some information about how good the fishing was, quality and quantity of campsites and things to look out for in general. Any info would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advance"

Now that you're a WC member, you're eligible for the Walleye Central ""annual members only"" drawing for a 620 Ranger of your choice (check with Juls or Scott - ha).

I used to really enjoy it when i was younger, but after i had my daughter i didnt ever get a chance to get out much anymore afterwards. Well she is now 4, and I headed to bisco just on a little getaway with the boys to catch some fish and wind out in early june of this year, and i fell back in love with the sport all over again. I fished bisco twice last year, and i found it pretty decent. not huge, but quantity was good. Met a few guys up there who fished ramsey and they say its about the same, although ive read different on the board. Good luck!!!"
1245038,GOBIG,2010-10-27 04:37:00,126,"I checked, a guy by the name of tightliner has a few posting on ramsey lake. I would send him a pm and talk to him directly..i have fished rays camps 6 times in the last 10 years. I keep going back every few years, always a lot of fun.."
1245215,Keon_14,2010-10-27 18:48:00,2,"Thanks to everyone who replied, it has given me a start. One of the discouraging things was reading that the road into Opeepeesway may leave a lot to be desired, but the last time I was up that way I was intrigued by the road to Chester Lake and New Arbutus Rd, so maybe there's something interesting up that way."
