1247337,Rgate,2010-11-06 21:00:00,14,"31 incher - 2nd week of July - Lake of the Woods near Gooseneck and in the same week a 29, 28, 2x27, 26, 25."
1247340,Baseline,2010-11-06 21:32:00,3207,This year the best I did was a 26 1/2 on the English River during a September trip. What was notable about that fish was that it was accompanied by 10 more measuring between 24 and 26. My fishing partner had an equally successfully day landing at least another 10 or 12 in the same class. We caught a bunch of hogs mixed in with the usual sized fish holed up in a bay that were eager to hit crank baits namely rat-raps. The northerns were also active in that bay. I've been walleye fishing for 30 years and that is the single best 8 hours of fishing I've ever had. Another notable detail about that trip was that a black bear ripped a couple holes in my tent while I was inside sleeping like a baby.

Caught two the exact same length within 10 minutes. We were fishing out of Lost Island Lodge. Mike Kansas"

1246685,bigwalleye1,2010-11-03 17:57:00,2632,"In one trip on Lac Seul, caught and released a 29 1/2 walleye with a tag, MNR says it's 28 years old, tagged in 2000 at 18 yrs old. I also caught one more at 28, and had a 28 in the boat for my brother-in-law and fishing partner. 3 Ontario master angler fish in 2 days of east wind, and less than 10 ft of water on a spot I'd never been before. You gotta know I dream about that spot.... Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't been there, and wouldn't have missed it for anything. Great memories, and every fish is still right where we left 'em. Be back there next spring, and it's gonna be a fast trip from the landing!"
1246708,W.W.,2010-11-03 19:46:00,245,For 2010 it was 28 1/2 inch on a crawler and bouncer in early July; Morson area of LOTW.W.W. in Iowa
1246722,Riceburner,2010-11-03 20:50:00,436,"Wow--28 years old...!!! In 2006 we caught two large walleyes at Tobin Lake (Sask River) that were right at 12 pounds each. They were 31.25 and 31.75 inches long. We saved scales from each fish, and had the local MN DNR check the ages---they were 13 years old. They commented that the growth rings showed the size balooned in the later years when the fish could catch and eat larger forage minnows/fish. I realize Tobin is a unique situation---your findings are closer to what I expected."

I used a BB & 2 hook hammered Gold or Silver wormharness. There were multiplecatches of 28 to 29&1/2"" Wallys. Haven't been able to break intothat 30""+ family for 4 seasons now!! They're there, just haven't been able to coax one to take the crawler!"
1246765,@Lunker,2010-11-04 07:39:00,835,"Biggest one that gave me the most pleasure was the 26-incher my 35 year old son caught this past Sept on LOTW - his biggest ever. He's essentially only been fishing for the past 4 years and only the one annual trip with me. He was absolutely tickled and I was even more so for him.And in case you're wondering why my son has only been fishing for 4 years, it's because a) he's my step-son and he spent most of his formative years living with his father, b) then he went off to college, c) he got a job in law enforcement and, as a new employee, had to prioritize his vacation time, d) he opted to get into other recreational activities, and e) when he finally started going with me, he lamented that he was ""so sorry"" he'd turned down my previous invitations. We're making up for lost time now."
