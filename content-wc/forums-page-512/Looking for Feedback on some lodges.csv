1245726,Crede,2010-10-29 20:24:00,134,We have been to Kag with Leuenbergers twice. Both trips were great.
1245845,Mr Walleye,2010-10-30 18:52:00,29,Went to Brace in June 2010. Awesome camp with great walleye/pike fishing!!!!
1245875,fishforlife,2010-10-31 01:16:00,77,"Hey Adempsey, it cetainly is worth you while to review Brace Lake again, Check out my latest thread on this years trip. They are soon to have a revamped web site up soon with even more updated information to help make an educated decision. I'm biased because I've found what I'm looking for and that's basically quality fishing in a beautiful relaxing atmosphere, Kyle & Teri are good honest people building a business and doing it with integrity. Never hurts to call and see for yourself, or see them at the Novi Sportshow in Jan 13th and talk to them there. You won't be sorry.Regards,Rob"
1246837,DROP SHOT,2010-11-04 12:29:00,10,"Hey Adempsey, do not know if you have decide on what lodge to go to or not but I like go to this place. I see lots of the guys are helping you out there but if you what first class all the way and the nicest cabins. visit this website very easy to use and it should help you out. www.nestorfalls.com good luck."
1242498,tmccann,2010-10-14 19:36:00,4,hey just wondering if u ended up staying at ritches this year dempsey?
1242542,TIGHTLINER,2010-10-15 04:55:00,223,If you are looking around the biscotasing area forget ritchies. I have been told by the locals and other fisherman that bisco lake is fished out and there is much better fishing on ramsey. New owners now for two years great people young and very eager to help. Been going here since 1988 been very happy with the fishing great cabins and the food plan is the best. Let me know if you head there i have maps of the lake that i can share. Don't know anything about the other places you are looking.
1242544,GOBIG,2010-10-15 05:16:00,126,"I said a long time ago to check out ak on nungusser. No, stay away. Having fishing ramsey a few years back, very good lake, caught 21-22 in walleye all day, and plenty of pike action. Owners are great."
1242605,retire55,2010-10-15 10:06:00,1029,Have you given any consideration to fishing north western Quebec for walleye? Less restrictions and a lot less driving! Just wondering.
1242730,tmccann,2010-10-15 21:17:00,4,i was just wondering cuz i worked at ritches this year n yes i no the owners of ramsey good ppl but the fishing was not so well there this year both lakes we down 5 feet when i arrvied late april
1242731,tmccann,2010-10-15 21:18:00,4,and trust me u just got to no were to fish on biscotasi never have i come back with a boat empty handed
1244343,adempsey,2010-10-24 01:35:00,963,"Nope, we decided to go to Kaby Kabins. We also ended up going to Red Pine Lodge on Ivanhoe Lake for a week in August. I really liked Richies and Rays concept though where you have a pseudo-American plan (they provide all the food, you have to cook it though). I also heard that Ramsey is likely to have better fishing. I have no idea though. Bisco is supposed to be really nice though. It's such a large body of water, I would be surprised if it's been ""fished out"". I think Polaris-Pete summed it up pretty well the things I read about the camp on the net.I have considered Quebec and will probably hit a lodge there at some point. I hear many good things about the lakes there. It would most likely be closer, but many places are also way down logging roads - which isn't necessarily bad, just saying. GoBig, you are suggesting Anglers Kingdom? Nungesser looks like an amazing fishery. I have yet to travel that far west, but hopefully soon.I think for 2011 I will look at the camps on Ara, Meta, Brace again. Perhaps Leuenberger's on Kag lake. I might even go back to Lady Evelyn Lake......probably should start thinking about this a bit more. I working on my ice fishing trip atm =)Cheers."
1244482,tmccann,2010-10-24 19:27:00,4,ya qubec got some nice size wallye
1244615,GOBIG,2010-10-25 10:38:00,126,"No, i do not recommend nungesser or anglers. Very rocky lake, a lot of small walleye, smallest i can remember in 10 years, many boats, and depending on where you are coming from can be very expensive. You will be fine, i would go back to ramsey, i caught walleye every day 18-24 inches, and plenty of pike. Nice people run the place also. Read some of the older post on anglers kingdom and the other camps on the lake..Kag lake is awesome to fish. Looking to go back myself. Hebner, Melchett lakes with awonakina.com, are pretty good."
1245492,northofdaborder,2010-10-28 21:59:00,3,"Hey adempsey.i fished bisco twice last year. One we stayed on a houseboat, through biscotasing sportsman lodge i believe was the name, and the other was camping. the house boat was alrite as far as comfort goes. it got a little crowded come day 2. defintley learned to appreciate shore lunches! camping was.........blah. would never do it again. i cant help you out on ritchies, but our group is staying with grey owl this year. everyone really likes the idea of the outpost cabins, and the fact that the cabins are spread out across the lake. i spoke to buzz and lisa today, the camp owners, and they were awesome to deal with! really nice and helpful people. hope that helps you in any way!!! happy fishing!"
1171883,adempsey,2010-02-24 22:40:00,963,"I would greatly appreciate any feedback on the following lodges. It seems like the more I try to narrow down a place to visit this year, the more places I find. Any information is appreciated, especially negative information. Would love to know about the boats, cabins, hosts and fishing (big surprise!). Feel free to PM me if you would prefer.The trip will be in early July and primarily fishing for walleye.Thanks in advance.Agich's Kaby Kabins - White River - Lake Kabinakagamihttp://www.kabykabins.ca/Eversons Lodge - Hawk Junction - Lake Kabinakagamihttp://www.eversonslodge.com/Kay Vee Lodge - Homepayne - Lake Nagagamihttp://www.kayveelodge.com/2010%20rates.htmMeta Lake Lodge - Nakina - Meta Lakehttp://www.metalakelodgefishing.com/Welcome.htmlBrace Lake Outfitters - Nakina - Brace Lakehttp://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com/Ara Lake Camp - Jellicoe - Ara Lakehttp://www.aralakecamp.com/Ritchies End of Trail Lodge - Biscotasing - Lake Biscotasihttp://www.ritchiesendoftrail.com/index.htmlRed Pine Lodge - Folyet - Ivanhoe Lakehttp://www.red-pine-lodge.com/ontario-fishing-trips.htm(ugh, hadn't realized my list was that long....)"
1171889,fishforlife,2010-02-25 01:19:00,77,"I have fished all three lakes Brace - Meta - Ara, and have stayed at Meta, & Brace Lake. Having said this, i can tell you unequivically Hands down best price (half) you have the same accommodations cabins boats and motors better at Brace ,15 hp mercs vs 9.9 jhons. Fishing is goog on all thre lakes, but best at the end of Brace Lake. Having said all of this, I have been to both and find that the new owners of Brace are much more acommodating than Meta. The new owners of Brace Lake will give you a shore lunch and a mid week diiner thats to die for. Kyle and Teri Poleski are the new owners that are not only accomodating but knoledgeable about both hunting and fishinig,and know how to make your vacation enjoyable in all aspects. Please check out BraceLake outfitters.com I have no other affilliation with them other than a satisfied customer . If you would like, I could send you some pictures, let me know at [email protected] or call ma at 419 304-8261I want you to know that I have no connection to this buisness other than a guest. Looking to help make the best informed decision based on experiences of other guestsRegards,Rob Weimer"
1171898,IRISHATTACK,2010-02-25 03:26:00,44,LOOK AT WWW.ANGLERSKINGDOM.COM. HIS WEBSITE KINDA SAYS IT ALL.
1171982,adempsey,2010-02-25 09:32:00,963,"Thanks Rob. I did read some of your other posts about Brace and was thinking about PMing you. Actually, I think your posts were how I found out about this lodge. Irish, I have definitely heard of Angler's Kingdom! Looks to be a great destination. Unfortunately, at 20+ hours, it's a bit further than I am willing to drive this year. I actually live in Toronto, Ontario and wanted to stay within a 12 hour drive. Cheers!"
1171991,Kruger,2010-02-25 09:47:00,259,"I haven't stayed at the 2 lodges you asked about on kabinakagami. But we go to the lake in July every year. It seems to be getting better every year. The last 2 years we have had a few days with over 100 fish each and probably averaged 45 -50 each per day. The average size is probably between 17""-20"". It's a large lake with a lot of Islands and Bays. We seem to find at least a few fish everywhere we stop."
1172022,ohiojmj,2010-02-25 11:12:00,1262,"I didn't stay at Richie's but spent early July week at Biscotasing in 2008. Water level was very high with lilly pads several feet under. Weather was mostly fair with a few passing rains and some chop here and there. The bite was extremely tough for full week as we caught less fish than any previous week trip to Canada. The lake is enormous with endless desolate bays, islands, and miles of water to fish or explore. We were after pike and got nothing of size using cranks, stickbait, spoons, spinnerbait. Perhaps we should have tried live bait. I suspect we didn;t offer the desired bait that week. A dude at camp near town pulled a 36"" pike with a worm/hook/bobber! I now bring worms and harnesses. The lengthy graded road is the main reason that I would not go back. The 40 or 50 mile journy proved too much for the springs on my trailer as one broke 1/2 way home to Ohio, and the other had a large crack also. I fear taking my family van or my new boat/trailer on another graded road for the washboard beatings.As a remote location, you leave the vicinity of the town and may not see another boat or person all day, but you may hear or see the train passing through. Dammed lakes are subject to level variations which can influence the bite, so I prefer natural lakes. The little store had most necessities, although gas was close to $7/gallon at the time, take it or leave it aye.I don't recall seeing or looking at Richie's lodge so you are on your own there. Good luck."
1172028,adempsey,2010-02-25 11:34:00,963,"Thanks for the great info Kruger and Ohiojmj.I have to admit, Richies was probably not my first choice, but the place and the concept of the food plan was interesting to me so I left it open to consideration. I also couldn't find much information from past visitors, so that is why I included in my list. I think they must have another lodge on Ramsey Lake (Ray's Camp), which is next to Biscotasi, because they also have a similar food plan.Cheers."
1172852,buzzyb,2010-02-28 08:09:00,14,Check out www.greyowlcamps.com All outpost cabins on Biscotasi Lake
1192932,halfmoon007,2010-04-24 21:56:00,121,"Go to the next lake on the chain . Ramsey lake, Rayscamps.com .Been there the last 20 years in august and its a great camp with excellent fishing Walleye and Pike.....Moon"
1193657,polaris-pete,2010-04-26 18:40:00,343,"I have stayed at Ritchies back a few years ago and the place was nicely kept. The owners have since split I have been told and no they did not have the camp on Ramsey.It was his father who had that one called Rays where we spent many good years fishing. But times change as did Rays!! Glad Pete sold it and hope the new owners do well.As for Ritchies, I see on their website a new fella bought it and is making improvements. It is a nice camp and the cabins were all in great shape and the food plan was good also.The fishing has dropped off considerably since we used to go. It gets quite a bit of pressure even though its a large lake.The road in and out at times can be very bad!.1 year we got halfway to the main road and found it flooded out and had to turn around and go back and spend a few more days at the lodge until the road was fixed.Beautiful country but there are better bodies of water to fish that are more productive, even though you will be driving further. Good luck wherever you go."
