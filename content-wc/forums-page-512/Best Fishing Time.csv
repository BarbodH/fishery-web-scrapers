1245202,Downrigger,2010-10-27 17:43:00,60,"Spent two weeks on Lac Suel, Ear Falls area, 1st two weeks of Sept. Fishing was great, both for northen and eyes. However, wind kept us off water 4 days - wicked. Want to go back next year, and wondering when would be best time of year for both fishing and weather? Appreciate any advice."
1245210,Campcountry,2010-10-27 18:30:00,164,From decades of fishing in northwestern Ontario and eastern Manitoba - many of them in a canoe or 13 foot boat - I can tell you that I paid attention to the wind. In the vast majority of years July is the calmest month and and by mid August there are many windy days. I try and get in the most fishing possible in July - the catching is very good as well.
1245244,wallydave,2010-10-27 20:41:00,2151,"I have fished the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul mainly in the spring, late May to mid June, the wind seems to pick up in the afternoon, after a perfectly calm trip out in the morning, can lead to a boat pounding trip back to camp! Andrea at Goose Bay has upgrade boats available, a must for the big wind and wave days! When you have the 17ft Lunds the afternoon waves can be handled. The wind drives the bait fish against islands and shore lines, that make for pretty good to excellent fishing! So keep a eye on the wind, and remember that staying at camp, can mean you can go out the next day!"
1245257,Obabikon,2010-10-27 21:44:00,2370,"I heard one of the best fishermen I've ever known say that ""in any given month, there's going to be one week of great fishing, two weeks of good fishing, and for the average guy an aweful week"" His quote was actually talking about how to determine ""quality"" in fishermen. Everyone catches fish when they're going... how you're doing when the fishing's tough is what seperates the men from the boys. But... it works here too. At least on Lake of the Woods. Sure, the Walleye spawn is awesome, but you can't even fish Muskies, and you're usually too early for the crappies. Every fish has different peaks, but all fish can be biting on any given day. That's why we love it... the unpredictability. Take weather into account, and ever person will have a different opinion."
1245269,fishforlife,2010-10-28 01:45:00,77,"I guess any of you (weatherman ) can predict with any degree of certainty, what will happen on a regular basis at any given time over the same period of time, then you will definately have proven to us ""You Are The Man"". As we all know, only God knows the pattern we are guessing at on any given day on the water. Temp-Barom-Press-Fishing Press.-Water Clarity. Too Many variables for one man to be exact. All you need to do is have the right attitude and company in the boat to make it a good day fishing. Everybdy thinks they know how!!!! No body knows when!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Have A Good day ! Tight Lines!Rob"
1245293,tv4fish,2010-10-28 07:01:00,2694,"That's why we love it... the unpredictabilityI gotta agree with that statement I think if we KNEW that every time we went fishing we would have great luck and catch as many fish as we wanted - fishing would loose its ""lustre"". It's the challenge that most of us enjoy."
1245319,Golden Eagle,2010-10-28 08:35:00,2642,I'll take wind over flat water. I can always hide behind an island and fish a corner. I've told people in camp that I'll spend the night on an island if waves are too big at coming back time.
