My wife and i both have 12.5 lb walleye and it dosen't really raise an eyebrow.As the temperature drops and November comes the big fish will move in....Larry"
1244629,Guest,2010-10-25 11:30:00,0,Nipawin is truly a big eye fishery We caught 5 over 12 lbs this year and several over 15 were taken. Biggest was 17lb 1 oz we never caught it but say the Pictures. Wow were going back next year for sure.
1242736,pedwards96,2010-10-15 23:44:00,42,Check out this photo I received from a gentleman in Canada doing some fall fishing. He caught it on a #4 PK Ridgeline crankbait. You can see the bait in its mouth. Just thought I would share it with the walleyecentral community. What a nice fish!
1242766,Fishoil,2010-10-16 08:07:00,1277,It looks like a real hog. Any idea what it weighed? Congratulations to the lucky angler!!
1242836,pedwards96,2010-10-16 16:49:00,42,He said it weighed in at 13 lbs. It is a very nice fish for sure. That crankbait seems to be bringing in some big fish lately.
1242838,pedwards96,2010-10-16 16:51:00,42,"This is exactly his recount of the fishing trip: ""This Monster Walleye was caught on the Nipawin River in Saskatchewan. It weighted around 13 lbs and had a 20 in girth a true Giant. It hit one of the New PK Lures developed By Pat OGrady. We trolled with 1 oz snap weights and fire line about 175 feet out. Great Job PK Lures I am sure these New Cranks will soon be in everyones Tackle Box. I was very impressed. Tracked at high speed and Looked awesome in the water."""

1243145,pedwards96,2010-10-18 08:57:00,42,"Yes, that is him. He has been catching some monster fish on our PK tackle this fall. This is the biggest one that he has sent us a picture of but there have been a number of other very nice 8-10 lb. fish he has caught on our spoons and cranks."
1243252,Guest,2010-10-18 14:42:00,0,I know Tim And he does have a knack for catching Big fish
1243273,pedwards96,2010-10-18 15:49:00,42,I just couldn't believe the girth on that thing. It must be eating really well! The good thing is that the fish is still alive because he released it back to grow even bigger. I've caught fish in the states that were similar in length but never anything that deep. What a fish.
1243308,Guest,2010-10-18 17:48:00,0,Your gonna have to make your way up here someday Nipawin can produce some real footballs along with some other waters we have Biggest I seen was Years ago it went just over the 26inch mark and touched 10 pounds The thing looked like a carp
1243369,pedwards96,2010-10-18 20:53:00,42,I have always dreamed of fishing up there. I really hope that someday I will be able to go up there and catch some of those monsters.
