For my dad 70's birthday, I booked a trip with Gary from G2 Angling in hopes of getting my dad a 10lb+ walleye. He has been fishing his entire life but has never been able to break the 10lb mark. Gary was an outstanding guide and really went out of his way to make the dream happpen. Not only did my dad break the 10lb mark one time, he did it 3 times with a 10, 10.5 and a 11.2lb fish. Not only did my dad catch his fish of a lifetime, so did I with a 14.3lb walleye!! It was an outstanding trip that I will remember for the rest of my life, thanks to Gary at G2 Angling!!"
