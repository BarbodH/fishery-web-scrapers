1239631,Campcountry,2010-09-30 19:52:00,164,"In the Fall the best chance for a 30 is probably the greenback runs on the Red River, or Winnipeg River at Pine Falls or in Traverse Bay on Lake Winnipeg - all in Manitoba.I was just checking the Angler Awards page of the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and the most 30 inchers listed (for 2010) came from Lake of the Woods around Kenora and Sioux Narrows, Bay of Quinte, and Wawang Lake - in that order."
1240839,kgeary,2010-10-06 21:38:00,88,"Well since a few said Nungesser is not the place then I'll just ad. My son Hayden caught his first 30 inch walleye on Nungesser when he was 4 yrs old. My wife Debra and daughter Seanna have both caught 30 inch walleye. Dennis caught a 32 last yr and 30 this yr. The biggest I've seen caught was a 34 my personal best was a 34. Many people mention that the walleye are healthier (thicker) on Nungesser than most other lakes. I've got a spot about 300 yards from my desk that can ""almost"" guarantee at least a 29 tommorrow. But I would never guarantee anything regarding fishing."
1240854,GOBIG,2010-10-07 04:04:00,126,"Without question, nungesser has 30 in. You ""may"" catch a 30 in walleye, but you will for sure catch the smallest walleye of your fishing adventures......."
1240871,Bigfishhunter,2010-10-07 06:17:00,803,"In Manitoba, Lake Winnipeg, Tramping Lake, and Lake Athapapaskow. The last one is not a hard core walleye lake, but those who fish it for eyes, catch more over 28 than they do under 25""."

1242654,steve03,2010-10-15 13:46:00,22,I would have to agree with Kevin we have been going to Nungesser for close to 10 years now and the biggest fish up the trip has always been from anywhere from a 27-30 inch walleye. If you aren't catching 22-24's in this lake then you are doing something wrong. There is an abundance of 20-25 inch fish.

1235761,troutwater,2010-09-15 08:02:00,299,"I figured Lake Erie would get a few responses. I fished it once before on a charter, but it just wasn't the same. I live in central IL so I don't really have a good shot at catching a 30 unless I pick up and drive for several hours."
1235778,Fishoil,2010-09-15 09:32:00,1277,"I'd suggest the Bay of Green Bay from now through fall or Little Bay de Noc from late October through ice-up if you're still looking to crack the 30"" mark this year. Once it starts the fishing on Little Bay just keeps getting better until you can't break the ice at the launch anymore. Most weekends last year saw at least one fish of 10 lbs or better in my boat. Hopefully this year will be as good or better than last."
1235780,Mike Kansas,2010-09-15 10:03:00,1463,"This the place. We have been there several times in the late fall and have never failed to catch at least one 30""+ Walleye. BNiggest ever was 35"" and have had days that we caught up to 5 30"" fish. Selkirk has several, places to stay and there are Outfitters with Guide Services avaliable. Just Google Red River Walleye. Mike Kansas"
1236155,walleye88ia,2010-09-16 22:51:00,35,nungesser is not the lake. that lake is good for a few 23 inch in a week if your lucky.
1236165,GOBIG,2010-09-17 03:43:00,126,"Nungesser is not the lake, i caught more 10-11in walleye in one week than i have in 10 years of fishing canada. Very rocky lake and a lot of boats.."
1236191,nitrodude,2010-09-17 07:36:00,60,"Just wanted to give a vote for the English River. We've had very good luck over the past many years fishing a few select spots in late June. It's not an every year guarantee, but this year and last (plus other years past), we've hit or broken the 30"" mark. All released to catch again. You'll find many 23"" plus to keep you busy with a good fight and plenty of 17""-18"" fish to keep the belt tight on your britches."
1236492,Hawgeye,2010-09-18 22:53:00,1355,"I have to say that the Red River near Selkirk in the Lake Winnipeg lower basin in the fall is a trophy house. I go every year and have caught many masters over 30"" Been a couple years since I personally have landed one but I know I have lost one or two during that time. Back for more Greenbacks in two weeks...can't wait!!"
1236608,Curryale,2010-09-19 16:51:00,50,Bay of Quintie in November. If you are there for three days in the fall you can pretty much guarantee a 30.Most days that time of year are multiple fish over 10lbs.
1237931,robby1952,2010-09-24 07:58:00,5,"Went to andy myers lodge this year on eagle lake. Didn't fish hard. Caught a couples 30's and several 26"" to 29"" in 6 days."
1238031,LeeMB,2010-09-24 14:17:00,83,"Your best chance for a 30""+ walleye is in Lake Winnipeg or the Red River in the WINTER"
1235609,troutwater,2010-09-14 11:58:00,299,"Just curious to hear some opinions about what lake you would fish to chase a 30 incher. Would Lac Seul still be the popular lake, or would it maybe be Eagle or a fly in? The biggest I have caught is a 27, but I would obviously love to get a 30 some day."
1235615,wallydave,2010-09-14 12:23:00,2151,"I have had multiple 30 in walleyes caught fishing the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul. I usually plan my trips for late May, early June, and fish out of Goose Bay Camp. We will fish the rapids, the mouth of the river, Saw Mill, jigs and minnows. Members of my party of trolled with silver spoons at dusk and caught a few of the big girls that way. Good luck on your hunt for a couple of those big girls!"
1235626,Aaron-IN,2010-09-14 13:41:00,500,I caught a 30 incher on the Winnipeg River system this year (Minaki) and wasn't even fishing for them. I also know of 2 more 30+ caught at Minaki this year.
1235629,octanehi5,2010-09-14 13:57:00,1104,"The best place on gods green earth to catch a 30+""walleye and not just one, I do not know were you are from ,Its the bay of quinte off of lake ontario hands down"
1235632,badgerfowl,2010-09-14 14:06:00,40,"i got mine at lac des mille lacs in 2002. After years of catching nothing but small fish, I never thought I'd pull a 30 out of there but I did."
1235638,Obabikon,2010-09-14 14:39:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods produces 30's on a regular basis also. However, I'm not sure you can beat Lake Erie for landing something with a 3 in front of it."
1235674,Topwater,2010-09-14 17:35:00,484,"Thats an easy one. Tobin Lake, Saskatchewan. Steve"
1235681,Bill Krejca,2010-09-14 18:01:00,6107,"I went to Tramping Lake, near Snow Lake, Manitoba. Bill"
1235686,PIKEMAN330,2010-09-14 18:28:00,101,The only 30 I have ever caught was in Lake Erie.We were fishing with Rocky Callihans Tra-lin Charters out of Huron Ohio.I did come close a couple times on the Onaman River off of Lake Nipigon.
1235703,Guest,2010-09-14 19:42:00,0,"In a short stay its tough, but I would say your best chance is the Red River (Selkirk, Manitoba) or Winnipeg River (Pine Falls, Manitoba). Both are off lake Winnipeg, and in October the Big Eye's move into the river's. Some years the 30+ inchers are non-stop. Good Luck!!!"
