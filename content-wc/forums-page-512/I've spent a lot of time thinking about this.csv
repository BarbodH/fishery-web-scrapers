Only giving some thoughts towards his original post that the average Walleye in Lac Suel where on the small size compared to other Canadian lakes. Did not mean any disrepect towards anyone's fishing skills."
1245847,Mr Walleye,2010-10-30 18:55:00,29,We've always done better for average size at fly ins. You get what you pay for!
1246126,octanehi5,2010-11-01 08:12:00,1104,"I agree with mr walleye,fly ins are always better in my experiance,The lake we fly into every yr, has its own slot limit on it, you may take 14""-20"" walleyes. everything bigger or smaller must go back in the lake. this in the past few years has increased the average size of the walleyes ,we catch in this lake. we always catch plenty of eating size in the 19-20"" range,with alot of fish 22""-28"" very nice to C&R. We do so well there that we have imposed our own rule we don't take it unless its 19""-20"". Other lakes in canada should start to do the same,some of them are to heavily fished and harvested. As much as fishermen do not want slots it is nessasary."
1246160,Manitou,2010-11-01 09:57:00,125,"As a former commercial fisherman I will tell you that I have seen walleye so stuffed with ONE large tullibee that the tail was sticking out of it's mouth.So yes, big baits are the way to go. I will pull a medium sized crankbaits behind 3-way rigs and bottom bouncers to troll from 20'-60' of water."

1247279,Baseline,2010-11-06 14:45:00,3207,"Haven't been to LS for about 10 years as our group has found other waters to explore, but the big fish are there and are hanging around in the same area that the smaller fish are. As has been said many times in this thread crank baits will turn bigger fish. One thing I do and I assume many of the other fisherman do is jig along a reef, point or drop off, catch a fish and throw a buoy or do a GPS mark on that exact spot. Then continue to knock holes in the water until they zero in on the school of fish and fish there until the bite slows. These spots get logged and the the group returns to the same spot several times during the rest of the trip. These spots become regular stops on subsequent trips. Net result is that everyone catches lots of fish, but the size of fish is usually the same. Trolling cranks in deep water (15 plus fow) isn't my favorite method of taking fish as I would much prefer to jig or toss something toward the shoreline, but the nice thing about dragging cranks is the amount of water that can be covered and they do produce bigger fish. So the next time you head to LS block off a day to rig up with some bait walkers and a rap or bomber, etc. troll around and see what happens. Casting cranks like rattle raps, spots, wiggle warts and shad raps into emergent or mature weed lines can provide a few strikes as well."
1244801,Lonefisherman,2010-10-25 22:35:00,13,"I have been fishing Lac Suel for 12 to 14 years now and have found that Lac Suel has a diverse population of Walleyes from small to large. Fishing a body of water for only a few years and at the same time of year may not show you what a great fishery Lac Suel has in both numbers and size of fish. We fished Lac Suel in early August and had tremendous fishing, a very high number of walleyes in the 23"" to 26"" with a few in the 27"" to 28"" inch range. If you feel that the average size walleye is small compared to other lakes that you fish you may want to try a different time to fish Lac Suel and make a determination after you have tried different time periods of the year. Most lakes have their time period when they yeild more larger fish than other times of the year. This is probably true for other lakes that you have fished also. Hope that you give this some thought. Keep fishing Lac Suel and you might find out how tremendous fishing can get."
1244838,tv4fish,2010-10-26 07:17:00,2694,"Lonefisherman - My group has been fishing Lac Seul since 1985 We have fished from early May - late September (Now- let's NOT go into our ""lack of fishing skills"" OK? Mainly curious about the commercial netting - anybody ??"
1244849,KRAMER2000,2010-10-26 08:01:00,172,"Several years ago a bunch of my buds and I were on Lac Suel. After a shore lunch one of them said ""whos got a big lure, want to troll for big northern or musky on the way back to the honey hole."" So I gave him the biggest lure I had. Treble hooks, feathers, spinners. Looked like you were draging a dead chicken in the water. Sure as **** he caught the biggest walleye of the trip. 30 inches."
1244934,Guest,2010-10-26 14:47:00,0,"Pooch We fish at the resort closest to you (SSWL), but we are there in June and we have been going there for more than a decade now. It must be a seasonal thing because we find big fish. To date, our largest walleye is a 30 and 1/2"" fish. We go for a week and we have not broke 28 in a week (three guys fishing). Some years we put lots of big fish on the board, others, not so many. So they are there. It may be as OB says, your fishing structure that is dominated by a single class of fish, or it may be your not offering big enough bait. Both aremore a fall phenomena in my opening than in spring, but even in spring there are a few places we fish where you never catch a small walleye, the few you do catch will be 24"" or better. Like every fish species, the larger the fish the more rare, so on those ""big fish spots"" you might go an hour or even two without a fish. However 90% of our fishing in the spring is for fish that are mixed up, so a few cigars (not many) lots of slots, good numbers of 18 - 23, then the occassionally 24""+. I will say in the spring I don't catch many cigars, so perhaps that size/age class says away from the schools that have a few fish that could eat them. The central part of the lake has those big fish your looking for, so my guess is that your one structure that is not right for the big girls at that time of the year. Are you fishing the mega sand structures in 30+ feet of water or rocks/weeds in shallower?. Since I have not fished LS in fall, I cannot say where they are with any certaintly, but I would guess they are deep in fall 30+ or better. I have fish Eagle in fall and the spots that scream walleye (wind blown points) have fish, but they are all less than 20, the big girls are offshore and deep with the exception of a few still working the front of deep weedbeds in a late fall when the weeds are still green. Good luck and if your up in June, you may see us...IA Walleye"
1244935,Guest,2010-10-26 14:49:00,0,"Sorry, meant to say we hit or break 28 on every trip in a week of hard fishing, so the big girls are there"
1245042,fishingfever,2010-10-27 05:44:00,85,Approx. 10 yrs. ago while staying at Mahkwa we saw nets out by the Dominion Islands. We asked the natives at Mahkwa (which is on a Reservation) what was going on and we were told they were netting whitefish. That is likely because of the deep water the nets were in. That is the only netting I ever saw there.
1245057,Bigfishhunter,2010-10-27 07:14:00,803,"Angling vs. Commercial netting... Hmmmm...let's stop and think for a momentNetting - Usually done once a year, almost always in the fall.Angling - All year long.Netting - Usually set in deeper water to target moving fish.Angling - go, go, go until you find the mother load.Netting - Takes a proper/fair sample from all populations that swim into the nets.Angling - Focuses on a particular species removes, certain year classes from the lake and can leave gaps in mother natures balance. This leads to other groups of fish filling the void left by removal of a specific species or year class.Netting - Usually has quotas that the commercial fishermen must abide by.I have worked in the outfitting business for 10 years and I have seen lot's of netting and lot's of angler harvests. The lakes that I have seen wiped out were from over angling, and yet lakes that are commercially fished tend to be healthier and have great fishing."
1245064,tv4fish,2010-10-27 07:46:00,2694,"Bigfishhunter: I live on Mille Lacs Lake here in Minnesota, which is netted by Native Americans and I will disagree with you on a LOT of your ""points"". (AND, I don't have to even stop and think about it for one minute).EDIT: And just an FWIW - I have contacted the Ontario MNR and asked about the netting, we'll see if I get and answer (15 days)"
1245088,v-bay gord,2010-10-27 09:02:00,3168,"There is no comparison to what is happening on Mille Lacs Lake and a lake in Ontario that has a commercial whitefish licence, sanctioned and monitored by the MNR. I can save you the 15 day wait and confirm that there is a commercial whitefish licence on Lac Suel. I use whitefish for my fish-fry and occasionally when they are unavailable from the commercial guy here on Eagle Lake (yes, there is a commercial whitefish fishery on Eagle Lake) he has supplied me with whitefish from Lac Suel. Good quality product. I don't believe netting whitefish on Lac Suel, Eagle, or any other lake, if done properly, has any major effect on the walleye population. Eagle has had a decline in walleye populations back in the 80's but now based on recent MNR surveys can be rated with the top 20% of fisheries in the NW. The constant throughout all that time (past 50 years) was the commercial fishing for whitefish. The variables have been the implementation of slot limits, lower limits and other conservation measures. You can draw your own conclusions from that."
1245123,nitrodude,2010-10-27 11:10:00,60,"I've fished the post spawn period of LS out of the Sioux Lookout area since '95 and we've found our share of big fish, including many 30""ers using the ""big bait"" philosophy. Big artificials have been our main stay (cranks & jerks), but larger pike/muskie sized live minnows/suckers have produced as well. On the larger open water schools we've found the bigger fish at the bottom of the packs and the big live bait has played well. In current and wind swept banks, the larger artificials almost always upsize our catch size. Bites will be fewer, but worth the wait!"
1244467,Pooch,2010-10-24 16:58:00,4619,"We have been fishing Canada for many years and I have noticed something that really makes me scratch my head. Most lakes we fish seem to have all sizes of walleye in them from fry to wall hangers.Three years ago I started doing a fall trip to Lac Seul with good friends. This group mostly jigs and all are very good jig fishermen. They put a lot of fish in the boat every trip, but few really nice fish. With nice being over 26 inches. Lac Seul really seems to have a good walleye population in it from the numbers of fish caught, but the average size is much smaller than other lakes we fish.The question I keep asking myself is, if there are that many small and slot fish, where are the bigger walleye? They have to be there some where and in good numbers.Last trip two of us rented a camp boat and did a day of trolling areas not fished by others and the average size went up slightly. We did catch fish in areas that others drove over every day, both deeper water and flats, but were chased off by the wind and quit the open water search. Next year I want to do more of the same in other areas.What do you guys think?Pooch"
1244474,adempsey,2010-10-24 17:50:00,963,"One thing I have learned is that fish of the same year class school with each other. So, for example, if you're catching 13""-15"" walleye, that's probably going to account for most of your catch. If you want bigger ones you would most likely have to move from that location.The larger fish [which are also typically female] probably behave differently as far as where and how they hunt, as well as where they spend most of their time [in relation to temperature and dissolved oxygen levels]. That being said, don't forget the saying ""Don't leave fish to find fish""."
1244480,Mike Kansas,2010-10-24 19:15:00,1463,"POOCH, What part of Lac Seul are you fishing in? I have fished the ear falls area and found the Eyes to be generally smaller and far and few between. Fish seem to be bigger and more plentiful in the central and east side of the lake. Much less fishing pressure there too."
1244481,Obabikon,2010-10-24 19:18:00,2370,"It's a time period thing. LOTW's in the fall, there are times that you can't catch a fish over 17"". They all seem to be 12-15""... They school up on the mud flats, and it's tough to find a big one."

1244540,Obabikon,2010-10-25 06:10:00,2370,I should've just said... it has more to do with the fishing patterns and less to do with the lake. If you're looking for big walleyes... Lac Seul is one of the best in Ontario.
1244553,wallydave,2010-10-25 07:14:00,2151,"I have fished the Ear Falls area over half a dozen times, I have caught walleyes from 3-4 in. to 30in. and all sizes in-between. I have always been at Goose Bay in the spring, late May to mid-June. The ice-out early or late, low and high water, plus changing weather all mean you need to find where the fish are. I would like to try Ghost River, and a couple other spots, but the Ear Falls area have always been good to our group. Having never fished the late season in Ear Falls I can't speak to where the fish are, but we call it fiahing because there are no sure bets!"
1244554,stinkycat,2010-10-25 07:22:00,2018,I have encountered over the years that sometimes when you change your tactics you will pick up bigger fish in the same spots. One that comes to mind was LOW. We were Lindy rigging and catching a ton of small fish. My Brother switched to a bottom bouncer & spinner combo and immediately starting catching considerably larger fish in the exact same spot. The rest of us switched over to the BB & spinner and we all did much better on the size of the fish. .02
1244577,tv4fish,2010-10-25 08:20:00,2694,"Question for you guys (and primarily for you Canada resort owners) - Is Lac Seul commercially fished? Is there commercial fishing allowed on ANY part of Lac Seul by natives or anyone else that allows netting of fish? As we all know - when you go to a restaurant and order a walleye meal - seems like the fillets are off about a 3-4 lb. walleye. And that is the size that seems to be short of numbers? What about any of the other lakes in the Sioux Lookout area?Now a little story - a few years ago my group went on a day fly-in. We were asked - Do you want to catch a lot of fish (smaller) or do you want to catch larger fish (and not as many). We said we want big fish. Pilot flies us into our remote lake -- we put our stuff into the boat and start fishing. First fish - about 16"", 2nd fish - about 16"", and it continued that way all day !! Pilot picks us up - we complain about the small fish You guessed it - pilot flew us into the wrong lake Yeah - we got a partial refund, but very disappointing."
1244623,Bill Krejca,2010-10-25 11:16:00,6107,"Pooch, It seems that many times the smaller buggers congregate together. Many times, it has been necessary to move to a different spot to get into larger sizes. At LOW, last month, using 2"" tubes, we got many, many cigars while fishing for crappies - 20-40'; they seemed to hang out together. At O'Sullivan this year in July, the smaller ones were in the weeds/shallow water, with the larger farther out, in deeper water. I also firmly believe that bigger baits will get bigger fish. We targeted the smaller eaters (15-17"") by purposely using smaller (3"") baits. If I wanted bigger fish, I'd really think about using 4-6"" or larger bait. Think Gulp! minnows/jerk baits. Gobbing some extra bulk (multiple baits) on the hook also might be an advantage for the bigger fish. Re: all same maximum size in lake - I always felt suspicious that netting is occurring in other lakes I've fished where many same size clones - nothing bigger than 3 lbs - are caught in the same body of water for an extended period of time. Gill nets are quite able to sort by size. Bill"
