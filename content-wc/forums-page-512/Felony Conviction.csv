1244810,adempsey,2010-10-25 23:42:00,963,"This should help:http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/informa...des/5312E3.aspHe may have to fill out the rehabilitation forms, but it looks like he will be considered rehabilitated if it has been 10 years. However, it depends on how the Canadian courts would treat the crime if it were committed in Canada.Regardless, you definitely need to look into the matter."

1245263,chicofish,2010-10-27 23:00:00,2,"I was an immigration officer for 10 years, and I know that you have to apply for what's called ""minister's consent"" before you try to cross the border. If you get caught lying they will deport you.You have to apply to ottawa, it is not as hard as you think , just a bit of paper work. You have to understand that both countries aid each other with their respective security bank systems. If the canadians want info on an american citizen, they call U.S. Immigration and they get the info, the same with the americans. Also it depends on the crime if they let you in. I hope this helps."
1245738,alanexpup,2010-10-29 23:19:00,278,HI. we have been up there many many times and they have never asked for an ID. they dont even know who you are not to mention any record you might have. they might run your plate but that would only be good for the vehicle owner thats if they asked for his ID. how about that.
1245755,Mark R,2010-10-30 07:05:00,1538,when was the last time you crossed into Canada and didn't get asked to show ID? Where do you cross.
1245783,chicofish,2010-10-30 08:54:00,2,"You are correct. You can go across and nothing will happen. But you are taking a big chance. For example, how about a car accident, The cops will do a security check and because you are not a resident they will check with USINS and guess what will happen depending on the answer. The truth is that it is not worth the risk when all you have to do is contact your nearest port of entry or Canadian consulate and get what you need to cross with out being hustled by Canada Border Officers . The same goes for Canadians going south. If you like taking chances then go for it. Remember that once you cross the border and you didn't disclose your criminal conviction at the border, you are illigaly in the country, even if you were waved thrugh by the officer."
