1241590,Campcountry,2010-10-10 20:22:00,164,In the Winnipeg River system that time of year you will catch Walleye bottom bouncing with spinners and crawlers over deeper hard bottom structure - 30 ft to 60 ft. Bottom bouncing with a minnow baits (Rapala Countdown or Floating Rapala) will also work well but crawlers will work better if they are finicky when you are there.In August I have found that some good Bass can be found right tight to the shore in the afternoon - they are feasting on crayfish but will take just about any bait. Mepps # 3 and up Aglia spinners always work well for me.
