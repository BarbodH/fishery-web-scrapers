527601,jale6666,2003-02-11 20:28:00,14,"am thinking of going here fore some northern pike fishing in the spring. what area's of the lake offer the best pike fishing, what outfitters are near quality pike fishing. what sizes of pike can be expected?thanksjale6666"
527602,Guest,2003-02-12 06:50:00,0,"I was going to answer on the kipawa.com site, but may as well do it here. I would not consider Lake Kipawa a 'pike' lake by any stretch of the definition. In the past 3 years we've gone there, we've done a LOT of pike fishing and have only seen a few. It's no secret that pike are very predictable in terms of location and easy to catch once you locate them. The thing about Lake Kipawa is that it is a big, deep lake...there are only a few locations where pike would gather. We've fished these areas extensively and have only hooked into a few. We go to Lake Kipawa for walleye and lake trout, and for those species the lake is excellent. However, unless you plan on hitting a lot of portage lakes while staying on Lake Kipawa, I would suggest looking elsewhere. There are much better pike lakes in western Quebec and northern Ontario, I guarantee it. For example, only about 70 miles south of Lake Kipawa and about 10 miles east of Callander, Ontario lies Lake Nosbonsing. Great smallmouth and pike lake...not nearly as big as Lake Kipawa.Good luck in your search."

527604,jale6666,2003-02-12 12:04:00,14,"what lakes in western quebec/north-eastern ontario do you suggest for some decent pike. i am taking my father and due to his bad back we cam only travel about 5-6 hours max. from ottawa. will be taking our own boat and are looking for something a little more remote than nosbosning. just a no frills, housekeeping, boat-in or drive-in is all that we require. i would love to see him catch a 10lb pike or bigger.thanks alotjoe[email protected]"
527605,retire55,2003-02-12 13:13:00,1029,"Joe:For starters, you may want to at least look at the following web sites:http://www.lac-berthelot.com/index.htmhttp://www.pavillonbarklake.com/defaulta.htmAs well, you can puruse through the various outfitters in western Quebec by looking at the following web site:http://www.pleinair-quebec.com/pourvoiries.html"

527608,jale6666,2003-02-23 17:45:00,14,Dinky i assume you have been to this camp. is it on a lake or the river itself?how are the accomodations and how are their rates?thanks for the replyjale6666
527609,Dinky,2003-02-24 17:37:00,307,"Jale, Been there about 4 times.used to go to a place up river from it and the place changed owners. Turned to $hit. This camp is situated on the SE end of Lac Des Quinze which is also part of the Ottawa river. You can either fish des Quinze or Lac Simard. You dont have to stray more than 10 miles from camp. These lakes have big pike,walleyes,sauger,and smallmouth. The Pike I get are all caught casting the bays along the river or lakes. The cabins are real nice,mostly 2-3 bed room. I think he has some 1 bedroom. I havent been there for a year but if my memory serves me right we paid something like $400.00 for the week. I brought my own boat and only bought,gas and a few crawlers. The cabins are all brand new,with indoor shower and comode,cieling fans,stainless sinks,microwave,electric coffee pot. Almost Like home. The cabin we always get has a couch,love seat,and end tables. Just no TV.LOL They also have a resturant,and bar. The owners are from Warren,Ohio but now are Canadian Citizens. Cant say enough about this place. Probably the 2nd nicest place I have ever stayed in Canada. All this and good fishing all through the summer.I dont recieve anything for the kudo's,Its just when I find I nice place I will tell others. Iv'e been to too many ##### holes in the North Country and dont want others to experiece what I have."
527610,Pond scum,2003-02-25 20:40:00,754,"You may also want to consider O'Sullivan Lake Lodge in Quebec. It is about 5 to 6 hours from Ottawa. I do not know the web site, but if you do a search, you should be able to find it. My father has gone their many times and loves the place. Excellent pike and walleye fishing."
