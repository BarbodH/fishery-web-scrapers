1243454,Bill Krejca,2010-10-19 09:19:00,6107,"j, If you are staying near the falls, try just below it, and in that general area. They are very particular where they hang out, also definitely ask at the resort at which you are staying. South of Hay Island was good a month ago, also Obabikon, if you want a longer boat ride. I used to have very good success in Sand Bay, but haven't tried it for some years. Most folks use a 2- hook crappie rig with minnows; I prefer a bright colored tube jig, heavy enough to get down to them. They are usually 25- 40 ft down, use a depth finder to locate them after you get in the area where they are supposed to be. If you catch any over about 24 ft down, keep in mind that they probably won't live if they are thrown back, due to the ""bends"". For more tips, go to https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=171729 Please post the results when you get back; a lot of us like to hear how it was. Also, it is appreciated, and considered good etiquette (at least by me) after we try to help out a fellow fisherman (or fisherwoman) and then actually receive some feedback. Good luck! Bill"
1243556,Guest,2010-10-19 18:15:00,0,Thanks Bill for the info. We will let you know how it went when we get back.
1245769,J Renn,2010-10-30 07:53:00,1,"Bill, Back from LOW. We really struggled finding any Crappies. They were not in the bay by the falls and didn't appear to be schooled up. Nothing at Hay Island either. We were not the only ones having trouble finding them. No one was catching any. Thanks for the information anyway, we will have to try it again. Thanks."
1245777,Bill Krejca,2010-10-30 08:35:00,6107,"J, If you are going up to try again in 2011, please send me an email sometime before you go, and I'll try to give you a few extra tips. Thanks for replying after your trip, it is appreciated! Bill Krejca"
1246018,jigngrub,2010-10-31 18:43:00,304,"Dude?!!! Why would anyone go to the LOW to target Crappie? I'd be targeting Musky, Poike, and Wall-ice!Crappie can be tough to find if you're not familiar with the lake, much to the disbelief of others... they're schooling and Nomadic fish. They don't just hunker down by structure day in and day out like some folks tend to believe, they follow the bait/food!One of the best ways to find them is to long line troll jigs or cranks, you can quickly cover a lot of water and watch the sonar for likely holding areas. Crappie will hold in a pattern like this on the sonar... xx...x...x x...x...x...x...x x..x...x...x x..x....xWhile other species will hold in a pattern like this,x...x...x...x x...x.....x....xIf you should spot a school of what looks like probable Crappies on the sonar, try trolling a jig or small crank at that depth in the suspected area.Troll between .8-1.2 mph and your jig weight and length of line will determine your depth, this is trial and error.. but typically, 1/32 = 4-6"", 1/24 = 6-9"", 1/16 = 9-12"", 1/8 = 14-20' depending on speed and amount of line out."
