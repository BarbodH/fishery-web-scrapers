1246759,GNO,2010-11-04 06:53:00,153,"I believe the 13% is on a guide now. If it is part of the package, then you can not get the rebate. The rebate is on packages only."
1219912,GNO,2010-07-16 20:31:00,153,"With the combined services you are elgible for 1/2 the HST. This is actually better than just the old GST rebate. You can either mail it in or your outfitter can do it on your bill and you don't have to mess around with mailing it in and waiting or possibly not getting it. It requires a little mor epaperwork on the outfitters emd but alot easier on the customer. The duty free store does not have naything to with the rebates, so I am sure they aren't up to speed with the system either."
1244069,Skyraptor,2010-10-22 10:12:00,291,"How long does it take to get this ""GST / HST Rebate""? Our group went in late August and upon returning we filled out the form and sent it in and so far we have received nothing in the form of a rebate check or anything else."
1244085,michmarbleeye,2010-10-22 13:09:00,11,5 weeks for ours. We sent ours in the 3rd wk of August and received the check the end of September.
1244134,Andre (wallyandre),2010-10-22 18:48:00,2274,Being a Canadian I found our Government very cool with our southern neighbors by giving back taxes.I spent a lot of money on the US side and I can't get nothing back in regards of taxes.Lucky you
1245441,3M TA3,2010-10-28 17:42:00,2846,Wow Andre. what kind of tax rate did you have to pay? 13%???
1245469,Andre (wallyandre),2010-10-28 19:50:00,2274,"Only 7% but with the amount that I spent this could be more lures, rods etc...I would prefer to pay 13% and get almost everything back"
1245585,Seanik,2010-10-29 09:55:00,218,"Andre, As US citizens applying for the HST tax rebate we get 6 1/2% of the 13% tax on certain goods and services not almost everything back as you suggest. We pay the full 13% on most purchases. Our sales tax at 7 % in some states (6% here is Pa) is half of of the HST so it evens out without the rebate. Seanik"
1245593,tv4fish,2010-10-29 10:41:00,2694,Andre: Believe me - I wouldn't mind paying 13% and getting 1/2 back. I DO mind paying 13% and getting nothing back.
1245695,MidWestFishman,2010-10-29 17:09:00,44,"I must be a little thick and need more of an explanation. If I go to a drive in lodge, as I understand it I pay 13% HST. Now If I pay for a guide as a seperate expense, am I charged 13% HST for that also? I have never had to pay any taxes for a guide before. Do I need to plan on that?"
1246405,tv4fish,2010-11-02 10:34:00,2694,"Someone will correct me if I am wrong here, but read some of the previous posts in this thread. My understanding is that you would not get a refund on the lodge expense at all. Regarding the guide service - I don't think you pay the HST on that in the first place ?? But if you do (have to pay the HST), I don't think that qualifies for a refund either as it is not part of a ""package"". Anybody else know for sure?"
1219723,phishfearme,2010-07-16 10:28:00,1242,"we just paid $1050 for the 13% HST for our trip - i know that the GST rebate dissappeared some time ago but that the ""tour package"" rebate is still available (?). i applied for this last year and never got a response (but did get a ""tour package"" rebate the previous year). you must have two services provided to qualify (flights and short term accomodations qualify) and your receipr must specify this. any other experience here? the form is still available but with the replacement of GST/PST with HST, do we now apply for 50% of the HST? facts only please. thanks, phish"
1219735,tv4fish,2010-07-16 11:09:00,2694,"phish: Based on what we were told at the ""Duty free"" shop in Fort Frances - I think we all are SOL. I could be (and I hope) I'm wrong, but don't think so. The gals told us that there is NO refund for the HST on a stay at a camp for fishing purposes. Now - granted, this HST is new.http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tp.../menu-eng.html"
1219745,phishfearme,2010-07-16 11:27:00,1242,"TV - you have to ask the right question! there must be two services provided as it states in your link: ""tour packages that include eligible short-term accommodation and a service in Canada where the first night of accommodation in Canada is after March 2007"" going to a drive in camp does NOT apply - but if you hire a guide then it does. similarly, flight services apply. the receipt we got specifically stated that there are two different services (short term accomodations and flight services) so it should apply - AND in 2008, we did receive a rebate under this program - but not last year. phish"
1219758,tv4fish,2010-07-16 11:59:00,2694,"phish: What can I say ?? We did not do a ""fly-in"" this trip. Ours was a 1 week stay at a camp where we bring our own boat (and no guide). Are you going to get/keep the rebate for your whole group? We get one receipt for the 3 of us from the camp --- so, ONE of us would have to file for the refund and then ""distribute"" the rebate to the other 2 (And, in our group, no ONE can be trusted !!) j/k. I w/b curious to see how you fare with the rebate process?Edit to show def. of ""tour package""Tour packageA tour package must be an eligible tour package to qualify for the rebate for tour packages or short-term accommodation for resale as part of a tour package. An eligible tour package must include either short-term and/or camping accommodation in Canada and at least one service. Examples of services would be transportation services or guide or interpreter services. In addition, the package must be sold for an all-inclusive price. Packages that include a convention facility or related convention supplies are not eligible tour packages for purposes of the GST/HST rebate."
1219766,v-bay gord,2010-07-16 12:20:00,3168,"Phish.......from my understanding a cabin counts as eligible accomodation and you need one other service included in the ""package"". I am using fish cleaning as my other service and have this specified on the receipt I give my customers. I was told this should work and the guest is eligible for %50 of the HST on the package. I have been sending in the forms for my guests but have not heard back from any if they have received their refund. Gord"
1219805,phishfearme,2010-07-16 13:43:00,1242,"TV - good points!! although we all trust each other in our group - we always ""cut the cards"". anyway, to make things easy for the outfitter, i collect from everybody and write one check to the outfitter. so, i guess i could be considered a tour operator. i've made the application in the past then distributed it to the guys as a discount for next year's trip. in 2008 when the US dollar was much stronger than the canadian dollor, our rebate check was in canadian dollors even though we paid in US dollars - so we took another hit there. thnaks for the post. phish"
1219809,phishfearme,2010-07-16 13:47:00,1242,"thanks V-bay - technically your ""service"" should work. which form do you use? the one i've found has ""GST118 E (08)"" on the lower laft of the form. 50% of our $1050 HST fee is nothing to spit at - it's worth the try but our outfitter was not at all optimistic. phish"
1219818,v-bay gord,2010-07-16 14:01:00,3168,"My form is a ""GST 115 E (08)"" Top says ""GST / HST Rebate Application for Tour Packages. I have it saved on my computer as a document and could email it if you need one."
1219881,phishfearme,2010-07-16 17:41:00,1242,"V-bay - i'd appreciate either the link to this form or an email to [email protected] it's probably the same but just like to check. thanks, phish"
1219901,v-bay gord,2010-07-16 19:39:00,3168,It's on its way.
