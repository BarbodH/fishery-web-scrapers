We talked with groups from the other outposts and they said it seemed much slower than years past. No big fish to speak of just lots of eaters. We had great weather up until wed. night and then the front moved in. Water temps went from 73 to 65. We still had a great time and had many other highlights besides the fishing. We saw moose, eagles, loons, beaver, fox, & ground hog. A group from Ohio actually got video of a lynx swimming across the lake! On the way up we stayed in Wawa and we discovered hands down the best deal in town. I would recommend High falls motel and cabins. http://www.highfallsmotel.com/Anna & Zenon were great hosts, the place was clean, great mattresses, 40in tv, and great location just outside of Wawa. We also ate at the Embassy in town for breakfast which was great and also had a great meal at Kinniwabi Pines (I'd recommend the Trinidad Spicy Pork). I thought Howard's camp was especially nice for the price. Also no mice what so ever(that's a big plus with our group). The newer propane fridge and freezer were great! Generator ran like a champ and the big 16ft boat was nice for the rough water(which got a little scary at times). Overall it was a great trip spent with my dad and uncle. We ate like kings, drank a little too much, and laughed alot. Oh and they loved the Zodi portable shower unit. After seeing the abundance of leeches in the water they really didn't feel like taking a bath in the lake. Thanks to everyone who gave their time and advice... it was much appreciated. Counting down the days to our next adventure where ever that may be."
