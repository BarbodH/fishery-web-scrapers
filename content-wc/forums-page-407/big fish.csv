1477514,Bigstorm,2012-08-21 13:38:00,799,"I'm all for good health discussion on topics like these and I do believe it may open someone else's eyes to a different perspective. Going about it the way that some have on this topic is just wrong.If they are that concerned with someone keeping what their legal right is, maybe they should use a canoe for fishing since thier outboard burns fossil fuels and polutes the air and water which can have a negative impact on walleye populations too"
1477465,Guest,2012-08-21 11:59:00,0,"Killing a limit of 16 fish removes those from the system and nobody can catch those later on either. Fish are always growing, breeding, and dying. . And fish will continue to replace those that die  whether we kill them or they die from a different cause. There is a safe harvest level for any population of fish that a lake can sustain. Some big fish can be in that harvest and still have a healthy population to carry on. When the DNR won't allow an angler to kill any fish from 17 to 26 or 28 as is common on lots of local lakes, you can hardly fault someone for clobbering a big one once in a while. It is dang hard to invite some family/friends over for a nice walleye feed when a 1-man limit is 4 fish under 17 . Toss in a big fish or two and you can put on a nice spread."
1477478,Bigstorm,2012-08-21 12:19:00,799,"Not to get snappy, but provided nobody is breaking the law, mind your own business. That doesnt mean that I keep every legal walleye I catch, but I dont worry about what others do when it is legal. I spend $1200 to go to Canada and bring home my (4) walleyes. That comes out to $300/fish. Granted that bringing home the 4 legal walleyes is not the only reason I go, but I should be able to do so without being judged by anyone I see this problem everywhere in life, not just here. Why do people try to make their opinion be the correct one? Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, its part of free will along with voicing that opnion. Forcing your opinion or belittling others who do have your same opion is wrong."
1477484,MrSimon,2012-08-21 12:32:00,922,"If you are trying to feed your friends and family, go to the grocery store. If you want them all to eat fresh walleye, tell them each to buy a license and point them toward the dock."
1477488,MrSimon,2012-08-21 12:47:00,922,"I think the point is that since we all are fishing from the same resource pool, what others do with those resources IS our business. What one person does effects us all. Ontario's lower creel limits, slot limits, C&R, and other such regulations have been effective, and therefore have proven that lower and more selective harvesting means better fishing for everyone."
1477490,Guest,2012-08-21 12:53:00,0,"Is going to the store to buy walleye that was commercially netted somehow morally superior to killing the fish myself? I don't think that is the case. My wife and I enjoy having family for many nice fish fry dinners a year. Between 3 parents and 3 aunt/uncles that are always on the guest list, the youngest is 78 yrs old. I refuse to apologise to anyone for providing an excellent meal to family that simply can't provide it for themselves. So yes - I will continue to kill a limit of walleyes for everyone on my boat on a regular basis including the occasional big one, and I will continue providing fresh walleye dinners to family and friends. On my next trip to LOTW, the first 28"" that crosses the gunnel will be iced in your honor. A"
1477492,HeHooksHimself,2012-08-21 12:56:00,725,"The most recent post by MrSimon exposes how this is a circular argument. Someone smarter than all of us has determined the limits to sustain a healthy population of game fish. When the current limits are no longer effective, the limits will be adjusted. Why don't all you people wagging your fingers put that energy into changing the rules if you don't like them as they are and stay out of other peoples' business as long as they are within the current law. If they break a law, turn them in. Otherwise worry about your own catch. There, now i feel better!Fish On!"
1477496,NathanH,2012-08-21 13:01:00,697,"[QUOTE=MrSimon;1477488]I think the point is that since we all are fishing from the same resource pool, what others do with those resources IS our business. What one person does effects us all.With this logic we should control all resources food, gas, housing, everything. At the end of the day folks are not going to agree on this subject. So I dont see much point in talking about it anymore. I would hope folks would turn large fish back but if they dont I dont fault or judge them for it."

1477507,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 13:25:00,3168,"Maybe the point of a discussion of this nature is to voice all sides of the issue. That way maybe those who are new to the game can make an informed decision on what they will do when a big fish comes their way. Heaven forbid that we force any old codger on this board to break from their own tradition....whether they catch and release, or catch and kill."
1477340,SinOrSwim,2012-08-21 07:32:00,1528,We used to go with an outfitter (who was the best one we have ever had) that said he wouldn't even post a picture of a big fish being held vertically. Said they should be held horizontally and explained about organs etc moving and it can kill the fish. Not completely sure if all that is true but he instituted his own conservation rules on his fly-in lakes and the fishing is amazing every single year.
1477347,Freytown,2012-08-21 07:49:00,770,Stop watching then....problem solved.
1477372,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 08:40:00,3168,That's true.....plus very large heavy fish do not have a spine designed to support all that weight in a vertical position and out of the water. Imagine someone grabbing you by the jaw and lifting you around for a few pictures. Supporting a fish horizontally under the belly will help to minimize this problem.
1477393,RyanK1,2012-08-21 09:22:00,244,I never keep a large fish if I don't have to. I'm just trying to say that you can't attack a person for keeping his legal catch. Do I agree with it? No but I won't be angered to much if someone put all that money in and wanted to keep his prize.
1477399,1860Angler,2012-08-21 09:37:00,2642,"Keep big fish or don't keep big fish, Mercury vs. Yamaha, Lund vs. Ranger, Humminbird vs. Lowrance. We all make different decisions and have different views on what's the ""best"", how boring would it be if we were all the same!! Do what you want to as long as it's within the limits of the law and have fun doing it!!"
1477406,MrSimon,2012-08-21 09:49:00,922,"I agree with this 100%. Its their right to keep any legal fish they want.Quote: Originally Posted by RyanK1Do I agree with it? No but I won't be angered to much if someone put all that money in and wanted to keep his prize.You are right, no point in getting angry - life is too short for that ........ but, the mentality of ""Keeping his prize"" is what we need to get past. Unless the fish is dead (it happens, but can usually be avoided), then there is absolutely no valid reason to keep a trophy fish. So to the people who say ""I paid my money and I'll keep whatever I catch"", I'll say, ""Ok, but why?"""
1477416,Just One More Cast,2012-08-21 10:00:00,258,HaaaH...I can imagine somebody trying to support me by my belly It'll take more then one of ya especially since I'm ticklish
1477424,Guest,2012-08-21 10:22:00,0,"There is ONE valid reason.....because the angler WANTS to. That is enough reason for me. My brother-in-law caught a 28.5"" walleye this summer and when I netted and measured it, the first thing he said was ""I want to keep it"". He is 57yrs old and it was his biggest ever. I filleted it and cooked it on the grill, and it was an excellent meal for 4 adults. I can not fault him for that. He has killed EVERY walleye over 27"" he has ever caught.......all ONE of them. Killing that fish was not a negative."
1477443,SinOrSwim,2012-08-21 11:11:00,1528,"This post sort of makes my point. It took him 57 years to catch a fish that big and now nobody else has the chance to catch that fish and take that memory home. Catching a fish that big is not that common for most people and it's certainly a lasting memory for those that have. Why take that away from someone else when I'm sure it's a story he tells time and time again. My biggest was right at 30"" about 8 or 9 years ago and I can remember the whole process in the boat. Went from thinking it was a fish to thinking it was a snag or log and then it went on a huge run. I released it after taking pictures and I had a replica made. I still caught it and now after 9 years maybe a few more people have had a chance to experience the same thing I did."
1477444,Guest,2012-08-21 11:18:00,0,"Keeping on the Canada subject, it's clear that the best fishing is in the lakes on which the outfitter has mandatory catch and release for trophys. Keeping a big fish is selfish, plain and simple. I've released dozens of walleyes over 28"" and 5 over 30"", and never kept one larger than the low 20's. There's no reason to do it. Does the once in a lifetime thing validate the decision? No, it doesn't. It's true that you're having a smaller impact on the fishery, but it's a negative impact nonetheless. Should you be strung up from the nearest tall oak for it? Of course not! But don't tell me it's OK because you only did it once. You're lucky the guy before you released that fish. He could have kept it, you know, just that one time."
1477237,bigwillies,2012-08-20 21:21:00,515,I have been watchin these message boards for to long and I can't take it anymore. guys posting pics of their catch 26'' to 30'' walleyes standing in their garage or kitchen. to top it off with a big dumb smile on their faces! PUT THEM BACK!! U guys should be ashamed of your selves!!! try golfing!
1477242,RyanK1,2012-08-20 21:35:00,244,"Their fish. They caught it. As long as they are within the limits of the law then I have no problem with it. Do I do it? Not often. But they aren't doing anything illegal. If the fish won't revive, I'd rather keep it then let it rot on the shore."
1477250,bigwillies,2012-08-20 21:53:00,515,"I understand ryan.but to keep a fish like that! take a picture, let it go and get it made. it will last forever."
1477305,SinOrSwim,2012-08-21 05:59:00,1528,"This same debate is going on in the general discussion area but those people who think ""their fish..they caught it"" mentality don't understand someone else probably caught that fish and released it allowing them to catch ""their fish"". Now that they took it home nobody else gets a chance to catch that big fish. The fewer big ole fish the less chance anyone has to catch them. Take a picture in the boat and let it go. Only thing that changes is the background of your garage or the background of the lake. But, they probably have to show their buddies."
1477311,NathanH,2012-08-21 06:23:00,697,First of all I dont know what this topic has to do with Canada it seems it better placed in other areas if it even needs to take place at all. The other thing I have an issue with is who are you to judge how other folks handle fish they catch with in legal limits? I'm of the opinion that large fish should be let go unless its that fish of a lifetime that you wish to keep. That being said thats my opinion and the personal choice I make when I fish. Not a standard others are held too.
1477316,MrSimon,2012-08-21 06:28:00,922,"This is always a touchy subject. Its important to respect a man's right to keep fish, within the law. Personal attacks, name calling, and using a holier-than-thou attitude should be avoided. Its just petty. We've all seen the on-line pissing matches. They don't solve anything. With that said, I personally believe that there is no reason to keep big fish. Bragging rights? Digital photography, social media, and the internet will allow you to show off your fish to more people than putting it in a cooler. Eating it? Smaller fish are a lot more plentiful, easier to catch, and taste better. Mounting it? Replicas are a superior alternative to traditional taxidermy. So talk to people and politely spread your ideas, but don't be pushy ..... but most importantly, spend your money at lodges with a solid conservationist attitude and policies."
1477322,v-bay gord,2012-08-21 06:50:00,3168,"Pictures of big fish are great! The best ones are with a lake in the background and the fish being released. In the water shots are a highlight. It used to be common to see photos of muskie being held vertically by the head in some musky magazines. Now, with better knowledge, and with policies on what they will publish, you hardly ever see these types of photo's. In the end it sends a message.....""handle your fish properly"". Perhaps with more release type pictures of walleye, and less ""in the garage"" shots, the same trend will occur with walleye anglers. Maybe WC could start the movement by having a section of ""great release photo's"" ?? As always though, there are times when harvesting larger fish is appropriate, or unavoidable.......a picture in the garage may be the best you can do at these times."
1477325,micropterus,2012-08-21 06:56:00,450,No exceptions!!
1477331,gholtz,2012-08-21 07:10:00,14,"first of all if I am paying that kind of money I am going to keep what i want to keep as long as it is legal. 2nd of all there may be circumstances in which keeping a fish is necessary, such as taking too long to get a hook out or catching a deep fish and they wont survive. so all i can say is watch your own bobber and keep what you want and i will keep what i want."
1477335,Campcountry,2012-08-21 07:14:00,164,Ypu can add another to that great list - mercury - (which is in the food chain and not is water) accumulates over time and age in fish and in fish eaters. The bigger older fish have tons of mercury which is then transferred to accumulate in your body. Smaller fish are safer to eat.
