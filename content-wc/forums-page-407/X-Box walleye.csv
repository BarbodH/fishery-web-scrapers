Basically straight jigging while holding position (piece of cake with the I-Pilot) and watching your jig on screen. If you ice fish with electronics you already know how fun it is playing ""X-Box"".It was nice to find some keeper size on this lake. Its a deep Lake Trout lake and its normal not to get a walleye under 20"".All the fish were in the 30'FOW range in pretty featurelss and structureless areas, although the second spot where i got the 29""er was near the drop off to 80""FOW. Cant recommend the X-box method enough, really lets you see how the fish are reacting to baits allowing you to adjust your presentation to trigger strikes. Jig and minnows were the bait. Wind was howling at 20kmh+ from the WNW.Here's a Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g2ow...ature=youtu.be"
