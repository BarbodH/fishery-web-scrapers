Used both crawlers and leeches. Both worked. Nothing really large, big walleye was 25"" and big northern was 35"". Fish seemed to be moving around, good spot one day had nothing the next. Caught them from 8' to 30' mostly on points and main lake humps. Stayed on Abram but fished Minnitaki mostly. Lake level is up. Good Luck to you."

Dont over look northeast bay, or the islands on the way, good fiahing in there with lots of wind protection. I havent been in troutfish bay much lately, but I hear the fishing in there has been off and on lately. but the mouth of it is pretty good by the red bouy, but be careful big rock on the inside of that bouy. Mcdonald island at the green bouy has been pretty consistent the last few weeks. but all this all depends on the winds. good luck fishing gents, Im sure Ill be seeing some of you out fishing here shortly"
