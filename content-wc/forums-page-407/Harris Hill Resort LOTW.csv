I have never heard of them, but he's interested because they are relatively cheap for what we want...HK and bringing our own boat. Has anyone has any experiences with them? We would mainly be targeting muskie with the occasional walleye fishing. Thanks."

1476286,MikeMcC,2012-08-18 15:20:00,72,I was planning to stay and camp once but I pulled the plug and headed on to Morson after checking out the facility. I really did not like the looks of the boat launch. I had a new 18.6 Lund Tyee and decided I didn't want to launch it there. The waves were pounding into a not real protected harbor/launch. Also looked like a hazard was marked with a jug right at the bottom of the boat launch? The lady that owned the place was in the middle of a massage when I arrived and couldn't immediately show me around. Just my opinion but you may be more satisfied at one of the Morson resorts.
1477530,ret-ro,2012-08-21 14:32:00,41,Gary and Cheryl are very nice. We use the launch there mostly. They have a concrete ramp that's pretty good. They are located in a unique spot which allows you to get out and fish when you can't most other places. They have camping sites and cabins & fish cleaning shack. I would rate it about a three star resort. It's not the ritz but it's functional.
