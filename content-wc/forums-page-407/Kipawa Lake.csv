1471314,mcsteve,2012-08-06 13:50:00,13,I've fished both ends. North out of 3 Seasons Camp and south out of Alwaki Lodge. Both produce everything you have asked for is good qty. There are many great lodges and I would suggest checking out kipiwa.net to explore them. Many great posts there about the different lodges and the fishing. Good luck.

I have been following them on the forums and staying in touch, they seem to have a loyal following as does 3 seasons. Nice looking fleet of boats and motors also."

1478826,adempsey,2012-08-24 09:39:00,963,"I did some research on Kipawa a while back for a trip [didn't end up going, Dad didn't want to give any money to Quebec, lol] and recall that most claimed that 3 Seasons and Alwaki were located closer to good fishing areas.Personally, I liked Two Moon Lodge. I believe it's the same general area as 3 Seasons.Here is a map with some lodge locations on the lake. There are many not listed at all though, like Taggarts Bay, Kipawa Lodge, Alwaki.Best bet is to go to the Kipawa website as already mentioned.Good luck!"
