Is it illegal to scoop some out if you took a fine mesh butterfly net if you were simply going to use them as bait on the spot and not transport or even take back to camp?"

1478443,wallydave,2012-08-23 13:22:00,2151,This question has come up before. If your a Canadian citizen its legal it not I believe its illegal. Try the search function on the tool bar. Good luck!
