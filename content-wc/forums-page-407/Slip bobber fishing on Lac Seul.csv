1478004,bigtimeelectric,2012-08-22 12:43:00,174,"BTMBNCR, yes that did work very well all week. My sister has a tough time feeling that subtle bite on the jig so the bobber is a perfect situation for them as my brother in law can handle catching fish on the jig well. She was using a bare hook with a couple split shots and a half a crawler, real ""old school"". And as far as my honey holes in big mac I don't think there is any secrets there as I see alot of ""community"" fishing spots there, You got my group intrigued with your long runs down to the main basin. I am sure we will see more of that part of the lake the next trip we make which will hopefully be next year. \\Every year we are tempted to try different lakes in canada, but after months of discussion we always end up back at Little Beaver Lodge, it is a tough habit to break. Although I was able to pry a big fish spot out of Doug this year and he promised me 1 more if I come back next year....... I need to start going up once a month in the summer and just leave theboat sit there.... now theres a thought I am going to consider......... Good luck everybody keep the LS posts going"
1478044,Guest,2012-08-22 14:01:00,0,We always stop on a quiet point and anchor for lunch and fish slip bobbers. Many times it is hard to get sandwiches made and consumed when the bite is on. Many laughs and memories watching bobbers
1478152,Thumpr50,2012-08-22 18:59:00,139,"Only experience I have with slip bobbers on Lac Seul is off the dock...one of our traditions is to go down to the dock after dinner with lawn chairs, cocktails (since we don't drink while out in the boat) and slip bobber rigs...always catch some walleyes, this year the biggest one off the dock was 24-1/2""!"
1478157,jkwildhunting,2012-08-22 19:03:00,361,What do you guys prefer to use on the end? I heard some guys prefer to use a light jig 1/16-1/8 oz so the minnow looks real as it sits under the float.
1478298,btmbncr,2012-08-23 06:37:00,492,"Bigtimeelectric I was just teasing about giving up your honeyholes.Lucy and I are trying to decide if we are going to stay for 3 weeks or a month.The last 2 weeks of July and the first 2 weeks of August,her suggestion. Next time come down to the main lake and I'll show you a couple of big fish spots.The long boat ride was worth it. How far do you keep the bait up off the bottom,usually,with a slip bobber setup? I'm eating Blueberries we picked in Canada by Lac Seul as I type this.Yum!!!!!Bill"
1478447,Thumpr50,2012-08-23 13:27:00,139,size 4 or 6 red hook with a split shot for weight and a minnow hooked through the middle of the back has proven best for us...
1478452,tv4fish,2012-08-23 13:40:00,2694,"Don't be afraid to try a leech, either. Just hook it through the sucker (tail) - they wiggle pretty good hooked that way."
1478476,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-23 14:46:00,235,I second that. Just be sure to check it every once in a while to make sure that the opposite end doesn't accidentally get hooked and you have a little leach roll on your line.
1477789,btmbncr,2012-08-22 00:05:00,492,"One evening on the way back in we stopped at an island(with a great rock reef)and talked to some friends.The husband was jigging and his wife was using a slip bobber with a crawler.She was outfishing her husband for bigger fish and another boat of friends by them that were jigging.I never got the opportunity to find out more about this as we left to come home soon after that. Anybody else slip bobber fish on Lac Seul.Please educate this old man.In exchange for the info I'll give up two of Bigtimeelectrics ""honeyholes"" in Mc Kenzie Bay.(Just kidding Bigtime).Thanks Bill"
1477793,Limeyangler,2012-08-22 01:52:00,563,not sure what more you need to know? I would just give it a go if i saw that.
1477822,NickDalasio,2012-08-22 06:31:00,34,"I never fished at Lac Seul, buut there really isn't much to it, wherever you have luck jigging should work with the slip bobber. The real advantage I see is that you can keep your worm slightly off the bottom & avoid snags (and less wear & tear on your arm than jigging up & down). I just learned how to use a slip bobber last year when I went to Kipawa, makes life a lot easier when you're trying to keep a kid out of the rocks & retying jigs."
1477830,Guest,2012-08-22 06:47:00,0,I have slip bobbered Lac Seul many times and just slammed the eyes. Nothing like seeing a bobber go down.
1477835,tv4fish,2012-08-22 07:00:00,2694,Another thing to point out (and an advantage to using a slip bobber) is when/if the walleyes are suspended - use your locator to see what depth they are and then set your bobber at that depth - nothing like keeping your bait right in front of their faces.
1477852,camp chef,2012-08-22 07:40:00,915,"I have never fished in Canada with a slip bobber because of the one line rule, but in Wisconsin where you can use 3 each, bobber fishing is blast trying to keep track of 6 bobbers at time."
1477853,stumcfar,2012-08-22 07:41:00,451,"I love to slip bobber fish on Lac Seul. I probably do it at least 50% of the time. As someone earlier posted, there is nothing more fun than seeing a bobber go down. I guess it reminds me of fishing when I was a kid. It is very effective too!"
1477864,JDP,2012-08-22 08:08:00,1457,I have been slip bobber fishing on Lac Seul since 1987.Quite simply it works well in many different scenarios.
1477869,Knoxabilly,2012-08-22 08:16:00,225,"I have been slip bobbering Lac Seul since 96' first year I went. Sometimes it catches more fish then jigging, especially the days where jigging is too much action, bobber is perfect. I usually use minnows hooked through the back. My Uncle caught a 41"" Northern on a slip on Lac. Countless fish, do yourself a favor and try it next time!"
1477899,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-22 09:16:00,235,"It works well in flats but is tricky set depths around drop offs, unless you plan to just keep the bobber in one spot. I personally like to let them drift in the wind. Wish they'd let you use two rods per person in Canada."
