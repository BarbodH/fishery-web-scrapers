1477177,Pooch,2012-08-20 19:33:00,4619,"Driving directions? Go to their website, they have good directions from Hudson to the camp. Better signs going in than they used to have.Google earth had the camp not even close to where it's actually located.Pooch"
1477266,KTroller,2012-08-20 22:22:00,237,"Yeah, I have the driving directions from their website but want to confirm my interpretation of those with GPS coordinates. There are a couple of turns that don't make sense to me and the google sattelite has clouds obscuring the view.Thanks,KT"
1477285,JayM5209,2012-08-20 23:19:00,1050,"KT, try Bing maps. Use the 'aerial view"" and zoom in until you get close enough to see the roads clearly. Follow the road from Hudson or some other en route landmark and follow the route from their web site directions. This should confirm the turns for you. I think Bing's aerial view is cloud free for the area you want."
