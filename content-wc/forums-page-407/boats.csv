Ran across a 14' Genmar boat, which im not sure ive heard of, with 15 horse johnson. Believe they are2002 models. Says less than 30 hrs and both look brand new. Couple things i dont like is motor is long shaft and have to mix oil/fuel. Seems like good deal though...comes with fishfinder and new minkota trolling motor. Trailor looks like new. Wondering if anyone has knowledge of genmar boats other than i know they filed for bankruptcy! Lol. What might be a fair price......etc...would like to trail up to some drive to lodges.....thanks for any info"
