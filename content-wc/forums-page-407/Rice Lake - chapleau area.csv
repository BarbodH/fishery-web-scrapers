1478269,GOBIG,2012-08-23 02:37:00,126,"Take a lot of minnows, and have George bring more on mid week flight check. I was there about 5 years ago in late Sept. Caught over 500 walleye in a week, with crap weather and very cold. Nice cabin. Enjoy."
1478395,farmnfish,2012-08-23 10:59:00,130,"Worst trip I ever had was to Rice lake. Never even made it to the lake. It was their first week in may. As we drove north at the Soo, we heard people talking about everything still being iced in up north. Nah, we thought, George would have called us and told us if he couldn't fly that week. We had already driven 10 hours. As we head north we notice more and more snow on the road side. As we passed Chapleau, they were closing the road behind us because of rising water. We get to Ivanhoe and the ice is still thick enough people are walking on it. GEORGE WTF! Well guys ""sorry"". Oh and now all the roads are closed because of the late melt and you're stuck here. 4 days in his lodge later he tells us of a back road that will get us out. Every other trip I had to Rice was a good time, really liked flying with John as he is a bit more laid back I think, but George for the most part is a good guy too."
1468611,fisherguy,2012-07-31 12:33:00,13,"I was wondering if anyone had some info on the fishing on Rice Lake between chapleau and timmins. What kind of numbers to expect and size?If anyone has any they tips they would be appreciated, going the 3rd week of august."
1468631,fisherguy,2012-07-31 13:20:00,13,I was also wondering if i'd be better to brings or minnows at this time of year up north?
1468761,fisherguy,2012-07-31 18:03:00,13,i just hope the lake isn't fished out. I don't think it should be it's pretty large and only has two outposts. Was just hoping to hear some postive reviews.thanks
1469273,fisherguy,2012-08-01 18:02:00,13,Hopefully no news is good news.
1469350,adempsey,2012-08-01 20:47:00,963,I tried to dig up the old forums on the Air Ivanhoe site using an archiving program thing but no dice.From what I recall it's a popular lake. I wouldn't worry too much.
1469464,Pikehunters,2012-08-02 07:04:00,100,"Call George & he will give you e-mails from people that have been there. I've flown with them twice, never to rice but that is a very popular lake I'm sure you will do well!!"
1474361,canufish,2012-08-13 13:56:00,16,"Are you flying into Rice lake with Air Ivanhoe if so you will not have to worry about the lake being fished out George and Jeanne run a top notch outfit and they would not fly you in to a lake with no fish as for Bait i would bring worms and the minnows you can get next door at Red Pine Lodge,I will be flying into Katagi Lake on Sept the 9th can not come soon enough if you would like more info give me a call @ our toll free #1-866-747-7776 and ask for Mitch...."
1477384,orsonic,2012-08-21 09:00:00,1,I have been to Rice Lake and it is a great Walleye lake. Jigs with white twister tails. I was there 2008 and there were lots of fish but this lake does get lots of pressure with 3 outpost cabins. You can also get to this lake from Northpiont lake with about a 30 min boat ride in very small and shallow river.
1477390,fisherguy,2012-08-21 09:14:00,13,"I am glad to hear there are lots of fish, i'm getting really excited this is going to be fun."
1478031,farmnfish,2012-08-22 13:32:00,130,"I haven't been there for 10-12 years so keep that in mind, but I've been there quite a few times including late august. You should catch plenty of fish, seen some big walleyes and some pretty big pike too. Some days you can get skunked. Take plenty of minnows. When I first fished that lake it was billed more for pike, interesting how the big walleye took over."
