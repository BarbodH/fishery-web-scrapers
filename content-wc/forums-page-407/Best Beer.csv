1469959,RapShad,2012-08-03 05:54:00,76,"Not a Canadian beer, but if you want to take up the best beer on the planet to a beautiful Canadian lake, drive to your nearest Wisconsin super market and pick up a case of new Glarus Spotted Cow. FYI can't buy any New Glarus beers outside of Wisconsin."
1470115,labsrus,2012-08-03 10:39:00,557,"I happen to like COLD FREE YOURS My favorite is Jim's beer, my fishing buddy who always has a good stock. At the lake we have a neat boat house, that we call the man shed. It has two small friges in it, only thing in them are beer and worms. We started a collection of beer bottles, each year we try a few new beers and only the ones we like get the honor of getting put on the shelf with the collection. Not that I am counting but I leave in leass than 16 hours."
1470283,1860Angler,2012-08-03 19:01:00,2642,"Cold and Free are my two favorites, if it's free it doesn't have to be cold!! I've never met a beer I didn't like, and many that I love!!"

1471183,Mike Borger,2012-08-06 08:35:00,1554,"You and your low carb diet LOL! Buddy that stuff is vile.Water with a splash of pi$$ for flavor.Best low carb beer imo is MGD Light, but they don't sell it in Canada."
1471197,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-06 09:03:00,223,I am with you on that one Eddie. Sorry Mike I got to go with him.
1471207,Manitou,2012-08-06 09:14:00,125,http://www.fortgarry.com/Microbrewery in Winnipeg so if you're in the area give the Fort Garry beers a try.
1471216,Guest,2012-08-06 09:31:00,0,"Two Rivers is pretty popular here. I really like Half Pints, another micro brewery which is local and locally-owned. Check out their ""stop the evil spread of lite beer"" shirt. http://halfpintsbrewing.com/merch.php"
1477951,labsrus,2012-08-22 10:45:00,557,Trip Report Beers consumed in order of preference Steamwhistle Alex Keiths IPA Molson M Lakeport Labatts Blue Light - for my daughter yes we did catch a lot of walleye
1469221,ScottL,2012-08-01 15:46:00,733,I guess I resemble that remark. I prefer that type of beer and you prefer to have to use a toothpick after you drink a beer. To each his own.
1469236,tooski,2012-08-01 16:21:00,393,Good one Scott. Made me laugh on a day I needed one....
1469456,NW IA Mark,2012-08-02 06:53:00,17,Labatts Blue all the way!!
1469473,PRO-V1,2012-08-02 07:16:00,142,Best beer....................Anything and Everything that's ice coldMike
1469481,wallydave,2012-08-02 07:29:00,2151,"I have been on the search for the perfect beer for some time know! I know, it's hard work, but hey somebody has to do it! For that reason I like to experiment, but I have a few favorites I fall back on. First of all I like seasonal beers cooler weather and darker beer go hand in hand, warmer weather calls for a slightly lighter beer. I take along a 12 pk of Goose Island Summer ale, when we are at Goose Bay Camp, Goose Island is across the bay, so why not! My second 12pk might be a summer sampler, or another summer beer to fill out the one case, duty free plan. In Ontario, I'll pick up a Canadian beer, mostly Blue, sometimes Kokanee, or something different, just because its different! The best beer is the one you like nothing else really matters!"
1469531,LOW1,2012-08-02 08:42:00,2828,Is it just me or do others prefer their beer in bottles over cans?
1469540,tooski,2012-08-02 09:01:00,393,"LOW, Absolutely bottles but most outfitters ask that we bring cans as they weigh less and they aren't crazy about glass in their lakes..."
1469609,wallydave,2012-08-02 11:01:00,2151,"Unless its a fly-in, if I was a pilot, I wouldn't want to fly around in a stale beer smelling plane all season! For less weight and breakage,fly and boat ins would call for cans! From whay I have read for most some fly-ins if you brong it in, you take it out, cans again would be less weight and space!"
1469665,Guest,2012-08-02 13:30:00,0,"Blue is the most disgusting beer on the planet..... Wanna try a beer, try Innis and Gunn, that's a beer."
1469804,Jigger1,2012-08-02 17:37:00,234,"While this is basically a rehash of old beer threads, it's interesting. The last couple times, I've picked up my usual case of Labatt's Crystal and now picking up a case of Alexander Keith's IPA. I've never thought to buy beer at the LCBO but may give that a try some time. Next month I'm flying into Winnipeg for the first time and was thinking of picking up beer in Manitoba at a Liquor Mart as I don't know that we'll make it to Kenora before 6pm when the Beer Store closes. I'm open for a change and understand I may have some other options in Manitoba that I might not have in Ontario."
1468956,speckeye,2012-08-01 06:52:00,61,"Beers in Canada are basically a bunch of corporate carpola! We have a much more robust craft brewing industry stateside,with a million selections to Canada's few. They need to leave small operators to their craft,but the BIG CORPORATIONS are running that show,so we'll see if they catch us if the government lets em.Meanwhile,we take CANNED beer-say a nice Oskar Blues G'night Ale,or something else with FLAVOR and NO PRESERVATIVES.Sorry if this hits you bad,it just is true. The USA has a lot more good beer than Canada."
1468987,Bigfishhunter,2012-08-01 07:57:00,803,"not true, there are tons of good microbrews in canada. Keiths is not a micro, and neither is Kokanee. Agreed they are fine beers, but there are some great locals, especially if you drive through winnipeg. Try Fort Garry, they make some really good stuff."
1469023,TinCann,2012-08-01 09:14:00,8,Coors light
1469031,ScottL,2012-08-01 09:27:00,733,"You should really try Walleye Chop. So that you know what a truly terrible beer tastes like. I'm a Mich Golden Light, Bud Light, Coors Light kind of guy. I don't like Miller Lite, because I think it has a bitter taste to it. If you have similar taste in beer to me you will like Kokanee, but you will absolutely love Sleeman's Clear."
1469061,adempsey,2012-08-01 10:16:00,963,"Although I live in Canada, I typically buy imported beer. It's a better value since the price of premium beers in Canada has gotten out of hand.Alexander Keiths and Kokanee are decent beers. They are made by the giants though. Steamwhistle is a microbrew and is decent. I found it has to be relatively FRESH though because it can get skunky fast. You can find a list of Ontario micro-breweries here. I have tried many and the majority were all good. Quebec has some nice ones too. I often picked up beer from Great Lakes Brewery since my wife's parents live about a block away from it. They have many seasonal beers that are awesome, but their Golden Horseshoe lager and IPA are quite good. You may be able to find that in the LCBO. Regardless, if you want some good microbrews you are better off heading to an LCBO instead of a Beer Store. edit: I realized that what I said might be misleading. It really depends on where you go. In the smaller towns, the Beer Store might be a lot better than the LCBO."
1469067,labsrus,2012-08-01 10:32:00,557,"We stop in Northbrook on our way up so that is where the Beer Store is Never stopped at a LCBO, might need to check that out I have had the Keiths and I like that. Speaking of Oskar Blues, I stop in Longmont CO for work every few months and I really like Dales Pale Ale. We consider it a nice treat to buy the premium beer from the Beer Store, we are on vacation. I am not sure I could afford it on a regular basis though"
1469125,tooski,2012-08-01 12:24:00,393,"OK, lets be serious here. Many posts have included Bud-lite, Miller-lite, Coors Lite etc... If you drink a caramel colored water flavored beer that's fine... but please don't include your preference in any thread re: best beer since I assume flavor would be one of the criteria. Kinda like the guy that always orders a diet coke at McDonalds with his double cheeseburger. The majority of people that drink lite beers do so because they think they are overweight, not because they like the flavor of the beer. And the small minority that are left drink lite because they fall for the asinine advertising.. So you are either overweight or a lemming. Any rebuttal will be welcomed but please don't come back with ""but they really do taste good""..."
1469164,Tupelo,2012-08-01 14:02:00,28,X2 for Creemore Springs. Very Nice.
1469170,Dogbreath,2012-08-01 14:07:00,494,"For those who like draft beer, I have recently switched to Heinekins little keg. It holds about 18 beer and is on sale for 27 bucks. Doubt if you would find it in small towns, but if you are going by Thunder bay or Kenora it could be in either the LCBO or beer stores."
1469176,johnboat,2012-08-01 14:22:00,2014,"Yep! I Believe we have a winner! Not that I haven't had my share of Canada's finest, but I personally believe we have them beat in the beer division."
1468713,rego,2012-07-31 16:15:00,21,"It may be hard to find and I haven't tried it yet but there's a beer called Walleye Chop brewed in Mn. There, now this thread is about walleye. Oh, and you could take it to Canada too. Yea, now it concerns Canada too."
1468745,fisherguy,2012-07-31 17:28:00,13,Creemore Springs
1468755,Lund1993,2012-07-31 17:45:00,141,Shocktop or Shocktop rasberry wheat is excellent.
1468777,trapper_john,2012-07-31 18:29:00,83,"I like Carlings, but had a Koakanee for the first time this year. Pretty ****ed good."
1468781,621Dreamer,2012-07-31 18:36:00,40,"If you want something with smooth flavour try ""Old Specked Hen"" It isn't at the Beer Store in Ontario but can be purchased at the LCBO (liquor store) It only comes in cans and you'll love it."
1468782,Mike Borger,2012-07-31 18:37:00,1554,Bitburger in tall boy cans from the LCBO for me.When I'm in the mood to slum Kokanee is passable.
1468817,lakerbreaker,2012-07-31 19:35:00,253,Wow....never even heard of most of these...will have to check some of them out next week...
1468851,SteveJ715,2012-07-31 20:11:00,59,"It's not the one you'll reach for when you want a hefty IPA or Porter, but if you need something smooth and easy-drinking, it's hard to beat an ice-cold Kokanee."
1468894,Pat,2012-07-31 21:57:00,203,"Another vote for Kokanee, in fact I had two this evening, part of a supply I brought back in June! It's hard to get, but checkout Labatt's Wildcat, I've only seen it at the Beer Store once, good stuff."
1468954,REG,2012-08-01 06:51:00,445,It sounds like you like the hop monsters and this one certainly isn't - but this spring I tried some Sleeman's Honey Brown Lager - yummy stuff.
1468569,labsrus,2012-07-31 11:18:00,557,"Planning to stop on Saturday at the Beer Store on Saturday morning on our way to the lake this year. We always stop and pick up a new beer or two to try. Ones we will buy include SteamWhistle Molson M Moose Head Lager Around home I have been drinking a lot of IPA, local micro brew pubs and other hoppy beers Looking for any recommendations Thanks"
1468575,J-Man,2012-07-31 11:23:00,191,Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale...microbrew from Nova Scotia.

1468601,joeman79,2012-07-31 12:19:00,417,"Kieths is a Great IPA, and another one our group really likes is Kokanee a smooth drinking Beer."
1468613,Lovetofish,2012-07-31 12:36:00,458,Labatts Maximum Ice. Boy that sounds good right now.
1468621,SinOrSwim,2012-07-31 12:47:00,1528,Koakanee

1468654,wallydave,2012-07-31 14:03:00,2151,is the first ice cold one with the first fresh walleye fillet of the trip!! Especially if its a Blue! Kokanee comes in a close second with our group!
1468658,joeman79,2012-07-31 14:13:00,417,"104 degrees here in the lovely state of Ks today and an Ice Cold Canadian Beer of any brand sounds good to me. 2 more days of work then head north. My first beer will be between Dryden and Hudson (in the backseat, no drinkin and drivin) and it will probably be a new brand we have not tried. But I am sure it will be delicious."
1468677,oxdrift2,2012-07-31 15:06:00,37,Kokanee!! can't wait to get it every year.
