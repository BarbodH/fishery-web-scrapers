1478700,GOBIG,2012-08-24 02:32:00,126,Try Kag Lake. He just bought it and has made it a lot better. I fished it in the spring. The fishing was great. Good numbers and big fish.
1477407,bjb1929,2012-08-21 09:49:00,4,"Has anyone used Twin Lakes Outfitters out of Nakina? Planning on a trip up north next summer and have been looking at their website. Was wondering about condition of cabins, boats, and motors. Have heard good and not so good. Targeting walleyes and numbers are more important than size as 2 of us are bringing our sons. Sounds like fishing is great and our group could suffer a little on comfort in exchange for catching.Thanks, everyone"
1477427,adempsey,2012-08-21 10:24:00,963,"Solopaddler (aka Mike Borger) put up a good trip report from Lower Twin Lakes last autumn.Here is a link to the report: http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...1&#entry637672I believe it's also posted on WC, but I couldn't locate it."
1477447,hoppy63,2012-08-21 11:24:00,367,"I looked up website......sounds nice but for the money and same drive id fly in with awo. Lots of fish, no frills cabins, great scenery and can run river to other lakes if you wish, and remy will make sure you are taken care of."
1477468,adempsey,2012-08-21 12:03:00,963,"I wouldn't disagree with flying in, but the money comparison is NO comparison. A 7-day fly-in would be at least $920 per person (assuming no children/family discounts - didn't see anything on their website) and the drive-in would be ~$375 per person [4 people + cabin + 2 boats]. I am guessing you thought the price was per person, not for the cabin?Another good drive-to option is O'Sullivan Lake. There are two fishing camps on this lake. One is O'Sullivan's Rainbow, a very popular fishing camp, but the 2013 season is already getting booked up pretty fast. The other is O'Sullivan Lake Outfitters, which I understand to be quite rustic, but worth it for the great fishing the lake offers."
1477494,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-21 12:57:00,223,I talked with Chad last fall at that time he was in the process of purchasing Timberidge outposts. He said then he knew it was going to take some work to get those outposts back up to snuff. The former owner let them get run down pretty good I used them 5 times but the last time was it. Chad seemed honest and is trying to build on his outposts that he already owned. Used Remi twice over the last two years a class A outfitter had no problems with cabin or boats and all his lakes are good for fishing. Don't be afraid to look at Eddies North also if you are looking for trophy pike. Eddie is great and will work with you. Listen to Solopaddler I think he has used every outfitter around the Nakina area and probably fished most of the lakes.
1477498,hoppy63,2012-08-21 13:03:00,367,"Ok. You were correct in assumption on pricing. With that being said i have heard pretty good things on lake wabatongushi, just not a ton of feed-back. I am considering that for a drive-to, as it is only 10-11hrs drive from toledo.......do epending on traffic.... solo got any info on this lake?"
1477528,mroyle,2012-08-21 14:25:00,74,"Was at Abamasagi with Twin Lakes Air in July. See my trip report under the Abamasagi thread. Cabin, boats, motors were all good. Have no knowledge of his other outposts...there are several. Lower Twin Lakes that was referred to in the other messages is, I believe, a totally different outfitter."
1477557,adempsey,2012-08-21 15:16:00,963,Just realized I am talking about the WRONG outfitter. My apologies!
1478521,onetimedave,2012-08-23 16:40:00,502,"Will second another reply. Take a look at Arctic Watershed Outposts (AWO) out of Nakina. No frills but great service, fishing and people."
1478608,nwont,2012-08-23 19:38:00,16,"I'm sure all of the lakes you might go to will be great fishing, and the outfitter you choose will know best based on what you want. I know both of them, and would instantly pick Chad and Denis at TLO. I'm not sure about all of their camps but I do know they have been doing a lot of work to get the run down ones back up to par. I've been to a couple of Remi's as well, also clean and basic. To compare the two outfitters I would say that TLO is really putting their all into it, repairing and upgrading their outpost and becoming the first class outfitter in Nakina. AWO is on its way out, he has been trying to sell off his camps over the last couple years and is just keeping up on maintenance until he sells out. But again, as far as fishing goes, I think you will be happy with either one."
