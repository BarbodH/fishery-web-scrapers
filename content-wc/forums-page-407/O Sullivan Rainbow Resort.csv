1478292,Jeepman,2012-08-23 06:20:00,386,"I was part of a group of 8 who spent last week (Aug 11-18) fishing O Sullivan Lake near Nakina, Ontario while staying at the Rainbow Resort, Cabin #9. It was our first time to a drive-in fishing lake as we had fly-ins to other Ontario outposts each of the previous 9 years. We have been coming up from the Jenison, Hudsonville, Holland, Michigan area for the past 10 years. The Rainbow Resort with owners/operators Shelly and Bob Richardson also serving as hosts, was outstanding as to hospitality, service, facilities and equipment. The facility, cabin 9 with electricity, running water, 3-piece bathroom, etc, docks and boats/motors were excellent and were sparkling clean upon our arrival. Our first fishing outing onto O Sullivan was a bit intimidating to say the least. But thanks to Rainbow Resort which provided maps and my handheld GPS, I never got lost. However, on our first day one boat in our party arrived more than an hour late for supper getting lost among the islands on their home stretch to the cabin - they didn't have a GPS and after a while they couldn't figure out the map. O Sullivan is a huge expanse of water with literally over 100 islands. Fishing was great every time out. Catching was very slow for the first few days and by the end of the week, catching became consistent. Walleye- our best walleye catching was fishing 20-25 foot depths using 3/8 ounce jigs with 3 - 5 inch soft plastic chartreuse grubs with meat, i.e. half of a crawler or a minnow. We also caught walleye out of the cabbage patches using beatle spins with colorful 3-5 inch soft plastic grubs. The walleye ranged from 13-24 inches with excellent and consistent catches 19-22 inches. Pike - several members of the group loved to fish pike and plucked good numbers of pike in the mid-20 inch range from the edges of the vast reedy and cabbage patch bays. Our trip home was smooth which included only a 45-minute border delay crossing into the US at the Soo. However, once through customs the MI DNR fishery and game division did pull us over to ""check our licenses and our fish catch."" Upon finding everything in order including fish limits matching each sportsman license, they sent us on our way. My question--Why are the MI DNR people checking our Canadian fishing licenses and fish possessions? And what authority, if any, do they have as to enforcing the Ontario fishing regulations. In conclusion, we had a great time and everyone in the group ""voted"" to return in 2013-- yes, we are signed up at the O Sullivan Rainbow Resort for 2013. Jeepman PS Thanks to Bill Krejca and his helpful posted commentary earlier this summer. By the way, Bill's book ""A Northwoods Fisherman's Story"" is a must read for every modern day northwoods fisherman."
