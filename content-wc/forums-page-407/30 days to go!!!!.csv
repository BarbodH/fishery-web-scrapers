1477944,NARDA 1,2012-08-22 10:33:00,636,"WowMarie, have a great trip!!!"
1477957,wallydave,2012-08-22 10:54:00,2151,"Last we my wife thinking about her first trip North said"" Ten months until Goose Bay!"" Ill start the ""official countdown thread"" next January!"
1478007,WowMarie,2012-08-22 12:47:00,19,"Narda, I'm pretty sure the good time is a given. We may even leave a few fish for you..."
1478037,NARDA 1,2012-08-22 13:40:00,636,"You are right, it is a given! But between you and Gord there might not be any fish left. I that case I'll have to go to plan B and go to the bar!!!!"
1478304,WowMarie,2012-08-23 06:51:00,19,On the road for the Canadian Adventure. Eagle Lake here we come.
1473547,oxdrift2,2012-08-11 07:43:00,37,"That's what everyone say's when I stop them down here........."" Officer I only had one drink."" ........have fun"
1476590,WowMarie,2012-08-19 15:21:00,19,"We never have ""one"" until we are done fishing...then it's time for ""just ONE"" Besides we are too busy catching fish to worry about drinking...."
1476603,oxdrift2,2012-08-19 15:59:00,37,"Us also, no alcohol until we are finished fishing for the day. Not worth the chance. Bottom line, we are in a different country and even though it seeks like home , don't chance it. Have a great trip!!!"
1476617,NARDA 1,2012-08-19 16:34:00,636,"To which ""one"" are you refering, the ""first"" one or the ""last"" one??????"
1476706,WowMarie,2012-08-19 19:22:00,19,"Doesn't matter ...we always have ""ONE""..."
1476739,wallydave,2012-08-19 21:06:00,2151,"Speaking from an early season guy, to wait all summer long reading all the posts of the trips that have gone before you must be agonizing!? It seems each season has its own pluses and minuses! The folks that wait have my admiration! Its your reports that keep us early folks going!! Thanks!"
1476842,NARDA 1,2012-08-20 08:34:00,636,"Walleyedave, we start the countdown the day we leave. It's kind of rough with all the posts through the summer but then when all those trips are over I'm still looking forward to mine."
1476960,v-bay gord,2012-08-20 12:12:00,3168,"There's a good reason they should be agonizing for you Narda....we've been catching the heck out of walleyes all summer.....now near your ""favorite spots"". I'll try my best to leave a few for your group.....but I can't promise"
1477773,fishforlife,2012-08-21 21:54:00,77,"2 more wake ups and our normal group of 8 has shrunk to four, no problem, us veterans can screw up better than the rookies but since they,re not here, cant catch us. LOL Going to Brace Lake Outfitters in Nakina and flying in on Nakina AIr .ROB - John Martin - Tiger - Whacker"
1477815,WowMarie,2012-08-22 06:06:00,19,Getting all the last minute stuff done today...Leaving for tomorrow for the best week of the year...Look out Eagle Lake...the women are on the way!
1471925,oxdrift2,2012-08-07 17:51:00,37,"30 days until we leave and turn Canadian for 10 days.! Started planning as usual the day we left. It has been a long wait and long year. Soon, no phone, no TV, no people just friends fishing and nature. Just thankful to be able to do it."
1471935,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:08:00,35,ok I'll bite. Where are you headed and whats your first bait?
1471943,oxdrift2,2012-08-07 18:17:00,37,"Eagle Lake, Birchdale Lodge, Minnows first for Fresh Walleye!"
1471945,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:22:00,35,Is the place as good as it looks on the website and is wind an issue? Seems like a big open lake. Do the walleyes bite all day or just dawn and dusk?
1471950,oxdrift2,2012-08-07 18:24:00,37,"W hen we go , the lodge's are winding down. Kids are back in school. Not much boat traffic."
1471957,oxdrift2,2012-08-07 18:32:00,37,Good in the morning and dusk. Slow's a bit during the day. Wind is wind. We duck behind islands and know spots to go to if it get's to windy. This will be year 17 at the same Lodge.
1471969,Bobbajig,2012-08-07 18:52:00,24,Hope you guys have a great trip. Sounds like a great bunch of guys to fish with. My wife and I will be up on Eagle in 3 weeks. I'm sure we will leave plenty of fish. Good luck and be safe.
1471982,NARDA 1,2012-08-07 19:05:00,636,"No it's not as good as it looks on the web site....IT'S BETTER. Cheryl and Marcel took over in 2010 and continued on with what Ernie and his family had started, they have made some changes that have made it that much better. That's why I'm returning for my 24th year there with no end in sight."
1473395,Bobbajig,2012-08-10 17:48:00,24,I wish I would have booked our trip for September. We would have had the chance to meet the group and hang out on Eagle Lake for a few days. trying to get the ball rolling for a fishing trip to Eagle next September. Thanks for all the tips and hope you guys have great fishing.
1473541,WowMarie,2012-08-11 07:37:00,19,"Will be at South Shore Lodge in 2 weeks...Fishing with all the women....Can't wait, our 3rd year of awesome fishing...and I'll have ""Just One"""
