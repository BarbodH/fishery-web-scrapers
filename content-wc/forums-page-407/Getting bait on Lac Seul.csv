1477240,wallydave,2012-08-20 21:23:00,2151,We get crawlers and leeches atFour Seasons in Ear Falls. Dutchies might have bait too?! Check with Andrea at Goose Bay too! Tell her wallydave says hi!

1477402,wobbie19,2012-08-21 09:42:00,71,"X2 - We stop at Rainy on the way up, the only thing depending on timing is that they open at 6 AM."
1477440,fishingfever,2012-08-21 11:03:00,85,On 8/10 we stopped at Rainy Lake Sports. They wanted $5/doz for leeches. We passed. Got good leeches for $45/lb. about 20 minutes east of Fort Frances at the Great Bear convenience store. Open 6 AM 7 days a week. 807-274-2221. I don't know about crawlers since we picked ours up at Cabela's. Good luck.

1477712,NWE,2012-08-21 20:03:00,13,"Duchies has night crawlers $3.50 doz and nitro worms, $4.00 dozen on hand. It is too late for leeches in the area."
1477866,JDP,2012-08-22 08:11:00,1457,"Leeches last week at RLP were $5 a dozen. No 1/2, or 1 lb bags were being sold."
