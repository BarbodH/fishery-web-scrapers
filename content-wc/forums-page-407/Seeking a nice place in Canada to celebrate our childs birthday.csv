We need a good event theatre that handles all the prospects related to the party. If there is any such place in Canada, please let me know more about it. We are staying in Toronto, so somewhere relatively local would be more convenient."

My grandmother’s 70th birthday party is celebrated in Toronto in last month. It’s the guys of Capitol Events who organized the function and they did a pretty good job. You can use their website to grab more info."

(Bass Pro Shop is a couple of blocks north) The place is great for a meal (and few beers for Dad) and you could have a game of pool or lots of video games including head to head Nascar or Indy racing. It is a great place for ALL ages! http://www.daveandbusters.com/
