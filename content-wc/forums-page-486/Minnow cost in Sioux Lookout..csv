1314806,mb386,2011-06-05 17:46:00,14,We will be in SL in a weeks time and need to know what the approximate cost may be for our flyout. We have heard that the cost may be $ 91.00 US for a quart or approximately 20 doz. Any further information would be appreciated.
1314851,BenBeattie,2011-06-05 20:08:00,232,"Depends where you get them but you can count on $4/doz and more if you want larges. I'm sure if you're getting them through your outfitter it will be more. Call J&D baits in advance and Deb will have your order ready when you pass by on your way up. THey are on Hwy 72, just south of Anderson's camp. Number is 807-737-2980 They are the commercial bait harvester in the area."
1315134,JJJMN,2011-06-06 15:05:00,153,Just got back from the Opener - Strugeon Lake. Been going to same camp for many years. We ended up paying the camp $50.00 for 18doz. or $2.78 per doz. Scoop count (not per minnow) was in our favor and nice size. Not going to complain.
1315872,BigNick87,2011-06-08 08:27:00,9,If you are going throw Thunder Bay. Check out sunshine bait. We got 2 gallons for $160 a gallon around 100 doz. per gallon. Ray gave us a full gallon!!! We needed all of them!!
