1316534,ftfarms,2011-06-09 17:08:00,444,We took 502 last week for the first time in 10 years and i was pleased how good of shape it was in.
1316585,Glenman12,2011-06-09 19:10:00,762,thanks for the update..we leave in just under 8 hours...
1315006,JohnnyV12,2011-06-06 10:12:00,9,Advantages or disadvantages taking either 71 or 502 route to Vermilion Bay. Heading up next week. Thanks for any opinions and recommendationsJohn V
1315025,Fishin Fun,2011-06-06 10:49:00,218,We used to take 502 all the time because it is shorter than 71. But 502 has fewer towns and is curvier than 71 in my opinion. So we always use 71 now. Mainly because of the fact that there are more towns if we have some sort of trouble.
1315029,v-bay gord,2011-06-06 10:56:00,3168,To Vermilion Bay Hwy 71 is 25 miles further....but has the advantage of towns and less curves. Also less wildlife hazards if driving at night. Nothing wrong with 502 as far as the road is concerned.
1315035,jiggster,2011-06-06 11:04:00,183,We take 71 because of the towns. If we need repair we can get it. We also like to stop at sporting good stores to look around.
1315044,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-06 11:23:00,725,502 for us. We want to make time. There is enough traffic that if something happened there is help around.
1315205,Jigger1,2011-06-06 17:58:00,234,"Besides what seems like a crazy speed limit of 80 km/h (in good weather conditions) which is 50 mph while driving through wilderness, 502 is a breathtaking drive. It serves as a great wind up on the way north and a wind down on the way south. Just watch out for O.P.P, they love to hand out tickets on this route, we found that out last year."
1315853,IA Nate,2011-06-08 07:48:00,12,Last year 502 was under construction and there were delays in two areas. Is that done now or have the construction zones just moved? Anyone traveled it yet this year?
1315993,johnboat,2011-06-08 12:42:00,2014,I was up to Gullrock last week. A few spots where they have flagmen. But it wasn't bad. And I think it was all just south of Red Lake.
1316334,JDP,2011-06-09 10:02:00,1457,"I was up and back on 502 May 28/June 4.The road is in possibly the best shape it has been in for 20+ years!I would take 502 unless you like the scenery, etc.on 71."
1316521,dynamite,2011-06-09 16:45:00,20,We started taking 71 as the drive is easier on the boat for towing and there are many areas with passing lanes if you travel fast. The road is straighter and wider. You also come back to the end of the line getting back into the states.
