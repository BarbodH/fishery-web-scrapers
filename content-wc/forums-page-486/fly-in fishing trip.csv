No flies, sometimes mosquitos in the evening.We take crawlers up with us. Have good luck with eyes with crawlers on yellow bucktail jigs. Don't do a ton of pike fishing but there are lots of them in the system.Feel free to email if you have more detailed questions.[email protected]"

He has always been very helpful and is a wealth of knowledge about AWO. He is also one heck of a nice guy. I believe his group is going to Melchett this year. Have a great trip.Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1301892,TIGHTLINER,2011-05-02 05:52:00,223,I talked by land line to one time dave one day last week his computer is down so it might take a few days for him to be back on wc to reply to this post. Dave and his brother have been very good and if any questions come up i am sure he can answer them for you. Dave will be coming out of melchett lake when i am going in so we will pass only for a short time however it seems like i have known him for years because of wc. He has fished several of awo lakes so iam sure he will fill you in on the lake you are going to.
1302471,oleJoe,2011-05-03 11:14:00,114,"Hi Hoppy, you will love it. We did an Aug trip a couple of years ago. Take some bug spray. The skeeters can get bad in the evening. The cabins are nice and every thing has always worked. Remi can put you on fish or if we have fished the lake we can help. Will be flying in in 24 days, and can't wait. What lake are you going to?. Any questions just drop me a pm. Enjoy"
