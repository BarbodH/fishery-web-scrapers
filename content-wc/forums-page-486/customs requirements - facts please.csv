1315735,JinxCanada,2011-06-07 20:42:00,1306,"TECHNICALLY....NOTo enter Canada any US Citizen, US Permanent Resident, Canadian Citizen and Canadian Permanent resident when entering from the USA to Canada does not actually require any identification at all according the IRPA...however, the wording is that you must satisfy the officer of your citizenship and residency and the easiest way to do that is with identification.The USA however says they need a passport or enhanced drivers licence...but this is not put into practice as many who do not have it still cross the border freely. I hope that helps.The easy answer is...have some proof of citizenship at the very least....passport being the optimal ID of course.BTW IRPA is freely available online if you would like to read it.
