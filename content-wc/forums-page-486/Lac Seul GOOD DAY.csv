1314971,worthsr,2011-06-06 08:41:00,52,"Hi Mike, I consider 50 walleyes per guy a good day on Lac Seul. We spend about half the day trophy hunting so when two guys reach triple digits on the Walleye clicker it's a good day. Only 12 more days until we reach the Black Bay outpost and make our first casts. It's a special place and I can't wait!"
1314978,Mike Kansas,2011-06-06 08:57:00,1463,"Scott, We will be there the week before you. I will try and not sore mouth all the fish. Would love to leave some for you. I will leave you a note on what areas and presentations were working for us. Might even leave you some ""HOT LURES"". You and your group have a safe trip. Good Luck, Mike"
1315033,worthsr,2011-06-06 11:02:00,52,"Mike, I really appreciate the advance scouting report; that will help get dialed in quicker. We had a last minute cancellation, so if they are really biting you can just stay an extra week! Thanks again and have a safe trip! Scott"
1315067,Mike Kansas,2011-06-06 12:15:00,1463,"Scott, Thanks for the offer of the extra week. But my arm will be so sore from hauling in fish during my week that I just don't think I would have the strength for back to back weeks. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. Besides that I will be back on Lac Seul at Lost Island Lodge the first week of July. Good Luck, Mike"
1315462,jswinter40,2011-06-07 09:52:00,127,"Mike,When will you be back from your Lost Island Trip. would like to hear a report as we are leaving July 9th. we like to spend the first day fishing on the south east side there. would love to hear how the fishing went there. thanks"
1315493,teddi,2011-06-07 11:10:00,349,gary or someone down at the dock will be able to help you out with where the fish are.
1315562,Mike Kansas,2011-06-07 13:22:00,1463,"Would love to give you a report but I wont be back until the 9th. But I will tell you that we have spent the last 6 years focused on fishing Grassy, Canoe and Bear Narrows and have had many awesome days. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1315563,jswinter40,2011-06-07 13:24:00,127,"thanks Mike,we generally fish near Bear narrows and know that area pretty well. I will have to take a look at grassy and canoe narrows as I have not fished those before. thanks again."
1315668,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-07 18:24:00,90,"Is Bear Narrows easy to get to from Lost Island, how far would it be? Thanks"
1315716,jswinter40,2011-06-07 19:53:00,127,lost island to BEAR NARROWS is about a 40 minute boat ride at 40 mph. not close but can be done. watch out for rocks that are not marked on the chip.
1314408,winston123,2011-06-03 20:34:00,13,I am happy if the weather is good and I get consistent action all day.
1314409,rather-be-fishin,2011-06-03 20:38:00,429,Tooooo many to count!!! That's a good day on Lac Seul and has been pretty much my experience on this awesome lake! 8 weeks and the countdown is on to go back to Lac Seul! RBF
1314411,Iowa Hawkeye,2011-06-03 20:44:00,90,A slow day at 30 fish each and average day 100 + and no one back home ever believes us
1314414,cody123,2011-06-03 20:50:00,16,fished Gullrock this opener-always keep a clicker-sometimes we forget but this year was a very aggressive bite but not the numbers. 3 guys- when we caught a wally we yelled click. End of the week it was just under 300. We have done better but it was still a good week. Big wallys 1-27in---2-26in several in the 22-24in plus a bonus 37in laker
1314421,davenathe,2011-06-03 21:10:00,113,"diddo, good weather usually means 50 to 100 fish. 6 more weeks to Mahkwa!!!!"
1314423,Jigger1,2011-06-03 21:15:00,234,"Great post, simple answer – there is no such thing as a bad day on Lac Seul … period! I do think your style of fishing or what you’re after determines your day. If you intend to just bend the rod, there are places you can find on LacSeul where the action is literally nonstop and you have a shot at 100+ fish per day and the occasional giant. However if you’re hog hunting your day is going to be uniquely different. I spend 95% of my time looking for giants and I’m in the never ending hunt to best my biggest which is a 29.25. Over the past 11 years I’ve averaged right at 12 (11.64 to be exact) walleyes over 18” per day, my best day is 34 over 18” which included 9 over 24” and that was in 2005. One of my worst afternoons was 2 over 18 but it was one of the best days ever as it’s the day I caught my 29.25 which was in 2003. We knew there were big fish on the spot and we made a decision to work it until we caught one and we did. So on a daily basis I’d say the total average is about 25-30 walleyes, of which 12 make the board (18 plus). I’ve never fished any place where you can consistently catch this many big walleyes. I’m at 170 over 24” and that’s averaging a mere 5 days of fishing/year over the last 11. One word sums it up … phenomenal. Only 23 days until I’m back on LacSeul."
1314488,guide7,2011-06-04 08:00:00,70,"Ok, now you have my interest. A 37"" laker!!! What part of the lake? We are headed up the 15th of June and I already can't sleep nights with ants in my pants. My best 'morning', about 3 hours, was 110 'eyes' for three guys. A high percentage at slot length or better. You work a winded shoreline and they just keep coming. I click my boat and that reminds me that I need to go buy a new clicker as mine wore out last year With 6 brothers and a bunch of nieces and nephews we many fond memories on Lac Seul."
1314712,orchard frank,2011-06-05 10:08:00,1900,"We used to go after them harder, gradually changed to longer shore lunches, then my darn wife would sometimes stretch out in the bow in the afternoon with a lifejacket pillow and paperback book. That kept the numbers down a little. Had days from fast-as-you-can action to exploring and trying new spots. Never had a clicker, but sort of kept track at times. Most memorable day was getting on a bite with big fish only, no small ones mixed in. Had zero lunch fish by 11 AM. Most over slot, some slot, only number I remember from that day was 9 fish from 27 to 29 3/4"". We never caught an actual measured 30""+ in 13 yrs of 2-3 weeks each year. Had a 75 fish pike day once, casting spinnerbaits to weed edges."
1314756,jkrawchu,2011-06-05 13:48:00,26,I can't speak on good days on Lac Seul...but I can't wait to contribute to this topic. 1 month and our group of 9 Lac Seul virgins will be at Evergreen Lodge for a weekend! The anticipation is killing us! Any suggestions at all would greatly help.Thanks
1314940,tv4fish,2011-06-06 07:20:00,2694,"I have posted this before but ""clickers"" are great to keep you ""honest"" We fish Lac Seul (slot limit) -- I bought 3 lap counters (the ones that have a button to push), mounted them in a row on a thin strip of metal about 12"" long, but Velcro on the back, the other part of Velcro on the side of the boat. It's mounted about ""midship"" on the side of the boat out of harm's way. Put labels above each counter, one is ""Under Slot"", one is ""In Slot"", and one is ""Over Slot"". Every time a walleye is caught, it is marked on the respective counter. At the end of each day - we know exactly how many we have caught."
1314282,Mike Kansas,2011-06-03 12:53:00,1463,Lots of Lac Seul fisherman here. What do you consider to be a good day on Lac Seul with Walleye. How many per man.
1314289,Steve Ediger,2011-06-03 13:19:00,97,"Mike,I have seen days when I was happy to get 4 or 5 but I think under normal conditions 25 - 30 per man in a 6-8 hour day would be a good day. I have had much better, and of course worse but any day I'm on Lac Seul is a GOOD DAY!"
1314290,jswinter40,2011-06-03 13:24:00,127,my worst day in 8 years was 28 eyes. Maybe I have been lucky?? My best day was over 120. I would be happy any day on LS but for sake of conversation I am very happy with over 40 per man per day.
1314291,jswinter40,2011-06-03 13:26:00,127,by day I mean 8-12 hours fishing. not there to sit in a cabin.
1314293,teddi,2011-06-03 13:28:00,349,"average day should be 50+ walleyes. some days a little less some days a lot more. i don,t count northerns."
1314311,tlars,2011-06-03 14:20:00,137,"Mike, my wife and I usually spend 8 or 9 hours on the lake. If we get 50 between the two of us, we're happy. It's just such a treat to fish Lac Seul. We've spent most of our time from Route Bay to Ear Falls."
1314340,Knoxabilly,2011-06-03 15:41:00,225,20+ a man for about 8hours. Of course one or two big fish can make any day a good one!
1314345,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-06-03 15:47:00,138,Have you guys ever actually counted your walleye? We always start out counting then lose track. We end up guesstimating 100 a piece . I'm thinking of buy one of those clicker/counters.
1314365,KTroller,2011-06-03 17:11:00,237,"Started cicking them a couple years back. An eye opener. It told me that I overestimated my numbers. 100+ for 3 guys is a darn good day. I used to click to count fish, now I click to bug one of my fishing buddies - he hates it!"
1314366,lcwhit,2011-06-03 17:12:00,104,"they're all good. some are better. 20-25 per man is fine in 7-8 hours. i do go there to set in the cabin and drink beer and play cards and cook and laugh and tease one another. but then again, i'm 64+ and have caught tons of fish in my life. i'm in no hurry. they will be there when i get there, or they won't. no big deal. that's why they call it vacation."
