1313650,elway12,2011-06-01 20:01:00,335,GREAT catch! Interested in knowing more about your lure having the ring worm attached? Do you always use something on your silver minnows? Color?

Also regarding color, I think it is more of an action thing than a color thing. My hope is the slower action will trigger them to strike when they might otherwise sit there."
