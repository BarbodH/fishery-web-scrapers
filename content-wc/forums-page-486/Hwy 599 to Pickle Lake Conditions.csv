1314017,plumberjoe,2011-06-02 16:55:00,54,Traveled back from Savant down 599 on Sat. They are cutting brush and putting up power poles along rode but no delays. Road is in good shape up as far as Savant I dont know about the rest up to Pickle.
1314244,Fishoil,2011-06-03 09:57:00,1277,Thanks for the report plumberjoe. Has anyone else been north of Savant Lake? We go to a camp about 60 miles beyond there. Last year they were replacing some culverts but there weren't any delays and those were the only areas we drove on gravel.

1315652,Ogoki,2011-06-07 17:39:00,291,"Came from Pickle Lake Saturday afternoon and turned off and went over thru Sioux Lookout . Only thing going on was they were clearing brush along the road . No hold ups at all. Could I ask where you will be fishing ? I leave again Thursday for a fly-in north of Armstrong .Pickle Lake was a 27 hour drive which we drove straight thru . Armstrong is 19 hours which is long enough . Our fishing on the fly-in out of Pickle Lake was comparable to fly-ins I have done out of Wawa and White River , but we did have thunderstorms and high winds off and on which certainly did not help ."
1315654,Fishoil,2011-06-07 17:45:00,1277,Thanks for the info. We leave Friday and are staying at North Albany Lodge on Pashkokogan. You can see the place from 599 if you're looking west as you cross the bridge and also from just south of it.
