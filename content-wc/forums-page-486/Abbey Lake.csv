1316298,Mike Borger,2011-06-09 08:41:00,1554,"That's the one Sam, good to hear!"
1315809,DennyDawg,2011-06-08 05:52:00,23,"Does anyone have any experience fishing this lake? Some of our plans have changed over the course of the last few weeks, and it looks like we may be going to this lake for our trip in July. If you have been there feel free to PM or reply to this thread.Thanks in advance!!"
1315814,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 06:16:00,1554,With Park's? If so I'm bringing my two young kids there in August. Can't help you but I sure would love to hear the lowdown from you when you get back!
1315815,tooski,2011-06-08 06:20:00,393,Solo- I thought you were doing the family trip to Abamasagi?
1315816,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 06:23:00,1554,We're doing that trip in July.Embarrassment of riches this season.
1315844,tooski,2011-06-08 07:31:00,393,"So Beteau in June, Abamasagi in July, Abbey Lake in August and Richter in Sept.?? Good Lord son, you are carrying the Canadian economy on your shoulders. You'll like Aba- just remember the bunks are like hammocks... You'll wake up thinking you slept in a funnell."
1315860,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 08:05:00,1554,"Actually I don't think I can make the Richter trip, not complaining though. The boys who fished Richter last week (first group ever) apparantly did really well. Did you see their report? There's not much doubt it's a walleye factory. Whoever's fishing it this year is in for a treat."
1315902,DennyDawg,2011-06-08 09:22:00,23,"Yes it will be with them...there was a little confusion about dates/months...but it's getting worked out. I'll let you know for sure how it goes, really looking forward...son's first trip...poor city boy!!DD"
1315905,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 09:27:00,1554,"Martin and Jennifer are great people and good hosts, I'm positive you guys will have a great trip."
1315931,tooski,2011-06-08 10:01:00,393,Absolutely read the report with pleasure. We will be fishing Richter in three days. Eddie asked us to switch from Beteau and we agreed. Might regret the chance to haul in some of the beauties that you showed in your report but we are walleye chasers at heart. The guys in Beteau had a chance to bring in two more friends so we did them a favor and moved to Richter.
1315953,Mike Borger,2011-06-08 10:35:00,1554,"3 days? Have a great trip bud, I doubt you'll regret the switch!"
