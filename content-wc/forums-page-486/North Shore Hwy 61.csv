1315896,Lovetofish,2011-06-08 09:13:00,458,How is 35W through Duluth and then 61 up to Pigeon River?
1315917,JJJMN,2011-06-08 09:41:00,153,"Lot's of construction in Duluth from the point coming down the hill to making the turn on 61. Expect a delay, much of it is one lane and narrow. From there to border roads were excellent. We traveled on Sat May 21st and had only a few contruction sites. Nothing compared to Duluth. Roads in Canada from Thunder bay to Savant Lake were in the best shape we have seen in years."
1315930,Lovetofish,2011-06-08 09:59:00,458,Thanks. Kinda what I expected to hear. And I agree about the roads from Pigeon River to Savant Lake. Hardly took my foot off the gas last year.
