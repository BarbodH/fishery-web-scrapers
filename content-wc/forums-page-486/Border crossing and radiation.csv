1315447,camp chef,2011-06-07 09:24:00,915,We had to drive thru the xray about 4 or 5 years ago coming home . It only took a minute and we were on our way
1315535,Guest,2011-06-07 12:11:00,0,"I think the truck and boat got x-rayed coming back into IF, just about every time for the past 5 years. It's a lot faster than removing the boat cover and opening the lid on the truck bed. So, it's pretty much routine for my setup and you only loose a couple minutes."
1315577,Fishoil,2011-06-07 14:07:00,1277,One of the vehicles with us last year got pulled over for radiation too. Turns out one of the guys had a stress test done a couple weeks before.
1315086,Ogoki,2011-06-06 12:55:00,291,"Came thru International Falls about 11 P.M. Saturday evening and our vehicle was approached by several border guards . Seems that radiation was detected as we drove up . The guard asked if anyone had recently had any medical procedures or had been in the hospital recently ,which we all stated no. They asked the four of us to exit the the truck and come inside and sit down , which we did. They pulled the truck out of the way and began searching the cargo with a small hand held device . They found a WW II compass in one guys shaving kit which that said was giving off radiation . They let us leave and advised him to buy a modern compass. After crossing the border many many times and I never heard of that one before ."
1315103,kansasity,2011-06-06 13:38:00,80,"Wow, that's pretty accurate! Glad they found out that's what it was I guess."
1315109,iowa jal,2011-06-06 13:51:00,5,"Wow ! How much radiation does a compass give off anyways ? Maybe it's time to re-calibrate their instruments, eh ? FISH ON !!jal"
1315130,UKBDM,2011-06-06 14:54:00,178,"It is the material (tritium?) that was used to illuminate the WWII era compass that set it off. You could shine your flashlight on it for a few minutes and it would stay illuminated all night. Gov't determined it was harzardous to your health at some point. Newer, modern compasses don't stay illuminated nearly as long.Gives me new found respect for their detection capability. Guess I won't get my pocket nuke across the border this year."
1315233,Guest,2011-06-06 19:09:00,0,"It was likely painted with Radium-226, the most common luminscing paint used on WW-2 instruments. A lot of workers got radiation sickness painting with this stuff in the factories, they would use their tongue to thin the tip of the brush after dipping it in the paint, so they could produce very fine lines for the instruments. Instrument factories didn't know about this problem until after the war; the sickness was often attributed to flu, viruses and even blood (lukemia) disorders; which are symptoms of radiation sickness. [Madam Curie eventually died from it.] Some European countries have banned hobby collection of WW2 instruments because of this. Special permits and sealed enclosures are even required for museum collections and routine montoring is conducted and documented. Allied, Japanese, German and Italian instruments were full of it. Radium-226 is the most common isotope of Radium, and it naturally decays to Radon gas with a half-life of ~1900 years. Unfortunately, most of the natural Radium used in WW2 was extracted from Uranium ore, so there are often traces of natural Uranium (U-235 and U-238) also in the paint. Uranium is a very toxic metal, but it is readily identified because it emits neutrons, gamma rays and beta particles of specific energy. Of course, any homeland security would be interested in all Uranium isotopes -- because they are fisible. I don't think I'd have a compass painted with it, because of the previous.... The faint blue glow of the paint isn't worth the risks, especially if the glass gets cracked."

1315247,Jimmy Jig,2011-06-06 19:41:00,1905,This isn't the first time this has happened. Fellow told me about the same story with the same WW 2 compass.........
1315251,Guest,2011-06-06 19:48:00,0,"campchick, That's one of the hazards in fishing with a retired mechanical and nuclear engineer. Most of the guys I fish with are/were also engineers of some type, and I admit we do have some interesting conversations while on the water. On the downside, you sometimes need to give us a ""reset pulse"" to get us back on topic."
1315373,3M TA3,2011-06-07 07:12:00,2846,I received some Nucliearr Medicine treatment (CAT Sccan) and was told not to leave the country for at least 7 days because I would set off the radiation detectors. Full body cavity search does not sound very nice.
1315421,tv4fish,2011-06-07 08:50:00,2694,"I sure hope they don't turn up the ""sensitivity"" too much on that tester - I wear an iluminating wrist watch - sure as heck hate to get searched because of THAT.Anybody else had to drive through their (US side) building to get Xrayed? Are they still doing that this year?"
