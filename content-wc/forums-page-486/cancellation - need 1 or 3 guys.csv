Yes fellas 8 incoming freshmen for Lane Kniffen and Co. this year. That is your future, embrace it or keep living in the past becasue that will be all you have to celebrate very soon."
1316157,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-08 20:48:00,76,Jack if your going to talk smack at least get your facts straight. I just went to the USC Scout site and looked at their recruiting class that is coming in this year - 30 recruits!!!!! This will be my last reply on this as we are on the canada forum and should be talking fishing. Go Bucks and have a great fishing year Jack. Will be headed up through the beautiful state of Michigan in a couple of weeks. Can't wait!!http://usc.scout.com/a.z?s=15&p=9&c=8&yr=2011
1316196,Jack77,2011-06-09 05:40:00,168,"30 players, 8 of which are on scholarship. Good luck fishing and enjoy your trip through our wonderful state. If you are coming up 23 or 94 you can swing into Ann Arbor and see how the boys in blue are doing."
1316267,pike50plus,2011-06-09 08:15:00,584,"That might be the last time they lead OSU, first qurter in the 70's when Lee Corso was the coach, they called a time out and took a team picture with scorebaord in background, priceless moment and funny too."
1313238,phishfearme,2011-05-31 20:27:00,1242,"well, as sometimes stuff happens, one of our guys had a major health problem and had to cancel out on us. our group just went from 4 to 3. we're doing a flyin to kearns lake with thousand lakes outposts (http://www.thousandlakesoutposts.com...Accommodations) and the cabin can fit many people so we could accept 3 guys - but one is preferable. flyin out of armstrong on the 25th and return july 5th. car transportation provided (share gas expenses) pretty much anywhere between PA and duluth. PM me if at all interested and i'll give all the details (the deposit and food kiity will be covered and the total remaining trip would come to about $1500 for 10 days in the bush). thanks, phish"

1315338,phishfearme,2011-06-07 05:35:00,1242,"thanks to the magic of this board, we were able to make contact with another canada fishing expert and he was able to join our group to replace our lost member. thanks to all who considered this and the value of this site once again shows through. phish"
1315350,tooski,2011-06-07 06:11:00,393,"What do you mean ""another"" fishing expert? Unless he is from Ohio."
1315703,phishfearme,2011-06-07 19:30:00,1242,"luckily, we were able to find someone from PA and were able to avoid ohioans - but i'm still looking forward to the upcoming ""special"" photo. phish"
1315774,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-06-07 22:15:00,138,Anyone know the definition of a buckeye? Go Hoosiers!!
1315859,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-08 08:05:00,76,"Yea, I have heard it before - ""a worthless nut"" I guess I could have been called worse. Good luck on the trip!!!!!!"
1315900,Jack77,2011-06-08 09:20:00,168,"I wouldn't call them worthless, I heard that some of their autographs are worth quite a bit!"
1315928,tooski,2011-06-08 09:56:00,393,"Yeah, if the NCAA suspends 15 or 20 more Buckeyes maybe Meeeechigan can beat them this year."
1315947,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-08 10:23:00,76,"Jack, those autographs are expensive but nearly as much as the ""Fab Five"" made!!!!!"
