1315869,Guest,2011-06-08 08:20:00,0,"Have fished all of the above. Legoff cabins may have burned to the ground last year in huge forset fires. Na accomadations at Lake Tesecau however an Cree outfitter did have a cabin on Tesecau that may or may not have burned. Theodat is under control of same outfitter. Able Kitchen Dreamcatcher Adventures. Waswanapi Quebec. OUr experience on the above three lakes fish have been plentiful. We generally bring home nothing under 20"" long. Pike range up tp 50"" long. Theodat is by far the heaviest fished of all three but has ""cabins"" available at reasonable rates that can be used to fish other lakes. All three can be driven to but you must be willing to pay the price in hard travel to get there. Will not be available after tomorrow on this email address (June (, 2011) until late August. We leave for Theodat Fri June 10, for our 8th trip up. bradj"

Can you give me any further info regarding the directions in off 113(landmarks for turns etc), possible camping sites and boat launching? Any further info would be appreciated. If possible an update on the road condition after your trip would be helpful. Where are you from? We have been further east to Comencho and surrounding destinations and are used to and prepared for rough travel.Paul S"
