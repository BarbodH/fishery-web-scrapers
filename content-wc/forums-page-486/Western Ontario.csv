1315771,Wolfwasp,2011-06-07 22:09:00,9,"Bushman, I can recommend this place: http://www.lakehousevacations.com/ou...73&preview=yesIt is a private (not commercial) semi-remote log cabin rental. Boat access. It is very similar to a fly-in without the cost. And the fishing is great. The next closest cabin is 10 miles. Walleye, Lakers, SMBass, Northern. 15,000 acre system and 2 portage lakes. I know the area well and it is a perfect location."
1316277,polaris-pete,2011-06-09 08:25:00,343,"This is ONE TRUE statement.Fished Bisco many, many Years ago and it was getting bad then.That and Ramsey USED to be excellent Lakes but now you have to go West to get suberb fishing. We went last Year for the 1st time and will never fish Eastern Ontario again. Long drive but well worth it."
1277526,weston,2011-03-03 10:11:00,18,"I have an opening for the first week of june on a fly-in lake for 700$ pp awesome cabin and a guide for 1st day. walleye, bass, lake trout and pike. Fly out of nestor falls area. www.tinkersplaces.com"
1281184,Guest,2011-03-11 17:47:00,0,I love fishing sunset country! I have done Lac Seul with great success as well as Lac de Milles Lac. I had the best success at Wawang for huge northerns! The possibilities in this area are endless!!
1283850,rjg,2011-03-18 12:34:00,13,"Bushman, take a look at PARADISECOVEMINAKI.COM It could be what you are looking for. Only $297.50 a week per person. Good walleye, muskie, northern and bass."
1283852,teddi,2011-03-18 12:50:00,349,somebody must be looking for a discount on their trip or maybe trying to drum up business. lots of posts pushing the same place.
1284134,rjg,2011-03-19 09:03:00,13,"just trying to help our fellow fishermen, at these prices, I don,t mind paying my way."
1284169,jiggster,2011-03-19 10:52:00,183,"After reading the price I decided to check out Paradise Cove. $297.00 is fine, except that does not include boat, motor, gas, bait, or tax. When comparing packages the price is about the same as allot of other resorts."
1284185,camp chef,2011-03-19 12:09:00,915,Paradise Cove is also less than remote. There are other resorts on the Winnipeg that are are alot more peaceful and relaxing
1284387,Robert Cardenas,2011-03-19 23:04:00,138,Try Bonny Bay Resort. www.bonnybay.com
1315146,Guest,2011-06-06 15:25:00,0,"I had the best luck on Wawang too! I ended up catching both a huge northern (43"" what a fight) and a 29.5"" walleye all in one trip! not to mention a tonne of eats and a great y boning demonstration from one of the owners! Totally awesome and the northerns tasted fantastic!"
1315163,guide7,2011-06-06 16:14:00,70,"Pipestone Lake is perhaps one the best scenic, good fishing lakes I have ever been on. An easy 45 minute drive from International Falls to the landing. Then a 40 minute boat ride to camp at Pipestone Lodge, the only lodge on this lake. I have no vested interest in this lake, I just thoroughly enjoy the waters there. Good fishing, bass, walleye, trout, muskie, northern. They can set you up for day portages into several small lakes that they keep boats on too. If you want just mass numbers of walleye then just go to Lac Seul. Guide7 (not really a guide"
1268268,bushman,2011-02-05 09:21:00,4,Yes I ment Grey Owl in Biscotasing. Great owners Buzz and Lisa. Blow my mind eh? Awesome I sure hope so!
1268345,northernbite,2011-02-05 14:03:00,1186,You can bet on it; I fish Ramsey next door because i just love that lake for some reason. NW Ontario is 10 times better. I know because I spend 2 weeks up there every year. Paul
1268357,jiggster,2011-02-05 14:44:00,183,"You might want to look at Manitou Falls camp on the English river. There is 25 miles of system to fish. They do have a out post about 12 miles down the river, fishing is great. There are many lakes of the system and no portages. The out post might fit your needs."
1268361,lenray,2011-02-05 15:16:00,467,"Hello Biter from Nord Not loking for anyone's honey water here, but anychance you can share some info. concerning what area a novice like myself should be looking. Guessing you are near Nakina. Thanks for any sharing you can provide."
1268374,fishman10,2011-02-05 16:37:00,226,"lost island lodge is a great place. we are treated great, nice accomadations and we only have a 14 footer and easily boat over 100 walleye per day within sight of the lodge."
1268604,wolverine fan,2011-02-06 14:42:00,71,Try sand lake outpost near minaki. We stayed a few years ago and it was beautiful and actually were fishing 50 yards from the dock.
1268606,fishforbrains,2011-02-06 14:52:00,12,Buena vista resort has 1 outpost cabin in the basil channel on lake of the woods . short drive to morson short boat ride to camp and great multi spices fishing check them out have never stayed there but looks dam good
1269409,bushman,2011-02-08 19:19:00,4,"Thank you for all of your great suggestions! There are some really good possibilities, my brother and friends will be looking them over. Thanks to you all!bushman"
1269497,Bill Krejca,2011-02-09 06:45:00,6107,"A number of folks from Michigan go to where we go in July, which is O'Sullivans Rainbow, near Nakina, on O'Sullivan Lake. Great walleye and very secluded, price is also right, owners are helpful and friendly. Bill"
1276898,JinxCanada,2011-03-01 22:38:00,1306,"I realize this is not norther ontario, but....if you can convince them to come here...they'd be very happy i'm sure!If you are looking for BIG walleye and lots of them...along with small mouth, steelhead etc...why wouldn't you just come to the Windsor area? Best fishing around in lake Erie (colchester/wheatley) pretty much anywhere....and 10lbs walleye are very common here....and up. I saw a 14lbs one caught last summer."
1267470,bushman,2011-02-02 15:02:00,4,"I need help finding a place to fish with 3 of my friends in Western Ontario. We would like a drive in camp, and a housekeeping plan as we prefer to eat on our own schedule. We will bring our own food, bait, and tackle. All we need is a clean quiet place to sleep, plenty of fish to catch, and a boat /w motor. Preferably a cabin by it's self in on a lake, would be nice.Why western Ontario? Some of us are driving from Montana, the rest from Michigan, and it seems like a good halfway point.Price? Preferably about $500 to $700 for a week, per person.Yes I have been a lurker on the website, but I am having a hard time finding ""Western Ontario"" camps as I don't know what towns/lakes I am looking for.Thanks,bushman"
1267482,Gary from Iowa,2011-02-02 15:25:00,74,"I think the part of ""Western Ontario"" is often referred to as Northwestern Ontario and is also known as Sunset Country. Try www.sunsetcountry.net for links to various outfitters. You can get a map that shows many camps and locations. I believe there are other outfitters that do not belong to Sunset Country. Also check allcanada dot com or dot ca. I think there are many resorts on Lake of the Woods, Eagle Lake or Rainy Lake that will meet your needs. Some examples I have read about are www.witchbay.com and Camp Narrows on Rainy Lake. There are so many other excellent choices in Ontario. If you give us your preferences for fish, size of water, etc., there ought be some good suggestions.Gary"
1267633,BenBeattie,2011-02-02 21:44:00,232,"Lac Seul is another top choice. Considered by many to be one of the best walleye lakes, period. Also has bass, pike and trophy muskie. Lots of places to stay and fish to catch."
1267645,Manitou,2011-02-02 22:22:00,125,"You gotta go to Lake of the Woods. At least once in your life.Kenora has all the amenities and you won't have to drive any further up into the bush.It'll be easy for your guys to meet there in the middle of the country.It's a long drive from Michigan though, you may want to go through Winnipeg, cross the border in Manitoba. For both parties coming from the east and west."
1267904,bushman,2011-02-03 17:52:00,4,"Water size, I'd say that we prefer a larger lake than a small one with lots of portages to lots of little lakes. We have been fishing at Grey Owl for quite a few years, and enjoy it a lot! Only issue is that meeting half way between Michigan and Montana...is NOT Grey Owl. Love the lake, love the owners, and the whole set up. We have done mostly House Keeping plan, bring our own food, and bait. If my brother hadn't moved to Montana we would still be going there. This summer is our last trip.I think I mentioned or that we would prefer less people than more, and our cabin more secluded than part of a group of cabins, as we like the solitude.Kind of fish...walleye, and whatever else is in the lake is fine. Of course lots HUGE walleye is more fun than anything else. However we are used to only getting 4-8 walleye in a week over 19"", and lots around 12-16"". We only eat what we need during the week, and bring one daily limit home to share with friends and family, otherwise we return all other fish we catch.Hope this helps with your questions.Thanks for all of your help, I look forward to checking out the websites you suggest!Sincerely,bushman"
1267912,Dog,2011-02-03 18:32:00,210,"You should look at Moore Bay Lodge on Lake of the woods. It's about a 10 mile boat ride from Kenora out to there camp, all housekeeping cabins w/showers, reasonable rates"
1267925,Gary from Iowa,2011-02-03 19:18:00,74,"Bushman,It appears that an outpost or a rental cabin may suit your needs. Some of the websites that I mentioned earlier allow you to filter the outfitters for some of the ciriteria you mentioned. Many of the resorts often have an outpost a few or many miles out. There are some rental cabins also available but I have no experience with them. In addition to the outposts and cabins, there are boat in resorts. My belief is if you go more than 10 miles from the launch to your resort, cabin or outpost the fishing is better than adjacent to the drive to resort. I have fished at Bow Narrows (nice Walleyes!) on Red Lake about a 20 mile trip in the outfitter's good sized boat-it is a resort with a number of cabins-wither American Plan or Housekeeping. It stands to reason, there are outposts available on Red lake. I know that Lac Seul has a number of outpost cabins on it as well as boat in resorts. See www.lacseuloutposts.com for fishing at Chamberlain Narrows a long boat in. Do a google search for Evergreen Lodge. It is one of several good drive to lodges on Lac Seul. As I said many of the Lac Seul Resorts offer an outpost.Gary"
1268009,mrwalleye5,2011-02-04 07:15:00,1922,"I'm going into Camp Narrows situated on the north arm of Rainy Lake, Ont this summer. Lots of options, You can take your own boat in seven miles to the lodge, or they will take you in, rent boats there, do your own thing as in housekeeping, cooking or American Package. This is my first time but have only good reviews from this board. http://www.campnarrows.ca/"
1268015,Mike Borger,2011-02-04 07:37:00,1554,Do you mean Grey Owl in Biscotasing?If you've been satisfied with that pretty much anywhere in N/W Ontario will blow your mind.
1268043,Mike Kansas,2011-02-04 09:13:00,1463,"Lac Seul is AWESOME....Take a look at Lost Island Lodge. Beautiful setting, great accomadations and boats and best of all the fishing is fabulous. Want more info email me. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
