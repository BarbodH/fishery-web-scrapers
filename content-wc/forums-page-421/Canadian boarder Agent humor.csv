1456971,Mark R,2012-07-03 05:47:00,1538,"Once going into Canada we declared our beer and then added we had a few singles in the cooler that we had not finished the night before. The female officer said, "" Oh roadies. I've been fishing before."" That cracked us up. Coming back once we had six guys in an Excursion, the smallest weighed in about 260# with a couple 300#ers. After they Xrayed the boat the officer comes up and says ""I thought you had the 95 offensive line in there."" We had Nebraska plates on the truck. He must have been a Husker fan. We still laugh about those two crossings."
1456973,steve.a,2012-07-03 05:48:00,274,"Maybe they need a website for themselves. It could be Borderguardscentral.com so they could tell stories about us. The classifieds could sell confiscated potatoes, radar detectors, Cuban cigars,handguns,etc."
1456986,go dart,2012-07-03 06:13:00,77,A few years back I crossed at int falls with my 64 yr old father. He was driving and when asked if he had any alchol he instantly got flustered and said no. Well we were in a hatchback and right on top was a case of beer. I don't know why he said no as we were still under what was allowed. He just kinda freeked a bit. We were ordered to pull over for an inspection. I opened up the vechicle and started handing things out and was told to touch nothing and stand away. They opened everything we owned and when they got to my dads medicine bag they had plenty of questions as he had a pill for evertthing imaginable. Our suitcases matched and they ended up checking his twice thinking they had checked both mine as well. They acted mad at us the whole time but I understand their concern but at the end of the day it was still an old man who was confused.
1457002,Stu,2012-07-03 06:42:00,472,"The last time I crossed we had two 14 year-old boys with us. As we approached the border, I turned around in the driver's seat and started scolding them for acting up. After they straightened up, I leaned on the steering wheel to turn back around and got tangled up in my seat belt. This caused me to lean on the horn for about 5 seconds. The border guard immediately came to attention and the look on my face must have said it all. As we pulled up, I gave a sheepish sorry and the boys leaned forward and called me their retarded uncle. Everybody in the booth started rolling and, after the mandatory questions, they waved us through. We stopped at the Rainy Lake One Stop to get our licenses, only to discover that several other groups in the store had witnessed the whole episode. I was the laughing stock of the group for the rest of the trip. I've always had better luck with the Canadian Guards than I have with the Americans."
1457119,labsrus,2012-07-03 10:36:00,557,Last year we had two trucks crossing the bridge and we had 4 guys in each truck and were pulling a small utility trailer We had many cases of beer and each guy picked up a bottle or another case at the duty free. We declared all the beer and what we had purchased at duty free. The border crossing guy asked us if we were planning to do any fishing this trip or were we just going to play cards and get drunk. We said both! He let us cross and did not need to stop and pay any extra duty
1457135,Bill Krejca,2012-07-03 11:02:00,6107,"Although it is great to hear some humour with the border crossing stories, new folks to crossing should not figure on their crossing to normally be of this nature. It has been a long time since I ran into a really discourteous official on either side, but they take their duties very seriously, so I try not to instigate the joking around scenario. It is easier to JOIN in the fun than to play the wise guy initiator and maybe have to air out the contents of one's vehicle. Almost all of the guards I've talked with in recent years have been pleasant and do their job. The U.S folks at Pigeon River even tell us""Welcome Back"", actually makes you feel kinda good. Bill Krejca"
1457167,cast_and_blast,2012-07-03 11:52:00,1098,"Coming back into the US a couple of years back, probably looked a little rough around the edges after a week of fishing with my buddies. All the normal questions, then this: Agent: ""Any fish?"" Me: ""No."" Agent: ""Any fillets?"" Me: ""No."" Agent: ""Any walleye, pike, crappie or other fish native to Canada?"" Me: ""No."" Agent (looking at my Suburban and Ranger): ""You mean to tell me that you came all the way to Canada, fished for a week with this rig and you're not bringing any fish home?"" Me: ""I never said we were good fisherman..."" Laughter, a welcome home and a wave through. Scott"
1457209,IaDave,2012-07-03 13:38:00,476,I came back this year and I had my 2 Golden Retreivers in the back seat of my truck. There were 2 boats in front of me and they both got stopped for inspection. I was the only other vehicle in line and of course I'm thinking I going to get pulled over. I pull up and the 2 dogs have their heads hanging out like they think we are at the McDonald's drive thru where they always get a treat. The officer looked at me and then saw the dogs and got a big smile on his face. On his counter was a big container of Old Roy dog treats and he asked me a couple of questions then came out and gave the dogs a treat. Talked and petted the dogs and said have a good trip. Maybe that is the trick- have a dog with you.
1457366,bigwalleye1,2012-07-03 19:55:00,2632,"We'd been in Canada hunting in the fall, and came home that fall after 9/11. Lots of questions and inspections at the border, and that in pre-passport days, but something I'll never forget was as the agent turned us loose, he said ""Welcome Home, Gentlemen."" On the eve of the 4th, and everything that means, I have to say looking back, that was the best border crossing I've ever experienced."
1457382,HeHooksHimself,2012-07-03 20:15:00,725,"Returning from a flyout from Armstrong, just me and my brother in law. Now, we know not to try to be funny with these guys, but sometimes I just can't seem to help myself. He was most of the way through the standard questions when he asked one we had heard many times and i always wanted to answer this way, and this time, well, i did. Like I said, sometimes I just can't help myself.Bringing back any fruits?I am driving and with my thumb I point to the passengers seat, ""Just him.""He laughed and said, ""Get going."""
1456761,Aaron-IN,2012-07-02 14:24:00,500,"This was truly a first for me in my 32 trips to Ontario. We crossed the border at Intl. Falls on Monday morning June 25th around 7:30 AM. Six guys, two different vehicles. I'm in the lead vehicle driving, we pull up, same questions as always, the last question being ""are the guys behind you in your group?"", I said yes and the agent said ""so, are they the smart ones or the dumb ones"" then cracked a smile. Of coarse I replied that they were the dumb ones, A-holes in fact and suggested they all get full body cavity searches. We get waved through and a couple of minutes later my cell phone rings, its one of the guys that was following us, they were all still laughing. I guess when they pulled up the border agent looked at them and said with a straight face.......""Hey A-holes"".....as they all started cracking up laughing.That was the first Canadian border agent I've seen with a hint of a sense of humor. Another great trip to Canada, no issues at the border either way."
1456766,Fishin Fun,2012-07-02 14:38:00,218,"Last year we pulled through the border and one of the guys in the truck with me is a retired firefighter. The agent goes through the group and asks us what we do for a living and when he gets to the retired guy and he tells the agent that he's a retired firefighter, the agent says ""Do those guys at the fire station know that you wear pink shirts?' (He had a light pink tshirt on from somewhere.) Caught us all off-guard. We all laughed and the agent just cracked a smile and sent us through. Don't get that too often from those agents."
1456768,wallydave,2012-07-02 14:41:00,2151,"With this kind of start to your trip north, how could you go wrong!! Maybe I should start crossing on Monday's!! Thanks for sharing a good laugh! How did the body cavity searches go?"
1456781,SinOrSwim,2012-07-02 15:23:00,1528,Hey A-holes!!! Bhahahahahahahahahahaha That is awesome!!!Things have definitely gotten better. Years ago we had 2 new guys. We were pulled over paying the duty on the beer. They went across the street to exchange some money without telling anybody. They agents asked where they were just about the time they were walking back. The agents freaked out and started talking about being arrested for border jumping or some crazy thing.
1456782,Jig Man,2012-07-02 15:24:00,95,"Went through on Thursday 6/21, 2 Fathers in the front seat and our 2 boys in the back. Usual questions follwed up with ""Are you two a couple?"" Got a good laugh and appreciated the lightheartedness. Returned on 12/1 at 1:30pm no wait and no hassels. In the past it always seems like the US Border is more of pain questins wise."
1456783,steve.a,2012-07-02 15:30:00,274,I have been going twice a year through International Falls for a pretty long time and I will say that I have noticed that the Canada side has been a lot more friendly than the US side over the last couple of years. In june the US agent had that look when we pulled up and had the temperment to match. He acted mad that we had everything in order and I wanted to tell him to put in a transfer to the Mexican border but didn't.
1456784,tooski,2012-07-02 15:32:00,393,"Many years back we hosted some surveyors in our motor home that just emerged from a few weeks in the woods. They inadvertently ( I hope) left the tails of their doobies in our ashtray. The border guys saw it and we were pulled in for interrogation. I said ""what are we here for?"" He said we found marijuana and we think you're dealing. I said "" Oh yeah, we are buying it for $60 a bag up here and selling it for $25 back in the states. We're making a killing""... That is when I got cavity searched....."
1456789,augiedog55,2012-07-02 15:49:00,4,In the many yrs i've crossed the boarder never have i met and agent with a since of humor.. Most were jerks
1456807,RapShad,2012-07-02 16:27:00,76,"We crossed a week and a half ago in Int. Falls and the Canadian agent just wanted to talk Packers football since our truck has a Packers licensed plate and my dad and I were both wearing Packers shirts. It's nice to be a cheesehead, even if you are transpanted!"
1456900,lassh,2012-07-02 20:23:00,553,"Its great to hear some fun news about border crossings. The officers tend to get bashed more often than not. Sometimes they deserve it, other times we're hearing only one side of the story. We should try not to stereotype all border agents just because of the behaviors of a few."
