Our best fish were 24 to 26 inches with a lot in the slot. Our party used various methods with good success. Pitching jigs on wind swept points 15 to 18 FOW, vertical jigging with a minnow tipped jig , lindy rigging and bottom bouncers. Our biggest fish came on a lindy rig with a spinner and a bottom bouncer with a spinner or slow death rig. The lindy rigs were baited with a crawler or minnow. The bottom bouncer were baited with Â½ of a crawler. Out best fishing was in 28 to 32 feet of water.<BTW> We did encounter the may fly hatch which should be over soon."

We ended up with one ""master angler"" (29"") and a lot in the 26""-28"" range. The first 3 days were the best (Sunday-Tuesday) Wednesday-Friday was slower. The weather was even NICE. I think it was the very first trip that we did not get rained on once."

1456743,RapShad,2012-07-02 13:38:00,76,"We also have to report similar info for SE Lac Seul. Caught a lot of 15""-22"", not many below 15"". Caught a lot of Bass in the 16-18 inch range we only caught one Bass below 14 inches. The Pike were not as cooperative, if you're going don't even bother casting the weed beds, they have to be in the deep water summer spots already."
