1456820,Guest,2012-07-02 16:56:00,0,"A group of six of us just returned from Lady Evelyn. We live in eastern PA , so lady evelyn is about as far as we can comfortably travel in a day. It's our second trip to Lady Evelyn and we had a great time. We had some great days on walleye and great accomodations and food. Our biggest wallaye was 27 inches but we don't measure the trip by the lenghth of the fish. Lady Evelyn is a beatiful lake that will keep us coming back for years to come. Good fishing to all."
1457670,fishincrazy,2012-07-04 13:07:00,1282,Ron what camp do you fish out of?I go to Garden Island Lodge.I have been going for the last 20 years and love it!FC
1352069,fishincrazy,2011-09-22 17:21:00,1282,We always use one alot of guy's don't but I like it cause I can fish big water and wind without flying down the lake.The only time we don't use the sock it ain't worth fishing at least for eye's.We normally fish Lesbo early am before breakfast with top water.Caught my biggest smallie ever there!FC

1351820,fishincrazy,2011-09-22 05:55:00,1282,"Man I can't wait till next July 28th,I'm so pumped!! I'm going with my brother,his best friend,and my 15 year old!It's been 5 years since we've gone.So I know guy's here go I was wondering has anything changed.We always fish 3 way's drift fishing with a drift sock.We normally pull a plain hook with split shot and a crawler(more weight or a bottom bouncer when it's blowin)OR a spinning rig with a bouncer.Trolling with hot n tots firetiger or crawdad color around the hump,or twin shoals.Jig fishin with curly tails,leeches,or crawlers especially in front of brothers and there by the sisters.I don't know why I've never been this excited this far out.I feel like a kid in a candy store!We also like to get up before breakfast and throw top water on some of the shoals and behind lesbo island for smallies,and the occasional pike!Well thanks for letting me tell somebody who might actually care.I've been telling my fishin buddies here but they don't get it.Thanks,FC"
1351830,Mike Borger,2011-09-22 06:20:00,1554,"Sounds like it's going to be a long winter for you. I hear you though, it's nice to have something to look forward to. Is there a story behind lesbo island?"
1351936,adempsey,2011-09-22 10:58:00,963,"I am sure you'll have a blast! Been hoping to get back to Lady Evelyn myself and might head back next year for our annual father/sons fishing trip.I doubt much has changed with respect to fishing since you were there last, although Garden Island changed ownership 4 years ago I believe. Joe is a great guy, so you'll have no issues with that.Cheers!"
1351970,fishincrazy,2011-09-22 12:18:00,1282,Apparently there is a group of same sex couples who camp there every year and you guessed it they're all women. FC
1351971,fishincrazy,2011-09-22 12:20:00,1282,I talked to Joe the other day I think one year he was on the island when we where there seems like a good guy!As long as Brian is on the dock I've got no worries!!!We're going 7/28 - 8/4 maybe we'll see you!FC
1351988,Mike Borger,2011-09-22 13:04:00,1554,I figured as much. On one of the back lakes I frequent near my camp we have a brokeback island. There's a really good story behind that one as well.
1351996,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-22 13:50:00,1460,Don't think I want to troll around either Lesbo or Brokebake Islands.
1352000,micropterus,2011-09-22 13:58:00,450,Joe runs a great camp. Fish are getting bigger.Michael runs a great kitchen. Staff are all great. My son and I will be there early July.
1352039,SteveJ715,2011-09-22 15:38:00,59,"Not to highjack your thread, but do you think it's worth it to buy/bring a drift sock or two, vs. just throwing out an anchor? I just learned about these the other day and am intrigued. I saw some for $25-$35 online, so it's not that spendy of an experiment. But in general I feel like we have a tendency to bring too much stuff up to Canada and some it we never use. Wondering if the drift sock fits in the ""vital"" category or the ""might go untouched for the week"" category. Thanks, have fun, and enjoy working Lesbo Island. Is there a channel nearby? Lifetime Channel, perhaps?- Steve"
1352067,fishincrazy,2011-09-22 17:18:00,1282,"We couldn't do early July we used to go the last week of August it was awesome at that time,but my boy has soccer then so I figured anytime at Garden Island was better then no time at garden Island!Man have I got a funny story about Norm from the way back machine!!Anybody who remembers Norm will totally crack up!FC"
