He says our main bait will be Lil Joe spinners tipped with a crawler. I was wondering about taking some backup baits such as Gulp leeches in case we ran out of crawlers. Would these leeches be worth taking or are there other soft baits I should take? How about shad raps, etc? Any ideas would be appreciated!"

Also caught fish on Gulp 4 inch minnows with a Scrounger Jig head. Lots of walleyes also caught on Beetle Spins."
1456485,Guest,2012-07-01 19:50:00,0,Thanks for the info. What size and color of beetle spin?

Bring up multiple colors and each fish with a different one til someone gets a bite. Also catching huge perch on crawlers and the spins."
