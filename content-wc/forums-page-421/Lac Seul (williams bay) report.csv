You would see them come in on the sonar .....reel up and they would nail it....WHAM! Just like ice fishing for Lakers...FUN!We did get some shallower at 14'FOW pitching jigs at rocks....but the best action was deep. Hope this helps.VIDEO LINK OF OUR MORNINGhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFg-MmKg4Y"
