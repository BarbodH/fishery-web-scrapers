Today I slept with my crankbait boxes in bed with me.I'm on a long stretch of 12 hour graveyard shifts.My Red Lake Digital Lac Seul maps showed up in the mail today.My bride is as excited as I am. We have been ""practice fishing"" on Lake Oahe,just to keep our hookset in good shape. Got the menu planned and non pershables bought.Even though I can walleye fish here in South Dakota 3 or 4 days a week I'm still all cranked up about 2 weeks on Lac Seul. Next year I'm going for a month!!! Bill,""I am one with my bottom bouncer"""
1456891,wallydave,2012-07-02 20:02:00,2151,"Bill I'm not sure which part of the wait is the worst! ? The last few days seem endless, then all of the sudden, its a mad scramble to get packed and on the road! I hope the weather settles down and the bite is on!!! Say hi to Andrea for me! The roads were in good shape a few weeks ago! Have a safe trip!"
1457232,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-03 14:57:00,1460,"Bill, So have you gotten married yet? If so, a big congrats from me!!!!!! Your excitement and enthusiasm for this upcoming trip to Goose Bay on Lac Seul is phenomenal. We have enjoyed having a small part in many aspects of your trip planning. As I remember, you are staying at the Rondezvous, (not at the Rainbow, Wallydave) Lol. We also had the giant pleasure of talking about your menu plans. What did you ever decide upon? Remember to make it a special time for her. You both will cherish this trip for the rest of your lives. Take lots of pictures and try to make each day more special than the last."
1457303,WalleyeWally28,2012-07-03 17:28:00,298,"Well said Pikeslayer.btmbncr - My Wife and I spent our honeymoon at Lac Seul in 1997. We have not missed a year since and last week celebrated our 15th anniversary and 20th trip to LS. Since we found each other somewhat late in life, it is truly special for us to still be able to return. Over the years we have made many memories that will be with us when we are no longer physically capable of making the trip. We enjoy the togetherness we experience while exploring new areas, watching the wide variety of wildlife, fishing a truly great fishery and seeing some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. I feel that I am truly lucky to have found someone who has the same passions as I do. We are booked again to go in Aug. and next June (16th anniversary).Good luck to you and your bride and I hope you make many good memories and enjoy the overall experience as much as we do."
1457323,wallydave,2012-07-03 18:21:00,2151,"Pike you will ""glad to know my bride of 32 years saw the Rainbow's website and she is fine with where we will staying next June 14th on our way to Goose Bay!!

1457608,wallydave,2012-07-04 10:24:00,2151,"Bill a couple years ago we were at Goose Bay the first week of July. It was warm and windy.The best spots for us were windy points, jigging and casting in the edges of clay stained waters. Pike and walleyes were lurking there! No seeums were a problem. Deep woods off seemed to work pretty well. The winds could kick up dome waves in open area's, but the upgrade boats can handle those pretty well.Have a good trip!!"
