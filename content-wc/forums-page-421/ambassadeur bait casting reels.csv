1456911,IndyTgrFan,2012-07-02 20:56:00,6,"I'm in the final phase of getting ready for my fishing trip with my 2 youngest boys (first trip to Canada). My father-in-law gave me a bunch of gear/tackle to use. couple of questions if you don't mind helping out:1. what does anyone think of using bait casting reels? There are 3 ambassadeur 5000c baitcasters and also a shimano bantam magnumlite 2000. He probably hasn't used any of this gear in 10+ years. i was going to have all of them re-spooled with new line. Would these be better for the walleye fishing or the pike fishing? I have enough reels to set up a separate reel for each of us for walleye and pike. I have 3 other ""spinning"" reels that I was going to set up as well. Thoughts? 2. In the tackle box he has a bunch of old jars of uncle josh's pork rind baits. These can't still be good can they? Should I just throw them out? Maybe they'll smell so bad it will attract fish..what do I know? Thanks!"
1456914,Manitou,2012-07-02 21:07:00,125,"For sure, especially trolling and casting with crankbaits.But not for casting bait...I use 5500 and 6500 models, and I call them level-wind reels."
1457033,wallydave,2012-07-03 07:42:00,2151,"I would suggest looking into some light rod and reel combos for jigging walleyes. Our group has some a couple of boys, perhaps something like an Ugly stick would be an option for the kids. For pike the baitcasters would work great, jigging walleyes calls for more ""feel"". I have an ultra lite ugly stick for jigging, plus a guide series light rod and reel combo I use for walleyes. Try a braided line, nothing like a big pike on light or ultra lite gear! Good luck, and congrats on taking your sons up North!!"

Some folks do have a bit of problems casting with this kind of reel. Should the casting produce more than a little trouble for them, several spinning outfits with different lb tests might be better.

1457164,wallydave,2012-07-03 11:49:00,2151,"Bait casters are different at first. I have a couple new baitcasters, I found some good you tube videos that help to understand how to use them."
1457452,Obabikon,2012-07-04 06:20:00,2370,"If purchasing an ambassador, make sure it has the easy button release. Not the little medal press on the side... those wear your thumbs out."
1457551,Cash,2012-07-04 09:00:00,73,I have 2 Ambassadeur bait cast reels. They're my favorites. They are superb reels when working properly and you have some experience with them. In the hands of some one unfamiliar with them they would be a nightmare.
