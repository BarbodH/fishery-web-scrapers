1455319,corvette1,2012-06-28 10:29:00,243,we are going in by boat
1457352,nwont,2012-07-03 19:17:00,16,"Hey all,I live in Nakina, and would say you probably won't have much problem with locals coming into Abby. But you may see natives from the closest reserve. Someone said locals don't go in because it is too hard to get into. That couldn't be further from the truth, unless the water gets really low. I used to go there quite often because it was easy and the fishing was pretty good. Haven't been there in years, mostly because there are many better lakes to fish within an easy drive/boat ride. But also because you allways have to worry that Howard is going to slash your tires or smash your windows out.Living in Nakina, I would never pay to fly to Abby. There are many places I would fly to, and many more that you can drive and boat to and rent, or bring your own gear. In most of the places you can drive and boat to, you will still usually have the lake to yourself."
1457406,Mike Borger,2012-07-03 21:47:00,1554,Tons of people access Abamasagi via the river. It certainly no secret and I've never heard of any vandalism either.As far as better walleye lakes that are easier to access I'd love to see it. I've fished a lot of walleye lakes and Abamasagi is pretty hard to beat. You really don't like Howard do you? LOL!
1457739,nwont,2012-07-04 15:52:00,16,"As long as you are renting from him, you have nothing to worry about. Otherwise, watch out. Ask Chad or Denis from TLO, heck ask the OPP. If you haven't heard of any vandalism, you haven't asked a local. Lakes I would pay to fly to: Ogoki, Kaganagiami, Esnagami, Brace, Percy, Ara, Washi, Makokibatan. Just off the top of my headLakes I can easily go to with equal fishing: Esnagami, O'Sullivan, Makoki, Stewart, Chipman, Stone, Marshall(a bit of a walk though) and a handfull of small lakes that would only be day trips, probably not what most of you are looking for."
1457765,Mike Borger,2012-07-04 17:32:00,1554,"I'll defer to your experience as far as the vandalism goes, assuming of course that you have no agenda.It's disturbing to hear that...Not trying to be contrary but I've flown into almost all the lakes you mentioned over the years and at least for me Aba was better.Esnagami and O'Sullivan I know how to access. Are you saying Makoki, Stewart, Chipman and Stone can be accessed without a walk or just Marshall?Stone isn't easy to access as far as I know and has outpost camps on it as well. Just my opinion, but these types of conversations are best saved for pm's."
1455112,corvette1,2012-06-27 19:30:00,243,my group of 6 are headed up july 14-21 can't wait
1455127,Mike Borger,2012-06-27 19:50:00,1554,"I'm excited for you Doug, you'll have a great trip!"
1455134,Dialed In,2012-06-27 20:03:00,15,"Sorry Doug I'm not excited for you, I wish it was my group going back in. Just kidding have a great trip and lets all start bugging Howard about that grill..."
1455136,Mike Borger,2012-06-27 20:07:00,1554,Maybe if we all gang up on him he'll put better bunks and mattresses in LOL!
1455138,Dialed In,2012-06-27 20:12:00,15,"As far as the grill, it works pretty good but is in bad shape. Just watch out when you light it, also if it were me I would just pick up a new grate and take that in, the grill top is no longer attached and you can put the new grate right over the grill. We also use the grill to cook all of our meals on thats why I'm making such a big deal out if it."
1455221,corvette1,2012-06-28 06:03:00,243,thanks solo when i get a break i will call you.we also do all the cooking on the grill
1455257,gmattbruin,2012-06-28 08:10:00,174,"we did wht we cld to salvage the grill, cleaned it up,makeshift handle for the lid. The grill actually works ok,but howard really shld replace. hope your trip goes well. Does your group go in by boat or maybe the water is down 2 much?"
1455259,gmattbruin,2012-06-28 08:12:00,174,"solo, wht trips are planned for this year?...no Eddies? I spoke with him as he was on his way up to his camp and maybe in a couple years,we will have to save for tht one. If you were curiuos abt the early issue feel free to PM me and I can certainly explain,just didnt want to do it here and have it misconstrued."
1455270,Mike Borger,2012-06-28 09:02:00,1554,"No Eddies this year.I fished Dusey Lake north of Nakina Jun 2-9, great trip! I posted a report on that one last week.I'm flying into Ribes lake with Park's out of Hawk Junction on July 8th for a week.Then in late August I'm flying in and spending 12 days paddling the Sutton river from its headwaters, through Polar Bear Provincial Park to Hudsons Bay.PM sent."
1455279,JayM5209,2012-06-28 09:24:00,1050,Prior to jumping into the Beaver make sure the sat. phone you're given works.
1453988,Mike Borger,2012-06-25 17:39:00,1554,"Agreed the bbq was junk. Had to crouch down and light it from underneath , it was literally falling apart.Too bad that hasn't been replaced yet.My guess is Howard doesn't take too well to preaching, that may have been the problem LOL!"
1454019,unclepaully,2012-06-25 18:46:00,112,"I have a little portable propane bbq, knowing what you now know would you recommend I bring it with or can you get by with whats up there. My dad and I usually grill almost all of our dinners...brats, burgers, chicken, steaks, and this year we will add bacon wrapped walleye to the list.Any other issues I should know about before our trip. Good tips about the gas treatment and things like that....cheap and easy fixes.What about the condition of the mattresses. Solo I noticed you brought your own cot last year. My dad has back problems and I was thinking of bringing a pretty stout air mattress I have."
1454031,Mike Borger,2012-06-25 19:17:00,1554,"Actually I didn't bring a cot, it was there.A couple of nights it was super hot so I dragged that over to the open window to catch a bit more breeze.The mattresses were okay, but the slats on the bunks offered no support, VERY uncomfortable at least for me.A piece of plywood cut to fit the bunk to help support the mattress would help a lot imo.Don't sweat the small stuff though you'll be fine. Howards camp is very comfortable, even moreso now that the hand pump is working again and he's got a new fridge.One thing I brought with me last year that was a godsend was a propane powered Zodi portable camp shower. (the on demand heater is propane powered, the shower pump is electric)It's normally battery powered, but I wired a plug to the pump so I could run an extension cord over to the generator.Had it set up in the fish cleaning side of the storage shed and it worked fantastically. The room was lit, had screen windows for ventilation, no bugs could get in and it was private.Just set a couple of 5 gal pails of water up on the counter and ran the shower pump in them.It was an awesome luxury at the end of a long day on the water.The other thing I brought was a 10' X 10' screen house for sitting outside in the evening.The mosquitos were pretty bad and it made things sooo much more enjoyable.They're not expensive and only weight about 12lb's or so.One thing we were missing BIG TIME last year was chairs. There were no chairs in either cabin beyond a couple of broken down uncomfortable wooden ones. There's only an oversized picnic table.I was wishing we'd have brought a couple of folding camp chairs along, it would have made things perfect."
1454042,unclepaully,2012-06-25 19:30:00,112,"Thanks for the tips. What's funny is I just purchased a Zodi portable shower unit for this trip. I haven't told my dad or uncle yet. Every time we get together and talk about our upcoming trip, I always hear, ""this is going to be great except I wish the camp had a hot shower"" I just sit back and smile. They're going to love it."
1454062,Mike Borger,2012-06-25 19:58:00,1554,"HAHA! Great minds think alike.One thing I can tell you, the crappy little battery operated pump that comes with the Zodi shower is useless, virtually no water pressure.I ended up using a 700GPH bilge pump and it was like night and day.If the water wasn't quite hot enough 'cause it was running through the heater too fast, I'd just stick the shower head into the bucket with the pump and let the water recirculate and heat up. It heated up VERY fast and with the bilge pump the water pressure was great!If you're still using a battery rather than wiring it to the genny bring a small motorcycle battery and a battery charger.Cheers"
1454171,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 05:12:00,174,"there are some chairs in both cabins to use,not great but there fine. mattresses were not the greatest but not sure how many are going on your trip but there are lots to double up on and yes something under them would be good. We improvised and got the bbq working ok,and used it quite abit. Also the shoreline at the cottage is a beach,GREAT for having a bath on the right day. Like I said before this outfit is bare bones,but the essentials are there,good cabins,boats are 16ft,motors are 15hp, you are in a great spot being on the arm of the lake, nice beach,always seems there is a breeze coming up tht arm onto shore...which means no bugs on shore, hand pump,no lugging water, and most important if you have all tht meat to bbq, an amazing fridge&freezer. The little things fall in the catagory of ""you get wht you pay for"". Also we found very important, when we were dropped off,howard and the youny lad Kyle forgot to check the generator,propane,etc. That can happen but they returned RIGHT AWAY,nxt day and took care of things. That to me is huge. Oh ya, if you havent this lake before, the fishing is AMAZING!"
1454178,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 05:45:00,174,"Oh ya, almost forgot with operation of the generator there is a toaster for brkfst! lol Generater also gives you the ability to chrg thgs...ipods,shavers,etc"
1454188,mroyle,2012-06-26 06:39:00,74,Anybody have any experience with Twin Lakes Cabin#3. We're heading there July 21. Can't wait....have heard lots of good things about the fishing. Any good maps available on-line or hotspots you wanna share. Thanks.
1454216,gmattbruin,2012-06-26 07:44:00,174,"TLO Cabin3 is a great cabin in a really good spot. Stayed there 2x,also stayed in cabin1 up in the main lake across from islands and this june stayed in Osullivans camp down from TLO#3 as the recent post have mentioned. TLO have icehouses,which are very beneficial,good 14 boats with 9.9hp motors. The arm of the lake is a great spot with lots of options and you are safe from the main lake when the winds pickup...as mentioned before aba can get nasty. Chad will prob have a map or the cabin will,or go online TLO has a few. There shld be no problems being with TLO in #3"
1454311,mroyle,2012-06-26 10:55:00,74,"Thanks Gmattbruin, much appreciated."
1449405,unclepaully,2012-06-14 15:53:00,112,Our Abamasagi trip starts Aug 11th...can't wait.
1453303,studbro,2012-06-24 08:22:00,1,"Wondering how the fishing water levels were, and if you had any hot jigs or lures. My group is heading up the 7th of July with TLO"
1453437,gmattbruin,2012-06-24 15:02:00,174,"Our Aba jun09-jun16th trip...abit late,sorry.Stayed with Howard&Elsie(Osullivans) camp in the upper arm.Great camp,boats,motors,etc. New propane fridge tht wrkd amazingly well...also a small chest freezer(generator) tht was a blessing as well... the lrg chest freezer is not wrkg. Thy most def need a new bbq thg.The camp ran out of propane on day2,also a generator problem same day,but a quick call and both were replaced nxt day right away. In the transfer of grps thgs got overlooked,but #@$%# happens and thy took care of it when it did.Fishing was bang on for 1st 2-3 days with steady nice weather. water temps 68F. Then a front moved in and chgd thgs alot. Not a ton of rain and no days where you got soaked,but temps dropped,and days of winds, but not the typical walleye chop tht produces. Water temps drop to 60-62F, and this system stayed until fri night-sat morn. Also water levels were up,compared to prev yrs, then drop at least 1ft over the wk. All of this made the great fish at Aba abit of wrk. None of the typical spots produced and you had to get creative,but ultimately thy cld be had.1 problem tht if anyone cld confirm I wld appreciate. We boated into camp,which was great way to go,but were to fly out on Sat16th,7am as a grp was flyin. With clear skies,nice day a delay is always expected...not 130pm thg! We hav been told tht Greg(Nakina Air) had a pilot&dockhand quit tht morn, which wld hav put him behind. We know tht the TLO camps did their chgover at 6am(we knew the grp in camp3), then the other TLO camps were done but then we sat till 130. Obviously just want a confirmation as to the story why...it wld be apprec.This as always was a great trip at abamasagi,but it goes to show, even a fish factory like this can be affected by weather,water levels,etc.hope some of this helps"
1453448,Guest,2012-06-24 15:40:00,0,Thanks for the info cant wait to get up there.
1453467,gmattbruin,2012-06-24 16:47:00,174,TLO or Osullivans?
1453480,unclepaully,2012-06-24 17:28:00,112,gmatt-What's the hp on the motors at Howards place? Also does he provide boat safety kits or do we have to bring them in? I was talking with someone the other day who said they're required even on camp boats???
1453497,gmattbruin,2012-06-24 18:10:00,174,"15hp mercs,ran ok. If you bring an additive it might help. Also there were no safety kits. Good seats. There fuel is premixed in 45gal drums which workout great. Maybe call and push for a better bbq"
1453514,Mike Borger,2012-06-24 18:46:00,1554,"When I was there last year I ran Seafoam through both of the motors we used and the difference was like night and day.They trolled better and idled without bogging down.VERY glad to hear Howard has a new fridge, the old one was small and useless!How about the hand pump at the sink? Is it working? Last year when I was there it wasn't.Finally how did you call Howard to let him know about the propane? I'm guessing you guys rented a sat phone?In any case I'm glad to hear your trip went well!"
1453523,gmattbruin,2012-06-24 19:11:00,174,"Hand pump at the sink was great, you just had to prime by pour cup or dwn inside handle to prime. Sat phone was used,yes. 2bad the lrg freezer is not in use because it wld be a life saver,but the new fridge&small chest freezer work very well.This a bare bones setup, but its what we like and expect. the cost is amazing for the fish you get which is fantastic...thts why we r there!"
1453967,Dialed In,2012-06-25 16:47:00,15,"The BBQ grill is a joke, first thing we preached to Howard about when we got back to the base. Thats when he told me he was putting in a new fridge and an electric pump. He said he was going to add the grill to his list.Also, the fish cooker hose was dry rotted so bad that we had to pull a bush repair job on it (electrical tape and duct tape will fix anything).The motors ran great for us, must have been the plugs they installed in them this spring, the seafoam is a great idea, i will have to put that one on my check list."
1445302,gmattbruin,2012-06-05 16:43:00,174,"I thk you might hav said earlier,but did you flyin and out or do the boat dwn river? We hav always flown but are givin the boat trip a try...no weight issues,hopefully no weather issues, bit cheaper."
1445307,Dialed In,2012-06-05 17:07:00,15,"We flew in and out, how many do you have in your group? Weight is no issue with this outfitter. We had over 130lbs per guy, but we only had four plus seven cases of blue light, 8 liters of crown royal, 2 cases of coke, 3 cases of water.We eat real good, steaks, prime rib, pork chops, Lamb chops. Every one cooks a meal every other day and we all try to outdo the other guy. These meals have become a great part of our trip. We eat fish every other day plus a couple of shore lunches. The great thing about this camp is Howards grandson comes out every couple of days and will bring in more ice, gas for boats, gas for generator and anything else you need. We tipped him the first day 30.00 bucks and he was johnny on the spot with anything we needed."
1448879,unclepaully,2012-06-13 13:36:00,112,Dialed In or anyone else who's been there. What is the clarity of Abamasagi. Is it tea-stained? I'm going to start picking up a few more jigs & lures and I am trying to decide on colors.
1448880,Mike Borger,2012-06-13 13:40:00,1554,Overall quite clear imo with just a hint of tannin stain.If you havn't seen this here's my trip report from last summer:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...1&#entry607728
1448891,Dialed In,2012-06-13 14:23:00,15,"I agree with Solopaddler, water is tannin stained but not too bad.Check out Solo's report its well worth taking a look at, he does a great job breaking down the camp."
1448908,tooski,2012-06-13 15:02:00,393,"Dialed In, Heading back to Aba in Sept and not clear on your previous post. Why would he bring in ice, is there no longer a chest freezer there? And the gas was in 50 gallon drums . Has that changed?"
1449105,Dialed In,2012-06-14 04:46:00,15,"TooskiHaving ice in fish camp is like having dry socks in hunt camp, you can never have enough...We flew in Friday and Howard told us that the ice chest was gong to be delivered Saturday or Sunday, so we took in plenty off ice. We also like mixed drinks with lots of ice. When we go in with 8 guys we will charter a second plane for ice, beer and booze. You are correct, the ice chest could get you by for the week if you had to, there still is a 55 gallon drum for gas. We were the first group in this year and it took a couple of trips too fill it, we also burn through a tank per boat a day we like to troll and see new parts of the lake and river each day."
1449338,unclepaully,2012-06-14 13:46:00,112,"I'm curious how much boat traffic the lake sees. I know there are 3 camps from TLO, but I've also read online that locals have a way to access it?Would you guys say its safe to keep gear in the boats overnight?"
1449347,tooski,2012-06-14 14:06:00,393,I've never seen all three camps from TLO occupied at the same time. Actually have not seen any locals on the lake either. Doesn't mean it doesn't occur though as I have talked with several people re: the locals. You are way down the narrows though. I wouldn't even worry about leaving things in the boat.
1449396,Dialed In,2012-06-14 15:36:00,15,"All camps were full when we were thier opening week, but for the most part we still felt pretty much like we did not not see that many boats. I would be supprised if you ran into one, too hard for them to get to this lake.You can leave whatever you want in the boat and not think twice about it, you are very secluded at this camp and far enough away from anybody.When are you going in? Let me know if Howard installed the new full fridge and electric pump yet."
1439804,gmattbruin,2012-05-24 05:21:00,174,Just wondering if anyone has any reports inregards to fish & water levels?
1443441,gmattbruin,2012-06-01 06:32:00,174,somebody must have some info with TLO hav 3 cabins and Osullivans with 1. goin in Jun 09...just curious
1443651,unclepaully,2012-06-01 16:06:00,112,you might just be the first WC guy going in this year... give us a full report when you get back. I'll be there Aug 11 with O'sullivans.
1443887,gmattbruin,2012-06-02 11:29:00,174,Quite possible. Our group has fished this lake several times with TLO...this year goin in with Osullivans...I will update. Have you used Osullivans before?
1443911,unclepaully,2012-06-02 12:45:00,112,"Nope, first time with O'sullivans."
1444814,Dialed In,2012-06-04 18:34:00,15,"Flew in on the 18th with a four man crew to Osullivans Aba Lake Camp.Weather was pretty good, we did have a little snow one day but for the most part had good weather. The lake levels were not bad, alot better than the last couple of years. The camp was in good shape, sorry to tell you guys we did scrape up the fresh paint on the boats dragging full stringers of walleyes along.We are trollers for the most part and did not spend anytime jigging. The narrows contained some fish but the hot fishing came around Pup Island and along the East shore from Pup Island toward Islands in front of Twin lakes camps. Biggest walleye 26"" and the biggest Pike 39"".We left a detailed map on the wall of all the hot spots - Hope its still there, good luck and have a great trip."
1444848,unclepaully,2012-06-04 19:57:00,112,Thanks for the report and the map(hopefully its still there). Maybe guys will just add to it. Sounds like you had pretty good fishing. Curious to know if you tried for any lakers? I've read about them on TLO website but haven't really seen any pictures or stories of guys catching any on Aba. Also any fish in the immediate vicinity of the cabin? Just wondering if there are any places close to the cabin on days when the wind really kicks up.
1444955,Dialed In,2012-06-05 05:09:00,15,"No we did not try for Lakers, this time of year they are just starting to head for the deeper holes in the narrows near the cabin, we were hoping to pick one up when we were trolling but never did.You can fish for them in the 100 plus foot hole near the cabin, there is a big hole in front of the narrow opening where the lake continues around the cabin. If you want to get out of the wind head for this opening (LOOK OUT FOR ROCKS) once you get past the 20 feet of rocks it will open up. Saw a moose and calf in there. fishing was ok in there.A real good spot close to the cabin was at the huge rock face wall between the cabin and where the lake opens up, (cnat miss it) we killed them there. If you troll they liked alot of action black and gold hot n tots were the ticket, 40 feet back."
1445166,gmattbruin,2012-06-05 11:43:00,174,"I appreciate the report. There are so many great options on abamasagi. We will certainly add to the map or leave another behind. Tht shows a pattern to the fishing. Those main lake islands are always amazing. In 2010 we fished mostly thru the narrows up to the other parts of the arm and tht produced the most and biggest fish. Trolling the south shore from TLO cabin3 to the 2 rivers at evening till dark was also amazing. 5days,cant wait!"
1445222,Dialed In,2012-06-05 13:34:00,15,"gmattbruin,No problem on the report, but like you said there are alot of options on the lake and you can find fish everwhere, if our map is still there you can see we caught fish in several areas. Been fishing Ontario all over since 1975 many times on the Attawaspiskat and Albany Rivers, but for your money its hard to beat Ara, Meta and Aba lakes. We been to all of them, some twice and have never been disapointed.Hope your trip is a great and safe one, I only have 349 days till my next one. Until then I will have to settle for Lake Erie Walleye and Steelhead."
