1456493,Fishin Fun,2012-07-01 19:57:00,218,JK... How was the trip up and back? Did you run into some detours and/or closed roads in northern Minn from the floods?
1456494,jkwildhunting,2012-07-01 20:12:00,361,"Ya, We have stayed at 5 Lakes ever since we have gone up, I am hooked on that place. Lodge owners are WONDERFUL.It was smooth sailing all way up. Some road work north of Cloquet I believe but we did not have any closures going up or coming home. Took our normal route... 35 to 33 to 53 up to I-fall then we took 11 over to 71 in Canada over on 17 on up to Red Lake. Only issue we had is we saw more deer in Canada then we did anything else. One moose on the way home. The route we took in Canada was fine. Not much road work other way is a lil faster but we found out it is easier taking 71 home to ""get in"" line at the border.We had maybe a 5 min wait each way going into Canada and Coming back Into the US."
1456502,2746,2012-07-01 20:25:00,3206,Speaking of checking the boat.....be as certain as you can about the tire condition (spare also) and bearings. Counted 5 boats on the way back with flats and 1 with bearings out. They had left it sitting by the side of the road presumably to get repairs and on Saturday that may not be easy. Ruins a trip in a hurry.
1456506,Fishin Fun,2012-07-01 20:34:00,218,"I put new tires and bearings in 2 years ago. I checked both again today. We are bringing up 2 boats and the other guy was debating on if he should buy new tires or not on a boat that he's owned for 2 years and was used at the time. I told him to buy the tires and do the bearings. He is doing that this week. I drive I-35 every day and I've seen many times boats sitting on the side of the road and I think ""Boy would that suck!"" I ever put a new tire on my spare and bring an extra set of bearings/seal with. Just in case."
1456526,tackleman,2012-07-01 21:53:00,444,"good report Joe, thanks for the information on where the fish are. I'm sorry i missed seeing you, but i had a chance to go guiding for a week and when i got home i went right into a bunch of day shifts at work, kinda got worn out and had to have power naps when i got home from work and didn't go out fishing,I was over at 5 lakes the other day talking to Ian and he told me of your success on the trip. now with this report i know where to go when i get finished these night shifts i'm on."
1456543,jkwildhunting,2012-07-02 05:01:00,361,"I was keeping my eye out for you and waiting to see if you were going to roll into the docks for bait and figured you were working long/late hours since I did not see ya.We were doing good all week but that last day we put all the pieces together in the puzzle or something because I do not remember seeing that many big fish caught caught in just half day. Alot of 22-26"" fish caught in that area.Maybe we will run into each other in September!"
1456572,NWwalleye,2012-07-02 06:34:00,223,How is the water level ?
1456647,2746,2012-07-02 09:19:00,3206,I would say normal to a bit higher than normal. Enough to get into Ranger without problems and I've seen that difficult to do some years.
1456890,NWwalleye,2012-07-02 20:02:00,223,Thanks for the info ...
1456366,jkwildhunting,2012-07-01 14:20:00,361,"Another AWESOME trip in the books. Fishing was great alot of 14-17"" fish with quite a few over 20"".Only had one bad day of weather which was Thursday that gave us 4-6ft rollers but other than that it was warm and slight winds.Met some guys off WalleyeCentral in camp and had a total blast. We all worked together and shared spots and the last day we were all on big fish. I dont think I have been in a spot with 2-3 other boats that were catching the size of fish as we all were. That ended the trip VERY nicely and already have a trip booked that same week with the same guys and am excited as ever to join them on there trip again. Thank you guys for helping us out and giving us some heads up on spots to try that is what it is all about.Now to the fish Pictures......"
1456367,jkwildhunting,2012-07-01 14:24:00,361,"Riggin and Jiggin was probably a tie for tech on putting fish in the boat.We did catch some on Spinners but I switched over to a plain hook with crawlers and minnows and we nailed em. Last day was a jig bite.2- 26.5""1- 25.5""3- 24-24.5""1-23""and probably close to dozen or more from 20-22""I know some of the other guys we met had alot of good fish from 23-27.75"" which that was the big fish I think for the week in camp."
1456379,Larry Mac,2012-07-01 15:00:00,530,"Hi jkwildhunting, Thank you for the great report and beautiful pictures. I too have made a met some wonderful friends on WC. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1456380,Pezman38,2012-07-01 15:00:00,3196,Great trip man thanks for sharing.
1456385,jkwildhunting,2012-07-01 15:10:00,361,"Pez- When do you go up to Gull Rock this year?We are headed back sometime in September for our fall trip. Nice to see everything back to normal this year the dam is back up and running water is flowing...I am using that as our ""excuse"" for slow year last seasonBTW Mayflies were just ending when we were up there. Still a few floating around but I bet the next week or 2 will just be outstanding!!!"
1456423,Pezman38,2012-07-01 17:48:00,3196,I leave August 3rd for a week.

Thank you guys for helping us out and giving us some heads up on spots to try that is what it is all aboutThanks for the report and great pictures. Was trying to see if I could tell where you were from the background in the pics but couldn't. we were there there last week as well but, do to a mix up, stayed at golden hook. a great camp and well located for where we like to fish. Had a couple of 13 year olds with us so didn't spend the hours on the water like normal but did well. Thursday's wind beat us up as well and by afternoon had us looking for quite water. (due to the wind we found a number of new locations off islands on the south central portion of the lake we hadn't fished before) Lots of numbers however and Friday produced a number of 20 - 26"" fish in nearly all locations we tried including fishermans point, the boot, stephens and a place we call shore lunch point. All in all another good week on Gullrock."
1456457,jkwildhunting,2012-07-01 19:03:00,361,"We ran all way from Stephenson Point to Clay Banks to Flat to Boot all way down to ranger bay.We had our best luck down by Fisherman Point. I have a few hidden treasures down there. Friday we were off the point from boot/fisherman point. Everyone has there own name for that spot. The beach, tree in lake point, eagle nest point ect ect.Finding structure was the main key. I had our boat anchored on a 10ft drop off. Front of boat was danling in 21-23' with snags rear was in 31-33' and they were roaming the area. Hate to say this but best presentation with the jig was put rod in the rod holder with just enough line reeled in to make it ""tight"" sit back and wait....see rod doubled over FISH ON. I caught onto that tip right away and fished like that rest of the morning.....think that is why i was doing better then rest of guys in the boat who know..."
1456482,2746,2012-07-01 19:42:00,3206,"Fisherman's point is an interesting place to fish and takes some time with the sonar to figure out. Lots of places like you describe where the depth changes dramatically that holds fish as well as what appears to be a narrow channel or creek that comes into the point from the east. Full of snags, as much of the flat on the point is, but holds fish if you can keep from hanging up. We did not venture up to Ranger but some in camp were and found lots of eaters and a couple spots that held some slotters they reported. We'll make a fall trip as well but have been going to Lac Seul as a change for fall. Less crowded we find and also excellent fishing. Golden hook was a pleasant surprise for us although we have used 5 lakes for nearlly 15 years, most of them with Bud and Malinda."
1456491,Fishin Fun,2012-07-01 19:55:00,218,"Sounds great. Thanks for the info. Heading up to Gullrock the first week in August. August 3rd I believe. Have a newbie with this year so I hope the fishing is just as good as when you were there. I can't wait. I started checking the boat over (again) this weekend. Put new line on a couple poles, checked out the jig selection in the tackle box, went out to Cabelas, etc... Half the fun is getting ready to go!"
