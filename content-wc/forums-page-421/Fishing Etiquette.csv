1456245,Davey two fish,2012-07-01 08:00:00,6,"I guess I really tweaked a few nerves!! All I was saying that while fishing a huge body of water like Lac Seul, I don't appreciate guys moving in ontop of me and pushing us around. I understand that maybe they caught fish there in the past. But even if it was yesterday just give it up and let us enjoy our Canadian wilderness experience alone. You pay all that money travel hundreds of miles to avoid this and it happens. Guess we need to accept or try somewhere else. I will never do this to someone else. Even when fishing with another boat and my buddy calls me in because they are on fish, I don't like getting too close. Respect others space in all outdoor endeavors and be safe."

1456424,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-01 17:53:00,235,"If it's a friend inviting us over and it's slow everywhere else, I will suck up my dignity and go catch some fish with them. Some spots can accommodate multiple boats and still provide a good bounty for all. I trust that if they are calling us over it's because there's a large school of fish and not some ""micro-spot within a spot"" where fish are tightly stacked in one small area. I actually enjoy the social aspect of multiple boats (in your trip party) working a spot and having success. I like time apart though, too."
1456443,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-01 18:28:00,1460,"We have a spot that we fish that is tight, secluded from wind and has no current. Often as we are a tad bit less angry at the fish, we join all 4 boats by throwing legs over in the next boat going into what we call armada formation. In armada formation, motors are off except mine on the occasion I need to reposition. We just verticle jig and maybe pass around a cigar or share some beverage. Kinda amazes me how well we do when we fish this way. This year my brother caught a pike that was netted 4 boats over. Good stuff! Few years ago, we had this old timer friend of my departed dad with us and we went into armada formation and ole Bill had to fish out of the little V between the bows of the boats. It was pretty obvious that he was not very happy but we would tell him that he's gonna catch a biggin any minute. Sure enough, he catches his pb 25""er which made for a great story. My group is even pictured this way on my outfitters brochure."
1456529,eyemike,2012-07-01 22:44:00,233,My dad and I were pulling spinners on a river system that had very little boat traffic. We are catching eyes on every pass between a set of islands. My dad was running the motor. The boat was a beat up 14 ft. flatbottom that is ideal for pulling up streams and beaver dams. This really nice lund pulls up right between the 2 islands and drops anchor. As we get close to the boat my dad says to the 2 guys in the boat that they are in our trolling pattern. One of them said to ---- off. My dad took that old flat and ran right into the side of their boat ricochets off the side and scrapes all the way down the boat. As I am saying holy s--t my dad picks up an oar and say you are in our trolling pattern move your ------- boat. They did a whole lot of cussing while they pulled anchor and left. Seen the boat several times during the week and they didn't venture near us at all. The old flat had a big chunk of red paint right on the corner. I was always trying to tell my dad about anger management but he always did it his way.
1456548,troutaholic,2012-07-02 05:23:00,827,"We were on a hot fish bite all week several years ago on the Mississippi River. We would locate the hot spot on the upriver side of the wing dam, then, throw a marker above the spot so we would troll between the wingdam and the marker. A large Lund with three(3) fishermen figured out our format and would race to find us on the river. It was almost impossible to have several boats on some of the smaller dams, so we would grab the marker and head off to somewhere else. The last day of our vacation, my dad decided to head down river to several hot wing dams. We went to a very high wing dam where the polish depth finder(skeg) would find the top of the dam. Dad put that marker down river from the wing dam.....I couldn't figure this out. It wasn't the time of year to fish behind the wind dam. No later than 15 minutes, I see that Lund heading right towards the marker!!!! I said to dad, ""They are going smack the dam the way they are going. ' Dad says, ""I guess it is time to go pick up the marker."" As we were pulling away from the wing dam, I heard the solid thunk of a polish depth finder finding the bottom. I looked back and saw the three(3) anglers getting up off the floor!!! Sure wished I knew the end of the story on their end........on our side, we caught some very nice 'eyes and several decent catfish that day. The Lund was gone when we headed back upriver!!"

1455418,RapShad,2012-06-28 13:59:00,76,"It's funny this topic is going because my father and I experienced an event similar to this today, while fishing for Lakers on Big Vermillion near Sioux Lookout. There is one well-known spot in Big V near the boat launch so it is really common to see someone on it. When we arrived there were two boats on the spot one clearly had a guide, we moved on to a nearby spot and waited patiently for our crack at it. All the while there was a boat from a state that starts with M and ends in innestoa trolling around in between and around these boats at very close distances (it reminded me of a buzzard flying of a carcass). The trolling boat after having no luck moved on then the two other boats moved as well. Having had very good luck a few days before we moved on to the spot to try our hand, threw a marker out as a visual reference and a few minutes later the buzzard came back and started his routine. It was very windy today so it was difficult to stay around our marker with the electric motor but we did a good job of establishing a 100'x100' perimeter around our marker. Every time we would drift out of this perimeter we would notice the buzzard try and swoop in on it. Our retaliation was to catch 5 lakers all above 25 inches in the span of about 2 hours and not give up our spot. By the way we watched them the whole time and they did not catch a thing"
1455430,Curryale,2012-06-28 14:32:00,50,When people pull up next to me on a remote or semi-remote lake that is full of fish it used to boil my blood. It still does to a certain degree - especially on a really big lake with a million different spots - but now most of the time I just feel sorry for those people. They clearly do not know how to fish. Every lake in this thread is full of fish. Just go to a point on main lake drop off. Its not hard. But these people who pull up right next to you are so clueless that they have to follow other people around the lake. They also lack any sense of manners which I would imagine would make their lives difficult outside of a boat too.
1455513,bigwalleye1,2012-06-28 18:21:00,2632,"just don't understand the faster boat=smaller wake concept. Try running thru Loon Rapids on Lac Seul and there's invariably some knucklehead fishing in the middle of the channel. I start approaching heading in or out, and someone wants to wave me down. Mind you I'm running 40+ with an 1800 ProV and a 175. He wants me to slow down and willing to scream obscenities at me..., OK, but you be careful what you wish for...Drop throttle and settle that battleship into the water and you've got a lot of wake moving your way in a hurry. Silly folks. Throttle up again, give 'em a wave, and we're off. I don't try to do it intentionally, but if you're gonna play in the middle of the freeway, don't be surprised that there's traffic there...."

For about 5 miles this guy was right on my tail.When he passed I noticed the license from Hinsdale, Illinois. After getting off 502 I headed to Dryden and stopped at Tim Hortons.I noticed the same car that was on my butt was parked. As I turned to park, this guygot into that car. If I was'nt on a fun fishing trip I would have taughtthat guy from Hinsdale a few lessons. Sorry for the rant."
1455563,drew59,2012-06-28 20:35:00,87,Tony Dean did an underwater study ten years ago or so that showed fish react more to a change in noise rather than noise itself. His conclusion was that going by full speed caused less disturbance. I follow this rule and wish others did too. I also agree the wake is smaller when someone zips by.
1455689,IA Nate,2012-06-29 09:17:00,12,"As was stated stated earlier--it is the exception and not the rule.... But I echo the frustration with some of those ""exceptions."" There are a couple places on Lac Seul that I think somebody called ""community holes"" and I think that is true. The Big Sand Banks on McKenzie Bay, is one of those places that you should just expect to see other boats. But that's a petty big area and when the Banks are ""on"" there are enough fish for everybody. However if you get there and drop anchor in the middle of 8-9 boats who are all trolling, expect to get some flack. My pet peeve is guys who drop anchor and fish in very narrow channels. We stay at Onaway Lodge at the far end of Scout Bay. Fisherman's Cove is also on the far end of Scout Bay. Last year at the end of the day somebody was anchored right in the narrowest channel to get back to camp. The channel isn't that big. It's bordered by stumps. Then you had an idiot parked in the middle of it for all the boats from two camps to go around."
1455720,Manitou,2012-06-29 11:01:00,125,"My pet peeve is boaters who drive between me and my weedline I'm obviously casting towards when there's tons of open water on my backside. And I'm talking about short casting distances here. So much for fishing that weedline for a while until the fish settle down.I really feel encroached when others fishing ""my"" spots. I've enjoyed them with relatively good secrecy over the decades but the huge rise in the popularity of fishing means I now have to share these spots.I saw three young guys land a 4' musky about 200 yds from my camp last week. Oh well..."
1455826,zman8701,2012-06-29 14:59:00,100,"For those of us that fish all year long on both hard and soft water, this topic always seem to pop up thru out the season. I've concluded that some people just don't get it; and when it happens to me, I tell them in a curtious way and move on to a different spot. Hopefully I make them feel stupid and they get the message. If they don't, then you can't fix stupid"
1455297,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-28 09:57:00,235,"Great point. And you can be sure that many times a boat who drives by you was thinking about the spot you were on but decided to go elsewhere to give you space. Our mind only remembers the jerks, though. I believe the majority of fishermen are considerate. A question for you who fish in Canada --- do you experience jerks like this every year you go up to Canada, or is it the exception and not the rule?"
1455300,tlars,2012-06-28 10:02:00,137,"In our experience, it's clearly the exception."

One year we were fishing a point that we had been fishing since we started going to that lake 20 years ago. As we are trolling a guy motors up and says that he had planned on fishing that point and us 'out-siders' should leave since he owns a cabin on the lake. I asked how long he had owned the cabin and he replied 3 years. I laughed and said that I had been fishing this lake well before you built your cabin and that you should run-along now to a different spot. His mouth dropped and he motored away. I laugh to this day seeing the look on his face.
1455387,Mark R,2012-06-28 12:58:00,1538,question about going past boats anchored or trolling. The spot is Steamboat Narrows on Lac Seul. Lets say there are 5 to 10 boats fishing it and if you know where it is you know what I mean. When you go thru to you do so wide open or slow to a no wake speed? If you were one of the 5 to 10 boats already there would you be angry if another boat or two spotted and gave it a try?
1455392,Obabikon,2012-06-28 13:08:00,2370,"Personally, if I'm fishing a ""high traffic area"" (like our Rabbit Point here on LOTW's)... it's my fault I'm there. Go by me at full speed so it's the smallest wake possible. The only thing you SHOULD NOT do is slow down to 1/3rd throttle or 1/2 throttle.... that makes the biggest wake possible."

Boating safety EH!! When someone puts anothers life at risk for any reason that's going to far!! Be Safe out there!"

I can say I have experienced this a few times, I always look to whos in the other boat, if theres young kids on board, Ill move over and let them fish where I am working it. Its not the childeren fault the old man moved in and is not courteous, and who doenst want a kid to catch some fish, I am sure I can understand the dads frustations he might be having, no need to give him any lip service. but if its a boat full of adults and they only found the spot because I was there, Ill ask them if I am out of sync for the mille lacs lake shuffle, that usualy gives me some room, never met anyone who was real jerk on the water.......yet."

1455179,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-27 22:00:00,235,I hear about this problem but have been lucky not to experience it out on the water. I'm sure it's only a matter of time. I have certainly had times where I was excited to fish a specific hole only to find someone right on it. I just move along and find a different spot. It's worse on a small stream wading as someone may be right on the only good pool over a long stretch. Just gotta cut with your losses.
1455182,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-27 22:21:00,429,"We too fish Lac Seul for many years. First several years that we went we always hired a guide (who is the resort owner). He made it very clear to us that the ""Canada Etiquette"" is that if there is a boat on a spot, you DO NOT STOP, move on and fine another open spot! I totally agree with this and honor it when fishing in Canada. Not like here in MN, it is quite the opposite.....everyone goes and fishes where the boats are! There is this one point that always had boats on it in MacKenzie Bay & we have always wanted to try that spot out, but it was never open. Last year the point was open so we headed there and started to troll the area. Shortly after another boat pulled up and asked me if I minded if he dropped an anchor right where we were trolling. I told him YES I DO MIND & that I had 3 other boats in my group that would be joining me. I felt like a JERK saying no to him anchoring there, but I do give him credit for having the courtesy & asking me first! Another technique that we use is that our group of 3-4 boats usually fish together. So if a boat tries to move in on our spot, then we team up by trolling blocking any pattern they are trying to do. Works pretty good and they finally get the message! Also, if they pull up really close have used the casting next to their boat approach too. Funny that people should mention the people from ""Chicago"".....We were fishing out in the middle of a big bay in Bay of Islands. This camp boat, which was from the same resort we were staying at, was coming across the bay at full speed with a guy riding in the front bow seat & heading straight for us. (we knew that these guys were from Chicago). It made us nervous because we thought they were going to hit us! We were thinking AYKM??? In the middle of this huge open bay they have to come right at us??? They came within 15 yards of us, still going full speed and waving as they went buy! UNREAL!!! Another thing we learned this last year....is that the resort we go to has a ""Catch & Release"" board where people post the big fish that they caught and released (Walleye over 26"" and Northern over 36"")... We made the mistake and posted after our first day which was very successful in catching 26"", 27 1/2"", 28 1/4"" and a whopping 32"" walleye and a 41"" Northern on the board. We thought it was weird that these same 3 boats from our camp kept showing up where our group was fishing all week long and tried moving in on us.......then realized that they were following us knowing we were having good success.....so now won't post until the END of the last day we are there! Still can't complain because the fishing on Lac Seul is sooooo AWESOME and I have LOTS of SPOTS to FISH! Only ONE more month to go to our 10 year of fishing LAC SEUL!"
1455207,fishincrazy,2012-06-28 05:12:00,1282,I always carry a good assortment of weighted trebble hooks size 10/0 we use em to snag bunker on the surf.You throw a grappel hook at somebody they move!This is even worse in NJ where i surf fish last Fall we where fishing on a sand bar wading and guy's where actually casting from the beach over our heads.I took out my knife and cut their lines.It really po'ed one guy he was calling me out so I went in.I guess when your on a sand bar 75 feet away you look smaller cause when I got to the beach to oblidge he was gone. On another bar up the beach one of my buddies got hooked by a plug trebble buried in his but he was hauled backwards into the trough.We had the guy who did this arrested for assult.People really are #!!$&#$!!!There's pleanty of water out there with fish in it there is no excuse at all for people to do this!FC
1455219,Bitinlight,2012-06-28 05:55:00,95,"Lac Seul is a huge body of water with thousands of spots. Of course, there are what I call ""community spots"" where guides fish and everybody else seems to know about. They have probably been told about them from somebody else and sent there to ""try it"". If there is nobody on one of these, sometimes I fish it, and if somebody shows up, I just move on. But what really makes me angry is when I am fishing a secluded spot that I kind of found on my own and somebody sees me catch a fish or two as they are motoring by and then invades the spot. If I am going to fish a spot, I want to be able to maneuver the boat the way I want, and if the school slides over 15 yards, I want to be able to freely move with it. And I really don't want company. If I want to fish right next to somebody, I might just as well stay in Wisconsin. If it happens it's frustrating, but I just move to the next spot."
1455263,btmbncr,2012-06-28 08:27:00,492,I agree with V Bay Gord.This stuff just happens when your fishing.If it happens to me I just let it go or go find somemore fish away from the crowd.If you think having one boat show up like that is bad just come to Lake Oahe the weekend of the 4th of July and dip a net in the water.Bill

We had a marker out to orient us to the spot on the spot. Nature called for both of us so we went to a nearby small island. We were gone about 15 minutes. Upon returning, 3 boats, all with MN tags were on the spot. We quietly moved near the marker and started fishing. We got apologies from all three boats and they moved on.

When a boat of four dudes out wandering around came right in on us. They backtrolled around us then got right on our break line and tried to push us off our spot. Really fellas? Big lake, lots of water and they crowd you out. What's up with that? I can fish Minnesota and Wisconsin and put up with it or really accept it.

I look back and there's one of their jigs lassoed around one of the carry handles on the back of the transom.I immediately fired up the motor and gunned it, spooled him in about 10 seconds.Karma can be a b!tch sometimes."

I might be that the area is mainly musky fisherman and we tend to move around to alot of spots. The one thing that has never happened is raised a fish on a spot and go back later and have someone on that spot. BOB"
