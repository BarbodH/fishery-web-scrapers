They also have ""The Bullpit Steakhouse"" on the premises where you can grill your own steak indoors or they will grill it for you. This is included with the american plan. I have taken my wife up for our anniversary and had them put flowers and a nice bottle of wine in the cabin for our arrival. My wife isn't much of a fisherman, we took a guide for the week and she really enjoyed it. Contact Cheryl at 807-227-5262 and she will take care of you."
1456272,Painter1,2012-07-01 10:01:00,26,"I want to take my wife for a ""top shelf"" Canadian fishing vacation that would include excellent fishing for Smallmouth, Walleye and Northern, with a guide, in a comfortable boat, the American plan and a nice room. The availability of a one day fly-out to a ""specialty' lake would be a bonus. Please let me know if you know of such a place. Thanks"
