1457138,Bitinlight,2012-07-03 11:06:00,95,I believe it is 1 liter or a case of beer per guy. 1.75 makes you .75 over.
1457141,SinOrSwim,2012-07-03 11:09:00,1528,"You can take as much as you want. They will charge you a tax/duty on whatever you are over. But, I think it is 1 liter of hard liquor or 1 case of beer."
1457154,Medds1,2012-07-03 11:30:00,18,You can take 1 liter or 1 case across per person 19 or older without paying duty. You can take up to 4 additional per person but you will need to stop andpay the duty on it. Duty still figures out to be cheaper then buying more after you cross the border. Just be honest and tell them what you have and they are pretty nice about it. They give you your slip and you walk in and pay and away you go.
