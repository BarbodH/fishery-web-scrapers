1441905,UKBDM,2012-05-29 07:25:00,178,The camp we stay at had a note on their website recommending outdoor card purchases/renewals and license purchases be made online before arrival in camp. He said we can still get them in camp but his satellite connection was intermittent on occasion and could delay getting on the water. Don't think the handwritten/paper license is an option any more.I bought my 8 day license and an outdoors card and 8 day license for my son online last week. Only problem I had was the site accepting my debit card the first try. I resubmitted immediately and it went thru no problem. Checked my account to verify this am.
1441934,Bigstorm,2012-05-29 08:03:00,799,"Here's a question, my Outdoors card is expired and I havent gotten around to renewing yet and my trip is in 18 days. I have the paperwork to renew online and am planning on doing so today, but I highly doubt my new card would arrive from Canada prior to my trip. I assume as long as I have done the renewal and printed out the paper copy of the license and have that with my while I'm fishing up there, I should be legal I think (right?)This logic makes sense to me as a first timer to Canada just gets his paper copy at the bait shop (or where ever he purchases his license) and gets that card a month or 2 later in the mail."
1441941,packpro,2012-05-29 08:16:00,695,As long as you you have the printed copy with you on water your OK. I just did the same thing. Had to make sure I put the printed copy somewhere that I wouldn't forget it. Sounds like reprints could be more involved.
1443223,joeman79,2012-05-31 13:56:00,417,"I just renewed and bought 8 day license, maybe took 2 minutes max. Super easy. One less thing to have to do when we cross the border. Half hour more fishin time!!"
1457279,hogridnfool,2012-07-03 16:31:00,349,"I wasn't aware of this regulation, ""You must carry your Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag, or your fishing licence tag and temporary Outdoors Card, on your person whenever you are fishing. If a Conservation Officer asks to see your Outdoors Card, the law states you must show it."" I always left the Outdoors Card back in camp."
1457326,wallydave,2012-07-03 18:29:00,2151,I have a wallet from Dutchies that I keep my license and outdoors card in its always in my tackle box. So far never been checked but the tackle box is the first thing in the boat and the last thing out.
1376088,LyleK,2011-12-24 12:36:00,248,"It appears as if it is best to wait until after the first of the year. The card is good for 3 years (including the year it was purchased). So, if you purchase prior to Jan 1 you will lose a year on the length of time the card is good for."
1376124,Bill Krejca,2011-12-24 16:07:00,6107,"Thanks, Lyle! Bill"
1376855,new hips,2011-12-28 08:57:00,498,"Has anybody bought a 8 day license on line, for a specific week, or is only the annual license available on line ?"
1376940,lassh,2011-12-28 14:41:00,553,Non resident 8 day licenses are available on line.
1377082,wallydave,2011-12-29 07:31:00,2151,"Heres the link eh!http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_164832.htmlLast year the phone line worked great, now we can take care of this any time of day!"
1377234,stumcfar,2011-12-29 16:00:00,451,"Can you order just the Outdoors Card without buying a license? It seems that you have to buy a license at the same time, or what am I doing wrong?"
1377386,Bluff,2011-12-30 08:07:00,152,I ordered only the Outdoors Card - seemed to go through without a problem. I plan to purchase a license as needed through the outfitter.
1441076,bushead11,2012-05-26 20:22:00,151,what do you guys do if your lodge/package includes your license? Just want to make sure I am not double paying...
1441090,Glenman12,2012-05-26 21:19:00,762,youre still responsible for your outdoor card...have to have befor the licnese is issued..............
1441151,bushead11,2012-05-27 07:24:00,151,Got it! As long as I take my Outdoors Card (exp end of '12) to the lodge they will issue me my license included in my outpost package correct?
1375288,JDP,2011-12-21 10:56:00,1457,"In past years you could purchase your Non-Resident Ontario Fishing License via the phone using a credit card. Many people, myself included, did so and the system worked fine.This year (2012) is the first year that you can purchase Non-Res Ontario Fishing Licenses online. So in the near future perhaps we will get feedback for the online system!P.S. The state of Minnesota has an on-line system for fishing licenses and it works GREAT. You can download your license to a PDF and print additional copies as needed."
1375290,Glenman12,2011-12-21 11:12:00,762,is the site set up for US residents to get their license?...I know about this time last year you still couldnt..
1375292,jkonop,2011-12-21 11:18:00,544,Buying it online will clean up the hassle of on the the places where you by the license and they only want cash and would not take a Credit Card. This is great...
1375301,wallydave,2011-12-21 12:04:00,2151,"Last year before the on-line option was available, we called the 800 number, buying both the license and outdoors card took about 10 min. Both came in the mail with two weeks. On less thing to worry about on the road North!"
1375307,tv4fish,2011-12-21 12:16:00,2694,"Just a ""word to the wise"" here -- DO check the expiration date on your Outdoor card -- they sent me the notice also -- mine doesn't expire until the end of 2012. Just sayin'"
1375330,bergsh,2011-12-21 13:40:00,183,That is my sentiments exactly. No more waiting for the bait shop to open in the morning. Just hit the lake and start fishing.
1375428,drlee,2011-12-21 19:01:00,409,"Just purchased my new 3 year outdoor card and sport annual fishing license today. Easy, except that I had to ignore the website they mailed to me and explore further. Kept getting ""page not available"" on the website indicated on the letter I received. You can actually print out a card/license on your home computer. You need your card # plus DOB and zip code. Then go to check out and enter a credit card number. There is NO charge for the service! They will soon realize that in the STATES you ALWAYS have to pay at least a $10 fee for the ""convenience"" of doing your purchase on line (which of course saves them money!). Sorry, but I cannot recall exactly what site I ended up finding that allowed my purchase...I tossed the info before I realized others would have questions on Walleye Central. Interesting: As you get your 3 year outdoor card, you can actually purchase a fishing license that is also a 3 year deal. Capt. Obvious says: Then you can renew your license and your card at the same time! I did not take advantage of this option, but am kind of kicking myself for not doing it. Just an FYI. 2012: 1 week on Lake Pashkokogan; 2 weeks on Press Lake; 1 additional week to be determined!"
1375436,Golden Eagle,2011-12-21 19:31:00,2642,Nice going. You're on the way to figuring out life as it's meant to be.
1375454,JayM5209,2011-12-21 21:04:00,1050,"Received my mail reminder last week re: need to renew my outdoor card. Used the web site in the letter to renew the card and purchase my 2012 non-resident license. Printed out the license and the new card will come in the mail. The whole process took about 2 1/2 minutes and the system didn't hiccup once.P.S. Each year I carry a WI resident license and non-resident licenses from Ontario, Minnesota, and Texas. It's slick to be able to get them all on line. The only way to do it!"
1376034,Bluff,2011-12-24 08:41:00,152,Just wanted to add that it is also very easy to update personal information on the Ontario MNR site. You do have to sign in under your original recorded info. It is a pretty simple procedure.
1375073,Redear,2011-12-20 17:56:00,40,"I just got a letter telling me that it's time to renew my outdoors card.Whats up ,thought they said it was a one time fee to be able to have all fishing people on record.Fred"
1375078,pan-man,2011-12-20 18:01:00,299,Nope every 3 years.
1375082,Mike Borger,2011-12-20 18:17:00,1554,I take it you never noticed the expiry date on the card?
1375093,JDP,2011-12-20 18:52:00,1457,You can renew the Outdoors Card and purchase a new license on line.Less to do the day you cross into Canada.
1375110,fishincrazy,2011-12-20 19:30:00,1282,Do you have a link for that?I'm going up N this summer and haven't been for like 6 years so I know I need an outdoors card.The lodge owner said he'd get in touch with me to let me know about the card but like you said If I can get one before I go it'll be one less worry.FC
1375114,Jimmy Jig,2011-12-20 19:40:00,1905,You can re-new at this site: ontario.ca/outdoorscard Don't know if it will work for a new card or not?

1375286,zman8701,2011-12-21 10:53:00,100,"I will be buying my fishing license and outdoors card on line from now on. Used to buy them at the resort I fished, but they no longer will issue them. The ministry wants to be able to go into their account anytime they wish, to withdraw money for the sale of license. Not to many U.S. resort owners are to keyed on that idea."
