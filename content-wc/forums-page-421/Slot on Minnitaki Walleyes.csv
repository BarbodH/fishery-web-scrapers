1456165,scar,2012-06-30 20:56:00,196,Heard a rumor today that there is no longer a slot on Minnitaki for walleyes. I was up in early/mid June and did not hear this so we enforced the 18.1 - 21' slot (we never keep any fish over the slot so the high end is meaningless to us any way) Can someone in the know clear this up for me as I am heading back up later in July. Thanks!

1456439,BenBeattie,2012-07-01 18:22:00,232,Fish have moved out to deeper water. My best depth today was 28-32'. Another one of the boys got some fish in 10-12' so there are some shallow too. Seems smaller fish are still shallow but we got decent size deep. Lots of fish deep too. Around 150 in the boat today.
