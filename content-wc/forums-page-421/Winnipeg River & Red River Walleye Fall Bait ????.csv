523701,Guest,2002-08-23 11:35:00,0,Going to try for some Greenback Walleyes in October. Would appreciatte any help on what bait works best in the Fall....Thanks
523702,chrism,2002-08-23 18:12:00,429,salted minnows on a jig - or any bait that resembles a #8 shad rap or walleyediver!
523703,Guest,2002-08-24 00:16:00,0,jigs/salted minnows. them (for some reason) fish know unsalted/fresh killed minnow difference. as for crank baits.......I experiment until I find the one they want.
523704,Backwater Eddy,2002-08-24 10:01:00,3871,"I would highly recommend you have a few SALMO Whitefish and some Wally Minnows in your collection of greenback trolling tools. Sassy shads or STORM's new shad jigs would be wise too. Large salted lake shiners would be very handy to have on hand.(TIP) There is a significant hatch of carp minnows on the Red River this year. If my guess is correct this seasons boom carp minnow forage event will pull in, and hold, the greenback early this season? Tons of food will keep them around once they make the move in from the big lake. Lots of food = lots of fat sumo piggy type walleye.;)Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
523705,Guest,2002-08-24 15:46:00,0,"Thanks for the help guys....Backwater Eddy,what crankbait looks like a carp minnow? Can you buy carp minnows at any of the local baitshops?"
523706,Backwater Eddy,2002-08-24 16:08:00,3871,"Todd them buggers are so thick in the river that when I was washing out a cooler one night last week I scooped up 3 or four. I wonder if a casting net would be the deal?The cats are spitting up handfulls of them things in the boat, and the gulls are having a hayday. You see clouds of them on the electronics all over the river.I am not sure if the baitshops will net them but they sure wouldn't be too darn hard to find on the Red near the Lockport Dam. I was told by Stu that they are ok to use as bait so it is just a mater of getting them. To me they somewhat resemble a dace or a tiny shad, more or less. Silvery green with a dark back, little footballs, chubby critters. Sassy Shads type bodys are a close match in silver black or green.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
523707,Guest,2002-08-25 05:05:00,0,"Backwater Eddy, Thanks for all the great info. Do you live near the Red or are you just hooked on fishing like the rest of us?"
523708,Backwater Eddy,2002-08-25 05:20:00,3871,"Both, I live near and also guide on the Red River on the North for spring and fall walleye, and channel catfish from spring to fall.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
523709,Backwater Eddy,2002-08-25 07:23:00,3871,Here is a link to the Manatoba 2002 guide for baitfish and regulations.
