1455381,augiedog55,2012-06-28 12:54:00,4,I'm going in with a group of guys on a flyin to south lake with bighookcamps (northern ontario). The mayfly hatch is normally the first week of july up there. My question is the weather and the mayfly hatch normal this yr or they ahead or behind in ontario this yr. WE are flying in on 7-14Thanks in advanceBruce
1455393,dogrodder,2012-06-28 13:09:00,400,Just talked to my friends in the area and the fly hatch is full tilt right now on Wabigoon. Planning to be there next week and hopefully the hatch will be over soon.
1455466,packpro,2012-06-28 15:46:00,695,"Fished Wabigoon and Dinorwic two weeks ago. The hatch was going pretty strong then as well. We fished island rock points for 2.5 days. Very tough fishing. Picked one here on there. Actually got shut out on the Swedes for the walleye, but did pick up enough perch to make up for the lost day. Finally on the last day found two spots on Dinorwic. 7-8 FOW. Great little weed edge with some current. Bright green grass weed on the inside, with cabbage weeds on the out side. Fished the outside edge of the cabbage weeds. Took 31 out of that spot in 2.5 hours. All eaters and couple of 19""-20""'s. A guide at the dock told us the dark bottom in that area is where the mayfly larva were popping up. That attracted the baitfish under the cover of the weeds, and that in turn attracted the Walleye. Hope this helps."
1455496,Terwalleye,2012-06-28 17:36:00,166,I Agree Packpro. We fished on Cedar Lake from 6/13 to 6/23. Mayfly hatch in full bloom. Mad going full speed at dusk a little painful at times. ;-) But a couple of our more productive spots were these softbottom bays (near deeper water) where we could actually see them hatching. We were picking up eyes on leeches; right in those spots.

1456069,tooski,2012-06-30 14:40:00,393,Just returned from a lake with a huge hatch midweek. Leeches were by far the best option. They were so thick on the shore I sat in the outhouse to get away from the smell.
1456787,augiedog55,2012-07-02 15:43:00,4,I just found out that the mayfly hatch as been going on in far north western ontario (south Lake) for the last 2 days. It will be well over by the time i get there on the 14th
