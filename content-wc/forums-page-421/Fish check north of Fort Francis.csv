1452125,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-21 08:23:00,725,"Here is a story I posted a few months back. It fits well within this thread. We got stopped in a road check in 2010. We were quite confident because we absolutely knew we were within limits. The four of us had 16 walleye and 8 bass (It was in June). We usually don't keep northerns. Anyway they opened our cooler and we were having our final Canada cigar. I notice that he was taking an inordinate amount of time counting when he looks at me and says, ""I keep coming up with 17 walleye."" At this the other three guys begin inspecting dandelions on the road side and so i am the one that responds to his request to count them with him. Sure enough there is an extra walleye. Apparentlly two bags were frozen together so solidly we counted it as one. The officer believed me when I told him that this was a surprise to me as well. Unfortunately, someone had to admit that was there fish and since the dandelions were VERY interesting by now I said it must be me. He took four walleye and gave me a ticket which cost me $240. He said it was like a speeding ticket but that nothing was cheap in Ontario. I was the one expected to get the tax refund from camp which was supposed to be about $200 so everyone thought it would be even when I got the refund. Of course, that year the Canadian govt. decided that our refund was only $60, so i got hosed. This past year we made sure that the filet bags were not frozen together! Stuff happens. Point is, it was an honest mistake and the officer knew we were not intending to poach. The pulp check was swarming with his fellow MNR officers, so he couldn't just let us go. We now are VERY careful in counting the fish and I am no longer permitted to be the counter!"
1452209,cuamb,2012-06-21 10:56:00,203,We were headed up on the 9th and saw the check both years but it was not there on our return the following Saturday. We did however have hour long waits at the border both years.
1452215,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-21 11:06:00,1460,"We got back to NWO base on the 9th as well. By the time we got the plane offloaded into our rigs it was 6:30-6:45 pm. The check station was gone by then. We heard a lot about it at the base, however. I'd bet they close up shop at 6:00 when they have these fish checks."
1452221,tv4fish,2012-06-21 11:11:00,2694,"OK - All you guys talking about the fish check location being ""just outside of Fort Frances"" --- Where exactly is it? We have been going up to Sioux Lookout via Fort Frances for years and the only place we have ever been checked is south of Dryden.We always go the Sat. in - Sat. out trip."
1452294,REG,2012-06-21 14:04:00,445,"Best I can remember, the spot is only about a mile or so East of the big bridge over Rainy. There's a pull off area on the North side of the road. And tooski - regarding McD's - you're preaching to the choir. I'd prefer a nice sit down breakfast, but my daughter loves those McD pancakes and I mistakenly thought we could get in and out of there quickly. (wrong) Part of our tradition when the kids are along is to stop Saturday night on the way home at WS Dells so the kids can play - and Dad can sleep. And the sooner we get there, the better."
1452295,Guest,2012-06-21 14:08:00,0,Tell her to check the clorie count on those pancakes. That might change her taste a bit.
1452358,packpro,2012-06-21 16:13:00,695,"Same story for us. One over, honest mistake. Our guys and MNR/OPP got us just south of Dryden on 502. We counted 5 times along side the road, then we made sure the labels were correct on the bags as we were way under on NP. Same fine as HeHooks. The problem was the paying the fine. No credit cards. Sent check.....returned not allowed, Sent money order, returned not Canadian Funds......Finally 8-10 phone calls later...some answered, some not, we got it worked out. It was an honest mistake and we owned it, but we never had such a hard time giving someone money."
1452493,BennieS,2012-06-21 22:21:00,108,"[QUOTE=3M TA3;1452121]Hey Bennie. FYI on page 8 of the Ontario Regs, left column, paragraph regarding Open Seasons. In bold Letters it states ""It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them"" Seems pretty cut and dry there.""3M TA3, appreciate your taking the time to pass this along, not just for me but for others that may benefit by the knowledge and who may not be as lucky as I was to avoid a deserved citation. That young officer has now not only educated me but through your posting he's educated many others as well who read this and were not aware of this sensible regulation. As you say, it is vey cut and dried and all credit to those who protect that fabulous fishery that we experienced while there."
1452605,dkrusin,2012-06-22 09:14:00,97,"We have been stopped at fish checks many times either outside of Dryden on 502 or Ft Francis on 17. Never taken more then 10 or 15 minutes and officers very professional and polite. What amazes me is how *$%#** stupid some people are. Again this year outside of Ft. Francis on 6/9 was pulled over and here are 3 vehicles sitting there waiting for there clump of walleye fillets to thaw out so the officers can count them. I mentioned this to the officer who checked us and his comment was ""at least the sun is out"". Also, do not wrap fillets in freezer paper, they will get opened."
1456729,tv4fish,2012-07-02 12:37:00,2694,"We did not see a fish check south of Dryden or east of Fort Frances, But, we did get chosen for a ""random check"" coming back into the U.S. We were completely clean/legal (of course). Only took about 10 minutes - the 3 of us went inside and 3 officers went through the vehicle only. Then we had to go through the VACIS building so they could scan the boat, cover did not have to come off. Painless process."
1451543,Hawki,2012-06-20 05:55:00,7,Just curious how many have been stopped? The past two years we've seen it on the way up on Saturday. Is it random or every Saturday? We follow the rules so not looking to evade. We've heard the wait times can be long so it impacts our thought process on when we leave to head home.
1451566,REG,2012-06-20 06:43:00,445,We went for years without getting checked and then got stopped on the outskirts of Ft Frances last year on a Sat am. And then this year - same Sat. return (June 9) - get pulled over at the same place again! Certainly not a problem - dug out the licences and the cooler - everyone was friendly and professional and we were on our way after maybe 15-20 minutes. I would say that we were there around 7:30am or so - but we know from another member of our group that they were still open for business around noon when they came through.. Almost no wait at the border - 10 minutes tops. We actually waited way longer for our McDonald's order in Intl Falls than the MNR and border stops combined. We vowed to never bother with that McD's again.
1451576,tv4fish,2012-06-20 06:55:00,2694,"We have never been stopped outside of Fort Frances (we go up to Sioux Lookout). We HAVE been stopped numerous times just south of Dryden. They don't have much room there, so if they have a few vehicles already pulled over, they will just wave you through. When they are stoppping people, they have the OPP there in numbers also."
1451588,Bitinlight,2012-06-20 07:14:00,95,"Returned from Lac Seul on Saturday, June 9. Fish check station was just outside of Fort Francis. We got there about 11:45 a.m. Took only 10 minutes. They were very friendly. Having your fish handy and packaged properly really speeds up the process. This was the first time in 30 plus years of fishing Canada that I have been checked. No wait at all at the border."
1451649,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-20 09:07:00,235,"9 trips in last 12 years and never been stopped for fish check. However, we have been randomly selected for a full search of our car when entering Canada on two occasions. They went through everything and took out things that we had carefully packed to maximize space. They offered no help in putting stuff back in."
1451683,rockape,2012-06-20 10:18:00,215,"I have been checked or waived through the checkpoint 3 years in a row just nort of Fort Frances. They are serious and will take your fish out and count them. Be sure to leave skin on your fillets, and if they are frozen, only one fish per bag. I asked the MNR guy about violations, and he quickly replied that 8% are in violation in some way. I asked him if he busted anyone over the limit that day, and he said someone had 17 over the limit!!!! Wow! Don't gamble. You will get checked. They were nice and all and no issues other than the ticks in the grass at the checkpoint."
1451766,tooski,2012-06-20 13:08:00,393,seriously REG... McDonalds??? I hope you were only stopping to use the restrooms. Certainly nothing else there were stopping for let alone waiting in line for....
1451882,Nimstug,2012-06-20 17:55:00,2605,6-7 trips and one fish check by the MNR at U.S. customs. I suppose we were selected at random. We removed all the coolers and one person went through the coolers and one went through the vehicle. 10 minutes tops. They were courteous and professional. Got to chat with a nice US park service guy while we waited. NimstugOne of the privileges of being an adult is you don't have to eat at McDonalds.
1451994,BennieS,2012-06-20 21:47:00,108,"We ran into the checkpoint in Fort Frances on June 9 as well. Were asked if we had fish. My son who was driving responded simply, ""yes, we have fish"". The guy looked at me in the rider's seat and said to keep going but go slow. Up to that point we had waited 10-15 minutes on the highway and seen no other vehicles waived through. Go figure. I told my son that we must have looked too stupid to violate.Earlier in the week we had an ""in resort"" visit from the MNR. I was surprised at the volume of questions we were asked. At one point a young officer requestioned me while i was cleaning my fish, I'd already been questioned by another officer and produced license and Outdoor card for both officers, and asked if we'd caught much that day and where we'd fished. My remark was that we had caught a lot in the two hours we fished walleye but had spent the rest of the day fishing for muskie. He asked if I'd caught any muskie to which I responded, ""no, and I realize they are out of season but we would never keep a muskie"". His follow up question was , ""so, you were targeting muskie? Do you realize that it is a gainst the law to target muskie out of season?"". The brain can work pretty fast and mine was screaming ""oh cr-p, what's this going to cost me, 4, 5 hundred bucks"". I stated to the officer that I was not going to lie to him, that i was targeting muskie and was ready to ""take the pain"" for doing so. He told me to read the front of the regulation book and that is where I would find the rules on targeting fish out of season. He then left to check on the other cabins.I read every piece of printed material I had and could find no reference to it. I will however say that the rule makes TOTAL SENSE to me as it protects spawning muskie as was stated to me by the officer. I give Canada credit for the rules they have that protect their fishery. Wish Wisconsin would do the same and I wouldn't have to go to Ontario to have a decent fishing experience.Absolutely have no problem with their visit. Although questioned long and hard, they were professional, cordial but businesslike and carried themselves with dignity which I respect. Had I received a fine, I'd have deserved it, bit down hard and willingly paid it. I've often said ignorance of the rules is no excuse and was ready to walk the walk seeing as I'm so willing to talk the talk. I was lucky not to be cited in my opinion."
1452121,3M TA3,2012-06-21 08:16:00,2846,"Hey Bennie. FYI on page 8 of the Ontario Regs, left column, paragraph regarding Open Seasons. In bold Letters it states ""It is illegal to attempt to catch fish for which the season is closed, even if you are going to release them"" Seems pretty cut and dry there. I could tell from reading your post why the MNR dude let you go. You're a down right decent guy and he could see that plain as day. Just a straight shooter making a mistake. Part of law enforcement is education too, and you got some. Good day for everyone involved."
