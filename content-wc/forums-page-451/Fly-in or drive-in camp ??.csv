1348471,Ogoki,2011-09-10 11:12:00,291,"Just curious but after running into some guys I know at Gander Mtn I got to wondering. These guys have been only flying in for years . Some were doing guy only trips and some doing second trips with their sons and wives . The trips with sons or wives ,they mentioned how much money the fly-in trips were now costing them since that meant 2 or 3 times as much money going out of the same household for a trip . They were talking about drive-in trips for second trips . I was wondering how many other were thinking the same ? I know my wife and I took 2 trips this summer , one fly-in and a bear hunt and I DON'T want to know how much we spent plus I took a fly-in with some guys I go to church with . I am very fortunate to be able to take on extra work to pay for this but to be honest it wore me out .Too many long days working and getting caught up after retuning . I will not do three trips next year . Sometimes I think I would rather go cheaper and stay longer . Just being up north and eating a few walleye and being there is getting to be a little more important now after 35 fly-in trips . I know many of you probably do one fly-in and just pay YOUR way and not a sons or a wife's and what I am saying means nothing to you . Now the search for a decent drive in trip would begin . Not wanting to start a debate but was wondering if there are others on here thinking this way ??"
1348482,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-10 12:12:00,1460,"Ogoki,When I decided on a 2nd trip this year, I felt obliged to give first crack with NWO. This was right during the worst of the forest fires and they just lost a camp(Carillion). They were full up for the rest of the year so I turned to looking into a quality drive-to. Drew59 has been bragging up Forrest Lodge on Cariboe Lake. Just a little reserch and yes this is where I want to go. I will be there in a couple of weeks with the wife.You probably fly out of Armstrong and are fully aware of.http://www.forrestlodge.com/ Closest drive in from my lake(Wabakimi) and your lake(Ogoki Res)(Mojikit). Pasha cabins at Nipigon would be cool as well. I've found it wonderful to discover other options and potential 2nd trip destinations through this site."
1392857,sek2691,2012-02-11 12:41:00,15,"I have been to Knobby's fly-in lakes numerous times (8 or more). I have been to Eva Lake resort drive-to during the early 80's (5 or more times). The last 10 years we have been going to www.ghostriverlodges.com which is a boat-in trip. This year I took my family (daughters 19, 21, 24, my three boys 15, 17, 26, my son-in-law, my wife and parents). The cost is between the other resorts and still has more of a remote setting. We caught a ton of walleyes and if you want I can give you my Facebook page which has all our pics on it. This year we are looking to set up a church group trip so my crew of guys is going to Pasha Lake Cabins to try something new. We want to take 30 guys and need a drive-to so they can come and go at different times during the week."
1393063,octanehi5,2012-02-11 21:46:00,1104,After your first statement you should have called this just drive to. But here goes In my 25+ yrs of going to fish the canadian shield lacs I have never found a drive to lac that can holde a candel to one that is only by air. To much fishing pressure on a drive to Lac
1393125,Bill Krejca,2012-02-12 06:16:00,6107,"Perhaps the following is not of much help to you, but staying for 2 weeks instead of one significantly reduces one of the costs of 2 trips, and that is the cost of getting there/getting back home, which is getting increasingly more expensive. Besides that, you get in at least another day of fishing, as normally the Saturday leaving can be spent on a full day of fishing. The down side may be that a number of folks cannot be gone that long. Bill"
1393129,Pooch,2012-02-12 06:32:00,4619,"What octanehi5 say's is ""sort of"" right, but not always right.We've fished many drive-to and fly-in camps and they are not all created equal. There are many very good drive-in camps out there. There are also many not so good remote lakes also. We have hit both. Every lake offers something different. It depends on what we are looking for.Do your homework and ask the guys here on WC about specific lakes. This bunch is usually pretty blunt and not shy with their opinions.Usually it comes down to each individual lakes potential, cost to get there, facilities (dry and tight cabins, decent boats, etc), weight allowed on fly-in or boat in and the general feel of the camp. Some remote camps offer a great chance to get away from people with poor to great fishing with the bonus of being on your own. Many drive-in lakes offer the same to some extent. The further away from towns and main highways you get usually will bring you a more quiet trip, whether it's fly or drive.We once flew into what we thought was a remote camp only to find there was a small town across the bay that was accessed by rail. I think there is a ""outpost"" camp or more on some lakes that also have road access. Several times I've seen float planes gong in to land and found myself thinking that those fellows probably don't realize that there are drive in camps just a few miles from their ""outpost"" cabin.I doubt that most outfitters will openly lie, but ask questions before plunking down your money. The slightly less than honest camp owners usually fall by the wayside, especially now with the advent of the internet and great websites like Walleye Central to expose them.Good luck.Pooch"
1393133,wallydave,2012-02-12 06:53:00,2151,"With so many camps, lakes and types of fishing, find the experiance you and your group is looking for. For our group, we like the drive-in option, less cost, means less pressure to have the ""perfect"" trip. Our only fly-in was to be honest, one of the less ""productive"" as far as the number of fish caught, yet we still had a good trip, mostly because we made the trip memorable with the fun and memories. Our drive-in gives us the optins we like, we take a couple of kids along now, so we can go to town for a distraction. Weight limits are not even a concern, if we have room, take it along! Sure I would like to try a boat-in, and a fly-in trip someday, but for now the drive-in works for our group, at the end of the day, pick the option that works for your group! And tell the rest of us about your trip!"
1393238,Seanik,2012-02-12 09:32:00,218,"Another option to fly ins and drive to lodges are train in lodges, with the train ticket that puts the cost between the fly in and drive too camps. We have been doing train ins the past 2 years and the fishing compares to most fly in lodges. The trip on the VIA RAIL cars is very seanic and the service and ride is outstanding. This year we will board the train at Hornepayne and travel 7 1/2 hrs West to the lodge, last year we went to the same lodge and boarded at Capreal Ont. (near Sudbury),this trip was 18 hrs long. The Algoma Central RR which travels North out of Sault Ste Marie drops off at many train in only lodges. The train ride adds to the enjoyment of our fishing trips.

1393292,Ogoki,2012-02-12 11:50:00,291,"Reread my original post . I was NOT asking where to go , but asking if anybody else was feeling the way I do about spending so much on fly-in trips . I know we have inflation but my first fly-in trip in 1972 cost me $107 , in 1987 whn I took my wife for the first time we paid $335 each . Now we are looking at around $1500 each . Dahh !! My wages have not went up that fast and I work in a trade . It goes without saying that any body of water with drive to access (other than a very large body of water ) cannot take the pressure . That is just common since . Bottom line is that I will be going to Canada more and spending less . I ,at this point do not need 100 walleye days to enjoy myself and wondered if anyone else is feeling this way . Hope I clarified what I meant . To each there own . I can work more and make the money but at 57,it is getting harder to put in those long days when it is 95 degrees . ....LOL"

1393839,wallydave,2012-02-13 14:43:00,2151,"I am with you, fly-ins are too expensive! My drive-in camp offers great fishing, enough solitude, plus the advantages of no weight limits, along with the option of going into to town if you need a break from fishing. I'm not getting any younger either, so I will stick with my drive-in!"
1393847,jdoaks,2012-02-13 14:53:00,89,i like the drive in same f n said own boat more comfy plus seem to eat and drink alot better. fishing is fine where we go (big lake) Iwould never fly in again I can go 2 3 times for what I would spend on one flyin.
1393907,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-13 16:58:00,1460,"Drive to camps are great for certain circumstances. You can bring all the tackle and gear you want, but you will only use just a small fraction of it. Drive-in camps typically have nicer boats. Drive-ins may give some more peace of mind in the case of a medical emergency. Drive-ins have awesome guides and or lodge owners putting guests on fish. Drive-ins have maid service at certain camps and nice comfy cabins with indoor plumbing. Drive-ins have plenty of fisherman on the lake fishin hard every day. Fly-ins are great for the solitude you can have. Going all the way to a remote outpost camp to get away from it all with some special people in your life is a special type of medicine for our souls. I don't want to hear a TV or cellphone or a radio, just the sound of a loon is all I want. When on a fly-in, everything is on you. You have to find the fish, you have to troubleshoot problems, you have to determine what time you want to go to bed. (No lights out at 10:00). Fly-ins often have outhouses with deep holes and high piles. Like WallyDave said, the choice is what fits your circumstances."
1394088,octanehi5,2012-02-14 06:49:00,1104,"And Don't forget the Bears,I myself only find time to get up north once a yr.Look forward all yr to this trip. Like to be remote. An outfitter with exclucive rights to a lac is a good thing.If you fly in or drive to as long as your trip lives up to your expectations..Keep the peanut oil hot,the wine at room temp.The beer in the batter. You will have a good time"
1394143,Fisherman Ted,2012-02-14 08:28:00,461,"Not all drive-ins are created equal. At our lodge you can drive to it, yes. So you can bring all your goodies, not have to deal with cloud cover on the fly-in, get modern conveniences. etc. However there is no public access to any of the 19 lakes on our system. You have the peace and quiet of private lakes, no other boats on the water and no public access for decades and you indeed can drive right to it. There are many drive to lodges like this. Its the best of both worlds really. Fisherman Ted"

1394384,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-14 15:48:00,235,"I have only done fly in trips to Canada, and would prefer to do that again unless money was an object. If I was to go to a drive in, I would prefer that the lodge be the only resort on the lake and also have some access to portage lakes. On all the fly in trips I've gone on (9 total), we've never had a problem catching fish. Some years are better than others, but really these fly in lakes are idiot proof. Just find a drop off or a weed edge and drop a jig down there. I have heard from others that the drive in camps can sometimes be hit and miss, especially if the lake gets a lot of pressure. But at the end of the day, you're still fishing on a beautiful lake in Canada for a cheaper price, so it's better than not going fishing!"

1393836,Further North,2012-02-13 14:32:00,2008,"The cost of fly in camps is only a small part of why I prefer drive in fishing.The biggest reason for me is that on a drive in, I get to use my boat and electronics, and will have all of my gear."
