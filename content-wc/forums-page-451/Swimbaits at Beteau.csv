1392493,tight line,2012-02-10 14:51:00,37,Has anyone that has been to Eddies ever tried any swimbaits?I seen Doug Stange on In-Fisherman using them to catch both walleye and pike.Thought about trying some this spring at Beteau.

The one drawback is that they often got ""shredded"" by one just one or two fish. Bring some superglue to fixem up and use them again."

1392704,Mike Borger,2012-02-11 05:57:00,1554,"I've used Basstrix 5"" swimbaits in a variety of colors with success up there.My opinion is they're best utilized as a slow subtle presentation fished weightless in the shallow bays in early spring.Once the temps warm up you'll do better with faster flashier baits like spinnerbaits or weedless spoons."

My theory is to reach some of the deeper water adjacent to the jigging spot and work the swim bait up into the shallow water staying close to the bottom with an erratic retrieve. I'm of course looking for some of those bigger eyes that are hanging a little deeper around a drop off. This presentation has put some nice Eyes in the boat. Have had the best success with 5"" Swimbaits with a slim design. I like some of the old Matuzo Baits and luckily I have a drawer full of them. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
