Not concerned about trophies, just want the kids to catch fish and have fun. Have never fished Wabigoon before so would appreciate any advice anyone can give us about the fishing there. Thanks in advance, John"
1394150,Robert Cardenas,2012-02-14 08:42:00,138,"John,You picked the right place to bring your family, you are going to have a great time. First of all you can catch a lot of walleyes off the dock and big northern pike. Not sure if you will be bringing a GPS up, but they do make a navionics map chip of Canada and Lake Wabigoon is on it. The walleyes will be hanging on the rock piles which most of these are marked with buoy's and their is a couple right in front of the resort. This time of the year the walleyes are from 2-12 FOW so pitch or vertical jig the islands that have some small gravel and rock transitions. I will be heading to Bonny Bay Camp the first week of June and would be happy to get you on fish. Some of the things I would bring with you are: a lot of Jigs, crank baits (Flicker shads #5's, rapalas #5's and shallow running, Lindy rigs, and not sure if you are renting one of there boats, but if you are bring a couple portable rod holders that clamp on to the boat if you are going to troll. Definitely bring a rod with a bobber set up and some bobbers that light up. Fishing off the dock at night is awesome. Bring a bunch of spinner baits for casting for Northerns, the northerns and muskies will be in shallow all day and they are big. Send me a PM and I will help you and your kids get on some great Jumbo perch which can make for a great day for the kids and some walleye spots. Hope this helps some, like I said I will be up there a couple weeks before you and will be glad to help you out. Question for you, I see your from Ohio, not sure if you fish Lake Erie, but I will be fishing the AIM Pro Walleye Seriesâ„¢ schedule out of the Black River Landing and Black River Wharf held June 28 to 30, 2012 and I will be out there the week prior. I will be looking for pre-fishing partners that like to fish Erie. I see you will be up at my favorite lake and resort at this time, but if you know of someone let me know.****Camp Dinner is something awesome so don't miss it, Nancy and Len put on a spread that you will not forget*****Robert Cardenas"

1395003,cough6609,2012-02-15 22:12:00,48,"Hey John, BB is a great family resort and the easy access to Dryden is a bonus when the weather hits or the kids get ""bored"". It has been a few years since sitting down at Nancy's spread, but I remember it well. The boys we brought up there spent countless evening hours at the pool table as well. Wabigoon is a stained lake, due to the paper mills in Dryden. We had to adjust our normal clear water Canadian shield strategies and fish far more shallow than I could even imagine. Where we normally would be fishing in 8-15ft. of water in June, we were most productive in 4-8ft. of water depending on time of day. With being that close to shore, you need to be extremely careful when trolling as 2 groups damaged motors the week we were up there. We ended up utilizing slip bobber rigs set up around 6ft. and casting crankbaits on wind swept points and islands to catch our walleyes and stay off shore. Lot's of big smallies and pike as well, but you will have to cast right to the shoreline and utilize vibration type lures to help the fish ""zone-in"" on the baits. Have a great time! Craig"

1395632,Golden Eagle,2012-02-17 10:24:00,2642,I've been missing this fishing spot by driving right past it 4-6 times a year for 40 years. Maybe I should check it out for a couple of days.
