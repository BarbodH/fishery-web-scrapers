So far have looked at Crow Rock and Ash Rapids. Anything else up in that part of the lake? The more remote, the better. We'll need a lodge with guides (only going for 4 nt/3 day trip) and like the idea of being able to get to Shoal Lake for a day (sounds like pretty awesome bass and pike).Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Shoal Lake Lodge---American and housekeeping plans, guide included or optional, (walleye fishing closed in Shoal Lake) www.shoallakelodge.net Big Narrows Lodge---American plans only, Guieds available. www.bignarrows.com Frolander Island Resort---American plans only, guides available. www.frolanderresort.com Wiley Point Lodge---American plan only with guide service. www.totemresorts.com These are probably the closest resorts to Sloal Lake, although there are more options maybe a little farther away, and all can be accessed from Kenora.

I've been by Shoal Lake Lodge and have checked out what they have to offer and they seem like a well run outfit. Having said that, I've been to Wiley Pt. several times and the fishing gets better each year. The resort has everything you could want in as remote a setting as they are in. It is really a five star lodge in the wilderness. Wife and I went there for our Honeymoon and we've been back several times with family and friends. The cabins / rooms are first class, each has it's own sattellite TV, AC, kitchen area and fridge. Full bathrooms with plenty of hot water, hot tubs on some of the decks and the manl lodge is fantastic, and you will not go hungry. The daily shore lunch is tremendous and the location on the lake is wonderful. Good fishing is minutes from camp. Cold rainy days can be spent by the fire place if you desire not to venture out. If you need phone or internet access you can have that too in the main lodge... but I've never spent that much time in there being either on the water or sleeping... Good luck with your choice... LOTW has lots of great resorts and location for whatever you need, there is a resort there that has what you desire. Heck I've seen plenty of kids catching walleyes off the dock."

1395778,Ia Walihntr,2012-02-17 15:28:00,320,What time of year did you book? I'm sure you will enjoy the fishing. Let us know how you do! Marv
