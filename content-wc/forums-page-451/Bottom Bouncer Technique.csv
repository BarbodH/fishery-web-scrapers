1393542,oilguy,2012-02-13 01:35:00,257,"I like the idea of the spinner blade in front of the crankbait (as long as you select a bait that still will have action with a spinner placed on the line ahead of it). One thing I have been doing for a long time now is tying my first bead about 3 inches ahead of my first snell so it can't slide back to the snell. My feeling is Walleye may be attracted to the spinner and the beads, but they are eating the nightcrawler/minnow/leech on your hook. I've had great success with this type of setup even when other boats are struggling.As far as trophy Pike in the Fall go....we have caught most of ours on steep drop offs coming off of extensive shallow flats or bays. We have found that the biggest mistake is getting your hook too far down. We typically troll musky baits and try to keep them no more than 5 feet below the surface regardless of if we are in 10 or 25 feet of water along the steep drops. Before you go trolling massive baits, you must realize the type of lake we troll these on have healthy populations of Pike over 40"". Lakes like Waterhen, Lac Des Isles, and Tobin (all in Saskatchewan) are good choices to give it a whirl on."
1391269,Mike Kansas,2012-02-08 08:54:00,1463,"A presentation that has been very effective for us is to tie a Ripski about 4' behind a bottom bouncer. Sometimes I will place several beads in front of the lure with a #5 Colorado Blade in front of the beads. This presentation gets a lure with a nice wooble down to the bottom and gives the Walleye something new to look at. We have caught a lot of really nice Walleye doing this. It seems to be especially effective when the Walleye are in a deep water pattern late in the year. I like it it anytime we are fishing 8' or deeper. The Ripski is a stick bait style of lure. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1391345,WALLEYE651,2012-02-08 11:44:00,252,"i dont really know what a ripski is but i take it is a stick bait of some kind , with beads and a #5 colorado just in front of it i would think the action of ripski is now non existant am i correct or am i missing something"
1391357,Mike Kansas,2012-02-08 12:05:00,1463,Correct the Ripski is a Stick bait or jerk bait. The beads and the the Colorado Blade simply add vibration and flash. It does not hinder the lures action. The lure maintains its wobble because of its stick bait design. Give it a try it works well. The Ripski is sold on WC at Features / WC Gear and Products under Sirmanski. Mike Kansas
1392329,davenathe,2012-02-10 10:03:00,113,sounds like definitely worth a shot. questions weight of BB? forward or back troll? troll speed? successful lure colors?
1392340,Mike Kansas,2012-02-10 10:16:00,1463,"I determine weight by 1/2 oz per 10' depth. I like to forward trool this presentation because I can maintain better speed and 45 degree line angle from rod to water. I use a little higher speed than with normal BB rig. Gold based colors or Char based work well. Color depends a lot on lake forage base to match colors to. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1392364,Mikep007,2012-02-10 10:56:00,77,This made me chuckle -- we were at a location during the summer (Whalesback Channel of Lake Huron) where we were in 10 - 20 feet of water with a serious chop (maybe up to 1 to 1.5 ft) because of a wind...we were dropping 1 to 2 oz of weight on the bottom bouncer to compensate for that drift/chop. Caught a ton and it was a lot of fun!
1392430,Mike Kansas,2012-02-10 13:15:00,1463,Good point Mike. A serious chop does affect the weight choice. I should have made it clearer that the 45 degree angle of the line from pole tip to water is also a strong determination of weight size and the rougher chop requires more weight than a normal water surface to maintain the proper angle. The proper angle allows for a better feel of the bite. Not unlike the use of a heavier jig in heavy chop in order to maintain a vertical jig presentation to be able to feel the bottom on occasion. Mike Kansas
1392446,Mikep007,2012-02-10 13:36:00,77,"For sure, Mike! It's the ONLY time I've used that kind of weight -- thought I was deep sea fishing for a while there and was always fooled by those 15"" thinking they weighed twice as much!!"
1392469,prov1900,2012-02-10 13:57:00,544,I would imagine that would be a good way to get one of those bonus late season hog northerns too. They have always been a mystery to me as in where they go in the fall.
1392745,Mike Kansas,2012-02-11 07:44:00,1463,"Glad you mentioned that. We have caught several toothy critters doing this and a couple over 40"". If I were targeting Pike with this presentation I would use a leader. Late fall , deep water could be a chance to catch both a big Walleye and a Pike. Deep water holds many secrets Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
