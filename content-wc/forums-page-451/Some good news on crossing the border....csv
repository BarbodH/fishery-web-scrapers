My point wasn't to add to the already well stirred pot, but rather to give credence to a country that takes really good care of its fishing resource. I love going there because the fishing is just outstanding. I have fished all over Minnesota and South Dakota and have never seen anything compare. Even if you claim to have a 100 fish day on Oahe, you will never see a wolf, bear, or moose there. It is the things I enjoy the most. Everyone of us that go to Canada have our own reasons why we go. Quite frankly, the less that go...the more fish for me :D I don't need to fill my freezer to impress my friends at home either. I could care less if I ever take another walleye home."

Last year I bought a bear skin while in Canada and told them about it when I came back. We got pulled over for inspection. I think the guy thought I had a fersh untanned hide. Of course it was a completely tanned and finshed hide. He took a quick look and saw my reciept and we were on our way.

He had been out at a bar and when he got in the car, he realized he was too drunk to drive. He decided to ""wait it out"" and then he fell asleep and was discovered by a cop. The law's the law and he knows he broke it, but this was one mistake he made over 10 years ago. He has a completely clean record otherwise. Not sure what threat he would ever be to Canada today. A better law would attempt to put things like this in context. You can never have a perfect law of this kind, but you can improve it."

I searched google and could not find anything regarding this announcement. I'm SURE this would have made the news as this is a MAJOR change to the way people are admitted to CanadaSo the OP sent me a PM advising me that this announcement was made during a conference call to some people in tourism. I highly doubt this is the case. I think if this were true there would have been an official announcement and it would be ALL over the news.

I'll not trade my sovereignty for currency![/quote]Jinx, I was on the call. It is true! Your interpretation/characterization of what this means is hard for me to understand.The CBSA has been given direction as to the new Government Policy, specifically policy stating that those with ONE minor conviction (yes DUI is considered under Canadian laws as ""minor criminality"") shall be allowed entry after some paperwork at the border, there is no fee and they will be encouraged to apply for permanent rehabilitation and all I said was ""encouraged"", not required. Time since the minor offence occured is [B]not[/B] at issue - [B]key things to note:[/B] 1)[B]it has to be legally considered ""minor criminality"" and 2) only be one offence. [/B]If you are an American and that is your situation, then you will be allowed to enter. Any border guards who sway from this policy will have to account for their decision and must have a defensible reason for denying entry. Them having a power trip or bad day at the office in NOT one of those reasons that will be accepted by the Canadian Government. An example of an ""acceptable"" reason to deny entry would probably be something like the person is abusive to the officer about questions asked or paperwork involved etc. Other than that, entry will be granted - just some paperwork.[U]I can and will verify the information of the original poster[/U]. As to some of your other other comments, all I can say to those are this: [B][I]Americans are our best friends and EVERYONE is entitled to a mistake.

A policy announcement was made advising that effective March 01, 2012 a Special Public Policy will be put in place which will allow for a CBSA officer to grant a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP), to those individuals who have had only one minor conviction, where the sentence was less than 6 months in length. There will be no fee for this TRP, and the issuance of the TRP will be at the discretion of the CBSA official. However, it is understood that this special public policy should significantly reduce the number of inadmissible visitors to our country. It was explained that the intent of the present Inadmissibility Policy was never to keep out people of good faith who have had only one minor conviction, and aren't seen as a security or criminality threat. Government policy and law is not easy to change, and this was acknowledged as an interim solution. The government of the day will continue to work towards a longer term solution and we should all be thanking our MP Greg Rickford for his contribution in having this issue addressed, through his tireless efforts. It should be noted that the Government does not want this Special Public Policy to be perceived that criminal acts are condoned in Canada, nor seen as a change indicating an open door policy to allow all criminals into Canada - but rather as an interim solution for allowing those individuals into Canada that do not present a security nor criminality threat to our country, and who simply made a one time error in judgement and now want to enjoy everything that our great country has to offer. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction, and an official document is to be released next week providing further clarification on the above.

1394534,97roughneck,2012-02-14 21:21:00,899,"OK, first of all, I'm confused about the DUI preventing you from entering Canada. My friends and I took a motorcycle trip to Ontario in probably 2003 or '04. I had my passport along and I believe I brought my birth certificate for good measure. I had no problems entering the country. I had a DUI in 1976. If I was supposed to tell somebody about it at the border, I didn't and noone was the wiser. So, I got in and back out unscathed.

I had no problems entering the country. I had a DUI in 1976. If I was supposed to tell somebody about it at the border, I didn't and noone was the wiser. So, I got in and back out unscathed.

Yup, 6th conviction and first sentence that included jail time. On top of that, the offender agreed to a plea bargain which included the jail time hoping it might help him get closer to the straight and narrow line. He'd likely have not had jail time if he had not agreed to it. He will be eligible for day parole after 4 months and pretty much GIVEN full parole after 18 unless he is quite unruly within the system. Yeah, Canada is SOOOOO TOUGH on DUI offenders.

1393983,Shellback,2012-02-13 19:03:00,8083,"Border blues cured: Rickford announces 'best news we've heard in years for the tourism industry' By Jon Thompson Posted 3 days ago A temporary cure for the tourism industry's border blues was announced Friday, making it easier for Americans, who have minor criminal histories, to cross. Under the Tourism Facilitation Action Plan, Americans with a single indictable offence in their criminal histories, for which they served less than six months in jail, [B]are less likely to be turned back at the border.[/B] The plan will expand Visa Application Centres from 60 private sector offices to 150 globally by 2014. It will also give Canada Border Services Agency the discretion to waive fees for certain cases in issuing Temporary Resident Permits. Northwestern Ontario's hunting and fishing lodge owners have long complained busloads of tourists are being turned back from particularly the Fort Frances border crossing. At the discretion of border guards, one person's Drinking Under the Influence or other outdated infractions, deemed minor by the outfitters, has turned away millions of dollars every year and the industry has been lobbying for change. I think there's a sense of relief amongst the tourism stakeholders in Northwestern Ontario, said Kenora's Conservative MP Greg Rickford. (This is) a streamlined process where a border guard has the discretion to permit that person to come in without the rather lengthy documentation process, and frankly, some of the embarrassing context that may arise from that, at the border or prior to, in terms of interaction with the group they're coming up with. Calling the issue one of the biggest files I've ever faced, Rickford was clear the federal government was not condoning illegal behaviour, nor will it impact the vigilance of border security concerning entry by foreign nationals. Those with serious criminal histories or even two minor incidents will still be subject to the former regulations. The announcement brought elation to tourism operators. This is the best news we've heard in years for the tourism industry, said Smith's Camps owner Al Smith, who has been an outspoken proponent of change for years, claiming his 41-year-old business alone was losing $1 million annually. I know a lot of people around here don't think the tourism industry is a huge deal but we generate huge tax. If we could get the snowmobile thing happening in the winter again, it would generate more tax than Northwestern Ontario has ever seen. Halley's Camps president Eugene Halley was also among the voices lobbying the government and credited Rickford for his effort. This should really help with tourism in the area, he said. We're looking at this one-time pass, at least getting people up here to see what we're about. It's for minor offences, so at the same time, we're not jeopardizing the security of Canada or anything like that. I'm happy with what I see here. There are bilateral implications to changing the Immigration Act and the announced changes are only temporary. Rickford hopes to confer with the United States, the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, the Northwestern Ontario Tourism Association, the Ministry of Tourism and local outfitters by the end of summer to determine the plan's effectiveness.

One other point, you might want to change the verb structure in your drunk boating sentence as well.

1392753,campchick,2012-02-11 08:12:00,96,This is very good news! Thank you for posting. Hopefully this change will attract more fishermen to Canada. We could all benefit.
1392827,@Lunker,2012-02-11 11:13:00,835,It absolutely amazes me that the local gendarme have had the power to and can personally interpret rules instead of following a wider ministry policy. Hope someone reports back what they might find out at the Mpls All Canada Show.
1393013,fishead,2012-02-11 20:06:00,41,A DUI in canada is considered a felony. Its not a minor offence.

If I were criminally inadmissible to the USA I wouldn't cry about not being able to go there to shop. It's all part of the punishment for being stupid. There's no excuse for drunk driving and people need to realize that it's a mistake that will haunt them for the rest of their lives.

I will post a link to the change when I receive documentation.[/quote]I am very interested to see this as we have seen nothing about this anywhere. I searched google and could not find anything regarding this announcement. I'm SURE this would have made the news as this is a MAJOR change to the way people are admitted to CanadaSo the OP sent me a PM advising me that this announcement was made during a conference call to some people in tourism. I highly doubt this is the case. I think if this were true there would have been an official announcement and it would be ALL over the news. I can tell you that I for one as a proud Canadian would never stand for criminals being allowed knowingly into my country just so they can spend some money. I'll not trade my sovereignty for currency!
