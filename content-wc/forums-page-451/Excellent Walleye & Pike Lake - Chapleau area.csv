1392512,unclepaully,2012-02-10 15:26:00,112,"I feel (Mike) Solopaddler has the right of way on this one. He has helped me numerous times when it comes to outpost info and the like. He goes out of his way to help complete strangers on here and on OFC. He's never said anything publicly but I would be willing to bet he gets so many pm's that it would be bothersome to most of us. I think there's an unspoken line that shouldn't be crossed on these forums and asking for the ins & outs of someone's honeyhole publicly crosses that line. If you want it bad enough just do what solo did and get in touch with someone at the MNR. Find your own untouched piece of paradise. Look at maps, use a GPS, make some calls to the proper authorities to find out the regs & if certain bodies of water can be accessed. Then forge your own route with a machete if need be and the reward will be all the greater. Guys like Solo are what make these forums great. I think the rest of us recognize when another member crosses that line and I for one hope it doesn't deter you(solo) from posting your great adventures or from helping the rest of us."
1394446,pike50plus,2012-02-14 18:24:00,584,I also know from our prior contacts and exchanges thatMorin is the lake only available by portaging in from Anjigamin.
1394463,5richards,2012-02-14 18:52:00,131,Give it a rest --- solopaddler and friends worked hard for this and deserve some space -- have an original thought and research your own locations for a trip -- time to end this thread!

1391029,[emailÂ protected],2012-02-07 14:00:00,21,"Are you looking for an excellent Walleye & Northern Pike Lake? I would like it to be my personal lake, but that isn't going to happen. And if you only eat some of the smaller ones while there it will stay that way. Don't eat the big ones, and don't take them home...Catch them, take a picture, and Release them. CHECK OUT PARKS'S FLY-IN FISHING. They have 3 Fly-in Outpost Camp, and the prices are reasonable. Mostly excellent 4 Stroke Mercury Motors. Anjigaming Lake with a very nice newer cabin, very good numbers of medium and small walleye and smaller pike through June and July. I don't know about August; an excellent choice with kids. Usually a lot of Moose, Black Bears and a Bald Eagle or two. Abbey Lake with a very nice two bedroom log cabin, and very good fishing for medium size walleye. Another great place to take your kids. Ribes Lake, with a small old cabin best suited for two fishermen, four if two of them are kids. Very basic, but Excellent fishing for Medium and Large Walleye and Northern Pike late July or Early August. Very nice people to deal with. They are out of Thunder Bay, Ontario; but you catch the float plane out of Hawk Junction and fly about 30 minutes northeast...The Chapleau Game Reserve. Check them out![email protected]"
1391053,Mike Borger,2012-02-07 14:59:00,1554,"You don't have to sell me.I've fished Anjigaming and Abbey and had great trips both times.It was a family trip last August into Abbey (myself, my wife and two young kids), and it exceeded expectations.The cabins are very basic, definitely not the ritz, but the boats/motors are top notch, the fishing is very good and Martin and Jennifer are great people."
1391352,lenray,2012-02-08 11:56:00,467,Any stories on Morin Lake??????????
1391473,Mike Borger,2012-02-08 15:29:00,1554,"Len you're like a dog with a bone.I'm pretty sure you know that Morin lies in what the MNR is classifying as a ""Quality Fishing Zone"".I'm also pretty sure you know the roads in the Game Preserve have access restrictions on them.What exactly do you want me to say? LOL!For those that are wondering Morin is a small lake adjacent to Anjigaming, one of Park's outpost lakes.We fished it by dragging the boats up a log infested shallow rocky creek from Anjigaming. It was brutal.The fishing was however pretty good.Because of the access restrictions the only way anyone can fish Morin is by flying in or by means of a lengthy canoe trip with a great many portages some of huge length.I know your bag is DIY trips. Unless you've changed I doubt you'll be flying in anytime soon.Is there sour grapes for some reason that you can't fish it without paying for the privelage?"
1391856,lenray,2012-02-09 11:55:00,467,"solow Maybe I am wrong about my info. I have read your very interesting story, Lake of a million walleye, written in Aug. of 2009. I was told you were on Anjigaming and then you portaged over to Morin. In August of 2010 you wrote another very interesting story about a portage lake. Again maybe I am wrong on my info. Mallow Lake to Agusada Lake to Morin Lake. I learned last year that I couldn't park on the road near Mallow Lake and go into Morin from there. I have just wondered why some can and others can't--sure not a personal problem with you."
1391950,Mike Borger,2012-02-09 14:02:00,1554,"Not sure exactly where you got your info on where I was although I can guess.Suffice it to say your information is wrong. There's two people who know exactly which lake I portaged into, myself and my partner.At some point down the road I want to bring my son into that lake when he's old enough.I've had numerous people email me asking about the lake and I've never told anyone.The fact that you've dredged this up on a public forum doesn't sit very well with me.Is it so hard for people to grasp that I'm not interested in giving up info on particular lakes that I've worked ****ed hard to research and find? I'll help and have helped countless people who've contacted me regarding outpost camps and other general inquiries but I have a limit.Cheers"
1391962,Pikehunters,2012-02-09 14:22:00,100,Very well said I'm with ya on this one solo!!
1392263,lenray,2012-02-10 07:59:00,467,Thanks for the info. The younger fellas who want to go into Morin said they will park east of the gate and walk in with their gear to Mallow and go from there. At 67 it is more than this geezzzer is up for. Your kind words are much appreciated---thanks again.
1392287,Mike Borger,2012-02-10 08:44:00,1554,"Nice. Don't patronize me Len.More power to the younger members of your party if they actually do attempt this.A quick check shows it's over 25km from where the gate is to their intended destination.I'm surprised at you. I'd have thought that you of all people would understand the merit of discretion.Seeing as how you don't, if you've discovered any amazing back lakes filled with fish it'd be appreciated if you posted publicly every single detail about them. Perhaps even GPS coordinates.And the lakes past Pickle Lake don't qualify. Lakes that are much more accessable, say in the Terrace Bay or Missinaibi area are what I'm interested in.Only lakes that locals would be interested in cutting atv trails in order to access in the summer, or perhaps snowmobile into in the winter interest me.Fortunately the identity of the lake I bushwhacked into 2 years ago is still unknown and will remain that way.My apologies to the board and to the original poster, but this struck a nerve."
1392370,Mikep007,2012-02-10 11:08:00,77,"This isn't meant to step on any nerves here, just a casual observation. I spend a lot time with my GPS in Candada and track locations using Google Earth to plan Canadian trips. Looking at satellite images, it seems like Canada has a personal lake for everyone of us if we're willing to do the try to get there!!! It also seems like not many lakes would be hidden from the world these days."
