1395442,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-16 19:19:00,129,"Scott, I'll try and dig it up and post it. It has been quite some time since I have read it. I'll see what I can find on it tomorrow and post it here.Maybe I should have spelled it out better as to the older class such as these fish don't have as high a percentage of eggs that will hatch. Again I'll see what I can dig up and post it here.This is part of the reason behind the slot limits from what I've heard, keeping the most fertile (highest percentage of quality eggs) that will be able to be fertilized and hatch."
1395460,prov1900,2012-02-16 19:58:00,544,I've read this same theory through In-Fisherman several times....and they seem to be on the cutting edge. No different than humans really when you think about it. A 20 year old walleye would be like a 60 year old woman (my opinion...) as it relates to 'having kids'.
1395499,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-16 21:30:00,129,Well prov1900 I'm a common sense kind of guy and I'll say that common sense ain't all that common. Just my favorite saying in the world. Anyway I'll see what I can find when I get some time on this subject. I've also got a buddy that is a Fisheries Biologist up in Illinois and I'll see if I can get him to come here and chime in on the subject.
1392429,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-10 13:15:00,129,Yeah Roger they called it mariah. I've only ever heard them called eelpout or burbot before. All very good information. Thanks for sharing.
1392628,Rich B,2012-02-10 20:11:00,1081,Thanks for posting those U-tube videos.....who knew one could ice fish with nets ? Not something I have ever seen down here in Ohio. Rich B
1394218,Rich S,2012-02-14 10:34:00,1385,I think the comment under the pic says it all
1394540,oilguy,2012-02-14 21:32:00,257,"It's funny, the day I heard about this walleye from a friend who grew up near tobin lake I went to work and saw the picture on the next bite website. The story is slightly different but very close. Someone mentioned tobin for the next record.....well no matter which story I heard on where it was caught, both spots are downstream of tobin....and with the high runoff this past spring and the spillway open around the dam this fish might as well be called a tobin walleye. As far as weight goes, I believe it could go 20 or better. Look at the girth on that thing! If you are good enough to guess the length in a poor cell phone pic like the one we saw I'll have to send you some trail cam pics of different deer and get you to score them for me. If that walleye is a few inches longer than you give it credit for, you would be out 3 or 4 pounds pretty quick. I know my 11 1/2 lb walleye from tobin this summer is not even in the same league as this fish. At the end of the day this is an unbelievable fish and I can't wait to hear the real story with the rumors out. The two stories both said the guy threw it back. I guess we'll have to wait until its caught again! It is a little hard believing this fish was thrown back though. It looks pretty snowy and half froze. If I hear more i'll pass it on."
1394662,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-15 09:33:00,129,"oilguy, unless my eyes are deceiving me, how/why did he throw back an obviously frozen fish? I think we would all love to see better pictures as well as hear the full details on this."
1394693,oilguy,2012-02-15 10:40:00,257,"I agree David. It looks like the fish is half frozen, but they may have had some fresh snow and from the fish laying on the ice and collecting a pile of snow while it was landed it may just look like it is half frozen because of the snow on it?? Wishful thinking maybe. I'd like to think the fish is still alive. If it isn't alive, I hope they took some better pictures when they got it home."
1394701,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-15 10:53:00,129,"Well the other thing to consider is that a fish of this caliber is very old. Probably in the 20 year range and doesn't have much time left on this earth. Me, I'd of kept it with this in mind and not felt bad about the decision. There are arguments to both sides of keep or let it go. One other thing to consider is that I have read from a few fisheries biologists that these old fish don't have as many fertile eggs as the younger say 18""-24"" females do. Who knows but one thing is for certain that is a BIG WALLEYE!I did say that I think the next record will come from either Tobin or a southern lake. Tobin is on my list of places to fish."
1394803,lcwhit,2012-02-15 15:19:00,104,"just took another look at the pic and to quote the inimitable beavis, no way butt-head, no way."
1395394,Rippin Bite,2012-02-16 17:43:00,726,"Well i personally have never seen a 22 lb walleye in person. But i showed my dad this picture and he said BSSSSS he has caught a 22 lb walleye in 1979 he said it was approx 38"" commercial fishing on Primrose lake saskatchewan. He also saw another 20 lb caught in 1981. It is hard to catch walleye in nets over 10/12 lbs cause there so strong they tear them up, 2011 dec we caught 5 walleye over 10 lbs in 1 net, for those who dont know this lake is closed to anglers cause its in the AIR WEAPONS range, Commercial fishing this lake just maintains the population, Biggest whitefish we caught in 1998 was 16 lbs."
1395436,Papascott,2012-02-16 19:13:00,1322,Just curious where a biologist said that about older fish.? It goes against everything ive been told when talking to biologists face to face.
1391782,K Gonefishin,2012-02-09 09:54:00,5024,That's my point. What do YOU think it weighs and how long it is.
1391834,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-09 11:25:00,129,"I don't think it is as big as the one in my avatar nor as heavy. I'm going to guess 30"" and 10.5 lbs The way he is holding the fish is why I'm saying that. It's held away from the body which makes it look much bigger than it actually is. Am I far off?"
1391931,K Gonefishin,2012-02-09 13:35:00,5024,It's 32 3/4 a little under 12
1391957,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-09 14:15:00,129,Mine is 31 3/4 and 12.8lbs . I'll post up the avatar pic. Thought I had done that.
1391995,K Gonefishin,2012-02-09 15:52:00,5024,"I've seen it 100 times, I know your proud of it Dave."
1392034,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-09 17:07:00,129,But of course but that wasn't my point. Simply that depends how the fish is held and how the camera is in reference to the subject. I think the one at the beginning of this thread is a huge fish but still have doubts to 22lbs. Your thoughts?
1392102,manitobawalleye,2012-02-09 19:41:00,885,Here you go David.....you will be ready to apply for a quota after watching these... not many are as well set up as these guys most have a lot more hands on labour.... The current Lake Winnipeg quota is about 10 million pounds of walleye each and every year....right now the majority have been filling their yearly quotas during the open water seasonshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7G1X...eature=related Part 1http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bgOF...eature=related Part 2http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvA9R...eature=related Part 3http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D4tK...eature=related Part 4
1392265,Pikeslayer8,2012-02-10 08:06:00,1460,Now that something you don't see everyday. Eye-opener. Wonder what they do with the goldeyes. Looked very ingenious and a part of their culture. Who am I to judge?
1392335,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-10 10:09:00,129,Roger thank you so much for posting those videos. Very informative and eye opening. I was trying to figure out how they could fish gillnets under ice and this explains it. You are right these guy's are probably setup better than most. What is the goldeneye? Looks like some kind of whitefish or shad maybe? Oh and was one of those fish an eelpout that they called some different name?
1392406,manitobawalleye,2012-02-10 12:26:00,885,"There is a market for smoked goldeye...they are similar to a tulibee...very good smoked...main supply is during open water....eelpout is the fish of many names David....mariah, burbot, lawyer, lingcod, all the same thing...the commercial guys also call freshwater drum....sunfish and silver bass.. in the old days they would sell all the whitefish and walleye and eat boiled sunfish and onions... the whitefish use to be the main target fish years ago but the numbers and price have dropped..."
1390835,Iowa Hawkeye,2012-02-07 05:22:00,90,You must work at Shor'landr or Gomaco if you moved to Ida Grove?
1390850,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-07 06:27:00,129,"not yet, working on it. I might have a job with Gomaco but have to finish healing from my spine surgery."
1391552,Guest,2012-02-08 18:55:00,0,"Hate to say it but regardless of how big that fish is, I'm guessin it came from a gillnet."
1391597,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-08 20:37:00,129,Can you tell us why you say it came from a gillnet? Especially since it was in the middle of winter and the lake was frozen. I'd like to know your logic on this. Thanks.
1391641,manitobawalleye,2012-02-09 04:58:00,885,Gillnets are used up here all the time under the ice David. Cross Lake where the photo is from is also home of the last Bigfoot sighting in Manitoba.
1391647,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-09 05:19:00,129,That is very interesting to know Roger. Now from looking at that picture doesn't look like any gillnet marks on that fish though. But if it had been gillnetted then that could be why there isn't much about it on the web?I do find it an interesting concept of using gillnets under the ice. Can you provide me with a link to where I can read about it? I'd also still like to hear more on the weight of that fish. To me it doesn't appear to be over about 15-16 lbs but pictures can be deceiving.
1391677,Pikehunters,2012-02-09 06:52:00,100,Screw the gill net i want a pic of the big foot!!!!!!!!!!!!
1391689,K Gonefishin,2012-02-09 07:08:00,5024,"That fish is huge, I can believe it. Pictures can be deceiving. Look at my buddy holding this one, don't get me wrong it's a big fish but I bet we could fool people by 5 pounds and no way to disprove it."
1391694,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-09 07:21:00,129,Kevin how much did that fish weigh and what was it's length?
1391705,sault eyes,2012-02-09 07:51:00,268,"I think the world record will come from the Columbia river. My second guess would be Quinte, third would be green bay, and fourth is Tobin or Last Mountain lake. I am no expert though but someone will catch it within 5 years. The reason I mentioned green bay is because I have heard rumours that the get one in a trap net every other year or so that rivals the record. But who knows. If someone would ever dump walleyes in the fraser river in B.C. it think that would be and incredible fishery."
1390389,MN_Moose,2012-02-06 05:43:00,964,FAKE It's dang near as long as the guy is tall.
1390413,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-06 07:01:00,129,Yah Moose I got a laugh out of that one too. I think they mention that in the article on it. But the last one is the standing World record. People will do some crazy things to try and fudge the record. Look at the bass world record.
1390465,Jimmy Jig,2012-02-06 08:52:00,1905,"I notice that he was careful to make sure his fingers were not showing! If they had they would have look very, very large!"
1390473,adempsey,2012-02-06 09:26:00,963,That looks photoshopped to me. You sure it's legit?
1390479,Knot Tellin,2012-02-06 09:40:00,386,"I call BS. There is no way unless the guy holding it is 7'-4"" and 400lbs. Look at his hand compared to the length between the front fins and back fin along the belly and even the tail. My best is a 32 11lb 6 oz fish and it has way more distance between fins. I would guess the fish isn't even 30 long. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=3729"
1390494,SoulFulCry,2012-02-06 10:02:00,158,i watched keith catch a 14.15 on t v and that sucker was huge ok this one hasnt the girth nor is he haveing any trouble gettin his fingers around the tail no way that fish is anything but maybe 10 to 12 if that oops i meant on the next bite tv dvd lol
1390554,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-06 12:54:00,129,No I don't think it is. The last one I posted in that original post has the current world record 22lbs and something which is correct.
1390814,SteelheadSlayer,2012-02-06 22:29:00,85,Where do you guys think the new world record will be caught?
1390828,Pikehunters,2012-02-07 04:37:00,100,That's one for a whole new thread !!!
1390830,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-07 04:45:00,129,"I say either Tobin or somewhere in the south. Lake Tobin sure puts up some good numbers of mid teen fish on a regular basis, but the record came from Arkansas lake Greers Ferry. In the south they have a couple of things going for them. Longer growing seasons, good food and very little pressure on the walleye fishery.http://arkansasroadstories.com/nature/walleye.html"
1390216,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-05 16:16:00,129,Does anyone know anything about this fish? http://www.thenextbite.com/sites/def...%20walleye.JPG I just read about it on The Next Bite website. www.thenextbite.com
1390225,jkonop,2012-02-05 16:37:00,544,"It looks big, but not that big. But then again, how would I know..."
1390228,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-05 16:50:00,129,I agree. My personal best is 31 1/2 and 12.8lbs and doesn't look much smaller maybe not as much girth but mine had already spawned out. No doubt it is a big fish!
1390241,fishincrazy,2012-02-05 17:04:00,1282,I think I saw another post about this fish.You'd think a fish this big would be all over the web.FC
1390243,KTroller,2012-02-05 17:09:00,237,"David, you're from Ida Grove? I have cousins in and around Ida, Odebodt, Kiron & Arthur.KT"
1390249,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-05 17:21:00,129,"KTroller, I just moved here back in April I'm actually originally from New Orleans. But moved here from Prairie City, IA. Nice area but the walleye fishing isn't near as good as my favorite Lake Erie"
1390254,KTroller,2012-02-05 17:32:00,237,"Yeah, nothing like Erie...Spirit & Okoboji. Get on up to the Waubay area in SDKT."
1390261,Juls,2012-02-05 17:58:00,13414,No way that fish is over 20 pounds. Not buying it. Juls
1390263,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-05 18:00:00,129,I agree Juls. This one is 23lbshttp://www.walleyeheaven.com/newworldrecord/1.jpgThis one is 18lbs 4.8 ozhttp://www.walleyeheaven.com/world-r...ce-fishing.htmFull article: http://www.walleyeheaven.com/world-r...ce-fishing.htmAnd the world record walleye: http://www.walleyeheaven.com/world-record-walleye.htm
1390264,chevtow,2012-02-05 18:04:00,691,Must have a gold bar in its guts to weigh that much.
