I noticed the change when the network switched from Versus to NBC Sports. I have read rumor that NBC made them pull the plug on the segment. Does anyone know if that is the case? And if so, does anyone have a contact number for the NBC Sports station?? NBC had no problem airing ""the bird"" during the halftime performance at the Super Bowl, but mention one thing about God and the plug gets pulled?? I have about had it with all this politically correct (or incorrect...depending on how you look at) nonsense. NP"
