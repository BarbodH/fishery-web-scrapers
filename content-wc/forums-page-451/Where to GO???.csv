1393634,jeffcob,2012-02-13 08:51:00,7,Need some advice. Buddy and I are going back to Canada for the 3rd time this fall and I wanted some advice on the walleye fishing on Eagle Lake and on Perrault lake. 1st trip we stayed on Eagle and fished the east arm (Osbourne and Niven Bay) and had a great time and caught a ton of walleye and the only downside was the long ride down (we stayed at Temple Bay) This time we are looking at the West arm of the lake and was wondering how the walleye fishing there compared to the east arm where we are considering (along with some of the portage lakes in the area). The last trip we stayed on Cedar lake and had a good time but walleye fishing was a little slow probably due to 80 degree temps and high sun on most days. This time we are are also looking at Perrault lake so if anyone has information I would like to hear your thoughts! Thanks

If you plan on staying around Osborn bay, send a p.m. I do not want to put down a lodge on the forum. On Eagle Lake I would recommend a guide for a day. If you want to driver further north I would consider fishing around Ear Falls. You have the option of fishing Lac Suel, a larger body of water, fantastic fisheries, Evergreen Lodge as well as other resorts in the area are excellent. If you like a smaller system,consider the English River out of Anderson's Manitou Falls. Aprox. 25 miles of river with 7 lakes. Fantastic fishing. No matter where you decide around Ear Falls, you will be thrilled with the results. Need more information send a P.M."

You will almost always catch your limit and most of the fish are HUGE compared to other places. There's tons of camping sites and B&B to stay at. You will NOT be dissappointed...plus we have amazing jumbo perch, 4-6lbs small mouth, muskey etc right there."
