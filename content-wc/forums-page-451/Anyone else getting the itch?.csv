1395652,labsrus,2012-02-17 11:01:00,557,"I agree with most of the posts about the itch not ever going away. I have been itching mine a few different ways this year. Made a few new fishing rods for the two youn ladies in our lives, one a daughter and the other is my sons girlfriend. They both turned out really nice. Now ia have ordered two new sets of components to build the better half a rod and of course one for myself. I have been make a few crawler harness rigs this winter. For the boat I have on order an new floor covering to install. I also have a new livewell switch and pump and need to rig up some plumbing for the livewell, that will take a weekend to install. I do send my fishing buddies a few pictures of last year to make them lose their focus on work for the day. That is kinda fun We do a mid winter fish fry in January to help take the endge off. Complete with fruit cobbler cooked in the Dutch Oven. Lots of fun."
1395988,Pikehunters,2012-02-18 08:01:00,100,Erie outdoor expo next weekend anyone coming to Eriehttp://www.sportandtravelexpo.com/Erie/Default.aspx
1396013,Fishin Fun,2012-02-18 09:10:00,218,Itch isn't the word for it. I have not even done any ice fishing this season due to the thin ice and my 2 boys having basketball games every weekend. I just put the ice house back in storage this season. The only redeeming factor I have going now is that I have a guided fishing trip in Fort Myers in about 6 weeks. At least I have that to look forward to.

1390661,Pikehunters,2012-02-06 16:42:00,100,Put the 5 gallon bucket in the driveway & had a competition. Could make this into a drinking game miss a cast DRINK
1394582,CaptainNewbie,2012-02-15 06:02:00,16,"Agree on that Canadian shield comment (being a proud Canadian). To sooth my itch I pulled all my gear out on my workbench in the basement, re-spooled all my rods with about 80 bucks worth of a variety of fluoro, mono and braid, tied about 20 new flouro leaders, and bought hydrographic maps of my targets for this coming season Rice Lake (walleye), Bay of Quinte (walleye capital of the world) and Lake Ontario (Great Salmon hunt). My snow blower hasn't even seen gas this year.... Canadian Topographic Maps were 20 bucks each but they are six feet by 3 feet and great detail. Now I am plotting all of the popular fish sites from research, chats, dock side bull and so on... My wife thinks I am losing it!.. My son joined me in the basement...."
1394606,northernbite,2012-02-15 07:34:00,1186,If I keep buying stuff to get through this addiction I'll have to open up my own store! Paul
1394612,wallydave,2012-02-15 07:42:00,2151,"Yea I could have a yard sale too, but its hard to let go of gear this time of year, we just might need that extra third or fourth rod-n-reel, or tackle box, or.....It's not the sale, its just a way to fill in the time before we head North eh!"
1394623,BGunn,2012-02-15 08:06:00,880,I've got to quit going there (and there's more in the boat)...
1394763,Mike Kansas,2012-02-15 14:19:00,1463,ITCH ???? Somedays it feels like my whole body is covered with Jigger bites. Thank God that I can go down to the basement and work on lure orders. Mike Kansas
1394768,wallydave,2012-02-15 14:23:00,2151,"Bass Pro didn't have any ""camo"" line at the EP store, so I ordered some walleye line from Northland, the new braid and mono. I will wait another week or two before I go thru the tackle box again, so many jigs, such a loooonngg wait till June"
1394772,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-02-15 14:29:00,629,"By my count: I'll have 81 days to my travel day back to Baudette, & 87 days till the US/Minnesota LOTW opener. The boat may come out of ""Winter Storage"" with a record removal, if this weather here in Iowa sustains!! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1394891,Ranger319,2012-02-15 18:05:00,166,"I had the itch going before we even hit 502 heading home last summer!!Been through the tackle boxes 3 times now. I think I started wearing the paint off lures shuffling them around as many times as I have. On the positive side, I did rearrange a couple different ways and now have room for about 6-8 more crankbaits!"
1388911,wallydave,2012-02-02 12:49:00,2151,Yea I miscounted! 134 to go! The itch must be pretty bad to add days to the wait!!
1388913,wallydave,2012-02-02 12:57:00,2151,"Repeat after me, I (you name) have a walleye addiction, I need help and a few more jigs to deal with my addiction to fresh air, great fishing and getting away from it all!Stir Craz There needs to be a FA (fisherman's anonymous)"
1388985,BGunn,2012-02-02 15:46:00,880,"Mark Komo's videos of trolling on the Bay of Quinte brought tears to my eyes.... I might be gassing the 196 up this week ""Just in case""......"
1388988,lcwhit,2012-02-02 15:52:00,104,believe i saw a couple of guys crappie fishing in a stump field behind my house today. now thats pushing it. but it gets the blood flowing. mild winter here in central illinois.
1389027,Pooch,2012-02-02 17:04:00,4619,I'm scratching that itch in Molokai at the moment. These folks use twister tails out here in the middle of the Pacific! Pooch
1389075,jimirjr,2012-02-02 18:35:00,1149,"BIG time blizzard heading for the Denver area tonite... puts a damper on My outlook for an early boating season...Wife says She might need to sedate Me pretty soon if I don't calm down! Oh well, 12 inches tonite.... 55 degrees by Monday!"
1389114,gfish,2012-02-02 21:04:00,23,"Perfectly said. Just bought my first Ranger boat this fall, and can't wait to get it up to Canada. I spend hours looking at the same lake maps, and my wife is also looking into counseling for me. By the way, our count is down to 142 days."
1389175,REG,2012-02-03 07:14:00,445,Putting the yearly deposit in the mail today. June can't get here soon enough.
1389181,nitrodude,2012-02-03 07:22:00,60,Counting down the days back to LS and soothing the itch until then between here and N FL with some big 'ol stump carp!
1390107,wallydave,2012-02-05 11:15:00,2151,Bass Pro has a sale going on until Feb23 on some rods n reels! Could be a good time to check out the sales and get ready for June eh!
1388557,Obabikon,2012-02-01 16:25:00,2370,"It's been unseasonably warm in Southern Illinois the past few days. Making me miss camp life. A round of golf is a nice second option, but it doesn't touch fising on a beautiful Canadian shield lake!"
1388571,jkonop,2012-02-01 17:05:00,544,Agreed! I am stir crazy..
1388665,Nimstug,2012-02-01 21:26:00,2605,"I think you can thank or blame me, depending how you look at it. Last week I purchased a new two stage snowblower. I kept it in the box until Saturday wheeh we had maybe an inch of snow. I took it out of the box and assembled the handles and chute.My plan for limiting snow the second half the winter is working much better than I thought it would.Nimstug"
1388695,Skywagon,2012-02-02 05:12:00,1106,"I keep scratching my itch on a regular basis Ababikon, but it has been warm here too. Just heard on the radio yesterday, this was the warmest January in Dryden since 1914. There is a chance of getting above freezing again today, don't remember that being a problem in the past. We did get a few inches of snow this week, but still only a couple of feet total in the bush. The lakes are going to need a lot more than that to get back to normal pool. If you get real bored, I hear there is a pond down your way called Rend, you might want to try that out to scratch your itch."
1388709,Babamel2,2012-02-02 05:53:00,414,"I never get the itch, I just stays with me. As I take the boat out of the water on my last trip of the year, the itch takes on a new life already itching for next year. I don't get it, its got me."
1388725,bergsh,2012-02-02 06:36:00,183,I never lose the itch either. Planning a trip to Red Lake at the end of the month to do some ice fishing for walleye. That should hold me over until the Wisconsin opener or late ice anyway.
1388745,wallydave,2012-02-02 07:26:00,2151,"Itch, its more like an empty feeling, that can only be filled by fresh walleye, the beverage of your choice, and the wide open Canadian sky! The cry of the loon, and the sound of the bow cutting through the water each morning as you head out to battle pike and walleye, along with the sense of excitement and anticipation of another wonderful day on the water. Yea no matter what you call it, we got it! For our group the cure is 134 days away!"
1388757,Larry S,2012-02-02 07:45:00,665,"Enjoy your new snowblower, I lived in Schaumburg,by Gulf & Barrington for 15 yrs. I have lived the last 12 yrs in Henderson,Nevada,it will be around 70 here today. I'm still antsy to go to Canada fishing. Just finished cleaning the pool. Dream on everyone,time goes fast.."
1388904,KTroller,2012-02-02 12:35:00,237,"Dave, what happened, I thought a couple weeks back you were down to 150 days? I hope time isn't going backwards.KT"
