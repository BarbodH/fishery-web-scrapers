1396148,Esoxchaser,2012-02-18 17:58:00,1576,Your best bet would be more in the Georgian Bay or Superior watersheds. I would look around the French and Moon Rivers at smaller GB tribs..
1396299,stillangling,2012-02-19 07:42:00,149,"The only place that I can think of in NW Ontario would be the Kaministiquia River in Thunder Bay. Locals call it the Kam. The bottom section of the river, just before it dumps into Thunder Bay, is industrial but that is not representative up the upper river. There are miles and miles of river upstream that would be suitable for wading. Walleye and smallmouth there in good numbers. Never targetted smallmouth there myself but I have certainly caught some nice walleye in the deeper sections. Years ago there used to be companies who would rent rafts. Start in Stanley and pick you up in Rosslyn Village. Not sure if they still operate but might be an option. Alternatively you could bring a canoe. The Kam is one of the few larger rivers in the region with smallmouth that are suitable for wading. Also one of the few tributaries of Superior with a warm-water fishery. I am guessing untouched smallmouth but it has been years since I fished the river. There are a bunch of hard-core fishing nuts on the attached site. Not sure if anyone will spill the beans for you though on the Kam but it would be worth a try.http://www.thunderbayfishing.com/"

There are very long stretches of shoreline where wading can be done. This type of fishing is hardly ever seen on the lake, and it can be a pure joy! With polaroid sunglasses, sight fishing can be accomplished, although it is not necessary to spot them prior to casting. The fish are not used to seeing an angler in the water, and with LOW, you never know what you will catch next. If this year ends up being another low water year, reduced water level can facilitate ease of wading the shore line. Wear non-bright clothing. Bill Krejca"

Quent over at www.seineriverlodge.com would be a good authority to contact about the smallmouth in their system of lakes and river."
