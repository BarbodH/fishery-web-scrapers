This first year without your father will be difficult, but in time it will be different but never trully ""better"". In times like this this I encourage families to come together, to support each other, keep telling the family stories that will keep his memory and examples, alive in each one of your family, friends and even the WC community, hearts and minds.Your father lived a rich full life doing what he loved, a rare few of us can say that, may his memories always be with you!"

1383694,Obabikon,2012-01-19 15:36:00,2370,"I first would like to say I'm sorry. I have not been active at all since the tragedy late this summer. Many of you found out about this and expressed your condolences. Thank you, and again I apologize if I did not respond directly to your sympathy. We were completely overwhelmed with love and support through the difficult circumstances. I have delayed making this post, because of the emotional nature. However, I feel it needs to be said. My dad (Bill Amason) passed away in an accident late this summer. Dad spent more than 40 years on Lake of the Woods with ownership and involvement in Obabikon. Mom and Dad were able to live the dream together. They turned their career into a lifestyle. It was a lifestyle of bringing joy and knowledge to the area. To prevent any incorrect information being circulated, here is what happened. Dad left before dinner to take a load of boxes to a rock for burning. When he did not return in time for the meal, I went to look for him. After discovering his boat drifting against the shoreline, about a Â¼ mile from where he was supposed to be, we organized a search party. We discovered his shoes and pants on the rock, and were able to piece together what happened. His boat was blown off the rock on the windy day, and he stripped down and swam after it. Due to the high winds and cold water, he was unable to catch the boat. Initial searches were unsuccessful. A dive team from Toronto and local MNR officers were able to recover him four days later. I want to express my appreciation to these two separate units. They handled themselves with the greatest of professionalism and understanding. All that said, we will continue to run the camp in a way that will hopefully make him proud. Mom is going to continue being an active part at the camp. My wife (Erin) and I hope to be at Obabikon for many more years (God willing). There's not always a moral to a story. There doesn't need to be one. The greatest part of these trips to Canada isn't the fishing. It's the joy and excitement that you get from being with the ones you love.
