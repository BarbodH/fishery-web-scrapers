1393158,JinxCanada,2012-02-12 07:23:00,1306,12 lbs fireline for jigging... 20lbs mono for trolling
1393161,Tonyo,2012-02-12 07:26:00,212,I have been using 6# Vanish for the past several years and have had good luck with it.
1395009,Dabluz,2012-02-15 22:53:00,350,"I have my best fishing with 6 lb clear mono. I especially like Sensation which is a copolymer line but it acts just like mono. If the bottom is clean, I use 4 lb clear Sensation.I've never had a break off.....that I can recall.....except with pike. My reel is adjusted light and the only way I can get the fish to the boat is by pumping the rod.When trolling, I use either 6 lb clear Sensation or 8 lb test Fireline."
1395012,bowhunter99,2012-02-15 23:27:00,218,well i think about this alot so this winter i rigged up a reel with fluro and one with braid and put the camera down - not even close the fluro outfished the braid big time- even the pike hit the fluro better- this year going to rig up all my reels with mono or fluro

1395065,octanehi5,2012-02-16 06:43:00,1104,Suffex 832 10lb. test. for walleye add a floro carb leader if the water is real clear My other choise was power pro until the 832 came along
1395071,wallydave,2012-02-16 06:55:00,2151,"I ordered some Northlands walleye braid and their Bionic walleye mono to try for this years trip. Camo colors for both, I will see how they work in June."

1383579,Cash,2012-01-19 10:37:00,73,I usually just use Stren or Trilene 6-8 lb. clear. Whatever is on sale. Never any real issues. Am I missing something?
1383696,BenBeattie,2012-01-19 15:48:00,232,"I don't think you're missing anything. I'm a mono guy for jigging walleye too. 8lb berkley XL works for me. I think guys could argue about braid vs. mono until opener in May, but the bottom line is whatever you have confidence in and works for you is the best thing."
1390565,Casey Walleye,2012-02-06 13:35:00,14,I use 8 pound Fireline Chrystal. It is almost invisible even in clear water and it never wears out. I also hardly ever have a problem with it coming off of my spinnng reels. It is limp and outcasts mono by several yards. You have to have a knife to cut it. I can not bite it like I can mono. It is expensive but like I said it lasts forever.
1390581,wallydave,2012-02-06 14:11:00,2151,"I usually fish stained water and I like to try different lines on my jigging gear.I like to have a couple light rigs and a couple of ultalight rigs for jigging. Barkley Vanish, Spiderwire mono, and Fireline are spooled up each season. Fireline is great when you have a pike hit your jig! Last couple of trips my biggest pikes were caught on an ultralight with Fireline. This years trip will find fome Northlands walleye mono and braid, just for the fun of trying something new! Part of the fun is trying new lines and jigs to match the lake and conditions!"
1390637,fishincrazy,2012-02-06 15:43:00,1282,I like Fireline and power pro.I have used in the past Berkley sensation and that worked well for jigging I like the braids though for all around walleye fishing.FC
1390651,Pikehunters,2012-02-06 16:26:00,100,It is a personal preference but each lake & structure will tell you what the safest line to use so you can get the big one in the boat. I was strictly a mono guy until i used braided. I now save alot of $$ not loosing lures with braided line!!!
1390663,pantherdev,2012-02-06 16:46:00,192,I use 20# PP with a flourocarbon leader for jigging and any flat line trolling I do. The eyes are 85 to 95 feet deep right now and it is very easy to set the hook with braid.
1390675,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-06 17:28:00,129,yep its all a personal preference I normally don't jig too deep but my normal jigging line is 10lb Fireline crystal.
1390708,Bigstorm,2012-02-06 18:19:00,799,"I must be old fashioned, prefer mono for jigging. A lot of my jigging is in rivers/current areas so staying veritcal for jigging wont work so I prefer mono to give it a little stretch when I'm trying to get it out of the rocks"
