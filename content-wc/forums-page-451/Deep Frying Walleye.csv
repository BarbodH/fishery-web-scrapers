1314607,WalleyeCrazy2,2011-06-04 18:32:00,29,"Corn Meal, a little flour, Lowerys, wet fillets, use a fish batterer. Oil @ 375 in a large cast iron skillet. Best ever."
1385219,maddogg,2012-01-23 18:20:00,178,"Do you want to eat breading or fish?I cook my scaled fish on the BBQ skin side down and basted with butter,garlic,and a little lemon juice. Don't flip them over!"
1385315,Limeyangler,2012-01-23 22:53:00,563,Elway...use eggwash.Wet fillets.....coat with flour......then dip in eggwash...then coat with your seasoned coating....make sure oil is hot hot but wont burn on contact...thats all!I do mine like this.......http://youtu.be/66svEf3n_gA
1392818,octanehi5,2012-02-11 10:27:00,1104,"Most of the time we fry Walleye we put them in a thick beer batter, hot peanut oil; very crispy To die for"
1392859,FrankLeigh,2012-02-11 12:59:00,80,"The only problem with cooking walleye like that is that everybody burns their fingers trying to pick them out of the oil, because they can't wait. lolFrankLeigh"
1392888,ohiojmj,2012-02-11 14:28:00,1262,"Wow, didn't realize it was that hard. I scramble a few eggs in a bowl, toss in walleye filets, roll in Zatarain's, toss in canola oil at 375F, take out in a few minutes. Crispy, flavorful yet not caked up with grease filled batter or pancke dough. I've skipped the eggs and just rolled the damp filets in Z's. Substitute Z's with Fry Magic or dozens of other flour/corn powder types coatings, but make panckaes in the morning or coat the skenky catfish caught and frozer in 2008."
1392961,octanehi5,2012-02-11 17:51:00,1104,"You got that right frank. We keep a good sized frying pan in the boat with beer of coarse,jug of peanut oil,filet knife,One guy builds fire, the other filets and mixes beer batter. a better shore lunch you will not have"
1392964,octanehi5,2012-02-11 17:56:00,1104,If the batter you use is greasy after you fry them the oil is not hot enough. the peanut oil get about the hottest of most of the oils before it burns.
1393910,djcoop52,2012-02-13 17:00:00,1411,"If you want a thick coating make your own. Flour, egg, beer, and salt and pepper or seansonings of your choice. The thicker the consistency of the batter the thicker the coating will be. This is what I did for years no I like less batter and use Uncle Bucks original and love it."
1394062,goldman,2012-02-14 00:08:00,1036,"I used to have trouble keeping the breading on the filet's while cooking, until someone told me to omit the salt from the flour mixture. I started leaving out the salt and it made a world of difference. Now I salt them after their cooked. We normally just give them a light flour coating anyhow.Paul"
1313905,rpieske,2011-06-02 11:00:00,1276,"Here is the best way I have found. Pat your fillets dry, coat them with a dry seasoned flour mix like Andy's, dip them in an egg wash and then press them into Panko Japanese Bread crumps. Let set a few minutes and fry in HOT oil till they float. You can season the coated fillets again if you like before or after frying. Ummmm Good!!!"
1313918,micropterus,2011-06-02 11:20:00,450,"Walleye does not need a heavy batter. I had some Cod once, it needs a heavy batter. It is probably illegal to eat walleye with heavy batter in some parts of of Canada."
1313995,MikeMcC,2011-06-02 15:09:00,72,"Be sure oil is 350-375 degrees, in between batches let oil heat back up again. Peanut oil is good because of its high smoke point. I have overcooked some while waiting for them to float. I prefer to cook them only 2-3 minutes to avoid overcooking/mushy fillets."
1314005,NYBowHunter,2011-06-02 15:46:00,35,All this talk is making me real hungry!!! Need to tighten a line or two this weekend!!
1314070,Fishin Fun,2011-06-02 19:46:00,218,"We use Rocky Madsen's Fish Crisp. It is soooooo goooooood. I can't find it anywhere I've looked here in Minnesota. The only place I've been able to find it is at the grocery store in Red Lake. I won't use anything else now. The fish batter does get crisp, but it isn't think. We usually deep fry our walleye in peanut oil. Now Cabelas carries cottonseed oil and that's good too."
1314178,NWwalleye,2011-06-03 06:37:00,223,"When out doing a shorelunch for clients, I use this trick to make sure that my oil is hot enough .. They love it ... I throw a self-igniting wooden match ( white end on tip ) in the cold oil . Put pan or deep fryer on heat ( wood or propane ).. The match will ignite when the oil hits 325 degrees F .. Viola !!! Oil is ready for cooking . Great way to get the oil to the right temp without the use of a thermometer ."
1314216,Dacotah Eye,2011-06-03 08:28:00,2722,I just stick a wooden match into the oil once in a while until it lights. Same thing my folks would do sixty years ago.
1314237,lassh,2011-06-03 09:33:00,553,"The key to getting the batter to stick to the fish is the first coating of dry batter mix. Pat dry the fillets then flop them onto a plate that has a layer of dry batter mix. This could be complete pancake mix, corn starch, flour, bread crumbs etc. Then go ahead and drench in egg/beer or egg/milk mix. Then in your batter mix. The dry product helps the egg mix stay on the fillet and the egg mix keeps the outer coating of batter on the fillets."
1314358,elway12,2011-06-03 16:43:00,335,Thanks to everyone for the great tips. I can taste the fresh walleye now! Only 5 weeks to go.
1314538,camp chef,2011-06-04 11:42:00,915,We have spent years trying to perfect a THIN coating.Why would you want more breading on Walleye fillet?
1313666,elway12,2011-06-01 20:37:00,335,"Sorry if this was covered in earlier posts. I have a tough time getting my breading to have a thick ""coat"" on my walleye fillets. How do you guys get good crusts on your fish? Here's what I have done so you have an idea of my mistake(s). I usually use stuff like Uncle Bucks, I dip the cleaned fillets in the dry powder and then into the oil. Should I dip the fish in egg wash first? I have also tried using pancake mix with similar below average results."
1313670,Jack77,2011-06-01 20:55:00,168,"try this- pat dry fillets and coat in light flour- dip in egg wash - egg yolks w/ splash of milk- finish with your favorite coating mix* the flour allows the egg to stick and the egg allows the coating to stickor-pat dry fillets and coat in light flour- finish with your favorite beer batter recipe* this will provide you with a pretty thick coating and is what you find a lot of restaurant fried fishI prefer less coating on my fish so I don't use either method, here is what I have used and it is pretty good-soak fillets in beer and mustard marinade for about 30 minutes- coat with Drakesor -simply put damp fillets in drakes and fry. This is how we do shore lunch along with fried potatoes and busch's baked beansThere is a section on the forum that just has walleye recipes that you may want to check out."
1313698,Leeches,2011-06-01 22:10:00,106,Jack77 is right recipes are on here somewhere I've tried a few and they were all pretty good!
1313727,Juls,2011-06-02 04:37:00,13414,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=162860The walleye recipe thread is stickied to the top of the general discussion board. I pat dry my fillets and then put them through an egg white/ heavy cream/splash of water wash and then throw them in a zip lock with my favorite seasoned breading, and shake to coat. (handful at a time) I pile them on a plate and let sit until the moisture of the egg wash moistens the breading. Then fry in peanut oil....it gets super crispy this way.I do not like a really thick breading either, but do like a crispy one. Juls"
1313751,speckeye,2011-06-02 06:18:00,61,"Any batter or wash containing yolk brings oil into the food-at any temp.If you want CRISPY,use egg white,it's water soluble and prevents oil penetration of the food.Or,for a nice thick coating,try buttermilk as a wash.My .02."
1313784,Bill Krejca,2011-06-02 07:22:00,6107,"Jack, The way I see it, there are 2 kinds of batter- dry and wet. The dry batter is one made up of powdery ingredients and the wet is soupy. If you want a thicker coating, use the wet batter. It will result in a much thicker coating. You can use beer, or water or some other wet substance. The usual mix is to add the water, or whatever, until the stuff just drips through a fork. I don't like to admit it, but I will use the wet mixture on those rare? times when we have a minimal amount of fish - results kinda like what you get with ""popcorn shrimp"" - it makes it look like there is a lot more there, when in fact it consists of quite a bit of just breading. Also, if a little baking powder is added to the mix, the crust will be even thicker. Happy eating. Bill Krejca"
1313798,Sutsgold,2011-06-02 07:34:00,219,"Elway, a simple solution is to make sure your oil is hot enough. Mine is hot enough that when i place the fish in it almost seals it immediatly. Remember that as you add fish the temp of your oil will decrease, so go slow."
1313845,Mike Kansas,2011-06-02 09:00:00,1463,Something that has worked good for us is use Condensed Milk in your egg milk batter. It is sticky and really helps the breading stay on the fish.
1313850,tikka_t3,2011-06-02 09:12:00,14,If you are doing the frying at home another trick is to bread the fillets and then put them in the fridge for about 2-3 hours the batter stays on way better!
1313864,Hawkfan,2011-06-02 09:50:00,237,"Double dip it. Use a wet batter and fry just long enough to set the batter on the fish. Then take it out, shake the excess oil off, dip in the batter again and fry til golden."
