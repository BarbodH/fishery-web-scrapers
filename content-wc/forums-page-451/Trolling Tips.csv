When single rod Trolling for Walleye on Lac Seul I like to let out enough line until I feel the bottom and than reel in some line so I know I'm down where I need to be for the eyes. I also like to have my line directly in the prop wash. I believe this gives the lure some added action because of the prop turbelence. I also will pull the rod tip towards me and drop it back on occasion to add to lures action. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1395174,Pikehunters,2012-02-16 10:28:00,100,"Using the rod move the lure in & out of prop wash, towards weed edge the back into prop wash has enticed the bite on slower days. Slow days need eratic baits. If possible have the guy in the front of boat cast deep into weed beds & pull the fish out. typically the trolling bait will get the hookset."

1396161,drlee,2012-02-18 18:44:00,409,"Wow, Mike...loved your comments. My grandpa was a great walleye fisherman...his favorite was Ottertail Lake near Fergus Falls, MN. Trolled with minnow, single hook, trolling sinker, spinner blade (lil' Joe). His guide, Clarence, marked the edges of the sand bars or reefs with a long cane pole and then threw in 1 gal. gas cans with cord and heavy lead. Grandpa always swept his rod forward then let it fall back for increased action. I love to jig for walleyes, and that has become probably the single most popular way to fish them. But, I still love to troll, just like Grandpa Riter. BTW, I am referring back to the late 50's and early 60's! Wooden boats, ribbed floors, narrow, 5 hp motors. Northerns were ""junk fish."" Perch also. I now fish northern Ontario 4 weeks each summer and spend a fair amount of time trolling the ""old way."" Interesting: I see more people using the trolling method I have described above in recent years. Anyway, thanks for triggering the memories."
1396213,DavidKuhlmann,2012-02-18 21:21:00,129,Yeah the stalling tactic either while straight long line trolling or moving in an erratic S pattern which surges the bait triggers strikes. One other thing to remember most big fish are caught while trolling in the upper 1/3 of the water column. This goes for just about anywhere. Try it you will be amazed at how well it does for you. My PB (fish in avatar) came on Erie with the bait at 5' down over 42' of water and most of the fish were at 30-35'. I never see any fish in that shallow area that I troll the one or two that I pull that shallow but I just about always catch my biggest fish of the trip on one of those lines.
1396259,Mike Kansas,2012-02-19 06:21:00,1463,Thanks for your comments. I remember those old ribbed boats and that 5 HP motor that took us a long time to get from spot to spot. I also remember our old rope depth finder that had a weight on the end and knots tied in every two feet that we would lower over the side and count the knots on the way up. Those were great old days. I just wish some of the guys I fished with then were still here and could see how it's done today. Mike Kansas
