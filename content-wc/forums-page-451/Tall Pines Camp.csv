1393485,1jtfish,2012-02-12 19:46:00,3,HiMy son and I stayed at Tall Pines this last June in the last week of June. I loved the camp Steve and Andrea Grupe the owners were fantastic! The fishing was slow at the time for walleye due to the weather and mayfly hatch. Since we were struggling to find them Steve took us out and showed us what to do that made our trip. They are very family oriented resort and work hard to please you.

Didn't take the kids, but Steve has always been great about suggesting specific areas on the lake and techniques.Best luck has come from pulling spinners or thowing light jigs. We use a lot of minnows, but some have great luck with gulp, etc. We didn't have much luck for perch, but Ruby (shallow body in SW part of lake(s)) is supposed to be a good spot. We've been very happy with Tall Pines and will be heading back for our third year the week of June 9."
