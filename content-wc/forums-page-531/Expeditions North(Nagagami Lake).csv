I was supposed to fly in to Expeditions North 2 weeks ago but 1 hour after arriving in Hornepayne, I received an emergency phone call from home and had to drive back the following day. After taking care of business back home, I called David to discuss the possibility of me flying in mid-week to meet up with my buddies. He could not have been more obliging. He arranged a special plane to fly in some camp supplies so I could hitch a ride and was able to enjoy 3 days of fabulous walleye fishing. I want to thank David for helping me out and making my 2010 fishing trip possible."
