1211785,Jahloaf,2010-06-20 10:26:00,74,I've seen plenty of threads about taking beer into Canada and duty and such but what are the rules for how much beer you can bring back into the states? What is the duty cost if you are over the limit?
1211797,go dart,2010-06-20 10:52:00,77,just stay until the beers all gone. then come home
1211820,Jimmy Jig,2010-06-20 13:07:00,1905,Same as going in; 24 bottles per person. Do not know the duty if over.
1211834,v-bay gord,2010-06-20 14:49:00,3168,"I had to pay something like $1.20 a case when I brought a few along on my pheasant hunting trip last year. It is unlikely they will ask if you are bringing any alchohol back, and unless asked, I would not volunteer the information."
1211835,Bill Krejca,2010-06-20 14:50:00,6107,"In the last 50 years or so, I can't remember anyone having enough left over for it to be a concern In fact, I can't remember the custom folks even considering it to ask either! Bill Krejca"
1211940,Whopper,2010-06-21 05:39:00,340,"Not true, the magic words are when they ask you if you have anything to declare. I was checked last fall coming across in Detroit and wasn't forthcoming on a bottle of liquor and got the third degree from the custom agent."
1211955,v-bay gord,2010-06-21 06:50:00,3168,In that case you are correct......always answer truthfully to a direct question.
1212069,Whopper,2010-06-21 10:51:00,340,"Yep, lesson learned and I almost guarantee I'll be checked the next time I cross over. I've always declared any beer or liquor going either direction, sometimes I been made to pay duty sometimes not, no good reason why I didn't the last time but I won't do it again."
1212122,Obabikon,2010-06-21 13:11:00,2370,There's lots of people who bring the good beer back after their trip! Unpastorized beer.
