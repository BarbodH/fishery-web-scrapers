Thank you David, Mark and Adam for your hospitality and service. Caught lots of Walleyes with many in the 23"" to 27"" range. The last night of fishing we dropped our lines and nailed a double... a 24"" and 26"" eye....what a way to start the last night of fishing. Weather was great... few days of clouds, a day of rain, and a couple of days of sunshine. It really didn't affect the fishing as much as it affected the fishermen. Bugs were non-existent with the exception of the mayflies but that didn't seem to bother the fish. Can't wait until next year...already counting the weeks til then. :-) Will put pictures in the gallery.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hp?albumid=516"

I was more than thrilled with the selection of Expeditions North and second your praise of the effort Dave, Mark and Adam did. It is a great camp. The lake is smaller than what we used to fish, which took out some of the adventure for us, but we still had one guy in our group get lost on the lake (not sure how). The fish seemed to be everywhere on the breaks and transition areas. My brother and I caught several fish each day (around 30-50 for the boat), but nearly half were over 20"". The big fish for us this week was 27"" with each person in the group getting at least a 25+ incher. We were surprised at how thick the fish were. My brother commented that they resembled ""Erie"" Walleye in mass. We had a great time that's for sure and are already planning on next year's trip. Thank you for your post last year and maybe we'll see you next year. Steve Ehle"
