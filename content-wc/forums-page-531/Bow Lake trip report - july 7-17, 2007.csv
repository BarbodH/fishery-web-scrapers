1212712,rayjef,2010-06-22 20:47:00,5,"Phish, We are going up July 17-24. Will appreciate any help. Have never been this far up in Canada and not quite sure what strategies are best for Bow. Taking my son and a couple of friends who have never fished in Canada. Just want to make it a great first time for them! Thanks again.Jeff"
1213122,phishfearme,2010-06-24 05:41:00,1242,"this is an email that i send to another guy asking about bow lake (which i'd gladly send to you, with attachements, if you'd first drop me an email): i think bow will provide a wonderful trip for your group - the cabin is very large, the cooking arrangements are wonderful (check with dwight and karen about the oven status - we've used the propane grill in the past as an oven), boats and motors are terrific, the lake is VERY large (long) and there's a nice sand beach available (see map). something to recognize - there's 4 sets of bunks in the cabin which requires people to sleep in upper berths if you have more than 4. this could be tough for some older or less agile people. you may be able to set up beds on the floor though if need be. there's two main secrets to successful walleye catching there: fish the rockpiles and fish the flow areas!! each boat MUST have portable sounders to not only find the rockpiles but find where the edges are - this is where you'll catch most all of you walleye. and fortunately there's numerous rockpiles in the lake as well as islands that are surrounded by boulders/rocks - all excellent walleye habitat - fish around ALL of the islands. and, you'll catch 95% of you fish in less than 10 ft of water - you'll probably find that 7ft is the sweet spot. much of the lake is flat and featureless - don't waste your time here - but right where the rockpiles start are real hot spots. recognize also that the rockpiles are remnants of eskers from the ice age and the rocks tend to be round - almost any lures/jigs/weights dropped in them will become snagged - so fish verticle about a foot or two off the bottom. in our first trip, we all ran out of jigs!! the other areas that usually produce walleye are the ""flow areas"" such as: - ""moose crossing"" (see map - there's also a deep hole - 20ft - just outside the moose crossing but we've never had much luck in and around it), - the inlet of the otoskwin river (lots of fast water that should be hit daily - some days there'll be nothing then a school comes in and you can have some truly excellent days - all in less than 7ft of water, - towards the outlet there are a number of ""swifts"" that usually produce nice catches - at the very outlet of the lake there's a 90deg right turn thru a swift to a very deep hole (20ft) that has produced a couple of trophies for us - and just below the deep hole at the outlet there's whitewater rapids where we've parked the boat and walked downstream to below the rapids, waded in and had field days - the inlet of the bow river can be tough to get to (shallow with a poorly defined channel) but this is also a good spot. our typical day would find us miles from the cabin during the day, back to the cabin for happy hour/dinner then out to ""O in Bow"" and ""Below the B in Bow"" rockpiles (areas 1 and 2 on the rockpile map) for evening fishing up until dark - see map for locations. these are the closest rockpiles to the cabin - the cabin is located at the west side of the lake, not the most geographically desirable location. we've had some truly wonderful evenings at these piles - we try to avoid them during the day so they're ""fresh"" in the evening. the other rockpiles are a longer boat ride. anchor up on the rockpiles and let out line such that the wind will position the boat right over the rockpile edge. move around to find where the fish are. also, throwing rapalas over the tops of the piles at night is a blast also. concerning portaging and why we do it - first, we go on 10 day trips so we have time and second, these portage lakes/rivers can produce incredible non-stop action for hours. we've had a number of 100 fish per person days at bow but only on the portages. getting 50 walleye a day on the main lake is good - but the main lake can produce trophies, the portages only rarely produce anything over 24inches. the portage up to the otoskwin river above the inlet rapids is worth trying - although it's about a mile long. there's a boat there with motor but you'll have to bring gas, paddles?, life jackets? and all your tackle/food for the day. there's a pool right at the top of the portage that has produced really good fishing but traveling up river about 3-4 miles though puts you at the narrows where engler lake creek empties into the otoskwin river - this narrows has produced field days - both below and above the narrows. however, one year we went there when the water was very high and fast and it was not very good at all. if you find the fishing in bow not to your likeing, ask dwight to fly a pair of you into shinagmabin lake for a day and fish around the north end of the island (just below the 349 on the map), INCREDIBLE fishing there. dwight has a boat/motor there and we have a canoe stashed there if you're willing to bust the bush. his plane can only take one of you at a time but the flights are short and within an hour two of you will be in walleye heaven. he'll probably charge something like $100 each for this - but it will produce a memorable day. see map. for pike - you'll catch lots of pike if you troll the shorelines with spoons or jigs - but don't expect any trophies (40inchers). we've spent 30 days on this lake and have one 34incher and a few 31 inchers and loads of hammer-handles. i just think this lake is too shallow to hold a large population of jumbo pike. one more thing - stop at vern's minnows in ignace and get a flat of crawlers. you'll do well with twisters - but you'll do excellent with crawlers. hope that gives you some good starting places be happy to answer other questions. and i can cut a DVD of the video i took on our last trip of the inside of the cabin if you like."
567527,phishfearme,2007-07-19 15:32:00,1242,"we just returned from our third 10 day ""week"" at bow lake using North of 51 Outposts (formerly Albany River Outposts). The trip can best be summarized as ""the lousy weather continues"" and the water level is still incredibly high. If you've been reading many trip reports from NW ontario for the last month and a half or so, there's been a preponderance of bad weather reports - well it continued for us. Cloudy, windy, rainy and cold every day except the last day when the threat of rain stopped but the wind continued. we were frequently forced to hide in the lee of an island many many times which seriously put a crimp on fishing time. Two days we were literally blown off the lake. the lake water level from the otoswin river is also so high that there is NO shoreline anywhere around the lake. and to top things off, it had fallen 2 verticle feet (!!) the weeks before we got there! highest most of the locals can remember. we did however manage to get into some nice size walleye - largest being gary's 25 1/2 incher with about 6 others between 22 1/2 and 23 1/2 - and also got some reasonable numbers when we were able to either anchor the boat or control it over the numerous rock piles. pike, as expected were pretty small (this lake should not be considered for pike fishermen) but they're certainly numerous. we did one portage trip up to the otoswin river where they have a new boat and motor stashed but the extreemly high and fast water made things extreemly tough so instead of the expected (based on the last two trips) 150 - 200 walleye, we only got 30 and they were tough to find. we did see a cow moose and two calves closeup - a real treat. over the past winter, the previous owner of albany river outfitters sold the business to dwight and karen monck who were our hosts last year. dwight and karen have renamed the business and have done numerous improvements at bow (and the other outposts) including a screened in porch, a screened in fish cleaning house with running water and a boardwalk from the cabin to the boats. they also have more plans to improve and open other camps in the near future. they are excellent and enthusiastic outfitters and i highly recommend them to anyone. they also have been able to keep their cost down thanks in part to the very short flights involved (6 minutes for bow lake) and provide one of the best deals in fly-in fishing anywhere in NW ontario - we had all the fresh ice and water we wanted. you can see my previous reports at:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...2922&mode=full any questions? feel free to ask. phish"
567528,IaDave,2007-07-19 15:49:00,476,"Phish- Anytime you go to Canada the weather is a crapshoot even in July. Knowing Bow Lake if the wind is blowing a certain direction,I think the east, it blows down the entire length of the lake. I'm glad to hear the new owners are putting money back into it and making the improvements. Do you know if he has done anything to Otaskwin? I have been to 3 of the lakes and that by far is the best but the cabin is small. Hope to get there again-maybe next year."
567535,phishfearme,2007-07-19 17:22:00,1242,"dave - yah, i hear you about the weather but this years seems to be much much worst than the usual. they told me that there were only two days in june without rain - and july isn't going much better. you should see the rapids coming outta otoskwin lake into froats lake - pretty much no visible rocks!! don't know if they've done anything to the otoskwin cabin yet but i'm sure they have some plans - drop them an email, karen is pretty good about responding. they said they're gonna update their site as new lakes become available and new modifications are made. thanks for the post. phish"
