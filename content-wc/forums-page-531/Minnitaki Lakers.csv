We've always caught large numbers of walleye and pike if we wanted, but I thought I'd look for something a little different. This year (late July) after we load up on walleye, I'd like to catch a lake trout or two for a little variety.For those of you that have fished lakers on Minnitaki in the summer (without downriggers) how would you attempt it? 3 way rig with large weight, leadcore, drop shot, vertical jigging, etc.???I've got most gear you'd assume a walleye guy would own (and more if you ask my wife), so I'm just looking to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks"

1212049,RyanG,2010-06-21 10:09:00,16,Last year we stayed at Abrahms Lake Resort and the owner sent us to Vermillion for Trout.We spent 2 hours there and blindly caught 2 trout on bottom bouncers and spinners.Not too bad for never fishing it before and its not too far away.
