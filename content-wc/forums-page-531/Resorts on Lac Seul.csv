Thanks[/QUOTE We will be at lost Island next week for our fifth straight year. Have been on Lac Seul for 20+ years and have stayed at a total of six resorts and I rate Lost Island as #1 overall. Great service, great accomadations, great boats and they will work hard to put you on fish. We take our wives with us and they love it too. Mike Kansas"

1210827,fire105,2010-06-16 19:35:00,40,"mooselodge is great ,Colin knows his fishing but youre limited to were you can go.If you want to fish Lac Seul you will have to shoot the rapids (use Colin to guide you through). The lakes south of the Rapids a large and it will take more than a week of fishing to cover these lakes. But then how much lake can you cover when you go to lost island."

The following is what one of them had to say Ruth and I stayed at Moosehorn in Sept and had a great time. The accommodations were first rate and the staff did everything to make our stay enjoyable. Our guide was Ben Beattie and I can't say enough about how hard he worked. We caught over a hundred walleye the first day and then spent 2 more days chasing muskie. Ben suggested we push back the departure time in the morning so we could fish later in the evening. The kitchen staff had our suppers waiting for us in the cabin when we returned each night. Can't say more than that for being helpful. We plan to go back in the near future ... just got a few other things on the 'bucket list' to do first. LOL P.S. .... catching a 45"" muskie at boat side on a topwater was a bonus I won't forget. Don"
