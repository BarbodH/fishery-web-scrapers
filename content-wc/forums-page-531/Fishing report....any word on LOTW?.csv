1212408,dcraven,2010-06-22 06:43:00,47,"Just got back yesterday. Fished over the weekend. We caught and released about 75 walleyes/sauger on Saturday. Most fish were smaller and in about 12 feet of water - saddles between islands and on points. A few on humps. Fished mainly the Miles Island area. Bugs were heavy and the fish were caught up off the bottom a bit (feeding on mayflies as the larvae move towards the surface) - from the bottom to four/five feet up. We used jigs and Berkley Gulp!, plus leeches and night crawlers. Sunday we had seven muskies hit and landed four. These fish were about 34 to 44 inches in length.DC"
1212507,nicko,2010-06-22 10:28:00,508,awesome.....where did you find the Musky? weedlines? what were they hitting on? Bucktails?
1212666,scotttheguide,2010-06-22 18:38:00,73,"Fishing is great. Mayfly hatch never slowed them down, if anything it made it more fun catching good walleyes in 2 - 4' of water. Over the last 5 days my guests have boated several over 27"". They have also caught several Pike around 40"". Including one today out of the boat at shorelunch.I was even out the other day when we had the big wind day. 4 1/2 plus foot rollers in Regina. Hit those coming out of reed narrows. But we caught lots of fish.The fish are still every where, caught them this morning in 5' and this afternoon in 30'.Come on up!"
1212688,dcraven,2010-06-22 19:55:00,47,"Muskies were hitting bucktails/spinnerbaits in the weeds - shallow, junky weeds. The sloppier, the better.... That's the only place we could find ANY action."
1212739,nicko,2010-06-22 22:14:00,508,Packin the boat now.....Leaving first thing Saturday morning. Keep the reports coming. Saturday won't come fast enough. Thanks....Nick
