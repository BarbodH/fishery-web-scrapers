1212145,KevinSB,2010-06-21 14:22:00,73,"A buddy and I (each from Illinois) graduated from a few annual WI trips to our first Canadian trip. We stayed at Steve and Andrea's Tall Pines Camp on Lake Wabaskang from 6/12 - 6/18 and couldn't have had a better time. Facilities and boat were great, and most importantly the fishing was very good.Weather most days involved clouds and a little rain, which brought good fishing. We had only one tough day of fishing (Wednesday), with high temps, clear skies, and no wind. We caught plenty of eyes, fought off the northern, and even caught a few smallies. We ate four walleye meals and managed our catch to bring home limits for a fish fry at home this past Saturday. We pulled lots of spinners with minnows but also pitched jigs and tried the occasional worm and leech (minnows were best for us).In summary, we really had a great experience for our first Canadian fishing trip. Wabaskang was a winner for us, as was Tall Pines Camp. No disrespect to any other Wabaskang camps, but I fully expect we'll return to Tall Pines again next year. Steve and Andrea were great.Kevin"
