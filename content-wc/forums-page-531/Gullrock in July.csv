Was there in the early 90's in Sept. and had fantastic walleye fishing. That time of year would still be my first choice, but can't do it this year. What can I expect hunting walleyes and northerns in July? I know this is probably not a normal year so far, weather wise, but what year is. Thanks!"

We are heading up there July 10-17 this year. We stay at Southbay when we go and have been for 20 years. I've heard the other camps are very good too.

They usually get alot over 25"" but due to his health he is not able to take the trip this year.We went 2 years ago 2nd weekend in august and did about the same. IMO its fishing. If you arent catching alot of fish at point a move on and find different waters the fish will always be there you just have to find the school and fish the fish!Goin again 2nd weekend in August at 5 Lakes Lodge...CANT WAIT"
