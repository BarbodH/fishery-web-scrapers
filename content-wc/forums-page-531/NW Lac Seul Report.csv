Hopefully it will be helpful to some of you headed that way soon.We stayed at Timberlane just out of Ear Falls & had a great time (great place). Fishing was similar to 2006 when we also had an early spring.Sanctuary - Fished in the Sanctuary and all the way up to and in the rapids. Fishing was slow in there. There are small ones to be had but I'd leave it as a windy day alternative. The mouth of the Sanctuary was so-soBridge/Up river to Dam - Some of the best fishing of the week was here. Center post on the bridge, Buoy out in front of Timberlane, and up river towards the dam. (LOTS of eagles to watch up here).Goose Island - Some guys had luck here, we didn't.Steamboat Narrows - There are fish here on both sides of the narrows on the Steamboat bay side. West side is big fish, east side eaters and slot fish. I'm thinking this will heat up more in the coming days.Cox Island - Some fish off the SSE side of the Island. There is a small crescent island off the point and a few others in there worth trying.Sawmill - Not much luck here. Very good last year, but they have moved on from there already this year.Lunker - Marginal, but always worth a stop in passing just in case.Sand Island - Have had luck here in warmer times but they aren't really there yet. could be soon though.Big Sand Banks - Lots of boats fishing here. We fished it early in the week with moderate success. If you're making the trip to McKenzie, it's worth a stop.McKenzie - The last big island on the NE end of McKenzie was definitely hot. East side of the island was best.Best of luck,KT"

We still re-booked for next year. Stayed at Goose Bay. Andrea is a great host. Saw alot of people keeping fish over the slot which is surprising. Most were first year fisherman to area. May have been because the eaters were hard to find."

1211993,WalleyeWally28,2010-06-21 08:32:00,298,We're heading up a week from Friday and I'm curious about the water level. Thanks in advance for any info.
1212007,KTroller,2010-06-21 09:01:00,237,"Depths ranged from 8-14. Jig & Minnow was the go to bait, often with a 2"" or 3"" twister. Colors that worked varied.Water levels are down about a foot or slightly more."
1212240,Guest,2010-06-21 18:52:00,0,I am headed to Fisherman's Cove this Friday. Do you have any ideas on how deep we should be fishing. Are the walleyes on the rocks yet? Any tips you have would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
1212252,BenBeattie,2010-06-21 19:21:00,232,"Walleye's on Lac Seul are moving to summer structure. I've caught fish out of 30 fow already. Most fish are between 15-25' right now, some shallower some deeper but the majority are in that range. Today I caught about 20 fish from a sand hump in the middle of the basin, surrounded by 60 FOW. Not a lot, yet, but it's coming fast."
1212390,Guest,2010-06-22 06:04:00,0,I appreciate your help locating the fish. My dad and I are headed up Friday and are so very excited. It is interesting the fish are already transitioning into the summer spots. I am assuming the walleyes are more on the rocks then the weeds? Are they after any kind of bait-fish they are chasing or just moving to the summer locations? Any tips are greatly appreciated. Cheers all the best!
1212490,iowa jal,2010-06-22 09:12:00,5,"Hi,My brother & I fished NW Lac Seul last week too (6/12 to 6/18). Experienced same success as others in this thread have mentioned. We noticed some may fly bodies in the water at various spots and figured this was messing with the eating mood of the fish. Camp operator told us the lake is 3 weeks ahead of normal this year. We fished the sanctary, Wenesaga River (up to the rapids), Sawmill bay & islands around there, Goose Island, and clay banks north of the sanctuary. Many small fish caught but not in big numbers, we had to troll more than usual to find them, had a couple nice walleye (one 22"" and one 26"") which we released. Fished in water 10 to 15 foot deep mostly. Slow fishing, but still had a good time and avoided most of the wind in the later part of the week. We go back next year at about the same time in June, 2011. The countdown begins. Good Fishing to all that still will be making a trip this year. I think we left a few for you to catch.JAL"
