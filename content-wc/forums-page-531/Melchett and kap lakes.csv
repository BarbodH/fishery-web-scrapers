1212780,IRISHATTACK,2010-06-23 06:27:00,44,I am looking for some fish numbers for these two lakes. They are with www.awonakina.com . Anything related to May and early June fishing would be great.
1212810,Guest,2010-06-23 07:39:00,0,"have fished both in july and sept ;good fishing in both lakes mell is not a real deep lake west end of lake several nice underwater rock fields ,also good pike fishing around the weeds on the west end and the north shore. kap is a bit more of a challange as their is so much structure. we caught fish almost any time or any where we tried if ,,, water is high you can go upstream to the next lake but the water has to be up.See one time daves post's . Remi and Christine are great people to deal with."
