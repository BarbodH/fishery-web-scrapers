Got about 10 of that size in the same spot one afternoon. It was actually hard to get good eater size fish. It was not hot and heavy fishing like years past. We had to really work the jig to get a solid bite. Missed plenty. Lake trout was in about 20 ft on slip bobber. 36"".Caught 3 Lakers total. Two 30"" and the 36"". The smaller ones were in about 8 feet.Take care.D"
