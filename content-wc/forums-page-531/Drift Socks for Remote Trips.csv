1211564,Fishing Traveler,2010-06-19 11:45:00,19,I'm going to Pasha Lake Cabins this summer and will spend a lot of time on remote lakes. Have been tempted to invest in a drift sock for windy days. Anyone use drift socks for small boats on remote lakes? Chris

They work, but are usually not worth the hassle for drifting with the wind. Sometimes miss them, then again you have to prioritize what you can bring in and the drift socks eventually fell off the list. Might reconsider them when drifting large open water for lake trout and using jigs.Pooch"
