1210954,2746,2010-06-17 08:39:00,3206,"It's possible your right about their perception although on several occassions when we cross we are asked about guns. (I'm from Iowa) The last time I was asked if I owned a gun, then if I was carrying a gun and when I said no he asked how I intended to protect myself? I think it's just a series of questions they have learned to ask to see if they are getting the truth. Canadians are as careful about gun carriers as they are about DUI's I think."

Are you kidding about the ""How are you going to protect yourself"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's a NEW one ---- But, you are correct - they definitely don't want any guns coming in."
1210970,Kruger,2010-06-17 09:25:00,259,"I believe most times I have been asked if I was bringing a weapon in. But this was the first time each person was asked if they Owned any, if any were hand guns and how many they owned"
1211007,2746,2010-06-17 11:29:00,3206,"Nope, not kidding! It was the only time I've been ask that and he took me off guard. (probably wanted to) My wife was with me and I finally said, after a long pause, ""I guess I had not thought of that but didn't think I'd need protection in Canada"". No response or any kind of reaction. that was at a crossing out of the Falls while on a vacation."
1211009,2746,2010-06-17 11:35:00,3206,"Your comment about Alabama and guns got me thinking. I've had several friends move from Iowa to the south in retirement. S. Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi and each one of them are taken by how many people they have met that carry a weapon in their car. It's very unusual here so it caught their attention. Maybe Canadians do have that perception about certain states here. Who knows?"
1211024,Guest,2010-06-17 12:31:00,0,Unfortunately we have a very strong anti-firearm lobby in Ontario and Quebec. Luckily the western Provinces are more firearm friendly. They ask those gun questions because the Government probably wants the $45 or whatever fee they charge our friends from the south who bring in long guns for hunting purposes.
1211046,2746,2010-06-17 14:00:00,3206,"Actually Gator, I don't mind a bit and appreciate what they are doing. As I said earlier, I've never been treated badly by a Canadian agent and if someone were coming into our country I would hope they would ask about guns as well. Unfortunately for us, it's the ones coming in illeagal that create the problems and they aren't answereing any questions."
1212090,KevinSB,2010-06-21 11:51:00,73,"Just returned from a great fishing trip with solid border crossings. This was our first border crossing (at least in the last 20 years). We had two guys in one SUV packed pretty full. We had some beer (in an accessible cooler) but no tobacco. We were asked about firearms and alcohol, but were not inspected. Officers on both sides were professional yet polite.As FYI, border crossing took 20 minutes each way. We crossed into Canada from International Falls at 7am Saturday, June 12 and returned about 9:30 (also through IF) Friday, June 18.Again, a nice experience."
1210017,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-14 12:33:00,241,"Aaron-In, it does matter how we are treated,our own country should NOT treat it's citizens with rudeness and contempt!!!! There is already enough of that to go around and we don't need our Goverment Officals treating you or anyone that way!!!! There are ways to speak to people and accomplish your purpose without being rude and a BORE!!!!!!! I've been going to Canada for 25 years and always been spoken to politely( blunt and to the point) but also politely!!!! U. S. Customs could and should use a do over and Canada's Customs could teach them alot!!!!!!!!!!"
1210032,Aaron-IN,2010-06-14 13:08:00,500,"You might not want to assume it's that way across the board for everyone coming into the US. In 31 trips (soon to be 32) across the boarder I have never been treated that way by US customs, never had my rig tore apart, never even been checked. Oh, how I wish I could say the same thing about going into Canada. My guess is some US border guard was having a bad day (don't we all?). Sorry, I just think some folks just need a thicker layer of skin."
1210255,Guest,2010-06-15 07:55:00,0,"Gotta chime in on this one - 3 of us have been going to Canada every year for 1 week since 1985 - (yeah, we'ere old). We usually go the last week in June and go in on a Saturday. We always go through International Falls/Fort Francis. The disappointing part is the wait going into Canada (has been as long as 2 hours), but at least the Canada officials have some personality. Now, coming BACK into the US --- I agree with some of the other negative comments about the US officials -- they must ALWAYS be having a ""bad day"" - no respect and almost rude. Definitely a good idea about ""reporting"" them to our elected officials. We WILL be ""taking names and kicking a** this time."
1210271,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-15 08:27:00,241,"Aaron- IN, I'm 59 years old and a couple of years ago my parents went to Canada with us, on the return to the U. S. , U. S. customs let 4 "" tobin"" cars pass ,without a look, pulled my parents in and went through everything!! Acouple of old blue hairs in a mini van that has Purple Heart plates on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My Dad was wounded TWICE in KOREA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thick skin, my Rump, my folks are 80 years old!!!!! REAL BAD GUYS!!!!!! If that isn't abuse of power, What IS!!"
1210284,Golden Eagle,2010-06-15 09:26:00,2642,Unfortunately the plates might have gotten them pulled over. There are those among us who don't like our country. Some are in pretty high positions. Thanks to Dad for softening up Korea before my tour began.
1210358,2746,2010-06-15 14:55:00,3206,"35 years of crossing the border, often twice a year, and never had a problem or felt poorly treated by either Canadian or American custom agents. Never! They both have a job to do and questions to ask but I've never left feeling they were impolite. Now the USA side DNR (Minnesota I think) is a different story. Only had fish checked twice but both times.....rude, rude, rude. Guess we all have different experiences."
1210582,Blue Lk,2010-06-16 07:44:00,269,"No problems going both ways,all though when we pulled up on US side,the border agent was a very serious looking young guy with RayBans & black leather gloves,I thought Oh $h#t,this self important little pr#ck is going to be trouble,I was wrong."
1210663,davenathe,2010-06-16 11:31:00,113,"Diddo, now if we can get our elected officials to listen!! Personnelly only checked once going into Canada, never coming to USA. I just be polite and only answer questions asked."
1210933,Guest,2010-06-17 07:32:00,0,"I've crossed maybe 50 times in 30 years and even though the Canadian side has searched the vehicle a few times, they've have ALWAYS been courteous and professional. Even when they found ""contraband"" from one of the guys they were very professional. ""Sir, you're not allowed to bring in (fill in the blank). Your ____ is now forfeited to the Crown. Please sign this form and pay this fine. Have a nice day, eh."" On the other hand, the few times (2-3) the US side has searched we've been treated like criminals by some wanna-be Mall Cop with an attitude that thinks he's doing us a favor by letting us back into our own country. Most of the time the agents are professional but once in a while a Barney Fife clone is manning the check station."
1210943,Kruger,2010-06-17 08:09:00,259,"Living in Michigan for my first 35 years I crossed the border hundreds of times and never had my car searched. Now that I live in Alabama and have crossed into Canada once a year for the last 15, I have had it searched 5 times. Every time they were polite and it only took a few minutes. But I keep wondering if it has something to do with the perception of people from Alabama. The last time there were four of us and when we pulled over and got out the two customs agents asked each one of us if we owned guns, if we owned hand guns, how many guns we owned and what we used them for."
1209620,Shellback,2010-06-13 05:28:00,8083,"Just wanted to say what a pleasure it was at the Canada border crossing. I crossed 2 times and both folks at the booth were very friendly and courteous. Can't say the same for the folks on the US side of the border. Both folks were ignorant! Sure would have liked to slapped both of them up side the head! Last year the US agent was very nice. Had some not so great weather last week in Ontario, but the fishing was super! Hope to be able to make it again next year. Love your country, but couldn't deal with all that hard water in the winter time!"
1209624,Blue Lk,2010-06-13 06:12:00,269,"Me & GF are heading down by Duluth this am,(going to clean out the Black Bear Casino,LOL)hopeing to have the freindly border agents on your side of the line,I've crossed the border countless times over the years & can't say I've ever had any problems.Maybe I just jinxed myself with this post"
1209641,Shellback,2010-06-13 07:28:00,8083,"I didn't have any problems, but the US people sure weren't friendly or welcoming."
1209668,Ogoki,2010-06-13 09:21:00,291,"Like I said on another thread , the US side made us feal like criminals coming back into our own country . I was polite answered all questions as I usually do . I have crossed into Canada more than 40 times and the Canada side has always been easier. I keep my mouth shut except when asked to speak and act pleasant no matter what I feal like inside . This past friday when we crossed at a VERY SMALL border crossing I believe they were bored and need something to do .LOL .........Will keep crossing, as going to Ontario is our favorite vacation as long as we can afford it .........................Love to walleye fish , bear hunt and we REALLY enjoy the scenery .........Take the scenery away and we would not go either........."
1209682,CrossinEYES,2010-06-13 10:25:00,139,"I totally agree!!! just returned home yesterday from northern Manitoba and made it INTO Canada perfectly, very courteous and pleasant. Coming home, guy BARELY spoke ENGLISH. (Nigerian) honestly had problems understanding him, we answered everything politely etc. had to ask him to repeat what he said 3 times!! RESULT.....Got CAVITY searched pretty much only to find out the main things they were i guess suspicious of were if we had WOOD , FRUIT or PLANTS!! didnt even check our FISH!! LMAO!!! Whatever i guess, am going back again next year even with the clowns at our border!! JUST KIDDING, they are doing their job and i respect that. FISH ON!!!! Dale Frerichs Jr."
1209697,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-13 12:09:00,241,We were treated rudely by U. S. Border people ONE time and one time ONLY!!!!! I'm an ex- Marine and will not be disrepected OR intimidated by my OWN country!!!! I called Pembina and spoke with the Manager of the crossing and told him I will turn him and his cronies into my Senators and then the State Dept. if I'm ever treated that way again. His name was Mike Kennedy and he apologized for treatment and the woman offender and her side kick have never been at the window again. I am a U.S. citizen and my own country WILL NOT treat me with contempt!!!!!!!!
1209707,Ogoki,2010-06-13 13:07:00,291,"Bobbylfishermon , I am glad I am not the only one who feals this way . I truely hate that it happens though . I thought it was my attitude as I am getting older and less tolerant of this and other situations . A friend and I were discussing this and he said he is passive and just goes along . I can't just go along and see our country decline . As I stood at my Dad's grave before Momorial Day I thought how there would be an earthquake at the cemetery if people could roll over in their graves . I looked across the pavement to the soldiers graves and thought how many died to make this country great and stood up and fought for our freedom and our way of life and see it decline really hurts me . The working people who pay the taxes and try to make a difference are getting kicked in the teeth ."
1209872,CrossinEYES,2010-06-13 22:48:00,139,"After reading your post, you kind of have me thinking of doing the same thing. Calling them and complaining. Thank you for defending our Country and our FREEDOM!! FISH ON!!!! Dale Frerichs Jr."
1209889,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-14 06:11:00,151,This is the Gospel!
1209937,Aaron-IN,2010-06-14 08:19:00,500,"Seriously, does anyone really care how you get treated coming or going across the boarder? I could care less as long as I get across. You want to get treated badly by the Canadians try flying into Winnipeg with no baggage."
