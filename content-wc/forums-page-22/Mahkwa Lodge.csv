6704245,TMF89,2023-01-02 08:52:00,77,"Hey guys, my friends and I are looking at going here for our annual September fishing trip. I know there are a few threads on this place already, I read through them and just have a few more questions. I've heard a lot about how the facilities are much better than they used to be, which sounds like a very good thing, considering most peoples' opinions of them in older posts! Just wondering if anyone can talk a bit more about the 6 man housekeeping cabins. I've heard they're all one-room setups, with all the beds on one side and the living area/kitchen on the other. Is that a good description of the layout? It looks like they're all kind of set off from the main lodge area, with their own docking system? Electricity at all docks? What sort of shape is the boat ramp in (last Canadian resort we went to, I wound up having to use a different resort's ramp to trailer my boat, because the initial resort had a very shallow sand one. I have a 1775 Impact, for reference)? Anything else you guys think is worth knowing or considering about the accommodations and logistics would be great!As far as the fishing goes, it sounds like main lake structure in 15-30+' is the name of the game? Find a point or island with wind blowing into it and start trying to graph em? We normally use jigs and Gulp up there, which sounds like what most guys use. Does anyone pull spinners and crawlers that late in the season? And what about open-water trolling big cranbaits? I know the lake is notorious for killing props and lower units (like most Ontario lakes, it seems). I'm pretty experienced with those sorts of waters and know how to be careful, but if anyone has any particular spots they can think of that aren't marked but are major hazards, I'd really appreciate knowing about them! It sounds like the purple navigation trail on Navionics is relatively safe, but the rest is substantially less accurate? Are there propane canisters or buckets or jugs on most of the rocks, or are things that really scarcely marked up there?Thanks for all the information and advice guys, I really appreciate it!!"
6704253,Lmbkiller,2023-01-02 09:50:00,639,Most of the navigational markers are gone. No one keeps them up anymore. U will have to be pretty careful every time u explore new water. Lac seul ain't for rookies
6704255,JDP,2023-01-02 09:55:00,1457,"Below is a link to Mahkwa's cabin layout.As you move your curser from cabin to cabin a description appears.I have been going to Mahkwa since 2005.I have stayed in Cabins 14, 1A and 2.All have separate bedrooms as described on the cabin layout map.I have not stayed in a 6-man cabin as you describe.Cabins 3,5 and 6 have a ""Divided Layout"" which may be what you are asking about.Looks like the remaining cabins have separate bedrooms.If you call Mahkwa and inquire about availability you will be ableto get your questions answered quickly.The boat ramp is a solid concrete slab.I have never had a problem (19 foot fiberglass v-hull).There is no dock at the ramp.So, it is best if you have an assistant.There is power at all docks for battery charging.Bring a minimum 50 foot cord.Navigating is a ""at your own risk"" for sure as the water level is constantly changing.In September you will not have to travel very far from Mahkwa for walleyes.https://mahkwa.com/mahkwa-experience/"
6704329,Pooch,2023-01-02 14:47:00,4618,"Not sure I've ever seen a jug or marker on a hazard in that part of the lake and very few in the rest of LS.Navionics card shows a lot of hazards, but there are plenty that are not on the Navionics card. I would not go on that lake without a good GPS system and Navionics card. Some guys do, but I've also seen some of those same guys towed back to camp. I seldom ever run WOT unless I'm really sure of the area.Pooch"
6704715,TMF89,2023-01-04 20:29:00,77,"Thanks for the responses guys! We wound up booking the 3rd-10th of September, and we're actually staying in cabin #2. I thought I read in an old forum post from awhile ago that they had some single room cabins, glad to hear that's not the case! And thanks for the link to that map JDP, I'm not sure how I missed that on their site. I've read a lot about the navigational hazards of Lac Seul, and I do have GPS along with a Navionics card. I was hoping for some marker buoys, but I know how to be cautious, and I doubt I'll come anywhere close to WOT during the week up there! It'll be the first time the rest of my party have done a ""traditional"" Canadian trip, and I'm pretty excited for them to see how good it can really be. Thanks again."
6704725,rather-be-fishin,2023-01-04 23:07:00,429,"If it is your 1st time on Lac Seul, highly recommend hiring a guide for the 1st day of fishing. They will show you safe travel routes & put you on fish & technique’s that are working that time of year. Be prepared for winds & cooler to cold weather too. As others have said, rock hazards are NOT marked at all! Navionics map can be off by several feet too. Watch your depths & for floating logs. Water level can fluctuate A LOT! It is a Great Lake to fish & you won’t be disappointed! Good luck!!! RBF"
6705975,TMF89,2023-01-11 16:35:00,77,"Appreciate the advice! We might look into a guide, but I've spent a fair bit of time in Ontario, so I know how the rocks can come from out of nowhere. Right now the plan is to come off plane anytime we get to an area less than 40' on the map, and slow-cruise around to feel it out. I also plan on getting a new HDS Pro graph with their Live Target ducer, and I think that having it rigged up to show 50-60' in front of the boat while I cruise around at 5-10 mph will be a huge help for avoiding skeg killers! Just a question on the roads for the trip up. I found two places on Mahkwa's website that describe the gravel road to their place, one page says a mile, the other says 10 or possibly 17? Just curious which sounds right to you guys. Not a big deal, but it'll be nice to know. How are the roads in general up to Souix Lookout and through Hudson? I've gone up to Dryden every year that Canada's let me for the past 25 or so years, and I'm pretty darn familiar with the road up to Red Lake as well; so I know what to expect when it comes to Canadian roads."
6705981,Yellowfin123,2023-01-11 17:02:00,2182,"the road from hudson to mahkwa is paved but you got slow down, potholes but not to bad, gravel last mile or so"
6706601,Pooch,2023-01-14 19:58:00,4618,"Most of the roads in are paved, but lots of pot holes. The last mile or so to camp is gravel as it is maybe on the private property?? It is rough. No big deal just slow down. Fishing is worth it. I've fished Mahkwa in early September and it can really turn cold on you and I have fished same time period different year and it was the warmest trip of the summer. Brings layers and extra blankets. Cabins have little to no heat. No wood burners that I've seen. Some of the smaller four man cabins are open bay. Again, for us it's no big deal. Most of our groups worked the trades or were ex military so used to any accommodations. We go to fish and fellowship. Pooch"
