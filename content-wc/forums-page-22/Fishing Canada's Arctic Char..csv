6706305,MN_Moose,2023-01-13 06:08:00,964,I'm speechless I can offer only one word. Talented Talented in your writing Talented in your photography. Talented in your outdoor skills. I set out searching for the Polar Bear in Sutton River Specktacle. The Caribou framed by the rainbow left me speechless. Tip of the cap to your and your friend.
6706375,kona77,2023-01-13 10:40:00,236,Nicely done and thanks for sharing. Some of those Char look like fish you would only see in some type of fantasy movie. Just hard to imagine any fish with those vibrant colors.
6706409,7 Mag,2023-01-13 13:16:00,1887,Really enjoyed reading this and the pictures are awesome!
6706417,dhottle,2023-01-13 15:39:00,163,First time a saw a char mount in spawning colors I too thought it was fake. They have unreal coloration.
6706477,Moosebunk,2023-01-14 08:56:00,211,"Thank you very much sir! That Sutton write-up is by the most read on the website and for good reason, it was a fantastic trip that had all the ingredients you'd want in a remote, camp, paddle, fishing, wildlife trip."
6705379,Moosebunk,2023-01-08 20:19:00,211,"Arctic Char are one of, if not the most beautiful fish swimming in Canada's far north saltwater ocean and freshwater lakes and rivers. Chances to travel up to Nunavut in 2008 & 2011, I absolutely fell in love with everything about the lake trout and especially Arctic char found there. In 2016 after I had changed my life around a little, work perks suddenly included summertime opportunities to fish Arctic Char. It has been amazing to travel and explore North America's high arctic for these prized fish. ""A Nunavut Nomad"" is a series of 9 different stories told of my experiences for Arctic Char. A sample of all these stories plus information for trip planning, gear selection, weight calculation, and thoughts on the relationship between both Dolly Varden & Arctic Char is also included in the write-up; as these are insights into some questions more often asked by anglers who have messaged in the past. As far as it goes for Arctic Char trip reporting, photography and information, the combined work may be the most complete package to be found online, anywhere. So if Arctic Char, Nunavut and adventure interest you, take a look. FISHING CANADA'S ARCTIC CHAR.

6705443,Bill Krejca,2023-01-09 06:56:00,6107,Most beautiful fish pictures!!! Bill
6705445,prov1800,2023-01-09 07:02:00,5010,Beautifull
6705477,vteye3,2023-01-09 08:43:00,496,"Great write up x4, having been lucky enough to experience great Char fishing almost 40 years ago I absolutely love seeing your pictures. Char are absolutely stunning species. IMO Char is the most beautiful of fish species I've caught."
6705793,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-10 14:25:00,151,"Outstanding, thank you for sharing. Salvelinus hold a special fascination for me, and while my circumstances are such I will probably never fish for char, you pictures/writeup allow me a ""virtual trip"". The gaudiness of the fish make such a striking contrast with the austere beauty of the physical surroundings. Truly breathtaking. Thanks again, I know presentations such as yours requires a lot of effort, and it is appreciated."
6705815,Moosebunk,2023-01-10 18:31:00,211,Thanks guys for poking over and checking out the char stories. Spent half the day today just trying to sort out where and how the heck to get back to them this summer. Their beauty leaves a lasting impression for sure.
6705817,DeBo,2023-01-10 19:02:00,211,As always the write ups are much appreciated! Very interesting stories and the char photos are just unreal.
6705871,NM_Trout,2023-01-11 08:54:00,1094,I gotta ask... have you bumped into any bears while fishing for char? I darn near think I'd want an armed guard while I fished :-)
6706191,Moosebunk,2023-01-12 10:51:00,211,"Char... fortunately no. In Polar Bear Provincial Park we had a bear sort of sneak then casually walk by us while packing up our camp one morning after breakfast. Pictures of that are in the Sutton River Specktacle Report. Other than that, plenty black bears over the years, closest one about 18 inches from each others faces but with a tent wall between us."
