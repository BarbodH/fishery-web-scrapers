6706559,Eckohlt,2023-01-14 14:54:00,3685,Big difference I suspect?
6706563,prov1800,2023-01-14 15:09:00,5010,"I landed in NY once with a airplane and from what I saw don't think I would want to go there.Manhatten,Illinois was pretty nice."
6706597,Pooch,2023-01-14 19:46:00,4618,^^^Yep on both.......Just got my AZZ handed to me playing scrabble with MMP. Someday I'll learn to not play scrabble with a retired teacher........ maybe.Pooch
6706599,Eckohlt,2023-01-14 19:50:00,3685,Can ya take the teacher fish'n and beat up on him in the boat?
6706617,Pooch,2023-01-15 01:21:00,4618,"MMP is a she!. My wife of nearly fifty years so I'm used to it. She usually out fishes me, too. She will pick the ugliest, least desirable jig, spinner, crank, whatever and proceeds to crush what little is left of my pride.Pooch"
6706619,Eckohlt,2023-01-15 06:20:00,3685,"It's happened more than a few times when my wife is along,I'm grabbing the net more than I'm fishing."
6706623,Bill Krejca,2023-01-15 06:47:00,6107,Telling it like it is! How's the surgery recovery going? Bill
6706681,Pooch,2023-01-15 10:10:00,4618,Shoulder doing really well. PT still won't let me get back to my physical routine though. Patience isn't one of my virtues. Thanks for asking. Pooch
6706689,prov1800,2023-01-15 10:19:00,5010,Just take easy and it will heal properly.
6706145,prov1800,2023-01-12 08:40:00,5010,They seem to do quite well out there.Dinorwic sees more fisherman than Wabigoon from what iam gathering.Normally ice fishing crappies I would have more holes drilled and I would go from hole to hole and possibly catch more doing that but we had enough action and quite comfy in the shack and can carry on with some good stories.
6706155,prov1800,2023-01-12 09:05:00,5010,Just need a good hour of action.Been good on plain hair jig there lately.But the minnow option is always there.lol.
6706161,prov1800,2023-01-12 09:10:00,5010,Couple Dinorwic pics
6706283,snwblnd,2023-01-12 18:34:00,50,Paradise. I never considered using a Lindy rig ice fishing. A l/r with a floater and lively minnow might be the ticket in the meso lakes I fish. Thanks for the idea.
6706509,bobo4030,2023-01-14 10:36:00,235,"Thanks for the pictures. No safe ice in central Illinois yet. You couldn’t drag Pooch onto the ice with one of his tractors, but I’ll bet he’s drooling over that walleye."
6706513,prov1800,2023-01-14 11:20:00,5010,"Have a buddy in Manhatten,I'll that had ice on his pond for a few days but he says it's gone now."
6706519,Eckohlt,2023-01-14 12:30:00,3685,"Maybe he will invite you to Manhattan to ice fish if the pond freezes good,bring some headphones to block the noise.lol"
6706523,Fishquest,2023-01-14 12:50:00,89,"Nice fish, Thanks for the pics and report."
6706527,prov1800,2023-01-14 13:15:00,5010,I've been to his place its pretty quiete there.
6706545,Eckohlt,2023-01-14 14:19:00,3685,I would imagine it felt good to be back home from NY.
6705995,prov1800,2023-01-11 18:40:00,5010,Had a awesome day hanging out with Skywagon in his ice shack on Dinorwic.Lake is pretty bumpy so good thing it's a short ride.Nice weather but real gloomy out with bit of snow.Got to catch some really nice crappies and a few smaller walleyes.One really nice walleyes and decent pike.Pretty much didn't need heat but got a fire going in shack to get the chill out the last hour we were there.Solved a few of the world's problems.Great day.Thanks Steve.
6706005,Eckohlt,2023-01-11 18:53:00,3685,"Leading the good life goes on and on and on,another day in paradise!"
6706007,prov1800,2023-01-11 19:09:00,5010,"It's a tough life up here.We have to put up with a lot cold,snow,etc."
6706055,kettyspanky,2023-01-12 04:05:00,271,Good fishing pictures. Keep them coming.
6706099,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 06:40:00,3685,"Oh he will keep them coming,he has nothing better to do but fish non stop,maybe a coffee break now n then to rest his arms.lol"
6706105,prov1800,2023-01-12 07:01:00,5010,I will try my best.Its a grind lol Might head out to shacks tomorrow.
6706111,snwblnd,2023-01-12 07:18:00,50,"Great pictures, thanks for sharing. Are the Walleyes and Pike being caught on the same baits/lures as the crappies?"
6706113,Bill Krejca,2023-01-12 07:26:00,6107,"Life is good, lake reportedly has a large population of crappie. Bill"
6706137,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 08:26:00,3685,"I'm sure the freebies are ready to go to work for you,good luck,which you probably won't need."
6706139,prov1800,2023-01-12 08:35:00,5010,I changed up to a lindy rig with 1/4 oz split shot and a 4 ft leader and a top lip hook up on a minnow.That was a game changer.Before that had small hair jig and everything swimming through would just take a look and keep swimming.Skywagon had his live scope in shack and we could see far fish fairly far out from us.I had my hook 7 on the go to and eventually had those fish in my cone but pretty cool to see them 50 ft from your lure.
