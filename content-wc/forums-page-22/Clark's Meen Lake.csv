6705529,Bzeller19,2023-01-09 11:14:00,1,"truth8080, How was your experience at Meen Lake, and what time of year did you go? I can find a lot of reports on several of Clark’s outpost lakes, but virtually none on Meen Lake. I have a trip schedule at Meen Lake for week 1 in June this year (2023)."
6705559,Eckohlt,2023-01-09 12:27:00,3685,"So you guys will be first to report on meen when you return,always nice to read about lakes that's there's not much info on."
6705753,prov1800,2023-01-10 10:37:00,5010,Iam sure you will have a great trip even without much info.There will most likely be a guest book there like most of there outposts and it will have all kinds of info.I asked Waybe this morning how the fishing is there and he said it's great.
6705765,jambi,2023-01-10 12:33:00,504,What would he say otherwise?!?
6705775,prov1800,2023-01-10 13:01:00,5010,Probably nothing else to be said.Its a no Brainer.Flyout=fish in my experience.
6705811,Eckohlt,2023-01-10 18:03:00,3685,"If there's a group going out when your coming in,we'll that's going to be your best advise for sure,if there willing to share which most are."
6706095,kona77,2023-01-12 06:31:00,236,"Lake Name: Meen Date: June 30, 2019  July 5, 2019 This Father & Son duo was pretty ""blown away"" by the fishing on Meen Lake. They've fished some of our other lakes in the past, but this one seemed to stand out! Between the two of them, they caught 708 fish! The biggest walleye was 22 and the biggest northern was 33. A simple jig and minnow did the trick. Working the shorelines on the east end of the lake was the hot spot throughout the week. All in all a very good trip! The above report was on the Clarks website. For a number of years the Clarks posted fishing reports on their site but stopped when COVD came. Assume there could be more if you look at other dates/years. I was always able to get references from Karla/Meagan when we wanted to fish a new lake ."
6706119,prov1800,2023-01-12 07:41:00,5010,That sounds like a pretty good week to me.
