6705343,Fishquest,2023-01-08 18:08:00,89,"Nice fish, Congrats"
6705359,prov1800,2023-01-08 19:23:00,5010,Tonight Silvia put them in parchment paper and baked them with some lemon slices.Pretty good also.Just like changing it up and not use oil or breading all the time.
6705361,Eckohlt,2023-01-08 19:25:00,3685,"Silvia knows how to get'er done,I could tell by the taste of her pie."
6705365,prov1800,2023-01-08 19:30:00,5010,I'll tell Rod.We are back in business.We got the oven element we ordered yesterday and put it in.So yesterday the baking started again with zucchini bread which is a favorite of mine and tonight baked fish.Back in business.I see blueberry pies in the future.
6705375,Eckohlt,2023-01-08 19:44:00,3685,"Always nice to have a oven that works lol,Silvia puts enough blueberry's in her pie to choke a big bruin of a bear!"

6706637,prov1800,2023-01-15 07:40:00,5010,Had walleye last night night in parchment paper with some spices and couple of lemon slices.Its really good that way.Nothing like all the oil and crumbs but good to change things up especially the number of fish we get to eat.Had some greens and baked sweet potatoes with the fish.
