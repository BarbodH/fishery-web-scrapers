6708117,chunger21,2023-01-20 10:01:00,11,"Hello, We are considering going to Gangler's or Cree Lake this year. I see in your post you have been to a handful of Gangler's Outpost. We are considering SN, Bain and Clifton outposts. It sounds like you have fished them all and was wondering if you could tell me which one you thought was best for trophy numbers for pike. We haven't fished for trout in the past but would like to try a little this year but our main focus will be trophy pike. Any info on the Gangler's outpost would be much appreciated. Not sure if you have ever fished Cree Lake, but if you have how would you compare the fishing to Gangler's. Any input would be much appreciated. Thanks Corey"

6457302,Bstar,2020-06-26 13:40:00,564,We're looking at going to one of their outposts in 2022. Which one would you suggest?
6457306,pike50plus,2020-06-26 13:45:00,584,"I ahve fisshed Clifton, Maria and Stevens-Nicklin, this would have been my first to Bain which sound similar to SNpm me"
6457362,emma17,2020-06-26 15:25:00,436,"Glad they took care of you. I'm curious, was September a bad time for your calendar or do you prefer to fish July/August? I'm asking as I have a similar decision to make."
6457784,LoDo,2020-06-27 16:17:00,721,I'm not sure you're going to a have decision to make.
6457904,bthomas3333,2020-06-27 20:15:00,465,"My humble opinion. It depends on the lake and target species.If the lake is clear / deeper containing lake trout/pike I would take Sept and not consider Late July or Early Aug. If the lake is shallower / stained and more pike/walleye I would consider taking July/Aug.It isn't that a guy won't catch fish, in my experience, but when the trip is $$$$ I want to fish prime time and Sept is def prime time on Trout/pike water. Just my 2 cents.B"
6458252,pike50plus,2020-06-28 20:11:00,584,"Bain, SN, Clifton and Maria all have deep ans shallow areas SN and Bain and Clifton will also have great walleye fishing, SN and bain better for grayling"
