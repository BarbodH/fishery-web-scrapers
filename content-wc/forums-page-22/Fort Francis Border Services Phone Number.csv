6705925,JohnWF,2023-01-11 12:07:00,129,Been trying to contact Fort Francis Border Services Office. 416-973-8027 goes to voice mail and the mailbox is full. 416-973-3239 is a non-working number. I got these #'s from the Border Services web site. Tried 800-461-9999. The agent in Toronto was helpful but could not fully answer my questions. He referred me to the Fort Francis Border Services Office. Anyone out there have another phone # for the Fort Francis Border Services office? Thanks. John
