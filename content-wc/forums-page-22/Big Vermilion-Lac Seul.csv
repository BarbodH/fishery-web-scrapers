6707429,elkman99,2023-01-17 19:35:00,180,"Definitely plan on getting something booked very soon. Good to know that the muskies are spread throughout the system on the southeast side. Have you seen any in or near Lost Lake? Also, how is the musky fishing pressure on both systems? Thanks again for the insight."
6707449,prov1800,2023-01-17 20:42:00,5010,There's muskies from the pelican rapids all the way back to Deception.great action all around the island with the old POW camp.cant remember the name of it.The Manitou rapid are is also very good.
6707675,x4flatfish,2023-01-18 16:08:00,319,"I have not caught one in Lost Lake, but very near. As stated above, musky are present from Pelican Rapids on downstream. As far as pressure, yes it increases every year. As word has gotten out about the fishery over the past decade or so, many fisherman are targeting musky on Lac Seul. There are now many guides that only book Musky trips now."
6707759,prov1800,2023-01-18 20:07:00,5010,So years ago I would come to Sioux and my old railroad buddies would rake my fishing.Mostly muskie.We would normally make our first stop around the Manitou rapids then through Rags and make our way around the POW camp island and did very well and the first leg of the Devils Elbow.Did catch fish there and some good ones.Fished on my own once and fished from Deception and went into hole in the wall but was told nothing was in there.well here's a tip.Its loaded with the most awesome wedding bed I ever seen and loaded with easy to catch walleyes and of course bunches of muskies feeding in there on them walleyes and perch and pike.If you get there try it.but that whole area from launch is great.Up the zig/zag to.
6706475,elkman99,2023-01-14 08:12:00,180,"Hoping to get a little bit of info from the folks that fish the Sioux Lookout area. We pretty much strictly musky fish and are looking to try some new areas this summer. Looking at staying on Big Vermilion or at Lac Seul Resort on Lost Lake to fish Lac Seul this year. We love fishing trout water for musky so Big Vermilion has caught our eye. i have heard several different reports on this lake. Some say its a numbers lake, while others say that it holds some tankers. We definitely like quality over numbers of fish. Lac Seul definitely is a trophy lake which fits the bill for us, but not sure I want the boat ride every day to get to the better areas to fish from Lac Seul Resort. How far are the Rags and Devils Elbow from that camp? The southeastern section is where we would be musky fishing. Any help would be much appreciated!"
6706501,Yellowfin123,2023-01-14 10:13:00,2182,"somebody will probably chime in but the first thing i would do for where your staying and the SE waters you want to venture into, i would go directly to the main man guide BEN BEATTIE, he's the pro! nice guy and will give you some pointers on how far you need to go in the SE section and general areas now if your not a numbers guy and looking for monsters, it would be a cruise but as for the skinny water of NE lac seul, my gut says theres at least 5-6 gals up there in the 62-66 inch range"
6706505,JDP,2023-01-14 10:22:00,1457,Check out Moosehorn Lodge.https://www.canadafish.com/
6706515,prov1800,2023-01-14 11:24:00,5010,The Elbow is pretty close by as is the Raggs.There are plenty of muskies around that area.Ive fished it a few times.Big V will give up a few big fish.All good waters
6706531,prov1800,2023-01-14 13:25:00,5010,Moose horn is a great Lodge but will have to trailer daily to the Deception Bay launch.Good muskie fishing very close to launch and not many guys fishing there much.All guides go far.All the water from Dexeption to Rags is very good.The area from the Rags to Devils Elbow gets fished hard.Much easier to stay at Lost Island.
6706537,walleyecheek,2023-01-14 14:01:00,2231,Quite a bit cheaper to !
6707007,musicman,2023-01-16 07:45:00,33,Maybe try Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges or Lac Seul Floating Lodges houseboats and park where the fish are. You can hire a pilot and tell them the area you want to be parked.
6707073,rockape,2023-01-16 12:14:00,215,"I've been going to Sioux Lookout for 20 years. I've fished for and caught muskies out of each. Only a day or two per year on each since the rest of my group don't want to cast for skis all week. Caught the first ski of my life out of Big V. Only took about 30 casts too! I know there are supertankers in there, but I haven't ventured out to the majority of the lake. Usually Botham Bay and a few miles out from there. I catch one every trip on that lake, but most of the fish are all 38 inchers! I netted a 44 for my friend and saw a 50ish fish that wouldn't take my bait. Definitely a lot in there. Lots more action on Lac Seul though. And the average size is a lot bigger. Someone said call Ben Beattie. I 2nd that suggestion! He guided me to a 52.5 on Lac Seul a few years back."
6707357,elkman99,2023-01-17 12:57:00,180,"thanks for all the info! I will definitely be picking between the 2 systems. Anyone know if there are any outpost cabins on Big Vermilion? We are planning on doing a houseboat in 2024, but just don't have enough ppl in our group this year to make it feasible. Also, what resort would you suggest for Big V if I were to choose it? The only ones I see are Nutts Country Cabins, and Deerpath Lodge. However, I can't seem to get ahold of Deerpath."
6707401,x4flatfish,2023-01-17 15:58:00,319,Those are the only 2 I am aware of. The best one was River Edge Outfitters but it was sold to a private company a year ago and is no longer open to the public. No need to choose between the 2 lakes as you can fish them both as they are next to each other. Have done it frequently even the same day. From the public landing on Lost Lake ( just a couple miles from the Big V landing) it is 10 miles on the water to the rags. You don't need to go that far though. We have caught Musky well before the rags. You will also catch some really nice northern while casting these areas.Side note...if you don't have reservations somewhere better do it now.
