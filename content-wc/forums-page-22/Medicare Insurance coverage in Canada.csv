Medicare Advantage plans typically do not cover emergency medical expenses when you are in Canada. Some Medigap plans do cover emergency medical expenses. Make sure to check your plan before you enroll fo 2023."
6692224,Ogoki,2022-10-16 09:42:00,291,"Plan G is also one of the Medigap plans that include foreign travel. With so many people on the move these days, this benefit is a priority for those who travel for work or leisure. Foreign travel emergency care is covered if it begins during the first 60 days of the excursion. After meeting a deductible, the benefit amounts to 80% of the charges invoiced for specific medically necessary emergency care outside the United States. In 2019, the deductible is $250 and the lifetime limit is $50,000This was copied from Medicare page"

Good advice.I'm covered by Medicare plan G.I also have Emergency Assistance Plus which offered me as small discount by purchasing it through NRA.

6707099,LittleBait,2023-01-16 13:19:00,37,"I would not make that blanket statement, Supplement plans G, D, M & N have out of country coverage for care in general, not just er care. Billing however is done differently than us providers who are basically all in network. Medicare pays first, then the supplement. Out patient Rx is a seperate plan. Your Medigap policy may offer additional coverage for emergency health care services or supplies that you get outside the U.S. Standard Medigap Plans C, D, F, G, M, and N provide foreign travel emergency health coverage when you travel outside the U.S. Plans E, H, I, and J are no longer for sale, but if you bought one before June 1, 2010 you may keep it. All of these plans also provide foreign travel emergency health coverage when you travel outside the U.S. Medigap coverage outside the U.S. If you have Medigap Plan C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, M or N, your plan: Covers foreign travel emergency care if it begins during the first 60 days of your trip, and if Medicare doesn't otherwise cover the care. Pays 80% of the billed charges for certain medically necessary emergency care outside the U.S. after you meet a $250 deductible for the year. Foreign travel emergency coverage with Medigap policies has a lifetime limit of $50,000. Find out before you go Before you travel outside the U.S., talk with your Medigap plan or insurance agent to get more information about your Medigap coverage while traveling. Under Advantage plans Medicare is not your primary coverage, the company you pick is the total package, claims do not go to medicare. Emergency and Urgent care are covered Worldwide under most MAPD plans, check the benefit details (ie Anthem BCBS PPO includes this)"
