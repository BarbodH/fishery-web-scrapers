6705357,prov1800,2023-01-08 19:18:00,5010,That's pretty fancy in the Glacier.They had 3 guys sleeping in there this week.I talked to them this morning and they said it's very comfortable and can have lines in till you go to bed.lol.
6705363,Eckohlt,2023-01-08 19:28:00,3685,With rattle wheels you can leave them in all night.
6705369,prov1800,2023-01-08 19:36:00,5010,Think they had something but said something was always setting them off and couldn't get any sleep.Sounds like a good deal for you to be out on the ice all night.lol.
