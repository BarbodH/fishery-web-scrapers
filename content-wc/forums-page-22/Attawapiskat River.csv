6698124,lionfan19,2022-11-26 19:28:00,41,I will be flying to the Attawapiskat River with Graywood Outfitters June 3rd (Beteau Lake). If you have been there any info you would care to share would be appreciated.
6698696,spoonchucker,2022-11-30 12:30:00,82,"I can tell you that the change in ownership has to be a positive as the accommodations were rough and we shared the cabins with hoards of mosquitoes, (poor upkeep) and the porta potties ( did not have conventional outhouses) were not maintained. The article here was kind in those respects. Walleye size was quite good as you can see. Not hard to find. Hoped for bigger pike as we got only one or two in the forty range. Did have fair amount of pike though and a good time. I expect you will have a good time with the new outfitters. https://www.onthewater.com/angling-a...e-attawapiskat"
6698776,GrayWood,2022-11-30 21:13:00,14,As the new outfitter you speak of I can assure you the issues you brought up have all been addressed. We have spent a lot of time and effort improving the camps so people can just enjoy the reason they came up. The fantastic fishing and hunting! Look forward to seeing you in June!!Iâ€™m sure you will notice a big difference in the cabins. Lol
6698878,spoonchucker,2022-12-01 11:11:00,82,"I am so glad to see you have made this camp what it should be. Our group had several sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I really wish you success, as that is plainly a good fishery."
6698880,GrayWood,2022-12-01 11:24:00,14,Hope to see you up there one day again soon. Feel free to reach out anytime. Adam 705-795-0522
6698884,jambi,2022-12-01 11:53:00,504,I came close to booking after Mike Borger posted about this trip several years ago. Glad I didnt go then.... But with new owner and current comments about how much better the camps are... I want to go NOW!
6698886,GrayWood,2022-12-01 12:24:00,14,Thanks everyone. Mike was in Blackbirch fall of 2021 and had a great time. We are very pleased that he is headed to our Windsor lake location this spring.
6699352,Larry S,2022-12-04 06:58:00,665,Have fished Windsor in 2006 and Blackbirch in 2008 when Northern Outposts owned them . You have upgraded the camps and I would definitely go to them again with the new owners improved accommodations The fishing is great Larry Schroeder
6708265,Moosebunk,2023-01-20 18:59:00,211,"Cabin looks great! Eddie North days are done, I guess..? Windsor looks interesting as a big lake with plenty possibilities. Surprised Mike is going back after his first trip, after the report I received. He must see something new with the fishing and outfitter. Regardless, the Attawapiskat has long been known as excellent pike water and I fondly look back on the trips there in the past.https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/attawa...at-pike-built/"
6708275,GrayWood,2023-01-20 19:56:00,14,We have indeed done a lot of work and agree the Attawapiskat River has incredible fishing. Looking forward to an exciting 2023. Still some spots of people are looking!!
