6705903,Old Timer,2023-01-11 10:36:00,255,In the U.S. Native American Communities are viewed as nations within a nation. By treaties these communities are afforded certain rights and privileges that are not available to others. Besides the treaty rights the members of these communities are entitled to the same rights and benefits that are enjoyed by any other citizen of the U.S. I wouldn't be surprised if it works the same way in Canada.
6705781,MN_Moose,2023-01-10 13:27:00,964,I respectfully disagree. The GLIFWC represents the tribes. It has not done a good job of preserving natural resources. Case in point Lake Mille Lacs.
6705783,Lmbkiller,2023-01-10 13:49:00,639,"Pro v what u actually mean is the harvest ceased, and basically for 2yrs. Can't really say the population increased without assessing well before and well after the harvest ceased (yrs and yrs of data u would need)"
6705787,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-10 14:01:00,151,"The problem with Mille Lacs is that it gets pounded by everyone, particularly the Twin Cities. For 2022, the State of MN and GLIFWIC agreed on a total harvest of 135,000 lbs - 80,300 for the state, and 54,700 for the tribes. I'm not certain, but I think the relevant treaty legally allows them to take 50%. It's funny how my GLIFWIC friends feel like the states are not doing as good job of protecting the resources as they are. If you are faulting the tribes for learning how to use the legal system to better their position, welcome to the USA. I agree that people of goodwill don't have to agree on everything."
6705789,prov1800,2023-01-10 14:09:00,5010,Yes would need some new data if that really means anything.Just from fishing in general seemed to show much larger schools of fish on my sonar.Just my observation.But 2 years of very few fish coming out from the lakes makes sense there would be a increase don't you think.X Number of fisherman for 2 years multiplied by X number of fish not taken out = a lot of fish still in lakes.
6705791,Old Timer,2023-01-10 14:24:00,255,"It's pointless to take shots at the native treaty rights and their methods for harvesting fish. So leave it alone, regardless of its impact on the LOTW fishery. Today's sport fishing is what can and should be addressed. I've been fishing LOTW for more than fifty years. When I started the standard fishing boat was a 16 ft. Lund with an 18hp Johnson or a 20hp Merc. There were no electronics, not even the green box. Some fishermen went out on their own, but many used native guides because of the hazardous navigation. Back then folks would catch their limit and call it a day. That's all changed now but the lake is not capable of producing more fish than than it did fifty years ago. Given today's boats and sophisticated electronics something has to give. The starting point is to reduce limits, and even that may not be enough. Next would be to eliminate take-home fish. After that would be to reduce sheer pressure. Everybody wants to catch a lot of fish all-day long, and that's pressure, which includes hooking mortality. I'm not sure how pressure can be managed, but that could be the final step. Maybe a lottery? For me, I'd start with no take-home fish and go from there. Most people go to LOTW and other Canadian lakes to catch fish. Taking fish home is mostly an unnecessary sideshow."
6705807,Flip Silverlake,2023-01-10 17:18:00,645,"If the limits on Non-Resident Non-Canadian are reduced anymore we'll have to buy fish and put them in the lake. I don't personally look to fill my freezer at home because they just don't taste as good fresh caught, but even so all we're permitted is our creel limit and that in no way will fill a cooler. I agree that handling a fish after the catch is very tough on them but how else are you supposed to unhook them. With the new size limits there's going to be a lot of fish handling. As far as a lottery system on getting a license would just about put most resort owners out of business. I believe the intent of the tribal treaties were set up for their subsistence and not to run a million-dollar business. If they want to sell the fish, they net then they need to be regulated to protect the fish population. As far as the electronics I use mine to keep from destroying a $500.00 propeller and finding my way back to the dock. I've fished that lake long enough that we've pretty much figured out the fish patterns throughout the summer."
6705809,Flip Silverlake,2023-01-10 17:32:00,645,"I'm not pointing a finger at anyone; I'm pointing my finger at the method that's used to remove the fish. I've had the misfortune of watching someone (I'll state it that way) pull a net and watched the way the fish were sorted and the ones that aren't put in the cooler, that's in the middle of the boat, are fed to the pelicans. Then there's the question of abandon nets that just keep killing fish. I've looked at the markers that are tied to the end of the net and as I understand it there's supposed to be a name of the person setting the net. All I've ever seen was the work Clorox. Start regulating the netting harvest based on fish counts and you won't have to worry about sport fishing."
6705821,Old Timer,2023-01-10 19:24:00,255,"If there's no language in the native treaties limiting how wildlife may be taken, you can't impose restrictions now. The so-called intent argument is a loser. So forget about that one. And you also can forget about the wasting of wildlife unless there is a provision in the treaty about that one. Until about 15 years ago there were no electronics for safely traveling LOTW. So before then unguided fishermen never ventured far from their camps and remote fish populations were seldom touched. Years ago, fishermen were similarly worried about their propellers and getting lost. IMO modern navigation aids have placed far more pressure on LOTW's fish population than any electronic fish finder. Any first timer who can read a computer screen can safely navigate all corners of LOTW and catch fish. No learning curve required."
6705825,Yellowfin123,2023-01-10 20:10:00,2182,"could be true, my mom told me a few stories of how my grand dad had to hire indian guides to get to his lake house from kenora, lookin at google maps it looks like its maybe just 10 miles"
6705867,1100 Remington Man,2023-01-11 08:43:00,73,It also say's in the Treaties with the Indians in Canada they are to be provided a Medicine Chest. Where in there does it say they will be picked up by aircraft and flown to a medical facility ? Which is done every Day from remote villages. My answer make Indians full fledge Citizens no more checks or aid. It would benefit them as what is happening on the Res is not working. Getting a hand out to get drunk or stoned every day helps no one ! Maybe in a generation they Kids can have a better life.
6705589,RichA$1970,2023-01-09 15:11:00,1159,Sad on the slaughter as conservation laws should apply to all or how can you sustain the population
6705635,v-bay gord,2023-01-09 21:12:00,3168,I would say the grocery store in Rice Lake is as much to blame as the person setting the net. I would also say some spouting off on this topic need to reflect on the MNR violations they have accrued over the years.
6705639,Lmbkiller,2023-01-09 21:59:00,639,"I always laugh when people blame the tribes for the decline in walleye populations. Walleyes and natives have coexisted A LOT longer than the white man and walleyes. I get all the numbers for wi ceded territory walleye take by tribes. It's not even remotely close to the annual sport harvest take. And I guarantee it's no different in other states and provinces. It's easy to dumb it down also ..how is there any walleyes left after 1000s of years of harvest by natives? Math is hard, I know"
6705755,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-10 10:50:00,151,"Both points very well taken. These fish had to come through customs at the border, and apparently passed any US Fish and Wildlife concerns. *Are any laws actually be broken here, or are some of us just jealous of the legal rights of others? Civilized countries enshrine rights in treaties and constitutions to protect them from people who would want to take them away, for whatever reasons.*"
6705761,Flip Silverlake,2023-01-10 11:38:00,645,How long have you fished Lake of The Woods?
6705763,prov1800,2023-01-10 12:29:00,5010,"So this summer I guided a group of guys and one of them owned the Culver's franchises throughout the states He told me they now serve walleye on there menu and it all comes from Canada.Didnt ask where in Canada but never the less Canada.There are commercial walleye Co mpanies as I know Lake Winnipeg has a lot of commercial boats going out.Someone just has to make sure lakes can sustain the fishing plus the recreational fishing.As Gord said that Eagles fishery turned around for the good and I remember fishing there in the 80,s and it was slim pickings then and a few other lakes.What ever changes needed to bring back fishing is fine with me."
6705771,Lmbkiller,2023-01-10 12:56:00,639,"On and off 35yrs ..how long I've fished it or not is irrelevant btw. There's plenty of lakes in wi where walleye have tanked, extended growth young of yr have been stocked, limits restricted reduced cnr only etc ..and still they aren't coming back. Point is u can't point the finger at one people person entity whatever"
6705773,Flip Silverlake,2023-01-10 12:59:00,645,"The first year I fished Lake of The Woods was 1962. I can tell you that it was just amazing. My Dad and I took a 14-foot car top boat with a 5 1/2 Johnson from Primers Point on Longbow Lake to Scotty's Island on Lake of The Woods. That was when you could keep 6 per license. The stringer was so heavy it took two to pick it up. As time passed the limits changed and the fish got a little harder to get. In the early 80's the MNR bought the licenses off the commercial fishing operations, and they shut down the processing plant in Kenora. I was told that plant had the capability to process 40,000 pound of fish a week. After the MNR bought those licenses, the fishing came back like it was in the 60's. You didn't have to run 20 to 30 miles down the lake to get a reasonable catch. Not too long ago the Natives bought that plant and restarted that operation. When it was commercially fished there were a number for rules, they had to follow like quotas for one. The fishing from my observation has returned to the early 80's level. You've got to hunt for them. In 2006 I bought a place on Pine Portage Bay and have been able to spend the summers on the lake. We missed 2020 and 2021 due to the Chinese Flu but were able to get back up there in July of this year. Believe me there we not many if any sport fisherman on the lake. I've got pictures to prove it. Now here's what I found. I didn't see many native boats heading out to pull their nets and the fishing in spots I'd given up on was great. We spent 10 weeks on the lake, and I think we ate more fish than I've ever eaten. I have a theory on why it seemed to have returned to prior netting times. The number of restaurant's including Culvers were basically shut down during the pandemic. So, there wasn't a market for the fish, and they had a chance to make a comeback. I do not believe that there are the numbers of sport fisherman that could have any serious effect of fish numbers especially with the current limits. I don't care how many electronic gadgets you have. There needs to be controls placed on the netting operations like there was before in order to keep the fish population viable. By the way I'm a U.S. citizen so my daily limit is two fish, so between myself and my wife we would bring in 4. We did bring fish home, but it wasn't a two-license limit."
6705777,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-10 13:05:00,151,"Here in the Great Lakes region (MN,WI, MI), the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWIC) seems to do a very good job of representing the interests of numerous tribes and their treaty rights while maintaining the welfare of the resources, in close coordination with the state DNRs. Perhaps something similar would work for Canada. But it probably all takes money, and somebody willing to pony up."
6705779,prov1800,2023-01-10 13:10:00,5010,"With the 2 years of covid, fish populations defiantly increased.This summer fishing in my are was spectacular in my book.The only netting done all-round me is Whitefish netting with a % of other species but it's controlled and the guy netting is very good about everything and mnr checks him out.No commercial walleye fishing here at all."
6703443,Lmbkiller,2022-12-27 13:01:00,639,Talk about short sighted ..maybe the natives don't want u guys using all your 16in graphs with side imaging live sonar your power poles spot lock self deploying/stowing trolling motors. Get a clue fellas
6703663,emma17,2022-12-29 09:49:00,436,"Huh? I'm not educated enough on the netting issue to comment, but your point seems to have greatly missed the mark. The fishermen w all the electronics you speak of are those that are governed by the bag limit rules. All the electronics in the world won't allow a fisherman to keep more than the limit."
6703689,Lmbkiller,2022-12-29 11:40:00,639,"They have bag limits also, theyre called quotas. And if u think their quotas are more than our bag limits u are dead wrong. Sport angling harvest is much much much higher. There's some on here who just want to point the finger, all they gotta do is look in a mirror."
6703711,emma17,2022-12-29 15:11:00,436,"I read a bit about this with Wisconsin law a while back but am no expert. As I recall, the WI quota was a range. I think a max harvest was agreed upon in advance, and then the tribes would report the actual harvest. I seem to remember if the actual was less than the max, the difference could be included in the max harvest/resulting bag limit for non-Indian fishermen. Is this how Canadian law works? As for the electronics, I think you aren't being completely objective. Isn't part of the agreement w the tribes based on their desire to retain/regain the use of the land as it was prior to the white man conquering it? Sort of a deal to allow for them to go back in time. If this is accurate, hopefully you can at least understand a little bit of the concern when the tribes utilize equipment that didn't exist in the day they are trying to go back to."
6703715,v-bay gord,2022-12-29 15:55:00,3168,"My understanding of the situation is something like this: Sport fishing harvest on certain sections of the lake is above sustainable levels. Any netting is above and beyond this. There are allocations made to the ""user groups"" on the lake.....based on sustainable levels of harvest. Number one priority goes to native harvest. It's a treaty right....no point arguing this fact. There are a number of First Nations on LOW.......(8-10?).....each with their own leadership / and management philosophies. Getting everyone on board is difficult. Limits and quotas. Individual native bands can take out a licence from the MNR which may have a quota. Having a licence is not enforced. Reporting on catch is non existent. This seems like an area that needs some consensus on future management strategies. Back in the day, the sport fishery on LOW created employment opportunities for First Nations people......ie guiding. The point made about 16 inch sonars and mapping chips is valid.......the requirements for guides has diminished. LOW is a great fishery. In the long run these changes will seem minor but nobody likes change. On Eagle Lake we had drastic regulation changes 30 years ago that have proved to be positive."

6703739,Lmbkiller,2022-12-29 20:36:00,639,"I can tell u having a tribal license in the states is enforced. Also reporting of harvest is enforced.

I'm not a Canadian resident but I still find that hard to believe that those things aren't enforced there. Cuz they definitely should be"
6705557,Flip Silverlake,2023-01-09 12:20:00,645,"I was in a grocery store in Rice Lake Wisconsin this morning and in their freezer section they had a pile of Walleye filets wrapped in plastic. On the package it stated that it was a Proud Product of Ontario Canada. Now it didn't say what lake they came out of, but you could only guess. They were all close to a 17-inch class fish. The idea that the Natives are upset because sport fisherman use all kinds of high-end electronics and fancy boats is really a stretch! I had an opportunity to talk to a number of MNR officers in Kenora and asked them what can be done about the netting situation, and he responded that they can't do a thing about it. I've watched nets being placed and also cleaned out and it's a disgrace. What they don't want is fed to the Pelicans, you can always know when their boats are going out because they're being followed by a large flock of Pelicans. Unless the netting situation is addressed the new regulations are nothing but window dressing and the Walleye population will continue to erode."
6705563,prov1800,2023-01-09 12:46:00,5010,"Nothing much enforced here in Canada.Natives just preach traditional rights.But don't do anything traditional anymore.I agree things need to be done.They want to get the caribou to come but and non native people can't hunt them but natives can and do in large numbers.They have moose derbies worth big money and can shoot as many moose as they want.Use flashlights,spot beams shot from boats and vehicles.nothing much done about."

On the Canadian side, there have been areas almost completely void of any game fish, due to unlimited consistent day/night after day/night netting. Changes to both sides of the border to improve the fish population will be hard to come by. Bill"
6703045,prov1800,2022-12-24 07:05:00,5010,Iam sure that ice fishing has a big effect on populations.Fortunatly up here a bit further north we don't have the mass fisherman.Although toward spring and warmer weather there are fishing spots accessible by truck and have seen and been to those places when invited along and find it incredible how many vehicles were out there.Iam afraid Cedar Lake at the sanctuaries will get pounded this year as the logging cut has made a road right to the creek and will have truck access this spring.None of that accessibility is good for fish populations and in my opinion should close these areas sooner.Just my 2 cents.
6703193,Bill Krejca,2022-12-25 07:07:00,6107,"Sorry to hear of increased accessibility. My changing fishing pathway over the years seems to have been one of just trying to keep ahead of encroachments, either caused by overfishing or netting. Removal of the crappies over the winter in Nelson was heartbreaking to me. Seems to be a never ending pattern, I guess I should be used to it by now. Bill"
6703195,prov1800,2022-12-25 07:25:00,5010,Merry Xmas Bill.Ian used to it to but don't like it.Crappies were weird already in the spring.High water changed their patterns and had to look for new ones where they staged.In the fall there where some regular areas but not in the numbers I have been used to so again went snooping around and did find good concentrations with some guests.Made it interesting and like that kind of fishing.I will ice fish them on Cedar after the sanctuaries close and I can run on pure ice and not leave a trail to my spots.They cut on the Camp Robinson road all the way toward Keystone but not all the way.can now see Grassy bay from road.They also cut to where the old bridge was that would get you on the April rd toward Ord Lake.So that will allow people to drive right to the creek on and to Cedar.Not as bad as LOTW but bad enough for a while.Will have to see this spring how the crappies react.It was very poor in Nelson and peephole.
6703315,1100 Remington Man,2022-12-26 11:56:00,73,"My 2 cents Fish Limits should be the same for Residents or Non Residents. Just change the length limit. Put Greater restrictions on Netting !

The last three years have seen less fishing pressure than in years due to border restrictions etc. In my humble opinion the issue is with the Minnesota limit being higher and the netting on the Ontario side. I don't believe that the harvest of walleye by recreational fisherman on the Ontario side is the problem. I'll go out all day and see thousands of acres of water and very few other boats. Another possible cause of the reduced numbers of walleye may be due to invasive species e.g. rusty crawfish etc or possibly other vectors (cormorants,pelicans?) preying on juvenile walleye. p.s.

I spent 8 weeks this summer on The Lake of The Woods and had great fishing. I'm of the belief that a lot of netting was dialed back because the market died when a majority of restaurants were closed due to the Chinese Flu. We caught a lot of fish in the 14-to-16-inch class with only one over 18 inches. I saw a few native boats heading out on the lake and you can always tell who they are because of the pelicans following them. But as things start up and the netting takes off again the fish population is going to continue to drop off. The other thing about this is that forcing non-resident Canadians to keep the limits that a non-resident non-Canadian has to just forces them to go out two days to catch the same thing. It makes no sense! With the cost of gas, you're going to see less and less tourists in that part of the world. The MNR needs to wake up and look at what the real cause of the population problem and until they do, I don't believe they are serious or really have a clue what's going on!"

While all fishing has its cycles and ups and downs, the changes I’ve observed in the last five years have been unusual, more sustained and more unpredictable than anything seen in the past. Lower catch rates, smaller overall size, fewer large fish, and generally speaking just truly not what it once was. This is excellent in order to preserve the fishery long term. Now the MNR needs to shut down the tournament AND do something about the irresponsible First Nations netting *I am a Status Indian*"
