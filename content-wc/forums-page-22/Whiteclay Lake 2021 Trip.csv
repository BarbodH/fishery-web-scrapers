Anyway, last year the Walleye Wanderers made the trek up to Whiteclay Lake with hosts Boreal Forest Outfitters for the week of June 26  July 3, 2021. Due to ongoing COVID restrictions some of our regular members were unable to attend this years trip, leaving us as a group of four consisting of John, Ron, Frank and myself. After a long but normal drive up to Nakina we arrived at our Outfitters extra house in Nakina which would be our base camp for night. Early Saturday morning we were made our way down to the familiar Nakina Air floatplane dock where the effects of COVID were noticeable by the absence of alot of our American friends. After briefing chatting with Jason & Sue our Outfitters and Greg and Sue at Nakina Air we were loaded onto the turbo Otter and off on a 45-50 minute flight to Whiteclay Lake. Upon arriving at Whiteclay we taxied to the dock and the beautiful white sand beach surrounding it. In fact there were several white sandy beaches visible as the water level was a little low, leaving more of the sandy shoreline exposed than usual. The Boreal Forest Outfitters camp at Whiteclay is sprawling with 4 buildings in total, consisting of two fully equipped cabins, a log outbuilding with spare motors, parts and a fish cleaning station complete with running water. There is also a shower building at the base of a water tower, complete with chest freezer, sink, shower and solar lights complement all of the buildings. The main camp is insulated, well furnished complete with solid wood log chairs and large table, full size propane fridge and stove and 3 sets of bunk beds. Lots of windows with screens, an inverter to charge phones, cameras, etc,, hot and cold running water, generous woodstove, a comfy couch and lazy boy chair! Outside we had chairs to sit around the firepit, a new propane BBQ, Fish Fryer, a solid wide dock with plenty of Lund boats and motors. Although the camp is a bit of a rustic layout not having separate bedrooms, it is very well equipped, clean and spacious with all the amenities you need for a great week. Whiteclay can be a bit of an intimidating lake when you look at it on a map as it spans approx. 35 kms in length with Boreals camp being close to the middle and near the Raymond River which flows into Whiteclay. The lake, like most north of Nakina is tea stained and medium depth with some rocky shoals, some deep holes, some sandy shorelines and a cool 100' shear vertical rock passage at the north east end of the lake. Loads of bays, islands and narrows to explore and duck out of wind when needed. As there was a bit of a heat wave during our week, a swim at our sandy beach was a welcome relief on the hot days. The grounds were nicely manicured with the grass cut short keeping the mosquitoes to a reasonable level. This being our first visit to Whiteclay, we spent the first couple of days exploring and trolling various sections of the north/east end of the lake and fishing the Raymond River all the way up to the rapids a few kms from the main lake. The rapids were very scenic and a definite hotspot for tons of nice 19-20 Walleye with the occasional fat Pike being caught right at the base of the rapids in the fast water. Trolling around a large shallow rock shoal straight out from the camp and around the island to the right of the camp provided countless Walleye and decent Pike with John catching a 40er on the backside of the island. Further east on the north side of the lake we trolled through a small neck down where the water was moving a little quicker and several large rocks were visible. After a couple of double headers while trolling we dropped anchor and proceeded to jig a ridiculous amount of very decent Walleyes. This location would become our Walley Hole for the days we were having fish for dinner as it pretty much guaranteed to produce. One particular day we filled our gas tank to the brim and fished our way down the east end of the Lake looking for the rock face passage known as the Gorge that we had heard about prior to our trip. After a pretty good boat ride we suddenly found ourselves in this passage and looking at the fishfinder, it indicated we were in water over a hundred feet deep! I tried to paint a picture in my head of vertical rock cliffs extending 100' up and 100' down below the water, thinking this is very strange as most of the lakes in the area are shallow and the terrain pretty flat. I suggest if you visit Whiteclay, is a worthwhile boat ride to see this beautiful scenery and there certainly is some good fishing all along the way. The boats were great, no leaks and motors all worked flawlessly all week. Mid-week Sue, Jason and their two girls Katelyn and Chloe flew into camp with some extra gas and several bags of cubed ice for us, while checking to ensure everything was working perfectly. While no record size fish were caught this week, we did catch our share of nice healthy Walleye and several big frisky Pike. In chatting on our last night we felt the we should return to Whiteclay in spring next year to finish exploring and give the big Pike a little more attention. Folks like Jason & Sue make the decision to return easy as they go out of their way to provide a great experience and they are always upgrading their camps with new appliances, boats, motors and renovating the buildings. Having visited many Lakes north of Nakina over the years targeting large Pike, I believe Whiteclay has all of the ingredients to be a excellent big Pike lake and of course the tasty Whiteclay Walleye are very abundant throughout the lake. An excellent week thanks to our hospitable hosts Boreal Forest Outfitters, my fellow Walleye Wanderers and the beauty and serenity of Northern Ontario. Until our next trip Cheers Rob A couple of photos..."
