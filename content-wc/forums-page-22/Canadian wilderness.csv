6705297,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-08 13:19:00,151,"I agree, super pics. In the area of WMU4 I moose hunt, the MNR has a large billboard with pictures of a caribou and a bull moose, and I think the title is ""Know the Difference!"". Seems like an unlikely mistake to make, but I guess caution is never an bad idea."
6705301,prov1800,2023-01-08 13:22:00,5010,"Well we do get a lot of people hunting here from the East,that would explain the billboard."
6705381,Moosebunk,2023-01-08 20:23:00,211,"They are often ghosts. Incredible in the bush, you could be standing beside one and not even know it. Take two steps off a shoreline into the woods and just vanish."
6705383,prov1800,2023-01-08 20:39:00,5010,Your right.Beautifull animal
6705457,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-09 07:42:00,151,"Caribou management is a political hot potato for the MNR. Their main tool for caribou management appears to be moose population reduction, which p.o.'s the resident hunters. The conservationists (and some biologists) are p.o.ed because the MNR doesn't appear very effective in this regard. Billboards such as this, in areas with both moose hunters and caribou, give the MNR the opportunity to claim they are ""doing something"", with minimal risk of p.o.ing anybody too much. The billboards must be effective - I could find no relevant reports of illegal hunter caribou mortality."
6705459,prov1800,2023-01-09 07:52:00,5010,Don't here much about illegal caribou kills.Natives will kill lots if they see them.Easy to shoot them when the herds are on the ice.Mnr can't stop that but as far as traditional hunting rights go its a joke with modern weapons.
6705501,Dakota7,2023-01-09 10:09:00,2,Great pic from the air!! Thanks to you and Wayne Clark for sharing.
6706243,PRO-V16,2023-01-12 14:57:00,454,They burned off several islands on the east end of Lac Suel a few years ago in the name of caribou birthing habitat. According to a person that worked MNR there at the time the crew sprayed fuel all over and let it burn. That person voiced concerns over possible pollution and other issues and was told to stay out of it.
6706285,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-12 20:07:00,151,"My guess is that this is the project:https://www.ontario.ca/page/lac-seul...ment-statement By the time such projects actually get implemented, the people involved are probably sick-and-tired of environmental impact reviews, public input, etc."
6705165,JAY221,2023-01-07 09:43:00,877,"How is the snow measuring up this winter? Average or so? Later, Jay"
6705171,prov1800,2023-01-07 10:42:00,5010,Kinda average so far.Had lots in beginning but has tapered off.Lakes were low though again this fall so will need some but not to much.lol.Lakes are slushy with snow weight right now.

6705185,pjshorthorn,2023-01-07 13:05:00,5654,"Tried for many years John. She is a city girl through and through, but I did get her to agree to build her dream retirement home in the country on 10 acres .so there is still hope . Hopefully I can get her on a trip to all my favorite places in Canada that I have visited over our 40 years together. Might be a great 50 th anniversary present for both of us. Lots of travel and a little bit of fishing for me. LOL. PjShorthorn"

6705269,prov1800,2023-01-08 11:24:00,5010,Pretty sweet pics.Nice bull to.
6705285,Skywagon,2023-01-08 12:05:00,1106,"It was a quick shot with my phone, wish Ellen had been there with a good camera. Just got back yesterday from spending a couple of days up there. Moose and wolves both had walked on our snowmobile tracks that we made going in, but no Caribou. Lots of slush in spots, but the snow was not deep enough on the lakes to be an issue. Sun going below the trees, you know what they say...."
6705287,prov1800,2023-01-08 12:12:00,5010,Sounds like fun trip in there.Better go tend the lines as sun goes done.
6705101,prov1800,2023-01-06 18:10:00,5010,Mild Rich.-6 today.-14 last night.Good looking weather for a while yet.Good winter so far.

6705133,prov1800,2023-01-07 05:54:00,5010,Might add some excitement.
6705137,Eckohlt,2023-01-07 06:25:00,3685,"Don't let mama tap read that,or your fishing days may be over."
6705139,prov1800,2023-01-07 06:31:00,5010,Could be interesting
6705141,Bill Krejca,2023-01-07 07:17:00,6107,"Yeah, wolves, my first thought. Neat picture!!! Bill"
6705145,prov1800,2023-01-07 07:26:00,5010,Last winter was tough on all animals up here.Ive seen less tracks this year.Wolves iam sure had a tough time hunting in the huge amounts of snow we had.
6705151,RichA$1970,2023-01-07 07:57:00,1159,"I’d love to ship up some coyotes up to you as I have too many on the farm now. Trapped 2 this weekend plus a stray dog I saw last month running deer, but need to get rid of at least 6 more. Any varmint hunters I am using a Savage B-mag in .17 Win super mag that dropped a bobcat yesterday and it’s the lightest rifle I’ve carried & the weather is almost 50 today."
6704947,prov1800,2023-01-06 06:52:00,5010,Here's a picture Wayne Clark sent me yesterday as he was doing some minnow trapping north of Lac Suel.He said these woodland Caribou were eating slush which most lakes have so far this year.Really cool pic of our Canadian wilderness.
6704961,Eckohlt,2023-01-06 07:27:00,3685,Like to have been up in the air with him!cool pic
6704963,prov1800,2023-01-06 07:31:00,5010,Pretty awesome for sure.Looks quite a bit different than flying in the summer.
6705001,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-06 10:28:00,151,Outstanding picture! My first reaction was those caribou seem really conspicuous and potentially vulnerable to wolves. But a little research indicated caribou can outrun wolves on ice and actually seek refuge on frozen lakes such as this.
6705003,prov1800,2023-01-06 10:33:00,5010,Love wildlife pics like that.Quite a population of the woodland Caribou up there.Have been to a couple of Clark's camps and have seen them.Beautifull animals.
6705027,snwblnd,2023-01-06 12:21:00,50,Beautiful.
6705031,nitroman,2023-01-06 12:34:00,368,that's pretty cool!
6705055,N_of_Quibell,2023-01-06 13:49:00,151,"I have seen their uniquely shaped tracks while moose hunting in WMU4 north of Lac Suel, but I am looking forward to the day when I actually see one in the flesh (I'm pretty sure I can tell one from a moose;-)"
6705069,prov1800,2023-01-06 15:19:00,5010,You will defiantly see a big difference.Woodland caribou not much bigger than one of our whitetails.
6705083,RichA$1970,2023-01-06 17:12:00,1159,I keep thinking of where’s the wolves from the pack. Cool picture and I feel even warmer from this morning’s coyote hunt after looking how cold it looks there.
