Through them my dad and I got to know Vicki and her husband. They happened to be farmers in an area about thirty miles from where I live in the states. You are correct they are absolutely the salt of the earth and wonderful people. Another gentleman, Hank Runge, used to stay in a cabin all summer up there and help out, similar to your story about Vicki. If you want to see a wonderful video and a similar story about a woman who loves to fly fish in Northwest Ontario, go to Jay Siemen's Common Thread- Fly Fishing Film on YouTube. It will leave a tear in your eye!"

If I win the Mega lottery I'd invite a group of friends and hire photo journalists to produce a video."

6708067,NWBearcatgrad,2023-01-20 08:00:00,36,"WOW..... What a gal! Not many of us know a Vicki, but those who do sure are blessed. May she continue to travel and enjoy the time she has left doing what she loves and enjoys. As for the rest of us, let us recognize what we should, and try and strive to be a Vicki"
6708153,emma17,2023-01-20 11:09:00,436,Great story and awesome woman. It seems Witch Bay attracts people like her. My wife and I went 3-4 times and we met some incredibly loyal guests- 40 years of more.
6708411,jaleonard,2023-01-21 12:19:00,29,What a husband and wife team. It's awesome she carried his Celebration of Life forward. Thank you for sharing this story with us. She is something special and ya'll were fortunate to have befriended her.
6707589,Carnhzkr,2023-01-18 11:42:00,964,"Last year, I took my wife to Witch Bay Camp, on LoTW. I'd never done a full American plan lodge, but since my wife's been a good sport about letting me go on these Canadian trips, I figured I'd splurge since it's her vacation too. At dinner, we were seated at a large table next to an elderly woman, I'd guess to be around 75ish. Although lots of other guests would regularly come by to talk to her, I thought it was odd that she seemed to be alone. As our week at the camp went on, I asked a lot of questions and got to know her better. She's quite a woman.WB is the type of camp that thrives on repeat business. Some folks, I learned, have been coming each year for 10, 20, even 30 years or more. She was one of those. I don't remember exactly, but I believe she said she and her husband had been coming to the camp for 30 or 40 years. I think it was 4 or 5 years ago, her husband suffered a heart attack and died out on the water while they were fishing. She has continued to come, either alone or sometimes with her son for extended trips. She had already been at the lodge for, I believe, two weeks when we met her. Her son accompanied her for the first week, then he flew back home from International Falls, to manage the family farm. When I asked how long she was staying, she never had an answer. She'd leave whenever she felt the time was right. She stayed in an older cabin that they didn't typically rent out, so this provided her the flexibility to stay as long as she wanted. One day at breakfast, Gail, the camp owner, asked Vickie if she would help out in the kitchen that evening at dinner since they were short-staffed and she happily obliged, so she certainly didn't have the typical relationship of a ""normal"" customer.While we were there, Vickie fished alone everyday. And she didn't just stay close to camp, she preferred to take her 20' Ranger bass boat with a casting deck large enough to land small aircraft, to the far western side of the lake. I'd guess she'd motor about 15 miles each way. I asked if she'd like to come along with us or at least follow and fish the same locations, but she refused, as she preferred to fish alone. On our 6th day, my wife and I were returning to camp after a day on the water and I noticed I was catching up to two boats that were running pretty close together. As I approached I could see that one boat was being towed and soon recognized the towed boat as Vickie's Ranger. She had been out on the far western side of the lake and her motor just wouldn't kick over. She didn't have a cell phone, much to her son's disgust (I'll bet that changes this year), so she used her electric TM to pull her about 5 miles out to the main channel where she was able to get help and a tow.Back at the dock another guest and I tried our best, but couldn't get her Pro Max to turn over. That was the end of her trip. She pulled out at 4:00am the next day to make the 14-hour trip in one shot.My wife won't even drive across town to the grocery store by herself, yet Vickie goes to Canada and fishes all parts of Lake of the Woods alone. Brave, stubborn, and probably foolish would be words to describe her, but she's living her life the best she can. I hope to see her again this summer."

6707637,That Minnesota guy,2023-01-18 13:47:00,8293,"I'm sure the camp holds very precious memories of her husband. In returning she lets him know he is still in her thoughts & heart. We all need to slow down and smell the roses while we still can. Life is not about how much money you can make or the size of your house. In the end those things don't matter, not even a little bit."
6707659,7 Mag,2023-01-18 14:53:00,1887,"That's amazing! Sounds like she takes a lot of pride in how she lives her life, lots of people in this world could learn from her example. Thanks for sharing."
