6706669,Walleye Wanderer,2023-01-15 09:01:00,101,"LMAO, you can definitely bring your girls!!!"
6707105,nitroman,2023-01-16 13:58:00,368,Get one of those egg cookers off Amazon John and you will never boil an egg again! They are magic!
6707107,prov1800,2023-01-16 14:08:00,5010,I'll check that out.
6707155,Eckohlt,2023-01-16 17:23:00,3685,Which cooker is the best one to get nitro??
6707243,nitroman,2023-01-17 07:06:00,368,https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Rapid-Eg...2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1I have the Dash one but they are all the same for the most part. I also have one from Fleet Farm that works great too. just make sure it has the auto off timer deal.My favoritehttps://www.fleetfarm.com/detail/nes...t=egg%20cooker
6707247,prov1800,2023-01-17 07:20:00,5010,I checked them them out and saw the dash unit.Interesting.
6707249,Eckohlt,2023-01-17 07:28:00,3685,"Thanks nitro,looks like a neat unit,I'm sure I'll get to fleet farm soon."
6707551,Clairebear,2023-01-18 10:18:00,937,"Best reliable egg cooker ever. Easy to clean and not an extra appliance in the cupboard or on the counter. Leave an 1/8"" of egg out of water to let air escape."
6706197,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 11:33:00,3685,"I might drive up there to buy eggs n bring home,crazy egg prices here."
6706201,prov1800,2023-01-12 11:45:00,5010,What's your price on eggs by you.
6706211,RichA$1970,2023-01-12 12:00:00,1159,"Luckily the farmer down the road is selling at $2/dozen, it was $1.50 last year but still not bad. He rose his moonshine price from $12 to $15 a mason jar and his business is booming"
6706213,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 12:20:00,3685,"4 to 5$,could usually find them for under a buck most of the time.It's cutting into my Ontario funds,this spring I'll stand on a street corner with sign,(need money for fly in fishing trip)."
6706215,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 12:23:00,3685,"Good thing Andy Taylor n Barney fife aren't around anymore,they would shut him down."
6706217,RichA$1970,2023-01-12 12:30:00,1159,"Eck, you don’t have time to be cooking eggs on your trip as the fish are waiting for your assault. I’m lucky as I just need a Monster energy drink & a granola bar and I’m on the lake not farting around cooking breakfast."
6706219,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 12:56:00,3685,"My breakfast is in the dark rich,waiting for first light,I'm like you don't burn any daylight."
6706221,prov1800,2023-01-12 13:45:00,5010,Iam a breakfast guy.Have time.my guide days start at 8.Up early anyways so plenty of time to make it or guys iam guiding invite me for breakfast.Fish bite all day.
6706223,Eckohlt,2023-01-12 13:49:00,3685,KC landing 24 hours there snapping.
6706225,prov1800,2023-01-12 13:52:00,5010,Hope so.ill be heading there in the morning.After breakfast.HAHA.
6670424,BreezyPoint,2022-07-04 20:53:00,1581,Hard boiled is allowed. They are cooked. You may need to crack one to prove it. I just crossed with 12 cooked eggs.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk
6670460,Eckohlt,2022-07-05 05:57:00,3685,"Kinda tough to flip'em over easy haha,but it's good to know there allowed,thanks breezy"
6670490,walleyecheek,2022-07-05 07:26:00,2231,I was wondering if pickled eggs are considered cooked ?
6670494,Eckohlt,2022-07-05 07:32:00,3685,"Call the border and ask if you can bring a few hundred pickled eggs in!,,,,some say they go good with labatt's."
6670744,reddemon2,2022-07-05 17:38:00,255,Are Boiled Eggs or Deviled Eggs OK?
6705945,elway12,2023-01-11 13:25:00,335,Here is the updated website link that should answer most eggs/poultry border crossing questions. I am assuming that this policy will continue into this summer but you never know.https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-.../1659970021314
6706151,ogilville,2023-01-12 08:53:00,262,Who can afford eggs?
6706153,prov1800,2023-01-12 09:02:00,5010,4.50-5 bucks a dozen in Canada.cheap.
6706157,ogilville,2023-01-12 09:08:00,262,Let's hope they stay that way for this fishing season. But until recently 4.50 - 5 bucks wasn't considered cheap for eggs.
6706163,prov1800,2023-01-12 09:14:00,5010,Pretty good for Canada.
6665148,Further North,2022-06-15 21:48:00,2008,I saw a reference to poultry eggs...and then thought I might have seen something about not bringing eggs.What's the deal?
6665156,Yellowfin123,2022-06-15 22:30:00,2182,"DO NOT BRING EGGS, CHICKENS, POULTRY, GIRLS, WORMS, DEAD MINNOWS, TO CANADA!!!!!! no if's and but's about it... theres been alot of egg talk, this is fact.."
6665170,Spartan1,2022-06-16 05:45:00,46,"Yellowfin is 110% correct. If you try to bring eggs across the border they will turn you around send you back to the U.S. to dispose of them and you get the privilege of getting in line for another border inspection. Not worth it, buy your eggs once you cross into Canada."
6665172,CI_Guy,2022-06-16 05:47:00,2118,"Avian flu, just like a few years ago"
6665192,Further North,2022-06-16 06:53:00,2008,"Thanks folks.It's been a while, and I forgot."
6665218,Bakefish,2022-06-16 08:12:00,1077,Those are some tough restrictions
6665354,chunger21,2022-06-16 21:06:00,11,"Check the guidelines on the border website. Eggs are not allowed if purchased in certain states. Our group is from Illinois and we crossed the border a few weeks back and they let us bring in our eggs because they were purchased in Illinois and Illinois was not a restricted state for eggs. I know Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Iowa were banded states along with some other states. Check the guidelines on their website before you leave as I'm sure the list does change."
6665362,chunger21,2022-06-16 21:46:00,11,Here is the link to the restricted states.https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-.../1644937572682
6665364,Golden Eagle,2022-06-16 22:08:00,2642,"I was aware of the list when I crossed on May 19. No eggs were allowed from the U.S. to Ontario. There was a sign stating so. Those with eggs returned to International falls, disposed of the eggs, paid a new bridge fee and then entered Ontario."
6665378,Joek3,2022-06-17 05:13:00,244,Language is confusing. Says uncooked chicken and eggs. Wonder if hard boiled eggs are allowed. Meaning the uncooked applies to eggs also.
