We are going to Big Canon Lake, NW of Vermilion Bay this year. All three Freedom Maps Canada chips have Ontario listed. Do any of you know which one covers the Vermilion Bay area, or maybe all of them do?"
1077709,Jimmy Jig,2009-01-31 20:05:00,1905,"I have a Freedom Map chip, No. F40T (North Ontario & Manitoba) It covers all that area."
1077767,ackermannsacre,2009-02-01 08:14:00,196,"Thanks JJ, but I have not been able to locate any of the older chips for the smaller regions. The older F40 and F29 covered the area, but are discontinued. The newer series only has three chips to cover all of Canada. I have a inquiry into LEI, hope they reply soon. Be nice if they showed an outline map on their website depicting the coverage like they do for other map chip series."
1078004,PRD1,2009-02-02 09:45:00,458,"The new Freedom Maps are much larger than the old (1GB vs 256MB) and hold way more data. They overlap so pick the one that best matches your needs. NC (North Central) has all of central Canada including Ontario and Manitoba all the way north to the Arctic. WC comes from the Pacific Ocean east through Manitoba but does not include Ontario (or only part of Ontario) and EC comes all the way from the Atlantic west through and Manitoba. So either the NC or EC would meet your needs. I got the F112-EX-EC since I fish NW Ontario and hope to fish Manitoba one of these days and it would be useful on a driving trip through eastern Canada.
