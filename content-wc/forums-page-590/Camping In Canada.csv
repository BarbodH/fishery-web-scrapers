1077384,gary2242,2009-01-30 15:08:00,49,"I would drive to North Bay Ontario, go east on hwy 17 for about 30 minutes and then turn south to Brent, which is an insertion point in Algonquin Park. There is drive-in camping right on Cedar Lake with electricity. It's $9.50 per night per person.Cedar lake is Smallmouth Bass, Lake Trout, Brook Trout and Monster Walleyes. You are allowed any size motor on the lake. In a few years from now, they might change that to maximum of 30 hp.The biggest Walleyes in the world are being pulled out of this lake. There are 15 to 20 walleyes being caught. However, they are deep in the summer. You will have to find drop-offs out from the mouth of the Petawawa River and jig 30 to 50 feet deep during the day or sleep all day and troll along the shoreline at night with shallow jointed Blue Rapalas. It's hard to catch walleyes in the summer but the ones you catch are monsters. Myfriend Steve has a 9-pounder, TJ caught a 15-pounder and my friend Jim has caught a 20-pound walleye. It's tough fishing. You can fish for walleyes all week and only catch a couple. It's still fun because the lake is swarming with trout and bass so it's easy to catch fish. It's also a beautiful area. Algonquin Park is Canada's jewel. We think of it the same way Americans think about Yellowstone or Yosemite. It's just thousands of lakes joined by canoe portages. There are rivers and waterfalls and stands of 500 year old white pines that are just a bit smaller then the red-woods on the west coast.Gary"

1077717,Richard B,2009-01-31 21:13:00,735,Gary2242 - You need to check you numbers. https://www.walleyecentral.com/topwater.htm If a 20 pound walleye was caught in Canada it would have been number 2 or 3 of all time! Oh that's right this is a fishing site. LOL
1077720,phishfearme,2009-01-31 21:43:00,1242,looks like greer's ferry AR is THE place to go for a real trophy!
1077984,lund rebel,2009-02-02 08:17:00,138,"I fish the English river and have a great time, we fish out of Misty's Fishing Adventures, a great little marina they have electricity, bait and gas and a little of everything that you sometimes forget, and they have romote camp sites, that is where we stay, I cant say i have ever caught a trophy fish, but you can spend a day catching a lot of wallys in the upper 20 inch and it has good smally fishing and pike. Some days we would have trouble catching fish small enough to eat for supper. Their probably better fishing spots, but this is where I spend my week in heaven every year. www.mistysfishingadventure.com"
1078216,fishncamp,2009-02-03 07:55:00,49,"If you like a less remote area with electricity check out Anishinabi Campground on the outskirts of Kenora. They have a good launch, all amenities a few minutes away, a small beach for the kids and great fishing at the north end of Lake of the Woods. Rushing River also has a pretty nice campground near Kenora with reservable sites."
1052653,Richard B,2008-09-01 16:04:00,735,"With the current economy, I have a group of guys, 6 to 8, that want to go up to Canada and tent camp. We have our own boats but would definitely need electricity. We love to fish for anything and everything but especially walleye, smallmouth, and pike. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you"
1052668,Golden Eagle,2008-09-01 17:04:00,2642,"Chukuni River Campground on the Chukuni, near Red Lake, Ontario. Lots of water to fish from there."
1052673,guidedfishing,2008-09-01 17:24:00,531,"Rich B. There is a whole lot of Canada you can camp. I am mostly famaliar with Ontario and usually make 3 to 4 trips annually. I usually camp on the first two to three trips, the last trip we always get a cabin. Here is what I can tell you from fishing / camping Northwest Ontario. If you are camping on crown land you will need to get permits at $10.00 per person per day. If you are on paper company land that varies from $20.00 a day to $100.00 for the seaon. There are areas that are restricted to camping as well so make sure you check the area you intend to go as you can not always throw a tent up where ever you want. Also, keep in mind that if you camp your bag limit is reduced to half regardless of whether or not you purchased a sportsman's license. This usually means two walleyes a day per person. This is never a big deal with us as we don't go to keep a mess a fish. We usually load the boats and travel in anywhere from 10 - 20 miles depending on where we go. I can tell you that if you camp you better make sure the people you go with are up for the task. You will find out just what kind of fishing buddies you have after 3 - 4 days of sleet and snow with highs struggling into the 40's, or the bugs being so bad that there is no relief anywhere but zipped up in a hot tent. That being said I enjoy camping and the good far outways the bad. Weight is always a consideration, We don't take generators in because of the weight we don't need them. Not sure what you need electricty for but there are ways to get around it for sure. We usually spend at least a week in. After packing in gas for the boats, coolers, cooking supplies, and gear there is not alot of room left in the boat. Bears can also be a consideration so be prepared to deal with your visitors. (Mainly keep you camp clean and your food protected so it does not get pillaged) camping on an Island is great but not always available. Another point to consider is most Canadian shield lakes are not friendly to a boat on shore there are not a lot of places where you will be able to beach a boat the best you will find is a spot where it won't get beaten to badly in the rocks. That being said my best memories are camping with my son and waking up at the waters edge listening to the loons along with sitting around the camp fire at night. Along with some very awesome fishing. Good luck GF"
1052682,Guest,2008-09-01 18:01:00,0,Whitewing Resort on Lac Seul has spaces for tents and RVs with electricity. You can launch and dock your boat right there. They have gas and bait available and have a bar and restaurant if you wish to have meals provided. For more info go to www.whitewingresort.com.
1052689,Obabikon,2008-09-01 18:21:00,2370,"If you're going to camp, I'd go ahead and do remote. Find a lake that nobody's around. (but, that's just me) You can purchase a portable generator. If you choose Morson out of lake of the woods, I'd be willing to loan you mine for a few days for free (and mark some awesome camp sites)"
1052692,Bill Krejca,2008-09-01 18:55:00,6107,"Richard, If you decide to accept Obab's very generous offer, let me know, and I'll share with you where our old camp furniture is hidden (you never store your stuff on the same island you camp on, otherwise the stuff gets used to death, and the island ends up resembling a park campground with little grass, lots of tree roots to trip over, and garbage accumulation). When we used to camp, we'd go either in May or September to minimize bugs. If you have to wait until school is out, go as early as you can; it becomes close to unbearable in the evening as the summer air temperature escalates, even worse if there is a fire ban. Bill Krejca"
1052751,Richard B,2008-09-02 07:17:00,735,"I should have been more specific. Our group, at this time, will include 3 adults and 3 children. We are looking for an area to camp in Ontario. The entire group including the kids camp out at least 2 weeks a year. One week is for fishing in the spring/summer and the other week is in November for deer gun season. We have 2 Cabelas 6 man extreme outfitter tents, with vestibules, cots, all the coleman stoves and lanterns that we will ever need, and a 3500 watt generator. We also have 2 20 foot boats, which could possibly be a problem to launch on some of the smaller lakes. Everyone is spot on as far as us trying to find a secluded area to just have a nice relaxing week were we can get into some fantastic fishing without fighting the crowds of people. Thanks for all the input so far."
1052757,Jimmy Jig,2008-09-02 07:34:00,1905,I thought only Canadians were allowed to camp on government ground? I know you used to be able to years ago. Has this changed??
1052760,Bill Krejca,2008-09-02 07:47:00,6107,"Certain areas, i.e., Whitefish Bay, et al, are off limits to non-Canadians. Many areas, with the required permits and restricted limits, are still available for us US folks. Bill Krejca"
1053238,Dore,2008-09-04 06:59:00,43,"Not sure where your from, but there are several great spots in Quebec. We go every year to a goverment run camp site at Lac Albanel in northern Quebec. Reasonable rates, great location & service . Met a group from PA & Mass up there this year. Great fishing for Lakers, Walleye & Pike"
