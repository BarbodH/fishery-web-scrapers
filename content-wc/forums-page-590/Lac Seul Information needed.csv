515373,wheels,2001-11-02 07:44:00,959,"We have decided that Lac Seul is the place we want to go for our fishing vacation next year. Now the big problem is where on Lac Seul. There will be 3 of us and we are looking for a great trip including everything from boats, to meals, to a guide. I guess this is the standard ""American Plan"". Of course, fishing would have to be great. Which end is better? I have read a lot about both Ear Falls, and Sioux Lookout. Prefer to drive to the site, no boat-in or fly-in locations. We will try to go in late May, or early June.Thank you for any suggestions or hits you may have to help our trip be more sucessful.""Friends don't let friends fish for trout!"""
515374,Glenn,2001-11-02 10:09:00,17,"I haven't been there in the last 2 years, but was there for about 5 or 6 years in a row before....stayed at Dave's Fisherman's Cove and was really treated fine. We did our own cooking but know that he had that availale also.We went in June and fished an area known as the ""sand banks"" and it was about a 7 mile trip evey morning so if you are renting your boat...upgrade to the 40 hp. Caught a lot of fish and some nice ones....mainly fished wallys and normally had a number over 25"". Have a good time!!! Glenn"

515377,Guest,2001-11-02 12:17:00,0,"I took my wife to Lac Seul at Anderson's Lodge near Sioux Lookout in early July several years ago. Great meals, knowledgable guides, and pretty good fishing. We caught alot of walleyes, a few pike, smallies and lake trout fishing on Lac Seul from Lost Lake to Bear Narrows. The size of the walleyes wasn't that great. The nice thing about Anderson's is if you want to fish another lake for another species you just set it up at the lodge. A guy I work with has went to the Ear Falls end the last two years and done well on larger (6-8 lb.) walleyes but they don't catch as many as we did on the SE end. He also has an hour ride to the place that they fish. If you have a windy day you might not get to those spots. The SE end is more wind protected because it consists of a lot of narrow bays and islands. Hope this helps."
515378,Byron,2001-11-07 18:42:00,42,"I have fished Lac Suel 5 times since '96. Everytime I went, I caught a lot of fish. When I first started fishing the lake, I fished mainly for Pike. I didn't know how to fish for walleye. On the third trip I began to hunt for walleye. I had found this board, and read everything I could. I went this last June and caught over 400 walleye (I counted every one of them)in 6 days of fishing. One of my partners did better than I did. Our other partner was to busy bragging about how good of a walleye fisherman he was - he didn't do as well. Okay, I'm through bragging. I just wanted you to know how great Lac Suel is, and how valuable this board is - listen to their wisdom.Now, location. I have fished the north end (Ear Falls area), middle (Fisherman's cove area), and the south end (Sioux Falls area) they are all great, however I like Fisherman's Cove Fishing Camp and the area. As another poster has said, Dan and Keith treat you great. I also fished the sand banks (I think it is more like 15 miles from camp), and other areas away from camp. But, didn't like the long boat ride, even with a 40 horse power engine. Dan told me most folks comming up his way feel like they have to go a long distance to do real fishing. With a few tips from him, I never went further than 3 miles from camp, and caught bigger fish, including a ten pound walleye and a 22 pound pike - CATCH and RELEASE. Good luck."
515379,Jigger1,2001-11-08 16:41:00,234,"I can't speak for any other part of the lake, but in my book the central part of Lac Seul can't be beat. In my 8.5 days of fishing over the last two years I've personally landed 23 walleyes over 24"" including 4-27's, 2-28's, and one 29"". I've caught a total of 59 walleyes over the slot and no idea how many under 18"", but I can assure you it's a ton. The boat totals are 40 over 24"" and a total of 143 over the slot.We fish out of Silver Water Wheel Lodge (www.sww-lodge.com) which is located 42 miles north of Dryden. The last 30 miles are on a somewhat rough dirt road, but it's worth the trip. This place is first class all the way around. A spectacular owner in Mike Willems, fantastic guides who are fishing students, ultra clean cabins, incredible shore lunches, 18' Lund Pro V boats and more. I'm here to tell you that you'll be hard pressed to find anything better!Your only problem will be to find an opening. If I'm not mistaken the entire 2002 season is in the bag, however don't take my word for it, give Mike a call it will be worth the call.Good luck on your hunt!"

I've been up 16 years in a row at Sioux lookout and always had good action for all species. It's fun when you can take a whole day to go after just one species.Good luck!"
515376,WCoyote,2001-11-11 20:22:00,200,I will second the high rating for Anderson's south of Souix Lookout. They do an outstanding job. You'll have a great time.
