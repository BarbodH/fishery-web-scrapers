1076970,Richard B,2009-01-29 10:10:00,735,I have not fished Blind River but I have fished the Spanish River out of Brennan Harbor. The north channel is not very busy at all. We very rarely saw other boats. We used to go the week of July 4th and caught tons of walleye and pike. Smallmouth fishing was decent but you had to work at it.

1077369,Richard B,2009-01-30 14:32:00,735,"Our group stayed at Brennan Harbor 3 out of the last 5 years, we did not go last year, always the week of July 4th. We had 6 kids, from 10 to 16 yrs old, and 5 adults. This area is very nice. It is not a fly in by any means but you will feel like you are in the middle of nowhere most of the time. Normally we would not see anyone else except people from our group. The camp got better every year. Rej and Linda were fantastic. They had a gentleman, Shorty, that worked the docks, filleted your fish if you wanted him to, and would tell you where to fish. If he is still there and you go listen to him very carefully with a map in hand! They were constantly updating the grounds and the cabins. Beds and cabins were very comfortable. All of our pike fishing were caught done casting. My son, daughter, and I caught and released 15 pike on 15 consecutive casts 2 years ago. They ranged in size from 25"" to 36"". All of us were throwing different color combinations of homemade 1/2 oz inline spinners. For walleye we cast, used bottom bouncers, and trolled. In one day my kids and I caught over 45 walleye ranging from 16 to 24. It was a great to see the kids anticipating the next fish and guessing how long it was! The lake does get ROUGH, but only with westerly winds. There are so many islands that if the wind comes from any other direction you can go just about wherever you want. One of the things that I like about it is if the lake does get rough you can fish the river. The Spanish River is over 40 miles long and does have some decent fish even in July. We have been told by other guests at the resort that when the walleye are spawning the river is the place to be. I have seen pictures of monster walleye caught in the spring. In my opinion this is not an area for small boats, unless you fish the river every day. The rental boats are nice but they need more horsepower for any serious running. We only rented one boat, the rest of us had our own rigs. The members of the group that had there own rigs normally ran a minimum of 15 to 20 miles per day. (At 60 mph it doesn't take to long to go anywhere.) Last year winter the owner Rej and Linda sold it. We have not stayed at the resort since then so I do not know how the new owners are. But I would not hesitate to go again."
