But you had to listen close to hear it at night."
1073986,jaym,2009-01-15 14:27:00,89,We are taking the train from Sioux Lookout to Flindt Landing fishing camp for the first time this year to cut back on the cost of flying. I am looking for recommendations for a place to stay the night before as the train leaves early in the morning. Any info will be appreciated. Thanks

The owners live in Indiana and the lodge itself has a unique history. Train Drops you off and then picks you up by the side of the tracks. We have driven, boated, flew and portaged but never trained. With all the different alternatives to flying I am curious why you choose this camp. The fishing does look great and it appears to be really remote. Please let us know how it is.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1074131,Guest,2009-01-16 11:39:00,0,"Hey V-bay Gord, Sorry, I guess not everyone shares your ""perspective"" and doesn't enjoy listening to trains at night while trying to sleep or watch a train roll by while fishing. Maybe you like jet skis circling your boat while you fish too? Guess that just makes you special, or perhaps others realize the Canadian Wilderness extends beyond Vermilion Bay?"
1074142,Skywagon,2009-01-16 13:16:00,1106,"Gord, if we lived where he does, it might be a little easier to understand his perspective. My friends and family that come up from the farm in central Illinois comment on how quiet it is, even if on occasion a train can be heard from 3 miles away. I guess the Chicago area must be a lot quieter than there. I will have to admit, a noisy helicopter did fly over the other day and I did see someone else ice fishing on the lake. I am thinking about moving farther north, it is getting ridiculous."
1074144,jaym,2009-01-16 13:24:00,89,"Larry Mac, I used to work with Bob Collins. His wife owns and operates the camp since her father pasted away a few years ago. After years of going to a drive to camp by Pickle Lake we decided to try Flindt Landing after talking to Bob. We have been going to Flindt about 10 years now. The cabins are nice and being the only camp on the lake you normally don't see any other boats. The tracks only intersect the lake at the south end at about a 90' angle and you don't hear them when you are out on the lake. While in camp you pretty much ignore them and as noted in other threads after a full day of fishing we don't hear anything at night. The fishing went from good to great as our knowledge of the lake grew. We have caught walleyes up to 28"" and even though we don't fish for pike we have caught them up to 42"". Can't wait to get back up there and having a cold Blue after a day of fishing. Hope this helps, if you need anymore info let me know."

1078220,v-bay gord,2009-02-03 08:08:00,3168,"Hey WGN.........I thought it was ironic that some topics were discussing the sound of a train ruining the wilderness experience and here was someone actually taking a train to get into the Canadian wilderness. I thought my post was quite witty and in no way was derogatory to the person taking the train. I guess you felt otherwise. By the way I do feel ""special"", do not like jet skis, do appreciate that not everyone likes trains and do realize what lies beyond Vermilion Bay. I also am not afraid to log in to express my opinions...you should try it some time."
