1077672,Larry Mac,2009-01-31 15:46:00,530,"Hi Topjimmy, check out the previous thread from ILScott entitled ""How to decide where to go"" It talks about listing criteria you would like on your trip i.e. Price, location, American or Housekeeping plan. Once you have that list present it to the forum and you will receive amazing responses and suggestions. There is wealth of knowledge about the Canadian Wilderness on this website. Check out the thread ""Who is going where and why"" that I posted and see some of the amazing places posted. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1077785,MN_Moose,2009-02-01 09:19:00,965,I recommend Al Smith of Smith Camps. He has a great boat and can take you see many things on Lake Of The Woods. If you're looking for a fishing guide Al is great there too. Plus he makes the best shore lunch.
