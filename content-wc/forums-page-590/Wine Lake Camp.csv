Thanks to all!"
1076314,ILScott,2009-01-26 20:48:00,139,"Phish,I have been going to Wine Lake since 2000. The camp and cabins are clean. There is no running water and no indoor plumbing or electric. He has propane refrig and stoves in the cabins. The lights are white gas colemans. He does have a shower house to use. 16 foot lund boats. As you can see we do return and love it. The portage isn't that bad but crossing Wabaskang can get rough. It is secluded with the possiblities of fishing up to eight lakes. The most in camp is usually around 30 people. Fishing go to www.ontarioanglerawards.com and search wine lake. The walleye fishing has been good, with a group last year catching 100 one day. The smallmouth are starting to show up everywhere but their are a couple of spots that hold more than others. The trout fishing is good almost all year. There is one lake that has only lake trout in it and that would be a walk up a hill. Another outer lake has walleye only. I have never been up to Wabaskang for its fishing. We cross it and it is a big body of water. But I will tell you that last year we saw 3 different groups fishing in Wine from the Wabaskang resorts througout the week. One of the lakes they go into is a walleye lake, so it tells me the walleye fishing in Wabaskang isn't that great. I talked to a gentleman at a sports show this winter and he stayed on Wabaskang and fished on Wine one day and said it was better fishing in Wine. Any other questions please pm me.Scott"

However, those who fish Wabaskang regularly will tell you it is an outstanding walleye, northern, and bass lake. There are many secluded areas to fish on the lake, especially if you go into McCloud, Aerobus, Ruby, or Keynote sections of the lake. The resorts on the lake are all great IMHO after talking with many others throughout the years. I will admit that walleyes can be tough to catch during the hot summer months, especially if you are not willing to fish in the weeds. But if you are you will catch plenty. Its best months are all of May,June and then again last 2 weeks of Aug and all of Sept. I think guys that portage down into Wine for the day are mostly from Peffleys camp looking for a different area to fish or explore...heck, if I stayed at Peffley's and was that close to the falls I would rent a boat for the day and do it also. I don't think they are generally going there because the fishing is that much better down there. Bottom line is both lakes are good lakes that have their strong points or better than the other at certain times of the season. Personally, for the price and convenience, I'd stick with a Wabaskang resort but that's not to take anything away from Wine because its a great place as well. If you want an idea of the fishing check out the various websites like wabaskangcamp or peffleys or tall pines and you will get an idea of whats out there. I stay up there 5 to 6 weeks a year and can't get enough of it. Mike"

The first time with the son-in-law & two grandsons & everybody caught fish. We would fish walleye in the mornings & either Pike or Smallies the rest of the day. The second time it was the wife & I in 2008 late July early August. Like Mike said above we were fishing the weeds & catching fish in the bay to the west of the Red Cabin which anybody that has been there will know what I am talking about. Of course she caught the big fish of everything but Smallies. The truth of the matter is i have been to the Ear Falls/Red Lake area 10 times & they were all good people/camps/fishing. Later, Jay"
