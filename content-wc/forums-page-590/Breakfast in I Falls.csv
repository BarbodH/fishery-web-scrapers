1075794,Hammerhead Herb,2009-01-24 17:21:00,259,"You might try the La Place Rendez-Vous Hotel slightly east of Fort Frances. On the way up to Ear Falls, we stopped here for breakfast last year instead of on the US side. That way, we could be across the border a little earlier. You can find more about it at http://www.rendezvoushotel.com/ . Look on their dining link."
