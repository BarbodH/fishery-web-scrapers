1073552,bassface44,2009-01-13 16:44:00,96,My group needs to stay one night in Kenora before we head out on a houseboat trip. Does anyone have a hotel recommendation there? Any horror stories we need to know about?
1073555,Obabikon,2009-01-13 17:07:00,2370,just make sure it's not the same weekend as the KBI... lol.
1073556,Guest,2009-01-13 17:07:00,0,please ask your hotel if they are smoke free as many have become smoke free in the area.
1073559,dewyg,2009-01-13 17:36:00,1006,I believe all hotels are now smoke free. Super 8 is clean with a nice restaraunt/bar. I believe all hotels are now smoke free. The parking lot is safe as well.

I make good time, eat good food and am not pinned down by motel reservations. It may not be the thing for everybody, but it's working well for me. We've become pretty good at pitching a tent in the dark. Rain doesn't present a problem because we have a tent to keep it off us."
1073693,bassface44,2009-01-14 10:50:00,96,Thanks for all the input. I think we are going to go with the Best Western due to the central location. I just wanted to know if there were any horror stories out there we should be aware of. Tight lines.
1073771,RANDY @ ORD,2009-01-14 16:41:00,13,Best Western is a good choice. Check this WEB cam which is on top of the Best Western. You can move the camera to see most of the town. The Safeway store across the street is a good place for last minute items.http://www.gokenora.com/webcam.shtml
