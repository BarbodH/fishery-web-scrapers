1077560,Jahloaf,2009-01-31 08:26:00,74,"What about OV and Molson Canadian?I can get Canadian here in Iowa and I kinda like it, whats its status in The Great White North?"
1077630,joeman79,2009-01-31 13:13:00,417,I love Kokanee in the bottle. It aint bad in the can either.
1076460,Obabikon,2009-01-27 10:47:00,2370,"Retire, That's an excellent thought for those going to resorts that charge in Canadian. There's little or no chance (in my mind) that the US dollar stays artificially strong for much longer."
1076471,Guest,2009-01-27 11:23:00,0,"What makes it ""artificially"" strong?"
1076532,retire55,2009-01-27 15:26:00,1029,"Reserve currency is one major possibility. The United States dollar is the most important reserve currency in the world today. Throughout the last decade, an average of two thirds of the total allocated foreign exchange reserves of countries have been in U.S. dollars. For this reason, the U.S. dollar is said to have ""reserve-currency status"", making it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher deficits with greatly postponed economic impact."
1076667,v-bay gord,2009-01-28 07:38:00,3168,"People always have the option of prepaying part of their trip when the exchange rates are high, if they are staying at a resort that is charging in Cdn $. Of course, it is a tough call to know when to pick the moment when it has peaked. I'm still of the opinion the exchange rate will hover around the 15% level for this summer. That's a significant savings for US travels......not so good for those heading south."
1076694,Guest,2009-01-28 09:43:00,0,"You are absolutely right! While it's true nobody could offer definitives at this point, there is a much greater chance the value of the Cdn $ relative to the US $ will increase rather than decrease in the near-future, and almost unequivocally in the longer term. And I have perhaps worse news for you guys south of the border....Crystal is finished!! This made big news here in Thunder Bay and across NWO a few months ago when it was announced, as this area was noted for the highest sales of Crystal anywhere. The last Crystal Keg ran dry at the curling club a couple weeks ago. At $10/pitcher she was a fine beer!! NWO Fishing Bum"
1076821,Adam Schlaeger,2009-01-28 18:44:00,4,"It will all depend on the price of a barrel of oil. If the speculators stop staring the markets it will be cheap and I would predict to see the exchange around 1.25 to 1.35, but if the price goes up, we could be seeing a one for one again. As far as the Crystal is fine and dandy, but nothing beats a nice bottle of labatts and a cuban sitting by the fire at night talking about the day on the water.adam"
1076884,lnagy,2009-01-28 23:25:00,16,Bet you won't even be thinking about money while your setting therewith a cold brew in one hand and a deep-fried fillet in the other!Pass it on! Take a kid fishing......
1076941,Jahloaf,2009-01-29 08:27:00,74,"NO More Crystal,,,, now I have to find a new favorite,,,,, Guess I can spend some time in Ft. Frances on our first night sampling the different brews available, anybody have a suggestion?"
1077253,Guest,2009-01-30 08:17:00,0,Try the Kokanee
1077255,Lazy Fisherman,2009-01-30 08:29:00,276,I would also pick Kokanee
1075495,Jahloaf,2009-01-23 08:46:00,74,"I see the exchange rate for the $ is around 1.24 as of today, any guesses on what it will be by June? I hope its around 1.36 that way when I buy my 3 cases of Crystal in Kenora it doesnt seem to hurt as bad. Nothing better to wash down some fresh fried walleye fillets and fried taters then a cold brew."
1075507,v-bay gord,2009-01-23 09:31:00,3168,"I think when the price of a barrel of oil starts creeping back up you will see the exchange rate difference start to shrink. I'm hoping for at least a rate of 1.15...maybe up to 1.20. I don't think we'll see the 1.35 you're hoping for, but then who knows in this crazy economic environment. We may be bartering chickens and turnips for haircuts and fishing trips in the future."
1075516,Andre (wallyandre),2009-01-23 10:05:00,2274,I hope it will be at 1.15 I'm crossing the border from Canada to US every week-end in summer and I love to spend my money in the US when the rates are good.
1075518,joeman79,2009-01-23 10:09:00,417,"What is Crystal? And I predict $2.50 gas by June. Kokanee in the Bottle and a plate of fried walleye and taters omg I am so ready for summer. 7 long months to wait, I need to quit thinkin about that."
1075519,Obabikon,2009-01-23 10:15:00,2370,"Crystal is a popular beer in Ontario... not my favorite, but many people love it. I'm going to guess closer to 1.10... gas prices will increase which will help the Canadian economy, and hurt the US economy. I'm hoping it's much better than that, but I'm not optomistic about the US economy... only time will tell."
1075520,Bill Krejca,2009-01-23 10:19:00,6107,"As financial advisers say, ""If it goes up fast, it can go down just as fast"", or the other way around. It's any body's guess, few would have thought last year that today's differential would be as it is. Bill Krejca"
1075551,Jahloaf,2009-01-23 13:26:00,74,"You are right on the exchange rate, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things just nice to dream that for a change I make out for the better. Crystal is a beer in Ontario, made by the Labatts company I beleive.I enjoy Molson Canadian too,,, actually any Canadian beer from a bottle tastes so much better when out on the lake."
1075741,oldntired,2009-01-24 11:35:00,57,"By June the economy will be back, all the beer will be on sale, all the days will be sunny and warm, all the girls will be smiling and all the fish will be biting. (sigh)"
1076360,MN_Moose,2009-01-27 06:47:00,965,Amen Brother!
1076432,retire55,2009-01-27 09:04:00,1029,Just an opinion but I'll suggest you might consider exchanging your US $ for some CDN $ at the current rate of exchange. Two reasons. It's just a question of time before the price of oil increases (driving the CDN $ higher) and the printing of several trillion new US $ (stimulus package + bail out costs) drives the US $ down.
