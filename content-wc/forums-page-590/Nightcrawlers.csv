We put our crawlers in new bedding just before leaving (2 dozen in a styrafoam container) keep them cool on the way up then either put them in the refrig. or keep ice jugs in a cooler, never have any trouble with them. Take care of them because your fishing is directly proportional to your bait being good!"
1076614,Guest,2009-01-27 20:43:00,0,"We use a large styrofoam cooler. Since we have a weight restriction and take our own food, we will pack some frozen meals on top of the crawlers for the flight in.. Once we get to the outpost we put some ice in plastic bags and add to the top of the crawlers..Keeps them in great shape all week..The outfitter has a boat/maintenance shed and we can keep the crawlers there for the week.. I have fished several different lakes in Manitoba and NW Ontario and nothing beats a live crawler on a bottom bouncer and worm harness.. We have tried numerous plastics and Gulp crawlers with this method and the real deal always outfishes the plastic.. Jigging is a different story and we catch all the fish we want on plastics.. Gulp minnows have really worked well for us.."
1077526,lassh,2009-01-31 06:37:00,553,We use the styrofoam shipping containers like the Eyes R Us post. We keep the container under the cabin with a frozen water bottle or blue ice. I put a layer of wet news paper on top of the bedding. I've always wondered if bears would get at the crawlers. It appears they do. We have never had a problem with bears gettting the crawlers but it sounds like they sometimes do. Has anyone else had critters eat their crawlers from under the cabin? I might have to rethink where we keep them.
1077606,2746,2009-01-31 11:16:00,3206,"Yeah, we've had bears get into ours but I don't think it's the nightcrawlers that draw them. If you have bears they just get into anything you've left outside, including tackle boxes (we've retrieved those from back in the woods) soda, beer. coolers with leeches, cooking oil......you name it. If they are about, you just cam't leave anything outside. A couple of years ago at Gullrock 6 of us guys, all in our underwear at 2 am, stood in the cabin watching a bear on the deck getting into the soda. When she started for the beer we quit watching and started hollering."
1074672,Guest,2009-01-19 16:07:00,0,For those of you who take your own crawlers along with you; what are your methods of keeping them at their peak health for the entire trip? What do you store them in and where do you keep them throughtout your stay. We use a large cooler with commerical bedding and use blue ice which we switch twice daily to keep them cool and we keep the cooler in the cabin. We are looking to see what other methods are being used. Thanks in advance for your advice!!!
1074685,Pooch,2009-01-19 16:39:00,4619,A plastic insulated lunch cooler with about one cubic foot or a little less and some buss bedding will keep 500 crawler's in good shape for two weeks IF the bedding isn't too wet or too dry AND you keep the cooler in the fridge. Be careful as some fridge's in camps seem to want to freeze stuff that isn't even in the freezer! We learned that many years ago when we found ice on our leech supply! The insulated cooler tends to smooth out the temperature swings. Keeping them cold also seems to keep them a little more dormant. For a week trip what you are doing has worked for us as long as the cooler is out of the sun and wind. Some guys just put an insulated flat of crawlers under the cabin. I don't know that I'd be very comfortable with that unless I was also proficient at using only plastics! Pooch
1074727,Eyes_R_Us,2009-01-19 19:40:00,66,"I use a styrofoam shipping container. They are typically used for shipping frozen steaks or seafood etc. It is about 14"" square and the styrofoam is probably 1.5 inches thick. It has a styrofoam lid and it slips inside a rugged cardboard box that comes with it. The cardboard box also has a lid you can slip off (somewhat like a printer paper box). I take it to the bait shop a few days before I leave and they fill it with bedding and crawlers and they keep it in their cooler. For the trip up I freeze 12 oz water bottles, wrap them in paper towel and throw them in the container. At camp I do the same thing and replace the bottles every day or so. I leave it in the cabin and fill up my worm totes as needed. At the end of the week I either give my extra crawlers to someone or I put them in the totes. The shipping container is then used to bring the fish home. A stop at International Falls for dry ice and they are good for the long drive home. JB"
1074811,SNOPRO,2009-01-20 08:49:00,108,Several years ago having the same delema I found a system that is incredible. I use a Coleman Thermoelectric cooler. I bought mine slightly used on ebay for about $30- $45. Our local Walmart now carries them for $89. They are a 40 quart cooler that runs off the cigarette lighter (12volt dc) or an included adapter that uses 110 volt ac. so you can keep them cool the entire week or two you're up north. They work great! No fooling with ice. The one thing I did to keep the crawlers from getting inside the cooling fins inside the cooler is I bought a clothing bag with a drawstring (keep it tied closed) at Walmart with a super fine mesh that holds in the crawlers and bedding yet allows them to beathe. Keep it plugged in and your crawlers will stay cool indefinately with no drowned worms from melted ice!!!Those electric coolers work great for your foods also! I've got 3 of them now and don't mess with any ice.
1074894,Chris K,2009-01-20 16:07:00,278,"Are you guys pulling spinners behind bottom bouncers with the crawlers? If so in my opinion, and from personal experience, I hardly ever use real crawlers anymore, and I use the Berkley Gulp 6"" ones in natural color. You no longer have to care for crawlers in the boat or back at camp and I prefer it that way, and I feel they are just as effective in that situation as live ones. Chris K"
1075117,Steve of Madison,2009-01-21 16:08:00,230,"Chris......I tried them too, worked well for spinners, but I like the real thing under a slip bobber. #4 hook and a lively nightcrawler or leech along the weedbed, sit back and get ready!"
1075137,Pooch,2009-01-21 17:27:00,4619,"I have to agree with several of the above posts. Plastic (not even Gulp type baits) on spinner rigs will probably out fish live bait on a moving spinner rig or a well worked jig.When the fish get lock jaw, the stringer is empty and fish is on the menu for supper, I want something alive on the end of my line. Otherwise plastic or a crank bait is my favorite.Actually, what ever is catching fish at the moment is my favorite.....Pooch"
1075149,bpetersen,2009-01-21 18:48:00,251,"Our system is similar to yours except in the center of the cooler I will put an icecream bucket. We put a milk jug with ice in the bucket. The bucket keeps the moisture away from the bedding so that the bedding doesn't get wet. I will change the the jug of ice out when it has melted. The ice will last 1 to 2 days, depending on the temps. As long as you keep changing the ice it will work for weeks."
1075544,jfsh,2009-01-23 12:50:00,13,"The lightweight styrofoam coolers work best for us; however, they are not tamper proof. (duh!) On a late season trip we decided to leave the worm cooler out overnight on the deck. The critters chewed around the bungee cords and through the cooler......got a bunch of em. Lesson learned. Packed in some crawlers on canoe trips years ago. We doubled up some potato sacks, put in the worm bedding....comparatively light & potable way to go. Had to always stay mindful fo the weather/elements they were exposed to though. Ken"
1075790,Guest,2009-01-24 16:26:00,0,We also had trouble one time when we let the styrafoam container of crawlers outside our cabin at night and a bear and her cubs ate every single crawler.
