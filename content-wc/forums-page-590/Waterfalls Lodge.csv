As a Tournament angler I am not going to say your going to catch a 100 fish in one day but you will be rewarded with some great size walleye and bass. I was up there last year fishing under some of the worst conditions to fish in, I had to work very hard for the walleye and I was rewarded with an average of 4 lb walleyes, each evening we went out to one of the many points on the lakes and caught 5 to 7 fish each night. Being first time on the water and not having much experience on the water I thought my freind and I did very well. These lakes have alot of fish species and I find when you work hard and spend some time on the water you will do well..I will be going up there again in 2009, and trying my luck for bass too...I know that this is a walleye board, but boy did we catch alot of pike between 2 and 6 pounds, and lost a few over 10 pounds....I recomend if you go to this great lodge hire a guide for half a day he will get you started...GOOD FISHING..."
1076616,Guest,2009-01-27 20:45:00,0,I have been thinking about going to this lodge for years. What i do not like about this lake is all the big fish i see are on the dock. Looks like a great lake and fishing looks good. But i am concerned about all the big fish i see taken out of the lake? How is the fishing in the fall? Thanks for any info steve
