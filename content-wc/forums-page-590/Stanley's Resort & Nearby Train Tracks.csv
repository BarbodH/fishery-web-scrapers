1074019,Flip Silverlake,2009-01-15 16:48:00,645,"I worked for the C&NW in Escanaba Mi and we made sure everyone in town knew we were coming into town, what else is that locomotive horn good for!"
1074028,MartyT,2009-01-15 17:33:00,23,"Stanley's certainly does look to be top-flight. And I probably *am* nit picking. But I know how my little brain works and it'll just drive me nuts even if I only hear a train once... I've found what I think is going to be an excellent alternative, albeit another couple of hours up the road: Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang Lake - it's a boat-in camp but has modern cabins with electricity and running water (both required by my wife and kids!) - and no train tracks for about a hundred miles... I talked to the owner and he pretty much sold me on the place (along with the consistently positive comments about it that I've read here as well). They've got wireless internet but I think I'll just leave the laptop home, go up there and ""unplug"" for the week..."
1074037,Eyes_R_Us,2009-01-15 18:25:00,66,It has been many years since I stayed at Stanley's but I don't remember hearing any trains. May be for all the reasons the other guys mentioned or it may have been the Labatts. I do remember seeing a train go by when we were on one of the portage lakes just West of camp but that was kinda cool. Good luck with your decision. I understand what you are going through as I do that to myself all the time. JB
1074176,MNRambler,2009-01-16 15:41:00,5,"Don't want hijack the thread either but here goes - - I've got a trip booked at that resort in early June. Myself and my two sons, can't wait!! What type of fishing should I expect? Presentations for eyes? What about the portage lakes, are they productive in early June? Just wondering what to be prepared for. Thanks, I very, very much appreciate any info that you folks have!"
1074724,tackleman,2009-01-19 19:35:00,444,"I'm fortunate to have a friend who has a cabin next door to stanleys camp and i'm able to use it any time I want. that said, I have spent many days and nights there over the past 20 years, sure the trains run by, but the tracks are not 100 yards away, they are over a mile away and the sound you hear reminds me of a jet flying by, kinda a distant rumbling, but not a loud rumbling.In the north we have the CNR and the CPR, both have tracks that run past Vermilion Bay, so if you don't want to hear a train you have to go north of Red Lake Road,Since I live south of Red Lake (about 100 miles north of red lake road rail tracks), I notice the sound since we don't have train noises as part of a daily life feature.As one of the posters claimed, when you fish Crabclaw (one of the portage lakes) you wil see the trains on the tracks as they pass by, but the trains are not an every hour event, maybe 2 or 3 a day, If hearing a train is going to ruin your trip, look elsewhere, but let me tell you, I know Robert at Stanleys runs a first class operation and has good equipment to use. you would not be disappointed by this resort, did I mention the cabins are really spectacular. I would gladly take anyone of them for my house.I hope you choose the place that is best for your wants and enjoy your trip to our little part of paradise."
1077288,Zee,2009-01-30 10:15:00,49,I've stayed at Stanleys 10-12 times and the trails were never a problem. It's a good place and you'll enjoy youeself. After a day on the water sleeeping will be no worry.
1077291,Zee,2009-01-30 10:24:00,49,Don't worry about the trains at Stanley's. I've stayed there 10-12 times and they aren't any trouble. If you're out fishing all day you won't know there are trains in the area.
1078311,jfsh,2009-02-03 15:56:00,13,"The camp we visit in the fall is near Atikokan. The trains, at most 1 or 2 during the night, are within 100 yds. of our cabin. For many of the reasons already mentioned we rarely notice them, day or night. No one from our group of eight guys complained (yet) and none of us live near train tracks. Hope you have a great trip(s) this year! ""Sounds like iron horse causing consternation amongst warriors, KemoSabe"" ""No Tonto, perhaps its cabin fever."""
1078329,Guest,2009-02-03 17:22:00,0,"Great selection! We stayed there under the previous owner, but have heard nothing but good reports on the new. You'll have a 30-40 minute launch ride back to the resort and will be that far from from any sounds of civilization. Most of the resorts for Wabbie are on the East and Southern part of the lake so you won't see a lot of boat traffic if you travel away from the resort. Lot's of variety of fishing too. Hit the smallies early or late, 'eyes between and hammer handles all day long. If you want to hit extra ""meat"", go to mudlake and slip for jumbo perch. Have a blast...what time of year are you going? Craig"
1073741,MartyT,2009-01-14 14:54:00,23,"I'm just about ready to book at week at Stanley's Resort, but...In looking at the Google map of the area, there's a freight train track about 1/2 mile from the resort. The last thing I want to hear on a Canadian ""wilderness"" vacation is trains going by at all hours of the day and night. Can anyone familiar with that resort tell me whether you can actually hear the trains going by and how frequently they pass?"
1073744,dutchboy,2009-01-14 15:14:00,5717,I can't speak about Stanley's but I did stay at a resort on Eagle Lake a few years back. When I drove across the tracks into the resort my heart sank thinking the same thing you thought! How the heck will I ever sleepThe first night I did hear the train around 5 am go by. After that once I hit the pillow I was out. The combination of the fresh air and a long day on the water just did me in!I would be more concerned on locating the cabin you will be in. Mind was maybe 100 yards from the tracks and like I said it didn't bother me.Best of luck and enjoy your trip.
1073749,v-bay gord,2009-01-14 15:43:00,3168,"You could ask the resort owner that question. Here in Vermilion Bay we have trains and yes, you hear them. Part of the Canadian wilderness from my perspective though."
1073788,fishmaster,2009-01-14 17:23:00,209,It probably won't even bother you I don't even hear the train. Fresh air and loons singing and you are off to lullaby land
1073796,Golden Eagle,2009-01-14 17:57:00,2642,"In the 40's we had a well traveled train track practically in our back yard. In 1955-56 while in Camp Casey, Korea I welcomed the sound of a train whistle, especially at night. September 1956 I rode a train from Seattle to Milwaukee. Great ride. Great scenery. Great sounds. Great memories. Trains produce good sounds."
1073797,Obabikon,2009-01-14 17:58:00,2370,"I haven't heard a middle of the night loon in two years... i sleep too well. As mentioned, fresh air and long days make for sweet dreams!"
1073804,Nimstug,2009-01-14 18:16:00,2605,"Not to highjack this, but I went fishing with a (now former) brother-in-law in Gladstone, Mi. He made reservations at the Bombay Motel - yes, that was the name. Tracks ran maybe 25 yards behind the motel and when they came through with horn blasting, I thought they were coming right through the room. Never again-for lots of reasons!Nimstug"
1073832,MartyT,2009-01-14 20:05:00,23,"Thanks for the replies. The reason I ask is that there is a train track about a mile from my house and when the wind is blowing just right, it sounds like they're coming through the bedroom window. Been here 10 years and it still wakes me up... Definitely not something I'm going to put up with on a vacation - it's one of those ""little things"" that is admittedly pretty minor bu will get under my skin and irritate me all week..."
1073861,Guest,2009-01-14 22:20:00,0,Stanley's is a very nice resort run well by good people. I don't remember ever hearing a train but then we were out fishing most of the day.
1074017,Flip Silverlake,2009-01-15 16:46:00,645,"First out the rail traffic is not that heavy in that area. I have a place on Pine Portage Bay on Lake of The Woods that if I'm not mistaken is about the same distance from the tracks as Stanley's is. I have heard trains but it's way off in the distance and is not a problem. Secondly the accommodations at Stanley's, if their web site is accurate, look to be second to none. In fact I'd stay there even if the railroad tracks ran right through the middle of the place! I think your nit picking now."
