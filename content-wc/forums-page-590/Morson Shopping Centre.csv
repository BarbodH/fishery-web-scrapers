Came from someone who talked directly to Terry Gill. The marina will still be open and some of the fishing hardware will be moved there. So for anyone who stops there to get supplies should get'em before heading to Morson. Also from what I understand they won't be selling gas at the shopping centre but will still have it at the Marina."
