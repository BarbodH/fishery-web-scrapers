522935,Guest,2002-07-26 10:58:00,0,How late during the fall has anyone fished walleye on Lac Seul? What area(s)? I'm from WI and can only travel to Ontario beginning of Oct. til freeze-up. Would like to try this famous body of water! Any accommodations recommended this time of year?
522936,Guest,2002-07-26 18:00:00,0,"Latest I've fished LS in 2 week in Sept. Sept can be warm or cool.Usually the leaves on the Birch trees start turning by the start of the 2nd week. Daytime extreme temps range from 45-80 degrees, generally highs top out around 60-65 lows 30-45. Unless it is an abnormal fall you should be able to get some fishing done in Oct. Resort owners will be able to give you all the info you need. Many start closing up by then. Suggest you start calling around.Tight lines...."

The weather was below frezzing at night (low 30 upper 20 ) and mostly high in the 40's during the day. It did snow one day, but it did not hurt the fishing. When the sun was out during the day it was very pleasant. I would love to do it again some time. Some advice: try to keep your hands out of the water as much as possible its cold"
522939,Guest,2002-07-27 16:52:00,0,been fishing lac seul in mid to late sept for past 8 years. can be very cold and wet but can also be very nice. mid sept to mid oct is a roll of the dice. try mahkwa lodge about 25 miles n/nw of hudson. they are open until oct 15. a little tough to get to . last 15-20 miles are gravel and you have a very short boat in also. located on/near reservation land.worth the effort to get there. I drive up from mauston area. great fishing. fall walleye and northerns can be fantastic. will not go anywhere else. better fishing than fly ins that I have been on.good luck
