522799,phishfearme,2002-07-27 08:51:00,1242,thanks for the info - i woulda guessed the laker's weight to be more than 12 pounds but maybe it was just wishful thinking. still would like to see a conversions chart if anyone has one.phish
522800,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-07-27 17:44:00,618,I got 2 on O'ssulivan this year. 34 inch was 15.2 and the just short of 32 inch was 11.10 Both weighed with a normark digital scale zeroed before weighing. Rich

Lake Trout seem to vary a lot in the lake I fish, so without seeing the fish or having a girth measurement it will be pretty tough to really pinpoint the weight. Either way its a really nice laker."
