522952,Dave S,2002-07-26 22:39:00,314,"Jim, there are tons of northerns in Lac Seul. Fished the NW corner of Lac Seul several weeks ago for the first time. We fished primarily for walleyes but must have easily caught/ released 50 northerns a day. On a number of occasions, we would be reeling in a walleye and northern would ""Gobble Up"" the 12"" - 18"" walleyes. We caught Northerns on every thing we had in the water. Find some weeds / cattails in 5' - 8' of water and you can catch all you want to reel in. They are all over the lake, I can assure you. Lac Seul is not known for its small mouth fishing. Everyone indicated to me that the eastern side of Lac Seul provided your best opporunity to catch ""Smallies""."
522953,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-27 02:29:00,6,"Jim, Dave is right on the money. We have been fishing Lac Seul for years and the Smallmouth fishing is better now than anytime in the past that I can recall. The Smallie is more of a bonus fish that you will pick up when Walleye fishing. We fish the south east section of the lake and it does hold a reasonable amount of Smallies. Pike also show up while you are Walleye fishing and this year we caught probably 10 to 20 a day while jigging with a minnow or leech. Some of them very respectable fish. Some of the guys in our group used to fish Pike exclusivly (within the last five years) and they have had days when two guys in a boat fishing 8+ hours a day would catch 300+ pike a day. Best pattern has been hit the weed beds in large bays with 1/2 to 3/4 oz spinner baits. Fish in the weeds ,behind the weeds most anyplace you can fish around the weeds and enjoy......Good Luck"
