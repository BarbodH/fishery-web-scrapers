522737,Guest,2002-07-22 08:51:00,0,"Hello JohnAnother great week on the Gullrock. The only downside for us was we hit the May Fly hatch full swing, fishing was a little slower because of it. Still did manage to catch fish every day. It was interesting though the area's were Ranger lake, the weed beds leading into Ranger, Two island weed beds, sunken island, the flats south of Gullrock, a point south of last island heading to Gullrock, three sisters island. On the rocks they were in about 11 feet but by week end they were in 14-18 ft. For our group we only boated 20 big fish with the largest coming Friday night at 25"". That fish was caught on the islands east of the sunken island. Bud the camp owner said three days after the end of the May Fly hatch the big fish will start to bite again. He was exatly right because on Thursday and Friday we caught all the big fish. In fact Friday morning on the sunken island we caught 12 of them there. It's funny this week we are in is my normal week to go but this year we backed it off a week. Next year we are back on schedule week of 7/19.I tried the clay banks without success. Someone in our camp though did catch a 42"" northern in front of the cabin at the clay banks.We tried something different this year and went perch fishing on e afternoon behind boot island and did real well. I think we brought home about 30 of them.To summerize this week and the rest of summer will be great for big fish out there. One of my co-workers is heading up week of 8/10 I am curious to see how he does later in year.What's your plans for next year?Jeff"
522738,Guest,2002-07-22 08:57:00,0,I am going up the last week of June again. Works for my son. A cabin by the clay banks? Never have seen it. Glad you had a good trip. Did you make it to church? Any problems at the border?It is a weird year @ Gull rock.
522739,Guest,2002-07-22 10:54:00,0,JohnWe did make it to church mass is at 10:45am St John's across from the IGA in town. No problems crossing border went right thru.The cabin is right where the clay banks start at the furthest end from the point. A guy from Wisconsin owns it. There is a weed bed right in front of it.By the way have you heard of a place called the 7:30pm flat south of the Gullrock itsself. I found the weedbed south of the Gullrock.Jeff
522740,Guest,2002-07-22 11:04:00,0,"I know where you are talking about. Didn't fish there this year, but two years ago we just killed them there one morning. went back the next day and nothing.Just out of curiosity, what do you do for a living and do you fish Wisconsin lakes? You are a cheesehead, right?"
522741,Guest,2002-07-22 21:03:00,0,"JohnI am from southeast Wisconsin about 30 miles west of Milwaukee.My profession is electrical engineering that pays the bills, my passion would be owning a camp but my wife is not to keen on the idea.I do fish Wisconsin lakes mainly lake Winnebago which is the largest walleye lake in our state 144,000 acres. I do fish up north a little and do some pan fishing when the walleye bite slows down in August. My wife is encouraging me to take a second trip to Gullrock in August but unfortunately do not have anyone that can go. I feel with the may fly hatch last week it made me work much harder than I had to. I would like to try this year yet without may flies on the water and see what the bite would really be like.Jeff"
522742,Guest,2002-07-23 06:25:00,0,"I too would like to have a camp, but divorce would precede. Plus, they ain't cheap. I would love to go back in September but job prohibits it.Brother-in-law has a place on Whitefish, near Hayward. Fished it once with little results. Gull rock ruins you for Wisc. and Minn. fishing."
522743,Guest,2002-07-24 11:53:00,0,"Jeff you missed it by a week, party boys are catching alot of fish and you know how much they fish!big fish today: 32in.place: Kegbait: 8in.walleye"
522744,Guest,2002-07-25 14:29:00,0,"Hello BudThanks for the info you made my day. We are set for next year. By the way if I wanted to come up in August again with one other could you accomidate? I am asking around right now to see if any would be interested.Keg is my favorite lake, in my opinion it holds the biggest fish.ThanksJeff"
