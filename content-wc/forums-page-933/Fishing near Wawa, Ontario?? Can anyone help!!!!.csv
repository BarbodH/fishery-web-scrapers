If you know of any smallmouth lakes up there I would be interested in those too.Not looking for trophys, just want to catch some fish!!!!!!!ThanksJohn"
522905,Guest,2002-07-27 14:31:00,0,I fished on Manitowik lake last year and it was pretty good for walleyes. Nothing big just nice eater sizes. The lake is north of Wawa. I've heard of Anjigami lake but don't know anything about it.

We fished at Sonny-Bob Lodge on Oba Lake. (The resort's name has changed)When we went: You travel in a passenger car, your gear in a freight car. There were a number resorts or other locations where the train will let you off. When you come back, you flag down the train and reboard. Might be an interesting variation on the standard fishing trip."
