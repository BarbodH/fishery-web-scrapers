523106,Guest,2002-07-29 18:21:00,0,Mine loads in about 15 seconds.Im on dial up not high speed.
523108,Guest,2002-07-29 19:23:00,0,"I suspect the problem is your local provider. Before you can get out to the internet you have to go through a series of routers, hubs, switches, etc. Kind of like the question of how strong is a chain?? Only as strong as the weakest linik. How quick is your internet connection??? Only as fast as the slowest connection in your path.I have a cable DSL hookup in a metro area that has just upgraded to fiber optics. A typical page on this board comes up in less than 1 second. I don't think the site server is the problem.Try clearing your cache and or deleting your temporary internet files."

523107,TomPGrouse,2002-07-29 20:45:00,124,Much slower for me too.
523110,Guest,2002-07-29 21:00:00,0,This site loads faster than any other I access. But why - I don't know and really don't care. Keep fishin
523111,BD,2002-07-29 21:17:00,739,Don't complain! I'm at the end of a seven mile stretch of old copper wire. The local phone company says I'm connecting at 52K. What a laugh. A lot of times I'm down below 1K depending on the weather and how many squirrels are running along the wire. There are no other local service providers here. Everything else is long distance. Satellite is my only other choice. I hope it's coming down in price soon.
