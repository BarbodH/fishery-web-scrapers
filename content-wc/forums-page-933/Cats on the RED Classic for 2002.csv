So I spoke with him early this morning and this is our final decision on the tournament matter. It's a go no matter how many teams we have in by the Friday August 16th, Entry Deadline. Even if we only have 40 teams entered by that time, it's still a go! Yippee! Yeah! So pass along the good word Ed. You can also pass along the word that the river is dropping rapidly to its normal summer stage and that this weekend Cats On The Red has had many anglers coming in to launch from Saskatchewan, North and South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. Many of them have told Stu and Diana that they definitely intend on entering the tourney within the next week or so. If you require further info please call. So see if you can get a memo into those fishing websites you work with and all the anglers browse through and let everyone state side know that the Cats On The Red Tourney is a definite go!

(Red River flowage chart for the Lockport Dam section of the Red River.) http://www.gov.mb.ca/natres/watres/charts/lockport.gif Lots of time yet to get in your entry for the Cats on the Red Classic for 2002. Information is available above on this forum. River levels should match last August by the end of July, and last August was big fish time last year, eh! Water levels overall on the US section of the Red River are back in the banks and fishing is on the upswing in a big way. July through early October is big fish time on the Red, don't miss the boat eh. It's......We~We~We....SUMO Piggy time! Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>"
