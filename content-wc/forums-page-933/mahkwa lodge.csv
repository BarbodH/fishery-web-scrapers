I know the walleye, northern and smallies are usually pretty good (numbers and size), but I have not seen or heard anything lately. Last any muskie being caught?"

523046,Guest,2002-07-29 08:04:00,0,"We are heading up to Mahkwa from the St. Cloud, MN area. Leaving here on Aug. 4. I think we are in #8. First time going up there for myself and my Dad. Any suggestions you might have as far as gear? We are going with a group that has been there before.Chris"
523047,whitetip1,2002-07-29 09:48:00,53,"Chris,Here's a few suggestions:Bedding (sheets, pillow cases and blankets they don't supply in houskeeping)Fan (Didn't have, wish we did)Lots of good bug sprayWater bottles (can be frozen and used for Ice and then thawed for drinking)Plastic Baits (power worms and grubs)Variety of crank baitsLots of film because the fishing is fantasticHave Fun,Dave"
523048,Guest,2002-07-29 10:07:00,0,"we typically fish for walleyes in the am with either spineer rigs or jigs tipped with minow, leech, worm etc. depends on the weather. late mornings and afternoons we switch over to northern and smallies. usually we are throwing big baits (suicks, glide baits)in the weeds and smallies in the rocks with white jigs and leeches and small cranks. you better bring a sharp knife and a big cooler to clean the all the fish. we are in the lodge for the first time, but we will be around camp. i am almost 7 feet tall and my fishing partner is 6'6''. look for us, we are tough to miss. good luck and hang on. great fishing. can be rough at times and quite intimidating, but use your map and fish finder to get out of the wind."

523050,guide7,2002-07-29 19:31:00,70,"Hey Zamboni Man: From St cloud also and was at Mahkwa the end of June. Bought our leeches in Ft Frances as you leave town on Hwy 11. Forgot the name of the bait shop but we got much nicer leeches than waiting til Dryden, like we used to do. Ya also might want to check the road construction on hwy 6 north of Crosby up to hwy 2 near Deer River. We re-routed thru Walker toward Bemidji this year to avoid the construction. Fish were well out around the islands already when we were there, and a lot of them. Border patrol held us up for over 2 hours going in. Bring your birth certificates just in case. They strongly suggested that we carry it any time we enter Canada from now on. Roads in Canada were all fine with minor construction delays on 502 from the rains they had. Good Luck 7 out"
