522873,BD,2002-07-24 22:52:00,739,"You passed through a space/time warp into a different dimension. Didn't you notice the border guards pointed ears, and purple scales? Getting through in 15 seconds must have blinded you to the fact that you were in VERY alien territory not just Canadian territory; although sometimes Canadians can seem very alien. :)"
522874,Coach Swackhammer,2002-07-25 15:39:00,1,"What about coming back? We noticed the same thing in June, but the line was when you wanted to return..."
522875,Karl,2002-07-25 19:38:00,63,"Came back on Saturday, July 13th at about 10:30AM. There were about 10 vehicles in front of me with three U.S. Customs lines open. Took less than 5 minutes."
522876,IaCraig,2002-07-25 23:00:00,434,"I had that happen last year too about 6:45 A.M. the 1st saturday in August. And it gets better, the Canada crossing Guard was a pleasant good looking young gal with a smile.IaCraig"

522878,Guest,2002-07-27 05:34:00,0,"Came through July 5 at 2 p.m. ... ""prime time"". We had just ONE vehicle in front of us. We could not believe it. Been doing this since 1993 and normally it was like 30 to 45 minutes to cross.Last year was the worst ever. The line extended down past the railroad tracks, east along the highway, and then continued east past the big curve several miles out of International Falls. It was so bad that we asked one of the International Falls locals what they do if they have to cross the border and the lines were this bad. They said they just drive down to Baudette and cross there. We decided rather than wait that we would go west 40 miles or so to Baudette and then backtrack to Emo to catch 71 north. What a big difference!!!Coming back July 18 we had TWO vehicles in front of us ... course, coming back never really was a problem."

Came back to the US a few days later and were stalled out by about half dozen US agents for about 1/2 hour.Went back thru Ft Frances June 26th and had a 3 car wait then they asked us to step inside for a visit. Immigrations lady ran full background checks on all 3 of us, after she closed the window for her 45 minute lunchbreak and made us sit and wait, and then said we were free to go check out at customs. Then the car inspection started outside. Only held up for about 2-1/2 #$%^&*# hours. The rest of our party zipped right thru and were waiting for us at the lodge.This second time, upon return to the states, the US guy smiled and said have a good day in about 15 seconds. It's a crap shoot for them too.7 out"
