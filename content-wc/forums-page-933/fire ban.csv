522667,Guest,2002-07-19 07:25:00,0,Anyone know for sure if there is a fire ban currently. I was looking on the Ontario MNR and it looks to me like you can't have afire anywhere in ontario as of tuesday until further notice.
522668,Guest,2002-07-19 08:26:00,0,Sounds about right. We just had several plane loads of people sent in to St. John's amublance due to the extensive forest fires up north.It's getting pretty bad.
522669,Fred_G,2002-07-19 09:36:00,908,I just called the MNR and was told that you can use Coleman stoves to fix shore lunch. These are not considered to be an open flame.Fred
