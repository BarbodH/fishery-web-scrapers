522896,Guest,2002-07-25 22:40:00,0,"I don't live in Toronto (thank god) but I do get there often on business. I usually stay @ SkyDome Hotel or the Westin. I have never found any type of tackle shop in downtown T.O. I would recommend that when you get to T.O have a look thru the phone book & you might possibly find some shops that way. Give them a call before venturing out & explain to them where you are staying & ask how far away they are located. I personally have never looked, but then again I live in Winnipeg & we can get almost anything we need here.Good Luck & have a fantastic time @ the Hockey Hall O' Fame (Canada 5 - USA 2 !!!! )Rob"

522898,Guest,2002-07-25 23:44:00,0,"Don't have to be ashamed. It was a entertaining game. Just understand that down south / anywhere else in the world that hockey is a game. In CANADA, hockey is life/religion. Heck, I even play in a summer hockey league ! Only one thing stops walleye fishing in Canada..... ""Coaches Corner"" hehehehehehe. Have fun in T.O & give a good rub to the loonie for me........ if it's still there. They reported that they were gonna put the loonie under plastic because all the rubbing was wearing it out. Hopefully it's there when you get thru......Have FunRob"

522901,Guest,2002-07-27 16:48:00,0,"well looking on the internet, there were 4 sporting goods around downtown Toronto that sold fishing tackle, Skinners and others. Just wanted to see if any of you Canadians would know any hot spots"
522902,Hunter,2002-07-27 17:13:00,346,"Not too many people use tot's in that area!!It's mostly big lake salmon fishing, along with alot of bow ""steelhead"" fishing in the tributaries. There are a couple of high end outer shops downtown. Ive been in a few, looked at the prices, laughed, and turned around!"
522903,515,2002-07-28 07:53:00,254,There's a great outdoors store just north of Toronto at Hwy 7 & Woodbine Ave. Its called Le barons actually on 8365 Woobine Ave. Has a little bit of everything there and i've found it to have the most reasonable prices. Another place to try is angling specialtes theres three locations in toronto area you'll have to check them out in phone book for address. As mentioned in a previous reply i would check out the yellow pages and you should find lots of places to shop. Good luck
