522806,Guest,2002-07-24 13:24:00,0,Need tips on how to caught Lakers up here too. I have never fished for them before and would like to give it a go.
522807,Karl,2002-07-24 22:18:00,63,"Fished Minnitaki the first two weeks of July. Fishing was excellent, except for the 3 days following the mayfly hatch. Redpine Bay was non-stop. Backtrolling chartruese crawler rigs produced the most fish, but jig(orange)/minnow worked almost as well. Trolling #9 Risto Raps over 18ft bars picked up a couple 5lb'ers. All walleye were caught in 12-16 feet of water. (Water temp in Redpine Bay was 74F) Air temp was in the high 80F's. Saw a cloud for about an hour one day. Other 13 days were bright blue sky. Fish bit best before 10AM and bit less frequently but consistently all day long. The mid-lake humps (21ft) were starting to hold big fish. I'd go to Redpine first though. And I'd look for them in a little deeper water. I'm going back the first week in August, so I'll find out for sure.English River has too much water going too fast this year. You can pick up shore lunch size walleye in no time though by casting a shad rap into the current and reeling it in (with a 14in walleye attached).Don't waste time on lakers. I've spent too many an hour in Lyons Bay. Only good time for them is right after spring ice-out and again when they spawn in fall. If you're desperate though, try Big Vermillion Lake for lakers in summer. Troll Little Cleo's (5/8 oz) with a half ounce rubbercore sinker about two feet up."
522808,Guest,2002-07-25 07:07:00,0,Thanks for the info let me know how you do again in August.
522809,Guest,2002-07-29 12:08:00,0,"Karl,I am heading up Aug 3 for a few days at Minnitaki. Is there any type of structure in Redpine Bay where the walleye hang? I haven't really fished the deeper areas of that bay. Where are you staying?"
