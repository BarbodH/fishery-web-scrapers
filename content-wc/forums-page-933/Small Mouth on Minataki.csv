I'm kind of contemplating an early september run for Smallmouth..I've heard the rumor that parts of LS contain smallmouth, and that Minitaki is excellent..Can anyone point me in the right direction?? ThanksCR"

I have realesed all but 1, which has been hanging on my living room wall for many years. Along with my big Walleye also caught there. All the big ones were caught on the edge of deep weed lines. Numbers found along rock rubble."

My wife set a new record this year, 10 walleye in 10 casts. Good smallmouth fishing on any rocky point with deep water access. Probably won't be able to get in this year because they're always booked, but you can check for availibility for next year. 1-807-737-2499, Good Luck, tell em Bo sent ya, he'll charge you double! Bo"
522912,Guest,2002-07-27 04:08:00,0,Pickeral Arm camp is very nice been there twice now and was very impressed. Cabins were excellent and they have everything you need right there. Bring a minneow bucket that can be locked to keep otters out otherwise you will be feeding them every night.
