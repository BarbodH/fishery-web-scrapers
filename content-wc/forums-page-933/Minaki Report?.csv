522934,Guest,2002-07-27 18:52:00,0,"Just got back from there this afternoon. Fishing was decent but not great by any means. I think the high water has a lot to do with that. It was 8 feet high when we where there and im sure it will be pretty close to the same when you arrive. We did pretty good on pike back in Gunn on spinner baits and Mepps spinners. They seemed to be on the deeper weedy shore lines. Biggest we got went 35 inches, the rest where between 15-25 with the occasional 26-30 inch fish. we didn't really fish for the muskies but did see a few casting for pike, biggest seen was between 40-46. As far as the walleyes go they were pretty tuff in all of lakes except big sand and you can E-mail me if you want more info on that. Good luck and keep us posted![email protected]"
