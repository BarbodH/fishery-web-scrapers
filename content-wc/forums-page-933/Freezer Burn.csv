If you do end up with freezer burned fish, there are a couple of things you can do instead of feeding them to your cat....Get rid of all of white portions of flesh from the thawed fillets (even my cat will not eat these pieces)Thinly slice a couple of lemons (or limes) and a large onion. Cover the bottom of a large bowl with slices of lemon and onion add a layer of the fish. Add another layer of lemon and onion, another layer of fish, etc. When you are done, add cold water to the layered mixture to cover. Cover with plastic wrap or foil, refrigerate overnight. You'll never know they were freezer burned."
522703,Karl,2002-07-28 09:56:00,63,I've found that eating them within a week of coming back eliminates any chance of freezer burn.
522704,eyewitness,2002-07-28 22:13:00,680,"I know a lot of folks who freeze in water, but the problem with that method is that when thawing, the fish that thaws first can get mushy before the rest of the fish thaws out. Rule # one with fish is to scrub the fillets completely prior to packing, freezing, and eating. Rule # two is to NOT let fish fillets sit in water. Not after cleaning, nor when thawing. They will be less fishy tasting and firmer when allowed to thaw out in the fridge WITHOUT sitting in water. As others have said already, air is what freezer burns fish. If you don't have access to a vacuum sealer (highly recommend one as they are awesome), the next best thing is to fill a fairly large deep container with water. Deep enough that the freezer bag you will be using can be submerged in a vertical fashion without laying on it's side. Then take your fillets, put them in the bag, zip the bag up and just leave the last 1/2""-1"" of the bag unsealed. Then slowly submerge the bag while GENTLY squeezing and massaging the fillets as you lower the bag almost completely underwater. At this point the water pressure will have forced all of the air out of the bag through the unsealed opening. Slowly lower the bag into the water until just the ziplock is above water and seal the rest of the way being careful to NOT get any water in the bag. The new double skinned freezer bags work great for this. Verify the bag seal prior to putting in the freezer just in case the ziplock didn't take for some reason. These fillets will last up to 6 months or more with NO freezer burn and will come out fresh and firm when thawed with NO fishy taste (assuming they were scrubbed good prior to freezing). When thawing, make sure to thaw in the fridge, NOT in the sink at room temp. Actually. that is a good rule of thumb for all fish and meat. If you need to do a quick thaw, place bag of UNOPENED fillets in a bowl of cold water with a few ice cubes in the sink. Just make sure to take them out of the water BEFORE the water gets warmer and they should be fine. On a final note. Some guys like to freeze their fillets with the skin still attached. This may work OK for Trout and Salmon, however the skin/scales on walleye and pike will have a slimey covering once thawed that if the fillets get slimed with will give that fishy taste and smell. Not recommended in my book. This may all sound basic to some, but I am amazed at how many folk don't know, or just don't care to prepare their fish and game properly. The difference in the eating experience is kind of like driving a new car. Never had one before, don't miss it. Once you've had one however, you are disappointed with less. I may sound anal about my methods, but I've converted a lot of fishing pals to this method with nothing but good feed back. Give it a try.I think you'll agree."
522692,Guest,2002-07-21 05:02:00,0,"I know vacuum-packing is the best way to prevent freezer burn,but I don't have access to a food saver. I've heard wrapping the fish in aluminum foil and then plastic or vice-versa works. The fish is already frozen and in plastic bags. Does anybody have any sure-fire proven methods for preventing freezer-burn? By the way, just got back from 2 weeks in Canada. Took B1 vitamins 10 days before I left and everyday while I was there. Don't waste your time, it doesn't work. Flies and mosquitos weren't bad this year but the no-see-ums ate me up. Thanks in advance. Bo"
522693,Denied,2002-07-21 06:59:00,768,"Bo, I've been doing this for a long time and keep fish for over a year with no problems. I use one quart zip lock freezer bags, pack the cleaned fish in one meal portions in the bags, fill bag with water, squeeze out all the air and freeze. Works for me.www.cliftond.comdean"
522695,retire55,2002-07-21 07:02:00,1029,Bo:I fully concur with Denied's post. I've been following the same procedure for years with complete success. Jay
522696,Guest,2002-07-21 07:34:00,0,"I agree with the ""water treatment"". I use cut off milk cartons or equiv and make sure to cover the fillets with water. You may need to add water if in for a long time due to evaporation.I fish 3-4 times a week, have four daughters who always bum fish and always have it in my freezer up to a year with no degradtion."
522694,Kevin B,2002-07-21 18:18:00,927,"I freeze my fillets in ""freezer ziplocks"" as mentioned above. Been doing it for 7-8 years now. Takes up much less space than the frozen milk carton method. I have eaten some fish that have been frozen for over two years. Tasted just fine. Additionally, this method has been a lifesaver when the electricity goes off or when transporting fish to relatives 500 miles away."
522697,2746,2002-07-21 20:36:00,3206,Thought that when bringing fish out of canada they had to be wrapped in such a way that they could be identified. Can you tell what you have if frozen in water?
522698,Guest,2002-07-22 06:00:00,0,"That's what I was saying. The fish are already frozen, in plastic bags without water. If I take them out of the plastic bags and put them in zip-loc baggies with water, won't the fish partially thaw out? The way I understand it, this is not a good thing."
522699,fishnut,2002-07-22 10:08:00,46,"When I return from Canada with fish frozen individually in plastic bags I then thaw them slightly to the point where they can be stuffed into cartons or cut them to size and fill with water then freeze. I have never had and ""fishy taste"" or any other problems. I have been doing this for about 40 yrs, this yr 5 trips to Canada so far.Also if I'm coming home the next day I only pack the fish caught that day on ice.I'm, sure it would not hurt to open a bag, add water and freeze.During ice fishing it is not uncommon to come home with whole fish ""stiff as a board"". Thawing to the point wher they can be filleted does not cause any problem. Sometimes overnight in fridge does the job."
522700,Kevin B,2002-07-22 19:58:00,927,"Bosbar- You don't have to fill the ziplock bags completely full. Put the fish in them, fill em full, squeeze out half the water and all the air bubbles, put em in the freezer. They'll be froze solid in a couple of hours. It's AIR that damages the flesh. I've done what fishnut has explained on several across the border trips.Larrym- If you leave a patch of skin on them, you can see it through the ziplock. But I haven't tried bringing them across the border in the ziplocks. (Has anyone tried to?). I put all my locally caught fillets in water filled ziplocks immediately after cleaning. Crossing the border, I leave them however the lodge has wrapped them and then drop 'em in ziplocks first chance I get. Just like fishnut explained."
522701,BD,2002-07-22 22:04:00,739,"Use the ""Freezer"" not the ""Storage"" bags. The freezer bags are heavier plastic. A tiny amount of water in the bag is all that is needed, just enough to make sure you have all the air out. I have been crossing the border with fish in Ziplock bags like this for years without problems."
