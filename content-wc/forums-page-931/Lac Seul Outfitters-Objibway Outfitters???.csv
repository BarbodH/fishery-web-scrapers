522967,Guest,2002-08-05 18:37:00,0,"""to the top"" means that someone is posting a reply which means that the date and time stamp of the thread is updated to the current date and time.When you look at the message board, the threads with the most recent date and time are listed first. The rest follow in sequence by date and time of their most recent update.When a thread no longer shows on page 1 but slips to page 2 or 3 because the date and time is aging and if the poster did not get the information they wanted, they will go in, create a reply, thereby resetting the date and time stamp and put their post back to page 1. Most people don't look beyond page 2 or so when they access this site, so repositioning the post to page 1 gives the original author a better chance of being seen and responded to.FYI"

522961,Guest,2002-07-30 07:35:00,0,Not this summer but last fall and a few other times over the years. They are nice folks who run a great operation. That area of Lac Seul is remote and the fishing is good to great. It is noted for Muskies as well as nice northern and walleye. There have been some world class Muskies caught in that area. Look in the archives for numerous posts on this resort and fishing in that area.Paul
