523234,Ohio fisherman,2002-08-02 09:50:00,989,"Hi Guys: I really appreciate the combined experience of the participants here on walleye central. I have posted requests for information and have received some great leads on fishing destinations for my wife and me to take our own boat. Thanks to all who have provided information. Lac Seul certainly sounds like a dream destination, however, the drive is just too long from Ohio for my wife due to her health problems. It is far better for us to drive and take our own boat rather than fly-in because of my wife's health issues. We have narrowed down the region that would be a more tolerable drive. We are thinking that for us, it might be better to drive farther north rather than east or west. So, how is the fishing in the region of Ontario between Lake Nipigon to the Quebec border? I know there are some good fly-in lakes in that region, but how about drive-in lakes? (One guy emailed info about an interesting camp in that region.) We would prefer to cross at Sault Ste. Marie rather than Buffalo.Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, and great fishing! Ohio fisherman"
