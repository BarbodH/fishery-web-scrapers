522926,Toolman,2002-07-26 05:06:00,2570,"Doc,I found a Wawa visitors guide in my van yesterday. It has several hotels, lodges, resorts, etc. listed in it. If you want I can get it and post some Ph #'s. Maybe some local guys can fill you in on what the rooms are like. Good luck.Tim"

522930,Ohio fisherman,2002-07-27 14:04:00,989,The Bristol is fine. It is old and the price is right. My brother in law has been staying there every trip to Canada for 25 years. He is there right now. AVOID THE KINAWABE PINES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
522931,Toolman,2002-08-02 10:22:00,2570,"Doc, Sorry, I haven't checked in here for awhile. I could copy and fax a few sheets of that visitors guide if you like (and have a fax). I couldn't get your addy to link. Let me know.Tim"
