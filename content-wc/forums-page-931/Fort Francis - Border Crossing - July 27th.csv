523204,Stillwater,2002-08-01 12:48:00,87,"Hello,A story, just a kind of an FYI, for those people crossing in the future.We had 7 people in our party (3 cars trailing boats) on Sat. morning. All 4 lanes of the Canadian Customs were open and the wait was only 2 minutes (good news). Each car in our party took a different lane. My partner and I declared 2 cases of beer and 1 quart of liquor. We were given a slip which I assumed (from past experience) was to pay duty on our extra alchohol. We were told to pull over under the awning and someone would come check us out, which they did. The Customs man checks us out and then says take your slip inside and someone will give you a number. We went inside and then he comes inside and gives us a number, Number 20.Inside there are about 30 people standing/sitting around, small room, many people milling about. We are all in a room that has 10 chairs in it, plus 1 table that you can stand up at. After 15 or 20 minutes a woman comes out and calls out ""Number 14"", I figured we would be out in no time, but no one seems to be helping us. It turns out that number 14 takes about 20 minutes, then number 15, 16, 17 and 18 take about 5 to 10 minutes each. Then number 19 takes about 10 minutes. We are next in line. I had been talking to other people in the room and comparing tickets and our ticket read ""Immigration, ID check"" and so did most other people. It also read the time we went through Customs (10:55 A.M.)Then the woman comes out and announces that she is taking her lunch break now and everyone has to stay in the room until she gets back, you can't go to the bathroom or step outside for a smoke unless you get permission from someone behind the counter. It's now 12:05, an Hour and 10 minutes from when we got there.Everyone groans, but a few start talking and joking and some even pull out a deck of cards and start playing at the stand-up table, after 10 minutes a customs man comes over and slams his palm down on the counter and announces ""Listen up people, this is an office, keep the noise down""!At that point I did a head count of 29 people in the room, there were only 10 chairs. Both the bathrooms and smoking areas were outside and you had to get permission to use them.At 12:40 the woman (Immigration) comes back from lunch, calls our number, asks for our ID, (drivers license), goes to her computer and comes back up to the counter and says ""Thank You guys, your clear to go"". Took 3 to 4 minutes, after waiting 1 hour and 45 minutes. We never were asked to pay duty on the extra beer. I told this story to the resort owner and I think this kind of info should be passed along. We had passports, birth certificates and other paper that we had gone out of our way (spent both time and money)to collect in order to expedite our crossing. This is our 16th year to Canada. Just an FYI, Take it for what it's worth Scott"
523205,Larry,2002-08-01 15:05:00,357,"kinda like our airport security folks strip searching 80 year old women. bureaucrats will be bureaucrats, be they american or canadian. probably some sort of politically correct quota system."
523206,Guest,2002-08-02 06:55:00,0,"If I were you,next year buy your beer in Canada at the Beer Store and save alot of trouble. I never could understand people comlicating the boarder crossing with something like taking extra beer, smokes, gasoline, etc."
523207,phishfearme,2002-08-02 09:14:00,1242,"jimmy - although i agree with your suggestion - it doesn't always work!! we usually have nothing to declare and buy our beer in canada but when you tell the agent that your goin' fishing, a red flag goes up and you sometimes get searched - this seems to be more common in sault saint marie than intl falls. one time, the agent took everthing out of the car and opening them up. once everthing was spread out on the ground the agent said it was ok for us - not him - to reload. cost us an hour for nothing. phish"
523208,Stillwater,2002-08-02 10:21:00,87,"Jimmy,It wasn't the beer. After we pulled over, Customs inspected the boat and car and cleared us immediately. It was a random ""Immigration, ID Check"". It said so right on our ticket.My point was that we were all in the place for ""Immigration, ID check"" and there was only 1 Immigration official on duty, hence, the long wait. I do agree with you about buying locally, however, beer at the Beer Store is $42 Canadian ($28 US). I paid $12.49 for the case of beer at my local store and duty normally works out to about $7.00, it's a better deal to buy it in the US and pay duty, and it saves 1 stop.Scott"
523209,Guest,2002-08-02 10:29:00,0,Should i assume there were no prior dwi/dui in your group? If there was were they 10 yrs or older?
523210,Stillwater,2002-08-03 07:30:00,87,"The DWI/DUI issue didn't come up. The driver of the truck has never had anything more than a speeding ticket. The passenger (me) has a 28 year old DWI. However, through reading the info on this board, I knew that I was now considered ""Rehabilitated"" by the Canadian government. Anyway, It was the wait, (1 hour 45 minutes) that I thought was unreasonable. Would you be willing to go to your local Target/K-Mart/WalMart and stand in line for 1 hour and 45 Mins. to pick up, at the counter, a pack of Juicy Fruit gum that you had already paid for? It just seemed to me that if Canadian Immigration is going to pull over a LOT of people for random ""ID Checks"" that they should staff for it. Scott"
523211,SWeed,2002-08-03 11:23:00,66,"The US/Canadian border is one of the easiest to get through. Next time plan on a three hour wait at the border. Then if you get right through or only takes an hour it will be like a bonus. You are going into a foriegn country and the Crown has its rules just like the ol USA. If you wish not to go through the possible time delay, drive to Lake Erie, which for me is worse than The border because I have to go through Chicago on I-80. Sometimes I go right thru at 40 mph and sometimes sit in traffic for three hours. I have never seen a post on this board about that. So let me know is anyone else upset about the traffic delays going through Chicago on your way to a fishing trip??? By the way I have been to Canada at least 20 times and extremly lucky to never having been pulled over for a check. I am way over do. Just my two cents worth...."
