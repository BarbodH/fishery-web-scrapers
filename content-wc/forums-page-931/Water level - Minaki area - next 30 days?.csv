523097,Swede811,2002-07-29 16:52:00,32,What will typically happen with respect to water levels in the next 30 days in tme Minaki area? Will they open the dam in an effort to drop it as much as possible before freeze-up? What is the typical effect this has on fishing the system?jiggs
523098,Guest,2002-07-30 05:52:00,0,I've seen the water level drop about six inches a day after veryhigh water periods like they have had this year. I'm sure the dams will remain open in an effort to lower the level before freeze up. Ever fished a lake with water dropping that quick? It can make fishing really tough. Good luck.

We've been up around Labor Day quite a few times - fishing seems to follow the weather patterns as usual - some days better than others, but none of our trips were a total flop. Looking forward to going this Labor Day also."

They will be starting to slowly close the dam at the outlet of Lake of the Woods within the next week or two..
