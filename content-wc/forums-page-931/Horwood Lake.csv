Was going to stay at Horwood Lodge 15 years ago,but because of bad rains and flooded conditions couldn't get to Lodge.If you have to take a bush trail to the camp(could have changed)be prepared to really screw up your vehicle. The trail is one car wide and I had to keep my truck in 4wd the whole length of the trail.Got to the bridge that takes you to the camp and it was washed out. Take lots of fuel for your outboard as the nearest gas station is 40 miles from camp in Foleyet.The lodge offers fuel,but at about $8.00 a gal. One more thing,had to put logs in between the CNR tracks to get truck and boat over them.Like I said,this was a few years back and I heard they have changed owners.Anyhow, managed to find another place to stay on the lake and had a wonderful trip.Lots of walleye(not real Big) and alot of Northerns.Early morning,black and silver hot-n-tots trolled along the shores should be the ticket,it was then.Casting red eyes(blue/silver) for the pike.Have a good trip and let me know if the place has changed."
523165,Guest,2002-08-01 15:41:00,0,Horwood Lake Lodge is a first-class establishment with good management. The lake is standard fair for NE Ontario - Northerns and Walleyes. Its a decent size walleyes (2 and 3 lbs. avg) and has good populations of both - check the mouth of the Woman River and weedbeds during the daylight hours. Ask about daytrips to smaller lakes in the area.Good Luck.

If a breeze comes up, there are a a couple of points on the south side of Hardiman Bay about a mile from the lodge that will hold a lot of walleye ( 20-30 ft.) Minnow tipped jigs are always my first choice. Good luck."
