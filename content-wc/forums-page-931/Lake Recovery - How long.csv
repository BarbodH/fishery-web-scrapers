523167,Guest,2002-07-31 16:20:00,0,This is more of a Fishery Biologist question but what the heck. I'll see what you all think. Back in the 70s I used to fish a lake not far from Red lake with fanastic results. Then like a light switch something happened. We attribute the problem to a portage improvement that hurt the reproductive cycle of the Walleye pop. Of course it could have been weather related / fishing pressure (doubt it) whatever. From that point on the lake struggled. Then in the mid 80s we started catching literally 100s of 8-14 inch walleyes. Nothing over 22 inches but the young fish were everywhere. This turned us off for about 15 years we moved to another lake. Now we come back over the last few years the general size and volumn of fish has returned to early 70s with one exception.No fish over 26 inches. Now I know 26+ inch walleyes are unusual. But with the guality of fishermen we bring in and the number of hours / varing spots we should have seen at least one over the last 4 years. We do tend to catch most of the fish shallow in this lake (8-12 feet deep) Maybe we should look in 15-20????Could we still be seeing the results of the late 70s and early 80s problem. Could there be an unusual lack of fish in that slot range due to problems 20-25 years ago.BTW...We have never kept a single fish over 18 inches. I know all of the beautiful 24&25 inchers are still in there.Any comments?Thanks!Bob

Lakes that produce only up to a certain size sometimes are victims of"" selective harvest"". According to stories I have been told, several illegal, or legal approaches are used. One is to fly into a small lake at dusk, run gill nets, and leave at dawn. Another is the use of gill nets throught the ice during winter. My guess is the the lake in question was ""selectively harvested""."

Some of this forgage is like eating at Mac's, no bang for the bite. I would bet that forgage makeup will not produce the big ones."
