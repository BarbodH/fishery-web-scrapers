522920,BobG-IL,2002-07-25 20:42:00,7,"Take a look at Tomahawk Resort at Sioux Narrows, about 90 miles north of Int'l Falls.http://www.tomahawkresort.com/Excellent staff, cottages and facilities, e.g., two bathrooms, dishwasher, gas grill, ceiling fans in the 3-bedroom cottages.We went up in August, 2000 and found plenty of eyes on the humps at 26'-32'; smallies were numerous along the shorelines; accidentally tied into a few northern in the 34""-38"" range. It's still a little warm for consistent big northern catching in August on Lake of the Woods.We were there earlier this year and are going back in August-our 4th year in a row.Regards,Bob"
