It has been one of those above average years for walleyes and northerns. Smallies have been good as well. The muskies, the big ones, are just starting to get going. Walleyes are in their summer homes and very active. Could be a shortage of forage which usually will produce a very good bite. When the eyes have a lot to eat, they don't bite as well."
522304,Larry,2002-07-22 11:56:00,357,"well, we're back and had a great time. son and i probably caught about 300 fish. 80% walleyes. no monsters. lots of very nice fish in the 18 to 26 inch range. i have had 2 terrible trips up north. one was to the chippewa flowage near hayward wisconsin and one to a fished out lake in eastern ontario near foleyet. i have to say that i was quite skeptical about this board and the posters, thinking that perhaps some had a vested interest in pumping lac seul. i was wrong. that lake is for real. we are relative walleye novices and did very well. probably will fish a little further down the lake if we go again next year. thanks for all of your help. lac seul rules. wouldn't even consider anyplace else. an additional bonus was that the locals were very polite and kind. that was not what i had found in eastern ontatio, if you get my drift. larry"
522305,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-22 12:04:00,6,Havent been there for two weeks but it is the hottest it has ever been. Have fished LS for 37 years and this year we made two trips and they were both great. Wish I had time to go once more this year.
522306,Tom,2002-07-22 15:29:00,1063,"Fishing the Chippeawa Flowage is a big cry from fishing Canada. It's like stepping into a different world. A really good day is a limit in the boat. Lac Seul beats it by a mile. I made 27 trips there and covered from South to North, and East to West. It was great fishing from one end to the other."
522307,Guest,2002-07-23 11:00:00,0,"I just got back from Vaughan Lake which is a part of Lac Seul. Here is what we caught. Close to 450 walleye between the four of us. The weather was hot, sunny and humid with lots of bugs. The fishing was good ( last year it was great ) the largest walleye we caught was 27 inches with about 150 slotters. We used minows, crawlers and leeches. Minnows and crawlers worked the best. We found fish in 5-15 feet of water. When they were active we caught them in 5-7 feet of water and deeper when they were not. We caught about half vertically jigging and the other slow trolling with jigs. My son for a science experiment wanted to see if any one of the following colored jigs was superior to the others. The five colors were Green, Orange Yellow, Orange, A tri Color combination, and Chartures. My Father who is a mathmatican looked ( we did this test on the first 350 walleye we caught ) at the final total and said it looked like Green was statictally better than the other colors. Just some food for thought.If you are coming up 502 it is in pretty good shape, but the traffic was brutal."
522308,Guest,2002-07-23 12:42:00,0,"To bad you didn't run bottom bouncers with spinners and check blade sizes and colors, that experiment could have kept you there another two weeks. And a lot has to do with the forage preference of the moment, so don't live by it. Fish are not statistical, they are instinctive."
522309,Guest,2002-07-25 16:59:00,0,"Here's a report just posted on Just Fish Ontario site. I think it's from evergreen lodge on Lac Seul.Typing is not one of my better traits and it was like writting 'War and Peace' for me. Anyway I'll try to refresh my sleepy memory and get a few things out to you. Fishing is HOT and the weather has given us a break but no real rain as yet. We had a fast moving cold front hit us Monday that created a real chalenge. The sport I was with that day had serious back problems and we fished the Wenasaga River to stay out of a mean chop. We fished the current edges where the river bends and found plenty of fish fry fish and a couple nice picture fish for each of us.The open lake basin close to camp and the Steamboat Bay area is really working well for us and McKenzie Bay is fun as usual. Yesterday we were down the lake to experiment with deeper water techniques. We fished open water sunken islands and deep rock bars next to islands. The day was spectacular with yours truely boating a pair of real heavy 28"" fish and two of the sports finding thier personal best in the 27"" class. We long lined an anchor and played the rope in and out to move up and down the shelves on the hump as we pitched chartruese, blaze orange and fire tiger jigs tipped with minnows, first sitting shallow and pitching deeper then reversing the tactic as the heat of the day wore on; Great Fun! We later backtrolled a larger hump as we ate our sandwiches and laughed ourselves silly as we scrambled for nets and such with doubles and triples with lunch in one hand.The guys were laughing about throwing back untold numbers of ""little"" 20-22 walleye. Later in the day we backtrolled metalic; gold and silver were best, spinners along a rock bar that ajoined and island and broke into 80' of water. The fish were bitting in 9-14' of water as they came into the windward side of the island to feed. This is the part of summer that I enjoy fishing as the fish are responding to small changes in thier surroundings, and new techniques can be played with. Always fun to learn new tricks. The days are long for Patty and I and I'm sorry for the delays in getting info to you. We really crash late most nights and there is plenty to do with finnishing the house and shop before we tackle more projects this fall. Hope this finds all well with you and good fishing and check our fishing reports on http://www.justfishontario.com"
522310,Guest,2002-07-31 16:52:00,0,"Best fishing in northwestern Ontario for walleyes in my lifetime, of course I am only six, just kidding, but a ##### of a year for both size and numbers. Why do you all think so good?"
522311,Guest,2002-08-01 13:16:00,0,"Here's report from Lac SeulWith friends in camp it has been a very busy time, so this report will get right to the point. The entire game has been walleyes, both volume and size has been excellent. We had 67 walleyes over 27 inches, 8 over 29 inches, and 1 over 30 inches. These numbers are still exceptional but I have to admit they are becoming routine. The really big fish have moved deep. Both main lake sunken islands and mega sand structure reefs are producing numbers and size. Most Master Angler fish were found in water 22' deep and deeper. Bottom bouncers and crawlers were responsible for most of the big ones, but a few were caught with big jigs and minnows, too. There were a few times when the wind or weather were responsible for a shallow bite. If it gets hot and calm, there will be some medium sized walleyes back in the shallows and weeds. Pike and smallies----just not happening, plus folks want to chase big walleyes. Til next week.This report is from south central Lac Seul and is just another average report for this camp."
522293,Larry,2002-07-08 20:22:00,357,Headed to Ear Falls area Friday. Anyone just getting back who can update the fishing conditions? Where are they? What depth? What kind of luck did you have? Bait? Lures? Thanks in advance.
522294,zugbug,2002-07-08 21:18:00,67,"Larry, I returned from Lac Seul on saturday the 6th of July after 6 days of fishing out of Mahkwa lodge near the middle section of The Lake, Fish was fast and furious as usual with a lot of fish in the 8-10 foot range, bigger fish off the first drop, wind was up and made holding you position a bit difficult on the drops and boulder spots on spots. Trolling Anything Chartruse was a key with the #7 and #8 SFC Shad Raps a good bait. Two of the Hottest Baits were The #7 Hot sucker(?)Tail Dancer (chartruse belly) and The #7 Jointed Shadrap hot Craw(?) again with a chartruse belly. The Taildancer was the real deal for us. The Roads were as usual no worse maybe a bit better but not much. The border was non-evetful and the lake level is high but not flood level. We had problems finding real big fish but the Quantity was amazing, Very little rain but some brisk winds and steamy heat.Hope this helps,Back to work for me :(Zugbug"
522295,Jigger1,2002-07-09 08:17:00,234,"Larry,I echo Zugbug's comments. Our group just returned from Silver Water Wheel Lodge and we experienced hot and heavy fishing as well for 4.5 days. As a group we caught and released over 400 walleyes over the slot, 109 of the walleyes were over 25 and broke out as following.30.5 was the big dog4  29 walleyes13  28 walleyes15  27 walleyes27  26 walleyes49  25 walleyesAlmost ever fish was caught in less than 15' of water with the majority caught on bottom bouncers. The remaining fish were caught on either 3/8 or 1/2 ounce jigs pitching them into the shallows. We didn't use any cranks to speak of. Only 50 weeks until our next trip!"

522297,Guest,2002-07-09 23:51:00,0,correct site address should read http://www.justfishontario.com for above post.
522298,whitetip1,2002-07-10 07:36:00,53,"Larry,I fished the same area as zugbug, and our group did well on trolled crankbaits also. We only trolled one evening and caught alot of fish (2 guys - 50 in 2.5 hrs) but the bigger fish we caught were on spinner rigs with bottom bouncers and Berkley Power Worms. We never used live bait the whole time I was there. White jig and twister tails also produced some very nice numbers and size. We fished in 8-15' off of wind swept points. Fishing Lac Seul is a great experience and catching fish is not very difficult.Have Fun,Dave"
522299,Guest,2002-07-10 07:57:00,0,"Just returned from another successful trip on the 6th! Fishing out of Ear Falls is just OK by Lac Seul standards, Wenesaga and Sawmill produce decent numbers of smaller fish. For larger fish and better numbers, you need to head down the lake about 15-20 miles. The River below the dam in Ear Falls is also producing good numbers & size of fish. Good Luck and enjoy. FYI - only refering to Walleyes, the slimmers are everywhere."
522300,Larry,2002-07-10 10:35:00,357,thanks much fellers. i'll let you know how things turn out when i get back. larry
522301,Guest,2002-07-11 08:10:00,0,"I saw this report on http://www.justfishontario.com and thought it would give you a good idea on what's going on. We bragged last week about the June stats at the risk of boring the non number guys to tears. This week, the weather has been hot and so was the walleye bite!! Walleye locations finally matched the calendar, and we found fish where we would expect them to be this time of year. Sand flats and weeds were the key to locating walleyes, these areas produced big fish and lots of them. The guide staff is made up of hard core fisherman, but they respect the fact that many of our guests are not. This week we were fortunate to again host Denis and Sue Simonette, truly hard core fishing couple who have consistently successful at chasing and catching big walleye on Lac Seul. This week Denis caught the biggest walleye to date for the season at 31.75"". Not to be outdone, Sue caught walleyes at 31,30,29, and 28.75 inches. Truly outstanding for just three days on the water.Our guide numbers for the week continued on a strong pace and I say that our guides and our guests are getting pretty well spoiled. We boated 12 walleyes over 29 inches, 29 walleyes over 28 inches, and 78 over 27 inches.With the big northerns still being in transition, our guides focused on the great walleye bite. The big northern was a solid 41 inches, with 10 others in the upper 30 inch range. However, as I said we did not give much attention northerns cause of the walleye bite. The smallmouth bass bite was good and possibly a little better than average with 10 fish over 18"", and 11 more at 17"". I think the bass bite will continue to hold for awhile. We have just seen the first wave or two of big fish moving to deeper water. There were plenty of big fish still caught in the weeds, but most were caught in 12 to 18' of water. The biggest fish are starting to pack by size and moving deeper and this is a very sure sign that summer has arrived."
522302,Guest,2002-07-11 15:52:00,0,Evergreen Lodge gives a good report as well and Gary gets on the water almost everday so he knows what is happening. His report is on http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm The fish seem to be in their summer patterns and moving deeper. They are grouping up.
