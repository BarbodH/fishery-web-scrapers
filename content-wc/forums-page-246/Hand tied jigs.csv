4457345,bigcreekdad,2016-01-16 13:57:00,74,"I tie several dozen bucktail jigs every Spring for my trips to Ontario. I tie mainly black, but sometimes add a bit of red bucktail as well. Been using this pattern in Ontario for almost 50 years. Works awesome in early season til late June. I find it not nearly effective after that. Tie some up...you'll not be disappointed."
4458057,adempsey,2016-01-16 18:40:00,963,"I have a handful of jigs I tied for Walleye, Pike and Lake Trout. Nothing special, just some white/black bucktail with a white bunny strip. Haven't really used them too much yet though. The bunny strip adds some nice action though.They look somewhat like the image I attached, but different standard jigs of various size."
4452105,Knoxabilly,2016-01-14 10:28:00,225,"For Christmas I got a vice and gear to tie jigs, seems to help with the winter blues. Anyway, I've been making crappie jigs and was curious if any of you tie walleye jigs. What material/colors/size do you use or what produces for you. Surprisingly I have not really tried buck tails jigs for eyes in Canada so I wanted to hear from you guys!"
4452305,BornToFish,2016-01-14 12:05:00,1224,"Greetings, I've been tying bucktails and jigs for about fifteen years. I too started with some basic equipment and materials. I have been coming up with new ideas every year since, in terms of combinations of materials and designs. If you haven't already, I suggest visiting a local fly shop (if one is nearby) to casually browse their selection of materials and tools. They might give you a demonstration of some basic techniques or have tying classes. For example, you might want to get an applicator for head cement and a tool for making a whip finish. I have used some hair jigs over the years. One trend that I have found, is that I had my best success with hair jigs when the water warms up. I have had my best success fishing hair jigs in stained water. It seems that the hair jig imitates an escaping minnow. The fish need the water warm enough to want to chase. The added bulk of the hair jig helps the fish track it down in stained water. I typically spice up the hair jig with some live bait, such as a piece of crawler or a small minnow/leech. I mostly tie with various colors of bucktail. Lately, I've been mixing in some flashabou to reflect light. You can also put marabou on your jigs. Almost all of my hair jigs are tied with jigs featuring what I call a ball style collar. The ball, at the end of the collar closest to the hook, keeps the thread and hair from falling off the collar. I contrast the ball style collar to the barb style collar, where the barb secures rubber twister tails. I use plenty of head cement when I tie my hair jigs. I put down a layer of thread on the collar, then return the thread towards the ball end of the collar. I start putting on layers of hair, then add flashabou and finish with another layer of hair. I put down plenty of head cement between each step. Good luck in tying your jigs. You will find it to be rewarding to catch some nice fish on tackle that you made. Once you are comfortable tying jigs, you will be able to expand into walleye flies and bucktails for northern pike and muskies. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4452425,DeBo,2016-01-14 13:06:00,211,I usually tie up some jigs with marabou every year. They catch everything that swims in shallow water. I like white and black. I buy the marabou and some hackle to mix in. Just have fun with it and see what you like. You can use whatever jigs you have laying around. I personally prefer marabou over buck tail by a very large margin. I feel it has more life/movement in the water. Flashabou jigs can be great too or mixing flash in with bou or bucktail. It's always cool catching fish on your own creations! I had to go to Argentina for work a few years ago and worked a fishing trip in to the middle of that 1.5 month adventure. Grabbed some of my big saltwater heads that I use for swimbaits around here and tied them up with marabou. Ended up catching a good number of Golden Dorados up to 20lbs or so!

4452585,MN_Moose,2016-01-14 14:52:00,964,You might want to visit Basement Baits of Musky First. They of course concentrate on Musky bait building but the techniques translate to smaller walleye and crappie jigshttp://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/boar...iew.asp?fid=25
4453089,Tx Jig tyr,2016-01-14 18:36:00,140,"Knox, I too have been tying jigs for awhile to answer some of your questions Materials. For paint I prefer the powder paint. be sure to bake in the oven per the directions for better durability Materials #2 I prefer hair Colors, for walleyes and Northern, I use an orange head, with a mix of orange and brown buck tail, or just orange, tied with black thread. Just have fun, and try different combinations. As the earlier poster said, it is a kick to catch fish on your own creation. Tx. Jig Tyr"
4453201,yoopertrout,2016-01-14 19:34:00,1172,"I'm a fly tyer, and, a couple years ago I tied some walleye jigs using rabbit strips and crystal flash. I used them on a catch and release, artificials only lake. I caught fish, but not as many as on twister tails. Of course, that was just my experience on one lake with one style of jig. I love tying. Here's a few things I've learned over the years that might help you out: 1. Cheap clear nail polish (Sally Hansen Hard as Nails is usually the cheapest) works just as well as head cement, and is cheaper. 2. Anything that you can find in a craft store will be cheaper than in a fly shop - bead boxes, feathers, whatever. 3. The Hook and Hackle Company and Feathercraft are two good sources for materials. 4. At Christmas time, you can find tinsel in the big box stores that is waaay cheaper than in fly shops. Have fun!"
4453241,55walleyes,2016-01-14 20:15:00,131,My dad used to tie buck tail jigs. Caught lots of walleyes on 3/8 once jigs. Black was always best. Yellow and red had their good days as well.
4454537,Bill Krejca,2016-01-15 12:48:00,6107,"I've tied lures since 1946. Black and white feather jigs seem to work well for me for walleyes. You can do a jig tying search here on Walleye Central for a bunch of info on tying. Also, go to You Tube for many excellent videos. Bill"
4455297,Knoxabilly,2016-01-15 17:12:00,225,Thanks for all the info fellas- I think I will tie some up and try them this year!
