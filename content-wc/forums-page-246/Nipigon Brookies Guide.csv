He has film of Babe Winkleman and him Brook trout fishing and it has some pretty awesome footage of Brookies being caught in both size and numbers. He has a guide that works for him named Gus Bueda that has been guiding since he was a teenager. In my opinion, he is the best outdoors man I have ever met. I would give Pasha a call."
