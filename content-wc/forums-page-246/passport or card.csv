4412801,jfaisten,2015-12-31 05:00:00,1060,10 years is too long a time frame not to have the flexibility of the passport. Lots can change in that time frame -
4412865,Nimstug,2015-12-31 05:55:00,2605,Went with the book for the flexibility.
4412889,Mark Komo,2015-12-31 06:19:00,867,"I did the book, card and nexus. I had to fly to canada quite a bit for work, and that retina scan is the way to go. Super fast in vancouver especially. When I lived in buffalo, the card was handy when going over the border with colleagues via the car. Passport came in handy when I went to the caribbean.One thing to keep in mind is the passport card, when saved (hidden) in your luggage can absolutely save your bacon. If you are in another city, lose your wallet, that will work for id if you can have jump on a flight home."
4413473,mt hook,2015-12-31 09:56:00,65,I think Ill go with the card. Don't see me flying anytime soon.Thanks for your insight gentleman.
4452553,reidcb,2016-01-14 14:12:00,24,I went with the passport and was glad that I did. We decided to go to Dominican Republic on one of the all inclusive bargain packages. We had a great time and I had the passport already.
4452969,billy weaver,2016-01-14 17:30:00,470,I assume it is driver license size and can be carried in your billfold. That would be handy as I wouldn't have to look and panic every time I approach the border. (never prepared)
4411545,mt hook,2015-12-30 12:38:00,65,"Time to renew my passport. Im thinking why a passport just get a card.A card is alot less money and I know I will not be flying to canada,so why not just get the passport card.Any thoughts/comments??"
4411641,LOW1,2015-12-30 13:00:00,2828,"I'd go with the passport because (1) over the ten year life the cost per year is not much different (2) over the ten year life you may want to go somewhere where the card does not work and (3) maybe at some point you will want to fly to Canada or have to get air-ambulanced from Canada (4) with the fall in value of the Canadian Loonie, take some of the money you will save on your Canadian trip and invest it in a full passport"
4411761,mt hook,2015-12-30 13:43:00,65,"LOW1A passport is $140 a card is $30 That 110 to my next trip. it's good for 10yr.The air-ambulanced is a thought, hope it doesn't come to that. As im no spring chicken any more. The only plane I will get in, is a bush plane thats alreadyin canada.I like the way you think though. Thats why I asked"
4411777,JAY221,2015-12-30 13:45:00,877,"I just got the card because I won't be going anywhere the card won't let me go. Fact is I won't be going some places the card will let me go. Later, Jay"
4411793,LOW1,2015-12-30 13:49:00,2828,I think passport renewal is $110? And card is $30 only if you have an existing passport?
4411849,mt hook,2015-12-30 14:07:00,65,I think passport renewal is $110? And card is $30 only if you have an existing passport? You are correct. I missquoted
4412009,Lovetofish,2015-12-30 15:14:00,458,I bought the card figuring I would never need the book. If something came up where I'd need the book I'd get one but I don't see that happening. Just my own thoughts.
4412057,Bstar,2015-12-30 15:29:00,564,Ditto on the passport. Maybe your wife will surprise you with a trip to Cabo for some marlin fishing. You never know!
4412209,mt hook,2015-12-30 16:50:00,65,"Wife read the post. GRIN She said ill buy, start swiming ill send you a check when you get there.The only way you can get her on a plane is if she is unconscious!"
4412697,egladding,2015-12-30 23:14:00,1527,The passport card is good for land border and sea travel. If you will not be flying into or out of the US then there is no need for it.
