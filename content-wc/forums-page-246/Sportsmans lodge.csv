4347097,ftfarms,2015-11-29 06:00:00,444,Got some friends heading to sportsman lodge on eagle lake the last week of june. Thay are trying to get a couple more and want me to go. I probly could go another week just don't know anything about this place. I've fished eagle several years ago on the west side water was real clear and not a fan of that. We didn't do the best but the weather the week we was there was 78 the first day to snow on the third and rain most of the week. Not a very good test of the lake. Thanks for any imput.

I don't know if the same owners are there or not. First night there for me was rough. The train tracks run right past the place . The rest of the nights I never heard a thing, slept like a baby. This might not be much help but I certainly would return there."

4471898,prov1800,2016-01-20 20:33:00,5010,"All of eagle is excellent.clear water on the west end doesnt make any difference for fishing for walleye.walleye fishing is excellent.might be a little tougher muskie fishing because of the clear water at boat side buf well worth with some brutes in that end.sportsmans lodge is a nice camp, very calm bay to dock boats in and the owners will take great care of you.eagle is big and hard for rookies to do well on there own.big lakes always take time to learn, thats usually why you hear the hard fishing.just ask the guys that guide on her.if you need aguide for a day just get jim to get a hold of me.

Did net a nice Laker in about 40' and a couple of nice smallies but in my opinion if your looking for numbers of walleye, stick to the east end and for less numbers but bigger fish the west end is nice."
4473906,prov1800,2016-01-21 11:55:00,5010,I understand where your coming from.i am a guide on Eagle Lake.i guide privatly with my own boat as well as camps from the west arm to the east end so i am very familiar with the fishing on the whole length of the lake on a daily basis.it really doesnt matter to me which part i fish.i find the fishing pretty much the same all over especially toward fall.i think the post was asking about june fishing and again it is good in each section of the lake as well.Although must admit that there are certain areas in the mid part of the lake and past osborne bay that i would target even having to take a bit of a boat ride.But getting back to sportsmans bay area that whole area is loaded with walleyes.Definatly dont have to go far from the lodge.Also would be looking for shallower water at that time of the year.Also sportsmans lodge is not far from good fishing in either direction.Ten minutes would get you to some fantastic spots.Also many bonus lake trout while walleye fishing depending on water temperature.Far as iam concerened there isnt a bad spot on the lake in 65 miles.lol.

4474722,That Minnesota guy,2016-01-21 17:36:00,8293,For some reason I thought it was Karen & Jim? But Cindy & Jim works. I think they were the owners when I was there.
