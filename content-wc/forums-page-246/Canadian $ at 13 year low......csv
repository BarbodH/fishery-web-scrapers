4458777,Obabikon,2016-01-16 23:11:00,2370,"Not sure what ""par"" has to do with anything. The exchange rate being around par... is similar to the exchange rate being around 1.45. It is approaching extreme levels... and is nowhere near the average. The AVERAGE is where it should be for everyone to be equal."
4459057,Shellback,2016-01-17 06:33:00,8083,"You have completely lost me on that statement. The CN dollar and the US dollar being around par is similar to a rate of $1.45? Gord posted the exchange rates of the past 25 years. You mentioned 6 years that you lost money. of those 6 years, one was par and another was $1.01 favoring the CN dollar. The other 4 years favored the US dollar. You keep trying to convince yourself that you are losing due to using the US dollar for payment. One only has to look at the exchange rates to know differently. You are operating a business in Canada and dealing in US funds. If average is where everyone is equal, how about Canada giving us some of those great fisheries they have? LOL!"
4459153,Obabikon,2016-01-17 07:06:00,2370,"Shellback, Par has nothing to do with it. What it has to do with is where the exchange rate was when prices for a camp are set. Par is not the magical spot of breaking even. There's not a business out there that made plans believing the Canadian dollar would be even with the US dollar. My point was... in the past 25 years, the exchange rate has been at par, about the same number of times as it has been 1.40. Those are both extreme exchanges. If you look at it on a graph... Par is about as low as it ever goes and 1.40 is about as high as its ever gets."
4459201,Obabikon,2016-01-17 07:23:00,2370,"The exchange rate with Japan is 1 USD to 117 Yen.That doesn't mean that things are 11700% cheaper in Japan. The currency of countries around the world are not based on Par with the USD, and neither is Canada's. You take averages over history and that average is the normal position. Mexican Peso is 18.27Euro is 1.09Pound is 1.43Australia is .69None of it is based on being even with the USD. It is simply what the global market currently values each currency."
4459601,v-bay gord,2016-01-17 08:38:00,3168,"I think Obabikon's point is that where you set your break even point on that range is the crux of the matter. .....perhaps midrange between par and 1.4. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It is a business decision that involves many things, as well as a willingness to speculate on the exchange rate. I prefer dealing in Canadian $, where a dollar just needs to be a dollar. As far as my American guests not knowing exactly what it will cost them.....23 out of 25 times it cost them less than what was quoted on my rate sheet. Bottom line is if you feel you are getting value for your money then what currency is involved is a mute point. Note: If I was paying off my mortgage in U.S. $, or lived in the U.S., then I would probably be wise to charge in that currency...."

That would be about the equivalent of 19 cents a gallon when I started selling bulk fuel in 1970.Maybe they are pricing it in Loonies converted to dollars? Just kidding....The strong dollar is killing any of us that depend somewhat on exports. Seems it would be a good thing for all if the Canadian and USA dollar were tied together somehow.We just got back from the Bahama's last night and they tie there currency to the USA dollar somehow. Or, at least that's how they take money and give back change. Sometimes your change is a mix of dollars and the Bahamian currency.Must be China's fault......Pooch"

4460025,v-bay gord,2016-01-17 10:38:00,3168,True! Interesting note that since about 2009 the Canadian dollar to Peso exchange has been around the 12 peso per dollar range. Even with the U.S. $ increase the Canadian $ still seems to be holding it's value in Mexico. One issue is that many destinations price in U.S. $......so I guess I will be looking for deals in Peso's (or Canadian $).
4456121,Skywagon,2016-01-16 06:00:00,1106,"I am not a camp owner (just a casual observer), but am a person who does business in both countries and pays income tax in Canada (as well as the US). I can assure you Revenue Canada does have a conversion rate for US to Canadian funds, this exchange rate is set each year with the value of the loonie. As far as camps charging Canadian or US, I think it is pretty easy to see both sides of that. It makes it simpler for Americans to pay in US currency, they do not have to be confused by conversion rates. On the other hand, a camp owner charging Canadian funds knows where he is going to be at the end of the year, he would not have as much concern of the dollar swings if he is receiving/paying out in Canadian funds, though the value of the dollar still has consequence's. I cannot imagine why you think camp owners are ""grinding the customer for every $ they can"", I just don't see that. Camp owners are business people, they have a significant investment, it appears to me that they put in a lot of work making a go of their camp, for what I would guess to be not that much of a return on investment. It always kills me when I hear people complain about prices of anything, it seems they fear that a business might be making too much money. I don't know of anyone that feels that they as an individual are making too much money!"
4456409,Guest,2016-01-16 07:48:00,0,Last year I bought my license on line from US because the resorts computer was out and got a discount on my License because of exchange rate. This year it would be about a $20 bill back in my pocket plus outdoor card savings due this year. Am I right or wrong on this?
4456497,Shellback,2016-01-16 08:10:00,8083,"As of yesterday, you should be paying somewhere in the neighborhood of $.69 US to the CN $. For instance my 2016 Ontario conservation license is $51.65 US. Yesterday the exchange rate was .687711. So I should have paid about $35.64 for my license. Some CC companies charge extra fees, and some don't. My company just uses the exchange rate. PS This exchange rate would reflect on all US $ spent in Canada on your CC. Transferring cash at a bank or paying with US $ at a Canadian business, would incur fees reducing the % difference."

4456865,Fisherman Ted,2016-01-16 10:51:00,461,"Here is an eye-opening figure. Every penny the Loonie drops versus the USD will cause a 1% INCREASE in imported food costs (meaning essentially ALL fruits and vegetables). Food prices are already crazy and been sky-rocketing for years. This summer (if it drops another 20 points) could be the largest increase ever in food prices. And all of those American products we have to buy, out the window."

4457457,Downrigger,2016-01-16 14:50:00,60,"Having gone to Canada, except for 3 or 4 years since 1995, the exchange rate has never been the determining factor on whether to make the trip. However, while it has had some play, but not entirely in deciding where I might stay. I would say it was usually 3rd or 4th in importance in the decision. The others being quality and quantity of facilities, same for service, attitude of owners, etc. A couple of years ago, the exchange rate was 1:1, the Ca$ was equal to the US$. If the camp charged $1000 Ca. for a weeks stay, it cost me $1000 US. Today, that same camp is charging, lets say the same $1000 Ca. Now however, the exchange rate of an effective transfer of 1.43:1 means the same week will only cost me $699 Us. - not the $1000 US when at 1:1, a savings of $301 US. Again, while this will not dictate whether I go to Canada, it surely impacts on where I might stay, all else being equal - quality of water, facilities, service, etc. Tis a gift to just be able to fish the Canadian waters."

4455769,JAMOKIN,2016-01-15 21:24:00,48,Does it make any sense how a camp in Canada charges in US $ ? If the camp is in Canada it should be billed based on the Canadian $. I know that a majority of camps are owned by Americans but it doesn't make it right. I wonder if camps pay revenue Canada is US $ ? Oh wait a minute its all about the camp grinding the customer for every $ they can.
4455857,roscoe33,2016-01-15 23:09:00,653,"No, its all about the camp making it simple for us dumb Americans, so we know how much money to bring.

Out of my 10 years as an owner... 4 have been better for me and 6 have been better for my customers. I charge in US funds so that all my guests KNOW what they will be paying when they check out. They don't have to worry about the exchange rate going 15% against them... but they also don't get the benefit of the exchange rate going 15% for them. It all works out in a fair way."
4451865,pjshorthorn,2016-01-14 09:19:00,5654,It doesn't matter where you live. The only difference is where you get the best exchange rate when converting your Benjamin's to Loonies if you choose to pay in cash. PjShorthorn.

I would happily accept Canadian currency from a Canadian guest. However, I would be doing the exchange rate from my US prices."
4452025,roscoe33,2016-01-14 10:12:00,653,"I'm not quite sure why all the excitement about the exchange rate. If you like the resort, and are willing to pay the price asked, then it is a good deal. If the exchange rate would somehow crete a 30% increase in bookings for the resorts, it would be a good thing for all. But I don't see a whole lot of millenials jumping into the hunt/fish activities. Regarding our switch of resorts, it had more to do with the owners, road, facilities, and wind protected waters.. We could afford to spend more, but enjoy the place we are at. Lets see how long it lasts, as the resort is for sale."
4452825,Skywagon,2016-01-14 16:22:00,1106,"Roscoe, Maybe the plan is to keep the resort full (at whatever price) to make it look good to a prospective buyer, you are the winner no matter what, don't blame you.

4450537,OffCourse,2016-01-13 14:56:00,17,"I completely understand what you are saying. I'm saying that if the lodge kept their price the same and now the rate is 40% you are saving 40% from what you paid a couple years ago. And, just for hte record your math is off but I understood what you were saying. 40% of 1400 is not 1000."
4450865,Obabikon,2016-01-13 18:10:00,2370,We've beaten this dead horse... but there is NOT a 40% savings.Buy a gallon of milk in Canada... it isnt' 40% less if you pay in US or Canadian... its the same price if you're buying the same product.I am a resort that charges in US. We haven't raised our rates in 5 years. Simply because of a gradually improving exchange rate. If one resort charges $1000 USAnd another resort charges $1500 Canadian for the same services....You're not saving money by simply going to the one that charges in Canadian. Convert the costs before you decide what is your best option.
4450873,Obabikon,2016-01-13 18:21:00,2370,"Assuming this exchange rate holds... (you can probably get 1.37 right now). If you went to a Canadian resort, and they didn't raise their prices... you will be saving in the range of 10%. However, if that resort did indeed raise their prices... then you will save 10% minus whatever the price increase was. That is over last year's prices. It bottom out 5 years ago at about .95. The savings from a trip 5 years ago would be 40% minus the price increases. If a week at a resort was $600 canadian and now its $1200 canadian... the price has gone up about 10% in the course of 5 years. If it is still $600 canadian (very unlikely) then the price has gone down 40%."
4450969,Shellback,2016-01-13 19:29:00,8083,"Not sure where you buy milk in Canada, but if I go into the local Metro and buy a gallon of milk and pay with my US Visa card, Today I'd pay about $.70 US to the Canadian dollar. Offcourse brought up the subject of lodges raising prices. Sure if one charges $1000 US and another charges $1500 CN, there isn't much savings. But if they both charge the same $ amount, but 1 in CN funds and 1 in US funds, there's 30 to 40% savings."
4451041,Obabikon,2016-01-13 20:11:00,2370,"That's true, if you find someone who's 40% cheaper, they're 40% cheaper... it doesn't matter what they're charging in.Resort A costs $1000 USResort B costs $700 USResort C costs $1000 Canadian B and C are both 30% cheaper. If you find a good deal, you find a good deal. I'd be willing to bet that most resorts that are offering the same services, but charging in a different currency... are reasonably close to what the market is bringing. We all set our prices yearly. So, it isn't like the exchange rate magically jumped up 40%. It is up 10% from last year. So, if a Canadian resort raised their prices 10%, they are charging the same price as last year (in US funds). I know who my direct competitors are, and at least one of them charges in Canadian funds. For a 4 day and 5 night trip... american plan... we are within $40 US of each other. Resorts that are charging in USD's KNOW that they have to charge less to be competitive in the market. If you find a great deal for a trip... by all means take it. But charging in US or Canadian has nothing to do with the overall ""deal"". If you're down to picking between one that charges in Canadian and one that charges in US... and they happen to be the same price, you will indeed save 30% by choosing the Canadian one. However, that's not likely, unless you find someone who doesn't take market values or exchange rates into consideration when setting their prices. Those that do that... won't be in business very long."

Many things will be getting more expensive for them. In the US, many of us got beat up pretty bad back in 07 or 08, due to the real estate crunch and stock market.

4449929,v-bay gord,2016-01-13 11:47:00,3168,"That's the gist of the post. The US $ is worth more so if paying for goods / services priced in Canadian $ with U.S. funds, then you will get the equivalent discount. If it was reversed then you would pay more to make up the difference."

4450273,OffCourse,2016-01-13 13:37:00,17,"I think this is what Thompmd was getting at. If a lodge charged Canadian it seems as if the lodge is the main/biggest cost regarding these trips. So, wouldn't that mean you could try a new lodge that charged Canadian and essentially get a 40% discount off your normal trip? Most gas, sundry and other items are bought in the US anyway. At least that is what it seems like when I read posts."
4450377,Shellback,2016-01-13 13:58:00,8083,"Exchange rates can be a little confusing. Say a lodge charges $1400 CN and the exchange rate is 40%. You would pay $1000 US. But you didn't actually save 40% in US dollars, you saved 40% in Canadian dollars. If you divide the 1400 into 1000, you land up with .714, so you are saving a little over 28% in US dollars."
4450385,Shellback,2016-01-13 14:02:00,8083,"Exactly, 40% CN, but it seems to go over some folks heads."

But, if the lodge charged 1400 a couple years ago when it was almost an even exchange and STILL charges 1400 vs almost 2000, then you are getting a discount. Yes, you are getting a discount off Canadian dollars but it all depends on whether they have moved their prices with the rate. Which, I don't believe most of them do?"

If a lodge charges $1400 CN and the exchange rate is $1.40 CN to $1 US, you would pay $1000 US. What you aren't saving is 40% US $ though, you are saving 40% CN $. Say you show up at the lodge with a check for $1400 US. The lodge owner could say, that's too much. Your check is worth $1400 CN, so he hands you $400 CN back. When you try to exchange it for US dollars, you will probably get about $280 US."

4447017,bullhockey,2016-01-12 14:17:00,41,just checked it yesterday and it was 37% difference. Not bad.
4447057,oleJoe,2016-01-12 14:35:00,114,42% today. Good for the U.S. but not for the Canadians that winter in the U.S.
4447169,Andre (wallyandre),2016-01-12 15:02:00,2274,"Not good at all for us Canadians. They are many goods that are coming from the US, food in particular so it cost a lot more now to make the grocery and a lot of things are bught in US funds! No good at all for us."
4447177,Shellback,2016-01-12 15:08:00,8083,Folks booking Canadian lodges charging in US dollars might need to check out the bottom line. There's a hefty difference in costs from a few years ago. About a 30% savings in US dollars at today's rate.
4447185,Shellback,2016-01-12 15:12:00,8083,"If your Canadian stock market is following the slump here in the US, you are getting a double whammy!"
4447217,billy weaver,2016-01-12 15:24:00,470,"I have got my current rate sheet from the camp I have been going to for many years. $20 increase per person. Its a good camp so I will pay. I checked a few camps web-sites in the same area no reduction that I see. We do buy our gas in the U.S., boat and vehicle about 100 gals per trip so a savings there will be significant. This is the Ear Falls area and there are probably some reductions but I have not seen them. The one camp run by Canadians says rates are U.S. funds with a like rate for its Canadian customers. My eggs might be cheaper at 7-ll Dryden."
4449361,OffCourse,2016-01-13 09:03:00,17,Anybody have a good list of resorts that charge Canadian?
4449577,adempsey,2016-01-13 09:46:00,963,"I made a list a few months ago for fly-in outpost camp operators, some of which run lodges as well. I don't have anything for lodges.http://lineonfishing.com/index.php/c...-strong-dollarAlso note, I think some of the outfitters have even switched back to USD since I wrote that. When I started looking into this, I thought there would be some substantial savings for visitors from the USA. Ultimately though, I don't think that's the case. There are some good deals though. However, unless you're on a really tight budget, I wouldn't let the lodge rates be the most important factor in your decision. There are just too many factors to consider.Ultimately, I think the bulk of savings will be found in fuel, hotels and restaurants. I am not sure about savings with groceries and sundry items anymore, as the prices are increasing."
4449913,Thompmd,2016-01-13 11:34:00,320,"Explain the obvious to me, if the exchange Rate is 42%(or whatever the rate is) why wouldn't the customer from the US get 42% off the CDN rate? If the rate were reverse wouldn't I have to pay 42% more at the same Camp."
