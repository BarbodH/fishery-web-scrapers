4459841,Carnhzkr,2016-01-17 09:36:00,964,The only Canadian lakes covered by LM are LOTW and Rainey. For any other lakes you'll need the Navionics chip for North America. I see on the lake list for Navionics that Pakashkan is included:http://www.navionics.com/en/document...nics-lake-list
4459977,Andre (wallyandre),2016-01-17 10:34:00,2274,It's on the webapp:http://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en#@8&key=svslHncafP
4460881,rommel,2016-01-17 15:29:00,369,that appears to have pretty good detail. always worried about hitting sunken hazards
4460961,roscoe33,2016-01-17 16:02:00,653,Been there. A lot of Pakashkan has not been mapped. Certainly not with modern sonar. Hazards are not marked very well on that map. You can hit rocks or run aground in many places.
4461041,rommel,2016-01-17 16:30:00,369,any advise? lodge owner said they have a map also. that's a big lake to idle around on.
4461241,Shellback,2016-01-17 18:05:00,8083,"Looks like the new Garmin Canadian mapping covers pakashkan. I'll have to see if it's on my older Garmin Ontario inland lake chip. If so, I try and get a screen shot."
4461249,rommel,2016-01-17 18:06:00,369,that would be great. thanks

4469538,Shellback,2016-01-20 08:35:00,8083,"My Garmin chip is from 2010 and it's contours are identical to the Navionics. They both probably used mapping provided by Canada, and didn't map the lake themselves, so not sure how accurate they are. here's a Garmin screen shot, they do show rock hazards. If you PM me your email address, I can send you some screen shots.Whoops, couldn't post the screen shot, too big."
