4446001,Mr Ranger,2016-01-12 07:10:00,272,My good friend Nathan from Atlanta shared this link with me as it is between us and our favorite fishing camp in Nakina. For those of you that travel east west on Hwy 17 through Nipigon you have watched the building of the massive new bridge. It opened two month ago but had a catastrophic failure Sunday. This is simply amazing when you think about the magnitude to Ontario. Only detour is down through Wisconsin. They have temporarily opened one lane. Fortunately no one was hurt. Here is the link to the story. http://globalnews.ca/news/2445052/br...2a0e64ae9d7eb8

4446449,Mr Ranger,2016-01-12 10:14:00,272,"guess I never thought of it but that bridge is the ONLY way to get from West to East in Ontario. If shut down only route is through WI. They said people had crossed the bridge to get groceries and couldn't get back home. Only way was Sault Ste Marie, Duluth then back to Nipigon. Quite the choke point for transportation."
4450929,stillangling,2016-01-13 18:51:00,149,I heard on the news today that a company from Spain had the contract to build the bridge. Nice. 1300 transport trucks per day cross that bridge. One lane only and only one truck permited at a time.

4452633,JAY221,2016-01-14 15:15:00,877,According to an article I read the contract was awarded to BOT Construction Group which is a Canadian construction company but they may have subbed it out the article didn't say.
4453073,bigwillies,2016-01-14 18:34:00,515,"Ya i read that the company in spain (Ferrovial based in madrid) did the engineering but was afilliated with a reputable canadian company. They also said the structural steel was made in Canada,the cables in Spain and the expansion joints in China.Guess what part failed.go figure"
