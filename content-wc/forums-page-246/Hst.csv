You must provide a copy of your invoice that indicates the package purchased from the outfitter and also documentation that shows what's included in that package, such as a copy of the brochure or a web-page. If you provide the required documentation and properly complete the form, you'll receive a check for 1/2 of the HST paid in Canadian funds."

I'm not sure which sections to complete. Any further info on this???"

Your paper work from the lodge should show how much tax you paid and you get 50% back. Our lodge does a good job of explaining what to do and they always put on our paper work that a tour of the lake is included to make sure we qualify for the rebate. I like the tour part because he points out problem areas that can come up with the fluctuation of the water levels each year. He does it quickly but it does help. I know I have my paper work in my desk here at work, I can look into it later this week if you want some help. I have to leave shortly for Omaha and won't be back until Thursday. Send me a PM if you would like more info."
