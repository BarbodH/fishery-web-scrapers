The best part is Eddie bought 6 new 8"" foam mattresses and another 2 came in when we were flying out. Fishing was a little slow for the first 3 days. A lot of huge fish following baits but not biting. My brother in law had a big girl on for about 10 minutes and it came to the boat 3 or 4 times. The last chance I got to put it in the cradle it was longer than the cradle. At least a 50""er and it spit the hook. Weather was hot! High 80's and low 90's. first day the bay across from camp was 61 degrees and the last day it was 73 degrees. Walleyes were slow but my 7 year old son asked eddie to take us out and Eddie agreed. He took us down a couple sets of rapids behind camp and we found a ton of walleye holes in eddies zodiak. The last couple days the northerns heated up. We got numerous pike in the upper 30's, one 40"" one 41"" and a 43""er. Biggest walleye was 26 1/2. it was a great trip with family and friends especially the friend I made in August of 2011 Eddie Guergus! The man goes above and beyond to make your trip memorable especially if you have kids! I can't wait to try one of the new camps he just purchased. The only downside was Mosquitos were the size of humming birds and they were out in full force!!!"

We then took Eddie's advice for a 2014 trip which turned out to be one of the best kept secrets of Canadian fly-in fishing...Windsor Lake! A group of 7 of us fished this gem in 2014, 9 of us this year and we have 10 for 2016. I'll sum Windsor Lake up like this: 1.25 hour flight north of Nakina, 40"" Northerns, mid 20"" Walleye consistently, Loons, Beavers, Otters, Bald Eagles, Canadian Geese, Golden Eagles, Moose, Black Bear, Ducks, Ducks and more Ducks, bays, rapids, deep current, rock breaks, weed beds, deep freeze, fridge, screened in porch, electric (Honda generator powers camp), 10 beds, hot shower (in cabin!), hot and cold running water (in cabin!), fish cleaning house, 5 boats (2 Lund's, 2 Naden's and 1 Smoker Craft), 15 hp/4-stroke Mercury motors, new dock for 2015 and we don't want to exclude Nakina Air Service, Pennock's, family, great friends, cold Canadian beer, Cuban cigars, Kentucky's finest Bourbon and Walleye fish taco's. These are the components for a great fly-in fishing trip! Might of missed a few things but I think you get my drift. As Eddie would say,"

Lots of water, lots of fish, great accommodations, great friends, great food, a variety of wildlife, ""no cell phone signal""..albeit a sat phone is available if you must or need to make a call...and just an awesome experience. Can't wait till 2016 as this will be our third trip there in three years. And, lots of Ham n Cheese entertainment (inside joke), and we even invite the Pope and his Cardinal son! Does not get any better than this."
