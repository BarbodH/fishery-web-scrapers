Hate to dog the camp, but it wasn't kept up like it should. Motors were always in need of something and when you travel 30 minutes or more just to start fishing it became a bit of an issue for us. The waters are good for walleye and pike. The sense of adventure is tremendous as you can travel great distances on the water and find something new all of the time. We completely enjoyed our day trip to Trout Rapids. I still get a letter telling us about the year they had. It seems that it is the same letter with just the date changed on it. If you go I would love to see a report."
