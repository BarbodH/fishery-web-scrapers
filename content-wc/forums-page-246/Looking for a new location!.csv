4351761,pale ryder,2015-12-01 18:09:00,1937,"I highly recommend Cedar Lake. Good walleye and SMB fishing, also crappie and huge musky.Cedar is big enough that you shouldn't get bored and small enough that wind isn't a problem.The fishing is very good but not too easy like a fly in. This last July may brother and I caught between 20 to 100 walleye per day without fishing at night or twilight. Which is typical for the last 10 years fishing there.We stay at Clark's Northern Lights and couldn't ask for a better resort.http://clarksresorts.com/pages/view/...-lights-resort"
4352177,Walleye will,2015-12-02 06:27:00,218,Look at black bear lodge it can hold you group and they cook for you. But it's at a house keeping price at ($620). There's great fishing and great owners they also run it by themselfs.http://www.fishblackbear.com
4352801,Zac Amoroso,2015-12-02 13:01:00,2,"I would check out Kesagami Wilderness Lodge. They have some of the best walleye fishing. Most in the one to four pound range but 100 walleye days are common there and there have been some with guides who have had a walleye day of over 500. One gentleman went up for a week with one guide, himself, and his buddy and pulled out over 1000 walleye in that week. No spelling error, 1000!!! Check them out for sure! http://kesagami.com/"
4472906,reidcb,2016-01-21 08:21:00,24,1000 walleye in a week? That is a lot of fish. Three of us fishing out of my boat have caught and released 600 small mouth bass in 10 days. Bass are much easier to catch and release. It would be hard to catch and release that many walleye.
4474370,prov1800,2016-01-21 15:02:00,5010,Being a guide in the vermilion bay area has gving me the opportunities to experience a lot of lodges. So from that experience i can offer up a list of some excellent places to take a look at. Onaway lodge-lac seul temple bay-eagle lake northshore lodge-eagle lake sportsmns lodge eagle lake Clarkes northern lights resort-cedar lake cedar point resort-cedar lake north star lodge- clay lake big canon lake lodge-big canon-clay lake Cant go wrong at any of these places.
4475570,north560,2016-01-22 05:12:00,53,"I guess how far you want to travel is the first thing to look at. Check out Gowbushkon Lodge in Gowganda, no closed season for smallies, good walleye fishing, lots of pike ,perch and trout also in the main lake with lots of out lakes depending on how adventurous you are and what you want to catch that day.Great boats, clean comfortable cabins."
4328554,deke4257,2015-11-18 10:13:00,5,"I have a group of 8 usually, and we have been going into Sioux Lookout for years fishing Abrahms lake and Minnetaki. We have stayed at Frog Rapids, Tikinagan, and Abrahm's Lake park. We are looking for something new, we love to fish for eyes and smallies. open to new lakes. We almost went to Lac Suel last year but did not. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance."
4328666,ftfarms,2015-11-18 11:03:00,444,I would say lake of the woods around the morson area.
4329082,tv4fish,2015-11-18 14:52:00,2694,What stopped you?? There IS good walleye/smallmouth fishing there??
4329090,Obabikon,2015-11-18 14:56:00,2370,There's lots of amazing places... what type of trip are you looking for?
4329146,Downrigger,2015-11-18 15:24:00,60,"Like you we have fished NW Ontario since 1995, fishing Abram, Minnitaki, Both Vermillions, Lac Suel, Eagle and LOTW. Looking for something different, we are booked for next year to fish the Winnipeg River System out of Minitaki, Ontario. There are many resorts to choose from. We have decided on Paradise Cove, mainly due to cost. but facilities appear good. Like Lac Suel, The Winnipeg River System is large enough such that you will not run out of water to explore in a couple years. If there is a negative it is the limit of 2 walleye no greater than 18 in. But in reality we're talking about 2 fish. Based on my readings, there is a strong population of smallies, and muskies, with plenty of eyes and northerns. Within the system around Minitaki, there are 5 lakes, the farthest 10 miles. That's the same as going from Abram Lake to Grassy Bay on Minnitaki. PM me if you would care for more info."
4329170,Downrigger,2015-11-18 15:31:00,60,"Make that location MINAKI, Ont."
4329770,Cil,2015-11-18 20:23:00,10,Try Pipestone lake only 1 hrs from the I-Falls border all species to fish only 2 resorts on the lake
4339466,Aspencreek,2015-11-24 09:38:00,2911,Been fishing Pipestone in late July for the past 3 years (because my wife says so) it does not compare to what the fishing is on Lac Suel only 2 weeks earlier. 10 fish days compared to 80-100 fish days on LS. You be the judge.
4339570,zman8701,2015-11-24 10:59:00,100,You may want to look into fishing the Cedar River watershed. Wabaskang or Cedar Lake have plenty of both species.
4340730,WalleyeWally28,2015-11-25 07:13:00,298,We've been fishing Lac Seul for the last 19 years and love it. We fish out of Whitewing Resort near Ear Falls. It's very well maintained and up-to-date with some cabins that will handle your size group. Check it out.www.whitewingresort.com
