4421689,Ferrispata,2016-01-03 15:56:00,63,"Hi Folks, Trying to get some more information from folks who have used Air Melancon for fly-in to their Moselle territory. We are trying to decide on one of their lakes for fishing walleye and pike. So if anyone has any additional information on the fishing in some of their lakes (Vimont, Natakim, Sand, du totem, du Carney, etc), please let us know. Thanks much. Jerry"

Excellent cabin with solar lights and indoor shower and toilet, ok boats and motors, a caretaker who has a cabin on the North end of the lake with commo to main base. We were there in August, the walleyes were easy to catch, not huge but many. The pike catch was incidental but enough to be interesting. The folks who run Air Melacon are very helpful, even reserved a local motel for us the night before the fly in. The road is paved all the way to the air base, no rough gravel roads. Seanik"
4423873,Ferrispata,2016-01-04 10:19:00,63,Thanks. The fact that there is no gravel road is why we are going with them for this outing.
4427281,Ferrispata,2016-01-05 12:05:00,63,Anyone else have experience on Natakim and/or Sand Lake by chance? Those two were recommended by Francine from Air Melancon.
4429177,rsiminski,2016-01-06 08:07:00,53,I also have been looking at using Air Melacon for an upcoming trip but find it very hard to get reviews on the lakes they offer. I'm seriously considering taking two of my kids on their first fly in trip with them in 2017. Its probably the shortest drive for me when considering a fly-in. I have flown out of Clova a few times and if I can avoid 4 hours on a dirt road with two kids and shortening the drive to 9hrs compared to 14 it looks enticing. I plan on talking with them this year at the Harrisburg Sportsman Show.

4429881,Ferrispata,2016-01-06 12:41:00,63,"From everything that I have read about them, all is positive. And they are more than willing to forward some references. I was given two references to contact and I have already heard back from one and it is good things. And I very much like the fact that I don't have to drive on that gravel road to Parent and Clova. We shall see how much of a tradeoff it is in terms of quantity and size. This could be a future place to take my kids as well."
4430065,Andre (wallyandre),2016-01-06 13:25:00,2274,Air Mela√ßon are 1st class outfitter and the founder was still flying in is eithies and the kids took the business over with the same kind of management.
4430081,Guest,2016-01-06 13:31:00,0,"Where going to Sand Lake week of June 5th. This is the sixteenth year fishing in Quebec, 5th year with Air Melancon. They a very professional outfitter. Good year for a fly in with exchange rate."
4430113,smallcal,2016-01-06 13:35:00,119,"Nothing but good things to say about the outfit, first class operation. Used them to go to the Gouin when they owned Baie du Nord, have even used them since to fly to the Gouin when we didn't feel like driving that 4 hours on gravel/dirt."
