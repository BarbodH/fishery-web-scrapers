4447105,Boots,2016-01-12 14:45:00,19,Our group were one of the first to stay at Cherob Resort just after they built the first cabin. Time goes by so fast but that was perhaps 11 years ago. They built 3 more cabins since and now have 4. They are clean and are situated to give you a million dollar view of Lac Seul. Rob is also a certified outboard mechanic and has a repair shop at the location just in case you have some motor trouble. You wont regret going to Cherob Resort. A Polka a day keeps the doctor away.
4447521,Boots,2016-01-12 16:44:00,19,Forgot to mention we have went to Cherob Resort 9 or 10 times since they opened. We will be going the first week in August 2016.
4448233,MikeMcC,2016-01-12 20:23:00,72,Cherob does look nice. For really low rates/quality camps on Lac Seul check out Gawleys or Evergreen's camping cabins too.
