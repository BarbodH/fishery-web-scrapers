I don't go to far from Taylor cause there are plenty of good spots close by. If I travel at all, I""ll go North and East the most. Last night I was looking at the area on Bing Maps and Google Earth looking for points and reefs. As I looked West of Taylor around the Macleans Narrows area, I noticed a camp on the south side of the east end of the narrows. This is only 3 miles from Taylor but in all the time I've been around there I've never gone up that far. Does anyone know if it's an outpost and if so what lodge owns it? There are three docks and looks like 5 structures on the point. Just curious, Roger"
4446641,bigwalleye1,2016-01-12 11:33:00,2632,"Do a search for McLean's Narrows in the Canada forum. I believe that to be a private cabin, and I think I was part of a discussion on it a year or so ago."
4446969,gowrlop,2016-01-12 14:02:00,109,"bigwalleye1, Thank You."
4448737,bigwalleye1,2016-01-13 06:41:00,2632,"Nevertheless, if you get that was, as I recall, it's the coolest little cabin around, some small farm implements and a nice grassy area, little one level cabin on level ground, I ride by there just to look. C'mon POWERBALL!!!!!!"
4449105,tv4fish,2016-01-13 08:05:00,2694,"Looks like ""somebody"" has plans to buy a small cabin in Canada ????"
4449505,bigwalleye1,2016-01-13 09:34:00,2632,"...and a lifetime supply of jigs and minnows.... However at the current exchange rate, I'm gonna need a tow boat to carry enough CDN cash..."
4449569,gowrlop,2016-01-13 09:45:00,109,"bigwalleye1, I found the thread about the cabin, thanks. I plan to head that way this year and give it a look. It's funny how we just don't go that way at all. looking forward to checking it out and finding new spots that way. Great part of the lake with many spots to fish. Thanks for your help."
4449617,Jimmy Jig,2016-01-13 09:58:00,1905,How far from Sen Bay to Taylor island?
4449817,bigwalleye1,2016-01-13 11:00:00,2632,"Not sure on exact mileage, but I do know it's shorter going the other way around Big Island instead, say up thru Deception light, the Rags, past Banana Island (Ogamon) light, providing you're launching at Deception Landing."
4449857,pjshorthorn,2016-01-13 11:20:00,5654,"Based on the map I have, it would be approximately 15 miles from the eastern most part of Sen Bay to Taylor Island. That would not include any extra time going around islands or navigating narrows along the way. There is not a straight shot route to from point A to B. PjShorthorn."
