4460585,adempsey,2016-01-17 13:16:00,963,"Generally speaking, you should get ~60 to 65 hours with D cells. With AA you will get about 10 hours. 8 D cells weigh ~2.4 lbs, while 8 AA cells weigh ~0.4 lbs. Another option is two 6V 4F Lantern batteries which should operate for ~75 hours and weigh in at ~2.6 lbs.Couple questions though. What are you concerned about weight for? Fly-in or backpacking/canoe?Do you have electricity to recharge batteries?"
4465089,Bushman74,2016-01-18 19:22:00,8,It is a fly-in 100 lbs per man and that includes food and gear. There is a generator at the cabin for electricity or charging batteries at night. I did find a 12V 7A hr battery that is pretty small. made by either Cabelas or Humminbird. I think the weight is only a few pounds
4465169,adempsey,2016-01-18 19:45:00,963,I would just bring the 12V AGM SLA battery. Especially if the the air service owns the outpost.

3542906,Bill Krejca,2015-02-14 10:46:00,6107,Interesting. Thanks! Bill
3542986,adempsey,2015-02-14 11:05:00,963,"Good idea making that video! I did something similar but I used the Faston clips for my battery pack, which is how the portable sonars are set up to connect to the 12V AGM batteries.I did some testing on my older Humminbird 560 to see how long my batteries would last. Using 8 AA NiMH rechargable batteries it ran for 12.5 hours. You can get higher capacity batteries than what I used as well.Eight AA cell Duracell Alkalines it ran for 14.5 hours.Eight D cell Duracell Alkalines it ran for 92 hours.That was without the transducer hooked up, and I havent gone back to test if that makes a difference or not."
3543506,Ogoki,2015-02-14 14:53:00,291,"Mr. simon , I did the same as you for my canoe trip portable. I used the battery holder like the second one you showed. Only difference I did was to put the battery holder into a small waterproof plastic box that I picked up for $10 at Meijer. I use this on canoe trips where the battery holder usually ends up in the floor of a WET canoe . I drilled a small hole in the plastic box, ran wires thru with a wire tie on each side and then siliconed around the wire, to keep water out of the box. My friend in the other canoe did not use the waterproof plastic box and quickly found out the submerged batteries did not work. I appreciate guys like you who take the time to pass on very good info. I have picked up some good tips on this forum."

3545898,retire55,2015-02-15 11:16:00,1029,"Thanks for sharing your video. Its always great to see how others resolve issues. In passing, I have been very satisfied with a transducer bracket I purchased at Cabela's (see item # 1K-010095). It works on transom heights 15"" to 20""."
3545986,retire55,2015-02-15 11:33:00,1029,"I'm just another fisherman with an opinion. I would guess a pinging transducer would make a difference. Here's why. According to Humminbird, the current draw of a Humminbird 560 is 300 milliamps per hour. Running the 560 for 92 hours would require 27600 milliamps of power. When I checked the web for capacity of D Cell batteries, the capacity was about 13000 mAh - about half the capacity required to run the 560 for 92 hours (with the transducer connected)."
3547850,adempsey,2015-02-15 21:28:00,963,"Yes, it's possible the transducer might change the current draw. The unit is actually a 565 and the manual states it draws 225 mA, but like you said, running at 92 hours would put the current draw at about 125mA. I haven't bothered going back to test it again."
4458953,Bushman74,2016-01-17 05:54:00,8,"So help me out here. I'm looking at a Lowrance 5x Pro that draws 200 milliamps/hr. If 8 D cell batteries hold 13,000 milliamps that means I should get 65 hours of run time? I'm trying to find the lightest combo of batteries. Either take a couple sets of AA or one set of D"
4459881,Golden Eagle,2016-01-17 09:42:00,2642,Good plan. I suggest securing transducer cable to boat. And maybe use a strong C-clamp to secure transducer to transom. I'm sure that you have figured out why I suggest the C-clamp. My mistake was expensive. Was almost even more expensive.
