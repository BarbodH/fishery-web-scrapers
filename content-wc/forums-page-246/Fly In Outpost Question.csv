There is an outdoor toliet, but all paths are made of patio deck material, very flat, very safe. The path to the boats is the same. First rate people, great facilities, boats, and motors...and the fishing is the best I have ever had at Birch Lake."

Very best spot I have found is Amik Outposts ( Findlay Lake ) easy access flyin,indoor biffy , easy lake to fish and an absolute walleye factory, easy hondred fish a day each. catch and release ,keep a couple a day to eat. They have several lakes ,very nice folks ,their own otter aircraft. however they do book very quickly. we couldn't get in for 2016 so we are trying Conver Lake thru Wilderness air outfitters. I too am an old guy use a cane but love to spend time with my adult sons and next year grandsons, up in Gods country. Good luck tom myhervold 952-236-8918"
4474594,yoopertrout,2016-01-21 16:50:00,1172,"I recommend Kabeelo Outfitters. The run a really safe and organized operation. They have hot showers and flush toilets. On the lake we've been to (Dead Dog) there is somewhat of an incline down to the lake. I think their website had pictures of the cabins on most of the lakes. I think some are on flatter ground. We found the fishing to be great, both in terms of size and numbers. Have fun!"

I've done canadian fishing trips with my dad for the last 7 years but never a fly in. We're already booked for this year, but its never to early to start thinking about next year. One of my concerns is he has some issues with his back and uses a cane. With that being said anyone have some recommendations for camps with indoor toilets? Also easy terrain to get to the boats maybe a wood walkway or pretty flat ground. We cross the border at Ft. Frances so probably looking at areas in NW Ontario. Not interested in fly in lodges outposts only please. Thanks, Chris"
3635722,Mike Borger,2015-03-10 16:36:00,1554,"Easy recommendation for me would be Slate Falls Outposts. He has flush toilets in all of his camps and actual boat slips with aluminum handrails. Some of his long time customers are elderly and he installed the hand rails to make things easier for them. Great camps, great fishing and even better customer service."
3635802,SinOrSwim,2015-03-10 16:53:00,1528,"Second Slate Falls. The railings to assist with getting in and out of boats is a nice touch. Plus, rebuilt slips so they are in a V leaving more dock accessible to get in and out."
3636074,maddogg,2015-03-10 18:02:00,178,Third for Slate Falls Outposts. Fished Minnis for the last few years and most of Verne's other camps before that. Top notch.

3638210,SinOrSwim,2015-03-11 09:36:00,1528,"Add Red Pine Lodge onto your list. May not be the best outfitter as far as attention to detail but the cabins were nice when we went there. Have everything you need. Plus, fishing at Gull is very very good. We liked North Gull better than South but mostly because we had a few spots very very close to the cabin that were always good producers for both eaters and size."
3640498,1/4 oz Jig,2015-03-11 21:16:00,90,This was exactly the info I was looking for. Gives me some options to look at. [QUOTE=adempsey;3638138]the government is asking for some changes that the outfitters may not be able to accommodate. Care to elaborate? Not asking for the specific outfitters. Past few days in the 50's in Chicago area Spring is coming!

Gives me some options to look at.I am not certain, but I am guessing some new regulations are changing how the septic system is installed or managed. So, if they cannot comply they would have to go back to using outhouses. I'll try to find out some more."
