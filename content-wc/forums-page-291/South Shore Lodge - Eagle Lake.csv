But there doesn't seem to be a lot of current information on this camp Does anyone have a recommendation on this camp or are there others that should be considered. Goin in July with a group of 6."

We've loved it, and we're going back again this year. Lodge accommodations are basic but comfortable, and the lodge is fishing focused - no pool tables, game room, swimming beach, etc. Which we like. Location is great - not too many other lodges around and heading East onto the lake or North/West you can get into some great territory fairly quickly. It's officially a ""boat-in"" lodge - you drive to their landing, park, and they send a pontoon boat to pick you and your gear up, then ferry you across the lake (5 minutes) to camp on the opposite shore. No roads over there, which we also like. However there are two caveats I have to list. 1. There will be new ownership this season. We loved the past owner and found him to be a great guy who always goes above and beyond to make sure his guests are taken care of. For our 5th trip I brought the guy a bottle of Chivas 18 to commemorate half a decade at South Shore. The new owners are actually the previous owners from ~10 years ago, and I don't know them. Some of the older regulars at the lodge had mixed feelings on them. Though to be fair, they still returned. So I don't know how the ownership thing will change things. 2. Dad and I aren't really Walleye guys (blasphemy, I know) - we go largely for bass, big pike, and the occasional musky. We catch walleye, but generally don't target them. That said, plenty of guys at the lodge are walleye fishermen and there are a bunch of Walleye hotspots around the lodge. One area can get pretty ridiculous that is <5 minutes from South Shore, and attracts boats from V-Bay, Cedar Point, etc, which for those guys means a 30+ minute boat ride just to get to that spot. So to be fair we're not walleye guys, but I think you'll do well if you are. Hope that helps!"

Gordon was a great guy as was earlier stated. Jim and Gail are ok and we plan to be there in July. Looked at the cost and things have changed no more gas included and no more doz. crawlers. We love the fact it is a fishing lodge and very close to a lot of spot. Jim and Gail also own Tate Island Lodge un Red Lake, don't know how they will manage both but it is worth your while to contact them. We just like the whole experience at the lodge."
