Doesn't sound like the author salts them, just vacuum seals them, freezes them, and accesses them as necessary. I know that vacuum sealing minnows would take more time and effort and cost than just salting the minnows, but would like to avoid the salt on the hands (cuts) and reels. Does not salting them, just vacuum sealing them, degrade the life of the minnows? Am looking at taking about 40-50 dozen rainbow dace, 3-4"", in about 10-12 different packages. Would not be taking any back with me. Thanks for any info. you guys can provide!"

3647106,Braggart,2015-03-13 16:10:00,22,"From a guy who salts, freezes and vac pacs herring for bait for the coast... Salting and vac packing on trays tends to harden the bait and certainly extends the life and the look of the bait. The ""hardening"" of the bait is key, which salting does...as vac packing is tough on the soft nature of bait. Simply vac packing them wouldn't be something that I would recommend, although it could be done easy enough. If I was to simply freeze bait, I wouldn't vac pack, as it really doesn't do anything versus simply freezing and bagging...apart from adding cost (bags, machine, etc). Things to remember... - you cannot vac seal fresh bait, as you will pull the moisture out and the bait will disintigrate into mush. Bait needs to be pre-frozen. Also, trying to vac seal WET bait is nearly impossible. Frozen and hard is the key. - you need to first freeze the bait ""round"", using a tray and some wax/parchment paper, or you will not be able to separate the bait prior to vac packing. They industry calls it IQF, or individually quick frozen. All this means is that the fish are frozen individually, so you can freeze them as such. Helps when thawing...you do not need to thaw the whole lot when using. Just thaw and use what you need. - if you salt them prior to vac packing (as I do), they will remain somewhat soft even when frozen...so watch your vacuum strength setting...too strong and you will damage the bait. - I vac pack my bait on foam trays...keeps the bait straight and scales intact...important for salmon fishing. - always always always break the vac seal PRIOR to thawing...when it is still frozen and hard. Keeping the seal intact when thawing will turn the bait to mush when it finally thaws. Remember that the internal environment of the bag is a vacuum, so moisture will be pulled out of the bait when it turns from ice to water. (Good tip when thawing frozen vac packed slmon fillets as well...same principle. Keep them moist by breking the seal prior to thawing!). My 5 cents... B"
