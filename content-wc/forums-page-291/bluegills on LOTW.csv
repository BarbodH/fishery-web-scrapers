3638106,mt hook,2015-03-11 09:16:00,65,"I know, why bluegills. I was just thinking I have never cought one onLOW. The MNR say they are there so they must be right?How many times have you jigged off the dock at camp and caught everything but a bluegill.Just thought I would ask..."
3638322,Obabikon,2015-03-11 09:57:00,2370,"Every summer of my life... I've caught countless dock fish. I've never caught a blue gill. I know that they're in the lake, but the population is almost zero. Much more likely to jig up an eel pout, tulipe, white fish, or bullhead****I should say that I've caught plenty of blue gill... just not on LOTW."
3638474,deadhead1,2015-03-11 10:30:00,193,On any info I can find it doesn't list bluegills in LOW but I have noticed more black Crappie in the last few years.
3638482,Braggart,2015-03-11 10:31:00,22,"Short answer...yes. Off the dock along with pumpkinseed and rockbass. Not many over the many years, but more than a few to qualify as ""they are there"". Keep in mind that we have a cabin on LOTWs and ""over the years"" equates to over 30 years of sampling!"
3638490,LOW1,2015-03-11 10:31:00,2828,"I have never seen or caught a bluegill on LOTW. I have a copy of a 1972 report called ""The Fisheries of Lake of the Woods"" prepared by the Ontario MNR which has a checklist of fish found in lake surveys at that time. Bluegill is not listed. Brown bullheads were listed as ""Abundant in shallow, mud-bottomed, weedy areas"" but I have never caught one of those either. I have also never caught on LOTW a brook trout, which were listed as ""A recent addition, rare in the lake. . ."""
3638498,Algoma Guy,2015-03-11 10:33:00,48,I guided on LOW for three years....never saw a Bluegill or heard of one being caught. It wouldn't surprise me though. That lake has everything in it!
3638770,mt hook,2015-03-11 11:55:00,65,"It must be spring fever, it's got me, wishing I was fishing.I think the MNR said (pumpkinseed) in LOW. to me there all bluegills.30 plus yr. of fishing off the dock at every camp I have bin to including OBnot one bluegill. Maybe ill target some weedlines next time just to see.Whats the worst that could happen, ill catch a perch. not all bad."
3639362,Manitou,2015-03-11 15:12:00,125,"I seem to recall someone catching a pumpkinseed around my old boathouse way back when.But no bluegills.I've caught mudpouts while commercial fishing though, I know they are there.I've even seen one spawning."
3641922,Bill Krejca,2015-03-12 10:01:00,6107,"There are/were a few in Turtle Lake, P/o LOW. Maybe 30 years ago, we saw evidence of them spawning in shallow water at the east end of the lake. I think I heard that they were stocked back when. My guess for their scarcity/demise is that the water is just too cold for a healthy population. Crappies and smallmouth were both originally stocked, sometime around 1926, and they have become well established. Bill"
3646034,Baseline,2015-03-13 09:57:00,3207,I caught a few in the weeds on the east side of Whitefish near Vic and Dots resorts. We were bass fishing and saw them on the shoreline.
