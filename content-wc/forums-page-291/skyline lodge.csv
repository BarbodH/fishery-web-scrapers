3623786,Rayiii,2015-03-07 11:19:00,40,I won a fishing trip for 1 free person with one paid person. It is on Florence Lake near Perrault Falls ONT. The lodge is skyline lodge. Has anyone been here or know any thing about this lake or lodge. Any info would be great thanks.

We used jigs and minnows, and did very well. Thebest spot was straight out from the lodge a few hundred yards. They had a hump marked with a milk jug. Work around that, and you will do well. Our group got a few 25""ers. I believe that was our biggest. Lots of fish around 17"", great to eat. You should catch a number of northern also. You will enjoy it, and you cannot beat that deal. Have a great time."

3629201,Kevin R,2015-03-09 05:48:00,305,"A very nice Lake & Lodge. The lake is not large I have not fished it, the only people that have access is Skyline Lodge they also own the General store Dutches in Perrault Falls. I have spoken with many over the years that have stayed & they always speak of how nice it is & they had good fishing."
3631218,teddi,2015-03-09 15:01:00,349,Skyline does not own the lake and there is a public boat launch on the lake.
3637410,Kevin R,2015-03-11 06:28:00,305,Where is the boat Launch located ? It's not something I was aware of & I have fished just about all the lakes big in small in the area.
3637914,jambi,2015-03-11 08:08:00,504,"We stop in Dutchies every year. We did talk to some fellas in the store that were guests at their Florence Lake camp. They really bragged about their success. Basically told us we should cancel our fly out and just fish with them Just looking at the skyline website they quote on front page ""Because our guests are the only fishermen on Florence Lake the quality of fishing keeps them coming back year after year"""
3640042,teddi,2015-03-11 18:44:00,349,"The boat launch is half a mile north of Florence creek. A lot of camp owners claim to own the rights to lakes but they don,t. I would like to see them try and stop me from fishing any lake I want to."
3640170,v-bay gord,2015-03-11 19:21:00,3168,They do? Why not name a few...
3641178,Oldicecoach,2015-03-12 06:57:00,15,"Using aerial photos it appears there is a rough boat landing on Florence Lake off 105. The access point is located off 105, approx 1 mile north of Florence Creek. The trail to the lake is 1000 ft from the access point to the boat landing.Florence Lake is approx 1200 acres.Per website, Skyline Lodge has an interesting outpost cabin located on Cristene/Brown Bear Lake. The cabin is accessed by ATV and a boat ride to the island camp."
