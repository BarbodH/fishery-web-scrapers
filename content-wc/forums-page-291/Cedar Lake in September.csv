We enjoy walleye fishing, but we also really like to cast for northern and are anxious to toss a few musky lures as well. Finding some decent size perch or crappies would be icing on the cake. We're not real fussy - just love to fish and enjoy the outdoors. We're looking for any advice you all might have for what we can expect on Cedar Lake in mid-September. Thanks much!"

We only fish walleye, but catch northern and musky also. People have their own preferances as far as what side to fish, you should do well on both. At that time of the year, we catch fish in everything from 6'-34'. If you do not catch them right away, move. Try a new depth, we usually catch them in 25' plus, at that time of the year. Try different baits, and lots of different depths. You will enjoy it."
3628961,ftfarms,2015-03-09 01:33:00,444,Cedar lake is one of my favorite smaller lakes up north. The only time we didn't do very good is the second week of September. We've also fished lac suel and lotws at the same time and didn't do very well so we gave up on September fishing we always hit a cold front. Lovely time to be up there We did find some nice walleyes in the far south end of the east side and around gull island . Had two nice musksy to the boat. we didn't try for crappies. The biggest musky was in the little bay by bald rock the other was by the burnt bridge. We did catch a few walleyes farther up past the burnt bridge on the left in deeper water. Good luck I really like the lake and cedar point resort. We are going mid July or last part of August haven't decided yet.

Musky & Walleye fishing should be good, Pike fishing not so much. The Pike fishing could be on the upswing though last season Keynote Lake connected to Wabaskang seamed to have more Pike. Lots of water to explore very protected from winds because the lake has lots of narrow areas."

3630962,fish007,2015-03-09 13:44:00,120,If you like lake trout a day trip over to arabus is fun . We've also caught some nice northern pike there .
3632322,Kevin R,2015-03-09 19:34:00,305,1998 is the last time I fished Aerobus few years back started down the road & it was rougher than a cob turned around never been back. One lodge was on the Lake fishing was very good. Very clearwater boat launch was terrible all rocky.
3633954,fish007,2015-03-10 10:01:00,120,"We quit going to cedar 6 years ago but aerobus was the lake we fished the 1st day before unloading our boats on Cedar for the week . It's about 16 miles down a narrow road and the landing isn't the best but we thought it was worth investing a day there . Cedar can be really good - I caught my biggest walleye there - 33.5 "" and got into some big whitefish occasionally. We never concentrated on crappies as we mainly fished walleyes but I would think in sept. the crappie fishing would be good."
