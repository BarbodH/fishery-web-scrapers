3641810,bushy,2015-03-12 09:33:00,17,There was one in my backyard this morning right by my game camera. Went out and he ran away. Checked my game camera and NOTHING. So I am pretty sure they are undetectable by cameras. That is why nobody ever recorded one on cameras. I think they are everywhere.
3642210,Fonzie,2015-03-12 11:27:00,85,"Here's a post of mine from a similar thread, take it for what it's worth... ============================================== Last year at a family reunion I was talking to my cousin. My cousin is in his early 60's works as a CPA, does not drink or use drugs and has zero paranoia issues. He is your typical ""bookish"" person.He does have a interesting hobby though. He likes to hike for 3 or 4 days at a time into remote parts of Wisconsin with just a tarp and a few necessities with him. All of his many trips had been uneventful, but after his most recent trip into the backwoods he said he'll never go into the woods alone again.This is the story he related to me: He said that 2 years ago he was hiking out of the woods on a bright sunny morning and got that feeling he was being followed/watched. He thought maybe some wolves were tracking him. This went on for a few minutes and he was starting to get edgy after he heard some strange huffing/grunting/growling sounds. Well he climbed up a bit of a ridge to get a better view of his surroundings.Then it happened. The forest suddenly went completely silent, and 15 feet away, clear as day, a hairy {not furry}, 5 foot tall, slender, muscular, humanoid creature stepped out onto the ridge with him. He described it as humanoid even though it had a somewhat pronounced snout and very sharp looking teeth, but the teeth were not overly large or menacing. It had hands that looked similar to ours. He said he locked eyes with this creature for a good ten to 15 seconds {which was an eternity he related}. He said he could tell that the creature had sentient intelligence.Now here's the real kicker, he said as the creature loped/walked away through the woods, it's knees bent the opposite direction than ours. Sort of like that alien from the movie ""The Arrival"" with Charlie Sheen.Personally, I would have to experience the above incident myself because it is simply too outrageous...Again, my cousin is as straight-laced as you can imagine and he's not been back in the woods since... ."
3642266,fishron,2015-03-12 11:44:00,317,"Man they are messy eaters. Found this down by my pond not far from the footprint.I have heard calls in the evening similar to the TV show, but then some of my neighbors step outside and let loose when their kids are driving them nuts."
3642282,doubleheader,2015-03-12 11:47:00,2652,I suspect your cousin had a stroke or injested some hallucinogenic shrooms.
3642482,fishron,2015-03-12 12:38:00,317,"Hey DH, you might be on to something there, I haven't seen him for a long time. But on second thought, no. He lives in California."
3642642,Nimstug,2015-03-12 13:12:00,2605,"Since he was in Wiconsin, that must have been a hodag."
3645186,sloughboy,2015-03-13 07:54:00,13,"personally I have never seen the creature, but I have fished with a pair of world known vets that while fishing one of the connecting lakes to lac suel witnessed a Yetti jumping off an island chasing an albino beaver. They swear by the story."
3636978,rnnonmt,2015-03-10 21:58:00,992,I think most of the people who have seen big foot can be narrowed down to the flower children of the late 60's and early 70's if you know what I mean.

3637586,tv4fish,2015-03-11 07:05:00,2694,YES --- We certainly know what you mean.............
3637802,fishron,2015-03-11 07:46:00,317,Hard to get a picture of the critter but the tracks speak for themselves.
3638682,Obabikon,2015-03-11 11:33:00,2370,"I know how to draw baby footprints on a foggy window too, but that doesn't mean a baby has actually been walking up my windshield!"
3639746,123chadder,2015-03-11 17:06:00,429,"lol,so true! look guys,70 years and no solid evidense,the first tracks ever found in canada(the ones that started the craze)were found to be fake.....all good fun,but the best hunters i have heard of dont believe either....."
3639842,ohiojmj,2015-03-11 17:28:00,1262,My 14 year old nephew has size 13 feet. Yes.
3640994,johnboat,2015-03-12 06:28:00,2014,There is only one left. Some guides have him tied to a tree in Wisconsin. You can get your picture taken with him for a small fee.

3633634,HeHooksHimself,2015-03-10 08:43:00,725,"Of course there are BigFoots. If you watch Finding Bigfoot, they hear them and ALMOST catch them on camera every show. Also, how else would they know how a Bigfoot yells if they haven't really seen one. And then there are all those eyewitnesses. Come on people, let's be reasonable. Those on that show seem pretty credible, especially BoBo."

3633738,maddogg,2015-03-10 09:09:00,178,One of my first trips I went on a fly in to Snelgrove Lake in Ontario.A few years ago I saw that a team of guys( Monster Quest) went there because some guys reported strange things happening there. They didn't find much of anything.All I found was good fishing.
3635082,bigwalleye1,2015-03-10 14:15:00,2632,I think there's been more than one of you eating beans off rocks.....
3635594,REG,2015-03-10 15:58:00,445,"Never actually saw one, but pretty sure one crawled into one of our cabin's bedrooms one night. Good gawd can those things snore.."
3635650,fisherman 1,2015-03-10 16:17:00,39,I had a friend that saw one.... but I think there was a lot of Captian Morgan's in his system when he spotted the beast.....
3636442,srk-low,2015-03-10 19:03:00,78,You are all naive! After a long day of fishing Whitefish Bay on Lake of the Woods my friends and I returned to find a SQUATCH in my cottage. Never say never.
3636682,Mich_Fisherman,2015-03-10 20:09:00,292,"2 guys from our group swear they saw Sasquatch on a remote island right at dusk in northern Ontario. They said he appeared out of this saucer type thingy and left him on the island. I don't know, maybe there was Labatts involved, but not sure."

3633170,SinOrSwim,2015-03-10 06:39:00,1528,"Saw it in the other thread. My son and I would watch Finding Bigfoot. While it is a silly show, he is 9 and it is fun to imagine if they really exist. So, have you ever seen one? Do you believe? *EDIT: ""seen"" bigfoot. Won't let me edit the title"
3633194,123chadder,2015-03-10 06:47:00,429,"no,because bigfoot doesnt exist"
3633210,Obabikon,2015-03-10 06:50:00,2370,"You would be surprised how many times (while sitting in a sport show booth) people come up and ask me this. There are a ton of ""believers"" out there. I will agree. I've never seen a bigfoot, because they don't exist."
3633258,Hot Runr Guy,2015-03-10 06:57:00,16061,"I've met Rick LaCourse, his screen name was ""Bigfoot"". Does that count? HRG"
3633274,SinOrSwim,2015-03-10 06:59:00,1528,"I go back and forth. First, I think it is almost impossible something like this exists and there have never been remains or anything of substance actually found. But, then I wonder how so many different people in so many different cultures have reported sightings that seem so similar? Much of this was before the age of the internet too. I lean heavily towards no, but there is still a curiosity of possible."
3633290,lcwhit,2015-03-10 07:08:00,104,my sister in law has big feet. does that count?
3633370,johnboat,2015-03-10 07:46:00,2014,"But with all the technology, trail cameras, and video If Squach was out there, we would have met them by now. Even in the remote regions they are supposed to inhabit. But I hope Bobo won't give up. He's a hoot!"

3633594,Mike Kansas,2015-03-10 08:39:00,1463,Played basketball against Bob Lanier. Size 22 shoes...close enough to Bigfoot for me.
3633610,Blue Lk,2015-03-10 08:42:00,269,Yes he exists & originates from Manitoba.His parents own the place next to me at the lake
