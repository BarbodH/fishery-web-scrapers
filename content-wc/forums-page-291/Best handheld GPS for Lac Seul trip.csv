3639458,SinOrSwim,2015-03-11 15:49:00,1528,Our camp boats have depth finders but I take my own. I like the color screen and I like to look at just one screen that is sitting there. I don't have to hold it to see where I'm going. Many times on Lac Seul I am looking down at the screen periodically while I'm driving to make sure I'm on my line. I know it was a safe route. I don't have to have something in my hands that way. Just another thing to think about before you buy.
3641090,Jwendt15,2015-03-12 06:41:00,72,"I usually bring a portable charger just in case. You can get about another two full charges on a smart phone so they come in handy if you are using that as your GPS. SinorSwim, I noticed on another post that you work at Onaway, is that still the case? If so, I'll be seeing you this summer. We have our trip scheduled at Onaway on June 12th."
3641202,SinOrSwim,2015-03-12 07:04:00,1528,I do not work there but we do go there in September and have for the last 4 years. Not sure if you have been there but those facilities are top notch. Love that fish house.
3641282,Oldicecoach,2015-03-12 07:22:00,15,"I have been using a Garmin GPSmap 78s on flyins. This unit is loaded with features, the one I like the best is the ability to load satellite imagery on it. Garmin has a Birdseye Satellite Imagery subscription for $30. Before your trip download images for the area you are fishing. It is much easier to see features on imagery than a map."
3641362,Jwendt15,2015-03-12 07:46:00,72,"Haven't been there before, we stayed at Evergreen last year. Wanted to try a different part of the lake and apparently there are plenty of good spots close to Onaway. From the pics on their site, looks like you can't beat the quality of their cabins. Can't wait to go."
3641514,sauvain,2015-03-12 08:29:00,63,Looking at this HELIX 5 SONAR GPS PT | HELIX Series by Humminbird. It has a depth/fish finder and GPS built in...it is also portable to go on the resort boats...any experience with this unit?
3634314,sauvain,2015-03-10 11:22:00,63,Looking for a top notch hand held GPS for Lac Seul trip in July...looking in the $350 to $500 range. That has a downloadable map of Lac Seul...thanks for any help
3634410,bushead11,2015-03-10 11:37:00,151,For navigation purposes only or to actually have lake charts and fishing spots built into the device?
3634602,sauvain,2015-03-10 12:01:00,63,"Actually was hoping to use it for a little of both if possible. I would suppose since we have a good depth finder we should be ok for that...but will need a GPS to keep tracks, routes, etc."
3634666,Mike Borger,2015-03-10 12:12:00,1554,"Strictly speaking handheld devices for navigation I have a Garmin GPSMAP 64s and love it. You need to get a Garmin topo map for central Canada, it covers a wide area from Saskatchewan east to Quebec. You can download the map right to your unit from the net which sounds great in theory but really isn't. It's notoriousy difficult to do this. You're far better off buying the actual map chip and inserting directly into the unit."
3634682,bushead11,2015-03-10 12:14:00,151,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...t=garmin+etrex Check out this thread. I posted in it as well. Pretty inexpensive device will get the job done. I love my garmin etrex venture and wont break the bank if it goes overboard, gets crushed or lost."
3634714,Limeyangler,2015-03-10 12:26:00,563,"Would have to agree with this. I have the older 62s. Top pieces of equipment, not sure about the lake maps you could get, and they are generally pricey, but with your budget you could get both."
3634794,Carnhzkr,2015-03-10 12:57:00,964,"For a whopping $15, you can download the Navionics app to your smart phone. It'll record tracks and way points, has depth contours and is in color. I've also used a Garmin Etrex 20 with the Canada chip, which is their bottom of the line model. Between the two, I find the Navionics to be easier to use since the screen on my phone is much bigger than the dinky screen on the Etrex. Either will work for charting a course, locating reefs and getting you back to camp."
3637634,Jwendt15,2015-03-11 07:13:00,72,"I'll second the recommendation for the Navionics map. We fished out of Evergreen Lodge last year and used nothing but that app on my smart phone. If anything, spend the money on some good protection for your smart phone as it can get choppy out there. I just made sure to update everything before leaving for the trip. Did not get service out on the lake but the GPS function worked great. App also has features to which you can mark spots and save the safe paths you took. Great app and very inexpensive."
3638410,mwh624,2015-03-11 10:20:00,183,I run a garmin 62s and really like the unit. Serves me well year round. Built in compass is a nice feature. Pretty good battery life too. I go all day on a set of eneloop rechargeables. Would be nervous about a cell phone being able to go 10+ hrs a day. Hate the idea of a touch screen gps as I don't want to take gloves off when ice fishing/duck hunting.
3638586,Carnhzkr,2015-03-11 11:02:00,964,"I doubt a cell phone would go 10 hours running GPS, but I charge off my AC adapter. Before I had my own boat, I clamped a $5 AC adapter to the starting battery of the camp boat. Where there's a will there's a way."
