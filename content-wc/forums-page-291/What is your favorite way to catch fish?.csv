3634834,jambi,2015-03-10 13:07:00,504,"Most enjoyable for me while in Canada is the Johnson's Silver Minnow for pike. Enjoy watching them ambush from the weeds, pounding the bait that is running just under the surface. Having them push a wake on their way gets my heart racing!"
3634994,stjoeguy,2015-03-10 13:56:00,979,"My favorite, like kzoofisher, is pitching jigs toward a shoreline or rock pile and working it back toward the boat, letting the jig rise and fall without getting in the rocks. This is where a braid line like Power Pro shines, allowing you to instantly feel the slight tap and set the hook. It makes me smile just thinking about it."
3635074,bigwalleye1,2015-03-10 14:14:00,2632,I'm with eye hunter. I can jig for days on end. Gotta be about the simplest way to catch walleyes there is.
3635090,Yarhcaz,2015-03-10 14:19:00,1389,"Favorite way is pitching a Jig, it separates the men from the boys lol! There is nothing quite like working a jig back and feeling a nice walleye inhale the Jig."
3635186,Fishoil,2015-03-10 14:48:00,1277,"I've yet to find a way I don't like to catch fish but for my favorite I have to go with pitching jigs. I love to follow a shoreline or reef and work them back to the boat, or else pitch a jig out into current and work it downstream and then swing it cross-current. There's nothing like feeling that tick when a walleye picks it up or the thump when they nail it hard."
3635258,Gregking,2015-03-10 15:01:00,2658,X2. Or perch.
3635298,3M TA3,2015-03-10 15:07:00,2846,My favorite is spearing but since you most likely are talking about taking Walleye I would say bottom bouncers although when the fish are congregating it is really hard to beat jigging. Whatever works best at that time is my favorite though.
3635338,johnboat,2015-03-10 15:11:00,2014,"My favorite way to catch fish?............................One right after the other!!!! Vertical jigging, of course."
3636930,rnnonmt,2015-03-10 21:38:00,992,"Favorite way for me is where you can do no wrong. doubles, triples, bite-offs, casting, jigging crazy action. Nothing gives you a better buzz. My favorite was my dad and my cousin taking a break from fishing. My cousin laid his rod down over the side of the boat with a black/gold bucktail bobbing the surface of the water.....WAMO this is what happened."
3624066,kzoofisher,2015-03-07 13:21:00,5144,"Reading the ""100 fish day"" thread, and the responses that it can get boring, got me thinking about the way I most like to catch fish in Canada. Naturally, it isn't only about catching fish, but it isn't only about other things either. I don't drive that far to not catch fish. For me the absolute most fun is when we can cruise along a shoreline, casting jigs up into the shallows and working them past structure and down a drop to the boat. I'm using my skills to throw at specific targets and varying my retrieve to drop into openings between rocks and weeds. Strikes are usually visible up shallow and aggressive out deeper. Species will be mixed so you never know what will hit next. The pace is usually steady but not so fast that I can't have a snack or discuss life in general with my friend and my son. The scenery is close enough for details on one side and far away enough for a vista on the other. Very often we will develop a pattern where we know when we are moving into an area where the bite will heat up and the anticipation is a lot of fun. Yes, I like finding and working humps, trolling harnesses/cranks, rigging, vertical jigging, bobbering, dragging jigs etc., but casting along a shoreline is the thing I think of most when I'm dreaming of Canada."
3624178,unclepaully,2015-03-07 13:43:00,112,"My absolute favorite is the rare time when a good top-water bite is happening with Pike. I'll throw a buzz bait or spook. There's nothing better than to see the surface explode and feel the weight of the fish. For walleye any type of jig fishing is what I enjoy. Did I mention I despise trolling. I'll do it to find fish, but I hate it."
3624242,Mike Borger,2015-03-07 14:16:00,1554,Casting. Especially shallow water for giant pike when you can see the fish.
3624554,Algoma Guy,2015-03-07 15:28:00,48,Down rigging for giant Lake Trout or Salmon. Oh Ya bottom bouncing for walleyes is pretty fun too!
3624634,sptrix,2015-03-07 15:48:00,175,"Walleyes -- I love trolling tiny crankbaits over shallow flats when the feedbag is on. Pike -- Hard to be a topwater bite. Smallmouth -- Love catching them on topwaters, but also really enjoy fishing suckers in the current under slip bobbers for them in the winter. Lake Trout -- absolutely my favorite fish to catch . . . no more fun way to do it than jigging for them in deep water...i love seeing them on the graph, reeling up 30 feet, jigging and having them pound it"
3632874,Ebarnett,2015-03-09 22:33:00,60,"Slip bobbers. Going...going...gone! Even though this is often considered one of the most basic forms of fishing, there is actually a good bit of skill involved. Gotta have all the slack out of the line, gotta know how hard to jerk based on how far away your hook is. Too hard you risk breaking the line, too soft you wont get a good hookset. But watching the bobber disappear, for me, thrilling!"
3633234,BornToFish,2015-03-10 06:54:00,1224,I am fortunate to fish in NW Ontario several times each year. I leave next week for Sunset Country to ice fish for lake trout. My preferred techniques for fishing change throughout the open water season in response to the seasonal movements of the fish. The key thing for me is feeling the bite when the rod is in my hand. It doesn't matter to me if it is a walleye loading up the rod when vertical jigging or having a musky crush my lure in the figure 8. The next bite is just moments away!
3633514,MrSimon,2015-03-10 08:14:00,922,"Similar to ksoofisher, I like to work slowly along a shoreline casting in an around cover and structure. Instead of a jig though, I love small spoons and spinners. To me, feeling a fish hit a moving lure is more exciting than feeling the tick tick while vertical jigging."
3633586,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-10 08:39:00,1460,I like to sit in the vortex of fast moving water and cast behind the eddy and hop a Roadrunner jig with a thumper tail tipped with a leach.
