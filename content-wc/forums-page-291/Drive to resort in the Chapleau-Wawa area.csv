3630578,MrSimon,2015-03-09 11:52:00,922,I've been to Happy Day twice in the past three years. Great place!!! I've made a handful of posts/reports that you can search up for plenty of details and photos. Or feel feel free to contact me directly for more specifics.
3621234,Mich_Fisherman,2015-03-06 15:42:00,292,Looking for recommendations to a drive in resort lake in the Chapleau/Wawa area (within 2 hr of the Sault) that I can take my boat to (1900 Tyee)Looking for good fall Walleye Fishing with decent accommodations.I am only interested in recommendations if you've been there in the last 5 (or so) years.Thanks
3621242,Mike Borger,2015-03-06 15:48:00,1554,"Easy answer for me, Happy Day Lodge on Windermere Lake. You'd be very fortunate to find an opening though, they're always pretty booked.http://www.happydaylodge.com/index.htm"
3621410,Mich_Fisherman,2015-03-06 16:46:00,292,Thanks Mike....how many times have you been there? When was your last trip?
3621514,Mike Borger,2015-03-06 17:26:00,1554,I haven't been there. Much of what I do for a living is offer trip planning assistance and booking. I have helped a number of people book with Happy Day over the last three years and have heard nothing but glowingly positive feedback.
3622210,Tayzak15,2015-03-06 22:23:00,48,"Horwood Lake. Horwood Lake Lodge, Big Bear Camp or Horwood Lake outpost would be your options on the lake. Never stayed at any of them, but I am from Timmins and Fish this lake about 20 times during the year. Versatile body of water where we target pig walleye most of the year with plenty of eating sized fish as well."
3622218,3M TA3,2015-03-06 22:29:00,2846,"I've been going there for four years, last year spent 3 weeks there. Lots and lots of fish. Walleye and Bass. Heck even the pike population is growing. Many fish to be caught and the average size has been going up year after year. There are definitely some real trophies in Windermere however 12 to 16 inch Walleyes are easy targets and plentiful. If you're willing to work a bit you will definitely catch them big fellas too. Great fun and the host are the finest people I've ever met at any lodge. Hard working and definitely there to make your stay a good one. Price is hard to beat too. Also, it's a good 3.5 to 4 hour trip from the Sault."
3622250,Bayou,2015-03-06 22:55:00,52,"Happy day lodge was full when I looked into their place but prairi bee camps which is next door to windmere had a couple openings. They are owned by the same people and when I talked to them they were pleasant and honest about the lakes and cabins. I've also stayed at Kanipahow resorts twice, which is near wawa. At Kanipahow we stayed at the main location and also went to their drive in outpost lake but you would not be able to take your boat to the drive in lake. The last time I stayed with Kanipahow we did not have have good terms but now the place is owned by another person and they seemed like very good people. I don't know what your true expectations are but I would go back to the above mentioned places if I wasn't doing fly ins in that area. Good luck and I would hurry to find a place."
3622402,Mike Borger,2015-03-07 04:49:00,1554,"Have heard great things about Prairie Bee as well.Kanipahow is closer to Chapleau actually. And all of their drive in outposts are south of there. Great choice though if you're looking for a fly in quality experience for a fraction of the cost.Most if not all of their outposts used to be fly in only until logging roads pushed in close. The general public cannot use these roads to access the lakes so far all intents and purposes you're still getting a fly in experience.You can't drop a large boat in those lakes but there are other obvious advantages.If anyone's checking their website is currently down and I've been told it's being fixed/updated.Have no clue about the old owner, but the new owners are extremely nice and have been great to deal with.Drop me a line if anyone has any interest, I have plenty of info.Cheers"
3625306,Mich_Fisherman,2015-03-07 19:27:00,292,Thanks all for the replies. Any other lakes to try in the Chapleau/Wawa area?
3626025,Mike Borger,2015-03-08 07:18:00,1554,"Not exactly Wawa/Chapleau, but definitely in your wheelhouse.I have heard great things about this lodge and the fishing.http://brennanharbour.com/yourstay.htm"
