We would like to keep our "" slot "" for 2016, but would like to avoid losing our deposit by offering our reservation to someone else this year. We just want to offer another group a high demand date but want to keep the same reservation for 2016. If we cancel without a "" substitute"" , we will lose this time slot reservation next year. The boat is a 65' / two bathroom that can sleep 8 ( or ten if you use the fold out couches ) If interested , please contact me at [email protected]. You would need to send the houseboat company a $ 1000.00 deposit. ASAP. I have posted this in the Share A Seat forum also. thanks!"
