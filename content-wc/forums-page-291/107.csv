3509090,port1042,2015-02-04 18:44:00,509,Manotak Lodge on Perrault Lake for us. I may well see you on the road! Wave as you go by. We will drive up on Friday to Nestor Falls then on to Perrault Falls on Saturday morning. I much prefer driving Hwy. 71 than Hwy. 502. It only adds about 20 minutes to the trip and it's really a lot more relaxing drive. We will fish in Nestor Falls on Friday evening and should be checked in and on Perrault Lake by 3:00 on Saturday. Can't wait! This will be my 6th trip since September of 2012.
