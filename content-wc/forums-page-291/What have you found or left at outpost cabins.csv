3637026,Bayou,2015-03-10 22:25:00,52,"Easy now, plenty of good Buckeyes here. I will say that I have spoken with Mike several times recently and he was always helpful and sincere."
3637034,Kwags,2015-03-10 22:30:00,48,"Ebarnett Good to know! It's amazing the coincidences on this site. Pikeslayer, all the way out in Colorado, has family in my hometown. His mom grew up here. His uncles kids and me went all through school together. He and I fly into the very same lake year after year with different groups.I was just hopefully lightening the mood with Tooski. His profile says ohio, and mike had told that story a couple pages back"
3637042,Ebarnett,2015-03-10 22:32:00,60,"All in fun. Being from WV I'm usually on the short end of the haggling. By the way I was pulling for you guys in the National Championship. But that is because of the teams in it, I disliked OSU the least."
3638570,Pymbet,2015-03-11 10:58:00,42,"In response to the original post, we landed at one camp and the guys coming out announced that they were doing us the ""favor"" of leaving a ten pound slab of bacon, two dozen eggs, and some potatoes (which we found were already cooked and in a pot in the fridge). We ended up not eating any of it and basically hauling their old food out as trash at the end of our trip. To those responding to Mike B, I say, don't criticize the canoer until you have been there. I have only completed one shorter canoe trip in northern Ontario, but after a few days, coming across an empty cabin looked very inviting for at least a comfortable night's sleep. Don't recall whether we ate anything, but a canoer carrying limited supplies eating some of the left over food at an obvious fly-in camp (not a trapper's or private cabin) would seem justifiable in the grand scheme of life. Last day of our trip we were down to pop tarts and fish - so a little flour or oil from a camp would have been a blessing. We had canoers come into our camp on the Albany and we willingly shared food and beer with them. They asked for a gallon of gas (they had a little two-horse motor) and we shared that too. I guess it wasn't our gas to give away, but how could you say no."
3638690,digjig,2015-03-11 11:35:00,146,"At Carroll Lake, the prior residents left 4 nice rib eyes, 3/4 case of LaBatts Blue, 1/4 flat of crawlers, 6 frozen sucker minnows and a case of bottled water. All were consumed and enjoyed. At Cochrane Lake, we found some vintage, well weathered lures hooked to the kitchen. Left them there as they were rather nostalgic. We typically leave condiments/oil for the next party if the kitchen seems to be running low. -DJ"
3632594,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 20:39:00,1554,"I didn't feel like I needed to explain myself to anyone....but I paddled for a great many years - 12 in total. On most of those trips I fished mainly for sustenance not for sport. The biggest exception to that being the large northern brook trout rivers like the Asheweig, Frog and Fawn. I fished hard on those waters. Beyond that it's impossible for a single guy in a canoe to fish a body of water thoroughly and effectively. It's far easier to concentrate on fishing and put more fish in the boat when you're in a Lund. As far as every trip being the greatest ever, well I've only ever actually said that about North Caribou. Every trip I've been on in recent years has been great though, photos and video don't lie. My entire life has revolved around the sport of fishing and over the years it has evolved. I no longer paddle anymore because I have a wife, kids and a mortgage. However I've managed to live my life in a way where I still get to experience world class angling - and finally - much to my wife's delight - I'm actually making some money at it in the process! I'm not a rich man and never will be, but then I've always valued experiences far more than things and in that respect I am rich. Everyone I believe is the master of their own destiny. Sorry about the thread derailment."
3632634,chris.brock,2015-03-09 20:44:00,112,"Mike has helped a lot of people, me included, and doesn't expect anything in return. I don't know why you're spewing this garbage. At outposts, we leave food and supplies at the end of the week, we eat food others have left if it looks appetizing. I was at Eddie's Beteau camp a few years ago, mid summer, and the chest freezer was full of food people left behind. The stuff we leave behind, I would be happy if a paddler used it. I know how deprived of luxuries a paddler is. As a canoeist, it's a huge score being 6 days out, and finding a can of pop, a bag of chips, or better yet, a king can."
3632698,forgop,2015-03-09 20:59:00,880,"Mike-I think your record speaks for itself. Who are we to believe-the guy who posts under his real identity, provides reports with some insight into his personal life, helps secure discounted bookings, and gives marked up maps or the anonymous bitter/angry troll with weak bait?"
3632738,youngknight,2015-03-09 21:20:00,228,"Two things. 1. Not so much a guest left behind but my dads buddy did a fly in moose hunt one year and in the middle of nowhere came across an outhouse sitting perfectly upright....other side of the lake half a mile in the bush. Found out later it was being flown in by a helicopter which started having some difficulties so they cut it loose close to the tree tops. 2. I love reviewing some of these threads on WC. However, personal attacks have no place here. Lots of comment boards for that type of thing...not here, and especially not on someone who has been incredibly helpful in a wide variety of advice topics and great stories, photos, videos...and someone who is obviously very dedicated to his family including them from a young age, multiple times on some of his adventures as well as his father. Having a difference of opinion on a subject does not justify such wanton personal and undeserved attacks."
3632778,Draco1206,2015-03-09 21:41:00,175,"Yes, thank you for the map. Doesn't mean I have to agree with all your cheap shots at someone I respect and has done nothing but provide great advice, trip reports, and help to anyone that asks. Don't know or care what your history is with Mike Borger but this is not the first time you've taken shots at him on WC. If you don't like him, fine, but stop with the cheap shots. It's like you're in some kind of competition with him. Seems a bit childish. If you ever need any help with any lakes I've been to I would be happy to help you out in return."
3632786,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-03-09 21:42:00,358,Mr. Borger promptly answered a PM from me asking about an outpost. He was extremely generous with his info and is a credit to Walleye Central.

Come on Borger........come clean! Show me the sasquatch and I'll reveal the fish that wanted to eat me... To maintain thread integrity I will say I've never been to an outpost cabin, but have been to a trappers cabin. I left my name in the log book on the table......."

To the best of my knowledge I've only ever talked about the sasquatch stuff on my own website which is ironic considering the circumstances how topic was raised here. If anyone wants to read about it, it's right here. I'm a believer - I think LOL!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...igfoot-exists/"

3631202,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 14:57:00,1554,"Funny but true Bill. I hate KD, the last time I ate it was a box I found in one of the vacant outpost camps. Disgusting, vile goo LOL! Most memorable stash of food I ever stumbled across was in a cabin on Felsia Lake. It was vacant but there was plates on the table with fried chicken on them and the fridge was full of perishables but not running. It literally looked as though the plane came in and this group just got up and left without lifting a finger. Searching about some more I found a note in magic marker scrawled on the wall dated two days before I showed up. Without naming names it was a very well known fishing personality and his film crew who had left the mess LOL! Everything was rotten so I cleaned out the cabin and fridge and got rid of the garbage. Was able to snag a 1/2 bottle of Crown Royal and some pancake mix for my troubles though."

3632098,Draco1206,2015-03-09 18:47:00,175,"Hey Mike, sounds like a bit of envy or jealousy on someones part. The thing is you always have the photos to show how good your trips are (unless you spend a whole lot of time photo shopping, lol). You do live the life that most of can only dream of, and sometimes it's hard to admit that there are better fishermen out there that seem to catch more and bigger fish than the rest of us. Anyways I appreciate your stories and your positive outlook on life in general. I've never heard of you turning away anyone that has asked for info or help concerning lakes or outfitters. Keep up the good work. As far as the OP, someone once left their camera at one of the camps we went to. But from my experience, the pilots are the first to go through the cabins and grab any leftovers. Any beer,pop,chips, and unopened goods are usually taken while we're unpacking. I'm with SinOrSwim on everything else, we just throw it out to make room for our stuff. Can't believe people actually think they are doing us a favor by leaving food."
3632114,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 18:53:00,1554,Thank you
3632474,tooski,2015-03-09 20:10:00,393,"Draco, Aren't you in the group (with Rocko) that I sent the marked Windsor map to?"
3632506,Ebarnett,2015-03-09 20:18:00,60,"Sounds like some Anglers are pissed the lakes are still frozen? Maybe be in a better disposition when you can get a line in? Anyway if Mike ever wrote a book, I would buy it! To live in the bush and travel and fish the water he has fished is something very few people get to experience. As far as having the best fishing of his life on awesome lakes of late, I believe it. I'm a much better fisherman now than 25 years ago when I was a teen. Fishing out of boats with electronics vs canoes with paddles probably has helped his numbers as well. From Poles to lures to line, fishing is easier, more effective today than it was 20 years ago. Just my humble opinion."
3632522,tooski,2015-03-09 20:22:00,393,Well thank you- at least someone had a sensible reply.
3630650,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 12:08:00,1554,"I was wondering if you guys even knew about that. Your ""package"" sat on the table the entire time we were there, everyone in my group thought it belonged to one of us. We only realized on the last morning as we were packing to go. FWIW we left it there for the next group LOL!"
3630690,tooski,2015-03-09 12:14:00,393,"Mr Simon- outfitters that don't welcome canoers. ""I can .... just about anyone who owns an outpost in the North. "" Well here's one off the top of my head, Shane Looby of Shooting Star Camps on the Spanish River. He is the one who explained the term ""river rats"". No doubt there are others."
3630722,tooski,2015-03-09 12:24:00,393,"Borger, Please let us know when you publish your book. Will it be a comedy or Fairy Tales? Start with your tales of Bigfoot sightings, chasing off polar bears, killing ground hogs by throwing stones, eating old beans off of rocks, etc.. Maybe in chapter two you can explain the fact that you paddled remote Ontario rivers for years but in six straight outpost trips you have had the ""best fishing"" of your life. You are very fortunate that every lake you fish is better than the last. And I make you laugh?"
3630738,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 12:31:00,1554,"You're a gem, and yes you're making me laugh. Not sure exactly where this is coming from and why and frankly I don't care. Like I said before have a nice day."
3630818,SinOrSwim,2015-03-09 13:02:00,1528,"Good thing our group wasn't there between your trips. We throw the bulk of the left over stuff away. At least the refrigerator stuff. We won't throw away non perishables but we always thought it was kind of rude to leave the frig stocked with crap. Maybe we are strange, but I'm not eating anything that has been opened and I have no idea where it has been or where it came from. I'm not drinking the booze either. Even simple stuff like pancake mix. I have no idea how many mice have been inside that box. Some think leaving all that stuff is helping the next guy out but sometimes it just increases the amount of time we have to clean junk up to make room for what we brought. We always went in late august or September. Sometimes there was crap everywhere. Half rolls of TP, old food, a bazillion salt and peppers etc."
3630866,tooski,2015-03-09 13:16:00,393,"123 Chadder, You are correct it would have been silly to expect it to be there for 3 weeks with other groups coming in. Since it was Richters first year open Eddie did not have the time between my trips booked, thus we left things."
3631010,Blue Lk,2015-03-09 13:56:00,269,"Not every remote cabin in NWO belongs to an outfitter,there are lots of trappers shacks spread throughout the country.I'm sure these guys leave ""stuff"" for return trips. Imho anything removed from these shacks would be theft."
3631018,forgop,2015-03-09 13:57:00,880,It was good. Thanks for leaving it behind. Mike and I enjoyed it a great deal on one of our once in a lifetime canoe trips.
3631066,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 14:08:00,1554,Agreed 100%!
3631170,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-09 14:44:00,1460,"So true! The only things we leave behind for the following group would be a few eggs or unopened milk, something like that, otherwise, we either pack it out or send it out with the guts. It is a long held tradition to leave camps unlocked with at least a smattering of foodstuffs over the winter off-season. I think half of the worlds stock of Kraft macaroni and cheese sits in outposts across NW Ontario."
3630050,v-bay gord,2015-03-09 09:23:00,3168,I think cabins are left unlocked for that reason and the only rule is to leave it in the same shape you found it. Things are a bit more casual here in the back woods.
3630186,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 09:59:00,1554,"I wasn't stealing from anyone LOL!Perhaps ""huge quantities"" was a poor choice of words.I'm talking left over dry goods like a box or two of Kraft Dinner, half a jar of peanut butter, some leftover pancake mix, etc, etc...Pretty much every single trip I've ever been on we've left a few sundries behind in the cabin as most groups do.This leftover food is neither expected or counted upon by the either the outfitter or any new party visiting the camp.What I didn't say was I also visited a great many fly in lodges in my solo travels. Each and every one of them was incredibly gracious and nice always giving me plenty of dry goods to help restock my pantry at zero cost. Regarding the other two comments about a book, I'm thinking about it.Cheers"
3630362,tooski,2015-03-09 11:11:00,393,"""This leftover food is neither expected or counted upon by the either the outfitter or any new party visiting the camp"" Really? I took our guy trip to Eddie's Richter Lake two years ago and three weeks later I took my family to the same lake. We left a lot of food items and expected them there on our return. Can't think of anyone that appreciates river rats scavenging their outposts...."
3630474,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 11:34:00,1554,"Thanks for your input, at the very least it made me laugh.Have a great day"

3630530,MrSimon,2015-03-09 11:47:00,922,"I can .... just about anyone who owns an outpost in the North. I think its kind of an unwritten rule that true back country cabins have an open door policy .... a lone adventurer who is well off the beaten path is welcome to take shelter and a few provisions if needed, as long as they are respectful. With that said, there is a big difference between spending the night and eating some old peanut butter .... and ""scavenging""."
3630538,KSjim,2015-03-09 11:48:00,88,"I realize this is in the grey area of right and wrong, hopefully it will not be judged too harshly.One year Uncle Bob ( I bet a lot of groups have an Uncle B) found an ""antique potato masher"" he had to have. Not sure how he discovered it because while he was excellent at cleaning fish he did not cook or wash dishes. As the leader of the group I put my foot down and told him he could not take it home with him.The very next year we fly into the outpost, begin to unpack and Uncle B takes out of his bag two potato mashers and promptly swaps them for his treasure. We just all shock our heads and added yet another Uncle B story to our collection."
3630546,123chadder,2015-03-09 11:49:00,429,"if you expected it on your return you should have maybe left a note....to absolutely expect that food to be there is a tad silly most people dont want the bother of taking it back out.... when remote,plan for the worst hope for the best"
3630586,123chadder,2015-03-09 11:53:00,429,"to take the only tool is wrong,i wouldnt let that happen either... i myself wouldnt be bothered by a swap of utensils unless that antique is valuable...then id have a problem,,,, what was so special about this masher?"
3630610,MrSimon,2015-03-09 12:02:00,922,"Last trip we found, and very much appreciated, a pile of clean and folded dish towels. We didn't bring any and they came in incredibly handy. We always leave any unused paper products, trash bags, etc. I think its only a good idea to leave perishable or opened food if you are certain a group is coming in right after you."

Someone had a shore lunch on the smooth granite rock at the base of the falls and dumped out what looked like an entire pot of beans onto the rock. I was almost 2 months into my trip at that point and while I wasn't starving to death I was pretty hungry. I gave those beans a good sniff test then tried a tiny bite, then in less than 2 minutes gobbled up the entire pile LOL!"

In his words ""I thought they tasted like crap! Thought it was some kind weird hippy granola!!!"" Then he popped another one in his mouth and ate it. LOL!"

3629841,jcd,2015-03-09 08:41:00,185,This reminds me about something got left happened years ago at a drive-in camp. We had been at the camp for a couple of days when a TAXI CAB drove in with the cab driver (assume he owned the cab) and his buddy/passenger (???). For the next couple of days they stayed in a cabin and fished out of rental boat. The next morning we were getting ready to go out on the lake we noticed that the CAB was gone. Later in the day when we got back to camp we asked the camp owner what happened to the cab. He laughed and said there was a misunderstanding or confrontation between the two and the cab driver took off during the night and left the other fellow at camp to fend for himself. The camp owner had to take the stranded fellow 20+miles to town to wait for a bus to get back home.
3621874,milford72,2015-03-06 19:33:00,13,"I think it's a lot of fun to get to a remote camp and see what people have left. There are always various fishing lures hanging on the wall or windows. Sometimes ,there are salted minnows or crawlers that are usable. The kitchen is always interesting with the different spices and canned goods. I always try to leave one of my favorite lures. How about you,do you leave anything? What have you found? Any surprises?"

I always checked them to see what was left behind.Almost all of them had huge quantities of leftover food and booze. I lived for weeks on end with food that I scavenged from those camps. Strangest thing I found was someone's last will and testament sitting on the kitchen table with references to this being his last fishing trip, etc, etc...Funniest thing I found was blow up sex dolls tucked into each bed in the outpost (there was 6 beds). LOL!"

One year on a fly-in trip he brought a fresh bucket filled with toilet paper, we were staying in a rustic cabin, so he used his bucket daily. As we were packing up to leave, he gave it a good ""swish"" rinse and left it behind. We have had many a good laugh about what Jacque the camp handyman is using the bucket for now!"
