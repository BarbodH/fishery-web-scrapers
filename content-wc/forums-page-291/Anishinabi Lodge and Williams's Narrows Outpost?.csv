I've seen the website but can't find any other info. http://www.anishinabilodge.com/ontariooutpostcabins.htm The fishing sounds great on the website and the cabin looks better than any other place I've ever stayed but I had some other questions: We want the drive in option, how is the ATV ride? How is the access to other lake? How was the fishing on Anishinabi lake? Is there any specific points on the lake or other 13 lakes that hold good fish? Anything else I missed that might make the trip more successful?"

I'm in the same boat as you were looking for more info as well except we have booked for the first week of June. None of us have ever been there before."

I didn't catch anything but one guy in our group had a hot Jurgens hump back lure and caught several lakers trolling. Anishinabi is super clear so the fish clearly see you. It is a beautiful lake. Have fun!"

3358082,itsme,2014-12-10 16:53:00,31,"Is that Tommy Williams formerly of Wine Lake? How do you get to the lake Anishnobi now? I used to portage the Halverston river after crossing Wabasking (sp) up the Wine river and did sleep one night in a ""Rustic Cabin"" located on a small point of land at the beginning of the lake. Another time Tommy, my wife and I portaged up a steep hill into three lakes after crossing Anishnabi. We caught lots of small walleyes. When Tommy decided it was time for lunch he filleted several...throwing all of them on the shore for the birds to eat.... Wormy he said. And they were. The bay just ahead of the main body of Anishnabi is about 30 ft deep, clear spring feed water and beautiful ferns on the bottom where 40"" Northers lay ripe for the picking. Its the purist water. Thanks for the memories that this message helped to bring back. Itsme says Hello to Tom. He is a great guy who lost a foot on a logging truck unloading problem. That didn't stop him from building great cabins including a super lodge."
