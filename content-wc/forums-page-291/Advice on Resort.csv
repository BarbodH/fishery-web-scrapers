The best results I've seen come when fishing is combined with other activities that the kids might enjoy......it can be as simple as a campfire or swimming. Anything that can break up the fishing, especially if the ""bite"" slows down. Most lodges have a stock of board games, which are a bit retro for today's generation, but could be interesting. I'm still not a fan of a ""games room"" (sounds too organized for my crusty personality) but to each his own. Having fun is the priority."
3607082,MrSimon,2015-03-03 11:20:00,922,"One of the BEST ways to make memories with kids while out fishing in Canada is to pull up on a random shore or island and go ""adventuring"" as my kids call it. Look for stuff, go hiking, collect fire wood, build a fire on the shore, have a meal, swim, build a fort .... whatever. I go to Canada for the fishing, but oddly enough most of the best memories don't involve catching a fish."
3607178,gulfer001,2015-03-03 11:52:00,14,If you are open to a fly-in than take a good look at Fletcher Lake Lodge. It is roughly 50-80 miles north of Kenora with awesome fishing. One of the benefits with kids is that there are plenty of great fishing spots close to the resort so you don't have long runs. They are also the only resort on the lake which is nice. http://www.fletcherlake.com
3624666,zeebee,2015-03-07 15:59:00,1144,"I hear you.....years ago when the kids were younger my 8 yr old came in to the cabin at Press Lake Camp with bleedin battle scars from trying to pry a 36"" Garter snake from under the cabin. Ten min later my 5 year old came in draggin the snake with a neck press grip ..snake still had his brother's crimson blood staining its mouth. No video game can replicate that experience. Boys gotta be boys."
3629241,Kevin R,2015-03-09 06:00:00,305,Yes agreed & Gord has very nice view of the water from his Awesome Lodge. I would put Gords place on your list. Gord is very nice guy with top notch fishing techniques he should be able to help you with plenty of fish action.
3605026,WalleyeMatt,2015-03-02 17:53:00,93,"Make sure they have at least a 30,000 acre swimming pool and 500,000 acre back yard and play area. My family has a great time with these, my son won't even look for the game room. Matt"

3606226,youngknight,2015-03-03 07:59:00,228,"The OP asked about stuff for kids to do - not all that into fishing - in case of bad weather..having a game room - darts/pool table - isn't the worst thing in the world on a rainy day. (I assume we are not talking video games - if so then I echo the poo pooing of the game room). My 13 year old son and I flew into a remote lake out of Cochrane last July for 6 days...2 days we fished for less than an hour, two days less than 4...major rain, howling wind, lightning storms. Yeah, we played cards and read in the little cabin but we were holed up for way too long....would have been nice to have some attractions...the sharp stick and some matches is great when it isn't storming outside. In the end, the OP wants to have a positive vacation for the kids - lots of outside, fishing, boating - maybe doing something else when it is pouring rain out."
3606290,Stu,2015-03-03 08:14:00,472,"LoDo, have you ever fished with kids? One of the most important things to remember is to make it fun for them. When I first started taking my son to Canada, we only stayed out for about an hour or two, and then we went back to the cabin and let him play. Sptrix specifically stated that he was the only real fisherman in the group and that he was looking for a lodge with some amenities to provide diversions for the boys. Perhaps you didn't fully read his original post (?) I commend him for understanding that boys will be boys and placing their needs in front of his will help to insure that they have a fun trip and will want to come back."
3606338,LOW1,2015-03-03 08:20:00,2828,"The OP is wise to keep his options open. Maybe the kids will want to fish 14 hours daily and there will be good weather - if so, fish, fish, fish.But maybe the kids will want to do something else. In my experience the worst thing to do is to force kids to fish.If you stay within an hour or so of Kenora you can use the indoor pool which it has-this has been a real benefit to us when the kids get squirelly or the weather is bad. Call ahead for times, because the pool can have some complicated hours. There is also a movie theater in Kenora.Kids enjoy Rushing River Provincial Park, as it is a natural waterparkThere are hiking trails in the Sioux Narrows-Rushing River -Kenora corridor, which are good for keeping kids busy and tiring them out.Some resorts cater more to families than others, so look for one that offers kayaks, a beach, etc. In my experience, people like the OP who are looking for a family vacation with fishing only a part of the experience are becoming more and more common, as compared to the exclusive fishing trips of days gone by. This is a great way for the local economy to expand."
3606490,Blue Lk,2015-03-03 08:48:00,269,"Blue Lk provincial park is just down the road & has lots of hiking trails,great beach & there is a trail between Indian lk & Blue lk that leads to some great diving rocks."
3606594,sptrix,2015-03-03 09:14:00,175,"Thanks to everyone who responded. Those who understand that the goal of this trip is to inspire kids to love to fish -- thank you. I can fish 15 hours a day, and I do when I take my trips to Manitoba. But forcing kids to do that is a surefire way to get them to dislike fishing, IMO. The diversions are simply a way to provide another source of something to do if the weather is bad. ****, there's only so much cribbage I can play when we encounter terrible weather on my ""grown up"" trip, too, which is probably why I've fished in too much bad weather over the years. If the boys end up wanting to fish 4, 6, 8, 10 hours a day, great. If not, I just want them to enjoy the trip so that they want to do it again. Finding a place that is known for cooperative fish (regardless of species or size) and a resort that is nice enough to have a few amenities, to me, is the best way to ensure they ask the most important question: ""Can we do this again?"" I'll check into all of the places you mentioned. Thanks again. And keep the advice coming. SPTRIX"
3606754,Larbo,2015-03-03 09:53:00,231,I would do what ever you need to do so they want to come back and do it again and again. Maybe they will eventually bring there own children...
3600418,sptrix,2015-03-01 14:33:00,175,"I live in the Twin Cities and have spent the last 20 years fishing in northern Manitoba. My son is old enough to go on an easier trip, and I have a friend who would also like to take his son along. I'm the only real fisherman in the group. Here's what I'm looking for:* something close to the border * a body of water that has a lot of action -- I don't care if we get trophies (walleyes, pike or bass -- even big crappies are fine)* good, or at least decent, rental boats* if it's not a fly-in, then someplace that may have some additional amenities or is near a town that may have some diversions for the boys in the event of bad weather* mid-range pricing* we'll probably only go for 3 or 4 nightsAny suggestions for specific resorts?Thanks,Steve"
