I fished the chain lakes that are connected to the north of it last year and they produced some really nice fish for being small lakes. The channel connecting to Lake McKay was blocked and we couldn't get there but all the locals said it was great fishing. Has anyone fished it? I have been curious to know what its like since we were so close but couldn't get there and it looks pretty remote. If it was anything like the smaller chains I bet its awesome!"

There was a way to drive right to the lake and there was a couple camper trailers parked there. I did pretty good. Big lake. Clearer water than is typical for the area. The locals who know the lake better than I did, do well."
