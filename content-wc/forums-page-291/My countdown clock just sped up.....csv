3628841,rnnonmt,2015-03-08 22:01:00,992,Man I wish I could go more than once a year. Arizona is just too far away.
3621218,SinOrSwim,2015-03-06 15:40:00,1528,sent my deposit in today for trip #2 in late June/early July. No waiting til September now. I hope my wife gets used to this two trip per year stuff. Because I certainly am.
3621426,stjoeguy,2015-03-06 16:53:00,979,"I fished in Canada twice last year for the first time. Thanks IaDave. This year I got a full season Ontario license in hopes of a fall trip again as well as the usual June trip. You're right about the hardest part being convincing the wife that the 2nd trip is ""necessary"". Good luck with that. I'm using the ""I'm not getting any younger"" argument."
3621786,Live to jig,2015-03-06 19:08:00,159,"I'm with you guys, I have the annual trip with the guys the last week of June and then talked the wife into going back the last week of July, going to do my best to make sure she has the time of her life ...maybe there will be 2 trips every year in my future!"
3622266,Bayou,2015-03-06 23:02:00,52,"I'm doing two trips also, one with the guys then going to do a family trip. I hope I can hook them for future two trips a year. I'm also getting trips lined up for next year, booked a goat hunt next year in BC. Come on lotto!!!!!!"
3622890,Babamel2,2015-03-07 07:00:00,414,"My wife almost drowned once and is afraid of water. She went with me one year, just so she would not have to be home alone. She made me promise that if she wanted to go back to the cabin, regardless how far from the cabin we were. After a few days of fishing, she started making comments like ""Next year when we come ..."". By the end of the week the comments became ""Some year we could come for more than one week"" We have been going twice ever since. Hope it goes like that for you"
3622898,forgop,2015-03-07 07:00:00,880,"I'm contemplating 2 trips next year. I've only been to 2 different camps. Part of me wants to revisit the camps we went to the prior 2 trips, but part of me wants to explore new territory."
3622978,Fisherman Ted,2015-03-07 07:09:00,461,"I decided to say the **** with the wife, I'm going for the entire summer. This started a few years ago. So far so good -FT"
3623114,Bill Krejca,2015-03-07 07:36:00,6107,Atta boy!
3623898,wallydave,2015-03-07 11:55:00,2151,"I know how you feel! There is something about fishing familiar waters, and also the adventure of new lakes. Try one of each! Good luck!"
3624642,bobbylfishermon,2015-03-07 15:56:00,241,"The wife and I go for 2 weeks in the spring and 2weeks in the fall, she'll fish in any thing or any weather that I will. I knew when I married her she liked the water, I had a ski boat, but she took to fishing , like a duck to water. Talk about a lucky man and I'll admit it!!!! It doesn't hurt she has a 47 in. musky and a 12lb. wally to her credit and carries the pictures on her phone!! She""lets"" me go solo a trip or two also since I retired!! Life is good!!!"
