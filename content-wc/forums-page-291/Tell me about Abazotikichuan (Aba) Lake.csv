It's a very rustic camp located on the Albany, upstream of Makokitoban Lake and Washi Lake. Has anyone been there, and if so, how was the fishing?"
3638714,Pymbet,2015-03-11 11:41:00,42,"Rocko, We have been to Aba twice, once in the late-1980s and once in early 2000s. The camp was rustic then (no running water) but functional. I don't know the current status of the camp, but it may be the same. We have been to six of Leuenberger's lakes and we rate this as one of the best for fishing. When we reminisce on all of our trips, we put Aba at about #4 or #5 out of about 20 (and the top three were all on the Attawapiskat). There is a pretty long stretch of the Albany that is fishable from Aba in higher water, all the way up to a place called Frenchman's Rapids. At very low water, all of river may not be navigable (depending on your guts and skill boating through some rocks), but that is not a big deal because there is a lot of water in Aba itself and in the shorter stretches of river that are easily reachable in low water. There are several good walleye holes in Aba and along the Albany and also good pike fishing in the slacker water. We noticed guides out of Makok taking guests up the Albany through Aba, so you may see a few boats pass by once or twice. Guessing they were headed towards Frenchman's Rapids which was on of the hotter walleye holes. If you are considering Aba for a trip, I think you would enjoy it."
3638746,Mike Borger,2015-03-11 11:51:00,1554,I camped on it and can tell you it's a very beautiful part of the river.Have heard from other people who visited the outpost that the fishing is great as well.
3639194,Lovetofish,2015-03-11 14:12:00,458,Cool picture's of the Frenchman's Rapids on Google Earth. Wonder what they looked like last year with the high water?
3639466,Pymbet,2015-03-11 15:50:00,42,We saw them in pretty high water (the dock at the camp was mainly underwater that week) and they were very impressive. Not even a thought that we would go up them. I have Googled around a little and have seen some photos of a canoe group running them. Also once found an on-line evaluation to generate hydro power at the Frenchman's Rapids (hopefully only an engineers dream).
3640178,Ruddiger,2015-03-11 19:22:00,649,"Howdy,Before I get started please know I am sharing an honest opinion of my experience with this operator and your mileage may vary.I stayed with Leuenberger's back in 2002 on a different fly in lake than the one your mentioning. Our trip was in May and was for walleye and pike. It was by far the worst operation I have ever stayed at.Please know that I spend 5-6 weeks in Canada a year and have done a lot of rustic fly-ins. I am not a hotel snob and would sleep in a tool shed if the fishing was great. In other words this was not my first rodeo. Unfortunately it was the filthiest cabin I ever stayed in. On top of the sheer filth, the freezer door was held in place with duct tape, the cabin floor was caked in cooking oil, a huge pile of discarded wood chips and debris was dumped in the corner, the counters looked like they had been cleaned as often as a gas station bathroom, the mattresses in one room smelled like pee, the entire area around the outside of the cabin was littered with discarded furniture and the outhouse had a huge hole chewed into the rotting wooden wall that someone tried to unsuccessfully cover with clear plastic. But the best part had to be the hundreds of mice that we shared the two bedroom cabin with. Their feces were everywhere, and once the lights were out there were so many of them scurrying around that it sounded like a group of preschoolers rolling a dozen matchbox cars on the floor all night long. They were so thick you would see them climbing up the walls....literally.As I stated earlier, I can put up with a lot if the fishing was good. Unfortunately is was very mediocre and the lake was way too small for a weeks stay. I've been to other outposts camps where you were the only cabin on the lake and this location was definitely over sold. Furthermore, it was obvious the owners couldn't care less about the condition the cabins were left in by previous guests and made no attempt to maintain them. Believe me when I say these conditions were so bad that it was obviously years in the making and not the results of inconsiderate parties from the weeks before. There are a lot of great places to stay in Canada and you have a lot of great choices. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine. That said, I'll stick with Expeditions-North at Nagagami as my prospecting days are over when it comes to trying to find anything better than Nagagami.Take care,RuddigerPs-I just checked their website and the cabin I stayed in was ""Samuelson"""
3640650,phishfearme,2015-03-11 22:50:00,1242,"we were at aba in 1993 - first and last time. there are two cabins on the lake - ours was with Nakina outposts and was where the opiciuan river comes into aba. the leuenberger cabin is further east on the lake more where the Albany river comes in and out. our cabin was VERY rustic but livable - the other cabin was unlivable at the time - the floor was caved in - probably repaired by now if they're listing it. cabins were poor but fishing was quite good - better towards the Albany but where the opiciuan river comes in was also quite good. get ready for HUGE water level changes - 8 - 10 vertical feet is not uncommon. as a result, getting up the river can be a challenge but getting into a hole - especially around Frenchman's rapids can produce excellent catches. recall seeing two natives fly by us at Frenchman's and blast up river with the motor smashing rock after rock. how they made it up without killing the motor is a miracle. as always - ask the outfitter for names of people who were there last year. phish"
3640658,chris.brock,2015-03-11 22:54:00,112,"Gotta chime in on this one. 1st, the bad news. I'm pretty sure Leuenberger isn't offering Aba. It's a long expensive flight and when the natives stole the front door off the cabin, Malcolm called it quits for Aba. My group doesn't mind very rustic cabins. That said, I think Leuenberger's is a great outfitter, IMO. The Aba cabin was rough, and after a few drinks, the slope of the floor made for some funny stories. Been to Aba twice. The epitome of a fly in fishing trip IMO. To have a huge, awesome section of the Albany River all to your self, Frenchman's, the Opichuan inflow, it's a magical spot. I hope to get back there someday."
3641066,rocko0305,2015-03-12 06:40:00,138,"Thanks everyone for all the info an replies. I really appreciate it. This forum has been great for getting info about certain lakes that just seem hard to find trip reports about. I was thinking about posting a few more new threads to ask about some lakes that I would like to know more about, so be on the lookout. Our group has been to many of the Leuenberger lakes, but Aba was one that I had never heard much about. I don't necessarily think we would be looking to go there, based on the fact that is a little smaller compared to the lakes we typically like to fish, and that it looks and sounds to be mostly river fishing. The comment about the water levels fluctuating so quickly would likely rule it out for us too. While some of the Leuenberger outposts are more rustic than others, we have never had an issue really with the cabins. I am surprised to hear about the story about Samuelson. I guess it's a good thing we've never gone there. The most rustic cabin I have ever been to was this past year at Washi, and I already can't wait to go back there. Thanks again."
3641314,chris.brock,2015-03-12 07:30:00,112,"Just curious, has anyone asked Leuenbergers if they are using the Aba camp again this year?"
3641138,Pymbet,2015-03-12 06:51:00,42,"Got to chime back in too. I think the lifeblood of these types of boards is honest opinions about the pros and cons of the subject at hand. But to respond to Ruddiger (and provide a counter opinion), my brother and I and various buddies and kids have been with Leuenbergers about eight times and always have had great experiences. While this originally was an Aba question, we were at Samuelson on my first trip ever to Canada (I was 24, now 52 so figure out how long ago that was). We didn't know what to expect and were very green walleye fisherman, but had solid fishing and a great time. And my single best fishing memory comes from Samuelson (catching my first really big northern by myself, with no net man). Also, I will agree that it was a pretty Spartan cabin at the time, but I just checked the Leuenberger website and see that the cabin has been re-done since I was there and now has running water. So that part of the criticism seems like it may be moot. I also saw that the Aba cabin is the same as it has been for years, also what I consider pretty basic, but that Leuenbergers is pretty clear about the type of camp on that lake. Finally, Samuelson is a smaller lake (which I think should be pretty obvious from looking at a map when you book your trip????), but that fits some groups fine, and maybe it was perfect for us as first timers. Finally to clarify, I have no skin in this game (Malcolm and Ernie don't know me from Adam) and we have not been with Leuenbergers for a few years."
