3627337,LoDo,2015-03-08 13:54:00,721,"I've been going to a cabin in Woodland Caribou Prov Park for several years. The cabin(s) were purchased 10-12 years ago from americans. Essentially the compound has been owned by americans for several decades. I'm curious how real estate works in Canada and Ontario. I realize in my scenario a group of americans purchased from another american family. My question is can americans purchase from Canadians? Is real estate in Ontario available to americans? Whats the process? Thank you,"
3628073,bthomas3333,2015-03-08 18:16:00,465,"I did some research on the same topic a few years back when a share of a cabin was offered to me. In the end I turned it down as I didn't want to spend my vacation doing a ton of maint work. The place needed a new roof / outhouse / structural work. Once I did the math on the repairs / improvements vs paying for my own trips...I could do two fly ins for the next 20+ years for the cost of the purchase. Obviously I would have an asset at the end, but I am not really looking to invest in a Canadian vacation property.RE: The park probably adds a slightly different dimension. In some cases the govt has threatened to kick out private cabin owners by buying them out(20+ years ago)...think about the $$$$ to do that...I think that calmed down because of the sheer cost but in general foreign ownership is not limited in ON. I think some of the Provinces have a few limitations (under 5 acres) but not ON.The mortgage process is similar to the US, but expect a 35% down payment and perhaps a shorter 15 year term. I am pretty sure they said I would need to use a Canadian bank to source the mortgage.Basically, I'd use a real estate professional to help you understand any park restrictions. Then I would do some soul searching on the cost vs the benefit. Always thought it would be ultra cool until I did some math and looked at the work.B-"
3628281,LOW1,2015-03-08 19:23:00,2828,"Yes, Americans can purchase land from Canadians or anyone else and hold it just like Canadians.Where the property is at will determine what sort (if any) of zoning or other restrictions are on the property. Some cabins that are owned are located on leased land and you will need to determine if you have any interest in that sort of arrangement.Buying land in a park will add another layer of regulations, just like it would in the US. The local MNR folks may have more info.The government (a/k/a ""The Crown"") may own a strip of land surrounding the lake which is referred to as the shoreline reserve. Over the years some of these have been purchased by the lot owner, others have not.Property taxes are paid much like they are in the US, although there are two half installments but you pay three times per year. (Don't try to figure it out, just pay as you are billed) Property insurance is available to Americans through local agents.You should use a local real estate attorney. Realtors are also helpful in giving you some ideas and options. The closing process is similar. Funds are deposited with the attorney or other closing agent. The attorney verifies title, pays off any liens, and records the title documents. When selling, the seller does not immediately get all the sale proceeds but instead has to go through a tax clearance process. And there may be estate taxes owed in Canada upon the owner's death depending on whether this is treated as the primary residence, whether it's jointly owned with a spouse, etc.You will want to confirm that you have suitable access to the cabin and are not trespassing across Crown Land to get there. Also, you will want to do the usual cabin inspection. Pay special attention to the foundation/support system, the roof, and the septic system as these can be pricey to replace. Where you are at will impact your ability to find local carpenters, electricians, etc andthe cost of the same. Sometimes that is not easy or cheap.Canadians are very used to the idea of Americans owning property in Canada."
3628369,Fisherman Ted,2015-03-08 19:43:00,461,By all means if you want to buy a piece of heaven go for it! Its the same thought process (and decision tree) as any other vacation property. From ski chalet to beach house. Just in Canada.
3628753,LoDo,2015-03-08 21:24:00,721,"Thanks all! Sorry if I was implying the purchase of the cottage in Woodland Caribou. Not happening. I was more interested if americans can even purchase in Ontario. Sure, we can purchase in Mexico, although you are risking their government taking it from you. I've only read this has happened. No personal experience. Are many americans purchasing in southern Canada? Most lakes in MN and WI don't have lake front vacancy as they have already been developed. Several of the MN and WI lakes have been fished out and the lakes hold more recreational sports like, jet skiing, wave runners, water skiing, etc... Are Canadians seeing more and more americans purchasing cottages in southern Canada? Theres so much undeveloped land and water I'm curious as to where the Canadian government stands with the idea of development? Thanks again,"
3629193,Shellback,2015-03-09 05:39:00,8083,"Canadians can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think housing in Canada has slacked off in value similar to our experiences we had here in the states. Not nearly as bad, but there has been a devaluation. If placing a value on the property, I wouldn't use figures from a few years ago. A camp a friend used was listed at 1.5 million three years ago, (yea, they were dreaming). It just sold for shy of $700,000. Bet they wished they had set the figure at 1 million 3 years ago. They would likely have got it then."
3629353,SinOrSwim,2015-03-09 06:47:00,1528,"I think the key would be to purchase a property with a group of investors? Treat it as a time share of sorts. For me, the amount of time I could spend at the property would be severely limited. But, with 3 boys taking them all to Canada on an annual basis could get very expensive. I have toyed with the idea of finding a property and a group to invest. Flip side is there are so many other things to factor in. You would have to have all your own.....everything. The maintenance and upkeep of the cabin, boat/motor, dock, yard etc. We actually looked at one that had a small guest cabin. The thought was you could find someone to live in that during the summer to help maintain the property and the main cabin would still be open for the families to stay. Like anything else, it all comes with a cost. Whether that be an actual cost or the work and time it takes to deal with everything. Anotehr key would be having access to a local that could deal with more urgent issues. I have a handyman that helps me with a rental property. It is a life saver sometimes."
3629489,Skywagon,2015-03-09 07:15:00,1106,"Most of the land in North-West Ontario (north of MN) is owned by the Government (Crown). Fortunately the Government does not have any inclination at this time to develop any more land, sell-lease lakefront.(if they did it would be more like MN and Wis). It is very difficult, if not impossible to subdivide property also (another good thing in my opinion). As far an American buying property here, that is not a problem, no restrictions to speak of."
3629601,bthomas3333,2015-03-09 07:46:00,465,The idea of sharing a property on the surface sounds good. My best friend inherited a share of an island that three buddies purchased in the 1960s. The issue has become resources and the split ownership. Owning a third of an island with associated maintenance costs can be challenging. (i.e. One guy wanting new motors the other two not...then does he have to purchase them himself...live with the old motors...flyin his personal motor every year???) (New roof...two want it one doesn't...aka can't afford it...they can't fix the roof until he has resources or they fix it and split it two ways???). Just gets ugly. Maybe if the owners all put up a large maintenance fund at closing would fix it???? Don't know just know this situation has gotten ugly.It is messy to try split ownership with different pocketbooks and values.b-
3630042,LoDo,2015-03-09 09:22:00,721,"The cabins in Woodland Caribou are split between 6 pockets. There are a total of three cabins. One of the cabins sleeps the full-time caretaker(s) that stay at camp. The caretaker(s) are split between two 6 week trips. The caretakers help with boat maintenance, yard care, linens, handyman type scenarios, etc... The caretakers work half the day and fish, rest and enjoy the other hours of each day. Excellent gig for a guy that enjoys the Canadian experience. The other two cabins sleep 8 each. There are more than enough 14' boats w/25hp motors to fish 2 per boat. All boats are in good, not great, shape! This camp is as professional as it gets with providing a 5* vacation! We usually roll with 6-8 fisherman in our group and there is another group of 4-8. Easily 300' of privacy between both cabins. Its nice to know there is help if needed with the caretakers. I agree, the best way to go about purchasing would be to split the ownership, but be sure all have deep pockets for maintenance, repairs, new purchases, etc... I wouldn't do until retired. I'd like to spend 4-6 weeks up there either in one long stay or two shorter stays. The cost to do this makes me thing ownership is the route to go. Anyways, great conversation!"
3632274,Jaskonie,2015-03-09 19:22:00,80,A friend and me just closed on a lakefront property situated on a well known lake in the Chapleau game preserve with 2 cabins on it . Yes the shoreline frontage is Crown right of way but everyone uses it as their own. We purchased from Americans who owned it for 40 years. Part of Americans selling is the Canadian Govt. keeps 50 percent of the profit.
3632666,LoDo,2015-03-09 20:51:00,721,50%? Interesting. I can't imagine most would buy a single family in southern Ontario as an investment property. I'd think most would purchase as a second home. The 50% I'm sure isn't a deal breaker.
3633786,LOW1,2015-03-10 09:20:00,2828,"My understanding is that the amount of the tax is based on the increase in the value of the property over time. From the sale price one subtracts the initial purchase price and also the cost of capital improvements such as new windows, roofs, etc (but not general maintenance expenses).But if you owned a property for 40 years there could be a very large gain.There are also exceptions if the Canadian property is a primary residence."
3629985,LOW1,2015-03-09 09:02:00,2828,"As others have said there are more and more restrictions on waterfront development. For example, the Lake of the Woods in Ontario is mainly in a conservation reserve, meaning that unless land was previously transferred to a private owner the government will not transfer it now. But there is no real shortage of properties to buy if you want to since quite a bit of vacant and improved land was transferred. There is always the tradeoff of spending your vacation doing housework instead of fishing. But you can also hire the work done if you want. And I enjoy having something to do besides fishing and I like carpentry type work, so for me it's all part of the vacation. Shared ownership with others is not unusual. Some of the headaches can be avoided with a written agreement about cost-sharing, etc but if you don't get along or fairly share in the work, etc a written agreement will not be a magic cure. For us, the long term goal of living there in the summers after retirement and having a place for the kids to use was appealing. Others perhaps want to try new places and don't want to be tied down to one lake or area. Keep in mind that if you don't have road access that flying in building materials or even bringing them over the ice in the winter or by boat is expensive and inconvenient and that there may not be convenient access to cheap building materials. And government septic and other regulations mean that you can't just build what you want where you want it. So you need to weigh the pros and cons and figure out what you want. I don't have the statistics but I would estimate that close to half of the recreational properties in NW Ontario are owned by Americans."
