3639546,LoDo,2015-03-11 16:05:00,721,"Ive fished Canada for 25 years, I'm 36, and I remember years ago there wasn't a slot and limits were more liberal. I love what Canada has done with the slots and limits. Why haven't American states done this? Id think the fishing in the states would improve within 10yrs. What am I missing?"
3639642,38bill,2015-03-11 16:42:00,331,Minnesota has had slots for years as well as reduced limits. Problem is it can vary lake by lake and year by year so you better have a current regulation book.
3639690,kzoofisher,2015-03-11 16:53:00,5144,"Not everyone agrees that the fishing would improve. Many fisherman want their limit and the faster they get it the more successful the day is. If there is a protected slot from 16""-22"" and three guys go out and catch 30 fish, but end up one short of the limit, they would consider the day less successful than if there had been no slot and they had kept the first 15 fish they caught. I don't agree with that thinking, I'd much rather be catching fish than driving home early. You say you are 36 and that may be significant. There have recently been surveys done (on trout) in Michigan and Wisconsin that show a decided generational difference in attitudes about what constitutes ""good"" fishing. Older anglers tend to put more worth in taking home fish and younger ones tend to prefer numbers/size. Obviously, the creel limits we have today are both what the older anglers grew up with and what they have always tended to support. It is always worth mentioning that 40 years ago attitudes towards keeping bass and muskie were essentially the same as they are for walleye today. I don't think walleye will be 90%+ catch and release in 2055; I do think in many less fertile waters they will be kept far less often. And slot limits will be the norm anywhere that it will help natural reproduction sustain the fishery.I should also add that some places don't need a slot.Saginaw Bay and Lake Erie come to mind. Because of that and because many people are fans of simplicity, the regulations are uniform state wide. This is the case in Michigan though not in Wisconsin or Minnesota and I believe it really hurts our inland fisheries. I can't speak to how they do things in Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee etc."
3640978,Bigstorm,2015-03-12 06:13:00,799,I agree with slot limits and I also think they should vary by lake or river system rather than an overall blanket slot for the state. There are some good examples in WI of where the slot is working
3643362,jimirjr,2015-03-12 16:37:00,1149,"I know in Colorado... The CPW is more interested in Trout Fishing for the Tourists... Thier policies for managing ""trophy' fisheries leave much to be desired... And, you gotta account for the shear ""masses"" that utilize the fisheries in Colorado... I just wish They would enforce the rules a lot better and NAIL the ""cheaters"""
3645642,tv4fish,2015-03-13 08:59:00,2694,"LoDo: I certainly agree with you, and also agree that it should ""vary"" from lake to lake. I think any of us that have fished Canadian waters for more than just a few years have seen the benefits of what the Canadians have done. IMHO - the states need to take some lessons from the Canuks."
3645890,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2015-03-13 09:35:00,5533,"Not sure, but most DNR administrators and gov't officials are missing this to. It's clearly illustrated in the comparison of quality and quantity in Canadian waters vs. American waters."
