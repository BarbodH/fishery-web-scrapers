1230981,tv4fish,2010-08-27 07:48:00,2694,"phish - could you just clarify - Did you show 2 ""additional"" services in addition to the lodging? For instance - did you have to show fish cleaning and guide service as separate services on your invoice?"
1231076,phishfearme,2010-08-27 15:45:00,1242,"tv - no, the accomodations plus one service is adequate. our's was accomodations plus fly-in service. accomodations plus ""fish cleaning service"" should be enough - as long as the receipt clearly shows the service(s). phish"
