Then again a bad day of fishing is better than a good day at work"

538311,Guest,2004-03-20 20:59:00,0,"Geez.....seems like every other calander you buy up here has a table on it. Trouble is, the solunar is different from one to another. Solunars, while great in theory, don't mean much unless you don't work for a living and can fish any old time you want. OR, if you don't fish a whole lot and want to find a prime window of opportunity. Truth of the matter is, every lake and region is different, and seems to have good and bad bites contributed by many factors,....photo-period, barometric pressure, time of year (season) etc. I'd put sonular on the back of the list as far as variables are concerned. Go fish whenever you can and hope for the best! Good luck and good fishing..... -J"

Since the tables work by longitude all you need to do is figure out what point you are north of in the States to adjust for Canada. I was a sceptic so I tried out the tables and they do work with the gills in the lake behind the farm. You can sit for hours with little or no action but when the ""time"" rolls around according to the tables your bobber goes wild. I have also kept records on walleye and northern action and the tables seem to be right on. I would not let the tables stop me from fishing just because the time isn't right. My partner caught his only ten pounder on LOTW during an off period. It was the only fish for us during that off period."

I catch lots of big fish and it has to be because of the calendar I use because I don't know how to fish."
