Weather was great (Low 50's at night, Low 70's during the day), fishing was pretty good and best of all - No Bugs!. We didn't catch as many as we do when we go up in early July, but the quality of the fish was better. We caught several walleye over 20 inches with the biggest being 24 inches. Kept the 14 and 15 inchers for dinner and brought home 16-18 inchers. We only fished with jigs and plastic tails and most of the fish were caught on 1/4 or 3/8 oz. jigs with a 2 1/2"" gulp minnow or 3"" white twister tail. Water temperature was around 66-68 degrees and most of the walleye were caught in 12 to 20 ft. All totaled, the 4 of us caught 368 walleyes and 26 northern pike."

I have never been to the gouin with air tamarac,We find the fishing at lac Hebert to be very good. It was not a normal yr up there with the record breaking temps in may,very low water levels, everything was about 1 1/2 months ahead of normal. by the end of may the lakes went from being frozen to mid 70's in 30 days. Its yet to be seen how that will affect the spawn this yr.we have been to the bay du nord on the gouin many times and always caught nice fish no matter what time of yr. only ten months to the next time on the lac"

We ended up having to take a pickup truck ride out back to Baskatong where our trucks were. Jean (the owner) was our pilot and I told him that he should update the boats on the Gouin to what he has done on Lac Hebert. The 15 HP 4-strokes are nice, but having seats in the boat makes a world of difference when you're fishing 8-9 hrs/day for 7 days."
