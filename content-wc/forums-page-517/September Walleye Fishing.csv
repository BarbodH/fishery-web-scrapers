1232074,preynold,2010-08-31 13:22:00,1,Our group is heading off on our annual fishing trip in Sept this year vs our usual time in June. I'm fishing north west of Nakina Ontario on Lake Abamasagi and was curious if anyone had any good tips or things they do differently for this time of year? Appreciate the help.
1232105,IaDave,2010-08-31 15:21:00,476,"I go every year in Sept. to Sioux Lookout(Lake Minnitaki). We always go deep(30') with heavy jigs and large baits- The bigger the better(4-5"")"
1232130,Rodney Bondele,2010-08-31 17:31:00,73,Yep big and deep. I have not fished your lake but check mid-lake structure and where current is entering the lake. Have a great trip.Rodney Bondele
1232131,Guest,2010-08-31 17:34:00,0,How do you typically do on Minnitaki in September? Do you typically target walleye? How does the fishing compare to Lac Seul?
1232223,TIGHTLINER,2010-09-01 04:53:00,223,Be sure to post a report when you get home... Good fishing and have a safe trip.

We catch plenty of walleyes with the largest of each trip between 27""-28"". Last year a guy in our group got a 29""."
