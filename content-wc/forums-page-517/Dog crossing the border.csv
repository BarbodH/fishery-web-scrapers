1232202,Moondog,2010-08-31 22:28:00,362,You no longer need a certificate of health for a dog but proof of current rabies vaccination. I found this THIS YEAR somewhere on the Canadian Customs site but no longer can put my hands on it. We have taken our dog to Canada for 20 years and only once have been asked for proof of vaccination.
1211782,IAranger,2010-06-20 10:18:00,352,I am taking my dog with me across the border Is there anything special I need to get him across he does not have a passport
1211787,1shooter,2010-06-20 10:27:00,1493,You need a certificate of health. In the 15 years I have been going to Canada I have only been asked to show it twice. Not sure what would happen if you didnt have one.

1211808,Ogoki,2010-06-20 11:48:00,291,"Like 1shooter said a health cert. which should state the date of rabies vaccination . We have taken one or 2 of our labs with us numeorus times on fly-in trips. They are our ""kids"" . Our oldest lab which is 8 has been on 6 fly-in trips and 2 bears hunts . They are a pleasure to have with us . We keep them away from other people as not all people like dogs and we carry the plactic grocery bags to pick up after them . It amazed us to watch the oldest lab walk directly up to ""her"" cabin after being away from there a year ."
1211844,@Lunker,2010-06-20 15:40:00,835,"I just asked this question 10 days ago when coming across the border. I was told ""proof of rabies vaccination"" is all that's required.However, your vet should be able to provide you with a print-out or little folder listing most recent dates for all shots."
1211998,Ogoki,2010-06-21 08:37:00,291,"@Lunker is 100 % right but my vet has a paper printed up that says ""Health Certificate"" at the top and he said that was the proper way to go thru . Probably he thinks he can justify charging us more for it .LOL LOL Never had any problems going thru with pets and have never been asked for it ."
1212029,81Saluki,2010-06-21 09:31:00,97,"We always take our dog with us and, upon reaching the border, we roll down the windows so the agent can see inside our vehicle. Our pooch is friendly and hangs her head out the window. So, one of the first questions we usually get asked is ... do we have her papers. Answer is always ""yes"" and we've only been asked to show them once.This year, however, we were thrown a curve ... the agent asked what kind of food we were bringing in for her. We said Science Diet. He then asked if it was meat-based. To make a long story short ... if you're bringing in Science Diet food across the border for your dog, say ""no"" to the meat-based question and you should be OK. Don't know what will happen if you're packing other brands.Also, we had her food in zip-lock bags (no original bags with contents listed) and don't know what we would have done if they had insisted upon us proving whether or not it was ""meat-based"". Harumph!!!! Why they ask in the first place is beyond me.81Saluki"
1212148,Lake Wisconsin,2010-06-21 14:30:00,1960,"Just came back on Friday night through the US border. We were searched (due to my buddy not using all the lemons for our fish, citrus, a big no-no back to the states). The US patrol saw my dog and asked what kind he was. She also mentioned he should sit in front with us, rather than in the back of the truck. So overall, no issues and while it took a little extra time, everyone was kind, and courteous. What is funny, I have traveled through US customs at many airports due to work overseas travels, Canada many times and numerous places at the US and Mexico border. All of our protected boarders are good, except Mexico. And can you help me why this one isn't protected?"
1212189,Wall@y@,2010-06-21 16:29:00,191,"Just came back from Saskatchewan fishing and had my dog along for the trip. Going into Canada was a snap but coming back to the States we ran into some difficulty with bring back dog food that wasn't in the original container. We had it in a clear plastic zip-lock bag and the US Customs didn't like that at all. In fact, their dog must have been out of dog food because they took our dog food. Oh dear, what's this country coming to??"
1232179,1shooter,2010-08-31 20:18:00,1493,so what is the offical verdict? Do you need a certificate of health or just a print out of current vacinations?
