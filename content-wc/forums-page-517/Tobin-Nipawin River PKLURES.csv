1232083,pedwards96,2010-08-31 14:03:00,42,I've been killing the big walleye on Boysen reservoir in Wyoming. They do work really well. The best two colors are pearl chartreuse and firetiger.

1226787,TIGHTLINER,2010-08-11 05:58:00,223,Did you happen to notice what size they were using or the colors and how deep they were fishing them. thanks
1226872,Guest,2010-08-11 10:21:00,0,They were in 21 to 26 feet right at the ledge and the Crank was holographic and looked to be 4 inches maybe a little longer. At one time they were fighting 2 walleye one was at least 10 lbs. He said later it was 13 lbs but I am not sure.

1226984,Guest,2010-08-11 17:12:00,0,Yes thats them Thanks will place my order today. 30 walleye in 4 hrs with most over 5 lbs is enough proof for me. They were the yellow ones. Thanks
