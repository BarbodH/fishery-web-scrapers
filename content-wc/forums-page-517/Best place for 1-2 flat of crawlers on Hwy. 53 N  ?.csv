We get what is called a ""Canadian pack"" - the crawlers are in Buss bedding (no dirt) and we keep them in a large insulated foam container with wet newspaper in it, along with some blue ice to keep them cool. They keep very welll on the trip and at the camp."
1229419,crawler catcher,2010-08-20 19:44:00,72,Headed to Canada next week. Have some but need more crawlers. Need a bait place with a decent price as I go up 53 through Wis. and Minn.Don't want to wait until I get near the border.....way too expensive. I also don't want to stop at every 'crawlers for sale' sign I see.....so I need your help.Thanks
1229424,Outfitter17,2010-08-20 20:04:00,127,"I would stop at Sportsmans Service in I. Falls, they always have great bait and the worms are already packed in bedding that is approved to go into canada, don't know about the places farther south if they would have the right bedding or not?"
1230135,crawler catcher,2010-08-23 22:08:00,72,Thanks outfitter.....Anyone else have any bait shops ideas ?
1230142,norshor,2010-08-23 23:33:00,2,"Give Fisherman's Corner a call, they are right on 53. I would definitely call ahead for that quantity.You could also talk to Marine General, they aren't that far out of your way and Russ should have some available.Good luck!"
1230143,Nimstug,2010-08-23 23:46:00,2605,Is Fisherman's Corner right across from the fiberglass walleye?
1230155,dutchboy,2010-08-24 05:44:00,5717,On HWY. 53 about 5 miles South of the Ash River entrance to VNP on the right side is the Deer Farm. They sell bait there. Don't know what the have but it is really easy in and out off the Hwy.Should be around mile marker 130 going North. This is North of Orr.
1230296,Ashman,2010-08-24 14:33:00,106,Just curious as to how many are in a half a flat?
1230348,norshor,2010-08-24 17:21:00,2,"I think you are talking about the giant walleye just south of Kab. Fisherman's corner is in Pike Lake, which is the north side of Duluth."
1230360,hogridnfool,2010-08-24 18:05:00,349,Are you aware of the fact that your Nightcrawlers will be denied entry into Canada if there is any dirt whatsoever in their bedding?
1230389,MikeMcC,2010-08-24 19:49:00,72,"250 worms in a 1/2 flat I believe. Just make sure the crawlers are washed and prepared for entry into Canada and you will be ok. Also when you declare the worms, be sure to mention to the customs agent how they were prepared and packed."
