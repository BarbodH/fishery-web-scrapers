The big pike should be moving out to the reefs as soon as the water temp changes. I'm going back up for these girls at the end of the month."
1230240,Guest,2010-08-24 09:59:00,0,"Jatar.......mind if I ask whereabouts did you catch the huge muskie, I believe you about the muskie, I hate that when people don't believe someone when they tell a fish story. I know there's muskie in the English River, I should know I'm on the English then the person who don't believe you."

1230660,Coach BWS,2010-08-25 21:26:00,38,"4 years ago in the narrows between Ball and Tide lake I had a huge muskie completely swallow a 20"" Walleye I had on my line. We didn't get it into the boat but got lots of pics by the boat. At one time we had the head in one net and the tail in another but couldn't quite get it in. I have had musky guides look at the pics and tell me that is the biggest muskie they had ever seen. Incredible fish. She opened her mouth after about 15 minutes and the walleye slid out, we could only see the white tip of the tail till then sticking out the corner of her mouth. Rodney looked at the pics on my computer and commented that he felt it was easily an Ontario record fish. So they are in there."
