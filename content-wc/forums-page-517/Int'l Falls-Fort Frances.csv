1231679,Andy Buff,2010-08-30 11:43:00,10,Crossing was no problem either way. On Sat 8-21 we crossed at 0430 and would have been across in no time. But some poor soul in a motorhome took it upon himself to exit his vehicle to bring everyone's passports in his vehicle to the border agent...that really got their attention. Once we got to the window we had the standard questions with polite answers...we'll be back.The US side we arrived last Sat 8-28 at 0845 and waited about 3 minutes.Other than a black bear ramming the side of my truck right outside of Ft Frances...a good trip.
1231905,Slabomania,2010-08-30 22:36:00,51,"Longest wait we ever had getting back into the US was about 2-1/2 hours @ FF, on the Saturday after 9/11."
1229374,Hump,2010-08-20 16:34:00,578,"We go the last week of July, cross to Canada about 1:00 p.m and have not hand a long wait. Got searched once, but very polite. we cross always on a Friday coming back between 9a.m. and 9:30 and rarely do we wait. Normally the U.S. side is unfriendly, but we haven't had any problems. Are we just hitting the border at the right time?"
1229377,Bluff,2010-08-20 16:41:00,152,"I believe this has been stated before in this forum but if you are crossing on a Saturday be prepared to wait. That is the day guests are arriving and departing the Canadian resorts. At least that is what I have been told. The only time we have had issues crossing at Fort Frances / Int. Falls is on Saturdays - can be up to a 3.5-hour wait. You can stop in front of the McDonalds in FF, go in and eat and still keep your spot in line (at least go in, order, carry back out to the car). We did it. It's a tough way to start a long trip back home."
1229379,Skyraptor,2010-08-20 16:56:00,291,Crossed today into Canada at Fort Frances and they had 3 booths open and or wait was a total of 5 minutes. This was at about 1:30 in the afternoon. Guard was friendly and did not even look at our passports.
1229387,greg2648,2010-08-20 17:49:00,80,We crossed into Canada at 6:00 on Saturday. We came out the next Friday. No problems and no wait either way. Matter of fact we drove right up to the booth on the way up and only 1 car in front of us on the way back. We had no booze.
1229410,rather-be-fishin,2010-08-20 19:25:00,429,"Bluff, We have been going and coming on a Saturday for the last 8 years..... normally only wait for 1/2 hour going into Canada and the longest wait we have ever had coming back was 1 1/2 hours, normally it is 45 minutes...... yes we ate at McDonalds and the line up started many blocks past McDonalds.....not sure why the wait was so long both ways this year.... Minimal questions asked both ways and were treated well both ways..... Did notice that when we were going into Canada, they were using drug dogs walking around the cars on the bridge going into USA...... Next year will definately get a very early start so NOT wasting precious fishing time waiting in line!"
1229496,Bluff,2010-08-21 11:05:00,152,"We tend to keep the same dates each year for our fly-in and we have only had to cross on a Saturday once (that I can remember) A few years ago we were coming home and we crossed into the US. There was a three and half hour wait and we were told it was typical on Saturdays because of the resort turnover. In fact our outfitter warned us about the weight when we got ready to hit the road. Like I said, we were told that and it is not based on experience. Also, I guess my group has been very lucky over the years becuase we have always been treated well at the border."
1230814,Steve of Madison,2010-08-26 12:54:00,230,"I know that several of us on this post have said it for years, but I'll do it again. If you have the opportunity to NOT cross on a sat. morning don't. Our group drives up to FF on the day before move in, stay overnight on the Canada side and then continue to camp the next day, simple. Never a hassle crossing, no lines, no hurry, and while you guys are waiting in line, we are wetting a line already. If you can't go up the night before, then plan for making the border either earlier or later, or put up with the lines, just spare us from the whinning about waiting in line.....sorry I just spent 40 minutes in a traffic jam because of road const, at home!"
1230883,Bluff,2010-08-26 17:20:00,152,Our group does get across the border the night before - we stay at the Rendezvous in FF. It usually works out well.
1231445,JayM5209,2010-08-29 13:47:00,1050,"Northbound thru Int'l Falls last Saturday, 8/21, we hit the border at 1:30 pm. Three lanes open with a car in each. Total time from stopping at the hold line to pulling away from a chat with a very friendly Canadian agent - - 3 minutes.Southbound yesterday, Sat., 8/28, we hit the bridge at 8:35 a.m. Five vehicles ahead of us, three with boats, waiting for one of the three open lines. Total time from stopping on the bridge until the friendly, courteous U.S. Customs agent bid us a good day and safe drive home - - 9 minutes."
1231519,Skyraptor,2010-08-29 19:15:00,291,crossed on 8/28 going back to the US and at 12:15pm our total wait time was 5 minutes. Guard was friendly and nice and we had our cards ready and a list of our fish and booze
1228810,Andy Buff,2010-08-18 14:41:00,10,"I got a call from an employee of mine whose husband crossed into Canada at Fort Frances on Saturday (8 - 14) morning. He called her yesterday and told her that they had a four hour wait to cross. I'm not sure what time he got moving that morning, but I was wondering if anyone else had any early morning delays recently.I'm heading across about 4:30 Saturday morning. The wait doesn't matter much but I'd just like to know what to expect.64 hours to lift off!!Thanks!"
1228811,Guest,2010-08-18 14:46:00,0,"We came across Friday morning the 13th, coming in from Emo west of Fort Francis, at about 10 a.m. and waited just about 1:45 to cross. I can't speak for Saturday but if Friday was that slow it isn't hard to believe. Be sure you have enough gas and have made a potty break before getting in line."
1228813,IaDave,2010-08-18 14:52:00,476,I would think at 4:30 am it should be no problem. We plan on crossing early on 9/6
1229055,jka333,2010-08-19 13:25:00,14,wow........i've been going for decades......usually arrive at 730 at fort or international. longest i've EVER waited at 730am is 20 minutes. at 430am they may not even check you....
1229153,alanexpup,2010-08-19 19:33:00,278,you never know. at 4am they might be so tired that just having the oppurnity to thoroughly go through everything you have with no rush is just what they might be waiting for.
1229170,Jatar,2010-08-19 20:17:00,169,"came in from Emo on 8/13 at 12:30 pm, took almost 2 hours to cross, there is a park next to the cemetary with public washrooms, some enterprising canuck could make some $$$$$$ selling beer"
1229186,rather-be-fishin,2010-08-19 21:21:00,429,"This year was the LONGEST wait I have ever had going both ways! On 7/31/10 We Arrived at Int'l Falls at 11:15am ~ waited 2 HOURS to cross the border! Came back through Fort Frances on 8/7/10 arrived at 12:25pm WAITED 3 HOURS to get across......... Don't know why it took so long, they had 3 lines open coming back in!"
1229188,Flip Silverlake,2010-08-19 21:41:00,645,"Sat nearly 2 hours on the 16th. Had 3 booths open but it took for ever. They never asked how many fish we had, kept compairing our passport pictures and me and my wife. Infact the lady ordered my wife to put her hands on the dashboard. She was going to put her glasses on becasue that was the way the picture on her pasport was taken. It got kinda spooky for a little bit. We take our dog with us and keep her in a kennel when we drive. I opened the window and my little Sugar starts her barking trick. The agent asked if that was a dog in the kennel, I almost said no it was a cat with a bad cold! May be they should send some of those folks to AZ. and watch the boarder there for a while."
1229345,Stu,2010-08-20 14:01:00,472,We try to cross no later than 6am and never have to wait. One year we didn't arrive till about 10 am and waited at least 3 hours (probably more). The line stretched for a couple of miles. I'll never make that mistake again.
1229364,Guest,2010-08-20 15:09:00,0,"We also crossed earlier in the year at Fort Frances and one of my buddies had something very important to him stolen by a Canadian border guard while we went thru a search of our vehicle and boat. We know this for a fact, but have not done anything more than try to alert everyone crossing at this point. It was not discovered until we reached camp. We spent over an hour waiting while they searched everything. None of us had a record, we only brought a case of beer each and answered all their questions with a smile and politeness. These guys were a pair of pr__ks with a badge. They found nothing other than the item they stole and told us to ""have a nice trip"". My guess is they are primarily looking for alcohol over what you are allowed to bring in. If they are looking for drugs, why not have a dog - to help the line move quicker. We should all try to unite and boycott Canada for just one year and keep our money in the states. This would not be good for the outfitters and resort owners who have always been great, but maybe this would wake up their socialist government when a huge tax revenue is lost - yes when Americans are not up there spending $40+ dollars for a case of beer, they will notice. I know my group is not going back for a long time."
