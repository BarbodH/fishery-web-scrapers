Weather just did not really give us what we were hoping for. Three days around 90, and then three more stickly 80+ all sunny, with the occasional cloud. I just never really felt like the fish were going to move much. Water temp was upper 60's to low 70's. We fished mostly rocks, weeds, saddles points for Muskie, and moved 8 fish for the week. I was a bit dissappointed in the lack of follows, however I did get fortunate to stick a 43"" and a 42"" back to back evening during magic hour. fat fish, both were real heavy. We threw blades mostly, some rubber, and some weegle's, and topraiders. The two bites were on blades. We also boated some decent pike, decent number of 32-38, not bad for how warm the water was. After the first three days of chucking lumber and blades, we decided to take a break and jig over walleyes. Fish were really not that hard to find. We made the run to scaler and just didn't get on them. A few nice fish but no great numbers. The red jug south of camp produced around 30 fish in the a.m. on the north side of the break just north of the jug in 17 to 24 feet on chart. vegas jigs and either crawlers or minnows. We also caught some pike throwing swim jigs in areas we caught walleyes. Big walleye was 26"" and many in that 15 to 18 range Danny, Garrett, Chris all were awesome, the butchered up out fish, and were **** near at our beckon call. They really do a nice job, Ken was extremely helpful as well, one sunny hot crappy day I walked down to the office and asked Ken where to park my boat, he took me right out to the map, gave specific, accurate description of the spot and in a 15 minute boat ride we were on fish for three hours, pretty nice spot of heaven he has up there. All in all I will never complain about a week in ontario. Beautiful place. I did not get that big bite I am looking for and would love to hear anyone willing to give some constructive advice.."
1232143,Guest,2010-08-31 18:01:00,0,Thanks very much for the report. Sorry to hear it was so hot and still. Makes for tougher fishing. Sounds like you did the best you could expect in the circumstances. I have not heard that the musky are plentiful up Chamberlain Narrows way but perhaps this is a reflection of the folks I have been fishing with. Most of those targeting musky seem to fish south of the Rags in the Manitou and Crooked Rapids areas. I am headed up to Sioux Lookout this Friday for a week and hoping for good (a little cooler) fishing weather.

The walleye fishing has always been good, not exceptional like you might get on a remote fly in where you are the only camp, but never had any problems catching good numbers of eater size fish. The muskies have been tougher, they do not exist in any sort of density, but there are a some fish around and a few real nice ones, but there are better places to be on any sort of numbers of fish."

It has been several years since we have flown in there but as we were arriving the departing group had pics of 49""+ fish and more than one. We were there for eyes but my son & I each had a muskie double. They were not that big but an indication of the fishery. Warning!! This is at the conflux of a couple of rivers. When it storms you are on your own."
