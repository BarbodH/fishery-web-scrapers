Anyone been up in that area lately, and if so how did you do?I try to make a couple short trips a season. One early spring and the other in the fall. I would love to go for a week at some point but prefer to make two short trip than one longer one. Gives me something to look forward to all summer.Hope everyone has had a great summer. Thanks"

Minnows, leeches and nightcrawlers all worked. Find a hump and fish 15-25 feet. The lake surface temp fell 6 degrees while we were there which didn't help. Camp help said a 32"" fish was caught recently just below the chutes. Good luck and let us know how it went."
