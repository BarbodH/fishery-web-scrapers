1230169,Obabikon,2010-08-24 06:27:00,2370,"Supposedly you can on packages that include a guide, transportation, maid service, or some other type of services"
1230179,Guest,2010-08-24 06:55:00,0,I was told at the Tourist Center in Fort Frances that you could get some tax back if your resort provided at least three services. Check when you cross the border.

Fish or game processing counts.......so as long as this is shown on your receipt as the eligable service received then you can claim a rebate. The rebate is half of the HST tax on the package which is likely well worth the effort of filling out the form. I have been filling in the form for my guests and mailing them in........so far it appears people are getting their rebates."

After spending some amount of time trying to find the correct form on the official govt website (there are over 2700 available HST forms), I would really appreciate web access to the right form. Does anyone have this information? Thanks, Bill Krejca"
1230329,v-bay gord,2010-08-24 16:09:00,3168,"Bill......if I was computer literate I could probably provide a link. Since I'm not the best route is to do a search for ""HST rebate form for tour packages""...this will get you to the right page on the Government of Canada website. The form you want is ""Gst 115E (08)"". Good luck Let me know if you need help filling it in. vbay gord"
1230371,Bill Krejca,2010-08-24 18:35:00,6107,"Gord - I found the form online, thanks much. I'll post an update later on the results! Bill Krejca"
1232144,Guest,2010-08-31 18:10:00,0,Here is the online link for the GST 115 E form. You can either print it out and fill it in or fill it on online then print it out.http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/README.html
