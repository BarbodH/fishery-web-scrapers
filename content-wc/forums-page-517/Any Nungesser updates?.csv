1219255,GOBIG,2010-07-15 03:22:00,126,"NP, I just recently talked with a group from Ohio, they were up on that lake as well. Nothing of any size, extremly rocky lake. I will try to get back in touch with them to find out where they stayed. They did mention that there were a ton of boats on this lake that week. This is why I read WC, honest unbiased opinions go a long way. I will let you know."
1219499,teddi,2010-07-15 16:59:00,349,most of your pictures look like they have been photo shoped. i take a lot of photos and can tell. give all of us a break and read other posts about the fishing. average but not super.
1219544,kgeary,2010-07-15 19:21:00,88,"Teddi none of my pictures look like they have been photoshopped unless adding the anglers name is what you mean by photoshopped. I have used photoshop for over 15 years and i in fact can tell. I don't know. You may take a lot of pictures but if your suggesting i've altered the size of the fish then you are sadly mistaken if you do in fact know your way around photoshop then what your insuating is a bald faced lie. Why you would take the time make accusations like that about me should be of more interest to readers. People know who i am because i let them know. I don't have a problem with it. People do not know who you are - why??? Yes i agree - read other posts about the fishing ""well above average"" ""best i've seen"" etc etc i'm not saying anything one way or the other, just reporting what has happened. Many many people have emailed and told me they appreciate it. Even those who are not coming to anglers kingdom. It still begs the question why does it bother you???"
1219583,Bigsauger,2010-07-15 21:39:00,12,"Since I started this thread I felt I should provide a quick update after our trip. We stayed at Nungesser Lake Lodge from June 18 - 24th. Overall we found the camp to be great and the service was by far the best we have ever received in Canada. Not sure if it was just a lucky summer for the owners or not but they sure had some friendly and helpfull ""kids"" working there. This was our 2nd trip to Nungesser (we stayed at a different resort last time) and I would hight recommend NLL to anyone.Overall the fishing was as expected. Very solid walleye fishing with excellent numbers. The largest was 27"" with many from 21"" - 25"". We didn't fish for northerns much but I heard of a few 40""+ pike being caught by others at the camp.My only complaint with Nungesser is it seems like there are a lot of boats on the lake. I tried to estimate about 50-60 at any given time and although it's a large lake it's frustrating when others are always fishing the ""spots"" you want to try. I'm not one for butting in on others so we typically just move on to find another one. Maybe I'm just spoiled from multiple fly in trips over the years but it seems like it's much busier Lac Seul which is another favorite of mine. (although I've never fished the Ear Falls portion of it which I hear is busy)."
1219762,ManitowishWaters,2010-07-16 12:14:00,39,"50-60 boats. Kinda scared about that. We are coming from a place where we fished walleyes in the morning avg. 20-30 between 8 and noon. Normally one was in the 20-24"" range. Then fished pike in the afternoon. I guess, we'll see how crowded it is, but not a big fan of tons of boats. I would be greatful if anyone has been up in summer, and had some non ""community"" spots. I am thinking any hump should hold some eyes this time of year. Can't believe 3 camps can put out that many boats, but i suppose they can. Thanks for any and all info."
1219777,kgeary,2010-07-16 12:39:00,88,"manitowash Don't be worried Mid June is the busisest time of the year for pretty much every lake in this area and others. I have 16 guest boats, the other camps about the same and one of those seldom has more than a few out. so I would guess there was more like 30-40 boats on a 28000 acre lake about 18 miles long with several hundred miles of shoreline ( maybe a thousand I don't know) Even in June. I seldom have to go more than 5 minutes from camp to find a spot that no one has fished. I can look out my window and keep track of who has fished about 15 excellent spots. If I travel towards the far end I can find hundreds of available spots. Most days I will not see another boat. In July and August myself and others will have even fewer boats on the water. if it averages more than 12 boats a day I'd be surprised. you may not always be able to fish the spot you were thinking of but I assure you you will have several equally productive options available at any one time there are some ""community spots"" mostly the most obvious spots but there are also hundreds of not so noticable and more difficult to locate spots that will keep you smiling all day. I will share some spots with you that you will have to yourself ( unless I'm out there too LOL)"
1220426,Falcon1,2010-07-18 19:44:00,3,"This year, two of our party decided that they wanted to go farther north in their quest to catch a trophy pike. They talked to the outfitter, and he guaranteed them of catching a fish of their dreams. Well, we all discovered that all involved going need to be involved in the search process. You need to ask questions and talk to previous visitors. I arrived to camp a little later than these two. When I saw the look on the face of one of them, I knew there were problems. If you go to the outfitter's web site, you will see a glowing report of the camp. In the time we were there, no one caught a trophy pike or walleye; hundreds of fish were not caught; an advertised four bed cabin slept only three; you could only tap into the wifi if you were willing to stand on the beach outside the outfitter's cabin; the central heating was a small propane tank with a heater attached(I wished I could attach a picture for you to see. Another cabin had a wood burning stove. It is a good thing that someone brought matches for a fire.); the boats radios and fish finders did not work; a picture on the web page are not what we stayed in;the fish house only accommodated two staying side by side; we were one of the four boats to run out of gas; there was no daily maid service; and the rocks were poorly marked(Children styrofoam tubes were used. These were hard to see when they were laying horizontal.). Twenty-two of us were so disgusted in the lack of fishing and the accommodations that we left a day and a half early. There are three outfitters on the lake with a lot of fishing pressure. You rarely were able to fish without seeing another boat. When we asked for the total price for the camp, we were given one price. Before leaving, we were then informed of the GST tax. What hit the nail on the head for disappointment for so many of the fishermen is Kevin Geary never once the whole week came to see anyone. Remember to do your homework before a trip."
1220496,GOBIG,2010-07-19 04:53:00,126,"Well, the funny thing is, that is exactly what I heard and talked about earlier. They never caught so many 10-13 in walleye. They saw some big fish, however no more or less than a fly in. Boats everywhere and yes the rocks......Falcon 1 PM me with those pictures. I am looking for a good camp, but all I keep hearing is on the negative side with this lake. I have been on a lake and caught 100 fish in a day, however when you sit and jig one spot and all that is caught are small, I MOVE ON. I am quit happy with 40 bigger fish in a day than boosting about 75-100 minnows. Once again this is why I read this site, one bad review and I think nothing of it, however, 3-4 then I start to wonder. Keep the honesty coming.."

1220726,Guest,2010-07-19 16:53:00,0,"All, I have been going to Nungessor for 8 years now. Based off my experience the lake has a lot more boat traffic which forces you to find new spots. That is not always a bad thing, but I would rather be spending the time fishing vs boating around. The fishing has been consistent over the years. However, we had better luck catching bigger fish 3 to 4 years ago. I will probably continue to go to Nungessor, because I am a creature of habit and am a person who likes to know what to expect. However, if I ever have the chance to jump in with another group that has been to a lake and has had decent success I will most likely try a new lake. Just my opinion on the fishing and lake."
1220745,Falcon1,2010-07-19 18:18:00,3,"It is very frustrating to plan and spend your well earned money for a fishing trip that is a bust. I don't know about other outfitters on Nungesser, but you would be wise to go to another camp instead of AK. The accommodations do not match the pictures. Contact me privately, and I will send you pictures of the camp as it really is. Contact the anglers from Iowa and Ohio that were in camp, the week of June 11. Ask them why they decided to leave early. How can Geary comment about how many fish that are taken each week when he did not talk to anyone of us? We fished some of Geary's favorite spots and caught only one small pike the whole day. The best way to find out the truth about a camp is talk to at least four individuals that only been to the camp once recently. I repeat, pictures speak a thousand words."
1220759,GOBIG,2010-07-19 19:18:00,126,Yes thank you np.
1220761,GOBIG,2010-07-19 19:22:00,126,"I have seen the photos from falcon 1. I would expect that from a fly in, not a drive to camp, with a boat ride. I am going to wait a while. I bet more comes out about this. Thanks again for the honesty..."
1220851,tparker,2010-07-20 07:16:00,100,"Went to BirchPoint Camp on Nungesser Lake in June of 2008 and July of 2009. Couldn't make it this year, but hope to go back next year. I don't know anything about Anglers Kingdom, so I won't comment about that camp. We had very good walleye fishing both years, with a few nice pike thrown in that we caught when they took our hooked walleye at boatside and wouldn't let go. I never thought there were too many boats on the lake to hamper my fishing. Sure there were times when I went to some of the more popular spots and found another boat or two there. No big deal, you just go to another spot. Plenty of productive water to fish without running into other boats. Both years, the largest walleye in our group( 2 people in 2008 and 4 people in 2009) was a 28""er. In 2008 my son and I boated 353 walleye in five days of fishing, with numerous walleye between 22' and 25"", again with the largest at 28"". In general, plenty of eaters with a good number of plus 20"" fish. Our 2009 trip was also productive, although the weather made things very tough at times. We still caught great numbers of eaters, but not as many plus 20"" fish. I suspect this was due to not being able to fish where we wanted to many days due to the weather. My take on the lake in general is a very good walleye lake for numbers, and if the weather cooperates a bit, plenty of big fish. I also felt that Birchpoint was a top notch camp. Okay cabins with good boats and motors and good dock help. The camp owner Roy Green did everything we asked and then some. Communicated with us EVERY day to put us on fish. He is available every morning before you go out, and will provide a new map each morning with suggested spots depending on current weather. All you have to do is ask. Just my honest opinion on Nungesser Lake and BirchPoint camp. Tim"
1220915,2746,2010-07-20 09:53:00,3206,"I've been following this thread with some interst as I fished Nungesser for several years nearly 40 years ago. We also stayed at Birch Point, then run by Roy's parents George and Connie, and they were one of only two camps on the lake. Also, during that same approximate time frame my sons and I did a couple of fly ins out of Red Lake with Kevin Geary's father. In fact, we did our last fly the year and week that Kevin's father had a heart attack. I have good memories of both the Geary family and Nungesser lake which has attracted me to this thread. Nungesser was always a great lake to fish with lots of structure, too many spots to ever get bored and an excellent mix of walley and Northern. I'm guessing, like other Ontario lakes, the fishing there has just gotten better with time because of the slot limits. I would likely still be fishing there except I finally purchased my own boat (a moment of weakness) and needed a drive to lake. I expect by now I have nearly 70 canadian trips in my memory bank. Mixed into those have been excellent fishing, slow fishing, good weather, bad weather, rustic accomadations, ""as good as home"" cabins, broken equipment, leaky boats, disappointments and too many pleasant surprises to remember. One thing I've noticed however, the tough days or even problem lakes all become part of the good memories I have of fishing Canada. When were sitting around sharing stories from past trips the cabin with the bad bed that left one of us sleeping on the floor, the boat that lost it's drain plug and the 42"" Northern all bring a smile. In reality we've never had a ""bad"" trip and Nungesser remains one of the best 3 or 4 lakes we've fished in Ontario."

1231123,tjandy,2010-08-27 20:22:00,107,Nungesser is the best Walleye lake our group has fished in 30 years of Canadian fishing. This includes several fly ins.

1226389,Walleye Fishing Guy,2010-08-09 19:22:00,12,"Just wanted to add my 2cents to this thread.I had posted earlier this spring looking for information on Nunguesser and had 6-7 people respond that the fishing was above average for numbers and size. I decided after checking things a little more to book into Anglers Kingdom.Just returned yesterday from a week and can report that the fishing was good. I had along a friend that had never caught a walleye before or spent much time fishing for them. The two of us managed to catch fish every day, the size ranged from about 12"" - 24"". Not the big one I was hoping for but with rain at least part of each of the fiirst 4 days including getting chased off by hail and lightning one day, it wasn't bad. When we switched to fishing crawlers instead of gulp, we really nailed them about as fast as I've had on LOW/Rainy or Lac Suel.As far as the cabins at AK - they were not the best I've ever been in and the also were'nt the worst. Maybe it's me, but the mattress was comfortable, plenty of blankets if needed...the food on the meal plan was plentiful if not 5 star haute cuisine. Kevin Geary was more than willing to answer any and all questions about the lake and techniques. Also need to mention that one of the lakes rocks decided to take a bite out of the prop one day...they had us up and runnjing again in less than 2 hours and on check out, I wasn't charged for any damage since they were abole to pound the prop back into shape. A lot of places, I would have just been charged.Since I lost my long time fisihing partner when my dad passed on a couple of years ago, I don't get fishing as much as I used to (We had made over 30 trips together to Canada over theyears) so I'm not sure when I will return. I can say this though, I did have a good time at Nunguesser Lake and the Anglers Kingdom. I wouldn't mind going back again to try for one of those really big northerns I know are there as we had one grab a walleye on the way to the boat but we were not able to get it into the net...and I wouldn't hesitate to go back to AK. Everyone needs to decide for themselves but, it seems to me that good fishing, comfortable beds and decent food and of course quality companionship are all that it takes to make fond memories.Tight Lines to Everyone - and thanks to those that suggested Nunguesser Lake last spring."
1227737,tjandy,2010-08-14 16:22:00,107,"Just got back from Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser Lake. Anglers Kingdom is everything my friends and I look for and more. Kevin and his family are very good people. They have some very helpful and friendly help also.The cabins were comfortable and clean. The boats are awesome, loaded with 50 horse Honda's, Lowrance locators, Lowrance ship to shore radios and live wells. Very comfortable boats, even when fishing 3, you don't find that everywhere.The fishing was some of the best we have had in 30 years. We caught tons of fish in the 16 to 18 inch range and among the 6 of us we caught 32 over 20"", the biggest being 26.5"", (not including the one that got to the boat, but couldn't be landed) Thanks Kevin for a great week."
1228843,kgeary,2010-08-18 16:54:00,88,"Hi Walleye fishing Guy and TJ Andy , thanks for the kinds words. ManitowishWaters I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip. I told you not to worry. As many others who have fished Nungesser stated - it is a great walleye lake. Most of them feel it is the best. The pike fishing is a bit difficult but when it comes to the high end fish, those 45-50 inchers I haven't found any lake better. This past weekend the fishing was even better than usual. Most boats were catching 200 or more per day. with the cold front comin gin Monday it has slowed down but still catching lots of fish. The Mid september walleye fishing is typically the best for larger walleye. thanks kg"

Very unusual to find boats like the outfitters that Kevin runs with 50 hp motors at a fishing camp.There are even livewells,bilge puimps,sonar units and radios. As usual Kevin was very helpful in marking out the fishing spots on the lake map. The food was wonderfull and the cabin very nice. Will return again next year."

Anglers kingdom only was allowed to have a resort because kevin claimed some ""first nation blood"". somehow he was allowed. nungesser was a good lake. if you like crowds, go to nungesser."
1230149,kgeary,2010-08-24 03:11:00,88,"walleye 88ia You are misinformed. I have a pretty good idea where you get your misinformation. However it has nothing to do with my ""first nation blood"". I built Anglers Kingdom because I have every right to do so. The same right as anyone else that owns their property. In fact the property was the location of the FIRST camp built on Nungesser back in the early 60s. The last Tourist camp licence was still on the wall. It just happened that the people who later bought it used it simply for their own enjoyment. I chose to share it with others. I have fished over 300 lakes, I don't find it crowded at all. With 28,000 acres of water I can always find a place to fish alone. When I go to the East end I usually don't see another boat all day. Within 5 minutes travel I can fish over 100 spots that seldom see another angler. ( I can watch many from my desk) I automatically check each fish and very seldom catch a walleye that has been caught before. Nungesser is a great lake. I went strictly catch and release on walleye over 18 inches and all pike. Fishchaiser thanks for the kind words."
1230327,walleye88ia,2010-08-24 16:02:00,35,"thanks kevin for your prompt response. i was informed or misimformed about your lodge from another lodge owner at the all canada show in des moines 2 years ago. i cant remember which owner it was, but it was not one of the other lodge owners on nungesser. i have stayed on the other 2 lodges on the lake. i like both very much. i have seen yours, i have also talked to you at the all canada show. i would like to stay at your lodge sometime. the lake has more boats now than it used to. no doubt about. it still is a good lake. yes, you all have the right to be there. i hope you owners can work together to keep the lake in good shape."
1230847,kgeary,2010-08-26 15:13:00,88,"hi walleye88ia Yes there is a lot of ""information"" passed around at sportshows almost as much as online. I started catch and release in 1978 and promoted it heavily while producing outdoor Encounters TV series thru the 80s and 90s. I will definitely continue to promote catch and release and do what I can to help maintain and improve the fishery on Nungesser. It is an amazaing lake. Yes I would definitely enjoy having you visit Anglers Kingdom. It has been very gratifying to develop a great group of friends and guests. It has been challenging during these economic times. Everyone knows that this industry is more of an enjoyable way of life than just business."

I was out with the family wednesday and caught over 200 in a few hours. Ask belinda how many I caught with her and dennis yesterday. weather and fishing has been great hope the weather holds. kg"
1224014,clearis,2010-07-31 09:23:00,47,"Headed up next week for first trip to Nungesser. Reports are that fishing has been hot. That can change week to week, even day to day or hour to hour. I'm hoping the action holds. Weather next week looks pretty good, though there are some scattered showers in the forecast. Two years ago on a trip to Shining Falls Lodge in Manitoba I caught 34 walleye in 90 minutes. It's not rare to have huge numbers on remote Canadian lakes. My numbers would have been better that time if I had switched from a bottom bouncer and back trolling to vertical jigging. I was using the bottom bouncer to find active fish. Once found I should have stayed on top of them. Though I'm from northern Minnesota, I do very little fishing for walleye or northern locally. Once you've fished a remote Canadian lake, anything else is like comparing the local county fair to Disney World. There's no comparison. It usually takes a day or two to figure out the lake to get numbers. A a guide can cut that time in half. Once you know the spots, techniques and read the weather, its pretty hard not to have a great day of fishing on these wonderful northern lakes."
1224028,kgeary,2010-07-31 10:43:00,88,"As of Yesterday the 15-18 inch walleye were still in 12-14 feet worms, minnows on 1/4 oz jigs vertical jigging the big pike were in there too. The bigger walleye were in 17-21 ft. weather has been stable fishing has been great. Every method and technique was working vertical jigging with worms and minnows was best gulp alive etc was pretty good. all the rest was working okay too -, lindy rigs, spinner rigs, crank baits, slip bobbers Typical mid summer locations mid lake structures. major points etc coming out of deep water in the main lake basins. Every section of the lake is producing It isn't all the east end or all the west end. If it looks like there should be walleye there, then there is. this is an awesome time that we wait for all year. You will have a great time no matter where you are heading even if it isn't nungesser. kg"
1225618,ManitowishWaters,2010-08-06 17:54:00,39,"Driving back from nungesser as I type. Fishing the past week was good to great. Lots of walleyes. First day was a little slow with smaller fish being caught. Monday was decent in the morning for both numbers and size, the afternoon was slow. Monday night was great with about 30 some walleyes in a hour and a half and that was not fishing hard just screwing around. Tuesday morning was good, with some nice fish caught 23's and 24's and a 26.5"" as the big fish of the trip. Wed. was slower for us in the morning, but then had a great afternoon, wind was blowing and waves were large. Stopped at a spot out of the wind crossing the main lake just to take a break from pounding waves, and picked up a quick 15 fish with the largers around 20"". Thursday brought higher winds and bigger waves. I would guess 3 to 4 foot swells. Found a spot the drifting in the wind with spinners produced fish every pass with the largest again around 23"". Overall weather was good rained/stormed pretty much every night and had a **** of a coldfront move through wed evening. Went from hot 80 degress on Wed to somewhere in the lower 60's on Thurs. Our camp was great, everything as advertised, and the estimated cost was within $.60. Only complaint, was the northern fishing, which lack of weeds due to high water the last 3 years was the main cause. We didn't spend a ton of time over deep water looking for them, but most likely were there. I would guess on average our boat of two was around 50 to 100 fish per day. The boarder coming back today was aweful got there at 3 and sat in line to get across."

I have been fishing on this lake since 1989, my Dad since 72. We had a tremendous week of fishing catching more than 100 walleye per boat every day. We caught lots of 15-17 inch walleyes with several in the 22-27 inch range. The northerns were biting on the walleyes when we were bringing them in and we did manage to also catch some on quick strike rigs. We had 10 kids in our party so it was great that the weather and the fish were cooperating. For the past five years we have been staying at Anglers Kingdom. The camp is great with very helpful staff, equipment and food. This was one of the best trips we have had in the past several years. Nice part about this lake is that it is so loaded with walleyes that unless they have lockjaw or you a total ""pud"" fisherman it is easy to catch nice fish. In the 20 years I have been going there the fishing just seems to be getting better. Nice to have the addition of Anglers Kingdom to the lake to have a premier camp to stay at.Reply With Quote Multi-Quote This Message Quick reply to this messagebhod79View Public ProfileSend a private message to bhod79Find all posts by bhod79Add bhod79 to Your Contacts #2 Report Post Old 08-16-2010, 11:42 PMfishchaser fishchaser is offlineMinnowJoin Date: Mar 2009Location: Orient, OhioPosts: 2Default nungesser lakeWell said BHOD79.

Have yet to find a better walleye lake.Reply With QuoteSO ON WITH MY REPLYFalcon1 I don`t know who you are neither does anyone else reading this thread(that in itself should raise questions in the minds of readers.)I spoke to members of EVERY group in camp that weekIf I did not speak to you personally I`m sorry.Maybe the other members in your group refused to tell you anything I said to them.I DO WONDERHOW DID YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FIND OUT ABOUT MY FAVOURITE SPOTS IF I NEVER SPOKE TO ANYONE.I have to say many readers would think that is impossibleHOW YOU FISHED ONE OF MY FAVOURITE SPOTS ALL DAY AND CAUGHT ONLY ONE SMALL PIKE IS NOT REALLY A MYSTERY AT ALL.Here is the link with that weeks reportIt starts the end of June just scroll down. If a picture speaks a thousand words then here are about forty thousand words.How about videos how many words do they speak. HERE IS THE LINKhttp://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/2...1_archive.htmlAs I said I spoke to members of each groupIt is impossible to be certain to speak to EVERY member of each group.five of the six groups in camp that week were repeatsWould you like emails from those five groups in camp that weekAND REPORTS DIRECTLY FROM THEM.I could get them and post them here.It won`t differ much because that is where I got the info from in the first place.4 of those 5 have indicated they will be returning in 2011ONE GROUP IS RETURNING NEXT WEEK FOR THERE SECOND TRIP OF 2010Maybe it is just me but this sounds a far cry from the claim that everyone in camp left early and was unhappy.perhaps you would like to email them directly and suggest that they never return to Anglers Kingdom.ONE GUEST IN CAMP THAT WEEK HAS BEEN COMING EVERY SINGLE YEAR SINCE WE STARTED IN 2005 AND THE PAST 3 YEARS HAS FISHED WITH US FOR 10 WEEKS OR MORE EACH SUMMER.Would you like to try to convince him how terrible my camp is.the Demoss group - one of the remaining two have photos on the report.(the guys with the several big pike AND WALLEYE)the one remaing group does not have photos on the report I could be wrong but if I recall correctly I coldn`t get Jasons camera memory card to read on my computer. But don`t hold me to it. i don`t want to be accused of lying.I spoke to them each of the first 4 days.When a member of that group hit a rock and took the lower unit out we had them back on the water by 9 am. I have pictures of each of my cabins on my websitehere is the linkhttp://www.anglerskingdom.com/kingdom.htmlThe only difference now is that they are painted.Our central heating system on one end of camp was broken that week and we had to use a propane heater in two cabinsI`m guessing that was falcon1 MIGHT have been in one cabinIf falcon1 actually was a guest of mine.Because if I never talked to him as he claims then he probably never visited Anglers Kingdom.People reading these so called truthful reports about the evil Kevin Geary and his awful camp can figure out for themselves who is telling the truth.I know you will have a VERY VERY hard time convincing five of the groups in camp THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKELY A PATHETIC ATTEMPT BY AN ANONAMOUS, JEALOUS COMPETITOR TO RAISE DOUBTS IN PEOPLES MINDS ABOUT MYSELF AND MY CAMP"
1220447,Baitslinger,2010-07-18 20:58:00,93,"We fished Nungesser with a group of 6 earlier this summer. It was our second trip to the lake in two years.Fishing was decent, but not red hot. We were able to find walleye most everywhere we tried, as well as lesser numbers of pike. Average walleye was probably 13-17"". Any fish of 18"" or greater was ""nice"", and anything much over 20"" was considered ""big"". Everyone caught at least one fish of 24""+, and our big fish for the week were 26, 27, & 28. Big pike for the week was about 36"", with a handful more over 30"". We did not target pike and caught them incidentally to walleye.I was not dissapointed with the fishing, but it certainly was not a ""knock your socks off"" type experience either. If you worked at it, you caught fish of all sizes. Our best days were in the range of 50-60 per boat, and we were quite happy with that. Worst days were 20 or less per boat- this was usually just as a result of poor weather and not spending much time on the water.We did as well or perhaps slightly better than others in camp. Some of them fished longer hours or in rougher weather, and as a result probably caught more fish than we did. When we were within site of other boats, we seemed to be doing at least as good as than they were, and often times better- although we never stuck around long when others showed up and fished nearby.My two biggest concerns with the lake: One-- its big water, and gets very rough. There are plenty of sheltered locations to get out of the wind, but crossing the open water stretches can be downright scary and quite unpleasant. Second-- there is no shortage of anglers and boats on the lake. We made an effort to get away from the crowds, and were usually able to do so, but usually, at least once per day, someone would see us fishing, pull up close and start trolling or jigging within casting distance. One group of boneheads actually trolled across a slip bobber rig that we had out. They grinned, waved, and acted quite friendly-- too dumb to even realize what they did. We picked up our bobber and moved on. The people exhibiting this classless behavior were from all three camps including our own. I think its just a function of being brain dead and maybe coming from the big city where tolerances for crowding may be a bit different that what I accept. Nungesser is a very big lake, but all three camps are in the same general area on the west end of the lake, so the obvious spots do get plenty of pressure. Two to four boats on certain points and islands was a common site. In rough weather, pressure tends to be even more concentrated.Bottom line for us-- fishing is good, but not outstanding. We've gone twice, and will be back next year for a third trip, although later in the summer in hopes of fewer people on the lake and in camp. We enjoy our camp and the folks there, but I wouldnt hesitate to try another lake or camp either someday. And if I had the funds, I'd do a fly-in outpost to a lake where we were the only cabin, but thats just not an option for us at this point.I really believe that your trip is what you make of it. Have fun whatever you decide."
1220470,kgeary,2010-07-18 22:32:00,88,"If you do some home work you will find a whole lot of people that consider Nungesser a great lake to fish. Myself included. I know we haven't had a week this summer without at least a few trophy fish being caught. Most weeks see many trophies get caught. And hundreds of fish are caught each and every week. That is just a simple fact. Not a boast Not a guarantee. I don't know of any camp operator that GUARANTEES trophy fish I certainly NEVER have. I do make it the number one priority and it definitely shows. It is not a guarantee but over the years I have offered this: Fish with me for a week if no trophy fish are boated the weeks stay and my guiding are free. If any trophy fish are boated then price of the trip and the guiding are double. That always seemed like a pretty fair offer. Just this evening I was out for a few hours with Dennis, Seanna and Belinda. We caught three 26 inch walleye a 27 and a 28 1/2 (plus about 20 eaters) I'm not sure if they qualify as a trophy for everyone but I know a whole lot of people that consider them trophies. I know for sure that the three people in my boat were thrilled. I think this thread was about the fishing but here is some additional info you might enjoy. A fishing trip is what you make it. You can go anywhere and find fault with something. When we go on a hot holiday my wife gets upset if the sun doesn't shine everyday. When the weather or fish don't cooperate for an individual it often becomes the camp and camp operators fault. That's okay I can handle it. I talk with each group when they arrive. I talk with my guests everyday. Of course I don't chase them around the camp to do it. I may not get to speak to everyone everyday but have breakfast and dinner with my guests. I do not go into my guests cabins to visit. I just don't think it is appropriate. I go over the lake map with each group and share as much info as they are willing to listen to. I think most new guests are in such a hurry to get on the water they don't want to sit and listen to me. In June most groups get up eat and go fishing then come back eat and go to bed. It doesn't leave a whole lot of time to talk with 20 or 25 different people. I went to town once in the month of June for a doctor appointment. I don't have a four bedroom cabin and don't advertise a four bed cabin. I certainly have never put four people in a 3 bedroom cabin. It is very gratifying that we get many many compliments on our accomodations. When equipment is being rented things do get broken. radios get stepped on kicked, mics pulled off antenas stepped on or otherwise broken. they get fixed. sonar units, props, lower units etc.all the same. In June one wireless router did break and the wifi was only available near my cabin Even during the busiest time of year it was fixed within 10 days. I've never advertised wifi all over camp I know Cal is sitting in the dining room right now and surfing the net. When operating in a remote location most of our guests understand that if something gets broken it will take a bit of time to get fixed. Most remote camps don't have to worry about fixing marine radios, sonar units and wifi because they do not provide it. It is definitely a challenge keeping all of it operating plus everything else. I'm glad that we do provide this type of extra equipment because the vast majority of our guests really appreciate the equipment and our best efforts to keep it all working. I know that I don't run a perfect operation and that I will never be able to satisfy every guest. My father and grandfather understood this since 1948. I started Anglers Kingdom from scratch in 2005 and thru the worst recession of our lifetime I have managed to provide the vast majority of my guests with a satisfying vacation. Many many of my guests become lifelong friends and those that can still afford it keep returning. I've been involved in the industry my entire life. It is still and will always be a great business to be involved with. And forums like this are always a great place to discuss this fishing passion we all share"
1220486,teddi,2010-07-19 00:45:00,349,maybe kevin should read his web site so he knows what he is selling.
1210082,Bigsauger,2010-06-14 15:51:00,12,We are heading up to Nungesser this weekend and I'm curious if anyone can provide an update on how the fishing has been recently.
1210115,NP4ME,2010-06-14 17:15:00,378,"Hey Bigsauger, I am with a group that is headed up this weekend also. It is our first trip. Have you been before? I might have to rack your brain for some tips...if you're willing to share! NP"

1218772,ManitowishWaters,2010-07-13 18:20:00,39,"Headed up the first of august stayin at birchpoint. I have been following anglers kingdom blog, but just was wondering if anyone has been up recently. Also is there a gps chip for this lake at all? Thinking jig heads are the way to go for eyes, haven't really fished spinners on any of the other lakes over 9 years, but should i start tyin them?"
1218803,teddi,2010-07-13 19:32:00,349,kevin is to busy photo shoping his camp pictures to post an update.
1218880,GOBIG,2010-07-14 03:21:00,126,"Please post how the lake was. There have been some reports of unhappy fisherman coming off this lake this year. I do not know who they stayed with, but I guess the lake has a lot more small walleye than bigger ones and cabins not living up to snuff for drive to lake. Very curious to hear reports from new people on the lake...."
1218936,tparker,2010-07-14 07:04:00,100,"Manitowish Waters, I sent you a pm."
1219051,NP4ME,2010-07-14 11:38:00,378,"GO BIG,Our group was up last month and really struggled for anything with any size. Our group's biggest walleye was only 23.5."" It was our first time on the lake, though. We didn't find any numbers until the last day or two. We did not see anyone catch anything big either.NP"
1219070,kgeary,2010-07-14 12:08:00,88,Hi Teddi I am a bit busy taking pics of fish. Way too busy and no need to photoshop any I have had time to update the reports Bartfire put up the link but here it is again.http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/
