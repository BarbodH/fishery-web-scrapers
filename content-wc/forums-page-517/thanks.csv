We were out and back in 15 minutes. As soon as we left, 3 boats with Minnesota tags moved onto the spot and put out markers. Did I say we were in 2 to 3 ft. waves? When we returned, the other boats apologized for moving in. Said that due to the waves they didn't see our marker. I invited them to fish the spot with us. What a great experience - to fish around others who wern't antagonistic about territory on the lake. Minnesotans, if you see this, thanks for the great attitude. Gotta love Lac Seul - fat walleyes and lots of 'em."

Lots of laughter, congratualtions on big fish, back and forth banter and sometimes we even end up back at the cabin together for a cold one. Fishermen, for the most part, are the best of people."
