2403409,adempsey,2014-01-30 17:20:00,963,The times I fished them in the summer I used three way rigs trolling a spoon (I like the Lucky Strike Half-Wave Spoon). Very basic set-up with my spinning gear since I don't fish deep water lakers in the summer very often. The last time I went I think I ended up using 5 ounces of bell sinkers to get down to 65-70 FOW with 20lb braid.My buddy used steel line with a snap-on weight.We both catch fish.
2403553,zeebee,2014-01-30 18:01:00,1144,"I start my Laker fishing in mid July when they have moved into the deep basins on the lake and congregate. I fish off downriggers only (have a portable for fly-ins) and use only 1 lure...a 5"" Len Thompson firetiger spoon. This combo slays the lakers and I generally outfish jiggers 5:1 with bigger fish to boot. Lakers are in many case your best bet for a trophy as they are a relatively underfished species. Spend the few bucks a cheap portable rigger will set you back...its worth every cent."
2404185,JayM5209,2014-01-30 20:33:00,1050,"Sportdog, you'll thoroughly enjoy your time at Lost Bay Resort and Cliff Lake. Here are my preface points: - While no expert, I've fished Cliff Lake for 36 years, staying at a camp up the road but always spending at least a day on Cliff, and for the last three years I've done an extra week at Lost Bay, either 1st week of the season or in Sept. - You'll catch lakers, plus a musky or two, and some big walleyes. - Prov1800 knows the lake. Be sure to read his advice. - My trips to Canada are primarily for 'eyes, but I've developed a love of lake trout fishing that now rivals the need to find walleyes and Cliff is one of my three favorite lakes for trout.Here are my suggestions: - Early in the season the lakers are shallow and we do all our fishing long lining various Rapalas and Canadian Wigglers. My old standards are silver, black/silver, blue. One year green was the killer color, last year during opening week you couldn't keep lakers off anything blue. - Keep it simple!!! Leave the lead core at home. In July jig 'em up from 50'-75' down in up to 90' FOW. The white jigs and tube jigs already mentioned are great. Also have several heavy silver or blue/silver spoons. I use Little Cleos in several sizes and the silver/pearl Crocodile. Finally, my favorite jigging lure for lakers is a large blade bait - natural lead/silver, blue/white, or red/white. - If you like to troll, take a portable down rigger if you have one. Otherwise use a three-way rig. Check out the excellent info on this technique in the fishing tips material at http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/.Have a great trip and be sure to post a trip report when you get home!"
2405153,Guest,2014-01-31 08:06:00,0,"We fish niagra river fron February tio may. Simple 3 way drift or slow troll with a minnow or lure. We hammer them, and get sizes from 1 - 35 pounds."
2409185,Guest,2014-02-01 15:46:00,0,Tactics for lakers would depend on the lake. I fish Lake Simcoe almost every day for lakers. There is a variety of techniques that are tried and true depending on how aggressive the fish are. Lipless cranks first thing in the morning changing to swim baits if they won't hit the cranks and finally to dead sticking pearl tubes. Here is a technique that has caught hundreds of fish for me over the past 3 yearshttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfw7...&feature=share
2409193,Guest,2014-02-01 15:48:00,0,Did I mention these techniques are through the ice?
2410249,Sportdog,2014-02-01 23:27:00,6735,"Time of year, June 21st to June 28th. I'm guessing that they will no longer be shallow. My electronics aren't very good as far as ID of fish on or near bottom. When you guys talk about reefs I assume that you mean what I call submerged humps. I like the idea of jigging with large tubes but I'm guessing that you have to ID the fish or have a very specific location for that, which is why I was thinking in terms of trolling to cover more water. Yeah I know, lots of guessing and assuming on my part. LOL!!!"
2400801,Sportdog,2014-01-30 00:22:00,6735,"I plan to spend at least one day targeting Lake Trout on this years Canadian fishing trip and would like to know who fishes for them in Canadian lakes, what do you do to locate, and what set-ups do you use. I've thought about taking a couple of lead-core reels and running some cowbells with spoons or live minnow on the end. Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks."
2401097,prov1800,2014-01-30 06:24:00,5010,"Many ways to fish for lake trout in Canada. Depending on time of year. Ice out we locals soak of shore, could troll shallow.jig for them, mid summer down diggers, long line trolling.just need to see where they are hiding according to water temps.then experiment.my favorite is tube jigging them, thats the most exciting to me.love watching them come up off the bottom on my sonar to intercept my tube."
2401241,packpro,2014-01-30 07:04:00,695,"In the spring they will be shallow. As the water warms up they move to deep spots. Local knowledge will be best for finding them. Our pattern is after dinner. There is a 60 ft. hole just off the side of a sunken island. The set up.... white 1 oz large head jigs with a long hook shank. A 6 in. twister tail, tip the rig with minnows (one or two). Drop it to the bottom and jig. Big swinging jigging action. You will want to add a swivel to the rig at this type of fishing is going to twist your line, especially mono, It will drive you crazy the next day. You want the lure kicking up the bottom to draw attention. In our lake. They turn on in the hole for about an hour. Then cocktails on the front porch."
2401281,btmbncr,2014-01-30 07:19:00,492,"White Hair jig,strip of sucker meat,fish the shallow reefs."
2401353,troutwater,2014-01-30 07:39:00,299,"I'd be interested to hear the early July tactics myself since I'll be on Cliff at that time. I've only caught 1 lake trout in my life, and it hit a large bucktail in 20 feet of water running 3 inches under the surface week of 4th of July when it was about 90 outside. I thought that was kind of unusual."
2401569,prov1800,2014-01-30 08:34:00,5010,"Trimester, sounds like you might be staying at lost bay resort.I guide for them sometimes and they let me launch there also.great camp very peacefully and a awesome lake.as you read in my post I like to jig for lakers there.around early july I catch them from 30-60 ft.I have a hds-8 which helps me locate them near the bottom or higher up in the bait fish schools.if there near the bottom i drop a 3/8 oz white tube jig with a strip of sucker meat on it (wont come off)i will see it going down on the sonar and if its a aggressive fish you have spotted beleive me it will come up and slam that lure they like bait above them.if the fish doesnt come up right away keep the lure 10-20 ft above it and keep jigging.if it makes a move you will have jig up and reel up.if you spot bait schools and see lakers around the school or around it i just bury the lure in the school and jig those are the most agressive strikes.trolling willwork with long lining or down riggers but then your not really fishing in my book.nothing like having the rod in your hand.cliff lake has hundreds of spots to fish.a good medium rod and a spinning reel work best, braided line with a flouracarbon leader about 6 ft long double uni knot so you can reel all the way into your rod guides.try the blue power pro ice fishing line.that blue color disappears in the water.good luck.s"
2401705,HeHooksHimself,2014-01-30 08:56:00,725,"C:\Users\jwalker1\Desktop\Bob #18 - 31 in. Lake Trout .jpgI hope this link opens for you. It is a pic of a 31"" laker that Dunkin' Bob caught, a very typical fish that we pull from Wine Lake. We go early because trout like this and bigger are flopping around in the shallows and we can pull them up by trolling perch colored and/or blue crankbaits or casting jig and twister into the shore. Biggest have been caught by Doc, 2@ 34 1/2, both of which I netted. My PB is 32"" We also catch pretty big (in the 20""s) whitefish that are also shallow. If the walleye bite is slow or we are tired of pulling up large walleye we begin to target these mamas or large pike."
2401793,zeebee,2014-01-30 09:25:00,1144,What time of year are you going...makes all the difference with Lakers? One cant answer the question otherwise.
2401809,northernbite,2014-01-30 09:33:00,1186,"This plus a spinner blade, hook and sucker meat, gotta love that sucker meat. Also there nothing like jigging a trout in 80 foot of water. On grill in early ice out mmmm good. paul"
2402225,fishinnut,2014-01-30 11:56:00,642,If you want to jig for trout the old Bomber Slab spoons work great. I troll for them using snap weights and blue/silver/wht rapalas. Drop it down till it hits bottom and crank it up a bit. Amazing how those snap weights stay attached to the line even when you're constantly bumping bottom.
