2366482,castnblast,2014-01-19 21:36:00,111,"In my experience, day in day out bait will out fish gulp. There are days plastics out fish organic no question. Also, in my experience bigger fish fall to cranks."
2367257,Pooch,2014-01-20 09:35:00,4619,"With just a little different take. I love trolling so I might be a little biased, but my experience has proven to me over and over again that I will catch fewer, but larger fish trolling anything than I can jigging most, but not all of the time. At the end of the day I will usually have just as many if not more ""pounds"" of fish in the boat than my jigging buddies.Last year was different. It was just simply more of a jig bite on all three trips to Canada we made. Only about one out of every three days did trolling out fish jigging.Gulp vs. Live? Tougher bite...live bait. Aggressive bite...plastic because my line will be back in the water faster and I'm not constantly checking to see if I still have bait. Usually you can tell if live bait is sill on the hook by the feel, but not reliably.Gulp and others? Waste of money for me. Some guys not.Pooch"
2373881,iowafishingdude,2014-01-22 12:05:00,9,"Although I haven't been able to get out as much as I'd like the past several years, I've found that I really enjoy casting with Gulp! Alive minnows (they used to have red, don't see that listed anymore) on a 1/8 or 1/4 inch jig headhttp://www.berkley-fishing.com/produ...rub-gulp-alive Part of the reason is that my father and younger brother enjoy vertical jigging, and when you have an 11 year old in the boat, you tend to run through minnows pretty quick So to save on minnows I experimented with casting a gulp minnow and working it across the bottom, and have gotten to a point that I can regularly outfish (and outsize) most people in our party who stick to vertical. Also, I enjoy a bit more active fishing, and I feel that our party is able to more thoroughly cover an area when I'm casting as I can hit outlier spots or occasional spots where new groups of fish are sitting or have moved to."

Re: my claim of fishing supremacy...as a lodge owner I have come to enjoy my own rhetoric...almost to the point of believing it myself. In my defense though, there is more to any one technique than just ""jigging up and down"" or driving aimlessly with a crank bait attached...and of course we all stick with what works for us and is the most enjoyable. (30 years of jigging?) Thank you Breezy Point and Pooch for rushing to my defense."
2375977,Mr Ranger,2014-01-23 07:00:00,272,"I would agree with the posts that say they both work equally well but definitely agree that the biggest fish come on gulp. Now one element that enters into my choice is if I feel that some kind of twister tail is a benefit then I use live minnows. This is usually 75% of the time. Sometimes a little bit of live bait gives the scent to close the deal and the tail does the attracting. Likewise the large 5"" gulp works best on the larger baits that we throw at times."
2418785,millelacskk,2014-02-04 14:19:00,37,"When we go to Ontario (Sioux Narrows) for a week, we ALWAYS bring salted/frozen bait. The lodge we go through charges $12/dozen for minnows. That's right, $1 per minnow. Imagine catching 80 fish a day at $1/minnow, plus losing at least half that many. We've found that the salted and frozen bait works better than GULP, but you go through a lot of it because they tend to fall apart rather easily. However, we still catch a bunch and pay a third of what we'd pay for live bait."

Pricy in Canada and it is raee you get more than 12 to a dozen as they are usually counted individually. In MN near where I live they price by the dozen and give you a scoop sometimes more than you need! I'd take some along try 'em and save a bit of $$$ if they work for you 3-4"" same size as curly tails you might use with jig hit bottom and wind up til just off bottom look out!! Have fun.

1436136,Guest,2012-05-16 08:17:00,0,"We did a controlled experiment on this topic a few years ago. Were anchored in a spot on the English River, tossing jigs with minnows and letting them drift slowly downstream. We were getting a walleye on half the casts. Then we ran out of minnows and had to use Gulp, 3 inch white grubs. Fishing exactly the same spot and same way, we now got fish on 25% of the casts. So the Gulp was half as effective as live minnows, in this particular scenario."

2354802,BreezyPoint,2014-01-15 15:42:00,1581,"I have to say that I catch an awful lot of walleyes trolling crank baits in shallow waters (4-10 feet) all summer, even when everyone else is drowning live bait in 25+ feet of water. And I have caught ALL of my 27 inch or larger walleyes this way, some of them at high noon on a bright summer day, so v-bay is not out of line here."

1435057,tv4fish,2012-05-14 08:13:00,2694,"Most of our fishing (jigging) is done by using a controlled drift -- once we find the depth that the fish are in - I use the trolling motor to try and hold us at that depth as we drift over our spots. The Gulp Alive minnows are hooked just like we hook a live minnow - up through the bottom of the jaw. We use a vertical ""lift and drop"" presentation. You can tell pretty easily when it gets picked up by a walleye. Just a thought ??? - When I talk about using Gulp - I am now talking about the ""Gulp Alive"" (the stuff in the juice) - NOT plain Gulp."

But, the boys and I have been doing the week trip since 1985 and found that vertical jigging has worked the best for walleyes ""up there"". We don't fish them that way here on Mille Lacs, however."
1435226,Dodger31,2012-05-14 14:16:00,18,"I have tried Gulp many times on LOTW to very sketchy results. I know I haven't given it enought time. It's tough when the other guy in your boat is kickin your a$$ on crawlers and leeches to give Gulp a lot of time. I have had a lot of bumps and bites but not a lot of fish. The minnows are getting really expensive up there so we are always looking for a way to catch fish w/o live bait. We bring more crawlers than we used to.In response to the earlier post about trolling....I LIVE for the walleye ""Thump"" on a jig. In my opinion there is nothing like jigging for walleyes when they are ""on."" ONE MORE MONTH TO GO!"
1435301,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-05-14 17:05:00,27,"We fish the gulp baits both ways, vertical and casting with good results. we do not nose hook it like a live minnow, however, instead threading it up the shank of the hook the same way you would rig a plain ol twister tail. my preferred method with gulp, though, is to make long casts, let it settle to the bottom, and do the old pop, pop, drop all the way back. just twitch it once or twice to make it look alive and let it fall back to bottom and repeat. when the fish are hitting it they tend to ""crush"" it a lot more than they would a live minnow. it can also work very well on bottom bouncers and spinner rigs, use a 3 inch gulp minnow or a 4 inch gulp crawler in place of the real thing. like i said in the previous post, we have done excellent on this stuff but there are still those times when nothing beats the real thing!"

LOL What's weird is I can hammer them on Trigger X but not on Gulp. Call me old school but give me a plain grub and a half a crawler and I will bring fish home. I can't say that I have ever had an instance where gulp or any type of artifical ""scented"" bait has out produced live bait. There is something about having a nice piece of meat on your jig."

1434631,RapShad,2012-05-13 04:36:00,76,I was with you live baiters for the past 10 or so years... Fishing Lac Seul and the MAPB lakes the last several years has really got me hooked (pun intended) on Gulp! Use the 3 inch Chartreuse/White (sometimes orange) Minnow grub and hold on! We jig them and also casting can be very effective for all species. I caught a 41.5 inch Northern on 6# test in Lac Seul a few years ago casting into the rocks for smallies. Took home my master angler patch and converted to a Gulp! follower. Not saying that live bait is irrelevant but the Gulp! works and can be more effective and efficient than drowning worms and dragging minnows. If you're a skeptic give it a good honest try for a whole day or two and see what you think.
1434727,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-05-13 09:50:00,27,"we catch a majority of our jigging fish every year on gulp. there is definately a time and place for live bait but overall gulp allows us to both save money and catch more fish. we always have both in the boat every day and let the fish dictate what to throw. when fishing is good and they are biting aggressively gulp works just as good or better and you can catch way more fish and save a ton of money by not having to dip into the bait well every other minute. that being said when the fish are in a neutral/negative mood(mid day in flat calm/sunny condition, post cold front, etc.) nothing will beat a live minnow. but i would say that about 75% or so of our walleyes caught while jigging are caught on gulp every year, and we have gotten more confident in the plastics over the years. just my 2 cents."
1434836,drlee,2012-05-13 16:16:00,409,"When you use gulp minnows for jigging...drifting? anchored? how do you hook the bait? When I troll i still use the old bead/chain sinkers (1/2 oz) and a #2 single hook little joe rig tipped with a minnow or part of a crawler...when I troll with cranks (2 treble hooks, I assume?) I worry about tearing up the fish since we release most of what we catch. I do flatten the barbs on ALL of my hooks...mostly to protect the fish, but also because a buried hook in your body can really screw up a trip! BTW...I use salt minnows and very rarely have I had to go to live bait to catch plenty of walleye...only time I can recall was on Gullrock. Otherwise, I have used them on a variety of ontario lakes with great success...no muss, no fuss, very cheap (about a dollar or less a dozen)."
1428401,BenBeattie,2012-04-30 06:12:00,232,"If the bite is 'on' you don't need live bait - gulp works great. If the fish are negative/neutral live bait will outfish artificials everytime. I've also seen plenty times when the bite is on that large 4"" gulp will help select larger fish compared to smaller minnows. I never go without livebait, and I always have some gulp in the boat too."
1428450,v-bay gord,2012-04-30 07:47:00,3168,"O.K.....I'll bite and stir the pot by saying that I feel pretty condident I could outfish someone using live bait by trolling crankbaits such as a Rapala Taildancer, or even a Mepps #4, and I can pretty much guarantee my fish will be larger. My only criteria would be that it would not be too late in the season, with walleyes still in the 0-20 foot range. I would also say that I would be having more fun as opposed to ""drowning a minnow""! Of course I have been proven wrong before, but I would still rather catch 20 fish trolling as opposed to 100 on bait. I welcome all challengers!!"

That being said, I have no desire to troll for much smaller fish while in Canada since I can consistently catch fish in the 20-30lb range at home. For me jigging is the way to go! As for Gulp! vs. live minnows, I have to agree that minnows are generally the ""go-to-choice"" for catching numbers of walleye. However, the past few years my group has fished the English River, and different areas at various times of the day were much different to fish. During the middle of the day when the sun was high, it seemed that Gulp! would usually outfish live bait, or there would be no difference between the two. Sometimes with the Gulp! we had to switch to vertical jigging to work, but we were always able to catch fish on it. At dusk in our favorite honey hole, however, minnows outfish live bait on a scale of like 5 to 1. So now, everyone in our group uses Gulp! all day and saves the minnows for the last 2-3 hours to make them last for the grand finale each day."

1428231,pikeman14,2012-04-29 18:07:00,144,"During my last trip to canada, we found a couple ""honey holes"" where we would see which boat could catch the most walleye in 5 minutes. Live bait always worked for us, but the process of re-baiting your hook after every bite, and the limited supply of bait we flew in was a negative. I switched to gulp baits because they were more durable. I was able to keep using the gulp bait to catch multiple fish before tending the hook.I do believe that the live bait reaction was better than the gulp. But when on a remote trip, where the fish are constantly biting....gulp is nice to have for a backup.Has anyone tried salted minnows? I've only recently heard of this method."
1428254,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-29 18:37:00,235,"My own experimenting this past summer on Okanse showed that a regular old twister/grub tail worked as well as well as a Gulp minnow. I found the Gulp leeches to be near worthless (though I recommend the bungee leeches). Salted minnows work great for our group too, so much so that we no longer bring the live ones. We bring some leeches too for occasional bobber fishing, which is mostly off the dock. If they're biting, it doesn't matter what you use...it's more fun to see what they WON'T hit sometimes."
1428286,octanehi5,2012-04-29 19:46:00,1104,"In my time I have found live bait to be the best, Gulp alive is very good , I think trigger X is a little better than the gulp, but when the bite is on many things work well. I have also found that if you put a nice worm glo night crawler on with the gulp or trigger x you may find it hard to keep the jig in the water. Try useing a gulp bait on your jig and a leech on a stand off hook one foot above that, you may get a few double wammies. Now I have givin you some great trade info"
1428329,TroyMansfield,2012-04-29 20:35:00,92,"live bait is by far better day in and day out, you can catch more on artificial in some cases, just casue of rebaiting time, but you fish all day, take the live bait, Ive proven it day in day out on Lac Seul and Lake St.Joe, you will still catch more fish on the real thing, I like the yellow twister tails better then gulp myself, yellow or white work good, but I prefer the yellow, Id say if your flying somewhere remote and its hard to keep live bait, then go with artificial for that case. I do have groups that all they fish with is plastics and they do really well. But on Lake St joe all you really need is a hook and youll catch fish"

1428342,michigan walleye guy,2012-04-29 20:51:00,95,"My experiences in Canada have shown that Gulp (or other plastics) works great in current areas, or in situations where you are able to troll or drift a bit quicker than normal. But it does not ""outfish live bait,"" not even close. Our group always brings an ample supply of live minnows, but by the 4th day or so of a 6-day trip, we're out of live bait, and need to count on the plastics (or crankbaits). Someone mentioned the old bungee leeches, I always had great luck with those things. Northland Tackle's Mimic Minnows are also great choices, although they are a bit pricey.I'm also going to try the advice of many and bring some salted minnows this year.Less than 5 weeks till we're off to Larus Lake! Can't wait......"
1428362,Limeyangler,2012-04-29 22:27:00,563,Like lots of others have said...it does not outfish live bait. I live up here and have done the test with gulp minnows versus live minnows many times on many different lakes from lac Seul to small off the beaten track back lakes. Gulp works....but live works better. but bring the gulp as back up...you can run out of bait fast up here!
