2426450,jimmie,2014-02-06 18:38:00,123,Have him take a nap. Buy him a camera or hit a beacxh and have him search for animal tracks. Take a picture of 'em and have him look them all up when he gets home. Make a listm of what might be there in the area and cross them off each trip. The memories are more important than the fish you'll catch. The fish he catches is what he'll recall the most and will get bigger and bigger as time goes by . . just like ours do. lol Taking your son along can be trying at early ages but he's learning and growing when he's ten or twelve he be able to keep up with most adults and be really excited about trying to outfish you. Have fun regardless. My litttle grandson 9 gets frustrat4d as his older brothers fish and fish all day long so he may have a year or two to go until he can get totally absorbed as we older folks do. Giove him small duties and responsibilities along the way like casting off and then securing the boat with knots taught by his dad. Then you can teach him to clean his catch when he's ready and safety has been welded into his brain in all facets of the great sport of fishing. !!! Teach him (at proper age) to Google and look up different resorts and areas to consider for future fishing trips. Have fun and good luck in your adventures together. You will never regret it!!
2401769,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 09:16:00,1528,Anybody been there? Looking at possibly taking a 2nd trip and taking my 8 year old and my brothers 16 year old with us. Any other lodges you know that have good discounts for children?I'm also intrigued by using either Colin Gosse or Ben Beattie as a guide if we go to Moosehorn. Thanks
2401865,prov1800,2014-01-30 09:47:00,5010,How are you guys.its fishguide.had to register.colin and ben definatly would be a great choice.lots of water upthere and they know it
2402609,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 13:36:00,1528,"WE are good. I'm trying to get a 2nd trip to take kids. Our normal ""guys"" trip is still in September. It hasn't been decided yet but I'm assuming Onaway again."
2402801,prov1800,2014-01-30 14:27:00,5010,Well if you need anything you can get a hold of me.
2412441,btyreprich,2014-02-02 16:39:00,1067,Our group went to this lodge several times when it was owner by Jeff and Heather. They have since sold it and retired to Alabama. Said they were tired of harsh winters. I do not know the current owners. Lodge itself is on a good section of Lac Seul and we always caught our limits. Nice that it is close to Sioux Lookout for any of your trip needs or just to visit one evening. I also remember the Smallmouth Bass fishing to be good in that general area. Wish I could help you out more.

This is a smaller 9 cabin lodge, that has many repeat customers, their friends and family. It seems that none of them use this board, as I've been waiting to see a response here. For some references you can visit my Testimonial Page or send me a PM."
2414065,papasprengel,2014-02-03 09:15:00,4,"Was at Moosehorn last Sept. with my wife. Linda Rice aka MUSKIE MAMA is the owner of the camp. Super operation with some fantastic fishing. A day on LacSuel was non stop walleye fishing. A day on Big V was lake trout, smallies and northern, also fantastic with great numbers. I've heard it said many times buy many people, ""A bad day on LacSuel is a good day anywhere else"". Very True. Don't think you can find better walleye fishing. Good group of people."
2415169,SinOrSwim,2014-02-03 12:31:00,1528,"Question about boat rides and lakes. You can PM me if you would like. A big concern with my 9 year old would be boat rides and fishing time. He loves to fish but we usually fish off the back of my houseboat. Thus, he doesn't have to sit and sit. He can pop into the cabin and grab drinks, snacks and watch TV. He isn't the type of kid who has to have video games all the time by any means but I am concerned if there are long trips to hit spots, what happens if things are slow? Can't just come back to the cabin and go back out. If he is catching fish, I won't be terribly worried but at the same time a 8 or 10 hour day in a boat might be a bit much?Do you typically boat to these other lakes or drive and launch?Last thing I want to do is be ""that parent"" that brings along an ipad or something for him in the boat. Completely goes against what I want to do."
2416617,SeulAreaWalleye,2014-02-03 18:37:00,100,"Boat rides can vary from 5 minutes to an hour max, depending on time of year, weather, and lake. Whatever it takes to be on the fastest action everyday, especially with kids along. Everything is accessible right from the lodge dock, except for Big V, which is only a 10 minute trailer ride down the hwy. Days commence at 7am, so most kids get in the boat half asleep after breakfast, nap then wake up and slam the fish! At shore lunch they are busy running around and exploring, etc. We take priority in keeping the young ones busy all day, and 99% of the time they sleep all of the way home. Fresh, clean air knocks them right out. Many trips with many kids of all ages, never a problem or worry. Even the wives are well behaved on my trips...lol Most parents have concerns like this before the experience here."
2417513,SinOrSwim,2014-02-04 06:29:00,1528,Thanks Colin!!! I'm really looking forward to getting a second trip figured out and think my son will absolutely love it.
