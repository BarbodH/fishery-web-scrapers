I really enjoy popping in and catching up on the news.I just received a link to a YouTube Lake Trout catch that just happened in the area of my old cabin.It really captures the heart and soul of why we do this.http://youtu.be/AzsyuFJIBpYEnjoy!

2414769,BreezyPoint,2014-02-03 11:04:00,1581,"That was a very big fish, but I don't understand how they can say it is a record fish."
2414785,big popi,2014-02-03 11:05:00,635,"Wolfwasp, do you know where this was caught exactly? it said near Atikokan, we have been fishing Marmion & the floodwaters since '72. I assumed it must be Clearwater West or possibly White Otter."
2417377,Wolfwasp,2014-02-04 02:31:00,9,"Yes hobedog it was up around Sanford-White Otter. But have you ever looked at how many lakes there are on just one map up there? And most of them have Lakers. I fished that area most of my life and I would not be surprised to tie into a fish like that even in one of the unnamed lakes. I agree with BreezyPoint, it is not a record. More like a career high, but what a great thing to have happen when you are fishing with your son. I am glad for them. Can you imagine if our Dads had smart phones? I still have a very old album with black and white pictures of my Dad and friends. I would love to have seen the video on some of them."
