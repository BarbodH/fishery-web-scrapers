Both are located on the western side of the Gouin which contains many smaller bays which permit fishing on windy days. Most outfitters supply boats that are up to the task...don't worry about the wind, especially in July."

Not sure what to compare it to. 6 inches more water when we were there in late june would have really helped us get into some of the bays for pike. As it was, we lifted the motor and poled around with the oars. Pike were in there around the trees in 1 foot of water, sometimes less. Found the most fish in the deeper pockets of such bays. I have mentioned before we caught about 60 in one spot that we found up to 40"". We were using Wounded Spook, largest Torpedo lure, another prop bait like that and just fished surface. Probably other lures that are weedless like soft plastics would perform well in the timber. Camp manager can point out those bays to you. Tamarac has some camps scattered around. We stayed in one cabin in a group of cabins in the teens for a number. The good bays were across the lake to the south but there are many to choose from every day. Hopefully the water will be up and you can get into all of them easier than we did. There was a spot called the Lunch Box in a narrow channel where you can catch plenty of walleye for dinners. Never failed in there and it is close to camp."

Does anyone know anywhere in the area that is actually better for Pike than Walleyes? Sounds odd to most, but once we limit out on the Walleye we want to fish more for Pike for a different experience than back home. Likely using Tamarac, but would like some veterans opinions.Thanks."

2428130,csmith,2014-02-07 09:20:00,6,"I think I phrased my question poorly, I was looking more for information regarding whether the Gouin was the best choice for Pike, Vs. places like Lake Herbert, Charlotte, or Bob lake.How is the Gouin in bad weather?, is it easy to escape the wind when it gets blowing?Thanks again guys."
2428202,Guest,2014-02-07 09:42:00,0,"When I was there a few years ago we stayed at some cabins in a sheltered area that was narrow, so there were places to fish near camp cause it was super windy one day and that is where we went. There are large open areas to cross getting to the farther away sheltered areas that we fished later when not as windy. There are a good amount of shallow bays filled with trees, how shallow depending on the water level at the time. Was lots of pike in there in late June. I would not say there are huge amounts of pike in Gouin lying everywhere, but there are known spots for them and some weeds available in July as well. I don't think we caught that many jigging for walleye, but we did get a few."
2428770,csmith,2014-02-07 12:13:00,6,"Thank you Waldorf, being blown off the lake was definitely a concern of ours, as long as we can get some shelter I'm sure we will be fine. If the group thinks that its a good place to target pike then I'm good with that, probably the first guy here looking more for pike anyhow.."
2428818,canyon,2014-02-07 12:28:00,37,You can almost always find somewhere to fish even in high winds. This will be the 5th year on Gouin and we are yet to stop fishing due to winds. With that being said waves can get big on the open water there. Some common sense will keep you out of trouble and will find you calmer waters.Have fun on the Gouin! We mainly fish for pike up there and sub in the walleye when fishing is slow or we want a change of pace.
2429170,Freytown,2014-02-07 14:32:00,770,"Smithy, there are lots of drive-ins on the Gouin too. Actually most are drive-ins and then you don't need to worry about weight limits. The Gouin area was heavily timbered in the 90's and new roads were created to most areas. IMO, if your going into the Gouin....drive. Good luck on your trip...the area is beautiful."
2429450,csmith,2014-02-07 15:41:00,6,"Thanks for the advice, I wasnt aware of that being a good option! Would you know of any of the outfitters that run the drive in camps? I've done a lot of research online, but the words of fellow fishermen over outfitters carries a lot of weight to it. Thanks in advanceDo you know of any of the smaller lakes that produce solid Pike fishing?, we are torn between the bigger water, or finding a smaller lake and having the run of the place."
2430466,canyon,2014-02-08 05:02:00,37,"I have been to two outfitters on the Gouin. The first year we went to L'Aventurier Du Gouin. It was a good place and was just being builtup by the current owners. They are one option. Our go to outfitter is Oasis du Gouin. This will be our fourth year back there. They have quality cabins, boats and motors. The owner, Francois, is a top notch guy and runs a great outfit. The fishing for walleye (in the spring anyways) is right in front of the cabins with mid season locations no more than a 5 min boat ride away. I cannot say enough about the oasis and will return there for years to come. Oh and both of these places are drive in / boat ride to the outfitter. Lots of good choices out there but i can only speak to these two. Hope this helps.PS-Sorry but I don't know of any smaller bodies of water."
2430530,octanehi5,2014-02-08 06:16:00,1104,"I have fished all of the places you mentioned but bob lake. The gouin Is the largest It can get very hairy at times but produces the largest pike of all you listed, Hebert Is next in line,12 miles long great pike and walleye fishing, Can also get very dicey your group can expect 6to 8 fish ovr 40"". Charlotte Smaller lake,wind not a factor, Very nice pike and walleye. its a C & R lake with no fish going home, you can eat what you want while there. As to fly in or drive to, I find that most drive to locations are over fished a lot of pressure put on the fish, Fly ins are a more controled,numbers of people,the lakes do not get hammered,by anyone but those who fly in. You will find Air Tam to be one of the best outfitters in Quebec. This yr will be my 11th yr on Hebert, That should speak for it self"
