I met alot of guys from Walleye central, and a few other sites. For the first 3 days we had a ball talking to everyone about Walleye fishing .Made some new fiends from this site,a few of which booked a few trips to the great north. The NRA has made a big statement about gun ownership at this show, as well as other outdoor sports. the show runs until this next sunday night,biggest outdoors show in the States. If you can get to see it,you will not be disappointed. It was my pleasure to meet all the people I spoke to. Good luck in any venture outdoors OCTANEHI5 AKA Walleye RON"
2419081,Guest,2014-02-04 15:28:00,0,It was good to meet you and talk about our trip in June. I know it sure pumped up my buddies as they look forward to fishing lac Hebert. Benard from Air Tamarac was a good conversation also. One of my buddies is a pilot and is looking forward to sharing the copilots seat on the way in. Hope to see you on the lake.......Ron B
