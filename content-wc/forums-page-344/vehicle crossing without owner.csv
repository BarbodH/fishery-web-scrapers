2422793,rnnonmt,2014-02-05 17:46:00,992,"Crossed last year at FT Francis with a MN plated truck and an AZ trailer and boat. Not even one question from border patrol regarding the truck, trailer or boat. I own the trailer and boat and am an AZ resident. The truck belonged to my father in-law who wasn't even riding with me. Another in our group had an AZ motor home pulling a MN trailer. No questions there either."
2413777,revitup,2014-02-03 08:23:00,140,Hi everyone. Looks like this year our group will be coming through Canada at different times due to flight plans. The owner of one of the vehicles being used wants to go up early in order to get some fishing in the first day. So the vehicle owner's uncles will be taking his car across the border later in the same day that he crosses with me. I am thinking that if he has a notorized letter giving his permission to cross without him that will be enough evidence. Anything else we should do? Thanks in advance.
2413881,Lovetofish,2014-02-03 08:36:00,458,Have the insurance and vehicle registration along too.
2414577,Obabikon,2014-02-03 10:29:00,2370,I've had people do it several times. It isn't a big deal unless the vehicle has been reported stolen.
2417169,unclepaully,2014-02-03 21:20:00,112,I've crossed twice with a vehicle that was not mine and I never said anything and was never asked.(I did have a letter just in case though)
2417425,UKBDM,2014-02-04 05:32:00,178,"I have been using my company truck to pull my boat to and from Ontario for 10 years plus. Never even a question by Canadian customs but usually US customs will ask ""is this your truck?"". My answer is always ""it belongs to the company I work for ..."". I assume they are trying to trip me up but as usual the truth will set you free."
2417809,SinOrSwim,2014-02-04 08:21:00,1528,We take a trailer that isn't ours every year. Never had an issue.
2417897,Fishoil,2014-02-04 08:38:00,1277,My truck is titled and registered to my business and I've never once been asked about the ownership being something other than myself. So I don't think you'll even need any type of documentation.
2418353,emanonmac,2014-02-04 10:59:00,62,A lot of personal use of business vehicles. Hope the IRS isn't reading this even if this use is being reported as personal.
2418465,MrSimon,2014-02-04 11:30:00,922,As always ... be prepared. Make sure all the paperwork is in order and have copies of everything with you. A letter from the owner is a great idea too!!
