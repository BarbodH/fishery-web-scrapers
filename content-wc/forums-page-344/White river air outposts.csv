Specifically the pickle lake outpost Have heard great things about wra but haven't found any info on pickle Is it as numbers lake for walleyes and pike, are there larger fish in the system? It's a small lake (which is fine w our group) 1 mile by 3 miles Cheers Gordy"
2094786,10lbeye,2013-09-10 11:27:00,61,"Gordy: have not done an outpost trip with them but have gone to their signature lake (Esnagi) 3 times and they are a 1st class, top notch group. Unparalled service and attention to detail. They know what they're doing."
2096041,gordy28,2013-09-11 04:56:00,437,Thanks 10lb Very helpful and appreciated
2096297,adempsey,2013-09-11 07:42:00,963,"I've only used the air service once. Never their outposts.Seemed top notch to me. Personally, I wouldn't hesitate to book with them. Several of their camps look incredible. Their deluxe outposts on Esnagi, Hambleton, Gourlay, Nameigos, Pickle and Shikak look like luxury cottages. I'd be there in a heartbeat if the prices were a bit lower, but I bet they are worth the extra cost."
2097697,gordy28,2013-09-11 17:39:00,437,"Thanks Adam - I agree, the reason we are looking at WRA is the deluxe factor - for a few reasons we need electricity for sure but based on the size of our group we are choosing between the smaller ourposts (and I have seen mixed reviews on Hambleton and nothing on pickle or namgeios)- so any perspectives on those lake would be niceOutfitter has indicated that pickle (small lake) is a numbers lake - but easy to pattern due to size and structureCheersGordy"

2373769,gordy28,2014-01-22 11:29:00,437,Totally agree re Dan - he has always answered emails and calls promptly - even though we arent going until August
2378609,Guest,2014-01-23 17:47:00,0,"Have fished McCoy, shikak, and Jembi which I forget but all had good walleye for numbers, 17-20 inch. Largest about 26. McCoy I caught walleye all day long with a jig. Pike were plentiful on all 3. Usually 24-30 inch. Largest usually caught a couple over 36 with largest of 39-40 per week. Air service very good, Cabins, motors good. Boats only 14 foot, 16 would have been nice. Motorrs were 6 hp but ran well. They have improved facilities every year. Would go back. Good luck"
2422049,bullhockey,2014-02-05 14:16:00,41,"me and our three sons have been to several of their outposts. hayward-herrick, gourlay and gahrnam twice. going to gahrnam third time this year. go to south camp only, north camp is very small, I mean very small!!! gthey are a top notch outfit and the fishing on these 3 lakes has been very good. lots of eyes. even in july. the boys like the warmer weaTHER and no bugs !!!! they have never seen a black fly. use to go the first week of june back in 60 and 70 and the fishing was unbelievable. 100 plus eyes a day per man. but the flies were thicker than flies. anyway, you cant go qwrong with WRA"
