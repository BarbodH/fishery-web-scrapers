2403105,Mike Borger,2014-01-30 16:01:00,1554,"There's a ton of info in the archives. Do a search on holinshead for some interesting reading.In general the camp is very highly regarded, don't think I've ever heard a bad word said about it."
2403345,zeebee,2014-01-30 17:02:00,1144,Just to clarify....eastern Ontario is 1000 miles away.
2403369,Whopper,2014-01-30 17:09:00,340,"I have personally fished Holinshead. Lot's of small to medium size walleyes. Don't know how often 100 fish/per person days are but I personally had 30 to 50 fish days. It's a easy lake to fish and offers a little bit of everything as far as structure to fish. I would also question the ""ninety island deal"" maybe a fraction of that. Pike were on the small size, lots of 20 to 26 inch hammers. The cabins were nice, camp boats were ok. I haven't been there since they changed hands and at that time the owners requested you only keep eaters to dine on while there and they gave us our limits per licenses of pre-packaged store bought walleye to take home. Four of us took our sons on a catching trip and the lake did not disappoint. We were even able to take the camps boats to another small lake via a small creek and the kids had a blast in the evenings catching small pike on top water baits. The gravel road of the highway and the camp lane way through woods was a little rough and you had to take it easy. Two of the four guys and their sons still make the trip every August, I have found a few other places to go. Good Luck! Edit: zeebee your are correct , I believe wolf may wanted to say eastern part of NWO :lol:"
2404433,Jarbear,2014-01-30 22:17:00,24,"Wolf, I have been to Holinshead on three different occasions. Its the only camp on the lake. The latest trip was last September. We had a great trip and the new owners are very nice and accommodating. They have done a lot of updates since I was there last, which was also under different owners. The owner will put you on a lot of different fishing spots. They also check on you throughout the week to make sure everything is working good and check to see if you need anything. We did well on Walleye, but the weather was a factor when we where there. There are lots of areas to explore and there are lots of islands. PM me if you have specific questions."
2405697,camp chef,2014-01-31 09:58:00,915,I bear hunted out of Holingshead a couple times back in the early 90's. The fishing was wonderful. It is definately remote and a lake I would love to go back to and just fish.
2407873,Guest,2014-02-01 06:50:00,0,camp chef as always thanks for your input probably going 2-3 week in September from Chicago as always will issue a trip report;black bear camp on red lake last week of may have sent in deposit jim wolf Chicago boys
2413489,Stu,2014-02-03 07:22:00,472,"I have fished Holinshead 3 years in a row and am going back this summer. I can't say anything bad about the lake or the camp. Cabins are very clean and nice. The boats are well-maintained, but a bit small if you're fishing 3 from a boat. Greg and Charlene are the owners and are as nice as anyone I've ever met. He always takes us out on his pontoon when he has free time. We usually have 30-40 fish days, but we don't hit it hard. 100 fish/day is entirely possible, if you get up early and fish all day. His limits are very restrictive (only 2 walleye & 2 northern per day and you can't take anything home), but that's why the fishing is so good. The northerns seem to travel in packs. I've caught lots of 24-30 inchers while jigging for eyes. They were nice and fat, but we don't spend much time fishing for them. Minnows & leeches are the way to go. They sell K Man jigs in the office and they seem to be the ticket. He is also runs VERY successful black bear hunts. You can also PM if you have any questions. You won't be disappointed. Good luck  Stu"
2427162,Guest,2014-02-07 05:01:00,0,stu thanks for your input it sounds good we are definitely going mid September we fish hard 12 hours/day what was the average size of walleyes and can we catch a few 8-10 # northerns jim wolf chcago boys
2427506,Stu,2014-02-07 07:23:00,472,"The average walleyes were 15  16 inches. But EVERYBODY in our group caught 24  28 inchers at least once a day. You should have no problem catching big northerns, especially if you know what you're doing. Also, make sure you fill your tank to the top before you leave Thunder Bay. There is only one gas station between there and the lake and they are not open on a regular basis. I would also take an extra-large anchor; there is a lot of current running thru the lake."
