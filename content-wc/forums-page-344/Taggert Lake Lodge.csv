2384833,Jaskonie,2014-01-25 21:24:00,80,"Check out www.kipawa.net have never heard a bad review about them, have met them at shows but never booked, its on our short list though."

2387945,retire55,2014-01-26 22:13:00,1029,"I've fished Lake Kipawa at least once every year since 2000. Some years I was lucky enough to go twice. My last trip was early Sep 2013. While we caught lots of walleye up to 14 inches, bigger walleye were difficult to find. Other groups on the lake experienced similar results during that time slot. While I have no biological evidence to support any theory, I believe our fishing results were most likely the result of below average spawns in 2008 and 2009. On the other hand, since we caught lots of walleye up to 14 inches in length, a trip to Lake Kipawa might be warranted again in 2016. Regardless the fore going, there are still big walleye (10 pounds or more) swimming in that lake - just not a lot of them. The month of July can be very hot - so hot that many fishermen won't fish for anything between 11 AM and 4 PM. The majority of my trips to Lake Kipawa were either the last week of June or any time in September (Lake Trout closing can impact when you might want to go in September). We did one trip in mid July and never repeated that mistake."
2405745,ctrout,2014-01-31 10:05:00,1,I would caution you on going to this place. I was with a group of 7 and we stayed at the outpost cabin at the end of June 2 years ago. The cabin itself was nice and the boats were decent. The issues we had were with the generator for this cabin (the electric line was poorly wired so we had to hook it back in to the generator) propane tank ran out late one evening so we hooked up another tank. Told the staff the next morning and the owner came out later that day and yelled at some of the guys who came back early for changing the tank. The biggest disappointment was the fishing. We caught 2 walleyes all week. I think we had a few small pike and 2 lake trout. By Friday we had enough of the poor fishing and the unbelievable number of Mosquitos so we packed up and left. Needless to say we don't plan on returning here.

2411057,SinOrSwim,2014-02-02 09:38:00,1528,"Sorry, but I go to Canada to CATCH. That is the whole point"
2411841,Jaskonie,2014-02-02 13:36:00,80,"We go to get away. We can catch all we want on Lake Erie here in Ohio.It sounds like you had a bad experience overall. We have went to places in the past that we had a blast but didn't catch a ton of fish and on the other hand went to a place where we hated the outfitter but slaughtered the fish. I always thought Taggart would be good to try and they look as though they offer a complete package and people report decent fishing there. We have tried a number of places and stayed with our current and 5th outfitter for coming up on our 4th trip to his lodge. We get a ton of walleye and pike, smallmouth on portage lake. Great Cabins on an island. Food is good but boats Motors and live bait are great."
