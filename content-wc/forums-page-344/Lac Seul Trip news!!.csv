Can't wait to try about 4 dozen spots in Mc Kenzie Bay and the main lake basin when the kids get there. Bill aka btmbncr also known as Backtroller Billy"

2423921,BreezyPoint,2014-02-06 07:45:00,1581,I think it's great your daughter is going with you to Lac Seul. My daughter will also be going to Lac Seul with me this summer. I think more guys should get their daughters interested in fishing...they make great fishing partners.
2423961,Mike Kansas,2014-02-06 07:54:00,1463,"My oldest Daughter has gone on a couple trips with me and the ""guys"". It has always worked out great and the guys love to tease her and she gives it back to them in spades. Lots of fun and great memories fishing with her. I started her fishing when she was very little and she loves it. When she graduated from college I asked her what she wanted for a graduation present. She told me two weeks in Canada with Dad. Turned out to be a gift for both of us. Mike Kansas"
2430834,emma17,2014-02-08 08:40:00,436,"I love these father-daughter stories and a big thumbs up for your passion.I remember a year or two ago someone posted a great video (maybe one of you guys) showing photos of the daughter's trips to Canada as she grew up.I'm working on my 14 year old now. I've had her fishing since she was very young, but she won't quite take the bait on a full Canadian fishing trip. Hopefully she'll come around as I know it will be fantastic."
2435626,btmbncr,2014-02-09 20:31:00,492,"Mike Kansas I found out you get more ""over the slot"" fish on Perch scale pattern grenades.If you use ""willie pete"" grenades it steams the walleyes for you.Ready for a little melted butter. But on a more serious note I'm going to have to buy a couple of new rods and reels.Buy at least 4 dozen more crankbaits and I'll have to tie more leaders and spinner rigs.My beer bill is going to go up for the trip.At Christmas my daughter found the last bottle of Kokanee Beer and she and her boyfriend drank it.They loved it and said they can't wait to get to Canada to drink some. Bill"
2435706,zeebee,2014-02-09 20:57:00,1144,"Yup my beer bill went up exponentially when the boys hit legal age....ahh well, my fondest memories with them always seem to reflect back to those trips and, those to come put a smile on my face."
2436434,Mike Kansas,2014-02-10 08:03:00,1463,You are the man.
