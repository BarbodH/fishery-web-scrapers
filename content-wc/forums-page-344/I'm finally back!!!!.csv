2403209,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 16:22:00,1528,"Not sure why I mentioned race in mine? Wasn't our group anyway. Just remember him telling me the story like that.Also, we haven't had any trouble in many years. It is way better now. Not sure what changed?"
2403217,pjshorthorn,2014-01-30 16:27:00,5654,"Crossed over at I-Falls for many years with not too many problems. The one time I thought for sure we would be pulled over for inspection, the customs officer was a young lady and the fella driving pulls up and says "" how you doing Sweetpea ?"" She started laughing so hard she didn't ask any questions and waved us right through......back in the '90s. The time we did get pulled, my father decided to bring too much hooch. As others have said, I always made a list to have everything ready for the officer. Well, I found out Dad was pack'in too much and told the officer this knucklehead decided he wants to pay some duty on Canadian Mist. Of course we get pulled over, but in this case I wanted it to happen. Dad paid his duty and the other fellas got to beat the heck out of him all the way to Sioux Lookout. A little ""chilly"" in the boat that afternoon , but what the heck....he had been mad at me many times before while I was growing up. In my experience, the folks on the US side are much more of a PITA. I just respectfully answer everyone's questions and stare them dead in the eyes when doing so. Just a reminder to everyone to hold on to your Canadian fishing license until you get home. I've been asked many times to show my license regardless of whether I was bringing fish home or not. Happened to me in Winnipeg last year on my way home. I've kept every license as a momento. Attached is one frame of Canadian licenses. Enjoy your trip and the great new memories you'll have.

2404833,tv4fish,2014-01-31 06:57:00,2694,"Let's just say that it certainly DID right after 9-11. On our trips that we made shortly after 9-11, it was very common to see vehicles pulled over that had dark-skinned, bearded members in their group............."
2404905,dutchboy,2014-01-31 07:08:00,5717,"The same way the TSA has a positive or negative affect on a plane flight I can see the Customs agents having the same affect. I want the Canadian customs handling their business the way they deem fit. I really don't think that any agent gets up in the morning and says to themselves ""gee I'm going to piss off as many Americans as possible today"". If as guests into their country we aren't willing to follow their rules to a ""T"" maybe we need to stay home? As far as the US customs..................keep us safe and keep the bad guys out. If it requires detaining people for a time so be it. I've witness enough terror attacks (on TV not in person) to last me a lifetime."
2405145,h8go4s,2014-01-31 08:03:00,1673,"Absolutely. I've done 20+ Canada trips and never had a problem going either way. Know the rules and follow them, be sober and act civilized and you'll be fine."
2406153,2746,2014-01-31 12:00:00,3206,"50+ trips and never been chosen for the random search....I have the same luck buying lottery tickets. glad your starting over and enjoy the trip. Actually, I can't imagine letting a 2.5 hour delay ruin my whole week but I do understand the frustration. With our group it would just become another ""remember when?"""
2406761,Da' Walleye Assassun,2014-01-31 15:47:00,358,Years ago my buddy and I were crossing at Fort Frances. My buddy had a new camcorder and wanted to film the border crossing because it was his first. A good looking female agent went ballistic and started screaming that we did not have permission to film her. As penance we were searched by a nice old guy that seemed embarassed by the whole thing.
2406865,Wall-i-Lama,2014-01-31 16:31:00,1524,"Best not attempt to cross the border (either way) when in possession of an bad ""attitude"". I don't think humor is a good idea either. Some need to learn to humble up an check any baggage well before the crossing."
2410073,Walleyehunter16,2014-02-01 21:10:00,163,Funny had a very similar experience except no ticket or arrest. Just his record showed he was taken to the Police Station. Very frustating. I went on a Duck hunt north of Thunder Bay one year. Showed up with all the docs for both of us followed the rules to the T. Still took more than 2.5 hrs to get thru and they didn't appear happy at all that they let us go on without more of a hassle.
2410985,SinOrSwim,2014-02-02 09:23:00,1528,"We had a new guy with us one year and we were all out sitting in the little lot to the side of the building waiting for the crew to go inside and pay the duty. Two of the guys asked about exchanging money and going to the bathroom. We said we do it across the street. Next thing you know they pop over across the street to use the facilities and exchange some money. Border people come out after duty was paid. Asked where everyone was. Said we had a guy across the street. LOL WRONG ANSWER HANS. Never even crossed our minds it was considered border jumping. But, let me tell you we found out!!!!!"
2400681,Los Pollos Hermanos,2014-01-29 21:53:00,10,"5 years ago we got stopped and had a really bad border experience. Very rude, and 2 hour delay that we had no idea why. At one point we pointed out we were hungry and the guy told us to order a pizza...""it will get here in about 45 minutes"" he said. Really funny considering it was 6:30 AM. Many from my group were so mad from the treatment that they swore to never cross again, and my annual trip ended. I have done some Boundary Waters and other Minnesota trips, but never over the border. I finally have a new group of guys organized and am heading to Gullrock June 7. I am so excited that I have already bought new lures, new line and am ordering a new portable fish finder next week. I'm really hoping this goes well so it turns into an annual trip and not one and done. Please schedule the ""A"" team at the border June 7 please!!!!"
2401329,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 07:31:00,1528,My only helpful advice is to be careful with your blue meth hidden in the batter. LOL
2401337,tv4fish,2014-01-30 07:32:00,2694,"FWIW: I DO believe it is better crossing the border now (JMHO). But, I hear ya' - years ago some of the ""personnel"" really had an attitude. More than once - the thought crossed my mind to get their name and ""report"" them -- although I really didn't think it would have done ANY good. But, I wished I would have had a camcorder recording some of them for proof........Regardless - Glad you're planning to go back and here's hoping you DO have a good trip and border crossing."
2401625,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 08:37:00,1528,"Agreed, it has gotten way better over the years. I think it has turned completely opposite. When we first started going up in the early 90's, crossing into Canada was awful. Get pulled to the side, sit there as they ""check"" stuff, parade some guy through that is getting turned away and they were just rude and sort of threatening. In a ""I have the power to cancel your trip"" threatening.Now, I think coming back into the USA is worse. We have had a couple times in the last few years where the guy was a jerk. Trying to trick us into saying we had fish when we didn't etc. Asking the same question multiple times in multiple ways to try and trip you up. For instance he asked us 3 times if we had any fish. Then, after making all his comments he said soemthing like, okay so it's just the 4 of you and the fish you have...........pause...............I said I don't have any fish and he acted like he was upset his trick didn't work. Next thing you know we are over in the xray building."
2401937,billy weaver,2014-01-30 10:16:00,470,Been crossing at International Falls every June for 30 years never had a problem. Officers are usually very friendly. We all have our passports out and ready and answer their questions. Otherwise we keep our mouths shut. What crossings do you have problems with?
2402001,thyme to fish,2014-01-30 10:36:00,307,"knock on wood, but 30 yrs ive been crossing, I ALWAYS bring ALL the docs, and they NEVER ask me for more than a passport and very kind polite and quick...... ill keep going,,,,,,,,,,,,,fish on....."
2402193,tv4fish,2014-01-30 11:48:00,2694,"The same one that you use - I Falls. As I said - it appears to have gotten better over the years. And FYI - we are clean-shaven white Caucasians and have always had our required documentation - it has boiled down to the officers on duty and the ""mood"" that they were in. FYI - we have always gone in on Saturday around noon and come out at about the same time."
2402385,Los Pollos Hermanos,2014-01-30 12:42:00,10,"We have always went through International Falls. Radio off. Windows down. Owner of the car driving across border holding ID's for everyone. A list of what we are claiming so there is not confusion how much alcohol we have. Got stopped and searched one time which was way too long of a delay. I am aware they have a job but man were they rude. Straw that broke camels back was getting stopped and we were the random car that gets everyone's name run through the computer. No issue as we are all upstanding citizens, no one ever arrested. Turns out that back in the late 70's or early 80's, one of our group got a ticket for open alcohol for drinking while talegating in the street when he was in college. I guess he was supposed to stay in the parking lot and he went walking with his beer. That somehow pulled up when they ran his name. As it was an alcohol offense the border guys assumed it was a DUI and wanted $200. He refused, denied ever having a DUI and here we go. After arguing and bad attitudes, they had to call the police department for his college town finally to figure this out. They still had him do some type of paperwork where he had to acknowledge an alcohol offense but he did not have to pay the $200. We were stuck there for well over 2.5 hours. We did catch a lot of fish that year, but guys were so mad they have never gone back. Figure we were dropping $800 per guy at a Lac Seul resort for 6 to 8 guys per year, plus bait, food, beer.....this really cost some money to some Canada resort."
2402593,SinOrSwim,2014-01-30 13:34:00,1528,"We have had a few trips where we weren't treated very well. Nothing horrendous but just attitude. We have also been lied to with them telling us if we had more than X cases of beer we needed a commercial liquor license etc. We have been pulled into the office a couple times to sit and wait and wait. This was all pre-passport days. But, there was definitely an attitude there.I spoke to a guy at Bass Pro one day when I was buying a Navionics chip. He went up when he was young 30+ years ago and they got pulled over. All young 20's white males crossing early morning. Had been driving most of the night. They got stopped and because of their age and blood shot eyes were told to pull over. They took apart his truck. Door panels, seats, everthing. Said, okay you are good to go. Truck half dismantled. They have never been back. Whether that is true or not, who knows? lol"
2403081,kzoofisher,2014-01-30 15:47:00,5144,"Crossed the border eight times at five different locations this year and never had any problems. One customs agent asked a couple extra questions but that was it. Never had any trouble fishing the Detroit river either and we cross back and forth all day long. I'm curious, two posters have mentioned race in regards to crossing, have you noticed it making a difference? I'm white if I want to be but can just as easily and honestly be non-white, at least in a legal sense. I do have a *foreign* sounding name, as does my wife who is a real Aryan (not like those German wannabes) and my kids do, too. My wife has dual citizenship but it has never been a problem and I'm eligible for it and am considering getting it for myself and the kids. BTW, the main reasons to get it would be ease of traveling in Europe and saving on visas that US citizens have to pay."
