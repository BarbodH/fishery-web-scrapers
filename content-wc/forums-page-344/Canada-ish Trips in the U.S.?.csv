2429186,adempsey,2014-02-07 14:42:00,963,"Even that might not work. My buddies father refuses to share his waypoints with him!!I always assumed there was decent fishing in MN, WI, NY, MI and ME. Does Alaska count?"
2429482,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-07 15:52:00,484,"adempsey, there are no walleye in wi anymore. check out youtube video. ""Northern WI Walleyes"" hitler will tell you. if you need a good laugh today check that one out."
2429498,bassnblast,2014-02-07 15:59:00,56,"BWCAW! Check out LaTourells outside of Ely. Fantastic bass, pike and walleye fishing on Basswood Lake. My brother caught an 8lb. smallie on one of our trips -- looked like a football..."
2431098,Fishoil,2014-02-08 10:36:00,1277,"Money won't buy it but I do have two daughters. If you can outfish my older one you might have a chance. My money's on my daughter but what the heck, she might like you anyway."
2431162,revitup,2014-02-08 11:33:00,140,"We spent four years in Minnesota on Sand Lake and took day trips to Leech and Winni. The trip itself was great, but the numbers and size just didn't compare. So since we call it a ""fishing"" trip we've decided to always make the longer drive and spend more money to get up to Canada."
2431354,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-08 13:06:00,484,"MrSimon, bingo Fishoil's got 2 daughters!! Your in luck, you just got to out fish one of them in a tourney. Who said walleye central cant compete with eHarmony. Actually I gave up on wi or mn waters in comparison to what Ontario can offer, looking at the all around exsperiance of a tremendous walleye trip. Yes the fishing is always great, yes the friends I have met are truly friends, yes the lack of other boaters is great, and on most occasions has been the same cost just a bit longer drive time."
2431394,kzoofisher,2014-02-08 13:21:00,5144,"I don't know of anywhere that compares for the combination of numbers of fish, solitude and scenery. Everywhere in Michigan that has great numbers of fish also has lots of people. Michigan has 75% of the population of Ontario in 25% of the area. Pennsylvania is probably similar. It's a little different out east, I know of a lake in Vermont that has great smallmouth fishing and hardly anyone on it, but I think that's because people in Vermont are really weird. Wish there were more weird people around here. There are some lakes I like that are in National and State Forests, beautiful scenery and plenty of wildlife but the fishing isn't as good. A very few small lakes that have a very rustic landing down a long two track and the fishing is darn good so long as you don't pressure it too much and the scenery ain't bad either. I guess that's where I go to scratch the Canada itch and the more crowded places get the nod when I'm looking for a sore wrist."
2427874,MrSimon,2014-02-07 08:32:00,922,"Obviously we all love taking trips up to Canada, for the reasons we already know. But those trips are often expensive, long, and eat up a lot of family/work time. Do any of you do smaller scale trips in the U.S. that can scratch the ""Canada Itch"" .... at least for a little while? Where do you go, what's it like, and why do you like it?"
2428082,dutchboy,2014-02-07 09:06:00,5717,"Voyageurs National Park. Fish Rainy, Kabatogama, Namakin, Crane Lakes. Canadian look & feel without the border crossing. I don't think the fishing compares to Canada but the feeling does. Plenty of lodging (resorts, motels) around the park but it does fill up fast. Book soon if you are thinking of going."
2428218,Fishoil,2014-02-07 09:49:00,1277,There are places stateside that are every bit as good as Canada but you won't read about them on the internet. If you do they won't stay that way much longer. I have the good fortune of knowing a few of them but I still spend more time in Canada than at these closer spots. It's nice to get away and spend time with a group of friends and most of the closer spots just don't work well with more than a couple people. So I save them for special trips with my family and a very few close friends.
2428314,Richard B,2014-02-07 10:10:00,735,"When my brothers lived closer, we used to go to the UP of Michigan. About a 6 hour drive for me and we always had a lot of fun. We camped out and every other day switched to a different lake."
2428370,2746,2014-02-07 10:16:00,3206,"Doesn't help the Canada itch but we usually shake off the winter with a trip to southern Missouri or northern Arkansas for some trout, crappie and/or stripper fishing in early march. We've even stumbled on to some walleye on these trips but more by accident than on purpose....haven't worked at it hard enough to figure out eyes in those impoundments down there. Just being on soft water and seeing some green and spring blossoms make the trip worth while for me."
2428434,Bigstorm,2014-02-07 10:33:00,799,"A couple of us from our normal Canada group started making a 2nd trip somewhere in the fall. We did a 2nd, shorter trip to Canada once, but found that its tougher to go that far for less time up there. Last year, we decided to give Rainy Lake a shot. Its pretty close to that ""Canada"" feel and saved us 4hrs of drive time each way. Fishing was tougher but mostly because its a new body of water for us and we didnt want to hire a guide - we prefer to learn the lake on our own. We liked it enough that we booked our fall trip for 2014 when we were checking out last fall."

2428522,MrSimon,2014-02-07 10:52:00,922,"I'm not looking for a place for me personally .... I just wanted to hear other people's stories about where they like to go. Me and my buddies go every year up to Black Lake, NY and fish for bass, pike, walleye, crappie, catfish, bowfin, and someday hope to catch one of the lake sturgeon they have. We can get there in under six hours and the lake has that Canadian Shield feel, so we love it. We stay at www.outboardinn.com"
2428874,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-07 12:42:00,484,MrSimon your going to have to throw out $$$$ at Fishoil to get him to crack.
2428946,MrSimon,2014-02-07 13:17:00,922,Maybe he has a sister or daughter I can marry .... then I'll be family
