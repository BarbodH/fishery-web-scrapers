515716,Guest,2001-12-16 07:20:00,0,Does anyone on the board have experiences with either Loon Haunt Outposts or Border Outposts? Both sites look nicely set up for a fly-in. Just trying to add some personal reference(s) so we can make our decision.Thanks.
515717,School Guy,2001-12-16 11:23:00,0,"Our last fly-in was through Border Outposts and I have nothing but good things to say about them. They run a first class operation and treated our group very well. Our August trip was at Whiskeyjack Lake through Thunderbird Lodge. They flew us from Winnnipeg directly to the outpost and the return trip was from Whiskeyjack to Thunderbird to Winnipeg. Any questions we had were handled over the two way radio and when we needed supplies they were promptly delivered by plane. No trophy fish this trip but the 15-19"" Walleye were everywhere and at times it was like fishing in a barrell. Our groups biggest Northerns were in the 36-39"" range. Great cabins with everything you need and the hot showers are a bonus.You can check them out at Thunderbirdlodge.com. Great people and I'd go back again in a heartbeat."

515721,Guest,2001-12-17 17:41:00,0,I don't recommend Loon Haunt. Seemed like the owners were more interested in selling the place than running it. They used to have a great operation. They also went to 100% C & R.Don't know about Border Outposts.RJG
515722,sdyer,2001-12-17 18:59:00,34,I don't know much about loon haunt but if you want to fly out of red lake check out www.waynorthlodge.ca. I have been there 5 times and the fishing is great for trophy pike with tons of walleyes and lake trout. I have reccomended this place to a few people on this board and most have been very happy. You may e-mail me for more details. Good luck.Duffy

515719,School Guy,2001-12-18 21:13:00,0,You can reach me at [email protected] I'll be more than happy to give more info.
515723,Guest,2002-01-12 19:57:00,0,Wouldn't recomend LH 97 boats on the lake from other operators does not include boat for people on the lake. try something more remote.
