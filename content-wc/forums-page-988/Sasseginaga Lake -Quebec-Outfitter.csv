We've been trying to hit a different outfitter each time, and are looking into the remote (5 miles down the lake) camp @ Sasseginaga. Anybody out there been to this Lake? Or tried out this outfitter? Or this particular camp option? Will gladly pass on reports on the two other Outfitters we have stayed -w- in the past....Air Melancon and Scott Outfitters if anybody has ????"

516131,retire55,2002-01-07 17:51:00,1029,Baxter:We have not fished Lake Sasseginaga but have fished Lake Ogascanane right beside it. Lake Ogascanane is 4 miles further east and the owners (Brad and Ginny Mullens) are nephew and niece of the owners of Lake Sasseginaga Outpost (Vicki and Wally Mullens). Brad and Ginny were great hosts. We too opted to stay away from maim camp at an outpost 7 miles down the lake.You have about 60 miles of gravel road to navigate to get to the lake but the road was great in Sep 2000 when we went. We all had 4 X 4's but they are not required provided you don't put 4 guys and their gear into a car. I'd like to hear about the results of your other trips as well as your trip into Sasseginaga. Jay

I have some more questions? Please bear with me. How was the fishing as to size and quanity? How do you rate the cabins,boats and motors? Is it worth towing your own boat?Somewhere on a discussion board a while back I remember reading some negative comments about fishing at Lake Ogascanane.hence the questions since I'm close to a depositthanksSeanik"

516133,retire55,2002-01-08 18:41:00,1029,"Hi Seanik:Not to worry. I don't mind answering questions and sharing information. Unfortunately, I can not say much about the fishing in Ogascanane. 8 of us travelled there (in 4 4X4's) for 13-17 Sep 2000. The weather had turned cold a week before we left and it continued cold, wet, windy and overcast during the 4 days we were there. The wind was the greatest detriment to fishing - there just didn't seem to be any place to go to get out of the wind. On the positive side, I can say that I have never marked so many fish in my life. They were all suspended between 45 and 60 feet. But we just couldn't get many to bite (even with downriggers). Their 2001 brochure shows pictures of nice walleye caught in Jul 01.We stayed at Smith Pass Outpost. For us the accommodations were great but it all depends what you are looking for. Smith Pass slept 8 and was very spacious. It was located off a beautiful sand beach about 75 yards from the water. No running water and no inside toilet. We took a generator to power up the lights. The whole area is very scenic and a day trip into Taylor bay at the far end of Ogascanane is worth the time. We marked lots of fish there too. We caught fish there but they were too small (less than 13 inches). Brad and Ginny have built two new outposts since then, Northern Outpost and Southern Outpost.If you have your own rig, I would recommend you trailer it in. If you have any experience travelling bush roads, these roads were like a highway. I had read some complaints on this board about the roads before we left and I had some concerns. However, when I saw the great condition of the roads, we couldn't understand anyone complaining. We averaged 30 mph all the way in. My partner and I trailered in a 16 foot aluminum and our own motor. The other fellows used the 14 foot fiberglass boats plus 15 HP motors provided by Brad. With the wind conditions we experienced (3-4 foot waves) I didn't consider Brad's boats safe (the stern had a low design). Indeed, on one day, four of our guys never left camp for safety reasons. We had no difficulty with our 16 foot aluminum.I think I have addressed the questions you asked. As I said, Brad, Ginny and the boys were great hosts. Have a great trip! Jay"

516135,Guest,2002-01-11 08:30:00,0,"Jay: Sorry to take so long getting back to you. Had to go on a 3 day conference out of town. My gang's first 2 walleye trips were with Air Melancon. I can't say enough about the hosts, accomodations, and the boats.....all were top notch. Bring your own boat seats -w- backs for the boats though. Both times we opted for their same lake, Lake Naticum. It was loaded with smaller Walleye (13""-16"")but each trip produced a few 4# 21"" fish.....if going out in the boonies to a great, secluded spot and catching LOTS and LOTS of fish (though no trophies, in our case) turns your crank, it's a great place to spend some time. Absolute seclusion, a lake all to ourselves that was 7 miles long -w- plenty of bays, islands, structure...the setting was phenomonal. We also boated some ""Nords"", nothing huge....but all of us at on time or another lost bigger fish that we were convinced were BIG northern pike....they were all on line while trolling for walleye, and bit thru the 12# test...we never got 'em close enough to the boat to get a look at 'em.....and when we went after them with heavier gear, they wouldn't hit ....only on the lighter hookups. Our last trip was late last August to a drive in outfitter by the name of Scott. There we fished Mitchimicus (sp?) reservoir, and the river that ran through it. We drove in the last 35 miles on gravel road to the main camp, only to find out that our outfitter was fresh out of Quebec Liscences.....had to backtrack 10 miles or so each way to another outfitters place to purchase our liscences...it was the only problem we had, but still sat kinda funny with all of us, we thought that our host shoulda/coulda made the ride there himself as we had just driven for 6 hours to get there....maybe not then and there on the spot, but maybe the next day to save us the hassle. Other than that, the fishing was good, the accomodations good, the boats were good, the motors were brand new, quiet mercs. We didn't have the water to ourselves, seeing the occasional other party fishing here and there. Not as many walleye as Naticum, but definitely bigger fish, we got 2 that ran 26"" 5+ #.... quite a few more that ran 3-4#.....still many 13"" smalls and some dandy perch (10-13"")...no northerns in that water...but the river had brookies that ran 10-12"" and I managed to land two the last night there, a 17"" brookie that went 3 1/2 # and a 14""er that ran 3#.....incredibly deep bodied, colored trout. The reservoir was very low due to the drought last year, down 15' according to our host....we had a blast beachcombing old tackle off the acres of exposed bottom. I'd have no problem recommending either place. Hope this helps out!"
