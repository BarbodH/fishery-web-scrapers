Take some glow twister tails, did very well on them tipped with a minnow.Good average size walleye in the lake"

Some in our group did ok with a Johnson silver minnow tipped with a 3"" grub or minnow. I'd really like to know what the weather is up there in the last week of May. Do you think there is any chance for decent weather?"
