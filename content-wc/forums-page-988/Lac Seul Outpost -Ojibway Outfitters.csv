515526,Guest,2001-12-05 19:19:00,0,"Great fishing! Big Fish present. We have caught walleyes up to 30""(and many 25+), (3) 40"" Northern (many 35"" to 38""), Perch up to 11"", smallmouth up to 19"" and Musky (our biggest is 42"" but they can run much bigger).Good place to catch some nice fish. I have fished there four times and have caught big fish on each trip.Make sure that you bring a camera and some good rain gear because we have always needed both.Usually fish live-bait rigs for walleyes.Cast spoons, bucktails, suicks and topwaters for northern and muskies."
515527,Kaz,2001-12-07 08:09:00,643,"Flip: It's great fishing, but bring your own gas. Ken always has moisture in his tanks. Also plan for an 40mi in and a 40mi out. Some of my friends didn't plan for gas out and bought some there and had trouble keeping their motors running smooth. Good luck FISHING, THE ICE IS FORMING ON LOTW, GO ICE...Kaz"
515528,Guest,2001-12-07 12:24:00,0,"We have been there 3 times over the past 10 years. I would recommend it, the camp has improved greatly over the past 10 years and Ken and his wife are now living there during the summer. I was there with three fishing buddies during the week of September 11. Ken was very helpful and brought in newspapers, let us use his cell phone and made every effort to reduce our anxiety over the terrible events of that week.That said, the fishing is good as well. Good for Walleye, Pike and Muskie. Ken has a new fuel tank system and barge to bring it in so I think the water-in-the fuel issue in the previous post is past history. We burned a lot of gas during the week and had no problems.Paul"
515529,Kaz,2001-12-07 16:53:00,643,"Paul: I'm glad to hear that problem is gone. I also like the camp. Fishing north and east of camp was great for some huge Musky. I don't think I could make it back to the landing, even with GPS, by myself though. Good luck Fishing....KAZ"
515530,Guest,2001-12-08 07:59:00,0,"Hey guys, THanks for all your help, it's greatly apreciated. sounds like you all bring your own boats in. I unfortunatly don't own a boat big enough to make that kind of trip, so I would be boating in with them. What kind of boats and motors do they provide for fishing, and how much gas can I except yo use. What was he charging for premixed. One more thing. I'm taking my wife along and while an acomplished angler, she prefers that the cabin and overall acomadations to be above average.How are they? Recomandations on when to go? Any words of wisdom would be helpful, thanks again."
515531,Guest,2001-12-08 12:20:00,0,"Flip,You will fish out of a 16-foot Lund boat with a false floor and fold up seats. The boat is equipped with a 25 HP Mercury motor. It is just your basic aluminum boat. Back in 1996 I fished out of a resort boat. We fished out of the resort for seven days and used approximately 36 gallons of mixed gas during the week. Buying gas at the camp is expensive.Your gas usuage and the price per gallon can really add to the cost of your trip. Gas has to be hauled in 40 miles on the barge and that is one of the reasons the price of gas is so high.I am telling you this so you are prepared for it.Remember, you are on vacation with some of the biggest fish swimming below your boat, so enjoy the experience and catch big fish. The Lac Seul trips I have taken have been great. Twice, I have seen bears swimming across the water and got some great pictures. I have seen Moose, Caribou, eagles and many loons while fishing the Chamberlain Narrows area.I like to explore and try new areas but you do not have to travel very far to catch fish in the Chamberlain Narrows area. I recommend bringing a portable depthfinder to help you find hidden hot spots.Your wife will definitely want a VIP cabin (more $) so you would have flush toilets and showers in the cabin. If you don't go the VIP cabin route there are a couple of outhouses and a camp shower that anyone can use.The accomadations are very basic. Make sure you prepare your wife for this. One of many examples are there are no curtains on the cabin windows. Mid-June you can catch some really big walleyes.My trips have been in either August or September.For walleyes we fish jig and minnows, or live-bait rigs with minnow or crawlers. Make sure you have plenty of bait because you will use it all. Last year we went through 35 dozen crawlers and 30 dozen minnows with five fisherman in a week.Another tip:Using a pair of talkabout 250 radios might not be a bad idea if you were out fishing and your wife was back relaxing at the cabin and needed to get a hold of you.Good luck,Rubes"

515533,Russ Warye,2002-01-16 11:42:00,8,"Excellent camp with a great location for walleye, northern pike and muskie fishing. The walleye action is superb from May to the camp closing. As suggested by others, plan on bringing portable depthfinders is using one of Ken's camp boats. They are an excellent addition; also maps can be obtained from them. It is the basic Ministry map, which is a decent beginning. Have made 9 trips there and never had problems with the gasoline. Ken and Brenda are good operators and will try to do whatever to make the trip a success.Russ WaryeSenior Research EditorFishing Hot Spots"
515534,Guest,2002-01-16 18:38:00,0,"Our group has stayed at the narrows twice, it was OK but since that time i understand there have been many improvements.Prior to that, I have dealt with them for many years and had excellent serice, cooperation and have had the most memorable trips ever. Just talked to them at the St Paul show this week. As for gas, he indicates it is about $1 more than from the pump in town. It doesn't get out there for free.You really need to go to Scaler lake for ssome good walleye action although you are also close to Skidoo and other good spots.Defintely a good choice.TLY"
