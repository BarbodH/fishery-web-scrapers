516114,dlhomes,2002-01-05 07:46:00,62,My grandfather used to takes us to many lakes somewhere past Upsala and another small town?? We took a logging road way out. I remember Alley Lake is just off road also Milly and Empire was up farther. Anyone know this area and these lakes? Someday I'd like to go back. Some lakes only had northerns and some lakes had walleye and northern.also recall a lake called Northern Lake with big Northern! Thanks!

We never got any eyes of any size maybe 20"" largest but usually caught all you wanted. I think they used to net these lakes long ago. If they quit maybe there's some hawgs out there now! Thanks!"
