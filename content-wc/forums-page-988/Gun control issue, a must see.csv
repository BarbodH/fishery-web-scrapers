The position is something like this, ""everyone needs to be armed so that life will be safe because everyone will be affraid to try something, because the other guy is armed."" If this logic is true then it ought to also work on an international level, therefore all nations and warlords should be armed with nuclear weapons, and the latest defensive hardware so that everyone would be affraid to attack anyone."

One psycho with a nuclear bomb could kill 5 million. To find fault with the gun logic, you must use GUN arguments such as: Did states that passed carry and conceal laws see their crime rates go up or down?"
