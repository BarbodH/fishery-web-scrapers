As an outfiter the are realy concerned with safety and would rather have you alive then on time. They will go out of their way to accomodate you.Have a great trip!

My son and I were in Ely, MN one time at a resort (BWCA). It was a real windy day, and the owner said he was waiting for a plane to pick some people up. I asked, is it safe for them to be landing on the water today, etc.. He said, well they shouldn't be today, but it's hard for them to say no sometimes because you've got people traveling hundreds of miles sometimes for only a few days of vacation. They are all on a time schedule.Then you have to pick'em too...etc.. so anyway, he made me feel a little nervouse about fly-ins, but my son and sure want to go one one. I know a pilot won't take any chances they shouldn't, but what happens if the weather is real bad. Does it happen, that sometimes you're delayed a day or two? Any info. is greatly appreciated."

Keeper Lake is one of Nestor Falls outpost Lakes. Chimo has a cabin on this lake as well. Chimo flys out of Red Lake. Chimo is $565.00 for 7 days and Nestor is $965.00. I'll drive another 4 hours for that. It amounts to what your time is worth to you and maybe Nestor has nicer cabins. But you're fishing the same place."
