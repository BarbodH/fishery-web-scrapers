If anyone has been to any of there outposts and can give me your opinion and advice, I'm all ears. Or you can email me at [email protected]"

516149,Guest,2002-01-08 06:57:00,0,"I have fished several of gawley's outposts before gawley owned them. I have fished McVicar, Cannon, Aerial and Kapikik. Out of all of them McVicar and Kapikik were the best. Larger fish in McVicar and more fish in Kapikik. McVicar has an excellent portage lake called Lang with lots of good fish average size of about 20-22"". Kapikik has two real good water falls one coming in and one going out and a very good lake attached called Jack Pine. Lots of big rocks on Kapikik just under the water. This year I am going to Keeper Lake one of Chimo's outpost lakes. I have never been to one of Chimo's Lakes but I have friends that have and say they are good. Chimo is much cheaper than Gawley $565 each for 7 days with a group of six or more. He will fly in beer for $31.00 a case in advance so it doesn't go into your weight and he allows 150lbs per man. Gawley only allows 100lbs per man. If you have any questions e-mail at [email protected]"
