Write and call these bozo's once or twice a week! Get active with youth groups and hunters safety courses. Join an organization that will fight at the legal level. NRA is good, but then so is the WLFA (www.wlfa.org) Join or form a local gun or gun n rod club. Join Ducks Unlimited, Wild Turkey Federation, Whitetails Unlimited, Ted Nugent World Bowhunters, Pheasants Forever, delta Waterfowlers and a host of others. One apathetic gun owner is worse than a bus full of antis! We can win this fight. The ambulance chasers, er trial lawyers filing suits to sue manufactureres, to me, is just the latest desperate attempt to sway a battle they feel they are loosing. Next elections, get out and vote! Every last one of you, and get your friends to vote. Every gun owner must vote!! If we loose, we lost it ourselves and have NO ONE to blame but ourselves. Failure is not an option!"
515657,Guest,2002-01-07 19:06:00,0,"Ya thats us, *Bang, Zip!!* oop just ducked a bullet there. Heck even the Nuns are packin heat! Seriously though, where do you for your opinion? What stats? Could it be the liberal commie news media? Are you aware that while legal gun ownership is at an all time high, that all hangun crime is down, and accidental deaths especially amoung kids are at the lowest level since the very early seventies? More guns and lower incidents of crime. Hmm seems like our system is working too. When your gubmint sees to do as Great Britan and Austrailia have done, your violent crime rate and gun crime rate will soar, just as theirs has. I am glad you love your country, as I love mine. That however is not the issue. The issue is a shovel or abutter knife can be an offensive weapon. The person on the other end of the item has to have the will to use it for no good. I have been aroung guns and owned guns all of my adult life, and I have never nor have any of my guns, or handguns jumped up and shot anyone. Also, as to the hangun and assault weapon issue (I went to assault weapons as that is generally an anti gunners next off the cuff remark) Switzerland (or Sweden) allows anyone to own a fully automatic machine gun, yet none has been used in a crime there in decades. Also, when is the last time you heard of an machine gun or an assault weapon used in a crime here? The rash of work related and school tragedies were all done with legal, post ban weapons. And by the way if the criminals are locked up, whos gonna do a crime?? And, it is the breakdown of the do what you feel, Im in it for me, Liberal values that have totally morally corrupted some in this country."

515682,Guest,2002-01-01 14:06:00,0,"Check this out......... From David M. Deane [email protected] 11-27-1 Just thought you'd like to know that the following Hitler quote is bogus: ""This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration. Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future!"" There wasn't much ""gun control"" in Hitler's Germany (not to be confused with German actions in conquered countries). What ""gun registration"" which did exist was enacted by the Weimar Republic, almost a decade before Hitler came to power. Hitler did not confiscate guns from ordinary Germans: the Allied armies did that. Ironically, Hitler's Germany had freer gun laws than any country in Europe today. This is not meant to cast any ""positive"" light on Hitler, but to draw your attention to the historical anachronism of the bogus quote: gun registration was not a political issue during the 1930's in Germany, and Hitler would never have made such a boast. It would never have occurred to Hitler to credit gun registration (which he did not do) for the streets being safe: Hitler would have credited his rise to power for peace and safety (ie, all the nasty communists were locked up, hence no more street fighting). There simply was not that much crime in 1930's Germany to begin with: the above bogus quote in fact sounds like a product of 1960's America, when crime was in fact just starting to become a big political issue (hence the anachronism of projecting the issue of street crime back on to 1930's Germany, where it hardly existed and was not a political issue)."
515683,Guest,2002-01-01 15:30:00,0,"We can argue registration/confiscation/etc. all day but until the laws regarding criminals are enforced none of it will work. Look at the cities in the US with the most stringent gun control laws. Most of them have the highest crime rates in the country. The number of guns available in the US, both legal and illegal makes registration impractical and unworkable. Not to mention that pesky 2nd Amendment. True criminal control will be the only effective method of dealing with the problem. Very few crimes are committed by individuals that have handgun permits and very few criminals bother with permits nor would they bother with registration. Severe penalties for crimes involving firearms are the answer but the politicians don't have the backbone to pass needed laws and the judicial system has been corrupted to the point of impotentence."
515671,Guest,2002-01-01 22:27:00,0,"The danger with gun control up here in Canada is that the police forces do not need a search warrant to search you're home. Not only can they confiscate your gun/rifle, ammo, literature, kits, anything related. That is the scary part. And the bleeding hearts just don't get it. OOPS! It was the bleeding hearts that came up with that one."
515672,Guest,2002-01-02 05:22:00,0,They need a warrant to enter your home. Where did you get that they can enter and search?
515685,bigfish1965,2002-01-02 09:15:00,3210,"Whatever your stand is on gun control, remember that the law is the will of the people. I for one do not see a problem with the registration of your guns. The registration and FAC requirements does the best job possible to ensure that we have responsible people owning firearms. Can we stop criminals from getting guns? Not entirely, but we can make it as difficult as possible. Each gun in the hands of a criminal was once owned by a law abiding citizen. Maybe the idea that it can be tracked back to them will make owners a little more careful with their firearms storage. Gun owners have known for years that they needed to register. Those choosing to wait untill the last minute have no right to gripe now. You know how slow the government moves, be prepared. I don't wait until a half hour before I go out on the lake to obtain my fishing permit. The United States has choosen a different path than us with respect to guns, and I respect their right to form their laws the way they see fit, as I hope they respect ours. As a sidenote as an Canadian of Irish descent, the tragedy that occurs in Ireland all too often is a result of bombs, not guns. That was a silly comparison."
515686,Guest,2002-01-02 14:20:00,0,"To Bigfish1965:I only hope that in Canada the law being the will of the people is true. The same cannot be said in many cases in the US. Special interest groups with deep pockets frequently convince the politicians to ignore the will of the people. The effectiveness of the Canadian law will be closely monitored, I'm sure, and it will be interesting to see what, if any effect it has on crime 5-10 years down the road. If it has no positive effect on reducing crime, do you think they will repeal the law?(P.S. By the way, I've been to Canada many times and like your country and especially its people. Some regulators seem to be working overtime on rules and laws, but that's for you to deal with. From an outsider's viewpoint, it looks like you have the will of the people in the large metropolitan areas being forced on the smaller concentrations of people in the outlying areas.)"
515673,Guest,2002-01-02 21:01:00,0,"I stand corrected...I think, I found the Canada' Justice Dept. websiteand looked up C-68. Website is at:http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/1995/39/4823.html#rid-4929The wording is somewhat suspect, businesses seem to be vulnerable. Start at para 101 and read thru to 105."
515687,Firetiger,2002-01-03 05:04:00,53,"The present statistics clearly show that deaths from guns is much lower in Canada (on a per capita basis) than in the U.S. Although Canada only recently invoked new gun registration laws it has had restrictions on hand guns and assault rifles for some time. So, I would say that the effect of gun control are already evident. Most ( not all) deaths from guns are a result of kneejerk' reactions and thus the availability of a weapon makes the situation much more volatile. Gun registration is not the perfect solution, anyone can agree on that. But, it is better to do something than to do nothing, and the new rules simply make it a bit more difficult for a law abiding person to pick up a gun and use it to harm someone. This is the will of the people."
515688,Guest,2002-01-03 08:08:00,0,"I'm really not trying to beat this to death so please bear with me because I can't follow the logic that registration will stop these ""crimes of passion"". You assert that the law is trying to prevent law abiding citizens from shooting someone in a fit of rage due to the availability of a firearm. Criminals, by definition, break the law, hence the registration law will have little effect on them. Honest, law-abiding citizens will be able to still own guns if properly registered, at least this is my understanding. In a fit of rage or temporary insanity, whatever you choose to call it, I don't believe that an individual will stop and say to themselves ""I better not do this, this gun is registered."" Exactly how does registration prevent these types of crimes unless law abiding citizens are denied ownership? I agree that it is better to do something than nothing, but I disagee with the concept that stricter control on guns will have a significnt effect. You can control the guns completely out of the hands of law abiding people but there will continue to be deaths from firearms. Criminal control is more effective than gun control. This has been proven in a few US cities that have enacted mandatory prison terms for crimes committed while in possession of a firearm."

Well If your law abiding and the law requires registration for tracking purposes so we keep the guns out of the criminials then what do you worry about. This talk of BIG BROTHER watching you, are you people that paranoid? If you are a law abiding citizen you should be able to own a gun but please help the common good of all by registering them so when or if your gun gets stolen by the bad guys and they use it to kill someone we can catch the *******s quicker. Relax and obey laws and shoot your squirells, and deer. How is registration an atack on freedom? You got your guns don't you?"
515658,Papi,2001-12-31 10:07:00,13,"I agree with you.This debate as been going on for la little while.Sure as ##### all the crooks, murderers and lunatics are going to register their weapons.

I think the question that most are debating is: Is it or should it be the Govenments Business to know how many guns a law abiding citizen has. Again, should it be their business? The registering of guns will not keep guns out of a criminals hand. If Zoro's numbers are correct in the thread above, I believe most are saying, if there were 128 hand gun deaths/Crimes last year in Canada, should the laws change for the other 34,999,872 law abiding citizens of the country? I believe there is a common link between personal privacy and Freedom. (For law abiding citizens)"

515656,Guest,2001-12-29 07:50:00,0,The USA needs to clean up its act in the guns and violent crimes category. Why you people kill each other in record amounts.....many with handguns.....is beyond me as a Canadian. For all intents the USA has a very violent people who have among the highest rate of incarceration in the world. This is all the more reason to control the access to guns especially handguns. You have no way of tracking a gun that is sold after it is legally bought. THis is where the bulk of guns on the street come from. Untill you people come to the realization that you have a problem and there is a political will to do something about it.....the wild west continues. Just keep your guns at home when you come to Canada......we enforce our laws here......and you will do time.
515661,Trophymuskie,2001-12-29 08:17:00,254,"I know this is a touchy subject with our friends south of the border and was going to stay away but since this has been civalized I will put in my 2 cents worth.Now that one in ten Canadians own guns statement is exagerated I think it is more like less then 5% as only hunters, farmers and cops own guns here, oh ya criminals can be added to the list but not like the USA our 13 year olds are not packing.Now this gun registration is done for only one reason and no it's not so the government knows where the guns are but to make gun owners responsible for their own weapons by locking them away and keeping amo in a seperated locked compartment. So that when someone breaks in your house or your kid gets into a fight at school the loaded guns are not just there for the taking. This might not be the reason we already have way less murders by guns here but it will help lower that number as well as bank roberies by knife are rare to say the least. Another way the locking process helps is if the guy gets pissed at his wife and wants to kill her well while he gets the key to unlock the gun cabinet and then the key to unlock the gun and them the key for the amo he might just have enough time to think it over and realise it is the wrong thing to do.I am glad to know that maybe 1 in 20 houses ( maybe 50 ) have guns in them as well as no glove boxes but the ones of cops and criminals cars.Catch a big one this fallKeep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"

515659,Guest,2001-12-24 01:04:00,0,"Everyone hears stories that the Police are raiding so-and-so's homes, because they didn't register their guns, secure them properly, or have proper permits. These rumours are likely not true. The Police have much better things to do that to go to your apartment to check if your guns are locked up or head out to your farm to see if you have your ammo stored separate from your rifles. The Police do not have the man power to conduct these sorts of checks at the drop of a hat. Even if Police are getting anonymous tips from disgruntled neighbours or vicious ex's, they aren't likely to come running over to raid your home for a few guns - likely requiring spending several hours/days doing up a search warrant! Have you had an officer come to your house to ask if he can check your gun locker/cabinet? Didn't think so. If you did hear about someone having had their firearms seized by Police, perhaps it wasn't a ""raid."" Perhaps the Police attended to a domestic disturbance or other family violence or mental health complaint, and seized some firearms during an investigation there, to ensure the safety of everyone in the house. In those instances, firearms registration and storage charges seem likely occur. However I can't see a Canadian Police force randomly charging the good members of the public - but of course, we all hear those stories at the coffee shops... So we have to register our firearms - we have to register our cars too or they get seized. The problem is who should be given a license and who shouldn't. Even under the new system, people are getting licenses who shouldn't and people who should get one are having trouble getting one. Also, this whole thing is costly - it has become expensive for the taxpayers to fund the administration of this thing. And, who says 10, 20, or 30 years from now the cost of registering a firearm won't skyrocket 1,000 times more than inflation?!"

Canada's population is 35 million and the U.S. has 200 million, or put another way the U.S. population is 6 times larger. Deaths from handguns in Canada = 128 while in the U.S. it is 13,429, which makes you 105 times more likely to get killed in the U.S. by handgun. So, 6 times the population and 105 times more likely of getting shot .... don't you see the correlation?Oh, and one more thing ........... majority rules means ""DEMOCARCY""."

I'm personally worried as even though I've spoke to my MP in person, and that He has vouched for me personally; I am still waiting for my licence from the feds. Seems it is taking many,many months to get things done and even though I have no criminal record; without the licence that is now 4 months late, I'm hunting and guiding as a criminal. Big bro. can arrest me, confiscate my guns forever and put me in jail do to their lack of resonable responce to a requist from a law abiding citizen. HEADS UP!!!!!"

515640,Guest,2001-12-12 20:27:00,0,Canada takes a dim view on high capacity magazines and military type weapons. Point in question is the rifle Marc Lepine killed 14 woman in Montreal with....a Mini 14 with a 30 round magazine. This is a military style weapon intended for one thing and that is killing people. I have the same view of hand guns. They serve no usefull purpose other than Military or Law enforcement and some specialized trades like trappers and prospectors to name a few. They cannot be used for hunting in Canada and I would not care if they made them all illegal.

515646,Guest,2001-12-17 20:09:00,0,I think registration and control of guns is a good thing. I am a hunter and have no problem with the will of the people being followed. The will of the people in this country is that they would like to see guns registered..........so be it. That is the way things run in a democratic country. In Canada only about 1 in 10 homes have a gun.
515647,Guest,2001-12-18 04:02:00,0,"Sure, go ahead and get all your guns registered so when they come to confiscate them they'll know exactly who's got what. I'm a law bidding citizen and I own several handguns. I don't think it's any of the governments business what I own!"
515648,Guest,2001-12-18 17:12:00,0,"A study conducted by the Heartland Institute called ""Taking Aim at Gun Control"" concluded recently that between 1973and 1992 handgun ownership increased by 110 percent, from 37 million to 78 million. During that time the crime ratesteadily rose also. If we look to other parts of the globe, we will find much stricter gun control. Some countries do extensive backgroundchecks and psychological tests. Others have much stricter licensing requirements. Some prohibit gun ownership. But, notsurprisingly, they all have one thing in common - a much smaller number of deaths due to handguns. Just look at the facts from the Mennonite Central Committee news service: In 1992 handguns killed 13 persons inAustralia, 33 in Britain, 36 in Sweden, 60 in Japan, 97 in Switzerland, 128 in Canada and 13,429 in the United States!(http://www.kcstar.com/democracy/stories/gnedit.htm)"
