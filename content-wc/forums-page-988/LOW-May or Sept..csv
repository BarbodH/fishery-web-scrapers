516105,Guest,2002-01-12 07:34:00,0,"I agree with Doc, but would even consider the last weeks in July if possible. We've been coming out of Souix Narrows for the last 4 years and heading past the Yellow Girl area with one of the Lake of the Woods Houseboats. The walleye fishing has been great for size (1- 10# and many 4-7#). plenty of eaters to keep the tastebuds happy and the belly full. Crappies walleyes and bass in Blueberry have been hit or miss, but when I have 4-10 lb. walleyes cooperating I fine it hard to leave the reefs to give Blueberry its do. I also fished in early may and found the walleye numbers but size was not there. July seemed to be more consistent. I drive 22 hours to get to LOTW for what is the highlight of my fishing year."

516101,bphunger,2002-01-06 08:44:00,28,Depends on what you want to fish for. If you enjoy lake trout Then Whitefish Bay in May is GREAT. The way you fish for them changes when walleye season opens (3rd Sat.). That can be a factor. Walleye will depend on water temp buit we seem to always have some ready to feed when the season opens. Muskie fishing does not open until mid-June. Northerns and both species of Bass can be counted on for action. Be prepared for different weather. Good fishing!!

516102,Guest,2002-01-06 17:59:00,0,I have been north one time in May but about 15 times in Sept. I like the Sept. time much better. Warm clothing and rain gear a must this time of year.

516103,Guest,2002-01-07 15:47:00,0,"Blake, last year the weather (temp) was very strange to say the least. We go to LOW 2 times a year and have for many years. We have found the weather and the walleye fishing to be it's most stable and predictable in the month of Aug., find a hump toping from 14'-20' out of 40'-60', drop a leech or a crawler and it can be unreal. We go out of Souix Narrows in Aug (on a houseboat) and do very well on size and numbers. Last year the numbers were down but the quality was there with 2-8-9# and many over 4#,and enough of the little guys to eat. We were also able to find the crappies in Blueberry. We then go to the Nestor Falls area the last week of Sept., can be cold but the crappies are great. We usually troll leadcore for walleyes and have some real nice pictures of some real nice 'eyes. But with the weather last year the crappies were in a different mood and location, we still caught them but we traveled more for them. Don't judge Aug. from last year. With the choices you gave I'd go with eary Sept. 'eyes might still be on the reefs and the crappies might start schooling. I don't fish slime darts so...the bass will be where the walleyes are. This year we have 3 trips booked...can't wait for Aug./Sept. but soft water will help. LOL Doc"

Very tough fishing conditions but still had a blast. If you go then make sure that you go prepared with a lot of warm clothes, boots, gloves, etc. I stayed at www.whitefishbaycamp.com Huge thumbs up"

516097,Guest,2002-01-05 09:23:00,0,"We were in Sioux Narrows area at Totem Logde. We really are looking for action. We got skunked in mid August and July, and I can't go in June. It looks like more like the May date as of yesterday. The snow and cold does'nt seem what we are looking for but last year we were fishing in 92 degree heat. Is it possible late May might have decent weather?"
