I've heard rumors about Indian netting in many locations but couldn't tell you if they are true or not. We would like to find a place 2 or 3 hours out of Toronto that offers decent walleye fishing, doesn't have to be great, but able to produce a few walleye for a hard day's/night's effort."

I was wondering if anyone had any experience on the River or could tell me how the walleye fishing has been the last year or two. Joe D."

We were told by some friends that there are some Indians in the area who have been netting the spawning walleyes & killing everything else that they caught. And then there is the explosion of Cormorants. We are thinking of fishing in the States as it can not be worse than what we saw on our trip last June. The Key is a beautiful area, but they should manage things a bit better for their number 1 industry...TOURISIM Good luck with your decision."
