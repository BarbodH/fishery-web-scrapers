515556,Guest,2002-01-16 09:37:00,0,"I have fished Lake Parent from 1971 through 1987. The fishing has been and was excellent if you know the lake. Best thing is to stay at the main camp and take a boat outr of 20 mile landing. Fish ther north end of the lake at three rivers, in front of the small island or Hebo bay or off of gull island for walleyes. Jigs and worms drifting work best. On either side of the island the there are ledges that come from 25' to 8 ft. Work both sides of the drop offs.Good luck.[email protected]"
515555,Guest,2002-01-17 09:34:00,0,"SkipJack:When was the last time that you were at Lake Parent. Thinking about going this year. I have not been there since 1988 -89. Is the fishing still as good, especially in the north end by 3 rivers?"
515545,Seanik,2001-12-19 21:46:00,218,"I also am looking at northern Quebec for one of my Canadian fishing adventures. Put Parent Lake in the search and came up with J C Parent outfitters on Lake Wetenagami,is this the place under discussion? Noticed some Quebec outfitters have exclusive rights to their territory, I wonder if this is the case at Parent Lake/Wetenagami Lake?Fantastic message board"

515547,Guest,2001-12-21 07:23:00,0,"The lake to which you refer is definately different from the Parent Lake (near Senneterre, Quebec) under discussion."
515548,Guest,2002-01-03 08:06:00,0,JJ - Which would you recommend ??
515549,Guest,2002-01-04 16:30:00,0,"Paul,We have fished Parent Lake at Senneterre, Quebec many, many times over the years but not for the past 6-7 years. We first went there about 1972 and only missed a few summers through about 1994. We found the fishing great, particularly down the Bell River, which flows north out of the lake, and at ""three rivers"", which in on the north end of the lake where three river coming together to form a common mouth comes into the lake. As I write this I can look up on my wall and see a picture of a 48"", 32 1/4 # northern pike that I caught there in 1983. During one of our last trips in the 1990's (about 1996), my niece caught a 13# walleye just where the Bell River flows out of the lake. The lodge has changed hands several times after being owned and operated for many years by the Sanford brothers originally from PA. We are considering a trip back to Parent sometime just to see if it is still as good as we remember it from the past. Good Luck!!Jerry from WV"
