6689820,Eckohlt,2022-10-04 11:17:00,3685,"What I mean by no moose,TLO outfitters had 19 outpost with moose hunters,and out of the 19 groups of hunters no moose where shot,I'm just going by what one of the hunters told me at the base after we returned."
6689912,Fishquest,2022-10-04 18:42:00,89,"Ok that makes sense, a few did come out as I was up there but its been a slow year for all the outfitters so far compared to last year. Good Luck on your next adventure so many lakes to try up there."
6689968,Eckohlt,2022-10-05 03:44:00,3685,"Thanks fish,good luck to you also next year."
6689976,gordy28,2022-10-05 05:51:00,437,Thanks for the report Sounds like tough sledding but hopefully still a great week awayAndrew
6690042,Eckohlt,2022-10-05 11:26:00,3685,"It's all good,we saved on sun tan lotion atleast,anytime your in a boat in the middle of nowhere in Ont,it's special times."
6690048,prov1800,2022-10-05 11:32:00,5010,You have the best attitude Eck.I feel about the same as you when iam out somewhere.Even when fishing is not the best your still fishing.
6690076,Eckohlt,2022-10-05 12:45:00,3685,"Ont it's my second home,by far the best home,john do they sell killer crumbs in vermillion??wanna get some for hard water eyes."
6690078,prov1800,2022-10-05 12:57:00,5010,They got the killer crumbs in co op in the Bay
6690104,stukkie,2022-10-05 14:06:00,21,No fish at the island? To bad on the waves but i'm sure you made it work and ate your fill of fall walleye.
6690106,Eckohlt,2022-10-05 14:07:00,3685,"My wife will buy me some bags of crumbs for Xmas Dec 7,she's a special gal.lol"
6689402,Eckohlt,2022-10-02 09:38:00,3685,"Back from Aba,first off I've never seen a flyin service so busy as leuenbergers on the 24 th,it was nuts with all Ontario residents moose hunters,Aba was dead for us the first day n half,finally figured out they were in the cabbage 8 to 10 ft then the action began,but overall for the week I would just say fishing was fair,biggest 25in eye,didn't put up big numbers,weather was a nightmare,wind wind wind,snow,killer waves,rain,twin lake outfitters had 19 outposts with moose hunters for our week,NO moose taken!!stayed at cabin number 2,the boats are really tired there thank god we all had knee high rubber boots,lots of bailing out water,boats n motors really get abused on that lake,cabin was nice.So next year I'll start off with melchett see how that goes."
6689412,Stickman8474,2022-10-02 11:17:00,39,"You'll enjoy Melchett. We're sending in our deposit check today for our 3rd consecutive fly in with BFO to Melchett. Lots of humps, drop offs. Lake is portioned out in a way that helps keep it interesting. Your the only camp on 3600 acres though neighboring lakes have river access (we've never seen anybody outside our party)."
6689416,prov1800,2022-10-02 11:21:00,5010,Sounds like a adventure no matter how you look at it.Weather can make it tough.I could suggest 29 places where to go with good equipment great fishing and be alone but you know where those places are.lol.Glad your safe and back home.
6689432,Eckohlt,2022-10-02 12:31:00,3685,See you in a few months john!!my wife n my brother and maybe my brothers daughter also coming.
6689434,Eckohlt,2022-10-02 12:32:00,3685,"Thanks stickman,when you going next year?"
6689440,prov1800,2022-10-02 14:12:00,5010,"That sounds great, looking forward to that."
6689488,RichA$1970,2022-10-02 17:04:00,1159,"Good report and can’t control the weather, but outfitters should have decent / better equipment as fishing in a bathtub sucks. The older I get the less interest I have in a fly in as when they’re busy or weather, delays suck. Well, you can scratch that lake off the list at least and continue the conquest"
6689492,Eckohlt,2022-10-02 17:24:00,3685,"I'll keep plugging away at new lakes rich,now I'm on the hunt for a late fall drive to,first week of Oct 2023."
6689758,Fishquest,2022-10-04 06:30:00,89,"Thanks for the report and this time of the year the weather can make for tough trips, i've had many a camp bound day due to weather in the fall more than summer days. Not sure what you mean by NO moose though, you didn't see any?"
6689790,prov1800,2022-10-04 08:17:00,5010,Thousands of those.lol.Got a whole year to wittle it down to one.Ill suggest a couple when you come up ice fishing.
