6689124,Golden Eagle,2022-09-30 20:46:00,2642,Strong wind is the only thing that has kept me in the cabin during an October fishing trip in NW Ontario.
6689130,prov1800,2022-09-30 21:43:00,5010,My boat can handle wind but rather not have any.
6689360,Esoxmike,2022-10-02 06:58:00,114,How bout stop moaning and groaning about the moaning and groaning.Cuz Trudeau is still a punk
6689364,Wawajake,2022-10-02 07:28:00,413,"I am hoping for one more warm spell in October up here, before I put the boat away , I bought a 4 blade prop and want to try it before next spring."
6689376,prov1800,2022-10-02 08:12:00,5010,Depending where you are that very well could happen.Today pretty good looking in the Vermilion Bay area.I should go but have to get at some projects and not putting them off.Both my truck and wives car need oil changes and that's going to get done today and pull battery out off lawn tractor.That will be 3 check marks on the list.Planning on a Teusday fish day and meet up with some guys at Clarks from WI.Next week still looking good so boat won't get put away just yet.
6689566,Skywagon,2022-10-03 06:37:00,1106,"I am like you John, time to start preparing for winter. I am currently sitting at the cabin, it is a beautiful morning, little wind, 60 f. The colors on the trees are at their peak, but in a week a lot of those leaves will be on the ground. This coming Thursday the forecast calls for below freezing temps with 1 cm of snow, it is time to drain the water system. I will hold off pulling the docks hoping for better than usual fall conditions but will probably end up breaking a skim of ice to get to the cabin in order to pull those docks out because I waited too long. Fall is one of my 4 favorite seasons here, but I know the period between these good fall conditions and fishable ice is coming, time to prepare."
6689570,prov1800,2022-10-03 06:46:00,5010,Things as far as weather actually look good next week.love the colors out now but yes won't last.Got to take it in while it's available.Heading out on Cedar today wife has a appt in Dryden and told me I should go fishing.lol.Enjoy your time at the cabin.Catch you later.
6689658,emma17,2022-10-03 12:48:00,436,Agreed. Prov1800- you may want to look in the mirror when pointing the finger about moaning and groaning. You seem to be bothered by people making decisions that don't follow your line of thinking.
