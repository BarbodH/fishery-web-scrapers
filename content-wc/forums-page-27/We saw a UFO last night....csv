6689886,Skywagon,2022-10-04 16:26:00,1106,"Fishing was good, i found nice size fish around 20' both times I went out, water temperature was showing around 55. We did not keep any fish, we were trying to clean up some of the perishables that were in the cabin so we would not have so much to take out when we finally close up for the winter. We took a friend of my wife along, I told her eating the surplus food in the cabin was like I had heard it said about Iowa corn, ""don't haul it, walk it out on the hoof"" (feed it to the livestock) she took it in good humor and that's we did."
6689890,Skywagon,2022-10-04 16:34:00,1106,My wife is the photographer with the fancy camera. Even with that we were both surprised at how well the pictures turned out. We may never be at the right place at the right time again to see that.

6689596,Skywagon,2022-10-03 08:39:00,1106,"We were at the cabin last night; the sky was absolutely clear and we noticed an unusual object in the western sky slightly above the tree line, but at a distance. There were several colors emanating from it, not the usual red and green marker lights of a plane, it seemed to move up and down slightly, maybe an Elon Musk craft releasing more Starlink satellites? We watched this performance on and off for probably an hour, taking pictures and videos puzzled by what it could be, then it was gone. We have Starlink internet here at the cabin, so Ellen started searching Mr. Google for possibilities of what we might have been seeing, the answer came. It was the star Arcturus, this is a phenomenon that can be witnessed sometimes in the fall, being in the middle of nowhere with no chance of light pollution, we got to see the show. How amazing to be older than dirt and have never seen this before. Here are some pictures."

6689648,proguidedream,2022-10-03 11:53:00,345,"i believe we may have witnessed the same thing years ago, however it was reflecting or something like a sun dog as there was multiple of them.. moving slighlty and very bright , same height just above the trees then dissapeared.. unfornutaly the moment in time even with 5 people with smart phones ,, everyone was just in awe and never decided to film it."
