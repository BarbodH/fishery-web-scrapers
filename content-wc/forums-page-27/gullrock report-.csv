I have stayed at every camp on gullrock now...Ian is great. Camp is small. Cabins are fine. enough for me. I was alone guy so do not need much. bed and bathroom and kitchen. Ian put me on several new spots i never fished. I have fished gullrock for 15 years or so. I caught many walleyes every day. biggest for me was a 26 not that it matters. caught plenty of eaters in 15 to 16 range. caught several 21 to 23's. many 18 to 19's. places that produced...burnt island is always good to me, Ethel island...very small island by burnt...i crushed walleye there on 2 points. it was almost laughable after awhile. Most do not know about ethel so usually have place to myself but 1 boat saw me catching fish and flew right next me, dropped trolling motor and started after it. Round island was good. marker island was good. Stephens point was very good at times. wed. morning i sat in 1 spot, out of the wind, and crushed big walleye for 4 hours. 18-22's all morning. it was lucky for sure as i looked out to white caps all over the lake and i was sitting in calm waters hammering walleye in 22 feet of water. dont know how i lucked out that morning but i did. was windy a few days and makes it tough in a smaller boat and by yourself. hard to control the boat at times. averaged over 50 walleye a day for sure but i dont count...all i know is i was catching one atleast every 5 minutes when i found them. some of the best fishing i have had. Was a great time. can not say enough good things about Ian as a camp owner. Talk to him and listen....you will pick up plenty of fishing tips."
