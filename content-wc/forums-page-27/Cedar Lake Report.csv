My trailer tire shredded, ripping off the fender in the process (normal occurrence). Nothing more fun than changing a traffic facing side trailer tire on that busy highway. Stayed at Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake. First days were cool, several frosts in morning, 27 degrees one morning. Only light rain during the week. Fishing was better during the cool days, Thursday and Friday were up to 65 degrees, south wind, fishing not as good.. hmph!? The walleye fishing was very good, seemed like every place we tried we caught fish. Crappies were more limited to certain areas. We still caught a bunch, but not as many as in previous years, no 300-400/boat days. I had probably my best walleye catch in recent years, maybe ever, from a size perspective. Somewhat keeping track, I took a 21, 22-1/2, 23, 24, 25, 26, and my pb by one inch, a hefty 31 incher. All fish in our boat during the week were taken on either tube jigs or my hair jigs, which I modestly refer to as ""Krejca's Killers"". The 24"" was taken on a tube, the rest on the jigs; as usual, we used no live bait during the week. We had to keep the 24"", as it couldn't be revived, all others were safely released. Accompanying friend got 3 very nice muskies, his son, a very nice pike, while fishing walleyes, pretty good for their first lake trip, several smaller ones were taken by others in our group. Water temperature was 62 on date of arrival, was 59 last day. All in all, a very pleasant trip with good friends and my son Nate. Bill"

6689824,prov1800,2022-10-04 11:24:00,5010,Great report Bill.Sorry we again didn't get hooked up.To bad about the tire.I have only once had a trailer tire blow and that was on Hwy#105 with zero shoulder as you know.Cedar is a fantastic destination with its moderate size and can be fished most days.Glad to hear your crew had a good time.Water temp yesterday at 57F so not much of a change with the warner Temps we have had.
