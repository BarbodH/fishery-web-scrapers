They has some packs of tiny crawfish plastics, which looked very good, I wish I had bought a pack of them. The clear pack had Japanese? markings on it. Anybody know what the brand name is? Like a dummy, I forgot to look. Thanks! (Trip report to follow, as soon as I get the pictures.) Bill"

6689830,Bill Krejca,2022-10-04 11:58:00,6107,"They were soft plastic, may not have had craws. The store was on the north? side of the road right side heading home). Bill"
6689876,gordy28,2022-10-04 15:52:00,437,So there are a few brands that are more likely to have Japanese writing on the packJackall https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Jack...-SOFTJACK.htmlKeitech https://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Keit...page-KSPL.htmlBut I am not sure. The other small crawfish bait I know and have used on a Ned Rig is the TRD Craw https://www.zmanfishing.com/cms/products/trd_crawz/Or the Tiny Ticklerzhttps://www.zmanfishing.com/cms/products/tiny-ticklerz/Hope you find it Andrew

6690038,prov1800,2022-10-05 10:57:00,5010,So iam not into a lot of artificial stuff but do on occasions use them.This one is one of them and works great on about any species especially walleye and bass.Not sure where I got them but something tells me bobbies in Vermilion Bay.Can insert a jig inside near tail and pop eye through and bring hook out near head and crawl it along the bottom and through the rocks.Youll be glad to know crappies like it to.
6690058,Bill Krejca,2022-10-05 11:51:00,6107,"Sorta what I had in mind! The baits I saw were not quite the same, maybe it doesn't matter that much. Or maybe it does! Bill"
