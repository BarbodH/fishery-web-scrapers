6690568,prov1800,2022-10-08 07:45:00,5010,Of course in did in my younger days before I got married.Better than any candy store.

6690294,RichA$1970,2022-10-06 13:55:00,1159,"Good luck John on the deer season as that terrain is tough and a challenge especially with all of the elements. Makes my farm look simple as the only challenge I have is which of the 77 stands on the farm to choose from. One reason I do like fishing better than deer hunting is I can clean 2-4 fish in minutes vs, 1.5 hours to dress, skin and debone a deer."
6690298,Eckohlt,2022-10-06 14:22:00,3685,Rich do you remember where all 77 stands are??
6690306,prov1800,2022-10-06 15:42:00,5010,Thx Rich.I like the season switch.iam down to a few areas.Used to run 25+ But heard went downhill and the trophy hunters stopped coming.Might be like that this year.Not seeing much sign.Time will tell at my baits.Only have one hunter coming and he comes no matter what the land has to offer.I let 3 150 class bucks go last year hoping they would be a bit larger this year so hoping one made it through last year's horrible winter.I ended up taking a small buck instead with good genes sporting a decent set of antlers for a 1 1/2 year old buck.Was tasty.Iam sure you know where all your stands are.I have 1235 way points on my Lowrance and could get to them all without my unit.lol.heres a night runner I never saw in daytime.
6690346,RichA$1970,2022-10-06 18:57:00,1159,"John,Funny how they are always near the stand or scrapes at 0230. Actually might get a frost this weekend which is early but good as all the leaves are still up but this cold will send the snakes to their dens. Eck,I have a list but also use HuntStand app that is really sweet as I usually just use the stars or moonlight to get to them and follow the app, although I probably only hunt 8 of them."
6690414,prov1800,2022-10-07 07:15:00,5010,Yes they always come in the wee hours unless your not there.lol.
6690478,Wawajake,2022-10-07 12:48:00,413,".....Interesting ! Both my parents immigrated from Zwolle Holland in 1954. I have visited once in 1996. Aunt , Uncle and Cousins visited here in July. They were very impressed with Northern Ont. Tot Ziens !!"
6690190,RichA$1970,2022-10-06 07:10:00,1159,I think everyone who got to Canada this year should consider themselves lucky to enjoy it in a less stressed environment based on those who chose not to come. Now to deer season that I love but time will fly and everyone will be talking about their 2023 trips planned.
6690200,prov1800,2022-10-06 07:57:00,5010,Snowing today Rich.-4 and 30 km winds from the north.Ive decided to stay on land today.Going to Clarks around lunch to meet up with a few guys and chat a while and get some WI cheese.There out there though.Tough dudes.Think their up to around 700 walleyes so far which is slowish for them compared to previous years.Saw 4 other private boats there but not sure how there doing.Otherwise no other boats on the lake.Ive started my deer baits.Will see what happens.Last winter iam sure our winter killed a lot of deer and will find out soon and see what kind of activity there will be.I can take ATV right from house and about 10 mi run to my second bait.Good grouse hunting as I go.
6690204,Bill Krejca,2022-10-06 08:10:00,6107,"Back home, expressing gratitude for having gone, time for me to further reflect on recent trip, what worked, what didn't, what to try next year, and hope for continued health for another trip in 2023 to God's Country. At 84 years of age, you never know...... Bill"
6690212,prov1800,2022-10-06 08:33:00,5010,Stay healthy Bill and come back we still have to meet up and tell each other some fishing stories.lol.Next weekooking not bad so I'll have to go play on lake a bit but will put boat away soon and concentrate on deer hunting next.
6690226,Eckohlt,2022-10-06 09:54:00,3685,"Eight weeks will go by fast,be ready john!!"
6690230,prov1800,2022-10-06 09:59:00,5010,I was born ready.haha.
6690232,Eckohlt,2022-10-06 10:01:00,3685,We're born in a hospital or in a boat??
6690248,prov1800,2022-10-06 10:57:00,5010,At home in Amsterdam.
6690252,Eckohlt,2022-10-06 11:08:00,3685,Is that in Saskatchewan??
6690258,prov1800,2022-10-06 11:13:00,5010,"Lol.No not Sask.There is a Amsterdam in Manitoba but my Amsterdam was in Holland.Across the big big pond.I have relates catching 50"" pike 35""+zanders(walleye) and 20"" perch.You might want to book a trip there.lol."
6688858,prov1800,2022-09-29 08:43:00,5010,As far as 2022 goes personally as far as guiding goes has been a awesome season.I would not of known there was a pandemic or any border restrictions.Had a lot of old parties come back and made many new friends.Spring was very busy as usuall and rest of season also busy.Camps I did guide at were all busy.I did have a couple of no shows and that was the worst part for the camp owners in my books.I found the serious fisherman got their shots and didn't let that get in there way of something they enjoyed.With mandates gone for October we will see how what happens.Think it will be slow as usual for October.Maybe a few crazy muskie fisherman will come and freeze their butts off.Ill pick a few days to head out.Trout closes end of month so might go tomorrow and enjoy the pretty nice day there calling for.Some hardy guys coming to Clarks next week as they always do and weather looking good so I'll get couple days in also.Might have to post couple more fishing pics if I get lucky.Heres a rainbow first thing this morning north of my house.
6688972,nitroman,2022-09-30 06:54:00,368,"Cheers to a good season sir, someday the stars will align and we may pass each other on Cedar! Have a great off season and keep the posts and pics coming as it helps sooth the itch for us south of the border."
6688974,prov1800,2022-09-30 06:57:00,5010,I'll try my best.
6688986,Golden Eagle,2022-09-30 07:38:00,2642,It's a sad time. I've enjoyed several Thanksgiving dinners with my outfitter's family and moose hunters.
6689010,Ogoki,2022-09-30 08:39:00,291,"My Ontario season not over yet . Wife and I are headed up I75 in northern Michigan , on our way to fly in moose hunt out of Nakina . Weather shows snow flurries , later part of the week . Last moose hunt , the last week of September one year , we had 85 degree temps and very strong southwest winds . Looks like we will have much better moose hunting conditions this trip . Hopefully eat a few walleye and see a bull . Bringing along a small chainsaw to make sure we have firewood . Trees just beginning to show color . One thing for sure , a nursing home wonâ€™t get this money . LOL"
6689020,Twodogs,2022-09-30 09:19:00,115,John was a pleasure getting to know you this Spring...Looking forward to your ice fisdhing reports but not to soon please ...
6689178,prov1800,2022-10-01 08:18:00,5010,Hope not to soon.Still some open water fishing and deer season next.thinking some time in Dec before drilling any holes in the ice.
6690176,DavidHamil,2022-10-06 05:05:00,1,It's a sad time because the season has been gone to be end.
6690178,Eckohlt,2022-10-06 05:22:00,3685,"New adventures next year n new lakes, always exciting to look ahead after a fishing season is over,hard water is next,eight weeks from now!"
6690184,prov1800,2022-10-06 07:00:00,5010,Only 8 weeks.geez.
