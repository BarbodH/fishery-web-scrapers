I think I was on the rig for about 4 -5 weeks. No alcohol is on the rig. Got to Palawan, and there was so much to see. Some of it was not pretty, but a lot of it was. Many of the guys went straight to the bar, and spent the weekend completely pickled. I stayed sober, and spent a ton of time riding around in trikes and jeepneys (sp?) trying to see as much as I could. I can drink at home. I got better things to do in Canada :-)"

6687150,Carnhzkr,2022-09-20 14:01:00,964,"I didn't read all of the replies to this point, so these questions have likely already been answered, but I'll reply anyway.I ALWAYS stop a the DF on my way into Canada, and I do on the way back home if there's not a big line of cars waiting to cross. Why? Because I'm a cheapskate. It doesn't matter if you buy alcohol at your local Sam's or at the DF. Booze is booze no matter where it's purchased. You're allowed to take 1 case of beer OR one bottle of liquor/wine per person without paying duty. Anything above that is subject to duty. It really comes down to the border guard's discretion if you have to pay or he just says ""have a nice time"" and you're off. For me, I can buy a case of Bud or Miller on sale locally for about $23. For me, that $23 case of beer would be about $26.50 with tax and deposit, but I can buy a case of Canadian beer, say Molson or Labatts for $18.50 (I think Moosehead is $17), and that's the price out the door, i.e., no tax or deposit. When I'm in Canada, I prefer to drink Canadian beer over Bud or Miller, so that decision is a no-brainer.On my way home, I like to stock up my bar so I usually buy a couple bottles of Johnnie Walker Black or whatever booze I'm short on. I only save about $5 - $10 per bottle over the Sam's Club price, but that's $10 - $20 per trip and I make 3 trips per year.I usually take in more than my allotted 1 case PP. Typically, I'll take an additional 6 or 8 cans of whatever I have in my beer fridge and I declare those and have only once been asked to pull up to pay the duty. I think that time I had a full case over (between 2 people) and had to pay around $9. If I remember correctly, they only take CC when paying duty. I might be wrong on that, but that's what I remember. I've been told by the friendly guy that runs the DF on the Fort Frances side that paying American duty is much less than bringing it north, but I've never experienced that. He said it's only a couple bucks per bottle taking it in to US.I think you got the where the DF shop is in International Falls, it's the gas station just before you get to Border Bobs. You have to go right past it. I always top off my tank there anyway, so it's a convenient stop. So what you do is you go in and tell the lady what you want. She'll ask what state you're from. You pay and get a receipt. You take your receipt to the little shack after you pay the bridge toll and immediately before you cross the bridge. Knock on the door (the secret code is 3 quick knocks, then 2 with long pauses) and they'll bring out your purchase to you.Again, it doesn't matter where you buy it, it's the same restrictions, it's just cheaper at the DF.One bad thing about the DF in Inter Falls, they have a very limited selection of Canadian beer. They only stock Molson, Labatt, & Moosehead. They used to have Kokanee, but I haven't seen that since before COVID. I've only been able to get Molson on one of three trips this year, since they're always out. The DF crossing at Baudette has a much better selection."
6688498,C182P,2022-09-27 08:48:00,59,"Take as many bottles with as he wants. Declare them when entering Canada, go inside and pay about 20% combined GST PST etc taxes on the value of the excess over one liter. Have him keep the receipts from where he buys his booze. Hand it to the customs agent inside the building, present credit card, and away you go. DF is no big savings, and you still need to declare any excess over a liter and pay the GST PST once entering Canada."
6688832,nitroman,2022-09-29 06:56:00,368,We find it easier to take our limit or just over then stop at the beer store in FF for the balance of our needs for the week. No hassle and in and out quick in one stop. Gotta get to the hotel on Friday night to have a few of those Canadian beers we dreamt about all winter long!!
6686990,ohiojmj,2022-09-19 16:22:00,1262,"On way back to US in August, I bought 4 pack of Crown liters at duty free for $77US. Declared at border customs, no duty. Never saw such great beer or liquor deals on way to Canada. Sent from my SM-T220 using Tapatalk"
6686996,stjoeguy,2022-09-19 16:52:00,979,"1) Jameson 1 liter is $19.00. A case of LaBatt Blue is $18.50. I don't know if that's cheaper or not. Probably, but have your buddy check. 2) Where you bought it doesn't matter at the border booth. What counts is how much. No list, the agent asks how much and you answer. It sounds like you won't be over the limit, but if you are the border agent may just let you pass or ask you to pull over and go inside to pay the duty. Don't offer the border booth agen money, i don't think that would go over well. 3) I don't know how much the duty is, but you'll pay it on whatever is over the limit and then usually on whatever is cheapest. It's still less than buying it in Canada. 4) Duty Free Americas in International Falls is located at 226 1/2 2nd Ave about a half block before crossing the bridge. We always stop at the duty free in International Falls, partly because it's tradition. It's the last place to get gas before crossing the border and they offer a discount for buying gas with cash. Gas up, go inside to pay cash and order the beer or liquor. You don't take the booze off the shelf. Just order it at the counter inside. Then go out, start toward the bridge, pay the bridge toll, go across the tracks and pullover to the right at the small building IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TRACKS AND BEFORE STARTING THE BRIDGE. This is where you pick up the liquor. Then proceed across the bridge to the border. If you cross the bridge with out stopping at the liquor pick up building you'll have to cross the border into Canada, walk back into the US, go through US customs, get the booze and walk back accross the bridge to go through Canada customs again. Don't ask me how I know."
6687002,walleyecheek,2022-09-19 17:23:00,2231,lol.
6687006,cuamb,2022-09-19 17:48:00,203,"Duty free means you do not pay the tax in the country you purchase it. So if you buy in International Falls you will not pay the US tax. That is why they don't give it to you until you are at the border. As others have said, when you enter Canada you will have to pay the duty on anything over the 1 liter limit. (Sometimes they just say have a nice trip and don't charge). If you are just bringing 1 liter it should be cheaper at the duty free shop but you should check prices. We have guys who stop and buy Crown Royal at the duty free shop in Fort Frances on our way home. They stay under the limit and they claim it is cheaper than you can purchase back home."
6687016,Clairebear,2022-09-19 18:56:00,937,Our Cdn dollar took a $hit kicking again so the U$ dollar converted may just buy what you want here.
6687032,Aspencreek,2022-09-19 21:20:00,2911,"Exactly..........I am amazed at all the trouble, hassle, and work to try and save a couple bucks. When we go over the border, each one in the party brings either a bottle or case (the limit) if we need more as the week progresses we go buy more. But, our group does NOT go to Canada to drink, we go to fish. I can drink at home. In over 15 trips we have had only 1 guy that will not be invited back with us because he drank to excess."
6687066,REG,2022-09-20 06:06:00,445,"This wouldn't be an issue for you, and I know that Jameson is Irish, but if you're into Scotch, there are some bottles that distilleries make available only through duty-free outlets. I've never bothered looking in Intl Falls since I'm more interested in getting up north as soon as possible but I also suspect they wouldn't have the selection like a duty free shop in a big airport like Heathrow would for example.."
6687076,RichA$1970,2022-09-20 06:40:00,1159,"The only attraction of Duty Free to me are the hot chicks working in the foreign airports. Like others have said, if you need more than a case or a bottle in a week that person has a problem or not much into fishing."
6687114,Eckohlt,2022-09-20 09:32:00,3685,"Your right,it took me a number of years to wise up!!!for the better."
6687118,NM_Trout,2022-09-20 10:10:00,1094,Excellent detail. Thank you.
6686934,NM_Trout,2022-09-19 11:29:00,1094,"Oh, and use small words :-)I don't smoke, and I only drink lightly. I'm mostly headed to Canada with my kids and our alcohol consumption is pretty small.However, I am headed up next year with a buddy, and he likes his Jameson. I'm trying to figure out if there is a benefit to purchasing duty free alcohol.I *think* that the duty free shops are exempt from duty fees that would normally be paid at the border should a person exceed their personal allowance. Some questions :1) For those of you who use duty free shopping, do you really save that much over buying alcohol at a warehouse place and just paying duty when you go through?2) If you are bringing more than your allotment in, and it is not purchased from duty free, where do you pay? My experience is mostly just going through the drive through booths at the border crossings. Do you hand the immigration person at the booth a list of stuff and a handful of cash? 3) How much are duty fees?4) For heading into Canada, where are duty free shops located? On the US side or the CAN side using the border guard as a reference? Trying to figure out the pros and cons of buying in US and needing to pay duty, or shopping at a duty free, OR just buying in Canada. Not having any experience with this, I am mostly interested in avoiding a hassle factor. Thoughts?"
6686944,Huntindave,2022-09-19 11:54:00,2194,Don't overthink this. Let your buddy determine how much he wants to bring and where he chooses to purchase it. What he does is his hassle to deal with.
6686946,btyreprich,2022-09-19 12:18:00,1067,A case of beer for me on a week long trip and I'd share this with my friend. Never did take a bottle of liquor on the trip. I used to work as a head cashier at a chain of liquor stores in Chicagoland area and once I did compare duty free prices to some of our sale prices. I remember duty free wasn't a bargain at all. Might be due to the fact we had close to 30 stores and could buy in large quantities for lower unit costs.
6686952,NM_Trout,2022-09-19 13:05:00,1094,Not just his hassle. We are traveling together and hassle to one is hassle to everyone in the car.
6686964,GBS,2022-09-19 13:55:00,2271,"Google works - Here in Mn, one warehouse store lists 1L of Jameson at $25.49 The Duty Free in International Falls lists it at $19.00 In Fort Francis, a 1.14L bottle lists at $49.00 (CN) Interesting that according to this, if that 1L bottle was OVER the personal exemption (because he brought other things too), then the additional duty to be paid for importing would be ~$37.00 !!!http://www.canadiandutycalculator.ca/index.php Guess it depends on how much of a hassle it is to stop for him to save $6.50."
6686968,bthomas3333,2022-09-19 14:26:00,465,Here's what we do. Each guy brings a bottle of whatever he wants. That is enough for most guys. If they need more (sad to say this) but let them bring what they 'need'. Forcing someone on the wagon at a remote outpost is not pretty. If he needs more than one bottle let him bring it/declare it/pay duty. Just how we deal with it. Brett
6686970,NM_Trout,2022-09-19 14:27:00,1094,Getting closer. What about question #2? How does one go about paying duty? Do you go inside or handle it at the drive through window when they are ensuring that no US residency night crawlers are in the car?
6686972,bthomas3333,2022-09-19 14:34:00,465,"For us we declare it. Then about 50% of the time they say have a nice trip. The other 50% they say please pull over and go inside. You show them what you have and they collect the duty.Thanks,Brett"
6686982,walleyecheek,2022-09-19 15:30:00,2231,"LOL. Since you ""drink lightly"" tell your buddy to forget the Jameson ! And pick up a 1.75 liter of Crown Royal at wally world for around $55 and your good to go. No duty to contend with. Have a good trip. LOL."
6686986,eyecatcher1,2022-09-19 15:54:00,323,"You have to go inside to pay the duty. I called the duty free store in International Falls a few weeks ago to ask about the advantage of buying beer there since I knew that I would need more than one case. Their price was less than buying in Canada, but she said I would have to stop and pay about $12 per case duty when I got into Canada. A little less than buying in Canada, but is it worth the hassle?"
