My 23 year old daughter joined my wife, oldest son and me for her first ever trip to Canada. She had an absolute blast and no complaints about a few days of clouds and a couple days of rain. She was a trooper in agreeing to wear my rain gear (I'm much taller). We were fortunate to find hot Walleye spots every day- mostly deeper in 24' to 34' feet. My daughter enjoys casting more than jigging so we found some spots to do both- she had a great time tossing crank baits for smallies. We did struggle to find Northern, perhaps the water in the bays was too cold. Amazingly, my son and I both caught Musky (his on a jig and mine on jigging rap)."
