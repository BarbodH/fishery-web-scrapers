This will be our first flyin as we normally just go to drive in reports on Lac Seul or Cedar. We selected Slate Falls as our outfitter after much research. I’m sure we’ll be happy with the service and accommodations. My only concern is finding fish on a brand new ‘big’ lake without using live minnows. We picked St Joe because it has big fish and numbers potential like Lac Seul. But we wanted to get away from the crowds. I’d love to get some fishing advice from some folks who’ve fished St Joe in late summer. Maybe, someone’s even stayed at Eagle Island with SFO and could offer up some areas to try. Anyway, thanks in advance for any replies"
6686794,BCNeal,2022-09-18 13:50:00,19,"Our group has been on Lake St Joe 7 times since 2018 and we've learned you don't need live bait whether it's June, August or September.We were at Root Bay outpost last year mid-August and at Eagle Island the first week of September. We found the fish hit plastic 3""-4"" paddle tails and flukes as readily as they bit for the one guy in our group using crawlers. 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs and plastics will be all you need.If you're not confident using just plastics have a few crawlers on hand but you'll soon realize they aren't necessary. It's an amazing lake for numbers and above average size walleyes. I'm guessing the average size on those August-Sept trips was 19""-21"" with a few 25"" and 26"" fish mixed in.Find the fish and they'll keep you busy!"
6686906,gordy28,2022-09-19 08:32:00,437,"We fished Root Bay in 2020 the third week of August We mainly caught fish trolling w bottom bouncers/harnesses and jigging with grubs/paddle tails tipped w a worm. We didn’t fish close to Eagle Island but generally we found fish where they should be. Where the root river exits (called the pin cushion by SFO) we caught loss of walleye, we also did well in the main lake fishing wind blown islands, humps and reefs. We took in a flat of worms and some minnows but no real difference between a jig tipped w a minnow or a worm. Full report here We do a detailed report after each trip https://www.northernjacks.com/amp/st...ph-trip-reportCheersAndrew"
6687208,MOfish,2022-09-20 17:39:00,39,"Thanks for the replies. We’ll be sure to bring some crawlers, harnesses, bottom bouncers, jigs, paddle tails and flukes. Any special crank baits?"
6687616,gordy28,2022-09-22 18:09:00,437,We didn’t fish crank baits a ton. I did have some luck trolling rapala J 13s and one of our group did okay with an gold hot n tot but bulk of our fish were on bouncers and jigs Andrew
6687718,stjoeguy,2022-09-23 07:42:00,979,"I also don't use cranks on St. Joe. 95% jigs, 5% spoons. I know some that have used Rapalas (#9 CountDown Clown, right Ziggy?), and I bring a few along but never get around to using them."
6688576,ziggyzag,2022-09-27 13:06:00,125,I would not leave home without them. Took my 10 year old grandson this past June and I am sure he to would not leave home without some!!!!!!!
6688578,Bigtaproot,2022-09-27 13:08:00,900,St Joe in august is a fish factory. Find a 15 to 20 foot hump and pick any color 1/4 or 3/8 jig with white or yellow plastic and hold on
6688936,SweetD,2022-09-29 18:37:00,243,"We were there in mid July (Root Bay. You do not need live bait of any kind and you will catch piles of fish unless Armageddon strikes! We used Berkley Powerbait Twitchtail minnow. Like the black ice, blue ice, purple and ice and 1/8 to 1/4 oz jigs. Drifted and jigged mostly and caught tons on f fish……..me and boat partner boated over 140 walleyes off an island point in 8-22’ of water and fished for approximately 5-6 hours there! I repeat do not waste your money nor your time messing with live bait!Good luck"
6689056,Muskylover,2022-09-30 12:14:00,4,"I’ve been to St Joe several times. You could teach a chimp to catch walleyes there. Just drop an all white jig heavy enough to get to the bottom, depending on the wind, and raise it up about a foot. Also, in August they’ll bite on 1 oz spoons. Any color really, but smooth silver was my best. Didn’t experience huge walleye, but unbelievable numbers."
