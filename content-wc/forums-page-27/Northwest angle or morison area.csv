Do we have to be concerned about being to busy. ?How far do you have to travel gravel road to get up into the northwest angel. ?And any other suggestions you have would be appreciated. Thanks"
6689014,DeBo,2022-09-30 08:55:00,211,Roughly 25 miles of gravel going to the Angle. You won’t be alone in either area…. Some of the water that wanderers fish from both locations is shared. You can drive as much as you want from either location and fish a variety of different waters. In general you are dealing with bigger water out of Morson but you can go east and fish in any wind if you want. I’ve spent more time at Morson but really enjoyed my trip to the Angle region.

The dirt/dust/mud is difficult to wash off. I love the NW Angle area to fish though, on the Ontario side. The drive up on the lake out of Morson to the NW Angle is long and beautiful. Mapping GPS is essential. No gravel at all to get to Morson except if you're going to launch out of a resort like Mylie's, then there's a little gravel road."

6689044,NETim1187,2022-09-30 10:44:00,166,"From Morson to Young's Bay by boat would be about a 45 mile boat ride. It's a largely sheltered route but there will be areas that will be open to some possibly rough water, particularly with a west/south wind. On a nice day, it's a fun trip."
6689048,proguidedream,2022-09-30 11:16:00,345,"the angle also competes with guys making the trip by boat from kenora, and even worse Wileys Point lodge."
6689066,Old Timer,2022-09-30 13:56:00,255,"I have fished the NW Angle and Morson. All said I think Morson is a better bet. For me, the drive from home is shorter and the gravel road into the Angle is really hard on a rig. A lot of people fishing the Angle will stay in Minnesota. If you do the same you'll have far more competition than if you fish from Morson. If choosing the Angle I would plan on fishing the Canada side, out east of Windfall and Windigo Islands, and up towards Monument Bay. Pretty water up that way. If you stay on Flag or Oak you'll limit your time on open water."
