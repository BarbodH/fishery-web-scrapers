6689988,zenfish,2022-10-05 06:23:00,14,"Overdue trip report from July 8-15 at Cliff Lake Resorts Lost Bay Resort. Overall 4.8 stars. Extremely well kept cabins, boats, docking, and fish cleaning house. Owners Tyler and Sara and camp staff Barry were really friendly and helpful. Didn't really target walleye but still ended up with 6 or so in the 24"" range. I did a guide trip with Tyler one day and it was more than worth it. I had never fished muskies and he put me on a bunch. Saw 7, hooked 4, landed 3. 44"", 43"", and 38"". Lost another mid 40's fish. We also jigged up 7 lake trout 20-24"". That's quite a day! The rest of the week I split time targeting lakers and musky. Caught LOTS of lakers. Landed a few more muskies and saw a bunch. Lost another monster. Scenery on Cliff is second to none. Other camp guests were really friendly and helpful as well. So...great lodge, great people, great fishing, great scenery, reasonable price. Pretty much checks all the boxes. I would have liked a comfortable chair/couch in the cabin for reading at night but that is truly the only thing I would change(when I mentioned it to Tyler he did bring me a padded lawn chair). I will definitely be back! Oh, I also have to mention that the shower in my cabin had amazingly good water pressure! Minor detail but I appreciated it."

6690100,zenfish,2022-10-05 13:46:00,14,Haha. Tyler probably knows a few places to dispose of a body. I wouldn't want to end up as bear bait!
6690102,Eckohlt,2022-10-05 14:01:00,3685,Ya your probably right lol.
6690110,7 Mag,2022-10-05 14:13:00,1887,Did they film you for their fishing show?
6690126,zenfish,2022-10-05 17:01:00,14,No they didn't. I did volunteer for that though!
6690128,7 Mag,2022-10-05 17:29:00,1887,"I enjoy watching them, one of the better fishing shows in my opinion. Great report and nice fish!"
6690132,zenfish,2022-10-05 17:48:00,14,Thanks! I agree that they do a pretty good show. Real life personalities are slightly toned down but mostly just like the show. Good folks for sure.
