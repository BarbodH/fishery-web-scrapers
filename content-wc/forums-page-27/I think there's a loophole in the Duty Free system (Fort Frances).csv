6687562,ziggyzag,2022-09-22 12:07:00,125,Crossed this spring Sault St. Marie stop by DF got booze they asked for license plate numbers.! Just Saying maybe they are watching?
6688636,Carnhzkr,2022-09-27 17:29:00,964,"Ya know, I kinda forgot all about that. Had I remembered, I could have gotten it back to you this past June. I've told my wife, who's much better at remembering things like that than me, and I'll let you know the next time I'm passing through VB, next June. In the mean time, the pot is sitting on a shelf in my basement and has not seen a stove since I used it to warm up some chili on an Eagle Lake island in Sept 2021."
6687396,Jesse-WI,2022-09-21 14:03:00,534,It would be interesting to see if you can pay cash and not give them a license plate number or not show an ID.
6687400,Carnhzkr,2022-09-21 14:26:00,964,"I did pay cash this last time. Usually, I'd use a CC, but I had cash and asked if they gave change in US or CDN and he said either so I gave him Jacksons. They don't take a plate number. It's just like buying beer at your local liquor store. I just thought it was odd that they've done away with the method they used to have in place to ensure the booze went over the border. Next year, I'll try to remember to ask the guy what prevents a customer from taking it north instead of south. I'd be curious to hear what he has to say."
6687410,walleyecheek,2022-09-21 15:20:00,2231,You Cedar Rapidians !!!!!..........LOL.LOL.LOL.LOL
6687442,Mojo-NC,2022-09-21 18:22:00,1929,"I don't care where you live and I don't want to make any assumptions about your family ancestry, but I do like the way you think! I dunno, maybe it is the Swede coming out in me too. We might just give your method a whirl next year..."
6687444,v-bay gord,2022-09-21 19:00:00,3168,While you're figuring out an angle to get duty free booze across the border how about bringing back the cooking pot you left with from your cabin. The wife is still bitter about that.......
6687480,Bigtaproot,2022-09-22 07:12:00,900,It is no secret that the GPF and I like to drink. It is our number one hobby. Thanks for the advice and captain Morgan sales in Canada will skyrocket. I can't say on this board what our number two hobby is!!!!!
6687484,Carnhzkr,2022-09-22 07:21:00,964,Skinny skiing?
6687490,Jesse-WI,2022-09-22 07:30:00,534,Well I suppose labor shortages or illness could be driving a move to the honor system. Its also possible the whole area is on CCTV now.

6687306,Carnhzkr,2022-09-21 07:21:00,964,"Since my Canadian fishing trips are now over for this year, I'll write a thread about two of my other favorite passions: 1. Drinking 2. Sticking it to The ManThe idea behind the Duty Free shops is that they allow an international traveler to purchase certain goods on one side of the border if those goods are to be consumed on the other side, so that the duty (taxes) are paid to the side on which the goods are consumed. The DF shops are typically logistically situated so that, once you take possession of the goods (let's say booze), your only option is to cross the border. For example, the DF in International Falls is on the last block before you cross, but where you actually take possession is literally 10 feet from the bridge. You can't turn around and go back into MN to drink the booze, you have to continue across the border.Likewise, on the Fort Frances side, it USED TO BE that you went in to the DF which is one block from the crossing, you paid for your booze, petted the golden retriever, then got back into your vehicle and proceeded to the very last intersection in town, at which point you'd wait for a delivery vehicle to drive up along side you and hand-deliver your goods. I'm not sure when that changed, but they've done away with the delivery vehicle part. Now, you go into the store, buy your booze, pet the dog, and the nice guy hands you your goods across the counter and you're on your way. My point is, once you have your booze, there's nothing stopping you from driving north or south. So if a person wanted to take more than their allotted 1 case or 1 bottle PP into Canada, there's nothing stopping you from buying all you want from the DF in Fort Frances and continuing on to your lodge, is there? I don't know what it'd be.Do you really need to drink that much? Good question. I guess where this might come in handy is if you wanted to buy a bottle as a gift for the lodge owner, or if you have a group of 10 guys and want to take in 15 cases. You could either pay duty on the 5 cases above your limit (about $45) or buy the 5 extra cases on the Ontario side, which would be about $45 - $50 US per case. Also, if you like to share a bottle of wine at dinner, it'd be a lot cheaper buying your 7 bottles of wine from the DF than from the LCBO. Anyone see any flaws in that?"
6687308,NM_Trout,2022-09-21 07:26:00,1094,We may be related.
6687350,Jesse-WI,2022-09-21 10:42:00,534,"It is against the law to purchase duty free and then not cross the border. (check the faq, they need to be on the other side of the border for 48 hours before bringing them back) Do you really think they are still not checking?"
6687354,Carnhzkr,2022-09-21 10:58:00,964,"Do I really think they are still not checking what? What's to check? They don't take down my license plate. They don't record any info to track, other than my CC number. That's my point. There's no way to track that the booze they hand you over the counter makes it across the border, unless there's something going on I'm not aware of, which is entirely possible. Look, I'm not going to do it, I don't need to (but I'd like someone else to try it and see if it works), but it just occurred to me as I crossed last Saturday that you could take it north just as easily as taking it south and no one would know.As far as being against the law, so is speeding. I suppose you never go over 55 on state highways."
6687360,walleyecheek,2022-09-21 11:15:00,2231,Just drink and be merry ! You people are way over thinking things !!!
6687366,Eckohlt,2022-09-21 12:20:00,3685,"Way over thinking n way over drinking,has a nice ring to it doughnut."
6687374,Carnhzkr,2022-09-21 12:57:00,964,"You people? You racist *******. Who are you referring to as ""you people"", us half-Swedes or Iowans?"
6687376,Baseline,2022-09-21 13:02:00,3207,"One thing you don't know is the duty free shop places a GPS tracker into the packaging. Not only does the Canadian Government know where you went, but the tracker accesses your phone. Though the phone they can track you to all your hotspots on the lake and then transmit all the hotspots to the rest of the people fishing that lake. It was comical when you said you had finished with your trips for year and could now tell us how to subvert the duty-free system. How do you know Walleye Central isn't monitoring each post and contacting the Canadian Govt. and reporting law breakers? Watch it when you cross the border in 2023 as they may be looking for you."
6687382,Eckohlt,2022-09-21 13:11:00,3685,Sounds like a Sean Connery 007 agent movie happening at the duty free store!!
6687386,Carnhzkr,2022-09-21 13:30:00,964,"I can't believe you didn't even mention the chip that got injected with the COVID vaccines. I'm sure the chip gets scanned when you walk in to the DF shop. If they don't detect the chip at the border crossing within one hour of leaving the DF, an APB gets issued for your arrest."
