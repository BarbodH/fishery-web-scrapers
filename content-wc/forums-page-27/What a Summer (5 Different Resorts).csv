6688532,jimwalleye,2022-09-27 10:19:00,30,"What a Summer (Lac Des Mille Lac, Lake of the Woods, Lake Athabasca, Kasba Lake, and God's Lake) Due to the Covid roll over I had almost 7 weeks fishing in Canada this summer. It felt like a marathon fishing summer, and by the end of the summer I can honestly say that I was glad to be home and not have another fishing trip looming over me. After moving to Florida from Iowa, I found it much easier just to store my boat in International Falls since I don't do a lot of fishing in Florida. I probably should fish more in Florida but it sure is handy not to have to haul a boat from Florida to Canada. Here is how the summer unfolded.Pine Point Resort Lac Des Mille Lac I talked my wife into going to Ontario for the first two weeks. She is not much of a fisherman but we ventured to Lac Des Mille Lac west of Thunderbay Ontario the first week of June at Pine Point Resort. I've fished Lac Des Mille Lac since my dad started taking me to Canada in the 1960's so I have a lot of experience on that lake. Fishing in years past on Lac Des Mille Lac was exceptional and for many years we caught some real trophy walleyes and northerns on our annual trip. I believe the quality of the fishing has declined over the years but it's still a beautiful lake and a great fishery. With that said, I may have taken my last trip there as I would much prefer to fish Lac Seul where the size and quantity is much better than I have been experiencing the last few years I have fished Lac Des Mille Lac. The slot limits imposed on Lac Des Mille is 13-18, with one walleye over 18 and the walleyes under 13 are protected. Most of the resorts like Fisherman's Cove on Lac Seul do not let you keep any walleyes larger than 18 which encourages a much larger average walleye fishery. Years ago, there weren't any smallmouth bass on Lac Des Mille Lac. I believe they were probably introduced by fishermen who may have been staying at the resort at the end of Lac Des Mille Lac on Baril Bay. The portage lake, Baril lake, has a population of lake trout and pike and smallmouth bass, and we have portaged over to fish Baril years ago. I'm just wondering if a fisherman not wanting to clean his catch at the end of the day released some smallies, because that is the area of the lake that the smallmouth bass first started showing up years ago. Now the smallmouth fishery is very good on Lac Des Mille Lac. The cabins are very adequate and the location of Pine Point is excellent. We always used to arrive late on a Saturday morning and leave early the following Saturday. We did this for years; I hadn't been back to the resort for a number of years and learned Thursday night that we had to be out of the cabin by 9 a.m. Friday. Covid was the explained reason for the change because they had to clean the cabins. I had never bothered to read the reservation fine print because I was so used to the old schedule. The good news was that Gail at Witch Bay Camp, on Lake of the Woods, was able to let us arrive that Friday night and even fed us a great meal. I was a little disappointed in the Lac Des Mille Lac walleye fishing when I went up with my wife the first week of June. I caught walleyes and plenty to eat but nothing big. My wife is not really a fisherman. She was a trooper and went on this two week trip to Ontario so that I would have someone to fish with. Did I tell you that she doesn't like bugs. Witch Bay Camp, Lake of the Woods The second week in Ontario we went to a new camp we had never been to before, Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods. The road into camp pulling my Pro V was a little rough but I went very slow so it wasn't any problem. This is a hidden gem on Lake of the Woods. I have never in all my years of fishing had such nice camp owners bending over backwards to make your trip enjoyable. Gail and her husband, the camp owners, were nothing short of fantastic. And boy was the camp nice, the nicest cabins that I have stayed in since I started fishing in Canada. My wife loved it, she never got into the boat the entire week, just stayed in camp and enjoyed the view, and the fantastic food that the lodge provided. If you are looking for a place to take your wife that caters to your every need, you have found the right resort if you take her to Witch Bay Camp. The service is great as well and we even had coffee delivered to our room each morning. The fishing was really good, we arrived the second week in June and the water levels were extremely high. One of the nice things about this resort is that they will provide a guide for a day or more to help you locate the fish at no extra charge. I fished one whole day in a guide's boat for walleyes and smallmouth bass and pike and caught lots of nice fish. I didn't fish really hard this week, I just went out for about six hours a day by myself and enjoyed casting for bass, walleyes, pike, and muskies. I did get lucky and I caught three muskies while at this camp. If you like to fish musky this resort should be on your bucket list. The smallmouth fishing was fantastic, with many trophy sized smallies. It was hard to take pictures of fish, fishing by yourself; here was my best attempt at taking fish pictures. The largest musky was close to 40 inches, so not huge but really fun to catch on light line. The beds in the cabin were fantastic, I went so far as to try and find the same type of Beautyrest mattress in the states that were in the cabins to replace my home mattress. This is a beautiful part of Lake of the Woods, you should definitely consider this resort.Lakers Unlimited Lake Athabasca (First two weeks in July) The highlight of my summer was spending two weeks on Lake Athabasca at Lakers Unlimited. We flew into Fort McMurray on a Thursday afternoon for a Friday afternoon departure because we did not want to change problems with the airlines and miss our flight into the resort. The float plane ride into camp is extremely interesting as you fly over the oil sand operations of Alberta. The Athabasca sand dunes are the most northerly active sand dune formations on earth. This is a fantastic resort to try your hand at catching a trophy lake trout. They also boast very large northern pike, but this trip was all about the lake trout. Keith caught a 32-pound laker one morning the second week and a few minutes later I followed up with a 33-pound lake trout. We caught a lot of lake trout. One day we boated close to 75 trout although nothing over 15 pounds that day. Most days we had multiple fish over 15 pounds and usually fish in the twenty-pound class or above daily. Keith was a glutton for punishment and he went back to Lakers Unlimited for a week of fishing the first week of September. He had hoped to catch the lake trout in the shallows spawning on the reefs. There were several very windy days that made fishing difficult for him but he said one day was out of this world. He and his fishing partner had caught twenty lake trout before noon, and then they moved into the shallows and low and behold the trout had moved onto the reefs. They caught 80 lake trout during the next five hours with lake trout up to 26 pounds and many fish over the 20-pound mark. Ryan Lowry (Captain Bruce) and Carmen were very gracious hosts and the fishing and the food did not disappoint. The Kingfisher boats were exceptional with air ride seats and were very spacious and comfortable. They were powered with 70-90 Evinrude's, and the boats handled the big waters of Lake Athabasca very well. The cabins were nice, they were small but very adequate and nice showers and comfortable beds. Even though the guides were first year guides they did an excellent job. We were there two weeks and Captain Bruce switched out the guides on week two so that we would have a different experience. My fishing partner Keith liked to fish pike and I really liked to fish lake trout. We split it up on most days and since we were there the first two weeks of July we were able to get some good pike action before they all moved out to deep water. We did not catch any monster pike, the largest was 42, but one afternoon while casting a bay with emerging cabbage, we caught a dozen nice pike from 38-42 in an hour and a half. That same bay had produced a 46 pike earlier that first week in July. I would think earlier in the season you could really catch some big pike in some of the bays that we fished. This is the second trip I had made to Laker's Unlimited, the earlier trip being back in 2013 with my daughter Erin. My best lake trout on that trip was 28 pounds and I was hoping to surpass that mark and I wasn't disappointed. We didn't used down riggers on Lake Athabasca, most of the fish that we caught were in less than forty feet of water. We used medium heavy St. Croix musky rods with Shimano Tekota line counter reels, and we used in line weights of four to six ounces. Lakers Unlimited furnishes the St. Croix Rods and also a medium heavy G.Loomis rod for casting pike and lakers. This really is a great plus as not all resorts furnish rods and it really is a pain to have to travel with rods to remote places if you don't have to do that. They were excellent rods and we furnished our own reels although we wouldn't have had to do that. Here are some photos of the camp. Here's my new personal best lake trout, which weighed in at 33 pounds. The camp is designed for smaller groups and we were able to get to know all those fishermen and women in camp. Unlike some camps that cater to large groups we did not have any more than 12 people in camp at one time. Fishing for lake trout we primarily used T60 flatfish, Half Wave spoons, and Eppinger Husky Devles. I cannot say enough good things about Lakers Unlimited, great boats, great food, and accommodations, gracious hosts, and fantastic fishing. Kasba Lake Lodge, Kasba Lake Northwest Territories and Nunavut Early August found us fishing for a week at Kasba lake. This is a very large lake in the Northwest Territories and part of the lake is also in Nunavut. We were primarily fishing lake trout and northern pike with a bonus of trophy grayling on a fly out to the Kazan River. Matt and Amanda Hill run this long-time operation of the Hill family. This was my second trip to Kasba. We flew into Winnipeg and then took a flight directly to the gravel landing strip constructed on a sand esker next to the resort. We arrived for a late breakfast and fished the entire afternoon and came in for a late dinner. Shore lunch or sandwiches are the daily lunch option. We had a miserable week of weather. Cold and rainy and worst of all very strong winds. The winds limited our options for going to the fishing spots that we wanted to try. It just was not worth getting beat to death by the waves. We fished for pike in the bays to avoid the strong winds and picked up pike but nothing large. I think my largest lake trout for the week was only fourteen pounds which was a big disappointment. We also did not catch the numbers of fish which we had caught on our previous trip to Kasba. The guides do use downriggers on Kasba and it was necessary because they were deep. When I had fished Kasba Lake before in July we could flat line troll for them but in August they were too deep for that. The highlight of the trip was flying out to the Kazan River to fish for trophy grayling. The Kazan River is probably one of the premiere spots to catch a big grayling in the world. And of course, there are always the chance of catching a monster lake trout while trying your hand fishing for grayling. We did well on grayling with the largest close to 3.75 pounds. My last visit to the Kazan I had multiple 4-pound grayling. The wind was still a factor on the river, and it did not help that I did not spool my reel with light enough line. I had forgotten that I had twelve-pound test and it was difficult getting the monofilament line to sink like I would have preferred while fishing Blue Fox quarter ounce spinners. Kasba is an excellent fishery and there were some big fish caught that week with numbers of big lake trout in the low thirty-pound range being caught but it was an extremely slow bite and those that caught big fish waited all day long for that bite. And the best bite was braving the winds to travel to the East side of the lake. The food at Kasba is excellent as they have a chef that prepares gourmet meals and hors d'oeurves. You will gain weight on this trip. Matt and Amanda are excellent hosts and the guides are very professional. The boats are adequate but are only powered with forty horse power Yamahas. I missed having the fabulous Kingfisher boats that you will find at Lakers Unlimited on Lake Athabasca. Rod and reels were furnished so that is also a plus. The accommodations were very comfortable and the lodge itself is extremely nice for being in the middle of nowhere. Amanda Hill does a phenomenal job of communication helping you keep on top of all you need to know for a successful fishing trip. If I was going to choose a place for trophy lake trout at this time, I would have to give the nod to Lakers Unlimited. I can only speak to the two times I've fishing both lodges. I caught more and bigger lake trout both times when I fished Lake Athabasca. With that said you probably will not find a better place in the world to catch trophy grayling and they also boast other pike fly out destinations for you to choose from at Kasba. If you are looking for a very nice lodge and resort owners though you cannot do better than Kasba Lake Lodge. All the staff were extremely professional and we even got coffee delivered to our room each morning. I cannot say enough nice things about the staff and our guide. Our guide was Jordan, who has guided there for many years, and you can see him holding a pike I caught that was wedged in a hole in our net. Below is Jordan holding the pike ready for a quick release. Here are some pictures of our trip to Kasba Lake Lodge. We did not catch any really big lake trout so as you will notice I didn't even bother with any lake trout pictures. Elk Island Lodge, God's Lake We stayed in Winnipeg for two days after our flight back from Kasba because we were going back up to God's Lake in Manitoba. My fishing buddy Keith really wanted to do a fly in to the God's River to catch some brook trout but the water levels were so high and the river was raging so we decided not to do that fly in and concentrate just on northern pike, walleyes, and a few lake trout. You can rent some rods and reels and tackle for a $100 but if I were you the quality of the stuff you could rent was not worth it and I'm glad we brought our own gear. Elk Island is a big camp that we flew into and landed on their own runway which was meticulously maintained. The cabin we stayed in was adequate but after a few drinks you wondered if you were losing your balance until you realized that the cabin listed six inches. My fishing buddy had to roll up a blanket and tuck it next to the wall to keep him from rolling into the wall during the night. My room was a bit more level and I did not have that problem. It was not that big of a deal just funny. The lodge was very nice and you ate well but we were there for two four day rotations so the food was a repeat. The food was good but not on the same level as Kasba, Lakers Unlimited, or Witch Bay Camp. The boats all leaked like a sieve, and after a couple of hours fishing the guides had to remove the plug from the boat while on plane and drain out the water. It really did not affect us that much but it was a good thing that the guides wore rubber boots. At their peak there can be as many as twenty-five boats guiding guests from this camp. The middle of August found the season winding down so there were only about twenty guests in the camp. Every day they did have some really yummy hors D'oeurves during the cocktail hour and they had a nice bar to order a before dinner drink. Most all the guides were first year guides and our guide was a young man who needed to learn some people skills. I guess our luck was due to change because we had experienced great guides at all the other guided camps. When we caught lake trout, he would grab the trout by the tail and wrestle it into the boat and after it thrashed around on the bottom of the boat, he would remove the hook and release it. He just had an attitude about him that I will not go into but I did reach my limit one day when he told me not to touch that walleye that I was unhooking. After that I made it a point to unhook all my fish the rest of our time with this guide. I tried to coach him that he needed to improve his people skills with his clients in the boat. After all we were paying for this trip. We requested a different guide on the second rotation and our guide James was really a nice young man who did his best to put us on fish. We fished for lake trout and caught trout but nothing bigger than probably around twelve pounds. We caught all of them jigging either a bondy bait or tube jigs. Unfortunately I did catch a few burbot and when pulling them up from the deep water they all died because their swim bladders expanded and they couldn't swim back down. I will say that James was a life saver and I am not just saying that because he was a new guide. My friend Keith who was my fishing partner spent time in Vietnam and while over there got a dose of too much agent orange. Consequently, he is battling several health issues and one of those is neuropathy of the feet and he has a problem with his balance and an Achilles tendon that he never repaired. He really is very unsteady on his feet and in the boat, we are always careful to help him in and out of the boat. Well towards the end of the trip I had picked up a virus and decided to stay in the cabin and sleep most of the day. I went down to meet the boat and help the guide get Keith out of the boat, but I did not time my trip down to the dock in time. I was met with a picture of James screaming Keith, and the picture of Keith falling backwards into the water next to the dock which was probably around fifteen feet deep. Did I mention that Keith can not swim and was not wearing a life preserver? James jumped into the water because Keith had fallen under the docks and fished him back so that he could hold onto the dock. Keith was struggling to hold on to the dock, but we got him calmed down and it took around fifteen minutes to move a bunch of boats and have him edge his way towards the dock landing and finally got him on dry ground. Keith now wears a life preserver. And Keith tipped James well and bought him a new I-phone because he had it in his pocket and fried the phone when he jumped in to save Keith. The walleye fishing was extremely good and one day we boated down to God's Narrows and I put on a clinic catching close to forty walleyes in less than two hours. It was a real subtle bite and you really had to finesse the walleye into biting. I would cast upstream and then very slowly try to match the current drift and bounce the jig and twister tail barely off the bottom and the bite was always vertical beneath the boat. The walleyes in the Narrows averaged over twenty inches and the largest I caught there was 25.5 inches. We went back to the Narrows another day and I caught close to fifty walleyes during the morning. We tried on the other side of Elk Island from the lodge on one of the streams emptying into God's Lake and in one morning Keith and I caught 50 walleyes, although the average size of these were closer to 16-18 inches. The first day I did catch one lone walleye that was a sixteenth of an inch short of Manitoba's Master Angler mark. I was glad to finally get home and can honestly say that seven weeks of fishing is too much for me in one summer. Now that I write this, I am ready to go again after having a month to recuperate. We still have two trips scheduled for 2023. Keith and I will be traveling to Alaska to fish trophy pike on a tributary of the Yukon River, the Innoko River the middle of June. In July we try our hand at trophy lake trout and northern pike on Tazin Lake for two weeks. I hope you enjoyed this recount of my summer of fishing. Although my fishing fun meter was pegged by the end of the summer, I amthankful for the experience despite spending some of my children's inheritance. I had a lot more pictures I could have posted but was only able to attach 5 photos, I hope you enjoy this report."
6688536,proguidedream,2022-09-27 10:39:00,345,your ole pal should travel with his own inflatable life jacket. would be more comfortable to wear. pretty ignorant to be in leaky wet boats with a guy with balance issues and cant swim without a life jacket on
6688548,Lazy Fisherman,2022-09-27 11:24:00,276,"Jim, I also made my first trip to Lac Des Mille Lac in the the late 60's. I probably made a total of 5 trips there. I then moved on to LOTW where I found the fishing better. Thanks for the great write up. Joe"
