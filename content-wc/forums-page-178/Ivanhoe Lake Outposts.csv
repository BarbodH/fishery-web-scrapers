5766585,pike50plus,2017-09-14 09:21:00,584,Which lake are you referring to?
5766593,Bobby Winds,2017-09-14 09:28:00,10817,There's few drive to lakes in the area that I've fished where I can say they average a larger sized walleye than Ivanhoe.
5290490,sahutch,2017-01-25 02:49:00,6,"Hi, I am thinking of taking a trip to one of the boat in outpost camps on the river section of Ivanhoe Lake. It would probably be during the time frame of late July-first of August. Any info from some past experience would be much appreciated.Thank you"
5290562,Bayou,2017-01-25 04:49:00,52,"Two buddies and myself went to the third outpost, the farthest one. It was our first trip I believe we ever took and a memorable one. We really didn't know what to expect or what we were doing, lol. Bugs were horrendous but we caught hammer handle after hammer handle. I think one or two walleye for the week was it. If I was doing it over again I would pick a outpost or somewhere else. They were great hosts but realize its a basic cabin at best and lots of small pike."
5290858,Bobby Winds,2017-01-25 07:42:00,10817,"The wife and I went in 2008 but we fly-in into Nemegosenda Lake and were wined and dined for 4 days. Fishing was above average but nothing super special. Great time anyways. We had flush toilets, showers with hot water and lights to 11 pm. You have a choice of housekeeping or American Plan at this FLY-IN Lodge....since I took the wife I wanted it to be a vacation for her too so we went with American Plan. George the owner does everything first class including the GORGEOUS lodge room we stayed overnight before flying out the next morning. The wife didn't want to leave this lodge room... The boats at Nemegosenda Lake had Lowrance graphs with GPS included. When we checked in the day of arrival we were giving a map of the lake with spots marked on it for walleye and pike........might of been bass too but I don't remember. The food at the fly-in lodge was GREAT and so was the service. Not a lake where you are going to catch hundreds if that is what you are looking for.http://nemegosenda.com/"
5292186,adempsey2.0,2017-01-25 16:17:00,612,"Only fished the ""river"" near the Lake. Nice true jumbo perch fishing in there. Lots of smaller pike and decent walleye in the lake. I recall seeing loads, of what I presume were whitefish, at 50-60FOW in the main lake, but never caught them. We went in August.I think those outposts are probably better for walleye fishing in the spring. Not really sure though. Are you looking at the camps from Ivanhoe Air or Red Pine Lodge?Might be worth checking out these as well:http://www.fivemilelake.com/chapleau-outpost-camps.htmhttp://www.happydaylodge.com/chapleauoutpostcamps.htmhttp://kanipahow.com/embarrass/http://kanipahow.com/northwind/http://kanipahow.com/south-wabus/Although, not outposts, there's a few train-in camps too if that interests you.http://www.wildernessisland.com/http://www.lochisland.com/http://www.tatnallcamp.com/http://www.woodscabins.com/http://www.cameronlakefishinglodges.com/index.htmlIf you're willing to fly, your options grow quite a bit."
5292218,sahutch,2017-01-25 16:43:00,6,"This is all great info, thanks and keep coming. I am looking at Ivanhoe Air, I believe the camp is called the Brooks. The kids are excited about trying to catch JUMBO perch."
5292234,Tayzak15,2017-01-25 16:46:00,48,I do a bit of guiding on the lake. I would stay out of the river unless you were going in the spring and early summer. You would be better off just staying at a cabin at the lodge on the lake. Fishing can be tricky at first but very rewarding. There is a ton! of baitfish in this lake and it produces very large walleye and pike. There's few drive to lakes in the area that I've fished where I can say they average a larger sized walleye than Ivanhoe.
5292394,adempsey2.0,2017-01-25 17:54:00,612,"The cottages at Red Pine Lodge on the beach are really nice. The downside is that Red Pine hosts a lot of trailers, so it can be crowded. The lakeside cottages are at the edge of the grounds though and somewhat isolated. It's a great beach too - although, I imagine it varies based on the water levels with the dam and all. They are also adjacent to the Ivanhoe Lake Provincial Park, but separated by water. You can walk to the park though I think. You can also go fish below the dam too, might be a fun experience for the kids.Keep in mind, I was there probably over 7 years ago though. You can get a good idea if you look at area using the Ontario Imagery (aerial photos) of the lake and lodge from here: http://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.on...M&locale=en-USIvanhoe Air cottages looked really nice too. Didn't see them close up, just from the boat."

5369522,gumbygold,2017-03-02 13:48:00,252,If you are paying to stay at a place in Canada I would not stay at their base camp and fish Ivanhoe lake. It's not that good and is public access. Nemogosenda or one of their fly-ins would be a much better bet.
