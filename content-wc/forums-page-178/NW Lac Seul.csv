5753225,fishingMN4eyes,2017-09-05 07:59:00,108,"Fished Tuesday thru Friday last week.Tuesday:Arrived at camp around 3pm, got unpacked, and put the boats in the water just in time to get a couple hours of fishing in. It was very windy, but we went to a reef close to camp that tops out at 4-5'. Fished crawlers on jigs and bottom bouncer with smile blade. Both boats in our group put a couple unders in the box that first night.Wednesday:Went to Steamboat to fish some of our usual spots there. Wind laid down a lot from the night before. Our boat found plenty of unders on jig/minnow and bouncers with crawlers as well. The other boat found a point we hadn't fished before and promptly got moved in on by I think three other boats. But they were able to find a couple 22s for their over fish in Steamboat where our boat never really got into that size range. Got bored a couple times with live bait and tried Jigging Raps and scared up a couple fish that way which was fun. Fishing was steady. Thursday:Made the run McKenzie. Wind had picked up quite a bit but not completely unmanageable. The size of the fish we caught in the McKenzie was incredible. The majority of the fish we caught were in the slot. It was a lot of fun! After shore lunch we went to rock pile about a football field away from a small island. We had fished it before and had success but we wanted try it again before we had to head back to camp for the day and it produced more big fish. I think the other boat caught a 27"" there and we found many more slot fish, two of our overs came of that spot, and a 23.5"" that went back. The fishing was so good that we fished much later than we normally do. Friday:Went back to McKenzie again. It was VERY windy. Fished primarily the same rock pile we ended on Thursday until lunch time but we had to fish it a little differently with the strong wind and it was coming from a little different direction. It produced fish and more big fish at that. After lunch we tried another spot we had saved from previous years and picked up a couple fish but decided to head back to Steamboat for the afternoon. The waves and wind really kicked our butts that days and we wanted to fish somewhere more protected from the wind. Picked up plenty of fish in Steamboat but definitely not the size we were seeing in McKenzie. Went to the reef by camp to finish our trip and got stopped by a CO who couldn't have been much nicer. I would say our most productive depth was 20-25' but we caught fish as shallow as 3' and as deep as 30' with a few mixed in the teens. I don't think there was a great difference between minnows or crawlers and it seemed like jigs and bottom bouncers both had their moments."
5761353,ToxicAngler,2017-09-10 20:37:00,30,"My buddy and I just returned from our trip. Fishing started off slow due to higher winds and a unsatisfactory anchor. After the wind laid down we started hitting our spots more productively. Ended the week with about 300 with most in the 14-17"" range and plenty in and above the slot. Jigs and minnows were the ticket. Found all sizes of fish in depths of 13'-34'. No doubt that if it was calmer Mon and Tues we would've put 400+ fish in the boat for the week. Also, there were 44 & 46"" pike caught in camp this past week. For some ludacris reason, the 44"" was filleted! I just don't get it. Good memories and good company! Was neighbors with a couple other Wisco boys and knocked a few Labatts back together. Great to have that kind of camaraderie!"
5762697,prov1800,2017-09-11 18:37:00,5010,Just finished up taking some great guys out staying at onaway lodge.weather was very nice but wind was brutal.fishing was pretty good but they are all over the depth scale.we mainly fished 10-20 ft and had good action.all sizes of fish.rocks and weeds both produced goog fish.i spotted lots of fish deeper in he kill zone but dont fish that deep.water temps this morning were at 57f.but arm weather forecast for a few more days.but caling for cooler weather next week.jigs and minnows seemed to work just fine.
5765609,crazybill,2017-09-13 13:19:00,6,Heading to Golden Eagle (Ear Falls) in two days. Anybody have tips for us? We usually just with love bait and jigging raps. First time on Lac Seul. ThanksSent from my Pixel XL using Tapatalk
5766377,Lake Wisconsin,2017-09-14 07:02:00,1960,"Fished out of golden going back about 3 years ago, same time of year. To be honest, the river was some of the best fishing of all the places we fished. Picked up #'s (100+ eyes per day) and size (29-3/4"") in the same general area."

5702818,ToxicAngler,2017-08-05 07:31:00,30,Heading to Ear falls area of the Lac the first week of September. Any reports?
5703458,KC Walleye,2017-08-05 19:01:00,274,I am heading to Onaway lodge in less than a week now. I will post a report or two hopefully. Where do you normally fish at? Staying where? How far do you like to travel each day?
5703474,mswope13,2017-08-05 19:34:00,73,"Our group returned 2 weeks ago from Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. Mainly fished the Steamboat area, but did venture to McKenzie Bay two days. Be careful as the lake was down and one of our group members destroyed a lower unit returning from McKenzie through Shanty Narrows. We definitely had to work for the fish this year. Don't get me wrong, we boated plenty of fish, more slot and overs than ever before. The numbers were definitely down a little, but 30-40 fish days per person aren't all too bad. Biggest walleye was 26"", Northern 35"" and managed to target a few smallmouths. Shore lunches, no electronics, no work....another great trip! Evergreen Lodge is nothing short of fantastic, can't wait till next year."
5703522,btyreprich,2017-08-05 20:28:00,1067,We just finished up our first day on Lac Seul out of Ear Falls - staying at Evergreen Lodge. I agree that the lake is down a good foot. Our first day we started fishing at like 1 pm. Went as far as Steamboat Narrows. Caught fish - but it was slow compared to past trips. No slot fish or over the slot fish but we did bring two back. Will update you as we fish over the next several days.
5704034,ToxicAngler,2017-08-06 09:15:00,30,"Thanks for the info fellas, Good to know water is down! Usually fish Bay of islands area but might venture to the Big Island or as far as needed to find active over-slot fish. Staying at Lac Seul Lodge again after such a great trip in 2015. My 2 boys and I had multiple 100+ fish days w/ handfuls of 24-27""ers. I'd like to target Lakers one day but unsure if the area we fish holds a good population, anyone got info??? Good luck btryeprich the rest of your week and KC walleye, best of luck to you and your group when you head up. Can't wait to hear more reports! Tight lines boys"
5704898,btyreprich,2017-08-06 18:00:00,1067,Lodge owners have told me in the past that there really aren't any population of lakers on LacSeul as the natives netted them out years ago. We still see the commercial fishing of whitefish on the lake down in McKenie By. Today was our first full day of fishing and while we did manage enough fish for shore lunch and brought home two for the freeer. I'd say today was on the slow side compared to past years. Live bait out performed twister tails and a Lindy rig was producing more that the Walleye spinners I tie at home. Weather was nice though and only the ride back in was a bit on the rough side.
5704962,prov1800,2017-08-06 18:36:00,5010,"My wife and i fished lac suel today out of scout bay and fishing was fantastic as it usually is.but did see boats movingvaround a lot looking for fish.lake is down a bit butvreallyvdont noticed it.not like going out in thecspring.caught lots of fishbtoday.mostly 20-23"".2 28"".got our 8 17"" .definatly need to use minnows.wadnt nust one spit either we caught them every where we stopped."
5705234,rather-be-fishin,2017-08-06 21:24:00,429,"We fished out of Onaway Lodge 7/21 to 7/28 and we had an AWESOME trip! The water is about 2-3 feet low from other years. We got up there Friday late afternoon and were on Scout Bay by 5:00pm. Fishing started out with a BANG in my boat. In less than 5 minutes we caught Walleye 23 1/2; 24; 25; 20; 22 and several good sized Saugers . That night they were biting on a chartreuse/white jig with red eye balls (Golden Nugget) and minnow. Only fished for a couple hours cause rain was moving in, but the first night did not disappoint. Saturday & Tuesday were challenging days of fishing due to the weather, rain, thunder, lightening storms and wind, so didn't venture too far out of Scout Bay and fishing was just OK. Then Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday the weather was sunny, calm to light winds, in the upper 70's to low 80's. We fished South of Manitoba Point, North of Manitoba point on a reef, another reef and islands on McKenzie bay and the BITE WAS ON! The other boat in our group caught 2 27s"" Walleye and many FAT 20-25"" Walleye. We also caught many 24-27.5"" Northerns, even though we don't target them. On Thursday the lake was like glass, so headed down to South Inlet water falls and worked our way up. Found an area and trolled the shoreline and caught Walleye 27"", 4 26s; several 23 -24""; a 32"" Northern that put up an awesome fight. Fish were in 18-25 ft. Then headed back out to a point off island in McKenzie bay and found a spot in 23 feet of water where we could just sit and jig the Walleye and caught 4 more 26"" and several more 22-24"". During the week, we had to work for our Walleye 16 1/2"" to 17 3/4"" freezer fish but did limit out. Most walleyes were too big. It was hard to have to leave the water on Thursday with such a good bite on, to go back to the resort to pack up to go home. For the first time in many years, we found that orange spinners (Tommy Harris Spider Spinners)worked the best most days of the week or orange jigs. Normally we use jigs 80% of the time. We used minnows 90% of the time and a few crawlers. Fish were in 20-25 FOW. The girth on the Walleye were BIG this year. OH and HAPPY to report that for the week, ONLY ONE boat from Wisconsin moved in on us on Sunday. Next year, we are looking forward to returning to the mighty Lac Seul for our 14th year of fishing! RBF"
5705274,ToxicAngler,2017-08-07 04:16:00,30,Good report!
5715426,ToxicAngler,2017-08-12 14:50:00,30,"So I'll be heading up in a couple weeks and not to my surprise, already losing sleep in anticipation. Lol. If someone could please periodically post reports from now until the end of the month my nerves would greatly appreciate it! Sounds as if the fishing has been getting more consistent from a few of the other threads I've been reading up on. Please help out a fellow junkie!"
