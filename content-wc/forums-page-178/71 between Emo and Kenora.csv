5752497,prov1800,2017-09-04 16:02:00,5010,Youll be driving through a huge bathroom narda.but you will be going through nester falls and sioux narrows.after that theres nothing till you get to vermilion bay.its a bit longer of a drive.
5752601,NARDA 1,2017-09-04 17:14:00,636,"Thanks. I've already checked the maps, was just wondering if there was some other stops that don't show on the maps."
5752641,pale ryder,2017-09-04 17:45:00,1937,There is a gas station just south of highway 17.
5752649,prov1800,2017-09-04 17:45:00,5010,There is a rest stop on hwy 17.about halfway from 71towards vermilion bay on dixie lake it has bathrooms.
5752841,Baseline,2017-09-04 20:06:00,3207,There are lots of resorts on the way up to 17. I guess if the need were dire enough you could always pull into one of the resorts. They have offices and restaurants.
5753033,The tank,2017-09-05 06:07:00,340,Other than what's been said 71 has a shoulder to pull over on if there's a emergency bathroom stop needed. I've taken 71 for the passed few years for the same reasons. Only 10-15 minutes longer drive and more places to get off the road. Have a great trip.
5753257,LOW1,2017-09-05 08:30:00,2828,"Also on 71 there are a few overlooks that have pit toilets. Also Rushing River Park and a few convenience stores, etc.Longest stretch without a restroom should be no more than 30 miles or so."
5769737,NARDA 1,2017-09-16 19:35:00,636,"Thanks for all the replies. We did take 71 both ways, it's a nicer drive with places to stop. We will be taking the 71 on future trips."
