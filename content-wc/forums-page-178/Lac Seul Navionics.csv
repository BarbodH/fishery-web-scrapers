5760609,Wall-i-Lama,2017-09-09 21:42:00,1524,What humminbird unit do you have?
5760649,h8go4s,2017-09-10 05:30:00,1673,I don't think it's a Bird setting. It's Navionics. Same way on Lowrance units. I have a 898 c SI and a Helix 10 G2N Mega SI.
5760657,Andre (wallyandre),2017-09-10 05:51:00,2274,With so many people fishing that lake and all of them looking for better map I don't understand why none are recording logs and upload those logs to Navionics so they will be getting excellent map
5760865,Wall-i-Lama,2017-09-10 09:25:00,1524,"Ok. I've been thru every setting(including custom) and can't find Fish n Chips, I have Navionics Platinum North.k"

5761041,Wall-i-Lama,2017-09-10 12:48:00,1524,Thanks much!
5761337,h8go4s,2017-09-10 20:29:00,1673,"1. I just got AutoChart with my new Bird this spring and haven't bothered to figure out how to upload to Navionics.2. I fish Lac Seul for one week every other year, so there's not much data I'd be collecting.3. I'm not particularly interested in sending the fruits of my labor to Navionics so they can sell it to their other customers.I'll share mapping info with the group that I fish with, and if someone asks for general fishing info I'm happy to oblige. Call me selfish if you want, but I didn't spend the money on my electronics for someone else's benefit."
5761609,bernmaster44,2017-09-11 06:56:00,256,Pardon me but that comment of yours ranks well above what I would consider simply selfish. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5767593,Aspencreek,2017-09-14 21:04:00,2911,"If that is selfish I guess I am too. After 21 weeks on LS over 16 years of exploring and searching and marking, ""my spots"" I to am NOT going to send them into some electronics company so they can sell them. Favorite, special, secret, spots were always kept secret in years past, now I'm supposed to share, so you don't have to do the work I've done. Yeh I'm selfish, your lazy!"
5767897,prov1800,2017-09-15 06:47:00,5010,Totally agree with you.ill admit iam selfish to.lol.i did guide one guy last Saturday who came up early.we used his boat and his huge tv screen.lol.was a bird.his chip showed same as my old 10 year chip.same stuff on it except he had contour lines on it.a lot of them.confusing to me.downscan/side scan.to much stuff for me to absorb.he mainly was looking forcsafe passages and during the course of the we caught a lot of fish off the normal grid.there still isnt anything better than your own fishing knowledge.
5755873,thehack,2017-09-06 21:05:00,78,I purchased the Navionics all of Canada and the US. I have the entire data set (6 Gb) on the SD card. The detail on Lac Seul looks pretty poor--would someone be so kind as to let me know what contour lines they have? If someone has a screen shot I would be grateful. I feel like I am missing something on the card.
5755905,Andre (wallyandre),2017-09-06 21:30:00,2274,Did you register you're card and download the latest update? Take a look on this link and once zoom in click on the blue button on the bottom left on the page: https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=e...key=iverH~kqsP
5755913,thehack,2017-09-06 21:33:00,78,"Arg, I purchased it last year and updated last night. I cannot figure out why there is no Lac Seul detail. I guess I'll call customer service."
5755929,Andre (wallyandre),2017-09-06 21:40:00,2274,Did you update it? Download the Nautical and sonarchart?
5755945,David Anderson,2017-09-06 21:48:00,2073,"If you are looking for ""accurate"" contour lines, you can forget it, but the Navionics card is pretty accurate on the land/water aspect. Also the white area's tend to be deep areas however that doesn't mean that you won't find a hump that comes up quite fast in the middle of a white area. I have found that the X's marked as hazards are usually correct yet not all hazards are marked and not all marked area's are hazards but for sure treat those X's with respect. I was surprised how many of the bad areas are marked, especially with this year's low water. Your best friend will be your trails that hopefully will be your safe passage and the map allows one to have an accurate reference to your specific location. I fish Lac Seul 3 to 4 times a year and would not be without my Navionics map for a safe trip into camp and dealing with the nuances of getting to my fishing spots"
5756081,bigwalleye1,2017-09-07 05:40:00,2632,"+1 on David Anderson. I too have the Navionics card. I get 10 ft contours, and that's it, and they're often not very accurate. The card is useful, though, for the marked hazards and the travel routes. Remember the card is calibrated to take into account the ""normal"" elevation of the lake, 1157 feet."
5756089,h8go4s,2017-09-07 05:46:00,1673,"Do you have the Fish n Chips option turned on? Here's a screenshot from the web app. That's Manitoba Point at the bottom. Yes, the contours are not to be trusted, but it's the only game in town for most of Ontario."
5756161,fishmanric,2017-09-07 06:49:00,219,We were on Lac Seul for the first time this year. We found that staying on the houseboat routes was the quickest way to get from point a to b. Once off the houseboat route we went slow all the way to our destination. Once those routes were marked we picked up the pace. Thought the chip did a decent job as all the humps and flats were pretty spot on.
5758153,thehack,2017-09-07 21:26:00,78,"Thanks guys. Went into the Bird's menu and found the ""Fish N Chips"" and enabled it. Worked great!"
5758281,h8go4s,2017-09-08 05:32:00,1673,"I don't know why they have that set as ""off"" for the default setting. It should be ""on."
