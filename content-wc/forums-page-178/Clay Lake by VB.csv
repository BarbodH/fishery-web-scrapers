5766449,walleye22,2017-09-14 07:59:00,59,back 1979 was my first to canada and i was 7. We stayed at north star lodge on clay lake. We went for like 3 years there until the mercury issue came to our attention and then we moved on. The fishing was ok from what i remember but the mercury issue should be a concern. Like other comments...if your a smoker then i gues some mercury in your body is not much of concern as the darts will kill you eventually anyway. congrats on that decision.
5766945,Poochie,2017-09-14 12:33:00,8,It was the ****est fishing trip I ever went on. My whole goal was find a place north of Dryden that is NO WHERE NEAR the Wabigoon Lake or River due to the pulp mill. The water was brown and the air stank near the mill. We drive NW 50 miles away having no idea Wab. river flows right into Clay Lake.
5767145,Ricky Spanish,2017-09-14 15:01:00,1298,"We took a camp boat from Temple Bay over to Clay Lake about 10yrs ago for an unauthorized day trip. Boy was Bob mad when he found out his guide took us there. The following year, it was an extra charge to hit Lac Seul, Clay, Gordon and others for a day trip. I recall some easy fishing, very nice sized walleyes, and none were kept. The most memorable part of the day was when our guide noticed a huge bird on the opposite bank. We slipped over as close as we could get and saw an enormous golden eagle on top of an #8 walleye. It tried to pick up the fish and fly away, but ended up leaving it there. Very cool to see such a large bird of prey up close. Come to think of it, maybe the bird ingested a little less mercury that day due to our intervention."
5767185,packpro,2017-09-14 15:24:00,695,"Our group of 12 has been fishing this body of water for 20 years. We eat 3-4 shore lunches per week while in camp. See pretty much the same group each year. So far, no cancers, no extra fingers/toes, no one glows in the dark. At one time Lake Erie was the dumping capital of the world, and if you look up OMC Marine Corporation-Waukegan, IL you find that they too dumped Mercury in the water, yet it is prime salmon fishing/eating water. Just stop the dumping and Mother Nature has a great way correcting herself. No reason to fear Clay and the fishing is fantastic. Walleye - numbers and size. Pike to 40"" Great small mouth. It is a big area, we do not find the water all that discolored. Have seen much worse, i.e. the Goon. Some places maybe, but clear in a many of the better fishing areas. Lots of fresh water inlets, rock structure, and plenty of bays/narrows to get you out of the wind. We have yet to lose a fishing day due to weather. Still afraid.......good. More for me and my crew. We go early June and have tried to move the date a few times. Camp is usually full. Not too many people running scared."
5767233,Skywagon,2017-09-14 16:38:00,1106,"Thank you for helping clean up the Wabigoon mercury problem for us. You guys are like a drug mules, hauling the mercury out of the country for us in your bodies. Please come back for more as long as you are able!"
5767465,v-bay gord,2017-09-14 19:30:00,3168,Maybe that's the Ontario governments solution to cleaning up the river system!
5767841,prov1800,2017-09-15 06:22:00,5010,Spent many years on clay lake guiding for north star lodge and big canon.always ate a few fish and a lot of canned spaghetti.always ate small walleyes and cut the belly meat of.iam sure there is some kind of poison in most lakes now a days with all the pollution we have.as far as fishing goes clay lake definately ranks up there.fishing was always great.i know a freind of mine still guides at both camps and says it even better now with more larger walleyes.maybe with the mercury scare mist people are releasing fish and giving them a chance to grow.better than having a slot system.
5767913,Pooch,2017-09-15 06:56:00,4618,"So if we want to improve fishing and stop people from harvesting large walleye then we start a ""rumor"" that Canadian fisheries are loaded with heavy metals and eating large fish is really, really bad for us? prov188, you are brilliant! I'm in.I fished Clay years ago and it is a nice lake, but the coffee and cream water color was a little perplexing to fish. Is it still like that?(Skywagon..... it's called Darwinism.)Pooch"
5768249,Skywagon,2017-09-15 11:09:00,1106,"That was exactly what I was thinking, but being the kind person that I am, refrained from saying that. What is sad, is that God knows Illinois needs all the tax payers they can get, hate to see them getting knocked off by mercury poisoning."
5768513,prov1800,2017-09-15 18:09:00,5010,Still is.nature of the lake.it starts from wabigoon lake.lots of clay banks there and it gets washed down wabigoon into clay lake.it clears a bit way down stream.segise bay has clear water.definately a great fishing lake.goodcsized pike and some monster myskie showing up.
1509641,KTroller,2012-12-03 13:19:00,237,"Looking for any insights on Clay Lake by Vermilion Bay, ON. Anyone have walleye experience on this lake and how it compares to others in the area like Lac Seul, Eagle, Wabaskang?Thanks,KT"
1509659,wallydave,2012-12-03 14:08:00,2151,"https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ight=clay+lakeHeres some findings from the search function on the tool bar. Some good some well... not so good. Each year, each week for that matter can be different, not to mention each groups opinions on what good fishing is! The only way to know for sure is to make the trip, fish hard and let us know when you get back!Good luck!"
1509672,EyeMagic,2012-12-03 14:43:00,10,Have Fished Clay approximately 6 times in last 12 years. Water levels fluctuate from year to year as well as color of water on main lake and bays. Over all very good lake to fish for quality and quantity. I have been on all the other lakes mentioned and favor this lake due to Northstar Lodge being only camp on 28 miles of water.
1510140,2746,2012-12-04 15:36:00,3206,IMHO your almost always better off fishing bigger water. It may sound intimidating but actually is not and the possibilities are much greater. If it were me I'd give V Gord a call at vermillion bay lodge on Eagle. Price is right and the fishing excellent. If Eagle isn't your cup of tea just a few miles up the road is Lac Seul with any number of lodges.
1511761,packpro,2012-12-09 21:25:00,695,"I have fished the Northernwestern and Central sections of that body of water.(Clay Lake/Wabigoon River). We were staying at Big Canon (boat caches at the other end of the lake/river). No doubt there is a lot of water available, but I have found the camp owners( brothers) and the camp support team(s) to be incredibly helpful to put us on fish. We never left the dock without 10-15 spots to explore. No sure things, but lots of places to try. Finding the right spots, and putting together a pattern by the end of the week was half the fun. Sometimes all the spots would be good with a few great ones. Other times it was hit and miss, but we never had a bad day on the water. The exploration was half the fun. There were plenty of numbers spots, and other spots had better size.We had a large group so we really appreciated the variety of species. There were great pike spots and great smallie spots. Not a bad portage (1/4 mile) to some really really good fishing. There are some very scenic shore lunch spots. We could always find spots that were out of the wind/weather if necessary. This year we will be staying at the other end of the water and fishing Clay. We know the central part of the water so we will have spots to revisit, but we are really looking forward to working a new area. Having spoken to the camp owner for a number of years I know we are going to have a good trip. The fact that it is a drive to location and the only commerical operation is also attractive. You may have to compete for a spot but, there are enough of them that you can come back later in the day. Hope you have a great trip, and if you end up on Clay drop me a PM."
1521044,GeoFish,2013-01-08 10:43:00,70,"We have stayed at Big Canon Lake Lodge numerous times when Bill Frederick and Steve Guse owned the camp.We also visited once when the camp was run by Sam Guse. They are great people, the camp is very well run and they are extremely helpful.We mostly fish for Walleye and have fished the Wabigoon River downstream from Clay Lake many times.We have done well there. The biggest Walleye was 7 ½ Lbs. Since we mostly Walleye fish we quit going after we heard about the mercury spill.Between 1962 and 1970, the Dryden Paper mill dumped 20,000 pounds of mercury into the Wabigoon River. The Wabigoon river flows into Clay Lake. That is why there is only one lodge on Clay.Then out the west side of Clay the Wabigoon flows past Big Canon Lake.Have a good time, but I won't eat any fish caught from the Wabigoon River or Clay Lake."
1521084,EyeMagic,2013-01-08 12:14:00,10,"So without getting this into a horrible debate, how many or how often does one have to consume fish from this lake to have it have a negative impact on your health compared to any other lake in the region? I understood that you would have to of consumed many fish a day for a long period of time to realize or absorb any of that into our own bloodstreams...Anybody feel like chiming in on this? Drinking and smoking isn't helping my cause, what's a little mercury gonna do?"
1521090,Skywagon,2013-01-08 12:47:00,1106,"EyeMagic,Because of the Wabigoon Mercury issue, many of the locals won't fish the river or Clay. I have fished Clay once through the ice, but have not been back, the mercury concern has a baring on that decision. In your case, I would not worry about it, the smoking may get you first anyway."
1521091,GeoFish,2013-01-08 12:51:00,70,"No one really knows but this link will take you to the Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish.http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@ene/@resources/documents/resource/std01_079301.pdfPer the guide, do not eat any Walleye over 16 from Clay Lake and only two meals of fish per MONTH under 16.Women of child-bearing age and children under 15 should not eat any Walleye from Clay Lake! Studies undertaken in the 1960s in the English-Wabigoon River system in northwestern Ontario  found disturbingly high levels of mercury in fish. Commercialfisheries in these areas were immediately closed.With so many good places to go, why take the risk?"
5765817,Poochie,2017-09-13 15:44:00,8,"I fished Clay Lake in 1980 and was so concerned about the river coming into the lake...coming all the way from Dryden The water was murky but we did catch a few. We left after the owner scolded me for suggesting it can't be good to have that **** river flow right into the lake. It smelled even. Anyway, part 2 of that nightmare trip...we headed to Cliff Lake maybe 50 miles north or so and got totally skunked. Lady told me at outdoor show in MKE that Cliff Lake had a chemical spill. Ring a bell to any old timers?"
