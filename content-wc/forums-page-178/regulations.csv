5762921,Guest,2017-09-11 20:39:00,0,"Truly an interesting take on the Ontario fishing regulations. I've read them over and over and cannot find this information you speak of. Usually, but not always, my walleyes are zipped and then cut into 8 pieces, although sometimes less, and the pike sometimes up to 10 or 12 pieces, especially when making fish soup. And the bass. and all the other species. Goodness. And how about if the fish are legally purchased or were gifted to me. I haven't read that I need a receipt to prove that. I can hardly imagine the way some people behave taking untold limits of raw fish home. It disgusts me and I hope they get caught. But this rules interpretation of yours just makes no sense to me. I suppose I could bring the local MNR guys some cooked fish and see what they have to say. Pretty certain that would clear this up for me. Unless of course you can point me to the language in the regs. It just seems that the language would be perfectly clear and legally enforceable to minimize court challenges. As you've implied, the Warden will decide whether a citation is in order. I'll bet the warden won't be wanting to waste the courts time or Ministries money on something that is not black and white and enforceable. By the way. Properly cooked, I prefer cold fish."
5763073,Obabikon,2017-09-12 06:11:00,2370,"This is not my ""rules interpretation"". Because we smoke northern pike for our guests, and wrap them in tinfoil to send home... I asked this SPECIFIC QUESTION of an officer. The above is how it was explained to me, and it seemed very simple.In most cases, an MNR officer can ID a fish... even if it is cooked. I certainly can. With soup (which I did not ask about) I would GUESS that he/she asks how many fish you used. Then examines it, and determines if they believe you or not. They don't have to prove guilt to issue a ticket. I went ahead and sent an email to my contact at the MNR asking for clarification on this. I will share it when I get a response."
5763689,Obabikon,2017-09-12 10:26:00,2370,"From the MNR.... ""Thank you for your inquiry. You may transport cooked fish taken under your fishing licence and in accordance to the Ontario Fishery Regulations. These fish do count toward your possession limit as they are still in your possession, regardless of the state they are in. We hope you have found this information helpful.

5765113,bus33,2017-09-13 07:55:00,289,What about leaving a bit of skin on transported fish? I suppose there are a million what if's.
5765209,Limeyangler,2017-09-13 08:34:00,563,"When you cross the border, put the cooked fillets in condoms and hide them in your......never mind...LOLOLOL"
5765401,Obabikon,2017-09-13 10:42:00,2370,"There's a million what if's. The truth is... it comes down to what the officer believes to be true. My personal suggestion would be: if cooked fish creates a ""full"" limit for you (like there isn't any wiggle room) don't transport it. If your fish is chunked or in soup and would be impossible to count fillets... don't transport it.The FACT is (not at all opinion)... unconsumed fresh fish count against your limit in either state (raw or cooked). If you can't count it, that is a problem, and could result in a fine. We can argue if, and or but all we want, but the fact is... officer can write a ticket. If you want to argue it, you have that right. But, the burden of proof lies on YOU in fish and wildlife."

5750329,wildernessuke,2017-09-02 13:13:00,7,is it legal to transport cooked fish leftover from day before or do they go against your legal take home limit of 4? did not want to waste by throwing away. 0
5750393,CI_Guy,2017-09-02 14:33:00,2118,"According to hand outs I've received from 2 different resorts any fish filet that is fresh, frozen or cooked that was not consumed on the previous day counts against your possession limit."
5760033,Obabikon,2017-09-09 09:17:00,2370,They count. We (on occasion) smoke northern pike for guests. They 100% count against that limit.
5760057,wildernessuke,2017-09-09 10:04:00,7,thanks
5760233,Bill Krejca,2017-09-09 14:38:00,6107,The warden gets to decide what constitutes one fish. Bill
5760801,3M TA3,2017-09-10 08:49:00,2846,". So how do they determine what species the fish is if it's cut up, breaded, and cooked. How would they determine how many pieces equal 1 fish? Just curious here. Help me out understanding this rule on cooked fish. I'll check the regs again, but this seems 'fishy'."
5760969,Pooch,2017-09-10 10:42:00,4618,"Our groups always consume all the fish by days end. Even one piece cut up and cooked would probably considered ""a fish"". So in order to not have to deal with that if there is any fish left over from lunch it goes into a sandwich for the evening or in the boat for a snack with whomever didn't eat what they brought in for lunch. Then start the count fresh each morning.Seems that every trip one guy just has to bring in more or larger than he can eat. Make it that persons responsibility to consume what he brought in and not put the group as a whole in a bad spot.Basically, just don't have fish left over and in the fridge. MNR guys can and do come into your cabin and look. Pooch"
5761529,bigwalleye1,2017-09-11 05:58:00,2632,"What is this ""leftover fish"" thing of which you speak??? If you have fish left over, you've cooked too many potatoes. SAVE THE POTATOES!!!!"

5762409,Obabikon,2017-09-11 15:32:00,2370,"The warden will examine it and then decide if he believes your story or not. If you were allowed to take cooked fish home without a limit, could you imagine the way some people would behave with it? 2 pieces = 1 fish... however, if you have an odd number, 1 piece = 1 fish. The easiest way to understand it, is if you caught it and cleaned it... it counts. Period, end of story until you have consumed it."
