It continuously records in loops until you hit the button to ""lock in"" the past 5, 15, or 20 minutes to memory. It's a great way to get an entire fish battle on film without filling up hours on a memory card. Makes editing WAY easier. Also, I use a battery eliminator on the gopro which allows me to use an auxiliary battery pack that lasts for 12 hours. I use a standard movie editing software package on my PC if I have a lot of footage to put together. If it's just a few short clips and pics from the phone, I'll use an app right on the phone and upload directly to YouTube."
5758473,Remi,2017-09-08 07:40:00,41,"Cell Phones: We use Cell phones to capture all pictures, and also the Video is much better quality (in my view). In fact, since our trips often have no electric, we bring old cell phones just to record the memories. I'm very happy with cell phone video and pictures, but often miss some action to pull it out and start recording. In addition, need I'm using 1 hand to hold the phone. Action Camera: EK7000, it was cheap and I wanted to try. Pro: 2 batteries and some attachments. Video quality seems good. Con: It feels cheap in your hands, get about 45 minutes per battery. I still need to review and make a YouTube from our summer trip's, which was the first time I used an action camera. Drone: Don't have one yet, they look fun, just not sure I'm ready for that yet. And how to pick one.... Computer: Just a cheap mid-range laptop. Software: Windows Movie Maker (free and does good on simple stuff) - I'm still learning. Final Output: Save to my laptop, watch the end to end, then Upload to YouTube."

I also take stills from video. I have an iMac desktop with 24GB RAM and an older i7 chip but its still chomps through 4k footage pretty darned fast. I use iMovie software for editing. just a tip for those thinking of getting a drone, when editing drone footage make sure you de clutter your ssd or hard drive frequently as most editing software makes a copy of the file or something like that and this can take up a lot of space. My iMovie software could not convert the files from .MOV to mp4 for a while until I realized I did not have enough space on my physical memory, I have a lot of $%$# on it....lol."
