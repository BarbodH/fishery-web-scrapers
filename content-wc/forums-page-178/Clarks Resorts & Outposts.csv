5556346,kona77,2017-05-19 19:38:00,236,"Reddemon;You can go on their web page and see fishing reports on their outpost lakes from the last two years.. They have a lot of great fishing lakes. As I mentioned in my earlier post we have fished 3 of their lakes so far (Grace, Antenna and Bertrand) and they all had great fishing. Cabins, boats and motors are always in great shape and I can tell you from first hand experience how important that is on a fly in outpost. Free minnows are a nice bonus !!"
5556370,reddemon,2017-05-19 19:40:00,39,"Yep, Been on their site, just was looking for some thoughts from others on here, Thanks"
5559489,prov1800,2017-05-21 16:33:00,5010,all awesome.
5579633,wallypod,2017-05-30 17:57:00,21,"Reddemon,I've been to a number of Wayne's lakes some before he and Karla owned them and after, and another they have owned for quite while. You will be hard pressed to find a better operator. (I've also tries some outfitters in Sioux Lookout area before giving Clark's a try)Clark's own some of the best fly-in lakes, have great cabins, boats and motors, a nice fleet of planes and a great team of people concerned about you having a great experience. I am sure there are a lot of good operators but I have not seen any better than Clark's."
5597433,Eagle1,2017-06-08 12:20:00,28,"Been going to Clark's outposts for many years, primarily to Kapikik Lake and McVicar Lake. Absolutely fantastic fishing, and they run a top-notch operation. Great cabins, good equipment, and free minnows. Highly recommend them!"
5651610,leachmin&worm,2017-07-07 13:34:00,32,"My son and I fished Snelgrove lake outpost for 7 days. June 11-18. Accommodations were great, weather was great(62-80) mostly 65-72, lake hadn't been fished in 5 years, fishing was off the charts! Walleye color based on water stain was beautiful. We tied for largest Walleye on that lake at 24"". We had a blast. We're going back, but I want to bring more of my family. First two hours of the trip we fished from the dock, jigging from a couple of chairs telling jokes and catching a frenzy. Next time we'll spend more time fishing the whole lake!Clarks was very good and the minnows were fantastic.My son and I highly recommend the Clarks.We also fished at Clarks camp for three days(June 18-21) after our trip and my son landed a 28"" Walleye of the dock! We got our limits at Indian Chain Lakes and returned to home from there."
5763665,Bigfish10702,2017-09-12 10:19:00,60,"This will be my 12th year at Clarks (KC Landing) on the Indian Lake Chain. They run a good clean camp, equipment is good, and service is great. There are plenty of fish to catch, and all in all it is a hoot! I leave Friday for my 12th trip there - can't wait!!!! Good Times! I would love to try one of their fly-in lakes one of these days as they sound awesome!"
5553874,reddemon,2017-05-18 17:57:00,39,Your experience?
5554346,1/4 oz Jig,2017-05-18 21:47:00,90,"I would Highly recommend. Stayed at Northern Lights on Cedar Lake 2 years ago. Include free minnows, nice boats, cabins and Wayne and Karla are great. Cedar is a little to crowded for my liking. I am planning on doing a fly in one of these years and they will be at the top of my list."
5554402,IAWally,2017-05-19 00:55:00,38,This year will be our groups 8 trip to KC's landing. Very nice acamp nd great people. Free bait is a plus.
5554586,kona77,2017-05-19 05:33:00,236,We have fished three different outpost lakes with them and have always had a good time. They keep their facilities and equipment updated and wehave had great fishing. Would recommend Wayne/Karla and their whole team to anyone..
5554810,leachmin&worm,2017-05-19 07:23:00,32,My son and I are going for a fly-in for seven days at Clarks. Then we will Fish at Clarks camp for three days starting June 10. Clarks has been recommended by a friend.
5554858,rockape,2017-05-19 07:36:00,215,"We stayed at Clark's on Cedar last year. Incredibly well run camp. The workers there were top notch too. Great boats, free minnows, etc. are awesome. The only negative is you are at the left bottom of the Cedar horseshoe, so if you want to fish on the east end of the lake, it is a long boat ride. Plenty of spots close too. We are going back to Sioux Lookout this year. We like to move around, and revisit the great camps from time to time. Keeps your skills up finding new spots. 27 inch walleye and a 54 inch musky has me satisfied that Cedar is a great lake, and I will be back."
5554874,Capt Morgan,2017-05-19 07:40:00,77,"I have been going to Clark's since 1994. First at the Indian chain and then at Cedar, depending on the year, 1 to 3 weeks. Have also been to LOTW 5 times and to Canyon once and to Crow once. You can not find nicer owner's than Karla and Wayne. Free bait is nice but you don't need it, free ice I always use."
5555426,walleye22,2017-05-19 10:58:00,59,clark is an awesome person. lakes a bit crowded for me but just my thoughts. now his fly ins are amazing. i did the fly in lakes when they were under doug gawley long ago and let me tell you...they are just amazing. clark runs them now and they will never disappoint.
5556026,pale ryder,2017-05-19 17:20:00,1937,"I've been fishing out of Clark's camps for 20+ years. On the Indian chain and Cedar.They are exactly what I want in a fishing camp. Reasonably priced, everything is clean and in very good condition, the lakes are big enough that I don't have to fish the same spot twice, but small enough that wind isn't a problem. The fishing is very good but not so easy as to take away all the challenge. And both lakes/chains offer a variety of fishing option. I have caught walleyes trolling, casting, jigging, rigging, and slip bobbering in less than 5' to about 25', weeds, wood, rocks, sand flats, all in the same day. And SMB, musky, and crappies.I would bet that the fly in lakes all have exceptional fishing, but I like a little challenge and I like fishing out of my own boat."
5556258,reddemon,2017-05-19 19:04:00,39,More interested in the fly ins
