He's a great guy and has visited a ton of these camps over the years. He will definitely help you out. If you haven't already, I also highly recommend reading his trip reports. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/re...-trips/page/2/Remember, when you go is just as important as where. For example, if you go in May/June to a lake with some nice inflows, you will likely catch fish until your arms fall off. However, it's always hard to know exactly WHEN is the best time. I was up in Kagianagami in early July a few years ago and the Walleye were still just moving into the main lake. We fished the in-flowing water and the fishing was incredible."
5759249,potsie225,2017-09-08 16:03:00,41,"I did this trip to Lac Hebert in July 2017. 10 guys in 2 cabins, we caught 1700 walleyes and 20 + pike. Several days we caught over 300 eyes, had 5 fish frys and everyone brought home there limits. Great outfitter, we are going back next year, you can rent a Honda 2000w generator for $50 and does not count in your weight. This work to power 2 cpaps and charged batteries and cell phones. Contact octanehi5 he has been there 15 times. All rates are cdn dollars, we had a 1.33 exchange rate, total cost was about $1300 us."
5748561,NickDalasio,2017-09-01 05:14:00,34,"I'm interested in any recommendations on a remote outpost fly-in, either in Quebec or the more eastern end of Ontario (I'm near Philadelphia, so 2 days driving is about my max). Furthest west or north I'd drive is Nakina. I do have a good lodge I go to to near Nakina, but would like to try the outpost thing once in my life. Thanks for looking!"
5748585,fishron,2017-09-01 05:49:00,317,"Take a look at ""Pourvoirie Moselle-Natakim"" I wanted to book a trip on one of there fly-in lakes called Sand or (Cormon). I had a shot at an early July, 5 day trip but could not get a commitment from my fishing group. On there face book link there are some very impressive walleye and pike photos, caught this season. You would have the lake pretty much to yourself. The fact that you can't get any other time says much about repeat customers on a good lake. It may no longer be available and they do have many other lakes but Sand is the only one I would consider. I also live in the Philadelphia suburbs and figured it to be about a twelve hour ride on hard roads. Air Tamarac, a good fly-in service gets you in there as well as lakes further north. Good luck Ron"
5748641,MrSimon,2017-09-01 06:33:00,922,"Air Tamarac is in Quebec and has a good reputation. It's still a long drive for you, but not nearly as far as Nakina. I'm from outside Philly too, so I feel your pain. We've been looking for good places within a 15 hour drive for years. There are tons of places to fish ... and good ones ... but if you really want that remote fly-in experience with superb fishing, you need to saddle up and drive. You can make Hearst in about 20 hours and Nakina in about 23. The extra hours to get to those two places are totally worth it. The fishing really is that much better."
5748761,NickDalasio,2017-09-01 07:33:00,34,"Thank you Mr. Simon. I DID get a good reference on Air Melancon, but it looks as if they were bought by Air Tamarac, which looks to have a good reputation also. Do you have any specific lakes or air-services in Hearst or Nakina you can recommend? PM is fine if you don't want to put it out there on the WWW.Thanks again!"
5748881,MrSimon,2017-09-01 09:03:00,922,"Hearst Air!!!!!!!!!!! Great operation with excellent lakes. Their outposts are pretty rustic, but well stocked and comfy. They have a good assortment of lakes to choose from. Small lakes all the way up to huge river systems. Prices are reasonable. I'm sure there are others, but we had a top notch experience with them."
5748969,vteye2,2017-09-01 09:51:00,123,Hey Nick - we drive nonstop from VT 19 hours to Nakina.Hearst is about 2.5 hours less. We did the Quebec outfittersabout half dozen times. I will gladly drive a few extra hoursfor my week...
5749009,spoonchucker,2017-09-01 10:15:00,82,With all the gas and wear on vehicle and if you over nite at all did you ever just consider flying from Philly to Winnipeg and getting to fish the outstanding lakes of Manitoba or nw Ontario? Some outposts fly right from Winnipeg and some offer shuttle. Philly to to Winnipeg round trip is less than 400$. If you have a group of ten you can apply for group desk discount ( make a bid) and the outfitter usually has discount too. I gave up on Quebec years ago after some bad experiences.
5749225,adempsey2.0,2017-09-01 14:33:00,612,"Many great suggestions already and you have plenty of options.As mentioned, flying to Winnipeg or even Thunder Bay opens up even more opportunities. Depends on your budget, time and tolerance of airports.I think it's always best to start with gathering some information:a) your budget;b) your fishing expectations - target fish and trophy vs. numbers; andc) what amenities you require - e.g., rustic or modern? do you have a CPAP? are there 4+ people in your group? is electricity a must? WiFi? lake size?"
5750337,NickDalasio,2017-09-02 13:21:00,34,"Thanks for the idea, I have given this some thought, what's stopped me so far is the restrictions on how much gear and food I'd be able to bring on a commercial flight."
5750353,NickDalasio,2017-09-02 13:44:00,34,"Let me preface this by saying the last 2 trips I've made to Canada were to Brace/Meta/Ara out of Nakina, and I'm QUITE pleased with everything involved, but this is as far as I plan to drive. I'm trolling around for suggestions on a remote outpost camp, mostly as a ""bucket list"" item, want to experience this at least once in my lifetime.A- Budget- I don't think this is an issue, most remote outpost fly-ins I've looked at so far are under 1,500 CAD, which is doable for me.B- Expectation- want to catch fish until my arms hurt, LOL. Seriously- would like solid walleye fishing, and some pike mixed in. Hopefully a smaller lake, so we don't have to spend the first 5 days figuring out where to find the fish. Trophies not really important.C. Would be 2 guys, possibly 4,alll hard-core anglers, so entertainment and WIFI not necessary. Sleep in, read, drink beer, or play cards if it's raining hard. I do have a CPAP, but I wouldn't bring it anyway. Showers would be a plus, but from what I see, that's not always an option (and wouldn't be a deal breaker). I don't think this is too limiting of a criteria. I have looked at quite a few websites, but obviously, I'd like to get some recommendations so that I can sift through the hype a little.Thanks again to all who replied!"
