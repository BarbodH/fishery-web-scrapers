568506,Stu,2007-08-19 00:34:00,472,"Hey Bigboy, Let us know what you thought of the camp. Wawang was rated one of the top 5 walleye lakes and one of the top 5 northern lakes for 2006 on the Outdoor Canada website. Lot of negative posts on this site, that makes me nervous. Good luck on your trip - Stu"
1226762,Guest,2010-08-10 21:34:00,0,"My wife and I are presently staying at Wawang. The first morning here we caught about 15 Northern. Most were 24-28"". One was 32, one was 30, three were 28, a few were small. Lots of action. In mid afternoon I got a 26 1/2 in walleye. The next day things were not as good. It''s hot and the fish are deep. We switched to strictly walleye and fished the area the guide told us. We caught 9 eyes. 7 were 13"" and 2 keepers were 17. today Tue 8/10 we went to their remote lake with the guide and caught about 20 walleyes. 12 of them were 16""+ - and keepers for supper. Don't be afraid to try this lake. It is our 3rd time here over the years. I don't consider us expert fishermen. We have had good and bad weeks. Do what the guide and owners suggest. Your tactics from ""home"" lakes may not always be the best. Some of my tactics from madison, wi lakes don't fit well here. Change with the conditions and you can find the fish. Avoid mayfly hatch time if you can. August fishing is tough in lots of places. This year has been a warm one everwhere and fishing is a bit off. We did well however, so far."
3973602,Guest,2015-06-17 04:49:00,0,This Camp is terrible. The food was way below standard. The fishing was good for those who had been fishing the lake for years. They really didn't offer much that I felt was worth their fee. The owners don't seem to care about repeat customers. I would strongly suggest avoiding this camp.
5376586,npike21,2017-03-05 23:03:00,1,"Hi, Most of the posts on a Wang Resort are older. Has anyone fished there in 2016 ? What success did you have ? Is this lodge under new ownership in the last few years ? I read where the service was not ggos several years ago and wondered if it has been sold. Please tell me about the fishing for walleye and northern pike. Plus, any information you can give is appreciated. I have never been there. Thanks. npike21"
5765961,astefanski,2017-09-13 18:18:00,2,"Fished Wawang Aug 2017. Crowded small lake. (5000 acres). Last 30 miles take about 2 hours due to road condition. No serious guide information. Young granddaughter serves as guide. Doesn't know much. Lights were out in cabin all week and were never repaired. We fish hard for pike and did OK. Our third trip there. Has gotten worse every year. Food also on decline. Largest pike 40"". 20 between 30-38 1/2. Looking for a better camp for next trip."
559860,Mohleye,2006-07-31 09:36:00,368,"Stu, Send me an email at [email protected] Not a big secret but the owner has some health issues and things are a bit in limbo right now."

559908,Mohleye,2006-08-01 16:30:00,368,"Stu, If you emailed me, I didn't get it either."
559922,LeeHawk,2006-08-01 20:24:00,12,As to fishing Wawang...don't.
559972,Mohleye,2006-08-03 08:18:00,368,"Got it, and sent you a reply yesterday."
560078,Guest,2006-08-07 19:28:00,0,"Yes, and even though the fishing may be good, the service and the the amount of proffesionlism is horrible. Make sure you get everything in writing. I have heard of others that have went to this resort and will no longer be returning. Very competitive prices but watch out for the hidden costs."
560079,Guest,2006-08-07 19:33:00,0,Soory I must add that if your wanting to catch those big pike than great but as for walleye than not to good of a catch. All this from experiences there
560113,bigboy,2006-08-08 17:58:00,13,"cargo1 bigboy here I am going up Auagust 19th and just wondering what kind of hidden charges I should be aware of and you said the fishing was pretty good, what did you catch."
562785,roscoe33,2007-01-15 02:01:00,653,"Been to Wawang 7 times, 13 other relatives have been there several times each, and my parents stay there for 4+ weeks every summer. Wawang is not a luxury resort, and service is NOT top notch. You get what you pay for, and the rates are very afforable. The owners are nice, but they do things on their schedule and seem a bit understaffed at times. It is more of a fish camp than a full service resort. Some of the cabins are very nice, a couple of the older ones are a bit rough. But they are warm and dry, and have decent kitchens and bathrooms. Walleye fishing is usually great until about the 20th of June, then the walleye make their transition from the shallows to the main body of the lake. They can be hard to find for most of July, but you should catch some everyday. The walleyes pick up again after August 20th. You often catch northerns while fishing for walleyes in the spring. Mid July through mid September has always been good for northerns, concentrate on the weedbeds in the day, and move toward shore in the evening. Mid summer walleye fishing was tougher than usual on many of the lakes in 2006. Don't expect amenities. The boats are basic fishing boats. Bring your own leeches and crawlers. Expect to pay the going rate for minnows. ($4-5 a dozen) Although the food is good, I would recommend you not get the meal package (American plan). Just rent the cabin and boat. I prefer to cook and eat my own food, on my own schedule. This allows me to fish on my own schedule. Bring what you need. Fish available: primarily walleye and northern, but you can catch whitefish, and with a little effort you can get some nice perch. No musky, bass or trout here. Our group has caught a dozen or so 42"" northern, and many in the 35-39"" range. Many many in the 22-26"" range that make for good eating Largest walleye was 31.5"", many in the 22-26"" range. Most are in the 16-20"" range. If you bring your own boat, take a day or two to fish ""the northern lake"", or South Alley Lake, or put in at the north launch on Pakashkan Lake. And DO NOT leave your boat in the water over night. Bear hunting is great, and their rates are cheap, and include a boat, so you can fish for a few days after you get your bear. My brother in law is 3 for 3 bow hunting out of Wawang, and is booked again for 2007. And if you happen to be there May 27th-June 1st, 2007, ask to talk to Rod or Harvey."
559750,bigboy,2006-07-25 17:31:00,13,I am going to WAWANG LAKE fishing in late august and wanted some info on the lake I have heard alot of mixed opinions about the lake and just wanted some info from someone that has actually been there.
559764,Stu,2006-07-26 19:14:00,472,I am going up there next spring. Let me know how you did.
559785,Guest,2006-07-27 15:39:00,0,"Good luck. Our group fished 4 days July 8 - 11, 2006. Our group consisted of 3 dads (combined Canada trips - 110,yes 110) and 4 teenagers (combined Canada trips - 14), so lots of experience fishing Canadian walleyes. Our group caught 9 walleyes, total. I caught ONE. (It was the 1st spot I stopped to jig and was a 25 incher. I'm thinking, hey, my 4th biggest walleye to date and 15 minutes into the trip, this is going to be nice.) 3 1/2 more days of fishing resulted in 0 (ZERO) walleyes for me. Yep, ZERO. You readers are probably forming opinions at this point, such as this group didn't know what they were doing. I've got some more ammo...The cabin next to us caught zero walleye in 3 days of fishing. The cabin 2 down hired the camp guide for all 7 days. They were heading out to fish on day 4 and had yet to boat a walleye. Yep, camp guide boat did not catch a walleye the 1st 3 days. (They did fish northerns the 1st day, so shouldn't count that day). I picked thru gut buckets in the fish house each day and other then the couple we cleaned, NO walleye. I asked the guy who hired the guy what her explanation was and she replied, ""just not biting."" There were weather changes. 1st day, very windy (storm came thru that evening), 2nd day, wind and rain, 3rd day, calm and sunny, 4th day, breezy and sunny. The positives...they have a great website. Lots of good quality fish caught. It's hard to believe for our group, though. Good boats and motors, our cabin was nice, (we've stayed in some #### holes on fly ins, so may be relative.) The guy who went american plan said the food was good. The people next to us were repeat customers. They were up 2 weeks earlier in '05 and said they caught a ton of nice northerns and enough walleye to be satisfied. The fact they came up again must mean something. The lake is beautiful, lots of nice structure (very abrupt, steep drops) very clear, great sunsets. I thought the price was right. The kids caught enough northerns to keep them going out. I'm hoping we just hit a bad walleye week. If anyone else had/has a good week, please post. I would be interested."
559786,Stu,2006-07-27 15:46:00,472,I have heard that the fishing is tough later in the summer. Spring or late summer is supposed to be the best time to go.
559787,Guest,2006-07-27 15:59:00,0,"You'll have to post next year following your trip. No doubt, you'll have a better fishing trip than us. We go on an early trip each year (other places) w/o the kids and generally do very well. We've done mid summer trips with the kids the last 4 years and have always caught walleye, but not as good as we do in the spring."
559790,Guest,2006-07-27 17:46:00,0,"Just got back Wednesday 7-26-06. My father-in-law and I fished for 31/2 days. Our first time there. Walleye were a little hard to find but by the 2nd and 3rd day we were catching 8-10 a day (not fishing strictly walleye all day long). Otheres in camp were also catching walleye and seemed quite happy (all first timers there). The high light for me was definitely the northern fishing. I caught a 40"" and a 30"". Father-in-law a couple of 27"". Easily caught 100 northerns between the 2 of us. We fished them quite a bit though. Had a great time. Great weather,price, no bugs. Would recommend but it was my first time to Canada fishing. My father-in-law has been to Canada many times and would like to make anual trip to Wabaskang after our time there."
559792,Guest,2006-07-27 18:28:00,0,"Oops,Sorry I wasn't at Wawang can't read. Just excited to talk about the 40"" northern some more. Wildernessgum"
559803,Mohleye,2006-07-28 10:12:00,368,"I'm sorry I am not familiar with Wawang. This lake has been discussed a lot on this site, and I have no ax to grind or opinion whatsoever. This is in response to Freight Train's post, and my reason for posting is that we were in NW Ontario the same week, and to maybe give you some basis for comparison. Our fishing was good. Not our best year, but certainly not our worst. Our group was 4 experienced fishermen. We have also made more spring than mid-summer trips, and my experience is that for sheer numbers, it's hard to beat spring fishing. The fish are a lot more concentrated and sometimes shallower, and when you find them you can usually catch a bunch without moving far. We also tend to catch more big fish in the spring. The pluses of summer fishing are the weather is typically better (or at least warmer), and the fish are more dispersed, making it fun to explore and try new spots. We probably averaged 50 walleye per boat per day, a variety of sizes. We caught no walleye over 25"". We caught at least a few walleye in almost every spot we tried, and in depths from 4'-25'. I'd bet many others who fished that week had as good success or better. I didn't feel there was anything remarkable about our week, positive or negative. I guess what I'm trying to say is that it sounds like you were disappointed in your walleye fishing, and are wondering whether you should be. My opinion is yes. This was a typical week of summer fishing, and in my opinion if a lake has a healthy walleye population, you should catch some fish if you give it a decent effort. Going several days without catching a single walleye would get me looking for a new lake. The fact that there are regulars who return every year may not be too significant. Some people reach a comfort level where they know the water and hazards; they like the owners and the camp; they are happy relaxing and catching a few fish; they just don't care to try anything new.....it sounds like a nice place, and checking their website, their rates are certainly reasonable. The walleye fishing sounds a bit suspect."
559814,Stu,2006-07-28 16:47:00,472,"Hey Mohleye, what lake do you fish, if you don't mind saying. We fished Wabby for years and are looking for a less-crowded lake. Wawang is pretty cheap ($400 per week, including boat & gas). I called about 30 people who fished there and everyone of them raved about the place. If anyone knows of a good walleye lake in that price range, I would certainly be interested in checking it out. The only prerequisite is that it be secluded. Wawang is the only resort on the lake and that is pretty attractive. Thanks in advance - Stu"
