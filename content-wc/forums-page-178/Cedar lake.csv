5758345,prov1800,2017-09-08 06:20:00,5010,Very interesting read.crappies have been in cedar now for a number of years.they have really spread into the east end of the lake and this year they seem to be larget than ever.they are also in nelson lake on the west side.but there seems to be very few west of there.unless i just havnt found them there yet.they seem to have made it to perrault lake as well and hearing reports from wabaskang to.
5758377,Bill Krejca,2017-09-08 06:40:00,6107,"Interesting read. My guess is that crappie introduction in a body of water depends much on the nature of the body of water, with larger(being one factor) waters, such as LOW, being able to adapt with less detriment to other species than would occur in smaller bodies, such as maybe Cedar. Time will tell. Just keep the netters out. Re: muskies - Since muskies prefer to spawn in warmer water than pike (and walleye), and maybe crappie, these other species do have a theoretical head start in the food chain; that is, earlier spawners are generally bigger than their young of the year brethren muskies. As they are bigger, they potentially are able to physically feed on the young muskies, theoretically inflicting damage on the muskie young-en's. With that in mind, I am reminded of the experiment conducted by the DNR in the 1950's in Whitefish Bay (and maybe other places) in LOW. Pound nets were placed in a number of bays in the southern portion.The goal was to trap and remove many of the pike, with the hope of allowing the muskie population to intensify. I don't know the results, if any were able to be tabulated, it sure shut down the great pike fishing in that section of the lake. Messin' with Mother Nature can provide some interesting and sometimes surprising results. Bill"
5758729,prov1800,2017-09-08 09:20:00,5010,The problem is they mess to much and years later scrambling to fix there screw ups.this year on cedar the walleye fishing was somewhat different.although it was good at times it wasnt like a normal season.iam not blaming crappies yet.lol.could have been weather related as we did experience lots of rain and cold fronts.but i did fish other lakes during those fronts and fishing was not affected.so this always puts questions in my mind.crappie bite is definatly on right now but walleye bite is very slow where at this time of the tear it should be excellent.they have come shallower on cedar and are mixed up with crappies and tight to the bottom.water temps (60-62 f)cooling daily now with cool overnight temps from near zero to 4-5c.can see a turn over happening if its already not in progress.warm weather coming back starting today and looks like all next week.so will see what that brings.
5745817,Duflebag,2017-08-30 07:30:00,218,"ProV, what do the weeds look like at this point of the year? Coming up in a few weeks and expect to be casting rocks as the cabbage will probably be gone by then."
5746033,prov1800,2017-08-30 09:30:00,5010,Its starting to get a dull look to them.but as long as they provide cover there still a good bet to fish.ill hit old weeds still in late sept/oct.but hooked into some weed that was really nice and green still.east end is gettingvthat murky look so there is decaying going on and pollen.west endcwas still nice and clear.
5751345,wallydave,2017-09-03 15:44:00,2151,Heading to Cedar Lake end of this week. Any recent report's on the roads and especially the fishing! Thanks!
5751417,prov1800,2017-09-03 17:44:00,5010,"Took some folks out today.walleyes are slow.never got lots in one spot.2-5 fish andcwould move on..we did okay but a slow bite.needed some patience.crappie fishing was fantastic.all big 12"" crappies again.weather really sucked.rained all day.gloomy no sun.only a hi of 13c.tomorrow not looking much better.ill let you know tomorrow how it goes if we go.might wait till teus depending on weather."
5751649,wallydave,2017-09-03 19:57:00,2151,Thanks for the update! I'm looking forward to trying a new lake. Any news or tips will surely help!
5754689,wallydave,2017-09-06 07:13:00,2151,Any updates from the weekend? Getting ready to try a new lake!
5755761,prov1800,2017-09-06 19:24:00,5010,Fished cedar again today.seems lake might be turning but not sure.walleyes are non existent on deep structure.they have most up shallower on mud.did pretty good on them today but only found them active in a few spots.crappies were nuts again.found them on a few of my spots.must of caught a 100+ today.we had a real fun time.guests are from wi and said they have never caught crappies like that before.fun day.weather looks very good for the rest of this week and next week looks even better.water temps today were 62 f.
5756177,revitup,2017-09-07 06:59:00,140,"Question for you Prov--I agree the crappie fishing has become pretty successful on Cedar and can bring a new enjoyment to fishing Cedar, but do you think they have negatively affected the walleye fishing there? I'd be interested to hear your view as you are one who regularly fishes Cedar and have for quite a few years."
5756305,prov1800,2017-09-07 07:37:00,5010,Interesting topic.have discussed it with a few folks.basically the west end does not have the population of crappies as does the east end although they are creeping in that direction.i personally havnt noticed any decline in walleyes on the east end.only problem i encounter as we did yesterday was getting through a school of crappies to get to the walleyes.crappies do seem to enjoy the same structures and mud areas as the walleyes.this summer has seemed of on walleye fishing but dont think the crappies are responsible for that.it just seemed walleyes preferred to bite later in the evening this year.lake of the woods has had crappies much longer than here and seems to be doing just fine.iam thinking it might impact the muskie fry.since they spawn somewhat later.all in all i think cedar lake is a awesome fishery and enjoy fishing it.
5757841,bthomas3333,2017-09-07 19:26:00,465,"For what its worth from In-Fisherman.http://www.in-fisherman.com/panfish/...hern-crappies/""Interspecific CompetitionEverything in nature comes at a price. In the case of exploding black crappie populations and the colonization of new waters, there is a corresponding drop in the number of some other species. Walleyes are the fish most often negatively affected by crappies. When conditions favor crappies, they can out-compete juvenile and young-of-the-year walleyes for food and space. Crappies also have been shown in some waters to be “heavy consumers”—predators of larval walleye."""

5725761,pale ryder,2017-08-18 16:09:00,1937,I'm also headed to Cedar tomorrow. I'll be in my white and blue Skeeter MX1825. If anyone sees me stop by and we can compare notes on fishing.
5733329,pale ryder,2017-08-22 20:10:00,1937,Missed you at the BBQ. As usual it was a good time.
5733513,prov1800,2017-08-22 21:14:00,5010,Sorry.got off lake late and still had fish to clean got to late.hows hwy 105
5733657,prov1800,2017-08-23 04:35:00,5010,Hope you had a good trip.i get to fish cedar for 3 days next week.
5739673,pale ryder,2017-08-26 20:05:00,1937,"Early in the week fishing was slow. Got some fish but had to work for them. Thursday and Friday was good. See fish on graph, drop down a minnow on a lindy rig, catch fish."
5739865,prov1800,2017-08-27 05:01:00,5010,Well ill have to try that today.raining right now.hope that quits by the time i get to camp.ill givecyou a report later.
5741001,prov1800,2017-08-27 19:30:00,5010,Well started with jigging and caught some that way but typically a slow bite but lots of fish on graph.lindy rig and that did pretty good but still not rwal fast either.trick today was drop shooting.that really seemed to turn them.had a decent day and we ended up with a good catch.water temps at 66f today.fished the west end today as my guests didnt want to go far from clarks everyday.
5745601,prov1800,2017-08-30 06:10:00,5010,Got out on cedar yesterday for a day of strictly muskie.they were very active in the morning.we boated 4 in the morning and one in the afternoon.saw some more follows and my two guests lost a couple each.mostly weed fish but did pick up a couple from some rock piles.great day of fishing.
5745769,wallydave,2017-08-30 07:20:00,2151,"That's what I'm talking about! I'm hoping for a couple nice Musky, enough walleyes for lunch and a couple of dinners! Great sunsets and maybe some Northern Lights too!"
5718610,prov1800,2017-08-15 06:54:00,5010,"Did a solo day on cedar lake.i mainly went to cast for muskie.i did need 4 walleye for supper and caught those on the first spot i stopped on.got them off the side of a hump that topped out at 10 ft and they were hanging off one side around 14-16 ft.only needed 4 fish and the first four that i caught were all 16-17"" so i was done in a hurry.fished a while longer and it seemed like a much better bite than last.saw three muskies and they were pretty lazy.one came in 3 times.she would come to the boat and stop.and sink down.i could see her and when i threw the lure 20 ft from boat she would hear it and head over to the sound.played a bit with her.she was a good 45"" fish.stopped in at cedar lake lodge and met up with a WC member that was there and had a great visit.hwy #105 is a mess as they are now tearing it apart to reurface.couple of stops at times but your vehicles and boats will get real dirty."
5718682,wallydave,2017-08-15 07:25:00,2151,Thanks for your update! I think we will pass on taking the 105 this year! Good to hear the fishing was ok. If I can catch walleyes for fun and eating and land a 40 plus Musky or pike I'll be happy!
5718954,port1042,2017-08-15 10:27:00,509,"I'll be fishing Cedar and Perrault in a couple of weeks. I haven't seem much concerning the general conditions. How's the water level, water temp and weed growth? It sounds like the catch has been a little tough this season but I'm sure it will be better than a day at work!"
5718978,prov1800,2017-08-15 10:49:00,5010,Absolutly..water level down a ft or so.really dont notice it.water temp on cedar yesterday on main lake was 72-74 f.
5718986,prov1800,2017-08-15 10:50:00,5010,Oh.and weed growth is awesome.but there are some bald spots here and there.strange.????.
5719546,Pat,2017-08-15 15:48:00,203,"Here at Cedar this week, our first trip to the lake. So we are newbies to the lake and in the process of learning it as we go. Got a nice map from our Northern Lights hosts to get us started. We've had a steady walleye bite each day so far. Best spots have been humps, best technique a jig and minnow. Most fish coming out of 10 to 18 fow and our range has been 14 to 18 inches. Water temp where we've roamed is 74 to 75 degrees."
