5684762,gordy28,2017-07-26 07:48:00,437,Ablack - wondering what shape the camp and camp boats were in at Hurst - I have heard that in some of MLO's lesser used camps they can be hit and miss Cheers Gordy
5724714,gordy28,2017-08-18 07:30:00,437,"Quick update - meeting with my group in two weeks to finalize: Right now its between Attwood (West Camp), Hurst or Weese with MLO or Ogoki Lake w Ogoki Lake Outfitters Have been given good insight into Hurst and Ogoki by many members of this site - many thanks! Anymore info on Weese or Attwood (particularly the west camp) would be great Thanks! Gordy"
5759465,gordy28,2017-09-08 18:00:00,437,Wanted to post a quick update. My group just put a deposit down on Ogoki Lake w Ogoki Lake outposts for 2018. Many thanks to all of those who provided input. Greatly appreciated Gordy
5381474,515,2017-03-07 18:01:00,254,"Gordy We actually stayed on Felsia Lake in 2007 thru Leuenbergers but fished most of the time on Hurst Lake. It's a huge body of water with all the structure you could ever want to fish. They have the two camps on the lake and not sure how busy the camps are or if they just use one of them now a days. We spend a lot of time fishing at the in flowing river and anytime of the day it was none stop walleye action with the average size being 2.5-3 lbs easily. I'm not sure who owns it or what it is but there is a camp set up on the right side of the in coming flow that looks like either a native camp, a trappers set up or possible a moose camp someone has set up there not sure if legal or not but its there. There are no boats there so i'm not sure why its there. If you have a chance I don't think you will be disappointed in the lake, its one I would consider going to if the chance every comes around in the future. I made reference to it in this report http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...sia-lake-2007/ Good Luck with your choice"
5393138,gordy28,2017-03-13 08:43:00,437,"Thanks all for the great feedback Sounds like Hurst could be a winner as well - Smokey thanks for taking the time to post Adam - I hear you re Pringle size but I do think our group is intrigued by the ""fishiness"" On our last trip I think we figured out that quantity and ""easy"" numbers is big for us Meeting next week with our group to finalize so the feedback is awesome Will definitely post our choice when finalized AG"
5393402,wdkott,2017-03-13 09:41:00,26,"Hurst Lake has fantastic walleye fishing where the Attwood River comes into the lake. I fished Hurst while using Leuenberger's Felsia Lake cabin. Water levels were very low in June when I was there a few years back, and we actually had to leave a boat at Hurst and walk from Felsia boat to Hurst boat in the shallows. Water was shallow at incoming flow from Attwood Lake, and area where it came in from was filled with water grass, which was a source of many minnows and insects/nymphs. Walleyes were stacked and you could literally see them like trout in a stream. Even on bright sunny days the walleyes were there in the shallows from 1 feet to 12 feet deep. Nice sized fish as well, averaging 2 to 2 and half pounds. Bottom line is you could catch walleyes there at will all day long. There is also a nice sandy beach area nearby for shore lunch.Tried some other spots on the lake with limited success, always ended up at the hotspot."
5394866,Bfgilly,2017-03-13 18:05:00,18,"Fishing with MLO is an outstanding vacation, you will not be disappointed. Although I have not fished on Hurst, I have been fishing on Attwood for several years (even before Don purchased the lake). Hurst connects with Attwood so the fishing would be very similar with Attwood being the larger lake. The fishing is excellent. The camps are not fancy but in very good condition & the boats & motors run very well. Don will do everything he can to fly you in & out on time, weather permitting. Last year we wanted to try something different so we went to Pringle. It's a much smaller lake with a lot of weed beds (even in the middle of the lake). We had bad weather but the fishing was good. Don told us since we had fished Attwood for so long, we would probably want to go back there. He was right, we simply like the style of fishing & the larger lake better. Pringle is a great walleye lake, just different from what we were used to. MLO also charges in Canadian dollars & the exchange rate is very good now. I hope you find what you are looking for."
5404082,gordy28,2017-03-17 10:10:00,437,"Thanks so much Interested in the type of fishing on Pringle - re lots of weeds Most of our experience has been fishing more traditional rocky shield structure on our trips - lots of jigging, lots of bouncing with harnesses On Pringle with the weeds interested in how others fished the lake - jigging in the weeds? Slip bobbers? trolling around the edges? Thanks so much Gordy"
5416418,Bfgilly,2017-03-22 17:38:00,18,"Pringle is a pretty easy lake to fish. We were there at the end of August last year. Weeds were in the middle of the lake ( not all the way to the surface ) but you could work a jig through them with no problem. We had our best fishing at the Northeast end of the lake. There are a couple of small points on the way up that held fish. We also had an outstanding evening right behind the cabin. Enjoy your trip, you should have great fishing."
5467874,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-04-11 18:54:00,240,Any verdict yet? I'm asking because I am going back to MLO later this summer (August) or early next year. Would love to go back to Auger.
5489082,gordy28,2017-04-20 13:52:00,437,"No verdict yet - as we aren't going until August 2018 probably won't decide until June as the group is fishing together in the Kawarthas for a weekend I would say its between Pringle, Hurst and Weese wtih MLO and Ogoki Lake in Nakina with Ogoki Lake Outfitters Cheers Gordy"
5506898,ablack86,2017-04-28 10:13:00,17,"I have fished both Ogoki Lake and Hurst. Hurst Fished it in 2016. We hit it around the Mayfly hatch which made the Walleye bite a little sporadic. Sporadic meaning we caught a mess of Walleye, but depending on time of day they could completely turn-off. Tons of pike, but did not catch any big ones despite putting in a lot of work and targeting them. Either way, great lake, we just were unlucky to hit it during the MayFly hatch. Ogoki Really cool lake. We went in 2010 I think.... Caught 2 ~ 40 inch pike while jigging for walleye. Tons of Walleye near moving water, ESPECIALLY near Kayedon Lake. This lake is HUGE and can get really rough if conditions deteriorate. We had one scary day on the lake with swells coming over the bow. Both lakes are great, good luck, have fun!"
5519234,gordy28,2017-05-03 08:04:00,437,Thanks! Very helpful I will make sure I update this thread once we make the final call Cheers Gordy
5364898,gordy28,2017-02-28 13:05:00,437,Hey there I was hoping to get some feedback on a few of MLO's lakes for a 2018 trip For our group our focus would be primarily on numbers for walleye Secondary focus would be on the opportunity for + 25 inch walleyes Pike are not a big focus for us I would say we are also interested in a small to medium sized lake (lets say 2000 - 5000 acres) Big enough to not get bored but small enough to concentrate fishing efforts/not get blown off the lake Right now most intriguing lakes to us are: Pringle Vick Hurst Weese Just interested in others opinions on which lake you think fits with our fishing criteria Thanks in advance Gordy
5366498,Jeler,2017-03-01 07:46:00,92,"GordyI can only speak of Pringle lake from our experience 2 years ago.Numbers were incredible with the majority of the fish anywere from16""-20"". Managed to hook into a few larger but never any +25"" Walleye, but you would think they would be there someplace. Hooked into fewer than12 northerns the entire week with the largest up around 10lbs.Pringle is a great lake with excellent accommodations. Wind was a major factor only on one day when we were fishing on the eastern end and thewind kicked up from the west. It was a wet slow ride back to the cabin.Dinner can be pulled in right from the dock!You'll be hard pressed to find any better outfitter than Mattice and a phone call to Don Elliot may be better at answering some of your questions.Have a great time!"
5367066,gordy28,2017-03-01 11:30:00,437,Thanks! Very helpful
5367482,Jeler,2017-03-01 13:45:00,92,GordyYou are welcomed! Hopefully you'll get some feedback from others in reference to the lakes you mentioned! My wife and I are going to Auger Lake with Mattice in August! Can't wait and it's never too early to start planning your trip!Jeff
5369626,Herkyhawk00,2017-03-02 15:05:00,33,"I am taking my two boys to Pringle this Summer, July 20th, for the first time. Plan to write something up on it. Pretty stoked."
5369866,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-03-02 17:08:00,240,"Spent a week last May/June at Auger with my brother. Despite the coldest weather I have ever endured in Canada, we had at least two 200 walleye days. MLO is first class all the way, and I so much appreciated the fact that Don allowed a party of 2 to fly in. Would love to go back to Auger--the cabin is very nice, and everything worked well. Nice small lake, easy to fish and to navigate. Don marked the maps very well, and all we did was follow his directions around the lake.Enjoy your trip!"
5374546,gordy28,2017-03-05 02:35:00,437,Thanks all. Appreciated very much. Pringle is high on our list and hasn't looked at Auger. Will now! Really interested in Weese and Hurst as well. Hopefully I get some feedback on those two as there aren't a ton Of reports when I search and most are quite oldPosting this from Punta Cana and it's 81 degrees much better than home where it was 0 and snowing when we left. Life is good lol CheersGordy
5374866,515,2017-03-05 07:48:00,254,Gordy I'm on shift this weekend but once done I'll get u some info on Hurst as I get sometime this week. My quick opinion is its an awesome lake. Mike
5375282,adempsey2.0,2017-03-05 11:40:00,612,"I have no experience with MLO, but everyone knows they have a stellar reputation. I would love to book any of their lakes. So, just from a dummies perspective, I'd forget about Vick. It's stated as a predominantly Pike lake. Which wouldn't make sense for you guys.Pringle, looks like a boring lake to me. I like lakes with plenty of islands, bays etc. Pringle doesn't offer much of that. Auger, Hurst and Weese all look like great options to me. A lot of interesting looking areas to fish. Hurst used to have another camp on it, but I don't think it's in use any more. It's probably big enough to support two camps though. Weese is like three lakes in one.However, it sounds like Auger might suit your group the best given the portage lakes. Guerin might also be worth a look if you like hitting portage lakes. If you have no interest in portage lakes, Weese or Hurst might make better choices, especially if your group is 6+.Anyway, just an armchair cowboy's opinion."
5378082,Jeler,2017-03-06 12:53:00,92,"Yea, you are correct, Pringle is pretty ""boring"" (not). I do understand what you are saying however as wanting a bit more interesting topography. Totally with you on that! However we were never bored catching walleye one after another. Even took some time to hike a bit along some of it's beautiful shores and wade along one of the sandy shorelines. There's sufficient structure here too, but it doesn't have trees growing on it! My wife and I would definitely go back and enjoy the solitude esp with the big covered porch while watching the Northern Lights! Mattice in our book offers a ""top notch"" professional service!"
