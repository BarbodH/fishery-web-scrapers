I am fortunate to do two trips a year, but the second one has to be more budget conscious because I invite my father in law and pay his lodging. We usually stay near Chapleau but I am interested in traveling a bit further in 2018 and came upon Northernwoods while searching drive to lakes. I found some older posts on Northernwoods Lodge but was wondering if anyone has been there or has feedback from the 2017 season. The website says it is under new ownership but I have no idea how long it has been under new ownership. Any information would be great, and PM's would be great. Thanks!"

We fished out of Lukinto Lake Lodge but that was 20 years ago and the ownership has changed since. It looks like Northwoods is located right in town and to fish other lakes than Long Lake you would have to drive to them. We did it the same way at LLL and always had a great time at a good price. Someday I'm going to make a trip back there just to fish Chipman, Fernow, and a few other lakes."
