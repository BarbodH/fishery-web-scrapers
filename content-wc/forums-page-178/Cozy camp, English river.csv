5734233,northerneyes,2017-08-23 10:38:00,72,Haven't fished it this year. What time of year did you fish it last time. We fished it in late September 2012 and not much luck. Fished it in July and August 2013 and 2014 and was much better. What days will you be there? We are trying to get enough in our party to go there sometime in September
5742561,Kurtsley,2017-08-28 17:18:00,2,We always fish around the middle of September. I would say we've had pretty good luck two of the last three years. I've wondered how the fishing is earlier in the summer. How were the bugs when you went in July and August?
5743073,northerneyes,2017-08-28 21:23:00,72,Mosquitos were still persistent onshore. No other bugs to speak of. Cleaning fish in the fish cleaning house at night was particularly bad for mosquitos. Had to work fast or get eaten alive.
5763041,northerneyes,2017-09-12 05:27:00,72,"Just returned from Cozy Camp. Fishing was good some days, not so good others. Some days walleye size was less than 14-16 inches but other days caught several 18-23 inch. Night crawlers seemed to be the preferred bait. Bugs almost non-existent. Equipment in good shape."
