5764953,troutwater,2017-09-13 06:26:00,299,Just looking for some lodge suggestions on the northeast side of Rainy Lake around Red Gut and Seine Bays. I did a brief search but didn't find much. Want to be close to the muskie water thanks.
5765553,Dog,2017-09-13 12:42:00,210,I just stayed a week at Taylors Cove and its a nice little resort. Clean and quiet. The don't have a website but if you're interested give Ed a call @ 807-481-2526. They are located between Red Gut and Seine. Fred
