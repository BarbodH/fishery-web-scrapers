We have done pretty good for the walleyes but havent really caught the numbers and size of pike that I have heard about Lac Seul. The ones we do catch are by accident while jigging for walleye. We want to try some trolling and specifically target pike this year. Does anybody have recommendations on depths to start looking? Also, what speed is better for trolling pike compared to walleye? Thanks for any suggestions."

1109134,teddi,2009-05-29 11:32:00,349,there is a hidden bay off the south east corner of steamboat bay. it is very good for pike 99% of the time. lots of weeds and has some shallow areas.
1109151,Mike Kansas,2009-05-29 12:17:00,1463,"Weeds are definitly a good spot but weed cover is sparse in early june. Look for bays that you can see young weeds on the bottom with depth finder and run your baits over top of the weeds. Also try casting island points especially if they are windy. Big Spoons Big cranks Big spinner baits Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1109311,orchard frank,2009-05-30 07:29:00,1900,"Almost every large pike that my wife or I caught on L.S came from deeper water or rocky drop-offs. If you are fishing reefs for wallys, have a pole rigged up with something big (our favorites were big firetiger spinnerbaits or Super Shad Raps) make a few casts every once in a while. With so much of the area we fished having a secondary drop off at about 28', this seemed to be a likely area for the big pike to prowl, waiting for an unlucky walleye to drift over the edge. While we could find good numbers around weedy areas, they tended to be smaller. Also, we didn't target pike very often, but deep reef edges (in August especially, but other times too) were our most consistant big pike producers, 32"" and up. Our best was a 44"" fencepost caught in 8' of water on a walleye jig by my wife, in August, on a mirror-flat, HOT, day. So much for figuring them out."
1109329,BenBeattie,2009-05-30 08:30:00,232,"You've got some great advice so far. I'll echo the comment about targeting pike around windy/rocky points. These types of spots hold walleye and pike will hunt for here as well. Early in the season I like to throw suspending minnow baits (huskey jerks, etc.) but as the water warms I'll go to a faster presentation. My favourite, by far, is an inline bucktail spinner. These are great search baits as you can bomb long casts and make fast (or slow) retrieves. If you're fishing unfamiliar water, however, trolling is the best way to cover water and locate structure. I usually troll plugs, super shad rap is a good one. Vary your speed to find one that works, make 'S' turns to speed up the outside line and slow down the inside line. This tactic not only changes the speed of your baits but it allows you to work different depths and often produces hits. If you can find a weedbed with a shoal/reef near by, work it hard, these are great pike spots. Another type of structure that holds pike are shallow (4' - 8')saddles/sandbars that run between mainland and a near by island. Even better if the top of the bar has weeds on it. Pike use this structure to ambush prey. They will sit on the deep side and wait for something to swim over the bar. Good luck!!"
1109715,chock,2009-06-01 06:42:00,19,great information guys. Thanks. I can think of one spot we fished alot that seemed to get a pike every time. It was a saddle area between two islands kind of by Lunker Point. That spot is a classic example of the saddle that was mentioned. Maybe we will have to fish it a little harder with actual pike lures and try different depths this year.
1109774,Guest,2009-06-01 09:13:00,0,"Teddi, I can't believe you gave up that spot. Well, I'll give up one also. When going into Shanty West, idle into the stump field straight ahead instead of making the right hand turn. Cast what ever you want in there and hang on. For safety reasons, I said IDLE into the stump field."
1109829,Guest,2009-06-01 12:43:00,0,"ALB: I fished your spot last week, caught some nice Northerns there too! We went all the way back into that bay too, nice spot."
1109905,schick,2009-06-01 17:51:00,35,"We just returned from fishing for pike in the central part of Lac Seul. The three of us in my boat caught 553 in less than 5 days with the largest this year a 40.5 inch pike. My son caught one 2 years ago that was 46 inches and 30 pounds. We fish the last week of May. At that time we fish marshy bays exclusively, casting spoons in shallow water 2-3 feet depth. We find that bays with deep water channels within the bay have the greatest concentrations of pike. The bays that warm up first have the best action. I would assume that as the summer progresses the pike will move to the points like so many of the respondents have stated. We started out as walleye fishemen on Lac Seul who occasionally fished pike and now we are 90% pike fishermen who squeeze in a few hours each evening for walleye. NEPiker"
