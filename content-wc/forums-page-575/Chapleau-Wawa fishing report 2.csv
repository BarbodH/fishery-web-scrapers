1110044,Mike Borger,2009-06-02 03:53:00,1554,How do you manage that and live/guide at your parents lodge?Are you home schooled?Regardless I find your posts interesting.
1110047,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-02 04:55:00,66,Young Canadian Guide - We are coming up your way in 2 weeks. Could you keep me posted on the black fly situation. I would greatly appreciate it.
1110069,Beechnut,2009-06-02 06:10:00,8,"To Big Tex: Have you ever spent much time in Canada? Well if you have then you should know that locals don't really appreciate it when other locals just give out info on there fishing spots. I mean would you? So maybe Youngcanadianguide's father is trying to A) follow the rules of this website, and B) Keep his dignity in the community. I think you can take or leave his advice, I personally think it is good advice and he is lagit. Besides I have to assume that you are American, as am I, and even thought the outdoor /fishing/hunting industry is a billion dollar plus industry for CA people don't just want to tell you so you can go hit there hotspots that have taken them years to locate and learn to fish. I say this, if some joe schmoe asked me how to or where to Fish Burt Lake (northern Michigan, and it's BIG) I would tell them to fly a kite. Wouldn't you? if it were your home turf? I understand if your looking for validity. But dang man, just take the advice or leave it, there is no need to badger this dude. (or lady I suppose) It's all about the fishing, lets have some fun! And thanks Youngcanadianguide, I'll be using some of your advice to catch some big Eyes in about a week! Godbless-"
1110078,Guest,2009-06-02 06:40:00,0,"You can't possibly paint a whole region with one brush Big Tex. I am from Michigan and have fished that area about once per year for last fifteen. There are many mediocre lakes in that area, but we know several very good fishing spots (drive-ins and fly-ins). We put in the time to explore and we don't pinpoint locations to strangers just willy nilly. We went through a MNR check point Sunday and even gave them only a vague description of where we were fishing."
1110114,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-02 07:58:00,60,I am home schooled for the few weeks that I miss when I come up in May and Then for the first quarter of the year I am home schooled. I will be on ecot for the first quarter and then will go back into public schooling for the last three quarters.The small brown mayflys are starting to hatch. Not the big ones. Leeches are starting to work well. The water temperature is 53 degrees and the walleye fry are about 1/4 inch long in the shallows. The blackflys arn't bad and the mosquitoes arn't either. Beware they will be here. The average temperatures during the day has been in the 50's and in the 30s at night. We did have snow on sunday morning This is why the bugs are not attacking. Let me know If you need any more bug reports. Youngcanadianguide
1110133,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-02 08:27:00,66,Thanks. Keep me posted. I am wondering if this is a Deep Woods Off trip or a headnet and duct tape around the cuffs trip.
1110157,ukats,2009-06-02 09:30:00,9,"Thanks young guide, I appreciate all of the information! Keep the great reports coming, and I was very surprised of your age, you show a level of maturity that obviously some do not have on this site.Dave"
1109584,youngcanadianguide,2009-05-31 15:16:00,60,"Fishing was excellent the first part of the week, but it did slow down toward the end of the week- northeast wind settled in. Our guest were reporting that minnows are still hot. Fishing in the ranges of 3' to 20'. Jigging still the best way. We did break the 30'' range for walleye this week, in fact one group has caught two- 31.25'' & 32'' -they did C&R THEM. (so you can catch 30'' plus walleye in eastern Ontario !!)The pike fishing is still going strong, there was quite a few caught over 30'' & one 41'' this week - every over 28'' was C&R. Most of the pike were caught in any incoming water, with most of the bigger pike in the deeper water just off the shallow flats. We did catch a few lakers this week, even one guest caught one casting from the docks in front of his cabin so they are still very shallow. White fish are being caught trolling very slow along shoreline with a Rapala. The water temps are in the low 50's. The black flies are just starting, but the mosquitoes are very scarce at this time. My mom and dad fished for 30 min. and came in with 6 15''-17'' walleye to eat, they said the bit was slow. They just let the jig sat on the bottom until the walleye pick it up - a cold northeast wind was blowing. So it wasn't about numbers, it was about getting back to the fire place with dinner. NOTE: Dave, you asked me about were my camp is. I can't tell you, the reason is my dad said I could post on this site as along as I don't give any info. about our camp. Sorry but I can keep you updated on the fishing in this area. My Dad thinks that too many camps are using this site as advertisment. You shouldn't be allowed to post the name of your lake or camp. This site has rules that say this site can't be used as advertisment but unfortunatly some camps do and the name of their lake is their profile name. This is just my opinion but I don't run the site.Catch and release fishing is a lot like sports you don't have to eat the ball to have fun- unknown youngcanadianguide"
1109727,Guest,2009-06-01 07:34:00,0,"I'll echo your statement that eastern Ontario still has good fishing. We just got back from a long weekend in your general area. We fished for pike on a smaller lake we staked out fifteen years ago and boated 50 northern between two boats in two days. We had more than a dozen over 30-inches including three 39"", a 36"" and a 35"". Weather was a little cool, but kept the bugs down. Keep up the good reports."
1109761,ukats,2009-06-01 08:55:00,9,"OK, what lakes do you fish on?Burt"
1109862,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-01 14:51:00,60,"Hey Bertgetting that information about where my lake is and what lakes I fish would be like beating a dead horse to get information, your not going to get it out of me. HA HA HA I hope no offense is taken. The reason is that my parents are very strict. There rules are comandments 11-20. If I step out of line, WACK. But with all seriousness my parents are very good to me and I love them a lot. If I get in trouble I know I deserve it. So all in all I can only give you one hint we are between Chapleau and Wawa. Just remember if you call around and ask for youngcanadianguide I will return your call. Happy fishing.I'm only 14 and loving life. Look at it this way if I break one of the comandments 11-20 my dad won't will the camp to me. Then, I would be like a fish out of water. Last nights fishing report is that fishing is still good and the guys caught lots of walleye and pike. When you get back from your trip let me know how you do. Youngcanadianguide"
1109873,teddi,2009-06-01 16:08:00,349,some people follow the posting rules on this site. no advertizing allowed
1109882,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-01 16:47:00,60,"so Big Tex you want to pick an argument with a 14 year old. Let me go read the rules on posting for this website. Yes Big Tex just to let you know I know where you fish. You advertise for them all the time.I may be small and not as old and wise as you but I know how to fish. Your just like the fish in my lake you bite. No offense taken Big Tex but I'm no push over for a 14 year old. Remember I hang with the best of them and I've got special privlages, I'm the camp owners son. Thanks teddi for sticking up for the little guy. Youngcanadianguide"
1109897,teddi,2009-06-01 17:29:00,349,"if you don,t like the post don,t read it. start your own thread and don,t hijack some ones else,s. the kid is giving a report on fishing in his area so don,t knock him. us canadian,s have to stick together."
1109952,Hike'n'Fish,2009-06-01 19:41:00,23,"Give the kid a break Tex. If the fishing is so awesome up near white river, then why are you so bent out of shape that he won't tell you where he's fishing? Doesn't really add up. The kid is following his parents rules, and I applaud him for that! Respect is a lost art these days. Later, Hike'n'Fish"
1109953,bob oh,2009-06-01 19:42:00,3936,"Com'on teddi, whats the point of the post? We catch fish but it's a secret?"
1110008,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-01 21:05:00,60,"The rules are rules Big Tex and Bob oh. Its not that fishing is a big seceret I am just following the rules. If my parents want to advertise then they will pay walleye central to do that. My fishing reports are genuin and truthful as are the fish and their sizes. If I told you anything about my parents camp then people would look at my reports and wonder if I was doing this to gain more customers. I do these reports to help other peoples fishing trips be more enjoyable and help them catch fish. Also, I do want to help people come more prepared for their trip. If I can go out of my way to help others then I will. Most of Canada needs business and my goul is to bring people to Canada for enjoyment, fishing, and just the beauty of this country that we all can enjoy.(I do live in the U.S.) It's not about my parents camp it's about all of the camps in Ontario. The reason that my parents have this rule is becuase for 3 years we haven't had an open cabin at our camp. In fact this year we have been turning people away to other camps becuase of limited availabilty. Just remember the rule is the rule there is no BIG SECERETS. Their is nothing in these reports for my family it's just about fishing and giving information. Like the guys said if you don't like it then don't read it. Bob oh as you being a charter member you should know the rules and i'm not your dad.Also, I would like to thank all of the people that stood up for me. So thanks. Report 3 will come next week after my canoe trip with my dad and brother on a new river i've never been on. Youngcanadianguide"
