I've heard that things are a couple weeks behind in regards to spawning. I've been fishing Canada lakes for over 20 years but this is only my 3rd year going to Lac Seul. the last two years we were fishing the lake around June 8-14th. This year we will be there a week later, June 13-19. Any opinions or experiences fishing that 2nd week as opposed to the 3rd? is one week earlier or later generally much different? Just wondering what to expect."

1109368,BenBeattie,2009-05-30 12:26:00,232,"Which part of Lac Seul exactly? One week won't make much of a difference... besides with the late ice out, everthing is behind compared to other years. Last year was the same though, late ice out. See my posts in the topic 'Lac Seul Chatter'... should give you some tips for your trip to LS.

The main lake points are starting to show signs of schooling walleye, but many fish are still going to trickle down through Birch narrows and Chamberlain in the weeks to come."
1109409,Guest,2009-05-30 17:22:00,0,"jgt24: You could'nt pick a better spot, Bill is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet! I was just up there, week after opener. Fishing was slow at best, water temp was 45-55. Now when I say slow, we still caught over 350 walleyes, I,m spoiled I guess. Get your map ready, here we go! I would start out at the mouth of the river, sooner or later those walleyes are going to come out of there, and when they do, it will be good for about 3-4 days. The lake came up about 3-4 FOW while I was there. The santurary will open the 15th I think, that could be good also. Check out Lunker point by the sign, look for a wind that is blowing in there, S, SE, or SW are all good. The sand point across from Lunker, to the east, is also a good spot. Sawmill Bay had alot of boats too, work the points as you are going in there. Radar island is a good spot, look for water temp 50-60, and a wind blowing into the island. Now we went all the way into Sawmill, Cramp creek, and the other creek on the east side. Talked to a local, said the Suckers haven't even spawned yet, that could be good for you too. They might be done by then, though. Bannatyne Bay is also a good spot, check out the small creek inlet, especialy if they have gotten alot of rain. That whole bay has alot of potential, fish the break lines, or go shallow if you get a S SW SE wind, could be good. Iran creek was good to us, just in the evenings though. I would give it a shot. Mouth of the river was good also the last few hours of the day. Bannatyne, and Sawmill are usaually good from 9am-5pm. And if you are adventureous, I heard there were alot of boats in Broad, and Sunlight. I hope this helps you, if you want more info, holler."

1109769,Guest,2009-06-01 09:04:00,0,"This time of year you will get all the northern you can handle with the eyes or on the eyes. Wished I was up there now, but I have to wait 30 days yet. Enjoy."
