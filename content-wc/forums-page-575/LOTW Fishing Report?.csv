1110088,2Labs,2009-06-02 07:08:00,685,"Here are reports from the folks who work at the camp I have been going to since 1993. July will be trip number 28 for me. These reports are pretty accurate and honest. Or, at least they have been in the past.http://www.witchbay.com/fishrpt.htm"
1110089,MN_Moose,2009-06-02 07:12:00,965,Which camp Lunker? We'll be at Smith's Camp 6/6 - 6/12.
1110096,Obabikon,2009-06-02 07:21:00,2370,"I just had a group of 45 guys leave. In three days of fishing, they caught 50+ fish over 25inches. The biggest was 29 and 3/4's... lots of 28's and 29's. The crappies are going wild too. They're in deeper water still... 18-20feet. Northern fishing has been a struggle. Just no real numbers yet. The bass have been going crazy. Shore lines on the big lake have lots of smallies. The spawn areas in Obabikon lake are holding lots of large mouth. So, it's been a great few days for bass."
1110206,rpieske,2009-06-02 11:33:00,1276,"Here in Nestor Falls, we must be a few days behind you. Fishing is still al little slow and the smallies have yet to appear. Seeing a few Northern and even some muskies (males) beginning to cruise the shoreline. Walleye are still in 18-24 feet. This warmer weather (Warmer??) has raised the water temperature about 6 degrees which will help."
1110212,@Lunker,2009-06-02 11:43:00,835,"I won't be at Smith's Camp, but rather the one that 2Labs references. Since I visit that camp several times a year, even crossing paths with 2Labs on a regular basis (usually on his birthday) , I monitor their site regularly. I just wanted a different perspective, as seems to be indicated by the differing reports from Obabikon and Mr. Pieske.Thanks all, guys. Fish on !!"
1110706,Hawker,2009-06-03 16:48:00,3967,"Fished out of Young's Wilderness Camp from Memorial Weekend till Saturday past and headed home. Average water temps in Stevens Bay was 56 and on sunny days (very few of them) temps would reach 59-60. Smallies were staged up in 6-10 fow just off of their spawning banks with X-Raps Long-A's being the best baits found for them. Caught a few on tubes late in the day up shallow on the sunny days. Eyes were in 18-22 fow in decent numbers on minnow tipped jigs early and late in the day. Pike were there in good numbers but striking pretty short or just slashing at the baits but when we switched from spinner baits to spoons (5-O'Diamonds being the best overall) and fished them slow, they got hammered. Caught smallies up to 20"", 15-20"" eyes and lots of 30+ inch pike with a 40"" being our biggest. Caught two small musky (males I assume) fishing for pike and Thursday morning just before lunch caught (and released very much alive and well) my personal best Musky ever at 54 1/2 inches while fishing for smallies. Eased her into the cradle, got a good measurement, and released her to go make more!! I had every intention of giving you a holler and hooking up with you rpieske (Bob) but once I got there, I just couldn't break myself away to come to town, sorry!! Looks like I may come back up mid August so if your still there I'm gonna look you up!"
1110938,rpieske,2009-06-04 13:35:00,1276,"Glad you had a successful trip to Young's. I haven't been up to Steven's this year, but it does warm up faster than the rest of the area. I went out yesterday with a couple of young folks and we caught walleye, sauger, northern, smallies and even a muskie. Saw a number of muskies in shallow..even some nice sized females in the 50"" class. I'll still be here in August, so give me a shout. Doesn't look like you will need me to mark up a map for you....you did great during a rough spring. Take care."
1111094,whirli_7,2009-06-05 07:42:00,11,"I got back from our cabin on Sat. First day up, we fished for about 8 hours and caught just a few. I did manage to catch two 19inch bass which was a blast.Second day. The wind switched, we had all sorts of luck in our usual places.With all the unstable weather right now, they really seem to be scattered, and moving around. We found most of our fish, right where the sand meets the rocks. Or on the outer edges of weedbeds. Our third day we decided to stay at the cabin and get some projects done. This Stankin win this spring kept us off the lake.Good luck"
