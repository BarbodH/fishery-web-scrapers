511332,Guest,2001-03-05 10:49:00,0,"I have been lurking here quite a while to pick up info, and you guys are helpful. So I thought I would just ask.I am going on my first walleye/pike fishing trip this July to Knobbys. It is in Northwest Ontario. I am trying to put together tackle for the trip. So what i am wanting from you guys is this. What tackle would the Ultimate Tackle Box be filled with. Be as specific as you can. Thanks for your help, Chris"
511333,Guest,2001-03-05 20:55:00,0,"You'll get a different answer from everyone, but the best answers will prob. come from the guides on the lake. They'll know the best techniques for the lake your on. I can give you this advice though, try the Knobby burger!"
1110285,walleyecetcher,2009-06-02 14:21:00,6,"alot of jigs,plastics and minnows. Husky jerks and taildancers or worm harness's for trolling. I think you could actually jig up walleyes up there with a hook and a gummy bear. Been there alot and its alot of fun."
1110309,Guest,2009-06-02 15:28:00,0,"I'm not sure which lake you are going to, but I assume it is an average sized, slightly tea stained Canadian Shield Lake. Bring lots of stuff cause its fun, but you will probably only use a few. Here is what worked for my NWO trips: For Walleye: 6' or 6.5' medium spinning rod & reel spooled with clear 8 lb test (or flame green fireline). 1. ¼ oz jigs with a yellow double twister tail. Chartreuse plastic is a close second. Come to think of it, all colors work. Any jig color as long as it has a big hook. I prefer to use stand up jigs (the ones that are flat on the bottom and the eye in front). That way it slides over vegetation when I cast and swim it back. Bring lots due to rocky snagfests. 2. Crankbaits - My favorites include Rattlin Rogues (floater or suspending) or a Shad Raps. Best colors include; gold with black back, perch, firetiger or silver with black back. Backups include Original Rapalas, Husky Jerks, Wally Divers, Taildancers. 3. More jigs For Pike: 7' medium or medium heavy baitcaster with clear 20 lb. mono test. Leaders (20 or 30 lb) with quality swivels. 1. Spoons  Daredevles about 4' long. Colors include; 5 of Diamonds, metallic colors. Doctor spoons in any color or Red Eyes in any color any size  silver being best. 2. A large crankbait/stickbait for monster trolling. The largest husky jerk would be the smallest bait here. Musky bait sized like a Bucher depthraider. Trolling a large suick over weeks may work if the biggies are still shallow. 3. Johnson weedless spoon because it is a provincial law that you must have one in you possession at all times. Ok, ok maybe it is just a tradition. 4. ½ oz jig with large plastic to fish deep water. Misc: 1. A good rod holder that can clamp on the side of the boat. Its really helpful for lazy trolling, when digging in the cooler or camera, etc. 2. Lure retriever  helps to get those $5 crankbaits back. 3. Anchor kit. OK, maybe the work kit is a little fancy here. A rope and something to secure a rock with (like a wire or a mesh bag). 4. Good hook file  dem rocks will bend many a hook point 5. Regular plastics work just file  no real improvement with Powerbait, Gulp, gulp alive, etc. 6. Portable depthfinder with fresh batteries."
1110311,pegasis0066,2009-06-02 15:34:00,64,"Spoons and top water lures for pike. IMO, nothing more fun than having a big lunker pike hit your top water lure. And a few random items:- Steel leaders - although a friend of mine swears by titanium as they don't kink, but they're about $10 a pop! - Long needle nose pliers for those pesky hook-ups that don't want to come loose. - Gripper gloves for when you need to get a real good grip on a fish (or for the boat mate that is afraid to touch fish!) - inch or two wide foam weatherstripping... stick it inside the boat hull and hang many of your lures on it to provide easy access vs. having to always access your tackle bag/plastic containers Have fun"
1110372,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-02 18:12:00,66,I will echo what the others have said.Jig and Twistertails - I read up there that regular plastics work just fine but I swear by Tournament Strength Power Grubs. Chartruese or WhiteTail Dancers TD-5 and TD-7 Silver with Blue back...Accept no substitute.Perhaps the most versatile is the Silver/Black Husky Jerk. I caught the big walleye for the week and the big pike for the week on back to back casts with this lure once.Johnson's Silver Spoons for those afternoons when the walleye bite is slow and you want to go have some fun wobbling these just below the surface for pike.EDIT: You are going to want a tape measure. Nobody appreciates an estimator.
1110405,new hips,2009-06-02 19:41:00,498,"Well, Bottom bouncers with 1 1/2 oz and 2oz weight, figure on losing 2 rigs a day at least. different colored colorado blades, I like gold. Fireline 4 lb for walleye, it's impossible to break, 8-10 lb for Northern.(by biggest Northern 40in came walleye fishing with 6lb fireline) Shad raps gold and silver #5. I have a ton of spoons. Most are 1 1/8 oz five of diamonds, silver minnows in gold silver and perch, I try to find any spoon with gold backs I find are more effective. Canada is color and size, color can be met with different twister tails and most years the 3/4 to 1 oz is all you need. Last year I used a lindy walking sinker with a soft floater with a leech almost all week for walleyes. Give it a 5-6 ft leader and back troll as slow as possible. If fish are neutral go basic- lindy rig with crawler or leech or minnow. I always carry a extra bag with rain suit and overnight stranded items, whistle, firestarter and usually beef sticks, keep in boat at all times. Never been stranded but it does happen, always tell someone which direction your headed and stick to it, it's your *** out there."
1110641,joeman79,2009-06-03 12:53:00,417,100 jigs 1/8-3/8 2 dozen bottom bouncers 2 cards of Spinners 6 pike spoons 6 crankbaits 4 stick baits 100 assorted twistertails 4 Bass Spinnerbaits 2 buzzbaits 2 topwater baits 6 steel leaders And you probably won't need half that
1110643,KS TrophyHunter,2009-06-03 13:09:00,10,"I have lightened up this year, going from 4 boxes to 3. Been there too many times and didn't have ""THE"" bait. Now I do. Buy $200 to $300 worth of new stuff every year, just in case."
1110666,Lovetofish,2009-06-03 14:23:00,458,"For walleye I use 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs with a white, yellow, or chatruse twister. Also use a variety of 2' colored spinners with 1/2 or 3/4 oz lindy slip sinker and a snap swivel. Used to use chain sinkers but they cost too much. I tip the twisters and spinners with a salted minnow. For pike I use 2/5 or 3/4 oz Little Cleo spoons on a steel leader. Will catch walleye on this too. My favorite color is gold/orange and blue/silver. I have a whole room full of tackle. The above is all I use these days, and 80% of the time just a jig. Have fun."
1110696,Steve of Madison,2009-06-03 16:12:00,230,"I agree with everything noted so far, so no need for me to add to the load.I took my brother-in-law last year (hope he isn't watching this thread) but he took 3 full tackle boxes, and 5 rods and reels with him, dropped them all in the bottom of the boat and said let's go. 2 days later all of his stuff was left at the dock and we shared my box and rods for the next 6 days. rods and reels....buy good stuff or stay home, you will know the difference between the two by the end of the week.GOOD RAIN GEAR.....it will rain, and if you are wet, you are miserable, that includes the footwear too! If you are willing to spend $100 for a rod, you can spend $200 on rain gear.Learn how to tie good knots, and last but not least...Shut up & Fish!"
1110767,lunker99,2009-06-03 20:33:00,236,"A split shot, gold hook, and a sexy minnow will catch as many fish as anything else up there. Other than that fireball jigs and slip bobbers round out my usual arsenal. A few regular leadheads and twisters if fishing rivers."
1110918,Hayduke,2009-06-04 12:05:00,11,"I have been fishing Ontario for almost 30 yrs since I was 8. my favorites are 1/4 oz jig heads from blakemore lures, their Road Runner Walleye Glow Heads, and I use the crappie thunder bodies. You can mix and match all different colors and bodies with them. Color and depth will vary from lakes, and time of year so you may want som 1/8 or 3/8 oz. I also love little joe spinners at various lengths. When the action is slow the lindy rig setup with a little joe spinner can get you off the bottom and put your bait in front of suspended fish. Colors that have worked for me charteuse, pink, orange, blue and white. You'll have to try a little of everything. I know people who swear by little joes and i almost always use jigs. Tip them all with a piece of a crawler or a minnow and you are set. I am sure there are all other kinds of things that will work but this has always been good for me. Also bring a depth finder/fish finder. You can find a good cheap portable model (read reviews on cabelas and bass pro) if you don't have one. I don't know what I would do without mine. Great way to find structure, throughout the lakes and also has helped me avoid destroying props a few times.Good Luck!"
1110473,adempsey,2009-06-02 23:41:00,963,"Although much has already been covered, this is what I would bring (although, I don't know the lake you're going to first hand).Jigs - round head and stand up types - I prefer Owner, BPS XPS and Fin-Tec knuckle ball - various sizes, will depend on the depth and current etcPlastics - Single tail grubs, I prefer Yum and Gary Yamamoto/Kinami in 3"" and 4"" - typical colors white, pink, black, yellow/chartreuse, natural browns/greensWorm Harness/Mayfly Rigs - basically a hook (or hooks) with some beads and a spinner. I like locally made stuff, but get a few of whats available. I use silver, gold, chartreuse, white spinner blades. Erie deeries are nice too, BPS has an XPS version as well.Weights - bottom bouncers might be good (depends where you are), otherwise some splitshots or some inline weights. You can also use a three way swivel with a ""lindy"" type weight. These go with the harness.That covers 90% of my walleye fishing, but I also use some cranks.Cranks I typically have 1 nature color like silver or shad and one bright color like clown or firetiger. These will work for both species.Stick Bait - Original Rapala, Smithwicks Rattlin' Rogue, Bomber Long ASlash/Jerk Bait - Rapala X-Rap, Rapala Husky Jerk Fat/Shad Bait - Storm Hot'n'Tot, Rapala Shad Rap, Cotton Cordell Big OShallow Crank - Rapala DT series (good on top of submerged weeds)Bucktail Jig - Black, good for working weed edgesTrolling - Rapala Tail Dancer, Reef Runner Deep DiverTopwater - Zara Spook, Heddon TorpedoSpinnerbait - Terminator WhiteSpoon - Eppinger Dardevle (Red/White or 5 of diamonds), Williams WarblerInline Spinner - Mepps Aglia#5 in silverTubes and Tube Jigs - 4"" - 5"" in Earthtone colors, I prefer Mizmo, Yum, Strike Kings brandsTerminal Tackle - leaders, swivels, hooks (with a bobber when you want to be lazy)You won't need it all, but narrow down the type of fishing you think you will be doing. I'd definitely call the lodge owner ahead of time and ask, or maybe it's on his website.For example, for walleye fishing you need very very little gear. Hook/jig and bait (nightcrawler, leech, minnow) will catch you a lot of fish. Pike will go after live bait too of course! So, bare minimum for me would be couple dozen jigs (1/8 to 3/4 oz), some plastic grubs (2-3 bags of Yum), 1-2 X-rap or Husky Jerk, 1 Dardevle, 1 Shad Rap, 1 Spinnerbait and terminal tackle. Keep in mind you will likely lose at least 1 lure. I am fairly confident you will be using live bait most of the time anyway (unless it's not allowed). The cranks etc are just for fun or when you feel like working the shoreline.Good luck!"
1110525,Babamel2,2009-06-03 07:36:00,414,"I have been making my own titanium leaders for years. I get the single strand titanium from Bass pro then I can use the swivels and snaps I like. The dont get twisted. and the price, not counting my time about the same as regular steel and well worth the difference."
1110608,IaDave,2009-06-03 11:33:00,476,"What ever you come up with lay it out and only take about 25% of it(just kidding). First time I went I took too much and have whittled it down now to a 2 sided Plano which weighs about 5#. Jigs,spoons, a few crankbaits. leaders. If there is no weight limit take as much as you want the first trip and keep track of what you actually used. You will be surprised and if you go on future trips you will know what to keep at home. Have fun-miss those days of getting ready for a fly-in."
