So In my situation, I'm staying on the American side and want to cross over to fish in Canada, I need to go to a bait store in Canada( I'm on Rainy) and purchase minnows each day, which is impossible because the closest bait store is 40 miles by water. Am I reading this correctly or is their another solution? Thanks eh"

It bothers me also as one of our ice fishing spots is only a few miles away by snowmobile, but 45 by road. It is purely an economic issue as in our case the minnows usually come from the same body of water but cost 3X as much across the boarder."
