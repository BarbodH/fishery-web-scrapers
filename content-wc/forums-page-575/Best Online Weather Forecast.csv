I look at three different online weahter forecasts and they are all different. Just wondering if anyone trusts a specific service and if so, what is the address? Thanks."
1110084,Glenman12,2009-06-02 06:57:00,762,I use accuweather.com seems to be pretty reliable
1110086,NemegosendaRiver,2009-06-02 07:02:00,66,wunderground.comI use accuweather.com for long range forecasts. I put their widget on a blog I created for our yearly trip. thechutes09.blogspot.com. Just a bunch of B.S. We are all so geographically separated now we have to use the internet to smack talk.
