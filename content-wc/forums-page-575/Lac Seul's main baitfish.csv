1111179,joeman79,2009-06-05 10:39:00,417,Will crawlers and Leeches still work decent in early August? I dread paying 4.65 a dozen for minnows.
1111191,teddi,2009-06-05 11:12:00,349,you could stay at one of the camps that include minnows in their package price. that way cost is not an issue.
1111193,Steve of Madison,2009-06-05 11:12:00,230,"By July and into August crawlers work as well as anything else, I personally prefer them, and a flat will cost you $50. I have decided to forgo leeches this year, at $40-45 a pound they have priced themselves out of my market, and am going to go with gulp leeches (let's see what happens). Our camp provides minnows, and I take along 3"" smelt colored gulp as well.Good fishing"
1110849,tjsker,2009-06-04 07:59:00,301,"What is it, and what does it look like?"
1110863,Larry S,2009-06-04 08:43:00,666,I believe minnows are best bait early in season. Nightcrawlers and leeches for rest of season along with nightcrawlers Is your cousin John Jerina going with you this year to Lac Seul? Also do you have his e-mail address as I have lost it Thanks Larry S
1110888,KS TrophyHunter,2009-06-04 10:17:00,10,"Given the number of fishermen on Seul and the emphasis on catch and release these days, I would have to say the main forage base is commercial minnows!!!"
1110892,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-06-04 10:25:00,138,"LOL, and at $5.00 a dozen there eating better than we do."
1110924,tjsker,2009-06-04 12:39:00,301,"Actually what I'm looking for is size and color of the minnow. There are so many soft plastic baits on the market today, I'd like to go and buy something that closely resembles the real thing in LS."
1110935,Guest,2009-06-04 13:29:00,0,I don't know for sure but I would think probably Cisco.
1111006,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-06-04 18:03:00,100,"The main forage in the early season is insects and larva, which is plentiful and does not require any effort to catch. As the fish forage deeper in later months, the number 1 baitfish of choice is smelt. Yes, the lake is full of them, and even though they are decent table fare as well, the MNR has them protected and illegal to use as baitfish. RIDICULOUS! Smelt run about three to six inches here.Replicate a smelt in August, and you've got a winner....be sure to make it greasy!Although commercial minnows work well, I highly doubt that they are the main baitfish..lol. For the size of this massive reservoir...they're aren't too many anglers at all."
1111014,Guest,2009-06-04 18:46:00,0,Best ask the guides what they find in the walleye stomachs when they clean the fish as they check often. I gather that at certain times the walleye eat crayfish which are plentiful in Lac Seul--we saw tons of remains of crayfish eaten by the gulls on the rocks of Lac Seul last week.
1111019,lunker99,2009-06-04 19:16:00,236,I would guess young perch would be high on the list too.
1111130,jswinter40,2009-06-05 09:02:00,127,"of the 6 years I have fished there (1-2 x year). I have found smelt, cisco, bugs, crawfish, and perch in the stomachs. I am no where's near a guide though, but know people who have going there for 20+ years and they say the same thing. Smelt gulp minnows works decent for me, but still prefer the real minnow (can't get away from it when others in the boat are outfishing me). Personally I like the the early summer when they are starting to like crawlers, that is fun to me."
