1109374,Hayduke,2009-05-30 13:07:00,11,I have a last minute cancellation on a fly-in trip to Northern ON. Trip is planned and deposit is paid. Trip is the first week in August. I've used the outfitter in years past and have 20yrs. experience in this area to compare. This is a very high quality outfitter and incredible walleye fishing. Please let me know if you are interested in more details.
