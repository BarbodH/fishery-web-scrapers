Flour the fillets with your favorite seasonings mixed in, run thru the egg wash, coat with Panko and fry.Also, Shorelunch has an oven bake mix which we tried last week for the first time. It was excellent, nice and crispy and none of the frying oil. Our group of five is all at the age where we're forced to think about what we consume, and we decided to reduce the amount of fried food during the annual Canada trip. Only fried fish one time. Six great evening dinners with fresh walleye done in the oven ..... a different recipe each time. Loved it all."
1109638,Pooch,2009-05-31 19:29:00,4619,"Fish wraps! Guys made fun of me years ago when I brought tortilla shells. Then procedded to eat all of them. Take a look at this picture from a few years ago and tell me that doesn't make you a little hungry. Home grown seet corn, wild rice, a little tarter sauce (sorry Tom) garden lettuce and Canadian walleye on a warmed up shell. Our group leans towards Andy's Red over Zaterans, beer batters and most others. Pan fried using crushed ceriel is also still high on our list, but not as easy as Andy's when there are several hungry guys waiting for fish to come out of the pan. Man. they are all good!

1109659,Eyes_R_Us,2009-05-31 21:16:00,66,"Last year we oven baked some walleye and it was great. We put them in a baking dish lined with aluminum foil, laid a few slices of butter on and around the fillets, and then sprinkled them lightly with Old Bay seasoning. We then covered it with aluminum foil and cooked at 375 until they started to look done. Then another 5 minutes or so with the cover off. You don't need much butter and a heart healthy alternive like canola oil would probably work just as well."
1109803,JayM5209,2009-06-01 11:17:00,1050,"Eyes_R_Us, love walleye done that way. A variation I use is putting some thinly sliced onions under the fish and thin lemon slices on top of the butter pats....plus a touch of dry white wine in the pan before covering with foil. Try it sometime, I think you'd enjoy it as a slight change from your recipre."
1109841,jigman 2003,2009-06-01 13:40:00,981,"Yep, and add a handful of grape tomatoes sliced in half or thirds."
1053632,rpieske,2008-09-06 12:49:00,1276,"Panko is absolutely the best! I dredge the fillets in seasoned flour or a prepared mix like Shorelunch or Zatarains, dip them into an egg wash and then press them into Panko Japanese bread crumbs. I mix some Garlic Herb Seasoning into the Panko. They turn out crisp, not greasy and crunchy. Everyone who has tried the Panko loves it."
1053640,@Lunker,2008-09-06 15:46:00,835,"1) Shorelunch breading mixed half and half with corn meal, which gives it a bit of extra crunch.2) Dip in beaten egg and then shake in a mixture of half seasoned bread crumbs and half grated Parmesan cheese."
1053678,SinOrSwim,2008-09-06 21:00:00,1528,"Hey Morgan.......that sounds excellent. Really, I'm just glad I go with the group I go with as I have a tough time catching fish small enough to eat. But, they have no trouble catching the small ones and sharing with me. LOL"
1053982,rpieske,2008-09-08 12:27:00,1276,I guess we know where they will be putting those small fish from now on. It could be a painful experience.
1053986,Lovetofish,2008-09-08 12:40:00,458,"Cut fish in smaller portions and roll in pancake flour. Season with salt and pepper and fry in butter over medium heat. Don't burn the butter. Add a splash of oil to the butter if you want. The trick is to not get the pan overheated. Turn fish when golden brown. Then when the meat cracks open they're done. I've cooked fish many ways, and I like them all. But this is my favorite. Even better over an open fire."
1054276,King Canada,2008-09-09 20:11:00,27,I like this one too but my secret ingredient is Instant Mashed Potato flakes.
1054299,wvwalleyegal,2008-09-09 22:58:00,7,ooooh the walleye wraps sound great!! if we can catch some more this week we'll have to try that!
1054542,Lovetofish,2008-09-11 09:44:00,458,I'll have to try it.
1055081,lobo1,2008-09-13 22:41:00,734,"I like many of the ones listed in this thread but for about 2 years now I have been using the stuff sold right here on WC ------ Legendary Northwoods Batter. The original walleye recipe to me is the best - has the most flavor - needs nothing....no egg, no salt or pepper - just moist fillets from the final rinse and shake em up. I use an old bread bag and shake em up and into the oil they go.When I have a want for spicy I pat dry the fillets and coat them with Franks, Durkees, or Louisiana hot sauce and then into the dry mix - OMG! mmmmmmI cooked fish for 40 people tonight and they all loved it....even all my Drakes buddies! The ones that have a clue asked me what the coating was and where could they buy it.Ordering more now.lobo1"
1057985,damaskus,2008-09-29 18:58:00,3,"mine's not a batter, it's breading. I mix bread crumbs and lemon pepper shake and bake. Roll the filet in a beer and egg wash, then roll in the breading. Panfry or deepfry at 350 Fyou can also substitute corn flake crumbs if you like."
1053182,SinOrSwim,2008-09-03 20:26:00,1528,"Heading up in a week and thought I'd get some info on different fish batters. We use a product called Seasoned Fish Fri from Zatarains and absolutely love it. But, we are always looking for new things as well. So, please share your shorelunch ideas along with they batter you use with recipe or where to find it.On some of our shore lunches, we filet the walleye and then cut into strips or chunks. We batter the chunks and fry them. We then put those into a flour tortilla with a little tartar sauce (or vinegar) along with some shredded lettuce, tomato, onion and a little hot sauce. IT is mighty tasty. Walleye wrap!Thanks!"
1053191,bob oh,2008-09-03 20:58:00,3936,"If you like Zatarains you should love Andy's Red -- a nice Cajun dry mix, not batter. Just shake your fillets or chunks in Andy's and drop in the oil -- great!!! Don't know where you're at but we get Andy's at grocery stores and WalMart. it is in a plastic bag that is tinted red. Make sure you get the Red, not regular."
1053206,Guest,2008-09-03 23:06:00,0,"here are our favorites 1 -A coating called ""Shorelunch"" is our favorte- can buy at most sport stores like Dicks, Cabelas and Walmart A great recepie- Walleye Parmagan- make the walleye fillets fried with Shorelunch- place cooked fillets in bakepan- cover with a piece of cheese and a spoon of Ragu spaghetti sauce and bake a few minutes till the cheese is melted - our absolute favorite 2. A product from Northwoods called Walleye Mix - nice light taste 3. Gary Roachs fish coating is great also good cooking WG"
1053210,went522,2008-09-04 00:19:00,2474,"Panko. I like all of them from crushed crackers, shore lunch to some different homemade recipes but my fav is panko. They turn out crispy, even the fatest fillets. BIRDDOG"
1053240,ScottL,2008-09-04 07:02:00,733,"I've tried alot of different mixes, but Zatarain's Southern is the best I've ever had. I either dip the raw fillets in milk or an egg before I drop then in the Zatarain's powder. I don't like frying fish with a wet cake like batter."
1053336,hawkeyepierce,2008-09-04 15:31:00,4,I second on this thread Panko Bread crumbsFirst lightly coat with flourSecond dip in a egg wash or milk let excess drainThen coat in the pankoDepp fry or use a skillet with enough oil to come halfway up the filletsand then place on a rack not paper towels so they stay nice and crispyBut they are always gone as soon as i pull them out.
1053365,bob oh,2008-09-04 18:19:00,3936,"Anyone who likes Zatarain's will love Andy's Red, more zing but no overpowering!"
1053376,AllenW,2008-09-04 19:33:00,11482,"Not zingy but good anyway, is 3/4 Fryin Magic 1/4 flour mix, dip fish in egg/milk mix, then fryin magic then place in very hot oil, we get vegetable oil to the point it almost smokes and cook till crispy.If you like a saltier mix, use 100% fryin magicAl"
1053453,Guest,2008-09-05 08:45:00,0,"Hey Sin, we also use the Zatarains seasoned fish fry for shore lunch. We have tried many different kinds and we have used both dry and the wet (beer) batter. When using a wet beer batter, try dredging the filets in flour first to coat them, then into the beer batter. It seems to hold the wet batter better if they have flour on them first. Here's a recipe to try and you will absolutely love. Before you head out to fish, mix up a chipotle tartar sauce by chopping up a chiptle pepper and shallot. Mix 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream together and add the chopped pepper and shallot along with a tbsp of the chipotle sauce from the can of chipotle peppers. Squeeze a little liime juice in and mix. Then at shore lunch mix a packet of taco seasoning in the dry batter and fry the fish in chuncks. We drop tortillas in oil first and make taco shells then add the fish and shredded cabbage and chipotle tartar sauce......excellent baja fish tacos!! Then relax with a Morgan coke or Miller Lite and take a nap on the rocks before the afternoon fishing session. Good luck fishing, we are headed up next week too!"
1053629,Muskygary,2008-09-06 12:00:00,137,"I like Fishing Fever Seasoned all purpose Batter. Get it from Moose Lake Wild Rice Co. Deer River, MN 56636. Made in Minnesota by guide Jason Boser. I live in Indiana and buy it off his website."
