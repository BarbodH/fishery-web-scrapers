1106326,joeman79,2009-05-19 18:00:00,417,Being from Kansas and Traveling to Canada we pass through Omaha. Just wondering from people that go thru Omaha what is the Fastest way to Sioux Lookout? I-29 Via Kenora to Sioux Lookout. Or I-35 Via International Falls Via 502 to Sioux Lookout. Just curious. Joe
1106331,SimilarIsland,2009-05-19 18:14:00,121,"I can tell you from the south side of KC, it takes us 12 hours to get to International Falls on I-35/Hwy 53."
1106431,Babamel2,2009-05-20 06:05:00,414,"I would take I 35. to Near Duluth then 33 to 53, and from Fort Francis go east on 11 to Highway 502. then North. Be sure to have plenty of gas as you leave Fort Francis. there are no filling stations, cafes or buildings along the 502."

1107439,schick,2009-05-23 08:26:00,35,"We have done it many times using 3 different routes and I believe that Omaha to Des Moines and up through Minneapolis is the fastest route. We drive all the way from Omaha leaving at 6:30 AM (will be Sunday) and arrive in Sioux Lookout at 10 PM. I actually like the drive up I29 to Fargo and then east to Detroit Lakes and north up to the border, but the two lane roads do slow you down. The I29 to Winnipeg and to Kenora is the longest route.

1107978,LoDo,2009-05-25 18:33:00,721,Agree with most on this thread. I35 is your best option.
1108036,joeman79,2009-05-26 00:25:00,417,THANKS That's what we will do.
1108171,Steve Ediger,2009-05-26 11:39:00,97,"Hey Joeman,Everone is entitled to their opinion so here is mine. I have left camp near Ear Falls at 5:00 in the morning and pulled into my driveway in Jamestown Kansas at 11:00 PM the same day by going the Ear Falls to Vermillion Bay to Winnepeg to Omaha to York To Concordia. From talking with other people in camp from Omaha and Kansas City, I don't think you can do that by going through International Falls. Just my opinion.By the way, are you still going north this summer? I see you have a big wedding coming up to pay for - ha ha. Just kidding, I saw the announcement in the paper.Good luck - with the wedding and the fishing.Steve"
1108290,joeman79,2009-05-26 18:48:00,417,"Steve How's it goin? Yeah we are going to Lost Island Lodge the first week of August. I paid all the deposits in September for whole group so I would not have to pay any when we get there. Told all the guys to pay me when we get there. 10 guys going so I will have beer money-gas money for the way home. About the wedding, actually 2 of my daughters are getting married this summer!!!!!!!! Of course they each have to have thier own day so one in june and one in sept. So there goes my 2010 Alaska Trip!!!! NAh I am goin anyway. Back to topic. Last year we went to Red Lake Via I-29 Winnipeg-Kenora. I think it took us 15 hrs to get to kenora and i do not know how far it is from there to Sioux Lookout. Maybe we will go up to INt'l Falls and Back the other route and compare. I could go to Canada for many years in a row for what these weddings are gonna cost me. But with 4 girls and living in an Ocean of Estrogen it will be nice to have a couple I might add GREAT Young men around. In Fact one of them is going with our group to Lac Seul. So I am excited for all of them. He is really pumped about going to. He may not want to marry my daughter after the trip lol."
1110871,Guest,2009-06-04 09:04:00,0,What about going to vermillion bay from omaha. Is I-35 still faster than I-29 or does that go too far east for me. Anything to cut the 15 hours down would help.
