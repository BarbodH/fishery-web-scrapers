Has anyone been there this time of year and what can I expect for the walleye, pike and lake trout fishing? The owners seem very nice and so far have been a great help in setting me up. Thanks in advance. Larry"

542344,Guest,2004-08-04 08:40:00,0,"Just returned from Trout Lake on July 30. Fishing was only fair. I attribute this to my lack of knowledge of the lake and the passing of a strong cold front just before we arrived. There is certainly a lot of Walleye here as evidenced by the amount caught the last night we were there by groups of people that have fished here before. My son liked to fish for the numerous pike with surface baits and was satisfied with the numbers he caught. I would have liked to have caught more walleye but the only times we had sucess was at light transition either very early in the morning or at dusk into dark. I also noticed a large mayfly hatch which might have been part of the problem too, since I checked the stomachs of those Walleye we kept and they appeared to be feeding on them. Over all, I liked the facilities and there certainly was a huge body of water to fish. The lake trout were in the main lake and we caught them at 60 to 90 ft on downriggers. Best spoon was a silver and green NK 28 20ft behind the ball. It seemes that the larger trout were at the 90' mark. If anyone is considering going here, I certainly can't say anything bad about the place. Access was good, only 25 miles on the logging road which took about a hour to travel from Belleterre. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Larry P.S. We are strongly considering going back next year, perhaps at a later date, maybe the end of August or Early September."
542356,retire55,2004-08-04 14:01:00,1029,"Hi Larry: Thanks for posting your fishing report. Quite timely for me as I have been doing a little research on Trout Lake and surrounding lakes for a 2005 walleye trip. Since you said we could ask, I have a few questions, please. Did you stay in a cabin on Trout lake? Does Trout Lake get rough? Were the walleye scattered all over Trout Lake or were they in the big bays at the top of the lake? What was the average size walleye caught by yourself and others in camp? What was the average size laker caught? Did you fish any of the other lakes like Winnawiash? If so, how difficult was it to get to them? Did the outfitter provide any information on the fishing in his other lakes? If you used the outfitters boats and motors, how was his equipment? Thanks in advance."
542378,Guest,2004-08-05 13:31:00,0,"I have been fishing Trout Lake since '88 and have had many good trips,many walleye in the 24"" to 28"" range,40"" plus pike and good lake trout,we always stay at the cabin on west bay on trout lake,do not waste your time fishing the main lake for anything but lakers,the walleye will be found in moose bay on the south end of the lake and east bay and west bay on the north end.We also portage onto Winniawiash and have had good pike fishing there,from there you can portage to bay lake which gets very little fishing because of the remoteness.My E-Mail is [email protected] for more info. Brian"
542421,Guest,2004-08-07 10:47:00,0,"Retire55 No problem with the questions. I'll answer as honestly as I can since I know how difficult it is on deciding about going to a new place. We stayed at a cabin near the lodge. These were equipped with hot & cold running water, flush toilets and electricity. We chose these more for having the convenience of talking to the outfitter about fishing rather that the luxury of flush toilets & electricity. We looked at the outpost camps on West Bay and East Bay when we were up in that area exploring and the camp on West Bay (at the entrance) was every bit as nice as ours except it did not have water, flush toilets or electricity. The camp on East Bay was a little rougher but still livable. In general, the camps on the map on the web site that are marked as chalets are the newer ones and the ones marked cabins are the rougher ones. Since we had our own boat equipped with a 50 HP motor, we could make it to any point on the big lake within 1/2 hr so I don't see the need to ""rough it"" for that amount of time. Trout Lake main body can and did get pretty rough at times. It is a huge body of water and with the wind blowing from the South, like it did in our case, we saw waves in the 2' range at times. This made it difficult to troll for lakers since we had the deep channel charted on the GPS and tried to follow a track but were constantly being blown off course. We never felt threatened by the waves since my boat is a 16' deep V and can handle water like that without much trouble. It was just difficult trolling at 2mph with a 10-20 mph cross wind. We felt the walleye were scattered, but when the people that fished there before arrived on Friday, they didn't have any problem picking up limits because they were familiar with the lake. We felt that because the water was so clear (we could clearly see a jig 8' down) we tended to fish the deeper water. Next time, I would fish the bays with the dark tea colored water since this is where we saw some of the regulars fishing. The regulars were not so ready to give up their techniques although we heard some of them talking about trolling a gold Hot N' Tot. The bottom of the lake and bays varies so much, just being off 20 or 30 ft could mean the difference between 12 ft of water and 40 ft of water. Watching the success of the regulars in the filet house the night we were leaving convened me that there are a lot of nice sized walleye there. The average size of the ones we caught was 22"" and we caught 2 or 3 a day. The regulars brought in a lot of nice eaters in the 16"" to 20"" range. The week we were there, we were the only ones on the whole lake so we didn't have the opportunity to confer with others about where they were picking up fish or what program was working for them. We had our best luck running inline planers with chartreuse Rapalas and gold Thin Fins at 5' depth at dawn and dusk into dark. I attribute this to the clarity of the water outside the smaller bays and the fish only rose out of the depths at light transition times. Average laker size was 12 to 15 inches in the 60' depth range and 15 + at the 90' range. We marked fish from 60' down to the bottom, which in some places was as deep as 130'. Again, trying to fish the 60'+ range was challenging since the channel meandered back and forth a bit and we were afraid of hanging-up the ball so we only fished the deep areas we had plotted on the GPS. The main lake is huge and I'm sure you could spend a whole week fishing it for lakers and still not fully have the bottom topography learned. We caught several in the 12-15 range and only one over 15. We didn't measure it but I would guess it to be 18-20. I would have liked to have spent more time looking for trophy lakers, but my son was very impatient. If we were not catching fish trolling (walleye or lakers), he was ready to buzz-up pike in the weed beds. Since he is away at college and this is the only week we really spend together, I tried to make the trip as enjoyable as possible for him. Next year, if we decide to return, it would be nice to buddy him up with someone that has those same interests in mind. It is also nicer to go to these places with several other fishermen since the chances of figuring out the program and the hot spots are greater. Oh well, I guess that's why they call it Fishin' and not Catchin' and over the past several years, I'm learning to place more emphasis on the trip in general rather on the single aspect of numbers of fish caught. We did not go to Winawiash, although we did travel to the portage area and it looked really well thought-out. If you saw the pictures on the web site, it is a tram system and you place your boat onto the dolly, winch it out of the water, and then let it roll down a gentle grade to Winawiash. The outfitter said his lighter boats are well adapted to making the portage, but thought that our boat was too heavy. Going down would be no problem, but getting back up would be a challenge. Maybe if you had 6 people to help push it you could do it, but with only the two of us we chose to stay on the main lake. The outfitter told us that there is a 30' elevation difference between Trout Lake and Winawiash and I would guess the distance to be a couple hundred yards. He did offer to let us use one of his boats for a day to explore, but again we chose to concentrate our efforts on Trout Lake. Perhaps next year we'll take him up on that offer. Noel & Ghyslaine were excellent hosts. They were ready to offer information on where they were catching fish the week before we got there and where we could find the weed beds for pike. Noel told us the first day there that for one reason or another, the fishing slowed down and we were prepared for that. This is our 7th trip to Canada fishing and I liked this place a lot. I felt these were the best accommodations we ever stayed in. This area is truly an exclusive rights territory and Noel told us that the minimum stay is either 3 days or 1 week. You cannot come here and fish for the day then leave. He also explained to us his methods of keeping the territory stocked with walleye fry and his introduction of speckled trout to some of the walk in lakes. He explained that fishing is their bread and butter and if the fishing ever goes to pot, then the business is done, so he seems to be putting forth the effort to maintain his fishery. The condition of the boats and motors at the site seemed to be good. The boats were 16' V Hulls and the motors were either 15 HP Yamaha's or Evinrude/Johnson's. The equipment was used but did not appear to be abused. All of the six groups of people that came in on the Friday we were packing to leave brought their own boats and motors except for one. I like taking my own boat because I like the to have the advantage of my onboard electronics, the use of the electric trolling motor for moving around the weed beds, my downriggers and the use of the 50 HP motor to move from area to area quickly. The only thing that came as a shock to me was the price of gas at the lodge. It was $1.20 per liter, which translated into somewhere around $4.60 per gallon. I spoke to the outfitters about the availability of gas at the site before I went, but failed in inquire as to what the price was. I went with a full tank on the boat, filled two 5 gal cans at Belleterre (at 85.9 / liter) before proceeding to the lodge and still needed 20 gallons there. All in all I consumed about 42 gallons of gas in the boat for the week. I attribute this partly to having a young son who liked to run from place to place at full speed. When I'm with others fishing, we usually troll from location to location and use the big motor for only going back in at the end of the day or to out run a storm. Once I got the price shock for the gas, I told my son that he was limited to only 5 gallons per day and that slowed him down some. Once again, in summary, I thought the facilities were excellent, the price reasonable but the fishing for us was only fair. I'm also beginning to learn that you cannot judge a place by only going there one time. It takes several trips for one to get to know the water, and weather has a lot to do with the bite. As I said previously in this post, the people that came in on the Friday we were packing to leave did very well. It was good to see this as I might have not considered returning had I not seen the catches of walleye brought in that evening. I guess we were ruined the first trip we made to Canada in 1999. We went to the Gouin Reservoir with Caesar's Lodge and stayed at his outpost camp at Super. The very first full day of fishing, my son caught a 44 Northern, which we released, and by the end of the week, we were picking up 40 Walleye per man per day. All in all at the end of the week we caught close to 500 walleye for a six man trip. Had several times when we were bringing in walleye and a pike would grab the walleye and you would catch both. This has never happened since then. It tough when you have a first trip like that. We went back to the Gouin the following year but fished a different location with Caesar's but due to access made by loggers, we saw 14 different boats and found an area where people were launching boats just a couple miles from our Camp. This turned us off the Gouin, since Caesar promotes his trips as exclusive fishing rights and they are not truly that. Thanks for the inquiry and if I can be of any further assistance, feel free to write back. Larry"

562395,beagle22b07,2006-12-21 09:23:00,34,"Doug Never did go back, guess when you experience not so good fishing, your not in a hurry to go back, although, I still feel that their facilities and operation are of the finest I've been to. Maybe it was just a bad week. Drop me an e-mail if I can be of further assistance. Larry"
1104318,southernEyes,2009-05-12 10:09:00,232,Fished the area in July of '08. Me and a buddy caught 425 walleye and 75 pike in 4.5 days of fishing. Each day we quit fishing by noon. We are returning this July.
1109869,bartidge,2009-06-01 15:47:00,12,"SouthernEyes-Just curious... Which lake were you fishing/staying on during your '08 stay at Club Trout Lake... If you were done by noon each day, I would suspect you didn't do any traversing between their lakes on the rail portages???Chris"
