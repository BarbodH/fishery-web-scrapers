Water temp's were COLD, main lake was 42 degrees when we arrived the 23rd and made it up to 48 by the end of the week on the 29th. SLOW retireive was best given the cold water, particularly for pike. Suspending and slower fishing baits worked best. Good success on Minnow Raps, Husky Jerks and X-Raps and of course Jigs and Berkeley GULP-Alive leaches and minnows and live minnows. Biggest walleyes for the group were 27"" with good numbers of 23-24 inch fish and plenty of eaters (under 18""). Biggest pike were in the low 40 inch range and Smallmouth to 19 1/2 inches. Best pike action was in the afternoon in very shallow water (under 5') and pike and smallmouth were relating to shore with good numbers of smallies also around small islands/reefs not far from shore. We got walleyes any place from within 10' of shore to down 30' in current. Pike had mostly spawned but some were still carrying eggs, walleye were still spawning so it impacted our catch rates for bigger fish, lots of 19 inch fish still spewing milt. Smallies fat with eggs so good sizes for the bigger fish. This and next week should be better as water temps get into the 50s so the pike will still be shallow and the walleye's finishing the spawn. Lake levels are high with lots of water moving through the English river system. The falls at White Dog was moving more water than we have seen it a long time as was Caribou Falls so good current from all tributaries coming into the lake. Paul"
