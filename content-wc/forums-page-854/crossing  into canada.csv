Will that present a problem? also, what are some important things to look for in hiring a guide? thanks in advance for any advice."
533477,Trailerguy,2003-07-14 20:09:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]The court should have issued a new birth certificate. It wouldn't have the names whited out. Any customs person worth their salt will raise a [font color=red]BIG[font color=green] red flag.

533528,Guest,2003-07-16 07:29:00,0,"I believe they can require a photo ID (driver's license w/photo is fine) and proof of citizenship. A passport is best but a certified copy (not a photocopy) of your birth certificate will work. The county you were born in will have that, at least in my state. It is far better to have it with you than be turned back at the border."
533902,Guest,2003-07-28 20:37:00,0,i asked the crossing guard this at fort frances on july 19th. he said all they require is a photo id.... and a driver's license is fine. i also carried car insurance and registration which i handed to guard at the border....
