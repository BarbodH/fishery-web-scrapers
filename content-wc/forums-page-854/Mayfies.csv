533813,FishTwentyFourSeven,2003-07-25 13:31:00,38,"Nick, Have been in your situation before, not fun. We have just slowed things down and put the bait right in front of their faces, but that didn't even work a lot of times. I am leaving tomorrow for the English River north of Kenora...where did you guys fish at? Do you think the hatch will effect us. Thanks. Jerry"
533824,Matches,2003-07-25 19:49:00,236,Isn't this a little late for Mayflies to still be hatching???
533825,hoosiercanadian,2003-07-25 20:24:00,104,"Was 27 miles northeast of Red Lake June 27 till July 4th and every evening the mayflies came out of the trees in clouds then fell to the lake, there were a couple of days that I thought the fishing was being affected by the bugs but overall we still did very well, heading back up in a few days, can't wait!"

533839,Guest,2003-07-26 15:20:00,0,"hoosiercanadian,Did'nt see too many mayflies flying around,but on the calmer days they were billions it seemed on top of the water.We pulled crank baits which probably did'nt help us,but the people using live bait was'nt doing much better.Just wonder if the fish eat them because we seen very few come to the top.Greg"
