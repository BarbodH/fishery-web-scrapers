533727,Guest,2003-07-23 00:20:00,0,"these are all great sites and you should be able to find something but. I looked through all the list, and places I know of, were not listed. They told me most lists require an advertising fee to be paid to be included on the list. They said probably the only place that list all the resorts would be the phone directory. Its probably too bad that all resorts cant be listed on something thats readily available. There are probably some real nice places that are being missed. My 2 cents"
533822,Guest,2003-07-25 17:26:00,0,"I am working on such a think right now. It will be located at http://www.kenoraontario.net It will be a complete listing for ALL of North Western Ontario from the Ont/Mb. border to Red Lake etc. Thunder Bay, down to Rainy River. I have been working on this for three months and only 1/3 along the way. I expect it will be completed within the next 4 months if thing go right. The site will also have maps, road maps, street maps of the various communities (if I can find them all) but it will be done. You can bet on it. Anyone by the way who trys this, especially for FREE needs to get a life. I guess I need to get a life. Ron Thompson"
