I want to prove them wrong. Any advice-locations, lures etc anyone can give me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks and tight lines!!"

While Wabaskang has some trout, they are not very plentiful. More are caught by accident in the winter and spring before they go deep than in the summer. Good luck! :)"

There is a deep spot in front of Jim & Julie's camp by the little island, Aerobus bay, and wine lake are the places I know of that have produced some Lakers. Deep, patient, jigging with flashers."
