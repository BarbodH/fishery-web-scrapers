533764,Guest,2003-07-24 05:09:00,0,Would like to take a day trip to Lac Seul in a couple of weeks and wondered if someone could suggest a guide. Thanks
533770,Guest,2003-07-24 07:56:00,0,"Skylane, Be careful when hiring a guide. There are many good ones and a few bad ones. Get them to tell you as much about their services and equipment as possible. Also tell them your needs and expectations. It's like bird dogs - a good one makes for a great day. A bad one makes you want to shoot your hunting buddy. Good Luck Bigfish"
