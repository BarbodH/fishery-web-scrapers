533874,Vitreum,2003-07-28 09:07:00,221,"just got back from near ear falls. clobbered them. didn't fish very hard. tons of fish in the 16""-17"" range. didn't count, but would guess we (my son and i) caught 300 to 350 in about 5 days of fishing in steamboat. tried goose island and the sanctuary. fish were small and slow. got most off of windswept points and bays in 12'-15' close to drop offs into 20' to 25'. probably got about 15-20 slot and above per day (except for 1) topping off with lots of 22""-24"" fish. sadly, no wall hangers. the boy did lose 1 at the boat. all except 4 eaters were released. primarily used 30"" crawler harnesses with #5 and #7 deep-cupped colorados hammered metallics. back trolled bottom bouncers and dragged lindy rigs when conditions permitted. did a little jigging. it really did not seem to matter. put 3 newbies in our group onto walleyes and they likewise put up some good numbers and size. water is still down about 4'-5' and came up a little while we were there. weedbeds are nearly non-existant. tough going for pike fishermen. thanks to all of you guys for all of the great tips i picked up here during the last year."
