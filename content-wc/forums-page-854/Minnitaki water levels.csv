533860,DanL,2003-07-27 21:36:00,262,Has anyone been up to Donnelly's or Pickeral Arm Camps recently. I hear the water levels are low. How are the conditions for launching and docking? I want to be prepared if the docks are not usable. Also we will be on Minnitaki the week of August 9th. Have the walleye locations changed because of the water levels? Thanks

Didn't have any problem launching my boat, just couldn't start it until I used my trolling motor to get into deeper water. Most reefs are marked, if you stay out in the middle of the lake, you'll be fine. Careful when you get close to shore or try to cut in between islands. The cut-thru is deep enough to navigate. Redpine is still the best location for Walleye. I found the biggest ones in about 18-22' of water. If you stay at Pickerel Arm, tell Lee and Larry I said hey. Bo"
