By the way, care to share any of your secret spots. LOL. Also, can you give me some insight on how the fishing program works. To go fishing with one of the staff pros, do you hire them for the day or exactly how does that work. Any advice would be appreciated."

I am easy to find, especially after dinner when I take them for a swim at the docks. We would be happy to make your acquaintance. We will be in cabin 7A. The fishing program is probably the neatest thing around. You can connect with it a couple of ways. First, once you get there, you can talk to Gail (the feminine and very gracious half of the couple that own the camp) and get set up for a day in the boat of an educator. There is no charge for that privilege. It is part of the program. Second, if the educator's boat is already filled, you will have the opportunity to travel (wagon train style) along with the educator in your own (or rented) boat and fish all the same spots they fish that day. You can talk back and forth boat to boat as to what bait they are using, the depths all of you are finding fish at, etc. The camp educators are some of the nicest people I know. They and the camp owners WANT people to have success and a good experience because that is how they build repeat business. Wayne Papp is the permanent camp educator and there are other pros that visit from time to time as educators. Wayne is a gentleman and a good fisherman who has become a friend of mine through his employment at the camp. As far as ""secret spots"" ... heck, I don't have any. At that time of year I scout by using a lake contour map from Fishing HotSpots (or a very accurate navigational map which is sold in camp), a GPS, and my Lowrance locators. I check underwater humps until I find fish and then I fish them. One ""hunts"" walleyes like we hunt Whitetail deer when we use this technique. This works from July through the end of October. But I will share with you all the info I have if you like. If we don't have any boats coming out with us on a given day, you and your daughter would be welcome to come along. But I bet you will get hooked up with the educators and do fine with them. If you do not have a handheld GPS let me suggest that you get one ... a Garmin 12 is only $150 at Gander and will save you a lot of anxiety about getting lost. There are a lot of islands and they all look the same once you get turned around wrong. If you have not done any bottom bouncing ... check out this site:http://www.justfishontario.com/bouncing_a_to_z.htm and it will give you a good introduction to how we fish the humps most of the time. See you in camp."

532405,Guest,2003-06-16 20:28:00,0,"Thanks for the info. Look forward to meeting you, your wife and the labs. I have a yellow lab, but he won't be making the trip. Hugh Albrecht"
