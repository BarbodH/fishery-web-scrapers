The boats are in need of upgrading, but they worked fine and we didn't have any problems. She let us come in early Saturday morning. The boats were ready and the cabin was ready. The only reason I could see not to stay there would be the quality of the boats. You will enjoy your trip."

Kind of sad the lake will be down but from what I've been hearing fishing is still as good as it has ever been. Will be looking for everyone in camp, we will be the red chevy 4-door truck, crestliner boat; stop by and say ####o."

533601,Jesse-WI,2003-07-18 20:10:00,534,I got 54 hits. One group had issues but everything has been mostly positive.
533633,Guest,2003-07-20 08:34:00,0,"j.t., I have stayed there twice and it was fine. Clean cabins and the rates are very fair. We stay in the small cabins without showers so we use the shower house to clean up. Two problems this year. The water was so low that the launch at Goose Bay was not usable. We had to use the public launch at Goldpines. The second was minnows. Goose Bay traps their own minnows and they were having trouble getting the amount they needed. This was back in june and that may have improved by now. We heard with the low water and lack of snow last winter some of the shallow ponds and lakes where they trap froze out so most everyone was having trouble getting enough minnows. I would bring a flat of crawlers if I was going again this summer. Also there is a good bait shop in Ear Falls. Good luck, hope you enjoy Lac Seul as much as I do."
533634,Guest,2003-07-20 09:19:00,0,Headed to Goose Bay next week. Has anyone been up there within the past couple of weeks to know if I can launch my 16 footer without going to Goldpines?
533642,Guest,2003-07-20 16:00:00,0,"I just got back from Goose Bay a week ago. The water was still very low.I launched my boat at the lodge but need a 4wheel drive truck to do it.Any size boat over a standard 16 ft aluminum would be very difficult,better not try it. The drive over to Gold Pines is not that far."
533643,Guest,2003-07-20 16:57:00,0,Lambertson Rock Guy do you work for this lodge or what? You sure defend this lodge.
533655,Ivy,2003-07-21 08:39:00,556,J.T. We did not have a great experience there but there were many guys that had a good experience My opinion is biased and I would leave it at that. Bad things happen to good people. Ivy
