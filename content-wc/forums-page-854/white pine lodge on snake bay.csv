533865,Guest,2003-07-28 00:13:00,0,####o. going up to canada for the second time this year around middle of september. Normally we only go once in June. What do we need to do differently in september than in June besides bring more warm clothes. I think we will be their last customers for the season. Thanks a lot Alan
