We've always wanted to go back to Canada since we both are walleye fishing addicts. We live in Pennsylvania and want to make arrangements for a week next year. I'm looking for a place I can drive to and has the American Plan (wife doesn't want to cook). As I say, we both enjoy walleye fishing, but wouldn't mind taking some time for smallmouth and muskie action. I need references! Websites would be great!! Thanks in advance!!!"
