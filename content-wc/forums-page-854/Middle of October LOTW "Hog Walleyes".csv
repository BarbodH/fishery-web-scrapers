My experience is that for big fish the river will out do the lake 10 fold...But with the large expanse of the lake you would think that there would be many more spawning spots for the ""big"" walleyes to track them to..."
533800,Guest,2003-07-25 07:08:00,0,"They don't all go up the river, Mn DNR estimates that 5% of the Walleye population in the US portion of the lake spawn in the Rainy river. That leaves the other 95% to spawn elsewhere in the lake or ?. I know some go up the Warroad river and other small creeks/ditches that run into Muskeg bay too. There is spectacular fishing on the lake near to, and far from the Rainy river without another boat in sight in October. The rare years you can get on the lake in certain places before the season closes in April can be superb. I've also gotten large fish still full of eggs on May's opening weekend on certain spots on Muskeg bay, and areas around the sand bays on the west side of Big island. The main attraction for the Walleye to the Rainy river in the fall is the Emerald Shiner run. There is usually a torrid bite on the early ice around Pine and 4-mile bay into December, then you usually have to think mainlake reefs and flats when that starts to peter out in early January. Come late ice there are prespawn fish piled in many different locations around the lake, not just around the Rainy river/Pine island area."
533831,Guest,2003-07-25 21:22:00,0,What % I was wondering about was the numbers of big walleyes that follow the bait fish into the river in the middle of october and if it is 5% then you would think that there are areas on the lake at that time that match the river for numbers of quality fish that the river offers at that time of the year.
533835,Guest,2003-07-26 06:55:00,0,Yes there are indeed spots on the lake with big fish in good numbers in the fall. Hardly ever another boat around as all the tourists fish the river.
533837,Guest,2003-07-26 11:26:00,0,We've kept records on fish caught out of Morson on Lake of the Woods for about 15 years and found that the biggest walleyes are caught in July and October.
