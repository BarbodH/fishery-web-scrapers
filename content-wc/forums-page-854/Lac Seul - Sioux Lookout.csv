533350,Guest,2003-07-08 22:06:00,0,"I bet we did cross paths up at Lac Seul Whitetip1. We never did try that small island by Andersons you are talking about. Sounds like a good spot though and I think I know the island you are talking about. We had good luck around Three Sisters Reef also but didn't head down there until the last day of our trip. In reponse to Smallieman 22's post, we didn't really see any good areas for smallies though like the SE section of Lac Seul but 1 guy in our group of 5 did have 1 smallie on until it jumped & spit the hook. Did you see alot of wildlife in the area while fishing? We saw alot more bears and moose this year for some reason. DCC"
533360,whitetip1,2003-07-09 08:18:00,53,"DCC, Saw 1 moose hanging around the island across from Andersons. Couple guys that were with us saw a bull swimming to that same island. Also saw 3 bears walking the beaches. We did not catch any smallies. didn't try to target them either. I've heard that they are more prevelant in Scaler Lake which I beleive was off limits while we were there. The sisters were really putting out the last night we fished. To bad a storm came thru and chased everybody off the lake. Seemed like every evening some strange weather would come thru. That one night it poured rain our rods were buzzing like crazy. My brother inlaw went to set them flat in the boat and got zapped. Never had that happen before. Whitetip1"
533361,Guest,2003-07-09 08:31:00,0,"Did you guys experience that storm the night of July 1? Man, I have never witnessed so much lightning in my life, it was truly amazing. It was so bright at times that I could have read a book in my tent. Some of the thunder felt like the lightning hit right next to our site. It was actually pretty neat to experience it!"
533366,Guest,2003-07-09 11:47:00,0,"Some great Lac Seul fishing reports on http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm Seems like we have one from Chamberlain Narrows, the central section, and the west side. I love Lac Seul. Going up in two weeks, can't wait. Glad the fires are over."
533377,tly,2003-07-09 18:49:00,1900,"What made SCalar off limits? Was it fires or what? We love it there but have never really done much for smallies, just 'eyes & jacks. We are on our way there the 25th so hope we can get in. TLY"
533388,whitetip1,2003-07-10 07:09:00,53,"TLY, We were told it was off limits due to the fire. Anything south and east of Chamberlain was closed. The Ontario Fish & Wildlife were supposedly patrolling that area and enforcing the ban. I would imagine that the low water levels may make it difficult to get in also, not sure since I have never been there myself. Have a great trip! Whitetip1"
533455,Guest,2003-07-14 09:19:00,0,"Hey TLY...good to see you posted. Thanks again for helping me with some fishing tips and hand drawn maps a couple years ago. Went back up this spring and did really well. Lots of fish. We didn't even try going into Scaler because of the water level. We were there the week of May 26. However, we really didn't need to go very far from the outpost cabin as fish were everywhere. Let me know how you do. My email: [email protected] eyesnatcher"
533898,Guest,2003-07-28 18:14:00,0,"Wooglin, Just wanted to say Thanks for the information. We fished about 10' at about 2.5mph, crank baits. Lots of 22"" fish a couple of 26"" and two 28"" Walleyes. N Pike 32, 36 and 38""."
533905,Guest,2003-07-28 21:13:00,0,"No problem, glad I could help out. I absolutley loved fishing up there, had some walleye for dinner tonight as a matter of fact. Anyway, I will always try to help guys out so they can have as good of, if not better, time than I had. Keep on fishin'. >Wooglin, >Just wanted to say Thanks for the information.

533299,whitetip1,2003-07-07 15:09:00,53,"Wooglin, We were farther north on Lac Seul than where you stayed. Chamberlain Narrows is a 40 mile boat ride from Sioux Lookout. Whitetip1"
533311,Guest,2003-07-08 07:41:00,0,Jiggin Machine- where did the big muskie hit? I'm heading up there July 10 for 10 days . I'm very familiar with the entire east side of the lake- Any landmarks you could associate will give me a general idea. thanks! JBP
533319,jimvh,2003-07-08 09:16:00,1,How deep were you fishing? How fast were you trolling?
533322,Guest,2003-07-08 10:43:00,0,"Don't know if you are talking to me, but here goes. I was fishing mainly 10-15 feet of water for walleye, although we did pick up some big ones in only 7 feet of water, and then again we did pick some big ones up in 15-20 feet of water. I don't know the trolling speed, but maybe this will help: I had a 25 hp motor and we were going as slow as it would allow us. My friends boat did have a trolling motor, and they could go a little slower than us, and they did have better luck. Put it this way, if you can troll slow enough just to get your bottom bouncer/sinker to drag on the bottom, you'll do fine. Best of luck!"
533323,whitetip1,2003-07-08 10:48:00,53,"The group I was with trolled bottom bouncers with spinners and Berkley Power Worms. Did not use any live bait. We also jigged with twister tails and power minnows. We trolled slow enough to keep in contact with the bottom but fast enough to move the spinner. Depths ranged from 6-30"" with no depth being better for size. We also caught some fish on crankbaits. The fishing up there is easy, just look for wind and points and you will catch fish. Some areas hold more but most areas hold some. Keep experimenting you'll find'em. Whitetip1"

533328,Guest,2003-07-08 12:22:00,0,"Hey Whitetip1. Sounds like your group was up in the Chamberlain Narrows area the same time our group was and had similar results. We returned from Lac Seul Outposts on 07-02-03. It was our first time on the NE portion of Lac Seul and we did fairly well. We didn't catch any huge walleyes as our biggest was 26 1/2 inches caught on last day and we had 2 other fish just over 25 inches. Like everyone, we caught a ton of fish & estimated that we had about 40-50 walleyes for the trip that were 21 inches or over. We primarily jig fished in 14' - 22' of water but caught some walleyes as deep as 30 feet. What areas do you fish in this part of the lake? We fished some in Wapesi Bay and also before you get to Bear Narrows area with good success. DCC"
533339,whitetip1,2003-07-08 15:29:00,53,"DCC, We must have crossed paths. We came out on the 3rd. We fished fairly close to the narrows mostly. We caught a ton off the little island on the right after you go by Andersons. I also caught my Muskie in the same area. We caught our biggest just around the corner from the resort. We also caught fish around the 3 sisters. Whitetip1"
533340,Guest,2003-07-08 15:35:00,0,Did you get into any smallies? Is it true smallies really only run in the SE portion of Lac Seul- if so I guess you guys were to far north. Sorry if that is incorrect thinking- never been there but I keep dreaming that one day I will get up there. Also if weather turns bad are you stuck since the lake is so big or are there enough secluded coves to fish with some effectiveness? Thanks
533342,Guest,2003-07-08 16:09:00,0,I'd like to see a pic of that too. [email protected].
533205,Guest,2003-07-03 12:42:00,0,Does anyone have any news on Walleye fishing on Lac Seul ?
533214,Guest,2003-07-03 21:09:00,0,"Just got back 3 hours ago, we fished mainly the Lac Seul straights, in the Webster area on Lost Lake (connected to Lac Seul). Fishing was amazing, there wasn't a day we didn't max out. Biggest walleye we boated was a 9 lb. - 26 inches. Got a 25.5 inch, and several between 22 inches and 25 inches. Cannot beat the fishing. Use lindy rigs and worms trolling, with bottom bouncers or Little Joe sinkers to get them to the bottom. Gold and coppers dimpled spinners seemed to work the best. Watch out for moose on the drive in...."
533250,aaron,2003-07-06 18:42:00,6,"A 9lb,26inch walleye?Maybe in the fall on steriods!Quit lying."
533260,Guest,2003-07-06 21:08:00,0,"Drop me your e-mail address, I will send you a picture. I took over 150 pictures on the trip....ah, the life of the digital age. >A 9lb,26inch walleye?Maybe in the fall on steriods!Quit >lying."
533264,Guest,2003-07-07 05:54:00,0,"I believe the guy, having fished Lac Suel. Last year we caught a 36 inch Northern that was as fat as a Walleye. Not wanting to be called a liar this early in the AM I will leave the weight off."
533265,Vitreum,2003-07-07 06:36:00,221,"wooglin, thanks for the report. although the average 26"" walleye will weigh about 6.5 pounds, i've seen some really fat footballs. i've also seen some skinny as a rail. glad you had a great time."
533268,Guest,2003-07-07 08:22:00,0,"Yeah, I kinda figured that not a lot of people would believe that. We also had a 25.5 incher that went 7 lbs. It was pretty cool to stack up that days worth of fish for pictures, and see walleyes that made our northern look small. The belly on the big one hung low....real low. Makes you wonder, what the size of the REAL lunkers are? I'd bet there are some 32-33 inchers out there...."
533273,whitetip1,2003-07-07 09:57:00,53,"I retuned on the 3rd. Fished the Chamberlain Narrows area. Caught lots of numbers but the largest was only 25"". From all the people I talked to that was the norm. Couldn't find the big girls. Our group of 4 did catch 3 Muskies with the largest being 44"". Whitetip1"
533276,Guest,2003-07-07 10:19:00,0,"Yo Whitetip, where did you catch those Musky at? I did have one follow my lure up to the boat while smallie fishing, freaked the crap out of me. I have never seen a muskie in the water before....it was quite the site. That was on Big Vermillion."
533288,Guest,2003-07-07 12:26:00,0,"We fished Chamberlain Narrows June 8th-12th and had a muskie hit a 26"" walleye at the boat. I didn't personally see it but my brother estimated it about 60"". He said it was awesome."
