533720,Cooker,2003-07-22 20:29:00,164,"I was amazed at the rude behavior we experienced at LOTW last week. I could not count the number of times that we were barged in on while fishing. Between the boats that roared around the corner, saw our two boats sitting on a reef and decided that that must be the place to fish and the ""fisherman"" that used their Bushnell fishfinder to determine the fish were biting where we were, it was unbelievable. It was not like we were fishing reefs that were several acres in size. Most of the time we were fishing 1/4 to 1/2 acre reefs. We almost felt like we should ask them if they minded that we pulled in our bouys or if they wanted to toss one in before we pulled ours. In years past we have never had this happen. In fact there were several occasions in the past where people would hang out in open water and wait until we left before moving on the reef. In another occurance, I had just gone thru a narrow cut, accelerated to about 45 and had some ""expletive deletive"" pass me less than 50 feet off my port side and cut accross my bow about 75 feet in front. I found out later that he had also cut off our second boat going into the cut. Just so it is clear, I am from the States and most if not all of the other boats in question were also from the States (I did not get a good look at some of them). The last I checked LOTW has 951,337 surface acres, 14,500 islands and 65,000 miles of shoreline. I just don't get it. For a while, I thought I was fishing in Iowa. Maybe it was because of the low water and that there was probably only 940,000 surface acres left."
533724,chrism,2003-07-22 22:09:00,429,"Yes it is frustrating... I had two occasions during my vacation where I was being watched and had two boats pull up so close I could almost pee on them - one guy had binocs around his neck, and I didn't even give them a look until he had the gall to ask how the fishing was...I politely flipped him a middle finger salut to which he responded by leaving. The other boat was rather rude with their threatening remarks, so I took a movie pic with voice on the digital camera and told them I'll play it to the CO's tonight - they promptly left too. The lake I was on is about 3x the size of milllacs(spelling?) and that day I only saw 8 boats. Fish are found all over, they are not ""just in one spot"" You would think that people would be able to or at least want to learn how to catch fish on their own, but I guess it is not the case. I was rather frustrated with this whole thing, and the campfire talk that evening with some new friends from Minnesota (you there Jeff?) said that it wasn't uncommon on the busier lakes... All I can say is why not be courteous and hire a guide for a few hours to show you what works so that you can go enjoy the peace that the north has to offer without disturbing someone else's day. I do like fishing with just those in my boat, and also with friends if they join us in their boat - but barging in on someone elses party is not a cool thing to do at all. Just my opinion! Chris"
533742,Stevie B,2003-07-23 10:16:00,157,"Chrism, Good to see you back in the real world again! How was the trip? Now that you are back I got another Winnipeg river question for you. Have you ever been on George Lake? I got a couple of boats reserved for the sept. weekend and was going to head that way for some laker's. Any thought on that water? Hope I don't get crowded out there?!?! Fish ON!!"
533745,chrism,2003-07-23 12:50:00,429,Hey man Never been there - I'm still addicted to Walleye fishing! Chris
533749,Northern Manitoban,2003-07-23 14:52:00,195,"Good story Chrism lol.I went through the same thing in June on my 5 day trip for waleyes and lake trout.My partner and i fished outside a bay there were around 7 other boats there nobody was close,we didn't have much luck same as the others.We moved down to another location from that bay probabaly about a 1/4 mile away a good distance from the other boats we were the only ones there for about a hour we started catching fish like crazy next thing you know all these boats came to us one boat was so close i could have like chrism said pissed in it.Casting there lines behind my boat,i told them your going to tangle our lines.I also said loud enough to my partner ""i guess this lake isn't big enough"" they didn't get the hint so i started casting my line towards them with my fireline hopeing to snag there cheep mono lines they were probably using.2 more boats came close to us but mainly this one boat with 2 older fellows and one teen.Father and grandpa teaching there family member there great ways! what a joke! all these rude people were all from the states,i don't know if thats how they fish where they come from?but it was just unbelievable.Some people are just plain stupid when it comes to being curtious on the water.Use your heads guys! NM"
533751,IaCraig,2003-07-23 15:40:00,434,"I ditto your feelings. However the more I fish for walleye's the more I've become used to it and it bothers me less, but I still do not do it to others. The memories this topic brings back. 1. I've had boats accidently drift over my buoy and drag it off the reef. 2. I've had other boats hook my buoy line and think they have a fish on. (that is always fun to watch) 3. I've been the 1st on a reef and had a boat zoom up and throw their buoy right next to mine and maneuver their boat blocking me out from getting close to my buoy. (apparently I intruded on yesterday's hot spot) 4. I've had people stop right next to my buoy, drop anchor and slip bobber fish. 5. Lots of times I've had boats zoom in at WOT, stop to mark the reef on their GPS and take back off at WOT. (that ticks me off) 6. One day I even had a boat I didn't know follow me to 3 or 4 different mid-lake reefs, which didn't bother me much because the guy's wife/girlfriend was a babe wearing a swim suit 2 sizes too small. (I hadn't seen my wife for a week so maybe she just seemed like a babe.) I still like to use buoy markers, but when I don't want to attract other boats I'll try to just keep an eye on my GPS and the depth finder. IaCraig"
533754,Reels,2003-07-23 16:29:00,2876,"Try a black marker. You can see it close by, not not to easy to see more than 25 yards. It does seem to more and more of a problem every year. <{{}}><"
533755,Guest,2003-07-23 16:58:00,0,"one more for the books, my buddy and me marked a reef last week on dogtooth, it was not very big and we were doing fairly well just circling it, after our third walleye a boat that had been fishing a shoreline motored up to our buoy dropped a line and caught a 29 incher, i asked him to thank me for marking his fish but got no reply. very frustrating to miss a chance at a fish like that. although i have never moved in on another's marked spot i spotted the same boat fishing a marker a few days later and returned the favor(except for the 29 incher)he pulled his marker and left."
533782,b8y,2003-07-24 11:29:00,7,"it is just a matter of common courtesy, something that seems to be lacking today. While up at Eaglenest this year a guide pulled his boat into the same small bay we were fishing in. His clients caught fish, but at what cost? We merely moved further away from them. If he had run into mechanical problems, I would of had to think twice before helping him. It doesn't seem to matter how remote or concentrated you are. Ignorant people are just that. This year fishing the red river of the north from shore, a crestliner from minnesota anchored dead center in front of us, well within easy casting distance. They then had the nerve to get upset when our casts landed about 5 feet behind their motor. It would have been very easy to put it right into their boat with them. We were just not as ignorant as they were. It is just how things are, no matter where you go. No point getting p***ed about it, it will not change anything. Yelling or complaining to the offenders does nothing to change their attitudes. I do however find it amusing when my kids yell, hey thats my fish."
533817,Guest,2003-07-25 15:40:00,0,Don't put out a marker and don't use the landing net.
533820,Guest,2003-07-25 17:18:00,0,"That is nothing new to me for LOTW. I ""Guided"" on this lake for years and it has been happening for years. Primarily two or three resorts. What I used to do was pull out my Muskie Rod, put on a good siae lure, and stay tossing it towards the boat. ""The next one is planted in your forehead"". As you so rightly claim LOTW IS a good size. If you have to hog someone else's spot then go fish in another country. The ones that I find do this the most are as I say a few resorts, and many of the locals who have no regards for anything anyway. Even some of the resorts themselves ""think"" they own certain sections of the lake. When boats go by into a certain narrows area on the western peninsula the camp their gets totally annoyed. NO ONE person owns any part of LOTW. I will fish anywhere, at anytime I wish. However being a guide I will never move in on someone Ron Thompson"
533827,hoosiercanadian,2003-07-25 20:41:00,104,"Time to head to the bush! thats too many people for me, I go to Canada to get away, I don't want to see a bunch of boats swarming around me! Fished Lake of The Woods once, I thought there were too many cottages and resorts , I don't even want to see bouys, would rather fish a unmarked no name less traveled body of water. just my opinion."
533838,Guest,2003-07-26 11:34:00,0,"Remote or hard to get to lakes are nice. Without a vehicle I am stuck with LOTW. You are correct about the cabins too, however it is my experience that most of them do not fish, or at least not that often. I have found as I say a few resorts that move in on people, and the local residents are the worst not only for moving in, but going out day after day after day. You can bet that in their freezers they would be considered over-limit. (Not the resorts. Most are good at staying within the laws) I have seen gutted under-size muskie's, large northern, large walleye etc. all kept when in essence they should have been put back just due to their size. Like who on earth would want to keep a walleye of 8lbs. or a pike over 8lbs. to eat. Not this guy. I keep enough for my dinner and that is it. I am not interested in stocking up. Lake of the Woods over the past few years since the resorts and other anglers have gone catch and release has improved 100% in my estimation. Which is certainly nice to see."
533845,Dand,2003-07-26 20:51:00,2,"What is everyone complaining about, fishing for a lot of us is not a job but a time to relax. So take a few min. when a stranger pulls up and talk to him, you may find out that they have some good info for you. If after a few words you still think they are a dink ask them to move, at least you tried to be a ""Sports Man (person)"" about it and broke the ice. If that does not work pull up, power up and do a few laps around them before you leave. The next time they spot you they will stay away. Later. Dan."
533849,Guest,2003-07-27 08:17:00,0,"I just got back from Manaki also a lot of water up there,I like everybody else pretty much know where the hot spots are. We got moved in on three times one day if you are going to fish these places that are marked on every map handed out by every resort in the area it's going to happen... it's not private property out there just pick up your marker and move on to the next place and don't let these inconsiderates ruin your trip Fish On....."
533786,Guest,2003-07-24 14:31:00,0,"LOL! I had #4 done to me in a tourney at Dieffenbaker Lake, Sask. about 12 years ago. I kept my cool and actually I ended up becoming pretty good friends with the offending party. He is a riot of laughs and I am glad I got to know him. I have even managed to get him trained ....sort of...on some fishing/ boating etiquette... kinda... For example; He doesn't pee over the side in front of women anymore. (He pees over the OTHER side, now). :)"
