559687,Guest,2006-07-24 00:34:00,0,"First of all, you don't need a stove unless you're on a fire ban. Cooking over an open fire is always better. Forks, spoons Long, steel utensils: fork, spatula, solid spoon, slotted spoon Paper plates Garbage bag Can opener Scrubby pad Tin Foil Spices/Seasonings: salt, pepper Lowry's Seasoning Salt Montreal Steak Spice Lemon Pepper Lemon juice Dessert: cookies canned fruit oil margarine Depending on meal: canned mushrooms onions tomatoes side dish: wild rice or potatoes (need teriyaki sauce if it's the wild rice) canned baked beans Then you obviously need a tater pan, frying pan or skillet, bean pot (optional), and grates.

We used to bring one, but forgot the pump for the burner this year, and we were forced to cook over open fire-it worked great, and we'll never bring the stove again. As for us, we don't do a big hoop-la for shore lunch. We have huge dinners, so lunch is just basically fish. Box of batter (Shore Lunch brand) 2.5 gallon bag to mix batter/fish oil pan and tongs fillet knives wood cutting boards Serve battered fish on cleaned cutting boards, eat, go fishing."

Wooden box or duffel would work too. Be sure everything is cooled off before putting the dishes etc. away. Stove is nice if a dry year and there is threat of fire."
559700,Guest,2006-07-24 11:45:00,0,I would add three things: 1. Oven mitts 2. A small container of Coleman fuel to get the fire started. You can buy a bottle designed to hold fuel at any camping store. 3. Burlap sacks to wrap the grate and frying pan in so they don't dirty everything else up when not in use.
559702,Guest,2006-07-24 12:08:00,0,"We also use a plastic containers for our kit. We use a lodge cast iron pan for our fish frying pan. We use a process of three steps for coating our fish. Step one, coat fish in pancake mix Step two, drag fish in eggs, small palstic bowl works best, Step three coat with bread crumbs. Cook and enjoy We also take a grate alongs and hot leather gloves to handle the pan."
