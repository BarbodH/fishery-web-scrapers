559189,zack,2006-07-10 05:38:00,38,I am leaving for Lac Seul in two days. We will be leaving from Hudson. What do I need to not forget? What will the Walleye be feeding on and what fishing methods would you recommend? I can use all the help anyone can offer. I need to put the wife on fish so that I may be able to come back next year. zack
559192,scar,2006-07-10 08:04:00,196,"zack, don't even fool around in the hudson area. have the outfittergive you a good map and head towards the bear narrows and chamberlin narrows area. in a house boat it will take over two hours to get there but once there you will find some of the best walleye fishing there is on this section of lac seul. when i was there june 16 - 22 we did see several house boats in this area. scar"

559240,Hammer_74,2006-07-10 20:03:00,18,"Hello Zack, I have experienced the house boating trip on lac seul and it was fantastic. You will want to buy yourself a good lake map. They have one on the boat but it is attached to the wall so you can't take it with you on the tow along boat(for fishing). The most desireable spot is taylor island for parking the houseboat(wicked beach, Bananna island is beautiful as well but it is infested with army ants)and from there you can take your boat to different spots. The points off of the two small island south of tayor island have been productive(southern point of the bigger one best), around Ogaman light and adjacent point, Maclean Narrows, and Pauls Light. If you buy a good lake map these spots will be marked on them. Just remember that nobody can drink alcoholic beverages while the house boat is in motion which we found out after the fact without incident."
559667,zack,2006-07-23 11:44:00,38,Thanks for the advice. We just returned from our trip yesterday and had the experience of a lifetime. Walleyes everywhere. Shallow weeds on jig and plastic. Rigging along weed lines and deep 25-30 feet rigging. I saw fish by the dozens on the Aquaview. What a trip. Zack
559672,scar,2006-07-23 16:49:00,196,"zack, what areas did you end up fishing? scar"
559677,tly,2006-07-23 20:28:00,1900,"Scar, I assume you were the guys with the decked out Lund we commented on at the island north of Bear Narrows. We were the Tracker drifting the point. You beached for shore lunch, we went to xmas tree island. You had commented things had really slowed down at Minaqua but some guys were up there last week even in the heat and did real well. Not sure what lakes. Our week coincided with yours at Lac Seul but things did not change much from when we talked. Lots of fish but no size. We used primarily salted minnows or artificials TLY"
559726,zack,2006-07-24 18:48:00,38,North of Deception Point to the monument. About a 2.5 hr ride in the houseboat. Not a large area but lots of options without having to travel far in the fishing boats each day. Wife and I caught 161 for the week. It took us a couple of days to figure out what the fish were doing in relation to the wind and weather but all in all a wonderful time. zack
