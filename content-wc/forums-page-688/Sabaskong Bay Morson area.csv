559680,Guest,2006-07-23 21:44:00,0,Am going to Morson area July 28 LOTW. Any suggestions or tips for walleyes? Also is it too early for crappies?
559686,Guest,2006-07-23 22:49:00,0,"We arrive July 28 for nine days. I hear the larger walleye have been on the shallow rock piles, 8-12' or a little deeper, biting on 1/2 oz. jigs with a stinger and minnows or crawlers. Where are you staying?"
559693,Guest,2006-07-24 08:51:00,0,"WE are staying at Buena Vista Resort at Morson, Ontario. This is the first time we have been on LOTW. Have gone to Gull Rock for 20 plus years. Trying a different spot. Thanks for any help."
559694,Guest,2006-07-24 09:06:00,0,Rick Gates knows where the walleye are. Check with him. Get the Canadian map #6214 and follow it. Water is low this year. I'm running a Crestliner 192 with 200 Merc and a white dog in the bow. Stop by if you see us.
