559182,guidedfishing,2006-07-09 19:24:00,531,"I've already been in to LOB's twice this year, and several time last year through the fall, The trail in has not gotten any better, I did spend several hours one afternoon last fall filling in a hole so that I could get in. It seemed to help that particular spot, but it would require a full scale road crew to put a dent in it. I did get stuck coming out last fall, 4 wheel drive and low range, but did not have the same problem last week despite it raining every day. It could still use more rain as the water level is down and the the causeway is a littel treacherous right now. Did well and eyes biggest was 24ins, Lake Trout were so so but did manage 6, 3 weeks ago but last week I had a tough time getting a bite. The smoke from the Forest fires was pretty heavy last week when the wind was from the west north west. I would say fishing has not been as good as last year, although that was pretty good. The bugs have been pretty bad, which is driving the bears and moose a little nuts. Try and camp one of the paper company or queens land islands if you don't want to have visitors if you know what I mean. Not sure how big your boat is but I only went through at the cause way once last week because of tough conditions but my boat is alittle bigger than most, have your spare prop ready, I was able to clean mine up with a file pretty good so no major dings, or aluminum removal... Any specifics let me know. and good luck. oh yeah, did I mention the road is and will likely remain a mess... goodluck GF"
559188,Guest,2006-07-09 22:45:00,0,guidedfishing thanks fot the reply. Thats all i needed to know. We stay at Silver Dollar and drive in for one or two days. Just wanted to check if it finally got impassable. I`m not too sure how a guy could turn around or meet another rig on that trail. You mentioned fires up there. Is there a burn ban on now.
559231,guidedfishing,2006-07-10 17:04:00,531,"No fires close by they are all far off to the west, I don't believe there is any danger in the Silver Dollar area at this time. There is a few small places where someone can pull off, and have had to do that before, there is a few areas that there would just be no easy way to back out off. Do you fish the north end or the south end most of the time. If you would like to share some info feel free to email me. take care GF."
559635,Guest,2006-07-22 10:07:00,0,Just returned thursday night from Silver Dollar. We fished lake of bays one day. The water was lower than anytime i`ve been there. The road in was`nt any worse than last year. Fishing was good but not as good as last year.My boat went to the south end of the lake to check it out. We ended up playing with the northerns most of the time. No big ones but still lots of fun.The other days we fished jutten and corsica lake. We did well on those too.
