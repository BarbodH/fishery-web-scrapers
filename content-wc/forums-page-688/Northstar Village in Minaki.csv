I am always a little nervous about a fishing camp that calls itself a ""village"" If anyone has fished there or is familiar with it, please give me the ""scoop"". We generally fish walleyes and have heard that the area around there is pretty good on the Winnepeg river. Any comments would be appreciated."

If you plan to bring fish home, check the regs because in that area the slot for walleyes is pretty tight the limits are less than much of Ontario. (they are trying to rebuild the resource). As far as Muskeys go, the fishing for them seems to get better and better. Also some people think it is a great system for smallies. On Northstar Village. I have stayed there for the last 5+ years. Marcy and Mike are very nice, and actually live in Minaki year round. Marcy's dad used to run NorthStar, then Marcy & Mike took it over a couple years ago and have made lots of improvements. I'm not sure why it is called a village, maybe its because they used to cater several RV's that parked there during the summer, but not anymore. They don't have very many cabins but they have good docks, good selection of bait and fuel. (bring your own extension cords). I think most their guests bring their own boats, but I imagine they may have rentals available. Like everything in Minaki, it is close to the RR tracks so for the first couple nights you will hear train whistles at night. Depending how many are in your group, I'd recommend cabin #4. Marcy & Mike are good people, and a big part of the reason I continue to go there even after the fishing has declined. Don't get me wrong, I know the system pretty good and I can almost always catch walleyes even when cold fronts move in, but unless conditions are perfect don't expect real fast action. If you go later in the summer, Big Sand is usually where most the eyes are caught. IaCraig"

The two things that would prevent me from staying there would be the rail road tracks and being right in the main channel of the river. The current is very swift and any boat traffic going north drives right past it. I personally stay at Barbers Resort in Minaki and this year was my 20th year fishing the river. Peter Barber grew up in Minaki and lives there year round. Nice cabins with Cable, a jacuzzi on the camp and every cabin is spaced out so you feel you are by yourself and you get a great view of the water along with a private dock. Price is very reasonable too. Just another option if your shopping. Fishing is still good although like others said the walleye are not what it use to be and if that is what you are mainly after, you can do better. Great Muskie, Pike and Smallmouth fishing. <{{}}><"

We have never went North to Gunn, Big Sand, and pistol until last year. My question sounds like the place to go for Walleye, I also catch a good number of Musky/ pike up there as well. Given the large size of Big Sand I was wondering if you could give me some tips on where to go on Big Sand. It's very deep in spots, and I have only fished the lower east part mainly for musky. We can't Walleye South of Minaki so we want to hit Big Sand but we have no real idea on where to start. I would think trolloing tail dancers and such is a good idea? Any help would be great. My email address is [email protected]. Thanks so much for your help. Your right that Walleye has decreased but I have seen a huge increase in large pike and Musky in recent years. I will gladly trade what I know as well for your valuable inforation."
