559466,phishfearme,2006-07-17 15:47:00,1242,"my group of 4 just returned from our second 10 day ""week"" at bow lake (about a 6 minute flight north of pickle lake) with albany river outfitters. we've been going to different fly-in outpost cabins for about 20 years now and this is our first repeat trip - it's just too good of a deal ($725 for first 5 days and $25 a day after that - $850 for 10 days) with a very nice cabin and the fishing was still up to our expectations although different - mostly because of the higher water although it still was abit low. during our previous trip (see: https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...6951&mode=full ) we caught quite a few very large eyes, this trip we ""only"" got 2-24"" and 6-23"" and very good numbers of quality fish. the pike fishing was a good bit better with 34"" and 3-31"" being the best but this still should not to be considered a pike lake. jerrel had a 4HP motor waiting for us at the top of the otoskwin river rapids and we did three, two man trips up to the otoskwin and dobie rivers and froats lake. we didn't do as well as we did in our previous trip three years ago up the portage but that's all relative - my buddy and i caught 128 in one of our days there which is still very good but during the previous trip it was simply incredible. it's worth the effort to portage. it appears that jerrel and sharon may be considering retirement as our hosts for the trip were dwight and karen monk who are considering buyng the business if jerrel and sharon sell. dwight was excellent bringing us ice and water frequently and anything else we needed. dwight is also the local OPP chief and is well known all over ""town"". they have some really good plans for the outposts should they buyin (like screened porches and cleaning stations as well as a working oven in bow - it's still broke) and as long as they keep the price reasonable this will continue to be one of the best deals in fly-in fishing. any questions - feel free to ask. phish"
