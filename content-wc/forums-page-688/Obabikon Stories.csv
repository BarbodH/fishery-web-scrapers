Back in '03 when the water was so low, my wife and I in a camp boat came to the entrance and saw two guys on shore, each with a rope tied to their boat trying to get out of OB. There was a strong current going into OB and we watched for about five minutes as they struggled to pull their boat through. After they were out of the way, I motored up, lifted the motor, and the guys said ""watch out for rocks."" My wife and I stood up, each with a paddle to push off rocks, and the current going in was so strong we shot right through the entrance like a Pirates of the Carribean ride. The guys just watched in amazement. Still laugh about that. In Oct. about two years ago, I was motoring in backwards when my dog Stella jumped out onto the big boulder on the left. We kept going of course and the poor little white dog had to jump in and swim to catch up to us and get hauled into the boat. The water temp was in the low 50s and Stella spent the next half hour shivering and trying to warm up. She hasn't pulled that stunt again. I've heard other stories about guys falling in at the entrance and other funny anecdotes. Anyone else have a good OB story?"

I had been in the lake once before, but that was long before,in about 1964, when I motored down from the camp we were staying at, located at Turtle Portage. Anyway, this was in late September. We put in from Mylie's, paid the fellow who ran it at that time to carry over a large boat load full of camping gear, we had 2 boats with 2 guys each, and away we went. We found a small, beautiful island to camp on. The weather that day was great, very little wind, dry and warm for late Sep. We pitched tent that day, and then for the next 4 days, it rained and blew almost continuously. Cold! Crappie fishing, however, was phenomenal. The game warden paid us a visit on the island the first full day we were there, greeted us, and asked to look at our ice box (we were legal), and curtly said ""I'll be baaaccck"". We never did see him again tho. The really funny, weird thing about the trip was, that for the first 4 days, after returning from fishing at the Elbow, WE COULDN'T FIND OUR ISLAND. Maybe the continual rain/nw wind had something to do with it, maybe we just weren't very good finders. The 4th day, the guys in the other boat got to camp before us, in between rain gusts, and then watched us floundering in the lake, looking for camp. Twice we started towards it, just to go the wrong way around the island(s). The guy in my boat, who was driving, sort of, had his hat blow off, and we did manage to dipnet it up before it sank - a major accomplishment in the wind, waves, and rain. The rain came down so hard, eyeglasses would have had to have had wipers for one to be able to see! We finally made it to camp, and realized the guys on shore had been watching the whole sorry experience. They had quite a laugh on us, as at one point, we were maybe only a block from camp and did not realize it. We eventually learned to head towards where the camp shouldn't be, and there it was! That night, we again cooked and ate outside in the rain and wind. We decided to take shelter in the tent. After several drinks of heavily flavored sasafras juice, or maybe it was something else, we relaxed a bit, relived the day, and turned on the radio. Now, if you haven't been in the middle of the wilderness on a cold, windy, rainy night, and heard the at-the-time very popular song ""Ackie, Breakie Heart"", as sung in French(imagine it), you haven't lived! We had the laugh of the decade, believe me! Funny how some experiences live with you forever!"
