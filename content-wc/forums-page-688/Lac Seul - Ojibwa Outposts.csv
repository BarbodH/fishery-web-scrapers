I believe they have new camp boats this year. They have a baitshop. The cabins are nice, but nothing fancy. Woodfloors, bunkbeds, indoor plumbing, hot water, and electricity. They have good docks for your own boat too. But if you bring your own the gas at the camp has to be boated in and it ain't cheap. I really like the place and I also like Ken and Brenda the owners. They run a tight ship and if you get out of line they'll set you straight. Their biggest reactions come to those that storm the dock too fast (I did that once, and only once) and people that keep big fish. I don't do that."
