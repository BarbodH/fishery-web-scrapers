559146,Larry S,2006-07-08 08:25:00,666,"Hey Guys, How about posting a detailed report on your trips to Blackbirch(Mr Walleye) and Ogoki Res (Jigman 2003) would like to hear how you did this year. We did real well at Windsor Lake this year except for the weather( Monsoons,numerous thunderstorms and hail) I posted a detailed report a number of days ago Larry S"
559654,Mr. Walleye,2006-07-22 19:53:00,74,"Hi Larry As I told you when I saw you at the landing, we had an awesome trip to Blackbirch. We caught a bunch of 18-22"" walleyes right off the dock! Biggest walleye was just under 27"", biggest pike just under 40"". We didn't fish for pike to speak of. Everything is new at the camp and worked great. Ryan hasn't built the fish cleaning house yet, but has the material there to do it. I'm sure he'll get it done by fall. We fished mostly in 8-10 feet of water, and used jigs & twisters most of the time. Occasionally we would use a chunk of crawler instead. We also trolled crankbaits and did great on them as well. As great as Blackbirch was, Mitassin was even better. I was digging stuff out of my tackle box I never caught anything with, and it didn't matter. They'd hit anything. No portage to Mitassin. Just boat to it in about 30 minutes. We're going the same week next year. Jigman might go with. JL"
559663,jigman 2003,2006-07-23 09:56:00,981,"Our trip to Ogoki was good, but not as many smaller (17-20"") fish as last year. We caught more fish in the 22-24"" range however. Biggest was a skinny 25"". No big pike, but plenty of 20""-25"" (unfortunately). The bugs (mayflys and some other bug I couldn't identify) were hatching all week. That in addition to several days in the 90's didn't help the fishing. We started fishing deeper 18'-24' after marking clouds of ""bugs"" that deep. That helped our fishing. All in all, a good trip. However, Ogoki does get to be challenging with the loss of jigs. We each lost over 100 jigs and tails. Not a big deal when you make your own, but it does get to be a pain retying all the time. I'll go back to Ogoki, but not next year. I'll either go with Mr. Walleye, or to another lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters."
559668,Larry S,2006-07-23 13:38:00,666,"Jigman and Mr walleye thanks for the reports. Our group as of now is scheduled for Dearden June 23-30. We are trying to get into Blackbirch any time in June,if no openings here then maybe Keezik Lake which Ryan may open up next year. If no other openings then Dearden June 23-30. We also do a drive in trip the week before, any suggestions for a good drive in trip Larry S"
559683,Mr. Walleye,2006-07-23 21:50:00,74,"Hi Larry I've heard great things about Holinshead Lake Resort. The other ones that look good to me are Medicine Stone Resort out of Red Lake, Press Lake Camp, Skyline Lodge, Andy's Graystone Camp, Sioux Retreat Outposts out of Sioux Lookout, Wawang Resort, Little Basket Outpost through Merkel's Camp, the outpost through Naughty Pines Camp, and Ross' Camp boat-in outposts. Have you checked in to any of these? If so, what have you heard? I've also looke at some places in Manitoba. Would you have an interest in those? JL"
559684,Mr. Walleye,2006-07-23 21:53:00,74,"Larry: I forgot to say that Dearden's tough to beat. If you end up going there again, you'll have a great trip. I would say that Blackbirch is a notch above Dearden, but not by much. Later . . . JL"
559692,Larry S,2006-07-24 08:33:00,666,"Jeff, Thanks for the drive in suggestions. We do love Dearden,but like to try new water{Blackbirch} if possible.If not available will stay at Dearden. Two years ago we put in the portage and boat at Springer Lake. The fishing was great there. Ryan told us that two more lakes at the end of Lavoie-Unnamed opened up this year and the fishing there was fantastic Anyway thanks again for the suggestions Larry S"
