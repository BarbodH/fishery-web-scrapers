559681,Guest,2006-07-23 21:45:00,0,I'm going to Canada here in a couple of weeks. One of the areas that we're going to fish is the Red Gut Bay area? Any good sources of maps (non-electronic...I have an old handheld GPS)for that area that won't cost me an arm and a leg to buy? Maybe with structure and depths or even a fishing locations map if possible. I'd like to know some fishing locations for Walleyes and Crappies before I get there. The Northern fishing should be a little easier since the group has the bays and areas that they have fished previous already scouted for Northerns but I'd like to take advantage of chasing some Walleyes and Crappies while on Rainy Lake. Are there a lot of rock piles or underwater obstructions to watch for in Rainy Lake? I really don't need a new lower unit if I can avoid it. Didn't sound like anyone in the group likes to chase much outside of Northerns but I plan to chase a few 'eyes and Crappies while I'm there. Thanks. Life of Crime.
