I got 36 cans of it while on the vacation in Europe last year and it is by far the best thing that I ever used. It works for deer flies, mosquitoes, black flies etc. The best think is that it's not DEET based repellant. The whole development program was mainly done by BAYER. They make the product in spray, liquid and gel stick. Not the cheapest thing around but by far the best. Last weekend we decided to do some late night walleye fishing. With swarms of mosquitoes around us, we got away with only few bites in the areas that didn't get sprayed such as just above belt. Here is the link to it:http://www.autan.com/nqcontent.cfm?a_name=Products God luck"
559261,Guest,2006-07-11 12:18:00,0,I usually find that consuming large quantities of good bourbon will do the trick. You can no longer tell if the flies are biting and you no longer care.
559264,Slick Willy,2006-07-11 12:54:00,36,"Leave your blues at home. Blue is by far the most attractive color esp. to blackflies. Bright whites , yellows , oranges , etc draw far fewer flies and make for more colourful pics too. For repellent use Deep Woods Off or Repel."
559304,Brax,2006-07-12 12:14:00,52,"The black flies were a bit of a pain this year. I saw an ad in a mag for a deer fly paper you put on your hat. You can see them on flypatch.com. This got me thinking, I got some fly paper meant to stick on a window and wraped them around the seat posts. They worked really well. The ones I bought were bright colored so I think for next year, I will get some of these and try them. It's nice not having to spray anything on."

559660,dave10,2006-07-23 09:03:00,342,"As promised, I ran my ""Bounce in your socks"" test against White Mountain repellant with the three of us last week. Although the biting flies were not thick, probably due to the windy conditions, the White Mountain was the clear winner. Dave"
559682,Guest,2006-07-23 21:47:00,0,"We have been using Thermacell's in the evenings when sitting out waiting to fry fish, work really well. They are about $20 and refills kits with three repellant pads and a butane cylinder for about $7. Can get them at Cabela's on the way up. Also work well in the boat if the wind isn't blowing too much. Marlboro's work to keep the bugs away in the blueberry patch too, light it and just hang onto it the whole time, let it go out and you get ate up even after soaking yourself in deet. :)"
558926,Guest,2006-06-28 00:39:00,0,"I have the same expierence as Brax. We go in early August and bugs are not any more of an issue than in the midwest. On occasion the black flies will bit your ankles while in the boat. The ankles are prime targets because I believe there is lest wind down a the bottom of the boat. The mosquitos can be viscious in the early morning on land too, but a citrinella candles and repellent if needed work just fine and once on the water no more mosquitos. I've never been in June and can believe it is a much different story."
558934,Guest,2006-06-28 08:03:00,0,"ditto, brax. flies only seem to come around if some bonehead brings a slimey pike into the boat. i don't even take bug stuff anymore. i go early-mid july to ear falls area."
558937,dave10,2006-06-28 08:26:00,342,"We'll be in the Ear Falls area in mid-July, and you guys are making me feel a lot better! We have had problems with biting flies at Eagle Lake during that time frame, however, so I'm gearing up for the grand experiment - White Mountain on the ankles for one or two of us, and Bounce tucked inside socks on the other guy. I've already calendared it to post my results. We'll be at Evergreen, by the way, arriving the 15th, if anyone is around and wants to say hi. Dad and two grown (more or less :) :)) sons in a white Lund Explorer with a 115 Yammie. Dave"
558938,Mohleye,2006-06-28 08:40:00,368,"I was going to make the same comment. We do a lot of portaging, and the mosquitos can be terrible in the wet areas, and around the landings. Once on the water, never a problem, other than the darned ankle-biters. I've certainly never had an experience where I'd even considered a bug suit or head net. On the trails I'm covered, so just some Off on the hands, back of the neck, and spray the ballcap."
558940,Guest,2006-06-28 11:08:00,0,All good advice...There has been a major explosion in Ticks this year as well. Make sure you check yourself out for these critters as well. Good fishing...
558952,Skylane,2006-06-28 21:14:00,101,"I got back from the cabin a week ago and the mosqitoes were about as bad as I have seen them. They are usually better as the summer wears on, and as was said, on the water they are not an issue anyway. For mowing the lawn the first time a bug outfit is always in order. Good fishing."
558968,pikemike,2006-06-29 15:51:00,95,What about the Cigars? I only smoke 'em for the bug screen qualities...just like i only read P Boy for the articles...
558969,dave10,2006-06-29 17:07:00,342,"Forgot about those, pikemike - good strategy! As a matter of fact, we bought some in International Falls on our way up last year - they're called Jungle Smokes. My sons and I like them and posted here a while ago to see if anyone else did, but got no response. They're supposedly handrolled in Ecuador (or the Honduras - can't recall which), and supposedly the only true handrolled cigars now made in the ""New World"". The guy who imports them goes to Ecuador (or the Honduras) every year on a medical mission, and this is his bid to help the local economy down there. 30 bucks for a can of 50. I went on a cigar smokers' message board to check out the chatter on them, and one or two people liked them, and others called them crap. One guy had the best approach, however - they're ""good"" if they're good to you. Dave"
558999,Guest,2006-07-01 16:47:00,0,bugs? what bugs?
559030,Guest,2006-07-03 09:20:00,0,Well here is where the DUCT tape comes into play. We had the black flies eating on our feet last year and no spray. So I wraped my ankles/socks with the wonder tape and no more snacks for the flies. I also think they like the color white. White brings them right in to the ankles. I guess that is why deer and other wildlife maybe have a white rump to keep flies away from the face and eyes.
558867,csuram,2006-06-27 00:23:00,18,first time to Canada please help with bugs!!! what can i buy that is the best for keeping all those bugs from ruining my fishing trip...please give me your best brand etc...
558868,phishfearme,2006-06-27 07:08:00,1242,muskol or anything with 95% DEET - i think deep woods OFF also. use it sparingly and spread it lightly over your skin then wash your hands. this keeps the smelly stuff off you lures and bait. also take a look at this for some medical backgound:http://www.webmd.com/content/Article...m?pagenumber=1 phish
558872,Guest,2006-06-27 07:24:00,0,DEET...and a lot of it. It wont kill you and the bugs hate it. Regardless of brand I would get something with at least 40% Deet.
558880,bigfish1965,2006-06-27 09:06:00,3210,Some DEET and a bug jacket. Sometimes DEET is like a condiment to the nastiest mosquitoes so the jacket saves the day.
558886,Guest,2006-06-27 10:35:00,0,"Light long sleeve shirt, full length pants, hat or cap with oversized bill and brim arround sides and back, hunting boots with medium to tall tops. I know this may be too hot for some, but I like something that makes it challenge for the black flies. The black flies bite through socks, so far they haven't bitten throught the letter boots-only a matter of time though. Feet may be a bit warm, but are unbitten. Bug repellant for face and hands."
558888,kbkakes,2006-06-27 10:52:00,49,"Deet work great but I hate the smell and feel of anything like that. Esecially on my face. Dusk and dawn and one hour either side is the worst. One thing no one mentions is mosquito head nets. I picked up one up from Walmart three years ago for 3 bucks. best money Iv ever spent. In the morning where jeans and long sleeves with net, spray tops of your hand w/deet. and your good to go. Kevin"
558891,Guest,2006-06-27 11:28:00,0,"I second the head net, one of our group wore one and we laughed at him all day, next day we had a major mayfly hatch,he laughed at us all day!!"
558893,Pond scum,2006-06-27 11:39:00,754,Mayfly's do not bite.
558894,Gameday,2006-06-27 11:40:00,5,"I was in Northwestern Ontario last week and the bugs were viscous. Most of us had full body bug suits and they saved the day. Since they're made of mesh they don't get too hot. Even if you don't like Deet, I'd try and get over that and use it. And, as another poster said, make sure to use a descenting soap after applying Deet (or suntan lotion, for that matter)."
558921,Guest,2006-06-27 20:44:00,0,"I will be leaving THIS Friday for Lac Seul. My son and I go every year at this time and I don't remember having any problems with bugs. Yes, they are bad around sunset but by then we are in the cabin. We leave the dock about 8 am. I do bring bug spray but have really never used it."
