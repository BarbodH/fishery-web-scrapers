559604,MoWalleyeguy,2006-07-21 09:15:00,409,Last year we were delayed and had to check into the imigration office at the boarder... we had all documentation and notorized letter. But they wanted to take the kid (12 years old) aside and ask him questions to make sure everything was okay. It took 45 minutes. (last time I'll be taking someone elses kid across! (joking)
559605,Guest,2006-07-21 10:06:00,0,Several years ago my brother and I took our 9 and 11 year old nieces with us to Canada. We had the birth certificates but not the written permission. The customs took the girls asside out of our presence to question them. We got through OK but the girls were a little shaken up. You might forewarn the kids that this might happen and to answer the questions directly and honestly.

559730,Guest,2006-07-24 22:08:00,0,"Went across the border with my friends son. We had his passport, notorized letter from Mom and the picture ID was a FOID card. The border agent was a little taken aback by the Foid card. They first asked me if we had any firearms and I said no because we didn't. Then she saw the kids ID and asked him the same question. I didn't know that the ID was a FOID card and was wondering what the heck she was doing asking the same question. We got thru ok as did our second car but the third one got pulled over. I guess after driving 18 hours straight, my uncle had a hard time remembering where we were headed. Of course the agents didn't like that and brought them inside for a 15 minute discussion. We had a good laugh at his expense the whole time we were in camp. Wingmann"

559548,guidedfishing,2006-07-20 10:22:00,531,I took the birth certificate and letter with wifes signature stating she new where our son (11) was going. Because I'm retired military he also had a dependent ID with his picture at the ready as well. The canadian customs asked if he like fishing and the US customs guy asked what was the biggest fish he caught. No identification for him was asked for going in or out. When I pulled up going in and out I had his window rolled down so he could be clearly seen by the agents. My only instructions to him was to make eye contact and answer the agents questions clearly and to the point. This was at the pigeon river / grand portage port of entry. good luck. GF

559563,Guest,2006-07-20 15:30:00,0,I agree that a notarized signed letter from non traveling parent that grants permission to travel to and from Canada for fishing for the period of_________to ____________ is a good idea. Also photo ids for the kids is good too. This could be their school id or a drivers license or learners permit. You could do an advance search for topics such as consent or minors. I've posted what I think is a good permission form.
