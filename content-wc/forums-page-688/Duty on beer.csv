559559,voyaguer,2006-07-20 14:01:00,54,"I think Fuser has it about right. The exchange rate varies, so try to pay whatever you can in Canada with a credit card as the credit card companys will give you the correct rate on that day. right now, something that costs $25 Canadian will cost about $22 US. go to x-rate.com to see before you go. generally, we have used up our duty free with a bottle of liquor and bought beer in US and paid duty at border. By the time we paid the duty, it was still cheaper than buying in Canada , but not a huge difference. If I was going to have to wait an extra half hour at the border to pay the duty, I might just go to the beer store in St Francis. Plus, they have the Canadian beer I want that i often can't find in the US Thinking of beer, remember that technically, you are breaking the law having beer (or any alcohol) in the boat with you out there fishing. If you do have some and its not open, you can usally get away with saying ""its for shore lunch later"" . Course, if its 4pm, you'll need to explain your eating habits. The biggest issue there is not so much having it with you but if you are intoxicated and its obvious, and they catch you (percentages are slim but exist), then you'll have trouble. I only have personal knowledge of one friend who was ticketed for this, and that was more related to an episode of giving a native guide too much to drink one day. Like with most things, moderation will often save the day take care Phil"

559619,Crappie Kid,2006-07-21 15:24:00,1581,I payed about $10 for each extra case we brought across. Those 2 cases we did not drink.
559650,Guest,2006-07-22 19:06:00,0,Beer at the LCBO was 48.00. 2.00 per can
559098,Guest,2006-07-06 04:35:00,0,Wow looks like I beter not turn any overtime down $48 for Labatts
559133,woods,2006-07-07 13:32:00,646,"Near Minaki, on June 24, we paid $50 Canadian per case for LaBatts and Kokanee. Wish we would have bought in the US!"
559159,Guest,2006-07-08 15:54:00,0,Is each adult in the vehicle allowed 1 case of beer to be brought in or are you limited to 1 case TOTAL per vehicle without paying duty?
559167,woods,2006-07-09 09:57:00,646,"each adult can have 1 case of beer, but then you are not allowed any other booze either."
559173,Guest,2006-07-09 12:42:00,0,every body knows how much booze you can take but nobody can give me a solid price on the duty per case
559177,Guest,2006-07-09 16:47:00,0,Those prices are not realistic. Premium beer sells for about $39 per case and regular on sale for about $26. You can buy your own beer at LCBO for under $29 Case. This is in Canadian dollars.
559178,Guest,2006-07-09 16:54:00,0,"Example as follows example of the duties and taxes charged on beer importation. In this example, the New Glarus Wisconsin Belgian Red is used, with a retail price of $8.99 (US$), which is packaged in a 750mL bottle. Retail Price (US$) $8.99 State Tax (8%) $0.72 Subtotal #1 $9.71 Cdn$ Value of Subtotal #1 (1.46 exchRt) $14.18 Import Duty ($0.008 cents/litre) $0.006 Excise Tax/Duty ($0.27985 cents/litre) $0.21 Subtotal #2 $14.40 Ontario Retail Sales Tax (12% of Subtotal #2) $1.73 GST (8% of Subtotal #2) $1.01 Border Levy ($0.676 per litre) $0.51 Total tax to be paid $3.47 Since this duty and tax structure is partially based on quantity of beer imported, this favours more expensive beers over cheaper brands. For the Belgian Red, the total duty and taxes amount to approximately 25% of the Canadian value. Considering the quality and selection of beers available in Buffalo, this is an acceptable cost addition"
559262,Slick Willy,2006-07-11 12:44:00,36,$48 for a case of Labatts? I can assume that this was bought at an agency store or LCBO and not at the Beer Store. LCBO and their agency stores will charge you at 4x6 pack prices as that is what they are allowed to sell. For the best deals on the best beer - hit the Beer Store. <www.thebeerstore.ca> There are several bargain brands(no national advertising costs) that sell for under $30 for 24 cans and $26.40 is the base price for bottled beer. Includes .10 deposit on both bottles and cans.
559274,Guest,2006-07-11 18:56:00,0,"We stopped at the ""beer store"" in Fort Frances and LaBatts was $35.00 per case/24 including the 10 cent deposit per bottle."
559528,Guest,2006-07-19 17:11:00,0,just brought 5 cases over our limit thru int falls bill was 42.00 canadian. not bad
558855,Guest,2006-06-26 15:22:00,0,Will be crossing at Fort Frances. Wondering what duty is a taking 3 extra cases. Will be drinking plenty of LAbatts Bluie back at cabin in the evening.
558856,phishfearme,2006-06-26 15:32:00,1242,"it's based on what you paid for it. assuming $20US per case (may be cheaper at the duty free store), the duty will be about $8-10 canadian. a good bit cheaper than purchasing in canada which is about $39 canadian now. keep your reciepts. - phish"
558905,Guest,2006-06-27 15:19:00,0,Where do pay the duty at. When you cross the Border?
558906,phishfearme,2006-06-27 15:24:00,1242,you declare what you have over your allowance then the office may or may not ask you to pull over to pay the duty. we've found that reading what you're declaring from a list has resulted in numerous times not having to pay the duty and have never had the car torn apart searching for whatever. - phish
558907,Guest,2006-06-27 15:28:00,0,The list sounds like a very good idea. Will elimante the deer in the headlights look
558944,Guest,2006-06-28 13:36:00,0,I suppose you will pay in Canadian then? or will they take US funds? Just curious as I am thinking about picking up an extra couple of cases.
558951,Guest,2006-06-28 19:35:00,0,Pay in Canadian whenever possible. They will take US of course but absolutely no $100 bills!! Good Luck DL -Blue at the duty free is $13 a case!!
558955,Guest,2006-06-29 05:16:00,0,"Wow, $39.00 for a case of LaBatts in Canada vs $13-$20 a case at duty free/home? How can the Canadian liquor/beer stores sell anything that is 2-3 times more expensive than other stores?"
558964,Guest,2006-06-29 12:57:00,0,When you pay the duty on extra beer the duty will be figured and collect with Canadian funds. You can pay them with US currency and they will figure the exchange and give you change in Canadian funds. My understanding is the exchnage rate is not near as favorable as it has been in years past so the cost of going North will be more and not just for gas.
558990,Guest,2006-07-01 10:16:00,0,Labatts was $48 a case in june
