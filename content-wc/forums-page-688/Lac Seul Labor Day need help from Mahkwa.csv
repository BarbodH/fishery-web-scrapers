What are the walleyes feeding on this time of year. Crawlers, minnows, leeches. How do you fish them.What kind of structure do you fish? Any guide reccomendations? Any help would greatly be appreciated. Thanks"
559696,mwal,2006-07-24 09:36:00,151,I have been going to Mahkwa for 5 years or so. I go in 1st week of July and have gone 3rd week of Sept. We have found that minnows and crawlers out perform leeches. Plus leeches may not be available then. Mahkwa has live minnows. We bring the Cabelas preserved large shiners and have had good sucess with them. In the fall I have done well fishing around Whitepine/ Kejick Island that you can see from the resort. Also on the East end of whitepine island there is a ferry crossing for loggin trucks. Use your electronics to find the sand flat that drops from 13 to 70 feet.IT is at least a half mile wide so I like to work the edges but they can be on top also. Anchoring near the edge and casting jigs deep and working them up the slope can be deadly. Windigo Island has also been good and you can try Pine Point abut a 10 minute boat ride to the east. We found fish on sand with steep drop offs or on deep rock structure. We used 2 oz bottom bouncers with large silver blades or Chart\orange blades. We also caugh fish on jigs with large white power minnows. If the fish weren't on the edges of the structure we found them up to 45 ft down some deeper. Good luck our fall numbers weren't as high but the quality of the fish was good with several over 27 for the trip in the fall. Surf the internet and order some Lac Suel maps and the spots I mention will be east to find. Mwal
