4166505,Bassmandpe,2015-08-29 07:42:00,42,We have been happy with the meals at the Wellington. Give it as try!
4167057,dino1m4,2015-08-29 15:43:00,11,Forest Inn good food and service.
4167265,NARDA 1,2015-08-29 19:22:00,636,Check out Kokum's Bannock Shack in Dryden. They are on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kokom...77296918972815
4180617,Bassmandpe,2015-09-04 10:42:00,42,Have found the Wellington to be pretty good for a meal or two. Over the years we have been to most of the places in Sioux Lookut. If our group was in town you would be welcome to come over for a combo baked/ broiled walleye & pike dinner at our Camp. No problem cooking for a few more!
4181809,NLpike,2015-09-05 03:49:00,28,"If you are staying in Sioux Lookout, you may as well stay in Dreyden. Sleep at the Holiday Inn express and eat at Patricia Inn Family Restaurant. They have pool tables and a nice bar. There is music on odd nights. They have good specials:http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restauran...t_Ontario.html The best thing is the Holiday Inn. They have very quiet rooms and everything is spotlessly clean. It's the last nice place you will see for a long time."
4185273,JAMOKIN,2015-09-06 23:27:00,48,When in Sioux go to Forest Inn. Great food and service. I travel to Sioux 4 times a year and Forest Inn is number 1 in my books. Best chicken wings on NW Ontario.
4207442,JAMOKIN,2015-09-16 18:48:00,48,After trying the Wellington I now have a new favorite pizza joint. Best pizza I have had in years and the wings were dam good. Don't let building scare you off. ( Flatlanders - almost as good as Ranch House was in Winnipeg )
4207530,wallydave,2015-09-16 19:35:00,2151,"Agreed! We are at the Forrest Inn , good food!"
4161169,wallydave,2015-08-27 04:53:00,2151,Anybody have any recommendations for dinner in Sioux lookout? Would Dryden be a better choice? Thanks in advance! We'll be up there on our way to flying with Hidden Bay Lodge.
4161193,bigwalleye1,2015-08-27 05:36:00,2632,"I've seen the menu at Foxy's in the Anderson Lodge complex south of Sioux Lookout. Menu looked great, prices not so much. Convined me to cook one more meal in camp. I think the Wellington does dinner, I think the Chicken Shack is still around, but when I drove by the place, I crossed that off. Dick and Nellies, last I heard, was still recovering from a kitchen fire. Perhaps a local will jump on, but options for meals out, in Siuox Lookout anyway, are slim."
4161449,Lovetofish,2015-08-27 07:27:00,458,A lot more choices in Dryden. My wife and I stayed at the Best Western three weeks ago. It has a restaurant and bar. We had a burger and fries and a beer and it was good. Looked like a good menu as well.
4161569,pjshorthorn,2015-08-27 07:58:00,5654,You got nothing to worry about.........Mrs. Breezy Point will pack you a picnic basket. Just go to the park in Sioux Lookout and enjoy dinner while watching the sunset over Pelican Lake. Option two is to check with the outfitter and see if they have a grill available at your jumpoff location. Breezy probably has a package of brats in the freezer left from our trip. Brats and beer......no better way to start a new fishing adventure. PjShorthorn.

4163401,wallydave,2015-08-28 02:59:00,2151,I wish we going through V Bay! I could use some more of the blueberry bbq sauce!
4163409,wallydave,2015-08-28 03:17:00,2151,Your right there! Last year we did have a care package for the road! Shaggy from HBL says the Forrest Inn has a good steak sandwich!
4164865,55walleyes,2015-08-28 12:46:00,131,We ate at Forest Inn in July. Meal was good.
4164881,wallydave,2015-08-28 12:57:00,2151,HBL also recommend Forrest Inn.
