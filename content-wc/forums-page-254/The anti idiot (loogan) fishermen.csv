We had 3 boats headed to Manitoba point area from the bay of islands. There were about 3 other boats heading the same way. We were all traveling near each other. Two of our boats passed them but by that point I didn't want to risk going off my safe travel lines very far so I just fell in behind one of those boats and was in front of another. It was fairly rough and one of the connections must have jarred loose on my finder. So, I didn't have my safe travel routes and we were in the poplar narrows area. So, I thought, not big deal. Just stay behind these guys and we are good. Well, they started to veer off and we realized they weren't going to the same area we were. So, I stopped and the boat behind us passed by and I got down and hooked my battery connection back up and turned the gps back on. Well, I was way off my saved route so I slowly started heading back toward that. We looked up and the boat that was behind us had stopped in the distance. He had started heading toward us when we started moving. We waved and when we were back on our route line he took off and went on his way. It was a boat from out camp so we watched for them and went to the dock to thank them. I thought it was pretty awesome they stopped to make sure we got going. Gave us a good opportunity to talk some trash though. Our own group........flesh and blood........left us to die floating like a bobber on lac seul when some kind strangers stopped to make sure we were okay. LOL"
