4209794,srk-low,2015-09-17 19:34:00,78,I'm 52 and been on LOW since I was 4 years old. I totally agree with Obabikon. Mid September cannot be beat.

I have lost track of how many eyes, alot. 27"" is largest. couple dozen smallies a day up to 18.5"". limit on crappie up to 14.5"". I fish 4 out of my boat so I don't cast for muskies anymore. All I do is jig and have fun with family and friends and catch fish. Mid-September is what I say. No boats. No bugs. Maybe some rough weather but you will catch fish!!"
