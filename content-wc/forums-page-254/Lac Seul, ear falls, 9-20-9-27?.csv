Any tips on what to bring? Prefer using methods other than live bait, but if minnows are the answer, no problem jigging with those either. General areas to start out? Areas to avoid? Will be bringing up a 17' glass tiller. Anything to chase other than walleye? How much do you need to watch for lower unit eaters? Thanks in advance."
4187729,Mark R,2015-09-08 08:38:00,1538,"You need to watch out for rocks anytime you get off the track that is shown on the map. If you get a good map and can read it you should be OK. However, I would suggest a map card if you have a GPS on your boat. We have been going up there for 20 years and have only taken out one lower unit. But, the camp we go to has had guest take out two per week."
4188921,Fishin Fun,2015-09-08 15:47:00,218,I've only been up to Lac Seul for the past 2 years and last year we stayed close to the resort and on the route that we were told to stay on to avoid rocks. Everything was fine. This year we explored a little more and got on the wrong side of an island and it a rock. I was able to slow down in time so we didn't do any damage. The very next day we were in some really windy conditions and the other boat we were with got blown off a reef and into some 3ft of water and they hit a rock getting out of there. Luckily no damage either. So be careful and follow your map and the advice of the resort owner. We did our best fishing on live minnows and crawlers. I've never had much luck with artificial bait. We caught fish both jigging and pulling Lindy rigs. We were up there in August and caught a lot of nice fish in Steamboat. Probably a good place to start. It hasn't been real hot up there this entire summer so I would think you'd catch plenty of fish without having to go all the way to McKenzie. But the resort owners will be able to tell you that too. Good Luck!
4189969,Aspencreek,2015-09-08 22:16:00,2911,"Lake....LS is an fantastic fishery, but USE the live bait. Jigging or backtrolling with inline spinner rigs. It is stained water, so don't be afraid to work weed edges and wind blown points in 14' all the way up to 4'. If they are stacked up, slip bobbers are fun (small jig tipped with a tail hooked minnow or leech or worm). Another tactic is a floating jig with a large split shot about 2' above and just drag it along the bottom tipped with live bait. Be ready to have the rod pulled out of your hand. Wish I was going along!!"
4190033,tyeegs,2015-09-08 22:55:00,177,"I've only fished north of there at Red/Keg/Gull Rock. In the spring i use Lindy/crawlers when drifting or ""jigging"". And a gold chub 'tail rap when trolling down to 12 feet. in the fall i've only used Lindy's and crawlers deeper around 20 ft ish and of course structure. Some times they'll come more shallow around river/creek inlets. Love the shorter fall days. 7 more years until I get the kitchen pass for twice a year in Canada."
4192281,rather-be-fishin,2015-09-09 22:56:00,429,"Lac Seul is a Walleye factory!!! It is a large lake with LOTS of unmarked rock hazards. A good GPS/Depth/Fish locator with a Lake map chip is a must have! The Navionics North chip has Lac Suel on it. A good lake map is a good idea too. The Four Season's Sports store in Ear Falls sells a good map for that area of the lake. You will drive right by it on your way to Golden Eagle Resort. Jig & Minnow/crawler or Spinner & Minnow/crawler are the best to use on Lac Seul. Hiring a guide early in your trip will be well worth the money spent & will show you the safe travel routes & fishing hot spots, pattern & technique for that time of year. The resort usually has a guide or should be able to recommend one. This will guarantee you a safe & fantastic week of fishing! Prov1800 guides in that area & is a member on this site. You will also catch Northern of all sizes & Sauger. Possibly some Perch & Bass I have been going to Lac Seul Ear Falls end for 12 years. The first year I went we stayed at Golden Eagle Resort & 2nd year at a resort nearby. There is good fishing on windy days close to the resort, when it can be difficult to head out to the main lake. It is on a marker reef just to the right of the resort looking out from shore. Fish also around the rail road bridge heading out to Goose Bay. Trolling points on Goose Island & fishing reefs on Goose Bay & the Steamboat narrows & points on shorelines in Steamboat Bay will produce fish. We were up there July 25 - August 1st & had an awesome week of fishing! Caught tons of FAT Walleye 20-25 inches with average size being 22-23"". Our biggest Walleye was 29"" & a few 27 1/2"". Our biggest Northern was 37"" & a few 30""-33"" without targeting them. If you would like more information on types of jigs & spinners that work well on Lac Seul & more specific areas to fish, send me a private message with your email address & I would be happy to share what works well for us. 10 more months to go & the count down is on to our 13th year & return trip to awesome Lac Seul! I can't wait! Safe travels & have a fantastic trip! RBF"
4195217,milfish,2015-09-11 08:17:00,249,does anyone know if there is a GPS map available yet for the North-East end of Lac Seul? Say Bear narrows North?
4201474,Lake Wisconsin,2015-09-14 12:43:00,1960,Any last thoughts? Packing this week. Roads still good? Thanks in advance!
