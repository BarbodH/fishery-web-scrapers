4175633,tim.123,2015-09-02 09:17:00,13,"Based upon what I learned from Walleye Central, I pulled the trigger and booked a trip to Booi's for the first week in July. Only 10 months to wait? Anyone with some maps and maybe a few spots to start would really be appreciated."
4178353,dan cardinal,2015-09-03 09:07:00,64,I should be able to help you with that. If you would like to PM me a fax or email I would be happy to mark some spots on the map for you.
4204634,tjandy,2015-09-15 14:00:00,107,"I will have to try Booi's sometime. Have spent a lot of time on Nungesser, its by far the best Walleye Lake that we have been to, including fly in. There a lot of big fish on that lake. We didn't go this year, tried Lake of the Woods. Heard the fishing was tough up until recently, fish got on the mid summer humps very late. We do like to try different stuff though and will give this resort a try some time."
4206466,zeebee,2015-09-16 10:37:00,1144,"When you pose that question to Jim Booi...the lodge owner, he will smile, look out on to the lake and say ""find any point"". Fact is hes bang on.Its an easy lake to fish and good spots are 5 min away to start. Expect 100/day per boat with a little effort. Lots of good size lakers too. We lucked into a 33lbs , great mid day diversion from walleye if you choose."
4120169,tim.123,2015-08-11 13:52:00,13,I am just about ready to book our early July 2016 trip to Ontario. Have narrowed the choices to Booi's on Trout Lake or AK on Nungesser. I know there is trout available at Booi's which would be interesting. Both camps offer comfortable cabins and great boats. I have read all that is available on this forum. Which one would you pick and why? Looking forward to tapping people with a bit more Canadian experience than I have. Thanks.
4120225,Golden Eagle,2015-08-11 14:02:00,2642,Both are excellent. I say go with better price. Also check about the mayfly hatch for that time of year and how it might change fishing.
4122361,LoDo,2015-08-12 11:26:00,721,"I haven't been to Nungusser, but can tell you first hand Booi's is legit!"
4124201,zeebee,2015-08-13 06:32:00,1144,"Taken both a 33lbs laker and 47"" northern out of Trout Lake. Walleye average 20-24"".....not too many over that but lots of them. Accommodation is 1st class at Boois.....leather furniture, dishwashers and some cabins have pool tables. Boats could be better but get the job done. Trout Lake itself is massive and allows for much exploring...highly recommend. One of the best fly-ins Ive been on outta dozens. Take in a portable downrigger and large spoons for the lakers...well worth it over jigging. We averaged a laker every 15 min with the rigger and none under 5 lbs. Best spoon was a 5"" Len Thomson Platinum series in firetiger. Great mid-day change of pace from chasing walleye."
4135537,dan cardinal,2015-08-17 12:56:00,64,"I was at Boois on Trout Lake in August 2012. I just returned last week from AK on Nungesser Lake. I am not into presenting a bunch of negative on this forum in regards to camps. I will say, for my money... Boois on Trout Lake is the far better destination in nearly every respect. If you would like to PM me I will be happy to fill you in on more details of my experiences at both locations."
4135817,eyemike,2015-08-17 15:18:00,233,Went to Booi's in early July 2013. First class. We had a hard time getting under fish to eat! We spent the week trolling cranks and had a blast! I don't know anything about AK. I too got my personal best pike at Trout Lake at 45 inches.
4141185,Clarence1,2015-08-19 08:23:00,29,What he said. I have been to both and strongly recommend Boois for all the reasons Dan will give you.
4141617,NP4ME,2015-08-19 10:21:00,378,"I have been to AK, but never Boois. With that being said, I would highly recommend Boois."
4142289,Fisheroffish,2015-08-19 14:50:00,5,Ditto NP4ME
4142657,dan cardinal,2015-08-19 16:17:00,64,Seems we got a pattern.
