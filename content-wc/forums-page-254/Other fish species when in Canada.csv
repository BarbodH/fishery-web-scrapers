He had a gentleman come into his shop and they were talking and the topic of fishing in Canada came up. The gentlemen then started about a trip he just returned from where they were catching 2+ pound crappie on a lake near Dryden while walleye fishing. This conversation got me thinking about fishing for other species of fish while up north chasing walleye. I have done the northern, muskie, smallmouth and lake trout fishing and enjoy them all but the chance of hitting some 2+ pound crappie even for a day is something too much to pass up. Has anybody here taken a half day or so to chase after crappie or bluegill as a change of pace from the walleye? If this post is out of line, I apologize and feel free to delete this post. Thanks for the information, Scott p.s. only 2 more days until the wheels are rolling north!!! Can't wait!!!"

Lake of the Woods is probably the most famous one. As far as Bluegill go... I'm not sure. I know the MNR claims that LOTW has some sunfish, but in my entire life I've never seen one. When the crappie are biting, it's a great change of pace. Usually it is very fast (or can be). The last two years at our camp, the crappie were on sunken trees, and were VERY easy to catch. September is also a great month, as the school and there's a bunch of crappie fishermen in the area."

We have learned to go with the flow in terms of fishing for whatever is biting at the moment. My wife and I very much enjoy fishing for walleyes. We tend to fish them early in the morning and then again just before dusk, as this is when the walleyes tend to most readily bite on this lake. We fish whatever is biting during the middle part of the day. It could be northern pike, perch or small mouth bass. We rarely pass a good musky spot without making at least a few casts. A variety of fish species in our lake of choice is good for us as something is almost always biting at any given point of time. Rod bending is good! Having access to crappies simply gives more opportunity each day to bend a fishing rod. I guess a possible downside of fishing crappies might be needing to take more tackle in the truck and boat. On the other hand, more fishing stuff can be a good thing! Good fishing and tight lines!!"

(lac suel cedar lake wabaskang pakwash gull rock eagle separation) that's a few. This year during our trip in mid August we caught nice crappie and Hugh perch and rock bass while fishing for walleye. Caught my personal best 15"" perch and 13.5 rock bass. We caught several crappie over 12"" on a jig and worm."
