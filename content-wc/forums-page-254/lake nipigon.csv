3560706,Mr Ranger,2015-02-19 11:21:00,272,Here is the website for the one lodge I had seen on the Sportsman Journal with Butch Furtman. http://www.onamanriverresort.com/index.html Looks like a cool place and have heard lots of great stories but have never fished it myself. As stated sounds like the big lake is primarily trout. Amazing body of water.

3585874,vteye,2015-02-26 07:30:00,812,We gave Nipigon a long look to do a drop off trip but kept coming back to the fact its a huge remote body of water in a camp boat. I kept thinking of a trip we did to Albanel in QC which is fraction of the size. Bucket list..
4199889,Guest,2015-09-13 19:56:00,0,"Milford... Drive East of Thunder Bay to the town of Nipigon, turn north on Hwy 11 for an hour, go 20-min east of Beardmore , turn north on Hwy 801 (gravel Rd. ) 45-min. to Onaman River Resort. ( check-out their website ) You can launch your 20' boat no problem. 5-miles of river @ the mouth stay north along the weeds & go north-side of islands to safer water.. go out into Humboldt Bay... shorelines & islands. Make sure you have a marine Radio !! Listen to the Weather Channel !! The word ""GUSTING "" means get your *** back close to the river. ( 0-15 kilometers = OK) (16-24 kilometer = Rough waters) (26-30+ kilometer you better be closer to the river or you'll be in 3'-4' footers. ) If you get caught (and we all have) put on the life jacket , 2-hands on the wheel & just go 10 mph & you'll make it back.. Like I Say ""Where else can a grown man get Scared "" Lake Nipigon is Beautiful but respect it always , the weather ! & the water that can go from 230' deep to 10' deep real quick !!!! It's the only lake I know that 20-30' deep water makes me watch my locator ! Always ask camp or some other boat what marine channel they are on."

4206378,mx2025,2015-09-16 09:51:00,52,"Just got back last from 3 days up there. winds blowing pretty good in Sept. Still made it out to catch some specks during the last 4 days of the season. 2 or 3 big Pike between every Speck. Don't ever do it, you'll never stop. (Yes there are walleyes as well)"
3541482,milford72,2015-02-13 20:33:00,13,Want to fish here this summer. Never hear any reports. Is it just to big and dangerous or is there no place to stay? Would bring my own boat( 20 ft) and love to explore and fish. Want to come back to a camp after the day is done and clean fish. Please enlighten me why nobody talks about this huge Lake and the possibilities.
3541786,46Harley,2015-02-13 23:13:00,149,Go to You Tube and do a search for Lake Nipigon. There is a complete episode from Lindner Media that I found informative. It is my understanding that the entire lake is an Indian Reservation and there are little to no accommodations. Drove by it on the way to Armstrong for 25 years and was always fascinated by it. I hope you get there.
3542170,walleye IA,2015-02-14 07:15:00,129,"Great question. My Son and I have been wanting to explore, camp, and fish Lake Nipigon. There isn't much talk about the lake on here which surprises me, because I'm sure guys go up there. I would like to know where can a guy launch his boat on the northern part of the lake. Where is the nearest launch closest to the Jackfish river? Maybe, someone can share there first hand experience camping, fishing and ect with us. Good Topic!"
3542210,Mike Borger,2015-02-14 07:22:00,1554,"Almost the entire lake including all of its islands is crown land and development has been restricted for some time now.As a non resident all you need do is buy your crown land camping permits from the MNR and away you go.It's big water so a suitable boat is a must, but it is indeed an awesome fishery."
3542226,Mike Borger,2015-02-14 07:24:00,1554,Nearest launch to the Jackfish? Probably Onaman River resort.People don't talk about it for obvious reasons.
3542354,Fisherman1792,2015-02-14 08:09:00,927,"Drive up to Beardmore, they have municipal camp sites on Lake Nipigon. The boat launch is Ok but there is no real place to leave the boat in the water.Just a few miles from there is High Hill Harbour that has boat slips but not sure if you can camp there.Been to Nipigon a few times the fishing is good, it has special rules (only one hook per line, barbless, no cheaters) read the regulations for it.Are you going for the lake trout? There is also walleye, pike, spec.I am trying to get a friend from Michigan to come up for the lake trout (you know who you are).Fisherman 1792"
3542898,srj,2015-02-14 10:45:00,971,"Be ready for big water and few people. We stayed in the skinny bay on the SE corner. The first time there, in 2 days of fishing the main lake, we saw 2 boats, one a very large MNR boat and the other a 50' or so vessel of some kind that was heading north. Incredibly beautiful, with high cliffs and black sand beaches. While there are some islands, it is a very open lake. Big winds kick up great lakes size waves keeping folks shorebound. There is an access on the south side and a few on the east side including the Provincial park and Poplar Pt a ways north. A few more boats out from that area. I think the road gets pretty bad heading to the NE side. Very large lakers and brookies in the main lake. A great whitefish population if you can find them too. Not sure about eyes and pike, but some natives we met said in the bays and rivers for them. The water stays cold all summer...lots of mayflies hatching in mid August the last time there. Awesome place."
3543514,Riceburner,2015-02-14 14:56:00,436,Super kid--Barry is honest and will work hard to make an enjoyable trip for you.
3547554,walleye IA,2015-02-15 19:52:00,129,You had me at few people....lol
3547594,walleye IA,2015-02-15 20:03:00,129,How does one go about breaking down a place as large as Nipigon. It's bays are bigger than most lake I fish. Especially when it seems to all looks so GOOD.
