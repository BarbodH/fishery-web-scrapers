Vonnie, Tim, Shaggy, Wilma and Dave know how to provide great customer service! From the offer of a nice rate, to providing all we could have asked for in service and meal plan! This was a trip of dreams coming true! We were warmly greeted at the Lodge, by Tim, Wilma and Dave our pilot for the first leg of the trip. Tim sat down with us, pointed out some fishing hot spots. All of which put us on the strongest fighting walleyes any of us, including Frank AKA Breezy Point, a 51 years veteran of Ontario fishing, have ever experienced! Wilma, sat down with us to finalize the meal plan, eggs, bacon, milk, water, steaks, chops, and just to top off the plan, fresh wild blueberry pie! HBL provides a cabin for the night before the flight. A nice dinner in Sioux Lookout, the Forrest Inn. Friday we have a lite breakfast at the Lodge, load up the plane and head out for our 30 Min. flight, both Dave and Shaggy fly professionally, and fly for HBL for fun! Low clouds kept us close to the Ontario landscape, moose and caribou were seen! A new motor on one of boats upon our landing on Lake Miniss, a quick walk through on the pump house, cabin and the grounds, and we are on our own! We try a set of rapids Tim pointed out for a quick couple of fish for the frying pan! A chunky 16incher its the first of many landed by our group of three! After securing dinner, we moved to several spots, all of which were holding fish. The days would repeat, trying new spots, catching some big healthy walleyes, tons of 17-22inch walleyes were caught! Breezy Point had 31.5 inch pike, the largest of the trip along with a 23.5 inch walleye, I pulled in 24inch walleye. Art a newcomer to Ontario fishing, his second trip to fishing heaven, was on his first flyin joined in the fun with keeping up with BP and yours truly. We all worked together around the meals and gassing up the boats, we all know when a group pulls together the trip just comes gets better and better. Each day working new and favorite spots like ""Meat Point"" brought better fishing each day! We had a warm sunny day to start, a cool front brought some drizzle, clouds and cooler temps, the fishing only got better! Nights around the campfire or when it turned cooler, around the woodstove. add a couple of Northern Lights displays only made a great trip even better! For me a couple of lines on the Bucket List can be scratched off! Fishing with HBL and seeing some great Northern Lights displays! Check and Check!"

4199929,lassh,2015-09-13 20:02:00,553,"Sounds like a great trip Dave. I agree with Dempsey, Miniss looks like a prime body of water. And I must say that I too would love to fish with Breezy Point Frank. So glad you enjoyed your trip. Thanks for your contribution to Walleye Central."
4200258,pjshorthorn,2015-09-14 03:44:00,5654,"Well sir, it sounds like you boys had a fun trip with a few nice fish getting in your way to boot. The first question is whether you could keep Breezy fishing in one general spot for more than 5 minutes this trip? I had to talk him into jumping beaver dams to get him to stay in one spot on Eagle Lake.......he had no choice since he was stuck.What was the bait of choice? Lure of choice........Sirmanski jigs by chance.??? Depth of water the fish were holding in?I would imagine that you had beautiful scenery with the trees turning.Just one piece of advice.......don't. mention to the wife that this trip may have been better than the anniversary trip you took this year Glad you fellas had a safe and enjoyable trip.PjShorthorn P.S. I was really counting on you to get Breezy into the 40+ inch northern club. I guess we are just going to have to send him out with a guide instead"
4200338,wallydave,2015-09-14 05:03:00,2151,"Pat, BP brought along crawlers and salted minnows, yes Sirmanski jigs were most often the weapon of choice! Most walleyes were caught in 8-12 fow, the largest eyes were deeper. There were a couple of areas that had been burned out by a fire several years ago, the fall colors were found in those areas. The anniversary trip is still a month away, so I will need to be aware of my comments!"
4200370,pjshorthorn,2015-09-14 05:31:00,5654,"I think BP must be in love with those crawlers and tending to them like his own kids when they were young. They have made it on three trips this year.....July,August and September. PjShorthorn."
4209002,BreezyPoint,2015-09-17 12:44:00,1581,"Yes, I am in love with the crawlers, but even more in love with the salted minnows. I won't be buying live minnows any more as the salted ones out fished live ones.This was a great trip and Hidden Bay Lodge was a great operation in every respect. Their airplane was a top of the line turbine powered Cessna Caravan amphibian. The cabin had a solar powered lighting system which worked great and did away with noisy generators. The cabin was very spacious and the food second to none. This was a top of the line experience and I would recommend them to anyone.Minis Lake walleyes were awesome. These hard fighting fished behaved more like northerns. Head shaking, running, etc. I would rate the walleye fishing equal to any lake I have been on. Fish averaged 18-20 inches and were extremely thick. We didn't catch any giants, but that was probably more due to figuring out where they were. The last day we caught bigger fish in slightly deeper water (20') than we fished during the week. Best walleye fishing I have had for numbers and average size and that tops Lake of the Woods, Lac Seul, and the English River, to name a few places I go regularly.BTW, the crawlers will make a cameo appearance on Lake of the Woods at the end of the month.Frank"
