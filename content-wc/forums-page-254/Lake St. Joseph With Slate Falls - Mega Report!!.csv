4192361,Mike Borger,2015-09-10 03:31:00,1554,We flew to Thunder Bay then rented a minivan. The older I get the more I appreciate not having to drive all that way.
4210050,BrianE,2015-09-17 21:18:00,98,"Thanks again Mike, very nice detailed report, keep up the great work!"
4213154,retire55,2015-09-19 08:57:00,1029,Another great report with pics and videos Mike. Thanks for sharing.
4187937,Mike Borger,2015-09-08 09:49:00,1554,"Hey guys, I just completed a very lengthy report on my recent trip to Lake St. Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts.A quick recap:-We faced some terrible weather, but ultimately persevered.-My boat partner Aaron Shirley and I concentrated on big pike - and got 'em!-Walleye fishing was insanely good. The other two members of my group focused on them and had several days with close to or over 200 fish in the boat. And these weren't tiny dinks either.-The cabin we stayed at on Eagle Island was very nice, it had some unique touches I've never seen anywhere else.-The outfitter Verne Hollett is one of the funniest most genuinely nice people I've met in this industry to date.So overall it was a great success!If you'd care to read the full report have a look here, but beware, there's a lot of photos and video. It's a long one! http://www.canadafishingguide.net/la...eye-beat-down/Cheers"
4188057,lemon,2015-09-08 10:30:00,5,Was there mid July and also had one of best fishing trips to date. LOVED reading your story. Awesome!
4188089,tv4fish,2015-09-08 10:36:00,2694,"I definitely agree with you there, Mike. Verne has ""gone out of his way"" to help us in past years."
4188185,SinOrSwim,2015-09-08 11:02:00,1528,"Yeah, looks average. LOL kidding. Verne helped us out of a crappy situation when he took over a fly in camp that we had booked with the previous owner. The trip didn't go well but Verne helped to fly us back to Fort Frances. Went WAY above and beyond. We weren't even his customers. He was a great deal of help and we ended up his customers for over 10 years after that. We now drive in but if we ever choose to fly again, I know where we will go."
4188201,campchick,2015-09-08 11:11:00,96,"We have come to expect excellence in your reports and this one hits the mark, as usual. I like how you showcase everything - the owners, pilots, facilities and the fishing. Looking forward to your next adventure."
4188241,fish007,2015-09-08 11:34:00,120,Another great report Mike ! Thanks again !
4188521,Mike Borger,2015-09-08 13:24:00,1554,"Thanks a lot guys, appreciate the kind words! It's nice to see others with a similar opinion of Verne as well."
4188609,LOW1,2015-09-08 14:07:00,2828,"Great pictures, especially the one with the cabin under the stormclouds."
4188657,adempsey,2015-09-08 14:27:00,963,"That was a much welcomed read. Sounds like another amazing trip and, at least for me, some great insight into such an enigmatic body of water. Much like Nipigon, it's such a massive lake but not a whole lot of information about it. I tried to follow your adventure with the map on my computer, but it's not easy . I enjoy trying to identify the locations based on your descriptions, but I am pretty much hopeless. So, thanks for putting that little section of map in your report! Did you drive the minivan all the way or fly from Toronto to Thunderbay?Mr. Hollett looks like he runs a first class operation and would love to experience it myself one day. I mean, who wouldn't? (well, besides my wife)"
4188753,tv4fish,2015-09-08 14:56:00,2694,"For those that ""want to check out"" Verne (Slate Falls outposts), he is in Sioux Lookout as Mike said - just west of the old ""Knobby's"" restaurant (now burned) and east of the old Donut shop (now closed)."
