4207458,lassh,2015-09-16 18:54:00,553,"I stayed there several years ago when they first opened. Its a nice place. The cabins are nice. They have flush toilets. The lodge is very well kept. The food is good. They have a separate cabin for lounging as well as the lodge and your cabin. The pike were extremely healthy and thick. There are some huge smallmouth in Shoal. There are also large walleye in Shoal that you may catch incidentally but it is not legal to fish for them. Shoal is a walleye sanctuary. Shoal Lake lodge is the only commercial lodge as far as I know on the lake. There are a number of private cabins on the lake. The camp is run by Tim, Dave and Katherine Kobelka. Very nice people and a well run camp. I stopped by there last June when I was fishing on Lake of the Woods. Its a nice camp."
4207866,Limeyangler,2015-09-17 04:17:00,563,Lots of big whitefish on Shoal too.Took this vid 5 years ago Ice fishing in Rush Bay.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_evP7xE_w
4208346,SinOrSwim,2015-09-17 09:10:00,1528,"We just got back from out trip to Lac Seul. Interesting you say this as the guy in the bait shop was talking about Shoal and the size of the walleye. He said it was closed for walleye but I took that as meaning it was all catch and release though? So, it's not even legal to fish for them?"
4208658,ftfarms,2015-09-17 10:40:00,444,A friend of mine used to go there. He said they used long crank baits trolling around and caught a lot of big walleyes while pretending to fish for northerns. His brother bought a house by rainy so they stopped going.
4209274,lassh,2015-09-17 15:17:00,553,"Shoal Lake above Ash Rapids Shoal Lake is an exception in Zone 5. The Ontario regulations read as follows: ""Live fish may not be used as bait or possessed for use as bait."" ""Walleye closed all year"". A post from Dipstick from Winnipeg in 2007 interpreted the ""closed all year"" to mean- ""This means no angling for them, period! Catch and release of walleye IS NOT allowed. Be careful with this one. To be safe, release all walleye that are accidently caught without bringing them into the boat, not even for a picture. Any guide who took the clients in for catch and release angling for walleye was breaking the law and putting their clients in a situation where they would be ticketed. That area is patrolled regularly."" I don't know what the correct interpretation of closed season is but I would not intentionally fish for eyes on Shoal Lake but you are likely to catch some when fishing for other species."
4210586,SinOrSwim,2015-09-18 07:41:00,1528,I just looked at the website and they do not even mention walleye. My guess is that means you are not to fish for them in any way.
4210698,reconssd,2015-09-18 08:26:00,147,"Shoal Lake is a first class fishery. Tim, Dave, Katherine are fine hosts and the accommodations are comfortable. The fishing on this lake is phenomenal. Walleye's are huge and its illegal to fish for them. This lake crosses over into Manitoba. Manitoba is the governing province for the lake. Walleye fishing has been closed for over 30 years. We have caught countless walleye by accident when trolling muskie lures for pike. The pike on this lake are thick, healthy and mean. Small mouth fishing is off the hook. There are some muskies in the lake too. If you fish there, I recommend you bring your own net. The nets they have are fine, except the nets are small. Bottom line - Shoal lake is one of the best lakes I've fished in Canada."
4210746,zeebee,2015-09-18 08:45:00,1144,"If I wanted to sample Shoal, I would stay at Ash Rapids Camp on LOTW and traverse the rapids (well marked) into Shoal..........best of both worlds.....walleye in LOTW and a short ride into Shoal. The area known as the Labyrinths on the way to Shoal offers some of the best bass and musky in LOTW. You cannot target walleye legally in Shoal...ie if you catch them incidentally you must release immediately. If you are stopped and foolishly admit you are trying to catch them but are releasing...you are screwed."
