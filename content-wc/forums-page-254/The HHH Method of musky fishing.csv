Method- Jig for enough time to take small walleye, play it for several extra seconds to trigger musky interest. When musky t-bones walleye- hang on! Position net man and convince musky that the walleye belongs to him. Gently guide musky toward net, if musky runs repeat previous action. Have net man scoop up 40"" musky. In the net, no hooks in this fish. he spit the walleye out in the net and that fish swam away as did the musky. FISH TWO Same location. Repeat previous steps except convince the musky to go directly to the minnow You must be more careful at this point because the minnow is attached to a hook that is in the corner of the musky's mouth. repeat final steps until net man accomplishes netting If I can get some help from my son I will try to get the pics of these fish on this thread"
