I know I had tons of questions about walleye fishing and found it not near as intimidating as we had thought. Caught tons of fish every day mainly on minnows. Beautiful country and would love to try to go again.

I have been to that resort in the past and that area definitely offers what I consider the full Canadian fishing experience. PM me if you are considering going back and would be interested in a few stories I heard from a few long time guests I visited with while there.

I think everyone should get a chance to go on a fishing trip like that at least once per year (make that 10 times per year), to me there is nothing as enjoyable as being away from the hustle and bustle of the big cities and getting out into the great wilderness. I always get excited months in advance for my fishing trips, kinda like Christmas when I was young. Good Luck!"
