Kelley Massaro once told us that the bay to the right of Don & Annette's cabin is so full of them in very early spring right after ice out that the bay ""moves"".Kelley said one of his clients caught a monster several feet long just before the Dam some number of years ago."

Interestingly, his summer job at the Univ was rearing sturgeon fry as a study on hydro dams impact on spawning grounds. The fish mature and spawn on a slow scale and are particularly vulnerable to change in habitat. A truly great and unique sportfish. LOTW has native fish but rare to hear of one caught."
4211282,jkaup,2015-09-18 13:11:00,56,"I have absolutely no experience sturgeon fishing. I have read several posts and heard while we were at a outpost camp that it is like cat fishing. Very stinky bait just sitting on the bottom. It was said by the camp owner they must only spawn every other year because his quests report catching one or two every other year. Some folks just cast the stink bait out and tie the rod to a tree or dock and leave it all night. I'm thinking if you are out after supper and anchor over some good walleye fishing, why not toss the stink bait on a rod out back and let it steep while cranking in some ""eyes?"""

I think commercial fishing must have decimated the population and that they are so slow growing and late spawning that it takes a long time to recover.It's neat that they are there."
