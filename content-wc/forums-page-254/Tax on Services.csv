4206938,BRP,2015-09-16 14:29:00,77,"13% hst is the law of the land.Insurance is exempt, but loses its exempt status when passed on to a third party.Only way around it on the guide fee would be if the guide bills you direct and he has less than $30,000 a year in revenues."

4207186,Obabikon,2015-09-16 16:36:00,2370,"Oh, and that rebate is 6.5% of the entire bill."
