Fished around Taylor island Tues-Thursday. Fishing was ok while dodging hail, rain and wind storms. The temps droped into the low 50's. We still caught fish but found them a little deeper some around 35 feet. We used both leeches and minnows with equal success. I fished Gulp alive the first couple days with good success but as soon as the weather changed I never caught another fish on it. I hope you get stable weather, you should have good fishing."
