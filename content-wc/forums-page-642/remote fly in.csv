567479,thunderatwork,2007-07-17 06:57:00,79,"I've been thru knobbys twice. both times to bamji lake. Big lake, good fishing, I liked the whole deal,except the drive. where I'm from you just about can't make it in a day unless you have a minimun of three drivers. THere is good fishing close,in sight of the cabin,and good fishing 45 minutes away. they have several (6-8)cabins at the place,so there is almost daily flights in and out. This helps on the bait situation. For the size of lake it seems there is a lot of non-productive water. don't get me wrong there is fantastic fishing, it just seems like one can go quite a ways between spots. They have a camp caretaker there to help keep things going, he will also help point you to hotspots. Down side,other than the drive, is that its not quite as remote as i like with the other cabins in the camp. You will see other fishermen every day in camp and on the water. However for a family deal this takes some of the edge off of being ""out"" there in the wilderness."
567484,Guest,2007-07-17 08:55:00,0,"L&M Fly In has moved there base to Dryden, shorter flights than from Clearwater, but still better than driving all the way to Sioux Lookout and they give you 125# weight limit. Along with the great fishing that the Siox Lookout area is noted for. www.lmflyin.com"

I called the outfit and yes they have moved there airbase to Dryden as you indicated and would like to get a 2nd opinion from anyone who has fished with them at any of the lakes they offer.

567599,Guest,2007-07-22 09:08:00,0,"Both of those lakes are good lakes. Otatakan is an excellent numbers lake with most walleyes running 16""-20"" on average with a few bigger ones and lots of 2-5# pike. Fawcett has excellent numbers with the walleyes running 18-22"" on average with some topping out at 28-29"". It also has some trophy pike if you work at it. Both lakes are good, I think you would be happy with either one."

567447,Guest,2007-07-16 08:25:00,0,"We plan on going to Marvin in August. Do you have any suggestions for bait, lures, places to fish..."
567453,thunderatwork,2007-07-16 10:41:00,79,"I have flown four times with rusty myers. the 70# limit is setup that way because they supply the food. I think they figure your 70 plus 30# food per person comes out to the 100# most outfitters use. Yes they are setup on four day trips which can mean too short for some. They have I think eleven lakes they have cabins on. Most of the ones on larger lake have another outfitter at the other end of the lake. Wabakimi being roughly 17 mies long has two(?) other outfitters on it. I obviously like the deal as I going thru them again, to wabakimi on the 7th of august. I know they have a few openings in some lakes for this summer yet."
567455,Guest,2007-07-16 11:27:00,0,Canoe Canada (also has fly-in cabins) based in Atikokan and Kashabowie Outposts about 20 miles east of Atikokan (both about 2 hrs. west of Thunder Bay) are great people with good accomodations and fishing. I've been using both of them for over 20 years and will continue. First choice would be Kashabowie with CC coming in a close second.
567467,Guest,2007-07-16 17:10:00,0,I want to give Rusty Myers some credit as Ive used them in the past. They are not much more money that Pipestone Fly Ins. Rusty Myers for the week 1235.00. Pipestone is 1180.00. Rusty Myers is right in Fort Frances so no further drive is required. They provide the food packs too in that price. Been going for a few years and considering driving up the road further for another fly in outfitter next year. I get air sick easily and both these outfitters have long flights as I am thinking I should drive closer such as Sioux Lookout or Savant lake. I hear the lakes north of Sioux Lookout has some good fly in lakes. I read on Knobby's web site they allow 120 pounds per person for weight too. Anybody go with Knobby's? I am looking into going with them next year.
567468,Guest,2007-07-16 17:22:00,0,Did a quick google search both outfitters. Both nice web sites. Which lakes have you been to with both outfitters. Im looking to take the family and want to keep them busy with action. I would personally like to catch some big fish but more important for this trip is keeping the family catching fish. Any suggestions?

567478,Terry Brand,2007-07-16 22:21:00,8,"I have been fishing with Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge and Outposts and Woman River Fly-In Outposts for around 15 years. They are out of Ear Falls on the way to Red Lake. I fished Bertrand Lake for 9 years with the best catch for 6 guys at 1,742 walleyes for the week. I am now fishing Antenna Lake and it has BIG walleyes and lots of Big northerns. We just returned from there and took lots of eyes in the 19 to 23 inch range. We caught a 43"", 40"" 39"" 36"" and 35"" pike plus lots of the 28 to 30 inch pike. Questions: [email protected] or check out www.gawleyslittlebeaver.com or www.womanriverflyin.com Terry"

559421,lassh,2006-07-15 23:14:00,553,"Raymond Â– I can offer a couple recommendations. Pipestone Fly-in Outfitters has a number of excellent lakes many of them located in the Wabakimi Provencial Park. Pipestone flys out of Clearwater Lake, about an hour from International Falls. It might be hard to get into Pipestone camps their business is predominantly repeat customers. Showalters as well has a number of good lakes flying out of Ear Falls. If you are looking to go in 2006, and you are a serious fisherman let me know. I have 2 slots available on Wabakimi in September."
559431,Guest,2006-07-16 11:06:00,0,"Try L&M Fly in, great pple great fishing...great times www.lMflyin.com"
559436,Guest,2006-07-16 14:51:00,0,"I'm just curious on your recommendations, which has better fishing. I notice that there are other cabins on Wabakimi and with open slots, is the fishing slower on that lake? I see that Northern Wilderness Outfitters & Rusty Myers have cabins there as well, if the fishing is really good, I'm thinking why drive an hour to Clearwater when I can fly from Fort Frances. What's your take on this."

559468,Guest,2006-07-17 16:21:00,0,"I fished Wabakimi about 5yrs ago the walleye was fantstic, but the northern were far and few between, they do real good with northern just after ice-out. We went thru Pipestone at the time."
559505,Guest,2006-07-18 19:50:00,0,what lake and with whom are the spots???
559636,lassh,2006-07-22 11:15:00,553,"Its hard to say if the fishing is faster or slower between one lake and another. They both fish Walleyes very fast and you'll catch many in the 20 to 23 inch slot. There is better trophy potential at Wabakimi although I know that 30"" walleyes were caught at Hammerhead this year. The weather, local lake conditions and other factors have a bigger factor on how these lakes compare to one another. As far as my thoughts on the fly out from Fort Frances - I don't have any experience with them. I know that Pipestone has good equipment and that they thoroughly check out the boats, props and gas etc. upon arrival and get things fixed if they are not right. Others would have better input on Rusty Myers. Reasons I don't consider them - 1) they offer 4 day trips, I prefer week long trips. You can buy extra days but I don't know how flexible they are and the additional cost would make them more expensive. 2) They have a 70 lb. weight limit, Pipestone has 100# and they will flyin beer and soda ahead of time. 3) They say at the end of their sheet to bring your own required emergency boat kit. To me, the outfitter should want to make sure that everything is right with the boats, especially the emergency kit. 4) They fly out for Wabakimi in the afternoon which cuts down on the first day's fishing My point to Raymond is that Pipestone and Showalter are both reputable outfitters based on my experience and they both provide service to lakes meeting his specifications."
559638,Guest,2006-07-22 13:00:00,0,"Does anyone have any experience with Northern Wilderness Outfitters on Wabakimi Lake? We usually have 8 guys, can both of these outfitters handle groups that big? Pipestone doesn't specify how many there cabin holds on Wabakimi and the other lakes say what they handle. I notice that Northern Wilderness has turbine Otters, what is Pipestone's fleet? Really curious how these outfitters compare to each other. More info would be appreciated, I want everyone's opinion before contacting the outfitter, so I can see if they do what they say they will. Thanks"

I have used Albany River Outfitters 6 times and have always had great fishing. There is a guy on this board that has been going on fly-ins a lot longer than me. He goes by Phishfearme and I think he is up there now and I'm sure he will post a report when he gets back. Do a search for Bow Lake and a past years report may come up.
