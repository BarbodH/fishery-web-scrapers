567621,Guest,2007-07-20 04:27:00,0,Where did you hear that poplar point is for sale?
567564,Guest,2007-07-20 14:15:00,0,"Heard that Poplar Point was for sale through the morning coffee gossip get together. Grant had a aneurism that almost killed him two years ago. The camp is not listed ""For Sale"" but if someone approached him with enough dollars, it could be for sale. Golden Hook Camp was being sold last year & the deal fell apart,not sure why. It's not listed, but you might give both these fellows a phone call. With the new younger owners of Wright's & Procyk's these camps could remain with the same owners for over 20-30 years. With the older owners of Poplar Point & Golden Hook these are the only two camps on Gullrock Lake that will become available in the next few years. After they are sold, expect to see the same owners for many years. Got to go. Need more coffee."

567465,Guest,2007-07-16 15:23:00,0,I have heard resorts for sale in Canada should be priced at 2 1/2 to 3 times their annual revenue. There is very little regard for a resorts ammenitys or location if this is true.
567466,Guest,2007-07-16 16:08:00,0,Did a google search for both of these and nothing came up. especially theone on gullrock would be nice to look into. any more info at all for that camp??
567469,Guest,2007-07-16 18:35:00,0,"It isn't right on the lake. you have to go thru the bug river to get to it. I haven't stayed there, but people say it is nice. Too far from the main lake for some"
567470,Guest,2007-07-16 18:58:00,0,"Have asked resort owners how they came to owning their camps, most have said they heard about them through word of mouth, others have just gone looking & found a camp/resort they liked & asked the owners if they were interested in selling. Others were guests at the resort & made deals directly with the owners. Lots of older folks (baby boomers) in the business & many are now getting ready to retire, go traveling & check out a few camp/resorts, you might get lucky."
567471,Guest,2007-07-16 19:17:00,0,"Oddly enough my grandfather also owned a camp years ago in Perrault Falls. I was looking at camps for sale today on a couple of real estate firms located in Dryden. Google ""dryden real estate""."
567472,wiswalleye,2007-07-16 19:17:00,62,I believe Golden Fawn on Lac Seul near Ear Falls is for sale. It is in need of some good care. The owner has health issues.
567487,Guest,2007-07-17 14:41:00,0,Do they have a web site that you know of?
567496,Guest,2007-07-18 09:47:00,0,http://www.latitude50.on.ca/Ontario/...ng_635259.html I know people who have been going to this camp for over 40 years. They tell me many of the clientele have been doing the same.
567513,Guest,2007-07-18 17:05:00,0,Wine Lake Camp is for sale. check it out a winelakecamp.com

567450,Guest,2007-07-16 09:25:00,0,How do you go about finding out what camps in ontario are for sale and the quality of these camps for fishing? My grandpa had a camp for awhile a long time ago. Would like to look into this. Any help or info would be great.
567451,Guest,2007-07-16 10:03:00,0,Rumors from outfitters that I have talked to this year indicate that business is slow at a lot of camps. Especially camps that are not on real productive fishing lakes. One camp I know of has fourteen cabins with a capacity of 42 people and they had 4 guests the first week of July. I have also recieved at least 50 solicitations from camp owners who I have looked at in the past. Most of them I haven't heard from in several years but this year they are being aggressive in looking for bookings. To me this means business and camp revenue is down at lots of camps....BE CAREFUL
567452,Fred_G,2007-07-16 10:39:00,908,Here's a place to start:http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/...ode/142/tbid/6
567457,Guest,2007-07-16 11:54:00,0,Those websites are alright but try to get word of mouth from people and you will find out alot more. I have heard that North Star Lodge on Clay Lake might for sale. Do a google search and it will come up. I have also heard in the past that Basket lake might be for sale but it is just a rumor so far. I think the camp owner is Olga North and she is getting up there in years and have heard she is looking to sell.
567458,Guest,2007-07-16 12:22:00,0,"Resort on Whitefish Lake in NW Ontario for sale for many years. I think it is Artesian Wells, but that depending on memory for years."
567459,campownerchick,2007-07-16 12:30:00,13,"If you are interested in purchasing a resort, there are many places to start looking. Here are a few websites for you: www.recreationland.net www.latitude50.on.ca www.century21cottages.com www.petersaretsky.com www.resortsinontario4sale.com www.northrealty.on.ca Keep searching around on Google as well. Start asking friends and people already in the business if they have any leads for you. You will find something you like with some patience. Good luck."
567461,Guest,2007-07-16 13:25:00,0,"Heard that Poplar Point Camp on Gullrock Lake is for sale. The lake has real good walleye & northern fishing. This spring when driving up the road to Red Lake, noticed Stone Lake Camp still has their ""For Sale"" sign up."
567462,Slimeball,2007-07-16 13:27:00,56,"These are mostly in the Georgian Bay, French River, Nipissing region. One of them I stay at about three weeks a season and it's pretty much a full camp every year from May through September.http://www.ontarioresortsforsale.net/ Jason"
567463,Old Critter,2007-07-16 13:29:00,14,"Do your own homework on location, access and fish numbers. Then call the owner and ask if he wants to sell. You'll find out there are a lot more camps for sale than you think, or that are listed."
