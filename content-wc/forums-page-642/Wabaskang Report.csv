Per Tom, the water levels have risen 41 inches since May and are near the high water mark. Decent weather Sunday and Monday. Started to rain Monday night and basically rained on and off the rest of the week with highs in the low 60's and windy. Took a couple of days to figure stuff out being the first time on the lake and being bull headed and not taking Toms suggestions totally to heart. Ended up with fish to eat every day and limits to bring home. We caught our fish in 11' of water on the weed edges and from 8' to 20' on rock stucture in the Big Lake. Largest walleye from our four person crew was 26.5"" (released), homers were all between 17"" and 18"". Used jigs and minnows or a split shot with minnows or leaches. Never found big perch, a few around 12"". Did not fish for northerns, they were caught while fishing for walleye and none over 25"". A couple in camp for two weeks fishing for slime monsters produced a 31"" as their largest. I see now why Trailerguy loves this lake, anyone heading up there, enjoy and good luck."
567473,Guest,2007-07-16 19:25:00,0,What part of the lake were you fishing in? I'm heading up to Tom's on the 9th of August and we have only fished the lake one time which was last year in the spring. We caught alot of fish around Doe Island and would guess they would still be there later in the summer. Any help would be appreciated.
