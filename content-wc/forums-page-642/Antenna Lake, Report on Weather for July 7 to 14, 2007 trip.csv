Lake level came up at least 5 inches during our stay based on how much a rock we always fish around in a bay was sticking out of the water. By Saturday morning the 14th, the rock was just about under water! Not much wind to contend with but almost wore out the rain suits putting them on and taking them off over and over again. Fish still bit very well except after thunder and lightning storms for a few hours. I agree, water levels seem much higher than I have ever seen up there this year. Terry"
