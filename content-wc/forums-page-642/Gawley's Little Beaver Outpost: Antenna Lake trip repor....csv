567512,Terry Brand,2007-07-18 16:38:00,8,"After fishing Antenna Lake for 3 years I thought I would share this wonderful fishery with others. Antenna lake is small by Canadian standards; 4 miles long and only 1 Â½ miles wide. It is strictly a fly-in lake where you are the only group on the lake. It's dark water conceals many rock structures, humps and reefs. There are a several great structures in it which do not show up on the maps supplied by the operator Doug Gawley. Walleye can be caught every day all day long on these unidentified spots. In one small bay the bottom is carpeted with a short form of sand-grass weed which is a magnet for perch, walleye and BIG northern pike. The west and north shores are indented with many small bays and each one has a good bed of cabbage weed in it. We have fished the entire lake now for 3 years with terrific success; the walleye average 18 to 20 inches and are very fat, testifying to how good the forage base is in this lake. Looking at my trip logs, my group of 4 has caught in 3 years, 1,926 walleyes between 18 and 19 inches, 359 eyes between 20 and 21 inches and 158 between 22 and 26 inches. Total walleye count is well over 3000 fish during those 3 years. Since the Gawley's promote catch and release fishing it is very evident on this lake. Antenna Lake also has a huge population of really big northern pike in it. We have taken them up to 47 inches, (about 27 pounds) and have seen many that were larger. In the 3 years we have taken 9 northerns between 40 and 47 inches, 54 between 36 and 39 inches and 355 pike between 30 and 35 inches and several hundred in the 24 to 30 inch range There is even a small lake off the north east end of Antenna that is stiff with big walleye and pike but you might not be able to access it if the water is low. Also the ever present beavers always seem to want to block the stream with one of their works. The operator on this lake is Doug and Gayle Gawley in Ear Falls Ontario. They run Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge and Outposts and Woman River Fly-In Outposts. We fished Bertrand Lake (Woman River Outpost) for over 9 years with our best year catch for 6 guys at 1,742 walleyes for the week. Great Operators, excellent equipment, great fishing and wonderful accommodations is what they offer. Gayle is even a Grandma for all you old-timers.
