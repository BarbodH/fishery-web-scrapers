567555,Guest,2007-07-20 10:33:00,0,"I guess it all comes from perspective. Both my wife and myself have decent jobs and make a fair income, around 100k. I look at my parents who had one breadwinner who made less than 30k. They had one car, no boat, 3 bedroom ranch and we went on two trips each year, one to Canandddda fishing and another educational historic trip in the states somewhere each summer. I thought that we were middle class back then. Now we have three vehicles, a camper, a boat, nice house, take nice vacations each year. Of course, one to Canada for a week of fishing."

567521,Guest,2007-07-19 12:33:00,0,"In a post on why visitors to canada is way down someone used the term ""middle class"" im referring to themselves. I am just wondering what people think that really means. How much income from the principle breadwinner does that take? does the wifes income count towards that number? Just wondering. I am thinking 100k from the husband is where the middle class starts anything less is NOT middle class but lower class. could be a tough pill to swallow for some folks."

567524,Guest,2007-07-19 14:04:00,0,"Our combined income is around 110,000. I guess I always thought of us as middle to upper middle income. We are both teachers with master's degrees (no jabs please), but work in different districts. My wife works in a suburban district. This year she had a student make the comment that if you do not make 100,000 you are poor. On the other hand, I work in a district that is not suburban and is ""small town"". When I talk to my students about wages they think $25,000 a year is a lot of money. I guess it's all about perspective. If we visit friends who live in my wife's district, they probably make 2-3 times what we make. If we visit friends in my district, we more often than not make quite a bit more than they do. It is interesting to see what others consider lower-middle-upper class."
