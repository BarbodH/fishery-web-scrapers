The trips (drive ins)I have made this year were at two differnt outfitters and one of them had no increase from last year while the other one had a 4% ($50 a man) increase. His increase did not cover the gasoline increase he had since all gas is supplied and the boat I drove with one other fisherman used over 70 gals that week. I would imagine that those of you on Fly Ins might be seeing some bigger increases. Canada is still a GREAT VALUE and without a doubt my #1 vacation destination.
