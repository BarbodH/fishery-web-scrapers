None of us have done one of these trips before though. However, we are experienced hikers/campers/outdoorsmen. We have our own canoes, packs, ect. All the web-sites I get on are fully outfitted trips. We have equipment we are familiar with and comfortable with. Is anyone here familiar with partially outfitted trips? I would like to have an outfitter steer us in the right direction. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Newby"

Here's a link to the Seagull Outfitters (at the end of the Gunflint Trail) discussion board. They are a top notch outfit and I'm sure you can get any questions you may have answered on the board. http://forums.seagulloutfitters.com/tool/mb/soseagull
567013,Guest,2007-07-05 07:51:00,0,"Okay, another question. Do we need an outfitter? Can we just plan our own trip, use our own gear, and get our own permitts? I would appreciate any advice/warnings anyone has to offer. We have never done one of these trips before but are looking foward to it."
567020,denny in Chicago,2007-07-05 10:39:00,13,"Yeah, people do that all the time. If you're entering the BWCA from the American side you can co online and get your BWCA permit here.http://www.bwcaw.org/ When you pick it up at the station you assign (usually a ranger station or outfitter nearby your entry point) you give them your route so they know where to begin looking for you and when to start worrying if something goes awry. When you pick up the permit, the station will orient you to current conditions and rules and you will be shown a video on how to conduct yourself in the BWCA. I suggest you take all the BWCA rules seriously but if you take nothing else seriously, take the guidance on camp fires. For the second year in a row there's been a major forest fire in the BWCA area by the Gunflint Trail. The one this year was started by a legal campfire than somehow got out of control. It can get very, very dry up there in a hurry so be very disciplined with your fires. If you're going into Canada through Lake Saganaga on the Gunflint Trail you will also need to get a CANPASS RABC which allows to to go back and forth across the border where there is no customs stations. You can do that here:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/ca...u-eng.html#c01http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pbg/cf/bsf386/bsf386-e.pdf The Boundary Waters on the Canadian side is called Quetico. Here's the Websitehttp://www.ontarioparks.com/english/quet.html That's all you are required to do."

You should consider how long you want to be in the BWCA, how many and how long portages you want to traverse. Perhaps you want to fish for a certain species as I did (silver pike). Do you want to do a cicuit of lakes over the time you are there or camp in one place a make day trips to different areas. He can offer suggestions where to put in and the routes to suit you goals. Equipment: An outfitter will have all lightweight camping equipment. Remember anything you have you will have to carry over portages. The weight can add up in a hurry. The only thing you won't carry back is the food you eat. The outfitter we used would do partial equipment plan if you wanted to supply certain pieces of gear. For a first timer, I would recommend using an outfitter. Son and I did a BWCA in 2003 and I consider it one of the top experiences my life. Best of luck.

We continue to use their friendly services even after a dozen BWCAW trips. They can: * Help select a launch site * Secure necessary permits * Plan your route (where to camp, travel times, portage distances, points of interest , fishing tips, etc.) * Provide detailed maps and review them with you before you depart. * Provide needed equipment * Share insight in things you never though to ask."

567250,Guest,2007-07-10 08:32:00,0,"I am past the canoeing to fish part of my life but appreciate the experience (when mother nature cooperates!) I suggest you do a google search on canoe fishing and/or go to myriad of canoe websites for advice on what to take. My brother and family went to the BWCA last year and did their own outfitting. They rented a canoe and also took the two river kayaks that my brother built. They carried in leeches (should have taken in nightcrawlers) I suggest a medium weight and medium quality spinning rod and reel with an extra spool of line per fisherperson (an outfit you can afford to lose if you dump the canoe), a flat plastic tackle box from Walmart, knife, sidecutters, hook removal kit, tackle, perhaps some basketball nets (tie the bottom, fill with rocks, tie rope at top-instant anchor. A mini depth finder is nice. (Past threads on this, that you can find if you search this site.)"

It's a group that started as a scout group and has all their own gear. All they use the outfitters for is to order permits, but these are very knowledgable people that are experts on both parks. If your group doen't have people that have done these trips before, It's well worth talking to these folks or another outfitter to ensure you're routes are reasonable, and that you really have all the gear you need. I highly recommend a trip to BWCA/Quetico. They are unforgettable trips. My first trip was 1979, and I still remember parts of it clearly. Would also love to hear where you are thinking about going. Apply for the RABC's early, they can take a few months."
