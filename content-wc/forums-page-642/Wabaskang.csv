We will be at KingFisher, and understand that the new (in the last couple of years) owners are great. Any feed back you could share would be great. We are hoping to get into the jumbo perch again and of course to catch a walleye or ten. How about the Gulp bait for Walleyes and bass? Going to take crawlers, but would like to give the gulp a shot too. A report when I get back."

567591,wildernessgum,2007-07-21 18:49:00,19,My father-in-law and I stayed at Kingfisher lodge last year and are going back again middle of August this year. Gerry and Linda the owners are very nice people. Last year they had a deck hand named Lester who was just a terrific guy. Lots of good stories. I heard he was coming back again this summer. Hopefully you will have a good time with good fishing weather. wildernessgum
