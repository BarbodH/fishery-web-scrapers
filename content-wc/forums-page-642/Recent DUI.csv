567380,Guest,2007-07-13 20:00:00,0,"We just went to Canada in June. Canadian Customs and US Customs both looked at our ids, in my case it was my driver's license, and they typed something in on their terminals. Depending on where you got pulled over, there could be some lag time from when you get pulled over until it is on the system. You might want to ask your state DMV what information is shared. As far as DUI, In the last year, I had a friend who died from injuries from an accident he caused while drunk. He knew better and and we all do. But we keep drinking and driving. We never think it could happen to us. I never thought it would happen to him. Something needs to change here and it has to start with us. Fritz"

567435,Guest,2007-07-14 20:36:00,0,I don't know about coming into Canada but going into the US it isn't a problem. I am canadian and got a DUI back in 95. Part of the process of getting a DUI here is you have to some meetings at the Addictions Foundation. I asked about crossing the border and they said to tell them about it. It isn't treated like an assault or theft etc. I have went across a dozen times since then and always told them about it and have never been denied entry. You can contact Canada Customs and Immigration. Here is the website.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/visitors-e.html

Really? > >rod bender bob Who says someone who is charged with a crime isnt fleeing to Canada too avoid prosecution? In Canada if charged with a D.U.I. you automaticly on the spot lose your licence for 3 months... no ifs ands or buts,, its gone! Then when convicted you lose it for another 12 months,, thats for first offence."
567287,Noel,2007-07-11 07:58:00,115,One of my party got picked up just last week for a DUI. Hasnt even been to court yet. But we are leaving for our Canada trip in 7 days. Do you think his DUI will show up when we cross the border? Does a DUI only show up in your records after conviction? I have no idea how those criminal records check work at the border. Anyone have any experience with that? thanks.
567290,Guest,2007-07-11 10:07:00,0,I have been charged with a crime but my trial is still under way. Will I be allowed to enter Canada? No. You are considered criminally inadmissible if: you have a trial under way; there is a warrant out for your arrest; or you have charges pending against you or an officer has credible information that you committed an offence outside Canada. http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/f...lity.asp#note3
567299,Guest,2007-07-11 14:34:00,0,"I believe they check with the NCIC, National Crime Information Center, which is run by the FBI. This data bank shows arrests and convictions. If you are checked and they find an arrest or conviction you got some splainin to do. What are the chances of bing checked? That is the big question. I would say less then 50/50 but be prepared to be sent back if you are checked. If you get thru don't get in any legal trouble while your are there. If you have a recent DUI you are probably w/o a drivers license so if you don't have one you should have a passport if you have neither you are taking a big chance on getting into Canada and getting back into the States."
567327,Guest,2007-07-11 22:37:00,0,All you have to do is take a car or truck that is NOT registered in a person's name with the DUI. They check the owner of the vehicle by license plate number. What do you think those cameras are for when you pull up to the Customs booth? I had to get out and read my motor home's plate number because it was blocked by the spare tire holder. In less than 3 seconds he knew where I lived because YOUR U.S. goverement gave all your information to the Canadiens without charge.

567336,cruiseforever,2007-07-12 08:51:00,177,May I ask who your government is?
567339,T Mac,2007-07-12 10:42:00,10084,If you are asking about the original poster... The original poster appears to be from Wisconsin...USA.
567358,Guest,2007-07-13 07:35:00,0,"Whatever you do: If you are hauled into the little back room, TELL THE TRUTH. Sometimes they know, sometimes they don't, but if they ask, your chances seem to be better if you tell the truth. Maybe bring along a couple hundred extra bucks so if the officer feels you are not an immediate threat, sometimes they allow you to buy your way in the first time. However, if you ever want to return, make sure you get the paperwork taken care of for a ""Waiver of Exemption."" As I've posted on this board in the past, one of our guys went through this: he ended up getting in the very first time, but without doing his follow-up paperwork, we ended up chasing fish around Minnesota the next time. Unfortunately, he won't be coming along in the future."
567359,Guest,2007-07-13 08:09:00,0,"On one trip to the great north on a hunting trip a buddy and I were put in the so called little room and they to my truck apart,dumped out all our dirty cloths and looked under the truck, down my gun barrel and went thru my bow case in the end they said have a nice day and walked away while we repacked our stuff. Whats up with that? Just luck of the draw or did I fit some profile? abe1"
