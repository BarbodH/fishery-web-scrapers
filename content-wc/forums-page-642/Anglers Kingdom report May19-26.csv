567347,Guest,2007-07-12 15:53:00,0,"Thank you for posting the Rebuttal from Kevin... However that thread is inaccurate. I know I commented on it more then a couple of times. Most if not almost all the replies were deleted from it, as Anglers Kingdom is a paying advertiser on OFN.. So you are not seeing the whole story here folks. Most of the negative posts on the two threads were either edited or deleted completely by OFN's mods. I know because I read them before the mods on OFN decided to censor it for fear of losing a paid advertiser. and trust me... if you seen the original thread BEFORE it was edited.. you would all be giving your head a shake.

567350,Guest,2007-07-12 18:16:00,0,"Appears to be an attempt at personal destruction of a camp owner. Do some among us want him dead? I'll be checking Nungesser Lake and Angler's Kingdom for myself from August 4 - August 18. We'll be able to handle anything that comes to us. Our party includes three ladies, a 10 year old girl and a 7 year old boy. They're pretty tough, so they'll be okay."
567352,lobo1,2007-07-12 19:28:00,734,you'll be fine Goldeneagle - don't sweat it a bit. I would take in some Gulp minnows and/or some scent for your twisters (I use a product called Nitro - grease). The gulp minnows work great but I don't like how they drag in the water when jigging at any kinds of depths 15-40 foot or so. Maybe it was a bad week but the fish really wanted that scent - maybe even live bait - but I refuse to use it. The scent really helped out when things were slow. good luck lobo1

I would still offer a free stay or at least a discounted stay. I bet for the negative input that this has caused his camp---- a free stay would be a cheap fix !!! Just my opinion."

566277,Guest,2007-06-15 10:23:00,0,"An unfortunate start to the season for Kevin at Anglers Kingdom. Things happen that are out of your control and you react to the best of your ability. I have known Kevin for many years and know his family well. They are quality people that do their best at accomodating everyone....guests, family, and strangers. Nungessor is an amazing lake with many opportunities of catching that trophy northern and or walleye. I have fished this lake many times dating back to the days of fishing with my father on all the lakes on or near Nungessor Road. Some quests you can never please! Kevin knows this as he's been in the business (and his family) for many years. Keep up the good work Kevin and all the best throughout the remember of the season."

566331,Guest,2007-06-15 18:51:00,0,Having been in a supervising position for about 15 years handling medical complaints I have found one thing to always be true. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Always there are 2 passionate parties that are sure their story is absolutly accurate but when you investigate everything the truth is somewhere in between. Reading both posts it sounds as if this is the case here also. I have considered Anglers Kingdom and still would go if circumstances were right. Eric MacDonald MD
566338,5richards,2007-06-16 18:32:00,131,"I fished with Kevin last year and he was very attentive to my groups' needs. We had a great time. Having read the recent issues of the group that was there during the ""freeze"" I can sympathize with them for we have very few precious days away from the ""real"" world. I can state however, that when staying at Anglers Kingdom I spent a good deal of time wandering about the camp and asking questions about how ""things"" worked such as the water supply/the electric{I'm an engineer - my excuse!] and was truly amazed. To get the camp up and running after a major freeze was a huge task -- I know this doesn't make that group feel better, but I know a #### of a lot of work went into getting it back up! I'll go back."

566157,Guest,2007-06-11 13:10:00,0,Wow...what a horrible trip!!!!!!! Did you get any discount or refund for all of the problems??????? How did the guys from the other camps seem to be doing? Were they catching fish? Well how was the drive up and back? Did you get into any accidents? Did you get detained and strip and cavity searched at the boarder as well???

566211,Guest,2007-06-12 10:33:00,0,No offers were made to rectify things.
566212,Guest,2007-06-12 10:37:00,0,"We talked to several people from other camps on the lake and they had no complaints. Nungesser is a good lake with lots of fish, I would recommend going a couple of weeks later though. The water temp was anywhere from 49 to 54 degrees. No border problems, we are from Ontario anyway."

566246,AMPHIB206,2007-06-13 18:37:00,191,"The Geary name is synonomous with fishing camps in NWO. I can empathize with him not having adequate/competant staff on hand to deal with all the issues of running a remote camp. Throw in some bad opening week weather and it creates a huge mess. Americans also expect more out of camps these days. They want hot running water, satellite TV, electricity, new boats motors and fish finders. (They also pay a pretty penny for all of this as well) [Editorial note: I remember going on a fly out in the late 80's to a rustic camp on Wapesi in NWO with no running water, a bar of soap and shampoo on the dock to bath with in the lake, the outhouse door hanging by one hinge because of an angry bear, no phone, propane heating and lighting, and a 30.06 at the front door for the bear. That trip was $200 Cdn for the week. We had used Naden boats, 9.9 Johnsons, some gas and a 5 gallon pail full of minnows. We were happy with that. But now everyone wants deluxe ammenities and that comes with a cost] Just sit back and think about all the work that goes into building a camp and getting all the buildings, supplies, gas, boats, motors, happy staff to a remote site. That is a lot of work and effort. Anyone who has built a home should realize that there will be delays due to incompetant contractors, weather, cost overruns, equipment breakdowns etc. The scenery up in that area is breathtaking as well. Nungesser Lake is a trophy lake and I'm pretty sure that Angler's Kingdom will not dissappoint. No, I don't have an affiliation the the camp. Enjoy your vacation the pristine Canadian wilderness. Thanks. p.s. So where is that Debra Johannesson these days; still flogging her signature Southbend rods and reels?"
