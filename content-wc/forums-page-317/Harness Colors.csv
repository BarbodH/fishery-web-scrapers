2984337,PRO-V1,2014-07-10 18:17:00,142,"When i'm fishing tea colour water or overcast days it's ether hammered copper, silver or gold with the same coloured beads, and will go with the willow blade just to make a little noise. On those screaming vfr days i will go will chartreuse green, white, or black. and i keep the bead patterns simple. Mike"
2979153,labsrus,2014-07-09 10:16:00,557,Leave for our Canada trip in less than 25 days What colors seem to be working for everyone? Last year we had mixed results Watermelon Blades and orang/green beads Orange Blades with black and orange beads Silver Blades and Green beads These three color combos worked best. Of course that is all we ran as far a colors since we were catch fish. Always want to swap out a harness that is working to something else to see.
2979441,phishfearme,2014-07-09 11:28:00,1242,"if the lake you're fishing is heavily tannin stained then below 2-3 feet colors all look the same. put a mask and snorkel on and see for yourself - and maybe a wet suit. the action/movement of the blade and it's reflectivity are many, many times more important than color. in clear lakes color may make some minor difference but action and reflectivity are again where it's at. phish"
2979513,Pooch,2014-07-09 11:46:00,4619,"Blade and bead colors are a moving target. I'm not so sure that the action and profile are just as if not more important than colors.My unscientific colors of choice are purples, blues, golds and on occasion green. All with some contrasting color bead or pattern on the blade. I think red may be an underappreciated color on occasion. Look at the success of the old red and white Daredevils that had a gold or brass back.I carry way too many blades with me, but I'm anal about color when I find a combination that honestly out fishes other colors. I'll fish that combo until something changes as in light level, wind or cloud cover forces a change.Pooch"
2979561,MrSimon,2014-07-09 11:59:00,922,"Maybe, but I tend to think that walleye are much better at seeing underwater than we are. I've been fishing for over 30 years and I still can't figure out why color maters sometimes, and doesn't matter other times. So I just try different things until something works."
2979577,Carnhzkr,2014-07-09 12:02:00,964,"Everyone has their favorite ""lucky"" colors, and I'm no exception, but I would agree with phish and pooch that it's more shape, movement, and flash that determines which is the hot bait. My personal favs are gold, firetiger, pink, and silver. One thing I like to do when pulling harnesses, if it's a bright sunny day with little chop and the walleye are tentative, I go to a minimalist presentation. Many times I've had the best luck with a bare hook on a snell. Maybe just have one red bead or small float ahead of the bait. Try it."
2983017,Aspencreek,2014-07-10 10:44:00,2911,"X2 on all of the above, with water temps changing, wind, water levels, cloud cover, Hi and low pressure systems, etc. etc. WAY to much emphasis is placed on colors. Vibration, movement (slower, or faster) along with the meat attached is the keys. I like blades with the extra ""lip"" on the ends and even the ones with the slots in them. I also lean toward the holographic for as much flash as I can get. But I too carry way too many blades and combinations of bead set ups. But what else am I going to do during these long cold winters ........work on the honeydo list.....NAW!"
2983225,Mike Kansas,2014-07-10 11:49:00,1463,If I had only oe color to use it would be Gold. I think the vibration is more important and like #5 Colorado blades. I don't do a lot of BB because i think it is just more fun and better action jig fishing. Mike Kansas
2983625,Blades-n-Beads,2014-07-10 13:43:00,484,"I agree with all above, I'm defiantly a believer of big water big blade (#6), add some propellers to your set up, one just above your first bead and another on top above Clevis bead. This really adds a thump in the water and at times makes all the difference. Vibration, rattle, turbulence is what I'm looking for along with some flash."
2983825,CamoHunter,2014-07-10 14:46:00,363,"My own opinion, I don't think it matters much on the lakes we've fished up there. The last two years, I've tied a variety of colors. All of them seemed to work equally. I had them all spooled up on tubes. When I got snagged and lost the one I was using, I'd just go down the line and put the next one on, purposely not choosing any specific color. They all seemed to work the same. That being said, I do like the brighter colors though. Whites, Yellows, Golds, Silvers. There probably is a difference in many scenarios, I just haven't seen it on the lake we typically fish up there. I suppose you'd really be able to tell pretty quick by going from an all white spinner, to an all black one."
2984089,Hump,2014-07-10 16:10:00,578,"with Mike Kansas as far as gold... however, this year on one of our outstanding days, i was getting a few with gold, switched to Perch color and bam, one right after another."
