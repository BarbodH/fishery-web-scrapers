Maybe if one of the vehicles wasn't mine eh? Or in my younger years?? Now I have to check all these things in case my kids are trying to put one over one me!!!! I'm the border agent at home!"
2976865,ohiojmj,2014-07-08 18:25:00,1262,"Bought 4 L's of CR at duty free shop with my son, clqimed it at US customs, no problem. On way in, I had casw beer, two L's of liquor, claimed it, no problem. Buffalo, NY at Peace bridge. Never had issue."
2977441,Glenman12,2014-07-08 20:16:00,762,we had 6/30 packs of beer and 3 handles of liquor plus a 5th and the duty was $101...
2977545,downriverbob,2014-07-08 20:31:00,880,"All the Canadian crossing are not the same, I live south of Detroit have a sister that lives in Windsor. They seem more concern about weapons, where you are going, and how long you are going to be there. I have cross over at Sault Ste. Marie, MI to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario several times, probably the easiest Canadian cross ever for me been through where they didn't even ask for I.D. Going from International Falls to Fort Frances, if they perceive you as a vacationer they ask about weapons, alcohol, tobacco, and gifts. Going across borders you never know what is going to happen. We travel with a dog and cat, rarely if anytime ask for rabies certification. A quick story,one year we were going through International Falls through Fort Frances to Lake of the Woods. We crossed into the custom area in Fort Frances very early in the morning on a week day. The custom people were not busy, they had group new officers so our vehicle and boat were going to be a training exercise. My wife and our dog were out of the car, and I was trying to find the cat. He was hiding so the officer said he would do vehicle search and watch out for cat. In the mean time others were search my boat which I travel with a cover on. I had an old ice auger in the boat that I was going to give to the my friend at the resort that we stay. The officer in the car found my cat(I think he jumped out and scared him). Nothing was ever said about the auger even though it was August. BOB"
2977713,bkw67,2014-07-08 21:28:00,70,"We are crossing at International falls in MN. If you purchase it at the Duty Free shop... does it have to be within the limit? We could buy it there the night before, as we are going to get to International falls late afternoon and are staying there (family member has a motel there)."
2977785,Carnhzkr,2014-07-08 21:56:00,964,The amount you are allowed to take across the border without paying duty is the same no matter where it is purchased. It's just cheaper if you buy at the duty free.
2978657,bkw67,2014-07-09 08:19:00,70,"Thanks to everyone for the prompt, accurate and sometimes humorous replies!"
2980201,NAV165,2014-07-09 14:02:00,412,"Several years ago 4 of us went to Manitoba. 2 of the guys liked Vodka so in addition to their allotment they filled some water bottles with Vodka and returned them to the case. They informed us which one's to watch for. As you know after a week in camp stuff gets pretty messed up. We returned home, split up the leftovers etc. About a month later my wife and I go out of towm to a meeting, I pack a cooler with some beers, wine and water. In the middle of the night she gets up to use the bathroom and when she was returning to bed she grabbed a bottle of what she thought was water and took a big swig! You can imagine her reaction."
2972145,bkw67,2014-07-07 12:56:00,70,I have a few members of my party that want to bring in more than 1.14 liters of 'Vodka'. We will be crossing around 6 am as we have to be in Atikokan by 8:30 am.What kind of tax/duty can they expect and do we need to bring any documentation?OrIs there anyplace to purchase early on a Monday morning after we cross?
2972385,CI_Guy,2014-07-07 14:10:00,2118,"We have the receipts for the booze and give them to the border agent when we know we are over, This site can calculate it for you:http://www.canadiandutycalculator.ca/"
2972425,bkw67,2014-07-07 14:17:00,70,Thank you... but WOW!!!! $25 Duty for a $15 dollar bottle of vodka????Glad I (personally) will not be over... I don't have the receipt for mine. I purchased two 1 liter bottles of Crown in St Thomas in December for $25. With the plan of taking one on the trip next month.
2972521,SinOrSwim,2014-07-07 14:31:00,1528,"we don't take the receipt. We just tell them approx how much we thought it cost. But, yes the duty to take it over the border is steep.That said, if you wait to get it until you are over the cost is crazy high. So, they will get you one way or another. Also, if you are crossing early TAKE IT WITH YOU!!!!! No questions. The Beer Stores etc have very limited hours."
2972969,ftfarms,2014-07-07 16:02:00,444,When I used to drink a lot I just took a empty windshield washer fluid bottle fill it full of vodka and add two drops of blue food coloring put cap back on and roll. Now I just buy a case of Kokanee or sleemans 2.0 that last me all week.
2975961,Aspencreek,2014-07-08 12:07:00,2911,"Now that you have posted this, the border agents will be ""testing"" all of the windshield, coolant, etc. bottles upon tearing your vehicle apart. Great idea though! wish I had thought of that, but I quit drinking anyway."
2976049,515,2014-07-08 12:35:00,254,"Just be honest with them and let them know what you have as long as its not overly ridiculous and tell them your going fishing for a week and most of them will wave you right thru. They understand what its all about, now that being said you can always run ino one that will make you pay on it."
2976217,Carnhzkr,2014-07-08 13:31:00,964,"I've put Scotch into a Listerine bottle to smuggle booze onto a cruise ship. Worked with no problem, except the Scotch had a weird taste to it."
2976385,Mike Kansas,2014-07-08 14:22:00,1463,"Had a guy tell me once that they put their extra booze in a plastic gas can. No border problems and no lake problems. Might work, not the right thing to do but like I said might work."
2976425,SinOrSwim,2014-07-08 14:32:00,1528,Not sure what border you are crossing but that has NOT been our experience.............oh wait......you said NOT overly ridiculous. Nevermind.
