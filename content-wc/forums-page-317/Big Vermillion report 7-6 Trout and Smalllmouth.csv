We got sick of catching walleyes on Lac Seul so we decided to go to Big Vermillion and target Smallmouth and Lake Trout for a day.The Smallmouth have yet to spawn on this lake yet. Got word from someone that was out on the lake the previous day that the smallies were not on the normal rock points and they were all spawned out. Unfortunatly the smallmouth and trout we did keep were ALL full of eggs still. If I would have known that I would have let them all go. We fished the shallows looking for beds in some of the bays with no luck. We didn't even see one. Lots of northerns though.Finally went out to some of the islands and I found them only in sandy/muddy areas, in trees in the shade. I think I pulled 7 or 8 fish out from under one pine tree. As you would get them to the boat, a few other fish would follow. We used a yellow or orange hook with plastic gulp leeches and a splitshot about 2 feet up the line. They would chase crankbaits but never hit the bait. So I would throw my hook and gulp out and they would hammer it. Tried the rocky areas but no luck, it had to be under trees in sand/mud or on rock edges.Also Lake trout are around 85 feet right now on bottom. We used a 3 way rig with 4 ounces of lead and a flutter spoon. If you were not in 85 ft you were not seeing fish. 5 minutes into trolling (.85mph) I managed a keeper. Then a big storm came in and we decided to pack it up for the trip.Also a word of caution. The water is VERY high and some rocks that are normally above water are below now so be carefull out there."
