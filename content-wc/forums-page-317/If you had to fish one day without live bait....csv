My biggest walleye came on a 5"" spoon designed for Great Lakes salmon! My other go-to lure is x-rap, any color as long as it's white!!....................."

Berkley Powerbait Ripple Shad in Glow/Chartreuse..........I outfished my buddy with live bait the whole trip. 1/4 oz VMC Moon Eye jig head and snap them a bit to get them off the bottom and wait for the hit. Broken record but man, it worked fabulous. Also, Gulp Alive 3"" minnow grubs, same story! Snapping the jig was key, caught about 20% more fish than my buddy who used live minnows"

Have caught almost anything with it (including snagging a sucker) Cleo is easy to regulate depth, works well at vertical jigging, casting or trolling. I use several colors but the above is my favorite"

We fished down by Ignace from May 28th to the 30th for Lake trout. Then we headed up to end of road the 31st. I'm leaving the 17th for my summer trip up by Sultan, Paul"
2934273,REG,2014-06-25 07:24:00,445,"Fishing was great this year in June - so good that I went the entire week without ever using live bait. The only walleye bait I used was a 1/8 oz. jig with a Zoom 4"" split tail spinner-bait trailer as a body. Either white or pearl. But I also caught Northerns, Perch, and Smallmouth on it (as well as a 30"" and 2 27"" walleyes and many, many regular sized walleyes). I would normally use a 3"" curly tail body but they were tearing the split tail up! It is composed of a very soft, very salty material that they would actually hang on to. They come in a 20 pack for $4 and I probably went through approx. 30 of them. I'd catch fish until the body was so shredded that it wouldn't stay on the jig! So much faster and convenient (and cheaper) than messing with live bait."
2934289,mswope13,2014-06-25 07:29:00,73,"Rich, how were you fishing the split tail? What size jig head were you using? Sounds like you had ""one of those trips!"""
2934449,REG,2014-06-25 07:58:00,445,"I like fishing a jig and minnow straight up and down as much as the next guy, but I like casting a jig and body even more. I think it allows you to cover so much more water much faster. (Not as much as trolling, but I never got into trolling) And as soon as I get a fish, I unhook him and I'm back to fishing almost immediately. I like to cast out, let it fall, then ""jig"" it back - hopping it close to or on the bottom and concentrating on anything unusual - such as any ""ticks"" on the line - as well as any extra weight - or the absence of weight - and setting the hook immediately. Sometimes while the jig is a long ways out, I'll see the line twitch without feeling anything. Set the hook. It's a blast when they hit it on the initial fall and you have the entire length of the cast to bring them in. This is easiest when you don't have tons of rocks - if you do, you'll lose some jigs doing it this way. I actually tried vertical jigging with just the body - and I got some fish, but I think the casting technique excels at triggering fish into biting. We also targeted areas known to have more active fish - like points where the wind was blowing in - or below falls with lots of moving water - or the channel with it's current. I like a 5.5 or 6 ft. graphite rod that isn't too wimpy so you can feel the line and jig. And I still use mono - I just prefer it for this method over braid. One of our spots is out in the lake a bit, but close enough to a river inlet that it has a very well defined river channel. I try to position the boat off the channel but cast over the deeper water of the channel and then jig up the slope back to the boat. That produced the 30"" and one of the 27"" walleyes. You should try it and see if it works for you. If it doesn't, it only takes a few seconds to take the body off and put a minnow on!"
2934641,Aaron-IN,2014-06-25 08:39:00,500,"I never use live bait, I would go with a 1/4 oz mimic minnow in a shad color with a silver spinner."
2934673,MrSimon,2014-06-25 08:44:00,922,"If your lake has pike and bass, try trolling rattle traps in the evening. Its incredibly relaxing to sit back and troll around while BSing with your buddies and snacking on jerky. We've had great luck trolling silver and blue rattle traps over boulder fields in about 8' of water. Its a blast!"
2934753,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-25 08:58:00,725,"For us, walleye assassins are the answer. We prefer the shad color with the curly tail. Sometimes the electric chicken color is very hot. Worked better than minnows for us this year. Walleye assassins are made by Bass Assassin and are available through their website. I would never be without them. Cast them, vertical jig or swimming them over rocks all work for us."
2935097,stumcfar,2014-06-25 10:27:00,451,"Fished Lac Seul a few weeks ago. We were on a spot where your jig hit the bottom and you had a walleye, as long as you had at least a piece of live bait. We ran out of bait and tried Powerbait and Gulp and never caught a fish. I know people say they work, but they sure didn't that day. The best artificial for walleyes is a shad rap hands down."

2945993,stillangling,2014-06-28 14:57:00,149,"Once the water warms up - generally by the middle of June in NW Ontario, cranks work great. I like to troll because the bait is fishing all the time and you are coving water to boot. Hate to say it but normally I wouldn't even consider using anything but bait for the first two weeks of season. Fishing power just drops off too much in cold water."
2933081,mswope13,2014-06-24 19:57:00,73,"Was thinking about fishing one day during our 6 day fish trip this year without taking any live bait. Our group focuses mainly on walleye and will be fishing the NW end of Lac Seul, Steamboat Narrows to be specific. We typically jig/minnow, but wanted to break up the monotony and try something new. What lures would you recommend accompanied with presentation? Jigs tipped with twister tails? Mepps? Raps? Gulp? Any input would be appreciated as I think it would be fun to really work for those eyes!"
