2970993,SinOrSwim,2014-07-07 07:30:00,1528,"Just checking what delays we may run into. Not leaving for a few weeks but heard the ramps from I-35 at Hwy 33 by cloquet are an issue along with maybe some detours in cloquet?Trying to decide where we want to stay on the way up? Virgnina, MN or Orr, MN. Virginia has better food choices but the Americinn also has the train tracks right next to them. Have my 9 year old with me. Ovesons in Orr has the pool/waterslide (waterslide will probably be closed it looks like) but the food choices are minimal. Always a crapshoot with small town bars/restaurants. They say open til 8 but if it's not busy they close early sometimes. The views from Ovesons in Orr would be a lot better than Virginia though too."
2971153,LOW1,2014-07-07 08:11:00,2828,"http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy33cloquet/ From what I can tell, the construction work will be an issue for those folks coming from Duluth and then going north on highway 33/53 and for those travelling the reverse route. We came back over the weekend and there was some other minor construction in Cloquet and south of Cook but no big deal. I have stayed with my kids at all the motels you mentioned and had no problems or complaints with any of them. If food choice is a priority, perhaps you should consider a hotel in Cloquet. There is a Super 8 and an Americinn which are near several restaurants. They can be pricey during the peak season. Otherwise my thoughts and preferences would be to go as far north as possible, perhaps even to one of the nice ""ma and pa"" motels in IFalls. Have a safe trip."
2971417,rather-be-fishin,2014-07-07 09:10:00,429,"SinOrSwim ~ Another option for Lodging in Virginia/Mt Iron area is the Holiday Inn Express on 169W just 1 mile off of Hwy 53. Newer motel with a pool too. Also, Super 8 on Hwy 53 in Eveleth has a pool too. When are you going to Canada & where? 19 days & headed to Lac Seul for us! Can't wait! RBF"
2971473,SinOrSwim,2014-07-07 09:26:00,1528,"That looks nice. Heading to Hawk Lake Lodge with my kid 4 weeks from today. So, my travel is different than what I am used to. Thus, looking for places to stay to break up the trip a little. Because a little under 8 weeks, we leave for the guys trip to Lac Seul. That one, we stay at my brothers hten leave really early and drive all the way up in one day.I like the look of hte water slide in Orr but it says it closes at 4pm on Sundays. Plenty of options wtih pools though. That way he can burn off some energy after a long trip in the truck."
2971601,Carnhzkr,2014-07-07 10:18:00,964,"I just got back from Lac Seul Lodge on 6/5. No construction issues at all. I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Virginia on the way up. It's real nice. Got 5 stars from my wife for newness and cleanliness. It's fairly expensive, comparatively, but I found a $125 rate online then called the hotel directly and they matched it. I'd stay there again next time. We ate dinner at Grandma's. I'd recommend that too."
2971713,vaquero01,2014-07-07 11:02:00,101,"Only 1 hr 45 minutes from Orr in Ft Frances is La Place Rendez-Vous on the shores of Rainy Lake. My wife and I (Lab, too) have stayed there the last 4 years on the way up. Decent restauraunt on site, also.We left Onaway last year the day you guys were coming in, Sept 6. Looks like we will miss you again this year. We are there from Aug 29 thru Sept 5."
2971785,SinOrSwim,2014-07-07 11:22:00,1528,"Yes, we have stayed at teh Rendezvous before. Liked it a lot. This first trip with my son, we want to try and make 2 shorter travel days vs one really long day. Then, yes we will miss you by a day or two. I think we arrive at Onaway on the 6th? If you REALLY wanted to, you could leave a map with your secret spots in Cabin 3!!!!!! I think we will do the holiday Inn express in Virginia. Good dining options, and then only about 2 hours or a little less ot the border the next morning."

2973505,MorganMan,2014-07-07 18:53:00,341,"Yes, the lane closures and ramp closures will begin this week, maybe tomorrow the 8th? Project will go until Oct sometime it looks like. I'm not sure if ramps will be closed the whole time or not, but it looks like the trip up will be fine, but trip home will be slight detour probably south to the Carlton ramp to jump on I35 or the one on the north side of Cloquet?"
2977289,downriverbob,2014-07-08 19:53:00,880,"You can bypass that area by going on Hwy 2 through Proctor all the way to Hwy 33, we have gone this way for years to bypass Duluth also. BOB"
