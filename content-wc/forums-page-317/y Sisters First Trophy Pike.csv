2983457,Larry S,2014-07-10 13:05:00,665,My sister went on her first fly-in with me this year. She caught her largest walleye 24 1/2 and while fishing(jigging) for walleyes pulled up 3 nice pike the largest measured out to 41 1/2 If you happened to read my previous posting Unusual Catch you will know that she hooked a very weird object which was attached to the bottom lip of a walleye
