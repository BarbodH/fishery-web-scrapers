2906289,TheDFP,2014-06-17 09:24:00,39,"Got back over the weekend from the Gouin with Air Tamarac. They provide an outstanding service!Surface water temps ranged from 65 in shallow back bays to 59 on the main lake. We did good with the walleyes in 8-27 feet of water. Biggest was 24"". Only fished for pike a little and they were tight up on shore in the weeds. Biggest was 40"". Jig and worm worked best. Fish were on points. Road going in was good and not as good coming out due to heavy downpours. Good news is they were grading the road on Saturday as we were driving out."
2940753,smallcal,2014-06-26 19:43:00,119,Great Reports! Thank you. We are down to two weeks from tomorrow. Anyone have any updates? Water level? Temps? Colors? Anything? I've got the countdown blues...
2948561,eight4,2014-06-29 13:36:00,11,Heading up to Oasis du Gouin on Friday for another week of fishing. Have not been there this time of year and am wondering what depth we should be fishing for pike and walleye at this time of year.
2954393,smallcal,2014-07-01 05:51:00,119,"Not an expert, only going up for the third time in a little over a week, but both other times were this time of year.We generally troll with worm harnesses and start in the 12-15' range working shallow or deep depending on what the fish tell us. We target walleye almost exclusively, but the pike follow. This has yielded from 12"" to 24"" walleye, nothing huge but consistently interesting. One caveat, the caretaker at the camp caught two walleye while we were there, a 6 pounder and a 9 pounder! He was using a tiny jig at 30-45'. Unfortunately for the future of the reservoir, he ate both!"
2959474,eight4,2014-07-02 12:40:00,11,Thanks for the info it should help. Too bad about the 6 and 9. We got a 6 last year but hopefully it's 7 or 8 now.
2959626,ftfarms,2014-07-02 13:34:00,444,Wow!! The caretaker ate a 6 and 9 lb walleye. What was he thinking? I know by law he can but it's hard to believe he doesn't have any more respect for the fisherie.
2970737,smallcal,2014-07-07 05:30:00,119,Anyone come back recently? We leave Friday and would appreciate any updates!Thanks.
2978097,smallcal,2014-07-09 05:14:00,119,Anyone? Two days away!
2856945,sbe2,2014-06-02 08:29:00,63,Any reports from the Gouin? Water level? Water temp? Fishing? Going in two weeks and getting antsy.
2867161,Kartman35,2014-06-04 16:27:00,245,"Water temp was about 15C, and the fishing was good! Caught walleyes trolling with spinners and crawlers or leeches in 7-13 feet of water. They seemed to like the yellow/chartreuse blades. We were super lucky for the beautiful weather (rained for maybe a total of half an hour the whole time I was there) and the late thaw meant the bugs weren't even out yet. We were able to sit outside comfortably!! I don't think that'll be the case when you get there though... Fear not...It's beautiful up there. Have fun."
2867401,sbe2,2014-06-04 17:33:00,63,"Thanks for the Intel Kartman. Where were you fishing? I expect the bugs to be as bad as they were last year, especially with the late thaw."
2868609,Andre (wallyandre),2014-06-05 05:23:00,2274,"Until now it was the little males that were active but the mama are starting, so in 3-5 days it's going bonanza time."
2868777,Kartman35,2014-06-05 06:24:00,245,I was in the northeast corner. Can't be too specific as I was invited to a camping spot that some guys have been using for the past 30 years I'm told. They'd be less welcoming to me next year if I gave their spot away to the whole internet.... Are you going to an outfitter? There's another member on here that's supposed to be at Oasis du Gouin right now...I was going to go there until i ended up buying a boat at the last minute... Good luck
2869361,TheDFP,2014-06-05 08:57:00,39,I hope its bonanza time in 3-5 days. We fly in on Saturday morning.
2869721,sbe2,2014-06-05 10:42:00,63,"My group is fishing on the west side of the reservoir through an outfitter, whose name I should also not mention How is the water level compared to last year?"
2869809,Kartman35,2014-06-05 11:13:00,245,"I was in the same spot 2 years ago, and I can say that a big rock I saw just under the surface seemed the same this year as 2 years ago. Not sure how much that helps, but my Navionics chart seemed quite accurate everywhere I compared the stated depth to what my sonar was telling me."
2873705,Freytown,2014-06-06 16:54:00,770,"I just returned from the Gouin...fishing was fantastic. On May 30th water temp was 5C but yesterday it was up to 10C. Water level kept rising all week and is about 2 feet from full. Big females were being caught...this next week the walleye bite should be on fire. BTW, fish were very shallow....right up to the bank."
2874417,octanehi5,2014-06-07 06:04:00,1104,"You guys hit the walleye as they came off the spawn ,in the next two weeks the bite as you said will be on fire. Good to hear you ha a greatr time"
