2984617,slugger doug,2014-07-10 19:54:00,15,Going up to Savant Lake via Thunder Bay. Any construction or road repair being done. Especially on 599/ 2 years ago they chip and sealed the road and my truck received damage when the semi trucks would fly by and shower us with rocks.
2984697,drlee,2014-07-10 20:11:00,409,"Traveled 599 mid june and into early july. Went further north than savant. No construction; road in very good shape; few rough spots along the shoulder, as usual. Your trip should be smooth...as usual, be careful: Lots of moose, bears this year. Have a safe trip and good fishing!"
