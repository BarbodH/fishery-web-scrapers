2898153,SinOrSwim,2014-06-14 21:26:00,1528,"We go in the fall and one of the reasons is to go when the bugs aren't bad. However, we were in northern MN many years ago and I remember these big black flies ( I always called them horse flies) that would bite and draw blood! You could be in the water getting ready to water ski and they would land on your head and bite you. Hurt like a $!@%@$#$@#"
2898393,Skywagon,2014-06-15 05:47:00,1106,"SinOrSwim, there are many things in the north country that like your blood, I have not had too much trouble with horseflies, but deer flies are something else. The deer fly especially seems attracted to your head for some reason, though they will feast anywhere. We have used sticky patches that you can attach to your hat, when the deer flies are out in full force, I have seen the sticky patch completely coated with deer flies. We have not seen any deer flies yet this year, but before long they will be with us again. Here are some pictures of what they look like.

2972889,Skywagon,2014-07-07 15:37:00,1106,"It just occurred to me to post a picture of what black fly bites (not the big ankle biters you encounter in the boat) look like https://www.dropbox.com/s/kd2w4up0mr...ly%20bites.jpg. Most of these bites are from 9 days ago, as you see, they take forever to go away. This picture is of the top of my ankle, but I also have them in other exposed areas, neck, face, arms. The black flies on the trail to the outpost camp were still awful as of yesterday (they landed in hoards), a bug suit was a necessity. Don't leave your deet at home this year if you wander into the bush, the bugs are about as bad as you will see."

2975369,stevensinks,2014-07-08 09:31:00,330,OK I looked up Black Fly's. It seems that there over 1700 different kinds around the world. MN has over 30 different kinds . I didn't find how many kinds Canada has. So I can see why there is confusion about what is what. I also looked up No See Ems which are also called Sand Flees which I didn't know. They seem to be very much like Chiggers. I didn't find what the little fly is that isn't a blood sucker but seems to be a meat eater is. When they get you they seem to just bite a chunk out of you and it bleeds. Anyone know what Im talking about ?
2877809,Skywagon,2014-06-08 16:41:00,1106,"The black flies I am referring too are not chiggers, the chiggers I am familiar with are a red color, these look similar to a very-very small fly (note the size), only you get a nasty reaction after they bite, similar to the chigger. http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/black_fly.aspx Sounds like perfect spraying weather Pooch (put your pontoons on).

Is this a chigger? We have horse flies that bite real hard down here in Pennsylvania, but it was harder than that. It just kinda rolled up on me, solo, and just looked to land to intentionally bite me as I retied shoe along river. I had dead chubs on me for catfish that attracted loads of black flies, but this was smaller than them.

There are two widely recognized definitions of ""chigger,"" the scientific (or taxonomic) definition and the common definitions found in English and medical[4] dictionaries. According to most dictionaries, the several species of Trombiculidae that bite their host in their larval stage and cause ""intense irritation""[5] or ""a wheal, usually with severe itching and dermatitis,""[6][7] are called chiggers.""""The larvae, commonly called chiggers, are about 0.170.21 mm (0.0070.008 in) in diameter, normally light red in color, and covered in hairs; they move quickly relative to size. The larvae congregate in groups on small clods of earth, in matted vegetation and even on low bushes and plants, where they have more access to prospective hosts. The larval stage is the only parasitic stage of the mite's life cycle. They are parasites on many animals. About 30 of the many species in this family, in their larval stage, attach to various animals and feed on skin. This often causes an intensely itchy, red bump in humans (who are accidental hosts).""The larvae that feed on you are .007-.008 in. in diameter. No wonder I never see 'em!"

2879473,jigman 2003,2014-06-09 05:58:00,981,"It surprises to me to see how few fishermen who visit Canada know what blackflies are. They were thick here in central MN about 2 weeks ago. My legs just stopped itching a few days ago. I usually encounter them when I'm working in the woods/fields in tall grass/short brush (same places I get ticks). You don't feel them biting due to some anesthetic they use...but you sure feel the bites itching for a long time after. The ankle biting flies I've always called lake flies. Probably not the correct name for them, but they're a totally different critter than a blackfly. Neither is any fun. Lake flies you feel the bite immediately and the itch is pretty short lived. Blackflies you don't feel the bite at all and the itch lasts forever."
2897465,walleyeduran,2014-06-14 15:39:00,286,"Jigman, those smaller house fly like looking ankle biters you call lake flyies are called fish flyies up in the Ashland, WI area. The little black flyies look more like a large knat."
2898009,jaym,2014-06-14 20:17:00,89,"So now it's established that black flies are the small gnat like bug that leaves huge welts and not the ones that bite your ankles out in the boat, does Coppertone Sport help stop the black flies?"
2898025,Mike Borger,2014-06-14 20:24:00,1554,"Everyone has a different name for them, I've always called them flesh flies. Regardless they're all satan's spawn LOL!One time paddling in Quetico on a cloudless warm bluebird day a huge pack of them took refuge in my canoe. Every time I lifted my arms to paddle 10 would land on my back and start biting. Repellent did nothing only layers of clothing and it was 90 degrees that day.In frustration I squirted deet all over the inside of my boat hoping that would deter them. It didn't faze the flies, but 15 minutes later the gelcoat on the inside of my canoe started to dissolve and melt LOL!I dumped everything out and tipped my canoe over to halt the process, but I can safely say the bugs beat me that day.It was only midday and I had ground to cover but I pitched my tent and crawled inside for the rest of the day.On many of my really long solo canoe trips I amused myself by learning how to kill the speedy little devils by hand. When one landed near me I'd slowly distract it by moving one of my hands in front of its face about a foot away. They would be entranced by the decoy hand and I'd lazily squish them with the other. Stupid flies. Great fun!"
2874601,Carnhzkr,2014-06-07 08:12:00,964,"The ""black flies"" you guys are talking about - do you mean those pesky ankle biters that get in your boat and you can't get rid of no matter how fast you go? To me, black flies are something different. The only time I've encountered what I call black flies was in the NWT fishing from the bank one day. Didn't even know I was getting bitten until I was back at camp and saw 6 or 7 red bumps around my waist. Worst itch I ever had and took weeks to go away. I was drinking coffee with my wife this morning and talking about what to bring to keep those ankle biters at bay this year. Coppertone spray, huh?"
2875209,lassh,2014-06-07 14:05:00,553,Yes- I'm talking about the ankle biters. What you had on your waist sounds like chiggers. Sometimes No-see-ums can leave welts for a couple weeks on some people but you can usually feel them biting.
2875833,rdbalmer,2014-06-07 20:07:00,279,"I'm with you on what is actually called a black fly. I consider the little gnats that want to dive straight in your eye or go up your nose a black fly. The flies that chew your ankles are entirely a different bug. Both are absolutely terrible but some how we as fishermen are able to overlook them to a point as long as we are in Canada beating up on the walleyes. The coppertone sport 50 aerosol is the only thing I have found that will keep the ""ankle biters"" off short of high top boots. As far as the black flies a head net is the only thing I have found that actually works. When they bite you it is almost like a BB under the skin that itches for days if not weeks. Now another bug called no see umms is all together another story. The are the worst little Ba!!!!tards I have ever seen. They will go right through a normal window screen and chew you up while you sleep. I found that a mosquito coil burned in the cabin will greatly reduce them. Not the best as they recommend the are only to be used in well ventilated areas but we always have the windows open and have never suffered any ill effects from them in over 25 years. I'd definitely recommend them over the bites you will get if you don't use them."
2876129,Pooch,2014-06-08 00:07:00,4619,"I kind of like the smell of mosquito coils.... to me it signals my brain that I'm fishing and not working.Seriously, we always burn part of a coil and not the whole thing. Usually light it before we leave the cabin for the evening fishing and it is out when we return. As long as some joker doesn't linger coming in and out of the door that usually takes care of the biting critters. On occasion we'll burn a three or four inch part of a coil as we go to bed for any escapees.For ankle biters we spray our socks and tennis shoes in the boat with Deet products. Also, have been known to wear light weight boots when the biters are really bad. I also spray my boony hat with Deet and that seems to keep the mosquitoes off my face.I think the coils seem to keep the no see 'ems to a minimum in the cabin, too. Worst place for no see 'ems we have seen is in Eluthera. Chewed up my wife bad. Looked like she had the measles. These bugs in Canada are armatures compared to the ones in the tropical areas.There is a difference in coils. The scented ones? Leave them at home as the suck, plus they stink! Get the Coghlan brand and if you see it, get the coil holder from the same manufacture as it allows you to burn parts or broken coils safely.We've never had a problem burning coils in the cabin health wise. Then again we rarely ever burn morn than half a coil at a time and then we are nearly always out fishing and just flushing mosquitoes out before we come back in for the night. Most cabins are ""loose"" enough to not worry about leaving a window open. The smoke from them tends to rise above us. I'd hate to burn a coil in one of the nice cabins that some camps now have. The smell would never come out of furniture, drapes or carpet. Coils can start a fire so be careful where you burn them. Some folks I know learned that lesson years ago. DA's....Pooch"

2877185,Skywagon,2014-06-08 12:46:00,1106,"Black flies are not ankle biters, nor are they chiggers or no-see-ums, they are a totally different beast. They are what Carnhzkr encountered, very small like a gnat, the effect of their bite can last for a few days, they do not seem to be around when you are on the lake, mostly in or on the edge of the bush. They are out now, but not too bad so far. They seem to be gone, or at least fewer by mid July. If you ever get bit by a bunch of them you won't forget what a black fly is. I am in the firewood cutting mode now, if anyone wants to come help, I will gladly point out a black fly, just to help you out in identification."
2877273,JayM5209,2014-06-08 13:44:00,1050,"Sounds like chiggers to me. I got one bite on my forehead week before last, and I've had the same two or three times in the past. They get me right at the hatband - like they can't crawl any further so they go to dining. They may have gotten blocked at your belt line and then chowed down. It's taken two weeks for the welt to go away. The intense itch only lasted four or five days.Google ""chigger."" It's interesting reading. They're about the size of the period at the end of this sentence . . . and they are not the same as no-seeums. The chiggers feed on skin of humans or animals. They don't eat the outer layer, but chew in to the 2nd layer of skin. The huge welt and intense itch is caused by some protein in the little buggers saliva. I've never been aware of a chigger biting me, that is, not until the itch begins and the welt is well formed. The little monsters provide an agony greatly disproportionate to their size!"

2871761,Explorer,2014-06-05 21:16:00,873,Stock some latex rubber gloves in your boat. Use them for applying sunscreen. When your done pull one glove off and put it in the palm of your other hand that still has the glove on it. Pull that one off turning the glove inside out with first glove inside. You can now put it in a pocket to dispose of later. Sunscreen gets on nothing but the skin you applied it to.
2871809,mswope13,2014-06-05 21:22:00,73,Great idea on the application for the Coppertone. This stuff worked miracles on our last 2 trips! Black flies cannot stand this stuff!

We used coppertone sport in the spray bottle and it was very effective against black flies. We found the spray more convenient application than the lotion. Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent has done a good job against flies too but is not as long lasting.
2872441,big popi,2014-06-06 07:56:00,635,"I took the advice I got from WC last year on our trip to Canada to use the Coppertone Sport spray for the black flies. The black flies have been my nemesis for years now. We usually go up late in July which is prime fly time. I tried everything from deet to even spraying Raid Flying Insect (blue can) right on the boat & my legs. I must say that the Coppertone absolutely works. You will need to reapply once every hour or so, but it does keep the flies off me."
