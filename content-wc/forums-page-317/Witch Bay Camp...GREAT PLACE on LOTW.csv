2977081,KM1,2014-07-08 19:00:00,374,"Just got back from Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods. I have fished LOTW since I was a kid...took the 16 hour trip from the Chicago area many, many times. Been to other lakes and places in Canada...even a remote fly in trip out of Red Lake. I have to say that Witch Bay Camp is the best...with unmatched hospitality and food. Add to that the fishing on LOTW...well...it's awesome. Even with the high water levels this year in that area, and the craziness that caused with trying to determine dispersal and fishing patterns, we had a 300 - 400 walleye catching fishing trip with 5 fish topping the 28"" mark. The largest was a whopping 30"" 10.5lb Canadian behemoth. Some pics of our most recent LOTW trip...will be looking to beat this next year. We shall see :-)!!!"
2977241,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-08 19:47:00,1460,"Great trip KM1! Well done finding the big gals with all that water. 5 fish over 28"" between 2 guys is pretty dang impressive under the circumstances! Is that the Fight Doctor in the fuzzy hat and plaid pants. Lol. I shouldn't be laughing too hard, my brother wears a cowboy hat with purple crocs in the boat. Nice fish, nice report. Now the long wait till next year."
2977401,KM1,2014-07-08 20:05:00,374,That is my bro...the fight doctor!!! He did awesome...there were two days in the boat where he was out fishing me like 4 fish to 1...maybe more. The difference...he was using one hook size up than I was...and for some reason this allowed him to keep out of snags better...and we were Lindy Rigging some VERY snag infested areas. I spent most of my time on those days re-tieing or maneuvering the boat so I could release my snag.
2977825,mrmusky14,2014-07-08 22:10:00,148,"KM1 sounds like a great trip, I am heading there at the end of the month, what was working for you and did you fish for anything other than walleye? This will be my fourth time there and I agree it is great place with great people, was the water starting to come down at all?"
2978265,KM1,2014-07-09 06:39:00,374,"the water is still very high...and still rising. Rain and storms have pounded them. The first week I was there we had a storm so bad it broke the dock...WHILE I WAS IN MY BOAT AT THE END OF THE DOCK AND MY BROTHER WAS ON THE DOCK NEXT TO THE BOAT. He goes ""the dock broke"" as we saw the dock bending from the waves and bad winds. I released the boat from the dock and waited the storm out in the bay. Those winds continued for 2 days straight...like 50mph gusts too.This type of weather is thwarting the ability of the open dams to get the water back down. And the high water made fishing much more unpredictable for this time of year.Now, most years...bouncing with spinner crawler harnesses worked good for locating fish and when fish were spread out over larger areas. When concentrated...jig and leach or crawler.However, this year...bouncing with crawler harnesses didn't seem to produce well. Fish just seemed to be off their normal patterns for this time of year. We then switched to bouncing with slow death hooks and smiley blades and partial crawler. Presented this at about .7 to 1.0 mph (slower than crawler harness presentation).Yet...still not producing that many fish...nor large fish. Slowed down even further using Lindy Rigs and leech. This was the ticket for our first week as 4 of our 5 large fish came with this presentation. Lindy Rigs out fished all other presentations for us that first week.The second week, toward the end, the better bite moved away from lindy rigs w/leeches to crawlers...and to those slow death smiley blade rigs. Toward the end of our trip we had a 70 walleye day and 100 walleye day's with ALL fish off this rig. This second week this presentation outproduced Lindy Rigs...plus, we were able to cover more water than with Lindy's.That's the scoop on what worked for us :-)!!!"

2980529,fishinnut 3446,2014-07-09 15:25:00,638,"KM1, Your brother looks just like Lacky from Jimmy big time!"
2980761,KM1,2014-07-09 16:57:00,374,and didn't think he looks like Lackey...but I know what he looks like under that hat. Plus...not sure I will tell him that...wouldn't want to end up as a guinea pig sparring partner for one of his fighters in the octagon...LOL!!!
