As mentioned - the water was the highest we have ever seen it (and the same was mentioned by the locals). We had to run an ""obstacle course"" out on this area of Lac Seul - due to all the floating logs/trees that the high water has displaced. Be careful."
2944689,fisher_i_am,2014-06-27 21:25:00,498,A little worried the eyes won't be on normal mid lake humps during the second week in July on lac suel. Any thoughts.... Last year I had the same worry but all was good. How for behind are the lake/fish and how dies it compare to last year.
2944905,kzoofisher,2014-06-28 01:53:00,5144,Don't know about LS but everything around here is back on schedule so I would think it would be the same there in three weeks.
2945825,Lambertson Rock Guy,2014-06-28 12:24:00,20,"Just got back from the Ear Falls end of Lac Seul. Lots of fish still in the Wenasaga sanctuary and Sawmill Bay which are two notorious early season spots so I would say things are a little behind. Water temps were slowly increasing so with some nice weather things will ""even out"" soon. We did more jig fishing this year. For us a slow presentation was the ticket compared to pulling spinners/cranks. I wouldn't worry too much. Seems like we need to fish different areas/spots each year due to when the majority of the spawn occurred and water depths/temps. Lots of floating debris/logs with the high water. We also dodged a section of what looked like a dock so be careful. Its an incredible fishery. Probably why so many of us go back every year."
2964258,fisher_i_am,2014-07-04 08:01:00,498,Any recent updates here.... I leave in a week but it's going to feel like a month. Thanks
2964306,Live to jig,2014-07-04 08:19:00,159,2 weeks ago we were north on Nakina....they were a full 2 weeks behind normal patterns...very spread out and not that aggressive. Very catchable but very few of our normal hot spots held fish. We found the active ones on wind blown shores.

Any thoughts.... Last year I had the same worry but all was good. How for behind are the lake/fish and how dies it compare to last year. They are there now, on the main lake humps. But you can still catch fish in < 10 feet of water gorging on may fly nymphs. To say they are scattered is an understatement. Been an interesting year. Water temps are low(ish) at 62 main lake, 66 back bays. Overall fishing has been great."
2968705,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-06 10:26:00,241,"My wife and I stayed at Indian Lake Lodge ( always a pleasure) May 24- June 10th, water temps were 42 degrees when we got there, and it was 63 degrees when we left, it was 70- 88 degrees outside temps the whole time we were there. Crazy fishing, the walleyes were spawning, but didn't experience the post spawn blues. The fish stayed up and were hit'n anything that swims, cranks, jigs, rigs, etc, they too, were probably sick of the Polar vortex, but, the heat also brought the skitters, and they were not only huge, but, aggressive!! everyone in camp caught a personal best walleye AND they ALL were released !! It's great to fish with that kind of fishermen, we eat the small guys and take pictures and release the BIG GIRLS Good fishing to all !!"
2978065,fisher_i_am,2014-07-09 04:57:00,498,Any updates here for Lac Seul and Minitaki?.... Leaving Friday and my itch is at its peak.Thanks
2979569,CMesserschmidt,2014-07-09 12:01:00,1006,"Just got back on Monday. We caught a crap load of walleyes on the main lake areas we fished last year which was in August. I believe you won't have a problem finding fish on the main lake humps. In fact a couple of the days it's the only place we could find them as they went shallow to deep in a matter of hours.No mayflys from what I saw, no army worms either. Chart, jigs with a minnow was the ticket for us.We even long lined #4 salmo hornets and caught a few in 17 feet of water which was a different approach from what we're used to. Also the Smallmouth haven't spawned yet either. We caught a ton of them and I felt bad as the ones we did keep were full of eggs still. Granted this was on big vermillion. Also Got a legal lake trout out of Big Vermillion as well that was full of eggs. If I would have know they were full of eggs I would have let them go. I figured they were done by now. Lake trout were in more or less in the 85 ft range right on bottom. Flutter spoons on a 3 way with a 4 ounce weight.Word of caution on Big Vermillion, if you're not familiar with the lake I would take it easy. The water level is high and some rocks that are the size of houses which are normally sticking out of the water a bit are under water by maybe a foot."
2979785,oldccm,2014-07-09 12:33:00,109,Lake trout spawn in the fall. Very common to find them with eggs in the summer. As long as the catch was legal don't sweat it. Where I fish season closes in fall and reopens Jan 1.
