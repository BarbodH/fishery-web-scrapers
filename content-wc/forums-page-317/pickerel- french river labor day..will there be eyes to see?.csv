Walleye are much better in spring than later -- we always struggled in July/August because of migratory patterns. Typically, you'd have to travel to the French River (locations about 45 - 90 minutes away) to get a good shot at walleye. We always did well with bass and pike though at all times. I've also made the trip to the French a few times -- it's not bad haul and great scenery (just bring extra gas)."
