Is there any difference between the two cabelas? Is highway 169 a good road? I will be pulling a boat with the family so thought i would ask for having always taken I35 to 33 then to 53. Though we would try some different sights this year. Thanks"

And, that portion adds quite a bit of time. But, we go up, stay the night at his house, load the trailer etc. But, if you take 169 all the way to 53 I have no idea how many hours extra it adds but it is significant."

Compare your routes using mapquest or google maps. If you're going to go to Rogers Cabelas I'd take this route: From Rogers Cabelas take 101 north to 169. 169 around Mille Lacs to Garrison, 6 through Deerwood, Crosby, Emily etc to 71 at Big Falls. 71 to International Falls. 101/169 is 4 lanes to just south of Mille Lacs. From there on it's 2 lane road, but they're good and more scenic than I-35. Google maps shows the Rogers/101/169/6/71 route adding about 5 miles/40 minutes compared to I-35. You can take the faster I-35 route on the way back."

2981377,MorganMan,2014-07-09 20:48:00,341,"The cabelas at Roger is a nice store but seems to be out of quite of few things when I go there, it is shopped hard. As far as taking 169 vs I35 to Ifalls/Fort Frances, the quickest way is up I 35, but if you want something different, 169 is ok. We take off from 169 and jump over to I35 because its faster than going through small towns etc. If you have the time, do what you want!!"
