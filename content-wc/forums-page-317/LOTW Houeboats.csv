2981201,MN_Moose,2014-07-09 19:55:00,964,LOTW is a huge area. What area are you planning to visit?
2981681,eyekeeper,2014-07-10 00:50:00,49,"open to suggestions, I would assume the Canada side?"
2981745,Obabikon,2014-07-10 04:53:00,2370,"As always, I suggest Morson. Morson Marina has house boats, with reasonable rates. http://wildernesshouseboats.com/ Awesome fishing areas... quite remote. There's a nice camp in the area that is happy to help out if a houseboat needs anything! lol All kidding aside, its a very good area."
2984641,MN_Moose,2014-07-10 19:58:00,964,Kenora has some house boats. You would probably head south to the barrier islands. Find a bay and anchor up as base camp. Some houseboats out of Sioux Narrows also. You would head out past Whitefish narrows & Yellow Girl point.

2986841,Knutson21,2014-07-11 15:06:00,348,We use floating lodges out of sioux narrows and absolutely love it. We park the houseboat 6 hours out from sioux narrows and work our way back a little every couple of days. It depends on where you fish weather a houseboat or resort is best for your situation.
