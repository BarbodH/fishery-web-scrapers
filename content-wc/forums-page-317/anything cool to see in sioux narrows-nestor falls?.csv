2979609,SinOrSwim,2014-07-09 12:06:00,1528,We will be heading up in early august and this will be the first time in a LONG time going this route. We will probably have some time to burn. Anything for me and my 9 year old to see in the Sioux NArrows/Nestor Falls area? Bait shop?
2979713,Aaron-IN,2014-07-09 12:24:00,500,Not really but you could browse the Narrrows gift shop and get ice cream for the kid.
2979897,Carnhzkr,2014-07-09 12:47:00,964,"Not NF or SN, but on your route to Hawk Lake you will pass by Rushing River Provincial Park. Normally, this is a really cool waterfall / rapids and you can climb the rocks up and down the falls. With water as high as it is though, The big boulders might be underwater."
2980009,LundDriver,2014-07-09 13:10:00,30,"Hopefully the weather is nice so you can sit by the ""airport"" and watch the floatplanes come and go. If your boy is into planes, but what nine year old isn't."
2980057,bigwalleye1,2014-07-09 13:20:00,2632,"If your path takes you up 71 to I falls, The little town of Big Falls has a little park on the west side of the road with some awesome rapids at the bridge, can be a nice ""part way"" stop for a leg strech before the last run to the Falls. The rapids are roaring right now, and if rains any more, it'll be that way for a while. the suse at the gas station in town can be pretty entertaining as well."
2980113,LOW1,2014-07-09 13:30:00,2828,"http://bwca.cc/historical/manitoumounds.htm This place is just west of ""The Junction"" where Highway 71 turns north to Nestor Falls. There is a fishing museum/visitor center in Sioux Narrows which is worth checking out. If you get north of SN, Rushing River Provincial Park is seriously cool, especially for nine year olds."
2980121,port1042,2014-07-09 13:33:00,509,"Right below the dam in Nestor Falls (west side of highway) is a nice park and some easy fishing from shore. We stay in Nestor Falls on our way north and spend an hour or so after dinner to warm up our skills with some perch, walleyes, and smallies from this park. If your looking for a bait shop try Angles Pro Shop on the north end of Nestor Falls."
2980385,SinOrSwim,2014-07-09 14:46:00,1528,Is that Northwest Flying Inc I see on google maps? Nestor Falls area?Thanks for the ideas. He will definitely like some of these. Much depends on how much time we have but as of now I have us leaving early enough in am to be able to stop and let him see some stuff.
2982017,Aaron-IN,2014-07-10 06:53:00,500,"Yep, that is Northwest Flying on the right hand side of the road coming into Nestor Falls, good peeps to."
2982097,deadhead1,2014-07-10 07:28:00,193,really cool gift shop at north end of Sioux Narrows. Not sure if the 9 year old will like it though. Have to stop at rushing river.
