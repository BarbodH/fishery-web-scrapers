529543,Jigger1,2003-04-09 07:58:00,234,"Fourth annual trip the last weekend in June to the south central part of LacSeul - Silver Water Wheel Lodge - hoping to break the 30"" barrier this year!"
529544,Codydawg,2003-04-09 14:11:00,14,This will be my 18th year at Mahkwa in the central portion of the lake. I would like to learn more about the north central--west of us--part of the lake. I believe that is where Black Bay is--correct? We like to explore a little and it would be great to see a new area.
529545,Mike KS,2003-04-10 12:34:00,18,"Codydawg, Actually Mahkwa and Black Bay are not that far apart. When we fish out Black Bay we see a lot of boats from Mahkwa especially in Aldous Bay. Black bay is on the North Shore at the very beginning of Aldous Bay. When are you going to be at Mahkwa this year?"
529546,Winnie,2003-04-11 08:52:00,375,We are going up to Goose Bay Memorial Day weekend. Hope the water is soft.
529547,Winnie,2003-04-11 08:55:00,375,Anyone have any ice reports? Long range weather forecasts?
529548,Eric,2003-04-11 09:15:00,114,Going to Scout Lake Resort beginning July 4th weekend for a week.I've been reading all the posts about how good Lac Seul is & all you guys have talked me into making my first trip up there this year. Can't wait!!!
529549,Guest,2003-04-11 11:26:00,0,"Eric, be careful on the lake up there.Those rocks are unforgiving.You could be in 40 ft. of water and then 2 ft. Most of the Islands have rock shelves coming out from them.I tried to tell my son-inlaw 2 yrs. ago but he didnt want to listen.He had to learn the hard way 1 broken prop and a bent skagg.To say the least he isnt my fishing partner up there anymore.I took him to a Northern hole the first day BIG MISTAKE.He didnt want to fish for Walleyes at all.I dont want to cast all day like him, I like to split it up.Have a great trip. Catch and release the big ones so someone else can catch there dream fish."
529532,Guest,2003-04-07 13:35:00,0,Hi im heading up to lac seul at the june. I will be staying at white wing resort. It seems like a lot of guys are going to lac seul/ear falls area. I was just wondering who else was heading up there. So I can get information if you stay there before I go. Thanks
529533,Guest,2003-04-07 16:29:00,0,"We will be up there last week in July,staying at Lac Seul Lodge about 20 miles south of Ear Falls.Then we boat 30 miles across to BlackBay Outpost.Its a cabin that sits back in the Bay by itself.We pretty much have that section of the lake to ourselves.This will be my 4th yr. there and it doesnt get any better than this.Remember catch and release the big ones so someone else can catch there Dream fish."
529534,Guest,2003-04-07 23:00:00,0,Ia Dan. Saw your post about staying at Lac Seul Lodge in Jly. We will be there in July as well. Tell me about Black Bear Bay or whereever that is you discused in your post.email [email protected]
529535,Guest,2003-04-08 10:58:00,0,"Going to Evergreen in Ear Falls for opener and again in mid august. We will go a few days before opener if the weather is decent and fish for northern, last years opener was cold and snowy but lots of large walleye."
529536,Mike KS,2003-04-08 11:31:00,18,"IA DAN, We will be at Black Bear the second week in June. Been going there for so long that the first time we went Dan didnt own it. The cabin has improved immensely since the early days and that is because Dan is a #1 host. Last years fishing might have been the best we ever had there and our group is chomping at the bit to get back. Send me your email address and I will give you a update when we get back [email protected]"
529537,Guest,2003-04-08 11:55:00,0,I'm going to Evergreen in June also. I will be there for a couple weeks starting the middle of the second week of June. Really looking forward to it. The fishing is always good.
529538,Guest,2003-04-08 15:15:00,0,I was curious as to where white wing resort is.
529539,2 DOGS,2003-04-08 15:24:00,361,"Whitewing is about 5 miles south of Ear Falls on 105. Nice place, run by nice people."
