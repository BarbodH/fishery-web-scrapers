Anyone else have experience with fly-ins, we are looking for Northern Pike with walleyes a second choice for meals.Anyone get to any of the other lakes that Air Ivanhoe uses.Thanks"

Give me some more details on what fishing success you had at Rush. Our cabin and the service was fine - just didn't get the fishing we have experienced at other fly ins.
