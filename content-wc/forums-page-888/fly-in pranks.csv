529194,Guest,2003-04-10 10:40:00,0,What about the old someone lifted all are booze trick! It takes some timing and some work but what a guy does is come in just an hour after everybody has been out in the morning and take all the beer&booze from the remote lake cabin and stash it in the woods. Of course keeping at least a case in a cooler on ice as so you dont **** yourself after the morning adventure. I do this the second morning so as you can imagine in are group i need a wheelbarrel. Boy does that get a group going!!!!!!

529180,River_eye,2003-03-31 16:05:00,1486,"well, there's always the floor covered in dixie cups filled with water trick, as long as it's not your room as well."

529182,Guest,2003-03-31 22:53:00,0,"This did not happen to me....but a buddy of mine tells this story. They were on a fly-in at Lake Athabaska..SK. The camp had just had a bear roll through and everyone was pretty wary. My buddy is in the outhouse taking a dump and he hears some noise outside the outhouse. No one answers when he calls out so he expect the worse...a bear. He kicks the outhouse door open does not see anything. Kicks it open one more time and the guide that was staying with them at the camp sticks the camp ""bear head"" into the outhouse door opening. My buddy jerks his head back....hits it on the back of the outhouse wall... nearly passes out from hitting his head so hard. The next thing he know he is rolling around in the sand infront of the outhouse, his pants and underware at his ankles and to top it off....he had not finished the paperwork after his dump. I know I am not doing the story justice...but everytime Ronnie tells this story... we are in tears and nearly pissing our pants."
529183,Guest,2003-04-01 13:53:00,0,What about the old suran wrap just under the toilet seat trick at night.
529184,Stevie B,2003-04-01 14:42:00,157,"One great one that I have enjoyed...You take the boat plug out of your buddies boat and put it in from the back. Then take some good small rope and tie it too the plug and use about 50'. Then tie the other end to the dock!!! Besure that you have an extra plug in your boat to give to him. But not right away let him sweat a bit, when your 1/2 hour away from camp!Fish ON!!"
529187,Guest,2003-04-01 15:51:00,0,"You've done your last fly-in with me, son!"
529188,phidelt157,2003-04-01 16:46:00,191,just tryin' to get a heads up for the next time!
529185,Thumper,2003-04-01 21:22:00,133,"SEEMS like a good idea, but......wouldn't the rope get caught up in the propeller?"
529186,Stevie B,2003-04-02 09:23:00,157,You would think that it would. But it never did. We would put a couple of weights on the rope to keep it down. Every time the plug was at the other end of the rope. But just in case we always had an extra plug around.Fish ON!!
