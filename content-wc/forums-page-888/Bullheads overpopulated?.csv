529562,IaCraig,2003-04-08 20:02:00,434,"I have never heard of bullheads ruining a river, maybe a pond or small lake. In many lakes in Iowa you have to use artificial bait once the water warms up because the bullheads bother so much. I know people who claim flathead catfish eat lots of bullheads, so maybe if you have flatheads in your river you should practice catch and release?IaCraig"
529563,Guest,2003-04-08 20:07:00,0,Our river and lake seem to be filled with bullheads. They fill parts of the river n looks like black oil in the river. I don't know if it means there overpopulated but they are abundent.
529559,Soolkyut,2003-04-08 21:45:00,60,"I'm fishing the La Salle river, its a smaller one that empties into the red. It runs through LaBarriere park."
529550,Soolkyut,2003-04-07 14:25:00,60,"I live in LaSalle, just south of Winnipeg Manitoba and I have been fishing in the river there my whole life, all we ever catch is bullheads with celebrations going around for the odd channel cat or pike. We even caught a pickerel once, my friends seem to think that the bullheads are ruining the fishery cause there are so darn many of em. I agree that the number has risen in recent years. They have taken to slaughtering all bullheads caught, will this actually help or are they just sadisitic basterds."
529551,IaDave,2003-04-07 15:05:00,476,Let the Iowa bashing begin.
529552,Guest,2003-04-07 15:10:00,0,Even if it doesn't affect the fishiery. Its sure fun to kill the little guys. I live next to a river and a lake in iowa. When the bullheads bite we usally play bullhead baseball fun game.
529553,Guest,2003-04-07 16:55:00,0,"I leave them alone now and just throw them back. When I was a kid some people used to throw them on the docks and like an idiot I would come along and stomp on the slightly dried ones until finally the dorsal fin pierced my runner and my foot. Ended up with a nasty infection. Took to making submarines out of the live ones after that. When I finally decided to grow up they got treated like any other released fish, a quick flick of the wrist and the barbless hook generally slips out. Don't kill anything anymore unless I am planning on eating it or using it for a useful purpose."
529554,zzlaw,2003-04-07 18:04:00,34,"Soolkyut - where do you get this many bullheads? - I'd love to catch them - nothing and I mean nothing tastes better than bullheads - and Iowa Boy for your ""fishiery"" in ""iowa"" do you ""usualy"" use a rod or do you try to catch them by hand like the dim caveman you are? - and aren't caveman too dim and uncoordinated to play baseball? - don't waste or abuse fish - zzlaw"
529555,Guest,2003-04-07 19:32:00,0,"Hey lay off iowa boy he's just a kid. When we were kids i did the same thing, now a days bullheads arn't my sought after fish. When were were kids we would fish cats carp n bullheads in our river. We would realse the cats, n have fun killin the carp n bull heads."
529560,River Rat,2003-04-07 21:37:00,43,"All bullhead species seem to disappear as the river backwaters degrade. It's too bad, fun for kids and good eating.If I'm not mistaken, one of the three bullhead species is endangered in Iowa. I think it is the black bullhead. Hopefully someone puts that ball bat somewhere that the sun doesn't shine."
529557,Soolkyut,2003-04-08 06:33:00,60,"I'm from Mantioba Canada, and the bullheads in my river don't get eaten cause most of the time they got worms like a mad man. We used to catch bullheads off the bridge in town which is fairly high off the water, instead of pulling them all the way up to get them off the hook we would bungee jump them and try to shake em loose. That was a long time ago though, now I just toss em back. Mine are the lucky ones."
529558,zzlaw,2003-04-08 10:03:00,34,Soolkyut I'm from western Canada too fish Manitoba all the time - are you fishing the Red? - the Assiniboine? - you can be specific as I fish all these areas - and I love the bullies - Larry
529556,zzlaw,2003-04-08 10:07:00,34,"dave - please take the ""caveman"" comments initially made in reference to iowa boy and apply them to yourself - iowa boy's behaviour shouldn't be defended - it is never acceptable to abuse or waste fish or wildlife - zzlaw"
