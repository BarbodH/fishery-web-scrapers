529098,Guest,2003-04-10 04:24:00,0,"Eye Wish -Just like any lakes, the fishing can be up and down, depending on the conditions. However, I will say that on the whole, we have had excellent walleye and smallmouth fishing, both in numbers and size. Catch and Release really works. I have had days where I lost count after 75 smallmouth from 3lbs and up. Other years, they were deeper, and much more difficult to catch.Ross' have 2 outpost cabins that you can boat to. Both are approx. 25 miles from the base camp. One cabin is on Jackfish lake, which is quite large,and there are a few other cabins. The other cabin straddles a ridge between Jackfish and Ottertail lake. I don't know of any other cabins on Ottertail, although we've seen guys from the other camps on Jackfish portage into Otteratail. This year, my group is taking both cabins. We can't wait!!!!"

Great rates,restaurant, bar, 2hrs from Kenora, 30min. from Nestor Falls. Think they have special rates for fishermen. They are also holding a Walleye Seminar with Mark Martin, Mike Gofron, Mark Brumbaugh, Gord Pyzer on May 15th 2003 starts at 6pm."

529090,BD,2003-04-01 06:09:00,739,We used to stop there for breakfast on our way up to Sioux Narrows. There was this little French waitress; the kind of girl dreams are made of. I think the food was OK.
529091,Guest,2003-04-06 07:51:00,0,"Yeah, pwt pros will be at the Emo Inn on the 15th of May this year. starting about 5;30 in the evening. As said before by filip, Emo Inn is west of Fort Frances about 20 minutes. They will be staying there from the 15th til the 20th, so if your driving by, stop by and maybe catch them there having coffee or breakfast, supper. And good luck to rest of PWT field fishing Baudette tournament."
529094,Guest,2003-04-06 11:48:00,0,"We have never stayed at the Emo Inn, but have had breakfast there many times before heading to our base camp, and have always been very satisfied. Plenty of good food, and the service is friendly and efficient. The owner used to own the camp that we go to, and he is a very friendly and informative guy. My 2Â¢ worth......."
529089,zzlaw,2003-04-06 12:40:00,34,DJDavey - Emo seems good enough for everyone including the PWT but not you - what do you do? - commute from the Fort Garry Hotel in downtown Winnipeg or maybe the Royal York in downtown Toronto - hope you have lots of money for gas - my reaction to your useless post - Thanks - But NO Thanks - and to all the other guys thanks for the great info - I'll sure be stopping there when I'm in the area - it sounds like one of those hidden tresures - hope the French waitress is still there - Larry
