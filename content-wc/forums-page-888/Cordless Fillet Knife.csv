529513,Guest,2003-04-07 07:31:00,0,Has anbody out there used one of the new cordless electric fillet knives? And if so what are your opinions on them?I was looking at one at Walmart for $44 dollars and I am wondering if they are worth the $$
529514,Kilroy,2003-04-07 12:28:00,59,"I purchased one at Cabellas last year to take to Canada and was really satisfied with it. It is an Angelers Best, it came with a 110v charging cord, but I bought the 12 volt charging cord to go with it. I would leave it hooked up in the truck while we were fishing, and seemed to always be charged up when we came back in. The charge was always good for our 3 limits,lol. It sliced right through the backbones really well, after a few practice Bass here at home, it was really easy to use. I still use my regular fillet knife for Pike y-bones tho, as I am no surgeon with the electric one,lol. Here is a picture of the one I have, good luck.http://www.2catchfish.com/store/info.php/id/717Kilroy"
529515,Guest,2003-04-07 20:51:00,0,how long does an actual charge last- im going on a flyin and no charging will be possible-is it worth it ??thanks
529516,Kilroy,2003-04-08 04:05:00,59,"Well, they say it will last about 45 min, which is a great plenty if you have a charger. I think I would stick to a good fillet knife and a stone if I were you. I liked it because it went right through a pike, but We usually have a generator along as well as the 12 volt charger, so it has never been a problem.Kilroy"
