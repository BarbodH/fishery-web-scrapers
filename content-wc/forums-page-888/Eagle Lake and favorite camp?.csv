529653,fishmaster,2003-04-08 16:33:00,209,Will be headed for Eagle Lake and Vermilion Bay Lodge for the openning week this season. Looking to see how others like Eagle Lake and when they are headed there.
529654,Guest,2003-04-09 08:04:00,0,We always head to Eagle in early June. We always stay at Eagle Lake Island Lodge and its a great camp. Like the lake but may start looking for some new waters to fish because of the fishing pressure. Seems like every year there are more and more boats on the water at Eagle. Part of my Canadian experience is fishing with few other anglers around.

Plus, alot of the guys in other parties come up the same week, lots of fun. If you go with the American Plan, you will not leave hungry (usually gain about 10 lbs. that week) because the cook and owner (Helen Johnson) makes some awesome meals."

We have been fishing Eagle Lake for few years now and I would agree with other comments that I have read, that the fishing is only getting better. I would like to thank all of you guys who pratice catch and release with some of those bigger walleye and pike. My fishing partner is my eleven year old and he and I have releasd some very nice fish and he and I couldn't be happpier when he hooks into a big one.Last year I found out about a group of fisherman who were killing all of the small pike they were catching. Can you imagine how many fish they could have killed over the course of a week, in any one area of the lake. There are some bays, that are chuck full of pike 22"" and smaller and I'm not embarrassed to say that I bring my son to them for some action throughout the week we are there. Our fishing party has a self imposed slot of no smaller than 22"" for the pike we keep. We always have plenty for shore lunch and to bring home for a tasty fish fry in the states. I'll step off of my soap box now....thanks.If anyone has a good area to try for smallies in July I would appreiciate a tip. They are awful tough to find that time of year. Anyway, Eagle is a great lake to fish and has something to offer for everyone. Good luck this year and have a good time. JoeUpnorth"
