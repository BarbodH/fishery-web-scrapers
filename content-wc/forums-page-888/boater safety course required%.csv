529517,gpbrown,2003-04-07 08:37:00,359,A group is planning our annual trip to Quebec and I recall reading in the fishing regulation booklet that next year (2003) you are required to show proof of passing a safety course before operating a power boat. Does anyone know if I read this right? If so we'll need to get busy on our classes.Thanks
529518,Guest,2003-04-07 09:26:00,0,As of Sept.15 2002 you need a license to operate a boat under 14' in lenght. Anything 14' and over a license is not due until 2009.Also the license is in effect if your under 18yrs. of age.

529521,vandy,2003-04-09 10:27:00,2,"So let me get this straight on this law. My17 year old son can operate our boat (14ft.) if I bring it (less then45 days) into Canada, but not one of the rentals (14ft, 9.9 hp) at the lodge. If he were to take a boater safety course in MI, which he is no longer required to, then he would be alright or pass the boater safety compenticy test. Boy it is getting more complicated each year. Please let me know if I am correct in my understanding or what I am miss understanding. Thank you,Randy"
529522,bigfish1965,2003-04-09 11:03:00,3210,There is a small easy form to fill out when you rent that allows you to operate the rented boat.
529523,alan ex pup,2003-04-09 16:43:00,126,the lodge owner said last year it is just a paper showing that the lodge owner showed you how to operate the boat and motor safely about 15 minutes. Also probably not to pee over the side of the boat without your life jacket on. 50% of the drowning victims they find in canada have you zipper open.
