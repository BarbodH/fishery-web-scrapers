Last year, we went to God's Lake in northern Manitoba direct from Indiana with a stop to clear customs in Thunder Bay. This year he would like to go to another lodge and prefers to fly direct from home. I would like advice regarding any lodges anyone might know of that have good northern and walleye fishing and also a runway. I appreciate the information and look forward to this again.Thanks"

Most camps in the area will pick you up and bring you to camp, or you can get an outfitter to fly your group into a remote lake. It's a great destination point."
528773,Guest,2003-04-09 10:23:00,0,Arctic Lodges on Reindeer Lake in Northern Sask. has a 5000 ft runway that you can fly into. They fly in guests direct from Winnipeg Mb. www.arcticlodges.com

It is listed as an abandoned aerodrome even though it may be good, so there is no listed information for it in the Canadian Airstrip directory.If you guys are interested in using it, you should get it registered, or at least publish this info on the website, along with the traffic frequency (Same as pistol lake I would assume). Not too many pilots will want to fly into an airstrip listed as abandoned, with no information posted."
