529082,Steve CO,2003-04-07 11:10:00,267,"Our group has been going with Halley's Camps/Outpost Company for 7-8 years, flying out to Bee Lake. Alex is associated with that operation and does most of the daily fly-ins to check on the outposts. Absolutely super guy. We stayed at Big North one night a couple of years ago before our fly-in. Very nice place. I can't speak for the fishing, but the operators are first class."
529083,Illini Bob,2003-04-07 14:12:00,16,"Going up the last week of June/first of July. This will beour eighth year at Big North.Great Place. Great Fishing. Cabins are well kept and have lots of room.Good choice, you won't be disappointed but I'll be surprised if they have any weeks still available in June.Illini Bob"

529086,Illini Bob,2003-04-10 09:02:00,16,"No, We're the 'bank beaters' from Quincy and Indianapolis.My two brothers, our dad and myself have been getting away from the midwest for a week each year for the last 11 years.If you're anywhere between 'The Dalles' and 'Big Sand' and you see a couple of Lowes from Illinois beating the banks for Smalleys or Pike or casting for Musky(or fishing for a Walleye lunch), give us a yell."
