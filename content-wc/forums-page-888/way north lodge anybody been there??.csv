529660,Esox Warrior,2003-04-08 18:54:00,64,My wife and I were there the 2nd week of July 2000. The fishing was outstanding. New owners had just taken over when we were there. Many improvements since from what I understand. We spent alot of time on Favourable Lake. Be sure to fish Lemonade Lake at least once! We did not fish Setting Net Lake but those that did were not disappointed. We fished for Pike and Walleye only but guys were getting some Lake Trout when they fished them. I would recommend Way North to anyone!
