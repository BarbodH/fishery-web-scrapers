529450,TomPGrouse,2003-04-04 12:15:00,124,Does anyone know for certain how much gas (legally)can take over the border? I have heard a number of things who knows for sure?
529451,lenray,2003-04-04 14:18:00,467,I cross into Ontario at the Soo as many as 6-8 times per year for fishing--I have taken as much as 30 gal. and sometimes they ask how much we have and other times have just taken say 15 gal. and have had to pay the tax or whatever it is on it.My experience has been that they only ask about 50% of the time and then we tell them what we have and 90% of the time they let us go thru but once in awhile we have to go inside and pay.Lately we have been taking less and just give our business to the Canadian gas stations.Last year we bought gas north of the town of Pickle Lake it is the farthest north you can drive in Ontario on a paved road then 150 miles north on gravel to the very end of the road we had to hook jumpers up to our truck battery to operate their gas pump very interesting.len at clare
529452,Guest,2003-04-05 06:06:00,0,as much as you can hold with refried beans
529453,Guest,2003-04-06 14:47:00,0,"I asked this same question and I was told ""whatever your tank holds""."
529454,Guest,2003-04-06 21:08:00,0,"Given the current anti-AMerican attitude in Canada, why would you want to endure their criticism?"
529455,stumcfar,2003-04-07 06:26:00,451,"It depends on the mood of the border guard. We had to pay duty a couple of years ago, because we had two full six gallon cans. We were told one tank per motor. If you have a large boat that has a 100 gallon tank, no problem. If you have a small boat with a six gallon tank, legally that is all you are allowed."
529456,Guest,2003-04-08 11:09:00,0,"I believe the law changed on this about three years ago. I know that in the past you could only take what your truck and boat tanks could hold. I cross at Fort Francis and have 3 5 gal containers in plain sight in the back of the truck and have never been questioned. Last year, for the first time they pulled us over and looked under the boat cover but never questioned the extra gas in the back of the truck."
