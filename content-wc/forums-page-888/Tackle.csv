I'm will be getting a new system this year. What has worked for you, what hasn't. I'm partial to plano, but I'm open to other suggestions.Fish ON!!"
529587,Guest,2003-04-08 17:25:00,0,i think soft tackel storage is the way to go. I had the same troubles n didn't have a enuf room. I just brought a new one n put walleye gear in one and other fishing lures in the other.
