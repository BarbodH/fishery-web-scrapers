Nobody will argue that they are not on some prime water area of LS, but what has put me off was the cabins compared to others on the lake, why do you recommend it?"
6260566,dxgluuq5,2018-11-15 17:20:00,25,"Looking to fish Lac Suel next summer mainly walleye. House boat is really not an option. With the size of this water, looking to stay somewhere where I don't have to run 15 miles to get on fish. Will bring my own boat. Don't need luxury or 5 star meals.Can go anytime/month. Appreciate it."
6260618,MikeinMN,2018-11-15 23:05:00,190,"Just my opinion, but having fished the NW (Ear Falls) end of Lac Seul for several years I think if you don't want to make longer runs you should go early season, like opener through mid to late June. This would put you with a lot more boat traffic than later in the year, but much closer to all the camps on that end. We stay at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge, but I think all the camps near Ear Falls are pretty good places to stay. A little searching on this forum will give you a good list of websites for all the camps. It's really a great place to fish and I don't think you'll regret trying it out."
6260680,BreezyPoint,2018-11-16 07:50:00,1581,"I have stayed in the same area many times in late August and caught huge numbers of fish at that end of the lake. Some of my biggest fish have come in Goose Bay with the camp visible. We caught large numbers of fish in Sawmill Bay by Radar Island (supposedly a spring spot) and other place we did very well was Steamboat Bay and Brown Bear creek. Most of our fish were caught trolling crank baits in ten fow or less. The fish are there in the late summer, you just need to go find them.Frank"

6261038,rather-be-fishin,2018-11-17 22:08:00,429,"You can't go wrong with Lac Seul, it's a Walleye factory! I fish the NW area South of Ear Falls. Check out these Resorts: Lac Seul Lodge located in Rat Bay Fisherman's Cove located in Scout Bay Onaway Lodge located in Scout Bay All good resorts with easy access to Bay of Islands, McKenzie Bay & South Bay. Plus, if it's too windy to get out in the big bays there is good fishing nearby in Scout Bay. Many other good resorts further North near Ear Falls. Check them out too: CherRob Gawley's Evergreen Golden Eagle Gold Pines Timberlane Goose Bay Good luck in planning your trip! The only thing that's get me through the Winter months is 8 months to go & counting down to our return trip to Lac Seul! üëçüé£üòé RBF"
6261040,dxgluuq5,2018-11-17 22:58:00,25,"Wow, thank you very much. Info really helps as this at first glance is intimidating to plan. Able to get out of heavy wind[even though I like the wind] is a plus. Time to do further research!!"
6261122,Anglin Andy,2018-11-18 08:11:00,100,"I have fished many times over the years on NW Lac Seul (by no means an expert) I also stay at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge (Doug and Gayle) are fantastic hosts. You will pay a flat fee $75 per person per night (this includes your nightly stay, launching your boat, free ice, electricity at the dock, very nice/clean fish cleaning house, taking your boat out and Great direction to where to start). As stated earlier, the month of June and early July can be very good close to their resort as the Summer goes on (late July into August) we find ourselves going to McKenzie Bay Area as well as far as Manitoba Pt. When the wind picks up fish the points and reefs that come out from the islands as well as the under water reefs that can come up to the surface (very quickly)! Use and trust your electronics, if you are not marking fish, continue to move and look to try other spots. Jigging with minnows is the staple for early season and when we get into July we start covering more spots by using bottom bouncers, spinners and crawlers. Enjoy the beauty that Canada has and you never know what you will find around each island and bay you travel by. Dave"
6263448,dxgluuq5,2018-11-26 20:58:00,25,Thanks. Great info!
6264010,Aspencreek,2018-11-28 18:32:00,2911,"If I can make one suggestion......do your searching for the camp by when they have an opening to fit your group. The best camps will be full or have few openings available. Most of these same camps re-book guests from last season for this 2019 season, and while you are looking around and contemplating, and considering and procrastinating, they will fill up on you and you are now sent back to the drawing board. Don't wait to make a reservation.And RBF has the list correct!!"
