Lake Larouche, Guin 1 and Guin (Super ) sound promising according to their website. Also looking at lg3 or lg4 reservoir off transtaiga rd. Researched the James bay road website but doesn't show any boat ramps or access points. Or if you have any other suggestions for a consistent trophy pike lake (preferably quebec ) drive in - fly in or camping in the middle of nowhere I'd really appreciate it. Thanks"
