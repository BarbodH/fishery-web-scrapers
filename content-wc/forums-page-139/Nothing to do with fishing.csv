I stumbled onto it last night and it reminds me of what life should be like instead of the hustle bustle and go, go, go of our currant lifestyles."

Canoeing is a great way to capture that true essence of the north however over the last 20yrs it has been in decline in much of Ontario, hundreds of great routes from Kenora to Cochrane that are now rarely paddled. I believe the sport is alive and well with younger urban folk but they can't seem to jump off the hamster wheel long enough to enjoy a 7-10 day route far away, Temagami, Killarny and Algonquin are seeing lots of traffic from weekend trippers from the GTA."
