6261310,Beagle_Nut,2018-11-19 07:33:00,52,"My wife and I like to cast for northerns, and we're looking for a new spot to try next year. We generally go in late September, and our requirements are: - Drive-in or boat-in on a lake big enough to make use of our own boat, an 18ft Crestliner with a 115 Merc. - A decent dock I can get electric to for charging the trolling motor batteries. - Decent housekeeping cabin with gas or electric heat. Last year the place we stayed just had a wood stove insert and we froze (I'm obviously not the best at getting up during the night to keep a fire going). - A place with numbers of decent fish, not necessarily the biggest monsters (hence why we target northerns instead of muskies). Places we've already been to: - Last 5 years we've done Whitefish Bay on LOTW - while we've generally done OK the fishing has been getting tougher every year, especially this year. - Minaki one year, where we both caught our personal largest fish but numbers were absolutely the lowest we've seen. - Shoal Lake - Did well but I think my wife's a little scared of that 'big pond' and the remoteness of the area. I've also read a few posts that say it's slowed down quite a bit from its best days. I've been looking at Canadian end of Rainy Lake and Eagle lake so far but am open to anything at this point."
6261336,rockape,2018-11-19 08:59:00,215,"I think hands down the best pike lake in NW Ontario is Minnitaki. We have caught hundreds of pike over 30 inches casting on Minnitaki. I have done it in June the last 17 years. Never in the fall. It always produces. I feel they are easier to catch and there are more numbers than Eagle. Cedar is a total musky lake so don't bother for pike there. I have not fished LOTW so I can't comment on that. Abram and Pelican are good too. Lac Seul as well, but Minnitaki still reigns. I have also read great things about Little Vermillion. PM me if you want lodge info in the Sioux Lookout area."
6261424,The tank,2018-11-19 13:08:00,340,Wabaskang-peurault falls Pakwash -south of red lake. Pelican -sioux lookout. Some thar we've done well with pike when we used to fish for them. Lac Suel around earfalls (brown bear creek area) was also really good.
6261532,Golden Eagle,2018-11-19 19:02:00,2642,"This past year has given a few really good weeks, but many more barely acceptable weeks. I went up 3 times for a total of 23 days on the water. Fished May, July and September. I'm glad I went and we caught fish, but it was the worst year for me, beginning in 1959. I'm fully booked for the 2019 opener and might make it a 2 week stay. Going in a week prior to opener to fish for pike is sometimes exceptional. I won't be looking to change lakes, but will look forward to a higher water level and great fishing. I suggest not giving up on water that holds fish and has treated you well in past seasons."
6261616,Beagle_Nut,2018-11-20 06:19:00,52,"I didn't mention we went to Wabaskang our first trip to Canada, unfortunately it was so low that year I don't think we gave it a fair shot. My wife did pull a 38 incher out but that was the fish of the trip and numbers weren't high so we moved on. Same deal with Whitefish Bay this year, the weather the last week of September was really nasty with cold and wind and even a few days of snow so we shouldn't give up on it just based on this year. Overall though we've only found one area we've had consistently good results (closer to the south end) and that's after putting in quite a lot of time and effort exploring. This year we had to work really hard just to get 2 fish big enough for a couple of fish dinners. The Sioux Lookout area has always looked promising, maybe we'll give that a shot. Lots of nice looking lakes, as long as they have decent boat ramps we could probably move around and try more than one. It's just so much easier when you can go hop in your boat at the dock and get fishing quickly though. Thanks for the suggestions, part of the fun of going to Canada is this process of checking out all the options."
6264088,prov1800,2018-11-29 06:36:00,5010,Lot of lakes mentioned are all good pike waters.one of my favorites that wasn't mentioned is clay lake.only one lodge on that river system and has some of the best pike action.check out north star lodge.also check out north shore lodge on the east end of eagle.
6264158,Mike Borger,2018-11-29 11:27:00,1554,"I would probably say Winoga Lode's boat-in outpost on Lake St. Joseph. Beautiful cabin, very remote.It's a pretty long haul to get there, but worth it. I've caught a bunch of giant pike on St. Joe and it's a bonafide walleye factory as well.http://www.winoga.com/outposts.html"
6264724,Beagle_Nut,2018-12-01 06:58:00,52,"Thanks for all the suggestions, we've decided to try the Sioux Lookout area, made a reservation at Red Pine Lodge on Abram Lake which looks really nice. I was surprised to see how long of a haul it is to Sioux Lookout, looks like a good 4 hours past the border. We haven't gone up 502 for maybe 10 years. I hope they've added a public bathroom along the way somewhere like they have on 71, my only real memory of our last trip up that way was that one convenience store about half way up getting my wife fuming when they told her she couldn't use the restroom unless she bought something first."
6264784,IaDave14,2018-12-01 09:27:00,99,Good choice on Red Pine I have stayed there numerous times. Most of my trips have been in the fall and usually targeted walleye but did try Northern a few times. Never had a lot of luck casting as they seemed to be in the deeper water with the walleye. Caught most of them with a jig and minnow where it drops off into deep water from a hump. We also trolled the river where it comes into Abram Lake. At the mouth there are weed beds and it drops into a 30-40' hole. Feel free to send me a message if you like. Also there is nothing now once you get on 502. I use to enjoy that stretch but now I don't.
6264806,Bill Krejca,2018-12-01 10:30:00,6107,"If you like to drive, Tramping Lake, near Snow Lake, Manitoba, is a trophy lake for pike and walleye. The last year we went there, about 10 years ago, a fellow at the same camp got and released 5 Master Angler Award pike in the same day. The lake has a size limit on it for pike and walleye, walleye is 22"", I don't remember what it is for pike. Wekusko Falls Camp is the only camp on the lake. If you want more info, please email me at [email protected] Bill"
