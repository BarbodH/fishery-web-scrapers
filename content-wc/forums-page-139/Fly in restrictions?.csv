6262910,WALI4VR,2018-11-24 23:20:00,68,"Is there a length restriction on some, most, or all planes as far as rod holders? By the time I get my 7 1/2 ft rods in the rod case is approaching 8ft.'98 Merc why still carburetored?"
6262916,Seanik,2018-11-25 01:20:00,218,"One of our group insists on taking 7' one piece rods in a tube. We never had a problem taking the long tube on fly ins. White River Air never blinked and loaded it on an Otter. Air Melacon in Quebec loaded the long tube on a Beaver without complaint. Personally I do just fine with 2 piece St. Croix rods. We travel in a large SUV and strap the long tube to the roof rack, 2 nights in motels require removal and re- install of the tube, more trouble than it's worth. Seanik"
6262940,Golden Eagle,2018-11-25 05:35:00,2642,"Use 2 piece rods when traveling on a small plane, otherwise you're fine. Pilot and 3 passengers, plus gear will be a tough fit for a long rod carrier on a Skywagon. Same with a huge net."
6262968,Bstar,2018-11-25 07:06:00,564,Our group has flown in with 7' rods in rod cases with no problems at all with the air services. I think they have come to expect it. They all carry 8' or longer dimensional lumber to the camps so a 7 1/2' rod case is no big deal. I do agree that they can be a PIA to transport in or on a vehicle but everyone has to make their own decisions. I personally like the one piece rods.
6262976,Knutson21,2018-11-25 07:15:00,348,"I have never had an issue with Rod length on the float planes in to camp. However you do have to follow the rules when flying commercial most airlines limit the length to 80"" maximum."
6263008,bthomas3333,2018-11-25 08:27:00,465,"I agree the problem lies with commercial flights not the float planes. The section I pulled below is why I tend to fly WestJet when possible. They don't have the 80in rule.IMHO I would much rather fish one piece rods for a bunch of reasons, but the paragraph below is why my Pike / Laker gear is two pieces.This is from the United website: (The last sentence is the concern. United Express flies many if not all of the flights into Winnipeg.) 80 inches doesnt even allow for 7ft rods much less the overhead length of a case.------------United accepts one item of fishing equipment per customer as checked baggage. An item of fishing equipment consists of the following:Two rodsOne reelOne landing netOne pair of fishing bootsOne tackle boxAll items must be properly encased in a suitable container not to exceed a total of 115 linear inches (L + W + H) and 50 pounds (23 kg).Fishing equipment greater than 80 inches in length will not be accepted as checked baggage on any itinerary involving a United Express flight.-------------West Rules:OverviewWestJet accepts equipment that meets the requirements for air travel. Please see below for restrictions based on your particular destination.The maximum length accepted for checked baggage is 9.8 feet.Fishing equipmentCollapsible fishing rods can be permitted as carry-on baggage.A fishing rod as checked baggage must be packed in a rigid or hard-shell container. More than one fishing rod can be packed in the same container.A set consists of a fishing rod container and a tackle box.All applicable checked baggage fees will be charged. However, an oversize fee will not be charged."
6263022,lionfan19,2018-11-25 09:21:00,41,I recall a trip in the 1980's where my buddy had a long rod tube and the pilot tied it on the aircraft pontoon. That was on a beaver. An Otter should have plenty of room for a rod tube that long. I guess it would be a good idea to know what kind of aircraft your outfitter will be using when making a decision like that.
6263026,Knutson21,2018-11-25 09:30:00,348,"I agree West Jet is the way to go due to being able to fly with longer rods, but one word of caution, we flew West Jet from Chicago to Yellowknife NWT, the first leg of the trip from Chicago to Calgary was operated ny United Express so had to follow thier 80"" rule, even though we booked a West Jet Flight."
