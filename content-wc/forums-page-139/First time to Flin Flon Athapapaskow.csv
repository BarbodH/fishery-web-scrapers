6262158,headabovewater,2018-11-21 17:55:00,2,"My wife and I are heading to FlinFlon middle of next June, going to stay at Bakers Narrows Lodge and try our luck on that lake as well as some others in the area for pike and walleye primarily. Any suggestions for other lakes? We have a trailered boat(my new pre-retirement toy- alumacraft escape 165cs) so would need to use a boat launch for access. Are most of the lakes major prop destroyers? I would prefer to get away from crowds, I like people, just don't want to see many when I'm fishing....."
6262262,Bill Krejca,2018-11-22 07:04:00,6107,"Nice area, first passed through in 1970, on way to Mirond Lake in Sask. Have fished near Snow Lake in Manitoba, Tramping Lake has many trophy fish. Bill"
6262266,justaguy2454,2018-11-22 07:15:00,220,"An hour south is the Pas and Clearwater lake super clear water , or if you travel west on the Hansen road lots of lakes , Jan lake ,Deschambault Lake . Pretty much only thing to do in flin flin is drink and fish. https://www.cityofflinflon.ca/fishing"
6262688,Larry S,2018-11-24 06:40:00,665,Go to the website www.xtremesportfishing.com it covers Manitoba fishing There are many people on here who fish the area's you are going to and can help you a lot The Manager of the site guides a bit and has many helpful suggestions on where to go
6262784,GBS,2018-11-24 14:42:00,2271,"Probably further away than you want to drive, but about 45mi. east on Hwy 39 is Reed Lake. Here's a link to the lodge we stayed at there: https://grassriverlodge.com/ Right off the hwy is a provincial campground with boat launch. Our best was my 52"" Northern over 4 days of fishing. Wife's best was a 48"". MANY every day in the low 40's. Usually didn't fish for walleye until about 1/2 hr before lunch time, but never an issue being late for shore lunch. Would take a break from casting (arms got sore!), and then jig for walleye for an hour or so. Not a ""100 fish per hour"" lake, but always caught several in that hour, all 18-24"". Lake Trout had gone deep when we were there, so didn't spend any time on them, but supposed to be gang busters in the spring. Flin Flon used to be the sole Canadian Government run ""grow farm"" for pot. Located in a nearby abandoned mine, for medical use. Then it was a very restricted location. Heck, they probably have a retail outlet there now!"
6262786,headabovewater,2018-11-24 15:05:00,2,"Thanks for the info, I have read about Reed lake and its great fishing, I am fairly paranoid at this time about my brand new boat and its prop on the reefs of that lake. I have just used a little inflatable zodiac with a 6hp merc for a number of years besides the usual 12 foot aluminums with 9.9s on a few flyouts we did. Maybe after a year or two of getting used to a little bigger boat and motor I will feel confident enough to try Reed. Having said that I plan to fish Athapap at least a couple of days while we are up there and I have heard that is a prop killer as well. I will definately bring a spare one up with me. But ****, 52 inches; very impressive, what is your estimate of its weight?"
6262826,spotter,2018-11-24 17:04:00,178,every northern lake is full of reefs and rocks right at surface u need to pat attention all the time when moving from spot to spot if u don't u will lose a prop and probably more
6262828,spotter,2018-11-24 17:05:00,178,ive fished all those lakes and u never find all the rocks and shallow reefs
6262862,Bill Krejca,2018-11-24 18:58:00,6107,"Tramping is relatively free of reefs, just have to get to the lake from the relatively shallow river, not a big problem. Up the road from Reed. Bill"
