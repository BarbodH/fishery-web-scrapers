How many fly-in / outpost cabins are on this lake? My initial search seems to indicate that there are at least 4 different outfitters that have a cabin here. Is that correct? Here's what I found so far: 1. Northwest Flying  Nestor Fallshttp://www.northwestflying.com/outposts/loonhaunt-lake/ 2. Crow Lake Outfitters  Nestor Fallshttp://crowlakeoutfitters.com/loonhauntlake.html 3. Tinker's Place  Nestor Fallshttps://www.tinkersplaces.com/fly-in-outposts 4. Sunset Outposts  Nestor Fallshttp://sunsetoutpost-nestorfalls.com/ Please let me know if this looks correct, and if all 4 outfitters are currently operating on Loonhaunt. Also, if anybody who has fished it could provide your reviews / feedback on the walleye, pike, bass and lake trout fishing, that would be appreciated. Thanks! ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
