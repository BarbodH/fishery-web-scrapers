6261418,BreezyPoint,2018-11-19 12:49:00,1581,I once bought preserved minnow and counted out 120 (after thawing). When I was queried about bait told the agent I had 120 preserved minnows. He asked me how I knew that...I told I counted them out. He laughed and waved me on.Frank
6261432,Lovetofish,2018-11-19 13:31:00,458,"Was asked how many salted fatheads when my wife and I crossed in July. I said 1/2 gallon. He asked about how many is that, 20 dozen or so? I said I'm not sure but that sounds right. My guess is it was more than 20 dozen. Maybe someone can chime in on how many 1/2 gallon is. And they were small this year. It only cost about $30. I stopped in Harris, MN on my drive up and salted them in the bait shop. Then put them in a cooler with ice and rinse them off when I get to camp the next day."
6261466,ChuckD,2018-11-19 15:20:00,1581,"If I recall correctly, Canada allows 12 dozen per licensed person. I salt and freeze my own and package them so they can be somewhat counted in ziplock bags. The key is to salt and freeze them and tell the border they are salted and frozen. The word ""preserved"" minnows raises more questions."
6261476,andreindy,2018-11-19 15:36:00,308,"I brought salted shiners across the border for my trip in July last year for the first time. I WAS asked at the border how many I had. Being the paranoid guy I am, I knew exactly how many I had. 258. I had bagged them, two dozen in a bag. This allowed the boys to just grab a bag or two when they hopped into the boat. This also decreased the risk of larger batches being in the boat, being forgotten or soaked with water half the day and all that can go wrong... I had actually purchased the shiners online. $28 for a 2# bag. And I got the large 2.5 to 3"" shiners. I got about 21 dozen in that 2# bag."
6261498,pan-man,2018-11-19 16:27:00,299,May I ask where you bought the shiners?
6261514,andreindy,2018-11-19 17:19:00,308,"bestbait.com I have never fished salted minnows, so I'm probably not the best judge if they were quality or not in comparison to other locations. But I can tell you that they held up great. Not mushy. And for what it's worthy, they provide a certificate that they were tested and are disease free. I had this certificate also with me when I crossed, just in case."
