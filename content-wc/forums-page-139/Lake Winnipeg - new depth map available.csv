Angler's Edge Mapping will soon release a sizable mapped chunk of Lake Winnipeg's south basin, based on exclusive surveys we've conducted over the past few summers. We've put together a teaser video, I'm linking it below. We're shooting for a Mid-december release to catch the bulk of this ice fishing season, exact date currently TBD (we are still processing map data and finalizing the map). The Lake Winnipeg chip will also include new coverage of the upper Red River (from Lockport to Lake Winnipeg). More details to follow, I'd be happy to answer any questions anybody might have. https://youtu.be/KEpaNR7kR3k"
