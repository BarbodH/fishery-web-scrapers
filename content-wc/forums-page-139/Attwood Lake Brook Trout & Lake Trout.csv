Next year will be our second time there and we did go up the river to the falls but not sure if we were in the right part of the river as there is another stretch we went into but the water was running pretty fast. Has anyone caught a Lake Trout in this Lake and what was used? Happy early Thanksgiving!Janitor"

As far as upstream goes I'm sure if you get above the falls you will find trout, if you can easily navigate to the falls so can pike and walleye and in a smaller river like the Attwood trout can't compete but I would bet it's a different world above that first falls. The lake trout however I would guess your success would be determined by the season and water temp."
