6265154,andreindy,2018-12-02 12:12:00,308,"Abamasagi: Perspective of a Fly-In First-timer I traveled to Abamasagi Lake mid-July, 2018 with Twin Lakes Outfitters. This was my 2nd Canadian experience and my 1st Fly-In experience. While my contributions to the board are often few, I thought I would share a few novice perspectives that contributed to success and happiness. Some background: Members of the trip included myself, my father, my younger brother, a 15 year old nephew and a brother in law. The nephew and brother in law have only fished a few times in their entire lives. My brother has limited experience. My father has almost none. 1. Determine what defines success: What are your goals for the trip? An assumption is that this question is partially answered while you are forming your group and are either going with folks of like mind or who have a plan to support differing opinions. Significant differences in what a person wants from the trip can be problematic. For some people, success is defined largely by mathematics and sheer numbers. Or the fishing only for pike, or walleye, etc. Or fishing primarily a particular style (bottom bouncing). For us, that was not the case (Luckily). For my father, success included time not fishing at all, but instead drinking a good coffee at the end of the dock watching the eagles and the waves. 2. Division of labor. It is important to have open discussions about what responsibilities there are and how everyone will contribute. Don't rely on the hope that this will naturally come together on its own. A week long camp is like a little village. Maximize the skills the inhabitants have. Our 15 year old was not much of a cook, but he could certainly do dishes. And refresh the worm buckets and bail the standing water. And he did. People generally want to feel they are contributing to the team in some way. No one gets a free pass. There was a time very early one where my father pulled me aside and said Slow down, you don't have to do everything for everyone. This is your vacation too. 3. Teach/mentor: The 15 year old started by asking others to take the fish off his hook. The first few hours, we did. But then realized we were doing him (or ourselves) no favors. We needed to teach. Teach the most common knots. How to set up rigs properly. How to vary their jig retrieve. Ideally, you can teach some of these lessons prior to your trip. Did I fillet almost all the fish? Yes. Did I teach every one of them while we were there? YES. The experience of the trip for the other members was BETTER because I backed off and allowed them to grow. 4. Organize: Prior to the trip, I had created some tackle organizers out of milk crates. Each boat had an identical version. The milk crate easily held multiple Plano 3700 boxes and had very established locations for pliers, hook removers, jaw spreaders, flashlight, tape measure. The back outside of the milk crate had a place for marker buoys and a foam noodle for attaching loose hooks and bait. These milk crate set-ups were winners in the small camp boats and kept chaos from completely reigning. (see picture) 5. Rain Gear and Waterproof boots/shoes: Critical. And have back up shoes. My pair of waterproof boots were soaked through I had to quickly jump in the water (that's for another story) and it can take a very, very long time to thoroughly dry boots. I cut that time significantly by strategically positioning them by the exhaust pipe of the small, running generator. Did they smell briefly like exhaust? Yep. Were they fully dry deep in the toe pocket? Yep. 6. Using Google Earth to scout locations: Prior to our trip to Abamasagi, I had spent quite a bit of time reviewing the lake on Google Earth. While zoomed in, the resolution does get poor, but I could distinguish the tips of rock points or even mid-lake rock humps. Google Earth allowed me to GPS mark all my locations of interest. I gave each point a numerical name (1, 2, 3, etc). I then transferred those Google Earth points to both my GPS locator that would be running portable in one of the boats AND I transferred the exact same points to a handheld Garmin eTrex 30. I had an identical 3 ring binder in the milk crate of each boat showing maps that reference each of the points of interest. It was then easy for us to talk between boats Hey, let's go try #30 or I am just zipping around the corner to try #23. This pre-work kept the other boat close, let me know where they were and gave us all places to try instead of scratching our newbie heads entirely clueless and devoid of direction. (see picture of books). 7. An anchor hack: Boat control is not everyone's strong suit. Sometimes with our group there would be a need to anchor and most fly-ins do not provide anchors. I brought basketball nets, carabiners and some paracord. A choice rock (or two) in the basketball net was all that was needed to anchor the small 14 camp boats. 8. Platypus water filter: We used this device to filter all of our water for drinking. It handles large volumes and filters it very quickly (minutes). Worth every penny. I also brought a few extra dollar store ice cube trays so that we had enough for the propane fridge our cabin had. 9. Food: We ate fish every day, but my father and I had figured out the menu well ahead of time. Additionally, we had prepared and froze shredded pork and turkey ahead of time. Several quick meals involved variations of these meats. 10. Fishing strategy: We kept it very simple. Our level of experience probably impaired our ability to successfully adapt and change strategies. We vertical jigged almost the entire time. I tried to introduce bottom bouncing and some crankbait trolling with limited success. Our unfamiliarity with the water and contours further made this tricky. I was indebted to Walleye Central, and the many users on this forum for providing ideas and thoughts. I enjoyed my time at Mill's Fleet Farm tracking down suggestions. I would also export many of the forum threads into a PDF and save them to my phone so I could access them whenever, wherever. I did this also with some YouTube videos (like how to fillet a Northern). 11. TRADITION: There are a few ingredients necessary to create a successful tradition and Canada is seemingly the perfect baking dish for interactions, conversations, collective experiences. You never, ever forget the meal. After our first Canada trip two years ago, I was inspired by the old camp coffee percolator. I purchased a very durable stainless percolator and had it engraved with ADVENTURES and beneath that we engrave the year and where we went. I presented it to my Dad, who displays it on his mantle when not in use. The percolator will come with us as long as we are able and hopefully will pass from hand to hand in our family when some of us are just dust. (see picture). 12. Tradition continued: This last year at Abamasagi was wonderful. For the nephew and brother-in-law, a trip 50 miles from home is incredibly infrequent. An 800 mile trek to a Canadian fly-in was legendary. I would collect all the pictures taken afterwards and using a website called ShutterFly, I would retell some of our adventures and present everyone a copy of the hardcover book I put together of our trip. These books have been read, passed around and enjoyed by the family and will for years. (see picture). A special thanks to Adam Dempsey and his helpful link that got me started. https://fishingoutposts.com/how-to-p...-fishing-trip/ We had an amazing time and will be returning to Abamasagi again in 2019. My nephew's 2nd ever cast into Canadian water caught only a walleye, but also the northern that grabbed the walleye boat side. THAT will be etched into the walls of memory for a long time. Everyone is returning this year and this time, my own 18 year old son will be coming too."

6265642,andreindy,2018-12-03 17:17:00,308,"Thank you everyone for the remarks. Born to Fish, thank you as well because the original idea of using a milk crate came from you! The creation of the book was not a tremendous amount of work. While I certainly made it for all the participants, the book is one of the best ways of ""showing"" the trip to all the people who asked me how the trip went. On the Canada trips, I am always mindful that I am not distracted from the actual beautiful reality right in front of me for the sake of capturing memories on devices. But our phones do make the job easier: photos are geotagged and date and time stamped. When you upload them into these book programs, the program organizes the photos by date. Not too difficult to pull it all together. Add a few stories here and there (factual or otherwise) and you're done."
6265662,Moosebunk,2018-12-03 18:18:00,211,"That was a great read, much of it quite insightful indeed. You're very fortunate to share all that time with family, so that right there is a huge success in itself. The album photo of the corner in the road, I know the one and that stretch of highway is such a treat to roll through. Thanks for posting."
6265684,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-03 20:00:00,8293,I think the other purpose books provide is for kids. If you leave the books lay around where the kids or teenagers can browse through them it's easy to gauge their interest level. I personally worry that with computers and ipads ect that kids will only be exposed to what they can find on their devices. Curiosity is a good thing sometimes. Again good job putting it all together.
6265722,andreindy,2018-12-04 06:44:00,308,I enjoy that stretch of road as well! Here is the location I took the picture.
6265738,Bill Krejca,2018-12-04 07:50:00,6107,"Very familiar with the bend in the road in the picture, the entire area for miles is a unique display of nature at it's finest and somewhat most unusual. Bill"
6265174,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-02 12:47:00,8293,Great job! Well thought out and executed. My wife does the same thing on Shutterfly. She chronicles vacations and special things with the kids and grandkids. Hopefully those books live on well after we are gone. Keep the tradition alive!!
6265216,dvl2700,2018-12-02 14:46:00,371,Excellent Post. Thank you.
6265342,Scratcher,2018-12-02 19:20:00,170,"I enjoyed reading the story of your adventure. The book for the group is a nice touch. Several years ago everyone in our group took a lot of video. I edited it all, added some commentary and music. Had a three hour movie and put it on DVD for each member of the group. Each year since we get together and plan the coming trip while watching that DVD. Your books story and your story telling are just beginning. Thanks for posting it and enjoy the many adventures to come."
6265352,bthomas3333,2018-12-02 20:05:00,465,Excellent post. Best part is #1 on your list (Determine what defines success) is really so important. SO many people don't know what they want well enough and then wind up disapointed.You are really on the right path to a lots of great trips!Brett
6265358,kzoofisher,2018-12-02 20:49:00,5144,Good post. Sounds like you have many great trips ahead of you. Try this site for better close up resolution when couch scouting. https://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.o...e&locale=en-US
6265402,gordy28,2018-12-03 07:19:00,437,Great post - really like the way you broke it down Also love the tackle organizers for each boat! We did something similar for creating spots but we had a rough contour map - like you we found it helpful to say - hey lets start at 6a and 6b and if nothings happening we can head to 4d ans so forth Cheers Gordy
6265416,MrSimon,2018-12-03 07:48:00,922,Great post!! The book is a fantastic idea.
6265448,BornToFish,2018-12-03 08:52:00,1224,"Greetings, Andre: Your original post on this thread is fantastic! Thanks for thinking it through so clearly and then writing it in such a succinct manner. I very much liked your first criterion! I have coached many people with respect to their first trip to fish in Canada. My first piece of advice is almost always to define their criteria for success based on ""did you have fun?"", rather than the number and size of fish. People will return to their lake/lodge if they have fun. The fishing almost always improves with experience. It sounded to me in the remainder of your original post that your group had a great time together. I can only imagine the number of pleasant memories that your group made on your first trip, and will make in future trips. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
