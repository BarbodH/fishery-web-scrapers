6224394,JAY221,2018-07-21 13:42:00,877,"Got back last night(20th) from Wabaskang. Spent the week @ Sleepy Dog Cabins with absolutely no complaints about anything at the camp. Great place run by great people. Tom posted on his website to bring something for the flys and he wasn't kidding! They are horrible this year. At the very least bring a fly swatter and you will be kept busy. Tom told me right off fishing has been tough with a week or so of hot temperatures and nice weather. The water level is very very low. You have to be careful as they have done a good job of putting jugs on a lot of spots but you never know where the unmarked one is. We went out Saturday afternoon for a while and got some Walleye & Northern's in the weedy bay to the left of Gut Island with the cabin on the point. Then Saturday morning the wind started to blow and the fishing bite turned on. We fished the back side of the same weedy bay and they were stacking up in there with the wind blowing into it. Fished it the next two mornings with good results. Made for difficult boat control but was worth it. We then tried Mcleod in the afternoon but didn't have any luck up there. Our next stop was down in Ruby trying to get out of the wind as the wife doesn't appreciate it like some of us do.. You will find some small bays on the east side with flowered lily pads out front and this is home to a number of 17""-18"" Walleyes. This is the only place where we caught fish in less that 15' of water with the exception of the backside of the first bay. Big Nose is still my go to place for Walleye. The front side by the Eagles nest is deep and if you run something through there deep you will probably get fish. The back side about 180 degrees from the Eagles nest is also very good with Walleyes and Northern's around it. The fish are scattered in general and deeper and the wind helps immensely when blowing into a point or bay. We only went in as far as Ear Falls and had zero issues with Canadian road construction. South and North of the twin cities is another story. It added 2 hours each way to our travel times. We spent an extra hour in traffic coming back southbound around Fairbault in one lane traffic with absolutely no construction going on anywhere in the one lane zone!!!The gas at Dutchie's is a reasonable 1.70 a liter Canadian but it is premium!!!! Any questions please ask and I will try to answer.We took a friend of the family a young man 13 years old as we did last year and had no problems at the border with the proper paperwork. I will be back next year same week and same cabin. Later, Jay"
6224974,jsmyers,2018-07-23 09:41:00,198,"Thanks for the report Jay. I'm glad you had a good week. I'll be with Tom next June for the first time. I'm really looking forward to it.I'm not familiar with ""Gut Island"" nor am I sure which Cabin you are referring to. Care to help me visualize you report more completely?"
6225156,JAY221,2018-07-23 15:06:00,877,"Gut Island is the first island out from Sleepy Dog. Tom puts the remains from fish cleaning on the southeast corner of this island. If you go up the left side of it and look straight ahead their is a cabin on the point of the next island. Be on the lookout for a plastic jug out in front of the island as it is a big rock. Maybe 200-250 feet or so out from the point. That particular point also has a shelf in front of the cabin so stay out to the left. The bay where you end up going up the left side of the second island is the one I was talking about. Have you been there to check out Sleepy Dog Cabins? I have never had a problem of any kind but know that Tom would take care of it no matter what. That's just how he is about things. Do you know what cabin you will have? Later, Jay"
6225274,jsmyers,2018-07-23 21:26:00,198,"So are you talking about here roughly: https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/ge...7_N_93_12_51_W?I haven't visited Sleepy Dog, but I only hear great things about them. I've talked to Tom and exchanged emails with his brother years ago. My last two trips have been boat in. Peffley's and Wine Lake. Both were great, but this time will be a drive in family vacation.Sent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk"
6225546,AB,2018-07-24 18:58:00,61,Thanks for the report Jay! Sounds like you had a good time. I’ll be up first week of August.
6225668,jsmyers,2018-07-25 07:42:00,198,"I thought I'd share some of my stories from Wabaskang and Wine lake, giving some information about spots and tactics along the way. (Especially because I ask others about the lakes.) I'll add a snippet here and there as I have time. This thread seems as good as any. We mostly target pike (on purpose.) My trip report from my 2011 trip is gone. I put it on EsoxHunter's forum which is now down. I came back from my 2016 trip completely swamped at work and never wrote one. BTW - I'm booked at Sleepy Dog next June 22…and I can't wait.Opening weekend 2011: First time at Peffley's Camp and the first time on the lake since I was a teenager, circa 1994.I'd bought two lures that I ended up loving for pike at that time of year: a large-size Rapala X-Rap Subwalk (~6""/~2oz) and a Rapala Glidin Rap (similar size, now discontinued). In the first couple days of the trip I had caught a handful of northerns in the 28-32"" range on the Glidin Rap. I was in the boat with my newbie brother-in-law on the west side of the 3rd narrows. He's new to the group and NW ON, but not fishing in general. This is the area that some call ""The Hotel"" (50.448,-93.206). There was a noticeable current passing through the narrow gap between the lakes there. This would be the gap that you shouldn't boat through at speed, but is deep enough in the very middle.He wasn't having the luck I was having, so I decided to lend him my Glidin Rap. I don't recall if it was his first cast, or a minute in, but he had a serious snafu with his terminal tackle and I watched my productive lure sink to the depths slowly. He felt really bad, and I was in mourning, but hey, ""stuff"" happens.That is when I tried the Subwalk and figured out that it was working just as well--maybe better.That lure was my favorite for the rest of the trip. I lost count of how many 28-32"" northerns I caught, mostly on the Subwalk. I got my personal best northern on the north shore of Wine, near the outlet by a rocky little bay. I believe it was the spot at 50.489,-93.296. In any event, an extremely fat 37"" pike crushed it up in the shallows next to a rocky outcropping and some scattered reeds, in full view. One of my regrets from that trip is that that particular day I forgot to put my contacts in, so my view was a bit blurry. (This post has the pic: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...06#post1315906)I think it was the second to last day when I was in the boat with my brother-in-law's father. Who is an accomplished angler in coastal SC, but was also a newbie to NW ON and our group. I was still doing well with the large Subwalk. It was a black/silver color. He had a small Subwalk that was a gold color--but it wasn't working for him. If I remember correctly we were slowing trolling south through the middle of Gawley's Bay somewhat around the long point of reeds.We decided to trade, in order to figure out if it was how he was working it, the size, or the color. First cast: massive backlash on his baitcaster and my Subwalk goes sailing…without his line.Moral of the story: don't lend your favorite lure to your in-laws."
6225958,JAY221,2018-07-25 18:28:00,877,"Yes, That is the correct bay. That can be worked from either side. How many in your part this time? Just wondering what cabin you might end up with. I will guarantee you you won't be disappointed in the cabins or boats. The boats will run 2-3 days on a tank of gas and the cabins want for nothing. We have stayed in 3 & 4 and the daughter and son in law stayed in 5 one year. I have been in the guard shack only because that is where the daughter son in law were going to stay and Tom told her to come look at this one and you can have it if you want it and they stayed in 5. The lake has a lot more structure in my opinion on the southern end.Later, Jay"
6236162,AB,2018-08-21 18:51:00,61,"My dad first took me to Wabaskang 45 years ago and this year I took him. Probably for the last time. He’s 75 and it’s a tough trip for him now. Fished Wabby 8/4 - 8/11. Arrived late Saturday afternoon, stayed close to camp into middle lake and did real well on the walleyes. I thought then it was going to be a good week and I was right. We caught eater size eyes all week along the 15 ft. weed lines. Bigger walleye were out a little deeper on the humps. Pike were numerous but this is one of the few times that we didn’t catch any really big ones. Did not fish deep for Pike and now that I think about it more, that’s prob where the big boys were. We caught about a dozen bass but maybe they were deeper too? It was hot mid week 80+ degrees and the cabin was a little warm a couple of nights. We did use a fan to keep the air moving at night. Water level was really low, neighboring cabin (40 yr. veteran of wabby) did real well in Keynote but on the third trip (they stayed 3 weeks) hit a rock and tore up his motor bad. The buoy chain out of 1st narrows was grabbed by a prop the previous week I was told. We portaged over the falls and went back to the big falls for some adventure and it was quite the chore getting back over due to the low water. We saw a lynx walking along a sandy beach in the big lake. Saw 4 moose. Ear Falls and Red Lake seem to be doing good economically. Lots of float planes in the air. First for us: we caught a burbout, eelpout, lingcod - whatever you call them!"
6236454,jsmyers,2018-08-22 15:47:00,198,"I was first brought to Wabaskang by my grandfather, who had started going there about 45-50 years ago. I know what you mean about the it getting to be a tough trip. We stopped making the trip when he was in his mid 80s.Quote: Originally Posted by ABWe portaged over the falls and went back to the big falls for some adventure and it was quite the chore getting back over due to the low water.

I'll have to add that to the thread later. Part of me wants to go back to see it again, but I'm also concerned about the safety and sanity of doing so.Quote: Originally Posted by ABFirst for us: we caught a burbout, eelpout, lingcod - whatever you call them!Again: Please tell us more!Was it incidental to fishing for trout? Did you eat it? I've always wanted to get one because they sound like they taste delicious."
6263250,Bullman,2018-11-26 07:32:00,17,Well I have been notified that the camp has been sold. I will hope this does not cause any issues with my trip. Obviously cannot count on them knowing the lake or the fishing spots in their first year. This is my first trip to this camp and I'll hope for the best. Heading up early August.
6263392,billy weaver,2018-11-26 16:53:00,470,The one thing that has always impressed me about the fishermen fishing Canada is the willingness to share info. I think the fact that there is so many places that offer good fishing and the fact that they only fish the lake once or twice a year makes them want to share info. I have been fishing Wabaskang for 30 years and I share info. and listen to others as they offer info. Every year I learn something new from the others in camp. New camp operators should not be a problem as I am sure they will pass along info. as they receive it. In summary I would not be to concerned on a owner change.
6263394,sheepman,2018-11-26 17:17:00,98,"Reach out to Tom at Sleepy Dog, as I understand it his father had the original camp on the lake and he has knowledge of Wabaskang"
6263428,Bullman,2018-11-26 19:25:00,17,"Thanks Billy and Sheepman. I will also contact Tom at Sleepy Dog as well as Dave up at Peffley's for some intel. Assuming the walleye will be holding deeper at this time of the year, but after reading every report on this site as well as Lake-Link, it appears many fish are still being caught in the 15 foot range as well as 20-25 fow. Always easier when fishing shallow water. I will have three newbies with me so simpler is going to be better. Hope I can put the pressure on the perch during mid-day. Always nice bringing home a bunch and easy for the others vs. finesse fishing for walleye. I also see the new owners will be at the Milwaukee Sports Show, so I will stop by and meet with them. Thanks everyone for all your posts and information. It really helps."
6263456,billy weaver,2018-11-26 21:17:00,470,"I have had good reports on Sleeping Dog, Tall Pines and Peffleys. I stay at Peffleys on the north end of the lake. The main difference in Peffleys and the others is that Peffleys is a boat in camp, the others are drive to camps. I really like Dave Peffley and the area at the north end. For new people Dave will mark up a lake map and give you some suggestions on depth, bait etc. There is usually no need for any long runs to get to your spot. He will take you out if needed but I don't think you would ever need. I am sure the other camps would do the same. Kevin S B on Walleye Central posted a trip last year to Tall Pines and it sounded good. Peffley has a dock and parking area at the south end just off hy#105 where he picks you up. We always buy our license etc at the Dutchies General Store and call him from there for pick up. We take our own boats and use him to carry our gear and some people. June and August can be a busy time for the camps so you should plan your trip and make a reservation by January. I am sure you would be happy with any of the three camps mentioned."

6226586,jsmyers,2018-07-27 11:54:00,198,"The bed of cabbage in front of Tall Pines Camp has always been a good spot for us. I thought this thread was interesting: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=684692. I never really thought twice about fishing this spot in front of a different camp, but then: I'm not a guide.There is a fair amount of boat traffic in that area, with Gawley's, Kingfisher, and Tall Pines all there together.When I was about 8, I caught my childhood-best northern in that spot. A somewhat skinny 31.5"" fish, with pretty massive jaws. IIRC, it weighed roughly 6.5 lbs. I had to struggle to hold it with its tail off of the ground. I don't remember the particular spot on the spot or the lure, but I remember thinking my lure was snagged. My drag just started pulling, like I had hooked into a log on the bottom of gotten buried deep in the weed. I believe I handed my rod to an adult for some help and they handed it back telling me that I had a fish. That fish was mounted and hung proudly on my wall until I graduated from high school. I ended up donating the mount to Clemson University's Campbell Museum (http://www.clemson.edu/science/depar...useum-map.html) when I moved away from there. That wasn't the only ""bigger"" fish we ever got there. Unfortunately, back then, a big pike would almost always go on the stringer. I suppose we felt like we had to show it off, and there was always a consideration of sending it to the taxidermy shop. A number of them were baked whole for a big dinner. That is probably part of the reason that I'm not sure our group every got one over ~35"" in the boat. (However, my grandfather started fishing Wabaskang ca. 1972, and I only started going in 1985, so there is a lot I didn't see.) The last couple decades of a slot limit and the ethic of only keeping smaller eaters, has done great things for Wabaskang, as I'm sure it has for most of NW Ontario. I now know why that spot is good:It has current dumping into it on one side from the Cedar River pouring over Perrault Falls.It tends to get hit by the prevailing west wind. (Though it would be even better if that basin was deep--it isn't.)It is a pretty large flat, with cabbage pretty deep on the far edge of it (rather than a narrow strip).One other individual northern I remember from that spot was my cousins. He would have been college-aged at that time. I was old enough to feel pretty grown up, but young enough to be a snot-nosed little kid from my cousin's point of view. I was probably ~11. Our fathers and our grandfather were napping late in the week during an August trip. We decided to go fishing--there are few times that we'd decide to do anything else. Again, I don't remember the lure or the spot on the spot, but I remember his excitement at having a big one and him being concerned about losing it at the boat. I scooped it up with the net and in my memory, I can feel his relief--the kid didn't bungle it. I don't even think he unhooked it; just set the net in the bottom of the boat, cranked up the motor and sped back to Gawley's. He had showing off to do. The fish was ~34"" and solid. He tied off the boat and shouted up to the cabin, ""Eh!"" (Back in the 80s and early 90s, we turned into the McKenzie brothers immediately upon crossing the border.) My uncle quickly ended up with the fish in hand on a short stringer. My dad was taking a shower, so he didn't hear the commotion My uncle would fix that. He stormed into the cabin, ran down to the bathroom, threw open the curtain, and cackled, ""look what our boys got!"" as he stuck the slimy pike--still pretty active--in the shower with his startled little brother. Now you don't usually hear about people catching pike on worms. But to hear my dad tell the story, upon seeing that distant stare with the toothy grin, then feeling the slimy tail slap him on the side, he was pretty concerned about the safety of his ""bait."""

We fished from doe island to the wine lake portage. Best was the humps in the ""Mean"" lake. One eye at 25 and rest were 15-18. Jigs with black plastics seemed the most productive along with thunder sticks. Lots on small northerns. Huge mayfly hatch and low lake level did not help. C Officers were very thorough- like searching cabins while we were out fishing. Doug"

6221662,Joek3,2018-07-15 06:03:00,244,Wally28 - did the low water levels prevent guys from doing the wine lake portage ?
6221792,wally28,2018-07-15 12:48:00,65,"Smaller boats were getting through; I had my own boat-17""- so did not attempt it of course."
6221880,billy weaver,2018-07-15 17:51:00,470,"We make the portage every year and did so again this year. If you have did it before you won't have any trouble. The lift coming back is a little steeper than usual but if you have the man-power it isn't too bad. I will say the portage is a lot easier with the Naden boats, the Princecraft and Alumacraft boats are heavy and if you don't have four or more stout guys I wouldn't try it.If you make the portage try the south-east corner of Beaver Lake. We have caught some nice perch there along with some decent walleye.The west end of Doe Island was the best area for us as well as deep water humps in Mean.Good fishing Billy"
6221914,Joek3,2018-07-15 18:41:00,244,"Yes, we have done the portage several times. Like to do it once each trip. Last we we switched boats the day we did it to one of the lighter ones. Only 2 of us so it worked well. This year I was concerned about all the water level comments. Hopefully they get some rain between now and September. We do go into Beaver and have caught some great perch back in that bay. Have also been shut out back there! We like fishing the points and islands in Wine."
