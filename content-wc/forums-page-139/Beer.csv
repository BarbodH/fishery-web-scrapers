6261240,Guest,2018-11-18 17:38:00,0,"Just drive a little farther north apparently. Our group makes the drive to Quebec every year and this thread made me wonder what their rules were if any different. In Quebec, the fines and penalties for driving a boat while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are the same as those applicable to operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. There is NO difference between drunk driving and drunk boating. However, boaters in Quebec are permitted to carry open alcohol on boats while the boat is underway. Even the boat operator may do so, as long as their BAC level does not exceed the legal limit of 80mg."
6261454,The tank,2018-11-19 14:36:00,340,We was loading up to go to camp one morning (boat in camp) and the mnr was putting in at the same time. They could see us carrying beer to the boat from the truck. So i went over and asked if i would get in trouble. He told me as long as we was transporting to camp there would be no problems. He said theres a gray line there.
6261804,lawson2343,2018-11-20 13:02:00,459,"I would just like to add clarity to your comment ""you can bring beer to shore lunch and drink on shore"". In Ontario, you can't legally drink on Crown land. So if you have shore lunch somewhere on the lake and it isn't private property, they can ticket you then as well. You can drink on private land. I researched this topic for our group a few years ago and found the information you found. I contacted the OPP to make sure we understood it properly. From that exchange, if someone in our group wants to have beer at shore lunch, they lock it in a compartment and only consume it while ashore on private property. Hope this helps."

6263164,drlee,2018-11-25 17:49:00,409,Please do. Thanks.
6263192,Musky Tom,2018-11-25 19:23:00,8,"This link may help https://www.boatsmartexam.com/know-t...ing-in-canada/ And this link from the US Coast Guard...bottom line drinking not allowed down in the USA either, even in a unpowered boat (ie canoe with paddles)http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2014/0...l-and-boating/ To me it's common sense, don't drink and drive so don't drink and boat Tom"
6263208,BreezyPoint,2018-11-25 21:24:00,1581,"Although I agree that boating and drinking is dangerous, the article you cited does not say is it is illegal to drink in a boat or operate a boat while drinking. It does say it is illegal to be BUI while operating a boat. Drinking in a boat is very much legal in Minnesota.Frank"
6263214,Musky Tom,2018-11-25 21:37:00,8,"Well this excerpt from the BoatSmart link copied/pasted ""What Are The Penalties For Drinking and Boating in Canada? If you're convicted of operating a boat while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the minimum penalties in Canada are: *1st Offence: A minimum fine of $600. *2nd Offence: A minimum fine of $600 and at least 14 days in prison. *3rd or Subsequent Offence: A minimum fine of $600 and at least 90 days in prison The MAXIMUM fines & penalties will vary province by province. When Can I Legally Consume Alcohol On a Boat in Canada? Boat passengers may legally consume alcohol on board a boat in Canada, so long as the boat is equipped with: *Permanent cooking facilities, *Permanent sleeping facilities, *A permanent toilet; and, The boat must be anchored or secured alongside a dock. Most yachts and houseboats will meet these requirements, but not all boat types will. As the boat operator, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure your boat meets these requirements before any passengers crack open any beer or liquor. It is also your responsibility to stay sober to make sure everyone gets home safe. Remember, boating while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is ALWAYS illegal, however, the rules for when alcohol can be legally consumed and transported on a boat vary from province to province."" So if your boat has permanent cooking and sleeping facilities and a permanent toilet, plus it's either anchored or secured alongside a dock then you can drink. Otherwise no. As for the specifics of Minnesota I agree I don't know, just stumbled across the USCG link that's all. Tom"
6263274,BreezyPoint,2018-11-26 10:13:00,1581,"Sorry, I was not clear in my previous post. I was referring to the post from the U.S. Coast Guard where you claimed it was illegal to drink in a boat in the U.S. Of course it is illegal in Ontario. We don't drink in our boat, whether in be Canada or the U.S. To me, it's just not a good idea.Frank"
6260634,tv4fish,2018-11-16 04:59:00,2694,"Our experience has been that most CO's do not ticket IF the beers are unopened and we tell them that we enjoy a beer for ""shore lunch""............"
6260650,Bobby Winds,2018-11-16 06:25:00,10817,So it's OK to fly the alcohol in but it's iffy to have them in a boat ? ? ?
6260912,wmd,2018-11-17 07:57:00,388,"Its not iffy, its against the law in Ontario to have alcohol in the boat. we were checked by MNR and OPP in June on Lake St Joe and they asked to look in the cooler. We did not have beer in the boat so I don't know if we would have been ticketed if we had. wmd"
6260924,CI_Guy,2018-11-17 09:21:00,2118,"But if you're stopped after your shore lunch you will have opened and empty beer cans in the boat. A father and son that were cleaning fish at Frog Rapids Camp at the same time we were told us how they had no beer with them in the boat but after their shore lunch they collected garbage that had been left by others that had used the same site. They were checked by a CO later in the day that commended them for picking up the garbage from the island, but warned them that they were technically in violation of the law by having empty beer cans in their boat. He appreciated what they had done but told them there may be some OPP officers that would not."
6260938,Bobby Winds,2018-11-17 09:56:00,10817,Just another reason to fish and spend my money in the GREAT U.S.A.
6260960,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-17 12:36:00,8293,So in Bobby's World it's better to stay home then to comply with the Canadian laws? I'm sure they are glad you stay home also. Laws are laws...........obey them or stay home.
6260962,billy weaver,2018-11-17 12:43:00,470,"A couple years ago a friend in camp at Wabaskang Lake got a ticket for empty beer cans in the bottom of the boat. $250. dollars. Ticket was for possession, not consuming which would have been more serious."
6261012,penner,2018-11-17 17:07:00,348,"Been fishing Ontario waters for a lot longer than I care to remember. Probably had a few beers with me 90% of the time and never been charged. Never been asked to open my cooler. BUT, don't be a dick to the Cops or they will probably get you with something. And, I don't think the CO 's can charge you but can hold you till the Cops arrive, but I could be wrong."
6261120,Bill Krejca,2018-11-18 08:11:00,6107,"Maybe the request to look in the cooler was to check for extra fish? Nahhh... On a more serious note, the culture/law seems to have changed with the passing of time. Back some years ago, when I used to remember most every thing, it was unheard of to have a check for alcohol in the boat, never asked about it, ignored any that was seen while being checked. I don't know if the law changed, or just started being enforced. I do remember some wild irresponsible actions on the water by others than my group, which maybe explains today's official stand on the subject. Bill"
6261126,Bobby Winds,2018-11-18 08:15:00,10817,So again..........no beer in the boat if even being transported but it's OK to have drugs onboard ? ? ? BTW how do the lodges that are served by roads get their alcohol ? ? ?
6260352,Jim Clark,2018-11-15 03:48:00,9,Is the no beer on boat law strictly enforced?
6260354,ogilville,2018-11-15 04:19:00,262,Only if you get caught.
6260358,jfaisten,2018-11-15 04:37:00,1060,"I boat in Canada waters frequently, Windsor area, and the beer deal is enforced. Not checked often but they look if they do stop you. Must have a pump out head if you have beer or it's ticketcity. Funny when you think about it -- OK to drink all the soft drinks you want and pee over the side of the boat -- not beer."
6260360,Guest,2018-11-15 04:40:00,0,I have seen them checking on the water where we go. Checking for anything in general but checked our coolers before.
6260390,CI_Guy,2018-11-15 07:02:00,2118,"I've been checked on the water by COs in Ontario twice, both times they looked for beer. I've also heard enough stories in camps and on fishing sites to think the rule is strictly enforced."
6260392,The tank,2018-11-15 07:12:00,340,"Ive fished 45 weeks in onrario since 1990. Ive been checked 5 times, twice we had a six pack in the boat for two guys. Both times the MNR told me to leave it at camp. Not sure how it works today but the one told me back than that he couldnt give me a ticket for it. It had to be the OPP. And if one was with him it would be a minimuim fine of $100 a can or bottle empty or full."
6260426,Obabikon,2018-11-15 09:00:00,2370,"I had an MNR officer stop guests this summer. They had 3 closed beers in their cooler. Told them they weren't supposed to have them, but to be responsible. Left them, left the beer, and moved on down the lake. He did stop in to the resort afterwards, and told me I needed to remind everyone that they aren't supposed to have beer in the boat. I said not a problem, most of our guests are more focused on fishing. He said he doesn't write tickets for people with a couple of beers, but that's not the way the law was written. Long story short... most MNR officers are good people, and make logical choices. Key word... MOST. Apply this story at your own risk."
6260466,BornToFish,2018-11-15 11:11:00,1224,"Greetings, I have a good friend that owns a fishing lodge in Ontario. I have heard him say on a few occasions that MOST Conservation Officers (CO) will take a position similar to what Obabikon reported: BE RESPONSIBLE! That said, I see the matter slightly differently. I suspect that a CO could use the presence of alcohol in the boat as a deciding point. If he/she doesn't like something going on in someone's boat, the officer might use the presence of alcohol to justify issuing a citation. On the other hand, if nothing is suspicious and the anglers are cooperative, the CO might choose to issue a verbal caution. The entire matter could come down to the line in a Clint Eastwood movie: ""Do you feel lucky today?"". My wife and I choose to never have alcohol in our boat. We wouldn't want to waste our luck on a matter such as alcohol when we could be using it for more important matters such as catching fish. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6260498,oldlund,2018-11-15 13:08:00,209,"I got off the a lake once at a ramp (Abram Lake, Sioux lookout- skunked) in Ontario 2 summers ago. There were 2 OPP officers who came out from behind a bush and approached us. Thankfully we didn't have any booze but it was obvious they were looking for action.

6260542,adempsey2.0,2018-11-15 16:01:00,611,"I believe it is no different than a car. So, you can have unopened containers of alcohol or containers stowed away in a closed container (e.g., your trunk).You cannot drink while operating [or in control of] any motorized vehicle.Quote: It is illegal to transport beverage alcohol in a motor vehicle, a motorized snow vehicle or a boat unless the beverage alcohol is in a container that is unopened and the seal unbroken, or unless the beverage alcohol is packaged in baggage that is fastened closed or is not otherwise readily available to anyone in the vehicle. In a boat, the beverage alcohol must be stored in a closed compartment. If you drink and then go operate a vehicle be sure to be within the legal blood level limit.So, you can bring beer to shore lunch and drink on shore. Just do not get drunk or go over the limit if you are driving the boat. The empties have to be stowed away properly I imagine.
