6261718,flipdip,2018-11-20 09:27:00,27,"Hey Dave, Funny to see this for as many times as we've chatted about Melchett. We are going to Poverty in June for the very first time. We decided late to do a quick father-son trip and was able to get in with Twin Lakes. will be the first time I've taken my son. Look forward to seeing any info you receive. I've been trying to find info about the lake but there's not much out there. Take care, flipdip"
