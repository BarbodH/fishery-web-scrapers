Its a great system for walleye, northern and smallmouth (with some musky in there as well) I cant speak for Maynard Lake Lodge as I dont go there but the system itself has great fishing"

The guide apologized for the poor fishing and that it was not normally that slow which I found humorous. We actually had a hard time some days finding fish small enough for shore lunch until we finally hit on a spot where there were enough smaller ones to get our shore lunch needs. I caught many 20-25 inch walleyes with a half dozen 26-28 inchers each day. I used a guide and he was super guy and fun to be with. The boats and cabin were excellent and they had a chef so the food was fantastic and plentiful The owners were really nice and would visit with the guests every day and showed real concern for their satisfaction. I didn't really try to fish for pike but picked up a few small ones by accident. I caught no smallmouth and don't recall anyone else doing so or fishing for them. It seemed everyone in camp was fishing for walleye. Their shore lunches were the best I have ever had on any of my Canadian fishing trips. Everyone would go to a single shore lunch spot and all the guides and the lodge staff very quickly set up for lunch- made the fish 2-3 different ways so you had a selection, had salad, 2 desserts, the usual potatoes and beans and another vegetable such as corn etc. and beverages. They quickly got everything cleared up so it was never more than an hour for shore lunch. I highly recommend them and the only reason I have not been back is due to health issues."
