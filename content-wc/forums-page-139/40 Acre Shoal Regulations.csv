6263930,1900Tyee,2018-11-28 14:17:00,75,"Hey guys, This is a Canada 50% and NYS 50% issue... If you have fished the shoal you might know there are three sets of fishing regulations. You have the NYS/Canada border - three trolling lines instead of one. You have the Canadian side bisected by an imaginary line connecting the eastern tips of Howe and Wolfe Islands with two regulations - to the east is one trolling line and no walleye size limts; to the west is two trolling lines and walleye size limits apply. As I type, there are probably differences in Ontario too. But it is kind of frustrating that there just wouldn't be one set of regulations. How about a line between Kingston and Cape Vincent...West is Lake Ontario rule and East is The Larry rule. I'm wondering how I could get a line drawn on my Helix map to keep track of the Howe/Wolfe line; I'm also wondering what happens when I get some walleye in Canada that don't meet the NYS rules and I have to head back to Clayton to pull the boat out of the water with those Canadian fish in my live well. On another front, but related, years ago I had purchased a bunch of minnows at the TI Bait Store in the US on my way to a few days fishing near Ivy Lea in Canada. At the border, they took the bait. On one hand I get the invasive species or whatever other environmental issue is motivating that action by the border patrol...but there is a pretty good chance those minnows came from water that was connected to the St. Lawrence system. It's not the minnows stay in there country of origin Anyway, I'm just jawing about it. But anyone know if I could get that line drawn on my Helix? Maybe just two waypoints that I connect as a route? 1900Tyee"

Regarding the regulations, it's best to just follow the most conservative rules in confusing areas like the shoals. That way you never have to worry."

Yep different regs east and west of Wolfe and Howe on the river. Plus the anything north of the shoreline is another zone. Just have to pay attention to your whereabouts."
6264186,1900Tyee,2018-11-29 13:36:00,75,"Awesome fish! I'm headed up to the Larry tomorrow to see if I can get lucky with another Musky. It will be fairly cool but the winds very light. That should make for an enjoyable day! I talked with NYS CO today and asked the question regarding fish caught in Canada that might be illegal in NYS (which is where you have to travel to pull the boat out). According to him, as long as you go straight to the boat launch in NYS without stopping to fish along the way its ok. If you stop to fish in NYS along the way...and while stopped you get questioned by a CO...they have to assume the fish in your live well were caught in NYS. Too many or too short...get out the checkbook! Anyway...again, nice fish! 1900Tyee"
