6262578,Thompmd,2018-11-23 17:15:00,320,Could anyone share their experiences on the following. We are going to Sioux Narrown June 15-22. I am considering taking my father in law(76) on a day fly in/out. Our wives might also be interested in going along for the flight only. Can you suggest a company that can do this We would also likely either fish for smallmouth or northern. i did do a day fly in from Nestor Falls about 15yrs ago and had a good experience but this is only our 2nd trip to the Sioux Narrows area.
6262972,Bstar,2018-11-25 07:13:00,564,I'm assuming that you are staying at a lodge/camp in Sioux Narrows? If so I would check with your camp owner. He may be able to set it up for you and even have the plane pick you up at their dock. Otherwise I would call a few of the fly-in operators and inquire about doing a day fly-in.
