547324,Guest,2005-04-26 15:14:00,0,"Early this morning I spotted Barney just below our sewage outlet tube fishing. I asked him how he was doing and he said"" Got a couple floaters, but they are biting awful soft""."
548338,Guest,2005-05-25 11:21:00,0,Who's Barney??? Or what are you talking about?
548359,Guest,2005-05-25 14:31:00,0,"Sorry I'm late. I am Barney. I am alive and well. Been eating good. Doing some dancing, some singing, lots of fishing. Hope to see all of you sometime soon. Now shut up and fish! ~Barney"
547182,Guest,2005-04-21 14:08:00,0,"It is my understanding that Barney is a actual person who fishs Canada on a regular basis. This Barney is not the Purple Fella on TV....he is has big as life...all 4' 10"" of him."
547188,Guest,2005-04-21 20:34:00,0,"So you are saying Barney is real? Next you will tell me that Santa is a big Artic Grayling Fly-fisherman, and the Easter Bunny likes to hunt squirrels. I will believe there really is a Barney when I see a post from him!!"
547198,Guest,2005-04-22 07:29:00,0,"Barney, It is time for you to rise up and tell the world you are really a Walleye Fisherman Extreme. Come on Barney get in here and post."
547204,Guest,2005-04-22 13:53:00,0,Barney slipped through our Drive Thru today about 1:30. He picked up a #2 Special with Coke. I know it was him because I could see his fishing hat in the window of his Volkswagon and his Snoopy Rod in the back seat.
547206,Guest,2005-04-22 14:49:00,0,It was an imposter...everyone knows that Barney only gets Happy Meals!!!
547211,Guest,2005-04-22 23:48:00,0,Actually Barney died.
547220,Guest,2005-04-23 12:43:00,0,"I saw a guy of diminutive stature at Cabela's yesterday buying one of those fishing yardsticks that makes 12"" look like 20"". He was muttering to himself "" This'll fool em, those $%#@&^%'s. I wasn't sure if he meant other fisherman or the driver's license bureau."
547238,Trailerguy,2005-04-24 18:01:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]This morning we were traveling on HWY 105 just north of Vermillion Bay, Ont. I saw a grease spot on the hiway, with the ravens were sitting on a carcass in the ditch. I was busy swerving around what looked like a new ""snoopy"" pole with a Zebco on it, but the wife said she saw something purple in a green outfit that the Ravens were picking at."
547248,Guest,2005-04-25 07:09:00,0,Saw a little fella crying because he was too short too ride the rollercoaster at Six Flags. I think it was Barney because he had a hand full of Rapalas and in his other hand was map of Gullrock.
547257,Guest,2005-04-25 10:12:00,0,"Barney was inducted into the ""Midget Hall Of Fame"" last night in St Paul, Minnesota. He gave a speech that had all the attendees in tears. Barney was standing on a 50 gallon drum behind the speakers podium so we could all see his face. He also had on a Zebco hat on so the bright lights would not cause a glare off of his bald head."
547140,Guest,2005-04-19 14:20:00,0,I know it is early in the fishing season but BARNEY is lurking out there somewhere. If you have seen him please report his where abouts.
547141,Guest,2005-04-19 14:53:00,0,"Spotted him last week at the local ""Midget Supply Store"". He was buying some new waders and I couldnt help but notice that the waders had a 19"" inseam. He also picked up a ladder so he could climb into his boat and a step stool so he could see over the side while fishing."
547143,Larry S,2005-04-19 18:48:00,666,Saw Barney on PBS yesterday his green outfit looked good against his purple skin
547149,Guest,2005-04-20 08:44:00,0,Saw Barney early this morning running across my pasture with a Minnow Bucket and minnow Seine in his hands. I could just barely see the top of his head because the grass is almost two foot high.
547152,Guest,2005-04-20 10:09:00,0,"Saw the little rascal at Gander Mountain . He was buying a map for Gullrock. This is probably a bad sign for Gullrock because if he is fishing there this summer the 12"" to 14"" Walleye are in trouble. He was also picking up a booster chair for his boat seat."
547159,Guest,2005-04-20 13:14:00,0,Got letter from Barney. He will be at my Gullrock wigwam June 3. Cant wait to see little white eyes.
547164,Guest,2005-04-20 14:35:00,0,Im looking for him too. He really hurts the small Walleye population no matter where he fishs.
547178,Guest,2005-04-21 08:44:00,0,Barney stopped in the cafe this morning for breakfast. He had a Short Stack and a small OJ.
547179,Guest,2005-04-21 09:00:00,0,"Satanic Barney Proof Given: Barney is a CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR Prove: Barney is satanic The Romans had no letter 'U', and used 'V' instead for printing, meaning the Roman representation would for Barney would be: CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR Extracting the Roman numerals, we have: CV V L DI V And their decimal equivalents are: 100 5 5 50 500 1 5 Adding those numbers produces: 666. 666 is the number of the Beast. Proved: BARNEY IS SATAN!"
547181,Guest,2005-04-21 09:45:00,0,Barney stopped in today and picked up a new Zebco 202 and a Snoopy Pole.
