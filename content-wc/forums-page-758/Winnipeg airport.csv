548356,tjsker,2005-05-25 14:12:00,301,We're thinking of flying my father to the Winnipeg Inter. Airport and picking him up on our way to fishing in Ontario. Is this airport pretty easy to get around in? BTW - does a U.S. citizen need a passport to fly into Canada?

As of 2006 you will need to have a passport to fly into Canada....and right now it would make things go much smoother. In the absense of a passport make sure he has a valid ID (drivers liscense) and a birth certificate...if you don't have those two things they can deny him entry and at the very least will hassle him at customs...been there done that.

The internation arrivals will come up from the lower level after clearing customs. You can park in either of the closer two parking lots and it's not too far from the terminal building. The closer you can get to the north side of the terminal, the closer you will be to where you'll come out after picking him up."
