I will be staying at Mahkwa Lodge and plan to fish that area. During that time what is a general pattern for walleyes on that section of lake (bottom bouncers, jigs ect.)? Is there any kind of electronic map for my LCX 25 for the lake or any good paper maps for this region? Are the fish relating to points and rocks in the 17 to 25 feet range at that time of the year? Any other direction would be greatly appriecated."
548397,Guest,2005-05-26 06:58:00,0,No electronic maps for the lake I am aware of....this is a fairly remote place. The wallys will be in traditional summer spots and you will not have problems finding them. The best advice I could give you is to watch the Silver Water Wheel Lodge fishing reports. Watch out for the rocks. Maps are available at any reputable local sporting goods stores. I know that Thorne Bros has them.
