548340,Guest,2005-05-25 11:45:00,0,"A few years ago, many guys rumoured the idea of tranquilizing bears, driving down to Queen's Park (home of the Ontario Provincial Legislature) in the middle of night and letting them wake up as the members of provincial parliament head in to work. A few dozen bears around downtown Toronto (acting in the same manner as they do in other Northern Ontario towns) may help them understand? Anyone have access to tranquilizers and large, secure trailers?? I'll drive!!"
548316,wooglin,2005-05-25 07:01:00,371,"Last year, I had to chase a bear out of camp with our truck. He bit into our cooler and knocked over our grill. He destroyed the tent on the site next to us. We dealt with him in our camp for the first 4 days of our trip, until the MNR came on-site and 'shot over his head'. We had two bear trailer-traps within 40 feet of our camp site. I have never seen so many bear in my life, every mile on the road was a bear in the ditch... Any ideas if the spring bear hunt was re-instated, or can I expect to have bears crawling all over the place near Sioux Lookout?"
548319,Trailerguy,2005-05-25 07:14:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Tronto doesn't have a bear problem, so nobody else has one either,he,he. Until bears are roaming the streets in that town don't expect to see a spring bear hunt. They'd rather spend money to relocate the bear than add money to the economy hunting them.It will only get worse with time, when BMU's are sold, usually when the camp holding them is sold, the new owners are restricted to harvesting 1 bear per BMU. The politicians seem to think letting the population of male bears rise, by not hunting them,so they kill all the cubs,is the way to manage the population."

The guys from MN in the site next to use kept hatchets in their tents - they're the ones who had their screen tent shredded because they kept some food in it...not good."

548323,bigfish1965,2005-05-25 07:32:00,3210,They just had a bear in Newmarket just a bit north of Toronto and a bear in a schoolyard in Peterborough just N/E of Toronto. I think soon the weenies will see the light.
548324,wooglin,2005-05-25 07:36:00,371,"Hopefully. This is my third year going to Canada. The first year, we saw no bear. Last year, I couldn't believe it. I almost knocked a guy out too for tossing food to the bear....and we wonder why they stuck around camp?? Well, I doubt the problem will be fixed in 29 days, so I guess its Bear Mace and Buck knives..."
548325,Jimmy Jig,2005-05-25 07:51:00,1905,Dont let the wardens caught you with mace.
548326,wooglin,2005-05-25 07:52:00,371,Is that illegal?
548327,Trailerguy,2005-05-25 08:27:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Pepper spray and mace as used on humans are illegal, but ""Bear spray"" isn't. It typically is pepper spray in a large aresal labelled for use to discourage Bears."
548332,Guest,2005-05-25 09:54:00,0,">the ""concealed"" cans are illegal along with anything else you can hide. the big bear mace cans are good. i have a place just outside of sioux lookout that i go to and rent for about 4 months out of the year. i also bow hunt bear. when they closed the spring hunts 5 or 6 years ago, seeing a couple bears during the week was a good hunt. now i get two bears in the yard a day and they are up and down our road like stray dogs. Fall hunting has been better from the porch but not worth the hassle and worry with the kids in the spring. MNR has trapped them in the past but they just take them to the edge of the WMU and let them go. cant say that i have seen the exact same bear come back twice but the look awful alike and when you pull one out, there are 5 there to fill the void. >[font color=green size=3][b]Pepper spray and mace as used on >humans are illegal, but ""Bear spray"" isn't.
