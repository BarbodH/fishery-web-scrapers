A bear ripped open the cover on a boat and ate food left in bins inside the boat in July. Not a lot of damage, but it made a huge mess. She said it happens fairly often. If you are bringing food, instead of going to a grocery store, heed this warning."
547346,troutaholic,2005-04-27 06:09:00,827,"Processed food is acceptable. The issue with potatoes...fruits...other vegetables is the dirt and/or larvae that may be on/in the foods. By processing, you eliminate the risks... Processed potatoes (Simply potaotoes) are no problem, AND they arean excellent product when you buy them on sale!!! Their southwestern potatoes are almost heaven-made!!!! Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
547467,Guest,2005-05-01 09:17:00,0,"I understand about people having their favorite brands etc, with a specific taste. (Just think of the look on an American waitress' face when a Canadian asks for gravy on their french fries-or ask an American Subway employee for Salt n Vinegar Chips. I also understand that most want to get to their destination without delay, but lets face it, we're guys, we always forget something, or we always hear about the hottest lure and we seem to have to have it before we continue on to the lodge. We usually have to stop for something.......... Sorry guys, didn't want a debate, just trying to bide my time til opener. Kind of a Potato/Pototo arguement. ""Tastes Great-Less Filling"" sort of thing........."
547471,Pooch,2005-05-01 13:18:00,4619,"Over the years we have grown to like many of the Canadian brands better than those in the states. We work off of a list and get a big bunch of our food at the Safeway. Be it Fort Francis, Dryden and (if it is open) the one in Thunder Bay. Still like Labotts Blue light better up there than down here though. For the most part, taters is taters..... Pooch"
547474,wiggle,2005-05-01 14:07:00,400,Just came thru the border this weekend. They didn't ask if we had potatoes. Not sure if that means the ban is off...but they didn't ask.
548240,MTWalleyeHunter,2005-05-22 20:28:00,61,A lot of it has to depend where in the US the spuds are coming from and what Province you are traveling into. Same issues arise when returning to the US with foreign agricultural products.
548330,Guest,2005-05-25 09:17:00,0,"If you bring them and they ask Does anyone know what the consequences are. Do they just take them or are you fined or what? Last year I went camping at the Pinery Provincial park in southern ontario. They had a sign posted that said ""Firewood brought from outside the park is prohibited due to the emerald ash borer problem"" Then the sign proceeded to say ""if you did bring in outside firewood, Please make sure you burn it!!"" What a penalty!"
548331,Trailerguy,2005-05-25 09:50:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Potatos are confiscated or at times, the owner is asked to return them to the USA side. This causes you to either walk them back to US Customs or pull out of line and drive back. That happened last summer in Fort Francis a number of times. As for the firewood sign, it makes perect sense for someone who made an honest mistake to burn the wood that harbours the insects. Also the CFIA's penalties aren't any cheaper than the MNR's. It never ceases to amaze me why anybody would bring their own firewood, when surronded by a forest,lol."
548334,tjsker,2005-05-25 10:33:00,301,"I used to bring all the food I can into Canada, but this year I'm going lean. I'll bring a little cereal to get me and my boys through the first morning then we'll take a trip into Kenora for supplies on a at-need basis. I've learned that you could spend too much money on food you don't use. Plus you don't have to worry about keeping stuff cool during the roadtrip."
548339,Guest,2005-05-25 11:24:00,0,Or he can't read french? }(
547256,Guest,2005-04-25 09:38:00,0,"Is it okay to bring potatoes that are the kind that need to be refrigerated like ""Simply Potatoes""? These are fresh potatoes that are sliced, etc. and packaged in the bag. They are the lazy mans way of fixing potatoes."
547260,jigman 2003,2005-04-25 10:34:00,981,I brought in frozen spuds last year with no problem. I told the border guard I had them and he said they were fine. Ban only applies to fresh spuds.
547301,Guest,2005-04-26 10:22:00,0,"I'm curious to know why you want to bring potatoes across the border to your lodge; they cost about 40 cents a pounds in Canada. How much money do you want to save; if you're saving any at all. 20 pounds of spuds for shore lunches will set you back about $6 at Safeway. What are you saving and is it worth the issue at the border? If American Idaho's are so good then why does Manitoba supply EVERY McDonald's restaurant,(in the Chicago area), potatoes for their french fries........ Bring beer if anything. Keep your rod tip up and report all tappers........... this isn't a rant, I just can't believe potatoes are taking up so much talk on a fishing website. Unless you are cutting them up for bait.........."
547302,Bean,2005-04-26 10:36:00,20,"My guess is that he won't have to find a grocery store once he crosses the border and can drive straight to his destination. I prefer not having to make an extra stop if I don't have to when I'm driving somewhere also. He's asking about processed potatoes, not potatoes sold in bulk. Just my thoughts."
547303,Trailerguy,2005-04-26 10:43:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If you've traveled much you know different locations have different customs and tastes. Beer for instance, I love a cold Blue with freinds in Ontario, but it's flavor is diferent from the Miller Draft I drink at home. When you travel you take some things that you know you can depend on while trying new things as well. I'm curious why it bothers Canadians what an American brings to eat? I certianly don't care, or even want to know, where the raw fish came from that is eaten by Oreintal folks, as an example. It isn't always about saving a penny, eh."
547305,Bill Krejca,2005-04-26 11:04:00,6107,"Winni, Sometimes it is just convenient to get as many things done before crossing the border. Many of us folks just end up forgetting stuff even when we make another stop. After driving maybe a long ways, and stopping to pick up bait, liscense, beer, bread, trying to remember what we can and cannot have when crossing the border, etc, can make it easy to forget something. This is not a reflection on not wanting to buy Canadian, but rather maybe just having one more thing out of the way early. For me, preparation for the trip, i.e., getting groceries, putting on new line, picking out baits and equipment to bring, etc, is as much fun, well, almost, as the actual fishing experience. Getting to the resort and then realizing I forgot something does not make me the most popular fellow in our party. With all my lists, it seems I still manage to not bring something or other that I was in charge of. Hope this maybe explains the guys inquiry, at least, that's my excuse, eh."
547307,Guest,2005-04-26 11:11:00,0,"Well said, Bill."
547311,bigfish1965,2005-04-26 11:50:00,3210,I think thats one of the inherent Canadian/American differences. Canadians will never tote anything that they can buy somewhere near the destination. Saves room for more lures. We always get groceries near the camp as possible. It also gives you a chance to partake in the local scene. Have found some cool local foods that way.
547313,Guest,2005-04-26 12:00:00,0,You can eat when you get back to a town. :):)
547320,Guest,2005-04-26 12:36:00,0,"Winnipegger- We always stop in Canada to buy our milk,eggs, any items that need refrigerated because we fly out of Pickle Lake and it saves on ice but we have never seen these bags of processed potatoes. They work slick- one bag is enough for 4 people. I didn't mean for the post to turn into a debate, just wanted info. By the way the only fish I keep is for dinner,never take any back to the good old USA."
