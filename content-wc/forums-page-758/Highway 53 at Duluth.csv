548197,VANT,2005-05-21 12:16:00,68,What's going on with 53 at Duluth by now? Is it done and is there a decent way through or around Duluth? Thanks. VANT
548203,Hammerhead Herb,2005-05-21 17:30:00,259,"I don't know if it is done, but I think that the detour that they have you use is better than taking 53. You just go N on I-35 to Messabi to MN-194."
548206,Guest,2005-05-21 19:36:00,0,The highway work is all done. Very user friendly and nice road. It has been open for a few months now.
548213,rebelrn2001,2005-05-21 21:49:00,1563,GREAT!! Less than 20 days to go.
548258,VANT,2005-05-23 17:22:00,68,"Thanks guys, it seemed like it took forever to get through Duluth last year. Which of those two routes do you think is faster? VANT"
548387,rpieske,2005-05-25 22:26:00,1276,The current route is the fastest.
548396,VANT,2005-05-26 06:57:00,68,"By current route, do you mean 53 now that it is done? Thanks, VANT"
