548310,bronzeback77,2005-05-24 23:00:00,97,I am thinking about trying some Walleye fishing after dark this year. We will be fishing LOTWs next week May 27th-June 5th. I know of some great reefs very close tour lodge that I have always wanted to try after dark. What can I expect fishing at night? Should I cast or troll? What baits work best? I was thinking about casting Shad Raps to the bank and retrieving them back towards the edges of the reefs. Are there any colors that work better than others? Any suggestions would be appreciated.

During the day if your catching them bottom bouncing you probably won't have much luck at night doing that. We find Walleyes suspended over shallower water, and even some times over deep water. Working a bait by casting to shore is a good starting point. Even trolling works good if your confident with your area. As we all know many parts of LOTW can be dangerous after dark with shallow reefs, rocks, etc. We use GPS and spot lights to help guide us, but still don't go too far from the lodge. With all of the Islands it can get confusing without a GPS that you completely understand. Note- My favorite way of fishing Eyes is when the sun goes down. I have boated more BIG eyes this way then any other way. Don't be afraid of using LARGER baits to get these fish. We use baits that would be considered Pike or even Muskie sized lures with great success at night. Walleyes are not shy at night like they are during the day. There are sputs where the bite is slow, but then there are times when they just go nuts. Good luck and let us know how you did!"
