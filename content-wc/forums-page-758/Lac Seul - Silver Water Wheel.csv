547365,Guest,2005-04-27 12:11:00,0,"Our group was one of the lucky ones last year to get moved from the waiting list to the fishing list at Mike's SWW lodge. Can't say enough about how great Mike and his team are as well as the overall service / accomodations. We fished the 2nd week of June and conditions were pretty cold compared to our previous 3 trips on Lac Seul around the same time. Despite cold temps we still had great walleye fishing. However, the northern's were not in the bay's and the only northern caught were the ""one-offs"" on jigs fishing for wallies. This year, were head'n back to the SWW for 5 days of fishing beginning on May 31. With the early ice out, any thoughts or speculation on how the northern fishing might be? A couple of guys in our group enjoy taking an afternoon walleye break to go search out these ugly snakes.....and yes, I've been known to enjoy catching the bigger snakes as well! Thanks and good fishing to all."
547369,Mike Kansas,2005-04-27 13:48:00,1463,I agree wuth you 100% about how great a place SWWL is. Went there last year for the first time and Mike and his entire staff went the extra mile to make our stay a great time. We caught plenty of Walleye including many big fish and the food is just like Mom's cooking. I go to Lac Seul four weeks a year and go to different Lodges each trip. But our entire group is looking forward to enjoying SWWL again this coming August.
547378,Guest,2005-04-27 16:05:00,0,"Hey KC and Mike, It's always nice to hear positive feedback on SWWL. Well, May 31st eh? Always an interesting time of year. I'm feeling long-winded today so I will rant for a while . . . OK, the pattern at this time of year is of course largely dependent upon two things on Lac Seul. One is the water level and the second is the spring weather. According to the graphs of the water control board, the water level is slightly above the norm for this time of year, but rememeber the high temperatures and advanced spring conditions of the previous two weeks have brought forth an earlier spring freshet. I would suggest levels should be close to 'normal' heading into this summer, although significant rain or drought in the next 3-4 weeks could change that. Now, onto the weather thing. I have to tell you right now it is overcast and cold (just above freezing)in NWO. There was a dusting of flurries the last few days, far from the temps in the 70's we witnessed two weeks ago. Last year, we had what seemed to be an advanced spring going in NWO in April, but it all of a sudden stopped!! I remember it was virtually the same weather conditions up here at the end of May as at the end of April, with some nasty stuff in between. There was almost a foot of snow on the SWWL lawn on May 12 last year, despite being grass earlier. And so last year became a very, very slow spring, and not surprisingly the fish were slow to get going. I am really hoping this return to cold temperatures this week is not a sign of something like last year starting all over again. I did see on The Weather Network, the upper-atmospheric models are predicting below average temperatures for northern Ontario this spring, with above average temps for the western prairies and B.C. I am hoping they are wrong or the effects are minimal. So, given what we have to work with RIGHT NOW, and of course things could change over the next month, we are looking at water levels probably close to normal, and a normal or slightly cool spring. The other MAJOR factor to mention now is the ice is already out, so even if the weather were similar to the trend last year (of a long, cold spring), the ice is off far earlier than normal. What does all this mean for fishing???? . . . Well walleyes require a certain temperature to start spawning, in fact many would argue the biggest factor affecting walleye location in the spring (spawn, post-spawn, transition, early summer) is water temperature. The research seems to agree spawning could start around 42-45 degrees. After spawning, most walleyes move to nearby post-spawn locations to forage, and sometime thereafter start the transition to summer locations based upon water temperature and forage available. In an ""average"" spring on Lac Seul (and it can be difficult sometimes to distinguish just what is 'average') it may be in the 40's on the main lake, low-50's in the shallower back bays and in the mid- to upper-50's in the shallowest sun-warmed water. These warmer, protected areas are of course the traditional locations for post-spawn walleyes, and those warmest shallowest areas, usually full of wood, veg., etc. are the traditional locations to target early-season pike. The take-home message here I guess is the importance of water temperature. Soooooooo, an earlier ice out does not necessarily mean warmer water temperatures earlier in the year, but it does THEORETICALLY allow the lake to potentially start warming earlier (i.e., if you recall high school science class, the water in the glass does not start to warm until all of the ice cubes have melted). This would lead us to believe that even if cold weather persists through spring like last year, water temperatures could still be warmer at the end of May. This would be a good thing for fishing, particularly for the pike fishing KC. Many of my best pike fishing experiences on Lac Seul came around June 1st, with a combination of the water temperature conditions similar to those I mentioned above, and a warm sunny afternoon (this is key). Essentially, the pike are in a post-spawn pattern and sense the warmer water. The warm sun of a spring afternoon can draw pike into those shallows to ""sun themselves"", and by 3 p.m. or so they are warm, and hungry, and have enough energy to chase things around. Now introduce a spoon, or spinnerbait, or even a shallow-running crank and look-out. You wouldn't think those big girls would get that excited but they do, and the smaller males can be rediculous in these situations. I have seriously played games with guests to see if they could get their line back to the boat WITHOUT a pike, with the small males just going nuts for anything that shines. Now these are the optimal conditions, and they usually transpire only a couple days a year, but the general theory still exists anytime, anywhere with regard to early-season pike fishing. These conditions, or even similar conditions, were simply non-existent last year with the continued cold of the spring. Now, I have kept talking about ""normal"" or a colder than normal year, but what if things went the other way? As in, what if the weather is constantly hot and sunny for the next three weeks? Well, then we may have a different problem, particularly with regard to pike fishing when you combine the early ice out. Another trend which is consistently reaffirmed with walleye and pike fishing on Lac Seul is that overall the larger fish (mainly females) are usually the first to move, for example say from post-spawn to early summer transition spots. An early, warm spring could mean many of the big girls have already left for the deeper water, which makes them more difficult to target. In particular, the best chance at a trophy pike (where you are actually pike fishing and throwing hardware and targeting them) is the spring (targeting transition and summer walleye is far easier than pike on Lac Seul). Experience has shown the best opportunity at a trophy pike in the summer is actually walleye fishing. Pike can be up in the shallows before the ice is even gone, often scratching their backs on the underside of the ice. With ice-out early, if it were to get warm fast, many of the largest pike will be out of the shallows for much of the day, by the end of May. They can still pulse back in there though, and there will still surely be plenty of small and mid-size pike in these locations, but chances are less likely for hooking the biggest monsters. Once the water temp gets into the mid- to upper-60's in those shallow post-spawn pike spots, the biggest pike are gone. No matter what, a warmer-than-normal spring would be better than the far cooler-than-normal conditions witnessed last spring for pike and walleye. Soooooo, I said I would rant for a while, and to be honest I could go on. Of course, THIS IS JUST THE THEORY, based on different conditions. As the weather (most notably temperature and precipitation) unfolds over the next couple weeks here, the theory and anticipated trends can better be established to coincide with the given situation. We know the ice is out, now it is a matter of changes in the water level and most notably the weather. YES INDEED, IT IS THAT TIME AGAIN!!! NWO Fishing Bum"
547383,FIB,2005-04-27 20:29:00,23,NWO - That was a good read. Thanks for sharing the info. I have had experiences on Lac Suel that i believe back up your theories. A nice pike (high 30's+) makes a makes a weeks trip complete in my mind.
547391,Guest,2005-04-28 08:28:00,0,"NWO, Great post...but what color of jig do you recommend for June???"
547523,Guest,2005-05-02 19:18:00,0,"Well, I'll give my input. First, in terms of numbers of Pike, last year's statistics are not indicative of long-term trends. The cold spring, kept most pike absent from their traditional early-summer shallow water locations, when they are most targeted. Consequently, numbers were down for that normal shallow pike bite as they were not targeted, then nor much of the summer. With that in mind, the numbers from previous years may be somewhat more indicative of the fishery, ALTHOUGH (and this is a MAJOR point)pike overall are targeted a small percentage by most anglers at SWWL. People who devote more time and effort to targeting pike would certainly see greater trends than those listed for the lodge as a whole. The simple fact is Lac Seul is perhaps the best walleye fishery in the world at consistently producing large volumes of 5-10lb walleye. If you are going for that 'trophy' fish, your best bet on Lac Seul is for a walleye (in my opinion). Great pike are present as well, but not near in the same capactiy, and whence are not targeted as much. Like I said in the post above, I have found certain sets of conditions which seem optimal for pike fishing, but there are lots of times when the conditions exist in which I, as the guide, think pike fishing (of a certain manner, technique, location, etc) may be a good option, particularly if the walleye outlook is bleak. But overall, that represents a small percentage of the time. So again, in using the SWWL statistics to discuss Lac Seul pike trends, you must account for the fact that walleye, are by far, the primary targeted species. NOW, to put the numbers aside and think ecologically, there was so much pike meat harvested from Lac Seul 20, 30, 40 years ago it had to have been destructive to the population. How much? I don't know. Was over-exploitation more harmful to the pike fishery than to the walleye fishery? Again, I don't know. But there certainly are more ""relatively"" large walleye around than there are ""relatively"" large pike. Anyway, I don't know if that solves any debate . . . Again, I'll grant you that I sound like Mike, but I am simply not him. We both share a love for fishing, we had similar childhoods with regard to fishing, we both started guiding Canadian Sheild walleye lakes around age 20, we're both scholarly and heavily devoted to education, formally and informally, to ourselves and to others, and we even both have blond hair, but above all else, we have shared hundreds and hundreds of reflective conversations with regard to fishing on Lac Seul. The knowledge is developed from those experiences and from that reflection, and after numerous years, it is not surprising that he and I (a humble bum) sound similar when we report on fishing, fishing experiences, and offer advice, or put forth outlooks. Opener is soooooooon . . . and weather is warming. 50 tomorrow, 55 Wednesday, and 60 expected for Thursday and Friday. Oh yeah, and the new Loomis is on its way. NWO Fishing Bum"

Kidding hehe... You must be good friends with Mike, do you keep in touch still? Maybe he is feeding you this information to write on these posts...who knows. All I know is the lake rocks out man, i slay the fish everytime I've been. I don't know what all this about the pike fishing being crappy, i still manage to bring home my limit of pike plus my one trophy and i always get it. usually more than one trophy but they don't let you keep it for some reason...mnr thinks they own the lake or something!! Gotta go, nature calls x("
547542,Guest,2005-05-03 07:27:00,0,"I have fished Lac Seul for 22 years and we do spend our late afternoons fishing for Pike. We catch a reasonable amount of 40"" + Pike every year (2004 8 40""+). We fish deeper water next to weedbeds casting large spoons dressed with 6"" plastic and fish the bottom up. We also cast large plastics on large jigs. You can catch the short fish in the weedbeds but the big girls seem to lay off the beds and like the deeper water. Use your depth finder to find irregular structure on the bottom and points close to depth and work those areas hard. Seems that windy areas are always better just like the Walleye. We have also had good luck the last few years working timber and stump areas with 3/4oz spinnerbaits. The 34"" to 37"" pike seem to be the rule but the big girls are there too."
547547,Guest,2005-05-03 08:16:00,0,"Bum, How were the pike harvested 20,30,40 years ago? How did they get overharvested? I am confused. What is your opinion on how long it takes to grow a 40"" pike in Lac Seul? And although I do agree more people target the wally population, that should in theory make the pike fishing better in terms of angler hours needed per 40""+ pike, correct? The muskies in the NE part of the lake have attained some serious proportions....so why not the pike? I have never fished the NE portion, are there really big pike up there in better numbers than the other part of the lake? Archie, I am not saying there are no 40""+ out there, I just dont think the numbers are there that should be there. I fish a lot of pike there and 40""+ are hard to come by. I agree the 34""-38"" are the norm. I dont think I have ever seen a fish over 44""."
547548,Guest,2005-05-03 08:39:00,0,"Berretaman, I agree with you the 40""+ Pike are far and few between. When we first started fishing Lac Seul in 83 we did get bigger Pike on a normal basis and many more Pike than we do today. We had a lots of 200 plus pike days up through the mid 90's and the biggest we ever got was 45"". Im far from an expert but I think the lake has been cultivated to be such a great Walleye lake that the general Pike population is no longer the predator as much as the Pike fingerlings are the food. The slot on Walleye allows for many more big Walleye and they have a voracious appetite. There are still great opportunitys to catch big Pike but it takes a lot of hard fishing and a touch of luck always helps. Another fishing change on Lac Seul is the rapid growth over the last ten years of the Smallmouth population. They used to be a rarity but now we catch 50 to 60 every week we fish and that is while fishing for Walleye. Lac Seul will always be my choice lake to fish and like all of Mother natures gifts it changes with the time and it will change many more times."
548388,Jigger1,2005-05-25 22:40:00,234,"Well the gang is all here. It's great to hear that Griff is doing well, I've been wondering how he's been doing ever since I heard the news. Please wish him my best, we'll all miss him this year. Alright Mr. Bum now on to business of course we haven't given up our spot. I'll be locked in that slot for many years to come. My biggest dilemma down the road will be when to plan week #2. So with that said, I'm looking forward to seeing you on or around Canada Day, which as you may recall is also Keith's B-Day. That 31 was a great present for him AV, nice work. I still remember the shouting and hollering half way across the lake. Since you asked, I think the reason why AV moved south was because he was still trying to recover from a bad case of Lac Seul carpal tunnel syndrome. Just too many walleye's and a quite possibly, but I won't mention it a weak wrist! Did I just say that? Jog my memory ... please! Every day on that slice of heaven called Lac Seul is burned into my brain. I knew that was an MA when I saw it. Hope to see you both and the rest of the gang when I'm up at SWWL for the sixth consecutive year. Simply said there is nothing finer - the crew at SWWL and yes even the retired crew are second to none! Still hunting for my 30. Jigger1"

If it's 3 you're one of the best jig fisherman I've ever seen and you guided my brother-in-law to not 1, not 2, but 3 MA's in two days. Still won't forgive you for that! If it's 5, I've not had an opportunity to fish with you because you're always guiding a different group when my group is in camp, but we've had some good conversations on Canada Day in front of a bonfire and I know your knowledge of the lake is about as deep as anyone. Truth be told, I'm leaning towards the 3. Is Glen guiding this year or just visiting? Only 36 days until we arrive in paradise and I can't wait. Jigger1"
548280,tlars,2005-05-24 11:28:00,137,This is going to be our second time closing SWWL for the season. Last year we were treated like the first guests of the year. What a place! Of course the downside is that I have to wait until Sept. 20. Lars.

548343,Guest,2005-05-25 12:25:00,0,"Ha, ha, ha. It's 3, Jigger1. I appreciate the praise. Interestingly enough, Bob Hartley's fish mentioned previously came from the group immediately preceeding yours, that same year as Blake's success. His son, Kendal, also got one, and I chimed in as well, as you know I like to do. All together, it was 8 M.A.'s in 7 days over that stint in my boat, and is perhaps the greatest consolidated, one-week period I have had on Lac Seul, not forgetting the incredible numbers for all sized fish, not just the top end. I am STILL in school, eight years of university and counting. Can you tell I like the academic life? Glen and I are actually in Thunder Bay, and fishing a variety of water. Neither of us are guiding full-time, although we may be around at times, which brings me to something else . . . Are you going to be there over Canada Day again this year? I would suspect you will be, you're smart enough to know you should never give up that spot. Glen and I are discussing a Canada Day-4th of July camping/fishing excursion to Seul. Griff gets back from a trip to Alberta today, and I need to speak with him in hopes of getting him up there as well. Cory is also around, working in Dryden and in Thunder Bay, and I'm going to talk to Dolphin in B.C. to see if he would be interested, and possibly both Richard and Chris Grundy in Winnipeg. If it all actually came together, it should be a good reunion when you are around. We'll be camping out on an island, but I'm sure we'll stop in at SWWL for a visit."

Oh ya, and you might remember that same year two days previous to Keith's 31"" I saw you at Lodge lookout point in the morning, i had another group and was reeling in a nice 30"" just as we passed your boat. You called out how big and I answered quite honestly...""Big"". Later that day I put the lady in my boat on a 30"" as well, this time from your favorite point that i won't mention. So that was 2 30's"" and a 31"" in the span of 3 days...that is unheard of around the Wheel. Knowing that you appreciate the stats I thought i would jog your memory. Always on top of em!! AV"
548362,Guest,2005-05-25 14:40:00,0,"As you can see, even the guy who previously REPEATEDLY stated his hate for computers and technology, has figured out how to post on here!! Scary isn't it?? For those who know, Griff is doing well. With an inability to work, he and Rebecca have been travelling as much as possible. This week he is in Fort McMurray, in northern Alberta, where he lived until about age 10 visiting friends. He may spend a month at a center in Ottawa for people with similar head injuries, to both recover and gain a better understanding of his injuries and how it affects thinking, initiation, etc. The differences are really quite minor, especially now after some time has passed, and those who did not know him very well beforehand, would likely not notice any differences at all. Griff is still Griff, a happy, fun-loving guy, and my best friend!! At times I think he gets frustrated because he feels great, like he could do anything, but he and those around him understand this is a process to work through on the road to recovery, and the ultimate concern is his long-term health. So again, Griff is doing very well, but they don't want to push his recovery too fast. Jigger1, you should ask ""AV"" what his priorities are. I know in terms of fishing, the greatest demise for an angler in northwestern Ontario would be to move to Southern Ontario, particularly during summer. It's like committing suicide to a devoted walleye angler. Does this bring into question AV's devotion?? I guess it does, and even he can't deny it!! I can only press so much on an individual's priorities, but anyone who knows AV in the manner in which you do Jigger1, I think would question him in a similar fashion. So don't let those numbers remind you of some hard-core fishing guru from Canada. He is, in fact, quite soft!! NWO Fishing Bum"
547550,Guest,2005-05-03 10:08:00,0,"Archie, What part of the lake do you fish? We hardly ever catch a smallie. I would like to catch a few more, although I dont know a lot about fishing them. We started fishing the south central part of the lake in 87 and the fishing has changed a lot. The way my feeble mind works, if the walleyes are eating the little pike, that would mean less pike and they should be getting bigger. I would characterize our big pike efforts of late as staying similar, not gaining or losing. I, too, love Lac Seul. I have fished the other big name lakes and Lac Seul is the all around champ in my book. I just wish we could latch onto a few bigger pike once in awhile. What time of year are you fishing when you catch the big ol' girls? We will be up there June 4-8 this year."
547551,Guest,2005-05-03 10:34:00,0,"We fish at Lac Seul Lodge's Black Bay Outpost in June and the Pike fishing is slow because it is too early for the weed cover. However we do get a few off of timber but the bigger ones are in the the 34"" to 38"" class. Our June trip we focus on Walleye and the Smallmouth have become a bonus fish. In July we fish the NE section of the lake and with the cover in better shape the Pike are easier to find and the Walleye and Smallmouth are plentiful in that section in July. Smallmouth fishing is best in rocky, shady areas and windy points and we use small spinner baits, tubes and Suspending Husky Jerks at both locations. Catch a fair amount of Smallmouth jigging for Walleye with minnows and/or twister tails. I still think the walleye are eating a lot of small Pike and reducing the species. I also think that a lot of big Pike have been removed by fisherman in the past and or die because of mis handeling after being caught. I would imagine it takes 20 to 25 years to grow a Trophy Pike just like it does for a Trophy Walleye. I really believe the Walleye is the dominant fish at Lac Seul in numbers now. It wasnt like that years back before the slot. Would love to hear from some of the Lac Seul Resorts owners and Guides about the Pike and its size demise."
547555,Guest,2005-05-03 11:54:00,0,"We drove by that cabin last year while fishing. Ironically, after all those years on the lake, we touched our first rock in the bay behind the cabin. We went through the narrows into that little bay with the high cliffs and on our way out, just before going through that narrow part again we whacked it. Broke the skag off, but didnt hurt anything else thankfully. I kinda liked that general area and we might explore just to the east of there a little more this year. when in june will you be up there?"

547511,Guest,2005-05-02 14:58:00,0,"So I have a question. Based on my personal experience and the numbers so diligently kept at SWW, pike over 40"" are pretty rare on Lac Seul. Why? They dont get a lot of pressure considering the area of the lake. Other lakes in the region I believe outproduce Lac Seul in terms of angler hours needed to catch that 40""+. Fish over 42"" are just about nonexistent. Why is that?"
547519,Guest,2005-05-02 17:11:00,0,"I also have the same question. I've fished the English River downstream of Lac Seul and it is common to catch a half dozen pike over 40"" in a week. Lac Suel is essentially the same water, so what is happening ? Anyone have a good guess on this ?"
