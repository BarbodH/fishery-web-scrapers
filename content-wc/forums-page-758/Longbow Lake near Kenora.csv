545606,MN_Moose,2005-02-06 18:35:00,965,Looking for experience on Longbow lake near Kenora ON. Did you fish much on Longbow lake or spend most time on LOW? Is there heavy fishing pressure on Longbow? Able to catch variety of fish on Longbow?
545609,Guest,2005-02-06 19:54:00,0,A group of 10-12 of us have been going to Longbow for 8 years. We usually go the second week of June. We start out in the morning fishing Longbow for 2 or 3 hours then we take the conveyer boat ramp over to LOW for the rest of the day. We catch most of our large Walleye and Northern on Longbow but the numbers come from LOW. The lake is nice with a lot of homes on the north side but very few people fishing the lake. Take care
545669,Guest,2005-02-08 19:32:00,0,"I live on Longbow year round, fishing is fantastic. Most people are obsessed with LOTW so I pretty much have the lake to myself all year. I have the only shack on the the lake and that has been for the last 3 years. We just caught and released a 41 inch northern last week and that is not the biggest yet. D"

548274,tjsker,2005-05-24 07:50:00,301,Mark I've never ventured into LOW before but I keep telling myself I'm going to get out of Longbow and try it. Do you fish just the area outside the lift? Do you stay all day and take a lunch with you? Do you live bait rig or use other methods for walleyes?
