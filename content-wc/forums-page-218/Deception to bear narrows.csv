4957945,prov1800,2016-06-30 06:19:00,5010,If you have a navioncs chip the safe route is on there.
4958225,fisher_i_am,2016-06-30 08:06:00,498,I do....but looks dicey around banana island and Dewey narrows...I see other posts where people say the stay east of those areas. How good is navionics around the rags..Looks like we'll just make our own ....not a big deal.
4958721,prov1800,2016-06-30 10:53:00,5010,It will take you around the island.havnt been there yet this year.heard the rags are good.if things look shaky slow down and check it out .

I have navigated in my personal boat all the way to where the Wapesi River enters the lake. Regardless of low water conditions, I always took the route on the west side of Banana Island. It looks pretty narrow upon approach, but there is plenty of room and depth there. The HB outfitter never had a concern in this spot on low water years. At Dewey Narrows , I would always take a northernly route to the east of the green and red buoys which would pass Taylor Island on the eastern side. From there it was due north to the red buoys that marked the entrance to Bear Narrows. This stretch is a little more tricky, but the big hazards are marked pretty well. I have looked at the Navionics route vs. my HB route maps and it flanges up pretty well. The only routes we couldn't take in low water years were through the Short Cut and The Rags. Those low water years were significant with levels being 3-6 ' below normal. If you are interested, send me a PM with your email address and I can send you maps with the routes I've used for many years. You could compare them to Navionics and see what you think based on current lake levels. PjShorthorn"

5034185,rnnonmt,2016-08-02 08:35:00,992,Fisher - Deception to bear narrows isn't bad. Don't psych yourself out. If you are an experienced boater/navigator and keep your situational awareness up (meaning don't have your eyes glued to the moving map) you will do fine.... And there is no problem with slowing down to check out suspicious looking breaks/chop in the water. Another good idea is to travel with another boat in your group if possible. I have done Deception to Chamberlain in my fishing boat a few times and Hudson to Merrit and Wapesi in a houseboat 20+ times. Only one time I got hung up on a reef in the houseboat near Taylor on the SW side. We pushed too far heading back in the HB and it got dark on us pretty quick.
5035833,Skywagon,2016-08-03 05:24:00,1106,"pjshorthorn's advice is good, trust your Navionics map. I have been up there a couple of times this summer (including last week), the rags are fine to go through, just take it easy, stay on the west side of Banana island like was mentioned, the buoys past Banana island are all in place, pay attention to them and all will be well from there on."
