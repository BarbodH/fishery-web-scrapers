5043626,Bigredmf,2016-08-06 13:59:00,129,It's been a few years (maybe 7-10) since we stayed with Guy on DodaHopefully they upgraded as the motors were extremely old and the one cabin they were renting had a large hole in the floorI know Guy is not flying anymore is he really still outfitting?RedSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
