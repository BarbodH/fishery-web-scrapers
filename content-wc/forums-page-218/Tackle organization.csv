I always have a section of one of those as a tool section (hooks, etc). myabe reels in top section unless flying commercial planes. Or a simple one compartment bag, like cabelas has the holds 3-5 of the clear containers and a seperate grocery cloth type bag for plastis talis and tools. If i am flying commercial craft I pack inside a heavy cardboard box like for shipping and it becomes a check-in piece."
5039914,Guest,2016-08-04 19:21:00,0,"I have used a soft bag with five hard plastic storage boxes inside. Also has pocket on three sides for tools, bug spray and sun block. Store jigs and hard baits in the boxes. I went a step further, went to Walmart and purchased a soft plastic lunch box. This I use for my soft plastic (Gulp), of course by the end of the trip this bag is almost empty. The lid has a pocket , which I store leaders. My two cents."
5033929,altemus_prime,2016-08-02 07:12:00,37,"Just curious what others use on drive-in or boat-in trips. I've always gone with a two tackle box system. One box keeps hard baits, spoons, spinners/spinner baits. The other box contains hooks, jig heads, harnesses, wire leaders, etc. I've been eyeballing a large soft tackle bag from cabelas that uses individual boxes to organize tackle. I feel that I could be even more organized (I'm very OCD) while only having to bring one tackle box and have less boat clutter. What does everyone else use? Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5034033,Baseline,2016-08-02 07:51:00,3207,"I have the Cabelas soft bag with with the vertical plastic box storage. Label the boxes on the end so you know what is in each. I would recommend not getting the extra large bag, but go with two large. The two smaller bags are much more manageable then dragging one heavy bag around. Be sure to label each box on the end so you know what's in it."
5034065,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-02 07:58:00,8293,Get one of those wheelie suitcases like you see at the airports. You can never have to much tackle!!!
5034377,altemus_prime,2016-08-02 09:35:00,37,That's what I was thinking. Two smaller ones would stow away a lot easier than the giant one. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk

5034545,BornToFish,2016-08-02 11:12:00,1224,"Greetings, I've been using a milk crate for many years as my tackle box. I mounted a grey plastic ""holster"" for marker buoys on the inside of the crate to hold my marker buoys when not in use. I also mounted a piece of swimmer's noodle along a top edge of the milk crate to hold my lures when not in use. The remainder of the inside of the crate holds various Plano boxes and other accessories (e.g. bug spray, sun screen, pliers, fillet knife). I use a dry bag to hold the various things (e.g. fishing towel, toilet paper) that should not get wet. I swap the Plano boxes into and out of the crate as is needed throughout the week. This system works very well for me as its cheap, and keeps everything dry and organized. Water from rain and waves just flows out the bottom of the crate. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5035009,Shellback,2016-08-02 16:49:00,8083,"I've got the Cabelas Magnum bag. I considered using 2 smaller ones, but decided it would be more clutter on the deck. It holds 8 of the big boxes, 4 smaller ones in outside pockets, then it has other pouches on the outside. Lots of room for plastic baits in the soft lid pocket. It holds everything except my lead, BB's and snap weights etc."
5035017,WallyWarrior,2016-08-02 16:56:00,2488,"I also have this bag and I have it stuffed. It is one heavy SOB and sucks to move it, but it does carry anything you would ever need and holds up extremely well. I can't tell you how many boxes I have stuffed in it, but I use a few of the deep boxes down the middle to keep weights and bottom bouncers in. After you fill it across the middle you can fit 4 more regular 3700s sideways in the main compartment. If you do this you can only zip it around one corner and across the front, but there is no need for any more than that, unless you fish in rain a lot. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5035433,altemus_prime,2016-08-02 20:33:00,37,"I think I've decided to go with two medium sized bags. I've always been used to a two box system, so two bags, with individual boxes organized and labeled will probably work well for me. I think two bags will stow in smaller spaces too. Thanks for all of the input. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
