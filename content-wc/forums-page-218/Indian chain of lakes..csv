Lots of musky and walleye and a good number of small mouth.Muskies can be found in weeds, rocks, wood, and open water. Same with walleyes, they were about everywhere you would expect to find them. And we caught them on minnows, leeches and crawlers using jigs, lindy rigs, spinner rigs, and bobbers. We also caught them on jigs and plastic, and crank baits both cast and trolled. This time of year expect the walleye to be 8' to 30+'. At low light and dark they will move up shallower.Sorry I didn't narrow id down better, but we caught fish on about everything we tried at one time or another. Keep trying different things and places until you find them.If you have any more specific questions please ask."
