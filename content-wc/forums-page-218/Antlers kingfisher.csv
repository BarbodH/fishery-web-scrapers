5031377,altemus_prime,2016-07-31 20:33:00,37,Does anyone have any experience fishing the Ottawa river in the Deux Rivieres area? Looking at antlers kingfisher . I've fisher lower on the Ottawa but was looking to head upriver because I've heard here are more walleye. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk
5031857,mickr,2016-08-01 07:32:00,74,I have never fished there however I assume it is pretty good. I find it relatively expensive compared to others offering similar accommodations / boat rentals. I have fished out of morning mist resort on a few occasions and the fishing in that stretch of river is good. I have never fished it in the dead of summer but for early or late season it is good.

I want to be able to have some walleye shore lunches and take some filets home. What techniques were most productive?Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5032193,mickr,2016-08-01 10:50:00,74,"there is a lot of rock in the river up there, not a lot of weed. You need to find drop offs and good points. The walleye will stack on them. You can do well on flats trolling worm harnesses. Actually, I use harnesses to zero in on depth then jig. jigs with minnows, worms or leetches work well. Find a bit of current, some rocks and shelfs and you'll find fish. I have never targeted pike but have landed them pushing 10 pounds. Between my buds and I we've run in to a few very large fish that we never got to see....fishing walleye with jigs you tend to run in to the odd biteoff. I really don't know what to tell you about Antlers lodge. I've driven by it, never stopped in. The river should be just as productive there as it is where I've been. You aren't running in to more civilization and therefore pressure running an extra 30 miles up the highway."

Looks like a 4 hour trip, and I could try the river for a couple days. I'd like to find a place for a week or so next July. About an 11 hour drive from my home in S.E. PA. I can freeload a nights stay with friends in Gananoque to break the trip up."
