5040450,The tank,2016-08-05 02:04:00,340,If it's been 19 years and nothing else on your record I wouldn't worry about it. I just wouldnt enter at ft frances.
5040506,camwhite,2016-08-05 04:42:00,3,We consider it a felony. You should worry about it.
5040922,celticshrt,2016-08-05 08:52:00,8,"Thanks to everyone that posted any info, i did find this on the canada thread this is extremely helpful and informative. I have read lots of views on this subject on Walleye central, Some people are understanding to this and some not so much, Who am i to judge how you should feel about this??? I am not perfect and have not met anyone that is. I am willing to bet everyone has something in their past that they regret, regardless if it is criminal or moral we are human. I was a little wild growing up and made some poor choices,that was then. i do not live in the past, sometimes my past is my greatest asset because i have learned from it. Jim We at NOTO have been providing information to people who are interested in coming to Canada, but are uncertain what they will encounter at the border, because they have a committed a minor offence. We have produced this video and there are a few other links that you can share on this forum that will go a long way in fostering a better understanding of the process. If someone is still uncertain they can still call us anytime tool free: 1800-665-5787 Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqQIqKbV8H4 Website:http://noto.ca/bordercrossing"
5041122,The tank,2016-08-05 09:43:00,340,That's a good post. That's pretty much what the agent inside the building at ft Frances told me when he pulled me in.

4975849,nancy39,2016-07-08 20:43:00,23,Heard you guys caught a big eye in vincent was it on that hard to find sunken hump?
4975865,MassillonBuckeye,2016-07-08 20:46:00,661,This thread has serious potential! 900 eyes. Amazing! How long were you there? Sounds like a heck of a time
4975961,nancy39,2016-07-08 23:09:00,23,We were in there 8 days .along way from phoenix for just 5 day trip.were not honey hole babysitters.4or 5 fish move on first time at that lake system wanted to fish it all 55 walleye help with spots
4977249,55walleyes,2016-07-09 18:27:00,131,The 28 inch walleye was caught south of the cabin in yam lake. Walleye fishing was outstanding. We had seven in our group finished 5 1/2 days 18 inch 19 inch 20 inch and even 21 inch walleyes were very very abundant. Vern is working hard at updating the cabin and the facility. the food package provided was great I booked for next year same dates. I was surprised that we did not come across any big northerns probably biggest northern within the 5 to 6 pound range we did have one big one follow and another big one actually hit a walleye as it came in but nothing was boated. It should be noted that we never really targeted the northern either pretty much strictly walleye fished
4977353,nancy39,2016-07-09 19:34:00,23,"We fished all 7 lakes even minkota, went into Lawson about 3miles to where those rapids come in.no big northerns but probably fished about 15 minutes for them. Those 15hp motors fly on those boats.verne and ryan are a great team I have done 24 trips with himm"
4977689,forgop,2016-07-09 23:46:00,880,Good to hear. Hitting the road in 9 days for Maskara Lake July 21-29. Hope they're hitting for me as well as they have for your groups. Can't wait to hit a portage lake that from the sounds of it hasn't had a boat on it in 20+ years.
5038866,celticshrt,2016-08-04 11:35:00,8,"55Walleys & Nancy39 and everyone else that posted on this thread thanks!!! i like Slate Falls outpost!!!! seems like top notch place, with nice owners. i have not been to canada since 1999 and all my trips were to Quebec 95% fly-ins i learned after the first trip if you can drive to it don't go.... i am working on resurrecting the old crew and am not sure how many of them will be able or want to go, can anyone tell me what the min persons required for the camps you fished? also anyone have any idea who to contact about the DUI stuff and crossing the boarder? it has been 19 years since and i don't think it would be an issue but i sure don't want it delaying my trip. thanks Jim"
5038890,55walleyes,2016-08-04 11:47:00,131,Contact Verne at Slate Falls about minimum number. I do not know about DUI.
