5038970,stevensinks,2016-08-04 12:11:00,330,We got home Sunday. had a great week. Worms on floating spinner rigs worked best for us. We had a little trouble finding 16-17 inchers to eat. It seemed that almost every thing we found were 13-14 or over 20. Our largest pike decided to let go of my walleye after we missed him once with the dip net. We got to see the Northern lights one night. Some friends that like to fish off of the dock before breakfast got 52 walleye one morning. fourt2 we never made it past the narrows so we didn't get back your way. Your boat deal didn't sound good. We had a great time and are booked for next year.
4993537,stevensinks,2016-07-16 07:11:00,330,Anyone been up to Red Lake? We are leaving Friday and I was wondering how the fishing has been.
4994265,Stringbean,2016-07-16 14:54:00,279,"A group of 5 of us fished in Ontario the last week of June. The only slow day was Sunday after that cold front went through. We may have to brush up on tactics to use after frontal passage. The rest of the week was above average for us. The eater size walleyes were at 19 feet on top of underwater humps and the bigger fish were down on the sides around 22-23 feet. I started the week using spinning rigs which worked very well, but by Tuesday I switched over to a jig and minnow and did better. I won't need a fish fry for the next 6 months."
4996993,LoDo,2016-07-17 19:51:00,721,"Fishing Donald Lake in Caribou National Prov Park Aug 18 to 26. Pretty excited! This will be our 8th year at this camp. Nice sized lake with several islands and small adventure creeks, inlets and outlets. Of the 8 years we've fished the opener, second week of June a few times, hot July and mid to late Aug. What I've learned is walleye get deep as the water temps rise. Donald and Red are both at 51*. Id bet the fishing is very similar. I always read Red Lake reports to help with Donald. Donald is a fly-in and private. My advice to fishing Red Lake is small walleyes will still be shallow, 8-15'. If you want to find larger walleyes and northerns for that matter you'll be looking for humps/shelves where depths go from deep to 25-32'. We pull up walleyes from 30' all day in Donald Lake when you get to the later part of the summer. A good way to find them is covering water pulling deep rapalas in 25'+. Once located start jigging. This isn't a new technique by any means, but is absolutely affective. Have fun!!"
5004345,fourt2,2016-07-20 11:13:00,45,Also heading to Red Lake on Friday (Black Bear). Camp blog posts seem to indicate good numbers of walleye and some nice pike. -42
5007393,AllenW,2016-07-21 08:53:00,11482,"Jig and a minnow or plastic works well and lets you cover an area fairly quick, best luck was with either a minnow or a smelt looking plastic. Find decent structure going shallow to deep and work back and forth till you find the size of fish you want. Red gets slow or too windy try the Chukuni river as it heads towards Gullrock, look for holes or deeper water. Also Gullrock was one of our favorite spots to hit. Run upstream to the rapids on the Chukuni to the rapids, busy place on the weekends, but get there early on a weekday and it should be a must hit spot for ya. Try McKenzie island, might pick up a trout there too. Big lake, take an area that looks good and cover it well, you can easily spend to much time running and gunning imho. Al"
5007481,stevensinks,2016-07-21 09:16:00,330,fourt2 We will be at the same end. We are going to Bow narrows. I just finished packing the truck so we can get a early start. I have been checking Dan's blog as well as Black bears blog. Sounds good. I cant wait to get there. Thanks everyone for the info.
5012009,martinbns,2016-07-22 15:20:00,1520,"My wife and I are headed up Sunday to five Lakes Lodge, was just talking to the owner today. He says, minnow and a jig."
5012193,Habitual Eyer,2016-07-22 16:27:00,144,we are heading up to Wrights week after next. Thought about sneaking up to Red one day and dropping the riggers for lake trout in some of the deeper water. Anyone have any thoughts on that??
5013369,LoDo,2016-07-23 06:07:00,721,A guy on the Boo's thread said he was catching nice lakers in 90' of water. He was fishing them at 60'. I'm guessing thats your move. Trout lake and Red Lake are awfully close to one another and about the same latitude. I'll be doing the same on Donald Lake.
5036785,fourt2,2016-08-03 11:37:00,45,"Worms worked better than minnows for us. Very healthy fish, in all sizes. Biggest walleye for us was 25"". Biggest pike was 44"". Good trip in spite of nearly sinking my poor boat (got about an 8"" split in the bow keel--no, didn't hit anything...other than some nasty waves). Got her home, now just have to figure out what to do...-42"
