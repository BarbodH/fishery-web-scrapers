5033201,Obabikon,2016-08-01 18:54:00,2370,lol... I was informed that I should keep paddles on my 27 foot sportcraft. I laughed and asked if he really thought I was strong enough to paddle that thing. But... there are two under the bench.

5042986,Kartman35,2016-08-06 07:59:00,245,Don't forget the fire extinguisher!!
5043586,saikk,2016-08-06 13:35:00,14,"http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/...ty/TP-511e.pdf I searched safe boating guide and found this on the Transport Canada website. Pages 17-19 summarize what you need, page 57 talks about Foriegn boats needing to follow requirements from their country."
5026841,Pauleye78,2016-07-28 21:04:00,57,I'm traveling to LOTW and going into Canadian waters. The regs I read states I need a throw buoy and flares. My boat is 21 ft. Am I correct? Thanks!!
5026857,BRP,2016-07-28 21:22:00,77,Yes flares if between 6 and 8 meters and in a body of water where you could be more than a mile off shore. Otherwise just a flashlight. I would hazard a guess that most people on lotw don't carry flares though.
5027057,Shellback,2016-07-29 05:57:00,8083,"To the best of my knowledge, a US registered boat only needs to meet the US requirements. If you have the proper equipment for where your boat is registered, you should be good to go."
5027097,That Minnesota guy,2016-07-29 06:10:00,8293,"We took 50' of floating rope, a whistle and something else I can't remember right now."
5027177,JDP,2016-07-29 07:10:00,1457,That is my understanding as well.
5027769,Ricky Spanish,2016-07-29 10:25:00,1298,"x3 I had a new boat a few months back and it was not registered when we went up to Eagle Lake. The regs stated that I was required to follow the laws where the boat is registered, so I just had to carry my registration application. They do seem like handy items to have on a remote or large lake. I think I will add them to my rig's toolbox."
5032305,lawson2343,2016-08-01 11:25:00,459,A bucket for bailing?
5032409,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-01 12:11:00,8293,"No, not a bucket, it was a paddle. In case you lost power they wanted a paddle in the boat I guess."
5032433,lawson2343,2016-08-01 12:33:00,459,I think they want you to have a bailing bucket on board as well.
5032497,oleJoe,2016-08-01 13:20:00,114,"We were told a bailing can or bucket,50 ft floating rope a flashlight and a whistle. I think they wanted one without a ball in it. I think I will use coffee cans this year and be done with it. We always break one of the bailers every year."
