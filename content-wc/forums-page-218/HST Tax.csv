5038282,Stein67,2016-08-04 06:49:00,19,"In 22 years of Canada trips I've never submitted for refund. Seems like a hassle for a few bucks. Of course I'm also the guy that never sends in manufacturer's rebates, either."
5038362,Bill Krejca,2016-08-04 07:42:00,6107,"One camp says that the CAMP BROCHURE must specify the extra service (s) provided, also on the invoice, if not, tax will not be provided. So we don't get a refund. Bill"
5038370,tv4fish,2016-08-04 07:45:00,2694,"Just got my check (oops - cheque) I applied for 50% ($83.00) received cheque for $103.00 ---Darn -- it was in ""Canadian""............ I agree - IF your lodge. etc. does NOT make your invoice so you CAN qualify - They ARE lazy..........."
5038410,Shellback,2016-08-04 08:10:00,8083,"Sounds like he either didn't want to be bothered with it, or just didn't know the rules. Maybe a call back to show him providing meals qualifies."
5038482,v-bay gord,2016-08-04 08:41:00,3168,"This has been discussed many times and the idea that the operator should be able to rebate it on the spot is theoretically true but for several reasons I will not do it. To make it work I would need to charge a minimum 20% deposit (a requirement under the program) which is a major change from my present requirement. Secondly the process now becomes a private arrangement between me and my guest, but I am still required to collect, submit and substantiate all aspects of the process to the government......and I am financially responsible for it. If for some reason it is determined that my claim is rejected I am on the hook for the money.......perhaps a summer's worth of rebates. This is not something I am willing to risk, when the alternative of having the paperwork filled out for the guest, and submitting it for them is so much simpler. Every lodge should be able to at least come up with an invoice that is adequate for their guests to receive a rebate. Choosing where you fish based on who will rebate on the spot is an interesting, if somewhat limiting approach."
5038506,BornToFish,2016-08-04 08:53:00,1224,"Gord, Your position seems entirely reasonable to me. I've had other lodge owners explain their reluctance to handle HST rebates in the same way. It seems as though once a government obtains someone's money, they are reluctant to part with it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5039138,bigwalleye1,2016-08-04 13:45:00,2632,I would respectfully submit that our government and the Canadian government are not as dis-similar as we might have previously thought.....
5039594,forgop,2016-08-04 16:53:00,880,"I didn't choose them based upon them giving me the rebate at the time of my trip. It was just something they offer and if you're an outfitter that's been doing this for decades and like you said, if you can't create an invoice that doesn't get reimbursed, I guess that's on you, right?

5040546,Bstar,2016-08-05 05:14:00,564,We flew in to Esnagami Wilderness Lodge in 2013 and they gave us an invoice that listed all services provided as well as the HST rebate form and told us how to fill it out. Went to Fisherman's Cove last year (drive in) and they didn't want anything to do with the rebate. We're flying in with Slate Falls Outposts next year and they will give you the rebate at the time of payment as long as you have at a 20% deposit in ahead of time which we will. I guess it depends on the amount of customer service that the camp owner wants to provide.
5037482,deerriver,2016-08-03 17:55:00,9,"Went to Canada last week, stayed at a nice camp. Cabin, evening meal,boat&motor. 2 guys 139.00 HST each. Resort owner said we do not get any refund (50%) because he doesn't furnish guide service.Does anyone know if this is fact ? Thanks in advance."
5037506,Obabikon,2016-08-03 17:59:00,2370,"You have to provide several services. Guide, maid service, cooking, fish cleaning, transportation... etc. Guide service is a big one, but not always a deal breaker. Did he clean your fish or cook for you? Was it a boat or fly-in?"
5037650,phishfearme,2016-08-03 19:06:00,1242,the KEY is what he writes on the receipt - to get the refund the receipt must show a second service (one is guiding but others count). if he only provides lodging that won't make it. phish
5037674,Pooch,2016-08-03 19:25:00,4619,"Our last trip (one week ago) ways this on the bottom of the invoice:""Our tour packages include accommodations in our cabins, boat, motor, gas, bait and transportation in our unique Haggland Haul.""That trip is the only one of three each year that we get half of our HST back. The others are drive to camps with our own boats. We are just renting a cabin at them so nothing is subject to the refund.Wording is everything on the invoice.Pooch"
5037818,v-bay gord,2016-08-03 20:22:00,3168,My thoughts are that any lodge that can't come up with an eligible service to get you the HST rebate is just plain lazy.
5037938,deerriver,2016-08-03 21:06:00,9,The owner and his wife cooked supper every night.
5038074,BornToFish,2016-08-04 05:24:00,1224,"Greetings, I completely agree with the comments above. It's all about how the lodge owner writes his invoice. Eligibility for the rebate for the HST is in part determined by the ""eligible services"" provided by the lodge owner. A lodge that I fish at includes dockside boat/safety training and mid-week linen exchange as eligible services. If you feel that eligible services were provided, it might be worthwhile contacting the lodge owner and have him/her issue you a new invoice with appropriate language included. V-Bay Gord said something above about the instant lodge owner that sort of stuck with me. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5038138,forgop,2016-08-04 05:49:00,880,Be like me and use an outfitter that will refund you the HST directly so you dont even have to send it in any more. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk
5038194,Thompmd,2016-08-04 06:12:00,320,"If there is HST rebate involved, does it require extra effort or cost on the part of the resort?"
5038202,port1042,2016-08-04 06:14:00,509,"I got my refund for our spring trip a week ago. Filing and submitting the paperwork is not a problem. Our invoice simply states: ""Housekeeping plan with boat training session and fish cleaning service. Upgrade boat package."" It works every time! Our group will head back in 4 weeks and we will stop at a bank in Fort Frances to cash the check which avoids all fees. That will give us plenty of Canadian Dollars for breakfast, bait, and a couple cases of beer before we head further north. I'm not sure how it works with the lodge offering the refund directly. While the rebate is 50% it never seems to work out to exactly that. This spring I requested $140.00 and got $129.00. The adjustment description is pretty cryptic. I'm not complaining!"
