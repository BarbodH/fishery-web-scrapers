560870,Frankm,2006-09-05 15:01:00,154,We've been staying at the Super 8 the last couple years. It's quiet and the lot is well lit. We are considering staying at the Emo Inn next year. It looks like a decent place when we drove by and on their website. I was just looking for opinion from some of you who may have stayed there. Is it clean and quiet? Also is the parking lot well lit? Thanks.

560896,Frankm,2006-09-06 09:01:00,154,Thanks for the replies. I will definately give it a try next year. I forgot all about the OPP that is right there.
