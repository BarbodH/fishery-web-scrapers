560887,Trailerguy,2006-09-05 19:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just returned from NWO via I-35, hwy 33 and Hwy 53. I gotta say fuel prices were a joke. The Conoco south of Int. Falls was $2.56 unleaded and $3.39 for diesel, that's an 83 cent spread. They were the highest price I saw, diesel was 10 cents cheaper in town before you crossed the border even. I filled at Murphys in Cloquet for $2.99 (the advantage of a 35 gal tank), the prices just keep going up as you go north of Cloquet. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
560900,Guest,2006-09-06 10:35:00,0,Bet you still had a great time fishing.....The fuel cost is only a bug on the windsheild of life when it comes to going to Canada fishing. So how did you do fishing ?????
560906,Guest,2006-09-06 11:37:00,0,"Isn't it funny that the price jumped up when the leak was announced. then dropped when it was reported that BP had been skimping on the anticorrosion chemical that is added to the oil. And now they say the leak is not as bad as originally reported. This all smells a little to me, it looks like price setting, and oil companies using the media to get prices up, then have to back down when some one steps up to the plate and reports on the oil company behavior."
560908,Lovetofish,2006-09-06 12:08:00,458,How was I-35 by Hinkley?

560949,Skylane,2006-09-08 06:53:00,101,"We came back the 6th and the cheapest gas we saw, all the way back to central Illinois, was in town at International Falls $2.52. Yes, diesel prices stink, with the fall farming season dead ahead, using several thousand gallons, it will hurt."
560957,Guest,2006-09-08 16:32:00,0,just as a general question from a know nothing........why would anyone buy a diesel vehicle? they are noisy. they stink. diesel fuel has been higher than gas for years. what's the advantage?
560959,Trailerguy,2006-09-08 16:55:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Well in my case I use the pickup mostly for traveling, personal preference I supose, you just can't beat the ride and room. As far as milage, I owned a R1500 (1/2 ton) with the gas 5.9 v-8, it repeatedly got 14mpg going downhill with a tailwind. I traded for a nearly identically equiped, same model year R2500 (3/4 ton) with a noisy, stinky, Cummins 5.9 turbo diesel that gets 20-24mpg at 75mph on the interstate, you do the math. Until recent months diesel has been within a dime or so of gas, sometimes higher sometimes lower. Besides that, when some idiot trys to pull some cute manuever you just spool up the turbo and let them choke on the soot! Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
560964,Guest,2006-09-08 18:27:00,0,nothing beats a stinky diesel for towing. My f250 crew cab gets 15-16 mpg at 72mph and you don't know the boat is there. my last 2 tow vehicles were an 1/2 ton silverado and a suburban. lucky to get 11 mpg and always downshifting an any small hill. price of diesel has been about the same the last 4 years until last week. eric
