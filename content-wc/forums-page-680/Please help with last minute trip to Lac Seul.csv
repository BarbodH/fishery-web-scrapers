560972,time to fish,2006-09-09 09:41:00,2,"We are tired of the ""so-so fishing"" and the ""you should have been here about 20 years ago, or at least yesterday"" at most places and have decided to make the long journey to Lac Seul or somewhere in that area. We can leave on Sept 15. We are looking for lodging - hopefully a cabin by itself. I am mildly handicapped and husband will help me fish. We would like something nice, but affordable in a drive-in or boat-in. Pets must be permitted since we will take our dog who is a good fisherman too. We will take our own boat. Also would like any suggestions on which regions in the lake to fish. Also would like any tips for mid-september fishing. And any tips for making this trip a success. Also, for you folks who make a long drive to fish this lake - is the fishing really that good? The reports are outstanding, but have never been there. thanks for the help."

If you need a ride to the boat dock, they have a golf cart for you to use. The rates for a cabin are very reasonable. Bill and Helen, the retired couple and Peter and Christa, their kids are more than willing to help you out. You can reach them at 807 222-3212. Last summer, while I was there, there was an elderly couple there and they fished every day. He was 86 and she was 83 or 84. And they're not going to a nursing home till they're good and ready."

THERE ARE DOCKS THAT DON'T HAVE STEPS THAT CAN ACCOMODATE WHEELCHAIRS. I THINK THE CABINS DO HAVE A STEP OR TWO THOUGH. HER TEL. NUMBER IS 807-222-3313. IT'S ON LAC SEUL WHICH MEANS YOU WILL CATCH FISH FOR SURE. OF COURSE WEATHER CAN NEVER BE PREDICTED. GOOD LUCK!"
