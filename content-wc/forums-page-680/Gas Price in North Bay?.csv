560843,Guest,2006-09-04 15:46:00,0,Unleaded gas was 1.19 per liter the first of August which works out to 4.66 give or take per gallon after you factor in the 9% greater value of the U.S. dollar. It is probably lower now but still well over 3.75 per gallon after the conversion math is done. They tax it hard to finance all the socialist programs up there.
