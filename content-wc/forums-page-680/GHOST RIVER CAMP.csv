560909,Lenman,2006-09-06 12:20:00,19,Friday was the best day last week! Rain with a little wind and anywhere you put your line you were on some fish! I also think that because the water was so low you noticed the other boats more because people weren't in the other lakes. This was my 3rd time up here and I'd recommend this camp to anyone. The Value vs. Quality of fish is up there with the best of them! :-)
560409,Guest,2006-08-17 08:48:00,0,I AM LEAVING FOR GHOST RIVER CAMP IN A WEEK AND WANT TO KNOW IF ANYONE HAS BEEN THERE LATELY AND HOW YOU DID.
560419,Skyraptor,2006-08-17 18:51:00,291,"Robby, was there the first week in August with 2 other adults and 4 kids and we had a great time. We were there for 5 days and each day we found fish pretty easy. The water is low this year, down about 2-3 feet from any other year. So if you go through the rock tunnel you have to pull your boat through with a rope that have there. Most of our larger fish we found by fishing off of sunken islands with deep water nearby. A fish locator is a must to make sure you fish the drop-offs. There are many lakes that you can go to from the main lake but we mostly stayed on Marchington and did well. The walleyes were of good size 16""-23"" range and the northerns ran on the small side because of the low water and warm water the bigger ones must of been deeper then what we were fishing. We used minnows(available at the camp), leeches and artifical bait. I would do without the leeches and use minnows only when needed but the best bait was a Lindy spinner tipped by a Berkley gulp 3"" twister tail. Camp was clean, friendly and well run. They were very helpful and honoring any request that you had. Any other questions feel free to email me: [email protected]"

560523,Skyraptor,2006-08-21 18:12:00,291,"On the Lindy Rigs the best colors were the hot pink, yellow, orange and the red/white blades. For the Berkley Gulps in the 3"" twister tail, the colors that I found to be best were pink and white. Wish I had more time to try other colors but when the fish are hitting it is hard to switch and see if another color works. Good luck and give us a report when you get back. If you plan on taking any fish home make sure you bring clear fish wrap to wrap your fish in as the lodge does not provide that."

Weather was hot and not a cloud in the sky 80-85 each day. Thursday fish started to come on got several Walleye in the 16"" to 23"" range on Thursday. My son caught and released a 40"" Northern on 6 pound test on Thursday. Had a good time going back next year same time."

560848,Guest,2006-09-04 20:31:00,0,"Robby, sounds like you had a fun trip regardless of high skies and hot weather. If I may ask, what is it about the camp that makes you want to go back? I am looking for a lodge and lake system that produces fish and some big fish too."
560857,Guest,2006-09-05 09:26:00,0,"MARCHINGTON LAKE IS HUGE ABOUT 25 MILES LONG WITH MANY BAYS INCOMING WATERFFALLS OUTGOING FALLS. YOU ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO MANY OTHER LAKES. THE POTENTIAL TO CATCH A BIG WALLEYE IS THERE ALSO BIG NORTHERN. PEOPLE WERE NICE. NOT AS REMOTE AS I AM USED TO. I HAVE BEEN ON FLY-IN TRIPS THE LAST 16 YEARS SO I AM SPOILED IN THAT REGARD BUT, THE FISH WE HAVE CAUGHT ON FLY-INS ARE NOT ALL THAT BIG I HAVE NEVER CAUGHT A WALLEYE OVER 26"" IN 16 YEARS. I THINK MARCHINGTON HAS GREAT POTENTIAL."
560868,reconssd,2006-09-05 14:11:00,147,I have been on fly-ins too and have been disappointed by quality and size of fish. Sounds like this is a body of water where you won't see many fishermen or have anyone crowd you in the prime areas. I have heard some other good things about this camp. Did you fish any of the other lakes?
560872,Guest,2006-09-05 15:31:00,0,"WE FISHED CLAMSHELL ONE DAY WITHOUT SUCCESS. YOU WILL HOWEVER, SEE OTHER FISHERMAN AND WORD GETS OUT WHERE THEY'RE BITING SO, IT IS NOT LIKE YOU ARE IN AN AREA BY YOURSELF. BUT THE LAKE IS SO BIG THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PLACES TO FISH. I THINK THEY HAD SOME PRIVATE CABINS ON MARCHINGTON LAKE AND THE CAMP HAD ABOUT TWENTY BOATS OUT AS WELL SO THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE AROUND FOR SURE. BUT, WE DID HAVE DAYS WHERE WE WOULD ONLY SEE A COUPLE OF OTHER BOATS."
