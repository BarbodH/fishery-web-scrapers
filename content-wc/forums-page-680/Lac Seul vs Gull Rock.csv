560915,kickback,2006-09-06 17:08:00,64,I'm going to book a 2 week walleye fishing trip for the summer of 2007 with my father.I was wondering how Gull Rock compared to Lac Seul as far as size and numbers of fish?We would like to go in the end of July or first part of August.My father is 84 years old.He took me to Canada walleye fishing 50 years ago.I'd really like to take him to a great lake.Thanks in advance.
560919,Guest,2006-09-06 18:41:00,0,"Admittedly, having never fished Gull Rock, I don't think it compares to Seul (even if you just went based on the reports from both fisheries posted on this site). Numerous people regard Lac Seul as one of the best walleye fisheries in the world, but it all depends on how you define ""the best."" NWO Fishing Bum"
560920,Guest,2006-09-06 19:16:00,0,My vote is you try Gull Rock and give us a report....
560925,2746,2006-09-06 20:34:00,3206,I've fished both and you can't go wrong with either lake. Gullrock is a smaller lake with good fishing within 15 minutes of any camp. Both numbers and size of walleye are good and likely comparable to Lac Seul. If I were taking my 84 year old father I'd do it at Gullrock. Having said that Lac Seul is as good a walleye fishing gets!

He always told me that he felt that both Lakes were great fishing but the edge had to go to Lac Seul because of nicer sized overall fish and he felt the fishing on Lac Seul was more consistant. Either Lake is a great choice according to him. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
560927,kickback,2006-09-06 23:00:00,64,Thanks guys.I just got back from my Dad's and we reserved a cabin on Lac Seul for the first 2 weeks of August.He said he really wants to go to Lac Seul.We have a cabin on the Van Hook Arm of Sakakawea and are real familar with rough water.Jigs and Bouncers and Spinners Oh Boy!!!!
