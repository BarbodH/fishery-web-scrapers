560835,Seanik,2006-09-04 09:47:00,218,"Our group of 6 was at Domain Poutrincourt July29 - Aug.6. We were on the American plan with meals. The fishing was great, conservative estimate was 400 walleyes and 35 Pike. We didn't fish hardcore, 8:00am until about 11:30 and maybe 2 hrs in the evening, give or take a couple of hours. The average size of Walleye was greater then I have previously seen for that part of Quebec. Very nice cabins, boats and motors and the food was outstanding. We will be goimg back."
560883,Guest,2006-09-05 18:48:00,0,Great glad you had a good time. I always did. Did you get a chance to go up the river you asked me about and how was going through the chutes (fast water neck) where it goes into the lac. Also I hope some of the info I had given you months back helped.
