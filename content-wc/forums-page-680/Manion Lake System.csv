We didn't get any big pike on Manion itself, but the next system of lakes we got onto from Manion did produce some nice fish. The biggest we got was a 45"". The fishing on Manion for walleyes was not worth the time. We needed to portage to Big and Little Moosetrack or onto the Mount Lake system to catch 'eyes. Good smallie fishing on Manion early and late in the day, but that's about it. Good luck. Are you staying at Hyatt's?"

But, I was talking with some guys at the local tackle shop and one of them had stayed at Hyatts. He almost echoed your sentiments exactly about Manion lake. Thanks again."

The fishing on Manion itself is not worth the trip to me however. If you like ""adventure"" and driving your boat long distances to explore new areas I'd say that Manion is fine. If you prefer to motor a few minutes and start catching 'eyes then it isn't the place for you. I'm sure there are some pig pike in Manion, but we didn't raise any."

I have talked with others that have fished the lake too, and some people have stated that there is way too much fishing pressure in the area. If I want fishing pressure, I can stay in Wisconsin. Thanks again for your input."
