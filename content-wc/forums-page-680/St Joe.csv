559373,lobo1,2006-07-13 13:03:00,734,"Thanks Ogoki but that place is the fly-in at Root Bay - which is the far SW end of the lake. I am referring to a new boat-in cabin approx 24-25 miles from the landing at Osnaburgh House.... might even be in it's first season. There was a sign that said ""call - Lake St Joe Adventures"" and gave a number but I can't remember or find any info on the place. Looked like a very nice new cabin with an outbuilding - had solar panels etc. Maybe someone knows the name or number to the store in Silver Dollar and I could call them and ask. thanks again Lobo1"
