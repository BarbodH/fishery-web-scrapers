560282,Guest,2006-08-13 18:11:00,0,"Oh Boy! Finally get to fish Tobin this fall. I have wanted to do this for years after all the wonderful things I have heard. Can you guys help me with some information? My wife and I will be there the last week of Sept. or first week of Oct. I was wondering what I need to cross the border USA to canada, where to stay, and a few fishing tips for catching some big fish. I am not interested in filling my freezer but would really love to catch a big one (12+lbs.). What type of crankbait works best? I pull alot of reef runners here in the Dakota's but have heard that Bombers are the thing for that area. I will be bringing my own boat so I will not need a rental. Any info will really be appreciated. THANKS!"
560287,Guest,2006-08-13 22:14:00,0,Might want to reconsider your dates. I think the vanity cup is that week.
560294,Guest,2006-08-14 11:10:00,0,Go earlier of a few weeks later. For an explanation... See my response on the General Discussion board.
