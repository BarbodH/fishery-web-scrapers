560772,Guest,2006-08-30 21:29:00,0,"Wrap filets in foil lemon butter, onion,green pepper, for 10 min. right at the end, put on your favorite salsa.We have a gas grill,walleye with anything is good."
560773,slugger,2006-08-30 22:02:00,4,"Take aluminum foil and put one layer of fillets. Lemon pepper fillets then add a layer of pre-cooked stovetop stuffing then another layer of fish. Lemon pepper fillets. Add 3 tablespoons of water. Put aluminum foil over top and seal the edges so the moisture does not escape. Cook for 30 minutes in oven or you can put on the grill on low. Add an extra quarter cup of water to stuffing and cook only long enough so the water is soaked in, which is about 10 seconds. We usually make up two aluminum packets so we use half of the stuffing to each. If you put on a wood coal fire you will need to add half a cup of water so the fish do not burn on bottom. Only 2 weeks to go and I will be enjoying this type of meal."
560785,Sutsgold,2006-08-31 13:50:00,219,I agree with phern. I have never had a bad walleye dinner or a bad tasting beer while in canada. Its amazing how crossing the border makes everything taste better.
560789,rpieske,2006-08-31 15:25:00,1276,"Walleye: Place filets in a baking dish and cover with Stove Top Stuffing (after it is mix with water). Bake at 325 degrees for approx 15-20 minutes. Uhm, uhm good. Lake Trout (or other fish): fill frying pan with water half way up. Drop in a couple packettes of London Crab Boil or Zatarain's Shrimp/Crab Boil. Poach the fish in the water. Poor man's lobster."
560793,Guest,2006-08-31 22:46:00,0,Fillet your walleye removing y-bones too but leave the skin on....place skin down on foil....brush on lemon juice...sprinkle on pepper.....coat with parmesan cheese.....sprinkle on crisp bcon pieces....place in bbq on high heat until done....eat while hot...YUMMY
560931,River_eye,2006-09-07 00:37:00,1486,"here's a method of cooking that I havn't tried, but a buddy told me about. put some white wine in a pan, then slice onions into thick rings, and place them across the bottom of the pans. then lay the filets across the top of the onion rings, so that the filets are not touching the wine. Coverwith foil and steam. Add whatever spices you want."
560953,Guest,2006-09-08 12:52:00,0,"Soak cedar, hickory or alder planks in water for 3-4 hours. Fire up the grill and warm to medium temperature. Fillet as usual. Lay fillets on the planks, leaving enough space between them for steam to escape. Season the fish with a variety of seasonings, making some simple (salt, pepper, dill, etc.) and some kicked up a bit (paprika, cumin, curry powder, chili powder, red pepper flakes, etc.). Top a few with something to compliment the seasonings (bread crumbs, lemon wheels, parmesan cheese, teriyaki, tabasco, etc.). Put the planks on the grill and close the cover to contain the smoke and steam (vent a little if necessary to keep the heat constant). Cook until the fillets are firm but flake easily with a fork. Serve with a simple cold side such as mustard potato salad, cole slaw or black bean & corn salsa."
560966,Heidi,2006-09-08 20:38:00,4,">I have heard of guys boiling their fillets like shrimp style >and then eating them some cocktail sauce just like shrimp >cocktail. Was wondering if anybody did this and how they did >it and if it did taste good? The secret is to bring the salt water to a boil, the add the walleye fillets then just let it simmer for about 3-5 minutes or until they flake apart, then dip it or drizzle with melted butter, eat like you would eat crab. Heidi"
560735,Guest,2006-08-29 21:28:00,0,"Hi, aside from the usual shore lunch type of preparation, what other ways do you fix your walleye and northern? Looking for something other than frying. My wife and I are heading up to Wasbaskang this Friday and looking forward to 2 weeks of fishing, good eats and relaxation."
560738,Guest,2006-08-29 22:43:00,0,"double up two sheets of aluminum foil. Roll up the sides & edges to make a tray. Put 5-6 pads of butter on the tray lay fillets in and season with lemon pepper. Put an the grill for 10 minutes, give or take depending on how hot the grill is. Enjoy!!"

560745,Guest,2006-08-30 09:59:00,0,"Chop the fish up in little pieces, mix with egg batter and cracker crumbs and chopped onions with salt and pepper to taste. Make patties out of the mixture and fry on low temp in oil and butter. Thus Walleye Patties...DELICIOUS Chunk Walleye into 1"" squares, mix with cooked noodles, spaghetti sauce, onion, green pepper and mozzerala cheese....bake in oven at 325 for 20 minutes.....Delicious"

560752,Guest,2006-08-30 11:47:00,0,"In the foil we place the fillets , onions, red, green peppers, or any veg. Wrap it up but instead of butter we use a white wine, plus whatever spice you like. On the bbq or fire."
560753,7thCrowWing,2006-08-30 12:25:00,132,6-8 fillets in baking dish. Mix 12 oz (enough to cover) sour cream and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and spead over fish. Bake until the fish is done (20-40 minutes) at 350 degrees.
560754,Guest,2006-08-30 12:37:00,0,I use a deep sided skillet to get a couple inches of salt water to a boil ( I would recommend sea salt rather than regular table salt). Drop chunked fish (northern or walleye work great) into the boiling water....usually by the time the water begins to boil a bit the fish are done....it doesn't take long. Put the fish on a platter and pour some melted butter over top. I usually season with pepper and a little fresh dill and parsley. With the salt water you probably can skip the salt. You will be surprised at how good and easy this is.
560758,Sutsgold,2006-08-30 14:20:00,219,Musky Mark has a great recipe. Along with how he suggested we put a dry breading on the fillets (Andys fish breading) along with an onion. Cook on each side for 10 minutes on the grill. It was one of the most enjoyable walleye meals we have ever had. Best of luck on Wabaskang.
