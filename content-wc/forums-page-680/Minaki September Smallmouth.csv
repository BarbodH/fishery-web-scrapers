In September we catch smaller ones mainly in the various rapids, though have not tried Rough Rock moving water. Any patterns for the bigger smallmouth in September anyone might share would be most appreciated. Don"

560839,Reels,2006-09-04 14:45:00,2876,"Hi Don, A couple of years ago I stayed at Rough Rock in September. We fished it hard for a while, but the fish were on the small side compared to making the ride to Big Sand. The best spot I found was on the top of the rock pile in about 12' right at the crown with slip bobbers. Other areas with simular structure worked too. <{{}}><"
560850,Guest,2006-09-04 20:59:00,0,"Hi Reels, Nice to hear from you again. Thanks for the pattern of 12 foot rock piles. Are you talking about a specific rock pile? Where are the rock piles located in general, and how was the size of the smallmouth on them? Thanks again, Don"

All the fish were deep 30 to 40 ft. used tube jigs for some really nice smallies at trappers and watch out cause the Muskies are active lots of chewed up fish being caught"
560865,Guest,2006-09-05 13:34:00,0,My advice would be to get out of the swift part of the river and fish Big Sand. You won't have any problem catching big smallmouth with tube jigs and Senkos shallow in the early morning and evening a little deeper during the day.
560923,Guest,2006-09-06 19:52:00,0,"Any of the usual early summer walleye spots in Big Sand will typically hold some schooling smallies in the fall. Drop shotting with a plastic minnow bait about 3' off the bottom can be deadly for lots of action when you see them on the sonar. (Look anywhere from 18-24' during the day.) Also look for schools of baitfish that have moved back into Vermillion, Moose and Mine Bays--for some nice shoreline action. On calm afternoons, it can be great for topwater too, you'll bring them up out of 20' or more of water--look toward the north shore of Big Sand, around Green Island and south-east shoreline around harbour on the drops. Chuck"
560982,Guest,2006-09-10 09:54:00,0,"I appreciate all the advice from Reels, Danny, Aaron and Chuck. Three of us, myself and another from west TN, and the other from St. Louis, leave this Thursday. We will try the patterns suggested. I catch large smallmouth down here in the south, and nice ones in spring and early summer up in Canada, but have yet to pattern the big Canadian fall smallmouth, except for smaller ones in the rapids. It is a confidence issue, fishing in the fall for smallmouth up north for us somewhat. We fish mainly tubes. Looking forward to giving it a more dedicated effort. It is very satisfying to develop new patterns. Thanks again, Don"
