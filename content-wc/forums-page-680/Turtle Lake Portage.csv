I got a kick out of your brother's walleye story, bet he still has bad dreams. Soooo, not trying to be to forward but how did you catch the walleyes in Whitefish, all we ever fish there is Northerns. Alfred's Inlet was our usual destination if the fishing was slow on our honey holes on LOTW and we needed a couple of fish for shore lunch, we always could swing up there with a five of diamonds, cast a dozen times and usually have lunch."
555500,Bill Krejca,2006-03-22 12:12:00,6107,"Re: the topsy barge. No, I never heard that story, but it doesn't surprise me. My first experience at Turtle was in 1939, when my parents first took me up. I was 11 months old. We stayed at the original portage camp/store, owned by the Hansons. As time went on, the camp was purchased by Adolph Baccus, and we stayed there several times a year until it was sold many years later. We then camped on various islands in Whitefish and Sabaskong until about 12 years ago. I remember when the channel was cut, forming the ""new"" (present)portage, in the 50's. The new portage went through many configurations, as various influences determined policy. The channel was opposed back in the 50's by, I believe, the province, as it was feared that the silt flowing in from the more fertile Sabaskong would settle on the lake trout eggs in Whitefish, preventing them from hatching. As the portage was considered a kind of "" major waterway"" by the federal authorities, they overruled, and the channel was built. They brought in a barge with a crane. For years, the channel was open, and water flowed either way, depending on the wind. The channel was finally closed off, due to the trout egg concern, and the various portaging configurations were tried, to permit passage, with varying degrees of success. My father first started fishing the area in 1935, after 10 years of camping/fishing in Minnesota. I have just completed writing a book on his/our fishing and camping experiences, and am seeking a publisher. He had stories of the area like you wouldn't believe."
555508,rpieske,2006-03-22 17:34:00,1276,Hey Bill: I bet the book would be fun reading for those of us who have been fishing LOTW waters for more than 50 years. Do you still get up there to fish? I spend from the middle of May till the middle of September fishing out of Nestor Falls. Mostly muskie fishing. I'd love to meet you and exchange tales.
555510,esgrams,2006-03-22 19:47:00,92,"Guys, My Dad started taking me to Sabaskong Bay when I was just 4 yrs old, I'm 38 now and have not missed but a handful of springs (due to having kids and getting married) since then. Bill, I would really like a copy of that book whether you get it published or not. I would like to give it to my Dad as a present for Father's Day, for all the great times I had fishing with him. Believe it or not I can remember every day on the water with him. Drop me a E-Mail at [email protected].. One of you have probably met or know the Cottams, who used to own Red Deer Lodge, Just north of Nestor. We got to be very good friends with Bob and Eve over the years and I was always treated like one of their kids whenever we were there. I remember sitting in the lodge at night listening to them talk about growing their business, making ice, and building their outpost cabins. I can remember thinking to myself that I could never have been that physically ""tough"", but then again I'm spoiled, when you really think about it. Actually when you think about it were all very spoiled compared to how they lived just to ""maintain"". I think they had better, Simple living, Good Friends and Family. Boy!!! Sorry about being long winded, I must need a career change, I think I'm stressed. Time for a NewCastle"
555516,Guest,2006-03-23 09:32:00,0,"Dear Mr. Krejca, I am the grandson of the Adolph Bockus You mentioned in your response. Your name was forwarded to me from Mark Jones who responded to an inquiry I posted on a similar forum. Adolph passed away when I was approx 12 years old. I visited the camp 1 time when I was 13, around 1977. Our base camp on that trip was Phil Hanson's camp, which I believe you are familiar with. The camp (TURTLE PORTAGE CAMP) was at that time again for sale, but still in fine shape based on a quick walk around. I am interested in its history, and location. Also, Adolph caught a record Muskie in 1941 that we still have, but there seems to be some mystry there as well. I would enjoy hearing anything you have to say on the matter, or connect me with others that might also be in the know. Email to: [email protected] Warmest regards, Jeff Bockus"
555517,Bill Krejca,2006-03-23 11:05:00,6107,"I still get up there once a year, am booked at Young's Wilderness Camp for week of Sep. 16 for some crappie fishing. Stop on over! My dad's last trip was at age 91; we actually camped out in Obabikon Bay. It wasn't the best time, due to his age, but as he loved the lake so much, I felt we'd try it one last time. He passed away at age 95, in 2000. He had a memory like an elephant, and never threw anything away. I still have his first Ontario fishing license, from Eva Green, dated 1935. When I told him I had decided to write a book on all the stories he told around the campfire, starting in 1998, we spent a lot of time with questions and answers. He would light up at each question, reliving his youthful experience as he explained in depth the details surrounding the story. He had some interesting and exceedingly humorous experiences, plus some great fishing. Jeff - sorry I butchered your family name, I have it correct in my book. It is great to make contact with you. Your grandfather was an interesting and very charitable human being. The National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame lists the muskie that your grandfather caught as being 53 lb, 12 oz, and was caught on Sep 16, 1940. If this is not correct, please let me know. The interesting part of this story regards the guide who accompanied your grandfather. His name was Oscar Brusven, one of the nicest persons I've know. Your grandfather was so happy for getting that fish, that several years later, he purchased the camp, making Oscar the manager for life! I have many pictures of Adolph, and Oscar, and my family. I plan another book just on the Turtle Portage stories. First, I have to find a willing publisher for my present endeavor."
555571,Guest,2006-03-23 12:44:00,0,"What an amazing stroke of luck to find you Bill. I assume you have maybe met my father, Walter (Red) Bockus ? Dad would be 94 if still alive. I actually met Oscar back in 1977, he was then probably in his 90's. A nice and likeable fellow, my father spoke highly of him. You tell a story I have not yet heard. I did not know how Adolph accquired the camp, only that my dad got into hot water with his first wife while staying an entire summer one year building new cabins etc..was supposed to be a week or two deal. My grandmother kept news paper clippings etc in a scrap book that is a wonderful archive about those days and ,""the fish"". I would be glad to scan and forward stuff to you if it would be of help (if I get Mom's ok, she gets a little freaky sometimes) I also would enjoy seeing some of your photo's with Grandad, Oscar, your family etc. Is the camp still intact, or run under new ownership? I would love to visit it again, but realize it is remote and have to have a guide that knows where it is. The pastor of my church has written and published many books, and is a close friend. I will ask him for contact information regarding publishing your book. Please put me in for a copy. Worth a shot I assume. Please feel free to email directly: [email protected] I'm excited about all this Bill, pretty neet stuff. Jeff Bockus"

555520,Guest,2006-03-23 14:38:00,0,"Jeff, The camp is now owned by a US resident named Wally Christiansen. He doesn't operate commercially, but runs it privately. He has built a new cabin there, and has kept it in very good shape. To my knowledge it is not for sale, as Wally uses it ALOT. I do also remember Oscar as a boy. I would say I was maybe 6 or so. He was a great uncle to my best friend in Morson. We would go to his house and he would give us a sugar cube as a treat! :) Good memories of that ole fella."

555262,Guest,2006-03-08 09:43:00,0,Bump I am curious about this as well.
555274,rpieske,2006-03-08 16:17:00,1276,"Last season it still had the same system. It periodically has some problems, but the biggest problem is cranking that big wheel to get the boat over. The last time I went over I had a 1900 Lund ProV. I am 6'5"" and nearly 300 lbs. and it was a total killer for me. At 62 years of age, I won't be doing it anymore. Now its pull the boat and put in directly on Whitefish. Good Luck."

Eric"
555417,Guest,2006-03-16 10:46:00,0,I just went by there a couple of days ago...they haven't done anything to the portage yet. We were told by the MNR last summer that they are going back to rubber rollers. They had wooden rollers to start with and they just got too beat up. They figure the rubber ones will work better.
555425,Bill Krejca,2006-03-16 17:40:00,6107,"Those rollers can be murder on anything attached to the transom of the boat. It is amazing that nothing ever seems to work there, but that the device always ends up like a horse that was designed by a committee, e.g., a camel, etc!"
555456,Hawker,2006-03-20 08:40:00,3967,"I guess I'm confused! (Pretty easy to get that way for me though) I read rubber/wooden rollers mentioned here so it's maybe not the portage I'm thinking of. It's been three to four years since I've been to the portage from Turtle to Whitefish but don't remember any rollers there. For lack of a better description, what I remembered there was a ""bunk"" system on steel rails, with steel wheels and that monstor six foot wheel to crank the bunk from one direction to the other. Someone I met there said there used to be rollers there but was replaced with the bunk & rails. Was still a bugger bear to move the boat across though, not something I'd want to do more than once or twice in a weeks trip. We didn't try to make the portage last year because someone at Young's told us it was broken at the time. Just curious myself now because I'd thought a day on Whitefish might be the ticket this year when we come up. Hawker I am a Fisherman FOR LIFE! It's not something I do, It is who I am!! I only ""WORK"" to support my ""Habit"" of fishing!!"
555471,Bill Krejca,2006-03-20 17:09:00,6107,"When they replaced the gates that no one used, a roller system was put in place. I believe the rollers were wooden. They did a great job of knocking off/ breaking tranducers. Also. sometimes on the way down, the outboard would knock against one or more rollers, doing it little good. Going down was about a 2 second ride vs the ""up"" being dependent on how many strong young boys were in your party. The noise going down always made the boat owner's teeth gnash - ka-boom, ka-oom, etc. I can hardly wait for the return to rollers!"
555491,esgrams,2006-03-21 18:27:00,92,"Bill, Did you know that when they were headed out to work on the portage, they loaded the cement mixer and equipment and all the mortar on a barge and didn't put enough ballast in the bottom. I guess it rolled over like a weeble-wobble and dumped its whole load on the bottom of whitefish. I said to the guy telling me that their must be a nice new reef to fish now, and he said OH NO! the MNR made them pull it all up. Talk about having a bad day. Hopefully they can come up with a better system for the portage instead of the rollers. I don't know what that would be but there has to be something that doesn't cause light-headedness and mild heart attacks"
555492,Guest,2006-03-21 22:08:00,0,"Sorry for my ignorance, but is it the Turtle bay that is in L.O.W.? For 15 years, My dad, brothers, and I used to rent boats from ""Vic & Dot's"" and boat uplake for about 10 miles - going into and through Turtle, on the way to our special island. The first year we built tables for cooking and eating. On our last trip there, 14 - 15 years later, the tables were still there, and usable. The many modifications, and repairs made by my family, and others, was obvious. But what a cool thing to have that continuity - AND - there was never any garbage on that island. That's one of the things I love about Canada. And we who love to fish there. Anyway, we used to fish an area near there called Alfred's inlet. Great fishing. We of course always caught a lot of northern, and quite a few over 36"". It took a few years to figure the walleye out, but what a fishery. One week, I caught 2 that were over 32"" and 10 pounds, and I also saw my brother lose one (after a 1/2 hour fight) that was at least 15 pounds or more. He had it up to the rock shore we were standing on, (oops - just gave away a secret), it made the last of 5 runs, and DOINK! his line snapped. He cried a good 10 minutes. His arms and legs shook for another hour. A guy in our town has a 16lb 5oz hanging on his office wall. I've seen it many times. My brother's eye was alot bigger than that. Well, at least the best I remember. Anyway, IS this the same area? I'd love to go back someday - we've now gone the route of outpost cabins, etc.... Don't know if I'd want to haul a boat over though. BUT...the fishin' IS pretty good............................"
