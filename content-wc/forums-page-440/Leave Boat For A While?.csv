I know I saw info on this some time ago, but have spent 1/2 hr or more searching to no avail. I believe the info talked about a form to be filled out. Does anyone have the information? Thanks. Bill Krejca"

Just tell them at the border on your way up and they will give you the form to fill out and leave with the boat. When returning to the states with my boat I stop at Canadian border turn in the form and go on my way. It doesn't cost anything, its just the way the Canadian Govt. wants to do it, its no big deal."

As one guy said ""what they (border officials) don't know won't hurt them."" And before anyone jumps on this, I'll stipulate agreement with this comment specifically about leaving the boat, NOT any other issue such as hiding firearms, illegal bait, overages on alcohol, etc, so let's not bother going there."
