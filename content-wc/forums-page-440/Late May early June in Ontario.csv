Anyone know how this happened? Is there a plan for a new bait shop? I'm referring to the shop that was on the corner of the highway and highway 105 headed north to Ear Falls. LoDo"

1432228,countylineshooter,2012-05-07 20:53:00,11,I can confirm that it burned down. When we stopped last year no one knew if there was plans to rebuild.
1432233,wallydave,2012-05-07 20:58:00,2151,Try a search for the Corner station. A couple years ago it burned down. If memory serves me it was a Labor Day weekend. I miss the Corner. We stopped there for gas and lures on the way north. We stopped there on the way south for gas and dry ice. Now we stop at Dutchies for beer on the wat up and the dry ice to keep the fillets cold on the way home. Oh yea don't forget the Cuban cigars!!

1432347,Opie,2012-05-08 06:59:00,129,One of my all time favorite shows. Had to order the whole 6 seasons on DVD. The bride and I both love the show.
1432361,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-08 07:17:00,725,"The Village Corner was such a staple of our Canadian routine and we sure miss the breakfasts there. We are satisfied with Buster's, although it is really not the same. Tackle is available at Bobby's (bring your vaseline-it ain't cheap!) as well as basic groceries. We stay with Gayle at the Pine Grove on Fridays, she is a trip as well. That's how we do it! 9 freakin' days!"
