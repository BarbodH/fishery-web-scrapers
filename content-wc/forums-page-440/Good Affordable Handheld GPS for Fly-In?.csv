Not sure if this model is discontinued or not, but the units themselves are fairly cheap now.My friend has a Lowrance iFinder H20c that he uses without any additional maps. Works great for tracking and marking waypoints.Without purchasing extra maps, I think the H20 unit is better. As mentioned, it is discontinued and I am not sure if the newer models compare well with it or not though.The Garmin GPSMAP 76Cx is often recommended by a lot of folks as well."
