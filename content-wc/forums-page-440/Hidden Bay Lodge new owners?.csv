I am confident you will enjoy Blackstone Lake this season. It's almost fully booked.We will see you in July! Shaggy
1431640,Guest,2012-05-06 20:09:00,0,Raymond is shaggy.. Great guy! Used to go to sea graves and caught trout right in front of the camp. Walleye fishing was fabulous there two. Have been going to hidden bay twice a year for over 22 years.
1292169,wallydave,2011-04-07 16:26:00,2151,"I was doing my usual fishing trip withdrawal therapy,(surfing different web sites) and I noticed Hidden Bay Lodge has new owners. Anybody have any info on the old and or new owners?"
1292219,55walleyes,2011-04-07 18:43:00,131,I have trip booked with them in July and have not heard anything about this so I would appreciate any info. I saw no mention of ownership change on their website.
1292270,wallydave,2011-04-07 20:59:00,2151,"55walleyes, I saw the info on flashing banner on thier home page, it mentioned different management, so perhaps I worded my post wrong. I have seen the you-tube video, along with some posts here, it looks like a spot I would like to try. Have you been on thier lakes before?"
1292501,55walleyes,2011-04-08 14:36:00,131,Went to an outpost on Hooker Lake for years but they can no longer go there. Not sure why. Some kind of problem with government. Hooker was an outstanding fishery. Tried their Highstone outpost last year. Fishing was just OK but not what I was used to at Hooker.
1292504,wallydave,2011-04-08 14:41:00,2151,"Numbers wise what was the difference? Same time of year, water levels, weather? I guess by going with them again, they treated your group well, are you trying a different lake and time of year?"
1292508,55walleyes,2011-04-08 14:47:00,131,Always been satisfied with facilities and treatment. Food package is excellent. Fish at Highstone were a little smaller and did not catch near as many as I used to at Hooker. I am going to Blackstone this July. Heard good things about Blackstone.
1292780,Hidden Bay Lodge,2011-04-09 10:41:00,12,"Hi wallydave!Hidden Bay here. The Reinke Family still are the owners, ever since 1970. You are correct. the website banner does say ""Under new management"". Karls wife, Vonnie Reinke took over the Manger reins 2 seasons ago, when their son moved on over seas for a new career opportunity.You can be rest assured you will receive the fabulous family owned experience you expect when you choose to come fishing with us. Please feel free to drop me an email [email protected] and I will be more than happy to answer your questions. Or give me a call at home 403 313 7620 if you would like to talk fishing.Backstone lake and Miniss lake have few spaces open for the 2011 season. Located on the Cat and Miniss rivers, they are both fish factories! They will not disappoint. Armit lake, on the same water shed as Hooker Lake, offers great numbers.Raymond"
1292819,wallydave,2011-04-09 14:46:00,2151,"Thanks for the info! I have my trip for this year. I am taking a new guy to Goose Bay, on Lac Seul, but I am looking for new waters for future trips! Good Luck !"
1292871,55walleyes,2011-04-09 20:08:00,131,"Is Raymond's alias ""Shaggy""?"
1293073,the big gulp alive,2011-04-10 12:31:00,3,"OK, so I have been taking Ontario trips for 24 years. The first few, when I was young and dumb, were not the best. I didn't know how to pick a lake or an outfitter. After three years and three different outfitters I tried Hidden Bay. To say the fishing was far beyond what I experienced at the other camps would be a gross understatement. I have fished Armit, Blackstone, Miniss, Hooker and Seagraves. ALL and I repeat ALL of the lakes I have fished had excellent fishing. While I cannot claim to have ever caught an 12 pound Walleye or 48"" Northern, I have caught my share of 40+ inch Northerns and 30"" Walleyes. On almost every trip there have been holes where I and my boat partner have pulled 50+ fish in less than an hour. So I can tell you the fish are there, they are big, and they are plentiful. As far as management is concerned I do know that the same family runs the business. One of the son's left the business four years ago (I think). To be perfectly honest, I have been treated even better since the change. What has struck me is that they seem to care even more now. They have upgraded their outposts too! BTW.... The MOM runs the business, the kids just don't know it.I and my group talked to Tim in Minneapolis and found out that they are opening Seagraves this year after beeing closed for several years. When I asked why I found it amazing how candid he was. He said the family has been moving through each of the outposts upgrading them to improve his customer experience and then joked ""we are not made out of money and it takes a while""... We promply booked because we remembered how much fun the lake trout fishing was when we were there in 2003.Trust me.... You are going to love your trip!"
