1432136,wallydave,2012-05-07 18:23:00,2151,"Last year the first full week of June, we got a very small glimpse of the Northern lights! We were at Goose Bay Camp, Ear Falls, it was a week of no moon, and it was late in the evening 11-midnight maybe. It was like a cloud that faded in and out."
1432167,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-07 19:19:00,138,During high solar activity. Can happen anytime of the year.
1432192,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-07 19:59:00,725,"Every time i have seen them, it seems green is the dominant color. It is definitely cool and worth losing a little sleep. We have a guy that has to pee every night and he has strict orders to wake several of us if he sees them."
1432196,LoDo,2012-05-07 20:07:00,721,"Mike7759 - bah ha hah .... you got me. HeHookhimself - ha! Thats a good rule. I remember them as a kid, however it's been a little while since I've seen them. I'll be in the Caribou National Park in Ontario May 28 - June 6. Can't wait! Thank you!"
1432215,birddogger,2012-05-07 20:35:00,43,"Winter is the best time of seeing the northern lights, anytime is possible, but they appear more often in the winter."
1432236,Pooch,2012-05-07 21:03:00,4619,"With all the sunspot activity this year, I would think that there should be a decent light show off and on all summer. I hope anyway.The solar flares have really screwed up some precision Ag stuff this spring. JD has sent out bulletins warning of disruptions especially for the RTK users.Pooch"
