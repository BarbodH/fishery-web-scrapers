1431728,JVB1,2012-05-07 06:18:00,12,"Not real happy to here about the Indians and how heavy this body of water is fished. My hopes are that we are going early enough in the season to avoid the ""pressure"" fishing. I will take your advice into consideration for next year. We have fished ""Rainy Lake"" for many years and found the pressure from so many outfitters and locals made it very tough to fish no matter what time of the year."
1401764,Larry S,2012-03-02 10:14:00,665,"Rappoo,I go with guys from Pittsburgh the last 4 years and we have gone on trips to the Pickle Lake Area. They have been on 6 trips to Pickle Lake,first with Albany River Outfitters now North of 51 Outfitters to Bow Lake 3 times,Wetlauffer Lake 2 times which I went on in 2009.And Otoskwin lake. I went on a trip with North Caribou Outfitters to North Caribou lake in 2007,a great fishery. This year we are going with Pickle Lake Outfitters(Pete Johnson's Outpost's) to Neawagank Lake June 26 to July 6th. Have you ever gone with any of these outfitters? I have never fished in Quebec,the guys have a number of times,but I don't know where but will ask if they have fished where you are going Have a great trip and post a report when you get back Larry S"
1401834,Freytown,2012-03-02 12:48:00,770,"Rappoo,I fished Baie Mattawa many times but mostly in Sept. I have fished there in June also and fishing was usually good. I experienced poor fish also but mostly fishing was very good. The weather can make or break a week of fishing but we can't control that.I never used Air Tamarac but have seen their cabins/boats and agree that this is a very good outfitter.Remember that Mattawa can be fished (and it is) by folks driving into the Baie Poisson west of Mattawa. That's what my group always did it's not that far away.Air Tamarac also has cabins on Baie Sarrana which I prefer over Mattawa as I never had a bad experience on Sarrana. Sarrana can be reach from Baie Poisson but is a much further travel. One thing I will say is you could never fish that entire area it's hugh. Good luck."
1404588,octanehi5,2012-03-09 05:16:00,1104,"The local indians are aloud to net all the fish they want, that puts alot of pressure on that lake along with all the differant outfitters. The times that I fished the gouin,The fish in the school you were in stayed about the same size. So we had to move around to find bigger fish"
1408587,kegisfly,2012-03-18 18:21:00,22,"Nothing of note as far as mayflies. July tends to be a lot less ""buggy"" in general in that area. As far as water level... 3 years ago (2009) We had good fishing with high water levels at Gouin. 2 years ago (2010) We had okay fishing, which improved to good fishing (as we figured out the pattern) with really low water levels at Gouin. Last year (2011) with above avg. water levels, not so good, as I reported. As far as trying deep water and/or fishing ""flowing"" water (between islands)... We tried some of it, but, maybe should have given it more effort when our normal patterns failed. We did fish that feeder stream at the south end of Mattawa. And had some quick action with some nice eyes (and a couple of pike). But, the action would die after about 15 minutes. Maybe in colder water it would have been better because most of that area is 8 ft or less deep. There are a ton of snags and the area probably experiences a lot of fishing pressure also. Thanks all for your thoughts."
1408629,octanehi5,2012-03-18 19:55:00,1104,"It is very difficult to pattern the gouin from one yr to the next. I have alot of fishing time on bay du nord in the gouin, but its the same way. Once you find them you should do well. I know lac Hebert very well sometimes we fish the usual haunts 20'-8' with no luck and then have caught them on jigs in 42' of water,and later that day catch them in the bays in 8'. If we don't catch anything in 5 mins it time to move. we have also fished a bay that the wind has blown into all day, at just before sunset on stick baits and could not keep a lure in the water.catching over 150 after 6:30 in the evening ,then talking to other that night that did not catch 25% of that many fish. The Gouin or Hebert if you are in the right place at the right time you will be amazed. Good luck we will be on Hebert the first week in july, get the beer batter ready"
1427155,JVB1,2012-04-27 07:44:00,12,"We are going into Mattawa cabin 46 June 9th through the 17th I was hoping to get any insight on the area. This will be our first time on the Gouin, we fish Rainy Lake and have good luck there. Consistent Pike in the 40"" range and great golden eyes. Hope that Mattawa will give us same results."
1427246,octanehi5,2012-04-27 10:38:00,1104,"You are going at a good time the water should still be on the cold side the pike should be shallow,the walleyes 20'-8' jiging. I can tell you that you may hook a pike in there that you may not want in the boat (AKA Monsters).I am sure Jean Owner of AT can show you a map and mark you some spots.Wind blowing out of the east is least,not the best time to fish, South, south west, west, north west , north winds are what you want to fish, just before a thunder storm is a great time. I would suggest , don't leave fish to find fish. At that time you may find fish near the inflow of a stream or brook, like were the walleye spawn. You guys are fishermen you will have a great time If you like PM me and I will give you a few pointers"
1428427,Guest,2012-04-30 07:06:00,0,"Rappoo, My group has fished the gouin 15yrs, hanotaux, mattawa, Du male, Saraana, that time of yr. temp seems to be the thing . We look for back bays that are warming up first 3 to 15 ft of water if we find fall fish (that chub looking fish that has EAT ME written on him) theres walleyes and pike nearby. Like octane says if the wind is beating a shore line all the better, it can be a boat handleing nightmare but worth it. We pull worm harnesses and rapalas worms catch more rapalas catch bigger. Dont waste time fishing fish that wont bite, come back later if the wind starts beating that spot they will bite. Were going the same week, enjoy every moment its heaven on earth ."
1430559,tshea,2012-05-04 08:24:00,36,Any word on Gouin water levels for 2012 ?Looks like most of the ice is gone.ThanksTodd.
1431356,octanehi5,2012-05-06 07:58:00,1104,"I know that Air Tam are great outfitters, I go with them every yr.The gouin is a good fishery with many outfitters on it and do not forget the indians that can take as many fish ,by what ever methode they choose. very heavy pressure on that body of water. I think it would be in your best interest to spend the extra $200 and fly into Hebert with them. I have fished both of them many times and for my $ I'm going to Hebert. Just my two cents Have a great trip this yr where ever you are going."
1385435,kegisfly,2012-01-24 10:13:00,22,"Trying to get a feel for others' experiences last year on the Gouin. Our group of 4 went to Mattawa bay with Air Tamarac in early July last year and had somewhat of a tough time. We have a few years of experience on the Gouin in the Sarana bays, so, we thought this year we would have even more success. The weather was generally sunny with highs in the 70's (couple of cool mornings) which resulted in a pretty strong and steady wind producing white caps almost every day by early afternoon. Surface water temps were right around 70. The Gouin was high this year (above avg water levels). We prefer the action of pike fishing and probably devote a little more time to it (60-65%), but, have always been able to find some consistent walleye fishing. In 2011, we did not find consistent walleye or pike fishing, nor could we put together any particular pattern. Overall, it seemed like we caught about a 1/3 of the fish we usually catch on the Gouin. We are trying to figure out what we could improve on, if this was an off year, or if Mattawa is just tougher to pattern. Any thoughts are appreciated."
1392812,octanehi5,2012-02-11 10:14:00,1104,"Kegis The gouin water level goes up and down so much its hard to fish the same spots from yr to yr. no matter what outfitter you are with. In july the fish will tend to be deep. I have caught Walleye's in 42' of water jigging. Change your luck and fly into Hebert, with air Tam. water level is constant"
1397583,kegisfly,2012-02-22 06:52:00,22,Thanks for the response. How is Hebert for pike?
1397596,Pikehunters,2012-02-22 07:12:00,100,Did you hit prime may fly hatch. That can really make or break a week
1397958,trapperbob,2012-02-22 20:11:00,45,We are headed to sarana bay this yearwith tamarac. We have fished Gouin before but at plamodon bay area. We are staying in cabin #30. Looking for any hints at where to try. We will be there in early July.
1398034,GP-NJ,2012-02-23 05:17:00,156,Pikehunters X2. Not the best time period to go.
1398055,octanehi5,2012-02-23 06:32:00,1104,"The Pike fishing at Hebert is good, last yr we caught 4 over 40, my personal best was 25# and 43"" they are all back in the lake. Fishing the gouin has alot to do with the water level, In july fish it deep. consentrate on fishing narrows were the water is moving though"
1401285,rappoo,2012-03-01 10:52:00,5,"We will be heading to Gouin & Mattawa Bay #45 with Air Tamarac around the first week in June. Have been on several fly-ins out of Pickle Lake, but amost no experience in this area other than a pretty non-productive 5 days in Quebec last year. Our goal of course is to get away, catch and eat some Walleyes, and perhaps catch a few, reasonable sized Northerns, just for fun. Would really appreciate feedback or suggestions from anyone with good info regarding this area. Thanx, Rappoo."
1401683,a3dad,2012-03-02 07:37:00,115,"rappoo, check out this post for some info: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=matawa At the most southern point of the bay there is a feeder stream that comes in and is closed to fishing until June 1st. You should definitely give it a try."
1401701,rappoo,2012-03-02 08:27:00,5,"a3dad, Thanx a bunch!! Your msgs & maps/pics are hot off the color printer & in my go bag. Your msg & thoughfulness will guide our initial time there and could well set the stage for an unforgetable trip (although almost all of them are, when you think about it). This reinforces my long-held opinion that Walleye Central is a unique place with lots of great folks. I've been a member for quite a while but am guilty of not posting. Will try to add my 2 cents without overdoing it in the future. Thanx all."
