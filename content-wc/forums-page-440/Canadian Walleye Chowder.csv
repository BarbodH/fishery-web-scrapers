This recipe is simple and forgiving, perfect for us camp chefs in the bushFor 8 hungry fishermenIngredients:3 or 4 -17"" walleyes, filleted and diced into 1/2 cubes or so6 or 7 cans of cream of potato soup1# bacon1 or 2 large onions diced5 or 6 stalks celery dicedHeavy cream or 1/2 & 1/2 or milkTobasscoCook the bacon crisp and set aside. Retain half of the grease and put into the camp pot. First throw the diced celery and cook down about 2 minutes and then throw in the onion and cook down a bit more. (Not quite clear) Add the cubed walleye and cut the heat some. At this point a beer is highly recommended. Put all the canned soup in and use your cream to clean out the remnants left in the can. I often use the cream 1/2 & 1/2 and milk as not to stress the supply of my dairy. Crumble the bacon and toss in. Cook this on low heat for about 15 more minutes making sure it doesn't stick too bad on the bottom of the crappy camp pot. Give her several shots of tobassco and put the bottle on the table. I want more. I like to garnish with green onion on top of each bowl served.Enjoy. Man o man it just doesn't get any better."

1431919,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 12:02:00,1460,With you Hooks? Heck yea!
1431944,camp chef,2012-05-07 12:28:00,915,I hope you wash your hands before you start cubing the fillets.
1431957,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 12:37:00,1460,"Now that right there is funny. I guess I don't remember if I do or not. You and your fishing pard may want to cut this in half, however my Dad used to love warmed up chowder for breakfast."
1431977,camp chef,2012-05-07 12:58:00,915,I have already added the ingredients to my shopping list.... can't wait...thanks
1431979,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 13:02:00,1460,"Coming from you, I'm honored. Just remember, you can adjust the liquids and the amount of walleye more or less to you own taste."
1431990,JayM5209,2012-05-07 13:13:00,1050,"Pikeslayer8, great recipe! And you're right, nothing beats it on a cold, windy, rainy evening. Our group always reserves Wednesday night as chowder night.A couple of slight variations for your consideration -If you don't need milk or cream for other purposes and want to minimize refrigeration needs, canned evaporated milk (not sweet Eagle brand condensed!!) serves the purpose very well.I start out with a quart of chicken stock to boil an additional diced potato or two, tossing in several bay leaves and a bottle of clam juice. When the spuds are tender, all this goes into the pot with your ingredients.If you like your chowder a little thicker, stir a tablespoon or two of flour into the celery and onions after they're softened in the bacon grease, then stir in some of the liquid to make a blonde roux.Need a little color? Add a finely diced green or red bell pepper.A loaf or two of Italian or French bread, sliced thick , buttered and rubbed with garlic, then popped under the broiler just long enough to brown it a bit before serving goes well with the chowder.Dang, you made me hungry!"
1432021,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-07 13:55:00,1460,"Jay, Love that evaporated milk idea. I would still kick it up and make it creamier, however. The clam juice and peppers are great additions as well. Your bread description is makin my mouth water. Now Your makin me hungry. I usually make this after a cold morning on the lake when the anger level at the fish is low. When I come in off the lake and my joints are stiff and I gotta have my kids help me get my raingear off, I firstly want the weather to improve and the wind to calm down some, and the sun to pop. The good thing about my chowder using the canned soup is that it only takes about 30-40 minutes to complete and is not to labor intensive. Time enough for the weather to change for the better and get after the walleyes. If not, time for a game of pitch and a nap."
