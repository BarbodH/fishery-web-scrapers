1342459,Guest,2011-08-22 08:13:00,0,"Everything you need is provided. Cooking grate, pots, long handle pans, lard, even the fish crisp is provided. Something that I have been doing for years is cooking steaks on our shore lunch. It is so much easier. We cook walleye back at the cabin. Nevertheless everything is there."
1342615,camp chef,2011-08-22 15:03:00,915,We too have moved our fish fries back to camp for sake of ease. If it is necessary or desirable to stay out all day... a sandwich in the boat is a lot quicker and easier.
1343990,Skyraptor,2011-08-26 11:15:00,291,"55Walleye, is Highstone the only outpost on the lake?"
1344043,55walleyes,2011-08-26 13:33:00,131,There is another outpost. I am not sure if it is actually on Highstone but it is somewhat close. I think maybe it is ran by Knobby's but not sure.
1431634,Guest,2012-05-06 20:01:00,0,Have been going to hidden bay for 22+ years and have never been disappointed great owners(vonnie) and great people . Pilots are the best.. They are the real deal. We go twice each year and the walleye fishing is off the charts. Accommodations and food are great. These people truly care about their clients and service is top notch. Highly highly recommend!!!
1337503,Guest,2011-08-04 23:27:00,0,"Hi All! I spotted an ad on Ebay from Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout Ontario. There are offering a 30% discount on their fly in fishing this fall to some of their outpost cabins Can anyone here recommend them or give me a review? I spoke with ""shaggy"" at Hidden Bay. Certainly seems legit. He was very helpful and pleasant. He says the fishing has been great up there. Great weather too. I just like to hear from another walleye slayer before I hand over the cash! Thanks for any help. Bill"
1337534,Guest,2011-08-05 06:39:00,0,"Our group of married couples went through them 6 times. We went to Armit and Gage. They treated us great, but that was 5 years ago. Rick who used to run it has left and his brother and mother run the show. We couldn't eat all the food they sent with. They discounted our wives as if they were a child which I don't know if that applies with this special deal. We quit going only to try something new and the fact we our now in our 60's and the communication wasn't great. Now I believe they have computers at each outpost. I talked to them at the sport show in Minneapolis. I wouldn't be afraid to try them, expecially at the discounted price."

1337755,55walleyes,2011-08-05 19:12:00,131,"Benn a customer for years. I highly recommend them. Went to Blackstone for first time this year. Our group of 4 caught a 28"", 3 - 27 inchers, multiple 25's and 26's and lots other quality walleye.."
1338578,Ryan Coke,2011-08-08 21:54:00,9,"Highly Recommended!Our group went fishing with Hidden Bay last year on one of their Fall Fishing Specials.Here is the report I posted on the forum last year:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hi All!!! Here's our report!Just returned home from our 4 day fly in trip With Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout Ontario.The 4 of us flew to their cabin on Miniss lake, and all I can say is ""WOW""The Fishing is fantastic! We Caught 2 - 30"" and 1 - 31"" Walleyes and 1 40"" Northern. The fishing was very steady. Good sizes and numbers. Never a dull moment.The folks at Hidden Bay Lodge were amazing! They are very hospitable, even called us a couple times over their outpost satellite internet phone to see how we were doing and if there was anything we needed on the check flight. That was a great to know they were looking out for us.The food provided package is the way to go. No need to worry and work on getting all your food together before your drive to Canada, only to have their customs take stuff away, like in years past. Hidden Bays food provisions was well stocked and we didn't go hungry. The BBQ Chickens were delicious, and dont get me started on the home made pies!Their 2 for 1 special is an amazing deal, I hope they will have them again next year. Regardless, We would pay full rate for their services and the fishing. Well done Hidden Bay!!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To many scheduling conflicts this summer to get the group together for another trip with Hidden Bay. I only hope it works out for 2012. I will definitely will be calling Hidden Bay if it does. Boy them pies were tasty!Just go! You wont be disappointed. You will have a great time with them!Ryan"
1338999,the big gulp alive,2011-08-10 09:42:00,3,"OK.... I went twice this year. Early we went to Minnis and killed the Walleye... Multiple 24+"" and quite a few 38+ Northern. We just came back from a trip to Armit (my first time at that lake). The fishing was amazing. The group that came out as we were going in said they never traveled more than 1/2 mile from the cabin and they caught hundreds. This is what you need to know about Hidden Bay. It has been family owned for many years. They are as friendly and helpful as you can imagine. They fly a modern caravan which can take up to 8 fishermen at a time and the travel times to their lakes are between 20 and 30 minutes of flying. I have been in many a Beaver...they are loud and slow and can only take a few passengers so the Caravan is an awesome perk that you won't see with many outfitters. The cabins are all clean, running hot and cold water and flush toilets and showers (love flush toilets). Don't tell the misses but they even have phones linked to their satellite internet. The only lake I have not fished at Hidden Bay is Raggedwood. All the other are great.BTW....my fishing tip..... Although Hidden Bay may not like this comment I would recommend that you do not use minnows (they die quick). For the past two years (4 trips) we have been using the gulp alives and they are awesome. Every bit as productive as minnows but they stay on the hook. It is not uncommon to catch 5-10 fish on one gulp.... AND NO I do not work for the Gulp folk, I am a Firefighter....GO TO HIDDEN BAY...... trust me you will love it."
1340572,Guest,2011-08-15 14:08:00,0,"Been to Hidden Bay many times. Simply the best outfitter out there. From the modern Cessna Caravan, well maintained boats and motors not to mention high hour pilots who love to be there. The staff will take care of your every need. Cabins are great and the internet helps with the weather game. The Fishing is always good. Don't forget the homemade pies and cookies. The only problem is all the food they include is way to much to eat. Definitely well worth the price. Going back aug. 27."
1341177,wallydave,2011-08-17 09:03:00,2151,"Raymoan just posted a review on his to with Hidden Bay, sounds like his group had a great trip! I almost wish I could go with you!"
1341430,Skyraptor,2011-08-18 06:26:00,291,How is the fishing on Highstone lake? Seems this is the only outpost that Hidden Bay has for groups of 2 people.
1341846,55walleyes,2011-08-19 13:36:00,131,Been there once. Fishing was OK. Not great/Not bad. Cabin and equipment were good.
