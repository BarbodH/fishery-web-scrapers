I'd like to check temps regularly to see how temps are changing over time, without bugging some of our regular members every day! Ideas? Suggestions? Thanks, Bill"

This would probably be somewhat intermittent, but this might be a good feature for them to incorporate into these reports, and draw more folks on a regular basis to their site. As you are aware, surface water temp can fluctuate a great deal, even on the same body of water, and with changes in depth, wind direction, etc., so at best, it would just be an indication of season progression. An interesting proposal, however. Bill"

It would help with the pre-fishing planning, and map work. They do this for the Great Lakes, and it's really interesting and helpful for fishermen. Check it out: http://www.coastwatch.msu.edu/ Bill"

The depth through the rags was only 1.5 feet as well. Even so, I still had to maneuver a 16' with a 20hp around the stumps below the under the water as they came up a foot or so. So I don't imagine the big boats/house boats will be going through the Rags on opener. As for a regulated water temp guide, I haven't heard of one for Lac Seul, but I'll continue to post temps for the next few weeks. dragon"
