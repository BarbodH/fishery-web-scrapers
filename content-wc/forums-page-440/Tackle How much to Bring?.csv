1432489,labsrus,2012-05-08 10:30:00,557,Good ideas so far Really dependsin on how you fish Jigs are a go to method of fishing so a variety of colors are a great idea along with twister tails to go witht hem. We alos like to troll with worm harness set ups. so a ziplock bag of harnesses in small bags alos goes in the tackle box We alos bring along a few stick baits like Rapelas and some crank baits Spoons are used when we are looking for pike.
1432566,Guest,2012-05-08 12:45:00,0,"i feel like i way underpack compared to you guys. for my canoe trip to quetico, we use soft plastics and cranks per you cant use live bait. i bring about 25 jigs of assorted colors. 1/8 only, anything bigger is a waste. i bring about 30 plastic trailers(i prefer 4"" ringworms) of assorted colors as well. i bring about 15 cranks in depths from 3-30 feet. i prefer tail dancers and shad x raps. i fish 6lb test mono on the jig rod and 10lb pp on the baitcaster. i lose maybe 10 jigs in a week long trip. when fishing from a canoe you are really mobile and can get 95% of your snags back. we never anchor, all drifting. if youre in a boat is should be about the same. with that said we do a lot of portaging so weight/volume is a confining issue as well. cant imagine id bring much more stuff if i was in a boat though. also per the fishing regs up there you can only use one line per person. dunno how it is on that lake but more rods per person =more unattended jigs=more snags=more losses."
1432652,elway12,2012-05-08 15:50:00,335,"This is always one of the toughest questions. I would say most people tend to bring too much(including me). Our guides and hosts at our resort always say people bring WAY too much especially lures since jigs can out fish most of those on most days. I agree that the rocks of the Canadian lakes can really eat up lures, jigs and bottom bouncers. I think a person needs to examine what they plan on fishing with and how ""on point"" they are when jigging and BB. I have never lost too many jigs/BB but others in my group fishing the same boat/lake go thru 5x as many. As long as you have enough of the size/weight of jig you will be fine. Also many places have tackle you could buy if in a pinch or from others in camp. To give you a reference - I pack the tackle for my group of 3 (me, Dad and brother). Al ofour tackle fits in one large/2 sided Plano tackle box plus a one level Plano jig container. We fish for 5 days. We have never come close to using all of the stuff of anything I have packed and we fish long hours."
1432726,Fishin Fun,2012-05-08 17:59:00,218,"Oh god. I always bring too much. Never used 80% of it. But I always make sure I have enough jigs. All different colors and a couple different sizes. My tackle box weighs a ton. I must get it from my dad because when he went fishing, he always brought 2 tackle boxes full of stuff. ""Just in case."""
1432074,NathanH,2012-05-07 15:57:00,697,"I am going to Rainy Lake North West Arm in a few weeks. Wanted to know how many jigs should one bring? Is this an area where I can lose a lot of jigs to snags ect? As well any advise on the numbers of other poducts Plastics, Crankbaits ect. people take would help. I dont want to be the guy who has 2 tackle boxes full of stuff. But I dont want to be the guy who runs short either."
1432181,Nimstug,2012-05-07 19:37:00,2605,"Hi Nathan, I'll be at the Northwest arm in September. Plan on losing jigs. One 3600 box full of jigs will be way more than you need. My son and I fish using the one box and never come close to worrying about running out. We mostly use 1/4 and 3/8 oz. I have a few lighter ones but don't think I've ever used them on Rainy. A 3600 box of twister tails is more than you need too. Mostly 3"" or 4"" and a few 5""ers. We toss a lot of spinnerbaits and some years we might have one or two destroyed and the next year we'll go through 10 or 12. We don't troll much so that may be why we don't lose many cranks. Since I use my boat, I have my tackle box that has three trays of cranks but we probably only use a half dozen, once we see what the fish are doing. We'll have a few spoons with us, bass style buzz baits, and maybe a half dozen spinner rigs. A lot depends on how you like to fish but that's what works for us. NimstugSupport the right to keep and arm bears!"
1432211,catran3,2012-05-07 20:29:00,29,"One 3600 box full of jigs OK let me ask the stupid question- what is one 3600 box full of jigs? How many exactly is that- don't tell me 3600 jigs, if so I need to go shopping for more jigs!"
1432216,jkonop,2012-05-07 20:38:00,544,3600 is the tackle box size...http://www.amazon.com/Plano-3600-Pro...sr=1-1-catcorr
1432253,Nimstug,2012-05-07 21:35:00,2605,"Exactly 85. Gee, I dunno. Go buy a hundred. If there's room left over in the box, buy more. If they all don't fit, sell them to one of the other guys or save them for next time. Nimstug...and there will be a next time."
1432357,catran3,2012-05-08 07:09:00,29,SEE- I knew it was a stupid question
1432369,Pezman38,2012-05-08 07:22:00,3196,"Catran3 it wasn't a stupid question at all. When I buy jigs I try to get 8-10 at a time. Different colors of course and different styles. I switch jigs a lot, even when catching fish. If I go 5 mins without a bite on a color while marking fish I change. If I pick one up on the new color, and another fish 5 mins later, I change again. In my experience when I change I can sometimes go from 1-2 fish every 10 mins, to 3-5 fish every ten minutes. This doesn't always work, the trick is finding active feeding fish. Sometimes after a color change it gets worse and I go back to the original. Experiment, is basilcally all I am getting at. If you find fish make sure to try a couple different styles and colors before you move on. If you are fishing areas with lots of snags as shown on your sonar unit, try to jig just off the bottom and you will lose less jigs."
1432419,JayM5209,2012-05-08 08:37:00,1050,"Nathan, the easy, simple answer is, ""Take less than 10% of what I haul up there every year and you'll have at least twice as much as you need."" But that answer doesn't really help ya, so just take the advice others share with you. It's so dang easy to take way, way, way too much."
1432467,tv4fish,2012-05-08 09:51:00,2694,"Nathan: Although I don't know the area that you will be fishing, I will say this about Canadian shield rocks- the crevices will get your jig faster than any other ""snags"". If you do vertical jigging while drifting- you will learn to ""feel"" when your jig is going to get ""sucked into"" a crevice. It just takes doing it and you will learn to pull it up and out before you let it ""getcha""."
1432477,Mike Kansas,2012-05-08 10:08:00,1463,"Great question Nathan. I once fished with a guy who used the same jig all week on Lac Seul and he caught a bunch of fish. When I go for a week I will take about 200 Jigs. I probably go through 25 or so but the 200 jigs gives me the variety of color and sizes I want. Jig sizes 3/16,1/4,3/8 colors Glitter Gold,Purple,Char,Green,Silver and Pink. Plain Jigs Char,Pink, Orange,White. I also will have 60 Cranks or so in depths from 2' to 15'. Bright colors with soft Wooble. I will fish Jigs with both Minnows and Crawlers. Both work well and whatever they are hitting on that day they will get. Good luck, Mike Kansas Sirmanski"
