1431933,camp chef,2012-05-07 12:18:00,915,"There isn't much we haven't fished in and like most, I prefer some rain and chop,but as age creeps up on us, my fishing partner and I are likely to cut our fishing day short if we are getting beat up and soaked ( We have top of the line rain suits) and enjoy a cocktail and game of gin as our gear dries.As much as I love fishing in the harsh conditions, the length of time that I can enjoy it has diminished.As my Dad so eloquently put it. ""I guess I am just not as mad at them as I used to be"""
1432511,Rivratz,2012-05-08 11:06:00,105,"We go to Canada to Fish!!! and fish, and fish some more! Of course, we also go to relax and enjoy ourselves! If you feel like coming in for lunch, grab a bite, knock down a brew or two, and take a power nap, it's your vacation, why not! Unfortunately, most Hot Spots are 15 miles from camp. Ok, not all of them, but most of them. The far away spots make it difficult to return to camp. We all know what the weather in Canada can be like eh, Huh??? Unless a high pressure system is totally dominating, the weather can and will change 15 times a day. At 7am it's gorgeous outside. Slap some sunscreen on, forget the rain gear and boots, don't need em, and head out for the day! By 11am, huge T storms are on top of you, the waves kick up to 3plus foot swells, and lightning is cracking all over da place. Head in to some sheltered bay, and hopefully it passes as quickly as it came. Maybe catch a huge musky or northern in that bay while your waiting. I've been to Canada in July, and have experienced 4 seasons in a day. Cool misty rain, then it clears and gets hot, all of a sudden, a huge storm with quarter sized hail started to pound me, finished the afternoon with 68 degrees and perfect weather. Sure it would be great to see a partly cloudy sky, with westerly breezes, creating the perfect walleye chop, with temps between 68 and 75 degrees everyday while we are there. Ain't gonna happen, unless you're really lucky. A Marine Radio is my best friend, because of the constant weather reports that are updated hourly. I camp on the Winnipeg River system, just love roughing it, hate being in the cabin anyway, too noisy, miss only the flush toilet! So, being in the boat all day and returning back to my camp in the dark is the way I spend the majority of my days. I will go back to camp to grill a steak and fry a walleye filet before it gets dark, and cast some of the bays until after dark once in a while. Besides, my boat sits on a trailer most of the year and needs the exercise, while I sit in the boat and gain 5 to ten pounds!"
1432563,wallydave,2012-05-08 12:31:00,2151,"Early spring in Ontario will bring changing weather patterns, plan on it!! Layers, not a lot of cotton, fleece, heavy duty rain gear and boots are a must! A nice selection of hats too, ones for rain, for sun and heat, bring along a stocking cap just to keep warm, just in case. In an average week expect 2-3 rainy cloudy cool days, 2-3 warm sunny days, and a couple cool windy days. That being said, last year early June on the NW end of Lac Seul we had warm windy days, cold cloudy windy day, and a couple of days when the Lac was flat and still, we have never seen it like that before! In a word be prepared for nearly anything!! Part of fishing up North is overcoming the elements and facing the challenges!!"
1432775,Fishin Fun,2012-05-08 19:34:00,218,Actually I've been in a boat where the waves pounded so hard it broke the seats and the gas tanks were floating in the back of the boat. I must admit that sucked. But now I have a much larger boat that I feel much safer in. I've had some of the best fishing in a heavy downpour. Although I'd rather fish in the sun!
1431278,lassh,2012-05-05 23:39:00,553,"Maybe its just me, but I have never been shut out of fishing in Canada in 34 years of flyin finhing. I have been delayed from flying out for 2 days extra with no gas in camp, sleet, snow, wind etc. but never shut out for a day and do not look forward to being in the cabin. I love being on the lake and that is why I go. IMO if I wanted to hang out in the cabin we could meet near where we live and play cards or BS. Don't take me wrong, the camaraderie is way more important now than it was years ago, but the fishing is still the primary activity. Have a great trip this year!"
1431334,WalleyeWally28,2012-05-06 07:16:00,298,"My wife and I go to Canada with the intent of spending 10 to 11 hours aday on the water. We enjoy moving around trying to find that next ""honey hole"" while watching for wildlife and looking at the beautiful Canadian scenery. We hate having to waste any of our fishing time sitting in the cabin waiting for the weather to break."
1431403,@Lunker,2012-05-06 09:31:00,835,Wind or lightning are the only things that keep me off the water.
1431434,GWC,2012-05-06 11:05:00,1021,We've gone to Canada (Gull Rock) in June & late September the last couple of years. We go to fish rather than to sit in a cabin and Thunder storms are about the only reason we would stay off of the lake. We've seen some rough water and that seems to bring the big northerns out to feed. Just slow down & use good judgement when handling the boat and if you feel uncomfortable on the lake due to rough water/weather then it's time to head back in or to find a protected area. Staying out beyond your ability can get you into serious trouble in Canada or the U.S.
1431466,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-05-06 12:57:00,27,"playing cards and having some beers in the cabin with the boys is fun dont get me wrong, but with that being said, we dont pay all that money and drive that far to sit in the cabin, we can do that at home. we fish from the time we get up until it is dark, thats the way we like it, we are up there to fish. It always kills us that most of the time we have noticed almost everybody else in camp is back in by evening, or dinner time, they miss some of the best fishing every day! It does kind of suck not eating untill about midnight after cleaning fish but that is the price you pay!"
1431609,Fishin Fun,2012-05-06 19:08:00,218,"Fishing for sure. No matter what the weather. Although when the weather is crappy, we've forgotten about the boat and fished off the dock at the resort and slayed them. So it doesn't matter to me if we get a day or two of crummy weather."
1431791,erieangler,2012-05-07 08:10:00,57,"Just let me have a solid week of a stable weather pattern, lord hear my prayer. So long as its not a big blow. 50 to 60* w/ overcast and the occasional sprinle would be fine by me"
1431886,tv4fish,2012-05-07 10:57:00,2694,"Obviously, you haven't been caught out in one of Canada's good old heavy thunderstorms. We've been ""chased"" off the water a couple of times by them. We pay close attention to the weather forecast and ALWAYS keep an eye out for storms. We have been caught before out on the lake when we have seen wide and WHITE lightning. NOT fun."
1431903,Medds1,2012-05-07 11:26:00,18,"My boat can say we are survivors of a lightning strike. We were flying across the lake, as fast as a 9.9 would fly. And all of a sudden the fish finder went crazy with fish so we stopped and tried to catch something. Sun was out beautiful day on the lake, or so we thought. Then my Dad asked what we did to his jig this time, the day before we tied a floater on when he was busy doing something else. I looked at my buddy in the front of the boat and we both kind of laughed and said, nothing why. My jig is floating again. We looked and sure enough the jig was at the surface, but it was because the line was a big arch and glowing green. There was so much static in the air in front of the storm that his line was being pulled up. He picked up his rod to real his line in and the graphite started to crackle. Needless to say we reeled our lines in as fast as we could and headed for shore only to find a sand bar about 100 yards away from shore. We finally got pushed off of that and made it to shore just before the hail and lightning started. There was so much hail it bottomed out our boat and water was rushing over the sides to fill it up. Just as we noticed that the boat was sunk, the bolt hit us like Mike Tyson times 1000. I have never felt such pain. We were all knocked to the ground and I was unable to move my legs for about a half hour. The feeling and movement finally started to come back. We finally got our composure and bailed the boat out enough to head back to the landing. By the time we got there it was sunny and a great day for fishing. I chose to sit on the deck and drink a case of beer like I have never done before. Canadian weather will turn on you just when you get comfortable with it, be careful with one eye to the sky!"
1431904,Bill Krejca,2012-05-07 11:26:00,6107,"I do have to admit that a few years ago, we were pretty much forced to come in in late morning due to rain/wind. That day, it rained 7 inches, and although we had good rain gear, we all got soaked. Many years ago, due to weather, we couldn't navigate a channel heading home from a stay out on the lake. The night before, the wind blew so hard that the water drained out of the LOW Turtle Portage channel, and we were forced to wait a day until the water level normalized. Honest. Bill"
1431003,camp chef,2012-05-05 09:26:00,915,"Given the choice, would you prefer a week of perfect fishing weather or do you enjoy a day or partial day when the weather keeps you in the cabin for a day of cards,naps or cocktails?"
1431012,Guk,2012-05-05 09:54:00,39,"Some times we will get a few drops of rain and somebodys hollering ""Rain Day"" meaning we take a session off of fishing...it's been known to happen on an 80 degree day with blue bird skies and no threat or even a drizzle within a 100 miles!"
1431022,Limeyangler,2012-05-05 10:57:00,563,"if i was withing a mile of a boat and rod, with the time to get in it and fish, regardless of the weather, cards and napping would not be my priority."
1431026,stjoeguy,2012-05-05 11:13:00,979,"Our fishing is laid back. There might be a quick nap after lunch, but it takes some foul weather to keep us off the lake. I don't recall ever being off the lake for a complete day while in Canada."
1431036,Bigstorm,2012-05-05 11:30:00,799,"We have yet to be kept off of the lake for any reason when up there. Although, when waking up at 7AM and it is pouring rain and I still feel a little tipsy from the night before, I dont mind sleeping for another hour or so."
1431067,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-05 13:34:00,235,"We do a 4 day fly in in July or August, and we tend to want maximize time on the water. Other than a storm blowing through for an hour or two, I can't think of a time we ever had to stay in for a day."
1431068,The Canuck,2012-05-05 13:37:00,67,Some of the best fishing is in drizzly or rainy weather.
1431134,Crede,2012-05-05 16:51:00,134,The only thing that keeps us off the water is wind - the kind of wind that makes it dangerous/stupid to be out there and we are unable to safely get to someplace out of the wind. Has only happened twice in the last 10 years - and each of those days things calmed down enough in the evening to get out for a few hours. 11 years ago we had one of those days and went out into it anyways. On the way back to camp I promised my maker that if we made it back OK I would never do that again. Both of the times we haven't gone out a lot of extra sleeping was accomplished and no one has ever complained or said that the trip was in any way diminished because of those days.
1431139,octanehi5,2012-05-05 17:10:00,1104,"I rather have cloudy days and some rain, good thunderstorm realy kicks in the bite. blue bird skys are for the beach not fishing. You need a nice walleye chop on the lake wind out of the south west, water temp 64 degrees. If you head for the barn in the rain you will miss some of the best fishing of your life. Fishing just before the front moves in and during, the next day wally will be deeper"
1431140,fishinnut 3446,2012-05-05 17:11:00,638,"Yes if I had a choice I would pick for 1 nice week,but that has not happened in the 8-9 years so far,always rains 1-2 days maybe more,but thets why we have rain gear,I have to admitt I do sleep in 1 day,thats the Sun.after we get back"
