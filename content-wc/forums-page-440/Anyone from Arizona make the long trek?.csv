1431657,Guest,2012-05-06 20:34:00,0,"I actually got back from the lodge opening last night. I love this time of year! Anyway, I found the best option is on Allegiant Air and fly into Grand Forks or Duluth in order to get to Manitoba or NW Ontario.If anyone wants anymore info please feel free to contact me [email protected]"
1429589,skindzier,2012-05-02 07:20:00,137,We drive from Denver every year (with a boat). With one overnight it isn't bad. I actually enjoy the drive too.
1429600,tv4fish,2012-05-02 07:40:00,2694,"All I can say is that I REALLY commend you guys from the southern states that make that long drive up to Canada. Those of us that live in the ""northern"" states certainly have nothing to complain about when it comes to our shorter drive. I sure hope the resorts that you guys stay at appreciate your efforts/business."
1429605,elway12,2012-05-02 07:44:00,335,From AZ to Ignace it would be over a 2000 mile one way trip. Probably take 2 days unless you drive straight thru but then what type of shape are you in when you get there? I.M.O the best way to get there from AZ is to fly. It would be even better to fly directly to I.F. or Duluth but the prices of the flights to those small airports is VERY expensive. That's why my group fly's and drives - seems to be the least expensive of a pricey trip no matter how you go.
1429613,rnnonmt,2012-05-02 07:57:00,992,"Elway: Usually we fly Delta from PHX to MSP then take a puddle jumper flight to I-Falls. Its about $300-ish to get to MSP (3hrs) and another $200-ish from MSP to I-Falls (50 mins). Then we rent a car and drive the 3.5-4 hrs to Sioux Lookout. Total cost for my son and I to go each year on a 7 day trip is usually around $3200. Thats everything Travel, shipping our gear/paying for carry-ons, hotel, rental car, groceries, bait, license, cabin/houseboat etc etc"
1429624,Larry S,2012-05-02 08:17:00,665,"It still costs a lot to drive from Nevada to Ontario. I do it in 2 1/2 days stopping overnite twice.Gas costs are in the area of $275 each way,plus $130 for 2 nights at motels each way.I could fly for about the same price to Minneapolis and rent a car,but for me I drive into Chicago & Wisconsin to visit family and spend a month on the trip When I lived in Chicago I would take my boat up to a close friends resort 20 miles north of Kenora every year and leave the boat in Canada for the summer .Then when we went on a fly-in the boat would be up in Canada to use after the trip for a week. Larry S"
1429638,Knoxabilly,2012-05-02 08:46:00,225,"A few years ago I lived in Phoenix, I still made the trek to Canada. I would fly into Des Moines where I'm from and then would ride up with my regular group. Added a lot of cost to an inexpensive trip but was definitely worth it!"
1429737,elway12,2012-05-02 11:57:00,335,"We (3 people) split the cost of rental van, food, gas, hotel etc. Our trips cost pp max about $1750 total. I have found that renting a car/van from the smaller airports is many times almost double the cost, plus flying to those places doesn't save very much time away from work(also because of the times of the connnecting flights), still have to rent a van/car, and more bag restrictions + fees plus still have a hotel stay. That being said it would be GREAT if I had/won extra money just to fly directly to there or even to Thunder Bay, Winnepeg, Sioux Lookout or Dryden Though the drive from Duluth to Canada is very scenic and something I look forward to as part of our trips up north."
1429946,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-05-02 20:08:00,235,"Dude, if you drive from AZ to Ontario to catch a fish, you are hardcore. My hats off to you."
1430306,MorganMan,2012-05-03 16:01:00,341,We have a first timer this year from the Phoenix area coming. He is flying into Minneapolis and will ride with us the rest of the way. I am the furthest North and am VERY thankful to be the first home on our way back!
1431585,bigdaddy66,2012-05-06 18:29:00,7,My brother is flying into Minneapolis and going up with us for the first time. He has been telling me that he is hitting Bass Pro Shop to get supplies. I have a feeling that it may become a tradition for him also once he gets there the first time.
1429430,rnnonmt,2012-05-01 18:47:00,992,"Wondering if anyone else from Arizona or the southwest makes the trek year after year back to Lac Seul or NW Ontario fishing grounds? Curious if you drive or fly, where you fly into, rent a vehicle, trailer your boat etc.Every year as the airline prices go up I've been thinking that if I am going to pay that kind of money I might as well drive and trailer my boat. Plus the fact that I keep hearing about the smaller airport hubs that are on the list of potentially being shutdown. I can't seem to get the wife to agree to letting me drive by myself. She just doesn't understand the whole macho thing about a man and his machine. I don't have another person to share the driving with so I understand her point of view that it would be a LONG drive up there. Thoughts/comments? Pro's and Cons? My ears are open......"
1429439,phishfearme,2012-05-01 19:04:00,1242,i think you'll hear from larry s who lives in henderson nevada and is a regular on our trips to NW ontario. take a look at our kearns lake report from last year (search: kearns lake) and you'll see how well he juggles walleye!!! he drives the long distance (the rest of us drive from SW PA and we always do 10 day trips so it makes the longer drive more worthwhile. phish
1429441,Rich B,2012-05-01 19:10:00,1081,"I hear you about the long drive.....I have a buddy or two from Eastern Ohio that will join me on some of my drives to north of Int'l Falls and we go up to Cedar Lake (Perrault area), for about a 24 hour drive (one-way) and pull a boat.... On other occasions when I'm by myself, I'll fly to my brother's home in Milwaukee and we'll drive up together and pull up his rig. I don't know how old you are, and how much time you would have to drive up and back....if you're in good health, and don't have to push to get up and back; then going by yourself (with a good cell phone and AAA) wouldn't be bad (at least not for me - I enjoy a good drive). Do you have any friends that could pick you up at a Chicago, Milwaukee or Twin City's airport, and you go into camp with them ? Our group heads up for the opener in just a few weeks, so we're counting down the days.....and as Phish noted, we also go into camp for a long week. Best wishes on your travels....no matter how you head north....to ""God's Country"" ! Rich B"
1429446,rnnonmt,2012-05-01 19:32:00,992,"Thanks guys. Each year the group (family) I go with is diminishing in numbers and the cost keeps rising. Some of them are retiring or already retired. None of them are interested in driving.I swore up and down last year that no matter what.... if I could still afford to go, my son and I would return. Each year just seems to get a little harder to coordinate. Besides my son I am the youngest one at 39 and usually the one trying to put everything together. This year I am going with part of the family that I married into because I couldnt get enough of my family in Arizona to commit. My in-laws (really good folk) live in Rochester MN so I am flying to MSP with my older boy and driving/riding in with them. I'm in good health, could definately take two weeks or more from my job if needed and I know I could make the drive I just can't seem to convince the wife. LOL"
1429452,rnnonmt,2012-05-01 19:39:00,992,Nice report on Kearns lake and even nicer fish-Phish !
1429463,Larry S,2012-05-01 19:58:00,665,"Rnnomt I live in Henderson,Nevada since 1998. Have gone once or twice a year by variousmethods of Transportation to Canada. I've been semi-retired since 2011. Prior to 2011 I would either fly to Chicago, meet friends there,and drive with them to Ontario. Or take the vacation time and drive to Chicago,then go to Ontario.By driving I can visit my sister in wisconsin and other relatives in Ill & Wis. Being semi-retired now I can take my time & also take more fishing gear to do a side fishing trip before we go on a fly-in with my friends from Pittsburgh(phishfearme). The guys from Pittsburgh usually fly to Minneapolis,while one of their group will drive with all their gear & food.We meet in Mpls We also do 10 day trips on our fly-ins. This year from June 26th to July 6th As Phish said I'm a good juggler of walleye,his picture proves it.I've also been a good luck partner for him,as he has caught his largest walleye 29 1/2 inches ,and pike 41 inches with me in the boat as his partner Rich if you have the time & money taking your own boat is a good thing for fishing Lac Seul. Many of the lodges do have great boats,but you know your own boat and its great to use your own gear. Rnnomt have a good time any time in canada puts years on your life. Larry S"
1429513,elway12,2012-05-01 21:53:00,335,"I live in Chandler, AZ. I have made the trip up to NW Ontario 4 times over the last couple of years. You are correct that the travel is a total pain and $$. BUT well worth the effort to get to God's country! We have never driven and never will since it just would take too long to drive and then fish and miss too much time off of work. Our regular trip involves flying to MSP. We try to take Southwest Airlines since they don't charge for bags. Sun Country used to have some good deals but never used them and can't remember if they are still in business? Once we go into MSP we rent a van, drive 2.5 hours to Duluth spend the night then make the 8.5 hour drive into the fishing resort. On the way back we drive straight thru to the airport! My group includes me, my Dad, and my brother. I am pretty frugal and try my best to get the best airfare locked in early and look for deals on the rental van or SUV. Of course gas prices have added extra $$ the last few years. PM me if you would like more info. Maybe we can make a trip up together sometime."
1429534,reefrnr,2012-05-02 04:27:00,7,i make the trip from washington state...its a really nice drive takes about 26 hrs to kenora but well worth it..a **** of alot cheaper than flying
1429539,F250,2012-05-02 05:07:00,75,We drive to LOW from Vermont - 1500 miles. We spend one night in a motel about half way there. Two pickup trucks each towing a boat.
1429544,Golden Eagle,2012-05-02 05:31:00,2642,"1465 miles, one way for me to Red Lake, Ontario. I make it 2-4 times a year and usually go solo for my October trip. I go in when there's a seat for me on a float plane and come out when I'm ready. Drove up only 3 times in 2011, but spent 35 days on the water. August trip to Kenora was a bit shorter."
