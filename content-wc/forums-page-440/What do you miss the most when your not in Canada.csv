1429719,LOW1,2012-05-02 11:17:00,2828,Labs covered a lot. I'll add kayaking around the islands near us and cooking pancakes on the deck in the morning. And I miss the sound of the water at night and seeing humongous snapping turtles.

1431467,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-05-06 13:04:00,27,not a **** thing!
1428942,Jiggin the Point,2012-04-30 20:20:00,24,That fresh pine air smell....nothing mends my soul like those first lung fulls
1428995,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-30 21:46:00,235,It's pretty much escapism.
1429239,XtreemLee,2012-05-01 11:28:00,60,Poutine
1429250,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-01 11:57:00,725,Can't you have poutine pretty much anywhere?
1429294,octanehi5,2012-05-01 13:38:00,1104,he hooks no you can not even if they have it in the states its not the same
1429298,XtreemLee,2012-05-01 13:46:00,60,There is a tavern in Milwaukee callled the Red Dot they serve a pretty good poutine. In Canadia you can get poutine anywhere...
1429303,camp chef,2012-05-01 13:59:00,915,double fried potatoes....fresh cheesecurds and your choice of gravy. It is hard to screw up if you use good quality ingredients.( I like mushroom gravy )
1429372,Canuck_in_NC,2012-05-01 17:00:00,17,Can't believe no one has said Tim Hortons coffee LOL
1429437,rnnonmt,2012-05-01 18:58:00,992,What I miss the most: the quality time with my older 12 year old son. Just him and I together fishing with the biggest a$$ grins on our faces. In a couple more years my younger son will hopefully be joining us. Then the 3 of us will have big a$$ grins. What I dont miss the most: Having to explain to my wife where my son got his new vocabulary.
1429697,labsrus,2012-05-02 10:40:00,557,"Great Post A lot of the posts bring up good memories. I have been going to the same lake since 1976, a long time. Lot of great memories of fishing with family and friends. What do I miss most? Getting up in the morning and walking down to the dock with a cup of coffee to go fishing. Getting out with the family to fish Working around camp Cutting wood Cleaning fish Drinking good beer Eating good fish fries Seeing the loons and hearing them in the evening. Telling good stories Bragging rights Sitting on the dock enjoying the view Watching the kids boat and swim Making crawler harnesses based on what color was working that morning. Drinking Good Beer - I know that is a repeat Going fishing with my sons Going fishing with my wife We usually take one morning and my buddy from high school and myslef go out fishing by ourselves. We usually catch a bunch of fish and have a great time."
1427528,115 optimax,2012-04-28 00:02:00,650,You guys sure help remind me on how lucky i got it up here.
1427613,Kevin R,2012-04-28 07:48:00,305,Nice pike how big was it ? Clean Air not much changes in the way of new construction. The town I grew up in had lots of farms now has lots of factory's & high rises.
1427708,Fish_Heads,2012-04-28 11:52:00,154,"46 1/2"" right at 25 lbs. Biggest freshwater fish ever (except carp which don't count) for me."
1428258,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-29 18:47:00,235,What time of year on the monster pike?
1428279,octanehi5,2012-04-29 19:33:00,1104,"the best time for pike is before the water gets above 65 they will be in the shallows, after that you just have to fish a little deeper.I have caught pike over 40"" the last day in june"
1428363,elway12,2012-04-29 22:34:00,335,"What an AWESOME thread! The sound of the loons, the clean fresh air, the first nibble and hook set of a walleye, the possibility of seeing bears, moose, caribou etc., the taste of some fresh fish caught just hours earlier, the pure power of a laker pulling your line from 50ft down! So sad I can't make a trip up this summer....NEXT year!"
1428375,Fish_Heads,2012-04-30 04:40:00,154,"July 5th actually......... in a small (6' wide max) creek channel opening into the main river. Had lots of weeds, was actually casting for smallies & got him with the light action rod on 8# test. Definitely was not expecting it. We were in an area where we had caught bass before & I was trying for them. Just happened to put on a Williams spoon that was in the top tray of the tackle box.Very overcast misty rainy kinda day with a light wind.Fish"
1428698,erieangler,2012-04-30 13:06:00,57,"I feel for you Elway12. Don't know how I would handle missin a yearly trip to Canada. From the anticpation of seeing my buddies coming down the road to load me up for that 14 hour drive, to that 1st fish, beer,shore lunch,loon call, right up to the morning we pack it up for our return to reallity. An entire week of play,play,play is what I miss"
1428779,Rivratz,2012-04-30 15:17:00,105,"I miss being in Canada fishing and camping, you silly Loon..."
1428929,Pooch,2012-04-30 20:04:00,4619,Even after spending thirty plus days on the water in Canada each year I still pain when that last day of the season finally comes. From that moment until the next seasons trip I think of Canada and old friends whom I've shared a boat with over the years. Several who we will never get the chance to tease and joke with again.When north of the border few things south of the border even exist for the length of that trip.It's soul cleansing and I think most return home a little better person.Pooch

1427343,wobbie19,2012-04-27 14:00:00,71,"I miss the fact that my cell phone doesn't work, and that by the end of the week I have forgotten about the phone, work, and the normal schedule of everyday life.All that matters is where we are going to fish in the morning!"
1427346,octanehi5,2012-04-27 14:09:00,1104,"Very good guys not bad for a post thats only three hours old,keep it going.I miss it already"
1427397,bigwalleye1,2012-04-27 16:29:00,2632,"I miss that jiggly feeling I get after I make it thru customs going in without a hitch. The way the air smells going thru Fort Frances. It's the first indication that ""We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto"". The wilderness on the 502, and the wildlife. The ""pulp check"" areas to drop off the morning's coffee. That first look at camp when we pull in, "" Yep, still here, just like we left it"". Kind of reminds me of Cheers, or those kinds of shows that give us a peek into an alternate world for a little bit. You know life is still going on there while you're at home, but it's nice to go and check in again, just to be sure. I miss coffee and donuts in the morning, the last minute scramble to unload, hit the water and get the day started. I miss the old sailor's tradition facing the bow and tossing a few coins over the shoulder, over the stern, as payment for safe passage on the water, I miss baptizing a brand new rod. I miss kissing that first walleye and lettin' er go, regardless of size. I miss jigging for walleyes. I miss the eagles, the loons, the deer, moose and bear swimming in the water (yup, I HAVE seen 'em all). I miss shore lunch, the sizzle of the hot grease, the bubble of the beans, sitting on a rock in the middle of nowhere with some of my best friends in the world, watching the world turn, considering how unimportant we really all are in the grand scheme, and wondering what the poor folks are doing back home, because to be there, brothers, regardless of income, we truly are rich.... How's that, and I'm only just getting to lunch! Makes me smile just thinkin' about it. Hope it does the same for all of you."

1427461,ohiojmj,2012-04-27 19:44:00,1262,"Fishing each of days days in a row for as long as I can stand up. Peace, solitude, relaxation, Jim Beam, good friends, the fishing stories, lots of fried fish, pike, Canadian beer, the fresh pine scent in the air, the fish bite att dusk, the challenge of finding the fish and figuring what they will bite, shore lunches, brewing coffee during a troll,an occasional smoke, Crown Royal, the chat with others at the camp, the friendly camps owner, good sleep, cool nights, the buzz of the box fan, smallmouth, walleye, tossing a 42"" pike back in the lake, sundown, sun rise, bacon and eggs, and the best for me: watching my boys being thrilled by catching some awesome fish or just a quantity of any size. I could go on for hours...."
1427483,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-27 20:24:00,235,The first hook set. And every hook set thereafter. Also seeing folks I only get to see once per year.

Mishaps that turn into great times...........Still having the camp record for the largest pike ever brought in the lodge......... (caught in 2009 by accident on a light action rig trying for smallmouth)toms pike todds pic.jpgSeeing this in the morning .....whitefish sunrise.jpg......looking straight out to heaven !
1427527,115 optimax,2012-04-27 23:52:00,650,That made me chuckle!Soooooo true though.
1427263,octanehi5,2012-04-27 11:21:00,1104,"I'll start with the clean air, The first thing you smell is a fresh perked coffee,and slab bacon frying.First and last things you hear ,Loons calling each other,no phones tv or radio. The quality and quantity of the fishing.The fresh beer battered peanut oil fried walleye every day.The beer just tastes better up there. Good cigars at night while watching the sky for satilites from the bond fire.The friends you are with and those experiances you will never forget. Relaxsation, Tell me what you think"
1427269,camp chef,2012-04-27 11:33:00,915,"I miss the fact that time is no longer important. Eat, sleep,drink,fish at your convenience and in no particular order."
1427276,Bigstorm,2012-04-27 11:59:00,799,I miss having a realistic shot at catching a walleye on each cast
1427294,Lovetofish,2012-04-27 12:40:00,458,I love it when it cools off at night. I'll have the window open with a good blanket and pillow and I sleep like a baby. Then we come home to heat and humidity.
1427295,Bill Krejca,2012-04-27 12:41:00,6107,"Besides all the nature aspects, which I hardily embrace, I miss the novelty of getting to think of how to best approach the honey hole, which bait to try next, where will the wind be blowing into at the next spot, sitting in an absolute downpour and enjoying it - along with a cold wind/sleet and still enjoying it. There is a certain ""mind cleansing"", an almost reincarnation, which takes place in this holy place, where the cares of normalhood are stripped aside, and the mindset is truly reset. Can't beat it for the world. Bill Krejca"
1427313,Iowa Farm Boy,2012-04-27 13:13:00,44,I miss the good beer!
1427315,keek,2012-04-27 13:15:00,1003,"I miss being surrounded by good people who think about fishing as much as I do. I also miss the ""cabin"" noises that come from squeaky floors, slamming screen doors and the like. I miss the talk at the fish cleaning house."
1427316,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-27 13:15:00,725,"Biggest decision in Canada is ""You want to fish over there or over there?"""
1427317,wallydave,2012-04-27 13:20:00,2151,"The things I miss the most about not being up North, the quiet of the early morning, nothing but the sound of waves, wind, and loons. The sound of bacon sizzling, coffee dripping and the float planes in the distance. Nothing like the sound of the bow cutting through the still waters as you head out for a day of walleye fishing. The cool wind washing over you as you head for that special spot full of hungry walleye! The jolt of adreniline when you feel that tap on the end of your line, the sound of the reel as your lunch fights to stay in the water! The thrill of the fight, the expectation as the fish gets closer to the surface. A feeling of being an advocate for the future of fishing when you release that fish you have driven so many miles to catch. The fun of telling stories in the fish house, the first beer as the oil starts to heat up, followed by the sound of frying the days catch! The complete and total sense of being one with nature looking out on a setting sun, a good Canadian beer in one hand, and a good cigar in the other!! That what I miss about Not being up North!"
