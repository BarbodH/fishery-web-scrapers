1432865,Guest,2012-05-09 05:55:00,0,Have gone to the Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources website to purchase an outdoor card and each time I try by using the choice that I am a non-resident and placing my information including my zipcode I get the following message: Inquiry Transaction Error 0742 Denied Postal Code is Different. Is there anything else I need to do to get this card?
1432871,birddogger,2012-05-09 06:16:00,43,"Make sure non-resident box is checked and only use 5 digit zip code, not the dashed extended one. Good luck."
1432884,Sidge61,2012-05-09 06:40:00,59,Did both of those and still no luck. Tried calling the 800 number and all I get is a busy signal.
1433058,Jig Man,2012-05-09 10:03:00,95,Are you renewing an existing card? If so has there been an address change? I renewed mine a few weeks back and had problems when I enterd my address but my exisisting card was registered to my old address. Not the most yser friendly site I will give you that.
1433079,Steve Ediger,2012-05-09 10:30:00,97,I had the same type of problem last week. I was renewing three outdoor cards for my family members. When doing my son's I got the error message regarding his birthdate. I looked on his old card and somehow the birthdate on the old card was wrong. I simply changed the birthdate on the application to match the wrong date on the old card and it worked fine.

1433257,Sidge61,2012-05-09 16:26:00,59,This is for a new card so they have none of her information on file. Also tried calling the 800 through out the day and still was busy. Also tried sending an email to them and have not received a response yet.

1433412,teddi,2012-05-10 04:43:00,349,the welcome center is closed and will not be open this year.

Then I looked at my card carefully and saw they had me born in 1956, not 1966. I couldn't figure out any way to fix it, so I simply logged back in with the 1956 date and everything worked fine. Good luck, Bill"
