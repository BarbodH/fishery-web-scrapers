Also I'm leaving for DogTooth the 29th of May and I would like to fish for some crappies so coud any one give me a little informatin on where to find them on DogTooth? The lake is so large it's hard to find them! Thanks!

There is little appendage lake called ""Crappie Lake"", if the water isn't to low you can get there by boat. Loaded with Crappies..... It's between Mud bay and little dogtooh lake."
