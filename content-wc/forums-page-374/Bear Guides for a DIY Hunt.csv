Basically sign off for a hundred or two bucks and let me go run wild? Is that legal to do? Looking to hunt within 2-3 hours of the MN border. I'm planning a fishing/camping trip this fall, and if I can get a little bear hunting done it would be icing on the cake"

You will be required to hunt within their bear management area so make sure they give you a map. If you would happen to get out of their area, it is just like hunting without a license. I do not know any outfitters that do that, but maybe someone on here can help with a name."
1872938,Hillbiehle,2013-06-17 09:48:00,66,Call Paul or Cheryl at Discovery Lake Lodge; they can answer your questions. Check their website for recent pics of bear hunting.
1882905,Guest,2013-06-20 08:17:00,0,I would also contact Timber Edge Camps near Sioux Lookout. They do guided hunts but can probably answer your questions. Tell them Sam sent you. They are generally booked up long in advance. I believe everyone that has hunted with them has at least got one shot at a bear.
