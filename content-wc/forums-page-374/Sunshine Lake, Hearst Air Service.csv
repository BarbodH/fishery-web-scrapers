Very small (roughly a mile in diameter) and not particularly deep. Lake is fairly weedy in most spots. Walleye fishing will be solid, not great and no great size......lots of 14 to 16 inch fish. What makes the lake interesting is the size of the Pike that are in this relatively small lake. My buddy and his son each caught 40 inch Northerns. We caught multiple Northern in the 32 to 36 inch range and they are everywhere in the lake. We had another Northern that I am sure was 40+ hit one of our walleye at the Boat and held on for several seconds, but let go when he saw our net. It is not a hammer handle lake....you will catch bigger Northerns generally. Accommodations are nice. Very cool big rock right down at dock for kids to hang out on and catch crayfish and leeches. You will enjoy...especially if your son is on the younger side."

Lots of walleye and a surprising number of larger than average pike.Normally I would fish a larger body of water, but I think it's a perfect choice for a 7 year old.Cheers"
