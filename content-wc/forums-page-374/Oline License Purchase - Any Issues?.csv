The page would say that it is Forbidden to view and give an error code of 403I called the number at the bottom of the previous page and the woman I spoke with said it was an issue on my computer and that it didnt like the encryption software that they use. She was able to verify that the purchase did go thru and luckily for me, my trip isnt until 7/20/13 so she is mailing me the license.Not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but if you plan on purchasing your license online, I would do it far in advance just in case this happens to you."
1883513,Rodney Bondele,2013-06-20 11:35:00,73,Mine worked fine a few weeks ago. I believe they wanted you to try a test print befor purchasing but my memory could be wrong. Glad they worked it out for you.Rod
1883601,Babamel2,2013-06-20 11:54:00,414,"They will send you a PDF file. make sure you have copies of it. Last year the DNR checked us. My friend could not find his printed copy. It would have been good if he had kept a back up copy on his computer to print it later. However, the DNR was good was willing to look for him on their database later and let us go. That guy went out of his way, legally he could have ticketed my friend."
1884873,Tonyo,2013-06-20 19:24:00,212,I have purchased mine on their website the last couple of years and have had no troubles. It sure beats the line at Four Season's Sport Shop in Ear Falls. Good luck. TonyO
1885169,reconssd,2013-06-20 21:07:00,147,Worked fine. Actually it could not have been easier.
1885681,Bill Krejca,2013-06-21 07:23:00,6107,"Worked fine last year. This year, although I printed a test copy, I was unable to print the real one. Ended up contacting by phone, was mailed a yellow ""duplicate."" As stated, it would be wise to get an early start in procuring your license. Bill"
1885697,Fishin Fun,2013-06-21 07:33:00,218,"I had an issue with it last year, but this year it worked just fine. I definitely like the option of purchasing it online."
1885905,jimmie,2013-06-21 08:51:00,123,Forgot to print page two last year so had to buy a dup ($15) in Sioux Lookout. This year only one page and if you do the test printing it all seems to work fine. Have fun and be safe on the water. Jimmie
