1857585,smithcr,2013-06-11 16:29:00,4,I am going up to Lake Echouani / Pavillion Richer walleye fishing for 6 days over this weekend. Has anybody been up or heard any reports? Hows Clova Road?

I travel it about every 3 or 4 years traveling to Stramond lake lodge. Fishing was slow for us. Water temp around 58 degrees. Let me know how u do. Good luck, mike"

There are 10 of us that have been going to Echouani the last 6 years and this was by far the best year for numbers of fish. No real big fish, nothing over 26"" but a lot of fish in the slot. We don't fish for Pike but caught quite a few over 30"" in with the Walleye. The last 40 miles of Clova Road sucked as usual. Pavillion Richer is under new ownership. They seem to be very nice people also. Will do anything to help you out. Great trip and we will be back same time next year."
