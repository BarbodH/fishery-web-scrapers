Walleye were still spawning ,both males and females . By the last 3 days we saw no sign of spawning. Caught plenty of walleye but not the big numbers we are use to. I did catch one 28 inches. Caught most in 12 ft of water right at shore with Husky Jerks. When we got in deeper or shallower water we did not catch them . To my surprise i did not do to well with live minnows on a jig.The lake was out of its backs and at least 6 ft higher than when I was at same lake last August.Fish seemed very scattered .........Caught 5 trophy pike ,the largest 44 1/2 inches and all released . One of our better trips for big fish but not numbers. Of the fish I cleaned to eat only one had anything in its belly ,which was two very small minnows...........Bugs were not bad but got worse towards the end of our stay."
1813538,back357,2013-05-28 08:52:00,106,"I've read a fair amount of analysis surrounding how to fish before, during, and after the walleye spawn, but honestly, it confuses me more than anything. Here is what I perceive to be the case: Pre-spawn/spawn - Mostly males in shallows, females come into the shallows towards the end of the day, but go back to the deep during the day. Post spawn - no activity aside from males hanging around the spawning area. Females go deep and rest for a period of time. Post Post spawn - feeding frenzy occurs, but then walleyes move deep for the summer. So, if I figure that where I am going, the spawn happened on 5/18 - 5/19, I am trying to figure out what I am going to be facing on 6/16 - 6/22. I don't know how long spawn takes, then post spawn, and finally, the duration of the feeding frenzy and when they will start to go deep. If anyone could give me some sort of idea, I would really appreciate it. At least it will give me a direction as to where to start. I fish one shallow lake, but the rest are pretty deep. Thanks."
1813674,Aaron-IN,2013-05-28 09:35:00,500,"As for what you will be facing on 6/16, it depends on the weather between the spawn and 6/16. I would guess the walleye would be in early summer pattern at that point."
1813858,octanehi5,2013-05-28 10:32:00,1104,"what walleyes are doing depends on the water temps,wind and amount of light.This spring was a very cold one, My guess would be fish from 20' to shallower water. your post spawn will be over. and walleyes are going to due what walleye's do. best way to find them is to troll around with bottom bouncers to find them."
1814114,2746,2013-05-28 11:35:00,3206,"A couple of good answers already. We have fished on various weeks during the early part of the season and a number of opening weeks. It's always different but.....Once walleye spawn they begin the journey (usually along a shore line or other structure) heading to their summer locations. They remain shallow but go deeper as the water warms. Picture that process in your mind and, taking into account what the weather has been since spawn, you'll be able to figure it out. With normal temps the poster suggesting early summer locations at 15'-20' is likely correct. Colder temps may keep them more shallow.....warmer will drive them toward the 20-25'."
1814178,Bill Krejca,2013-05-28 11:54:00,6107,"Fished in Sask., shortly after spawn. The walleyes moved from bay toward deeper water away from the rather shallow narrowing creek configuration where they spawned. We found them in the first deep structure as the bay opened up. Bill"
1839409,back357,2013-06-05 09:31:00,106,"I appreciate all the insight. I'll be heading up to Ignace in 10 days. Should be an interesting week. Temps seem to be increasing and the water is high. May have to hunt a bit, but based on your comments, at least I know where to start. Good luck all."
1839873,Guest,2013-06-05 11:40:00,0,"I fished in that area a few times in June. Fish were moving more or less in a group out to the Main lake. They were caught in different areas progressing out to the main lake as the weeks went by. We trolled spinner rigs on the bottom with night crawlers and did really well. Green and orange blades with shiny backs were the # 1 choice in that area. But the fish were scattered in feeding locations say 10-20 feet deep depending on time of day and weather. But they also can be in different areas on different days and move back and forth. Finding all the major feeding areas then running to them all until you find out where they are that day was the key. Some times they are in the same spot all week. Camp manager at one place said the guys the week before fished the same spot all week, just one small bay. They were gone when we tried the spot. If there is not a main lake to move in to then they will be scattered around all the feeding spots, coming and going as they please. We were trolling one evening at a creek mouth catching many fish, and we started using gummy worms on one line and regular leeches and night crawlers on the other to see if the fish knew the difference. They never once bit a gummy worm behind a spinner just the leech or night crawler. I thought they would hit anything in the feeding frenzy but not the case. Next night not one bite there."
1839953,vteye,2013-06-05 12:13:00,812,"Our group flew into Kayedon last week and had water temps in high 30's upon arrival (back bays with ice, main lake shore ice) brilliant sun and no wind. We are novice group of walleye guys and bite was brutal first couple days. Hot sunny, dead calm weather had the lake into the low 50's by mid week. Does that mean we fished pre, spawn and post spawn all in a matter of days? Day 5 a front came through and heavy wind turned on the bite."
1841929,iman63,2013-06-06 02:34:00,91,"I would think you will find fish in a post spawn pattern. Look for dark water from 5 to 15 feet. The bigger females should be starting to feed again and warmer northern bays with dark water will be your hotspot. I'll be up the next week and expect to find the same pattern. Summer patterns are weeds for walleyes not ""deep"" water. Find weeds and some walleye chop and you will find summer walleyes."
1888617,roscoe33,2013-06-22 11:29:00,653,"This year the ice went out 3 weeks later than normal. Was just east of ignace a few weeks ago. One lake we were on was still iced over for the opener. Ice broke up on the 21st of May. Walleyes and northern were absolutely going crazy for 4 days, then they shut down and went into spawn mode. THey were hungry and prowling the shallows (6-7' ) for minnows and perch, but were spread out. Normal spring post spawn fishing picked up again about June 10th. I would guess you are in the thick of it as I type, with plenty of eyes being caught in the 7-15' depths."
