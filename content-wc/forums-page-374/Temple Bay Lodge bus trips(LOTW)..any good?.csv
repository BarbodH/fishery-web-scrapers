1162363,Guest,2010-01-22 15:44:00,0,TO confirm V-Gord's assertion. Still have nightmares of mid-50's fish hanging on to a 24 inch walleye near Deadman's reef. 4yrs ago. This was mid July. The Fall fishing is incredible. Check out the fishing reports and pictures at Andy Myers Lodge owned by Steve Herbick and you will see what I'm talking about.
1162456,Guest,2010-01-22 21:32:00,0,"Stayed at Temple Bay about 8 years ago. The fishing ok at best. the food was pretty good, the bar was the highlight of the trip. The bus trip was awful. If your looking to catch alot of fish Lac Suel,Tetu, or somewhere on the English river system is the place to go. For what you pay its not a bad deal, just don't expect great fishing."
1162575,2746,2010-01-23 11:19:00,3206,"Over the past 40 years we have fished Eagle, Lac Seul and Gullrock principaly. (some at nunguesser in the early years) All three are good and we've had slow days on each one (even slow weeks some years) but Eagle has really improved over the past 10-15 years, likely due to the slots and has the added benefit of providing a good shot at a Musky. While a bus trip, guided fishing and provided meals is not my cup of tea you should not be afraid of the fishing in Eagle. It can be very good! Also, as someone said, it's a huge lake with lots of Islands as well as twists and turns. Makes it fun to fish and explore but be sure to take a GPS if your going out on your own."
1193987,Guest,2010-04-27 13:54:00,0,"I stayed at Temple Bay last year. It is indeed a long bus ride but we stiopped twice - once for lunch and once to switch drivers it seems the first had a problem with a former DUI and could not travel into Canada). The bus itself is comfortable - but ride is a long ride unless you watch (movie) videos on the overhead screns. Our cabin (last week in May) reeked of mothballs and it took several days for the smell to end even with the widows open and the air conditioner set to fan and exhaust. By-the-way, there was nothing special about our cabin - just three beds, a bathroom, and a small table. Fishing was okay but not outstanding. I would agree you need a guide on the first couple of days to get oriented and ""put you on fish"". Then you need a reliable GPS to get you to these ""hot spots"" and back to the resort - it is a huge lake and all the islands, bays, inlets etc. look alike. It would be wise to have a lake map with GPS coordiantes. Becuase of its size, the lake can get ugly with wind and waves, rain and fog. And, yes, I would say it is run by Peg and Bob (and their son) like a business more than a resort atmosphere but not a military operation though - except for you had better be ready to leave well in advance of the departing time for the bus. I would add they have a variety of differient packages (and special pricing packages) and are willing to mix and match to some extent - I know we and a couple others who were there at the same time had ""customized"" packages. The food is good too and plenty of it. In summery, I am not entirely convinced that their slogan - Hospitality you can expect and not need to reques, is entirely accurate."
1221807,Cornbread,2010-07-23 10:05:00,2,"Folks- Having lots of experience fishing both Eagle and the English River System, I hope I can shed some light on the subject. I have fished canadian waters in ON for the past twenty years, beginning with Rainy initially and in the past 10 years both Eagle and English River (Separation, Lount, etc.) Done the drive up with your buddies, your own boats, own food, etc., done the fly ins, and the bus ride to Eagle, specifically Temple Bay. Regarding Temple Bay, I have found their operation top notch. I go every year with a bunch of my sales guys, some who have never fished before and who have no idea. Having a guide who will bait their hook, take off their fish, and keep us on the spot saves me no amount of headache and frustration were I to have to do it myself. Regarding the bus ride, it is long, but worth it. you just get on, pop in a movie, and you're up there in 7-8 hours from Mpls. Regarding the guided fishing, it is incredible. I have been in boats where we put 100+ walleyes in the boat in a day. Thats a good day. A bad day would be maybe 20, with probably an average of 40-60 fish a day. Regarding size, this past weekend one guy caught 2 30""s, I got a 29"", multiple 28, 27""s. Regarding northerns, LOTS of little ones 25-35 inches or so. As for muskies, I don't care who you are, Eagle has TONS of them. You may not catch them, but you'll see them, and they will scare you, no lie! My last encounter with an Eagle Lake musky was reeling in about a 15-16 inch walleye, nearly at the boat when all **** broke loose. A half hour later, drag finally done singing, she showed herself by the side of the boat, nice 4.5 footer. Here's the catch - we only had a walleye landing net. We just watched her by the side of the boat, wasn't even hooked, you could see my jig in the walleyes mouth, but all you could see was the walleyes lips and tail. She sat there for about 5 minutes, and finally let go. I knew it was big when I looked at our guide and he was shaking from the site. Regarding hospitality at Temple Bay, it is top notch. Bob and Peg will take care of you, the guides will put you on fish, and the dock staff literally runs down the dock to tie you up and get your fish cleaned for you. Preceed to the bar, and Libby will take care of you the rest of the evening. As for the English River System, that is a different kind of vibe. My dad has fished these waters for nearly 20 years, and taught me how to fish in current as I had always fished lakes with no current. Definitely a jig lake, and heavier jigs with the current, not a lot of lindy type fishing due to the rocky composition of the bottom. Tons of walleye as well, and many larger northerns as well. Have not caught or seen musky on this water, but never really fished for them up there. All in all, Temple bay is a great destination for putting fish in the boat, very good for familys, group trips, etc where you just want to fish and take it easy with no work. English river system is more secluded, but will produce just as well if you know where to go and how to fish it. Cornbread"
1222495,dave10,2010-07-26 13:51:00,342,"My sons and I have taken a number of bus trips up to Temple Bay, and if you don't like the hassle of driving yourself, the bus is a good way to go. Movies, sandwiches and lots of anticipation on the way up, and very nice, air conditioned buses. Although I can't sleep very well on a bus, my sons always did fine. The resort itself is great - clean cabins, good food, good staff, decent guides, and a fishery that is definitely on the way up. We now tow our own boat up, and just had one of our better years on Eagle. I think the slot size is really helping. We ended our week with 30 slots and 9 over, the biggest being a 27 1/2 incher. We averaged about 80 to 90 fish in the boat per day, which was pretty good given the windy weather we had the week we were up (July 10 - 17). We couldn't get into Temple Bay this year because we booked late and they were full, but they steered us to Evergreen around the corner, which was also very nice (but much smaller and much quieter than Temple Bay). Mal, who runs Evergreen, used to work with Bob and Peg and so it's a similar set-up. The only major difference is that if you want, you can be out fishing by 7 am at Temple Bay - Evergreen serves a later breakfast which put us on the water no earlier than about 7:45. That difference can mean a lot when you're itching to fish. I also noticed that Evergreen's cabins are not air conditioned. That was not a big deal when we were there, but if it got into the 90's, it might have been. Good luck to all. Dave"
1223858,Jatar,2010-07-30 16:15:00,169,"Hey Cornbread, have you fished ball lake, or anyone else ?"
1303838,tly,2011-05-06 19:07:00,1900,"Have friends from Illinois who have been going there for years. Love the trip, resort & fishing. They meet many of same folks every year & it is a good outing. As I speak they are in Stone Lake WI opening up for the year."
1303874,Obabikon,2011-05-06 21:27:00,2370,This needs a new thread... as temple bay is not on LOTW's. Seems that a couple times a year this thing pops up.
1878057,Guest,2013-06-18 15:09:00,0,"We have been going up to the lodge for 17 years now. Peg & Bob are wonderful folks. Bob can be a little stoggie but his bark is much worse than his bite. We rode the Bus for the first two years then drove up for three years now we tow our boat up. It is the best bang for the buck in the fishing world. The lake is not an easy lake to fish but do yourself a favor and get a guide the first day and have him show you the humps. You will know the technique and how to fish this lake. The lake is full of walleyes slot limit 18"" to 22"". Big Northern off the reefs and big Muskys in theis lake. Our friend caught the 56"" Musky hanging over the bar. The food is incrediable the rooms nice and air conditioned. Full stocked bar and big screen TV with internet service. Most walleyes caught on jig and minnow. You can also troll Viking reef after dinner with rapalas for large Walleye and Northern. We are going up this year for our 18 trip. I hope this helps."
1878921,2746,2013-06-18 19:58:00,3206,"A two year old thread but.....since its been brought up again, I've fished eagle a lot. Never stayed at temple bay but, along with others, have learned to dislike their guide boats. Behave as if they own the lake and any spot they want to fish."
1303698,Guest,2011-05-06 12:24:00,0,"temple bay is the finest resort i have had the pleasure to stay at i have been to many and to me they are the best bang for your buck. the treat you like a king and always remind you that this is your vacation relax and enjoy yourself. the fishing is great and bob and peg feed you like its your last meal, i think i gain 20 pounds every year i go there. and then there is the hamburger party nite and ordover nite. the pepole that work there are polite and courteous, and you will never fill like a starnger. iam heading back this year for my 8th year there. and yes you deffinatley need a gps there is a lot of water and all the islands look the same after a little while, my first year there spent hours lost and ended up fishing in rice bay when we wanted to be at merridian bay a few miles off course.lol the bus ride is long 12 hours but they have a dvd player and tvs for you to watch movies , iam 6,6 so sleeping is out of the question for me. and iam excited to get to the lodge."
1303815,boynurse77,2011-05-06 17:55:00,8,"Temple Bay lodge has the best bar on Eagle Lake .The view is worth the bus ride. Bus ride long, but so is drive depends on the company you keep. Eagle Lake has 50 plus inch muskie in many places but takes work to get them in the boat."

1161988,muskyhunter34,2010-01-21 08:19:00,227,bus trips to temple bay lodge (LOTW) any good?
1162014,Obabikon,2010-01-21 09:33:00,2370,Temple Bay Lodge is on Eagle Lake...
1162042,Pooch,2010-01-21 11:20:00,4619,"Boy, that would be a surprise.Pooch"
1162093,muskyhunter34,2010-01-21 14:59:00,227,"sorry, i stand corrected...ok eagle lake, but how is the set up? some say run like the military, others lukewarm on it...do i have any people who actually fished at the lodge?"
1162101,Obabikon,2010-01-21 15:20:00,2370,"I have not fished out of Temple Bay. Eagle Lake itself is a solid lake, and you'll enjoy a trip there. It's probably not one of the top fisheries in NW Ontario, Going by your screen name, I assume muskies. LOTW's, Lac Seul, English River System will all most likely outperform Eagle. That said, for the price of the bus trip, it'd be difficult to beat the ""bang for the buck"" offered by Temple Bay. (if you prefer the bus trip experience)"
1162116,v-bay gord,2010-01-21 16:17:00,3168,"[QUOTE=Obabikon;1162101]. It's probably not one of the top fisheries in NW Ontario, Going by your screen name, I assume muskies.

Considering Eagle has had two muskie's over 60 pounds on record I would definately consider it one of the top fisheries in NW Ontario."
1162120,Obabikon,2010-01-21 16:34:00,2370,"V-bay, that very well could be. I'm just giving an opinion on what I've read and heard. When I hear people talking about the top 3 musky areas in NW Ontario... Eagle often gets left out. That could just be an overlook..."
1162124,tbird98,2010-01-21 16:44:00,4,"Went 16 years ago,they took care of everything,food great,box lunch(if you don't get shore lunch)dock service was o.k.I had better. Cabins were great,boats and moters were great also.Bus ride was long,that's why we drove the next time.The bus trips(North Shore Lodge has bus trips to ) are great for father and son trips (also mother and son).All you have to do is pack then meet at the pick-up spot and enjoy a week in Canada,they take care of the rest.Things might have changed sinced then. Good Luck!!! Terry"
1162219,Guest,2010-01-22 05:24:00,0,"Temple Bay Lodge is a quality operation. I have been there four times. This is a family friendly place with excellent food, better than average cabins, very good service. Their boats are 17 footers with 40 hp four stroke engines. The guides will put you on fish if you decide to hire one and Bob, the owner, will tell you where fish are biting if you go it alone. The walleye fishing seems to get better each year but be advised that Eagle lake is HUGE and weather can be a factor, so have a good lake map and/or GPS. The only downside is the bus ride. It's an excellent coach with comfortable seats but it is a long 12 hour ride. Bob & Peg have owned and operated this place for over 40 years and they treat their customers well."
1162361,Guest,2010-01-22 15:36:00,0,"I have stayed at the Lodge at least 5 times in the last eight years. The food and service are excellent. Equipment and cabins well maintained. Bus ride is only negative[10-12 hrs] but coaches are also well maintained. Bob and Peg are truly fine hosts. The price point is as good as it gets for an improving fishery. I have chosen to take my own boat the last 2 years. I am more comfortable and my electronics are better than the ones provided. You absolutely have to have a handheld GPS unit to find you way around eagle and to get back to camp. Got lost the 1 st time we went out on our own and took 2 -3 hrs to get our bearings. Not many landmarks. It is a big lake 68,000+ acres and the main lake can get rough in a hurry. Some of the packages have a guide included. You need to have a guide the first day. He will put you on fish and be a wealth of information. Two of the guides are excellent at their jobs and make the day fun. Brad and Jamie know that lake. If you are looking for Muskies, Brad is the best in camp. Jamie will teach a novice how to jig. This is an under-rated fishery that just keeps improving. The slot limits are the reason. I have fished Lac-Suel and Minnitaki, Abrams and Pelican but keep getting drawn back to Eagle. Why, Trophy fish. Catch a lot more Wallyes on Lac-Suel 75-100/day per man but number of fish 27-32 on Eagle is why we keep going back"
