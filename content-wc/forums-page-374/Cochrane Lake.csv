Weather really nice highs in 70s lows in 50s; one day of rain, a few days of wind. Water temps 60-69. We fished a new lake or part of the lake almost everyday. Lots of water to run here. Tried one morning on Deer, found pike on points but no weeds around. Trolled for trout but no luck. Wind picked up so didn't try long. Deer was cold 52-55 degrees. On other lakes, Small pike 18-22"" were everywhere. When you found new weed growth there were even more. Big fish was 39"", about 8 in the 34-36"". Walleye were shallow, 6' in current areas, and 8' on main lake. Anytime you found some current, or bait blown on the bank, the walleyes were there. Avg size prob 14-15"". Schools always had a couple 17-19"" fish, too. Biggest was 25.5"" caught on first evening in camp. Several more 21-24"" caught during the week, too.Overall the action was easy. Last day I fished alone and caught 142 fish(1/2 pike 1/2 walleye). Could have doubled that if I wanted to fish ""hard""(this was only until 4:30pm). We were the first ones in camp, crew was just finishing opening up when we arrived. Had one problem with a prop falling off a new motor, lucky we had another boat in area to tow home. Bugs were bad, very bad. Great trip overall. I'd go back there for sure. PM me with your info would be glad to talk to ya. Scott"

I read on the Showalter's site that there was an ""in camp attendant"" at their Cochrane Lake camp. Is that the case? If so, what is their purpose? Just have not run into that scenario before. Thanks again, -DJ"

1880913,jambi,2013-06-19 15:07:00,504,"A former native that was the attendant, Leo, past away about three years ago. Showalter hasn't had an attendant there in the last two years. The natives used to be a problem snatching fuel, so Leo was there to keep an eye on things. Showalter does alot of flying for the natives and is on better terms with them maybe than in the past. We saw a native boat or two pass the camp in the evenings. They wave but never caused any issues. Most boats had women and kids. There are a few native trapper shacks in the area that they use as a getaway from the reservation, I assume. We had one guy unable to start his motor down from the camp. He flagged down a passing native for help. The native circled back to the camp and told us where our buddy was and we thanked him for that (w/ gas). We were the first ones in this season and fished 8 days 6/6 - 6/14. There was seven of us in our group. We brought 4 x 1# bags of preserved minnows and used half of them. We used about 3/4 flat of crawlers. I switched mid week from the minnows to tipping jigs with crawlers. Four guys didnt fish much with meat and did just fine but I brought it so I used it."
