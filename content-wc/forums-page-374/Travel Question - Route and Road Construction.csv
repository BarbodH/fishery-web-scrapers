Willing to add a little time to the trip it if means not having to deal with heavy traffic while pulling the boat. Also, any road construction worries from MN up to International Falls?"
1862689,jimmie,2013-06-13 08:18:00,123,Depending upon where you may be departing from but usually the I-35 East rotue is quicker. Up near Duluth then get on MN 33 for a few miles to US 53 then up to the falls. If you happen to be on a more SW side on the cities then you can use I-35 W then US 169 to Grand Rapids then West to Deer river where you can hit MN 6 and go north to Big Falls almost no traffic. Then take US 71 to Pelland and East to the falls. Watch your speed thru the Falls tho it slows down at edge of town and then even more in town to the border Takes less than 10 minutes from first light at the west side of town. You should be there to cross without much of a line by 7/8 am. Gas 24 hrs there. Have fun and let me know how your trip goes. jimmie
1862713,LOW1,2013-06-13 08:25:00,2828,"Got back a week ago. We took our usual route up Highway 52 and then around the east side of the Twin Cities on 494/694. Had no delays. There was some construction on I35 going north to Cloquet but no delays on way up and perhaps a 5 minute delay on way back. This is the least construction or delay that I have seen on this stretch in the last two years. And the quality of the new roadway was excellent and a welcome improvement.. There is also construction south of Cook on Highway 53 to extend the divided highway to the Cook city limits. No real delays, but the lanes that are open are in poor shape and there was a lot of construction traffic, so slow down a bit in this area (especially if you are towing) and be safe. All in all, much improved over the last two years.Have a good trip."
1862833,jimmie,2013-06-13 08:43:00,123,www.dot.state.mn.us/roadwork/current.html and www.511mn.org It appears from the current construction page that the area fron Dulth to Virginia MN has some work being done not sure to what degree of completeness that may be in as it was a long winter up here. You may opt for the alternate route that I suggested.
1862969,SinOrSwim,2013-06-13 09:16:00,1528,"That time of night, you won't run into traffic. Probably 35E is your best bet though."
1862985,Lovetofish,2013-06-13 09:18:00,458,That time of evening the traffic thru the Cities shouldn't be heavy. I'd stay on I-35 all the way. Should be quicker and 35E has some construction going on.
1864553,rather-be-fishin,2013-06-13 17:58:00,429,There is NO road construction at all on highway 33 from Cloquet to Highway 53 & from Duluth to Virginia on 53 it is clear sailing!!! I 35 to Hwy 33 to Hwy 53 to the border is the best way to go! Happy fishing!!! 6 weeks to go & counting down to our trip to Lac Seul!!!!! RBF.
1865449,MorganMan,2013-06-14 00:56:00,341,"Yep, should be pretty clear. Although road construction on I35 can pop up anytime, seems like there have been many long (10miles) stretched the past few seasons! I was just through there a few days ago and the only construction all the way up was between Virginia and Cook where they are extending the divide highway most or all the way to Cook. That construction is off to the side of the current highway so no slowdowns at all. Good luck"
1865881,dutchboy,2013-06-14 07:46:00,5717,There is slow downs before Cook. They have flagmen stopping traffic to allow trucks to cross the highway. It's well marked but use caution.
1887833,MorganMan,2013-06-22 05:59:00,341,"Though it looks like I35 is clear still at least from Hinckley to Cloquet (southbound anyway), they have Hwy 33 shut down to one lane in each direction for resurfacing between Cloquet and Hwy 2 exit. Only about 4-5 miles I believe. FYI"
