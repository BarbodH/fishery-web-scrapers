1874258,Mike Kansas,2013-06-17 14:46:00,1463,I will tell the boys Hi from you. Good luck on the houseboat. Just had a group of 9 get back from LOTW houseboat trip. They caught some nice fish but almost burnt up the houseboat. Have a great trip and be safe. Mike Kansas
1874282,joeman79,2013-06-17 14:53:00,417,"Good Lord thats the worst nightmare on any boat is a fire. I pray that it is not an issue with our group, what happened??"
1874410,Jigger1,2013-06-17 15:19:00,234,"Awesome report and it's just what I'm hearing as well. We arrive at SWWL in 9 short days and hoping the unbelievable tear is still happening. This weeks fishing report from SWWL was crazy good and got me so pumped up ... http://www.sww-lodge.com/category/fishing-report/ The also just posted this fantastic video on YouTube video which was really cool ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un63jIOaZZA Good luck everyone, hope you all have fantastic trips. Next week is right around the corner and can not wait!"
1876698,Mike Kansas,2013-06-18 07:34:00,1463,"They had issues with one of the boat batteries and the outfitter told them to take a battery out of the bank on the boat. Loose wires shorted out and started a fire in the battery container. Scary, good thing it started when they were on the boat. Mike"
1877258,jimmie,2013-06-18 10:25:00,123,"Last time there was a late Spring after a cpl days of almost striking out I started to fish under the mayfly skeleton trails and found alot of fish, small and big. I'll be ther from the 2nd to the 13th so hope I do not have to try thast again but just in case now I know. I'll be fishing out of deception Bay area to the northeast section of sen bay and hopefully beyond. Good luck to both of us and be safe and have a great time. Jimmie"
1877290,WalleyeWally28,2013-06-18 10:40:00,298,Great report Mike. We are heading up Friday and hope for similar results. Did you leave a few for us?
1877713,Mike Kansas,2013-06-18 12:46:00,1463,Plenty there for everybody. Hope you have a great trip and your landing net is to small. Be safe and catch a bunch. Mike Kansas
1883785,worthsr,2013-06-20 12:36:00,52,"We leave tomorrow and will be at Black Bay on beautiful Lac Seul Saturday! It's a long drive, but here's the payoff: My son and I fishing at one of the premier walleye holes in the world on a Saturday evening in June and listening to the Blackhawks win game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals! We only get one radio station up there, but I assume all the Canadian radio stations are broadcasting the Stanley Cup Finals Eh?"
1883809,Mike Kansas,2013-06-20 12:42:00,1463,"Scott, Hope you guys have a great trip and you and your son build memories that will last a lifetime. Fish the bay before Warship and up into the chute on the west side of the bay. Good Luck, Mike"
1872426,Mike Kansas,2013-06-17 08:13:00,1463,"Just got back from Lac Seul trip with the boys. Best trip in June we have had in 30 years. Walleye were holding in 3' to 6' of water. When we found mid 60 water temps the bite was awesome. Biggest walleye was 28 3/4"" but a lot of nice fish in the 22"" to 26"" range. Jig and minnow or crawler was the answer. Also beat the banks with Spinners and caught a bunch of Smallies. I have never seen the Walleye more aggressive in the 70 or so trips I have made to Lac Seul. Mike Kansas"
1872546,Lovetofish,2013-06-17 08:39:00,458,Great trip. How were the roads? Which route did you take up and back?
1872554,jkrawchu,2013-06-17 08:42:00,26,Where were you staying? Our group is headed up July 1 - 6th at Evergreen. I hope the fishing is still hot!!?? Any suggestions on locations?
1872650,Mike Kansas,2013-06-17 09:01:00,1463,Took 11 to 52 into Dryden. Only one spot where they have cut pavement and it was a bad bump. Everything else was OK.
1872706,Mike Kansas,2013-06-17 09:07:00,1463,"We stay at Black Bay Outpost out of Lac Seul lodge. It is located on the north shore just east of Windigo point. Headed back the 28th of June to Lost Island Lodge and will be fishing a different part of the lake. Hope you have a great trip. Your owners at Evergreen will put you on fish ...they are great people. We have stayed there in the past, in fact my wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye out of Evergreen. Mike Kansas"

1874114,joeman79,2013-06-17 14:28:00,417,"Glad to hear you had a great trip Mike. Tell Basil and Shane and Sam hi from the other Kansas Boyz!! We will miss them but the guys wanted a change of Scenery, so off to LOTW on a Houseboat. Should be interesting."
