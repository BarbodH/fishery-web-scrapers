1880305,Guest,2013-06-19 11:27:00,0,"Well it's about time lets see the Importers results when they got to use normal bait like the rest of us. And if anybody denies this was going on is a full out liar We all know who some of the main culprits are, its been talked about behind the scene's for years. This is a game changer IMO Hat's off to Jim C"
1880609,tv4fish,2013-06-19 13:28:00,2694,Is this what you're talking about?http://www.vanitycup.ca/I take it leeches are NOT allowed to be used for bait ????
1880809,Guest,2013-06-19 14:42:00,0,No they can be used. They just cant be brought in from the USA or other Provinces. Thats the twist I take on it. And I would say it is obviously an issue. With that kinda money they need to look at one way to stop it. Some fools will try anything. Even knowledge of where they came from other than Saskatchewan and you are in trouble.
