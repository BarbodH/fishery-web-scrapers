1839777,IaDave,2013-06-05 11:00:00,476,Looking to take a trip in July by myself and 2 dogs. I have been to Witch Bay Camp and they do a wonderful job but not much into the American Plan deal and have been to a place near Minnitaki. Looking for a different location that is housekeeping and allow the dogs to stay in the cabin if I don't take them with me in the boat. They wouldn't do anything to the cabins probably sleep since they are older. I'm very self-conscious about having them bug other people in camp because I know alot of guys don't want other peoples dogs in camp. Anybody have any recommendations/personal experiences? Thanks in advance.

You should be able to find a few places that are pet friendly for bringing your dogs to camp. The issue you may find is they won't want you to leave them in the cabin unattended. The reason is they don't want a dog left unattended barking all day long while your away. I've heard a few stories about dogs barking all day long, driving those in camp nuts, but as soon as the family shows up they're quiet as a mouse. I used to go in an RV, which made it a little easier. No cleanup of dog hair for the camps.Try Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul. I couldn't imagine leaving mine behind at the cabin. My saying is the wife comes fishing with me sometimes, but the dog is in the boat all the time. Except for when she was a pup and jumped overboard to retreive the fish four times in a row. Long story, I laughed at first, but was quite mad the fourth time. I made sure it never happened again, and the dog stayed in the boat. She's now 7 and I can be 200 yards away from the dock with her at heal and tell her, ""In the boat"". She'll run to our boat, jump in, and sit there until I get there, even if I'm out of her line of sight for 10 minutes getting bait. She won't be left behind."

The camp dog, Baxter, is owned by Mike, one of the dock hands.Pickerel Arm is part of Minitaki. The camp is about 30 minutes from the Chutes if you want to get into Abram Lake.Lee is a great host. Cabins are very good. Boats are Lund Outfitters with 50's, power trim and tilt."
1878745,whodat,2013-06-18 19:15:00,5,"Rugby lake lodge, between Dryden and V-bay will let you bring your dog. Also, call around as some places do not mention a pet policy on their web site. I recently learned this the hard way. Booked and sent a $200 deposit to Route lake lodge in Feb 2013 for the last week of July. Contacted them in early May and asked if I could bring my well behaved Lab as I lost my pet sitter, as their web site had no stated info regarding a pet policy. They said sorry, no pets and kept my $200. To the original poster, Why would you want to leave your pet unattended in the cabin? Leaving an unattended, yapping dog could ruin some other guests trip, probably the main reason for camps not allowing a pet."

Don would probably not take you to an single cabin outpost but I bet he would take you to Ogoki Reservoir, as he goes there frequently as he has five cabins there. He does take dogs as we take two of our labs with us . In fact we just got back Tuesday night. We stayed at Whiteclay nine days. Ate walleye every night . Had five trophy pike ,the largest being 44 1/2 and the largest walleye being 28 inches. Have fished Ogoki Res. 12 times . Will be bak there next June , Lord Willing. Going back up end of September for a moose hunt . Lake has not been moose hunted or fished in four years. Good Luck whatever you choose."
