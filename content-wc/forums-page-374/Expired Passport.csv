1883161,tlars,2013-06-20 09:34:00,137,Call the American consulate in Minneapolis. One of my buddies had this issue a couple of trips ago. He had a new passport in 45 minutes or so.
1883745,revitup,2013-06-20 12:26:00,140,"If it is just the children's passports that are expired, then a valid birth certificate is enough as long as both parents are present. If not both parents, then a notorized letter from the absent parents giving their permission for the child/children. Letter should have dates of time in Canada and a picture ID of letter writer/writers.Here is a link that will get you the correct info: http://www.travel.gc.ca/travelling/c...consent-letter Good Luck"
1883937,Mike Kansas,2013-06-20 13:08:00,1463,This is true if children are 15 or younger.
1884041,emma17,2013-06-20 13:47:00,436,"Thanks all for your advice. Between yesterday at 3:00 and 1:00 today it's been a rollercoaster of emotions. Ultimately, Senator Kirk's office came through in the clutch and with flying colors. They provided authorization for us to get an urgent appointment downtown Chicago today. Thank God, passports are now in hand. Btw- I would feel bad if our negligence occupied the Senator's time, but it was his excellent staff that came through for his constituents."
