We've done plenty of fly-ins, and a few other lakes through Chimo Lodge, so I'm mainly just looking for lake-specific fishing reports/experiences/stories. It looks like a really big deep lake, are there any lakers in there? How are the portage lakes? Thanks guys!"

We prefer the portage lakes, Bullock and Copper, to the main lake, Warwick. When do you go? Send me a PM and I will mark up a map or give you a call. I live in the SW suburbs of Chicago."
