1828953,Sportdog,2013-06-02 08:51:00,6735,Does anyone know of a good perch fishing lake in the Thunder Bay to Ignace corridor area that they wish to share? We are going up a little early to our cabin stay and thought it would be nice to catch and dine on some nice perch as we will no doubt catch plenty of walleye and pike at our ultimate destination. Thanks for any help.

Always catch a few Walleye and Nothern fishing, but have never targetted them specifically. I do not know of any specific lakes in that area that the good catches were caught in."

1838265,zeebee,2013-06-04 22:58:00,1144,Huh?...sure you're not confusing that with your ancestors? If you don't know then either don't post or preface your statement. Ont perch are fine but like all perch/bass are susceptible to warm water infestations. When cooked they are of no issue unless you fish a long ways west then there appear to be ramifications.
1843033,rockape,2013-06-06 10:52:00,215,Perch in Eagle Lake have worms. At least in the area where we were catching them.
1843145,Walleye_Wrangler,2013-06-06 11:20:00,138,Next time you have a fish fry show everyone that the fish are full of worms but they won't hurt them. Then tell us there is no issue.
1844489,packpro,2013-06-06 19:28:00,695,Just our personal experience. Usually the find the perch do not have worms early in the year. When ever we have a late ice out like we have this year no issues when we catch them in June. During seasons when the ice goes out early and the warmer warms up sooner we do find some worms in the perch. For us warmer water means worms. During the 13 years we have gone up (next week) we may have found them twice.

1851673,Terwalleye,2013-06-09 20:54:00,166,"I hope your right. Cedar has tons of perch. AND tons of worms last year. But, to your point it was an early ice out last year. Even talked amongst our group about not bothering cleaning any this year. But; we'll test a couple out. I am not a big fan of ""extra protein"""

Best perch fishing is in the south end of Blind Bay, 11-12.5"" perch were in my cooler along with walleye and northern, all caught jigging in 7 fow."
