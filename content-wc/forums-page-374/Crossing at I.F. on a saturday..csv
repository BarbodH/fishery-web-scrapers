We are looking at hitting the crossing at around noonish or a little later. What has it been like the last couple of weeks at that time? Thanks in advance for any info you can provide."
1884081,MN_Moose,2013-06-20 14:00:00,964,Last week when we came back on Sat about 7:30 we were very surprised with the lack of traffic. Both in and out. Only took us ten minutes and I would guess those going in about the same. We were also very surprised at the traffic going into Canada Friday afternoon. Traffic way out past the rr tracks east of the corner. About half hour - 40 minute wait. Past results are not a guarantee of future
1884121,wiegert51,2013-06-20 14:12:00,3,We're heading across at about the same time Saturday too. Hopefully we'll get across fairly quick. Last time I went across it only took about 15 minutes but who knows what'll be going on this time!

Three years ago we got to the border between 11:00AM and noon and we had a 2 1/2 hour wait going in. :-( Coming home we arrived in Fort Frances around 11 to 12 and we had a 4 hour wait coming out :-( We have learned our lesson and now we make sure we get to the border between 9:00AM - 10:00 AM and have had little or no wait going in or coming home. Crossing Friday night is not an option for us. General rule of thumb, the earlier you get there the less wait. Good luck! 5 weeks to go until our return trip to Lac Seul RBF"
1884801,epiepenburg,2013-06-20 18:46:00,365,"I think the reality is that there is that there are so many variables to when a ""good"" time is. We crossed from international falls to fort Francis on a Friday at 3pm or so this year. It took 25 minutes to get into Canada. On the return home we crossed on a Saturday at 1pm. We were able to drive right up and cross, took less than 5."
1885705,Mohleye,2013-06-21 07:35:00,368,"I agree....there's no way to predict, at least in my experiences. This year we crossed Friday June 7 mid-afternoon (going in) probably 20 minutes. Crossed back into US Saturday the 15th around 11AM, practically no wait, customs had a guy out in front of the booths directing traffic, all booths open, smooth as could be. I was kinda concerned figuring it was a prime week, we usually go in July and usually cross on TH afternoon going in. We've had some really long waits on Saturdays coming home, but no rhyme or reason as to why."
1886489,LOW1,2013-06-21 10:56:00,2828,"http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/bwt-taf/menu-eng.htmlI have never had more than a 30 minute wait northbound. And there is not much you can do about it anyway, unless you want to cross at Baudette or Pigeon River, which would probably take longer to get to than any wait.The above link will tell you the current situation.I would be more concerned with the possibility of a southbound wait."
