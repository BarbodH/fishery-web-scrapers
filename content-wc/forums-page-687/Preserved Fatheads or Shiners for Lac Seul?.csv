559845,jimbo,2006-07-30 11:13:00,223,expect to pay about 3.50-4.00 a dozen.and they will count them out.
559846,Guest,2006-07-30 11:45:00,0,"If you are going to Evergreen, you receive 2 dozen minnows a day per person for no cost."
559847,7thCrowWing,2006-07-30 11:48:00,132,If the fishing is good it sounds like 2 dozen wont last all day?
559848,Guest,2006-07-30 12:40:00,0,We also took crawlers had had good success with them. I know we get more minnows than 2 dozen. Lori doesn't count them one by one.
559850,Guest,2006-07-30 16:57:00,0,"On spinner rigs use a 2/0 light wire hook. Put hook into mouth out eye and bury in the tail section. Takes care of light nibblers and can usually get multiple fish on one minnow. 8 fish on 1 minnow is my best to date... The minnow place 9name excapes me??) next to Four seasons tackle shop doesn't count either. Goose Bay is 3.00 per doz and ""3 doz"" lasted me 4 days! Think it 5 for 1??? The only time I seem em count is about 3 years ago when there was a shortage of minnows. Dead one's catch too..."
559851,Guest,2006-07-30 17:13:00,0,"I just returned from Evergreen. Two dozen per fisherman, you actually get a lot more, will be fine. We caught tons of fish and by the time we ran out of bait, we were ready to call it a day. Worse case, you buy a few extra dozen. I'd put bringing extra bait on the bottom of my to do list! Evergreen, Lori and all the rest is awesome. Enjoy, you made a wise camp choice."
559852,7thCrowWing,2006-07-30 17:18:00,132,Thanks so much for the great information!! Matt
559856,Guest,2006-07-30 23:20:00,0,"Can you bring preserved baits into Canada? I know about crawlers, smelt, crayfish etc. but not preserved baits.How do they hold up on a spinner rig? This year we had minnows that were about 1 inch long. I wanted some bigger minnows but no way to get them."
559857,1shooter,2006-07-31 08:42:00,1493,Yes you can. I bought mine from bestbait.com. They held up real well and were much cheaper than Cabelas.
