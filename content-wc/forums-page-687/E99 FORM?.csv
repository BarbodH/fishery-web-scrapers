559802,Guest,2006-07-28 09:16:00,0,Just talked to a friend that is out on St. Clair and he was asked if he had his E99 form filled out. He crossed at Windsor. He or I have not even heard of this sort of form before. He said he had to fill one out there and that all it was was reg. #'s and some other basic info.Has any one else had to fill one of these out?
559811,iamwalleye1,2006-07-28 16:40:00,1589,"This is a must when you cross the boarder, You should ask the person when they are checking you out at customs. They will send you over to inspection and they will write it for you. I keep my last years form when they start asking the question I tell them I need a new form E99. Some of the boat launch's in Canda also ask for it to let you launch."
559812,Flip Silverlake,2006-07-28 16:43:00,645,Is your buddy importing a vehicle into Canada? If he is going to leave something up there then the E99 is filled out along with what ever dutys are needed to be paid. If you are just going to be there for a short time or travel in Canada then return to the US you shouldn't have to do that. I think...........
559813,Flip Silverlake,2006-07-28 16:45:00,645,Interesting I've been in Canada fishing since 1961 and have never had a form E99. Something to check into.
559832,Guest,2006-07-29 12:18:00,0,"I have only needed them when crosiing at Windsor, International fall I have never need one!"
559834,Guest,2006-07-29 15:01:00,0,"Seems like each crossing has an agent or two who have their own little reg/rule thingy, that they really like."
559836,Flip Silverlake,2006-07-29 16:44:00,645,"I've found that going both into Canada and coming back to the US. I came home with 9 bottles of beer and the agent at the boarder wanted me to pay duty on it. Had to pull over for a ""strip serch"" with another agent and when he found out that they were 12 oz. bottles he said something like "" we need to teach that guy the rules"" with referance to the other boarder agent. TIME TO GET A PASSPORT!"
559854,Sutsgold,2006-07-30 21:05:00,219,I have never heard of this e99 form. Ive been crossing 3 or 4 times a summer for 10 years now. Have never heard of a strip search either. Has anyone else ever experienced a strip search?
559855,Trailerguy,2006-07-30 21:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]The e99 form should only be reqiured if you are leaving goods in Canada or leaving your boat,ect. more than 45 days. The ""strip serch"" is when they suspect somethimg or if you are unlucky and they tear you down and search everything for illegal items. Most of the time being open and honest without voluntering extra information will avoid this. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
559859,iamwalleye1,2006-07-31 09:20:00,1589,"I do not leave my boat in Canda and they still ask me for the form, This is when I have crossed at Windsor only."
