559762,Guest,2006-07-26 16:32:00,0,"Fishing was good on Gullrock for us last weekend. Caught 50-60 walleyes each day with the biggest being 26 1/2 inches. We worked Henry Island and the boot. Used jigs and kept switching colors until one worked. Buddy used a white jig mostly and as he puts it... was ""Mr. Walleye Wallhanger of weekend."" Good fishing....we plan on heading back there again this weekend."

559448,Guest,2006-07-16 23:41:00,0,Anybody gettin any? walleyes that is.
559452,sifty,2006-07-17 08:36:00,46,I was on gullrock first week of july. Mayflys had already hatched week before we arrived. Fishing was slow. Caught most on the back side of the heel on what they call the boot-not boot island. Biggest was 22 1/2 and a ton of 12-13 inchers. Good luck. Also black Flies were bad!!!
559476,Guest,2006-07-17 19:34:00,0,check my pics i was up in may for opener and we slammed the 22-25' walleyes and boy were they shallow! pitching jigs!
559479,Guest,2006-07-17 22:56:00,0,"yeah........but we were up June 2-23 and the bite started out fair and went to lucky. No big fish.....scattered everywhere and not hungry. Right before we left we were lucky to get enuf for supper......and they were small. Hot, flat and early ice out makes for tuff fishing. Still wonder if it is picking up?"
559488,Renn,2006-07-18 09:36:00,87,Talked to our camp owner on Friday and she mentioned the fishing had been slow due to two large mayfly hatches the beginning of July. She did mention that the walleyes had started to rebound last week. I have a friend up there this week. I will be interested to hear how he did. They will be snapping in 16 days and counting!!! :-) Renn
