I located four pike over 40 inches but could not get them in the boat. LDML is a fun and affordable drive-to lake with plenty of action. We buy all of our groceries at home and split them up among three autos for the 14 hour drive to the Thunderbird Resort. The only item we buy in Ontario is Canadian beer. We buy hard liquor at the duty-free store at the border. Tight Lines, DAVID"

558287,north_alabama,2006-06-11 11:36:00,172,"I'll be calling my camp tonight, and if I get ahold of the guy I'll let you know what he says. I leave for Rockford a week from Tuesday, and leave from Rockford a week from this coming Friday. Can't wait. When are you going up? I'll be back to Rockford on July 5 and I'll put up a report then if anyone is interested. Another place to check is www.fishingthunderbay.com, though news about the ""Lac"" is pretty infrequent there. Never shopped in Grand Marais, so I can't help you there."
558302,Guest,2006-06-11 21:12:00,0,"got back from ldml last night and had a pretty good week of fishing. 1/4 oz jigs tipped w/ half a crawler, leech, or plastics worked the best. chartruese was hot color. fished 6-15 fow. weather was pretty much perfect for fishing, cloudy, choppy 70's. between the 6 of us in our group we boated 300+ walleyes on thursday, just an unbelievable bite."

558348,Guest,2006-06-12 12:06:00,0,I'll be at pine point june 17-24. Anyone else gonna be there that week.
558362,Planocat,2006-06-12 17:48:00,473,"I'll be at Pine Point from June 18 thru July 7th. This will be our 17th year, but with the weak dollar and rediculous gas prices, it may be the last. Boy, the price of a walleye dinner has sure gone through the roof! Hopefully we'll have cool weather..... a nice respite from the Texas heat. Planocat"
558402,Guest,2006-06-13 12:01:00,0,"Planocat, I don't believe we've meet directly, but I have a feeling I've seen ya around up there. If I'm correct you do some fishing with digger up there? I also hope the temps are comfortable, but the cities are forcasting 90's by the weekend, hopefully cooler on the lake."
558417,Planocat,2006-06-13 18:28:00,473,"Yep, I'm not too hard to find..... there's entirely too much of me! I'll be in my usual motorhome site #7. Won't be too many boats with TX registration, usually just me and my brother. I've got the Ranger, he's got the Lund. Stop by and say hello. Maybe if we put our heads together we can figure out how to catch a fish or two. Planocat"
558424,north_alabama,2006-06-13 21:17:00,172,"I finally talked to our caretaker tonight. He says the fishing has been ""fantastic"" (a fairly strong statement for him) for all species. Walleyes biting about anything that has a worm attached to it. Still getting some big pike > 40"", both on LDML and Baril Lake nearby. Walleye biting all over the lake (LDML). We're staying at Baril Bay Camp, way down in the southwest corner. Thanks for the link."
