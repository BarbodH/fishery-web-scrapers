As of Sunday, Dryden District Fire 79, located about 20 km southwest of Vermilion Bay, had grown to approximately 2,600 hectares. The fire ignited July 19 and spread rapidly due to the tinder dry conditions in the area. As a result, the MNR implemented an emergency area order Saturday, prohibiting public access and use of the area, including Winnange Lake, Teggau Lake, Rogers Lake and the west arm of Eagle Lake. The order will remain in effect until conditions improve. MNR fire information officer Travis Moffatt said the order was issued to ensure public safety and allow for effective fire suppression operations on Dryden Fire 79. The MNR, however, can issue permits for limited access into the area. Moffatt said, under the emergency area order, the MNR has the authority to close roads or stop people from travelling to areas threatened by smoke and fire. It also means people may be asked to leave an area if fire management staff feel public safety is at risk, said Moffatt. Meanwhile, in the Kenora District, crews battled seven new fires over the weekend bringing the total for the district up to 116 for the seasons. MNR sector response officer for the John Gibson said Monday that with some precipitation on the weekend they were able to control and extinguish all but two fires. We've slowed down considerably, said Gibson. With the increased activity of late, Gibson said all of Kenora's regular fire crews were reaching their 19-day maximum on the job and used the down-time to get some needed time off. So we gave them two days off and they are ready to go again, said Gibson. The two remaining active fires in the Kenora District are Fire 89, approximately 10 hectares and located on an island just west of Daniels Lake and Kenora Fire 109, 3.5 hectares and is located just east of Grassy Narrows First Nation. Both are under control. A restricted fire zone remains in effect across all of Northwestern Ontario, including the Kenora District. Kenora has also banned all outdoor burning within the city limits. Kenora fire chief Warren Brinkman said Monday that he doesn't see that changing in the near future. The ban, in the city and across the region, includes all camp fires, even those contained in a fire place or a fire pit. Gibson said that MNR fire crews and staff were chasing people lighting campfires throughout the weekend. Brinkman noted that a city fire crew was dispatched to an island on the Winnipeg River Sunday due to a campfire burning during the fire ban. That's just absolutely unacceptable, he said. back"
