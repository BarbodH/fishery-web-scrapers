The lake has a good population of Walleyse as well as bass and Northern Pike and panfish. We have moderate success fishing for Walleyes using trolling as our main tactic. We troll worm harness rigs with various line weights attached. We have experimented with colors over the years and always go back to the same color combos that seem to work. This year I will be taking planer boards, both inline and a mast setup with us. Even thought the lake is small there are some areas where this might work. We also have had some luck with jointed shap raps in various colors with crawdad/orange bottom being the best color. I am looking for ideas to try this year. Thanks Jay"
559705,Guest,2006-07-24 13:16:00,0,Get a good lake map and find some mid lake humps or drops and fish them with a jig and minnow. Most of these spots will have humps that are 10 to 15 below the surface and taper off into 30+ water. This is a prime area for mid and late summer Walleye. When fish are holding on this structure they can be at any of the structures depths and there can be a bunch of them.
559732,Guest,2006-07-24 22:34:00,0,When i went i took all the planers and crank baits mentioned here. Spent a ton getting ready. Caught walleyes best on a jig head tipped with either a minnow or half a crawlerfished straigt under the boat. Find a school and drop the jig/minnow sown to them.
559738,Mohleye,2006-07-25 09:09:00,368,"I don't want to be critical of anyone's fishing methods, especially ones I haven't tried, but those seem like awfully labor-intensive ways to fish for Canadian walleye, especially on a small lake. Try backtrolling with jig and bait, or Little-joe type spinners, or forward trolling with crankbaits to find the active fish, then switch to backtrolling or drifting and jig for the less-active fish. Those are pretty standard methods, and anytime I've ever seen boats with guides, that's what they've been doing as well. If you have a comfort level with the big-water techniques, go with it, but give this a try, too. I think you'll find it easier, more enjoyable, and more productive."
559746,Guest,2006-07-25 15:49:00,0,"I'd bring plenty of jigs. 1/8oz and 1/4oz and even some 1/2oz. Chartreuse, orange, green, pink, black.....(experiment). If you have plenty of jigs, plastic tails, gulp, and crawlers, you should be able to catch plenty of walleyes along weed edges or on structure in that part of the world, this time of year."
559757,Mr. Walleye,2006-07-26 09:36:00,74,Listen to Mohleye. He's right on the money.
559758,Guest,2006-07-26 10:57:00,0,We have made 3 trips to LOTW and each time hired a local to take us walleye fishing. Very simple..jig/minnow. The other thing that was interesting to us was how close we could get fishing in the weeds fishing in 3-5' within 5-10' of the boat pitching in the holes. I bought a variety pack of color jigsheads(1/8 and 1/4) and it has worked great.
559759,Guest,2006-07-26 11:30:00,0,"Thanks for the tips and ideas. The main reason that we like to troll is that my wife and kids are along and this is the easiest for them to catch some fish. I have tried to jig fish a few times when I am out by myself but have not had much luck. I like the idea of looking for weeds and edges to fish, I always looked for dropoffs. I always take plenty of jigs and trailers. On another post I saw the idea of salting/borax minnows to take with me, we will probably try that technique also. Although I like the though of using gulp. My wife caught a nice walleye and two nice largemouths last year within 30 minutes using the same crawler harness with a gulp worm on it."
559760,Guest,2006-07-26 11:36:00,0,keep it simple . as previously said fish the humps or reefs. Jigs tipped with a live minnow or even better in summer a leech If the fish have been fished hard go with a lindy type rig . best tiped with a leech. Spinners are a good choice. In stained water copper or colours along that line have been top producers for me. Bring a mix of colours and mix it up.
