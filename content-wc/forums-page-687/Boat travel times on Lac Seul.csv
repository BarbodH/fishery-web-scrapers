559782,tjsker,2006-07-27 14:13:00,301,I'll be staying at the NW end (Evergreen) and was wondering how far could one venture south on the lake for a day. We'll be using a 16th boat w/50hp motor. Is McKenzie Bay too far? How much gas is needed?
559788,Guest,2006-07-27 16:11:00,0,"If you look on a map of the lake, Steamboat Narrows is about 10 or 10.5 miles. On my boat, (17 ft with windshield and 100hp Merc) I was averaging about 32 mph. If you get a chop on the water, your speed will increase as your boat is further out of the water riding the chop, thus less drag. If the chop is too high than you need to slow down or get beat to death on the waves. McKenzie Bay is about 21 miles from Goldpines via Shanty Narrows. If you travel further up the bay, longer distances. Whatever you do, remember the 1/3 fuel rule, 1/3 out 1/3 back, 1/3 reserve. McKenzie Bay is wide open country. When the lake starts to roll, its time to get outta there."
559789,dave10,2006-07-27 16:43:00,342,"tjsker - Traveling at about 35 miles an hour, we made it from Evergreen to the southern tip of Fisherman's Island (the big island that is the east side of Steamboat Narrows) in exactly 25 minutes on normal, relatively calm days. With your rig, I would guess you could do that in about 35 or 40 minutes. We never went farther south through the next narrows, but you can eye up a map and get a pretty good idea of your travel time based on that distance. I agree that you have to consider the impact of windy conditions. Have a blast - I posted a LacSeul Evergreen report last Sunday which you may want to check out. Gary and Patty are great people.

559798,tjsker,2006-07-27 23:14:00,301,My sense of adventure amounts to nothing more than dodging the umbrella in my Mai Tai. I think I'll stay closer to home base. Thanks
