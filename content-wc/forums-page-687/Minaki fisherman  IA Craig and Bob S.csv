My question is that we are on the hunt for more consistent Walleye and want to try the river and Big Sand. The problem is that we have been going there for years but only one trip up Noth to catch Musky. Given the shear size of Big Sand I was hoping to get a better idea of where to fish in this massive lake. I am not trying to steal someone's great or secret spot but rather catch wallyee more consistently. I have a wealth of feeback of spots South I can share with you but need some education on going North. My dad and I are in Love with the system as a whole but really have not found wallye consistently so I am reaching out to others who share my love for this massive 45 miles of fishing opportunities. We stay at Barbers in Minaki and I want to make contacts with others to share and learn more. Any replys will be appreciated. My email address is [email protected]."

There are a group of island called green island. There are some reef off it that are good. Also the rock pile at the top of the lake is very good this time of year. If you get some south wind the beach is good, Also petes point you will have to ask Peter about it. If you stay up there until one hour before dark and troll pearl white shad raps #9. You will have a bunch of boat doing it. I run a triagle up one side and down the other!"

So you can generally pick any reef you want without bumping boats. I personally have a reef i head to first by the beach, but on the way home I will stop off at others and usually do just as well. I also like the rough rock narrows area . In particular just past the first sequence of islands . That area hold lots of small ones , but does hold pockets of some big fish."

I have my own nicknames for all my spots so I need to look at a map to give you real names or it won't make any sense. If I don't e-mail you before I leave this Friday, I will try to remember to finish it and e-mail it to you after I get back. I am heading out Friday night to Minaki! As stupid as it may sound, in the evenings during the summer the best trolling is often over 200' of water with #9 shad raps, deep thundersticks or other cranks ranging from 10 - 30 ft down. IaCraig"
559779,Guest,2006-07-27 13:28:00,0,"IA Craig: I am heading up to Minaki on the 6th of Aug and if you don't mind, would you e-mail me how the fishing was and any spots you feel you can share. Thanks[email protected]"
559807,IaCraig,2006-07-28 12:59:00,434,"I will try to remember, but I don't expect to get home until close to midnight Saturday night so it is questionable if I'll get you info before you take off."
