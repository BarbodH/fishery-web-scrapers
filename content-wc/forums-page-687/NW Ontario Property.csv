559639,Sutsgold,2006-07-22 13:04:00,219,Does anyone know where leased waterfront land in NW ontario can be obtained? We are looking for remote property for a small fishing cabin.
559641,Guest,2006-07-22 15:35:00,0,"It is tough. If you want a cabin, somewhere in the more-populated areas, like LOTW, they can be found (though they're not plentiful). If you're looking for a remote piece of leased land to build a cabin on (and be on a good fishery), good luck! And if you're looking for some land you could lease to be able to build a cabin on, forget it! Are you a resident of Ontario? If not, that's another problem. A significant push has occurred in the last quarter-century to prevent such developments from occurring on our pristine, remote fisheries. Private development of any kind (unless you're on reserve land) has become extremely heavily regulated. Even owners of outpost camps on many remote fisheries are regulated by MNR as to how many people can stay at the outpost at one time. NWO Fishing Bum"

Whatever I do will end up in my kids hands 30 years from now. So remote and isolated would be acceptable. I would love to find something along the road to red lake."
559647,Trailerguy,2006-07-22 17:45:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Remote property for a fishing cabin is going to be tough to find. Only Ontario residents can lease, I beleive. There was a cottage for sale last year in the same developement I'm in, that is on a leased lot. It had to be purchased by a resident, and was slow moving. I've seen cabin sites advertised that are leased from the railroad, but they are rare and not lakefront. You see bare lots that aren't lakefront, usually old mining claims. I think lakefront is over rated if you go remote, there are usually plenty of lakes within a short distance. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
559674,biggeorge50,2006-07-23 18:13:00,128,dignam.com has land for sale in Ontario that looks reasonably priced. They offer a free catalog.
559735,grt1,2006-07-25 06:05:00,259,"There may not be property, but there are cabins that are available, you just got to pay the price. the days of going on the ""cheap"" are long gone, cabins in Red Lake area are anywhere from 70,000 to 150,000 There was an article in the Winnipeg Free Press that stated the average price people in Manitoba are paying for summer cottages is in the 230,000 range. As far as dingman.com goes, it reminds me of the swamp land in Florida concept. you never know what you're getting until you go and see the property."
559744,Trailerguy,2006-07-25 15:32:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Dingman.com is pretty much old mining claims,ect. that they pick up on tax sales, and then try to flip at a good profit. I'd be sceptical about giving them $ without seeing and investigating the property first. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
