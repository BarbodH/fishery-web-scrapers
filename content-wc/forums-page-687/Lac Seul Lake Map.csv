559827,GMANNN,2006-07-28 23:27:00,8,I would like a map of the Northern half of the lake. We were there in late June however I did not bring a map home. I see members talking about areas they fished that I would like to mark for next year. We fished Mckenzie bay all 4 days so we did not explore Steamboat etc. Thanks
