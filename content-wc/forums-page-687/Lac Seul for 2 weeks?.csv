For me it's a 15-17 hour drive pulling a boat, so there is 2 days burned driving. That only leaves 13 days to fish. More than likely you get 2-4 days of crappy weather (based on past experiences) in the 2 week period. Now your down to +9 days of decent fishing. A two week trip is SOOOOOOOOOOOO relaxing not to mention some good fishing. It's nice to be able to forget what day of the week it is! Wish it were possible to 2 - two weekers! Try it you'll like it!"
