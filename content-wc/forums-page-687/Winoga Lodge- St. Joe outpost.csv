559775,IaDave,2006-07-27 10:53:00,476,I see Winoga Lodge put a new outpost cabin on Lake St. Joseph last year. Has anyone stayed there yet and if so how was the fishing? I'm sure it was good but always curious. I have stayed at Winoga Lodge in the past and I feel the owners are some of the best people I have met that are in this business. We have been driving to Pickle Lake in the past but a fly-in from Sioux Lookout would cut the trip by 3 hrs one way. Thanks in advance.
