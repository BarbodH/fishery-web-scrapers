But my point was not to be made into a discussion on wife vs no wife. It was to point out the fact that cooking is really pretty easy, and not just a women's job (although we have had guys along that would argue otherwise, they are not invited back)."
6498546,Ricky Spanish,2020-11-12 10:05:00,1298,"I've had a 10qt Power Pressure Cooker XL since before Instant Pot existed. You know how chili always tastes better on day two? Make it in a pressure cooker and it's like that in practically no time. I try to do a lot of cooking ahead and freezing it. A big chunk of smoked brisket, baggies of chili, steaks, brats, or burgers for the grill. For the boat maybe some cold cuts, cheese, and bread or crackers. For a week long fishing trip, I eat fish maybe once or twice. My wife doesn't like it and it's typically just the two of us. I have brought a crockpot before, but prefer the make ahead route. I'm on vacation after all."
6498594,adempsey2.0,2020-11-12 15:49:00,611,"I am curious how you prep this. Do you vacuum seal/season the meat ahead of time and then plop it into the water bath and leave it there all day while you fish? Do you freeze it in the bag ahead of time? or is it fresh meat and you put it in the bag at the camp? Are the sous vide wands/sticks electric or battery powered? Is prime rib too fatty for Sous Vide? What cuts do you use? I think this isn't bad idea for a really nice roast or steak, especially if you sear it before serving."
6498596,Bigtaproot,2020-11-12 16:01:00,900,You are correct on the searing. One minute per side in cast iron as hot as you can get it. This is a great sous vide starter sitehttps://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/...thod/sous-vide Enjoy
6498598,prov1800,2020-11-12 16:20:00,5010,You'll have to wait till we get some ice.We had a melt down last week.
6498602,prov1800,2020-11-12 16:23:00,5010,Better yet let's hope all this rapid testing and vaccines let you cross the border soon.

6491364,prov1800,2020-10-13 07:01:00,5010,Could always have a pike or perch meal.But steak good to.
6491490,Guest,2020-10-13 11:41:00,0,"The Sous Vide is the best cooking tool ever invented. Steaks, Pastrami, roasts. Just get it going and it is perfect every time. Sear on the grill and you are eating quick"
6491618,Net_Man,2020-10-13 21:08:00,580,I would get kicked out of the heard if I brought TV dinners......
6492394,Bigtaproot,2020-10-16 09:16:00,900,To me the most versatile thing to bring on a trip is a spiral cut ham. Good for breakfast and to make sandwiches on the days i would rather fish than take the time for a shore lunch. Pressure cooker is good on the days later in the season when you want to get a soup on the table in record time that tastes like it took all day
6492862,mixedbag,2020-10-17 16:15:00,76,"Absolutely! Will elevate your cooking presentation several levels with minimal effort, intellectual or otherwise. Eat better than home. Look better than a pumpkin!!!!"
6498428,Aspencreek,2020-11-11 18:23:00,2911,"By some of these reply's I'm wondering if some of these people have ever set foot on the working side of a kitchen, you guys better pray you go before your wife.....TV Dinners...YUK. As the camp cook (I don't have to do dishes, or clean my own fish) if I told the boys it was a TV dinner night, they would make me sleep in the car and fish from shore. A Crock pot, or whatever similar, is great for stew, beef tips, etc, etc. The large electric fry pan is also packed. We eat really well, spiral ham as noted is a good one, I've also done a full turkey. For you guys that eat fish at every meal..so be it, but not our group. The wives have no idea what is on the menu and we keep it that way, we tell them that PB&J and fried eggs and fish. That way they don't want to come along."

6498470,Eckohlt,2020-11-12 03:44:00,3685,You got that right rich
6498476,Eckohlt,2020-11-12 04:04:00,3685,"I could also go for some deep fried walleye egg rolls dipped in sweet Chile sauce,wonder if prov1800 can ship me some fresh eye across the border"
6490206,Guest,2020-10-08 18:51:00,0,If any of you guys ever taken a pressure cooker with you? If so what do you cook with it? I think it would be a good idea to get dinner on the table quickly at a camp
6490216,bbheli,2020-10-08 19:55:00,1387,Instant pot almost nothing you cant cook in it.
6490222,adempsey2.0,2020-10-08 20:28:00,611,"Wouldn't a BBQ be even faster? or pre-cooked meals? I honestly don't know how fast a pressure cooker cooks. Maybe if you really wanted a fresh pot roast or pulled pork or something like that. Personally, all my focus is on the BBQ."
6490242,Lmbkiller,2020-10-08 21:29:00,639,"Nothing beats TV dinners for speed, fast to make, fast to eat, fast to the bathroom"
6490284,port1042,2020-10-09 06:28:00,509,"There are two appliances that take with me. I bring my electric fry pan as it is my go to device at home for frying filets. It also works great for grilled ham and cheese sandwiches. We seldom cook eggs but it would be fine for that too. It's quick, reliable, and easy to clean. There are 4 guys in our cabin so I also bring a 4 slice toaster. I actually bought one specifically for this purpose. They are pretty cheap. We often have toaster waffles, bagels, English muffins, or toast in the morning and the 4 slice unit, along with 2 slice unit in the cabin, gets us on the lake quicker."
6490292,ri rory,2020-10-09 06:54:00,33,We bring a Can Cooker-the 2 gallon size. We fill it with fixins before we go out in the afternoon and turn on the stove when we get in. 30 minutes later you have a feast. WE Dump it in an aluminum pan. Makes quite a presentation There are a million recipies that are available. The 2 gallon will provide an abundant meal for 4. If you had a bigger group get the 4 gallon unit. All for sale at Cabelas and BP. Get the bottom rack--extra $10. Good luck
6490324,mixedbag,2020-10-09 08:28:00,76,two things...Instant Pot and sous vide stick
6491036,prov1800,2020-10-12 06:57:00,5010,Really guys.OMG.what a way to ruin a trip.4 slice toaster.cant forģet that.what about a generator for shorelunch.
6491340,Eckohlt,2020-10-13 05:04:00,3685,Everything I need is swimming in the lake except the frypan
6491358,eyecatcher1,2020-10-13 06:20:00,323,I agree! When I'm in Canada I want fresh walleyes for dinner. I'll usually bring a steak for the grill on the last night since I can't have fish that day.
