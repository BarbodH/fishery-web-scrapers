6501640,That Minnesota guy,2020-11-25 11:50:00,8293,Thanks Gord. We sometimes fail to remember we are all humans and boundaries are nothing more then a line on a map. The story illustrates a story between two humans and has nothing to do with Americans & Canadians. Nice Thanksgiving read.

Good grief, the sudden slap of reality is a harsh teacher. Good thing there are some ""special people"" around to help shepherd the clueless. In 2001 I drove that same route, I would NOT want to do that in the winter."
