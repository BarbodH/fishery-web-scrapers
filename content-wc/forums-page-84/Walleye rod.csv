6501312,kswalleyer,2020-11-24 06:14:00,1651,"to me , crank bait rod and jig rod tend to be different...i assume hards baits being crank baits? to me, cranking rods seem to be more of a longer, MEd/MEd heavy(depending on application) slower tip rod. you want a bait caster reel for the load. they will tear up a spinning real. you want the rod to load up , not rip the bait out of the fishes mouth. jiggin rod? I'd be looking at spinning. Med, med light, fast action for sensitivy and pick up. rod actions vary from manufacturer to manufacturer...as an example, Med is not universal...some are heavuer some are lighter in same rod action. atleast this is what works for me"
6499428,Bigtaproot,2020-11-16 06:49:00,900,Have been using Cabella starter walleye rod for a few years and want to make that my secondary rod. Jig and hard bait fisherman and target walleyes. Will put a Shimano baitcaster on the rod. Can afford up to 200 dollars. Any suggestions are welcome and thanks in advance Tool
6499446,adempsey2.0,2020-11-16 07:30:00,611,"So a multi-purpose rod? Probably a 6'6"" to 7' medium fast rod or medium light fast depending on the cranks you throw. St.Croix Avid, Avid-X. Couldn't really find anything suitable from GLoomis, maybe someone else has a suggestion. Baitcasters for walleye is less common with the exception of trolling/bouncing."
6499468,gordy28,2020-11-16 09:01:00,437,"I can't speak to baitcasting rods as I use spinning rods for all of my walleye fishing I do have 2 spinning rods I have been quite happy with Fenwick HMG - 7 foot, medium which I use for trolling and casting St Croix Avi - 6 foot 3 inches medium which I use for jigging One of my good friends has the St Croix Eyecon 6 foot 3 inch and is also very happy with it Cheers Andrew"
6499488,Mojo-NC,2020-11-16 10:02:00,1929,"A few more specifics for your intended uses would be helpful for anyone to make recommendations. I like to use a 7' St. Croix Mojo Bass or a 7' St. Croix Eyecon rod for throwing cranks, but like to stick with a 6'6"" spinning rod for jigging. You don't have to spend an arm and a leg on your rods, but you certainly can if you choose to go top of the line with brands like St. Croix, G Loomis, etc."
6499508,biggamefisher,2020-11-16 11:02:00,540,"Will this rod only be used in Canada? LOL Regardless, 99% of us use spinning outfits for targeting Walleye while jigging. I do use a baitcaster for pulling bottom bouncers and drop shotting for eyes............while occasionally using one to toss some Walleye cranks."
6499624,Bigtaproot,2020-11-16 17:47:00,900,"In all honesty, it will only be used in Canada. I know it is probably not smart but with the money I saved from not having a trip this year I am thinking I will spend it on a decent rod. Since I live in Chicago area, the fishing is really not that good and my dad is so old that we can't really fish together in Minnesota anymore Tool"
6499640,bthomas3333,2020-11-16 20:01:00,465,"I would go with the St Criox Eyecon line of rods. If jigging I would go with 6'3"" MXF. If casting I would go with 6'6"" or 7' MF.Great rod. Enjoy.Brett"
6499646,biggamefisher,2020-11-16 20:02:00,540,Just found it interesting that your inquiry was posted in the Canada Eh? forum?
6499784,The tank,2020-11-17 11:02:00,340,"If your startup rod satisfies your casting needs i would get a good jigging rod such as a spinning rod. Fenwick elite walleye rod 6'9"" mlxf is a good choice and stcroix eyecon 6'8"" mlxf is also a good choice in your price range. You can put a pflueger president on them and not have much more than $200 involved. Just my 2cents."
6499936,Mike Borger,2020-11-17 22:11:00,1554,"For jigging I'd stick with a spinning rod. St. Croix developed the 6""3"" medium power extra fast action 6-10lb rod and pretty much every other rod manufacturer has copied it - for good reason, that configuration is almost the perfect walleye jigging rod.Anything in that configuration is what I'd recommend, but sticking with St. Croix they make an Avid series spinning rod in that configuration that retails for around $200 and it's a very nice rod."
