6497072,prov1800,2020-11-04 15:50:00,5010,White out.lol.
6497424,Bigtaproot,2020-11-06 18:48:00,900,"My gal and I live in a trailer. We have gotten used to not having a lot of stuff. After many years of doing with out, I find I don't need a lot of unusual items when I fish. We could if we wanted all her whole house up to Canada on a driving trip"
6496416,Bigtaproot,2020-11-02 04:52:00,900,My dream is to live in Camo and hi vis in a room with multiple red solo cups. The Camo blanket means he has gone even beyond the dream. Keep the opener Fred as those cannot be bought even on Amazon
6496490,Bill Krejca,2020-11-02 07:13:00,6107,"Since I started this thread, I guess I can hijack it a bit more, by sharing that yesterday, I smoked up a few leftover Cedar Lake slab crappies on my pellet smoker. They came out pretty good, considering crappie is not an oily fish, so they do shrink down. I used the same GMG that I took up to Cedar a few years ago. Bill"
6496536,prov1800,2020-11-02 09:09:00,5010,I would imagine you would have to watch so they dont dry out.Probably taste good though.Love crappies.
6496560,7 Mag,2020-11-02 10:30:00,1887,"Love crappies, fried a few fresh ones the other day. Really looking forward to a shore lunch next year."
6496598,prov1800,2020-11-02 12:40:00,5010,So glad they are in some of our canadian waters now.I have 2 limits in our freezer plus walleye .not fresh but close.Will carry us through till ice fishing starts.
6496830,prov1800,2020-11-03 10:05:00,5010,Bill heres a veiw of Nelson Lake from Back ache bridge

6496990,prov1800,2020-11-04 08:02:00,5010,Been there.haha.
6497016,That Minnesota guy,2020-11-04 10:24:00,8293,What he was getting at is you didn't attach a photo of Nelson Lake.
6497020,prov1800,2020-11-04 11:11:00,5010,Whoa.iam losing it.been getting up to early

6495286,prov1800,2020-10-28 20:52:00,5010,iam goiñg to have to get over there next year and check out your cooking.

6495322,Bill Krejca,2020-10-29 06:21:00,6107,"Ha! Yeah, John, I have been inviting you to stop by for years! Bill"
6495400,prov1800,2020-10-29 10:45:00,5010,"It seems iam always busy when your up.This year i had plenty of time.lol.Hopefully we get a chance in 2021.Should be a few extra fish out there as not many were taken out this year.Crappie population was hardly touched this year.I did not see anyone out during the spawn,just my wife and i."
6495612,Bill Krejca,2020-10-30 06:15:00,6107,"Yeah, re: spawn - I'm thinking there should be a bonus carryover, due to crappie/walleye location being most predictable and accessible to the hook during the predictable shallower water presence. I'd guess a noticeable increase in larger fish would be the case, should be interesting to see how it all plays out. Fish biologists should have a study field day, along with the rest of us who attempt to play with what we think we know!!! Bill"
6495662,prov1800,2020-10-30 07:16:00,5010,You might be right Bill but i dont think fishing will really change much next year except we will all know there are more fish available in the lake but on most normal days fishing is very good to begin with.I did not notice anything different this year at all.We might catch a few more larger fish in 2021 but dint think it will be real noticeable.Been up CPR road a few times looking for a calf moose. Fairly quite place and there are always moose there.Have seen tracks only.Hiked the trail into the portage lake and cant remember the name of it.Took a snap shot from my garmin explorer bluetoothed to my phone. Maybe you have been there.

6495748,RichA$1970,2020-10-30 09:23:00,1159,We don’t bring bottles but Fred always brings his bottle opener I got him from Bali and the thing smells like crap....now I wonder what he’s doing when he fishes alone.
6494480,Golden Eagle,2020-10-24 19:42:00,2642,"I was on the first flight for the May opener and had enough food for 8 guys, although only 1 guy was with me.The pilot asked if I was staying until April."
6494486,Slim03,2020-10-24 20:06:00,159,Last year I started to take ice trays. Seems like we always have an ice issue so a couple extra sets of trays for cheap go a long ways. Leave them there when we are done but ensures we have ice for mixed drinks and a little extra for the boat coolers. Someone’s job every morning and night to empty and refill.
6494508,Pooch,2020-10-25 01:40:00,4618,^^^BINGO^^^ Pooch
6494578,Bill Krejca,2020-10-25 08:33:00,6107,"Yeah, ice cube trays, I always pick up a few at garage sales, I didn't mention these, as I figured lots of folks bring them up, it seems strange that the cabins aren't overflowing with them! Bill"
6495004,gordy28,2020-10-27 08:28:00,437,"Too funny re ice trays We generally try to keep notes during our week - which food did we need more enough, had too much, items we wanted and so forth Ice trays was at the top of our list this time around - never been an issue before as the outfitters we used gave us bags of cubes but Slate Falls uses block ice which was great for coolers but not so much for Rye and Scotch lol - will definitely pack a few trays for our next trip"
6495188,jveri,2020-10-28 10:15:00,70,"We always buy 2 or 3 teflon coated frying pans to bring up each year, nothing worse than cleaning pans with stuck on food/fish. We usually bring 2 or 3 chefs knives as well since most camp knives are dull at best."
6495190,prov1800,2020-10-28 10:30:00,5010,Could start something here but not intending to but Clarks has ice cubes for there guests at the drive inn and actually a plane comes around every couple of days with minnows and ice on the flyouts.
6495192,prov1800,2020-10-28 10:40:00,5010,"Also have had a 6 inch wide pvc gutter with a end cap on one end and a mnr stick on fish tape on inside for measuring fish.its 40 "" and does double for guys that need to take a leak.Especially in my Lund with the wide gunwhales. .Very easy to clean and works great on those windy days.Fantastic for measuring fish as you just put there lios against the end cap and very capable of measuring pike as well.easy to lay them in there and hold them down.Cost is basically nothing.Its the cheapest piece of fishing eqùipment i have."
6495196,Eckohlt,2020-10-28 10:50:00,3685,"John you forgot free water at Clarks outposts lol,can't beat that minnow deal"
6495222,Bill Krejca,2020-10-28 13:26:00,6107,"Yeah, again, I bring my own knives, a very large dia skillet for making cheese-ham-onion-pepper hash browns, several cast-iron frying pans, a large antique spoon (capturing memories)used by Dad for years, baking tins in various sizes to keep cooked food warm while cooking other food, a large coffee maker, electric long flat plate for pancakes, lids for the skillets. Although these are not super unusual items, they come in handy. Bill"
6491762,gordy28,2020-10-14 14:23:00,437,Thanks! Our flight had got delayed and we ended up just rolling on without another stop but its good to know (I got my current bundle from Canadian Tire)
6491768,Bill Krejca,2020-10-14 14:56:00,6107,"Oh, yeah, I take a plastic bag full of reusable 12 x 12 cloths, multiple uses. Bill"
6491792,Walleye2242,2020-10-14 16:05:00,263,my older buddy brings a pee trough. He uses it when he has to go in the boat.....like a 4 foot trough from pvc pipe so it goes right over the boat. haha.
6492114,gordy28,2020-10-15 12:08:00,437,I am not that old but love the idea - I am cursed with a small bladder (and love of beer) and find the bailing bucket lacking!
6492156,Old Timer,2020-10-15 15:28:00,255,"I've been taking extra trash bags for years, both on drive-in and fly-in trips. For drive-in trips I now bring a vaccum packer if I intend to bring home fish. If the fish are frozen and then packed in ice, they arrive home very stiff if the trip is seven or eight hours long. For those of you who are fishing Leech Lake or other northern Minnesota lakes for the first time, hire a guide. Minnesota lakes are not fish ponds like many in Ontario. Minnesota fishing is very different. And it makes no difference what kind of electronics you have on your boat. So humble yourself and hire a guide for a day or two, or the whole trip. And NO, I'm not a guide. Just an old duff who has fished Minnesota and all over Canada for nearly seventy years."
6492244,Guest,2020-10-15 20:18:00,0,I always pack a Canadian tuxedo which is jeans and a Jean jacket. I think checks in Canada dig that outfit
6492322,adempsey2.0,2020-10-16 06:53:00,611,"I can't imagine bringing a 4' pipe for that, lol! That is just screaming for size jokes... You could use one of those portable male urinals they use in the hospital. Most just use the boat bailer.Not sure if I bring anything weird or unusual, but I have brought large sponges on the fast few trips. Nothing like a dense sponge to bail/clean your boat with. Personal water bottle with a built in microfilter is great too. Fill it at the side of the boat for some nice fresh water! For me, sandals/flops as well. I don't usually wear sandals and never used to bring any, but they are a must now for going out to pee in the middle of the night.Construction thickness garbage bags are a must too!"
6493000,Walleye2242,2020-10-18 08:25:00,263,His pee tube is pretty funny but it gets the job done for him....never gets in the boat. ha. He also brings up and shower head and switches out the shower heads for the week. I kid you not.
6494310,btyreprich,2020-10-24 06:28:00,1067,Empty coffee can to hold bacon drippings and cooking oil. This can is kept in the refrigerator during out trip. I also spring a plastic trigger spray bottle to use when cooking over the BBQ grill. Spray water on the grates if they catch on fire.
6494468,Bigtaproot,2020-10-24 18:18:00,900,I take a 1 gallon plastic mile jug and cut it in half. Use the handle and great for taking boat squirt
6491148,Bill Krejca,2020-10-12 11:57:00,6107,"Comment on 4-slice toaster reminded me of at least one item which I take, and now await the OMG comments! Some years ago, I started taking a cheap large garage sale plastic clothes hamper. Why, you say, do you want/need such an item? Hardly, as one set of fishing clothes can be enough for most trips! But, I have found that every cabin which I have been in has a waste container about the size of a gallon milk jug (slight down-size exaggeration). At any rate, it seems that whatever is provided is so small that it is barely possible to not overflow within a day. Or less. I find that with the extra large plastic bags (which I also bring), it is possible to actually hold enough trash until garbage pickup day. Fits nicely in trailered boat and can help prevent other items rolling around while going down the road. Unusual? Bill"
6491150,bigwalleye1,2020-10-12 12:04:00,2632,Ever considered one of the pipe and fitting breakdown-able hamper frames? Same concept plus less room....
6491338,Eckohlt,2020-10-13 05:02:00,3685,"One thing about drive in resorts you can bring everything but the kitchen sink,Bill don't tell me you bring a bigger sink along?"
6491362,Bill Krejca,2020-10-13 06:48:00,6107,"Ha! The sinks are normally plenty adequate, but the kitchen waste container is always lacking. It has been said that I do take a pile of interesting extras. I took a small GMG smoker several years ago, and smoked up some nice crappies. That same year, we got gone through at the border. We had a pickup and my 20' Alaskan, which can carry a lot of lighter stuff. Five officials simultaneously went through every crack and compartment/travel case, while the lady boss stood with us. They didn't find anything illegal, which was to be understood, but the comment one of them made was that it looked like we were going camping for a month! I generally don't take stuff which isn't used, unlike some newbies who have been with me, in spite of being told not to in advance. Bill"
6491384,prov1800,2020-10-13 08:06:00,5010,If your coming to a drive in its very easy to bring anything you want.If its a flyout you have to limit yourself or pay extra for weight or another plane.Ive seen the extra plane mainly for beer.lol.But with older fisherman the more comfort the better and iam all for that to.Most outposts pretty much have everything thats needed to make it through a week.Definatly not really roughing it.A solid roof over your head is the best part.
6491470,Eckohlt,2020-10-13 10:58:00,3685,"Good write up,the only smoker I haul up there are the ones I tell to quit smoking you might be able to fish longer,plus if the motor quits they need to be able to row for more than 5 minutes"
6491472,Eckohlt,2020-10-13 11:02:00,3685,"Good solid roof and all the water you drink,and the best part hundreds of those free little fishy's,I don't want to say minnows on here it might start a riot lol"
6491624,rather-be-fishin,2020-10-13 21:51:00,429,"Bill, HA, HA, HA, your not the only one that brings a tall garbage can!!! 🤣 We brought one too for years..... but finally found a resort that has a decent tall kitchen garbage can, so don't bring one anymore!👍😁 I am one to bring many things to come prepared. We too got checked at the border & as they were going through our stuff in the boat & bed of the pick up, they said are you going camping? We said no, going to a resort renting a cabin. They said you sure have lots of stuff....fans & DVD players & we said came prepared with fans if it's hot 🥵 & DVD Players to watch movies in case it's raining!!!👍😁 RBF"
6491742,gordy28,2020-10-14 12:59:00,437,"Our last few trips have been outposts which rarely offer a garbage can - we typically just tie off a garbage bag and make sure all of our compostable stuff goes in the gut bucket I am not sure if it qualifies as unusual but we typically take a 20 pack of microfibre rags (for washing your car etc) - they are awesome for boat duty, kitchen duty and I like to keep one for myself in my room to use to wash up any cuts or scrapes I always seem to accumulate Last trip our grocery store stop in Thunder Bay didnt have any and man were they missed. Next time around will buy ahead of time and pack in my suitcase"
6491754,Medy,2020-10-14 13:26:00,40,Canadian Tire (either one in Thunder Bay) usually has them
