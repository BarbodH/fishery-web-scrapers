6496976,gordy28,2020-11-04 06:17:00,437,Thanks for all the feedback - Larry S - I think I would like to live in Las Vegas and make sojourns up North for fishing as well! I've been to Vegas a few times for work and have always had a blast I think our cutoff is 10 hours or less drive if the jump off point is fairly close to the airport (doesn't make sense to fly 11 hours and then have a 5 hour drive to the float plane base in my mind) In terms of packing your fishing gear - it took more prep but overall we didn't find we missed any key items - for fishing tackle it forced us to be more selective which was a long time coming. If I had to guess I would say 85% of the time I had either a jig or a crawler harness on my line lol Cheers Andrew
6497928,Larry S,2020-11-09 09:40:00,665,"Thanks Andrew. One of the only real negative things I have found flying is that several times my return flight schedule has been changed. in 2017, my flight was rerouted from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg then home to Las Vegas. WestJet sent me first to Toronto with a several hour wait .Then on to Vancouver with a 7 hour wait for my flight to Las Vegas Instead of getting home around Noon Vegas time ,I didnot make it back till 10PM. tried to get put on earlier flights, but WestJet Did Nothing. Called after getting home and complained, Nothing from WestJet Larry S"
6498290,gordy28,2020-11-11 06:47:00,437,"Originally we booked West Jet for our flight home - about 3 weeks before our trip we got notices that our flights had been changed by a day - West Jet had cancelled the flight we needed. When I called I was offered a Friday or a Sunday flight or I could apply for a credit. IMO it should have been a full refund - West Jet changed/cancelled our flight so why shouldn't I get my money back - since I had booked with points there was only so much my travel agent could do - calls to West Jet were basically answered with ""We changed policy due to Covid"" Frustrating all around and from now on I will avoid West Jet when possible as well"
6498322,Mojo-NC,2020-11-11 09:29:00,1929,"We always book our flights as early as possible to make sure we all get seats on our preferred flights. We fly through Minneapolis/St. Paul (MSP), so the connecting planes from MSP to International Falls are small and flights get booked up pretty early. Even with all of our early planning, they usually change our flights (planes, flight numbers, and/or times) about a half-dozen times before our trip dates actually arrive. We now make sure to have the airline link all of us together at the time of our original booking so that if one itinerary is changed, all are changed accordingly. We have had the airline change our flights separately, and it was a painful experience to get everyone's schedules linked back together. We always have a least 4 guys traveling together on our trip. We've also flown directly to Winnipeg and then drove to Ontario, but getting out of Winnipeg is a PITA and the drive to Kenora is very boring. We prefer to go through INL and drive up to Dryden on our way to Ear Falls."
6498500,gordy28,2020-11-12 08:06:00,437,Linking the group is a great trip. I do not think we would have been able to on our recent trip as most of us booked with points through different credit card operators. But I am sure it would be solid especially if you are delayed - 1 phone call vs many Cheers Andrew
6498554,Mojo-NC,2020-11-12 10:51:00,1929,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by booking through different credit card operators. Were you referring to how you pay for the tickets? If that's the case, no problem. We use different credit cards too, and several of us also book our flights using points. The linking of the group is done directly through the airline, in our case Delta. All you have to do is get the confirmation numbers from everyone in your group once they book the original flights and ask the airline to group them together in the event of future changes."
6498620,phishfearme,2020-11-12 17:58:00,1242,"unless you have airline specific credit cards - we've used delta (for MSP and DLH), United (Thunder Bay and DLH) and American (DLH) - it's our experience that using airline specific miles is better financially and schedule wise than the credit cards that offer points (money) for you to use to pay for flights, although not by much. phish"
6498698,gordy28,2020-11-13 08:26:00,437,Sorry - my explanation wasn't clear. We used our credit card points to book our flights - so we needed to book through the travel sites or agents of the card companies not directly with the airlines. I think this meant we couldn't link together (I think) Although now I am wondering since we were all on the same flights if we couldn't have called Air Canada and linked - again great tip and thanks for any confusion
6498720,Mojo-NC,2020-11-13 10:18:00,1929,"No problem, I suspected that's what you meant. No matter which airline you choose, once your flights are booked, the airline should issue a confirmation number for the trip. That's what you use to link everyone together. All airlines should be able to do it, even if there's a connection where you switch carriers. We fly delta and they are notorious for changing our flight numbers and times several times during the 330 days between when we book and when we actually leave. Each time we receive a change notification, we confirm amongst the group that we were all changed the same. Good luck on your future trips. I hope next year is not another bust."
6496314,gordy28,2020-11-01 13:45:00,437,For our 2020 trip we tried something new - we flew commercially to Thunder Bay and drove to Sioux Lookout. For all of our other trips we had driven right to our jump off point It was something hotly debated within our group until we pulled the trigger but now that the trip is over and we are thinking about our next one I know what our preference is Pulled together the pros and cons for both in my (and the groups) humble opinion and posted it up https://www.northernjacks.com/post/d...n-fishing-trip Thanks for reading Andrew

6496662,phishfearme,2020-11-02 17:19:00,1242,"Andrew - first i hope that charter member Larry S responds as he and his sister have been flying to either TB or Winnipeg from Las Vegas to meet us for our annual flyin trip for years - i think he would provide positive feedback to your list of pros and cons and would probably be able to add to it. he carries a cooler full of dry ice and fillet steaks for our fist night in the bush and has found that car rentals are very reasonable and convenient. myself and my boat partner have been flying into either TB or Duluth from the Pittsburgh area for years but we have a secret weapon - one of our group members loves to drive and also drives a land yacht that can carry all our gear and dry food. thus we only need to fly with a knap sack for overnight gear then meet him at the airport to do the fresh food shopping. one comment/addition on your list - on two different trips, our return-to-civilization flight out of the lake has been delayed such that we had to drive hard all night to catch the commercial flight. this was quite stressful. if our return-to-civilization flight had been delayed further or even possibly forcing us to stay an extra night in the bush we would've missed the return flight and rebooking would've been very expensive if we could've gotten a reasonable flight at all. one other thought has occurred to us but we've not done it yet. at least three of our past outfitters would be glad to store gear for us over the winter (for a small fee) such that we could fly the next year with minimal gear. don't know about fellow WC members but my Canadian fishing gear is pretty much reserved for Canada and i don't really need to bring it back and forth each year. otherwise i think your list of pros and cons is quite good. phish"

Heck as it was we were perfect but did not have a lot of wiggle room to drive to T Bat, drop of rental and get to our flightAh - these trips are a lot of work lol So worth it but lots of logistics Andrew"
6496778,Mojo-NC,2020-11-03 07:40:00,1929,"Andrew, thanks for sharing. We too have been flying to Canada for every trip we've made since 2004. Driving for us is not an option, so I don't have any pro/con information to compare between those options. It does take a lot of planning, but everything has gone pretty well for us to date. I'm the logistics guy and coordinate the trip dates and deposits, and organize the flights, automobile rental, and hotel arrangements. Another guy specializes in menu planning, and he also assembles a grocery list to match the menu that he sends out for group review well in advance. We share our packing lists for required items. We have minimized the clothes that we pack, our rods/reels and tackle, and we try to avoid duplication of equipment like portable fish finders, and other sharable items like sunscreen and insect repellent, etc. We tie our rod carriers together so we can check them as a single extra item and share the expense. I do sometimes wish we could fish from our own fancy boats, but have decided that fishing out of camp boats and getting back to basics has become part of the allure of our week of fishing and spending time in the Canadian wilderness."
6496836,Larry S,2020-11-03 10:22:00,665,"As my fishing brother phishfearme has stated, I have flown or driven from Henderson, Nevada to Canada since 2001. . The first time I fished with phishfearme was in 2009. I drove to Duluth, Minnesota and met his group at the airport, left my car at the airport parking lot, it ended up costing $80 for 10 days. Drove again in 2011,met group outside Duluth at a Motel ,who allowed me to park in their parking lot until we returned. We stayed at Motel going and coming so motel made money .Several times when my sister lived in Wisconsin, before moving to Nevada,I met her at Minneapolis/StPaul Airport and we drove up to Canada meeting group in Thunder Bay Area before proceeding to destination I retired in 2011 and since I enjoy driving the 3 or 4 times driving to Canada has been OK. Now though since getting a bit older Flying is the way to go .I have flown into Thunder Bay or Winnipeg, rented a car and then met the group at various places. If you have a Costco Card I have found that renting a car through them is quite reasonable I now fly from Nevada All the time,rent a car and drive to where we fly out(We go on fly-ins all the time) Larry S"
6496930,RichA$1970,2020-11-03 17:23:00,1159,This is a good post and I’m glad to be in the 12-15 hour drive range to not have to worry about flying.
6496944,7 Mag,2020-11-03 18:10:00,1887,"Enjoyed the read Andrew, I’ve flown for hunting trips but never for fishing trips. Never put much thought into traveling on a commercial plane with my fishing gear."
