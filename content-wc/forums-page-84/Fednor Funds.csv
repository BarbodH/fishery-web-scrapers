6499442,fsz,2020-11-16 07:10:00,144,"LMBkillers post concerns me. âGlorious if a bunch of Americans can't get inâ Really? The current situation with border controls isn't fair. Canadian snow birds fly into to the US but Americans can't get into Canada. I own property and pay Canadian taxes and can't get in. Unless I'm misinterpreting, seems like some folks in Canada just want the border closed permanently. Loans and grants won't carry the outfitting industry. If a second year goes by and the border doesn't reopen. Bet at least 1/3 of the outfitters will go out of business. 85% of Canadian exports go to the US. Certainly over half of the revenue for the hunting and fishing tourism industry comes from Americans. How did we ever become the enemy?"
6499610,Obabikon,2020-11-16 16:29:00,2370,"This certainly has been a divisive issue. It's divisive within the US, it's divisive within Canada, and is is divisive from country to country. But, many people are trying to think logically. However, the extremists on each side are the only voices ever truly heard. If you are Canadian... and you want to keep the border closed forever, then you care nothing about your country or your fellow countrymen. You're selfish and short sighted. People's livelihoods are at stake. If you are a US citizen... and you want the borders wide open, and plan on not wearing a mask when you travel... you're also selfish and short sighted. People's health is at stake. Do your part, be considerate of others, but don't live in fear over this."
6499618,RichA$1970,2020-11-16 16:51:00,1159,Well said and sums it all up.
6499658,v-bay gord,2020-11-16 20:59:00,3168,"There is no role for extremists in this debate. When it is safe to travel, that's when the border should be open."
6499682,Pooch,2020-11-17 04:52:00,4618,"Agree 100%. ^^^ My wife and I just pulled the plug on our long time annual couple weeks in San Jose Del Cabo. We will most likely lose our private condo payment, but probably will salvage our airline expenses in the form of a voucher. We will lose our airport transportation money in Mexico, too. Like our Canada trips that were cancelled, voluntarily not recovering all of our money for the condo will help the owner stay in business so we can go next year and maybe many more after that. Same for the transport owners and drivers. This is the downside of booking a year in advance. Same deal as Canada camps though in the Mexico condo we paid the balance several months ago when it appeared the virus was possible waning. I was wrong. The thought of becoming ill in another country is not an experience I would entertain. There is little sacrifice involved on our part and helping other folks financially takes the sharp edge off of our lose. Hopefully I didn't totally hijack this thread, but I wanted to share and put some salve on my wife's and my fresh bruise. The upside is that we will put up a Christmas tree for the first time in fifteen years. The cat's gonna love that part..... We will be fine. Patience grasshoppers. Pooch"

6498886,RichA$1970,2020-11-14 06:14:00,1159,Sad but true and I feel for the tourist sector all over. I hate to see the line at the IF bridge if they require a rapid test as some will say F it n stay local.
6498898,Pickypickerel,2020-11-14 06:38:00,151,Remember what Forest Gumps mom told him ?
6498916,Lmbkiller,2020-11-14 07:42:00,639,"That will be glorious if a bunch of Americans stay local. There already was too many goin up there. If half of them stay south, I will be 4x as happy. Bring on the tests"
6498954,Obabikon,2020-11-14 09:33:00,2370,"It certainly isn't ideal, but I've been warning most of our guests that this could happen. Everyone I have talked to just wants to get up there, no matter what the hoops they need to jump through are."
6498982,RichA$1970,2020-11-14 10:55:00,1159,"I will bite the bullet and wait at the border but I suspect others won’t. Also, I wonder what rates will look like in 2022 as sometime they will have to recoup their losses or loan payments."
6498998,prov1800,2020-11-14 12:30:00,5010,Having the lakes i normally fish to myself this summer was incredible.Probably a once in a lifetime event i hope.Have to admit i loved it.In some cases you are right there are a lot of folks on the lakes here and would be much nicer to have less on a weekly basis but that wont happen.Sure hoping for a safe way to get across border next year.But the way the second wave is hitting canada you might not even want to come here
6499002,RichA$1970,2020-11-14 12:47:00,1159,That had to be awesome not dealing with traffic n like a kid in a candy store. Curious on Ontario in the spikes. Is it cases reported or deaths as the spike? It seems in the Midwest the cases are rising but don’t hear about the deaths or a breakdown of them. Our offices in the UK show a weekly bar chart with cases and deaths by 10 years n the majority of deaths are 80+ in years.
6499050,Pooch,2020-11-14 16:34:00,4618,I fish alone sometimes and being on LS alone and forty five minutes from camp I'm aware of the potential for grief in the back of my mind. Especially when there are not any boats where I'm fishing or few in the travel path to and from. But.... it is a nice experience once in a while to be just alone.Pooch
6499052,pjshorthorn,2020-11-14 16:59:00,5654,I had a solo trip scheduled for opening week this season. I do one about every 7-8 years and truly enjoy that experience. Getting to explore new places by myself everyday intrigues me. I get to really unplug from all things that life has sent my way and just recharge while being off the grid. Hope 2021 works because I have another solo trip scheduled for opening week again. I will say that it can get a little weird around day 5 when you haven't spoken a word to another person except for that little voice in one's head ( especially mine) . laugh: PjShorthorn
