6489318,MrSimon,2020-10-05 11:21:00,922,"I like to fly fish for pike in Canada as well! It's definitely a less efficient way to catch pike, but is sure is FUN! You do NOT need expensive gear. Just get a 7, 8, or 9 wt rod, floating line, toothy critter leader, and some big bright flies. I think I got a fully rigged Cabelas 8wt combo for about $200. Twitch the fly in and around weeds. You'll be hoot'n and holler'n before you know it!"
6489484,fishron,2020-10-06 09:47:00,317,Lot's of good advice and references here. My heavy flyrod experience is more with bluefish and stripers in the surf but a couple of things I might add. I go with an eight weight rod with a hefty weight forward flyline. I prefer tinsel or mylar flies that don't pick up a lot of water. In the surf I use a pickup basket for my flyline. In fresh water you don't have the waves coming in and out so you don't need one. Wear a substantial hat. Protect you head against a lazy forward cast. I wear a surf jacket also. You may do well with a heavy flurocarbon leader for pike. I use wire for blues. Have fun....stay safe. Ron

6489896,Palancar,2020-10-07 17:49:00,52,"It depends on whether you want to fly fish for pike or just catch pike [or walleyes] on a fly rod. Any kind of streamer on an 8' bass rod will catch pike. Throw it near a downed tree and hang on. If you like catching with a fly rod use the same 8' rod with a light spoon, say 1 1/2 inch, and troll. For both pike and walleyes, put an F4 flatfish on and an egg sinker a couple of feet up. Troll off the downed trees and over weeds. Sometimes you get a huge perch as well. That's fun! One year opening day on White Lake we took turns jigging a minnow. Everybody had 60 seconds to catch a walleye or put a Loony in the pot and pass the fly rod to the next guy. We bought a 5-gallon pail of minnows from some Indian kids onshore and quit about noon. Oh oh..I'm having an attack of Canada withdrawal syndrome.."
6494390,yoopertrout,2020-10-24 10:07:00,1172,"If the tie-able wire you use will fit through the eye doubled over, tie a big loop in the end of it and push it through the eye and pull it over the hook. You won't go through as much wire. If the loop is big enough, you won't have to get the knot through the eye. If the doubled wire won't fit through the eye, bring lots of it. With a knot on each end, it takes a pretty big chunk to make a tippet."
1273814,Hawker,2011-02-22 05:55:00,3967,"Typically, I personally don't have a lot of difficulty in finding some sort of a pattern each year on LOTW, finding and catching Pike on conventional casting and spinning gear and associated baits when we arrive at the end of May or first of June. Casting & spinning gear and the baits used are inside my comfort zone so that is what I use! This year is a little different though, as we are scheduled for the last week of June and have two gentlemen joining our little group that are from south Texas that really want to bring fly rods and want to try and catch Pike on them! I am certainly an alien in that realm (fly fishing) so I really have no answers for them when they call and question me in regards to fly patterns and sizes etc etc etc!!!!!!!!!!!! Neither gentlemen (both in their early 70's) are computer/internet savvy so I've taken it upon myself to try and help them in determining the best possible or most likely assortment of fly's to bring along to aid them in their quest! They both assure me they have all of the adequate size/weight fly rods, line & leaders they would need, but are in the dark (myself even more so) in regards to fly choices!! HELP!!!!Once again I seek assistance from the vast wealth of knowledgeable WC'rs that could or would assist me in helping to assist these gentlemen!! Area we will be fishing is Stevens Bay (Young's Wilderness Camp area) and maybe some on Whitefish. Time frame is the last week of June! Any ideas or help will be greatly appreciated, and if you prefer, you are welcome to either email me or PM me! ([email protected])Thank You in advance for any and all help or suggestions you can provide!!Tight LinesSteve (Hawker) King"
1273874,adempsey,2011-02-22 08:18:00,963,"I am by no means a fly fishermen, but recently I have been using flies to fish for pike. Honestly, they are pike and eat anything. I don't think you really need to worry about matching the hatch like they are trout.This is what I have used with success:http://www.reelflies.ca/PhotoDetails...Bunny-Pike-Flyhttp://www.reelflies.ca/PhotoDetails...stler-Pike-Flyhttp://www.reelflies.ca/PhotoDetails...Bunny-Pike-Flyhttp://www.reelflies.ca/PhotoDetails...Bunny-Pike-FlyI just bought a bunch more from the same store to try out this year. I also tied a bunch of my own recently. I guess they would be called streamers - bunny strips with marabou and flash.This is a good site to browse through: http://pikeflyfishingarticles.blogspot.com/Some gorgeous flies on it too!Oh, they probably want to use some leader material that you can tie like Tyger leader.Good luck!"
1273923,jsmyers,2011-02-22 09:47:00,198,"I would highly suggest getting this book as a basic to tackle and techniques:http://www.amazon.com/Pike-Fly-Flyfi.../dp/1555661130It should be a pretty good read for somebody who already fly fishes, but has never targeted pike. There is also a ""sequel"" that I haven't seen.Here is a quick In-Fisherman article on the subject:http://www.in-fisherman.com/content/die-little-flyI once made a disasterous attempt to cast a big perch patterned streamer on a cheap 6 weight fly rod for pike. I could only get it out about 15.' I got a follow from a nice fish, but I could get the fly back out to the fish when it turned around.Last summer I got a 9 weight so that I can catch my fist pike on a fly in May. I briefly used it on Labor day weekend, but I found that I need more practice. It is a lot harder to cast a wet strip of bunny fur than you'd think. My practice fly is now a strip of fabric from some old clothes.One interesting tidbit is that some of the best springtime pike flies are imitating leeches."
1274275,Guest,2011-02-23 07:50:00,0,"Early in the season, when pike are shallow, any brightly coloured streamer fly(yellow, red, orange) in the 3+""will produce. Make sure to use a flourocarbon leader or you will donate a lot of tackle. As the season progresses, you may need to hang your fly on a strike indicator as you work points and drop offs with a leech or minnow pattern. I suggest a large arbour reel in case you hook up a good one."
1274530,lassh,2011-02-23 20:33:00,553,"Bunny leeches, Marabou leeches, clousers, dahlberg divers, black streamers and chartruese/perch streamers are all good patterns."
1274868,tly,2011-02-24 18:38:00,1900,"Pete Maina, who has a magazine, videos & TV show recently had a TV segment on fishing pike with flies. It was a very interesting show. Pete is primarily musky/pike out of Hayward WI but the shows cover the world. I cannot recall the name of the show but I bet alot of other WC'ers can come up with it."

1275673,walleye_wal,2011-02-26 21:51:00,12,"Make sure they have fly rods that can handle a bigger fly. 8 weight or larger is big enough to throw the previous flies mentioned. I personally like lefty's deceiver minnows (4inches and larger), they are light and easy to throw. All the other fly work just fine but they are harder to throw with the lighter fly rods. The pattern I like to use is a unweighted fly, with a sink tip line. Find a weed edge and work the edge and into the weedbed. Flies can be surprisingly weedless. You might not get really big fish but you will have constant action with fish being low to mid 20's with a few in the 30's. Make sure you have a steel or titanium leader, and plenty of flies. Northern can go through flies very fast. I also recommend smallmouth bass fishing that time of year. You can use a lot of the same flies, but my favorite is a weighted woolybugger (pretty much as basic as you can get) An 18in smallie on a fly is a blast a lot more fun than pike in my opinion."
1275714,Hawker,2011-02-27 04:28:00,3967,"I've not been on here much since I posted this but I want to thank each of you for your tips, suggestions, links and most of all your willingness to help! I've gone to the links suggested and printed out the pages of fly suggestions & tips as well as each of your suggestions and forwarded the hard copies to the gents! From them I also pass along their thanks for your help!All that is left now is for the end of June to get here and see how well they do! Again, thanks WC'rs for coming through!!!"
6489272,zingerfishing1,2020-10-05 09:29:00,1,I steamer fish for pike and walleye often and there is lots of patterns that work well for them. Lead sink line is key though I found to get down to the bottom for those walleye. My fav is a small woolly bugger hand down.
