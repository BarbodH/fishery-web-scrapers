6496118,7 Mag,2020-10-31 18:03:00,1887,"Good pictures, looks like you have some good spots to hunt!"
6496124,prov1800,2020-10-31 18:36:00,5010,Its still pretty good here but not as good as 5 years ago.Bad winters kill a lot of deer here.Last year was pretty good so hoping for some more.Bucks rut to hard and then winter does them in.
6496188,RichA$1970,2020-11-01 05:01:00,1159,"Prov1800- Just a ? off this topic, but this passed year in your area in the lake was it around 90% down on traffic/pressure?We rotate our farm with around 1/5 of the woods off limits each year during deer season with no atv or any traffic after we bush hog in July and when we open it up that section the following year it is really good- just thinking about the lack of pressure in 2020 on the lakes."
6496190,mixedbag,2020-11-01 05:04:00,76,Yup your neck of the woods and Ontario lakes are one and the same..just like deer and walleye are cut from the same cloth... Prov 1800 has answers to all these well thought out questions.

6496274,bbheli,2020-11-01 10:08:00,1387,"You should come to my neighborhood. People have ben complaining about the deer in the yards, use to be one or two now they wake up and see a dozen, They are voting on adopting a sharp shooter program limited to the forest preserve grounds. Crazy."
6496312,prov1800,2020-11-01 13:37:00,5010,Dont think we will see much difference.Didnt see any change this summer.Fishing was normal as far as qaulity and qauntity.Might see a few more bigger fish as a lot of overs are still going to be swimming.There will be more catchable fish i imagine with no shorelunches and even very little local fishing depending which lake you went to.
6495880,prov1800,2020-10-30 15:51:00,5010,Ive been out ànd about taking care of a couple of deer blinds and doing some grouse hunting.Thought i would sent a few pics of what its looking like up here. Some small lakes are almost closed up where bigger lakes are somewhat open but shorelines are getting tightened up.Wont be much longer till we can get on the ice for some fantastic first ice fish.Weather has been in the -10c range overnights and 0--5 for daytime highs.
