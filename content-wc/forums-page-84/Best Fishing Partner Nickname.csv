6494680,SpokaneJim,2020-10-25 15:56:00,118,"Back in my very young days, my parents had a cabin in northern MN. After a morning of fishing my dad and I would normally walk over to our new neighbor's cabin and join in on the conversation around the fish cleaning table. The neighbors would always offer my dad a beer to which he would always reply ""No thanks, I have a half-can right here"". Time went by and after finally putting clues together from things heard over the VHF marine radio chatter while on the water, my dad finally figured out that he was the guy often referred to as ""Half Can"". More time went by before we figured out that since I was his son, my nickname turned out to be ""Quarter Can"", even though I was way too young to share such beverages with the guys at that time."

6495432,Grumps,2020-10-29 12:17:00,134,"One of my buddies has been known as ""Beagle Ears"" for going on 55 years. He thinks it is because of his ears but mostly it's because he was always the first one to go to sleep in our tiny camper. As soon as he started to snore someone would put peanut butter in or next to his ear and let in a flatulent/skunk scented beagle to clean him up.He would usually get mad and go sleep in the car. The rest of us were then able enjoy a restful evening."

Old Fritz who was a Korean War Marine Vet n I went to their room at 0500 to get going to Pickle Lake and Fritz opened the door to both Jason n Fred butt naked with their dates. Fritz in a raspy stern cadence addressed them as “The 2 inch Killer” and “Tripod” to get down to the truck in 15 minutes or we were leaving. The nicknames stuck with them, one very proud and one very short on their nicknames."

6491214,Crede,2020-10-12 15:22:00,134,"For our group, Bruce is now known as Jacques. After falling out of the boat while taking a leak he was briefly known as Jacques Brusteau. Now it's just Jacques."
6491688,emma17,2020-10-14 09:07:00,436,"It's not a nickname- but we use my son's name Kyle as a verb- as in, you just Kyle'd me, or, don't Kyle me, etc. Kyle is the guy that throws his line to the spot you just caught a fish, while you're taking the fish off the hook. Or if you turn to take a leak, he's Kyling your spot."
6491722,papadave,2020-10-14 12:04:00,151,"I took a friend on a Canada trip a few years ago. By the end of the trip the entire lodge was calling him Urkel. In case you don't remember that was the ""Did I do that?"" guy from a TV show. You had to be there to believe it. My friend actually made one cast that hooked the overhead phone wires ... while we were trolling! One morning he dropped his sunglasses in the water at the dock and then he and a dock boy spent two solid hours trying to get them out while I sat there waiting patiently to go fishing. He knocked off my biggest fish of the week with the landing net. He was getting out a worm and teetered the container on the edge of his seat. He bumped the container and dumped four dozen worms and their dirt all over my boat carpet. He stepped on two of my rods and broke the tips off. And the high point of his trip was fighting a really nice boulder one evening for ten minutes. By the end of the week the guys in the other boats were laughing so hard at all the carrying on in my boat they thought it was some kind of prank or something. They still like to remind me of the year I brought Urkel fishing."

6492174,bigwalleye1,2020-10-15 16:20:00,2632,"We had a guy with a sense of humor drier than a popcorn fart. Smilin' Bob. Along with his partner, we called them The Hardly Boys.....pretty unable to catch fish, even in Canada, or keep up, either on the road or on the water, but a couple great guys I'd like to take a trip with again."
6492240,Guest,2020-10-15 20:16:00,0,We picked up a band in St. Louis called a Normas Richard. We smoked a bunch of ganja and took them up to Canada we caught a lot of fish

The other is called a low life thief for stealing hot lures from his partners, he now mudt inventory every lure he brings. He is so upset , he was bringing us receipts. He still doesn't know that we were pulling a joke on him. Now he saves receipts for everything. Its funny to watch him, we were all set to let him know the real truth, but then, We couldn't get to Canada to it will have to wait till 2021. Had another one named clinton, we made him change his first name or he wasn.t going."
6490316,Ltrain,2020-10-09 08:11:00,4145,"We call my oldest brother Neil Peart or the shepherd, depending on the day, for his innate ability to always out fish us 10 to 1 in the sheepshead department. There are days where we might have 1 or 2 between my other brother and I and old Neil will have boated 8 or 10 of them already. Makes for a fun trip as he swears he's landing a fish ohio everytime, lol."
6490506,Habitual Eyer,2020-10-10 06:09:00,144,"My best partner...or assistant has always been my Terrova. I have named every Terrova over the years Igor (the goofy hunchbacked assistant from the Young Frankenstien movie). I am always talking to Igor. ""Igor...where you going?"". ""Igor...why wont you lock?"". ""Found fish..put Igor down"". Igor has been a very loyal and valuable assistant over the years. Always kept me on fish."

Generally when we fished it didn't take me long to get fankled Great thread - so far Deuce, Hamster and Pickle are favorites lol Andrew"
6490594,ackvil,2020-10-10 13:36:00,177,"We call one guy ""Lash."" He has been trying to cast a bait caster for about three years now. His first cast invariably results in a backlash which he then spends 30 minutes fixing."

We drop shot for crappies in 25-30' of water. Some days when the bite is on, we'll catch upwards of 100 fish per boat. We have one guy who really has the touch and usually catches more than any of the rest of us. We call him ""The Crappie Whisperer""."
6491122,mms3rd,2020-10-12 10:18:00,148,"Does, ""g..d... it Steve"" count? My son insisted on leaving the lid on his tackle box open and, yes, flopped every time; leaving half his lures on the deck and getting them snagged into the carpet; wearing basketball shorts and getting cold and wanting to go in; when fishing a shore line, he was in the bow and always threw back in front of me; too often got stuck in trees on shore and would pull the lure back at 100 miles an hour past my ear......and he out fished me every time (I put him on the fish while I messed with the motors!). He's now 35 and has moved to Washington State....would love to have him back."
