6493268,prov1800,2020-10-19 07:01:00,5010,Deçided to put boat away this weekend.Had to shovell a couple of inches out of it as we had some snow fall.Weather looks to stay colder now and to busy to fish anyways.Deer hunting will take over now.We got some moose Thursday and most likely today we will butcher them up. Have a couple of deer blinds to put in yet and bring in some propane bottles and heaters and chairs.Not easy to get stuff in to these places.Be a while yet before ice forms on lakes enough to go ice fishing.

6493302,prov1800,2020-10-19 09:22:00,5010,It seemed like a long fishing season here.When iam busy guiding it seems it goes by faster then when iam more relaxed. Have to admit i enjoyed it.Deer season will be good iam sure but lonely again as i won't have any hunters up.Got my spots baited up and some deer coming in.But ìam in no rush.Starts end of October so have plenty of time yet.Bears have stopped coming to the baits to.Thats a plus.
6493386,7 Mag,2020-10-19 16:02:00,1887,Dang bears get into everything! Looking forward to seeing some deer pictures!
6493392,Skywagon,2020-10-19 16:24:00,1106,Here's what they look like. These two have been hanging for a week now in the cold part of my shed.

6493460,prov1800,2020-10-19 21:16:00,5010,We got 2 small bulls last thurs and cut them up tonight.Plenty to eat this winter and should be adding some deer meat into the equation in a couple of weeks.Grouse hunting has also been very good.Lots of deer on trail cams.No bìg bucks yet.Plenty of time for them to show up.Ice is forming on lakes now so wont be long before we can get into that.Always exciting when the seasons change.
6493486,Eckohlt,2020-10-20 05:04:00,3685,Heaters n chairs?y not just go to a super 8 motel near a woods open a window and blaze away lol
6493504,prov1800,2020-10-20 06:31:00,5010,Haha.Sometimes that would be nice.
6493506,Skywagon,2020-10-20 06:31:00,1106,"We call them eaters also. Those two were shot by a friend and his wife, they were hunting for fun, but mostly to put some meat in the freezer, those deer are young enough they should make good eating for them There is still some moose meat left in our freezer from last year, so I have not bought a deer tag. We do keep three trail cameras out all year long just to see what is traveling through, but so far there have not been any bucks of note as of yet this season."
