6499592,goldman,2020-11-16 15:52:00,1036,Preparation H has worked well for me.
6499684,tv4fish,2020-11-17 05:09:00,2694,"As a kid ""down on the farm"" - my brothers and I had a place that we could also catch fish (not walleyes), but bluegills, sunnies, etc. on bare hooks. It was in an abandoned gravel pit that had been dug right alongside the Des Moines river. The pit had filled with water, of course, and that water was crystal clear. We could see the fish easily, and there wasn't much of a ""food source"" for them. All we had to do was drop a bare hook in the water and all those little guys would fight each other to get at the hook. Cheap way to get ""dinner"".."
6499352,Pickypickerel,2020-11-15 17:39:00,151,Have heard from some of my buddies that fish remote Canadian shield lakes that the walleye will hit a bare red Gamakatsu hook ????
6499358,Ndstallmann,2020-11-15 18:04:00,549,When I was a young man in iowa perch did that one day in early May. Back then it was just a hook.
6499362,Mojo-NC,2020-11-15 18:14:00,1929,"Fish will eat anything that they think might be food, and if it is not they spit it back out. Apparently hooks sticking through their lips are a little harder for them to spit back out. Thus the multi-gazillion dollar market for artificial baits."
6499366,Eckohlt,2020-11-15 18:26:00,3685,Next time I go to Ontario I'm taking a flat of gamakatsu hooks
6499384,Pooch,2020-11-15 20:08:00,4618,"I've been told that you need to keep them refrigerated in order for them to remain lively... Also, that a little dab of ""Dapper Dan"" hair gel works well to keep 'em fresh. Pooch"
6499420,eyecatcher1,2020-11-16 05:44:00,323,We have caught walleyes on cheetos when we ran out of minnows.
6499434,bigwalleye1,2020-11-16 06:59:00,2632,"I've caught walleyes on black licorice on a bet several times, much to the consternation of my ex brother in law"
6499458,Bill Krejca,2020-11-16 08:03:00,6107,"Yah. Sometimes, if you dress the hook with a single flamingo feather......... Bill"
6499460,Bill Krejca,2020-11-16 08:07:00,6107,"This seems true so many times, especially if may fish are congregated. I believe they are much more competitive if in a group, they try to get it before another does. When it is not so crowded, they may be a ""bit"" more selective. I call this selection/non selection process ""the boarding house reach"". Bill"
6499476,Mojo-NC,2020-11-16 09:37:00,1929,"When fish get into a feeding frenzy, they seem to eat just about anything. This past summer, my daughter and I were swimming in a shallow area beside our boat. My wife decided to throw in a handful of some crunched up stale crackers that we had forgotten in the glove compartment from our previous time out. It immediately attracted a big school of bluegills. Those fish got into feeding frenzy and started biting us too. We finally had to get out of the water."
