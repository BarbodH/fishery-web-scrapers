6499290,stjoeguy,2020-11-15 11:49:00,979,"#1 Going too fast and #2 Over Thinking are easy to speak of the remedy but difficult to implement: RELAX. Easier said than done. I agree and identify with #3 and #4. A good day should be defined by how much we enjoyed it, not how many fish were caught. That said, I carry a clicker (but probably shouldn't). The five minutes rule is also one I need to work on. It's too easy to say they were here last year and should be here again. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to work on #3 and #4 next year!"
6499312,RichA$1970,2020-11-15 12:47:00,1159,"#3 is a big No to me. I love hearing guys who double or triple click and then post 2,000 fish per week. These are the guys who probably have a hat or vest with a big “Master Angler” patch on it and 200 lbs of gear of which 90% is useless. I’d take quality over quantity any day and most people know a good days fishing vs bad."
6499348,Mojo-NC,2020-11-15 17:27:00,1929,"Andrew, you bring up some really great points. At one point or another, I'm sure we've all been guilty of the same ""mistakes"" you mentioned. I know I have. Here are a couple of additional things to consider for future trips. We like to try to focus on using a new technique (to us, that is) each trip, and we try to catch walleye or pike using something that is a little outside of our usual routine. One year it was experimenting with various slow death rigs. Last trip it was walleye fishing with the Ned-rig. I want to experiment with running floating crankbaits down deep using a 3-way. Maybe it's jigging or spinner rigging with plastics rather than live bait, or chasing suspended fish. The list can be endless, but it can make the trip more interesting. Find a ""new to you technique"" that sounds interesting and give it a shot. It may turn into one of your favorite ways to fish. Another thing that I've found that can be fun and interesting is rather than rushing to a specific location to fish, troll your way there, or at least part of the way there. I've never really been much of a fan of trolling, but when you're holding the rod in your hand when the fish hits, it can be very a different experience. One of us might choose a crankbait while the other uses a spoon. We keep mixing it up until we find one color or style that seems to work better than others. We try to pay attention to the depth and location of where we catch fish. It can be a really fun way to travel to your destination and we've also caught some very nice fish doing it. Something to think about. I'm always interested in hearing about how others fish using techniques that are a little outside of the box."

Funny enough I was great at the new technique thing on our first two fly ins - think the fishing was just so much better that I had confidence to try new things - then expectations got set lol I also love the idea of trolling to a new spot or around a new spot - one of my bigger walleye on our trip was caught trolling a Rapala J 13 for pike on a short line - the hit was awesome Cheers Andrew"
6499448,vteye3,2020-11-16 07:39:00,496,"Gordy - Great post about trips in general and how if we took 3-4 trips per year we would have plenty of time to relax. I understand how taking a big trip every couple of years tends to hyper experience. One thought is do you vary your trips? For instance my group takes long weekend trips a couple times of year, a week long trip about every other year and then a big trip every 3-5 years. Second being the logistics guy on an Aug 2020, 85 mile unguided float trip I try to delegatecertain tasks. One guy was designated cook an became responsible for all things food related.Yes lots planning assistance it was the cooks first float trip but worked perfect. Another guy became head oarsman of boat #2 which meant he did all the rowing the first 4 days.He again was inexperienced but a couple of days of easy rafting allowed him the chance to get acclimated and did fine when we entered the white water stage. We then had a young buck whose job was to pick up the slack when the older farts tired. He did not row the first couple days and thus was expected to have plenty of energy setting up camp, firewood, etc. Did we go too fast at times yep, over think not really, chase numbers at times within reason,slow to adjust just once in 9 days during torrential rain. Every two years, as I started with I wish I could afford to do a big trip 3 or 4 times a year but the smaller 4 day weekends helps one focus and saves my marriage."
6499630,gordy28,2020-11-16 17:58:00,437,"Thanks for the detailed reply - we have tried to vary our trips - for 2021 I think we are planning a paddling trip somewhere closer to home (Toronto area) It will be light on fishing but long on companion ship! For our 2020 trip my brother stepped in and did most of the communication with the lodge while I focused on meal planning, shopping lists and gear stuff (and research - I love the research part) I would also love to make these an annual thing but for now its tough to get away and maintain a healthy home and work balance as well Cheers Andrew"
6500530,gordy28,2020-11-20 12:49:00,437,"Phish - our group always takes a moment to relax and have a beer right after the plane leaves us - you either PM'ed me the suggestion or I read it in one of your threads ahead of our first trip and its now a tradition of ours - so thanks for that! I may have even said ""theres this guy with the handle phish...) Cheers Andrew"
6500532,gordy28,2020-11-20 12:52:00,437,Funny - that's my thought process sometimes - I am going to leave here just as a school moves in lol I prefer action as well - I know I dont put enough time into big pike - I would love to crack 36 inches but I also hate the nothing in between or wading through a sea of snot rockets to try for one
6500598,phishfearme,2020-11-20 20:15:00,1242,"Andrew - yah, that very well coulda been me - we've been doing that ""tradition"" for many years. it just seems so appropriate - when things go from rush, rush , rush - loading, then unloading, hauling stuff, etc. - then the plane roars off and it's just seems like a moment of silence is called for. we just hope we can do it again next summer. thanks for the kind words, phish"
6500676,gordy28,2020-11-21 12:50:00,437,Was sage advice. We use it as a moment to relax and time for our “no one is anyone’s mother but be safe cause it’s a long plane ride home if we need it”I truly hope everyone can get back here in 2021 for their mental health and the many lodges and business owners who rely on our neighbours in the US for business Cheers Andrew
6500724,PA troutguy,2020-11-21 18:15:00,58,"I typically fish alone up North and concentrate on pike, bass and musky. One thing I have found to help enjoy the day is at lunch or whenever the urge strikes I just sit in the boat let the wind take me where ever and enjoy the scenery. I once stopped the boat when and eagle landed on the water like a duck, between two loons. In a bit it took off I guess it was looking for a loon chick for breakfast. Saw a wolverine on shore one day, in my mind it is stopping to enjoy those seldom seen wildlife events that help to make the trip fun and relaxing. The fish will still be there 10 minutes from now. Just my two cents."
6500798,pjshorthorn,2020-11-22 06:44:00,5654,I couldn't agree with you more. I have been known to just put my rod down for an hour and just take in all of the surroundings. I enjoy taking pictures during that time and then remembering the experience when reviewing them after I get back home. Lots of good memories have been made by taking a break. PjShorthorn
6501026,eyecatcher1,2020-11-22 15:37:00,323,"I agree! When we first started going to the Sioux Lookout area 28 years ago there weren't any good maps and GPS wasn't what it is today, so we went to an American Plan Resort with our own boat. The resort was great! We did that for 4 years and learned our way around and switched to another resort that had housekeeping cabins. There were also better maps by then and GPS was getting better. At first we'd get there, fish for our dinner and have shore lunches just like at the other resort. After a while we decided that we were like on a schedule just like at the other resort. Now we get up when we want to, fish when we want to and don't do shore lunch anymore. We pack a lunch and just sit back and enjoy the scenery. We do have fresh fish for dinner though almost every day. We also get there, unpack, have a few beers, put a steak on the grill and relax. We're much older now and that's a better way for us. We do fish the rest of the week though."
6499838,phishfearme,2020-11-17 13:41:00,1242,"about your #1 point - going too fast - we also have the same level of excitement you mentioned but our group has implemented two ""traditions"" for our fly-in that i think help ""relax: 1 - just after we arrive at the cabin and unload the plane, as soon as the plane roars off we make a point to stop everything and just listen - listen to the quiet and silently contemplate the wonderful week ahead. 2 - our cabin arrival flight typically gets us into camp before noon - so after doing #1 above and unpacking, putting stuff away and assembling rods/reels, we sit down to a warm lunch. we usually have ""lunches-out-of-a-can"" while out on the lake so it may be the only warm lunch of the week. sloppy joes or chili cheese brats while discussing the plan of attack for the afternoon and also discussing happy hour/dinner plans and schedule. phish"
6499856,Mojo-NC,2020-11-17 14:42:00,1929,"Great suggestions. Where we stay, we're asked not to arrive on Saturday morning before 9:00. We do most of our travel on Friday, but would get up early and finish our drive from Dryden, timing it so that we would arrive at the lodge at exactly 9:00. We would check in, unload our vehicles, get all of the food put away, unload our gear, call dibs on our room/bed, slam down a quick lunch, assemble our fishing equipment, and tie on our rigs. It was a rush to get-r-done and get out on the lake. We even had a contest for first walleye in the boat. We would fish hard and keep enough eaters for a walleye dinner that night. Everyone was on a mission to catch fish. It was still fun, but it did set a rather intense tone for the week ahead. I like your plan better. We should follow your traditions listed above and have a new rule, no one on the lake before 2:00 pm. We also used to get up each morning and have a large group breakfast. The early risers would have to wait around for all of the others to get up. By the time we actually got out there, the winds would have generally picked up from the water like glass surface we had at daybreak. We now make a plan with just our fishing partner for the day. We decide if we want to fish early, or sleep in a bit. When we do get up, we make coffee, maybe have a snack, and discuss our plan for the day. We fish until about 9:30 or maybe even as late as 10:30, and then come back and make a nice breakfast. That in itself has made it a much more relaxed week."
6500480,stumcfar,2020-11-20 08:07:00,451,"Failing to adjust is a big problem for me. I always think, what if we leave a spot and they turn on 5 minutes later. This is one area I am going to definitely work on. I will admit, I am a numbers guy. Not for counting and bragging, but you put me on a spot where I can catch 16'-20"" walleyes, I am in heaven. I go fishing to catch fish. I have caught a quite a few big fish in my life, and it is a thrill, but chasing around trying to catch a 30"" instead of having the fun of feeling the bite and boating fish is not what I am about. Everyone has there own feelings on this and that is great. For me a once a year trip to Canada is to put as many fish in the boat as I can."
