6492562,Skywagon,2020-10-16 15:41:00,1106,"When I checked the weather yesterday morning the temperatures forecast for overnight were a few degrees below freezing, I thought it might be prudent to make an unscheduled trip to the cabin to pull the water pump from the lake and drain the water lines. I knew we would be going up to moose hunt again in the coming week and was hoping to have running water, oh well. I took the slow mode and drove up, as the radar was showing some sort of ""stuff"" that might be better not to risk flying through. A hour past Sioux Lookout the ""stuff"" on the radar had turned into snow flurries, by the time I was on the 4-wheeler driving to the lake the ground was white. After boating down the lake to the cabin it was past 4:00, I started a fire in the wood stove and began the process of pulling the pump, then draining and capping all the water lines. By the time that was done I was ready to get out of the cold and fix something warm to eat. There were flurries overnight and the deck was white again this morning after having swept it off last night. Before leaving the cabin this morning to head home, I decided to leave the minnows in the bucket that had been floating by the dock for 3 weeks (still good) and to leave the 2 containers of night crawlers that were in the propane fridge. I am hoping the next time we go up, the weather will be a little better and if so, hopefully we can get out one last time to chase a walleye."
