For years we had used older Eagle Cudas but I always dug into threads on this forum and others about newer models On our Root Bay trip this summer 3 of the members of our group had bought the Humminbird Helix 5 portables (one of our retailers had a good sale) Leveraging our experience that week and some of the guys experience using the units in their kayaks or personal boats I put up a reviewhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/p...ps-g2-portable Thanks! Andrew

I agree the fish finder is critical but doesn't need all the bells and whistles I want depth for sure, water temp is nice and the rest is just gravy. I have two older Eagle units that run on AA batteries - I now use one on my kayak and the other when I go to the cottage (none of my FIL boats have sonars) and they do the trick Cheers Andrew"

Well, maybe so, but the side-scan and autochart live features on my Helix 5 are so incredibly useful that they have doubled or tripled my catch rates from when I used a standard sonar unit. Not to mention GPS tracking and waypoints. For the guys still using a 12 year old black and white unit .... upgrade for Christmas, you'll be so glad you did."
