6493054,prov1800,2020-10-18 11:05:00,5010,About as low as ive ever seen it.Boating wise and fishing doesnt seem to have any effect on the lake.A few spots you would have to be carefull with.I just winterized my boat yesterday.we have a couple of inches of snow this morning and have ice forming on the shorelines. Time to call it a year and get into deer hunting.Had a succesfull moose hunt on Thurs so thats a wrap to.Got some walleye and crappies in freezer till we get enough ice to drill some holes.
6490428,prov1800,2020-10-09 14:48:00,5010,Got out late this morning.Launched boat around 10.Ran straight to east end to find some some.Always best early i find.Found them in 2 spots.Pretty deep at 32 ft.Hoped it was crappies as if i would of pulled up a walleye I'd be out if there. But they were all crappies so fished each spot a while and did real good.Today they didnt rush up but just stayed on the bottom and you had to just jiggle the jig a very tiny bit or they wouldn't touch it.Glad i had a st.croix today to feel that tiny tick.Moved on the some other spots i bit shallower in around 25 ft and caught some real nice walleyes and bass were on a feed bag today.Mixed in with walleyes but way more aggressive. Caught a ton of them.Beautifull day at 6c this morning.Got sunny and then cloud at noon.Got a call from a farmer my hog was ready to pick up at 5 so called it a day at 1:30.Was almost out of minnows anyways.Wasnt many in any tank at clarks.Took me a while in minnow shack to come up with about 5 doz.Got my fishing fix in kinda needed a day out.

6490466,prov1800,2020-10-09 20:16:00,5010,We will enjoy good for another year.
6490470,prov1800,2020-10-09 20:23:00,5010,The walleyes and bass very aggressive but crappies very light bite.Had to wait a few seconds before lifting rod.But fun day.Got super windy again.Bumpy ride back.
6490484,Eckohlt,2020-10-10 03:28:00,3685,"Nice to have so many grocery stores in the area,just have to choose which lake your going to get supper at"
6490598,prov1800,2020-10-10 14:27:00,5010,Have a bunch of lakes to choose from but Cedar Lake is 15 minutes from my house.Easy launch and dont have to go far except if a guy wants crappies then you need to travell 15 mi.So thats a no brainer.
