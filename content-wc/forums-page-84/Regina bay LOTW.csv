6493628,Mattymo,2020-10-20 16:17:00,16,Been looking for a family resort on lake of the woods that my wife would enjoy going to. Been looking at sioux narrows area. I have never fished that part of the lake. Anyone have experience fishing it?
6493670,AMPHIB206,2020-10-20 18:33:00,191,https://visitsunsetcountry.com/accommodation-finder Youngs wilderness camp is great. Secure parking with a 5 minutes boat ride to their island camp. Crappie to Musky. It's very clean.

If you are looking for a really great fishing experience and good accommodations,try Witch Bay Camp which is approx. 20 miles north of Sioux Narrows."

Short walk to the lodge for some of the best eating this side of anywhere, and a staff that are always friendly, helpful and eager to please. Majority of the boats are now G3's powered by 4 stroke Yamaha's, foot controlled trolling motors and Lowrance units with good lake maps and GPS. Perry & Carol (owners) are wonderful people and run an excellent camp for families, large and small groups! Well worth checking out!!"
