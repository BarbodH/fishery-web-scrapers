I am just starting into fishing and have done mainly carP with a cane pole but I would like to get into walleyes. Is there any website you can suggest that I can learn how to become a master"
6492248,h8go4s,2020-10-15 20:30:00,1673,The InFisherman websitehttps://www.in-fisherman.com/listing...-walleye/83206
6494120,gordy28,2020-10-23 08:33:00,437,I am a big in fisherman fan as well as a big Gord Pyzer fan (he sometimes writes for In Fisherman) I find most of his articles here https://www.outdoorcanada.ca/author/gordpyzer/ Note its multi species but he certainly covers walleye a lot Cheers Andrew

6494348,rswan,2020-10-24 08:57:00,91,"I'll second Tom Boley. You can learn a lot from that dude quick. From sonar interpretation, where fish may be(fish always get a say in the matter), presentation. Great videos."
6494584,Bill Krejca,2020-10-25 08:39:00,6107,"I believe this site is pretty close to ""best info site"". I suggest going back and doing a history search on here, there are lot of very good tips, which should give a well rounded very lengthy study, plus no one here is trying to sell you anything. Much. Bill"
6494612,That Minnesota guy,2020-10-25 09:36:00,8293,I agree.....just go back 10 or 15 years. Todays site is just a bunch of guys with nothing else to do. You will get some good info if you ask the right question. Don't bother asking about brands. It's completely whatever the responder is using or owns at that particular time. Techniques have all been covered yearly. Just do a search. Want good info here you need to go back to when the original group was here.
6495036,fishingMN4eyes,2020-10-27 10:53:00,108,"https://targetwalleye.com/I believe it's Brett McComas does most the info gathering and write-ups. But he pulls info from guides and experts. Usually there will be a short quote with highlights and then he will share a link to a full article or video. Some of it is straight up advertising for tackle/gear but it usually comes with useful tips and tricks. He also follows some tournament results and will share some quotes from the winning anglers with techniques that helped them catch fish.If nothing else, I know I enjoy(or sometimes hate out of jealousy) the emails with the ""eye candy"" pics. Lots of big walleye pics which is fun to see."
6495074,stjoeguy,2020-10-27 14:41:00,979,I second the recommendation to sign up for the Target Walleye email. It's a quick read with the usual great walleye pictures and some humor thrown in. Also check out Brett McComas's youtube videos. He has so much fun catching burbot that it convinced our group to try targeting burbot last March and we had a blast.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baIz...WwMrG&index=29https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-L...WwMrG&index=15
