Florescent green/chartreuse or yellow work well for us. We do most of our fishing in fall though. Al"

Spinner colors; silver, red/white, orange/black, or some type of chartuese sparkles. If the bite is so good that you can't keep the crawlers on I will switch to salted minnows. Most of the time using just a half of a crawler works best to prevent the short hit and generally the smaller the crawler the better."

I´ve caught fish on almost all types of presentations there, from spinner rigs, crankbaits, jigs, and so on. I have my favorite spots to fish, I just want to find something a little more exciting than pulling a Lindy around the lake. BTW I know it depends on weather situations, time of year etc. I´m looking for a go to bait for the end of June."

I fish gullrock almost every day I can, since I live on the lake and use minnows and a spinner almost exclusively. I will try to jig with a minnow if I get into a spot that I can't control the boat with my trolling motor but I never get the amount of fish that I do on a spinner. That said, this year at christmas I got some ""gulp alive"" and that is going to be the thing I try this year."

570407,dirt,2008-01-04 01:48:00,144,"Thanks for the reply, I agree with the live bait thing. Seems like you always have to have some kind of meat on your line to hook walleye up there. I just wanted to make sure I wasn´t missing out on anything. I´m curious about the new Gulp alive as well. I´ll probably taking a bucket up with me when I go."

570431,Guest,2008-01-04 17:25:00,0,I'm a jig and minnow guy. 1/4 oz white jig with red and black eye. I double-hook the minnow on the jig and can often catch 4 or 5 walleyes per minnow.

570461,Guest,2008-01-06 12:51:00,0,"I've been going to Gullrock for several years now. My best bait has been nightcrawlers on a plain hook, just keep it as close to the bottom as you can. If theres a weed line I run some crankbaits on the edge but be ready for some big pike. I also have been using the gulp baits and have had great success with them . When the crawler bite has slowed I'll switch to the gulp baits, minnows leeches or crawlers and the action picks back up. I can usually catch anywhre from 3 to 7 fish on a gulp bait before its destroyed. I also use gulp baits if I get tired putting on new crawlers after every fish. Good luck W. P."
