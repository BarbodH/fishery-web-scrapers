569868,fishinnut,2007-11-25 09:30:00,642,My son just applied and was told that the wait for the passport is down to 6-8 weeks.
569874,Guest,2007-11-27 09:08:00,0,"I was told the wait was 4 to 6 weeks. I got mine in 3 weeks. BTW, the notarized letter from the ex or nontraveling parent(s) granting permission to travel to and from Canada for a stated purpose and period is a good idea. I suggest that you also add a sentence to the letter allowing the adult to seek necessary medical and dental care for the minor."
569961,fishinnut,2007-12-08 21:34:00,642,Looks like the passport requirement for land travel has been set back till Summer of 2008.

570248,fishinnut,2007-12-20 07:54:00,642,Received the passport in 13 days. Might be a good time to apply if you need one.
570258,Guest,2007-12-20 20:39:00,0,I applied 2 months ago and got mine in 4 weeks. My brother applied 15 days ago and got his today. Must be a good time to apply now.

The rest of you folks all did a very fine job explaining that Americans don't need them to travel (by land) to and from Canada. That simple id's will suffice at this time.

569755,Guest,2007-11-06 14:54:00,0,Yep. I highly suggest the noterized letter. I traveled to Canada this past Summer and the custom agent started asking my 8 yo son a ton of questions about mom/why he was here/etc and I handed the agent the letter and he actually thanked me for making his job easier. My son was so freaked he couldn't even remember where he lived... Anything to make those guys happy and keep kids safe is the way to go. Brett

569852,FJH1,2007-11-21 14:59:00,2306,"Just out of curosity, why not get the kids passports nonetheless? Our daughters (8 & 11 years old) have had them for years and it just makes it so easy if you want to take a trip where you will need them. For example, this August I was scheduled to go to Silver Water Wheel Lodge in Canada with my buddy. Three days befor the trip my buddies father was involved in a horrible car accident (he eventually passed away as a result). However, because of the accident there was no way my buddy could go on the Canada trip. I took my 11 year old daughter and we had an outstanding time. She has a passport (we also had my wife write a letter, however, this was never needed). We passed through the border crossing both ways with virtually no questions asked. We had another time where we were sick and tired of Chicago winter and we booked a last minute trip to the Carribean - since we all have passports this was possible. Since it sounds like you have time before your trip I'd say to just get passports. Just my $.02 Best Regards, FJH"
569662,Walleye_Slayer,2007-10-26 20:32:00,134,"I know this has been beat to death. Went and got them for me and the wife. question is does anyone know what the age cutoff for kids needing one to go to canada and come back to the us starting next year. I am pretty sure by air everyone needs one, I was just wondering about driving back in if it would be age 16, 18 or all ages need one.

569666,Dipstick,2007-10-27 19:11:00,101,"The common misconception is that Canada requires visitors by land to have a passport. The truth is that the US will require its own citizens to have a passport to return by land or water. Many US threads on this Canada/passport issue give the impression that Canada requires the passport. As a result, I have read on such sites that US fishermen/hunters were not going to come up to Canada this year. Unfortunate for the camps and the fishermen/hunters who will miss out on a good experience. Tight Lines"
569667,Walleye_Slayer,2007-10-28 08:30:00,134,"if you read the thread I said to go and come back, i didn't just say go to Canada Don't start an argument on who is asking for what all I asked was an age question.

569670,Guest,2007-10-29 05:12:00,0,"Actually you did say 'go to canada' and by asking this question on the Canada board it does also imply that you are asking this of Canada. There are no requirements for passports here from US citizens, but it sure makes your trip a lot quicker. I don't know what the child requirements are from our government. We still drive into the US with only drivers licenses shown as ID. But I also carry a passport."

Come on bigfish...you left out the rest of his sentence where he DID say, ""and come back"". And, he asked on the ""Canada"" board, because if he didn't we would probably have moved it here anyway. But, does it really matter?:confused: Let's not get technical on the guy about how he worded his question.Sheesh! That's just being argumentative.:shame: Thanks, Juls"
569686,bigfish1965,2007-10-31 10:18:00,3210,"Sorry... But I certainly did enjoy the spanking you just gave me Juls. :thanks2: Guess I'm getting freaky in my old age !! Back to the point..I don't even know if there are passports for small kids since the picture would be fairly useless after about 6 months. Check with US Customs to see what they require for a return trip home. Likely a birth certificate would suffice. If your child does not have the same last name as you, and isn't accompanied by both parents, be prepared for a world of red tape coming into Canada. They are very, very strict about that since lots of non-custodial parents try and kidnap away to Canada."

569690,daamodt,2007-10-31 20:23:00,11,"I'll be bringing my son and his stepson to Canada this summer. We'll have passports, but what documentation is necessary from the boy's mother allowing the stepfather permission to bring the boy across the border to fish? Would a certified letter do? Anyone have a form letter to share? Thanks in advance."
569693,Guest,2007-11-01 09:47:00,0,"My friend took his 13 year-old son with us this past summer. I advised him to go to the local driver's license bureau. For a few bucks they will provide an official photo ID. This is a pretty common request, since kids need a photo ID even to fly commercial in the US. He also got a notarized letter from his ex, which just stated everyone's full names, their relationship, and the fact that she gave permission for this travel, including the travel dates. Then no one questioned anything at the border anyway, but I'd do it again, especially in the case of a step-child, where the last names are different."
