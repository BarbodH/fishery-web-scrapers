570352,Guest,2008-01-02 12:09:00,0,What are your opinions of the bait available in n.w.o. Last year our resort was out of minnows by the afternoon. If you got them in the morning early they were nice. They catch their own minnows and leeches. The leeches were really nice...but when we bought them at a different bait shop they were small and died quickly. Where is the best place to buy bait?? Thank you.

For the guys in our group that need the confidence of some meat on their jigs, we salt/sugar minnows that we purchase in bulk (either half or full gallon). Just put 1/3 cup salt and 1/3 cup sugar in quart ziplock along with 1 1/2 cups of minnows. Close ziplock and shake to mix the salt and sugar around in the ziplock. Then, freeze them. Then, take a bag or two each outting. These work well when trolling spinner rigs, too."

570374,Guest,2008-01-03 00:37:00,0,"I'm going to use preserved minnows,they are easy to keep,store,use.They are stiff as a board but they hold up great on a jig or spinner rig, don't get mushy on hot summer days and they caught as many walleyes as live bait.No more lugging bait buckets down to the lake. Just put a couple of dozen in a zip lock bag and put in your tackle box.I tried 2 dozen last year, this year I'm buying bulk-120 for $12 or so from Cabelas. Terry"
