570530,tly,2008-01-05 20:21:00,1900,"It is human nature. I have a self contained storage system that holds 8 2 piece St Croix's, several tackle boxes and still weighs in at < 30 lb. I use only specific baits, win, lose or draw, and on the whole they do not exceed 1/4 oz. Your tackle is mass, not weight unless you are into bottom bouncers or heavy stuff. It may be a status thing but you can only use x lures at a time and I am not smart enough to know which one of many will work at any given time. I have over the years moved least used stuff to other boxes so if there is a special requirement still am covered (if I know beforehand). May take me a few more minutes to rerig from storage but am not tripping over x # rods and tackle boxes, nor as open to folks 'borrowing' stuff"
570453,lobo1,2008-01-06 03:44:00,734,"one year my tackle boxes weighed in at 31 pounds! we had an otter that year with only a few guys so weight restrictions were out. i use the same white or metallic gold jig heads with white powerbait twisters every year in the same size, take a few spoons and a few rapalas or bombers and I am set. i guess we only use all the other stuff when we start to have contests etc on how many diff lures you can catch fish on etc. i widdle it down when going to a place a 2nd time for sure."

570454,Guest,2008-01-06 06:57:00,0,"This year I downsized and went with a small tackle bag with Jigs, spinners and weights and a few of the proven lures and spoone that I have used in the past. As I was about to leave, I got nervous that I would not have the right lure for every possible circumstance and brought the big bag. It weighs a ton. And it does not include my salmon stuff or my panfish/wisconsin walleye equipment. I have way too much crap!!!!!! I just never want to be caught without that one thing I might need."

570297,thunderatwork,2007-12-26 08:06:00,79,"Why do we take 40# tackle boxes to fly-ins. Every year i take a little less, but it still seems i take 80% of stuff i never use. Jog heads and five od diamonds is all I need"
570301,Muskygary,2007-12-26 12:20:00,137,But were never sure. Just maybe this is the year for harnesses or cranks. What happens if we break a couple of rods? Better take extra and so it goes!
570315,bigbuck,2007-12-27 13:04:00,69,Bring it all and have everything at hand. Not enough tackle at a fly in would surely make the week miserable.
570323,AllenW,2007-12-28 07:35:00,11482,"It seemed to be a cycle, keep adding the latest, greatest piece of tackle until after loading it all in the boat, there's no room for people anymore, then spending a afternoon downsizing to the point you only have to drag one or two tackle boxes along. But like already said, for them trips to somewhere there's not a tackle store close by, better to much than not enough. Nothing like 10 tackle boxes, 15 rods and 3 people in a 16' boat..:) Al"
570328,Guest,2007-12-28 11:17:00,0,Dont forget to mention the fustrated outfitter or pilot who keeps telling us to trim down our gear each year instead we bring more.
