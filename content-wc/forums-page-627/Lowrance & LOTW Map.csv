It had a lot of detail but seemed to be very inaccurate. The Navionics chip seemed to be more accurate for your area."

570403,Guest,2008-01-03 20:58:00,0,Does anybody have an opinion on a good map/chip to add to the lowrance 520c for Canada LOTW?

I will add one thing, don't always trust the map chip on that lake. They are petty accurate but you sometimes have to use your own judgement."

570413,MTJ,2008-01-04 08:50:00,106,"I have never used the Lakemaster on the Ontario side of LOW so I cannot give you a fair comparison. I do, however, run the HotMaps® Premium Lake Of The Woods +2K and it's pretty good. I would not trust the gps to navigate with but along with a good paper chart it is very helpful. It is very useful when attempting to find reefs. It has also Just my .02"

570428,Guest,2008-01-04 14:57:00,0,"Thanks! I just wanted to get the latest. I did find out from Navionics that the 2008, 2007 Premium and the LOTW +2K chip is the same data for LOTW on the CANADA side. So it does not matter which one I have for Canada, but for the US LOTW it does matter. In any case I will use it carefully as I know it is not accurate and not safe for navigation. My desire was to get the latest to be able to locate reefs,general location and depths, and of course mark those great walleye spots for next time :) Good luck fishing!"
