I am going to stay at Cherob's the second week of June 08. Any information would be helpful, first time on Lac Seul. Any info on bait, GPS spots, fishing areas in general, any bays or island spots, fishing by the sanctuary, etc. I would appreciate any information. I would share info when I get back. Anyone feel free to join in even if you are not mercuryguy. Pete[email protected]"

There are a lot of good spots locally, but there are a lot of great spots with the use of some gas. Jig and minnow. Bring lots of jig heads. I liked emerald green, but I don't think it really matters. 4/6/8 pound test. Don't ignore the smallmouth fishing. Pike are readily available as well. You should catch everything on the jig/minnow. PM me if you want some hot spots. Good choice on lakes. You will love it and will be spoiled."
