570345,Lazy Fisherman,2008-01-01 13:34:00,276,Has anyone fished this lake? We are primarily walleye fishermen. Looking at a trip with Rusty Meyers Flying Service in August. Any info would be appreciated.

It seems somewhere on that lake they caught walleyes 60 feet down in the hot weather. This was several years ago-six to eight i think. And the old friend has gone to my direct competition to work, hence i have not really talked to him in five years. A few more northerns than mount-airy or metionga lakes(I've fished both) which are ,I believe, the same water just upstream."
