570430,Guest,2008-01-04 17:16:00,0,Fishing stuff is not a felony except in the eyes of some tree huggers. One of our party was charged last year because of extra lines. He had been cleaning up in the ice shack and buddy had put his lines out for him but didn't tell him. He then started jigging and.....

570394,Guest,2008-01-03 17:34:00,0,"I have just read how new technology is keeping more Americans with a DUI or other felonies from entering Canada. I had a ticket for being one and a half fish over the limit. All subsequent fines were promptly paid and the proper amount of guilt has been suffered. (Before you get on your high-horse, one of our group didn't tell the rest of us that he didn't fry up all of our little fish and put them back in the cooler - he no longer comes along.) Is this an offense that might get me turned back at the border?"

570395,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-01-03 17:58:00,116,"A lot has to do with the ""number of offenses"" and how old they are. You may want to check out a person named Lucy Perrillo at Border Crossing Services. I cant find the number at this time, but try the internet. She has been recomended by many. From what I've learned, one minor offense will not keep you from crossing. With 1 DWI you should be able to cross if it's over 5 yrs from the end of the suspended period. I say that because they consider that a major offense, I doubt yours is. Also, here's the numbers for 3 border services: Ft. Frances 807-274-3655 Rainy River 807-852-3341 Pigeon River 807-964-2093 Hope that helps, Rose"

570404,KidWalleye,2008-01-03 23:04:00,557,You will have no problems... I at one Time had lost my hunting and fishing privileges in North Dakota and No other states will let you fish or hunt there either. So I made many phone calls all over Canada and was told that that is not a problem. They do not consider that to be a major offense... I have been fishing more in Canada now then I do in North Dakota. Its not that much farther to Raferty or last mountain than it is to the nearest useable ramp on sak Lost my privileges because a friend had borrowed a 22 mag and got caught poaching with it... They charged me with conspiracy to kill big game animals and took my hunting and fishing privileges for 3 years. wanna talk about pissed off!!!!! Gary
