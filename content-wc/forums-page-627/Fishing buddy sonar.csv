Not user friendly if more than one guy wants see it. Came home, returned it and bought a portable Lowrance. Eight ""D"" batteries have lasted for two seasons (weeks). Its pretty much left on for eight hours a day."
570588,lassh,2008-01-08 18:15:00,553,I agree with Rcrouse. My Dad brought one up on a fly-in and it was not worth the weight and hassle. I caught a lot of fish while he was fiddling with that thing. A regular depth finder is preferable. There are several models that use D or C cells. Get a black and white one so it doesn't draw as much amperage.

Ordered a eagle portable, can't rember the modle, long time ago but it still works fine. This unit was a 5 in diag. screen sonar that mountes on a black box via gimbal mounts. It takes 8 D cell batteries. We used 3 sets of batteries. We did shut it down on long runs and when anchored to try to conserve. Might have made it with 2 sets if we started conserving early. If I was to do it again, I'd ask the pilot to drop off extra batteries on the mid week check flight. Rich"
