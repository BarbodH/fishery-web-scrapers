(we crossed the border 3 days after 9-11) Billy did a very nice job of taking care of us - he had flown in enough groceries to last an extra week and he didn't mind if we stayed a little longer after our official week was up since no one was booked for our cabin after us. Billy flew over every couple of days and would have touched down if we had our flag out on the dock pole. The cabin we stayed in was on Bill's Lake and let's just say that it was very rustic. It was sure nothing fancy, but it was dry even after an all day rain. We tried a little fishing before the hunt and a little bit during the hunt and we didn't catch a thing on that Lake - it was as clear as gin. There was a portage to a river where an additional boat was located. The river and adjoining lakes looked fishier to us than Bill's Lake. But we were there to hunt and I got a really nice bull on opening morning. We weren't charged extra for flying our moose out and Billy arranged for the processing back in town and it was all ready to go when we got back. So not much fishing info, but Billy took care of us - overall a pretty good experience - as long as you're not looking for a fancy cabin. Rich"
