That late in the year some of the boats and motors are a little banged up, so check with the party ahead of you. They charge for overweight (150 lbs./person allowed) but Peter is honest. Good luck."

He said the numbers and size weren't as good as other places, like the north lakes, but it was still pretty good. It may be a little chilly that time of year. They will treat you well. Trying my darnedest to get back into the yearly trip. Family might have to do without food and cable for a few months!"
