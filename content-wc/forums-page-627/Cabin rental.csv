570279,Guest,2007-12-23 15:36:00,0,"Sorry, didn't want to rain on your parade. I'm from Wpg. and also guide on the lake. I can tell you that from what I know about LOW, what I see on the lake & what I have read in the local papers - renting a cabin on that part of the lake (I think) maybe almost impossible. However now that I said that, yes you can rent, but be prepared to spend a ton o'cash for this rental. I have seen cabins advertised for rent in this area in the 2 - 3 Thousand $$ range, per week. I have also seen cheaper (?) in the 5 thousand range (monthly rental) I dunno, maybe you can afford this ? Do a google and hunt out a local realtor - they should be able to help you or point you in the right direction. I just suggested the new Totem one south of Wiley, it may suit your needs / budget. It is something new & different for Totem. You do it all yourself there. As suggested renting on Regina / Lobstick may be available - but it's one heck of a boat ride out to the Wiley area ! Kelsey Grammer is building a new place out on the west side of Crescent Island, maybe he'll put you up for a stay ? :-} Good Fishen Rob p.s I have friends who have places in this area, I'll ask around & maybe something will pop up."
