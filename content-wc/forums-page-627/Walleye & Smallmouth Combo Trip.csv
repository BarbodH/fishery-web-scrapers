570196,Guest,2007-12-14 17:45:00,0,Try KO Lodge in Ontario. it is on the Ottowa River. Smallmouth 4-5 lbs and loads of walleye also. plus the usual nearby lakes with largemouth. I've been there 5 times in last 11 years and plus it is only about a 9 1/2 hour drive from the GW Bridge. Good luck in whatever you do
570249,fishinnut,2007-12-20 07:57:00,642,I'll be heading to the north arm of Rainy again. Plenty of hog walleyes and lots of BIG smallies. Most folks drive right past and I like it that way!! The big pike population is booming too!!

570261,Guest,2007-12-21 10:16:00,0,"I have been going to Hawk Lake Lodge (www.hawk-lake.com)in Ontario for a number of years and have nothing but great things to say about them. While a little pricey, their service is off the charts and the fishing unreal. They are renowned for their smallmouht fishing, but they also have walleye, big walleye. In fact just this year they set a catch and release world record in three categories, with one walleye topping 20 pounds and an eight pound smallmouth! Of course they have plenty of big pike and lake trout too. It is a drive in lodge, yet they are the only outfitter on their lake and have exclusive rights to over 20 portage lakes."

570440,Guest,2008-01-05 09:52:00,0,"take a look at KO Lodge in Ontario. It is on the northern end of the Ottowa River. I have been there 5 times in last 12 years or so. Walleye fishing on river is great ""watch the locals"" Smallmouth were up to 5lbs most averaged 2-3lbs and there are also some musky and an occasional Sturgeon caught by accident."

566961,Wisconeye,2007-07-03 20:33:00,79,"After several years of great walleye fishing we are looking for something a little different. We'd like to find an Ontario location that offers both Walleye and Smallmouth. Would look at drive-to or fly-in. We recognize that finding great numbers of both in the same lake may be difficult, but something with a portage lake would be fine too. Looking for the best of both worlds if possible. We've fished a lot of water that contains both including LOTW and Eagle, but looking for something not so big but loaded with both. Thanks for you ideas!"

570107,canuk1100,2007-12-11 18:23:00,43,Try Crowduck Lake in the Big Whiteshell park in Manitoba just accross the border lots of Walleye and all the Smallmouth you can stand. It is a high managment lake but if you go in with someone who has boats on this lake (it is a portage)the camp rules aren't inforced so only the Manitoba slot and cull limits apply.
