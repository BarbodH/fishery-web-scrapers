570580,2746,2008-01-08 11:52:00,3206,Would like to try the East end this year. Any suggestions as to lodges? We do our own cooking and bring our own boats.
570598,Guest,2008-01-09 08:13:00,0,"What time of year are you guys looking to come? Check out www.canadafish.com, as well there are alot of other good options on the east end."
570599,2746,2008-01-09 10:43:00,3206,"Thanks for the web site. We fish Gullrock in the spring and Lac Seul in the fall, usually early September. We've been doing this for several years so thought it might be nice to see some new scenery."
570600,2746,2008-01-09 10:53:00,3206,Opps! The site you gave me brings up Mooshorn Lodge in Soiux Narrows. Must be missing something.
570604,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-01-09 12:10:00,32,Moosehorn lodge in Sioux Lookout. We are at the base of Lac seul's SE corner. Good luck with your research.
570607,2746,2008-01-09 12:41:00,3206,Thanks! I misread.
551736,Guest,2005-08-24 07:51:00,0,"Has anyone out there fished the both the far east and the far west part of Lac Seul? I was wondering if the fishing is as good in the east and if you do not have to travel as far in the eastern part of the lake as you do in the west part. I have fished the Ear Falls area, and have also done the middle section by Scout Lake and Fisherman's Cove. The east side also looks like there are less large open spaces so is wind not that important? Was looking at Lost Island Lodge, Lac Seul Outpost, or a houseboat in the east."
551737,Mike Kansas,2005-08-24 08:21:00,1463,"We have fished all three sections of Lac Seul that you have addressed. This year we went to the East section and fished Ojibway (NE Section). The fishing is excellent in that area and the water is smaller in that area which of course means the wind is broken up more so its not as big a problem as open water. Last year we stayed at Evergreen (NW Section) and the fishing was great there. Seems like no matter where you go on Lac Seul you have the opportunity to catch good numbers of Walleye and always have a chance to catch a Hog. My wife has caught a 30"" plus fish both of the last two years. We like to fish different areas and Lodges every year and in 2006 we are going to try Lost Island Lodge. This year I have fished at Lac Seul Lodge (Blackbay Outpost), Ojibway and Silver Water Wheel. We are also going to Little Canada Camp at Ear Falls in September. Lac Seul is a great fishery and it is blessed with many great Outfitters and Lodges. I would recommend any of the places I have been to and I have checked out several references from Lost Island Lodge and Im sure it will be another awesome week on Lac Seul."

570383,Jesse-WI,2008-01-03 10:58:00,534,"bump Curious if anyone has anything new to say on the topic. I have fished the west side alot but never been to the east. In the case of my group, the west side was better represented at the sports shows when we first started."
570386,wooglin,2008-01-03 14:27:00,371,"My group fished 4 straight years out of Hudson, hitting everywhere from Websters Bay to Deception Bay (and a bit North of there) and everywhere in between. 2003 was our best year, water was way down and it was hot - we slayed the walleye. Each year thereafter, the fishing got tougher and the big fish seemed to disappear. This last year, we fished out of Ear Falls. We nailed the big fish hard, more in this one trip than the previous 4 combined. Seems the numbers were a little better, but big fish were certainly better. Saw a ton more boats in Ear Falls area, almost could toss my jig into the next boat - wasn't too happy about the amount of boat traffic up there. Sioux Lookout/Hudson area seemed to be a bit more scattered. We always fish the last week of June-ish. Late."

570390,Guest,2008-01-03 15:08:00,0,I've fished the west end 5-6 years and each year it seems you have to run farther out to get the consistent good fushing. Longer runs = more fuel = more expense. Seemed to be more boats on the west side. I'm going back to the east side.

570402,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-01-03 20:30:00,32,"I work on the east end, but have fished the ear falls area a bit, as well. Fish migrate throughout the entire english river system. The mnr has documented this through their tagging program. I have heard and experienced more consistent fishing in the east, but again there is more fishable water on windy days. There are also more tributaries and spawning grounds in the east. All in all, the fishing on Lac Seul thoughout is solid, and I'm sure that there are many anglers in the west that are as consistent for numbers and trophies alike, as I am in the east. One hundred fish days are very common."
