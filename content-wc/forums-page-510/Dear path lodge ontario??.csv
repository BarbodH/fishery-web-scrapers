1253881,Lambertson Rock Guy,2010-12-07 13:12:00,20,I have stayed at Deer Path Lodge several times. Nothing fancy but nice people and clean cabins. No indoor bathrooms so if you don't mind using an outhouse things will be fine. They have showering facilities and a fish cleaning shack. We mostly trailered to the Deception Bay landing on Lac Seul. We had fantastic smallmouth fishing on Big Vermilion. I thought it was a nice place for the money.
1253986,counterguy,2010-12-07 19:19:00,84,"I like Deer Path mainly because of all the great memories I have gotten while staying there. Rick and Evelyn are the nicest people you will ever meet. It is quiet and very well kept. The sunsets on Big Vermillion are breathtaking. I just go down and sit on the rocks by the water and watch the sun go down. Priceless. I havent been to Canada since 2005 due to a particular reason. I cant wait to go back as I only live 6 hours away. I used to go there a couple trips per year.The cabins are not motel fancy. They are well kept and clean. The previous poster was wrong about bathrooms. Most of the cabins have fully functioning bathrooms, including showers. Most of them overlook the lake also. If you have a really big group they have a cabin that will sleep up to 10 I think. I only stayed in that one once. I have stayed in all of the at one time or another.Big Vermillion is an excellent smallmouth, lake trout and pike fishery. I think it has muskie but not 100% sure on that. We went out one fall morning before going home and caught close to 50 lakers in 2 hours between 4 of us. My brother stopped fishing to help the wives take there fish off.Lac Seul is the primary target if you want walleyes. It is only a 10 min drive to the access. I would suggest a bigger boat if you like to cover alot of water. It is not uncommon for us to go 60 miles in a day. Not necessary to catch walleyes though. We like to explore. The Walleye fishing there is outstanding and you wont be dissappointed. My Buddy got a 32 inch walleye his first trip there with us. There is a picture of us with the walleye on their website in the walleye section. Im the younger guy with the US flag on my shirt. They are very reasonable on there cabin rates. Im not sure what they are now but we used to do the trip for about $400 per person. That included all gas for boat and vehicle, groceries, bait, and lodging for a week. I cant wait to go back there and am counting the days. Rick and Evelyn will be more than happy to accomodate you. Tell them Jason the countertop guy from Bemidji sent ya.Support Catch and Release and See ya on the Water. Ill be the one in the green Pro V with my rod bending."
1254051,muskyhunter34,2010-12-08 06:44:00,227,It was very well put...I hope to be there this july/august...again thank you!
1254065,Lambertson Rock Guy,2010-12-08 07:51:00,20,I have stayed in three different cabins at Deer Path and none of them had indoor bathrooms. I guess I just assumed they were all like that. My mistake.
