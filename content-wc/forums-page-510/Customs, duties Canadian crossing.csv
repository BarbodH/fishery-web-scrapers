I believe the issue is that upon return to the US, the agents might make you pay duty on an item (as if you purchased it in Canada) unless you can show proof that you owned it prior.In one pamphlet from the US customs, it says to only do this if the item is less than 6 months old. In other places it seems to imply to have such proof of prior purchase for any large ticket items.What has your experience or reading of the regulation been?Scott"

The US dollar buys more in the US than Canada now and all the border people know that, the 13% Canadian tax does not help either. If you are a Canadian resident going back into Canada, they can be little more sticky, since the better buys are in the US and we try to bring back as much as we can. Steve"

The US customs has a pamphlet called ""know before you go."":US border control Know before you go.pdfHere is an exerpt from it:Tip: Register Items Before You Leave The UnitedStatesIf your laptop computer was made in Japanforinstanceyou might have to pay duty on it each timeyou bring it back into the United States, unless youcould prove that you owned it before you left on yourtrip. Documents that fully describe the itemsuch assales receipts, insurance policies, or jeweler's appraisalsare acceptable forms of proof.To make things easier, you can register certain itemswith CBP before you depart including watches, cameras,laptop computers, firearms, and CD playersaslong as they have serial numbers or other unique,permanent markings. Take the items to the nearestCBP office and request a Certificate of Registration forPersonal Effects Taken Abroad (CBP Form 4457). Itshows that you had the items with you before leavingthe United States and all items listed on it will beallowed duty-free entry. CBP officers must see the itemyou are registering in order to certify the certificate ofregistration. You can also register items with CBP atthe international airport from which you're departing.Keep the certificate for future trips.However, early on in the checklist section is says:Receipts or registration paperwork (CBP Form4457) for any new electronics, such as a cameraor laptop, that I'm taking with me? (Only suggestedif traveling with recently purchased goods.Not necessary for goods more than 6 monthsold.) My kids always bring their whiz-bang computer gadgets or laptops. I just don't want to find out that the US is going to charge us duty on items that we already owned, upon return. Scott"
