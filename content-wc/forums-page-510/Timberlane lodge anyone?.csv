1253120,KTroller,2010-12-03 11:21:00,237,"I saw this on here a while back and it is a bit cumbersome but but it is fun for mapping online and somewhat helpful - go to: http://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocodethen ""enter an address or location"" as Ear Falls, Canada - select source Google then hit geocode it button. The Map will move to Ear Falls. Then Change map background to ""Can. NRCan+names"" and it'll show many of the place names on Lac Seul. You can then grab and move the map around zoom in etc. Timberlane is between Ear Falls Gold Pines just to the W of the RR bridge.KT"

1253217,JDP,2010-12-03 19:48:00,1457,If you have the Navionics chip;Lac Seul will be on it.Which chip do you have?
1253219,KTroller,2010-12-03 19:50:00,237,"I don't have a Hot Spot map - not sure if there is one for LS. I do have a Navionics Canada chip and it is pretty good, but there are still lots of unmarked hazards - and some of my favorite spots are on dry land according to it;-). The nav lines on the chip are helpful on longer trips tho. You'll be glad you have it.KT"
1252781,fishinnut 3446,2010-12-01 15:39:00,638,"Hey guy's,I was looking into booking with them,and was interested how the lake was compared to Eagle lake as far as big *** rock's in the middle of no-wear?And how far I would have to go to be on good fishing,many people say Mcenzie bay,don't mind the drive but also don't want to get caught in something I don't like boating in (2'-4' wave's)with the wife and 2 kid's.So if anyone has had a good time at Timberlane I would enjoy hearing about it,and I would'nt mind some of your honey hole's,don't need gps coordinates just a good starting point'sFeel free to e-mail me [email protected]"
1252801,wallydave,2010-12-01 17:07:00,2151,"I have fished the Ear Falls area for several years. The Lac can have some big waves, even without the trip to Mckenzie Bay. Depending on the time of year you may not need to travel very far to find good fishing. Late May and early June the Rapids, the sancuary, Lunker Island and Saw Mill can produce some very good fishing, later in the season, the fish will move out into the lake. When the water is high, rocks are not much of a problem, whenits low be carefull!"
1252803,LIKEWALLEYE,2010-12-01 17:31:00,70,"Our group has been at timberlane for 5 years now. Very nice place. Vance , wendy and chris will take good care of you. We also have experienced large waves. When that happens we just park the boats and fish off the dock. Last early june one guy in our group caught a 27"" walleye off the dock. I personally caught a 25""er off the dock.as far as places to fish depends on the time of year. Ask chris at timberlane and he will get your fishing rod bending. Nice place priced right and a good canadian experience. Good luck and let us on walleye central how your vacation was."
1252931,skindzier,2010-12-02 12:02:00,137,"Great resort - we'll be heading back for the 4th or 5th straight year again in 2011. We usually go in July and the best fishing is further out into the lake. Just watch the forecast (they have a rec cabin with a TV set up, so you can always check) - if high winds or storms are predicted stay closer to home. It isn't like you can't catch fish close to Ear Falls - it is just that once you get into summer, the size and numbers are better further out (at least in my experience)."
1252935,KTroller,2010-12-02 12:38:00,237,Great place - will be my 6th year this year. Another thread here from a few weeks back with some additional info and spots. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=172930KT
1252958,fishinnut 3446,2010-12-02 14:54:00,638,"Thank you KTROLL,I did read those posts,what section of Lac Seul map should I be looking for?How are the camp boats?I have a Alumicraft 185 toun.pro 90hp tiller which I have only taken up once.When I fished Eagle Lake I have used the camp boats even upgraded to the 40hp but with 4 people in the boat we don't plane out to well,so I told the wife never again."
1253028,alanexpup,2010-12-02 22:50:00,278,HI. we went to timberlane for many years when glenn and delores owned it. probably in the 80s. it was nice then and i imagine its nice now. when it was rough the railroad bridge was allways good and along the banks good luck.
1253053,wallydave,2010-12-03 06:42:00,2151,"Fisn nut, looks like Timberlane, has 17.5 Lunds with up to 40 horse motors, with four people in one boat, the bigger the better. As far as a lake map goes you'll want the Ear Falls, northwestern section of LS. All of the posts about Timberlane, speak very highly of the operators, check with them with you questions, sounds like you have a good camp to work with."
1253090,JDP,2010-12-03 08:58:00,1457,I sent you a PM...
1253118,KTroller,2010-12-03 11:05:00,237,"Fishinnut, Timberlane's boats are decent and the motors are new Yamaha 4 stroke 40s. I wouldn't hesitate to use them for 3 people, but for 4 I think you'll be happier in your own boat. You don't have to run far to catch fish, but if you want to run down to McKenzie bay for instance, you'll be glad you have the extra space, size and speed.You'll want the NW section map. Before my first year up there I bought one online but Timberlane has essentially the same map that they provide to their guests. If you want to scout out the map beforehand, I would think they'd send you one.KT"
