I stayed there for spring opener for years and always enjoyed the amenities. Frank Walsh's Bay Store Camp is another excellent choice: http://www.baystorecamp.com/ BONNIE BRAE RESORT PO BOX 56 56741 OAK ISLAND , MN Phone: 001 (218) 223-8411 Fax: 001 (276) 676-3721 GEO: 49.250404, -94.873565"

You didnt say a summer or winter trip but any time is good. Summer if you like smallie fishing this area has alot of structure to fish them also muskies crappie and eyes. We stay at Oak Island at this resort http://www.sportsmanslodgelow.com/ Very nice good food and and motel lodging to cook your own food check them out. Also the fishing is usually real good for eyes and sauger and if you want to run to Canada the crappie fishing is outstanding. Take a look at their Web Site Heres a few Pic of the lodge and fish from a trip two year's ago. forgot to mention we fished a reef and caught 5 or 6 smallies thru the ice which was really fun all a solid three lbs or bigger on a Lindy Darter, first time Ive caught a smallie thru the ice and that is a fight."
