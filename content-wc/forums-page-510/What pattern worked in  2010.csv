1253843,Babamel2,2010-12-07 11:09:00,414,"Seems like each year the fish prefer a different fishing pattern, deep / shallow, weeds/ rocks, trolling/casting. I was wondering what fishing pattern and bait type seemed to work best for you in 2010."
1253894,keek,2010-12-07 14:28:00,1003,June 2010- trolling shallow cranks in 8'-4' FOW. Orange was a key color as was anything blue-ish.
1253903,JayM5209,2010-12-07 15:01:00,1050,"Late May - early June: Walleyes - a) crayfish colored cranks trolled in 4'-12' FOW, b) hammered brass spinner w/ half crawler, c) chartreuse Road Runner jig w/ Cabela's brand 3"" shad colored plastic minnow. Lake trout - silver/blue scale Canadian Wiggler long lined in 5'-25' FOW. Jumbo perch - chartreuse crappy jig w/ 1"" of crawler under slip bobber.3rd week of August: Walleyes - BB and spinner (chartreuse/white w/ orange five of diamonds) with crawler in 35'-55' FOW, or chartreuse Road Runner and Cabela's shad 3"" plastic minnow in 15'-30' FOW. Lakers - large 1 0z. blade bait jigged for lakers and white fish on the bottom in 75' FOW."

1254367,Pooch,2010-12-09 12:18:00,4619,"Water temps were high in 2010 so fish were deeper than usual for ""that time of the year"". Different day, different light, different winds, different weather. Some years every day or two can be like fishing a different lake. You can tell who the flexible fishermen are as they continue to catch fish almost regardless of what is or isn't happening to conditions.The ""hot"" lure this year will usually be worthless next year. I used to stock up on what was really slaying the walleye after a trip only to never catch another fish using that same approach or hot lure.\Patterns? My personal thinking is that usually no obvious pattern is the normal pattern.Pooch"
1255581,Mike Kansas,2010-12-15 08:50:00,1463,"Same as always for us on lac seul. Jigging in 4 to 12 feet of water paying special attention to the wind conditions in early june and in early july jigging deeper water humps and large sand flat edges. In our two weeks on lac seul we caught 50 to 100 walleyes a day per person during each trip. Patience and good jigging technique are vital but the most important is choosing the right structure based on the fishs pattern for that time of year. Good luck, mike kansas"
