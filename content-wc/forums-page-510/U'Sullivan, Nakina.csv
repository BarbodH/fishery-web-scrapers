I did ""chat"" with a fellow on Walleye Central who was going up this last fall, but he never followed up with the results, so I don't know how he did. (Or was it you and you didn't make it?) I have been there a number of times in July, and friends have been there in June. I doubt you can go at a bad time. I would guess the fall walleye fishing is good, as it always seems to be, but you should have a better chance at the lake trout. We normally only target walleyes there, and usually manage a few trout at the same time. We never target pike, but feel you could tangle with some good ones if you wanted to. The lake in July fishes best in the wind. We stay at O'Sullivan's Rainbow and are well satisfied. You can email me for more info, if you wish, also you can do a search on WC for additional bits of data. Bill Krejca"
