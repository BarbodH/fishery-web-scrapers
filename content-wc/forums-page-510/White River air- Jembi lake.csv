Started going to Armstrong and never fished the White River / Wawa area again . I fished Herrick, Hambleton and Pike lakes. I occainally ""look"" at going back there but for just a couple hundred dollars more and a few more hours driving I can get into much better fishing . I have seen this posted here in the past so I am not the only one. I love the drive to White River as we can make that trip in 13 hours verses 20 hours . As far as Jembi goes, no sorry I cannot answer your question . From what I read here not many fish that area from this forum . Seems like when someone asks about White River /Wawa their suggestion are to try Nakina , Armstrong or further west in Onatrio."

Moves to Wawa, then White river, Nakina, Armstrong. That is whewn I quit going with my brithers crew. He had 8 guys up there this year. We are Me and 4 sons. They don't want to drive any further although I think I may have them talked into Nakina. Did you go with Leuuenberger there ??? Had some great fishing on quite a few of their lakes. Any way, thanks for the reply. Ted Jias"
