1252135,Seanik,2010-11-28 10:41:00,218,"Our group of retired fellows is planning a 2nd Ontario fishing trip in 2011. We like the idea of a train in camp. The VIA RAIL, train ride really adds to the enjoyment factor, we did a short train in this summer to Shenango Lodge out of Foleyet, fishing there was below our expectations but the added expierence of the train ride made this trip OK. We are seriously considering Flint Landing Camp in The Wabakimi Nat. Park for this years train in trip. We would like to board the train in Sudbury instead of Hornepayne as they suggested on their website. I don't know if this is possible but will have to contact VIA RAIL for more info. This option makes the driving time much less for us. I know from reading posts on this board there are some contributors that are knowledgeable about the Wabakimi area. I would appreciate any insight about this area especially Heathcote Lake and FL Camp Seanik"

1252163,phishfearme,2010-11-28 15:10:00,1242,"hey jerry - how's thing with you? we did the train option many times to various places - toronto to cochrane, toronto to savant lake overnight (actaully we picked up the train in barrie - free and safe parking there - i'd avoid toronto if i were you) and also out of sudbury to rays camps and others. a few pluses and minuses - it used to be when the government subsidized the trains more, that they were a bargain - it ain't so no mo. check out the fares and you may find driving is MUCH cheaper (with more than one guy). next is schedule - two points- you have to leave home and depart camp according to the train schedule and also - late is typical - sometimes VERY late. freight seems to have priority over people so many times we'd find ourselves sitting on a side track. you can waste a day on both ends of your trip quite easilly. on the other hand, if the above doesn't bother you, it's a wonderful way to travel. most trains have a glass dome observation car and we've found the meals to be excellent. we also take a shamful pride in emptying the bar care of blue on one trip. so, let us know what you decide and of course a report is always appreciated. phish"

1252309,tooski,2010-11-29 14:10:00,393,"We have endured the 2 hour train ride out of Cartier ( north of Sudbury) for ten years running. When you are taking a family of five it is easily the most economical means of finding secluded fishing. The problem is usually the schedule times. Not once in ten years did the train leave Cartier on time. That is not so annoying as you are by your vehicle and near the station. However waiting alongside the tracks seven days later in the midst of nowhere can be drudgery. One year we waited over 9 hours. And yes, it started raining. Naturally if you are boarding at a scheduled stop things may be different. We traveled Viarail and I'm afraid my Pennsylvania friend Phish drank too many Blues prior to boarding as the closest thing we had to an ""observation car"" was being able to stick our heads out of the open box car we traveled in. And there certainly were no meals available unless you count the cookies the conductors wife made the year we waited over 9 hours. All that said I have to admit we always enjoyed the train trip. Definitely a different way to go.... Have a great time either way.."

1253812,Seanik,2010-12-07 08:57:00,218,"Thanks to all for your suggestions, The more I look at Flint Landing, the more I want to go there. I did some research on Via Rail for travel times and costs. A round trip ticket from Capreal which is about 12 miles from Sudbury is 248.00 and is 650 miles from FLC. Boarding the train at 6:08 AM in Capreal gets us to FLC at about 11:00 PM that night, on the return trip we board at 7:30 Am and get to Capreal 18 hrs later. For 6 days of fishing we could go on a Sat. or Wed. and return on the same following days, also we could train in on a Sat. and depart the following Thursday. Capreal has pretty secure free. parking in the employees lot and the station master rents employee rooms to train riders that need to overnight. I thought about boarding at Parry Sound but that adds another 100.00 to the ticket cost and there are 2 stations, 1 for Northbound and the other for Southbound trains. Free parking is available at either ststion but on the return trip one has to get to the other station to retrive their vehicle. The baggage allowances are very generous, each passanger is allowed 3 checked bags and 2 carry ons, the checked bags can't be over 50 lbs and longer than 4 ft, carry ons have a smaller size limit but also 50 lbs weight limit. Additional checked bags are 20.00 each. Because we are all retired train delays don't matter as long as it doesn't shorten our fishing time. I usually organize our groups annual Canada fishing trips, we have one already booked at Expeditions North in July, but I'm looking at this for a 2nd trip in August. The planning begins with calls to the fellows who live in different cities in Pa. and Ohio. This too is part of the trip enjoyment. Seanik"

1255416,bloom08,2010-12-14 11:49:00,13,Wish i could of warned you before you went there. Shenango Lodge was one of my first trips ever. The trip to Foleyet was very very very long from new jersey. we had to stay overnight in sudbury before we picked up the train in Foleyet. Was a very nice place and well run but the owner sold it a few years back to a guy in pa. Fishing wasn't very good. But what a fun night out in sudbury. You might want to check out http://www.monetadventure.ca/ A person i knew went here 3 years ago and said the fishing was great. tried to get more info on the web for it but no luck. Went to caesars outpost with oliver over the summer. You can always call or email up there. good luck
