1254536,redrider911,2010-12-10 12:32:00,3,"Hey guys, I need some ideas on what to get my father for Christmas. He is 70 years old and goes fishing at some fly - in lakes up near Timmins, ON a few times a year. I know weight is an issue so last year I bought him a light weight sleeping bag. This year, I have no idea what to get him. He has all the right bait and tackle so I ask you pro's on what to get him. I was thinking polarized sunglasses, but I'm up for suggestions. Thanks for the help!"

1254542,joeman79,2010-12-10 13:08:00,417,A Nice pair of Costa Del Mar Sunglasses with built in readers would be an awesome gift. I know I got a pair as a gift. Lifetime warranty for any type of damage. Awesome clarity-readers in just the right spot. They are pricey but worth it to me anyways.

1254694,@Lunker,2010-12-11 08:44:00,835,"How about zip-off pants? Eliminates the need to take both shorts and long pants. Two pair, you're good to go for a whole week."
1254744,phishfearme,2010-12-11 14:39:00,1242,cabelas pac-lite rainy river is the best - it's a bit expensive but to me this is one item that you can't spend too much on. phish
1254762,Steve of Madison,2010-12-11 16:46:00,230,"Phish is on the right track. I went to Canada for a couple years thinking I could get by with a ""cheaper"" rainsuit. After a week of rain/wind and cold...I came home and spent the $$$$. Cabela's Guidewear bibs and Coat, you simply cannot go wrong. Now that suit is the first thing packed. It is the only coat I pack and the bibs are comfortable all day. If it gets too warm they stuff into my dry bag.If you want to be the ""son of the year"" get him a GOOD rain suit!"
