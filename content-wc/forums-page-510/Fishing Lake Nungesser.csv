The boats at Angler's Kingdom are about the best of any I've used at a lodge in Canada. Having nice Lunds, pedestal seats, 50 HP and good electronics really makes the fishing better. Nungesser is a lot of fun to fish. There are humps, flats, rock piles, drop-offs and points. Kevin at Angler's Kingdom pointed out more spots on the map than could be fished in a week. It was a lot of fun going out and finding the specific locations and then catching fish on those spots. Wish I had brought my GPS and mapped some points. With the structure in this lake, being in the exact spot makes a big difference. One morning one of my sons and I went out and were fishing points for walleyes. On one point, we caught a couple fish and then the bite stopped. I noticed on the locator a large cigar shape. Figuring a northern was in the area, I grabbed an extra rod in the boat and quickly tied a silver Rapala Tail Dancer on it. Made a cast off the front of the boat, then one off the side and a final one off the back. As I was reeling in the last cast, the 35"" northern hit the crank bait. Played the fish then boated it. It's uncommon to actually target a specific fish, then catch it.It is a further to drive up to Red Lake and then up to Nungesser than other lodges in Ontario; however I found that extra drive worth it."
