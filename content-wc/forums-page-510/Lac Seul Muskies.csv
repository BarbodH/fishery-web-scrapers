I have caught a couple in the past but am really looking into getting into them seriously this year. If someone would be willing to share spots I would be more than willing to give you some of mine in return.. also any suggestings as to what type baits and structure to look for would be great. I caught a good un on a point with some stumps around it last year.Take care guys!Feel free to email me..[email protected]"
