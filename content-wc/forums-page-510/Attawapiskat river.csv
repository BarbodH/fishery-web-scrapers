1255920,deputy dog,2010-12-16 17:08:00,305,just received confirmation of our deposit and the whole group is pumped! eddie sent a map of the lake and it really looks great. no big open water for weather to be a factor and LOTS of rapids which usually mean wallies. would like to talk to someone who has been there to see if rapids are crossable and if they held walleyes. anyone want to chat about eddies shoot me a pm!
1255986,GOBIG,2010-12-17 03:08:00,126,"Let us know what you find out. We are booked for aug 27th. I was wondering the same thing about walleye in the rapids. The map looks great, i think eddie said 15 miles between the big rapids, so plenty of area to fish."
1250385,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-20 06:31:00,223,Has anyone other than Solo Paddler fished the Attawapiskat river system? Great report Solo Paddler. I know this is a new camp and he is trying to make improvements to make a better camp. If so are you willing to share what you used for bait where you fished for both Northern and Walleye? What time of the year did you fish also? Any detailed maps of the lake and river system would be great also.
1250425,Guest,2010-11-20 08:52:00,0,Eddie sorry did not mean to offend you. Sounds like you have been working very hard. Glad to hear that your investing I'm sure you will make it a great place. Your right rocks are everywhere and are usually a good thing. Our experience was years before you took it over. Good luck.
1250556,Guest,2010-11-20 19:57:00,0,Glad to help Tightliner These guys been on the Attawaspiskat River for 30-40 years and can give you lots of information. Great people.http://www.hearstair.com/pym-island.htm They have a great camp there too with maps and information.
1250637,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-21 09:24:00,223,I talked with eddie and have emailed eddie the owner of eddie's north river fishing. This guy has been very helpful knows what he is talking about and very easy to talk with. I am sure if he is like this in person he is going to get a lot of return patrons. He is trying to build his business and this is the correct way to do it. I think i will be booking with him as soon as i get the go ahead from the others involved. Ed i know you will be viewing this post and i am looking forward to the map you will be sending me. Thanks for all the info and looking forward to booking in august.
1250902,Mike Borger,2010-11-22 12:39:00,1554,"I've fished the camp in early Sept and mid June, both trips the pike fishing was great.As far as baits go, nothing overly unusual.Johnson Silver Minnows tipped with a 4"" grub, various non weedless spoons in the 1oz range, and spinnerbaits and inline bucktails in the 1oz range all produced lots of fish in both fall and spring."

1252916,Basskicker,2010-12-02 09:38:00,9,"I have been up at Eddies camp twice, amazing TROPHY pike fishing. It's not a 5 Star resort but has 5 Star fishing. The accommodations, boats, camp and facilities are MORE than adequate. I have personally caught more than 20 fish over 40"" and a few of those over 44"". Last spring I made 3 casts consecutively and landed a 43"", 45"", and 47""....I know this sounds too good to be true, but it happened......just happened to be at the right place at the right time!!! If you have any questions...don't hesitate to give me a shout @ 905-431-6533. Looking forward to next spring....if there's any spots left!!! Cheers Jason"
1252942,deputy dog,2010-12-02 13:00:00,305,booked for aug 13-20th...want to go now but other guys dont ice fish seems like it's gonna be the final stop in our quest for the perfect(for us) fly-in.....CAN'T WAIT!!!!
1252943,TIGHTLINER,2010-12-02 13:07:00,223,What time of the year were you there? What kind of lures worked the best? Did you catch most of the fish casting or trolling? How was the walleye fishing? What time of the day would be best to call you or contact you? I have talked with eddie several times and got booked the last week of aug for the 2011 season. He sounds like a honest person and would not steer you wrong if he has everything he says he has he should be booked solid for many years to come.
