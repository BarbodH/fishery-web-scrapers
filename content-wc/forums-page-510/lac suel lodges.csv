1254801,sammy2964,2010-12-11 20:26:00,17,"looking for a drive in camp on lac suel. I will be bringing my own boat and would like to target walleye and musky. I'm not looking for the ""hilton"", but would like a cabin with water, shower, kitchen, toilet etc... Looking to spend under $500.00 (US) per person. Thx in advqance for any info provided."
1254812,rather-be-fishin,2010-12-11 22:11:00,429,"That may be a challenge to find that price......for better Musky fishing you will need to look at the NE side, Sioux Lookout area of Lac Seul.. If fishing musky is not that important, then take a look at NW area of Lac Seul by Ear Falls. Check out:www.fishtimberlane.com/rateswww.lacseulsgoldeneagleresort.com Good Luck! 7 1/2 months & counting down to our next trip to Lac Seul!!! RBF"

I have stayed at GB several times and always had good luck. It seems that the Ear Falls area camps/lodges seem to run a little cheaper than the other sections of LS. Plenty of walleye, perch and pike, not know for musky, take a look at www.clarksresorts.com they have walleye and musky. If your cabin/house bound this winter google can be your friend while searching for a good spot to wet a line!"
