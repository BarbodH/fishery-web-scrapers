1255371,Fish_on,2010-12-14 09:58:00,1856,"I was up there in 1979 so that probably won't be much help to you. To say the fishing was excellent was an incredible understatement. This was just after the road had been built, and we didn't see another boat, except some indians who tried to steal our beer from our camp."
1255475,hoosiercanadian,2010-12-14 16:08:00,104,"The Nungesser road ends at the Behrens river , there is still talk of the road continuing further north, eventually reaching some of the First Nation communities, i hope i live long enough to see that happen,"
1255649,Gavorlake,2010-12-15 14:10:00,33,"How far fron red lake tp Behrens river,Can you put a boat in to reach behrens lake.Are the local natives a problem,ARE THERE MANY OTHER LAKES IN THE AREA to fishThanks for any info"
1255826,Fish_on,2010-12-16 10:28:00,1856,"Well it has been a long time since I was there (1979). But here is what I remember. We parked at then end of the road and put our boats in the river and went down the river to Berens and camped on an island. I do remember the river being quite small but it was no problem for us with our small boats and 5 hp motors. Remember, the road had been built very recently and we were some of the first people into Berens. The fishing was amazing because it had not hardly been fished at all except by the natives netting. We caught huge northerns and all the walleyes we could stand just by trolling rapalas and spoons along the shorelines. I have no idea how much it has changed in 30 years. At that time the indians were not used to seeing others up there and they were pretty bold and beligerent. They tried to steal the gas out of our boats one night but one of the guys woke up and caught them. They grabbed a 12 pack of beer and took off after a short shouting match. I figured they would get drunk and come back and be even more of a problem but they never came back. From then on we took the gas tanks out of the boats at night and put them in the cooking tent. There were six of us and we were there for ten days. The whole trip cost me less than $100. Times have changed. It would be fun to go back to something like that."
1255840,hoosiercanadian,2010-12-16 11:34:00,104,"I have only been up to the end of the road once just to check things out, i was pretty much turned off of fishing behrens lake by looking at the landing and the parking lot, almost every vehicle in the lot had at least one flat tire, and the boat launch had junk, old tires and trash thrown in the lake, it did not look like a place i wanted to fish. I have fished Kirkness and did okay, and i have fished nungesser."
1255937,ATR,2010-12-16 18:37:00,10,"Hoosiercanadian is very much right on with his description. I used to go up in that area back in the 80's and early 90's and I saw the same thing. The best way to go up in that area is with a boat and motor in the back of your truck. There are a lot of lakes you can get into if you are willing to carry a boat and motor a short distance. Coli lake has a landing and private campground about 40 miles up the road from Red Lake, but it was not very nice the last time I was up there, about 5 years ago. I have fished several other lakes up in that area also, some named and some unnamed. Most of them were good fishing. I would love to go back and do that all over again. The adventure was the best part."
