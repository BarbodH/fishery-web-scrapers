Just wondering if anyone has had any experience in this area and have some tips to share on where to find the wallagators! We will be up there July 9th-16th. This is our first trip up there so I am hoping on a good one. * On a side note, does anyone have a list of items/ they bring each year that they can share? There will be six of us, most the guys have not been to Canada yet and I am trying to give them as much heads up as possible. Also we will be bringing our own food in as well....so finding how much of everything to bring up will be tough."

At one time its website had a manual that was highly informative and funny too. Once you read this, you will have a better idea of what you want. I'm sure there are many other outfitters that provide a list too. You could do an advanced search on Walleye Central for food lists or fishing trip lists and run across previous discussion on this issue.Hope you all have a safe trip, good weather and great fishing.Gary"

Re: what to bring - You'll get various opinions, I suggest one person plan the menu. My experience with everyone bringing an item for one meal has been that a lot of unneeded/unused extra food is brought. We always plan on eating fish - we can eat the other stuff at home, but it is wise to have a little extra for backup, in case the fishing is not what was expected. If you also do a search on menus, you'll find a lot of good ideas. Bill Krejca"
