(special lures that work well) is the water stained or clear? average depth ? What about staying in Armstrong, hotel recommended ? Any information is appreciated as this would be new territory for us...............Thank's New Hips"
1255437,deputy dog,2010-12-14 13:52:00,305,"fished whitewater last year with mattice, great outfitter! cabins were hand made log cabins and staff at jump point was first class. there are, i believe two hotels in armstrong one in town with restaurant attached and one out of town but real close to base camp. we stayed at one out of town and it was fine...no problems with it. short trip into town for food. water was down 5 foot when we were there so fishing was off but still limited on eyes and had one pike over 40"". all i can tell you about is the outfitter and that was a first rate outfit. have fun!"
1255549,english bob,2010-12-15 06:10:00,14,"Ogoki Reservoir has stained water and depths vary greatly. I do remember many,many snags! Only ever fished for walleye with jigs, any color seemed to work. The McKenzie Lake Motel is the place south of Armstrong (807 583 2800) and is good and comfortable - take care not to go into Armstrong the day you fly out as the railroad track crosses the highway between the motel and downtown and long, long trains can stop for a long time across the highway, and if you are the wrong side........!"
1255601,Ogoki,2010-12-15 10:13:00,291,"I have been going to Ogoki Res. the past 12 years . You will either love it or hate it , but once you learn how to fish it it can be great . Since it is a reservoir it is flooded timber . LOT AND LOTS OF SNAGS . Definetly use a depth finder when trolling and that way if you know how deep your lure is running them you can usually keep out of the wood . I personally use jigs more than anything else. I use the aberdeen hook and 8 lb Berkely Trilene line . I found with that combination I can usually pull the hook out and then always keep a pair of needle nose pliers on your seat . Reshape the hook and keep fishing otherwise you will be tieing on a new jig all the time . Take various colors of grubs as the bite can change . My wife and I have taken 4 pike there that have went over 20 lbs and I might add all were released . We are booked there for 8 days next June . I definetly fish the last 3 hours of the day as you can really get into the walleye then . On one trip we kept count and pulled 72 out of one spot and nothing was under 20 inches . Have taken numeous ones over 5 lbs too. Have never seen a time when we could not fish because you are on a island and can always go a different direction ,even in bad weather . We like it so well we named one of our chocolate labs ""Ogoki"" . She has been there numerous times too.By the way our other 2 labs are named Mojikit and Matti (for Mattice ) I have found the jig head color does not seem to matter so I make them and do not paint them . TAKE PLENTY WITH YOU !!!! I have been on 33 fly-in trips and will not go anywhere else except the Ogoki River system . Hope this helps !!"
1255734,jigman 2003,2010-12-15 21:42:00,981,"You the same guy who posted questions about Ogoki on LakeLink? I fished Ogoki two consecutive years. Forget which two right now - maybe '05 and '06? Doesn't matter anyway. Like Ogoki (the poster above me) I loved the reservoir. It does however EAT LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS OF JIGS. Seriously, I've never lost the number of jigs anywhere else that I did there. That said, the walleye fishing was great. The first year was better than the second, but the second was still great. We hit a mayfly hatch the second year. We finally figured out that we had to fish deeper - got on them in 20-25' of water. We'd look for clouds of tiny bugs on the fish finder and fish there. Pretty foolproof. We got fish on all colors of jigs, but the first year electric blue tails outfished all other colors hands down. If you can, book one of the Elliot's cabins instead of a hotel. If you can't, stay at the McKenzie Lake Inn. I personally would not stay at the hotel in town. Last time I was in Armstrong was a three summers ago I think. At that time if you went to the restaurant in town (not the one attached to the hotel) you had better taken your patience as well. Took over an hour to get a burger and even longer the next morning for breakfast. We decided that the next time we flew out of Armstrong we'd stop in Grand Marais and grab a few extra sandwiches at Subway and put them on ice. As far as outfitters go, you couldn't pick a better one than MLO. The quality of service, accomodations, and equipment is second to none (that I've found anyway). The Elliots are fantastic people and run a top notch operation. Things are very business like and get done in a very systematic manner. It's a pleasure to watch them run things. If you're fortunate enough to have Don fly you, consider it a treat. Whenever I see that Don is my pilot I'm definitely more at ease. Last year was the first year I didn't go to Canada in about 15 years. My groups fell apart after my second trip to Ogoki. I hooked up with another group for a couple years and had good fishing, but it just isn't the same when it's not your close buddies. I doubt I'll go this year either. Kind of sad."

This is new area for us, I flew out of Ignace once. Did anybody bother with live bait, I was thinking a flat of crawlers.... I make my own jigs so that should not be a problem. Any useful info is appreciated .............Thanks to all, have a Great Christmas !!!New Hips"
1255760,deputy dog,2010-12-16 06:33:00,305,"we use homemade jigs with spinners and crawlers exclusively on all our trips north and always limit out. just be sure to pack them in bedding and not dirt as you are not allowed to bring dirt into canada, but you probably knew that already"
