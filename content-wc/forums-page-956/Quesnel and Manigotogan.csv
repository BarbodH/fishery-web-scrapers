The water is very cold - I didn't have a temp gauge but the hand washing test indicated that if you fell in your toast in under a minute (in other words it's really frigg'n cold).We were fishing very shallow - less than 6 feet. For the most part we ran Little Joe type spinners tipped with a worm and trolled it VERY slowly with the wind (wind was from the South on the weekend). Actually we really just drifted with the wind and used the motor to simply stay on course. The most productive coloured blades were orange, silver and bronze (like what else is new).Caught in the 13 inch to 22 inch range. The narrows was very productive as it typically is this time of year. But also any points that slowly descend into the lake - anywhere that has a slow decent to deep water. There are one or two very productive spots like this in Quesnel but I'll let you find them (just use your electronics and look for fish suspending at the 3 foot level in 6 to 8 feet of water, ie. close to shore).I didn't get a chance to check out the sand bar on the East side of the lake but with the warm sun over the weekend and today it will probably produce.Also the male Walleye were still full of milt, so I suspect that it was a later spawn. This weekend should be great if the weather holds. I'd give leeches a try as well.Best of luck to all."

520558,Guest,2002-05-28 20:07:00,0,"Just came back Sunday. Cold front blew in on Thursday, roads were slimy and water in the pot holes was frozen over. We were greeted by a three foot tall snow man on the dock. Fish were not very active on Thursday or Friday, you had to drop the bait on their nose to get them to bite. It picked up Saturday and was in full swing on Sunday. Had lots of luck in the flats and in the narrows. Fish in the 20"" to 27"" were caught with lots of eaters to boot. Never went into Happy. I think fishing will be hot for the next week or so. Some of the ones we caught were still full of milt. CO's paid us a visit on Saturday. They were good people, gave me a warning for open liquor, checked our hooks and were on their way. We only had three beers on the boat so I think they were willing to let it slide.Good luck and let me know how you do.Le pic"
