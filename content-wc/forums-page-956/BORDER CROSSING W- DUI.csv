520609,Guest,2002-05-23 19:31:00,0,A DUI is a criminal offence not a driving record. Best say nothing. If they check they do a criminal background check.
520610,Fuzz,2002-05-24 06:34:00,85,"If they ask you if you've had a prior DUI, my advice is to tell the truth. I have heard (but don't know for sure) if you say No, and they check and find you've had one, you will have to appear before a judge, be delayed, and pay big fines. If they ask you, tell the truth and be prepared to pay the $200 Canadian fee to enter, or come back to the US. There should be good feedback in the next few weeks on border crossings, so please add to it by sharing your experience. Good luck.Fuzz"

It took a guy in our group 3 months to get his, but he is much relieved to know he can cross without any problems. If your record is good and dui is old they will probably give you a 3 year permit. Tight Lines"

But you still never know!! The resort owners have told me after june 28th anything over 10yrs wont be an issue anymore! So dont loose to much sleep over it like i was!"
520614,balsl6,2002-05-24 14:06:00,426,I think it depends where you cross? I know people that cross the border about every other week and they never ask. But if they do I would not lie to them.
520615,Guest,2002-05-24 19:44:00,0,"Why don't you check with your local authorities and see if they can run a background check on you? If your DUI was eighteen years ago, depending on the state in which you recieved it, it could very well have been expunged by now.Many states, including Wisconsin until recently, treated DUI as a traffic violation and cleared these offenses after 5 years. You'll find many states now keep DUI on the drivers record forever including states that used to wipe them off after 5, 7 or 10 years. They did not however go back and get the ones that were cleared and put them back on.If you have a friend that works with law enforcement see what they can find on you- If they can't find it, nor will anyone else.Getting your Drivers License Abstract is quite easy and many sheriff's offices will do it for you for a small adminstrative fee- perhaps even your Department of Transportation.Criminal background checks however are not as easy to obtain, but again talk with your local law enforcement."
520616,ohdaddy,2002-05-27 13:08:00,21,Crossed the border last Saturday. They asked everyone in front of me and behind me for their drivers liscense. They were checking for priors. Good Luck. really think it's B.S. but what can you do?
520613,Sunshine,2002-05-28 12:32:00,3174,"One of the members of our group has a dui from about 5 years ago, what is the $200 fee to enter. What are the other options, if any?"
