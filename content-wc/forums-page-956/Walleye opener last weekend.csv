520592,Toolman,2002-05-23 09:52:00,2570,We just got back from a 4 day fly-in trip to a lake in NC Ontario. 3 days of snow flurries and 30*F temps. Water temps of 43-45*F. Suprisingly the pike bite was pretty good from shallow bays to 25'. Walleye were scarce until we found a bay where they were stacked like cordwood in 25-30'. The bite was slow but we pulled a few. Got some more at nite in the shallows in the same bay. Interesting finding... one pike had a belly full of crawdads (and a few small rocks!).How did everyone else do that went up there?? Just curious. Thanks.Tim

520594,Guest,2002-05-23 11:26:00,0,"Yes, Toolman tell us about the border crossing, all the details.... did they ask everyperson in your group for there drivers license? what time of day of the week and time did you cross?I think you said you were flying with AirDale, we are too leaving Sun morn."
520595,Toolman,2002-05-24 05:08:00,2570,"I believe that we were around 250 miles north of Sault St. Marie. We used minnows and leeches on jigs, rigs, and floats. We pulled cranks and bouncers and casted minnow baits (you name it we tried it!!) The border crossing into Canada seemed about normal compared to the times I've crossed in the past (we crossed at about 2 AM on Sat). They asked the normal 3 questions and sent us through. The re-entry into the states was a little more difficult. They were checking car trunks and under vehicles and asked for ID for all four of us. It seemed like they were doing a good job, only a 10 minute wait. A small price to pay in these times of hightened security. Good luck.Tim"
520596,AL,2002-05-28 04:17:00,89,"I went the 19-25 out of Armstrong on a fly-in. We caught Walleyes by the hundreds daily (4 in my party) on all but two days. The fish were stacked in the current in pre-spawn conditions. We caught them on 3/8 ounce jigs with minnows, power grubs or a combination of both. We even caught some suspended fish on Rapalas. Most fish feeding were in 8' - 20' of water although one day we caught a school in 35' - 40' of water. The interesting thing we found were the Pike were scarce with our party only catching 10 or so total compared to well over 2000 Walleye."
