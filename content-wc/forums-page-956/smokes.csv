I guess that I can't finance my fishing trip by bootlegging cigarettes.I didn't realize that Canadians didn't like American brands. I thought that we were the world leaders with this disgusting product."
520736,Guest,2002-05-27 19:26:00,0,"how many packs can you take into canada. Leaving Friday for Minaki, can't wait. Any reports? Thanks in advance"
520737,Guest,2002-05-27 19:39:00,0,One carton of cigarettes and 50 cigars.
520738,ohdaddy,2002-05-27 19:40:00,21,200 ciggs (1 carton) or 25 cigars per person. If someone in your group doesn't smoke you can bring more with no duty.Brian
520739,RoyC,2002-05-28 07:08:00,274,How much do cigarettes cost in Canada? Maybe I should bring my limit this year and sell them?
520740,Guest,2002-05-28 08:13:00,0,"their very expensive, I can't remember the exact price"
520745,Guest,2002-05-28 10:58:00,0,Actually if you could quit there would be no discussion on this chat board. This message board is solely for those discussing fishing. Maybe you should inquire about how to catch fish rather than throwing you cig butts is nice lakes. Liter Bug!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
520746,RoyC,2002-05-28 11:02:00,274,"Good point about the littering aspect of cigarette smoking. It amazes me how many people throw the butts out the window like it's not littering. In Minnesota, they just passed a law which makes it illegal to discard cigarette filters in state parks. I wish that law applied everywhere."
520744,Reels,2002-05-28 12:45:00,2876,Limit on Cigars is 50<{{}}><
520743,Guest,2002-05-28 18:18:00,0,The market for American smokes in Canada is not that good. Your smokes are not well liked by Canadian smokers. You are better to bring your limit of booze. Lots of hard drinking boys and girls in the bush here.
520741,Guest,2002-05-28 19:02:00,0,About $2.00 US for Canadian smokes. Thats a pack of 25. American smokes are good for keeping the bugs away. Even they can't stand the smell.
