520676,fishmaster,2002-05-27 08:13:00,209,The border crossing this year seems to be the same as past one of our vehicles got checked but were very friendly and made the search short and sweet.Coming back into the US they were some what unfriendly this year and all of us reported questions that did not make sense but all in all things went OK.Good luck to all who are crossing this year and remember to have all insurance info with you in case they ask.fishmaster

Going into Canada we were asked to provide our drivers liscences for back ground check and then given permission to cross. We rounded the corner to see five (5) OPP in full gear including bullet proof vests. Rather intimidating but they waved us through. Coming back into the states, We were asked the number of fish and if we were US citizens and then sent through. Both sides were very pleasent and everything went smooth."
