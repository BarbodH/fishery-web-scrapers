Thanks. Dave"
520657,Tyee,2002-05-25 18:07:00,60,"Dave,What lodge/camp are you headed to ? I've considered heading overto Quebec instead of eastern Ontario (North Bay areas) where I'vefished for most years. LOW and Rainy River are a 20 hour drive for me, so that trip is a few years off. Can't help you out with any info on the lake you're heading up to, but would like to know where you heard about the lake, and the accommodations you have (websites ?).Good luck on your trip.Rich B."

Look at the one started by J. Sopp on 14 Apr 01. I replied twice (posted as Jay) about our trip. If you have any difficulty obtaining the information through the search capability, let me know and I will re-state our experience there. There are things worth knowing before you go. Jay"
520659,Peekay,2002-05-26 07:02:00,7,"Just got back yesterday from 4 days at Lake Ogascanan(first time). Overall the fishing was fairly slow but there was a very late ice-off & unseasonably cold temperatures while we were there which has made the fishing slow in all regions close by from fishing reports I've read today. Fish taken by us & others I saw were of good size but very sporadic(no pattern). Some of the walleyes we took had markings on their bellies showing they were still spawning. As other posts have said, when the wind blows, the main channel can be very, very choppy, so unless you have your own boat, you may have to fish in one of the bays. As we pulled out yesterday, weather had changed & temperature was much warmer. Lodge owners Ginny & Brad Mullen are top notch but couldn't do anything about the very late spring. If you would like any more info, email me at [email protected].Good luck,PK"
