520347,JoelS,2002-05-21 05:34:00,13,"We also had the best fishing last year in early June. We didn't get any big walleyes. Most were in the 20 -23"" range. We caught all the walleyes on crankbaits (I didn't have any leeches or crawlers). The pike fishing was unbelievable. Many 15+ pound pike. Where do you fish? We stay at Hobbs resort on Cross Bay."
520348,Guest,2002-05-21 06:24:00,0,is that campground still open by hobbs...........is there still an old boy named Saul around?
520349,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-21 09:40:00,195,"Joels.I fish around the Thompson,the Pas and Snow lake areas of Manitoba.Have never fished around Grand Rapids.Have you ever seen the photo of the native from easterville who netted a 70 inch Pike from Cedar Lake?you might have heard the story about it.I have the photo from the newspaper."
520350,cranker',2002-05-21 11:05:00,41,"Yeah it's still open, Solomon sold it to a gentleman from North Dakota named Art Dyke(sp?). It even has a bathroom and shower now. Moving on up... Last we heard Solomon was working on the power lines somewhere in Manitoba. -cranker'"

520352,Guest,2002-05-23 21:18:00,0,my son and i will stay at hobbs first week of july can anyone give us any info on the lodge where and how to fish that area also how to get map or maps thanks
520353,JoelS,2002-05-24 04:58:00,13,"Bama,I have been looking for lake maps with depths for a long time. I have not found anything. I did buy a topo map of the area which gives shoreline but no depths. Hobbs has a map of Cross Bay with depth but it has been copied so many times its not the best quality. Good luck!"
520354,Guest,2002-05-26 19:36:00,0,thank you for the map info
520337,JoelS,2002-05-16 05:30:00,13,I am going up to the Grand Rapids MB area in Mid June. We will cross the border at Pembina/Emerson. I am looking for a good place to buy leeches once I cross the border. I am traveling in a motorhome with a boat behind so a convient location close to the highway would be helpful. Any ideas?
520338,Guest,2002-05-16 12:33:00,0,"Well Joel Cornholio looks like no one knows -- I thought for sure you would have an answer by now. Stinklick kinda resembles a leech, too bad you can't use him for bait -- you'd only catch suckers with him tho."
520339,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-16 13:15:00,195,"You could travel through Transcona in Winnipeg down regent Avenue.The fishing hole is just down the road in a strip mall,there is alot of spacious parking there as that street is full of malls like Wall-Mart etc.Fishinhole has alot of bait for sale.And extra tackle if you need it.Then you just get back on regent only 2 minutes down the road and your on to Ladgimodea to the perimeter highway,thats the way you would go to head this way anyways.Pro-Am tackle is on the same street also and he carrys alot of bait also.I live 4 hours North of Grand Rapids[where the real fishing begins] goodluck."
520340,Guest,2002-05-17 10:18:00,0,I have a contact who is a licensed trapper. Let me know how many you need and we can look after you.
520344,cranker',2002-05-17 14:15:00,41,"Joel, I have long wondered that exact question myself. I've been heading up to the grand rapids area for about 15 years on and off. In the past we've just brought the crawlers and haven't spent the time to search out leeches. The 24hr drive has a weird way of affecting how many extra stops you take! Last June the road from Ashern to Grand Rapids was in rough shape in more than a few places. You might want to take it gingerly until you see if they've replaced the long gravel stetches with asphalt. We were up the beginning of June last year and had some of the best walleye fishing we've ever had numbers wise. They were honestly smacking anything we threw at um. I couldn't keep them off a crawler harness off a bottom bouncer in 10-12ft of water. Many of our bigger fish fell victim to trolled cranks. The pike fishing was quality as usual, but we caught more in the 10-18lb range than in the past. I really think were just in the right place at the right time. Sorry to get a litlle off topic, but it's nice to hear someone else who travels to the area. Good luck and tight lines.-cranker'"
520341,hksbh,2002-05-17 15:45:00,3,Leech Meister where are you at and how much a pound. We need about 7 pounds on the 7th of june going up #6 to Flin Flon area.
520342,Dave S,2002-05-17 21:33:00,314,"Leech Meister, I will be crossing into Manitoba at Pembina/ Emerson on July 5. I also will be looking for leeches after crossing into Canada. Can you furnish an e-mail where you can be contacted?"
520345,Northern Manitoban,2002-05-18 12:43:00,195,"By any chance are you fishing Cedar lake by Grand Rapids,Easterville area?Thanks."
520346,JoelS,2002-05-21 05:26:00,13,We fish in Cross bay which is part of Cedar Lake.
520343,JoelS,2002-05-21 05:29:00,13,I am looking for a pound of leeches. We will be crossing the boarder on 6/8 early. We plan to get to Grand Rapids 2:00pm.
