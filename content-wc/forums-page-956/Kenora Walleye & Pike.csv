Extremely slow fishing leeches expect gentle pick ups. N. Pike in western Witch Bay running smaller than expected but water level in LOTW is down approx 1 meter. Temps vary upward in shallower areas to 57 deg F. N. Pikes hitting on copper spoons ( with trailer enhancements such as a red twister etc. ) and blue/white jointed Rapalas etc. More info on request from me at [email protected]Good Luck
