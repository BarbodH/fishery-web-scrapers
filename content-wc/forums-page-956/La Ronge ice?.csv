We're scheduled to be in the La Ronge area a week from today, May 30, and yet I have heard people talk about ice TWO FEET THICK!!!Anyone from up there, is this going to be, ummm, kind of a ""problem"", or can the ice up there really melt as fast as they say?Thanks much!Jim"

How long it takes to go depends largely on the weather, but, when she goes, she goes in a hurry.There is a site I'll include a link to - it'll give you the most accurate, up to date info. you'll find anywhere. There are even pic's from as recent as yesterday. Check back there often, and I think there is even a ""contact"" link - the guy is a local if he's from Napatak - he'll help as much as anybody. And, even if the big lake is a no-go, he'll be able tell you about open water nearby. I will try and enter this as a link, I apologize in advance if it doesn't work.http://members.shaw.ca/napatak/derrek.Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get me."
