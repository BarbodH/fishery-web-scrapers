520286,Guest,2002-05-15 20:04:00,0,"Winnie...Wife spoke to Andrea Tues night. Said most of the lake was ice out and Goose Bay should be ice free by the end of today (Wed). Said that there might be some ""bergs"" left come the weekend but guesses that it will be clear. Wife tried to get temps out of her and she said that it would be ""cool"" out on the lake!! Guess that means it will be friggin cold! Cripes the A/C has been running here! Go figure>>>Will be drowning a minnow come Sunday-rain or shine! SET THE HOOK.....Ya got a bite!!!!!!!!!Ahh... the smell of fresh walleye cooking!"
520287,Winnie,2002-05-15 20:13:00,375,"Thanks, MP. We'll be up there a week from Saturday. Should give you ample time to have the NW section figured out, so I'll expect a full report when we get there. ;-) Look forward to meeting you. Good luck. Stay dry. Stay warm. Leave a few for the rest of us."
520288,Winnie,2002-05-15 20:16:00,375,"P.S. Will try to remeber to bring up some fine cigars, so if you partake maybe we can share one over an adult beverage and a camp fire.BTW, did Andrea happen to mention anything about water level? Last year the water was a good two or three feet higher than the previous year. Would like to know what to expect this year."
520289,Guest,2002-05-16 19:15:00,0,"Wife didn't ask... was lucky just to get an ice report! Women like to chat about everything but what is important when it comes to a ""fishing"" trip. Think she spent more time talking to Reid than Andrea! Go figure. Actually the last 2 years the lake has been higher than previous years. I'll find out in 48 hours!See ya @ campP.S. Will save you 1 fish! LoL!!Have a good trip...Keep prayin for WARM winds"

520291,Karl,2002-05-23 14:40:00,63,http://www.justfishontario.com/reports.htm had a good one from Evergreen and Silver Water on Lac Seul
520292,Guest,2002-05-25 08:34:00,0,Just talked to a lodge owner on Lac Seul and the ice is out. Walleyes and northerns biting good. Good luck.
520293,Guest,2002-05-26 07:14:00,0,Just got back from Seul and the fishing was good all week. Stayed in the central part of the lake. The walleyes were shallow and biting good. Took them on jigs/crawlers and minnow baits. The warmer bays were the key.
