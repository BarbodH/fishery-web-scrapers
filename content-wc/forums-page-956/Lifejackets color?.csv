I have an older Mustang floater suit that is black and blue in color. My father-in-law has an identical coat except it is orange. His was approved becuase the color needed to be orange, red or yellow when it was made. Mine is not approved when it was made because of the color. I have to dring an extra PFD when I wear it in cold weather. Go figure."
