Whether Lake Trout are good eating or not usually depends on the lake from which they are caught. My own experience is that if the flesh has a pink/orange colour rather than a white colour, the Lake Trout will taste great. Even so, I wouldn't contemplate harvesting a Lake Trout over 5 pounds for eating. Jay"
