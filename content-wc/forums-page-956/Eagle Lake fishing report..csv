520679,fishmaster,2002-05-27 08:14:00,209,Just got back from Eagle Lake and the fishing was great.Lake trout fishing was best ever as they were in the shallows.Lot of big walleye this year up to 10 pounds.Perch fishing was slower due to low weed growth but should pick up in the next week or 2.weather was up and down started out cold then warm to 70 and then snow storm on thursday and back to 60 the next day.Good luck to anyone headed to Eagle Lake if you need info feel free to contact will try to direct you to hot spots.fishmaster
520680,Guest,2002-05-27 08:40:00,0,Great news!We are going to the West Arm June 5. Do you fish that area or the big lake area? We have been up there since 1977...its a super place. I would be interested in the areas you fish. Have a good summer.Bob
520681,fishmaster,2002-05-27 08:48:00,209,Yea fish that area in fact sportsmans bay was good for slot size and bigger walleye this year.We fish the Vermilion Bay area.Railroad Bay was also good again this year.jig/minnow and spinners with a minnow were the best baits.Lake trout were hitting everything you threw at them as they were on a feeding frenzzy.Lake trout to 18 pounds many in the 10 pound class and walleye to 10 pounds. Northerns most were up to 8 pounds but did have one at 16.Good luck on your trip and let me know if i can help.fishmaster
