1345652,Hawkfan,2011-08-31 15:24:00,237,It is supposed to be in the upper 90s in central Iowa tomorrow. What are the odds we still see flurries when we get to Lac Seul in three and a half weeks? If it does stay warm though are the fish gonna be moving to different areas of the lake because of the temp or things like how long the day is/natural instinct/etc? Does the longer summer weather affect their moving or eating habits? This is a later time of year for our group so just trying to get some expert opinions.

I have litterally fished in a T-shirt one day and needed long johns and more the next. Being cold is way worse than too warm so pack accordingly. You'll be glad you have it it you need it.

This June we had a day where the high in Ear Falls was 43, and our folks in central Il had heat index of 100! The weather will change, so will the fishing, it is making adjustments to the condidtions that seperates the men from the boys! The fishers and the catchers!Good luck I hope the weather holds for your trip!"
1346322,dan cardinal,2011-09-02 15:18:00,64,"Hawkfan....you could definitely see flurries or sqawls packing snow on Lac Seul in late September....been there done that. Pack for a mixed bag...because you can get it. As far as fish location, 3 weeks ago walleye were all over the main basin. That's where they are at and where I believe they will stay until spring. Regardless what the weather does I would be concentrating on the main basin..typical walleye hangouts are points and sides on islands, humps near channels, breaks, or deep water. Mouths of bays were also good at times, having good results from 25 to 35 foot depths. You don't have to be an expert to find them on Lac Seul this time of year, or at anytime for that matter. It should be as easy as marking them on your finder. I wouldn't be too concerned with how weather is going to impact the bite or location. The longer summer season means they are just doing more of what they instinctively do...eat! They were real fat when we were catching them.... the healthiest I ever caught in my 30 years of fishing Canada. They will be fatter in 3 weeks. If it turns cold, I don't believe location is going to change that much. If you believe they have moved, they have probably moved a little deeper or more shollow...but in the same areas. Stay on the main basin, and stay on good walleye structure and you should have an excellent week of fishing. Wish I were going back. But not until next August. Good luck!"
1346623,Hawkfan,2011-09-03 21:38:00,237,"Thanks guys for all the great info. This will be our first trip to Lac Seul. We normally only see it from the air en route to an outpost. Many factors almost kept us from going north at all this year, but we were able to figure out a late September trip to Lac Seul. And our group has grown to at least 12 too! We usually go for a week somewhere in mid August to mid September so this will be a little later. And I know just how the weather can change in a minute. We've seen sleet and flurries and weather so hot we jumped in the lake to cool off. I remember one year seeing my brother shed his rain gear and layers to get down to the flip flops he wore on the flight in.The new water can definitely be intimidating, but will be fun to explore. We got advice on Walleye Central for where to go and narrowed it down from there. We'll be heading to Onaway Lodge up toward Ear Falls and it sounds like it will be a prime location at this time of year. So for now, its just checking this message board five times a day until its time to hit the road!"
