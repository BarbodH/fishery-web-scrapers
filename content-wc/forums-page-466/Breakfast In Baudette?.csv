I'll be heading that way in several weeks and will be looking for a good, close breakfast spot. I prefer not to travel too far out of town. Except north! Going to miss those huge pancakes! Thanks, Bill Krejca"

1347015,MorganMan,2011-09-05 15:18:00,341,"It's been for sale for quite some time, sorry to hear it finally closed. That place ALWAYS seemed busy."
1347076,balsl6,2011-09-05 19:26:00,426,River Bend and Sportsman's have pretty good breakfast. The only problem is it si a little out of the way to get there if you are just driving through. Good Luck!
1347111,MorganMan,2011-09-05 22:35:00,341,"Not a lot of options if headed through the border?? The resorts on LOW are not on the way, but do have good food. I don't know what is out there in Rainy or shortly after??"
