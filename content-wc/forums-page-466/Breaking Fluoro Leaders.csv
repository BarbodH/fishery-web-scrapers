1346493,Bigfishhunter,2011-09-03 11:11:00,803,"So, I was going to post this in the strictly fishing section, but I figured more pike anglers check here. I have been using fluorocarbon leaders for about 2 years now, the brand that is available to me where I live is Berkely vanish Fluoro leader material. I usually buy 50 lb test. I loved it last year, had no issues with it, but this year it has broken on me a few times. Once my wife was casting away and got a backlash or something and the line just snapped sending the lure sailing away. I thought it was the line, but it turned out to be the leader. I have also broken a few on fish. So I bought a brand new spool, and broke another one. I do check for nicks, every now and then as well."
1346510,Moondog,2011-09-03 12:43:00,362,"I quit using Vanish a few years back for that very reason. This past summer there was a discussion at camp and apparently if you don't wet your line well before you tie your knot it causes problems. Also it was mentioned that you have to use the Trilene Knot as a palomar, my knot of choice, weakens over time. I probably will still not go back as I loved TATSU made by Seagar."
1346553,Bigfishhunter,2011-09-03 16:16:00,803,"My issue is not the knot, as that is not what is breaking, it is the actual leader. I guess I will have to be making a Cabelas order, my poor wife."
1346555,Pokerbill,2011-09-03 16:28:00,280,"Vanish seems to have a real issue with age. Year old pre-tied leaders (I know, I know) will snap in your hand."
1346589,5 of Diamonds,2011-09-03 19:41:00,151,I haven't used Vanish in years. Sunline has been on my reels for 3 years now.
1346611,Bigfishhunter,2011-09-03 20:53:00,803,"No. We are not talking about line, and especially not line on the reel, (I use power pro on the reel). We are talking about Leader material, used in the application of pike and muskie fishing for the last foot or two of line before the lure. I have heard good things about the Seaguar leader material, I guess I will have to be ordering my stuff rather than buying from my local tackle shop."
1346726,Topwater,2011-09-04 11:22:00,484,"I made up some flouro leaders this year as well. I made them out of the Berkley Vanish Flouro Leader Material in 80lb test. (4 year old spool I had) So far so good, A few nicks but I'm not too worried about them yet. I'd been going through a ton of the cheap steel leaders guiding so have been experimenting out of nessesity. Steve"
1346740,rpieske,2011-09-04 12:57:00,1276,"I tie my own with 100 lb. test fluorocarbon and have never had one break in 7-8 years of using them. I use many of the leaders year after year. They are incredible. Oh by the way, I fish muskies about 100 days per year. I get much longer life than steel or titanium."
1346970,Bigfishhunter,2011-09-05 10:31:00,803,"That is why I went to Fluoro, to get more life, and stop the kinking that is so prominent in the steel leaders. Also, I like the fact that I can go knot to knot, and not have to have a swivel and excess hardward. But..... Yesterday I was out chasing big pike, and broke two leaders, not even on fish, silly little things. I may have to up my poundage, and am thinking about switching brands. What are some other brands guys are using?"
1347007,reconssd,2011-09-05 14:38:00,147,I would highly recommend making your own leaders. I have been making mine out of Seaguars 130# since 2004. I haven't had a single break or problem since I began making my own. Wire line leaders just don't last and they easily break. Good luck!
