I do not want to sound like a preacher but here's the story: A few weeks ago I was out fishing with some of my kids. The lake level was low and I was paying too much attention to a buoy and my kids and not enough to my GPS. Although on the ""correct"" side of the buoy, I hit a rock and punched about a baseball size hole in the bottom of the boat and knocked out my prop. Within a very short time (perhaps two or three minutes), the boat had a foot of water above the floor. We were close to shore and were able to reach it with the trolling motor, but it could have been a different story if we had been further away or if the water was cold. Also, we were going slow enough (I am guessing 10-15 mph) so we did not get thrown out of the boat, but that cerainly could have happened if we had been going faster.All's well that ends well, and fixing the boat is no big deal. And there is no one but me to blame for what happened.But I learned several lessons. First, don't get distracted or complacent while operating a boat and when you have young kids consider having two adults along so that the operator is also not the babysitter. Second, there simply may not be enough time to put a lifejacket on in the event of an accident. And a boat should be kept organized with safety items always secured and available, because looking for things like ropes, etc is very difficult under a foot of water. The bottom line is that I was very relieved that I and my kids were wearing lifejackets when this happened as it allowed me to concentrate on getting the boat to shore without having to worry about the lives of my kids. I encourage everyone to do the same."

Fixing boats is much easier that replacing the youngsters on the boat! In my role in health care I often have to break the bad news about a loved one, not a pleasant duty to say the least!Glad no one was hurt, and hopefully your post will help others to stay safe!"
1346273,lakerbreaker,2011-09-02 13:09:00,253,"Yes, it is a very good idea. We had a guy get thrown out of a low gunnel bass boat due to some inexperienced driving a couple falls ago. As he handed the driver the car keys at about 40 mph quartering into about a 1 foot chop, the driver let go of the wheel. Boat immediately turned sideways and stopped on a dime. Broke a couple ribs on the way out but luckily didn't hit his head. Turned out wet and in pain but alive."

1346475,walcat,2011-09-03 09:43:00,385,After my buddy and I pulled 4 guys out of the water in 70 ft of water my wife and I now put ours on at the dock and keep them on.
1346497,Little buddy,2011-09-03 11:29:00,801,"You should always have your fire extinguisher handy and make sure everyone knows how to use it. Fires on boats are very fast and it would really suck to have to jump into 50 degree water a mile off shore with current. A lot of people don't realize how fast things can happen on the water( that's why they die). I would never drink alcohol on my boat either, as the captain you have the responsibility of the safety of your passengers. Good post, makes you think.."
1346506,rebs,2011-09-03 12:17:00,7587,Glad to hear everyone is ok. Its a good reminder to us all as to just how quick something can go wrong.Thanks for sharing with us
1346524,Bill Krejca,2011-09-03 13:37:00,6107,"Re: fire extinguisher - I am amazed by the number of folks who store their fire extinguisher on/near the transom. I have never felt comfortable keeping it so close to the area most likely to harbor a fire, thus (in my opinion) creating a situation where it might not be practicable to access it. For this reason, I keep one just inside the front deck, just below the trolling motor, and a second one just inside the glove compartment. And I tell new-to-the-boat passengers where the extinguishers are. Bill"
