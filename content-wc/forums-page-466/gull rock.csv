1346133,pattmit,2011-09-02 06:11:00,36,how have the current weather conditions been on Gull Rock? Hope that when we get up there in 2 weeks a cold front doesn't roll in while we are up there and shut the fishing down.

I think it turns the fish on. They put their feedbags on. Seems last few years the weathers been too nice, and can't seem to catch as many of the over 23's. Pat T"
1346451,jkwildhunting,2011-09-03 08:00:00,361,Will be up in a week. Already got a big game plan setup for this trip. Learned alot new spots in July got some new baits/tactics I wanna try out.Not really worried about weather I am sure it will be 20x better then the 100 degree stuff in Iowa!!!!Go big or Go home!!!! Is what I am thinking on baits!
1346631,Basinman72,2011-09-03 22:18:00,29,"Last Saturday and Sunday the weather was very hot with no wind, the bite was off with fish biting very light, small minnows worked the best all week. weather and water unseasonably mild, lake water down 3 feet for lack of summer rain. Mid week weather cooled and clouds rolled in and the bite was on again but still a light bite. Huge clouds of bait fish graphed all over the typical fishing spots. Heavy wind scattered bait pods and fish behind reefs. Hard to trigger bites. Smaller fish active in 14 to 15 feet on jigs and lindy rigs. Bigger fish are deep and harder to locate, not in the typical spots. Lots of healthy Northern sharking around mid lake structure.Hard to find 18's many fish 16 and under and lots of 21 to 22's.Bring lots of cold weather clothes."

1346123,jkwildhunting,2011-09-02 04:36:00,361,"If all goes well we should be there September 10th, BUT we are having some family health issues so if something happens today/tomorrowish we will more likely be going up at end of september. WHICH will not hurt my feelings going up later in year and freezing your butt off sounds kinda fun right now vs 100 degree heat!"
