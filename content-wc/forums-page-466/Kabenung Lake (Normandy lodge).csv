1346833,Mike Borger,2011-09-04 17:46:00,1554,An old chum of mine owns a private camp on this lake. From what he's told me over the years it's a beautiful lake with lots of structure but the walleye fishing can be tough. I'll try and contact him. Hopefully I can pass along some more info before you go. Cheers
