1338571,Jigger1,2011-08-08 21:43:00,234,"Steve - When I wrote my original post I hadn't formally recorded all the stats, it was just a quick count off the sheets. It was an unreal 6 days and I was off by five, we caught 115 over 24. Here's how it broke down and the exact numbers: 55  24's, 33  25's, 19  26's, 8  27's. The other thing to keep in mind was that 47 of these came on July 1 and 34 on July 2. They were two phenomenal, off the chart, days of fishing. Back in three weeks!"
1339014,SteveJ715,2011-08-10 10:23:00,59,"Wait, only 115?! I take it all back! (Just kidding, of course.)I shared your story with my Dad, who leaves for Lac Suel in September. It will be his first trip to LS. It was kind of a cruel thing to do, really; I doubt if he'll get any sleep between now and the time he leaves.The way we look at it, even if you take out the two big days (81 of the 115 trophies), you STILL had a **** of a week. Frankly, I don't know how you're sleeping at night, either -- the anticipation of getting back to those spots must be a killer. I hope you released most of those big girls.Well, congrats and good luck when you head back. I don't know if you can top your success from earlier this summer, but I'd sure be willing to try!- Steve"
1339500,Jigger1,2011-08-11 17:38:00,234,"Steve  This thread has got me reminiscing about past trips and I don't think it's cruel at all. Your dad should be jacked up about going. I'm like a kid each and every time I've been able to go to this wonderful place. So I'm not bragging; just feel incredibly fortunate to have firsthand experienced some of the most incredible walleye fishing I could have ever dreamed of. When you're fishing at Silver Water Wheel Lodge they record every walleye over 18 that comes in the boat. Every year since 2000 I've been taking these stats and entering them into my own spreadsheet. After thinking about the years gone by, I decided to look at 2002 because I'll never forget 2 days out of that trip and was surprised to see that they were the exact same days, July 1 and July 2. We caught and released 91 over 24 with six guys fishing two to a boat each with a guide but it broke out as follows. 25  24's, 30  25's, 19  26's, 9  27's, 6  28's & 4  29's. Now hold on to your shorts because while those have been our best two days of fishing, 2005 was our best year for overall volume and size. In 2005 our group of 7, fishing 2-2-3 to a boat with a guide (5 days of fishing), we caught and released 204 over 24 which broke out as follows: 84  24's, 54  25's, 48  26's, 5  27's, 11  28's & 2  29's. Now these were phenomenal years and/or days that I've experienced over the last 12 years. My personal average over this time has been 3 walleye's over 24 per day. However 2009 really killed my average because I only caught 3 over 24 for the entire trip. So there are good years and bad and 2009 was an extraordinarily hard fishing year and the weather was miserable. Well enough of this, hoping to continue the fun in less than 3 weeks and still hunting for my 30. Hope your dad has a wonderful and memorable trip to LacSeul, its virtually impossible not to."
1339719,gapwedge,2011-08-12 12:33:00,19,"Checked out the SWWL website. The place looks gorgeous, but they charge about $3,000 for 5 days of fishing per person.Glad you had a nice trip and very impressed that you are able to do a couple loads of laundry and then head back again. Reminds me of the old Saturday Night Live skit with Garrett Morris ... Bessball been berry, berry good to me."
1339806,Jigger1,2011-08-12 18:41:00,234,"No doubt, very fortunate but this is also where I choose to spend my hard earned dollars and very frugal with other endeavors/hobbies. The five day rate is actually 5.5 of fishing; you can pay a little more and get an AM arrival for a full 6th day, either way it does work about to about $500/day, but in my humble opinion worth every single penny. I don’t think you’ll find another lodge that offers the same amenities, quality of service, staff, equipment and overall experience for a dime less. Again I’m speaking apples to apples. I might even suggest that there are very fly-in resorts that can put you on the kind of fishing you’ll experience at SWWL. Sure hope life continues to be berry, berry good so I can go fishing for many, many years to come. Sure know I work hard enough for it."
1339917,Guest,2011-08-13 08:57:00,0,"I'm with you Jigger. I have been to swwl lodge for three years now. I have stayed at nice places before but when I take into consideration that I usually catch more fish in the first afternoon there than a whole day other places it is almost like a full day of fishing. Also consider the guide and unlimited gas and bait, it is a fair deal. We stay in one of the smaller cabins (still as nice as other places just small) and go in May when Mike throws in a free day to balance out the possible bad weather. The average daily cost is on a par with what I paid elsewhere but I also have a guide. It is a first rate camp and thanks to Walleye Central, I am glad I got in there."
1342020,cruiseforever,2011-08-20 07:56:00,177,I just read his fishing report. I wonder why he is having some many cancels lately?
1347005,Jigger1,2011-09-05 14:31:00,234,Just got back from SWWL - my one word answer after conversations at the lodge is ECONOMY. Rest assured it isn't about the fishing which in one word was AWESOME!
1327159,Jigger1,2011-07-07 17:50:00,234,"Back from another incredible trip at SWWL on Lac Seul. There were four of us this year fishing two to a boat with a guide. We fished for six days (6/26-7/2) and caught 120 walleyes over 24 topping out at 27.5. It was awesome. The sweet spot this trip seemed to be 12-14' but that will quickly change as walleyes continue their migration to summer locations and main lake structures. We were primarily fishing transitional areas that will soon be void of fish as the walleyes move with the forage base. We caught fish in as shallow as 8' and as deep as 20' but spent little time shallower or deeper. We fished 1/8oz to 1/4oz jigs with minnows with solid success, but when the weather stabilized we moved into high gear with bottom bouncers loaded with worm harnesses and gulp worms or 3/8oz jigs tipped with 4 gulp minnows. On July 1st (happy Canada Day) between our two boats we landed 50 walleyes over 24, almost exclusively on Gulp products. We were moving fast and covering water looking for active bites and we found them. As always a huge call out to Mike Willems and his incredible team at SWWL, they are truly superb and first class all the way. We're locked and loaded for 2012 and can't wait to get back."
1327440,davenathe,2011-07-08 10:41:00,113,great report thanks for sharing. Gulp must be something new for SWW? Do crawler gulp really work that well?
1327453,BuckeyeBill,2011-07-08 11:06:00,76,Nice report Jigger. Seems like SWWL is a first class operation. Everything you read about it is positive. Maybe one of these years?
1327513,Jigger1,2011-07-08 12:40:00,234,"Dave - I was the gulp worm guy. I was using Berkley Gulp 6 Nightcrawlers and in my opinion there was no difference between the real deal and gulp. The walleye's seemed to hit the bait and hang on plenty long enough for me to make a solid sweeping hook set. The bonus was that when I either tapped bottom or had a light hit, I didn't reel back in to see of the worm was still on the harness, I just kept fishing so it was highly productive."
1327844,davenathe,2011-07-09 21:15:00,113,"thanks, have always used single hook with half real crawler with great results. heading up next week and going to try gulp on double hook spinner."
1336903,Perch56,2011-08-03 11:56:00,17,"My wife and I spent four days at SWW the last week in June and collected three master angler pins for small mouth bass. All of the bass were caught on jigs and watermelon tubes. The fishing was so good that I stopped fishing to watch my wife catch fish as we could have had double headers going most of the time. The credit for our success all goes to Bret our guide who worked very hard to keep us catching fish. For just this short trip we caught 28 walleyes between 24 and 27.5 and tons of smaller ones. We noticed that all of these bigger fish were very thick and fat. I wish I could get back this fall to put a scale on some of those fish as I know that they would be much heavier than one would expect. One morning we left a spot that was producing walleyes so fast in the low 20's range that we could have easily caught over 100 walleyes each in search of bigger ones. The spot had a light wind blowing wind in and the fish were right on the edge of the weed bed. My wife fished with a chartruse ¼-3/8's jig and minnow and I fished mainly with a lindy rig and minnow.It never ceases to amaze me how the guides share information and know that fishing a break on the end of a small sand flat in the middle of the lake will produce big walleyes. One could spend your entire life fishing the lake and never find even a small fraction of the spots these guys know.Breakfast, shore lunches and evening meals and the service were excellent."
1336954,tlars,2011-08-03 14:21:00,137,"That sounds just like my experiences with Bret. A few years ago at the close of a day he said ""There's good news and bad news"". I couldn't resist so I questioned him with ""What's the bad news?"" He responded ""That was my worst day of the year."" (He was 108 guiding days into his year). And the good news - ""Tomorrow we get to go fishing."" Two days later we had his best day of the year. Bret (and all the guides) is a great guy who's into customer service and really knows central Lac Seul. 43 days and counting."
1336961,Mike Kansas,2011-08-03 14:43:00,1463,"Been to SWWL three times and had a great trip every time. Great service,food,fishing and without a doubt a well ran operation. Would probably go again but the other three trips I go on are etched in concrete because of the guys I go with and they want to stay at the resorts we go to. Ain't Canada Great!!!!! Mike Kansas"
1336992,Jigger1,2011-08-03 16:43:00,234,"We were there the same time as you Perch, however the walleye fishing was so good for us we never stopped to smallmouth fish. Only 27 days until I'm back for four more days. Can't wait and looking forward to some early fall hog hunting."
1337585,SteveJ715,2011-08-05 09:54:00,59,"120 walleyes over 24""?! That's insane! Nice work to you and your group. That's about the best week I've ever heard of.- Steve"
