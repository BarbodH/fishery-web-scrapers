1346797,Mike Borger,2011-09-04 15:45:00,1554,"Hey guys I recently spent a week with my family at the Abbey Lake outpost camp in the Chapleau Game Preserve with Park's Fly In Fishing.http://www.outpostcamps.com/destinations/ Camp was a gorgeous log cabin on a point. Small and spartan, but clean and comfortable. Boats and motors were brand new so that was a big plus. Fishing for walleye was incredible. Huge numbers, although not overly big. With my kids being 4 and 7 it was perfect for our needs and exceeded any expectations that I might have had. We'd definitely go back in a heartbeat! For those that are interested you can see my full length trip report here:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=56667 Cheers, Mike"

1346917,515,2011-09-05 06:42:00,254,Another awesome trip for you Mike. Thanks for posting the report and all the pics. Will be on the list for next year considerations of outfitters to visit. Anything more planned for this year?
1346974,Mike Borger,2011-09-05 10:51:00,1554,Glad you enjoyed bud. Maybe something at the end of September. You wanna come along?
1347008,lenray,2011-09-05 14:50:00,467,"Hello solopaddler I am heading up to the Pipestone next week--you go down river and I go up. You probably know the story of Tom Tilley and his dog Sam and them using the Sat. phone at Abbey Lake to get help after a bear attack and Tom killing the bear with his knife. Thanks for the great stories about the fishing and the lakes you visit. len at clare, mi."
1347030,Mike Borger,2011-09-05 16:47:00,1554,"Yep, didn't mention the story to my wife or kids though."
1347048,515,2011-09-05 18:02:00,254,"I'll be leaving town on the 13th for 20 days in the far north. I'll be fishing, moose hunting and most importantly hanging out with family and friends enjoying life. I just returned from 10 day in BC for family wedding and I'm ready for a outdoor break. Thanks for the invite and next year will be better for me for free time and trips if something comes up."
1347050,515,2011-09-05 18:03:00,254,"I remember that, it's quite the story of survival."
1347056,Mike Borger,2011-09-05 18:27:00,1554,Sounds great Mike have fun up there!
1347105,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-05 21:30:00,1460,"You certainly are blessed. Beautiful family. Think I'd go with a moniker of QuadPaddler and drop the solo act.Love the shower fix. It is just that sort of moxie and can do attitude of leaving camp in better shape than when you arrived.The ""Blue Cheese Linguine w Buffalo Walleye"" is a dish my brother and I thought up. My brother and I were partners in a restaurant in Denver area where we came up with the idea. I was thrilled your family tried it out. I'm sorry it did not fit your kids palates. This is truly a can't miss dish IF you serve the sauce on the side.Wife and I are exited to be visiting Forrest Lodge on Caribou in 3 weeks. She read your report! Pressure's on. I hope my shower works."
