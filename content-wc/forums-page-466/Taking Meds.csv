I work in health care so I know to carry a list of my medications from my Dr. I have never been asked, but I hope having the documentation along with an equal dose of cooperation will prevent any problems!"
1345656,JayM5209,2011-08-31 15:34:00,1050,"Bill, again it's 2nd handed - in this case from my wife who's retired after 35+ years in a medical profession. All prescription medications (excluding liquids or powders) are fairly easy to I.D. It's done using a combination of color, shape, and any coded numbers/letters embossed or printed on the pill. There are reference books to do this, but there are also lots of readily available and easy to use online sites to identify prescription meds in pill, tablet, or capsule form. Just type ""pill identification"" into Google or another search engine and a bunch of sites will pop up.I wouldn't worry at all about non-prescription, over-the-counter items. I'm not restricted in their purchase and can legally possess them. If there is ever a question about them, there may be some interesting conversation but it's up to the person raising the question to prove they are a controlled item I shouldn't have.Just my $.02.P.S. I would be concerned about using certain non-prescription meds if I was scheduled to be the pilot-in-command of your early morning flight into that favorite remote lake of yours . . . . but that's a whole different story!"

1345783,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-09-01 04:57:00,629,"After having read the above posts, I find the topic to be a surprise. Having the good fortune to have a summer home in Baudette, Mn. for the past 11 seasons and have made close to a 100 border crossings over the years,(@ multiple ports) I have never been ? about medications by either Canadian or USA authorities. I have made the crossings in Warroad, Mn., Baudette/Rainy River & Fort Frances/ Int. Falls, Mn. As a point of interest to those who maybe in the area of the South Shore of LOTW, out of ""Wheelers Point"", the US Coast Guard out ofDuluth have been on the lake for the past month checking boaters for ""Safety/On Board Equipment"". Yesterday, I was was stopped by the patrol & inspected & fortunately issued a compliance certificate. I think I watched them escort 2 boaters back to the Rainy River. Here was what they wanted proof of: #1. Picture ID (Drivers Lic.), #2. Registration for the Boat, #3. Fire Ext., #4. Coast Guard Approved: Life Jackets (being worn) & Readily acceptable throw cushion, #5. Towels or a container that could clean-up a oilor gas spill in or around the bilge. Something that would help keep the spill from entering the water."
1345792,GWC,2011-09-01 05:44:00,1021,"We've made several trips into Ontario & never been inspected or asked about medications (guns & weapons - yes). Since I know that the ""never fairy"" is listening who knows what my next trip will bring. Why take the chance & have a trip ruined? Carry all medications in their original containers & have a good trip. By the way, I believe this is a requirement shown on the Canadian Customs site."
1346323,Jimmy Jig,2011-09-02 15:32:00,1905,I carry the daily dose dispensers with the pills all loaded for a week AND I also take the bottles for all the pills in the dispensers. The bottles all have some pills in them. I have never had anyone ask about meds when crossing into Canada.
1346369,Moondog,2011-09-02 19:07:00,362,"Ditto on the above posts........and God knows we have been tossed enuf!~! Let's see, that would be every time we cross the border whether it is in International Falls or Pembina. AND we get tossed on the way back and never were questioned about drugs or C4....only about 3rd world lemons."
1345279,kansasity,2011-08-30 14:54:00,80,There isn't a problem with taking tylenol or anything like that across the border is there?
1345284,chevtow,2011-08-30 15:08:00,691,"I have a couple of prescriptions + allergy pills, tylenol and the like and not once have I ever been asked about them. Now if you tried to bring 5 lbs of vicodin over and they caught you there could be a problem."
1345305,fishingfever,2011-08-30 16:04:00,85,My pharmacist told me to be sure prescription medications are in their original containers when crossing the border. There could be problems otherwise if you are checked .
1345317,v-bay gord,2011-08-30 16:49:00,3168,......and make sure they are packed in artificial bedding........
1345383,JDP,2011-08-30 19:44:00,1457,I always love that one!
1345413,Bill Krejca,2011-08-30 20:39:00,6107,"Hmmm..interesting. I have never been asked, but have wondered a little if the folks would object to the meds being in the customary Monday, Tuesday, etc daily dosage containers. From a practicability view, it would seem unlikely the officials would be able to identify the different meds, whether they were in the ""from the store"" containers any more than in the daily dosage containers. It would seem more likely, if that is what is required, if the objective was to bring in bad stuff, to just put it in a prescription container. As a compromise, I also wonder if it would be OK for the prescription container, with some pills in it, was to accompany the daily dosage container, having it also filled. To put it another way, it would seem impossible, without laboratory analysis, to tell what anything really is, and seems incongruous that having a prescription container with info on it would suffice as prima facie evidence (living proof) that the contents matches the label. I'm not necessarily disputing the above pharmacist's statement, nor trying to be argumentative, it just doesn't seem logical to me (realizing that there are more than one ruling in this life that are not necessarily logical, but that we may be wise to follow). Anybody else want to share their findings on this? Sorry for my long windedness. Bill Krejca"
1345454,fishingfever,2011-08-31 04:25:00,85,The reason my pharmacist mentioned it to me was he had been with a group that was checked at the border. A woman with him had her pills in one of the pills per day container. The border guard gave her a lot of grief about it and said they should be in original containers. The pharmacist stepped up and told the guard he could vouch for what the pills were because he was her pharmacist. He told me that didn't help at all and it took nearly an hour of hassle before they were allowed to proceed.
1345547,NARDA 1,2011-08-31 09:22:00,636,"Have taken my meds up in the daily dosage container and have never been asked about it. As far as knowing what the pills are, there are markings on most pills that identify them by looking at a chart on line etc."
1345563,JayM5209,2011-08-31 10:02:00,1050,"I'm not a judge, lawyer, nor peace officer, but based on conversations with those who are I understand the issue as follows. The question is not so much what the meds are, rather it's whether or not you have obtained them legally. The only way for a law enforcement official to know that you did get them legally - and hence are entitled to have them in your possession - is to see either the original prescription or see the meds in the container in which they were dispensed. Prescription meds in daily dose containers do not meet the requirements of the law. This is true anywhere in the States and is not just a border crossing issue. In the event of an accident, or a vehicle search subsequent to a violation, possession of prescription drugs not in the original container is a violation of the law and could subject a person to arrest. I don't use any prescription drugs, but if I did I would never carry any outside my residence except in the original container in which they were dispensed. Oh, by the way, my wife travels frequently with her prescription meds in those daily dose containers. Drives me absolutely nuts! And she knows I won't bail her out if she ever ends up in jail because of it."
1345627,Bill Krejca,2011-08-31 13:28:00,6107,"Thanks, Jay. I can understand that reason. Now, how about all the nonprescription supplements that we can buy over the counter, but maybe look like they are prescription pills? Most that I take, like vitamins, calcium, Advocare products, etc, do not have their description written on them. Would keeping them also in their store bought container somehow legitimize them, assure that ""they are what they are?"" Bill"
