But to say the least at least for us and all the guys we talked fishing was SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!! We started fishing Wed. afternoon at 1 and immediately caught a 27 and 3 over 23 and after that it went bad. Tried big sand but the wind and thunderstorm ruined that, fished little Sand and Gun next 2 days and only luck we had was in the current near Throat Rapids. Maybe we were in the wrong area and should have returned to Big Sand but the Guide we talked to said it was the worst 3 days of fishing he has ever had!! But you could tell fishing was slow as I never saw a boat stay any where for very long. But it still beat the heck out of WORK!! Tried a little muskie fishing but never did raise one. Did pretty good on our fly in to Roger Lake but low water level prohibited us from getting to the Falls. But had a GREAT TIME anyways. Kudos to Pat and Alex at Big North Lodge. Well run and CLEAN. We will go back someday. Maybe not in August though! Hit a HOT week weather wise. Good luck to you guys going to Mnaki this week hope you have Great Fishing"

Corey knows the waters of Minaki and will find the fishing spots that will be currently catching the fish. And yes, the gorgeous blonde at the PC gas pump is Coreys wife and she is really nice in all ways. Just real nice people who work hard to please their customers."
1338566,MKett,2011-08-08 21:35:00,9,"Joeman, you should have stayed on Big Sand. My group of 10 fished only the big lake and while we had to work a little for the eyes, this trip produced the largest cumulative average size. My boat of 4 did not record any lengths, but our biggest was 28 1/2"", with many, many fish over 20"". My brothers boat of 3 recorded 74 fish, with 26 of those over 20"". Our friends boat of 3 did not record either, but they caught just as many. We fished the traditional ""hot spots"" around Green Island, NW corner, beach and Pickeral. Lindy rigs and leeches. While numbers seemed less than past years, the quality sure makes it fun. We fished Sun.31st to Aug.4. The strong wind on Tuesday made for tougher fishing, by noon we only had 5 slots, we ate a sandwich at the beach, then caught 15 slots just out from the beach. All fish in my boat were caught in 28 to 38 fow. Can't wait for next years trip!!!"
1338583,joeman79,2011-08-08 22:14:00,417,Yea bad call on my part I knew with the heat those fish had to be in Big Sandy/ Oh well we shall return someday and try again.
1345649,big fish1966,2011-08-31 15:17:00,1,hi. i'm a new member. our group fishes minaki every year. we are going next week. on you slot fish post you sai you catch big northern in duck bay. i also like to northern fish. i have the 2 winnepeg river maps and it shows 2 duck bays. do you fish the one off of gunn lake or the one at the end of little sand. ? nothing better than a big northern.thank yourichard.
1336066,jignminow,2011-08-01 07:32:00,168,"Let me first just say, 351 days until Minaki. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA The fishing was very good. The relaxation was very good. The weather was very good. Too good. We go to Minaki with an open mind and do not target just eyes. We like to cast for the Northerns and Muskies as well with the occasional accidental bass. 5lb Largemouth this trip. Have never caught a L/M in Minaki. We like to cast very large Fire Tiger spinner baits for the Northern which always ends up catching a bit of everything. Walleyes-lots of fish but ours ended up either being too big or too small. We trolled Big Sand only twice. The first night was Saturday the 23rd in the middle of a very nice driving rain. Thank God I have a bimini and side curtains that I got up just before it hit us. we continued to fish through it. We ended up with 5 but all were mid 20's with the biggest being a 27.....we ran two downriggers and two boards. the hot bait was a blue/silver Smithwick Rattle Rouge (sp?) down 35' and stretched back 100'. The classic white (pearl) #7 Shad Rap produced as well. We fished it again on Wednesday and got 6 more, all in the 20's with the biggest being 23"". We only had 3 in the boat so we ran to d/r and a leadcore down the shoot. We lost a big fish on the l/c running a new pearl colored Rapala Rattlin bait. It was either a big Northern or a Muskie. Ripped out line several times and stayed down. I was running 10# Trilene as a leader to 20# gold Power Pro and it finally bit it off. I was running a 8"" invisileader and it took the whole rig and was a clean cut....will never know. Would like to have seen it. There were only 2 other boats that we saw trolling and we did here several radio announcements of lengths being caught. Slot fish were hard for us to come by. The best was down by the Power Lines but we caught them at the bridge and the entrance to Rough Rock narrows as well. We ran to the Throat Rapids and could not find them but the Northerns were going there and we spotted two high 40 Muskies tailing in the current. We did not find eyes at Wildedge, The Entrance or Raspberry however we popped a couple of dandy Norts while trying. Did not fish the Hat Rack. Did very well for Big Northerns in Duck Bay. Always loved the spot......we watched 4 guys in a boat casting big Muskie baits and I can't see how somebody didn't get nailed in the head....something must of happened though because we heard one guy mutter a few not so nice words and whip his rod in the bottom of the boat.....it just looked like something bad was going to happen. We did not fish up river this year except for the island where the river splits on both sides of it just up from Paradise Cove. Can never remember the name of it. We spent a lot of time in Gunn fishing the islands coves and bays for Norts and Muskies. Weeds were the ticket. I cast a big Johnson Silver Minnow spoon with a 6"" tail and they were crushing that bait. Glad I brought 5 of them. The paint was wearing off pretty fast from the toothy critters. We only caught a couple of pretty small Muskies but saw quite a few big ones. We didn't really devote a lot of time to lobbing giant baits and opted for just using our Nort equipment which did raise some fish. The weather was very nice as far as rain was concerned by I would have much preferred more clouds and cool days. Wind only blew really hard 1 day but easily fishable. WE DID NOT EVEN SEE 1 OPP OR MNR BOAT!!!!!! Crossing at the border was a breeze. Kind of funny questions coming back home.... Anyway, as usual, back to work blues. Very depressed. I always hate seeing the North bound folks with their big happy smiles of excitement and anticipation while us South bounders are all pissed off. Oh well, until next year. 3 weeks until Fluke, Shark and Striper fishing in Conn & RI....It could be worse! Steve"
1336085,Guest,2011-08-01 08:27:00,0,"Steve, Thanks for your return report on Minaki. I am digging out my map and marking a few of the places you mentioned. From Paradise Park to Big Sand in a rental boat is an all day affair, so we will watch for good weather prior to that trip. We stay around Gunn Lake mostly. Thanks for mentioning what lures you had luck with. Did you use any leeches or minnows or mostly trolling with lures? Still getting the gear ready for our trip in 25 days. Each year we look for new guys to go with us which always makes the trip more fun. This year we have one return partner and two new guys who are really lookig forward to a trip to Canada. One item we bring that is different is a radio control float plane. We fly in the bay in the evening. We just tell people that ask that we are trolling for BIG Musky......"
1336134,jignminow,2011-08-01 10:39:00,168,"Only trolled cranks in Big Sand.....leeches were the bait of choice for jigs and bottom bouncers. Do youreslf a favor and get your leeches somewhere else other then in Minaki. We stop at K & K just out of Kenora and over the main hwy on the way there...same prices but much better quality.....oh, by the way, get your boat gas at Paradise Cove on the outside by their ramp......very nice gas station attendant....kept finding reasons to go buy 1 jig."
1337355,NW IA Mark,2011-08-04 15:09:00,17,"Randy, we are also headed to Minaki around the same time. Trying to work our dates with Peter at Barbers Resort - we have stayed with him a number of times. If he cant work in our dates we may need to check with Paradise Cove - I am sure he will have room, Lots of cabins! Anyway, we have fished walleye at Minaki for around 10 years..... time flies! Maybe we can swap fishing results when we are up there over a cold Labatts Blue! My brother, and Grandfather and I fish together. Last year we took a break from Canada and fished Mille Lacs - wind blew every day and we couldn't get out to the mudflats... Won't make that mistake again. Looking forward to hooking some big eyes up on Big Sand. We will arrive in Minaki on the 24th and depart on the 29th. Good fishing. Mark"
1337405,Guest,2011-08-04 17:48:00,0,We will be in the white harbor craft boat from Paradise Park
1337542,NW IA Mark,2011-08-05 07:13:00,17,"There is three of us in a blue Ranger 680 tiller - 60hp merc. We have not heard back from Barbers yet, so we may be at Paradise also?"
1337601,jignminow,2011-08-05 10:49:00,168,Peter is a very reliable guy. Did you actually speak to him or leave a message?
1337638,wolverine fan,2011-08-05 12:32:00,71,"Glad to hear you had a nice trip. I wasnt able to pull off the trip this year, my first missed in ten or so years, but my memories of duck bay in the morning mist will never be forgotten. I have caught many nice northerns in there but way more out on duck reef."
1337818,NW IA Mark,2011-08-06 06:56:00,17,"Steve, I could not agree more with your assessment of Peter. We have always enjoyed our stay at Barbers. Peter did get back to my brother and they are able to fit our mid-week arrival. The cabins at Sunset Point are also wonderful and Ken is a good source of fishing information. Our Grandfather is 87, and so the trip across the river with all our gear and luggage makes it difficult with Gramps - never know what the weather will throw at us."
1337935,reefrnr,2011-08-06 15:51:00,7,i here there is guy from paradise cove named corey who is a awesomewalleye guide should look him up
