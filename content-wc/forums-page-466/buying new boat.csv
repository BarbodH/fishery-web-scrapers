Make sure you have the seller detail the prices on the invoice for the boat, motor and trailer (I know, that is not how you bought it, but the border likes this, it saves a lot of hassle for you). Do that, have the titlework for boat-trailer when you cross and it is a breeze."

The reason for separate sales (Ontario) is when you register the trailer it you pay the tax, also here you need to get a letter from the trailer manufacture for any factory recalls on the trailer, if any,the trailer will need to be brought up to code. Mike"
1346642,Skywagon,2011-09-04 05:47:00,1106,"PRO-V1, good point on the letter of recall for the trailer. zipper1, just for the ease of it, have the dealer you are buying it from, contact the trailer company and get a letter (may be faxed or e-mailed) from them, to verify there are no outstanding recalls on the trailer and include the weight of the trailer. At least in Ontario, you need the weight to determine the plate size you need. The other option would be to contact the trailer company with the VIN and do it yourself, as I have done this on snow machines a couple of times."
