1346761,TIGHTLINER,2011-09-04 13:47:00,223,JUST GOT BACK FROM A WEEK WITH EDDIE NORTH ON THE BETEAU LAKE. EDDIE MET US AT THE FLOAT DOCK IN HIS CAMP WITH HIS FOUR WHEELER AND TRAILER TO TAKE OUR GEAR TO OUR CABIN. WHEN I ARRIVED I NOTICED THE LAKE LEVEL DOWN ABOUT TEN FOOT AND I THOUGHT WE WERE IN TROUBLE FOR FISHING. ONLY TO FIND OUT TO THE CONTRARY THIS WAS THE BEST FISHING OF MY LIFE. WE CAUGHT NUMEROUS WALLEYES OVER 25 INCHES AND HAD A HARD TIME CATCHING FISH TO EAT WHILE IN CAMP. THE NORTHERN PIKE FISHING HAS TO BE SOME OF THE BEST IN THE WORLD PIKE OVER 35 INCHES WERE VERY COMMON WITH ONE REACHING CLOSE TO THE 50 INCH MARK. THE WEATHER WAS GREAT ALL WEEK ONLY ONE DAY OF RAIN FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. THIS COULD HAVE HAD SOME AFFECT ON THE WALLEYE FISHING FOR THE WEEK. THE BOATS AND MOTORS ALL RAN GREAT AS DID EVERYTHING IN CAMP. EDDIE HIMSELF WAS AT THE CAMP CHECKING DAILY IF EVERYTHING WAS OK AND IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING. HE EVEN TOOK US DOWN THE RIVER SYSTEM AND COOKED A SHORE LUNCH FOR THE GROUP. EDDIE HIMSELF IS A CLASS ACT OUTFITTER AND THE BEST I HAVE RAN INTO. HIS PLANS ARE TO OPEN ANOTHER CAMP ON THIS SAME RIVER SYSTEM. WITH THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT HE IS GOING TO BE BOOKED SOLID FOR EVERY FISHING SEASON TO COME. ANOTHER GROUP IN CAMP ALSO SAID THEY WOULD BE RETURNING IN THE YEARS TO COME. I WANT TO THANK SOLOPADDLER AND WALLEYE WANDERER AND EVERYONE ELSE ON WC FOR THE HELP GIVEN TO ME TO MAKE THIS A SUCCESSFUL FISHING TRIP. MOST OF ALL EDDIE FOR WHAT HE DID FOR US FROM BOOKING THIS TRIP TO BEING IN CAMP AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS WE HAD. EDDIE WE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO YEARS OF FISHING WITH YOU. THANKS AGAIN TO ALL.
