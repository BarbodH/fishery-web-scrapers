The closest boat to us was some local guys and one of them told him to quit yanking on his line so hard. My buddy asked him why and he said ""Your gonna pull the plug and drain the lake Dumba**!"" Two of us in my boat were laughing anyway. I think my other buddy is still teed off. I met the guy on shore later and he was tons of fun to be around and we still run into each other once in a while and laugh about it."
1299903,@Lunker,2011-04-27 09:47:00,835,"1) We were headed north of Armstrong on a fly-in. There were so many forest fires that year, the pilot had to fly a serpentine route to avoid them all. I coincidentally ended up in the co-pilot's seat that trip. She handed me a topo map and told me to keep track of where we were so we didn't get lost.2) The camp I was in one particular trip was located on the very eastern end of a long, narrow bay on the east side of the lake which is 950,000 acres large. A squall line blew through the area from west to east. Some guests were running their boats up into the reeds on shore, rather than staying tied to the docks, seeking protection to avoid turbulent water and high winds as the storm passed through. So much water piled up in the bay from being blown in by the storm that, after it passed and the water receded, the boats were left high and dry."
1299920,Guest,2011-04-27 10:43:00,0,"Most memorable...just sat down to a plate of fresh walleye at shore lunch, when about five feet away a bear sticks its head out from the shore. The three of us back up slowly to the boat, with each step back, the bear advanced one step forward. We got in the boat, backed away from shore, and then yelled and tossed rocks and branches at the bear. He refused to leave and at one point picked up our cooler by the handle and walked around the lunch site like a big Lab carrying the cooler. Best memory...both of my kids getting introduced to the great outdoors of Canada and catching their best freshwater fish and having that experience with both them and their grandfather at the same time. I started going to Canada with my father when I was about 10 and now 40+ years later we are still doing it every year, but now accompanied by my kids. Best thought on a cold winter day...the loon calling as I fish in the evening as the sun sets, I set the pole down to just watch the sun slip away and when I pick it up, fish on.....IAWalleye"

When it first surfaced I thought it was a ""croc"", ha,ha. I'll never forget that afternoon...seems like yesterday after all these years."

This was a private cabin about a mile off Hwy 664 half way to Hudson. One o'clock in the morning I start watching the Blair Witch Project. As the movie ended I was thinking ""what a ridiculous movie and I've got to use the outhouse"". Now most of you know how dark the Canadian woods are at night and the outhouse was about 100 yards from the cabin down a narrow path in the forest. The further I got from the cabin the less ridiculous the movie seemed. When I heard the crash in the woods about half way through my duty I was sure it was real. I bet I was a sight running back to the cabin trying to pull my pants up."

A few of my favorite My first ten lb walleye Being at the bar in Minaki and people coming up several times asking ""is that your brother sleeping on the doc?"" After bringing him up each time. Shore lunches and naps on the rocks like a lizard. Taking a nap on the boat and my brother yelling ""The boat is on fire! Wake up!"" and the trolling motor was on fire.... Brother being blocked by a skunk under the porch stairs after using the outhouse at 1am. We just kept playing cards. Dad shaking like a leaf at the boarder inspection because he stashed an extra pair of cigarettes in his socks. Way to go captain obvious. Four Fingers. (Inside story) Some dude that joined the trip one year and took my truck to get beer. Came back two days later. Steve helping bail out my boat and stop it from sinking at the doc in freak wind shear storm from the east-at 5am. Tossing coffee grounds in brothers sleeping bag after he was freaking out about tics after shore lunch and waking up with black specs all over him. My son having a tear in his eye the last day not wanting to go home. The life long friends I have made. Seeing Don for the first time without a hat knowing him 10 years and someone saying holy cow! your bald! Conservative Tom acting like a cowboy with a kitchen towel killing flies. Fred, Barney, Ernie and Burt. Bill aka Barney always being there when I needed him, no matter what. Hundreds more, but thinking about it and reading the posts, the fish is really a small part.

Many of us on the trip are mechanics and after investigating the problem and pulling a few spark plugs water came out of one of the cylinders. 2)Running same houseboat a year later on to a reef at dusk at Taylor Island. Watching 6 guys stand on the reef rocking the house boat of the reef and driving away leaving a few behind to be picked up in the 16 foot boats.3)Coming back in a bad wind/thunderstorm near three sisters with what seemed to be tidal waves causing a gallon of crisco cooking oil to come flying out of the upper cabinet, shattering on the floor and creating an ice skating rink for every curious person that walked in the kitchen and fell on their A$$.4)Same houseboat, same year, The guide never cam out to pick us up when we got close to hudson so we attempted the dock ourselves. This was the year where Lac Seul was 10-12 feet below normal water levels. After 4 or 5 attempt we made it in to the dock (literally) The corner of the dock speared through the side of the houseboat kitchen wall.5)Too many peanuts and beer for my Dad. Had to drop him off at an island 4 times while out fishing. The island is now known as Sh-t Point. Just look for the tallest, greenest pines. Thanks Dad.6)Another day of too many peanuts and beer. This time for another guy on the trip only he couldnt control it while outfishing. Ended up pooping his pants, using his shirt for toilet paper and riding back in naked except for his socks and boots.7)Almost drown in a leaking 16 aluminum. During a fast forward troll Mike yells fish on. Me (driving the outboard) forgets to reduce to idle and jams it in reverse subsequently causing Mike to fall in the boat. Fish was still landed.8)Throwing frozen fillets in bed with sleeping individual during a routine stop by the MNR. Later to find out we were under anyway."
1331965,LOW1,2011-07-20 10:54:00,2828,"It's interesting that many of the memories do not directly involve fishing. For me its cooking pancakes, bacon and sausage on our deck in the mornings and watching my kids grow up, get strong and begin to value Lake of the Woods as a rather remarkable place. But I also enjoyed watching my 10 year old (after warning him not to) jump into the lake on May 18 and learning that water temperature and air temperature are not the same thing."
1332013,REG,2011-07-20 12:30:00,445,Wonderful thread - keep adding the stories. I might have gotten my love of the north woods from my parents - who took me with them to N Wisconsin fishing every year I was alive until I was 18 and my dad passed away. I know that he would have had such a blast in Canada! So I've taken all three of my kids (most) every year since they were about 10 and I'm happy that whenever I ask them if they want to go to Canada there's no doubt that they do. Some things I think about all year.. - Just feeling that little tap on the line and the weight when I set the hook - The smell of bacon frying or outboard exhaust along with the cool pine air - The sound of rain on the roof in the early morning or loons calling in the evening - Warm blankets on a cool night - Feeling the cabin moving like I'm still on the water after enjoying the waves all day (not because of the beer) - Cold beer with crispy fillets One of the most unusual memories is when we were heading up a river when we came across a large bear swimming across - perfect timing!
1332027,wolverine fan,2011-07-20 12:53:00,71,"This ones easy for me. We grew up with just enough, we didn't walk 10 miles to school or anything like that but we had just enough and no extra. My dad and brother and I fished at least three times a week in a rowboat on local lakes with no motor just armstrong! We spent all winter watching fishing shows and marveled at the canadian shows the most. I was lucky enough to make a little in business and i paid for our first trip to canada with all three of us. We all met in Winnipeg and rented a car and those three hours driving were almost as fun as the fishing. The talk of i cant believe we're doing this and whats the world record northern??? When we called the lodge owner and he came to the landing my dad had tears in his eyes and said it was the most fun he could ever think of. Needless to say we had a blast and the feeling never went away all week. Too bad the economy tanked and only i've been able to go back with others. But like everyone else the other sensations were awesome also Northern lights, loons calling at dusk, big @ss beavers everywhere, eagles, 40 horsepower engines!!!!!! good luck to all this year"

1332081,Fishin Fun,2011-07-20 14:45:00,218,I need to add one to my post. This was the first year I was able to bring my 11 year old son with me. This is the 4th generation now that has gone up to Gullrock. The downfall is that my father isn't here to be with his grandson fishing. My 8 year old son is next! Hopefully he'll be ready to go in 3-4 years.
1332232,muskybones,2011-07-20 22:34:00,24,"Wow,where to begin.1. Funniest moment. I took brother-in-law to LOTW a few years ago. The resort owner said they have been having trouble with the bears breaking into the cabins. They had 2 bear live traps set up. The second day they captured a mother and cub. When word got out, all resort guests walked up to see the bears in the live trap. There was a little ""peek"" hole in the end of the trap. Well, my bro-in-law starts to peek in the little hole and another guest slaps the side of the cage. Bears never moved, but I think bro-in-law needed a change of pants.2. Earlier in my Canada days, we used to fish for muskies most of the day, only stopping to catch a few walleyes for supper. So the next few memories are from those trips.--older brother chuckin a big Reef Hawg (10 inches of solid maple) too far as it bounces off a 20 foot high cliff and drops in the water. Suddenly we hear running/crunching noises on top of the cliff and a beaver leaps off the cliff into the water. Brother's lure scared the heck out of it.--little brother chucking similar Reef Hawg for the first time using a bait caster. Gets instant backlash as Dad gets Reef Hawg stuck in shin. Dad never said a word.--Me chucking (what else) a Reef Hawg and getting a hot follow from the biggest musky I have ever seen. I have caught several over 45 inches with the largest at 49. This one was easily 55-60 lbs, verified by older brother as musky lost interest in my lure and went after his. It lost interest in his bucktail when the blade stopped spinning.--nearly loosing my best friend's 1st musky while trying to net it. The hooks got caught on the outside of the net. So I spun the net around and scooped it up from behind. Nice 47 incher.3. Catching 220 walleyes in one day with 3 good friends.4. Feeding wild deer off the porch of the cabin.5. Watching a huge musky try to steal a friend's walleye off his line. He never saw the musky coming because he was sitting down. I saw it coming because I was standing up. He was just about to bring the walleye up out of the water and I said ""no, leave it in the water"". He said ""why"", just as the musky smacked it. I think his eyes popped out of his head. All we got was a shredded walleye.6. One time fishing with my best friend, jigging for walleyes. I look back at my buddy and he is jigging very lazy-like just looking up. I said ""what are you doing?"" He said ""just watching 6 bald eagle soaring above us"".You just can't duplicate what it is like fishing in Canada. And it is not just about the fishing. It is good times with good friends and family. Not much, if anything, comes close. My next reservation is this September. Can't wait."
1332478,IaDave,2011-07-21 14:11:00,476,"[ The only time on Birch, fishing with Dan Gable the wrestling coach. Man does he love his walligators. Was he as intense when he fished as he was when he coached the Hawkeyes?"
1332504,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-21 15:12:00,1460,Dan had this rock by the cabin and every morning he would put on rubber suit and do step ups on this rock. Then he would run the dock. But walleye fishing is truly one of his major passions. The stories he would tell at night in the cabin was awesome. What a gentleman and genuine person. And I must add a very good fisherman.

The first morning we didn't get out until 10:30 because it was cold and rainy. We finally went out and anchored in the mouth of the Wenesaga River. Within 5 minutes my son boated 4, 16"" to 18"" walleyes. The look on his face was priceless and knowing he was now hooked on this annual trip is something I will remember always!"

Those are special memories for sure!"
1332760,REG,2011-07-22 09:44:00,445,"One of our worst trips (many years ago) ended up being one of the funniest to look back on. On this trip, we decided to try a new-to-us island resort on the west side of LOTW – very remote. When we got there, the cabin was nice but there was no water in the hot tub, no live bait available (after we had asked several times before coming if live bait was available), and worst of all, we were really struggling to find fish. When we brought up the issue of no live bait, we were told that we must not know how to fish if we needed live bait. I watched my friend exercise amazing self-restraint since had this been a hockey game, this would have been the point when gloves started hitting the ice. The biggest tip-off was the for-sale sign in front of the place when we got there and the attitude we got was along the lines of “we just don’t care”. Our nick names for our hosts became White Fang and Rain Man for reasons we don’t need to go into – true brothers in apathy. They must have felt a little bad for us and told us about a lake that was a 20-minute walk beyond the back of a bay where they had a couple boats. Cool. They even loaned (rented) us a little (2hp?) outboard engine to take back there with us. This chainsaw with a prop had no reverse (no problem), a throttle that was either wide open or off, and a handle held on with one stripped-out bolt. We found the boats and tightened the engine the best we could to the rotting wooden transom of one of them. And after motoring a ways, we started catching Walleyes and Smallmouths! Very good fishing. In fact, one Smallmouth even came out of the water to hit a lure hanging over the side of the boat – he must have thought he was a Northern! But we noticed that the boats were filling up with water from dozens of missing rivets. We got some plugged, but basically we were fishing for 10 minutes and bailing for 5. My brother had the bright idea of standing on the seats of his boat to fish and turned the entire boat into one big livewell! I still laugh thinking of him taking a fish off and tossing it into the bottom of the boat – fish just swimming around under those seats. All was fine – since we were catching fish – until we were motoring in for the day. My friend was trolling as we went and had a hit – a really big one. I’m driving the chainsaw – one speed - full throttle – and as I turn it around 180 degrees to slow the boat, the engine jumps off the rotten transom and now I’m holding this screaming engine at arm’s length – with only a stripped out bolt holding the handle to the engine. In that instant, I imagined the huge bill I would get from White Fang if this POS engine goes to the bottom but I also didn’t want it chewing on my leg or someone else’s if I brought it into the boat at WOT! Somehow I killed the engine without losing it but the big one got away. When we got back to shore, my brother looked like a bear in an Alaskan stream as he got the fish out of the “livewell” and tossed them into our net to pack them back out. I can still see him with that dripping net of fish slung on his back. I don’t think he appreciated us telling him he was our designated bear bait on our 20 minute hike back down that narrow trail at dusk to the main lake. So we survived in spite of all the issues and even made a lot of great memories – which is the great thing about Canada. Good times or bad, we always come home with some great stories to hold us over until our next trip.."

About the last time he saw caribou migrate across Lake of the Woods and the area that they use to cross the lake. Fishing the area where the Sioux had raided, and the drawings that they had done on cliff sides, hence the name Sioux Narrows. 5) And this year coming around a corner into a bay and seeing a female wolf laying on a rock, and watching us for several minutes."

After we are done eating ""Squirrel"" decides to put on a show. He was actually a fast pitch softball player that came along for the trip, and there was some stories told about him that week that ""SEEMED unbelivable"". He gets up and without saying anything starts walking around our table looking at it. He then tries to pull the cloth off without moving any dishes. Of course everything including the dishes, and the half eaten food hits the floor with a crash. The restaurant went quiet as everyone stared. Not finished he puts the tablecloth around his neck like a cape and sticks 2 french fries in his teeth like fangs, and starts making biting motions, waving his cape around and even goes up to a few strangers tables and acts like he is biting them on the neck. Alot of people are laughing but the wait staff is scared but just tries to talk to him to stop. Then we see the red and blue flashing lights outside and know its going to get really good. Squirrel sees them too and gets up on a ledge next to the door. As the 2 cops come in he leaps on them and all 3 go down in a tangle. Squirrel is trying to fake bite them, he's strong and solid but not too big. One cop gets out his club and whacks the other cop by mistake on the shoulder and for about 10 seconds it is a real melee. Squirrel never hit them or did anything but wrestle so for $300 we get him out of jail later and can finish the trip home. That was his last trip to Canada as far as I know."

At first we thought it was a beaver or a mink. When it got about 10 yards from the boat, up popped 2 big ears. It was a rabbit. It swam alongside the boat and I grabbed it by the scruff of its neck and dropped him in the boat. He was like a pet ... very content to be in the boat. I fed him some peanuts and then he sat on the side of the boat. We took him closer to shore and put him back in the water and he swam back to land where he hopped on a log and dried himself off. We guess a fox or something chased him into the water and, when he saw us, figured we were safer than whatever was after him."

Discovering a vodka lemonade in one hand and a Labatts in the other may seem like a good idea at the time but didn't seem so good when I woke up in the morning. Related to above making the mistake of saying never ask me if I need another beer just bring me one. I have learned my lesson on both points now I limit myself- young & dumb I guess. Having a guy in our group shoot a bear wearing only his underwear- Had a bear in camp at Wetlauffer on a fly-in and he shot him right thru the screened window at daybreak. There is more to the story on how they got rid of the carcass. Also at Wetlauffer having a bat get in the cabin in the middle of the night- If you ever seen the movie The Great Outdoors it was just like that except no tennis racket-used a long handled fry pan and a landing net. Having a drunk old native(trying to be PC) flip me off at the Kenora Beer Store because I wouldn't buy him some beer.

A few years back I have to go and Im using the bailer...I suddenly feel my gym shoes getting wet..what they had done was unscrew the cap, enough so it would leak but not enough for it to come off...ha ha..from that point we made it a point to check the cap before using it...next year I have to go..I check the cap, the cap is on tight..I go and all of a sudden Im going on my toes ( was wearing sandals)...they had punched a hole in the cap of the bailer... a few more...pulling on the power cable from the locater just enough for it to work but enough for it to disconnect when crashing into waves on real windy days...actually brought out the back up battery one time only to find it didnt work either...for a year they wouldnt admit to this one..turns out it was another comedian in our group this one is simple...reversing the crank on a left handed retrieve spinning reel to right handed.. While at the time we get PO""d when these things occur we also have to laugh at the time and thought they put into these pranks.. ."

I remember his name even to this day. He taught us how to cut a gullet from a northern and to use hard gut from the northern. On that same trip, catching wallys off the shore and running up the rock to deliver my freshly caught eye to my dad to fillet. Fishing 3 in a boat with my dad and brother catchin northern and those dang cotton nets.The portage on Wap. where I thought I heard a bear and come screamin up that portage tackle a flyin.Smashing cans from the dump behind camp to redeem at this little general store in Savant. They were not happy to see me with those cans.The time on Glitter when my brother and I slipped back to camp, raided our live well to put a couple wallys on ou stringer so we could go pikeslayin.The only time on Birch, fishing with Dan Gable the wrestling coach. Man does he love his walligators. Same trip, my brother and I hauled our boat into an inland lake where few white men have ever even seen. Brutal portage but the musky(had to of been) we saw in there. 6' if anything. Had one cast at it, dropped my lure perfectly in frount of her giant snout. We watched as like a giant submarine she slowly descends out of the little bay.In Wabakimi the rest of my trips now, 2nd week of June.My mom and dad ran out of gas and had to be towed in. My dad was tired of the crap he was gettin so he and my mom shot the moon! We call it seein the moon and the north star.The time I had to take a treble imbeded deeply in my sons hand at shore lunch in frount of everybody. He didn't wimper. Proud moment.My dad spreading his good freinds ashes.The time in camp in the later years caring for my dad and doing for him what he did for me all those years.The memorial service for my dad at our shore lunch rock.And my most fond memory. 2009 trip. 1st trip after my dad died. It was my turn to give the blessing and as my long tradition to have a moment of silence to reflect on our dear departed fishermen. Men like Ralph, Bob, Len, and Jack and now I have to include Buck. Very emotional. To lighten the mood somewhat I then asked my dad in my prayer for a big fish. I said weve been talkin about it for a little while now. It's the middle of the trip how about it? The next morning I immediately catch a 42"" northern. Within a half hour at a different spot my brother catches a 42"".Coincidence I dont think so.It's way more about the people you love and share this wonderful experience we call Canadian Fishin. Wipin the tears."

1302470,Ogoki,2011-05-03 11:08:00,291,"Losts of great memories and of course the tense moments also ...........One trip lightening stuck a tree 1/2 mile from camp . Helicopter landed and we took the firefighters over to where they could put the fire out . Just after they left at dusk 2 brothers in our group arrived at camp with one having a large treble hook deeply imbedded in his thumb. Most everyone freaked out . The guy who never lifts a hand in camp started peeling potatoes for supper , another just stood around with his hands on his hips making worried faces , another started jugging beer . Since I was the group organizer I got the pressure put on me .I pulled out my firstaid kit an drazer blade . The guy with the hook in his thumb said he needed a stiff drink before I did ""surgery"" . I don't took any hard drinks now but siad I needed one too . After we drank 1/2 a bottle the hook was removed . On another trip with just my wife, we were socked in with bad weather . Was to come out on a Friday and did not get out until Sunday afternoon . While sitting out a heavy reain storm, on Friday evening , I was munching Fritos and had a large filling coem out . Even breathing cool air caused severe pain . Two sleepless nights later we heard the plane coming in . An Otter left off 6 people and the pilot said we had to go 25 miles further north to pick up another group . We did that and when we landed at the base , hitting the water caused me to flinch with pain. The guys wife asked we what was wrong and I told them I had a filling come out . She smiled and looked towards her husband and stated he was a dentist . After getting the plane unloaded he told me to come up to their vehicle and gave me some stuff called ""cavit"" . I packed it into the hole . Next morning we flew in to another lake for a week of pain free fishing . After 33 fly-in trips , numerous drive-in trips and several bear hunts I have many more stories too. Most of the good too !!!!!!!"
1302683,bassnblast,2011-05-03 19:23:00,56,"About 12 years ago, a buddy from Minnesota invited a few of us Texas boys to a fly-in camp in Ontario. I was in my early 30s and had never fished in Canada, much less fished for something called a ""walleye"". We flew into camp in a beautiful DeHavilland Beaver and after putting our gear in the lodge, headed out for an afternoon of fishing. Our guide pulled up over the first reef -- we had no idea what in the world was going on -- and told us to put a minnow on a jig, drop it to the bottom and crank the reel handle two times. I followed his instruction, and in about five seconds my rod doubled over. It felt like I was reeling in a sunken tree trunk, but the tree trunk kept making runs and pulling on my drag. After about five minutes this big gold and black fish surfaced and my guide netted it. He began screaming, whooping and hollering and immediated called the other guides on his radio. I didn't know what all the fuss was about, but apparently it's a pretty big deal when your first walleye (on your first ""cast"") is 31.5"" long...Needless to say, I've been back to Canada every year since!"

As was the norm, I was kind of drunk but since no one else wanted to go I could not let him down. On my second cast I caught a 42"" Northern. I had never caught that big of a fish in my life and had to have my buddy's son go get help so I could get it out of the water. 2) On a fly in sitting in the back of the plain and someone asked, "" Have you seen any Moose?"" We then turned real sharp and dove real steep. Not knowing what was going on, ........you can fiqure out the rest. 3) Seeing our friends that seem like family every year."

We woke that fall morning to find a fog bank had encircled our island camp. As the sun rose, the fog slowly moved between us. The continually changing light penetration and fog concentrations caused the most wonderful almost kaleidoscope exhibit of Mother Nature that I have ever seen. This continued for perhaps 20 minutes, or longer. The best part is that I have it on video tape. It was featured on the local TV news some 15 years ago. As with the Marty Robbins song, ""Some Memories Just Won't Die."" Bill Krejca"

So we ended up on a lake trout fly-in lake, we caught enough fish to eat and take home, but it was a tough week of fishing, new lake, we missed the early bite, but we had some fun any way. The last day we are waiting for the fog to clear, the planes were late. Imagine about 20 guys all packed and waiting standing on the docks. My boat and cabin buddy pulls out his baitcaster, and starts cast a big silver spoon from the dock, he catches the biggest laker of the trip! After the pictures, he is going to release it, a guy comes up, ""What are you going to do with that fish?"", ""let it go, I have my limit, so did everyone else."" ""I'll take it!"" So he opens his cooler, starts handing our beers, to make room for one more fish! So it is 9AM, and were are standing in the fog, drinking beer, and watching the eagles fight over whats left of a freshly cleaned trout! Only in Canada!"

The look of relief on my younger brother's face when the hook finally popped out from under his thumbnail. He had been heating up an erie dearie hook over a propane stove to burn out an area of his nail large enough to get the hook out through. Took about 150 burns and roughly 3 hours.2. My cousin was running his boat and was doing something in his tackle box when their boat came to an abrupt stop. Beached. He said ""I got out of the boat and could walk all the way around it without getting my feet wet.""3. Having a 30 inch pike come out of the water to get a red hair jig that was on a rod leaning against the side of the boat.4. Catching a 25 inch walleye on the same hair jig on the cast after I released the pike. (I was 8 then) That was an awesome day.5. Getting pulled over in Wawa with a van full of guys on our way back from the bar. The driver got a breathalyzer and blew 0.00. The falsest 0.00 ever to be blown. 6. Finally, and this one is burned into my memory like nothing else in the world....Back in the day at the camp where we stay, there used to be a ""dump"" where we would take our trash. One day my dad and I took a couple of boxes of trash out to the dump. We got to the edge of the dump and a big black bear stood up on his hind legs.....With a Cap'n Crunch box over his head. He was flailing to get the box off his head as we made a quick get-a-way."

(For the record, they had been told about #2 moments prior.)#4 Spending an hour up on the bank for a potty break that ended with watching my buddy wash his jeans on the bank of the lake.

A stand out for me was the time I made shore lunch for Jim and Marlene Hayes, Basel, and his party, Big Jerry and his wife (forgot their last names). Over the years, my wife, Esther, and I developed our shore lunch routine to the extreme, chairs, roll-up table, etc. etc. Used to get teased for not roughing it. Met up with everybody, put on a feast, got pictures of everyone sitting on the chairs, etc. Had fun with serving Basel and Jim (wouldn't let them do anything) who spent a lifetime fixing shore luch for everyone else. They said I didn't do bad, ""for a tourist""."

So my friend got behind the boat to lift it up. While lifting it we must have pushed too hard and accidently knocked him in the water. He went down big time and was soaked from head to toe. This was in July so it wasn't cold. But as luck has it, it started to rain and it rained all morning. After a couple hours he was shivering like a cold wet dog so we pulled up on an island to try and build a fire. Problem was he had the lighter in his pocket so we couldn't even start a fire for him. By noon the sun came out and turned into a beautiful afternoon and the fishing was great as always. I laugh every time I think of this story and I still catch heck about it every year in camp. Fun times."

One of the guys is a physicist/astronomer so it was enlightening (pun intended) * One of the guys made a ham sandwich and laced it with mayo. Turns out the mayo was hand lotion. He has no sense of smell so he ate alot of it before figuring it out, then dumb enough to tell us * watching a 'once only' member of our group who couldn't be told anything park his 22' boat on the reef going into Bear Narrows * 42"" pike at Skidoo on ultralite 6lb * Coming back to U.S. at Fort Francis where we left 1 person driving each vehicle in line while the rest walked down to McDonalds for lunch and still had walk almost just as far back * camping on Taylor Island when a houseboat load of folks from MN/ND pulled in. We swapped fresh fish for wonderful steaks. After almost a week of fish that was really welcome. That group had kind of a neat arrangement. A tavern signed up the houseboat for say a month, then just swapped groups in/out every few days. We were fortunate to get the 1st group so there was no residual fish * A real lesson in life: Three participants & alot of observers. a) successful businessman, b) his heir apparent at the company, c) myself skipper. We were returning houseboat to Hudson and Mike wanted a chance to take the helm. Now all had been versed in rules of the water in terms of which side of buoys to travel on. Surrender job to Mike just as we get to where current changed. Mike did not notice this and we were headed for disaster. I was about to tell Mike and John said something pretty much to the effect that if Mike is going to run the company he had best be prepared to act quickly and correctly. I followed that advice: My name on contract for boat so I quickly replaced Mike and got us to the right side of channel none too soon. We were pulling 5 or 6 boats at the time"

Watching him go in the drink as the boat did continuous 360's until it ran out of gas. 2. Catching a ""filletless"" walleye. Uncle had been fishing in the area the day before and cleaned his fish in the boat rather than running to the cleaning shack. My brother hooks into what he thinks is a good fish only to bring in a dead walleye with no fillets. We got a pretty good chuckle.3. Last 1/2 hour of one trip my brother and I took one last drift through a cove right next to camp. Ended up catching four walleyes over 22"" in short order after struggling for the better part of the day.4. Driving the boat next to a bull moose swimming between an island and the main land. Thing must have swam almost a mile!!! Didn't know they were such prolific swimmers.5. My first trip up to Canada we left one lake around Kenora with three walleyes that were 32"", no kidding. I was in 8th grade and I am now 45 and have not seen a walleye over 30"" caught."

Taking an exchange student from Australia to Lac Seul for a week of excellent fishing!3. Having a Blue, a Cuban cigar and watching a fire red/orange full moon rise through the trees at Goose Bay Camp.4. Helping some of our party who had launched a portage boat before they started the motor and the boat came downstream to the main lake. We pulled dragged the boat back up the hill. It took twice as long to get it up the hill, maybe because we had to stop and laugh about the whole adventure!5. Spending quiet time in the boat pulling in walleye after walleye! 6. Making memories trip after trip!"

1298867,SinOrSwim,2011-04-24 19:15:00,1528,"1. First trip ever. Ate some bad food and stopped in Orr (I think it was Orr, MN?). I use the toilet and walk out. My brother goes in and comes out laughing his *** off. People outside in the store were making comments about how bad it smelled. Cleared the whole store out practically.2. Got to our camp one year after drinking quite a bit. My brother proceeded to climb in the green wagon they have to haul gear and ride it down the dock. Bounced off the fuel tank and into one of the boat slips. All were okay. 3. Reeling in the 30 incher a few years ago. Was awesome!!!!! But, still laugh after all these years that instead of fishing more in that spot, we were so excited we let it go, we went around the corner for shore lunch.4. Another brother burned his leg on the wood stove. Had been raining and cold se we had been in cabin drinking and playing poker for quite awhile. After ""a few"" we dared him to put salt on the burn. He did!!!! LOL5. That same brother talking in his sleep. Yelling out..........NICE FISH....OH, THAT's A NICE FISH!!! 6. Had a bear on the screened in porch one year. 6 grown men huddling together in one bedroom trying to figure out what to do. Rest of the trip waking up as a group at night to go outside to pee. 7. Same trip. Stayed at a little motel in Kenora. Woke up about 5 am and went outside to the truck. Heard something around the corner so I walked over there to say Hi to whoever was over there. Came around the corner to a bear standing up against a dumpster. I RAN through the parking lot with no shoes on yelling.........BBEEAAAARRRR. Scared the crap out of the other guys sleeping in the room.8. One year we stayed on a lake with 2 cabins. At night a boat pulled up with 3 women in there. They came in, drank, got naked and started dancing on the tables......just kidding. Checking if you were still reading. LOL"
