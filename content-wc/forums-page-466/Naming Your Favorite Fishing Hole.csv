1346287,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-02 13:37:00,725,We named this spot when we were hiking and came upon this beautiful waterfall. We stopped to take it all in and realized there was a boat nearby. We wanted to remain inconspicuous so we remained hidden and watched a man and a woman have sex in a boat! After they were done the woman started fishing and landed a big pike. There's an experience we will never forget!
1345060,bigwalleye1,2011-08-29 19:32:00,2632,"We've got ""Jesus rock"" a flat topped outcropping on Lac Seul 2"" under the water where we caught some awesome walleyes as the wind pushed the baitfish against the adjecent certical wall (and where we took the obligatory ""walking on water""pictures, hence the anme), we've got Hal Alley, where a friend and his boat pounded big fish after big fish, we've got Scott Island, a lunch spot named after my boat partner, Frypan beach, a lunch spot where some previous party left an old skillet within sight of a great spot for an east wind bite, we've got Butter Island, where we ran out of crisco the last day but came up with a pound of butter to fry shore lunch, there's Whopper point, where 3 fish big enough for Master angler or better came one right after another, there's the Weedbed, The Kitchen (where you'll always find something to eat), there's Suzuki Reef (parts scattered to the depths) the Guide's spot, where a local guide taking Pike fisherman out showed us a great walleye spot, the Rock and Tree, named for obvious shoreline features where the 20 feet between them was the hot bite spot for days in a row. (if you're fishing with another boat, be sure you're in the faster one, and be sure you're better at boat control). Lots more, some we haven't named yet.... Great thread, thanks for the memories...."
1345104,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-29 22:08:00,1460,The Kitchen Boat sex with my quilter wife in a quiet area with a little waterfall. She then catches nice pike. I guess you could say I christened this spot The Quilt Shop.
1345108,joeman79,2011-08-29 22:51:00,417,TO MUCH INFORMATION PIKESLAYER!~!!! lol
1345138,tv4fish,2011-08-30 06:40:00,2694,"We must be ""different"" --- Years ago when my group first ventured up into the big waters of Lac Seul -- we didn't know what the heck we were doing (Now -- there's a shocker). Anyway, when we decided to stop boating because we weren't sure that we had enough gas for the return trip, we just started fishing at an island in the area. We started catching some decent size and numbers of fish - we decided to name that island after me. We then let another guy pick out an island to try - we caught fish there so we named that island after him. Now, you may not find those names on your maps , but when we go fishing - we say ""let's try (insert guy's name for the island) first."
1345247,Hawkfan,2011-08-30 12:34:00,237,Lololololololololol...the latest additions to this thread have gotten quite funny. Good to see!
1345256,Mike Kansas,2011-08-30 13:02:00,1463,"On a trip to Lac Seul in about 94 we had a new guy with us. Him and I were trooling Shadskis near a flat area that had a large rockpile in the center of it. The rocks protruded out in the water and we had to slide out and around to stay in 10' of water. Everytime we went by the rocks he (Jimmy) would catch a nice Walleye. The first day we fished it he caught 4 on it and the next morning 4 more. I never had a strike there. Anyhow we named it ""Jimmys Rock"". I even made a sign and placed it there years later, we still fish it but have never caught anything but an occasional fish on it. To our group it will forever be 'JIMMYS ROCK"" Mike Kansas"
1345258,doubleheader,2011-08-30 13:13:00,2652,"My good fishing buddy is a great joke teller, me not so much, but I'll try as it's part of the story. Every time A Captain of this Spanish fighting ship went into battle he'd turn to his Lieutenant and say, ""Bring me my red shirt"". One day a young officer asked the Lieutenant ""Why does the great Capitan ask for his red shirt before going into battle?"" The Lieutenant looked at the young officer and said, ""Should our great capitan be injured in battle no one will know and no one will panic"". One early morning the Spanish ship was in a heavy fog. As the fog lifted they found themselves directly in front of the entire British war fleet. The Captain turned to his Lieutenant, hestiated a second and exclaimed ""Bring me my brown pants!!!"" So anyhow, my budddy tells this joke one evening as we're heading out walleye fishing with our wives and we all got a good laugh as he's doing Spanish accents and all. A couple miles up the lake we just started fishing in this weedbed when the heavens opened up and it poured so hard you couldn't hear or see much of anything. The three of them were under the bimini top and I was sitting exposed in the front of the boat. With my hood up and the driving rain I literally could not hear them yelling for me to come back and get under cover, but after a couple minutes of this I turned to them and yelled ""Bring me my brown pants"". We all started laughing so hard our stomach's hurt, and the harder it rained the more we laughed. So, from then on that weedbed became known as The Brown Pants Hole."
1345459,81Saluki,2011-08-31 05:33:00,97,"One of our favorite spots has lots of timber on the bottom. We were fishing there one morning when Red, using a 2-piece rod, got snagged. He jiggled the rod to try and get free when the top half of the pole came off and slid down the line to the bottom of the lake. The look on his face was priceless! He eventually broke the line trying to straighten the hook out so he never got the piece back. That spot is now called Red's Pole Hole."
1345561,J-Man,2011-08-31 09:56:00,191,"The Honey Hole, Badger, Crow, Skull, C & C, Psycho Island....And that is all names for the same spot used by different groups of guests. Yes, it can be confusing if you can't remember which group uses which name when we're talking about spots."
1345737,1shooter,2011-08-31 20:04:00,1493,Must be a good spot.
1343389,jigfisher9,2011-08-24 14:11:00,23,"Another area we named ""Wrong Way Bay"". This bay is at the East end of Wilcox lake and is a pretty good sized bay that you have to go thru a narrows to get to. A few years ago we stopped just inside of the bay to eat a shore lunch as it was a 20+ mph wind day out of the NW so this area was sheltered. After Lunch one of the guys decided he wanted to go back to camp as he was not feeling very good. None of us wanted to go back with him so we loaded the front of the camp boat up with rocks as a ballast so the he could see over the bow. We asked if he knew how to get back and he assured us he did with no problem. Well we launched the boat and he promptly went full throttle to the far east end of the bay (should have went West). He looked for a few minutes for the way out and could not find it. We waved like crazy to get his attention but he could not see us as he was a 1/2 mile away. He then sped out the middle of the bay and and looked around then went straight South to what he thought was the opening. Again he could not find it. We jumped in our boat and met him in the middle of the lake. Laughing the whole time. Asked if he needed a map? He said I guess I do...where is the fricken exit to this bay. We gave him a map and pointed our location on the map. He pulled out his compass and took off. he reassured us he would be fine. We crossed our fingers and sent him on his way. Good thing he paid attention while in the Army as he made it back ok. But forever that bay will be known as ""Wrong Way Bay"". He know has a Garmin"

1343486,wallydave,2011-08-24 20:11:00,2151,"One year we could not get a cabin at our favorite walleye lake, so we tried a fly-im lake trout/muskie lake, that advertised walleye portage lakes. The staff and the fishing were less than great. Lets just say we were glad to end that trip! One day my boat/cabin buddy I were trolling for lakers, he had sudden onset explosive diarrhea, the closest island was marked as a shorelunch spot. After he ""christened"" the lunch spot, we called the spot the ""Pristine"" shore lunch spot!"
1343487,muskybones,2011-08-24 20:13:00,24,"We have ""Crappie Crack"" and ""The Hatchery"". Both places on LOTW. Crappie Crack yielded huge crappies on a consistent basis. The Hatchery yielded 220 walleyes in 4 hours--nonstop action; just like you were fishing in a hatchery.Bones"
1343507,Nimstug,2011-08-24 21:28:00,2605,My son and I have a spot we call the Walleye Tree. We were jigging in ~15' of water 50' off the bank in line with a birch tree that was turning it's fall colors. Lining ourselves up with the Walleye Tree we always picked some up. It's around an island from camp so it's a good place to be at the end of the day and getting dark. You can't get lost on the way back. Nimstug
1343852,rnnonmt,2011-08-25 20:57:00,992,Very common name but appropriate. Sh#t Point. Dad had to drop wolf bait there 3 times in a matter of an hour because of to many peanuts and beer. We poke fun at Dad every year saying the trees are much greener off that point.

He was on the bow and i was taking a break in the back of the boat when the fish showed itself. He went into his figure 8 and all he said was holy sh!t look at the size of that one."
1344570,fisher_i_am,2011-08-28 11:23:00,498,"Many unique names as you guys have, but the best is called the ""gas bar"" One of our boats ran out of gas and we found them this location. Caught fish there while filling them up and shooting the breeze. Spot has been a reliable one every year since."
1343147,jigfisher9,2011-08-23 21:16:00,23,"On another thread a few of us where talking about the names we give to our fishing holes and how they always have some story or significance as to how they got named. I am wondering what some of your favorite fishing holes are named?We have ""Broke Back Reef"" where one of the guys got a treble hook caught in his pants and hooked to the seat and coldn't stand up. So one of the others in his boat had to use pliers to get the hooks out. There were in a pretty compromising position trying to get the hook out of his pants. We were 20yrds away in our boat watching this unfold. There was not a dry eye in the group...I was laughing so hard I think I peed my pants.Another area we named the ""Hog Trough"" because on the last day of fishing we were looking for on more 17"" walleye for the freezer and we kept catching 22-24""rs one after another. Dropping a jig and minnow in was like putting ground corn in to the Feeder Pigs.Good times......we have dozens more."
1343186,Red Pine J,2011-08-24 05:59:00,44,"My two sons & I have "" our "" names for several places on Minnitaki. "" Big Pike Bay ""so named for youngest catching a 42"" when very young. "" Snake River "" named for its shape as it winds from headwaters to main lake. Many others also. I've sure missed fishin up north these last couple years, EH!!!!!!!! R P J"
1343189,NARDA 1,2011-08-24 06:11:00,636,"Its not a favorite fishing spot nor is it a favorite spot for me personally. There is a huge bolder sticking out of the water on your left side as you enter the West Arm of Eagle Lake, it is now called ""Terry's Landing"" because about 20 years ago my big *** fell out of the boat and had my buddy Scott not had the presence of mind to hit the kill switch I would have been shredded by the spinning prop!!!!! Scott however got a certificate from the lodge owner for pulling a 300+ lb. wesselotomus out of the lake."
1343209,rms0528,2011-08-24 07:20:00,18,"I took a couple buddies and one of their 8 year old sons up to Lac Seul a few years ago. None of them had been to Canada and the father never really walleye fished before. He always took his son pan fishing or northern fishing in local lakes. Anyways, his first comment when I threw back the first fish was, ""What are you doing, that's MEAT!"" It wasn't quite 15 inches and I explained the boat limit for dinner was at least 15 and we would have no problems catching dinner. Anyways, later in the trip we were at a spot where we were catching plenty of fish, and he caught the biggest walley of his life, 25.5. We took pictures, released it, and afterwards I said to him, ""If the littler ones are meat then that was a whopper!"". The spot has become forever known as Burger King point to us. On another note, my father and I used to hunt on a private slough and always hunted on the same rock point. After he passed away, the farmer and his family, along with the next group to lease the land, named the point, John's Point, in his honor."

1343226,Planocat,2011-08-24 07:48:00,473,"True story.......When we first started fishing Lake Fork in East Texas 20+ years ago, there was a particularly good fishing spot on a dropoff at the end of a wooded point. Evidently, it was the site of more than an occassional dispute over fishing rights on this point. There was a black&white metal sign.......professionally done and nailed to a tree which declared this spot ""a$$hole point"". I regret not taking a picture of the sign before the timber eventually rotted off at water level and the tree and sign went to the bottom of the lake. But in our household, this spot will forever be called by the name on the sign.Fortunately, all 3 of my boys are well aware of this fishing hotspot and the sign which still makes us laugh. They know what a fitting place it is to spread my ashes when that day comes!"
