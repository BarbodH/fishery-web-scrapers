I know when we were up there in July we were only people in camp but there were pilots and cooks and fire fighters stayin in camp that week.Looks like some good rain keep the lightning out they should be good!
1345526,Mohleye,2011-08-31 08:29:00,368,"The number of fires in Ontario is less than half of what it was a few weeks ago. There is a big fire, Red 84, about 60 miles east, and another, Red 124, about 50 miles WNW, so depending on wind direction there could be days where you would have smoke on Gull Rock or any other lake in the Ear Falls/Red Lake area."
1345676,Pat T,2011-08-31 16:54:00,221,I assume there is an open fire ban up in this area. Can anyone confirm this?
1345808,Minnow Man,2011-09-01 06:37:00,85,"Hello Pat Restricted Fire Zone Lifted in Northwestern Ontario The Ministry of Natural Resources has lifted a Restricted Fire Zone in Northwestern Ontario. The fire ban has been in place for several weeks due to an extreme fire hazard. However, the MNR is now confident that the situation has improved and the RFZ has been lifted effective immediately. It's raining & ovecast today. Fishing has been good on Gullrock Lake."
