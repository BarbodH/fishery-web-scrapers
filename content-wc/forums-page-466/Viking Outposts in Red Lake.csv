1122978,Weby13,2009-07-22 10:44:00,57,My buddy is planning a trip next yeat with Viking Outposts and he asked me to go. We would like to fish for bigger Northerns! He either wants to go to Critchell Lk or Crossland Lk. If anyone has been to either of these 2 lakes or has info on any other lakes the Viking runs would be great!!!
1123004,Golden Eagle,2009-07-22 12:24:00,2642,"Hugh Carlson, of Viking Outposts would be glad to give you the information you need. You can go to the bank with what he tells you."
1123013,phishfearme,2009-07-22 13:02:00,1242,"they've been in business for ever and they really know what they're doing. we spent two weeks at their telescope lake - great cabin, very good walleye but small pike. hugh even made an emergency gin run for us - terrific outfitters. i think their northern camps would be best for northerns - heard that mcginnis is a tough lake but will produce jumbos - trout included - and that dolphin lake is pretty good for northern with access via portage to mcginnis. ask the carlsons for people who were at their camp last year the same time you're planning to go. they'll be glad to get you all the info you want. phish"

1123192,Weby13,2009-07-23 07:26:00,57,Thanks for the info! My buddy contacted Hugh Carlson and he said to go with Critchell Lake for large Northerns!
1123209,5richards,2009-07-23 08:33:00,131,You'd be crazy not to look into Little Vermilion Lake -- This year my group had pike over 40 inches every day. That's a group of four!
1123263,Golden Eagle,2009-07-23 11:32:00,2642,Edit. My post was not on topic. Sorry. I'll save it for another thread.
1123705,Stu,2009-07-24 23:49:00,472,"Hey Weby13, Let me know how you do. Viking is on my list of places to visit. Are you having your beer and food flown in ahead? I am wondering what he charges. Good luck - Stu"
1123718,Golden Eagle,2009-07-25 05:58:00,2642,"Hey Stu,Be careful about mentioning having cargo flown in ahead of time. Kirsten Brazier of DaxAir, Inc. caused a lot of grief to all the air services in the Red Lake area a while back by making false accusations about flying practices. I'm sure that all of Viking's planes are licensed and insured for commercial use, but some others are not and occasionally a camp owner might haul a few cases of drinks and food on a plane that doesn't meet commercial requirements. Kirsten did damage to others, but most was done to her own career. DaxAir, Inc. is a failed business and no longer in operation. The Beech 18 is for sale near the bridge on the Chukuni River."
1123884,Stu,2009-07-25 23:39:00,472,Thanks for the tip. I certainly don't want to start any trouble.
