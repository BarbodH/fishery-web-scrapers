508567,gggpack,2000-06-17 09:08:00,2,Has anyone fished Carroll Lake from this fly-in service. I will be going in August and would appreciate any advise on bait or fishing tips at this lake. Please e-mail me at [email protected] This lake has walleye and northern pike. Thank you. Gregg
508568,gggpack,2000-06-23 10:20:00,2,Or has anyone ever heard of this resort? I was curious of the service and how good the fishing was at their camps? I will be going in August of 2000
508569,Guest,2000-06-23 17:50:00,0,I just returned from Showalters two weeks ago. Fishing was great but weather was lousy. Very cold (45 degrees) and windy. We fished Action Lake and caught lots of 2 - 4 pound walleyes. Excellent outfitter with great facilities. A group of 12 of us are returning next year to the Cochrane river area. Check out their new website at: #####://www.fishshowalters.com/
508570,Gregg,2000-06-26 16:44:00,48,Thanks Jeff for your response. Could you give me your e-mail address for further questions on your trip to Showalters. This will be our groups first trip at this camp. You can e-mail me at [email protected]
