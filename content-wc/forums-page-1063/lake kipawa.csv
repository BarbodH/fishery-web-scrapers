508831,Guest,2000-06-29 08:19:00,0,"Dan - where do you think I get my Walleye Central handle - ""Kip""?We've been going to Kipawa for 23 years, the last 5 to Taggart Bay. My parents help Yves and Lise run the place now that my Dad has retired. Normally you could call my Dad but they've been at the lake for almost two months now. I'll email you with my phone number.We (about 17 of us at last count) are heading up for the week of July 8th-15th."
508832,Guest,2000-06-29 12:35:00,0,"I will also be heading up to Kipawa in late August for the first time. I've been around Ontario lakes for 20+ years, but never to Kipawa. I was hoping someone could give me typical walleye and pike patterns for late August. You sound like the source....let me know."
508833,Guest,2000-06-30 11:18:00,0,"My email at home is down so here's a brief summary (try my email later).I've never fished the lake in late August. However, my parents have. Late August begins a cooling trend and the mid-summer patterns change. However, being a big deep lake (unlike most southern Ontario lakes), it won't change abruptly.Walleye jigging in the evening at prominent points should good, though with the cooling you may have to go shallower. I'd look first at depths of 20 feet or so, but head shallower if you don't find anything; shouldn't have to head deeper. Use 1/8 oz. Cabela's Wobble jigs in chartruese or simialr. Sometimes Power Bait / Walleye Scent twister tails plus a worm works better.Bad weather is good weather on this forage-abundant lake, and drift fishing North-side sand flats should be productive if you can cover enough ground to locate the schools. Drift with a Lindy Rig & worm, or worm spinner rig if you need to move faster to locate fish. Find perch schools and you should find feeding walleyes IF the weather is bad enough (wind, rain, etc.).Bigger walleyes are where the little ones aren't. Try steeper, rockier points, ledges, and drop-offs for them. Numbers aren't as great, but size is better.Weather too nice in the middle of the day? Then it's Lake Trout and Pike weather. Pike are not overflowing in this lake due to spring water level mgmt. but you can catch them. Some small bays work, but better luck is at the rocky mouths of back bays and bays with rock reefs. Throw large yellow spinner baits or troll #13 Rapalas in silver/chartruese.Hope this helps. Email if you need more. and good luck. I'll be on the lake in 8 days and can't wait!"
