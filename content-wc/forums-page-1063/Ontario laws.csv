Been doing nothing but catch and release except for shore lunch for last 15 years. Did'nt get to go last year because of family problems, but in 1998 when I went for one week, was told that I better not even have a walleye in the frying pan for shore lunch. What's up with that? I'll be making several trips and buying year long non-res license this year. Will I be able to have a walleye shore lunch without breaking the law? I always stay at Birch Point Camp in NW Bay. Mike."
