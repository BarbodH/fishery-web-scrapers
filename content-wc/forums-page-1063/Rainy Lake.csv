508761,Guest,2000-06-26 22:00:00,0,"The walleye's have moved to the mid lake humps. They were in 19-27' of water on Sunday in the North Arm. The smallmouth have abandoned the nests for reasons unknown. Many are suspending over deep water, feeding on mayflys. The pike have moved deep, at least the large fish anyways. They are beginning to show up in good numbers once again in the deep water locations. Great fishing if you like to fish deep.Here is Sundays lake profile over deep water: surface=68 degree's, 5'= 64, 10'= 61.5, 15'=61.5, 20'= 61.1, 25'=60.8, 30'= 60, 35=60, 40=,59.3 I would expect the walleye bite to get real good for the next while as summer peak is upon us. Fish the windy shore lines up shallow if conditions warrant. Spinner rigs would get the nod. Other wise fish the mainlake humps, keying in on the transitional spots that change from rock boulders to sand. Jig, rig and troll these area's and you will do fine. Move continually until you contact the fish as they bite almost throughout the day now. Night time in the shallows is tops if your after the larger fish which there are plenty in Ash and especially the large main lake basin to the east. If you tune into the conditions quickly when you arrive you should do better than ever, as the fishing is definately getting better by leaps and bounds. The strongest year class in ash bay is the 1995 year. There are many 5 year old fish in the north arm and the future is good.Good FishingJeff"
