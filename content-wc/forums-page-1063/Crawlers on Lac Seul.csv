508625,Guest,2000-06-26 22:58:00,0,"It works, rig them exactly the way you would use a real one. You will never take crawlers to Canada again. Plus I'm still fishing with some that have caught 15-20 walleye. Can you say that about a real night crawler??? That teaser tail just drives them NUTS!!!"
508626,Guest,2000-06-27 07:47:00,0,"Hi Jeff, I think you are right because I have heard of them before. What kind do you use? Do you use 4"" or 6""? I know they are power crawlers but are they the regular kind or is there a walleye kind? Thanks for the imput! -Nick"
508627,Guest,2000-06-27 18:13:00,0,"I AM GOING UP TO LAC SEUL FOR THE 14TH TIME IN A ROW. WE STAY AT FISHERMENS COVE NEXT TO SCOUT LAKE. AS FOR CRAWLERS VERVES MINNOWS, BOTH ABOUT THE SAME, LESS NORTHERNS ON CRAWLERS, MORE BAIT STEALERS, PERCH ON CRAWLERS. I HAVE NEVER FISHED POWER WORMS B/4. DO YOU BACK TROLL SLOW WITH THEM OR DO YOU CAST THEM WITH A JIG AND MOVE THEM FASTER THAN USING LIVE BAIT? IF SO HOW DO YOU KEEP BOTTOM CONTACT? WE ALWAYS AVERAGE 75/100 WALLEYES PER DAY.IF YOU SMELL A PIPE OUT ON THE WATER YOU NO I AM CLOSE BY. WILL BE THERE 7/8 THRU 7/14. ALSO DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE WATER LEVEL IS UP/DOWN?"
508628,Guest,2000-06-27 18:58:00,0,the water level is way up in the vaughn lake area near the town of hudson. We rigged power crawlers on spinners and bottom bouncers.
508629,Guest,2000-06-27 20:26:00,0,Do everything you would ordinarily do with a REAL CRAWLER.
508634,Guest,2000-06-27 20:34:00,0,"There are no ""WALLEYE"" kind of Power Crawlers that I know of. I use all 3 lenghts but 10 inch works real nice on Sagainaw Bay for 8-10 pound suspended walleyes with #5 and #6 spinner blades. They ONLY thing I don't LIKE about Power Crawlers if that God AWFUL SMELL."
508630,Jesse-WI,2000-06-27 21:19:00,534,The water level is about a month ahead of its normal schedule. You can check this site to get a reference if you have Acrobat reader installed.xxx.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2000.06.27.pdfWhat areas do your usually fish?

508632,Guest,2000-06-28 16:29:00,0,"I HAVE FISHED MOST ALL THE N/WEST LOCATIONS ALL THE WAY EAST TO VAUGHN LAKE. I LIKE SOME SPOTS ABOUT 6 MILES EAST OF MANITOBA POINT.DO REAL WELL IN SOUTH BAY, MCKENIZIE,WILLIAMS BAY,AND BROAD LAKE. WE TRAVEL TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION EACH DAY. MORNINGS FISH FOR WALLEYE, AFTERNOON FISH FOR NORTERNS AND SCOUT OTHER LOCATIONS FOR WALLEYE. LIKE FISHING JUST INSIDE WEED LINES THAT GO OUT TO 12' DEEP. THANKS FOR WATER LEVEL INFO ."

508615,Guest,2000-06-20 10:35:00,0,"Everyone who has given me info about walleye fishing on the NW side of Lac Seul tells me minnows, minnows, minnows. Is there anyone out there who has as much luck with crawlers? I want to make sure I'm well-prepared, but I don't want to haul crawlers & bedding with me if I don't have to. Thanks in advance. We leave in 17 days, 6 hours, 28 minutes. (Not that I'm anxious or anything.)"
508616,KnottyBuoy,2000-06-20 10:37:00,110,We have gotten them on minnows......leeches....crawlers.....and Berkley power baits.....fact is when they feed.....you can catch them on anything....
508617,Guest,2000-06-20 14:38:00,0,"Knottybouy is right for 99% of the time. About 5 years ago we were at Lac Suel in mid-August. I had elected to bring a flat of crawlers. I asked my 3 other buddies if they wanted to go in on it. They all refused all saying when they bite they on minnows as well as anything. Usually they were right, but not this time. After chasing the fish with minnows for 1/2 a day, I switched to crawlers and proceeded to catch 50 or so W's. Needless to say my boatmate also switched. When we returned to the dock everyone was talking about how bad the fishing was. Not so with us. Those crawlers became mighty popular with my buddies. I sold them for a dollar a piece and completely paid for my trip. (Not really.) Moral of the story, be a boy scout and be prepared."
508618,Guest,2000-06-20 15:25:00,0,"We are fishing at Whitewing resort this year, NW side of lake, compared to last year on the NE side of the flowage at Pickeral Arms Camp. I thought that the minnows went faster than the worms most of the time. But all in all I thought that it didn't matter what you put out there for the fish. I thought you got more pike with minnows and possibly bigger walleye but that is just my opinion. However, if you do use nightcrawlers they would probably be cheaper here than getting them in Canada and also you may get more perch on them as well. Where are you staying?"
508619,Guest,2000-06-21 10:51:00,0,"We'll be staying at Scout Lake Resort, which is on the NW side, but not as NW as most of the resorts. SLR is almost straight south of MacKenzie Bay. We'll be there July 8 - 15. I may grab some crawlers after reading the above. Minnows are also expensive and if crawlers catch fish ALMOST as well, they're probably worth the try."
508620,Guest,2000-06-21 11:58:00,0,"Have you considered using plastics rather than the real thing. If not, you may want to do so. I,ve been fishing north of Lac Seul for the last 4 years and have never used live bait. Catch all the Walleye's and Pike we want. Pretty much exclusively use pink 3/8 oz. jigs with 4"" white twisters. The camp owner has live bait, but says most of the time it just get's in the way.There is an interesting article in the latest Walleye Insider on this subject you may want to read also. Just got my copy yesterday and that was one of the first articles I read. Made a lot of sense. LOL Fred"
508621,River Rat,2000-06-25 18:06:00,43,I just got back from Lac Seul on June 24. We Fished the Vaughn lake area about 15 miles from Hudson. Three of us caught 125 walleyes in 2 1/2 days of fishing. We were actually a little disapointed. 90% of our fish were caught on spinners with crawlers. The water was very dirty from all the rain they have been getting and the may fly hatch was in full swing (two weeks early). We dont bother with minnows because of the exspense at the resorts. We brought leeches but crawlers ruled. It has been this way for us for the past several years. Minnows do work good though. We also caught quite a few on crankbaits. Good luck and be sure to post your results.

508623,Guest,2000-06-25 18:31:00,0,"What's all this nonsense on taking crawlers to Canada???? Since I discovered Berkely's Power Crawler, I haven't touched a night crawler in Canada for 10 years. I challenged 15 good walleye fisherman to fish against me with ""real Crawlers"" while I fished Power Crawlers"", and 13 could NOT out fish me, while 2 tied. When they ran out of the ""real"" crawler the favorite question was "" Jeff can I buy a couple of those Plastic crawler you got? Does anybody think a Canadien walleye wakes up in the morning and decides to ""go find a big juicy night crawler to eat""? The first night crawler he saw in his life was the one you showed him. The reason he hit it was because of the vibration of the Spinner not because it was real or a ""Memorex"". Try it and you will see what I mean while keeping your hands white and clean."
508624,Guest,2000-06-26 19:46:00,0,"Jeff, you are right. I tried power crawlers on my trip and they did work. I kept using real crawlers because of my confidence in them over power crawlers. It's something I have to get over. They sure keep your boat cleaner."
