508295,Guest,2000-06-13 06:00:00,0,"Sorry, I'm red, white & blue to the bone, but I have to side with the ""northerners"" on this one. There's a reason why the fishing is so good up there, it's because it's taken care of. If we had taken care of our lakes & wilderness the way the Candians have done, we would be enjoying the same fishing in northern US waters as what we enjoy in Canada now. I've been through the MNR roadblocks, been checked by the CO's on the lake, ""tore down"" at the border, the whole ball of wax. So what? Everytime we've come face to face with a Canadian official we've been polite, courteous and coopoerative. We have always been treated the same way we treat them. I've seen too many Americans throw childish tantrums just because somebody asked to see their fishing license. So what if their regulations are a little inconvienent? If it's such an issue, we'll let you bring your own bait to Iowa. I'll be happy to point you to a few good holes. Just not in July, I'll be ""suffering"" in Ontario."
508290,Sunshine,2000-06-13 06:15:00,3174,"Johnny,Please do not group All AMERICANS together. There's been a lot of Canadian bashing lately on this message board and I for one, apologize. Please understand that many fishermen and women are frustrated w/the netters, rising prices, and rising regulations. The small group of vocal anglers who lash out and vent on this site are not representatives of the majority. I've been coming to your beautiful country for 23 years now and I hope that I am welcome for another 23 years. I would continue to come if I was not allowed to bring any live bait, if I had to buy all my booze in your country, and if I couldn't bring any fish back to the U.S. These things are not important to me and many others. My ""escape"" to the pristine beauty of your country, the ability to forget about the ""real"" world for a short period of time, the lack of newspapers and TV, and most importantly, the sharing of sunsets w/ those I love will bring me back year after year. That is, if I'm invited to return. I never forget that I am a visitor to your country and I always try to leave it in better shape than when I arrived. Can't we all just get along?"
508253,fishinnut,2000-06-13 15:01:00,642,"Your arguement that stopping non-residents from bringing in leeches to prevent introduction of foreign species doesn't hold water. Leeches have been brought across the border for many, many years prior to the bann. If a foreign species was to enter the waters it would have been there long ago. Still think it's a money matter. AKA greed."
508296,Fred,2000-06-13 16:32:00,32,"I don't think Canada has crossed the line. While bait might be cheaper here, I understand their concern. You can always use artificials. My one buddy is harrassing me because I buy bait, he says in Canada it is not needed!As far as the CO checking you out, I would appreciate seeing a few more wardens at home in Wisconsin. I can't remember when the last time I was checked fishing in Wisconsin.At least in Canada you can still catch fish, the shoreline doesn't have summer home after summer home and jet skis don't run between your boat and the shoreline you are fishing!The Canadians I have met have been friendly and helpful."
508254,Guest,2000-06-13 16:52:00,0,"Greed is a pretty strong word. I would prefer the word job creation as a better choice. When you really think about it the amount of money expended on bait versus your entire trip, it doesn't really matter.It is only a very small part of the trip. Also I've used our Canadian leeches and the American ones when they were legal. Our Canadian leeches caught more walleyes and were not as dificult to handle as the American ones. Good fishing: Frank"
508275,Guest,2000-06-13 17:15:00,0,"There was a combination OPP and MNR inspection at Pigeon River the border outside of Thunder Bay this weekend. 18 US anglers were charged for a variety of offences including over limit, not having their fish identified ect. The MNR does this on a regular basis and I view this years checking as extremely positive. Last year I understand they had over 60 charges. Seems the word is getting out that we will not tolerate this type of activity. This is extremely positive. Good fishing: Frank"
508297,Guest,2000-06-13 19:13:00,0,"In my comings and goings across the Canadian Border for 40 some years...Thru BC, Alberta, Sask, Yukon, Ont., and Manitoba....I have had a heck of a lot more trouble with jerks with blue uniforms on our side than I have had with Canadian Customs agents. Sure...have had instances with both...but saw far more obnoxious U S agents than Canadian.However...it seems that I am noticing a growing hostility toward Americans at the border...in the last few years, that did not used to be there.Really too bad...I know many folks whom I count amongst my very best friends, that reside on the Canadian side of the border."
508298,Chevy,2000-06-13 19:56:00,5,"The increased enforcement of the regulations is a response to the increase of non sportsmanlike behaviour on both non resident and resident anglers alike. It appears from conversations I have with the enforcement officers that many people are not properly using or respecting the resources true sportspeople take great pride and care to conserve. Again, it appears a few are once again spoiling the fun for many anglers who abide by the rules."
508255,acp,2000-06-14 03:31:00,156,"You gotta be kidding:""Also I've used our Canadian leeches and the American ones when they were legal. Our Canadian leeches caught more walleyes and were not as dificult to handle as the American ones.""If I spend USD50.00 on 2 pounds of leeches, this is 5% of a USD1000.00 one week fishing trip. That's NOT insignificant.Later....Al"
508299,mkebenn,2000-06-14 03:52:00,59,"There is an obvious solution to this problem, don't break the law. AS a U.S. citizen (Canadians are as ""American"" as we are} I am VERY embarresed be all the violaters cited. What is wrong with you people? Our northern cousins have a magnificent country, respect it and care for it or don't cross the border. Mike in E.A."
508246,Dan,2000-06-11 16:00:00,325,Canada has crossed the line in their treatment on non-resident fishermen. They practically force the purchase of bait from Canadian baitshops. Only Canadians can trap minnows. Cannot bring in leeches. Next it will prohibit transporting crawlers over the border. Recently camped at Missinaibi Lake and were harrassed by Canadian conservation officers because we didnt have skin on the fillets we were about to fry for dinner that day and we had more than 2 fish in a bag. Then there is the outrageous per person camping fee without any facilities provided. Its time the U.S. reciprocated with similar restrictions on Canadians coming to the U.S.
508247,Guest,2000-06-11 16:25:00,0,The COs are just doing their jobs. Laws are rules of the land that everyone follows. Trapping minnows is allowed by locals only and we are only allowed one trap. The province is divided into minnow trap lines that the trappers have to pay a fee every year. This is why we are only allowed one trap and NR anglers can't catch their own. The crown land camping fee I am in total agreement with. We are harvesting a resource and you should have to pay for that. A lot of residents feel that NR anglers should stay at resorts and not be allowed on Crown land at all. As NR anglers in NW Ontario catch 75-80% of the walleye in this area and we just had a limit decrease from 6 to 4 you can see their point or I would hope you would.Tourism is a large employer in this area and the province is treating the resource as a business and so it should. If we are allowing NR anglers to harvest our walleye and we are not making money at it or employing people then this should be looked at.Good fishing: Frank
508248,fishinnut,2000-06-12 14:49:00,642,"If the non-residents boycotted Ontario for one summer the economy would crash. Think about the ""Dollars""(not lounies) that are spent in that province by non-residents. To risk the loss of those dollars, by harrassing non-residents doesn't make much sense. And if you could explain the bann on importing leeches I'm all ears."
508273,Guest,2000-06-12 15:52:00,0,"For us this will break our consecutive years streak at 11 going to Chamberlain narrows on lacsuel.Can't take the border hassles any longer, treating us worse than dirt."
508249,Guest,2000-06-12 17:27:00,0,"A CO doing his job by looking at your fish or informing you of common practice in packing your fish in this area of the province is not harrassment. The huge size of the area and the lack of CO's make it a very hard area to police, cut him a little slack. I know a lot of the CO's in the Thunder Bay area and if you feel you have been treated disrespectfully by all means file a complaint. You will be listened to. As far as the bait thing I'm not that familiar with it, but it sounds like a political thing to me. They want out of country fisherman to buy their bait in Canada.It employs locals who catch and sell the bait.The MNR I think is pushing more out of country anglers to stay at resorts which they probably feel employs people and has a greater return on value for the walleyes harvested."
508252,Guest,2000-06-12 17:37:00,0,"The importance of stopping the leeches from being brought into Canada is to prevent the introduction of new species into our lakes. Any new species such as leeches brought in and used here can cause the whole lake to be changed, most times for the worse. The fishing is good up here becuase we have such rules and they are there to keep it that way. If you think about it its a small price to pay for our baits, to keep our lakes going strong."
508274,Guest,2000-06-12 19:01:00,0,"Monday, June 12, 2000 U.S. anglers bustedTaken from the Toronto SunWINDSOR -- A Canadian crackdown resulted in nearly 7,000 kilos of fish caught by U.S. anglers being seized at the border this weekend. Officers from Canada Customs and the ministry of natural resources stopped every U.S.-plated vehicle Saturday. A total of 227 vehicles were searched, yielding 54 tickets for violations of Ontario fishery regulations and the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. A conservation officer said the high proportion of violations -- about one-in-four Americans inspected -- indicates the need for more checks."

508294,Guest,2000-06-13 04:44:00,0,"Face it folks. It's a limited resource. The meat hawgs and netters have necessitated a lot of the idiocy in the regs. The price of leeches are about the same and the crawlers typically come from Canada one way or the other. List the positives of a trip and if bringing home bags of fillets or taking your own bait are that big of a deal to you, I'd suggest you're missing the point. Try and remember you're a guest, not John Wayne storming the beach. At the end of the day, you can always vote with your dollars. I for one won't mind not running into some of the whiners who seem to relish *****ing more than Fishing."
