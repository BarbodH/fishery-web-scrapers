So I'm not pretending to be something that a lot of you guys are!I do enjoy fishing,bait fishing,jigging,trolling all kinds of fishing.I'm not a die hard C&R fan,but do see it's merit's.There's been a lot of bickering about laws,reg's,bait,booze,and yes even drugs(silly guys)but the bottom line is ,Do we all have something in common? I hope so!!As for the laws,respect them,it is impossible to please everyone,As for the bait,hey it's no big deal if you really think about it.Now on to the booze and drugs,If you really want a beer with your shore lunch,fine with me,just be a little discreet about it OK.As for the drugs,I can't speak on this because I know nothing about them(good for me)So come on guys,lets try to get along.If we all used some common sense,I'm sure we would all get along!!!Johnny T"
