We have fished this lake many years in the past and just went up there this last week and found this terrible thing out. The folks at Cranberry Portage could not issue the free pass and said we needed to go to sheridan. We even talked to a DNR guy up there who seems to be blowing it off. The fact is that in the new proc, it states that unless you camp or rent from someone you cant get onto the lake for non-residents, well guess what folks, right now I know of 28 different groups of people not coming to manitoba as this was the spots they went to and instead are going over to sask. The guy over at sheridan said if we rent a cabin then we could get on to the lake, but after we again pay 5.00 per day to fish it each day as well. What a bunch of S***. I think other states should start the same thing for non-residents and see what happens, except we know what will happen. They wont come anymore. With the reduced limits why should we and also put up with that. Needless to say we found another good spot to fish, because we already bought our license at russell, otherwise we too would have gone to sask. Next year we wont be back to manitoba because of people like them in Sheridan and we will to be going to sask. As you can tell I am very upset at this as some in our party have been going up there for the last 35 years. I can't believe one person/persons can regulate the DNR in this way and enforce there own laws.Sad to see this happen,rngrfshm"
508772,Guest,2000-06-28 18:55:00,0,"After I reading your post I looked up the particular regulations in the 2000 Manitoba Anglers Guide. It reads as follows: ""Kississing Lake and it's tributaries, including Bartlett Lake - lake trout limit is 1. All pike over 75 cm (30 in.)must be released. All nonresidents who fish must be registerd and staying with, and obtain a Special Angling Licence (free) from a Manitoba tourist operator with an allocation for this fishery."" I do not claim to know the reasons why these regulations were put into place on this particular area but if you were asked to pay $5.00 per day to fish over and above renting a campsite or cabin you have a legitimate complaint. However if what was occuring at Kississing in the past is similar to what has been taking place in areas nearby, then the Province may only be trying to encourage nonresidents to help support the local economy. Too many times nonresidents can be found pulled off the beaten path and setting up residence for the summer free of charge. While it may seem a great deal for them, it does nothing whatsoever for either the fishery or the local businesses. You also mention the reduced limits. What possible effect could a limit or 4 or 6 walleye have on you or your group if you're spending more than a day or 2 there? It seems to me that is plenty for eating, and in Manitoba your possesion limit and daily limit are the same. You are still allowed a limit to take home but THAT IS ALL. Unless of course you are in the habit of packing coolers full for the trip home. If that is the case then the locals will definately not miss having you there! There are hundreds of other lakes close by that are not restricted for nonresidents. You may consider heading to anyone of them, or you can follow the others over to Sask. In any case I wish you the best of luck in finding the spot you are looking for."
508773,rngrfshm,2000-06-29 10:25:00,313,"Hi MB,No we dont pack the coolers full of fish, in fact we only brought home 9 northerns between us 7 and left the majority of them and we where even shy on the walleyes. We dont like to take the fish that are big as this doesnt do an justice for your fishery as well as they are not the best to eat. The problem that we have was with the fact that the person in sheridan ""outfitter"" is controlling kississing lake. He would not give us that free license unless we rented a cabin and also paid an additional $5.00 a day to fish. That is the main grip that we have. Like I said we are not up there to bring back huge limits of fish home or anything of that nature as many in our group have been going up there many years in the past and just enjoy the resources that you folks have up there. As far as not helping the economy for the fisheries we buy the license which does help there fishery and also we had spent over 1200.00 there in cranberry portage for supplies and so forth so the economic help to this community is only going to get hurt by this fact as they wont have the support of people helping them out dollar wise like the non residents. The people at cranberry portage where very made at the regulation as they know it will hurt there economy. The island that is there on kississing we have been going to for the last 10 years and has all of our stuff setup on that island. As well as I know of many local folks that go to that island to camp. The reason we go to the island is to get away from the bears as we have had many come into our camp in the past.The biggest grip that we had was we took a 16' Sylvan dual console up there with a 50 on it assuming that going to kississing was ok. We bought our license and told the folks and also a DNR gue at the Pas that we where doing that and no one said anything about it, until we went to cranberry to get the permit. They would not give it to us and told use to go to sheridan, after that he would not give us the permit unless we rented a cabin and paid $5.00 a day. Luckly we also brought along two small 14 foot boats with a 15 and a 25 on that we used and portaged with to the other lakes there.Anyway that was our gripe as we went the whole way not knowing about the regulations on it until we where there. We also contacted the DNR before leaving here and they didnt mention that.Thanks for listening and responding but I dont think much of anything can be done. The words in the proc. that got us is the STAYING WITH. That is what did it. In fact two of the dnr guys at cranberry that we had talked to didnt even know that was in the regulations. They mentioned they would check up on it, but they never even took our name or address or phone number, so I dont think anything will happen. Like you said there is other lakes.

508774,Guest,2000-06-29 12:38:00,0,"From the latest details you provided I will be the first to agree that you do indeed have reason to complain. I did not realize that only one outfitter was given exclusive rights to the lake. I don't believe that any one person or group should ever be allowed special access to any natural resources to the exclusion of others. Some of these so-called outfitters seem to be able to get the ear of someone in high places to benefit themselves only. I also would like to get details on how this decision and others like it are arrived at. If an area is to designated as special access, at the very least it should be let out on Pubic Tender, not just given to somebody that has political pull."
508775,Guest,2000-06-29 22:01:00,0,"Wow... this could set one heck of a nasty precedence... As a Saskatchewan boy growing up on the Manitoba border (although now living in Alberta and not really paying attention to the Manitoba government policy), we fished Lake of the Prairies pretty much every summer (and winter). I can't imagine having to pay someone an additional $5 every evening/weekend we wanted to fish. Without knowing the full story (and there is ALWAYS two sides to every story) the only thing I can think is that the private outfitter in control of this lake has paid some kind of $$$ to the government for the rights to this lake. While I ***NEVER*** want to see something like this happen (ie: privatization of natural resources) I can see the logic (as stupid as it may be. Never underestimate the stupidity of government legislation) in that is provides extra revenue in the government's wallet. I think that we as anglers need to find out the complete story on this issue and speak up. Too many times we sit back and complain without ever actually doing anything about the situation. Whatever happened to ""Government for the people BY the people""???My two cents... <sliding the soap box back under the step> Good fishing all - I am sure the government of SK would welcome you - Lord knows they could use the revenue! <sigh>"
