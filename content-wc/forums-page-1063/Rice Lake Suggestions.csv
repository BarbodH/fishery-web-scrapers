508776,Guest,2000-06-26 20:40:00,0,I am heading up to Rice Lake next week with the family. Was wondering how the walleye were biting and if anyone had any suggestions for locations and presentations. Any information would be appreciated.
508777,Guest,2000-06-27 06:27:00,0,"Rice Lake is a fairly weedy lake. Usual techniques are either ripping the weeds with bucktails, dunking grubs on jigs into the holes, or fishing the weed edges which drop into deeper water. Also look to the outlet of the Otonabee River, the weed edges in the deeper water at the mouth are pretty productive. The lake also carries a healthy population of crappie and is also popular for it's bass fisherie. Hope this helps. Good Luck."

I usually jig the weeds beds betweem Long and Cow Island or the deep weed bed south of Spook Island. If you have an electric motor try jigging the weed lines as well. I prefer using bucktail jigs and my wife Mr. Twisters, both work; however, the bucktail jigs stay sharper longer. Get yourself a good hooksharpener. I'm staying at Sunshine Cove 2nd camp next to the Ononabee River."

They look like a heavy duty Mr. Twister without the plastic tail. They have horse or deer hair in place of the plastic tail. The best are hand made and can be purchased at local bait shops for about $1.75 Cdn each. All you need is 2 or 3 because they can take a lot of abuse. I fish the Eastern Basin of Lake Erie quite a bit, it's only 20 minutes from my house. I also fish the tip of Tick Island in the evenings. I have a white and blue Thundercraft with a 75 Suzuki. Perhaps we'll bump into each other."
