508828,Guest,2000-06-28 12:26:00,0,I am heading to Ear Falls the third week of September. We have never fished Lac Seul before and are looking for some advice on where to find some nice walleyes. Thanks for any info.
508829,Guest,2000-06-28 21:40:00,0,"Sept is usually a good time to fish LS. The eyes are starting their fall migration by then. Been up the 2nd week in Sept for the last 6 years. Fish are usually in 6-10' of water. Fish the windy side of points and islands. Close to Ear Falls try Saw Mill bay, Sands Island, Winnasauga River, Lunker Point, The small islands east of Cox's Island as well as Cox's Island. If you wish to venture further Try The big and small clay banks in McKenzie Bay, Ghost Narrows or Broad & Sunlight lakes.Usually jigs or spinner rigs will do the trick. Water temp is generally in the mid to lower 50's. Pack for summer and late fall. Can be warm 60's or cold (30's) or even in between. Morning boat ride can be quite brisk!Look at fishing reports for June as that is about the same pattern in ""normal years"". This year up there has been nothing but normal. Early ice out, spawn 2-3 weeks early, very warm spring, VERY wet late spring early mayfly hatch and snow 6/16. Who knows what the rest of the season will be like! There are fish to be caught if you can endure what mutha nature dishes out!"
