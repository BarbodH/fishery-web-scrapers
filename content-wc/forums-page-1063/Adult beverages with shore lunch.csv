508689,NAMBLA,2000-06-28 10:48:00,1,"Yo treblehook, I'm takin a youth group up pretty soon for some fishing and other activitys we plan on packin in some good blow any advice for gettin it thru customs with out gettin busted?"
508671,Guest,2000-06-23 07:34:00,0,"Seems like your the one who doesn't get it, this whole thing started out as a simple adult type question and you seem to want to treat people like kids, take a pill and READ the responses instead of making a mountain of a mole hill.From what I read it's a couple beer (2) not a six pack each."
508681,Guest,2000-06-24 08:39:00,0,"Hey guys, maybe you should travel up to Saskatchewan if you want a couple of wobbly pops with your shore lunch!! It's still illegal here but it's not enforced very heavily and I have never been ticketed for beer in a boat!!! And these fine saskatchewan walleyes taste mighty fine washed down with a cool bottle of suds!!Saskman"
508682,Guest,2000-06-24 13:42:00,0,"Saskman, we salute you!"
508663,Guest,2000-06-26 13:43:00,0,"Does anybody remember the good ole days when you took as much suds you wanted fishing? But a few ruined it for all just like everything else. Now before the bashing starts, fishing was at one time a recreational sport, you could have a few beers and a sandwich while enjoying yourself. I would like to see it resored to the old days, maybe some rule modifications, ready? 1. If your going to booze you must have a life vest on at all times. 2. A 9.9 max HP rating ( that way there speed is not a issue ) 3. The driver can have a couple but set a limit 1 to 2 per hour? I mean we all work all week and cannot even relax on the lake no more, but rules are rules so I will comply. BTW I am speaking for the USA and there is never no booze in my boat, I wait till Im done fishing and poundem when Im cleaning the fish Good fishing"
508664,Eyesore,2000-06-26 14:46:00,455,"Eyemadmad, I agree with you about the good ole day's, beer in the boat, etc... But to propose crap like only in a boat with 9.9 horse or must have a life jacket on, or only 2 beers per hour...I say B.S! You sound like you are running for parlament. Where I am from, a man can drink in a boat, as the driver, and are not required to wear a life jacket. If we ever loose these rights, it won't be because of the fishermen, it will be because of the dick-heads on jet ski's and the like. Don't get me wrong about drinking in the boat without limitations- .10 is it. Let me put it to you this way, If the USA and especialy canada dint pass another law for the next 50 years-in2050 both countries would still be over-regulated!"
508683,Guest,2000-06-26 20:20:00,0,"Count me in Saskman, I fish with you any time, I all for hanging the drunks that drive or boat but whats wrong with a couple of beers in a days fishing, sometimes I needs more when fishing with the wife all day but that can wait until back at camp. Good Fishing"
508684,treblehook,2000-06-27 14:15:00,3,"I dont know what the problem is with this ""drinkin in the boat in Canada"" is. The secret is to get plenty jagged before ya head out and take drugs with you in the boat cause they're easier to hide!"
508685,Guest,2000-06-27 20:58:00,0,...AHHh hiccup.....AHHHH ... errrrrr...hiccup see.....ya I see what yer meen there tremblmblecrook...Did i tell ya (hiccup) I use ta be a alcoholoc (hiccup) butt I goin ta change ma drinkin ways i meen i goin to drint some gerd wisky fer a change. wat kinna druuuuugs hiccup ta got ther budy.

508686,Guest,2000-06-27 22:30:00,0,What about smoking a few doobs while boating? Do they also frown on this as well?
508687,Guest,2000-06-27 22:55:00,0,"Like WOW DUDE....inhale....Like i havent had good columbo in 20 years Man. Like man got a OPP buddy who hussles americans for good ....inhale....stuff man.. sells it to me at a good stash. Hey got a clip....dude through it in ma live well, QUICK HERE comes THE POO_LICE.

508670,Jim,2000-06-22 15:33:00,238,"U guys don't get it, and u r close minded! Good luck and be safe!JIM"
508662,Guest,2000-06-22 15:33:00,0,"Big Al, you are right on the money about being a policed state. In the states, we can fish and drink. Havent lost all of our rights"
508673,Guest,2000-06-22 18:24:00,0,"drinking on houseboats in ontario? Three guesses, Everything else is illegal. Good luck fishing"
508674,Guest,2000-06-22 18:55:00,0,"As far as I know, here in ontario this law applies equally to boats and other motorized vehicles. If the vehicle you are in has a built-in washroom with toilet (not a port-a-potty) then you are allowed to drink. However the driver may not, and all booze must be out of the drivers reach. This is why you're allowed to drink in chartered busses. I'm prety sure that this is equally true for houseboats and cabin cruisers.Dave Leschied"
508675,Guest,2000-06-22 20:08:00,0,"Now you know why none of Canadians drink, nor smoke, nor gamble. -:)"
508676,Guest,2000-06-22 21:43:00,0,"Do they have OPP in your Canadien bedrooms ""policing "" the action??? Seems like they POLICE everthing else."
508677,Guest,2000-06-23 06:14:00,0,"Jeff your almost right there... if Canadian politicians have their way they'll be the ones doing the policing in the bedrooms. In the newly printed Canadian Better Boating (a publication to help individuals get their ""better boating license""), it says that alcohol is allowed on house boats as long as your anchored for the night, have a toilet and the driver not drinking, finally you have to have night lights set up on your houseboat."
508678,Guest,2000-06-23 06:55:00,0,uhhhhhh.....Jeff?It wasn't the police who left those handcuffs...
508679,Guest,2000-06-23 06:59:00,0,What do they call 100 OPP and Canadien govement officials in handcuffs on the bottom of Hudson Bay??? ANSWER--A GREAT START!!!
508680,Guest,2000-06-23 07:24:00,0,"A houseboat is considered your residence if you have a galley, you can drink all you want while at anchor, otherwise the rules of the road apply as far as drinking and driving are concerened, you can have booze on board but not within reach of the driver."
508658,Guest,2000-06-22 06:46:00,0,"What is the actual Ontario ruling on alchohol in the boat? My group enjoys a couple of beers with our shore lunch but we've had Ontario DNR officers inform us during license checks that if the OPP had stopped us we would be arrested for the empties in our boat. We police our shorelunch site pretty thoroughly and would never leave the cans or sink them as some have suggested. Do we just need to keep them out of sight or give it up altogether? If someone is obviously drunk and operating a boat erratically, bust 'em. But a couple with lunch? What do you think? We fish the Winnipeg river area north of Kenora."
508659,acp,2000-06-22 07:09:00,156,Alcoholic beverages are not allowed in a boat whether they be open or closed.Later....Al
508660,Guest,2000-06-22 09:55:00,0,"The law states that you can't have ""booze"" other than your residence, if your camping overnight then that is considered your residence, a fishing boat or a shore is not.Myself I feel here in Ont. we are becoming a ""Police State"" more and more all the time and I agree with you that a couple of ""brown pop"" with shore lunch does no one any harm, But don't let the O.P.P. catch you or be prepared to shell out some cash for fines.By the way, what is the law in your state re: Beer with shore lunch?"
508661,Guest,2000-06-22 10:02:00,0,"In Minnesota where I'm from, there is no law against alchohol in the boat but if your'e pulled over and test legally drunk you will be treated as if you are in your vehicle on the road. Jail, fines and all the rest. I have no problem with that."
508665,Jim,2000-06-22 11:03:00,238,"Can't you f*¢kîn contain yourselves??? If u are gonna get your self drunk, do it at hoe where you won't harm others driving your boat! I have no problem with drinking, but do it at home, and not when you are driving to the lake or on the lake!!!Have a designated driver 4 your shore lunch, or maybe drink some pop or something!Good fishing!JIM"
508666,Guest,2000-06-22 11:14:00,0,"Hey Jim, we're talkin' about a couple of beers with lunch, not a binge as you infer. We would rather fish than drink anyway."
508667,Guest,2000-06-22 11:25:00,0,"Jim, you need to calm down. Maybe you need a beer or something...Nice language by the way!"
508668,Jim,2000-06-22 14:20:00,238,"Doesn't matter, save the beer for back at the camp site. And yes, you say i need to lighten up, tell that to the people at the emergency room that you hit with your boat while driving intoxicated...drinkin and drivin don't mix buddy!Jim"
508672,Guest,2000-06-22 14:31:00,0,How does this law apply to Houseboats? Anyone know?
508669,Guest,2000-06-22 15:28:00,0,"Easy jim. EEEEasy does it now. I do agree with you though, cause after 1 beer with a shore lunch, I am just HAMMERED!"
