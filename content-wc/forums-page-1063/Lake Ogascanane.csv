508168,Guest,2000-06-06 10:25:00,0,Planning to travel up here the latter part of August or early September. Can anyone give me some walleye and pike patterns for this time of year? Thanks in advance.
508169,Jim,2000-06-25 16:24:00,238,Are you referring to Ogascanan Lodge owned by the Mullens family? I will be going there from July 8th thru 15th staying at the Island Outpost. This lake is north of Temaskiming in Quebec. Keep in touch and I will let you know how we do. I'm looking for information myself before the trip.
