508716,Guest,2000-06-25 17:02:00,0,"We were on de Mille Lacs June 10-14. Weather was not very stable but fishing was still pretty good. We didn't catch any fish over 24"" but always had enough for meals. Three boats, nine guys and we probably caught close to 400 walleyes with the best day being around 115. Some people weren't catching much but some others did much better than us for size but not the numbers. Caught most fish jigging after locating them draging cranks or spinners behind bouncers. Fish were anywhere from 6-35 ft. but most were in 15-20 ft. Good luck...Skeeter Boy"
508717,Guest,2000-06-27 13:13:00,0,The MNR is conducting a summer creel on the lake. I'm wondering if you were creeled or if any other users of this site were creeled . The fish club I belong to did the winter creel with the MNR this last winter. We are very interested in this lake. Good fishing: Frank
