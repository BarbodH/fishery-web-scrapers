508812,Guest,2000-06-27 12:18:00,0,Does a non-resident minor require a Canadian fishing license if fishing with (non-resident) licensed parent? (In MN my son doesn't require license until age 16.)We're headed up to Lake of Woods over 4th July.
508813,Fred_G,2000-06-27 12:51:00,908,"Your son is not required to have a fishing license, however he will not be able to keep any fish. If you want him to be able totake some fish home he will need a license. LOL Fred"

508815,fishinnut,2000-06-27 20:41:00,642,Your sons catch count toward your bag limit.
508816,Fred,2000-06-27 20:51:00,32,"I just got back from Canada with my 12 yr old son and I believe you are both right. As it was explained to me, my son could fish on my license. But if he wanted to bring fish home, IE an extra limit, he needed his own license. I debated on it, but I spent the money and bought the license. The number of addittion fish harveted was only 4, and per fish they are expensive. However, the money hopefully goes to fishery management so it might be well spent anyway!"
