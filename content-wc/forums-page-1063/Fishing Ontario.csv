Already looking for another camp and trip for next year. Looking for a good fishing lake with good accomodations. Dog Lake is quite large, so looking for something a little smaller. Just want to be able to catch fish, eat some good food, and have friendly people running the camp! Our target date for going would be the 3rd or 4th week of June. Would like to keep the traveling distance within 300 mile of Ste Saint Marie. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated from this Ohioan!"
508784,Jim,2000-06-27 08:31:00,238,"From Sault St. Marie, you could head northwest to Hornepayne. I fished at a lake called Buffalo Island. It is about 2 miles long and 1/2 mile wide. Only cabin on the lake. You get 2 boats and a canoe plus motors. It is through Oliver's Fly In Camps in Hornepayne. A ton of walleye and northerns and some big perch. Not a deep lake (max. depth I think is 35 feet). It is rustic with no electricity or running water. But the cabin is nice and roomy for up to 4 people. Three of us caught over 435 walleye and 42 northerns (did not really fish for them) and over 50 jumbo perch (did not fish for them either) and we did not fish one day due to weather. We went there the 2nd week of June. There is also a portage lake about 1/2-3/4 mile through the woods. The portage lake is accessible by road, but Buffalo Island is not. It is within your driving range. I too am from Ohio (near Youngstown). I wanted to try somewhere different this year so I am heading to Quebec next Friday (Jul 8th). Give Oliver's a call."
