Anyone know if mandatory boating insurance is on the horizon? I know where we live and I know if the gov't and insurance industry smells money, they will put a premium on the activity in question.Thoughts?Tom"

I would believe you can be found at fault if someone were injured or you caused damage to someones property. If you did not have ins to protect yourself you could be wiped out, in this sue the guy attitude, world."

My snow-machine never went anywhere except from the back of my pickup, out to the icefishing holes and back....yet my premium was the same as anyone else's...with or without trail permit...so it had little value to me personally. Same goes with the boat...it ain't no speed demon and I don't recon I'll plow into anyone in my lifetime. Doesn't mean I won't be facing the mandatory liability in the future...be it driving a boat on the choked up S. Ontario lakes or boating in the relatively remote lakes up North. I know it's coming...just a matter of when and how much."

If your boat is still not paid off then no doubt your bank would require your boat be insured. Insurance for jet skis is insanely high, so if it was mandatory many would be forced off the lakes. Awwwwww. Insurance is only 300 bucks or so a year, so for peace of mind, a sound investment."
