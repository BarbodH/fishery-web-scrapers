526542,mrwalleye5,2003-01-17 20:36:00,1922,One of my wife's coworkers has a 1/2 share in a tow truck business. He said last sunday he spent 18 hours getting a 1/2 ton and a tow truck that had tried to rescue the 1/2 ton out of the river. It was up either on Nettley Creek or just where it comes out to the Red. That suprises me. Flow has been very slow. I would have thought there would have been lots of ice. You just never know.
