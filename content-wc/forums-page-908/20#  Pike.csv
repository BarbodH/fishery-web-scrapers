526378,stewart,2003-01-13 15:03:00,100,"Talking to guides at Molson Lake in Manitoba, and suppossedly their outpost Max Lake is really good. Knee Lake of course, but again word is your best to do a fly out from their main lake too. Just what I've heard from guys who have worked there."
526379,Guest,2003-01-13 19:02:00,0,"This months issue of In Fisherman has a list of the best big pike waters in Canada, you might want to check it out."
526380,sdyer,2003-01-14 06:16:00,34,The lodge that I work for has many 20lb pike and a sand runway that was once used in the 50's and 60's to fly gold out the bush. We also used the strip in the 90's to fly guests into our camp. E-mail me if you would like more info. Good luck
