How would you rate the quantity / quality of the fishing opportunities? And if you have an opinion, what lodge would you recommend?Thanks."

In the last 5 years fishing result are picking up with a new association that was put in place to raise the quality of the fisheries. If you wantto have a look this a link with a very nice outfitter. http://www.pointedavid.ca/anglais_01.html"

You have to throw back 12 inches or less, I find that really reasonnable to do that all the time and anywhere. All of this because pochers emptied it.The reservoir is huge, and you can't figure out how it could of been emptied a feww years ago.As for Pikes and Lakers there a decent size and you can hope to catch the one of your dreams.And as for the scenery it is astonnishing !"

However, if the average size of walleyes is one half pound as Nemio states, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. There are a plethora of outfitters in western Quebec that cater to the walleye fisherman. And many of their lakes afford access to lake trout, white fish and northern pike as well. The web site below provide the names of many of Quebec's outfitters by region: http://www.pleinair-quebec.com/pourvoiries.htmlJay"
