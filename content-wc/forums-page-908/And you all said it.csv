They are usually charged with a minor crime then don't get a hearing till May at which time the charges are dropped. When we cut back on mental hospitals all we really did was shift the burden of care to a different jurisdiction. Seems to be a common solution these days.
526309,Guest,2003-01-13 20:39:00,0,"The canadian government will learn that crime is low in this area (NWO)because a person about to commit a break&enter knows that the house they're about to enter has a firearm inside.I will hide my guns before I give more money to the government.I'm sick of paying for natives, single mothers and government pensions.I won't ever vote liberal again!!!!!!!It's like ""hydro ones"" debt reduction charge! Why should we pay because some c.e.o ran it into the ground? It's like the price of a fishing licence,that's gone up every year! where does that money go? the slot size saved the fishing,not C.O's. It's like telling a person that worked all their lives and has cancer not to smoke ""pot"" for the pain, because they are criminals in the laws eyes. The canadian way of life has gone to sh t!They have to stop playing ""follow the leader"" with the U.S!! I realize that our area has different views compared to southern ontario but its unfortunate that we live with the brunt of their problems, and all they do is take our tax money and our resources. I don't care if we have way less people, at least I can leave my keys in my truck if I want.It starts with ""respect""...not gun registration. I know people might not like some of the things I said but I don't give a fu k!!!!"
526310,bigfish1965,2003-01-14 20:59:00,3210,"Silly boy... People don't break into homes in NWO because they are 50 miles apart and odds are the owners are home. They don't care if you have a gun..in fact they may hope you do so they can steal it. I live in southern Ontario and leave my doors unlocked too. Guess what..I don't have a gun! If you are sick of paying for government pensions, by all means refuse yours when you retire. No one can force you to be a hypocrite. Thank Bill Davis' big blue machine for forging the path to a mammoth debt-ridden utility. The present conservative government then pulled the rug out from under us buy selling us to the wolves. The liberals have had nothing to do with it. As far as southern ontario taking taxes from the north...get your head out of your butt. The flow of revenue is now and has always been to the north. I hate Toronto and everything about it, but they generate the vast majority of revenue in the province. It's their park, so place nice or stay home."

526296,River_eye,2003-01-09 12:22:00,1486,"I've always thought, one of the great things about Canada is that it gets cold every winter. People are taught early that in order to keep yourself warm in the winter, you must cut wood (ie. work). Homelessness is a lot easier and more attractive when you can walk around in a short sleeve shirt all year round."
526297,Guest,2003-01-09 15:55:00,0,North Dakota is one of the least populated states in the Union. It is said that 40 below winters keep out the riff raff. I suppose that the same logic goes for Canada.Ivy

With a rifle, if you run out of bullets, you can whack the bear over the head...harder to do it with a glock..lol. I have not seen firearms stas here broken down into handgun versus long gun as they relate to crime. Copernic search engine will be working for me tonite."

526289,bigfish1965,2003-01-08 13:05:00,3210,"Well, at least we concur River_eye. I do believe having some semblance of order is necessary as far as guns go. We do need to try and do what we can to keep them in the hands of law abiding citizens, but this registration process got stupid real fast. 1 billion dollars is totally ridiculous. Register them at point of sale and be done with it.The one post about gun-murder rate was using slightly inflated statistics, but the general concept was true. Canada's gun crime rate is a fraction of the U.S.( and yes this is adjusted for population and densities and all stats are quoted PER CAPITA.) It may or may not have anything to do with gun control. It may be about politics, economics or religion..I don't know. Maybe we get all our aggression out playing hockey and we're too tired later for anything else. I am not as afraid of our government as many people are. I know many politicians and realize they are not now, nor will ever be, competent enough to pull off a confiscation without messing the entire process up. They can't even get them registered...how can they ever come get them? Hunting and fishing were entrenched by law as instrinsics rights. No lawmakers are allowed to tamper with those rights."
526290,Vitreum,2003-01-08 14:40:00,221,"actually jason, we have about 10-11 times as many firearm murders per capita than canada. many, many, many of these murders cn be related to the drug trade in our inner cities. also, we have far more handguns than canadians. 80 million to 1 million roughly. on a per capita basis, we should only have about 10 million handguns. about 50% of our households have firearms (all kinds) and about 20% of canadian households have them. as someone mentioned earlier, the worst murder rates with guns occur where we have the toughest gun laws. dc and new york come to mind. we have a problem and we know it. but, we are not about to disarm the law abiding citizens because of the misbehavior of a very small percentage of our population. gun ownership is protected by our constitution. you say that you trust your government and that is fine. it is a long standing and deeply entrenched american tradition to not trust our government. that is why we have the second amendment. that is why it was included in our constitution. as far as president bush goes, he is very popular and loved in our country. columbine and the maryland sniper; both violations of our current gun laws. should we write more gun laws? would that have stopped them? bush buddies getting rich over iraq? the world price of oil should drop significantly after the war? that hardly helps the oil field bunch. planes flying into buildings in new york? i sure hope not. but, if they do, we will rebuild them better than before. that's the way we are. we have a free society and know that we are vulnerable. if i were you, i would stop worrying about us down here. we will take care of ourselves. thank you very much."
526291,bigfish1965,2003-01-08 15:44:00,3210,"Good post Vitreum..however, I believe at last count we had over 13 million guns in Canada..I will get the actual numbers from the Stats Can site and post."
526303,Guest,2003-01-08 19:59:00,0,"While I understand your concern about the loss of freedom, real or perceived. As a US resident, and canadian land owner, the gun registration works for me. I took the course, paid for a POL, registered several guns free of charge over the internet, and am good to go. The fastest border crossing we had last year was when I answered the ""do you have a firearm?"" question, handed over my picture ID on the POL, and a gun registeration card. They couldn't get rid of me fast enough, and never even finished the usual questions. This let me through the border without paying tax on goods I would have declared. The biggest down side for me is all the hoopla about locking the firearms up when not in use, but safety is hard to argue. I am not afraid of your politicians coming down here to get my guns, as they are already registered by the gun control act of 1968.And either goverment would have to find me with the gun in my hand to know where it was at."
526294,Guest,2003-01-09 05:15:00,0,Good post vitreum....As a Canadian I think that Americans or some of them should start with anger management and spending more money on the poor and educating them and providing meaningfull jobs. This would cut down on a lot of your crime. Canada has a small problem with the homeless but you guys are in a terrible state and whats with this disenfranchising people especially blacks.
526279,Guest,2003-01-09 06:30:00,0,Do you think gun use has not had a snowball effect in the last 50 yrs?
526305,Hunter,2003-01-09 09:24:00,346,"I dont trust are thieveing government as far as I could spit on them,, just a bunch of corrupt politicians and it starts at the top! The best thing we could do for ourselves is get the liberals out of office and take away theyre pensions!"
526292,Vitreum,2003-01-09 11:13:00,221,"bigfish, you are probably right on total firearms. i've seen figures of over 11 million. i was speaking of handguns when i quoted that 1 million figure. i believe that all of these figures for both sides of the border are estimates."
526295,Vitreum,2003-01-09 12:06:00,221,"hi c-guy. i don't know much about anger management, but it sounds like psychobabble to me. i just do not know. as far as spending money on the poor, we've spent plenty. starting with the lbj administration and the great society (i think that's what they called it), we have spent trillions. i'm not sure that they have done much good. many of the the school systems that spend the most per pupil in this country have some of the poorest results. in general, crime in this country is committed by a very small group. problem is that they commit them over and over. homelessness. that's a tough one. back in the 1960s, due to a supreme court ruling, we virtually emptied out our mental institutions into the streets. basically, if they are not a threat to themselves or their fellow man, we cannot touch them. they wander our streets. most of our homeless are drug/alcohol addicted or mentally ill folks, sometimes both. and finally disenfranchisement. don't believe everything you read or hear. that's the cry that you hear when election officials in this country try to enforce our laws in certain areas. enforcing things like being registered before voting, not voting if you are a felon, not voting twice, not voting if you are dead, etc are usually what trigger these charges. it's all just noise. noone who is properly registered and legally allowed to vote is stopped from doing so in this country. now, i'm gonna stop posting on this thread and get back to talking about fishing. hope you all will join me."
526304,River_eye,2003-01-09 12:19:00,1486,"Well, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it either if it was done efficiently and cost-effectively. We simply do not have $1 billion to spend on somthing like this."
526277,Guest,2003-01-07 12:38:00,0,"Tampa Tribune,1-5-03 Ottawa...About 100 antigun-control protesters gathered outside Parliment on Wednesday,burning their registration certificates on the first day under a law that requires all guns in Canada to be regersted. One man was arrested for handling an unloaded handgun at a public gathering,but police said there were no other arrests. Under the law,Canadians were required to register their firearms or declare their intent to do so by midnight Tuesday. Previously,gun owners had to get a seperate license by the start of 2001,and 1.9million of an estimated 2.3 million complied,according to the Canadian Firearms Centre that runs the program. A 1989 shooting rampage that killed 14 women at a Montreal engineering schoolwas the catalyst that led to adoption of the program. Opponents say it targets law-abiding hunters and other gun owners while failing to reduce the availability of guns for criminals.Gun control advocates say more time is needed to determine if the system works. ************************************************** ********************Ya, they won't make us register our guns.....then it was, They only want to register handguns,Now it's , register them all boys.......next it's gonna be turn em in or go to jail. you just watch!"
526278,Nette B,2003-01-07 13:04:00,39,"Gun control is a snowball effect. For this reason, even minor gun control efforts must be warded against in the U.S. Its too bad...tough luck for Canadians...Nette B"
526280,Guest,2003-01-07 13:46:00,0,"While this topic has little to do with fishing, I will say this . . . It is true that current Canadian gun control efforts are flawed, but that does not mean we should neglect the fact that many people are unlawfully using guns. Of all nations, Americans should know this best, as they have far more gun-related crimes than any other country in the world. In fact, gun-related murders in the U.S. is roughly 6000% to that in Canada (i.e., a ratio of approximately 60 to 1), despite the fact that Canada has far more guns per capita. How can this be explained? I suggest watching Michael Moore's new movie ""Bowling for Columbine"" to anyone interested in this debate!!!!Is the gun registry in Canada hurting the wrong people? The answer I believe is yes to some degree, but at the same time let us not forget the high school shootings, the sniper in Maryland, etc, etc, etc. Should we not be doing something? For the most part, we here in Canada trust our government to do the right thing for society as a whole, far more than in the U.S. Not that I blame Americans, for I wouldn't trust that government either. Anyone who thinks Bush and his corporate colleagues are not corrupt had better open his/her eyes. The evidence is all out there, just search for it! That said . . . under the current government, Americans have nothing to worry about losing gun priviledges. The war makes Bush and his buddies very, very rich! Just don't be surprised the next time a plane flies into a large building in Manhatten!!!!Jason"
526281,Ivy,2003-01-07 15:49:00,556,"Jason,You should have left it at this has little to with fishing. I will not comment on your Canadian gun laws,that is your problem to fix or not. However your comments on my goverment deserve a response. You stated that our President George Bush is corrupt. O.K. Please show me the evidence proving this. I don't have the time to "" search for it"" You said it, you prove it. In my world, when someone makes a wild statment they should either prove it or shut up or be sued for slander.You have mixed so many subjects at trying to prove a point ( which I am not sure what it is ) you could make Martha Stewart jealous. The U.S. gun crime statistics you have quoted have little to do with Canada. And due to the vast differences in population and density it would be unwise to compare the two. And your comment about "" Just don't be surprised the next time a plane flies into a large building in Manhatten"" is just plain goofy. No it is worse than that, it's idioticWhy don't you limit yourself to the topic of fishing. It is quite clear that you have little knowledge on anything else.Ivy"
526282,Guest,2003-01-07 17:03:00,0,"Obviously, there is still free speech in Canada. Maybe that'll be the next freedom lost, Ivy. Slowly, little by little, for over 30 years, small freedoms have been lost The younger adults don't even know how wonderfully free Canada used to be."
526283,aaron,2003-01-07 19:39:00,6,"The gun laws in canada are a right that was taken from us by politicians.Im just as upset as you are!....but dont make stupid coments about 9/11,that gets no point across.Maybe ask your M.P why no natives have to regester firearms?For 20years i have heard about how rough natives have it,that makes me sick!!! nwo for life"
526285,River_eye,2003-01-07 21:54:00,1486,"I will not defend our government in any way on this one. I don't even own a gun, but I don't think my neighbour should have to register his.We might see gun related incidents go down 0.001%, but is that worth $1 billion? It will stay the same, almost all crimes committed will be with handguns, which have long been subject to registration anyways, and virtually all guns used to commit crimes will be unregistered.This will go down in history with all other government blunders."
526286,Lundman 1700,2003-01-08 09:12:00,65,"I agree Bigfish. It is a blunder, if they are doing it to cut down on firearm deaths. They want to see this go through at all costs because they have a hidden agenda. This is just the method they are using to get a list of all of our guns. Once they get the list they will come a knocking. It's the only thing that makes any sense. No one in their right mind would think this is worth the money they are throwing at it for the reasons they say.As for the Montreal massacre, if he didn't have a gun he would have used something else to kill those women. It doesn't matter how many laws you have they will still not be able to stop the nutjobs."
526287,River_eye,2003-01-08 09:25:00,1486,"Although Bigfish and I are different people, your guess at total confiscation may not be too far off the mark. Although it would create an uproar if it happened tomorrow, who's to say whether an event won't happen that will make confiscation acceptable? Crazier things have happened."
526288,Guest,2003-01-08 11:44:00,0,As an American I envy Canada. Much less gun violence and frankly little need to impose additional regulations regarding gun control. Bottom line is the US cities with the most stringent laws have the most violence related to guns; and yes the facts support my statement.Your government's actions regarding gun control; simply idiotic.
