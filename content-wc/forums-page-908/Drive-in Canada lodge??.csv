525883,Ohio fisherman,2003-01-13 09:58:00,989,"Hi Rocky:Thanks for the info. I would love to visit the NW area of Ontario, but it is just too far and as you say too brutal to drive for a week. So, I will continue to search for a good place in the eastern part of Ontario.Good fishing, Ohio fisherman"
525884,Guest,2003-01-13 12:02:00,0,"I know the perfect place for you!!!! You need to go to campfire island lodge. It is located on Rainy Lake, the best smallmouth fishery in north america according to al linder. You automatically get guides that know the water very well, and get to cruise the lakes in 20ft Lund ProGuide Boats with 75 hp Honda's. Its a great place and you will catch a lot of huge smallmouth. I've been there many of times, Dean and the rest of the guides will do everything to make you happy. Enjoy your trip. Call (807)-274-9500 or go to there email address and www.campfireisland.comTell them CoonCain sent you."
525875,5Paulie4,2003-01-16 05:28:00,34,"The distance from Buffalo would be about 10 or 10.5 hours. I will attest to the great fishing at O'Sullivan. Lots of walleye and there are plenty of 20 lb northerns lurking about. (A few years back I tossed back a 24 pounder that I'll try to catch again this year, now that he's grown up) Lakers, too. The accommodations are comfortable (indoor facilities per cabin, electricity, etc.) Lots of water to fish including guided trophy fishing in outpost areas. I've been going since 1980 and I keep returning because, frankly, for the price and the outstanding fishing, no one's been able to convince me that there's a better value in Quebec. American and Housekeeping plans are available. Love it!Thunderstick"

They all loved it. Great walleye and pike fishing they say, and a lot of water to explore. I know they would all recommend it to anyone. The only reason we do not go there now is that we decided to try a place a few hours further north and have had good luck. O'Sullivan is a little pricier also, although the accomodations are nicer than where we go now. I talked to the people from O'Sullivan last year at the Cleveland sport show, and they are really nice. I have been thinking about taking my father back there. I think it would probably be a 14 to 15 hour drive from Cleveland."

525870,Brian_MN,2002-12-22 19:10:00,738,"You're describing Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the Woods. You can bring your own boat, and they cook all your meals. For lunch, you have the option of coming into the lodge, having them pack you bag lunches, or having them give you a shore lunch box. The box has everything you need in it for a great shore lunch except for the fish! They even pack a couple cans of spaghetti just in case. Every year we've been up, the staff has been fantastic. The dock boys meet you at the dock when you come in, take your fish to the cleaning house for you where they're cleaned, wrapped, and frozen. They'll gas up your boat, replenish your bait supply, and even vacuum it out for you if you ask nice! The cabin girls clean your cabin every day while you're out fishing, bring coffee to your cabin before sun-up, and serve all the meals. The camp has about a dozen cabins, with a wide variety of sizes from 2 beds to 13. They have a couple of duplex cabins with shared screen porches that are great for groups of friends who want to be close but still have some privacy. The brand new cabin has 3 bedrooms downstairs, 8 beds in an upstairs loft, a big table for playing cards, a gas stove, and a great view of the lake from the huge front porch. The part of Lake of the Woods they're on is very remote, and it's common to spend a week up there without seeing anyone except for your fellow guests. The fishing is nothing short of phenomenal. Smallies, walleyes, northerns, crappies, and muskies can all be caught within a mile of camp. July is a great time to come up, because all species have fallen into predictable patterns. A few days of stable weather gets everything going at the same time. The best thing about Witch Bay is the fishing program. When you arrive, you can hook up with the resident Canadian guide or one of the visiting Pros to get the lowdown on the fishing. They'll mark up your map, show you when, where, and how to catch what your're after, and even lead you out the next morning to make sure you get a good start. Some guests spent their entire time working with the Pros every day. The nice thing is that there's always someone there who's already been there for a week or two before you, so they're on fish, and will share everything they know. Gail and Steve Hockett own and run the camp and are the best hosts our party has ever stayed with. My brother forgot a toothbrush one year, and by the time we got back in from fishing that night, Gail had traveled into Kenora and picked him up a new one! Steve's one of the best muskie and smallie guys on the lake, and really likes to sit in the Liars Nest (the gazebo down by the water) in the evenings and share his secrets with guests. I apoligize if this sounds like a paid commercial, but we really love Witch Bay Camp. My Dad, brothers, and I tried several other places, a different camp every year, but we found Witch Bay about 4 years ago and haven't stayed anywhere else since. The quality of the fishing gets better every year, and the camp does too. Steve just completed an addition to the Lodge. They have the best camp boats on the lake, fully rigged console and tiller boats with 4 stroke motors, 2 Lowrance graphs, and electric bow mounts. One warning: this is a hard core fishing camp. If you want golf, shopping, fancy gourmet meals, go somewhere else. If you want serious fishing, hand-built log cabins, chicken, ribs, and steak cooked over a wood fire, and a wilderness experience, then check it out. They're at www.witchbaycamp.com.Brian"

We went fishing there once and had a great time even though the fish parles francais!Here is a good story about the trip to Quebec. My grandfather was a hard working man who's dream was to someday go on a fishing trip to Canada. He started taking me fishing as a brand new baby and I have the photos to prove it. From then on, we hunted and fished together for the rest of his life. All of my life, my grandfather and I have been the best friends and fishing and hunting buddies. So, as a young man, I saved up money and vacation from work and took my grandfather to Quebec for two weeks to camp and fish. He saw his first bull moose, caught many fish, boated into remote areas, and in general had a great time! In fact, we both had the best time of our lives! I knew even at that time that was the most important fishing trip of my life. Now that he is gone, it is one of my best memories. And, the idea for that trip was from my then fiance and now wife of many years. Aint that a hoot!Take care, Ohio fisherman"

525841,Ohio fisherman,2002-12-11 20:25:00,989,"Hi Guys: I am looking for a drive-in lodge for fishing in Canada for next summer. I posted this in the summer and received some helpful information, however the suggested lodges do not have a vacancy for when we can go on the week of July 4. We would like good fishing for walleyes, pike, and hopefully smallmouth. Anything else is a bonus. Numbers are important, size is secondary. We would drive from Ohio and either cross at Niagra Falls or Sault Ste. Marie. and then on from there. The drive must be something that we can do in one day or at the most, a short drive on the second day. It will be my wife and I. However, due to my wife's illness she cannot help with the driving. We will tow our own boat. We can cook or their meals are ok. We would like to find a lodge that is clean and in good condition. Elegance is not important, rustic is great, but run-down is no good.Thanks, Ohio fisherman"

Several years ago we stayed at Sonny-Bob Lodge on Oba Lake. We board the train at Hawk Junction and rode it to the lodge. You put your gear on a flat car and ride in a passenger car. The train stops at the lodge and you unload your gear. When its time to return, you flag the train down, load your gear and get in the passenger car.I think you could load a canoe (better check on it)and a substantial amount of gear and food. We didn't carry in a boat with us but did bring a 6 hp outboard.I think if you did a search on Google for Algoma Central Railway or whatever they call that region of Ontario, you will find links to lodges along the railway"
