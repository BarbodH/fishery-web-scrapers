526552,Guest,2003-01-17 17:10:00,0,I use to go to Basket Lake but have not been there in a long time. Has anyone been there in the last couple years? How has the fishing been?? And does Olga North still own it? Use to catch some nice fish there. Thanks Tim

Usually the women go up the 1st 2-3 days and then go home leaving the guys to fish out the week. Last Aug. they were staying at my cabin on Wabaskang, and had a couple real high wind days so the lake was too rough. They called over to Basket thinking they would try it for a day. She wanted $20 a head to let them launch their boat. I doubt they will go back."
