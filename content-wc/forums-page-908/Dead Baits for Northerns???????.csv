526442,lobo1,2003-01-16 18:19:00,734,"Adam,I have no idea how much they were but they had a big freezer with lots in it. The key to using these things is make sure your partner uses them too. Hard to still fish when your buddy is casting and hauling in fish after fish. I caught fish on these rigged with a quick set rig but to be honest most of my big pike came on Johnson silver minnows tipped with walleye gut or Bomber long A - firetiger.I will take some in again but not nearly as many - hard to sit still and wait.lobo"

526446,Guest,2003-01-16 20:00:00,0,"I agree. I've heard smelt are as good as it gets. The problem is that where we fish, fly-in just north of Red Lake, you can not use smelt. Adam"
526447,lobo1,2003-01-16 21:09:00,734,The chances of having a problem fishing with dead salted and/or frozen smelt has got to be sooooooo small it would be like getting hit by lightning 2x same day. Be differant if you were trying to take goldfish up there. Regardless the type of bait - On a good lake the bait slows you down ( you might get a bigger fish by the end of the week but you will have plenty of down time). lobo
526448,DLH,2003-01-17 09:57:00,1,Will be traveling north through Regina and Prince Albert to La Rounge. Anyone know where we can stop and get frozen baits????
526449,Bobby,2003-01-17 10:15:00,211,"Tullibee/Ciscos as well as huge sardines can be bought from Lake Winnipeg Shiners, Lockport, Manitoba, 204-757-2494, if you ever drive out that way (20 min north of Winnipeg) just call in advance to make sure they have them in stock. I've caught some nice pike on the sardines, they work really well on a rig below a tip-up."
526432,DLH,2003-01-13 11:17:00,1,Any thoughts on useing frozen baits for Northerns?? Is it even legal in Sask? Going 1st week of June to La Rounge. Have been using standardspoons and spinners with fair success.
526433,Peanut,2003-01-13 12:39:00,929,"Yes, in Sask you can use live (or dead) leeches and crawlers, and dead minnows - leeches must be bought from in-province, crawlers can be brought in, but not in dirt.But, LA in June - there should be no need for any sort of bait for northerns - take a few Len Thompson spoons, some rattlin raps and you're all set.My family has a cabin on the lake, so feel free to email if you have any other questions.derrek.""Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not.In either case the idea is quite staggering""- Arthur C. Clarke"
526434,stewart,2003-01-13 13:17:00,100,"Here where I live dead minnows catch all the really big pike, at least big relative to the usual size you can get. Dead bait requires your knowing that the pike are in that spot. Not exactly a search technique. If you know they're there but won't bite for sure toss in a quick striked rig bait and wait . When the line takes off pay attention to the way it's going so you can sweep the rod back in the best direction to get a corner of the jaw set. Big pike are lazy."
526435,bigfish1965,2003-01-13 19:55:00,3210,"During the winter, many small fish perish and are frozen into the ice. When spring comes pike cruise shallow bays looking for the recently thawed free dinners. Dead suckers work great right after ice-out."
526436,IaCraig,2003-01-13 20:38:00,434,"One of the best baits I've ever used was frozen smelt. They seem to be just oily enough to attract pike, however I do not know if they are legal in Sask.IaCraig"
526437,Guest,2003-01-14 12:31:00,0,"I can't speak for Sask, but we fly out of Red Lake to a lodge. We can't bring smelt in. It is not a native species. We've always taken salted suckers. This year we were thinking of taking some large shiners. I believe they are legal. Will have to check. Last year a group of guys, who go up every year, took frozen ciscoes. I'm not sure where they get them, but they had a lot of success. The lodge we go to put out a news letter the last couple of years with pictures and what people used and where they caught their big pike. From ice out (May 1st - May 15th) to the 15th of June the most used bait for BIG pike was a dead bait. The best time being right after ice out and slowly becoming less effective as the season went on. There were alot of other lures that worked, but the dead baits seemed to work the best.Adam"
526438,jimbo,2003-01-14 19:12:00,223,I would sure like to know where they get the Ciscos? Any info appreciatedThanks
526439,lobo1,2003-01-15 17:50:00,734,We picked up frozen ciscos at a local bait shop in one of those little towns on the way to Red Lake. Don't recall for sure the name of the town but it was in the last leg of the journey. Almost positive it was in Ear Falls.lobo
526440,Guest,2003-01-16 09:08:00,0,"Get your hands on some tullibee, pike absolultely love 'em. My second choice is small goldeye and last but not least smelt.Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"
526441,Guest,2003-01-16 14:00:00,0,"I must not be a very smart fisherman because I have no idea what a tullibee is. Can you give me some insight?Lobo. Can you tell me if they had plenty in stock and how much were they? We've always brought up our own salted minnows, but if I could buy something on the way up it would be less hassle for me. Any info would be helpful.Thanks in advanceAdam"
