526519,Rich B,2003-01-15 19:38:00,1081,"I've fished Tunnel lake a few times the last three years; and although it has a camp ground and private cottages/homes; and Camp Kuha located on it, the fishing pressure isn't any worse than I've seen on other Ontario waters. It is a long narrow lake (it is a river that is dammed up), and during the week you'll see boats from Camp Kuha and some locals.We have had good fishing for most every trip up, and it is a beautifularea of Ontario. If you're interested in more information, youcan email me. As far as the Mississagi River, I can't speak for thepressure on it."
526522,Guest,2003-01-16 09:39:00,0,"""the odd one eh"" pretty much sums up what you will catch there as a local once replied to me as I asked him how he was doing. I fished that lake and river with my family in the 80's and that is what we caught. Finally decided to explore northwestern Ontario, and i'm glad I did. The Mississagi Valley area is very scenic, especially in the fall, but the fishing, it's been hit hard for years, the area needs extreme restrictions, and it doesn't help that the water levels go up and down on Tunnel because of the dam. It has been a while since I've fished there, it might be slowly coming back, but Ontario is a big province with plenty of sure bets when it comes to fishing. Basicly I wouldn't waste my vacation fishing on this system."

526523,lenray,2003-01-17 11:02:00,467,I started out on that lake but that isn't Canadian fishing that is just into Ontario you need to go where others haven't gone if you really want to fish and not fly in drive to the end of the road meaning the town of Pickle Lake and then go into those bush lakes. If ytou just want to see water this lake Tunnel is ok but not for fishinglen
