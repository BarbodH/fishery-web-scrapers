526515,Guest,2003-01-18 11:23:00,0,Nothing beats a 32oz Bloody Mary to get my day going...toss in a couple of celery sticks and...voila...breakfast.
526516,Vitreum,2003-01-18 16:14:00,221,strong black coffee. breakfast of champions.
526517,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-01-18 18:06:00,618,"Med. rare delmonico, a few over easy eggs, quick fried potatoes, toast and juice. Boil the potatoes the night before so they can be fried quickly. Go with a thinner cut steak (I like mine thick, but time...). Give every one a cooking job and you will have a hearty breakfast on the table in less than 10 min. that will last you til dinner. Or if you just want to hold out a few hours, peanut butter will stay with you for a while. Rich"
526502,Guest,2003-01-15 18:04:00,0,"Can any of you share your pre-dawn quick breakfast tips that you throw down before heading to the dock at 5:00 AM...you know something that carries you until you get back around 9-10 AM. Toast and Pop Tarts just don't cut it anymore. Our morning starts pretty early...by 4:15 AM or so...we typically shake off some beer rust, gather our gear and run out the door to the dock by 4:40 AM, only to have your stomach yelling at us by 7:00 AM. Tips for something quick and easy that can carry us over until we take the time to prepare a full breakfast upon our return off the lake. As you can see, we're not too keen on getting up earlier than 4:00 AM....Thanks."
526503,Guest,2003-01-15 19:43:00,0,Why not eat a big breakfast when you get back at 9am and take along an apple for when you are in the boat? I don't think you'll starve to death if you don't eat from 5am until 9am anyhow.
526504,Karl,2003-01-15 20:48:00,63,"From experience I can tell you that the good walleye bite (in late June/early July) is between 7:00-9:30AM, so there's no reason to get out there any earlier. Enjoy your breakfast, then fish. A large thermos of coffee in the boat will get to thru til lunch."
526505,lobo1,2003-01-16 02:16:00,734,"T-bone,Personally I'm with Karl but for the other (very few in our group) fellas they can generally grab some fruit and/or leftover dinner to get em by till breakfast; this is of coarse ""IF"" there is an ""official"" breakfast. Many times ours consists of cowboy coffee and COLD leftover fillets. Most days we're on the water by 0700 and don't get back until after 2200 HRS - we take stuff for lunch. Snacks and granola bars would be left up to the individual (all discussed in advance). If your guys can't make it until lunch I would suggest (a) leaving them home (just joking ----- kind of) or (b) devising a plan where the breakfast people (group I) stayed in in the morning and ate while they got the dinner stuff ready and then the dinner group ""b"" would do the same while group ""I"" had the nite bite. Of coarse the first big fish ruins all of this and you are back to fishing instead of eating - darn.ON the rare occassion we have breakfast it is usually scambled eggs and smokey links - anyone can make this in under 6 minutes with a high fire. Eat three meals a day when you are home - fish all you can while you are up there. How many other places can you be and catch hundreds of fish a day !?!?!!?!?!?!?!? a good day around here is 20 or 30 fish an that includes carp ! Take your breakfast meal onto the water and eat it for shore lunch ten miles from home - atleast it makes it exciting when you forget the salt or the forks and your hands smell of fish !lobo1"
526506,chrism,2003-01-16 07:07:00,429,"Try some instant oats (add hot water and stir), and fruit - another quicky that I have used is just taking fruit and a meal replacement bar (Gatorade brand for example) in the boat with you.Don't forget the coffee!Better yet, come up here and fish with me - the bite is usually 10am- 2pm - you get to sleep in every day!"
526507,retire55,2003-01-16 07:41:00,1029,"Hey T-Bone:Our routine won't satisfy as it resembles the routine you want to change. We're up at 0430 and leisurely work through juice and then toast (with assorted spreads) and coffee. Our objective is to be on the water by 0530. Contrary to what others have reported, we have traditionally experienced the walleye bite from 0545 until 0900 and from 1830 until 2200 where we fish. Consequently, everyone knows that breakfast is at 0930 and dinner is at 1730. If you're not there, you missed that meal with the rest of the group. The guys usually devote their time between 1000 and 1730 to trout fishing, exploring, beer tasting, telling fish stories, sleeping or personal hygene (sometimes by request). Jay"
526508,Walleye Wizard,2003-01-16 08:27:00,9,"T BONE, We start our morning out at about 4:00 AM. We usally have a small Turkey (12 to 15 lbs) with all the trimmings. Couple of the guys like Oyster Dressing so I make a big pot of thst too. After all the boys hit the shack with the half moon on the door they gather around the table again for dessert. Couple of Cherry Pies maybe a Mince Meat and our favorite Coconut Creme. Plus we make Whipped Creme topping out of Moose Milk and its always a favorite. This breakfast puts us on the Lake around 6:00 AM with a couple of Turkey Sandwichs and a cooler full of our favorite beverage. Now dont get me wrong we dont do this every morning....sometimes we have Pot Roast with the fixins."
