526565,ggg,2003-01-18 16:59:00,115,"I have fished Maynard Lake the last 2 years. Great fishing ! I stayed at Maynard Lake Lodge, but I went passed the outpost cabin every day that I was there. It looked very nice. If you can't get the outpost, Maynard Lake Lodge is a 1st. class operation that will spoil you !Good fishing. ---- greg"
