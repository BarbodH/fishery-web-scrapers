In the past you have always talked about Way North Lodge and your experiences. I did notice that you were planning on going to Sportsman's Lodge this last summer. I was wondering how you did and what you thought of the camp. A group of six of us went 2 years ago during the 1st week of June and did very well. It was Kevin's 1st year at the camp. He guided us for a day and it was well worth it. He made some great improvements to the place and I'm sure it will get better. 2 yrs. ago was the last year you could keep fish over 36"". I guess that changed this last year which is good to hear.Thanks in advanceAdamP.S. We are booked for may 17th - 24th. Hopefully the ice will be out this year. Sounded like it wasn't last year."

I would pre-book him everyday if you can. Good luck and let me know how you do this year and tell kevin i said hello. I think he had his second kid recently. I need to call him."
