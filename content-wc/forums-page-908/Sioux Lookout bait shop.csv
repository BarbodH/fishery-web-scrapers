526680,IaDave,2003-01-19 12:46:00,476,I thought I read that Ojibway Baits closed. Is that true? If so is there anywhere else to buy bait in Sioux Lookout?
526681,Karl,2003-01-19 15:09:00,63,Fred & Dee's gas/convenience store (5mi s. of Sioux Lookout on Hwy 72) where road to Hudson begins. I might also mention that prices are almost half of what Ojibway Bait used to charge. And they also have THE BEST selection of Cuban cigars in nw ontario.

We are trying something different this spring,we are staying at the Forest Inn and trying different lakes, Lac Seul etc. Any advice on SE part of Lac Seul."
