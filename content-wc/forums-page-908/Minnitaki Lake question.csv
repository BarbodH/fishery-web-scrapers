526363,Dennis,2003-01-11 08:16:00,14,In the past few months I've seen some references to the Minnicau Creek area on Minnitaki. Where is this located? We've been going to Minnitaki for many years and are very familiar with the lake but have never heard of Minnicau Creek. Perhaps we know it by another name. Any help would be appreciated.
526364,fishnut,2003-01-17 15:47:00,46,Minnikau creek is on the east side of the lake. If you come in from Abramns lake thru the chutes and head south to the English Rive its maybe half way on your left. If you e-mail me I can send you a map.It can be very good in the spring. I caught over 100 WE there on a recent trip but timming is everything there. Other times nothing.e-mail: [email protected]
526365,Karl,2003-01-17 19:29:00,63,You probably haven't heard about it because it's only great in early spring and because it's a LONG boat ride no matter where you're staying. It's at the far east end of East Bay.It's 99.9% local or guided boats going there.
