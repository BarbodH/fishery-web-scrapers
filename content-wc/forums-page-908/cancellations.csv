We heard from ours and they've had a few this year. Blaming it on the state of the economy. The camp has been 100% booked the last few years and don't even go to shows anymore. We found them a group for June, but they still have a big opening in September. Didn't give it much thought, but trips like these are a ""luxury"" and the first thing to go. Funny thing is we've been going so long I look at it as a necessity! Can't wait for spring."
