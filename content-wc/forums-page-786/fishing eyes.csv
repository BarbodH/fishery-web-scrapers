540418,Guest,2004-06-08 06:01:00,0,"Hello Jack: I haunt this site on a regular basis....it is definitely addictive and one of the best sources of fishing info available. I have not been up to Canada as yet this year. We have a ""Father and Son "" trip coming up soon in mid-July when we're heading way up to the Gouin Reservoir for a week. Then we have our regular Family Vacation at Gull Lake in the first week in August. I'll report on both trips when I return. Hope your week at Gull is a good one....on second thought.....how could it NOT be a great time????? Good luck chasing the 'eyes!"
540461,Guest,2004-06-09 06:25:00,0,"Hi Baxter, Its good to hear your response. I've caught a few eyes around the Saratoga area so far this year. Enough for a couple of fish frys. My 8 yr old Grandson says he's gonna crush me on the wallys in Canada this yr. Can't wait.I'll do the same for you after our vacation. I'm takin my wife out on Sacandaga Res with a guide on June 21 to warm her up for Big Gull.She loves to eat the eyes.Later Jack"
542081,Guest,2004-07-27 05:45:00,0,"Hi Baxter, I just wanted to let you know a little about our week at Camp's Bay.The weather was changing constantly from fall weather one day to summer weather the next. Out of the whole week, Jul 3-10, there was only two days it didn't rain but it seemed like it was one weather front after another. The wally fishing was a disapointment but all in all no probs except a plugged toilet for a while in cottage 6.We only caught 5 eyes the whole week & my wife caught 2 of them. She got a 18 1/2 inch eye out in the big bay around dusk one night & she loved it.There was a lot of boats out in the big bay at night around dark in 60-70 ft but I never saw or heard of anybody really doing good. I just think the bite was off that week. All reports from other fisherman said that the fishing had been slow up there for a couple weeks previous. I tryed everyting in the cranks I had & worm harness.One meal was all I could do. I didn't jig much but I know sometimes a different method will turn them on. Their so #### finicky sometimes.We had a fun week all in all. I hope the best for you & your family on your vacation & please let me know how your fishing results are.Grandpa Jack"
542093,Guest,2004-07-27 08:19:00,0,"Jack: Thanks for the report. We're heading to Gull this weekend for week #2 of summer vacation walleye fishin. Check out my Gouin Report....what a great time! I'm burning all of my vacation for the year for these two weeks with my family, walleye fishin, and can't think of a better way to spend my time off. Isn't it sad that we highly evolved humans can't figure out a better system than to work all year in return for just two darn weeks of Free Time?? I'd trade some wage $$$ for time off in a heartbeat if my employer would allow it."
543508,Guest,2004-09-29 06:20:00,0,"Hi Baxter, How did your vacation go at Camp's Bay in Aug.Did any wally's get on the dinner plate. I hope you had a good vac. we're still doing pretty good on the Sacandaga. we caught 12 Sunday but 9 were shorts. My boat is taking in water in the back so I've gotta find out where & why.Its back to the hole in the water you throw money in to.Later Jack"
543510,Guest,2004-09-29 09:18:00,0,"Jack: We had a great week as usual at Camps Bay, good hot weather for 3 days, cooler for the other 3 days. Plenty of BBQs and good times with all the folks there. The walleye fishing was fair. We managed to catch enough fish for 1 big fish fry, most of the walleye were taken on the early night troll over deep water out near the Sister Islands and Gull Rock with assorted crankbaits.....Rapallas and Reef Runners (Lil Rippers) did about equal. The best part of the week was that my kids caught the bigger walleye, while I chipped in with smaller fish. Nothing huge, my daughter got the biggest one, around 3 1/2-4 #s. Gave her a good tussle, just after dark. We caught and released quite a few little fellows, hopefully that bodes well for the coming years."
