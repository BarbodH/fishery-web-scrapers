543468,Backwater Eddy,2004-09-26 07:34:00,3871,"I spent most of my week chasing big Kitty's and the testing of the Greenback bite was peripheral on this trip. I can't say I tried too hard for Greenbacks on this trip up. Cats were good for us, 20-30 nice fish per day with some real sumo class cats (#25 plus and 38""-39""). I caught a few Greenbacks this week on the Red near the Miracle Mile (7-9') on chartreuse stand-up jigs....mostly dead sticking. I fished the early to mid AM hours. Lots of sauger, just a few 21"" - 23"" Greenback walleye. A couple of boats did well on Greenbacks in the mid-week with both numbers and size, that I did witness. If you were 20' off the mark, zip-nada...nothing going. A spot on the spot bite. I tried glow green stand-up and Rattle-jigs and sparked them up with a camera flash, but the fish were not into the glow on this trip...not for me anyhow. Chartreuse and hot neon jig colors in stand-up jigs were best for me. I had some fair luck with a nifty floating jig made by Phelps Tackle, called the Sponge Bug. I rigged it up as a short Drop Shot rig and dead-sticked the rod or beat the weights slowly on the bottom. The Spongy Bug has a interesting design that incorporates a weed guard that also acts to hold the salted shiners on the barbless hook well. The Spongy Bug floating jig is wedged shaped and at rest in the flow it does a lazy flop from side to side, kinda like a stalled out Colorado spinner. The strikes I got on it were a bit more aggressive and I managed to hook up most that hit on it. With the flow kinda swift over the flats and the water stirred up from the rains I found most of the fish glued tightly to the bottom, and shallow. For me behind or just of the tip of 7 foot humps was the best, even shallower humps at times. If the water clears a bit, it could get good fast? I think they are there, and more walleye then many think are hiding there. It's just a bit muddy yet for them to really turn on maybe? I would be interested to hear how the tournament went this weekend? Thanks, Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
543481,Guest,2004-09-27 10:08:00,0,"Was out at Pine Falls for the better part of the day on Saturday. At the mouth lots of boats jigging - very heavy current. Saw a good number of greenbacks in the morning - our boat only landed two - one of which was my first Master - 28.5"" Other fish was about 1.5 lbs. Lots of moving around with all boats - alot of people fishing in unconventional spots - really searching hard. After morning bite not a heck of a lot going on."

543561,Guest,2004-10-01 13:02:00,0,"This week we are seeing more local anglers and working guides doing better here for greenbacks on the Red River. We have seen more greenbacks over 28"" and up to 33"" in the past few days then I have seen in two years. Jigging appears to be the most common method producing bigger fish. I think it is looking up, and the wind is hard from the North. Are you heading North this week again?"

543388,Guest,2004-09-19 21:29:00,0,"Was out at pine falls today sept. 19. Caught around 30 walleye in shallow water by the church drift jigging and anchoring.All were river walleye except 3 greenbacks, not a fish hit the 2 lb. mark. To are american friends planning a trip up here, to be on the safe side I would suggest waiting two or three weeks before making your trek. Not to say that the walleyes won't be making there runs before that but, better to be safe than sorry. note: conditions look good for great fall runs, water levels are high, lots of current, huge shiner runs this year. I'll post my next excursion which is next week.P.S. i'm from winnipeg."

And a fine athlete you are Ed, should have kept you smaller boat and you wouldn't need the drift sock. You guys are lucky, I moved this year to Yellowknife and although I have no complaints about the fishing here, it seems Walleye are not the common fish, I will probally be storing my boat in about 2 weeks due to the temps. Won't be going fishing in Nov this year. I really miss fishing in Pine Falls and on the Red and look forward to getting back to Winnipeg some day. Mike W"
543430,Guest,2004-09-23 12:03:00,0,"Here's the straight goods from a local who's out almost daily as far as the Wpg. River and Traverse Bay. I can confirm everything said above as accurate. The bay continues to suck as far as trolling goes. Lots of fish in the 1 to 2 lb range along with the odd nice one being caught along the old river channel which runs past the first little island on the east side. Mark em park em ""anchor"" or drift, shiners or live bait"" both are working. Am doing well in the rapids, know where most of the rocks are ""hit most of them twice"" We are averaging 30 to 40 fish a day 1 to 3lb range with the odd nice one being caught ""same as on the bay as far as presentation"". The flow is very strong with levels back to normal or slightly above. The gates are open again and an average of about 8 out of 12 turbines operating daily as far as i can see."

543438,gms,2004-09-23 18:49:00,91,"Captain Wylie... Any idea why the town of Powerview or Pine Falls would not invest in adding some more boat launch facilities and possibly a fish cleaning shack. I myself would be more than will to pay a launch fee if it would help relieve some of the morning launch congestion when things get hopping. Although only 25 or so boats out there last weekend....saw a couple who obviously do not understand the simple message on the ""By order of Chevy"" boat launch sign. Will have to talk to him and see if he can get a bigger one made....maybe with some graphics for those hard of reading. gms"
543439,Guest,2004-09-23 20:43:00,0,"I was out there this weekend as well, and I would agree a larger ramp is needed, but bak to the main point. I was out there this weekend and not much to brag about, except one greenback that went about 6 lbs, and about 12 small ones, how'd everyone else do, any good fish starting to show up yet. This is only the 3rd greenback I've caught this year over 5 lbs."
543440,Guest,2004-09-24 06:21:00,0,"No but i know Sip and he's caught a few of the nice ones i mentioned. This is Leon over at Blue Waters Inn & Guide Service and no i'm not looking to fill my place up, full up till the 21st of Oct with my regulars alltough i do have a few guiding dates to fill i never have a problem. As far as the launch facilities are concerned nothing will be done to improve it because the two towns are in the midst of an annexation and the paper company may stop access in the next couple of years if the sawmill and other capitol projects go thru. So until all the land issues are settled this is what we have and by the way all you fellas that were using the smaller launch at the pumphouse above the rapids that one is gone , there is now a lift station , pumphouse where the launch was so don't even bother turning in. Fortunately my boats always in the water and i'm sure glad i don't have to do the parking lot polka. Regards and best of luck to all...L"

543465,gms,2004-09-25 19:38:00,91,"Two of us jigged ""Two Hearts"" on Traverse Bay today and managed to put 8 very small walleyes (17"" or less) in the boat. I would say that we were doing a lot better than the boats around us....did not see many nets come out in this area....there was a ""wall"" of boats at Bruyere's Point and I did see a couple of nice stringer dragging behind. Nothing over 17"" today for us. Winds were WSW. Caught on both salted and live in 12-14 foot range using silver fireball jigs. South wind started to whip up good around noon....had fun getting from the lake back into the mouth...some good waves in there. If any one knows the clowns who keep parking their trailers in the ""turn around"" spot at the mill launch do take an opportunity to educate them. Not sure what kind of person would show up at the boat launch, see trailers parked all the way up the hill and think that it is their lucky day...no one parked in the first couple of spaces! My apologies if the are handicapped, but there was no tag in the mirror stating so."

Heres one for you, I just moved to Yellowknife and have seen a few wierd things since I got here, but the other day took the cake, I was coming into the dock to load and this other guy had just put his boat on the trailer, he pulls the boat out of the water stops on the ramp and starts to get his boat ready for travel, and I'm not talking about the straps only, this guy climbs in his boat starts to put rods away, take the top down, unhook his electronics, right on the ramp! I didn't say anything as he had about 100lbs on me, only in Yellowknife you say!"
543343,Guest,2004-09-15 22:52:00,0,"OK guys, I've been really excited for this year. All I heard the last month is the river is high and its been really cold. So doesn't this mean the greenbacks should really be bite'n right about now,or really starting. So far I havn't heard much from either Traverse or the red. When the red/travense have been good in the past, the bite has been pritty good at this time. I plan on going in a couple of weeks and would like to know the report up there. What is you best bet, Traverse bay or the red? Please any reports of anykind would be nice"
543347,mrwalleye5,2004-09-16 06:42:00,1922,"I live one hour away from the Red. I'm planning on going on Sat or Sun. Going equiped for both cat and walleye. There hasn't been all that much talk of any big migration of green backs yet. Some talk, but with the amount of people fishing the Red I would have thought that there would have been more hype if there were more instances of fish being caught. I'm planning on going to Pine Falls( Traverse Bay) by the end of Sept. This is 3 weeks earlier then I usually go. The way the weather is looking I think if I leave it any later I might be pushing ice. Maybe I'm just paranoid about the weather we have had this year but it really sucks and I think this could happen. W5"
543355,Guest,2004-09-16 13:22:00,0,"We have'nt seen all the grandios predictions from the same fellers as the past few seasons, why is that?"
543363,mrwalleye5,2004-09-16 18:55:00,1922,"Last year for instance there was continuing predictions that the greenback run was coming. I quess it did come but not in the numbers that we are used to. It's not as simple to nail big fish after big fish by simply throwing a hook over the side. I found that you have to work for the fish. I wasn't fortunate enough to be in the area when the big runs were on but I have been able to squeek out some good fish but it has taken some long hours and cold fingers. Last year for example, went up for two days. First day eight fish 21' to 26'. Second day caught a 28"" and that was it. Hot and cold but I still look forward to going back. Just never know when you will really get into a bite. W5"
543375,Guest,2004-09-17 21:07:00,0,Where were you fishing? Red or Winnipeg. What areas work on the water work best for you? Trolling or jigg'n.
543376,mrwalleye5,2004-09-17 21:21:00,1922,I was refering to Wpg River and Traverse Bay. Jigs seem to work in the river but once you get out in the bay I seem to head towards an area which I believe is called Johnstone Island. It's just a glorified rock pile in a north westerly direction once you get out of the river and get to the mouth of the bay. I generally troll cranks in about 8 to 14 feet of water with the best success coming in the ten foot range. Last year we were just about on the rocks on that rock pile and were catching descent fish with jigs and salties. I've been tempted to try spinner rigs but generally in the last two years my fingers have been so cold I couldn't have rigged it up. I can't see why the fish wouldn't go after a spinner with some live bait verses an artificial bait. W5
543379,gms,2004-09-19 11:48:00,91,"Saturday - September 18th. Only picked up one walleye crankbaiting today and 2 jigging out in Traverse Bay. Partner jigged 4 small ones (1lb or less). Only one ""nice sized one"" and that was just 21 inches (he's back in the lake....only like to eat the smaller ones). More Silver Bass (& a Smallmouth) than walleye. Has to be just around the corner....but I don't want to be guilty for starting that rumor, I've seen how the last couple of years have panned out and feel for my American friends that drive a heck of a long way to catch only a couple of fish....especially when it is cold and miserable. Nets are out in full force....saw one that I would estimate is about half a football field long! Talked to some others at the launch and they too had a very slow day. Only about 25 boat trailers at the launch...I usually use that as a good temperature guage on how the fishing has been of late. Good luck gms"
543380,gms,2004-09-19 11:54:00,91,"I believe the island you are refering to is called Robinson's Rock GPS coordinates for this ""pile"" is 50'38.844N and 096' 21.846W if we are talking about the same one. Jigged and trolled around there yesterday....picked up 2 walleye. One small one on a white shad rap and a 21"" on a silver/chrome jig. gms"
543382,Guest,2004-09-19 14:26:00,0,Thanks for the heads up.You will be rewarded for honesty!
543383,Guest,2004-09-19 15:10:00,0,"I spent the day (Sat 18 Sep 04) on Traverse Bay and in the Winnipeg River. Picked up 4 walleye drifting across the flats (8-14 ft) with 1/4 ounce jig and minnow between the river mouth and Robinson's Rock. Wind was from the South. Used a driftsock to slow the pro V 1800 tiller so the jig could find the bottom. Picked up another 3 trolling white shad raps and clown coloured Wally Divers. All were the bright classic greenback colouration but the size was disappoinitng. Largest was 20 inches. I believe they were all males because they were quite thin for their length. Had a friend who was having no luck jigging or trolling so he went upriver to the Dam. Outflow is extremely high and fishing sucked there as well. He reloaded his boat and went to MacArthur Falls where he had more bad luck. Not a great walleye weekend. It was nice to have a 20 degree Celius day on Traverse bay. Just wish the fishing was as good as the weather. It'll get a lot worse before I put the boat away for the winter. ""If fishing is a sport, I'm an athlete!!"""
