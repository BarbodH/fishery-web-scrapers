We had mixed weather, winds from every direction, lots of rain and little sun, warm and cool temps. We were lucky. Had no cold temps. Was very apprehensive before we arrived, not having fished this part of LOTW before. In retrospect, I don't think there is any place on LOTW that you can't find fish. We had numbers but no size. We found early morning walleyes in the narrows to Turtle Lake. They were there all week. Found the crappie hole on the south side of Hay Island. (Huge crappies) We found great numbers of northerns in the shallow south part of Stevens Bay. Most were mid 20's to upper 20's. Did have 2 follows that were over 40 but they weren't at all interested in anything but where the lure was going. We did pick up two muskies (35 and 31) in the narrows between Comegan Island and Miles Island near the entrance to Miles Bay. Found a walleye hot spot on the southwest corner of Black Island. At least it was hot on the day we were there. My wife and I had around 40 walleyes draging a Lindy No Snag sinker and a spinner. Biggest was maybe 17 inches but it was great fun. Just about any place we stopped we picked up at leaset one walleye. Unfortunately, the biggest walleye all week was 20 inches. Fished the south side of Rabbit Point and picked up a few walleys and 2 small smallmouth. Had planned to fish some of the islands south of Hay Island. ""So many Islands and so little time"". Wanted to get up into Obabikon Lake for crappies but never made it. A group from the resort went up the second day we were there. They fished the ""Elbow"" for about 2 hrs. and came back with limits of slab crappie. All in all, considering the rain and consecutive weather fronts, we really did do great for numbers. Duck Bay Lodge turned out to be one of the best parts of the trip. The food was great. Accomodations were great, service was great and the people were great. A special thanks to Slayer (Ed) for recommending Duck Bay Lodge. On another note, the mechanical portage between Sabaskong and Whitefish is being replaced this month. I was told it will be like one that was there at one time, a roller system. Marv"

543614,Slayer,2004-10-03 12:46:00,41,"Glad you enjoyed the trip. I always like getting up there. I don't get up much in the fall. What depths were you getting the Walleye in. I know there is a 40ft hole just in front of the Turtle Lake channel, is that were you fished? ""Slayer"""
543616,Ia Walihntr,2004-10-03 15:32:00,320,"Slayer, We fished the backend of the channel as it opens into Turtle Lake. Walleyes were in 20 to 25 feet. As you went shallower you got more perch and Rock Bass. Every time we were in the narrows, a few boats would pull up and fish just outside the entrance. I never tried there cause all the Duck Bay guides were fishing where I was. (Guess I should say I was fishing where they were) Every walleye we caught out of 20 plus water was small. We found the bigger fish on shallow weedlines. (6 to 10 feet) You had to troll about a boat width or more from the edge. Shallow weedlines were the location of the 2 muskies also and we were actualy trolling for walleyes. Guides were casting every little shoreline bay with reeds and sand in the back end. They were picking up larger northern but thier numbers weren't there. We drifted large weedy shallow bays. 12 feet and in, until the weeds became to thick, (around 6 feet deep) casting big spinner baits or daredevles, if the weeds were sparse enough. It was a real hoot. If you want more info, just ask. Marv"
