I have been using power bait for several years and Gulp last year with the same results. No need for live bait on fly-ins (usually). Would you go back to Ogoki?"
543666,Guest,2004-10-06 13:22:00,0,"Was there a few years ago, got sick of jig fishing real fast, our group went to floating rapalas and did very well. Any shallow running bright collored lure worked well and didn't get snagged all the time. Fun lake I'd like to back some day."
543673,jigman 2003,2004-10-07 06:17:00,981,"Thanks for the reply Smokrcraft. I am gathering that the walleyes in this lake relate to wood? Sounds a lot like fishing reservoirs in Wisconsin. I make my own weedless jigs, so I am anxious to try them out. Any other info./opinions that people could give me would be appreciated."
543506,jigman 2003,2004-09-29 05:59:00,981,"I am looking for some updated info. on the Ogoki. I did a search and read the threads that came up, but I would like to hear from someone who fished there this year using Mattice Lake Outfitters. I have used MLO for 5 years now, and they are by far the best outfitter I have ever seen. I know the fishing will be good, but I am curious about the wood. Is it really as difficult to fish as some of the previous threads have stated? My group is an experienced bunch of fishermen, so I can't believe that it will be that difficult to figure out. If someone could offer tips, spots, colors, weights of jigs, etc. I would be greatful."
543520,Guest,2004-09-29 13:05:00,0,"Fished the Reservoir last summer (first week in JUly). Bunch of amatuer fisherman that just enjoy catching fish. Found three patterns that worked at different times of day. 1/4 oz. & 3/8 oz jig heads, any flavor chartruse, tipped with chartruse twister tails and a piece of night crawler as ""meat'. This approach worked best when the fish were hugging the bottom. Yeah, we lost a lot of jigs, but we came prepared. Second, typical Lake Erie spinner harness, floating style, tipped with nightcrawler. This technique we used on a drift during mid-day when the wind was picking up. Any point jutting off the shore or an island produced results here. Trolling cranks. Near the end of the week we were beginning to run out of tackle, so we dug into the bass crank baits - and trolled them! Mostly during the calm, evening hours, and yeah we hung our fair share. The largest northern we caught (43"") came on an old Big O in the chrome/black back finish. We did our part in contributing to the clutter of old lures on the bottom of the Reservoir, but it was definitely worth it. I'll know how many to take next time, and next time will definitely be next summer! The Elliot's operation and facilities are exactly what we were looking for. Now, if I could just get 'em to move it closer to Indiana."

543535,jigman 2003,2004-09-30 06:07:00,981,"Stauff, thanks for the info. Yes, I have never seen an outfitter like the Elliots. Friendly, accomodating, on time, quality cabins, excellent fishing, etc. So approximately how many jigs per person did you go through? 75-100 or more? I make my own, so cost isn't an issue. I just want to go prepared."
543539,Stauff,2004-09-30 12:35:00,110,"I probably had forty or so jigs that I took for both myself and my son. By the middle of the week I swore I'd bring at least 100 on the next trip. Better too many, than to be out of jigs with two or three days remaining on the trip."

543648,Guest,2004-10-04 23:15:00,0,"We were there the end of july and start of sept but with a different out-fitter. the fishing was very good for walleyes 18 to 22 inches. pike fishing was also good. the largest was 43in. We all used 1/4 ounce jigs with berkly power baits and gulp. we used no live bait at all. Between 6 of us we went thru 306 jigs. And that was only because we spent half our time trolling with cranks, which also worked well. Chartruce was the best color over-all but orange or glow woked well at times. You might want to try fireline for jigging. I was able to sling shot off many snags using it so I lost by far the least jigs. We never had the need for any live bait, the power bait and gulp worked very well. thats all we have used for 3 years up there."
