So when Canadian guy's lie to woman about length, do you lie in inches? or CM's? So in canada if a man is talking in the woods and no woman is around, is he still wrong? Cuz thats the way it works at my house in the states."

543517,Guest,2004-09-29 12:00:00,0,A canadian gallon is roughly 4.5 liters and a US gallon is 3.8 liters.
543526,2 DOGS,2004-09-29 15:32:00,361,"No matter how you measure it, it's gonna be expensive compared to what we once knew."
543528,retire55,2004-09-29 16:40:00,1029,"In case you prefer to compare a Canadian gallon to a US gallon, a Canadian gallon equals 1.2 (1.2009) US gallons. Using litres, we have to use 4 places after the decimal to get the identical 1.2 relationship (i.e. 4.5461/3.7854 = 1.2009)"
543532,Guest,2004-09-29 23:48:00,0,Hi. reading this got me thinking. If gasoline is in canadian measure why is it when you buy a gallon of milk its the same size as here in the U S of A? tell me about it .
543533,Guest,2004-09-30 05:22:00,0,You cannot buy a gallon of milk in Canada. Our milk is sold in litres.
543537,retire55,2004-09-30 08:27:00,1029,"I too am unaware of any place in Canada where you can buy a ""gallon"" container of milk. Further, I'm unaware of whether one can even purchase a 4 litre container of milk any where in Canada. However, paint is typically sold in Canada in 4 litre containers (cans). Even though these 4 litre cans replaced the imperial gallon cans, many older Canadians still refer to buying their paint by the gallon (in reality 4 litre cans). On a size comparison, since the US gallon equates to 3.7854 litres, a US gallon of paint container would look very similar in size to a 4 litre container of paint."
