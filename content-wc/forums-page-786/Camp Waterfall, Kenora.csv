543259,Guest,2004-09-10 18:44:00,0,Anybody ever been to Camp Waterfall near Kenora. Appears to be a nice relaxing place to take the wife. I was wondering what the fishing is like on the Rushing River/Blind Lake ?
543301,Guest,2004-09-14 15:13:00,0,"Great place, cheap prices and good fishing, was up there several years ago in june for eyes. Blindfold had some of the biggest crappies that I have ever seen, and lots of them, norhterns plenty. We portaged into LOW for eyes on the lift. It was a great time, we went the first week of june. Good luck Troyz"

543309,Guest,2004-09-15 04:51:00,0,Is there a website for camp waterfall for resorts?
543311,Guest,2004-09-15 08:15:00,0,"I believe their are eyes in blindfold, but we fished LOW for eyes. I do not know how to lac suel, it just over an hour to vermillion bay. I do not know if the have a website? I went with a group of guy that have been going there for years, it was a blast. Good fishing Troyz"

Access to Lake of the Woods enables you to transfer to the bigger waters for a change of pace. If I'm reading this right, must be walleye in Blindfold Lake. Marv"
