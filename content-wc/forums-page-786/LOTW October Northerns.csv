Usually we concentrate on walleyes, crappie, and ducks if they are in. This year I have a partner going that is stoked about the Idea of getting into northerns. Do any of you possible have any ideas of how we could concentrate on trying to catch a big northers in the middle of october on lotw. Possibly areas, tackle, presentations? Any help would be greatly appriciated. Since I am not a big northern fisherman I really have no idea how to put him on a good day of northern fishing. If there are weed beds in the shallows that you cast, if it is all long line trolling, if they are in deeper water, ect. Thanks to anyone that has any advise. And hope you all have a great fall, this is the time of year we all live for, Have fun."

The fish just never really went deep like they usually do during July and August. If I were you, I would search out any remaining weeds, especially those around points and other significant shoreline structure. If those are in short supply, then look for rocky points and other shallow rock structure. When I was up in early September, spinners - both in-line and tandem blade - were quite successful. I'd also suggest that using muskie-sized offerings, including surface baits in that shallow water, will also stand a good chance of provoking a northern blow-up. Have fun and good luck. Lunker"

Most guys fishing muskies have been pulling in northerns in the high 30's all season long. I've seen pictures of more than a half a dozen (at least) over the 40 inch mark. The biggest was 45"". Most of them were released so they'll still be swimming around. For the most part, all the people catching the big northerns were throwing muskie tackle. Bucktails in the summer, jerks the last month or so. One of the most experienced fisherman I've had the pleasure of chatting with off and on all summer said that every rocky point has a northern (and probably a big one) on it. Advice about the weeds is good. As is the muskie tackle. If you throw spinner baits, make them a little bigger than you might normally think of using. Enjoy. Hope you don't freeze out in the tent in October!"
543476,Guest,2004-09-26 22:05:00,0,"Homme, I don't know if we should admire you or have you committed...ten days on an island on LOTW in Oct. should provide some good stories. I'll look forward to your report when you return. Have you picked your island yet? For northerns try trolling big black bucktails with silver blades around Horseshoe and Garden Islands in Miles Bay. If you see a guy in a camp boat with a white dog stop over and say hello. Good luck."

Staying dry, warm, keeping the tent upright with a good northwest wind, and not getting eaten by a bear that has decided that it is not time to hibernate are my main concerns.....when I look at that list I believe we may have some good stories to tell IF we get back. I keep thinking of the frozen guy on the movie ""Jeramia Johnson"". Thanks for the advise on where and how to find some of the northern. We will be spendind 90% of the time fishing for walleye, crappie, and hunting ducks, but we had no idea where to go for the northern. Thanks."

543554,Guest,2004-10-01 09:44:00,0,"Are the northerns a fish that will collect in the fall in respect to concentrations of bait fish? Or since they have the size advantage and can eat about anything they want, do they not really do any of that. Thanks guys. I will make a report when we get back. We leave the 15th of oct. and return the 24th. I am not sure of which island yet, we have to study the maps and try and centralize ourselves between the walleyes, crappies, and ducks, and also seek protected areas from the wind. And if lucky enough not have to sleep on a rock for 9 days and be able to drive a tent stake somewhere....:)"
