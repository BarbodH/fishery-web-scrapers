543612,Guest,2004-10-03 05:16:00,0,"Does catching big walleye excite you? Actually, the latest I've been up there is the last week in August and it felt like late October. (Of course, we've seen snow on the 4th of July, too) Walleye are naturally deeper but Clatouche is not the deepest lake, either. (There might be a few 30'+ holes.) Fish should be accessable. There are two other inhabitants of the Clatouche area that will be somewhere in the neighborhood to keep you company. Moose and bears. (Vist the outhouse at night with caution.) If outpost livin' is the life for you, this is certainly a place deserving of consideration. And, like I've said before, the main camp is less than an hour away."
543633,Guest,2004-10-04 11:02:00,0,"Thanks everyone for the info. Walleye Central rules! What a treat to be able to exchange info amoungst fellow fishermen. Should anyone have any questions concerning places I have been....Air Melancon, Scott Outfitter, Sasseginaga, the Gouin.....feel free to ask. The site search will cue up posts I have made in the past for all these places, but any more detailed questions I'll be glad to answer. Thanks again!"
543634,Guest,2004-10-04 11:45:00,0,Does anyone have the website foe O'Sullivan Lake Lodge? Thanks in advance.

543482,Guest,2004-09-27 13:05:00,0,"I'm part of a group of 8 seasoned Walleye fishermen who are exploring options on where to go this coming 2005 season. We would appreciate any feedback concerning the lodging at O'Sullivan Lake Lodge Outfitters' Outpost camps in Quebec. We have been to many different Outfitters ""Remote"" camps. and enjoy the challenge of fishing new waters. Been to their website where the Outpost camps are mentioned......but that's it, just mentioned. Specifically, how far are they away from the ""Main Lodge""? How many people will they accomodate comfortably? It sounds like there's more than one Outpost Camp.....are they set up the same or is one camp bigger and able to accomodate more people? Any recommendations as to which Outpost Camp you have used or prefer? Last season I remember reading some good fishing reports from O'Sullivan Lake.....any regulars out there that care to pass on a fishing report from 2004 ? Thank You!"
543494,Guest,2004-09-28 12:40:00,0,"baxter, i've been to both of their's twice. 88' and 89' at lake esden, we fished only for pike and didn't know what a walleye was. they have upgraded this fly-in only camp to accomodate 6-8 i believe (but check) and it now also has running, hot water. they say this lake is a lake of 100 walleye a day, and a friend in fact was their in 2003 and once they patterned the eyes they bailed them. lac clatouche (91' and 92'), accessible by boat from the main lodge is smaller, w/no running water but sits beside the beautiful in-flow river to clatouche and o'sullivan. both camps are good for pike, but at clatouche you may have to work a little harder for the eyes, again we were fishing for pike back then so take that walleye comment for what it is worth. we have been at the main lodge now since 96' and love it. can't beat the eye fishing, plus good pike and monster lake trout swim these waters (i caught a 31 lber a few years back). russell the owner is the greatest and helpful with all your needs. can't wait to get back there in june!! hope this helps. bruce"
543505,Guest,2004-09-29 05:30:00,0,"Bruce: Thanks for the reply. You mentioned that the camp at lac clatouche was smaller.....how many guys could it accomodate? I like what I'm hearing about O'Sullivan......did a search on this Forum and read some good fishing reports from past years. The poster Thunderstick had alot of info on O'Sullivan, hope to hear from him. Thanks again , hope to hear back from you."
543518,Guest,2004-09-29 12:21:00,0,"baxter, lac clatouche sleeps 6 i belive and matbe more. we usaully visit once each year just to see the old place but this past year we never even made up the river to clatouche. go to their website and e-mail stan and he'll get you up to speed. good luck!!"
543547,Guest,2004-10-01 04:05:00,0,"I've been going to O'Sullivan since '80 and have fished in three of the outpost lakes. We fish Clatouche a lot during our annual trip. It's quite accessable from the main lake and if you opt for it, you'll be able to take advantage of the great fishing on the main lake. It must be my age, but I prefer the comfort of the main camp. Like I say, we fish Clatouche plenty and have been rewarded with some outstanding pike. Last season I had one to the boat that was over 25lbs. (We'll be back.) Four years ago I boated a 24 lb-er. The beauty of this place is its options. The Clatouche Outpost keeps those options open, the Esden Outpost does not. However, Esden definitely has a lot going for it, not the least of which is more comfortable digs. When I was there it was still quite rustic but the fishing on the lake itself was significant. LOTS of pike. Plenty of walleye and, oh did I mention: LOTS of pike. All in all, if you enjoy the outpost experience, you'll not go wrong at either camp. Just a note: Last June-July we spent a week at O'Sullivan and it rained every day. One day it never stopped raining. It was nice to get back to our warm, lighted cabin to dry out. Just a thought."

543550,Guest,2004-10-01 08:39:00,0,"Thunderstick: Thanks for the reply. The info you and Bruce have provided is appreciated. I'm putting together a picture in my mind of Clatouche....No running water.....I picture an outhouse (no problem)...but do they have a sink set up for doing dishes etc.? Whats that like, do you need to haul lake water in buckets, or is there a gravity feed tank of some sort set up? I'm also assuming there's no shower there as well. All do-able with my gang of 8, I'd just like to have some idea of what to expect if we go there. 2 of our members are sick puppies.....they actually go after the Nords for a day or two while the rest of us concentrate on Walleye......sounds like Clatouche will be a hit with them in that you both mention some serious Nord fishin. We spent a real tough week a couple of years ago on Lake Sasseginaga......rained each and every day, and the wind was out of the east most of the time.....tough weather conditions and real tough fishing. Yet we still had a ball. You bet, it's always good to get back to a warm, lighted cabin. I'd expect that there's a woodstove and gas lights at Clatouche? Any details you'd care to provide on the Clatouche cabin? Thanks again!"
