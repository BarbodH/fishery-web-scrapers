543615,Guest,2004-10-03 13:48:00,0,Looking at a trip to Kayedon Lake with Twin Lakes Outfitters out of Nakina. Would like to hear from anyone who has experience with this outfitter or has fished Kayedon Lake.
543617,Mr. Twister,2004-10-03 16:15:00,1,"Twin Lakes no longer supplies their own air transportation. the flying is contracted out to Nakina Air Service, this leaves them with more time to work on their facilities. They installed brand new bunks in the outpost that I was on this spring while we were there and are in the process of remodeling the entire cabin. They are building new cabins and remodeling others, all with separate bedrooms When things haven't gone exactly the way we would like, Bill and Michelle have bent over backwards to make it right with us, they are good people to deal with. I haven't fished Kayedon yet so can't give you any real help except to tell you that it does have a good reputation."

543619,Guest,2004-10-03 16:55:00,0,Probably early Sept.
543645,Guest,2004-10-04 19:50:00,0,"Flew with them to their cabin on Saga in 2002. Was the last flyin we did after about 20 years. Not because of the service, Bill and Michelle were excellent hosts. It just got too costly for me to pay for myself and 2 grandsons. Have been doing a drive in lake the last 2 years and have had excellent fishing and accomodations. If I were to do a flyin trip again I wouldn't hesitate to use Twin Lakes or Leuenbergers in the Nakina area. Had superb trips with both outfitters since 1988."
