543595,Guest,2004-10-01 12:56:00,0,"If you're looking for stimulating conversation, perhaps you ought to try your local coffee shop. Personally, I go up there to fish. I've been going to that camp for eighteen years, which means I was there several years before Jerry and Sally bought it. Under the previous ownership, carried our gear up the hill to the cabins ourselves. We bailed out our own boats out after it rained. We changed our own gas tanks. There were no seats in the boats. The cabins and appliances were in disrepair. Now, our gear is delivered to the front door and picked up when we get ready to leave camp. The gas tanks are filled every morning. The boats are bailed out if it rains. Decks have been added to every cabin. Woodstoves have been replaced. The appliances have been upgraded. Several of the cabins had new floors this year. We had a new table and chairs in our cabin this year. The fish-cleaning house is always clean as a pin as are the cabins when we arrive. All these things take time, money, and effort. I challenge anyone to find a camp owner who works harder to make his camp an enjoyable place to visit than Jerry Lundy. He's out there on the job at 6:00 every morning. I seldom try to strike up a conversation with Jerry while we are in camp because I know how busy he is and how much he has on his mind. I do know that if we need something, it's attended to immediately no matter how busy he is. There's a reason that camp has over a ninety percent occupancy rate virtually every season and it's not just because of the fishing. While the accomodations are far from luxurious, they are comfortable and the boats and motors are very well-maintained. I'm sure you could find a camp where the owner spends a lot of time glad-handing with his guests. I suspect you'd find the condition of the facilities would indicate exactly that unless you're willing to lay out a bunch more cash for a week's fishing than you pay at Lundy's. One of these days soon, Jerry and Sally are going to be ready to call it quits and retire. That will be a sad day for me. The next owner of that camp is going to have a huge pair of shoes to fill."
543611,AB,2004-10-02 21:52:00,61,"There's a reason that Wabaskang has 7 camps on it. It's your choice which one you like to do business with. Some owners like conversation with the clients while others may not. Some may make you carry your own bags, watch you butcher instead of fillet, let you search all week for fish instead of giving tips, ETC. ETC. ETC. I found one that chuckled at me my first time bringing in a pair of hammerheads. Later he showed me how to fillet, where and how to fish. Soon I was held in such regard as to document my own gas, my own groceries, my own minnows, if and when the lodge owner was busy... he trusted me to do these things. One time when I threw a rod through a block - the owner helped me secure a comparable motor from a camp selling out down the road at a considerable discount. A christmas card, a winter visit to my place, not paying the bill until the fall crop was in, the best cabin year in and year out, a blueberry pie, a hug from the wife and a handshake from the man every year we arrived. These are a few of the things that made my lodge owner - my kind of business man. Now, I did business with this man for years and wouldn't expect that kind of treatment elsewhere. That is why I encourage people to find a camp they like and stick with it. It should only get better with time. And if it doesn't - pick another camp!"
543098,Fred_G,2004-08-31 09:49:00,908,"Mike, Thanks for the report. Heading up on September 17th. This will give me a good starting point."
543108,Guest,2004-08-31 15:22:00,0,"One other thing to consider when fishing Wabaskang are the Jumbo Perch. I was up there a couple of years ago and they saved the trip for me. It was a tough bite on the eyes because of the cold fronts moving through. We did very well on the jumbos. Some up in the 13 inch range. I would say that the average was 10 +. Great eating, and fun catching."
543134,Guest,2004-09-02 08:27:00,0,"Fred, your heading up the 17th? That has got to be some cold trips across the lake! I was up a few years ago from Sept 10-17 and most of our pictures we were wearing carhartts, stocking caps, and gloves, but the fishing was still good. Another spot I'd try for big northern is in the middle lake a big bay called Pat's Bay. Its along the north shore of the middle lake and it has an opening approx 200 yards wide and goes back over 500 yards. Work the opening with BIG suicks or jerkbaits, and if casting is slow start trolling the whole bay, the weeds will be down to nothing and you shouldn't get hung up on any as your covering ground. A friend of mine goes this week and this is the only place he fishes all week for northern. Good Luck"
543147,Fred_G,2004-09-02 13:40:00,908,"Thanks for the tip Mike! I think I know where that it. I know it's going to be cold. We were up there last September the week of the 15th. It was cold and rainy most of the week, but we had a good time. Wasn't to bad except for the runs across the lake. My wife is a real trooper. We go up so late due to her work shedule, so she doesn't complain. I guess we just have to pray for some warm weather!"
543171,Stu,2004-09-04 08:57:00,472,"Hey guys, I am trying to locate a sunken island in the north lake. It is just off of the penninsula (southeast). I found it by accident a couple of years ago, but lost it. Do you know where it is?"
543186,kingsway2,2004-09-06 16:21:00,15,The sunkin Island is north of the A-Frame 3/4 of the way to shore in line with the point on the north shore. Rich
543414,Guest,2004-09-22 11:23:00,0,"I got back last Saturday from a weeklong trip to Wabaskang. As usual, we stayed at Lundy's. This was the toughest week of walleye fishing we've had on Wabaskang in the eighteen years I've been fishing the lake. The wind blew out of the east and northeast practically all week with cool temperatures and we had quite a bit of rain. Due to the cool summer, the water temperature was about five or six degrees cooler than normal for this time of year. We didn't have trouble finding fish. We just had trouble getting them to bite. The fish were really skittish. We caught several nice walleyes and I had a few in excess of twenty inches and several in the 18-20 inch range. They just weren't there in the numbers that they have been for the last several years. Most of the nicer fish were caught in 32-38 feet of water on jigs and minnows. We tried trolling crankbaits on leadcore line one morning and got only one fish. The Hopkins spoons that have been so effective the last few years were not very productive this year. One thing that eased the pain a little bit was the smallmouth fishing. This lake has developed into an outstanding smallmouth fishery. There were several taken in excess of 18 inches with the largest being 19 1/2. Most were taken on Rattletraps or tube jigs. We still had a great trip and it's pretty hard to be very upset about the fishing. The fishing has been outstanding for the last several years and we were kind of past due for a week where we had to work a little harder for the fish. The hospitality of Jerry and Sally Lundy and their outstanding facilities certainly makes it easier to bear. If there's a better run fishing camp anywhere in Ontario, you couldn't prove it by me."
543544,Guest,2004-09-30 21:49:00,0,We have stayed with Jerry and Sally and Jerry never spoke to me all week long! Sally was usually pretty cordial. The fishing on Wabaskang is generally wonderful. We just had to work a little harder this year.

543051,Guest,2004-08-29 15:50:00,0,We'll be arriving at Lundy's Camp on September 10 and I'm curious how the bite has been. The last report I saw on here was from a couple of weeks ago.
543053,Trailerguy,2004-08-29 18:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I was there a week ago hunting, didn't have time to fish. But I talked to Big Mike, he said the bite was hot on the points, and heating up around Doe island. It must have been good,lol, he didn't want to stop fishing long enough to catch a cold one. ;-) He should be coming back pretty soon with a report for us."
543054,Guest,2004-08-29 19:21:00,0,Thanks. I appreciate the report. This will be my eighteenth trip to Wabaskang and I've never spent much time fishing around Doe Island. I guess I'll have to make it a point to check it out a little closer.

543076,Trailerguy,2004-08-30 10:31:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Wabaskang is located on HWY 105 at Perrault Falls, Ont. That's 25 miles south of Ear Falls and the dam on Lac Suel. It is a larger lake, but consists of a bunch of irregular shaped sections with many islands and points. It has walleye, small mouth, pike, trout and whitefish. Several other lakes are accessable from Wabby, Wine and Keynote are examples. There are six or seven resorts on Wabby, but not a lot of ""pressure"" as there are so many places to go, and different types of water to fish. Besides that it's just a few miles to Scout Lake and then into Lac Suel, not to mention dozens of small lakes out on the logging roads to fish on a windy day."
543079,Guest,2004-08-30 11:51:00,0,"Trailerguy hit the nail on the head when he said I was having too much fun fishing to stop, however, Trailerguy I did finally stop over to your place on Tues or Wed around 4:30 but it looked quiet, never got out of the boat, and caught 5 northerns along your weeds in front of your place. Fishing was very good, lots of good walleyes and good northerns. Walleyes were mainly in 30-35' of water, just about any point on the Big Lake and middle lake were good, with nothing particularly better than others. Northern fishing was good anywhere you fished, mostly on the deep edges for the better fish, using jerk baits and large bucktails. I really had a good time talking shortly with you Trailerguy, and hope to meet you again some time, I'll definately give a cold one the bottoms up with you someday! P.S. There was a young bear in camp all week that sure loved to drink oil out of fish cookers!!!"
