543631,Guest,2004-10-04 09:39:00,0,"OK proud netter. thanks for the reply. You read the other post for LOTW and I am wondering if what was said is true about the native rights. Some natives take advantage of this and instead of using this for their personal consumption they are selling the fish they catch, which would seem to be illegal. thanks again. Alan"
543636,Guest,2004-10-04 12:29:00,0,"Ok proud netter explain to me why the government bought out commercial licenses years ago on LOTW to repair the decimated fishery. Explain to me why Shoal Lake is still closed for walleye after 20 years and still not recovered from netting. Yes native netting has been going on for a long time, but not to the scale seen this year and the scale intended for next year. However you slice it, the fishery is in trouble once again. Lets see how the lake looks in 5 years from now."
543637,Guest,2004-10-04 12:40:00,0,"Whitefish are netted, not walleye. The netting is watched very carefully and there is a incidental catch of walleye but very few. Are we getting fisherman excited about nothing? I beleive so."
543639,Guest,2004-10-04 13:24:00,0,"agree with pat. let's stop stirring the pot. whatever the natives are and have been doing on lac seul, it has obviously not hurt the fishery. whit"
543640,Guest,2004-10-04 13:33:00,0,"FYI, my reply and comments were directed to the question about the situation on LOTW. I'm very happy to hear that the Lac Seul fishery is being carefully managed to maintain it as a world class fishery. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for LOTW!"
543642,Guest,2004-10-04 15:53:00,0,Look what happened to upper and lower red lake.
543643,Guest,2004-10-04 16:05:00,0,"Approximately a year ago I called the MNR office in the Lac Suel area to ask about netting on the lake. The response I received was that there were threee active netting licenses (permits) at that time. One was not being used, one was being used for whitefish, and the status of the third license was not known by the person on the phone."
543504,Guest,2004-09-28 23:57:00,0,"Does native netting go on, on lac saul? Just wondering."
543509,Guest,2004-09-29 08:36:00,0,"If there is a reserve on the lake, it is undoubtedly netted."
543513,srj,2004-09-29 10:25:00,971,Yes it does. Generally in the fall when the ciscoes move to the shoreline.
543516,Guest,2004-09-29 11:50:00,0,Commercial netting is allowed for whitefish. Have seen the marker bouys and boats unloading fish @ the public landing by Gold Pines.
543521,Guest,2004-09-29 14:26:00,0,Hopefully locals are keeping a sharp eye out so that the netting doesn't start to become the nightmare that is occuring on LOTW and the Winnipeg River.
543569,orchard frank,2004-10-01 21:43:00,1900,We saw 2 people pulling nets in the Grassy Lake area in the first few days of Sept. I was concerned because we had jsut came through that area and did not notice any markers.

543570,Guest,2004-10-01 23:38:00,0,the natives must be more consciesence - I know the spelling is wrong- than the ones at LOTW because in the 25 years we went to lac saul we were never aware or noticed anything like netting going on.

543630,Guest,2004-10-04 09:28:00,0,"Yes, there should be some native netters in Lac Seul, it has been going on for decades and the fishery has never been better. I have read the posting re LOTW and the only thing I can say is if the netting was destroying the fishery we wouldn't have some many Americans coming back year after year, and still they show up, and we are more than will to share with you folks. Native netting is a reality in Canada, it is legal, Native rights are protected by our constitution (just like your right to bear arms), it has been going on for decades and we still have a world class fishery. We don't need the locals to look after us and most are quite accepting of our rights to harvest fish and wildlife outside the provincial system. And yes, most nets are not marked as some do-gooder will inevitably come alone and either steal it and the fish or cut it loose to drift around the lake and then we all lose."
