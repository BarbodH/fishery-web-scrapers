What is the last stretch of road like? How many hours from the border is it? Finally, I know the fishing will be ""great"" up there, but I am looking for objective opinions comparing the Pickle Lake area with the Armstrong and Red Lake areas. Thanks in advance."
543424,Guest,2004-09-23 06:46:00,0,"I got back from Savant Lake area the day after labor day. I also came from Wisconsin and went up to Superior and up through Cloquet, up 33 to 53 to Fort Frances. The resort owners wife said she comes up the north shore and crosses south of Thunder Bay. A horse apiece I would guess. An advantage of coming across south of Thunder Bay is that you don't have to drive the highway south of Dryden, which is narrow and curvey. Anyway, the highway from Ignance to Savant Lake has some stretches where there is not any pavement anymore. They must be planning on fixing or maybe not. There was not major road construction coming from I-Falls to Savant Lake. Thats about all I can tell you. Sorry couldn't remember road numbers."
543425,walleye1230,2004-09-23 07:32:00,41,"Coming from Wisconsin, take hwy 53 out of Eau Claire, its four lane and 65 all the way to Superior, they bypassed all of the towns a few years ago. Once past Duluth, its 4 lane and 65 mphto Virginia. 53 to I-Falls is a good road and can make time. Once in Canada, 11 is fine, 502 from Fort Frances to Dryden is a good road now. They've made vast improvements in the last few years. Only one 20 mile stretch that is bumpy. It is very curvy and not many or long passing lanes which can be a problem on Saturday's especially. I can't speak north of Dryden as we fish Eagle Lake. Hope this helps in your decision."
543426,Guest,2004-09-23 08:35:00,0,"I believe the Canadian roads are better thru Thunder Bay, especially if you are pulling a boat. Hwy 17 is smooth sailing to Ignace and traffic moves right along. 599 N. to Savant is not too bad. It's better than 516 from Sioux Lookout. Time wise is about the same. We usually go up through Fort Frances and come home through Pigeon River. Pigeon River comming back in has had much shorter wait times in the summer as well. Sorry, can't help on the fishing report."
543429,walleye1230,2004-09-23 11:57:00,41,"To add onto LovetoFish, we crossed at Fort Frances both times on a Saturday. Going in (8 a.m.) no line. Coming out (11 a.m.), 2 hours in line. Pigion Falls and Blaudette will definetly have shorter lines than Fort if crossing at peak times (mainly Friday and Saturday afternoons)"
543490,lobo1,2004-09-28 07:30:00,734,I been to all three towns and fished fly-ins from each. I would say that Pickle Lake was my least favorite town. seems that every time I was there - there were quite a few highly intoxicated bums walking the streets and watching you and your stuff. You have to watch your gear like a hawk and watch your booze like a grizzly. for an overnight stay it aint too bad for a group of guys as long as you dont have big expectations as to what you are going to find at the end of the road - because frankly - you will be dissapointed. if your expecting some sort of quaint little touristy mining town you are SOL. Take your gear into your motel with you overnight. confirm your motel several times before leaving home. The road itself (last leg north) is curvy and decent but LONG - seems like you drive forever. It's a nice drive though. You cant get going too fast due to the curves and occassional bumps and mini hills. great fishing awaits you. we had a fantastic air service up there called Northstar Air - best one I ever been on - they know everything about the area if you need any help with your plans lobo1

543507,jigman 2003,2004-09-29 06:05:00,981,"No, I am not looking for a quaint little town. I have seen Red Lake during a festival and it was full of drunken idiots (mainly natives) at 10:00 A.M. I keep an eye on my stuff no matter where we go, but Red Lake was a little spooky both times we flew out of there. While Armstrong is tiny, I have not had the concerns there as I did at Red Lake. Still lock everything up tight and back my truck up to my hotel room, however ;) I was mainly interested in the road itself. Wanted to know just what one previous poster stated, i.e long, bumpy, curvy, paved, etc. Thanks to everyone for the info."
543514,Guest,2004-09-29 10:43:00,0,Go to Duluth and take 61 north to Pigeon River. When you get into Canada take 130 as a short cut around Thunder bay and then take 17 across to gnace and north on 599 to Pickle Lake. Good roads.
