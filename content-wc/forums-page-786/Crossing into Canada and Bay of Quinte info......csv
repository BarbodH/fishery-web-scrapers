543538,walteye,2004-09-30 11:01:00,1084,Looking to come up to BOC weekend of October 9-11 from Pennsylvania and bringing my son and German Shepherd with me. The dog is all up to date with his tags-do I need to bring a paper from my vet about the rest of his innoculations (I didn't need anything 3 years ago)? Also-is the walleye fishing starting to pick up yet-I called a couple of bait shops and they said that the fishing is great-but I was told that same line 3 years ago and travelled there in November-got there the next morning and there was 40 feet of ice from the shoreline-you couldn't put a boat in to reach open water!!! Thanks for any real info.... Walteye

Now all I need is the walleye to cooperate at BOQ. Walteye"
