Temps I found ranged from 56-63F The farther from the Perrault Falls the cooler it got. Had no problem catching fish the week I was there. Was using jig and a worm for the eyes and I have one of those bait ball lures (5"" long diving to 4') that was smashing northerns when trolling anywhere, no monsters though"
