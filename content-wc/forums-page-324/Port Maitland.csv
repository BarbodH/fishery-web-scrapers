2888209,Esleeman,2014-06-11 11:48:00,6,Anyone ever fish for walleyes around the Port Maitland area? Looks cool on the lakemaster chip was thinking of trying it out this weekend. Thanks

Try calling fishmasters bait and tackle in dunnville or search his forum you'll find lots of info there. He will point u in the right direction and when it comes to finding the eyes off port his custom tyed worm harnesses are top notch. Mike
