2896145,forgop,2014-06-14 04:19:00,880,"That would be great, but they are a bit far for a drive (20 hours). I've looked them up on some of your other posts, but I don't think I can take that much more driving."
2896201,Slushfish,2014-06-14 05:49:00,263,"We have two boys 7&14. They both have been making our Canada trips since they were 6 or 8 months old. The way we work it, once a year we make a trip to LOTW to a weekly rate cabin. Usually 2 weeks. 3 or 4 trips/year in the tent. If the boys can't go, we don't go!"
2755025,forgop,2014-05-03 17:56:00,880,"The recent children threads made me think about the likelihood of taking my girls most likely beginning in 2016. My oldest will be 13 and the youngest would be 11 at the time of a trip. I really want to take a trip with Hawk Air, but their discounts are a bit less desirable for kids given the timing. May/June is only $200 off, while July/August is half off. My daughters are out of school from the first week of June and go back the last week of May for their balanced calendar schedule. Thus, we'd most likely target the first week or two of June if I had to guess. The other decision I'll have to make is whether I take just one at a time or both at the same time. Both have fished at a pond behind our house for a few years and are capable to baiting and would probably do ok removing most fish themselves. It may just be a bit crowded having 2 kids in the same boat though. Three to a boat means that ultimately 2 of us would be trolling on the same side, which would be the biggest hassle IMO. So, what outfitters/lakes would be your top recommendations in Ontario given the discounts provided for kids and quality of fishing? Would you absolutely take just 1 child per boat under my circumstances or would you take both of them with you? My cousin would be the other adult in our group and likely be in the same ""boat"" so to speak with children of virtually the exact same ages and whether we go as a group of 2 adult and 2 kids or a group of 2 adult and 4 kids. TIA for your suggestions."
2755089,Mike Borger,2014-05-03 18:44:00,1554,I can help you Duane I guarantee it. Shoot me an email or give me a call.
2755217,forgop,2014-05-03 19:36:00,880,How did I know you'd know a thing or two about this? I know you've taken your kids on a few trips and didn't see any advertised discount on Martin's site. Will give you a call closer to our trip for last minute Anjigaming preparation.
2755249,Mike Borger,2014-05-03 19:48:00,1554,Call anytime. Some of the outfitters I'm working with have some great discounts for kids.
2756665,Baitslinger,2014-05-04 10:30:00,93,"I've never done a ""guys only"" trip to Ontario. Every trip has been with the entire family; wife, kids, grandparents. I wouldn't give those up to go on my own for anything in the world. Our kids starting going when they were 6-8 or so. My daughter loves to fish when the bite is on, when its not, she enjoys just sitting in the front of the boat reading while her brother and I keep prospecting for the hot location and presentation. Mom is much the same, so three of us in the boat at once is really very simple, but even the little bit of extra work to troll three lines can be handled without too much trouble. Counting Grandma & Grandpa, the six of us switch off boats every time we go out; and the girls almost always choose to sit back by the fire in the cabin when its raining and cold. Anyways, I found numerous outfitters that were willing to give us some great deals on bringing the kids, especially a little later in the season. Just took a little time on the email and phone, which was fun in itself. All of them came by contacting the outfitter directly, even thought the rates on their respective websites were more than what we could afford to pay. Some of the outfitters drastically dropped their prices for the kids after we talked to them, and by our third trip north, we found a camp where we were very happy, and have been spending a week or two there every summer since."

2892729,forgop,2014-06-12 19:40:00,880,"This year will be just my 2nd trip as I've had nearly a 25 year hiatus of fishing from a boat. I want a couple of trips under my belt so I have a better idea of what I'm doing before bringing up the wife/kids. Last thing I want is to not really know much and hav a poor trip. You obviously make the most of it, but I know how disappointed my girls would have been with the results we had last September and that's going with someone that has experience at fishing at fly-in camps several times."
2892817,BreezyPoint,2014-06-12 19:53:00,1581,"I would probably try a drive in as opposed to fly in for their first trip. With two young, inexperienced partners being able to quickly get help would be useful. Besides that, I have done both drive in and fly in and have found the the fishing just as good and even better for the bigger fish at drive in places like Lake of the Woods, the English River and Lac Seul.A compromise may be a boat in on some island lodge at a place like Lake of the Woods. One place is located in a very sheltered area and has great fishing practically off their docks (and crappies at their docks).You may want to look at a place that charges a flat rate for the cabins. Also not taking a fly in should reduce the cost of the trip for you.I would take both...they are close in age and it's a great time to establish a family tradition. Don't leave one out. At their age, they are fully capable to fish and catch everything. I started taking my kids at ages two and four and they became life long fishing partners. They had caught muskies by age eight.Take the kids and have a great trip! You will never regret it.Frank"
2894185,RCDuck,2014-06-13 09:59:00,18,"I can't help you with the discount part as I haven't investigated it, but I've done about a trip a year for the last 6 years, both fly-in and drive-in with 2 of my kids. I have 5 kids, so I've been rotating my way down the list, two at a time. My first trip I took, my oldest was 9, so that's the age I put in as the minimum age. This year, kid's # 3 and 4 are going with me, ages 9 and 11. If they can do it, you won't have any problem with an 11 and 13 year old. Keep in mind, it will cut into your personal effective fishing time a little, but it is very worth it. When I took my oldest two (both girls) the first time, I didn't know if they'd like it or not, but I didn't ever want them to say their Dad never gave them the opportunity. Now that their younger siblings are the ones getting to go, the older girls are bummed that they're not going.All-in-all, I'd do whatever you have to do to take both... I'd way rather take my kids, and see the excitement they get out if it, than go with a bunch of guys."
2895185,curt1321,2014-06-13 15:21:00,16,"No decision here. You have to take both. It sounds like they both have some experience fishing and you'll be there to lend a hand. Besides, you want both of your kids to have memories that will last them a lifetime. They'll remember it for the rest of their lives and when father's day rolls around every year they'll tell everyone on how great a dad you were. Don't sweat the too many in a boat idea. A good outfitter will be able to accommodate you and your family. If they have any hesitations, look elsewhere. Just my two cents. Good luck. Curtis"
