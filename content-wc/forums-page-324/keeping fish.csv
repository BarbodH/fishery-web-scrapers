2890225,ricorth07,2014-06-12 06:43:00,1143,"OK, thanks Breezy.. I'll give it a try next timeAny specific technique, or just put a finger opening the gill, start from the top and do the semicircle ending back at the fish's body?Sent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2890273,BenBeattie,2014-06-12 07:04:00,232,Not sure what the houseboat and outpost guys do. If the water is cool I see no problem with dead fish on a stringer. Bottom line is no possession of live fish on Lac Seul so come up with a solution to keep your dead fish cool. The wet burlap sack that guys have mentioned seems worth trying.
2890529,kzoofisher,2014-06-12 07:49:00,5144,"All the gills attach at the throat, I use a poultry shear and cut them there. Fish are bled out in a matter of minutes. It can be a mess in the livewell or boat so you'll have to stringer them while they bleed or wash out your well. Some folks just hang them over the side for a couple minutes."
2890929,ricorth07,2014-06-12 09:33:00,1143,"Sounds like a plan.. I probably should look into a poultry shear, seems more efficient and safer while I experiment.Sent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2890985,Yarhcaz,2014-06-12 09:41:00,1389,"This is how I do it. I keep a pair of poultry scissors in the boat. Grab a fish, turn it over, Stick the scissors so one blade goes up into each set of gills, and snip. The blood comes shooting out, all fish will totally bled out in just minutes. I put them back in the live well and set it constantly run to get all the blood stained water out, then head in to go clean the fish. I am still undecided on if effects the taste of the fish but it sure does make for some nice snow white fillets"
2891001,ricorth07,2014-06-12 09:43:00,1143,"Yea.. Would sure beat guessing at poking the heart and have internal bleeding, staining the fillets..this way makes much more sense! Thanks guys!Sent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2891065,WallyNut,2014-06-12 10:12:00,79,"Rather than put fish back in livewell I carry a 6 gallon bucket along. Just before returning to dock take a few minutes to move fish from livewell to pail, slicing gills, and putting into the pail. Only need a few inches of water in the pail. Usually throw a towel over the top of the pail. They'll be bled out by the time you get back. Lots of other uses for the pail if you carry garbage bags along."
2888801,SinOrSwim,2014-06-11 15:53:00,1528,"We always used a rope style stringer with the metal clips that slid up and down. That way you didn't pull the fish out of the water while hooking another one. We put the clip through the bottom lip in that very thin area and back in the water. We had very good luck keeping them alive. But, they weren't on there for more than a few hours. We only kept what we wanted for lunch before lunch and then kept dinner after lunch which was usually 2pm or so and we were always in by about 6 or 7 pm. Only time out of the water is if we moved. They were definitely lively flipping next to my feet so you knew they weren't dead and gonna get all gross.Ice on a fly-in is a precious commodity for drinks. WE always paid some extra though and had more blocks flown in. Warm beer sucks."
2888857,Yarhcaz,2014-06-11 16:03:00,1389,"I find it kind of funny reading these posts...When I started fishing there were no livewells...or at least none in most of the boats used to fish around here (South Dakota), we used stringers for years, and shockingly I am still here to type this as no adverse effects from eating them. The limit used to be 8 fish per person per day so every person in the boat had their own stringer. We even fished in July and August....110 degrees in the air and I would guess surface temps in the 80's. People love to make drama on things that really should be drama free.... just my two cents. Oh and I love having a live well versus the old days...but on those super hot days the old stringers did a better job than livewells do (assuming you are not adding ice). The livewells are truly picking up surface water and the old stringers would go down several feet (hence cooler water). Now the run back to ramp/camp is another story...livewells win by knockout on that front but bleeding them on tossing them in a cooler is best anyway."
2889209,yoopertrout,2014-06-11 18:36:00,1172,"Although I mostly catch and release, fishing is a blood sport. I don't believe fish experience the kind of pain that mammals do. That said, there's nothing unmanly about having respect for your quarry and killing it quickly. Plus, as others have mentioned, fish is better to eat if it is killed and placed on ice rather than dying slowly on a stringer."
2889513,MorganMan,2014-06-11 20:30:00,341,"So, no good answer and opinions differ greatly again. One thing you may want to find out is, are stringers legal? We have been told after many years of using them that they are not? Maybe depends on the province or lake?"
2889625,BenBeattie,2014-06-11 21:04:00,232,"It's not a matter if stringer are legal or not it's whether possession of live fish is legal or not. For example, on Lac Seul, possession of live fish is not permitted. However, if the fish are dead on a stringer, there's no problem."
2889785,SinOrSwim,2014-06-11 21:50:00,1528,Am curious. How do the outposts on Lac Seul or the houseboats deal with this? I can't imagine they have ice to keep them in coolers like those of us coming from a lodge?If I'm on a fly-in I'm probably using a stringer whether that is right or wrong. A dead fish on a stringer doesn't seem like a good idea.
2889889,kzoofisher,2014-06-12 03:12:00,5144,"All true. I would say that there is something unmanly about not having respect for your quarry and killing it quickly. Animals and kids who don't know better do that. A man takes care of business, whether that be keeping his equipment in good order, obeying the game laws, respecting the resource and the use of it by others or dispatching his take. My two cents, anyway."
2890153,ricorth07,2014-06-12 06:35:00,1143,"When you guys kill off your fish quickly, and it was mentioned about slicing the gills, what is your technique cause we always try to poke the heart to let it bleed out. Is slicing the gills an easier way and quicker for the fish? I just don't know, I'm still novice at thisSent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2890185,BreezyPoint,2014-06-12 06:38:00,1581,"When you cut the gills, they bleed out externally and very fast, because the heart is pumping blood to the gills. I just take a sharp knife and slice around the edges in a semicircle until the blood starts flowing fast. May not be the best technique, but it works for me and I love the snowy white fillets!Frank"
2890201,tv4fish,2014-06-12 06:40:00,2694,"My vote is Yes, it is."
2887721,MrSimon,2014-06-11 10:18:00,922,"So you are considering taking extra coolers, batteries, bubblers, and ice on a fly-in .... all because you feel bad about putting a walleye on a stringer? To me, that seems ridiculous."
2887841,BreezyPoint,2014-06-11 10:36:00,1581,"Tying up the stringer, unattended doesn't always work, especially if there are otters in the area. I have seen them make short work of a stringer of fish.Frank"
2887849,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-11 10:37:00,1460,"Yup, I gotta agree with Mr. Simon on this. Man O Man, are we getting all touchy feely around here. I get outta fish camp, check my Walleye Central, and find out everybody has turned in their Man Cards."
2887881,Aaron-IN,2014-06-11 10:41:00,500,"LOL, having done a number of fly-ins that is exactly what I was thinking. Just go back and clean what you are going to eat before they die on the stringer."
2887913,v-bay gord,2014-06-11 10:43:00,3168,"Aside from the touchy-feely aspect, a stringer is probably the worse way to keep fish fresh. Unless the water is ice cold, once that fish is dead on your stringer it will deteriorate quickly (based on my observation of cleaning hundreds of walleyes). You are better off keeping them in a damp burlap sack in a shady spot in the boat. Nothing worse than a mushy stringer walleye that's been hauled around in 60-70 degree water all day......"
2888305,Lovetofish,2014-06-11 12:38:00,458,At the end of the day keep a few to eat and throw them in a 5 gallon pail with some water in it.
2888377,Guest,2014-06-11 12:59:00,0,"I've used stringers in the past, before livewells came along and of course on slow days when only the minimum size seems to be biting, I appreciate the ability to cull. More than once, I've come across a stringer of bloated dead fish. How many never float, who knows. I'm not being judgmental. There are times when moving around a lake I've started to make my move before I brought in the stringer. With todays powerful motors, the likelihood is all the greater that the connection to the boat will give. I'm glad for the heads up on the slow cooling power of propane fridges. We plan to take a couple of small chunks of dry ice for the drive up. We will transfer what's left to the propane freezers and throw in some water bottles. Thanks for the input."
2888401,tooski,2014-06-11 13:06:00,393,"A couple things...one, people don't really cull fish in Canada do they? I think previously mentioned, what's the diff in a couple inches? Secondly, we do what V-bay does. Put them in a wet burlap sack. Amazing really how cold it keeps fish as the water evaporates. Try it, really..."

2888513,v-bay gord,2014-06-11 13:48:00,3168,It's an old concept. Here's an article from 1983 (Field and Stream) that talks about using burlap to keep things cool. http://books.google.ca/books?id=Fqr0...20sack&f=false
2886649,Guest,2014-06-11 04:57:00,0,"I didn't want to hijack the fish abuser thread so I'm introducing a question along the abuse theme separately. I'm not being judgmental here but it has always bothered me to string fish and haul them in an out of the water as I change fishing spots or slow troll them off the boat. My own rig has a large livewell and it extends the use of catch and release in that it allows me to cull. Next week I'm doing a fly-in with my buddies and although the boats we will use are 16 ft lunds they have no livewells. I've pushed the idea of useing two old coolers capable of holding of holding 20 inch walleyes and refreshing the water using a small bucket occasionally or taking a battery operated airpump with us. Another thought was to use thermal bags available now for a couple of bucks that with an ice pack should keep the fish cool enough until fileting time, this would require killing the fish first. I'm really set on not stringing fish so I wonder if anyone has similar thoughts and how do you deal with it. We also like to keep 28 to 30 inch pike for fileting and they would present another dilemma. Thanks for your thoughts."
2886673,BayOfQuinte,2014-06-11 05:06:00,173,"In my opinion the most humane way is the decide to harvest a fish or not immediately. If you are not going to harvest it. Let it swim away if you are going to harvest it then kill it, bleed it and get it on ice. Why cull at all? Is that extra 2"" of meat really going to make a difference? Assuming there is no slot limit or size restriction on the lake then bring a small board and a knife with you. Slice the gills and keep it overboard until it is bled out (maybe 2 minutes) then filet it. Bleeding it takes all the mess out of cleaning and in my opinion makes the meat better. Just put the filets on Ice in a small cooler. For a fly in just use a soft sided cooler with ice you make as you won't need much. Keep it in the shade on the boat. The ones that immediately swim away are healthier and happier. The ones you harvest are fresher and better. Scott Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
2886777,bigwalleye1,2014-06-11 06:00:00,2632,"Bay of Quinte nailed it. Also, some Canadian lakes prohibit catch-think about it-release. Lac Seul, for example, requires kept fish to be killed immediately, no culling. Catch and decide."
2886849,v-bay gord,2014-06-11 06:23:00,3168,A cooler with a couple frozen water bottles.....don't cull.
2886865,BrianinVA,2014-06-11 06:28:00,160,"Assuming you are fishing Ontario, pike 27.5-36 are in the protected slot so there should be no dilemma there."

2886937,Guest,2014-06-11 06:53:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback. I'm in agreement with killing and cooling on this fly-in (Quebec) What brought it into question was a couple of videos I saw that showed the use of stringers in both cases. The lakes stated limit on pike is nothing over 28 inches kept measured to the fork....equals 30 inches or close to it. I find that size ideal for boneless fileting. Personally, with eating sized walleyes, I've never bothered to bleed them. Always great when fresh."
2887001,SinOrSwim,2014-06-11 07:02:00,1528,"We struggled to have enough ice for drink coolers on fly-ins much less ice to use a fish cooler. We always used stringers. Yes, not the best way but was the only option we had really. THe propane freezers we had would take more than 24 hours to freeze a full bottle of water, much less 8 or 10 of them. We haven't flown in for a couple years now and the resort we stay has an ice machine and coolers specifically for this so we don't have to ruin our own. Because **** those things can get skanky"
2887313,Draco1206,2014-06-11 08:30:00,175,"Our outpost camp we stayed in last week had a small refrigerator/freezer that barely kept things cold let alone make ice. We have always stringered our fish on fly-ins. What we normally do though when we need fish for a meal, we go out and catch what we need and bring them back to camp and fillet them while they're fresh, very rarely do we have a dead fish. If we intend to stay out longer or decide to go pike fishing after catching our dinner walleyes we will tie our stringer to a shady deep spot on the shore and pick it up later. Just make sure to tie it securely as we have lost stringers that weren't secured well."
