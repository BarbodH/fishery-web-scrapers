Anyhow, fishing the past week has been nothing less than phenomenal. Walleyes have been either deep or shallow (27 feet of less than 10 feet). Catching a ton of fish, but having to weed through some of the smaller ones. The crappies are biting off our dock, in fact I netted a 48"" musky tonight... she wouldn't let go of the 12"" crappie she had in her mouth. Was a ton of fun! The only fish that is a little slower than it should be, are small mouth. We're still getting quite a few, just not as many as we would expect in early June. Water levels are more than 1 foot high, water temps are pushing into the mid-upper 60's, and water clarity is very good for this time of year (very few high wind days so far). As always, if anyone's in the area, feel free to swing by and have a cup of coffee. I always enjoy meeting walleye central friends and talking fishing!"

2881857,Obabikon,2014-06-09 17:52:00,2370,"Today, myself and two other guides went out. When we came back in, I told them that I could only find fish in 24-28 feet of water. One of them only found fish in 16-18 feet The other could only get them in less than 12 feet. Funny how that works sometimes, but we all caught a lot of nice fish today. Just seemed to be where you had confidence to fish."
2882433,Shorelunch,2014-06-09 20:15:00,554,What type of structure(s) are you and your guides fishing?
2882441,Obabikon,2014-06-09 20:19:00,2370,"Pretty much everything. Points, rocky shore lines, and mud/sand channels. I tried a few humps, but didn't have any luck."
2889001,Obabikon,2014-06-11 16:55:00,2370,"Fishing has stayed strong. The small cold snap has moved the crappie out away from the dock, but the walleyes and northern are biting great. Many nicer fish being caught in 16-18 feet of water. Lots of little ones out deep. Rained off and on all day today... sounds like rain and wind tomorrow."
2890489,Laker10,2014-06-12 07:46:00,100,I would like to know if Morson has a grocery store? Thanks for the updates.
2890609,Guest,2014-06-12 08:08:00,0,"Best bet is LOTW foods in Baudette (across from Willie the Walleye). Resorts have some staples, but it's Baudette for now for groceries."
2890793,1shooter,2014-06-12 08:53:00,1493,I thought I recalled last year some sort of shopping center being built in Morson?
