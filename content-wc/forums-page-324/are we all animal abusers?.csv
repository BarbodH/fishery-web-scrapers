2885769,phishfearme,2014-06-10 18:30:00,1242,"yes, we kill for consumption - probably 5-6 walleye each during our 10 day trips, one for each of the 6 fish dinners we schedule. but like in your previous post, they are dispatched quickly and as humanely as possible. nothing goes to waste - the gulls, ravens and eagles take care of the carcasses overnight. anyone who eats meat of any type kills - either directly or has someone else do it for them (ie: buy it at the grocery store). it's hypocritical to think otherwise. fishing for consumption purposes is not the issue here. phish"
2885849,Draco1206,2014-06-10 18:56:00,175,"When I first read this post by Phish I assumed he was playing the devils advocate and just trying to stir the pot, and I didn't intend to respond to it. Although I still feel that was Phish's original intent, it seems this thread has taking on some legs and is reaching a point to where we need to stop and think about the alternatives to Phish's original post.Personally I feel if Phish truly feels this way he should not fish or he is being hypocritical. The object of wildlife management is for the benefit of the species as a whole, not each individual fish or animal. Emotion should be left out of all wildlife management decisions. Science and biology should be the only consideration when making wildlife management decisions. Does anyone here believe that catch and release isn't beneficial to the resource as a whole? As opposed to catch all you want, or keep all you want? In Phish's world if your limit was four walleyes you would keep the first four walleyes you caught whether they were 10 inchers or 30 inchers. Four pike whether they were 20 inchers or 40 inchers. How is this good for the resource? How many anglers would stop fishing all together because they had to stop fishing after catching four fish? How much money would our wildlife departments lose? Which in turn would harm the resource even more. As far as if fish have feelings? I don't know. I do know that a pike will grab a walleye and swallow it whole with all it's spiny fins and razor sharp gill rakers and act no worse for wear and then hit your daredevle right after. All the while it thrashes around in their belly while it slowly dies. I do know I have caught fish that have been released by other anglers and then re-caught again by another angler. So I don't think they feel pain as you or I do.Our job as wildlife consumers is to be the best steward of the resource that we can. Not to be touchy, feely about it but to use common sense and good scientific research and methods. We must all stand together in this or we will lose what those who do not hunt or fish don't understand. We have enough enemies out there that are slowly eroding our hunting and fishing rights that we do not need those that are supposedly one of us helping them. Phish if you truly feel as you say you do, please join PETA so I know who my real enemies are."
2886353,v-bay gord,2014-06-10 21:37:00,3168,"There are few among us who strictly fish for consumption purposes. If you catch 200 fish on a trip and eat 6 you are not fishing for consumption purposes. The act of fishing involves an art, a skill, relaxation, enjoyment, intellect, consumption and on and on. It's not just ""entertainment"", nor is it stocking the larder for a harsh winter. If you practice a degree of common sense and humanity in the pursuit of catching a fish I see no moral dilemma. A fish properly caught and released likely has no physical or emotional scars to deal with....unlike many of our human to human interactions. Like everything in life, there's a few bad apples that can bring down the majority. The act of fishing isn't the issue."
2886593,kzoofisher,2014-06-11 03:55:00,5144,"I agree with the two previous posts. phish, you have made a comparison between hooking a fish and abusing a dog, can you back up that comparison with anything besides anthropomorphism? It has been the experience of every other poster that fish do not feel pain in any way like humans do, let alone the way a dog does which is still quite different from us. There have been studies on this and it was only in 2003 that it was found that fish feel pain at all. They haven't got the brain physiology to feel pain as we do. In fact, fish are like most animals and have two basic ""emotional"" states: 1. I'm OK, 2. I'm going to die; and they alternate between those two states every day. If humans had the fear/flight response of fish or birds or so many animals we would spend our days screaming in fright every few minutes. As my father says, animals aren't stupid but they are only as smart as they need to be to survive. We've all sometimes been surprised at how low that threshold is for people, it's a lot lower for fish. Here's a c&p from a recent article on the subject. And the article itself http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...0808123719.htmAnd here is a very long paper from one of the researchers mentioned in the article above. It includes a great deal of discussion on the sociological development of fishing ethics and game management. http://catch-n-release.org/uploads/A...R_fish_sci.pdf"

2887457,Draco1206,2014-06-11 09:11:00,175,"On a lighter note, let's look at it from a fish's point of view. In this case, a large female walleye: ""Jeese, my life is so boring. Once a year I swim up the river and get pestered, prodded, and poked by a bunch of horny little males hoping they're the one to make me drop my eggs so they can be the one to fertilize them. When in truth I'm the one who decides when and where I will drop them. The males seem to get a lot more pleasure out of it than me. Now after I dropped my eggs I've been sitting here on this point for the past two weeks recovering from all the bumps and bruises caused by those pesky little males. I eat the same food every day, mostly little perch or whitefish, but occasionally even one of my own (hope I'm eating the males, one less male to pester me next year)."" -- When all of a sudden a flashy new orange and gold hot-n-tot with a rattle swims by-- "" Holy smokes what is that? I've never seen anything like that. I better get over there and check it out before those pesky males see it. Wow, that is cool, I wonder what it tastes like."" -- So she slams the hot-n-tot-- "" Crimey this thing is really trying to get away"" --so she dives deeper, only to be pulled upwards, wee-hee this is fun. She dives right, only to be pulled left. She dives left, only to be pulled to the right. Finally she gives up so she can see where this new food is taking her. As she reaches the surface she sees a large alien craft with two living aliens speaking some language she has never heard. One of the aliens is saying something like' ""wow that's a beauty! Get her in the net and let's get some pictures of her."" The other alien grabs some kind of contraption and snares her in it. While the other alien pulls her out of the snare and removes the ""new food"" from her mouth. She flares her gills and dorsal fin and feels a little satisfaction when the alien yelps and almost drops her. The other alien pulls out another contraption and she hers a snapping noise from the contraption and it nearly blinds her. They keep talking about how beautiful she is but they say she is not a ""keeper"" whatever that means. The alien lowers her to the water and holds her there until she decides to leave. As she is swimming away she's says "" wow, that was fun, I can't wait to do that again"" and she over hears the alien saying ""wow, that was fun, I can't wait to do that again."""

Horse racing, bull riding, owning pets, and zoos can all be classified as entertainment at the expense of another living thing. Those should be more offensive forms of entertainment, because they are mammals. Actually, if you look at it that way, everything we do (that is for entertainment) in some way, shape or form is at another living thing's expense. Go to the movies.... that building was built where grass used to grow. The grass was killed simply so we could be entertained. There were probably many living things that were displaced. I know you probably just wanted to see others opinions and discuss this. I'm not even sure you actually feel this way. However, it is a frustrating topic for many outdoorsmen. We feel that our livelihood is constantly under pressure by some people's silly notion that we kill/hurt for fun. We're all a bunch of backwards hillbillies that refuse to accept tofu as meat.

BreezyPoint started a thoughtful thread in the Strictly Fishing forum that has only gotten three responses so far. Not surprisingly, this much more inflammatory thread has gotten more than ten times the responses, not much thought but lots of responses. It's a sad reflection of our society that the majority of people would rather fan the flames of discord than face the obvious ethical questions of their own behavior and rationally explain the ethics of what they do. Maybe those of you who can actually explain what you do and why you do it, how it affects the resource, how you feel you stay within the regulations of whichever Province or State you happen to be in, or any of the above would like to respond in Breezy's thread.

We are fishermen, mostly walleye fisherman. We love our sport and most have a consideration for the resource we enjoy and treat it in a way that will preserve it for our kids to enjoy. Speaking for myself, I treat my catch with respect and get them back into their environment with minimal stress, or I bop'em on the head and eat them later. We don't gig spawners or drop explosives on fish. I don't consider this a troll. Just a friendly banter about how we view our bloodlust in the world of sportfishing."

Otters eat their prey alive, so do lots of other animals. I like to flatter myself by thinking I'm better than that.

IF my fishing and thus handling of my catch and release fish eventually kills some of them then that is unfortunate(I hope it is not as high as some have suggested) BUT I am on the higher end of the food chain! If I was on the lower end of the food chain I would hope that the ""ones"" above me would have the same type respect. If they were only doing it for ""sport/entertainment"" than so be it.

We pollute and kill tens of thousands of fish and other higher creatures, birds, dolphins, etc. Gill nets, traps and other means of capture give no opportunity for release.

She stated the fish liked to hang around her dock and was caught about very two weeks. Interesting story about survival.I have seen a musky in a spot and cast the same lure multiple times and not had another follow, but every time I tried a new lure it followed it once and only once. You could make a million if you could figure out their thought processes.Nature is pretty powerful and there are numerous stories of the adaptability and the ability of predators to return to places (like where seals breed) after a year or even ten in the case of the 'outback pelicans' in Australia.Frank"

I try very hard to minimize my impact on them by releasing in the water and only taking pictures on rare occasions. Fish that I keep, I usually kill immediately and put on ice. That is the best I can do.Fish are very different than other animals. Outside of aquariums, the only way we can really enjoy them is to catch them.

They like it ‘cause many times they come back for more. Try as I might, I cannot catch them all. Therefore some fish feel left out. “Why not me?” they ask. This contributes to low self- esteem issues in many a walleye. Physically, the walleye who had my jigbling in its mouth felt no pain. They are fish and do not experience pain as mammals do. Nope. Not the same. They may sense pressure, but not discomfort or emotions as we do. Read all about it: medulla oblongata. That may help cure personification."
2879809,Gregking,2014-06-09 07:36:00,2658,"Intent is correct. I see it a different way, my intentions are to catch fish and put food on my table. I do not want to harvest a 30"" or even for that matter a 20"". I will stick with 15-19"" and my family is happy. My intent is to return the big females back to breed. My intent on coyotes, skunks, coons and foxes is to kill them all. Non will be returned to the wild with .223 flying at them. Unless I miss Good debate though, I see your point."
2879857,MrSimon,2014-06-09 07:46:00,922,"Phish, I understand your question. And I've thought about it too. Yes, what we do to fish causes them nothing but pain, harm, confusion, disruption, and death. And yes, similar treatment to warm furry mammals could lead to jail time. But, lets be very very clear about this, fishing isn't about the fish, its about the fisherman. We do this because its fun and we enjoy it. That's it, end of story. But, there is a line that fisherman understand. We hurt fish for fun, but we should only hurt them enough to get our fun out of it .... then let them go. No need to be excessive. I suppose this sounds horrible and cruel, but its the truth. And fisherman understand. We are perfectly fine with yanking them out of the water with barbed hooks .... but then we hold them gently and reverently and scream at folks who keep them out of the water for an extra 30 seconds. Is this hypocritical? Personally I don't think so. But the reasons get into religious discussions that I don't really fit on a fishing forum. Now stop thinking about this and just go catch some fish."
2879865,Aaron-IN,2014-06-09 07:46:00,500,I've abused and will continue to abuse Fish for as long as I can.
2879913,LOW1,2014-06-09 07:58:00,2828,"I think that this post and Obabikon's earlier post best identify the issue. If fish are capable of feeling pain in the way mammals feel pain, catch and release fishing, and any other fishing besides humane subsistence fishing, is as morally indefensible as bullfights and dog fighting."
2879929,NickDalasio,2014-06-09 07:59:00,34,"I don't believe fish actually feel pain, maybe someone else here knows for sure. Years ago, people kept everything they caught, so I don't think that's abuse, other than the fish dying from lack of oxygen. But if you want to keep your catch, that's just how it goes in the world of carnivores/omnivores, you've got to kill your dinner somehow, unless you plan to swallow it while alive.We now know that keeping everything you catch is bad conservation, so anything over or under the slot limit goes back. Most of these fish survive, and if they don't feel pain (as I believe), I don't know how this constitutes abuse.Anyway, I hate golf, and could care less about the overpaid thugs we call ""athletes"" chasing a ball around. So, hunting & fishing it will be for me."
2879993,kzoofisher,2014-06-09 08:10:00,5144,"I think phish has taken this to a bit of an extreme for the sake of argument. In Switzerland (I think) catch and release is not allowed. You catch a fish, keep it and when you reach you're limit you're done. My feeling is that not taking reasonable efforts to care for your catch is unethical. If you handle fish roughly and release them, let them spoil on a stringer or freezer burn them etc you have been unethical. Things happen that we can't control, like swallowed hooks and hooked gills. Making efforts to minimize my impact beyond what I intend is what I call ethical."
2880065,tooski,2014-06-09 08:30:00,393,"Just to add - was going to post in the previous argument but this topic seems fine for it-- the reply from Will Wegman of the MNR, Aurora district. As in most things that are arguable, it leaves openings.. No easy answer without taking several factors into consideration and failing any papers that I am aware of on this subject it really is hard to quantify. I's say for sure(from personal experience anyway and some walleye research I did on Nipissing) that cold water conditions slow the fishes metabolism down and therefore stress levels are minimized- so possibly they can stay out of the water for a bit longer if it's not super cold out and chance of fish freezing. My gut reaction is 1 ½ minutes under most summertime conditions is too long of a period. Walleye (a cool water species) can be more susceptible than largemouth and other warm water species. For good, healthy release with highest expectations of long term survival I try NOT to exceed 30 seconds having camera, pliers ready, etc"
2880337,SinOrSwim,2014-06-09 09:50:00,1528,"I have to admit, this made me LOL. I was picturing him actually having a meeting with his dog and the dog hanging his head and nodding yes. What is worse keeping a fish out of the water for a couple minutes or putting a live fish from the live well on a board and sticking a knife in its side and cutting half of it off?????"
2880393,v-bay gord,2014-06-09 10:10:00,3168,"the intent of one is to provide necessary sustenance - the intent of the other is entertainment at the expense of another living thing. a huge difference - at least to me. phsih You're assumption is the fish has a higher morality in it's actions. You don't know if fish just enjoy killing other fish just for the fun.....whether they eat them or not. Cats seem to do this. On the other hand, acts of enjoyment are nourishing to ones inner health... Maybe the difference isn't as huge as you think...."
2880481,Jimmy Jig,2014-06-09 10:51:00,1905,"Here's an idea, take all the hooks off the plugs. Everytime a fish hits it, call it a quick release. When you have your limit go home and see lettuce or some other vegge."
2879393,phishfearme,2014-06-09 05:09:00,1242,"In a previous thread titled 30 inch walleye, first cast, there was a debate about the techniques used by the angler and the associated ethics; Was the fish kept out of water too long just to take some photos and weigh it? Would it survive?, etc. One poster suggested to take the debate to another thread  a good point so here goes. Something to consider: If you see someone in your neighborhood live trap an animal, let it beat itself up in the trap, then attempt to drown it, only to let it go after a while  you may consider this a sadomasochistic tendency and maybe even be tempted to call the police. But if you see someone stick a barbed hook into a fish's mouth, totally exhaust it, let it thrash around in the bottom of the boat, hold it up for photos, weigh it and finally let it go - then do it again and again  well, that's just angling. Is one example really different from the other? Does it really matter that it's a fish versus a mammal? Aren't they both just examples of catch and release?  or examples of animal abuse  or torture? To me it's hard to really see any real difference. So, how can I  or anyone on this board  justify what we do to the many fish that we catch and release (torture?) on our trips? I don't really have a good answer - there's just something in my male ego that makes me want to - and enjoy - catching fish (it is probably innate). hunting is probably the same but shoot and release just doesn't compute. I think what all of us need to do though is to first recognize that we are indeed abusing these animals no matter how fast we catch and return them to the water and to do everything possible to minimize the impact on each and every fish we catch - and, here's a novel thought - maybe MINIMIZE the number of fish we catch rather than maximize??? phish"

2879425,v-bay gord,2014-06-09 05:36:00,3168,"Well, the fish is actually attacking your lure / bait with the intention of killing and eating it. I don't see a moral or ethical dilemma in angling. I do think improper handling of a fish you plan to release (or eat for that matter) is bordering on unethical or cruel."
2879441,Freytown,2014-06-09 05:43:00,770,"Phishfearme, man has been harvesting fish and game for eon's. When the day arrives that I feel that I am abusing these fish and game ...I'll join PETA and take up golf."
2879489,Obabikon,2014-06-09 06:04:00,2370,"That is a stretch (in my opinion). One could also argue that we needlessly harm grass by cutting it... simply because humans think it looks nicer. We spray chemicals on weeds so they die. We put little pieces of cheese in mouse traps because we don't like them. Humans cause damage to nature every single day. They build houses and roads. They destroy animal's homes and habitats for the sake of progress. The smallest of all the tragedies is hurting a fish for fun. Also, comparing warm blooded animals to a cold blooded fish isn't correct either. Intelligence and pain levels are completely different. Most studies show that fish do not feel pain, at least not in the way mammals do."

2879537,phishfearme,2014-06-09 06:26:00,1242,It has very much to do with intent - functional or sustenance needs seem quite a bit more justified than entertainment at the expense of another living thing. what does the animal's blood temperature or their level of intelligence have to do with anything? phish
2879617,nitrodude,2014-06-09 06:51:00,60,"Respectfully, a refresher course in biology or a collegiate semester of ichthyology would help your understanding immensely. Comparing land based animals to fish in your analogy presented is a textbook apples v. oranges, if ever there was one. Pain receptors, ganglia opposed to brain mass, nerve transfer, ... the list goes on. Might as well compare swatting a fly to curing a bacterial infection when trying to put values of life to lesser forms."
