2895449,55walleyes,2014-06-13 18:03:00,131,Heading back to Blackstone in early July. Anybody out there have any spots they would like to share. We have done pretty well in past trips. Quality of the walleye has been very good but have not been able to get the numbers that we used to catch at previous outpost. Any info would be appreciated.
