The bait is passing by the walleye, such that the walleye has to decide whether to bite or not. The fish is obligated to make a quick decision as the bait will be gone in a few moments. In your estimation, would this bait work when vertical jigging? In this scenario, the bait is a more vertical presentation, such that the walleye has more time to study it before deciding whether to bite or not bite. Thanks in advance for your perspective!! I'm always looking for sound alternatives to 50 cent minnows."
2887433,Carnhzkr,2014-06-11 09:05:00,964,I would think this would work very well with a spinner rig. I'll have to give it a try. It'd be really easy to take into a fly-in since it wouldn't add much weight. Would be a good alternative if you ran out of minnows/leeches/crawlers.
2887497,Carnhzkr,2014-06-11 09:15:00,964,I know it works well for these guys.

I'm always looking for sound alternatives to 50 cent minnows.In the 2 days I used this bait, my brother and I were fishing under a major jnflux falls in a vortex. I was pitching the shoreline and my brother was using more of a vertical presentation fishing a strong moving eddy. We would be bummed if we didn't have a double going. It was pretty fast and furious. The other 3 boats were vertical jigging exclusively. Everyone in my group was sold on it. I don't know, maybe we were just lucky. I could probably cut up my muck boots in the shape of a gullet and catch fish here. Quote: Originally Posted by CarnhzkrI would think this would work very well with a spinner rig.

2882249,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-09 19:16:00,1460,"This year, we brought in a Beef Heart to use as bait. Spent about 4 dollars for a split heart and sliced it into little strips. I would then sculpt the little strips to look and act like a gullet. In my future, I'll be cutting down on live bait Killer bait."
2882337,yoopertrout,2014-06-09 19:59:00,1172,Great idea! You should change your handle to Captain Beefheart.
2882377,pikeandtina,2014-06-09 20:10:00,145,Great idea!
2883089,tooski,2014-06-10 06:16:00,393,"Maybe I didn't spend enough time sculpting it but I took some into a Nakina area lake a few years ago with mixed results. Plastics seemed to work just as well then. I was hoping the hearts would be a better alternative. Glad to hear you did well with them, I'll give it another shot. Time to call the butcher."
2883969,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-10 10:00:00,1460,"My entire group using them on our last 2 days with great success and made believers outta all of us. I know that I was pretty skeptical and I would occasionally switch back to leech or crawler, but the beef heart was at the very least equal. You know, with the price of minnows @ .50 ea and a tiny slip of beef heart less than a penny, it made sense to give er a try and I'm glad we did. I also felt it was important to sculpt these strips down to about an inch long and thin as I could shaped like a walleye gullet. I'd put it on my hook and give it a quick dunk in Gulp Alive juice."
2884281,FuzzzyIL,2014-06-10 11:37:00,2326,PikeHow long did a strip last? How many bites? Fish caught per strip.Very intrigued by this idea. Did you guys just keep it on ice or in the freeze? Slice off what you needed for the day? How do you keep it in the boat all day?
2884425,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-10 12:26:00,1460,"Like I said, we brought up a half heart for less than 4 bucks and I threw it in with the frozen goods till I offloaded at camp and just threw it in the fridge. Gotta confess, I forgot about it till I uncovered it in the fridge mid week. We just used it for the last 2 days so we had more than plenty for the 8 of us. The first day we used it, my brother cut it into strips at breakfast and divied it up into ziplock bags for each boat. I cut the rest up on our last day so I cut the entire remaining portion being careful to trim any fat but leaving any membrane I found and we would keep it in our boat coolers. I wondered though, if treating it more like a chicken liver catfish bait and leaving it out in the sun might be a way to go as well. My brother and I used a little tupperware container with a lid and we brined it with some garlic salt. As far as your first question, I would say it lasted and caught as many fish as a leech, so not that many, but it would really last longer if you had a piece with some membrane to hook through. Very pertinent questions Fuzzy, cutting right through to the heart of the matter."
2884593,tooski,2014-06-10 13:20:00,393,I know I'm pushing the envelope a bit since you have already answered multiple questions but as I said I was not successful a few years back and almost certainly because i kinda just chopped them up and stuck them on a hook. Any chance you have any pix on the final look?
2884721,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-10 13:39:00,1460,"I wish I did. The best I can do is to describe the sculpting better. The strips we cut were about 4"" long and about 1/4"" wide 1/8"" thick. I cut my strips in thirds so I had a little chunk about 1 1/2"" long. I would then split up 1""-1 1/4"" to the top and V out the ends a bit. Just make it look like a gullet. I spent very little time doing this. Good Luck"
2887305,Bowtech84,2014-06-11 08:30:00,572,"Sounds like a good idea, I wonder if beef spleen would work cut it strips as you describe. You would have no problem keeping spleen on your hook for long periods of time.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
