2896745,geomax,2014-06-14 09:26:00,29,"Fished Minnitaki June 5, 6, 7, and 8. Good walleye fishing in post spawn conditions given you were hitting the right spots, fish were just moving out of the spawning grounds out to the river mouths and shallow bays. Action was intermittent around the lake but in the right spots if was good for bigger fish. lots of nice 21-26 inch fish to be had each day in the shallows at 6-12 feet. Otherwise the chutes were hitting slots hard at 18-21 inches. Fishing seemed best up until about 1030am and then would go quiet for the mid-day hours. I did not fish in the evening.Water is as high as I have ever seen it as well as many long time residents, not much to worry about on the bottom end of the motor for rocks but could be a year to develop poor driving habits that will get you in the long run, so be aware. Floating debris is common, if you run a big boat and clip along you better not take your eyes off the water. No shortage of logs, branches, and deadheads.Otherwise you should be moving into very good summer fishing as they will start to be in all the regular humps and narrows. Mosquitos were starting to get quite active, and I did also see a few May flies. Your gonna have a great trip but just thought I would share my thoughts from last week.Enjoy your time, Minnitaki is a top fishery right now and has been well managed for the enthusiasts in my opinion.JCM"
