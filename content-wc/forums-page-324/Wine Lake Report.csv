An uneventful trip to the portage with the Iowa boys to help us pull our boat over the falls. The advice was to empty the boat but the Iowa boys would have none of that so we pulled them over full. good call Iowa boys! After finding that we were fortunate enough to have the Wolf Cabin for just the two of us, we celebrated and toasted the good fortune. We were on the water shortly after noon and headed to our favorite spot on Beaver Lake. As usual, we tore into them quickly. We also were happy to see that our artificial bait, primarily walleye assassins, work as well or better than minnows. We tore into the hungry pre spawn walleyes and had boated over 120 fish by Sunday after noon. A few random snakes but primarily walleyes. We had trouble finding some under 18"". The walleye eventually slowed down through the week, picking up a bit by Friday, but fortunately for us the trout began to move in low. Doc, who likes to consider himself the ""Trout Master"" managed to pull in 5 of them, largest at 29.5 inches. We ran into some smallies, most of them young, but I got the biggest at 16.5"". We also hit some big pike as usual, with Doc pulling in one at 38"" and me at 36.5 I also caught two more over 30"". We kept a counter on the boat and had 338 pulled in the boat by mid day Friday. It was a very good week and if we hadn't spend a couple days trolling for trout I think we would have hit 400 no problem. Now we get back into our routine for the summer and look forward to our Fall trip to Canyon Lake (fist time for us). Fish on! Hooks"

2855537,ILScott,2014-06-01 18:59:00,139,"It looks like you had a good week. I really like the place and I agree with you that you could catch many more walleye. I get in the mind set when I am there to catch walleye then spend time working for lakers, which takes away from the amount of walleye you can catch."
2865233,TinCann,2014-06-04 07:35:00,8,Hey Hooks Thanks for report - Hope water and trout stay up for us were going in 6/14 - Wolf Cabin looks pretty sweet I haven't tried that one yet - Portage was probably to high and fast to fish effectively - Any luck in Mud or Ghost ?
2868601,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-05 05:18:00,725,"Hey Cann, good luck in mid June, you should clean up on the walleye by then. Of course you know Beaver will be the big producer. We didn't go there, but most people got their trout in the portage falls. They were just starting to come up in Dynamite and what we call the Trout run which is the south shore going in to the Cedar River. We also did not go to mud or Ghost. Ghost is usually behind the rest of the system since the water is so clear, but we did hear from the Iowa boys that they caught a bunch in there. Mud is also a good producer early, but we only seem to catch little guys in there, so we did not go there. We did real well in TurnAround, catching good size walleyes consistently and I caught the big pike there. Smallies are now everywhere as we caught them in Beaver and TurnAround as well as at the Anishinabi Falls. Wolf Cabin is by far our favorite cabin with the deck extending out over the water and the new everything. Solar lights are nice so we dont have to screw with those Coleman lanterns. I have nearly blown myself up several times throughout the years. Say hello to Ann and Herb. If you follow Ann's blog you can see my BIL and I as the winners of the fishing tournament that week. Tight lines! Fish ON! Hooks"

Impressive 38"" pike held in a most awkward position unlike your picture with your face framed in the center of your 36 1/2""er. Well done Hooks! Very cool fish house photo also, what did you do since last year, lose like 50 pounds. You almost look, dare I say, handsome. Lol"
2891161,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-12 10:34:00,725,"Actually, I did lose about 30. Holding for now but would like to loser another 30. Thanks for noticing! Now, I did put 5 lbs. on that week, but boy is that walleye and potato/onion fryup good! Now if we could luck into some PikeSlayer specialty say like walleye cerviche, now that would be awesome!"
