2887073,fishingfever,2014-06-11 07:24:00,85,Does anyone know if nightcrawlers packed in red humus are legal to take across the border to Ontario? The only ones I can find locally (Iowa) say they are a Product of Canada and are packed in red humus. It looks like black dirt. No point telling me they're from Canada so it should be OK. I would agree with that but I'd like to know if anybody actually knows if it's legal. TIA.

That is not allowed to cross the border because the concern is microorganisms that are in the organic component of soil. The lady at the local bait shop always laughs at the irony of getting the crawlers from Canada in soil from Canada, then for crawlers going back home to Canada she has to wash off the soil and put in bedding."

It's not any different than buying our fruit in the states then if we don't consume it all while we are in Canada we can't bring it back into the states. The custom guys don't know the source of the worm bedding or the fruit so it is a blanket ""keep it out"".Seems illogical to us, but in the big scheme of things it is the right thing to do. It's in the best interest of everyone. Huge case in point is the Asian carp mess on the Illinois river or the Kudza plant that has taken over the southern states. Both are invasives brought in by accident or design that have wreaked havoc with the ecosystems.Some of the worm/bedding, potato and leech restrictions seem to have been brought upon us by politics. Maybe not, but.....Pooch"
