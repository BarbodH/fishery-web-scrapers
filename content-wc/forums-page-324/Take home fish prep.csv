2895505,elway12,2014-06-13 18:31:00,335,Opps...good catch lassh. We thaw them first! I will edit previous post. Have had no ill effects with the taste of the fish we actually think it helps cut down on freezer burn etc.
2891969,retire55,2014-06-12 15:01:00,1029,"I'd have reservations about duct taping the cooler shut because I read the following about using dry ice:""Store dry ice in a cooler â€“ proper storage of dry ice is to place it in an insulated cooler with the lid loosely closed. Make sure the lid is loose and do NOT use an airtight container, like we recommend for food, because the build up of carbon dioxide gases as the dry ice subliminates could cause the container to burst and send sharp pieces of plastic flying in all directions""."
2891985,Carnhzkr,2014-06-12 15:04:00,964,Ziplock makes these special bags that come with a hand-pump vacuum sealer. I've been impressed with them. You put the pump over a one-way valve in the bag and pump to suck out air and water. Seems to me that these work even better than the cheapie electric sealer I've used before.

2892465,eyemike,2014-06-12 17:49:00,233,Half a dozen blue ice on top and bottom of the sealed fillets has always kept our fish frozen.
2892537,elway12,2014-06-12 18:18:00,335,"We do about the same as port1042. We leave the skin on one side of the fillets(to be taken off AFTER we thaw them at home) then we put them into plastic bags, then we wrap & tape(masking or duct) them in 4-5 layers of newspaper, then they go into ziplock bags, (to keep them dry) and place them on the bottom of the cooler. The cooler is then closed and never opened until we're home. We have a 14 hour drive & flight home. Sometimes the fillets get somewhat soft but not all the way thru. We just make sure to get them in the deep freeze as soon as possible. We too never open the cooler. Of course we are taking a risk of having to cut open the newspaper if we ever get inspected but never have in 5 trips north. I think between the newspaper, leaving the skin on, and a deep freeze to start(in camp) is the key for long travel storage and preservation."
2892545,Guest,2014-06-12 18:19:00,0,"We usually get a chunk of dry ice the evening before we leave and put it in the freezer in the cabin. No sport shop is open at 3 am. When it comes time to leave, we put the fish and anything else that should stay frozen in the bottom of the cooler. The dry ice is the highest item in the cooler because cold always goes down. We stopped at the Four Seasons Sport shop in Ear Falls and her calculation on size of the chunk is determined by how far you have to travel. We usually get a 4 lb piece and after driving 16 hours and opening the cooler at home, the chunk of dry ice is about the size of a deck of cards."
2892937,lunker99,2014-06-12 20:38:00,236,We used to freeze during the week to bring home but seemed like the fillets took on a fishy taste from being froze with the skin on. Now keep what we're going to bring home the last couple of days and keep fresh on ice/ice blocks on the way home. Take skin off once we get home.
2893649,stevensinks,2014-06-13 07:27:00,330,"We don't bring fish home. But lots of times I have kept meat frozen for 3 or 4 days by wrapping in several layers of news paper, putting it in a good cooler that fits the amount of meat I have and then not opening the cooler. I don't use any ice at all."
2893833,lassh,2014-06-13 08:14:00,553,How do you take the skin off before the fish is thawed?
2894721,Bitinlight,2014-06-13 12:31:00,95,"Vacuum seal and freeze fish fillets. Place frozen fillets in bottom of cooler with as many frozen milk jugs on top as you can get in. Fillets are still frozen solid after 10 hour trip home. Also, if you can, put cooler in a freezer, if you have one available, the night before you are leaving. Adds to the hours of keeping fish frozen."
2891497,Carnhzkr,2014-06-12 12:30:00,964,"I'm looking for opinions on the best way to prep your take-home fish. I used to put my take-home fish in baggies and freeze them the night before the trip home. I'd put the frozen fillets at the bottom of a cooler covered with ice cubes. By the time I get to a hotel and put them back into a freezer 10 - 12 hours later, the fillets are always pretty soft. Last year, instead of freezing the fish only to have them thaw during transport, I just kept them in the refrigerator and put them on ice for the trip home. I'd freeze them as soon as I got to my destination. Using this method, I'd catch the fish on Friday and they wouldn't hit the freezer until mid-day Sunday.I don't like keeping fresh fillets chilled for a couple of days, but I think that's better than freezing, thawing, and refreezing."
2891601,jiggster,2014-06-12 13:00:00,183,"I have used ice and rock salt for ice cream. layer a inch of ice, then some salt, then fillets, repeating the procedure . I put the fillets in thawed, and they froze and stayed frozen for the next two days till I got home. I have had it work for at least for days. I also put a styrofoam piece on the top to insulate further. It is recommended to put wood slats on the bottom of the cooler first."
2891625,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-12 13:03:00,1460,"Freeze them and when you get back to the border, stop by Border Bob's or Sportsmans Service for a little dry ice."
2891681,wallydave,2014-06-12 13:25:00,2151,"If you are coming from Red Lake/Ear Falls area, Dutchies on the 105 sells dry ice too!"
2891745,JayM5209,2014-06-12 13:47:00,1050,"Yes, support the Iowa gals at Dutchies! And, Eagle Junction, midway between Vermilion Bay and Dryden has dry ice.We have access to freezer space in camp so any take home fish get filleted, vacuum packed, and frozen at the end of the day. When leaving for home we put them in a freezer(s) - in plastic garbage bags sorted by whose they are - stop for dry ice at the 1st place, then fill any empty space with crumpled newspaper and duct tape the cooler shut. Fourteen hours later they're hard as rocks."
2891785,Carnhzkr,2014-06-12 13:59:00,964,"I've never thought about using rock salt. I can see how that would keep 'em frozen, but I'd also think it would melt the ice. Sure woks for making ice cream.I've looked into buying dry ice a couple of times, but it has always proven to be too cost-prohibitive for me. Dry ice is out. Maybe if you had 20 fillets, but in my case, I usually have only 4 or 6.Just wondering if it's best to keep 'em thawed and freeze once after you get home, or freeze/thaw/refreeze."
2891825,port1042,2014-06-12 14:23:00,509,"My fillets are also frozen at the lodge so I only need to get them home. I put a layer or so of ice cubes in the bottom of a cooler. The frozen fillets are put in a garbage bag (to keep them dry) and placed on top of the ice. Another layer of ice, then the stuff from the refrigerator we are taking home along with a few ""freezer packs"", again in a garbage bag. The cooler is then closed and never opened until we're home. I have a 12 hour drive and we sometimes stop for the night. When I get home -- I not only still have ice cubes, but the fillets are solid as a rock. I use a good, but not really expensive, cooler. It's just an old Igloo (plastic). I think the trick might be never opening the cooler and stowing it out of sunlight (bottom of pile). I thought about using dry ice but I just never had a problem."
2891913,curt1321,2014-06-12 14:51:00,16,"We have had good luck taking along a small vacuum sealer and then packing them in ice in the cooler. Unless you don't have any access to power, a food saver sealer works great. We have used it multiple times on fishing trips up north. It has worked for some very long drives and the fish doesn't turn to mush. Just remember to be able to identify the fish if regulations require it. Good luck. Curt"
2891929,btyreprich,2014-06-12 14:55:00,1067,"We clean & freeze our fish throughout the week.Early morning departure will have me place the fillets in a Coleman Extreme Cooler with various frozen Gatorade bottles and blue ice packs.We will also stop at Border Bobs in International Falls to buy our dry ice. There always seems to be someone passing out coupons for dry ice just before you cross the border.One things for sure - we no longer buy the amount of dry ice Border Bob suggests. In past years, we'd have too much dry ice left over when we got back home. Yes we did tell the employee we'd be driving straight home and he could see we have a better quality cooler. I'd buy like $8.00 or so of dry ice and it was more than enough.Then again if we had car problems on the ride home, I guess a delay could cost us our fillets."
2891961,Carnhzkr,2014-06-12 15:01:00,964,"Maybe that's the solution. When I've checked into buying dry ice before, I always went by the chart that indicates how many pounds of dry ice is needed for the size of cooler and it always came out to be like $20 - $30 which I decided is way too much for the few fillets I'm bringing home. Maybe you can get by with a fourth of what the chart says."
