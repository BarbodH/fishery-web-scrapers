2889393,forgop,2014-06-11 19:35:00,880,"I've never fished much out of a boat and last year I only used cranks and spoons. Jigs have never been part of my tackle box fishing from a bank or wading. This year I've purchased a couple of kits and looking for the best info available on how to use them fishing in the outpost lakes of Canada. Where would you start trying to educate yourself on how to best use them as I assume there's different ways to retrieve them, rigging them, etc. TIA."
2889433,BornToFish,2014-06-11 19:57:00,1224,"You are asking a very open ended question. Readers could take your question in many directions. That said, if I could only take two lures with me to fish for walleyes in NW Ontario, they would both be jigs. I offer two general ""rules of thumb"". First, always use the lightest jig that allows you to reliably feel bottom. The weight of the jig can change depending upon considerations such as depth, wave action and current. Second, tie your line directly to the jig with out a snap, swivel or leader. Jigs are generally used with some sort of attractant, such as rubber (e.g. twister tails), GULP type bait or live bait. Experience has shown me that most any bait will work with a horizontal presentation (e.g. casting and retrieving) as the fish must either strike the lure or pass, as it will be gone before too long. I've consistently done much better with live bait when using a vertical presentation. The fish seem to study the lure longer and have time to decide whether or not to bite. For me, color of jig usually doesn't make much difference. There are days when a particular color does better than all others. I would use gold glitter if I could only use one color. Jigs tend to come up in the water column with a corkscrew motion. They tend to fall straight. The corkscrew motion usually results in considerable line twist. You can immensely simplify your life by putting a small swivel at the end of your line. I use a 15-18 inch long, six pound fluorocarbon leader between the swivel and the jig. I hope the above information gets you started. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2889457,yoopertrout,2014-06-11 20:02:00,1172,"I'm far from an expert. I've fished for years for trout, panfish etc. I've walleye fished occasionally over the years, but only really gotten into it more in the last few years. So, maybe my beginner status will help me to explain it to another beginner. What I've learned: 1. Despite the term ""jigging"", often they don't want it jigged, but just slowly reeled across the bottom. 2. Have 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8 oz. jigs. Use jigs that are light enough to fish naturally, but heavy enough to stay near the bottom. I use 1/4 most. 3/8 in heavier current, and 1/8 if they won't take 1/4 now. 3. Minnows in spring, leeches in summer. 4. Twister tails, even unscented can work pretty well. 5. Someone else recently posted a cool idea - buy ""bait buttons"", or cut discs of rubber worms and put them on the hook after the bait to help keep for loosing the bait. 6. Flourescent in dark water, more muted colors in clear water, and I've had good luck with white in slightly dirty water (and if ever there were a rule made to be broken, it's this one.) 7. Shallow in the spring, and deeper as summer goes on. I know these are pretty basic hints. I hope they will help. Some of the old pros will probably have some more interesting tips."
2889465,yoopertrout,2014-06-11 20:05:00,1172,"p.s. A rod that has worked well for me, without breaking the bank is a Fenwick Eagle GT 6 1/2 feet in medium action. About $59."
2889945,Gunner_Fletch,2014-06-12 04:36:00,74,"All of the above is right on the money! Two more tidbits of info for the original message: Keep your jig presentation as vertical as possible. This is far more important than the size of the jig. If your line is in the water at 40 degree angle or more, your percentages go down. Lastly....and pretty much related, is ""the bottom"". It's all about maintaining contact with the bottom and about a foot or two above."
2890161,tv4fish,2014-06-12 06:35:00,2694,"forgop: One thing I might add - If you're going to be fishing your jigs in the shield rock part of Canada (as opposed to a mud/muck type bottom), start out slowly with how you drop the jig. If you just release your bail or allow the jig to drop fast down to the bottom, you may find yourself losing a lot of jigs to start with, as you will find the cracks in the rocks with your jig. I would drop it slowly (with an up/down motion) until you hit the bottom and immediately raise it up slightly and then gently raise/lower it to stay close to the bottom, A lot of times the fish will hit it as you lower it. If you are drifting, just continue the up/down presentation (about 6-12"" lifts) as you drift, making contact with the bottom on the drops. A nice sensitive rod helps distinguish when a fish bites."
2891113,wesman40,2014-06-12 10:17:00,45,"I have done very well sitting in deeper water and casting toward shoreline of islands and points and into stump beds and then retrieving 1/4oz jig and twister tail. We often troll with spinners and if we start catching consistently in an area will will back away from shore and cast jigs/twister tail. I lose 20 or more jigs on a 5 day trip using this method, but it is my favorite way to catch em. This method targets aggressive fish and they usually hit hard.My fishing partner does the same thing with and jig and a beetle spin type blade this is a slower fall and often snags a bit less.Good luck!"
2891305,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-12 11:15:00,1006,"Here is my .02 cents.I jig probably 80% of the time I am fishing for walleyes. I personally like the feel of the bottom, and to find that motion that the fish are looking for.When I got to lac seul I last year started using more of a stand up style jig. I believe the brand I have been using are the Lindy stand up jig. I can't say enough about this jig. It keeps the bait up off the bottom a bit instead of lying flat on the bottom. I usually go with the fire tiger size either in 1/4 or 3/8 oz. Even on my home lake by my house I have had a ton more success by just switching to a stand up style jig.Now one other thing that I don't think I see was mentioned was the use of braid line. I fish an 8lb Suffix 832 braid which has a very small diameter. Not only is this stuff tuff, it also makes jigging more sensitive in my opinion.When you do get caught up in a rock I usually have to give it a **** of a yank. Most times I can get it un snagged but when I can't obviously a new jig goes on....big deal. It's why I bring way more jigs than I really need up there haha.When jigging I like to try different motions. Maybe small twitches, or nice snaps (snap jigging). Keep trying different things and sooner or later you'll get a fish. Then remember what you did and repeat it."
