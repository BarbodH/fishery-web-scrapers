1321308,Mike Borger,2011-06-22 09:18:00,1554,"I'm going to say no. Compared to other camps in the Nakina region they're on the low end of the nice scale.BUT, their prices reflect that somewhat.Bottom line they're very basic camps, but you'll be comfortable, not want for anything, and catch tons of fish."
1321313,StOlafDoggie,2011-06-22 09:34:00,1,"Solopaddler: Thank you for your quick, honest appraisal of TLO. My 36 old daughter has never gone on fishing trip, let along to a fly-in to Canada.Knowing her, she will be very willing to put up with some inconviences if the fishing is great. So, will try them out next year. GundertheWonder(nickname with my Norwegian-Swedish friends from St.Olaf College many long years ago)"
1321316,oleJoe,2011-06-22 09:37:00,114,I know they were sold a couple of years ago . He had sold 2 of his lakes to another outfitter out of Nakina before he sold the rest of his operation to a gentleman from Wisc. Which lakes were you interested in? TY
1321388,Guest,2011-06-22 12:13:00,0,Hi olejoe: I am interested in abamasgi and jessiman lakes. Have you had any experience fishisng either of them. St.doggie
1321472,gmattbruin,2011-06-22 16:15:00,174,"not sure if I can help, but we have been with TLO for 10yrs or more now.They did sell their northern lakes off awhile ago.We have fished many, now have settled on Abamasagi,its close,very reasonable,and most important,unbelievable fishing.It has been sold recently, but the same great service is still there,no complaints. Solopaddler is correct though,cabins are bare minimum,boats are 14ft Nadens,Lunds or Smokercrafts,same as most places. We fish approx 10to12 hrs a day and never worry too much abt the cabins. Abamasagi has icehouses for all 3 cabins. We hve found this to be a big bonus. They always have accomadated us in every way and we deal with he small stuff as it comes. Stuff can happen being so far away from civilisation but thats all part of the trip. We are returning in '12 and cant wait!"
1321550,Guest,2011-06-22 20:09:00,0,"It is people like you and thousands of others that use this site freely giving truthfull information to others revealing their experiences at fisihing camps. That is the whole purpose of this site. And it works. Now to the subject at hand: Use of twin lakes outfitters. My daughter and i will ""huddle"" trying to determine whether we will fish abamasagi lake or try our luck, to fish jessiman lake with dad paying more bucks, but what the **** ,that is what money is for. Many thanks gmattbruin. Gunder the half-breed norwegian wonder, from eau claire wisconsin....yep, i have been a packer fan for seventy years since i was nine years old. Never thought at my ripe age i would ever live to enjoy another packers super bowl victory. Wisconsinits by the millions and packers fans all over the usa have been reliving and releshing their miracle championship. It just makes me feel good."

Cabin 3 at Abamasagi is a great cabin to fish out of especially with kids. You are up in the arm of the lake,very protected and safe. This is a big lake and get very mean,fast,we experienced it twice. LOTS of great walleye fishing. The cabin is bare bones but has everything you would need and more,and again I have said before the price is amazing. Good luck with your choices."
