1320467,hawg,2011-06-20 11:14:00,2008,If you spray down your carpet and inside of the boat with that heavy peritherin stuff it really keeps flies from hanging around. Coleman makes one or get the stuff everyone uses for those lady bugs that were so bad a year or so ago. It's the same.
1320475,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-20 11:29:00,66,LOL. Carpet. I have to stand on the boat seat so my feet are level. I don't know what I'd do with carpet.
1320548,doubleheader,2011-06-20 13:43:00,2652,"black flies should be about done soon, skeeters are revving it up. We take the Thermocell units. They work pretty decent. By the time vacation is coming to a close a guy would have more luck begging for money than asking for a Thermocell pad"
1320855,jignminow,2011-06-21 09:43:00,168,"I also like to bring along a Black Flag propane fogger. They don't cost much and I will go out in the morning and walk around the outside of the cabin blasting away. It is also great to do along the dock shoreline and the best is when you decide to do a shore lunch, we will blast the area and wait 5 minutes for the fog to settle. It makes a huge difference on those islands or shores that you can hardly stay on because of the bugs."
1320965,PCW,2011-06-21 14:14:00,7,I use Repel 99.99999% deet but I also take a box of dryer sheets and put them around the boat. They really do work on keeping the ankle biters out.
1321215,jignminow,2011-06-22 06:29:00,168,Does this unit get hot? Can you lay it on the carpet in the middle of the boat? I see that Cabelas is backordered but Amazon and a bunch of others have stock. Steve
1321432,Catman59,2011-06-22 14:00:00,345,Most Walmarts have them in the camping area.
1321505,Legend115,2011-06-22 18:21:00,39,"lol..actually a good bug jacket ""Original Bug jacket"" and a bit of Muskol works great up here in northern Ontario. it doesn't do a darn thing for those pesky deer flies or the kamikaze horse flies, but at least the black flies and mozzies leave you alone. the key is DEET. if it contains DEET, you're good to go!"
1321578,cabin6,2011-06-22 21:03:00,47,The locals swear by Konk spray and it seems to work- a little pricy at $12 cdn per can. I always have some.
1319630,troutwater,2011-06-18 06:22:00,299,"I was wondering what everyone uses when it comes to bug repellant for the black flies and mosquitos up in Canada. The extended forecast looks like it will be pretty hot when I'm up there, so I'm sure the bugs will be bad to. Last time I went when it was that hot the flies were unbearable. I thought about picking up some Bronco and deep woods off, but I'm curious to hear if anyone has any other suggestions."
1319640,TIGHTLINER,2011-06-18 06:57:00,223,I USE SKIN SO SOFT BATH OIL /NOT THE ONE MADE TO REPELL BUGS IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE THE BATH OIL. USE ANYTHING WITH 99% DEET IN IT HOWEVER USE THE SPRAY OR PUMP BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE THE FINISH OFF ANYTHING IT TOUCHES. DO NOT USE IT CLOSE TO RUBBERIZED RAIN GEAR. THE AEROSOL CANS CONTAIN ANYWHERE FROM 27% TO 47% THIS WILL WORK BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP APPLYING IT EVERY SO MANY HOURS. ALSO WEAR BLAZE ORANGE HAT OR COAT IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ATTRACT THE FLIES LIKE OTHER COLORS. I AM SURE OTHERS WILL HAVE LOTS OF THINGS TO OFFER ON THIS ALSO. THIS WORKED FOR ME IN THE PAST.
1319650,elway12,2011-06-18 07:30:00,335,We really like our Therma cell units when the wind is calm. We use Deep Woods Off and it works. As other have said the key is to reapply. I have seen most sprays work if you have just put them on. I like a long sleeved light shirt so I don't have to spray as much area. I take alot of vitamin B and mulit-vitamins. I think that can help. And no Bananas. These ideas/methods have been posted on here/WC at one time or another and have seemed to help. Obviously nothing totally gets rid of them because if you are out in the bush there can be literally billions of biting insects per mile! I also strongly believe in not showering when in camp. I really think it wards off the critters(and humans) as the week progresses. Just my two cents
1319669,phishfearme,2011-06-18 08:01:00,1242,elway is right on about not showering in the bush - it really works - just ask the natives - it was their main strategy to survive the summers. abit smelly and uncomfortable but much better than getting eaten alive. phish
1319691,Muffy,2011-06-18 09:05:00,23,"I live in northwestern Ontario, it can seem like mozzy central. We use deepwoods off or something similiar. We used to get a repellent called makurdies (spelling is wrong I know) It was a white cream that was rubbed on. It used to be the best but can't find it any more. I like to hang the mosquito coils under the dash of the boat in the little screen flats, I think they work very well.About not showering, this works but even if you want to shower with a non-scented hunting soap this will work to. The key is to avoid the perfumey soaps as they imitate the smell of flowers which many species of bugs are naturally attracted to.Bright colors do work but we generally stick with white as some of the other colours can be attractive to bees and hornets depending where you are. White seems to work best for the black flies.This is what I like to doIn the boat: bug spray with a mosquito coil burning (coils good for ankle biters as well)On shore: white long sleeve with bug spray on any bare skin, coil burning, household raid for in the tent, porch or cabin which ever you will be staying in. Generally with the raid we spray in the morning when we leave the tent and then again 1/2 hour or so before bed.Good luck and have fun."
1319739,Swanee,2011-06-18 12:38:00,16,"one of the best things we use is absorbine jr. [knats, noseeums,]"
1320072,Aaron-IN,2011-06-19 13:11:00,500,The best bug repellant I have used in 30 plus years of going up North is 3M's Ultra-thon. Not sure why but it seems to do much better on the black flies.
1320380,jdoaks,2011-06-20 09:04:00,89,I still have 2 cans of 6/12 works better than anything ive found they dont make it anymore somebody said it was bad for you or the enviroment
1320387,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-20 09:20:00,66,"Deep Woods Off. If your lips don't go numb, it won't work."
1320412,jswinter40,2011-06-20 10:09:00,127,"I always take my father-in-law, the flies and bugs really like him and seem to ignore me. Will have a thermacell in the boat along with OFF."
