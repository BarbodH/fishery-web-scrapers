1313017,cody123,2011-05-31 11:38:00,16,"friend from Iowa, his son 20 yrs old got caught with beer while at college--will he have any problems getting into Canada?"
1313061,HighTech,2011-05-31 13:10:00,75,"Generally if your in college and caught WITHOUT beer you would be banned from a lot of places!. As far as the Canadian border goes the problem is related to a DUI or commonly called impared driving. Impared driving in Canada is a Criminal Code Offence. (Not a minor affair) Since DUI is considered a Criminal Offfence, then US citizens who may have had a DUI (anywhere in the US or Canada) are considered to have been charged with a ""criminal"" offence. This is what restricts crossing the boarder. If your friend was charged with DUI then yes he will be questioned at the border. If on the other hand it was simple possession (not driving) then he would not have a problem."
1313074,jswinter40,2011-05-31 13:27:00,127,"I have never heard of ""underage consumption/possession"" being a problem. I had one at 20yo and never been an issue. I don't think it is even on my record when you look things up publically anyway."
1313389,JinxCanada,2011-06-01 08:18:00,1306,underage possession is not an issue. this is not a criminal action.
1313404,Lovetofish,2011-06-01 08:51:00,458,"Jinx, what about underage consumption? Happens a lot in college."
1313442,JinxCanada,2011-06-01 10:20:00,1306,"It is not illegal in Canada to consume alcohol or drugs of any kind at any age. It is only illegal to be in ""possession"" and as far as alcohol goes it's a simple provincial offence. As far as drugs, depends on the drugs but for example marijuana you must have over 30 grams to be charged criminally under the Controlled Drugs & Substances Act."

1321992,JinxCanada,2011-06-24 00:03:00,1306,Well...or possession with intent to traffick
