Monday and the rest of the week we saw cloud cover , east wind, good water chop. caught all the Walleye we wanted and a lot of 23' to 25' fish. Biggest was 28 1/2"". Jig/Minnow and Jig /Crawler both worked great. Did some Smallmouth fishing and did well every time. Biggest Smallie was 19 1/2"" with a lot of them over 17"". Casted for Pike in Bays close to main lake and caught many Pike in the 34"" to 38"". Best lure was in line spinner with gold willow leaf blade char/yellow dressing. Overall numbers were around 1500 fish for week. Mike Kansas"
1320530,jswinter40,2011-06-20 13:01:00,127,Sounds like a blast Mike. We head up in a couple weeks. What general structure and depth did you find your walleye in? water temp? thanks.
1320544,Mike Kansas,2011-06-20 13:32:00,1463,Most of eyes were shallow 6' to 10' and water temps were in the 62/65 range. As always we had best luck on windy points or windy shallow sunken islands. If you going in a couple weeks fish could have moved to a little deeper water. If water temps stay in low 60s shallow could still be good. We go back to Lac Seul the first week in July and we will spend a lot of time fishing mid lake structure in 15' to 20' water. Also large sand flats at that time of year can be great fishing in the 15/20 range. Fish slow and have a great and safe trip. Where are you going to be and what dates? Mike Kansas
1320565,jswinter40,2011-06-20 14:22:00,127,"We take a houseboat out of Hudson (July 9th - 16th), by Lost Island which I believe is where you are going next. We fish in these general boundaries : Bear Narrows to the North, Banana to the South , entrance to Sen Bay to the east and Pine point to the west. I was just curious to the depths and water temps out in the bigger water where you had luck. High 60's and low 70 the fish get going on the humps and points on the main lake structure from what I have experienced. can't wait! Good luck at Lost Island, our group has always talked about staying there because it is such a nice place."
1321967,Gipper,2011-06-23 21:42:00,76,"Hi boys. We normally fish the musky opener at a lake near Perrault Falls and have had similar experience with shallow walleyes at stated water temps....on crankbaits. This year we're going on 9 July instead. Do you know if we're also looking at mid lake humps and such as best bets? On a normal year in this timeframe, do you know what are the best depths to try?"
1322047,Mike Kansas,2011-06-24 07:03:00,1463,"I would definitly spend some time on mid-lake humps during that time of year. Depths down to 20' can hold a lot of fish if there is a hump or structure. Don't give up on the shallow bite some of the eyes will still be holding there too. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1322297,Gipper,2011-06-24 17:00:00,76,Thanks.....we'll see. Can't wait!
