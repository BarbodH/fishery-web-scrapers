1321810,SteveJ715,2011-06-23 13:34:00,59,"We used to go the second week of June pretty religiously. Of course the weather and temperatures can vary wildly from year to year even when you always go the same week. One year I got snowed on twice -- two separate days -- in June. But because of that experience, I was ready for the snow in late May this year.I have some interest in going later in the summer for pike, but my old man loves his walleyes, so it would have to be with another group. My dad's also trying a fall trip to Lac Suel this year -- first time in the fall for him (or me). I'd be open to a fall trip, too, though as someone pointed out, it's nice being able to stay out pretty late on the water in June if the fish are really biting.- Steve"
1322125,nitrodude,2011-06-24 09:55:00,60,"We fish LS out of Deception Landing and also fish Pelican, Abrahms and Minnitaki with an occasional run up the Sturgeon and English Rivers."
1322653,Pooch,2011-06-25 18:10:00,4619,"We fish the same lake two or three trips a year. End of June trip fish are mostly still back in the bays. End of July trip fish are more scattered and on the reefs and points for the most part. End of August they are about anywhere and harder to stay on them.Three trips to the same lake is like fishing three different lakes. Keeps it interesting. Seems the bugs are worst on the end of July trip. June or July fishing is the most consistent for us, but the end of August is a pretty time of the year. The seasons are definitely changing and fall is in the air big time.That said it's nice to go the same time period every year as we've gotten to know the other guests and look forward to seeing them each year. Many years we know nearly everyone in camp and it's always a hoot to joke with them.Pooch"
1322755,bigwalleye1,2011-06-26 07:31:00,2632,"I have two different groups that go one in June with the guys and one in July with my Dad, same weeks each year, and I just keep rolling my deposit over. Next year's reservation is already on the books before I leave camp. Don't EVER want to take a chance and miss out."
1322759,Aaron-IN,2011-06-26 07:37:00,500,"I base my week on when the ice goes out, but unlike most I don't have to have a reservation either so it's easy to do that."
1321501,keek,2011-06-22 18:14:00,1003,When returning to the same body of water do you go the same time every year? I'm looking at moving my week to the end of June next year vs. the 2nd week. It's a combination of factors that has led me to this choice but I am curious as to what others might do.
1321523,MorganMan,2011-06-22 19:02:00,341,"We have always done our trip in late August or early Sept. We have kept it the same for the past 18 years, but nothing in stone. Mostly the same as that time of the year was the best for the core group of guys. We have had many others come a year or two off and on over that time but the core group remained the same. The other thing is you become accustomed to the weather your typically see, but you are only talking about a couple week change so probably not a big deal. Weather and fish patterns, two big variables. Good luck."
1321575,cabin6,2011-06-22 20:57:00,47,"Have gone to the same camp late May, mid June, late Aug, early Sept. Neat to see what it's like in different seasons. Fall trips more laid back (not as many camp guests or traffic) but fishing slower but love those crisp ""early fall"" nights by the woodburner & always enough fish to eat. June= hustle bustle but great fishing, light until 11 pm and many more bugs."
1321612,Ogoki,2011-06-23 04:12:00,291,"Keek, I am thinking the same as you . Went for years the last week of June . Past few trips have been the second week of June . While up there this year I was thinking I liked the last week better and at the end of the week my wife mentioned the same . We only started going the second week as it allowed more time between our June trip and our August bear hunt / fishing trip. Our reasoning is that it seems like the weather is more stable and by then we seem to always find fish in the same places . This June only 2 of our 7 hot spots were good . Fished the same lake 11 times so we are getting to know it . Went on a fly-in out of Pickle Lake May 28 for a week and then flew in out of Armstrong June 11. First week had high winds , rain , snow and cold. Second week had TOO calm of days and HOT . Had better fishing the evenings of the hot , calm days , but I know the lake better also."
1321622,rebs,2011-06-23 05:29:00,7587,we stay with in a three week window for our trips to Oneida Lake
1321638,NemegosendaRiver,2011-06-23 06:31:00,66,It isn't as important for us because we fish a river system and the fish are in the same spots every year. We can go the first of June clear through the beginning of August and we know where the fish will be. We go with what is convenient for everyone for that particular year.
1321653,keek,2011-06-23 07:11:00,1003,If you would ever be up for some tag-a-long company I'd bring my boat out and we could fish Oneida together. I'm still learning that lake as I've only been there 3 times.
1321672,wallydave,2011-06-23 08:04:00,2151,"When I first started to go the Canada, in the late 90's, we would try to hit the NW end of Lac Seul, the week of June 1st. In those days that was the first day the Sanctuary was open, and we would go up river to fish the Rapids, plus it was my boat/cabin buddies b-day, a pretty good way to celebrate! He hurt his back, went back to school and is now a teacher, plus his boys are old enough to make the trip so we wait until school is out, so we hit the road North as soon as we can! Each season, early, mid and late offer different weather, different patterns for fish, and different bug issues, the main thing is we are on the water and away from work."
1321677,nitrodude,2011-06-23 08:23:00,60,"We go the same last week of June through first week of July each year. We always miss 4th of July back home, but we get a beautiful Canada Day in exchange. The fishing and the weather are very cooperative during that time frame, so next week I'm heading back for my annual trip to Lac Seul. I can't wait!!"
1321745,tv4fish,2011-06-23 10:52:00,2694,That's exactly what we've been doing for many years also. What part of Lac Seul do you hit?
