1321434,teddi,2011-06-22 14:00:00,349,new owners next year. camp is being sold this summer. sad to see it happen as it has been in the family for years.
1321436,wallydave,2011-06-22 14:12:00,2151,"Will Dan start to help Andrea more at Goose Bay or is that camp going to be sold? Each year we see improvements to GBC, and we have always been treated very well by Andrea and her staff."
1321437,Mike Kansas,2011-06-22 14:14:00,1463,South Dakota....We stay at Dan's Outpost camp at Black Bay. Been there 25 years started even before Dan took it over. We just fish that area and Mackinze is 30 miles from the outpost. I can tell you we had some great fishing and the Eyes we caught were fat and healthy and a lot of them over slot. Teddi.....Dan said he has an offer to buy and he thinks it may be sold before next year. I hope Dan gets what he wants and enjoys his retirement..he deserves it. We will give the new owner a try but things always change and Dan has us spoiled with his great service and caring attitude. Mike Kansas
1321556,Steve Ediger,2011-06-22 20:19:00,97,I know the potential buyer pretty well and I think he will be more of the same. Dan and his staff run a great camp and I look for that to continue. Steve
