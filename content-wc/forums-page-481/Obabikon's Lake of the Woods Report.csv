Also, a guest caught a nice 50"" musky while pike fishing this week. So, the big ones have been biting. Lots of eating sized walleye too. It's tricky to find that perfect 17.5"" walleye, but they are definately there. Most of the fish have been caught off of reefs still. On another note, the crappie are becoming pretty active. They are probably spawning by now. A little late, but the cold snap slowed our water temp last week."
1315297,pondigger2,2011-06-06 21:28:00,40,how is the water level on the lake this year......thanks
1315340,Obabikon,2011-06-07 05:38:00,2370,"Well, it's probably a little on the high side for this time of year. But not more than a foot or so. Very close to spot on with the maps."
1318029,Obabikon,2011-06-13 21:18:00,2370,"Fishing was tough today, but it's been great the past week or so. Walleyes have been biting on the shorelines. a 14 year old caught a 29"" monster last night... he was so proud that he made his dad come get me from my cabin to tell me. I love it! Lots of big walleyes. The muskies have been very active... (on accident of course)."
1322863,1shooter,2011-06-26 13:31:00,1493,"We just returned from Obabikon 2 days ago after being up there for 6 days. The weather for the most part was ok with most of the days being partly cloudy in the 65-70 degrees range. We had very light rain some days and it was windy at times. The rain was nothing heavy that rain suits couldn't handle. Thursday was sunny and a little warmer too. Fishing: We caught alot of fish in the low 20's with the biggest being 25.5"". Most of the fish we kept were in the 16""-18"" range. The northerns back in Obabikon Lake were biting pretty good too. We didn't land any muskies but had 2 nice follows and one of them had to be in the 50"" plus range. The rest of the camp seemed to be doing well too. For us the walleyes seemed to be biting in the 8'-12' range. Between the 3 boats we used either jigs or bottom bouncers with spiiners. The hot color seemed to be orange. As far as bait, 2 of the boats used strictly crawlers and in ours it was split between crawlers and minnow. They seemed to work equally well. Thanks Jared!"

Went bass fishing last night and gathered quite a few water temps.... for the most part, water temps in the big lake are running around 56-57 degrees. Thompson's Creek in Myles Bay is a whopping 66 degrees in the back. I assume that means the crappies are spawning. Today's weather is supposed to be pretty nice with PM showers. I'd anticipate the temps to continue to increase. Water temperatures in Obabikon Lake, as expected were a little warmer, running around 61-62 degrees. Fishing wise... only fished for an hour and a half... just boated three nice bass and a pike."
1309299,Lazy Fisherman,2011-05-20 08:17:00,276,Looking forward to your reports. Thanks for posting.
1309320,hawks_rule,2011-05-20 08:53:00,115,"Thanks for the update, I look forward to your future posts."
1309351,@Lunker,2011-05-20 09:47:00,835,"OK, you're on the hook now (no pun intended) for more frequent reports. Thanks."
1309809,Obabikon,2011-05-21 19:38:00,2370,"Pretty nasty for opener. Cool and wet. I'm not sure it stopped raining for moe than 5 minutes the entire day. Fishing was slow. Pike were going crazy up in Obabikon Lake... but the Walleyes this morning were difficult. Most were caught from 10-14 feet deep. Everyone caught enough to eat lunch though... even if they had to cook on propane. Weather: Wind out of the east from 15-20 mph, cool and steady rain the entire day. Report: Tough Day"
1309835,Moondog,2011-05-21 21:09:00,362,Same here on Gullrock........caught males in 8-14ft on an 50-50mix of leeches and minnows. Did get plenty tho! How did the water warm up that fast???
1309908,stillangling,2011-05-22 07:18:00,149,Temperatures are all over the map. 56 F out in the middle of Ptarmigan Bay on Friday but up as high as 61 F in some of the back bays. Bass were chomping in the warmest water. Water temps came up fast because we had warm weather with very little wind. Will be a narrow band of warm water near the surface. Fished the Winnipeg River yesterday and the temp was only 49 F near Kenora. Walleye will still be right in the middle of spawning at that temperature. Fish were not in the usual spots. Ended up doing well between 21 and 24 feet. Almost every fish was right in the middle of the slot.
1309919,steve.a,2011-05-22 07:57:00,274,What slot are you refering to?
1310241,1shooter,2011-05-23 09:10:00,1493,"thanks for the report...cant wait untill we get up there on 6/18. Jared, will you have the hot tub on the deck of the Ice House by the time we get up there?"
1311767,Obabikon,2011-05-26 21:45:00,2370,"hahaha... the ""hot tub"" is right in front of the porch. There's some docks and boats floating in it... and it's warming up towards 60 degrees lately. Fishing's been great the past couple of days. Lots of 20+ inchers. The walleyes have definately moved out to the reefs. Today almost all of the fish caught were on the tops of 10 foot humps."
