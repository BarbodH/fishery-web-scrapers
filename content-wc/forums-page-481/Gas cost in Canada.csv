1322277,Walleye_Guru,2011-06-24 16:08:00,62,Remember to bring fuel treatment with you or check with your outfitter to ensure they aren't selling you low grade fuel with ethanol. The detergents and ethanol mixtures are brutal on marine engines
1316006,cast_and_blast,2011-06-08 13:35:00,1098,Gas at the dock in Redgut Bay of Rainy Lake (Ontario) was $5.75 per gallon after conversion to US dollars and from Imperial Gallon to US Gallon. This was the end of May. Scott

1316033,Filet Knife,2011-06-08 14:22:00,41,"What lodge are you going that gives you 30 gallon package, sounds like a good deal this year especially."

1316073,teddi,2011-06-08 16:32:00,349,also evergreen and gold eagle in ear falls have gas in their package.
1316075,WalleyeWally28,2011-06-08 16:34:00,298,We get 30 gallons with our package at Whitewing near Ear Falls.
1316772,LOW1,2011-06-10 08:58:00,2828,Yesterday I received the bill for the gas our marina on Lake of the Woods charged for the boat gas for my trip there last week. Gas at the marina was 1.47 cdn per litre. Stations off the lake between Fort Frances and Kenora were uniformly charging 1.35 cdn per litre. Gas prices here have dropped about 25 cents per gallon in the last week and hopefully this trend will spread to Canada for the rest of the summer. We had planned to spend most of the week working on the cabin and did not use the boat very much so the gas price was no big deal. My kids caught some nice smallmouth and a bunch of 2-4 pound northerns off our dock which was great fun to watch. And I think my kids enjoy that more than they do spending a day in the boat.
1316832,jiggster,2011-06-10 11:30:00,183,Anderson's Manitou Falls give private boats 10 gallons per day in their package.
1321510,Legend115,2011-06-22 18:37:00,39,For gas prices in the province of Ontario...http://www.ontariogasprices.com/
1321948,bigwalleye1,2011-06-23 20:46:00,2632,"$1.39/ltr pretty steady at the Wellington in Sioux Lookout last week and early this week, $1.39 to $1.41 at Moscatos, depending on the day. Seems like the days Knobby's has the big cabin change day, Moscato's gas prices jump. Funny how they're on the road between civilization and Knobby's. Location, location, location, they say."
1315912,troutwater,2011-06-08 09:38:00,299,I haven't seen anyone post yet what gas is costing per liter up in Canada right now. We leave in about 4 weeks and was trying to budget the gas bill. If anyone could give an update it'd be much appreciated thanks.
1315921,tackleman,2011-06-08 09:45:00,444,In Red Lake it was !.44 a litre . multiply that by 3.98 to get your price per US gallon multiply by 4.5 for the cost per imperial gallon.
1315926,troutwater,2011-06-08 09:52:00,299,"Thanks, I always seem to head to Canada the years gas is at it highest for some reason."
1315932,jswinter40,2011-06-08 10:02:00,127,because it is vacation/fishing season.

1315946,guide7,2011-06-08 10:20:00,70,Actually 1 US gallon = 3.78541178 liters. So I always use 3.79 as my multiplier. Still way too high.
1315962,greenie,2011-06-08 10:55:00,87,"Last Saturday, June 4th in Emo, Ont. Gas was $1.37.9 a liter."
1315969,Skywagon,2011-06-08 11:36:00,1106,$1.36 per liter in Dryden
1315981,Blackmacs,2011-06-08 12:08:00,2121,Expect to see much higher prices on the lake though.
1315994,Freytown,2011-06-08 12:44:00,770,http://www.garnetknight.com/gas/index.phpRemember gas at camps has to be delivered...fuel truck in/out adds up fast.
