1321933,tlee,2011-06-23 20:14:00,65,I just got back from Flin Flon. What lake did you catch that on?
1321996,MONSTERQUEST,2011-06-24 03:27:00,14,"Looks like Mackenzie point, Lake Athapaskow. Just guessing though."

1322289,hoosiercanadian,2011-06-24 16:39:00,104,"Will be heading up to the Lynn Lake area of Manitoba July 9th with my 4 daughters , their ages are 30, 24, 21, and 13, i feel very fortunate that we are still able to all get together and make this trip, it is the highlight of my year, my oldest is getting married in the fall so next year i may have to break in a son in law ! 1,850 miles one way, but once you get there it is heaven !"
1322506,MONSTERQUEST,2011-06-25 08:57:00,14,"Hey BFH, did you get that big girl jigging. Was up the first week of June but boy the wind never laid down long enough to do much exploring on the big water. What really got my attention was the lack of boats out fishing and all the vacancy's at all the resorts. When I first started coming up to Cranberry Portage it was a two year wait minimum to get a cottage at one of the resorts, now you can come up and stay where ever you want for as long as you want. Amazing considering the fishery and accommodations up your way. Just feel sorry for all the resort owners up there, has to be tough on them. And by the way the walleye were on fire in Simon house narrows and Slims bay, size and numbers best was a 31Â” pig."
