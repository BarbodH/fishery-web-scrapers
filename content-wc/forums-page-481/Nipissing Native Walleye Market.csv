It is in the commercial fishermen't best interest to harvest prudently. Now, I'm not sayng either way whether the average fisherman appreciates this, but that is where the powers to be need to step in and establish reasonable guidelines that allow for a sustained fishery. Properly managed Nipissing still has tremendous potential as a sportfishing and limited commercial fishery."

This is excellent,"" said Diana Perry as she picked up $26 worth of walleye for supper, with a few fillets wrapped for the freezer. This is the first time the native community has sold fish through a co-operative business model regulated by its own laws and conservation plan. In years past, individual fishers and families operated commercial entities without provincial health inspections of their facilities that allow restaurant resale. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources said it supports the retail fish market approach, with the understanding that all of the fish are from registered commercial fishermen. The MNR is encouraged by the ongoing efforts to build co-operative relations with Nipissing First Nation over the past few years,"" said Randy Morrison, the North Bay MNR's Nipissing area manager. The certified approach also allows non-natives to store more than their game fish catch limits in freezers as long as they keep official receipts. The market price this week is $14 a pound or just over $3 per 100 grams. One group bought more than $200 worth of fillets for an impromptu fish fry for 30 people at the workplace. Old Chief owner Jimmy Kolios set up the processing and counter operation at the front end of the waterfront boat facility for Nipissing to use. Nipissing's commercial fishery is recognized by the province and it has spent the past few years fine-tuning its management and conservation policies before venturing into a retail operation. Kolios said he's been waiting for years to be able to sell fresh Lake Nipissing walleye and was eager to help get things started. Until the market attracts a steady flow of customers, Kolios said he is buying all unsold fish for the Old Chief and Churchill's Prime Rib House restaurants. About 160 kilograms of walleye was processed for sale Friday. We're making history now, finally going to be able to legally serve and eat and sell Lake Nipissing pickerel that's been famous for years and years,"" Kolios said. It's a win-win for everyone."" Perry said she saw the article in The Nugget about the market and wanted to see for herself what was available. You can see them cutting them up, wrapping them and it's all done with nice fresh fish,"" she said. The official opening of the market is planned Thursday, but Nipissing staff are using this week to iron the wrinkles out of the system. Christine Hays was lunching at the waterfront restaurant with co-workers and didn't realize the market was open or that the Old Chief was already selling fresh Nipissing walleye. Hays said it makes a lot of sense environmentally to buy locally, reducing the pollution required to ship products to this area from other jurisdictions. I fish Lake Nipissing for pickerel myself, but if I can buy it, why not?"" Hays said, explaining that people just want to know that the fishery can sustain the pressure. Richard Rowe, Nipissing's biologist and fisheries manager, said the shared data gathered by the MNR and themselves indicates the fishery has improved a bit over the past several years after being stressed."" Rowe said the commercial quota and MNR angling harvest estimate won't exceed two-thirds of what the lake can sustain just to be on the safe side. Jeff McLeod, Nipissing fisheries coordinator, said any fish over 57 centimetres long -- about three pounds -- isn't used for the commercial catch. McLeod said larger, older fish accumulate the natural and human-contributed contaminants and are not suggested for regular consumption. Rowe also said they are trying for a zero waste"" operation and are composting the fish guts, heads and tails. Article ID# 1093160"
1319319,Guest,2011-06-17 07:34:00,0,The commercial fishery started four summers ago and surprise surprise the walleye population started decline about three years ago. Commercial fishing on Lake Nipissing needs to stop. I have spoke to the MNR biologist and he confirms that the fishery is dwindling and that the lake is in trouble. The MNR needs to act now to save this lake from being fished out of Walleye. I have been on the lake for 35 years and I have never seen the fishing so bad.
1319503,Guest,2011-06-17 15:26:00,0,"we fished Nipissing 8 years ago out of the waltonian Inn all we caught were a bunch of perch and a ccouple dozen 13""walleyes. the slot limit is bad and allowing commercial fishing in there is horrible."
1319510,jigngrub,2011-06-17 16:00:00,304,I wonder just how many slot limit size Walleye and other species of fish are killed in these commercial fishing excursions?I'm sure the declining fishery is really helping the tourism trade on Nip eh?
1319552,JBwvu,2011-06-17 19:27:00,18,What is there program to sustain the fishery? Is there a hatchery nearby?

1319620,polaris-pete,2011-06-18 05:36:00,343,"When will the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources wake up to the blatant destruction of a once thriving fidhery where these natives net and spear.My good friend is an Outdoor writer from around Sudbury.He has written many articles on the desecretion of his areas walleye population due to this netting of vast stocks of walleye.These nets have left his favorite waters ( Serpent River) with a very poor walleye population.Myself I have witnessed many times the sickening form of collecting fish, spearing them.There is a small creek at Point Au Baril that was once gold with walleyes.We stopped one day and watched as these indians speared numerous breeding walleye in this pool.There were many fisn laying on the bottom as after spearing them, if they got off the barbed spear, they would just sink to the bottom and remain there. These indians did nothing to try and retreive these fish. Then later they would stop by various fishing camps and try to sell these fish. A little further up the highway on the Magnetawan River off alittle dirt sideroad you could see many TeePees set up.The stayed in these huts and speared down in the River.We were told not to go down there at all because of this spearing practice. It will never stop and its getting worse now with these long nets they are using across River mouths to catch anything that swims, slot fish or not!!!!!!"

The MNR will even provide them nets free of charge, if it is ""for their own use"". Many big walleye are taken and some northern/musky are just discarded, as least from what I know of netting on my lake (Dinorwic). The rules on this were valid at one time, but it is a very broken system now in my opinion, I could go on but......."
1321507,Legend115,2011-06-22 18:30:00,39,a huge X2. last year i i was d/rigging on nip and caught a net with my cannon ball. (i use the d/rigger in july when they are scattered in 32fow) it was about 200ft long. when i pulled it up it had a large amount of walleye in it - they were white and rotting away. i poked my finger through a coupe of them. the next day i was out there again and i witnessed two natives in a 16ft aluminum driving around the area looking desperately for their net...they never found it.
