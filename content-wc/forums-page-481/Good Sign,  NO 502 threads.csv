1321787,wallydave,2011-06-23 12:22:00,2151,As of June 4-10th the 502 was in great shape! No construction and in good repair!
1321821,Outfitter17,2011-06-23 13:58:00,127,The road is good all the way up The only construction is on the causeway over rainy lake and it is only a block long.

They must have fixed that last year after we went, because this year we had smooth sailing, road was actually better than a lot of the roads in Northern MN. They're doing some sporadic cable post replacement but nothing of any great consequence, no to minimal delays."
