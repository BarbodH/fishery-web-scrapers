This week's east winds have kept the fishing pretty consistent. This is true especially on windswept shorelines, weeds and breaks. Generally the walleyes are setting up in 5 to 15fow on lakes and in the deeper holes on streams and rivers. The humid weather has introduced us to a whole new meaning of bugs. Thermocells are must right now, especially at remote landings. Once fishing though, the bugs are kept away by even a slight breeze. We are starting to receive many reports that the monster lake trout on Lake Nipigon are starting to rev up. And the pike fishing remains very good on weedy bays and river/stream mouths.

Wind (especially consistent wind) will be key to finding active fish. Weather predictions are very favorable for next week."
