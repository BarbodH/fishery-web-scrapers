1321594,ogassuk,2011-06-22 22:06:00,2,You should try the central area of Lac Seul...the Old Hudson Bay post area of Lac Seul......I just had a part of 8 leave here this morning who got more than 3 per day each...they usually get 150-200 for the whole party each day.
1321751,tv4fish,2011-06-23 11:00:00,2694,Are you sure on that count -- 3 per day ????????????
1313477,BenBeattie,2011-06-01 11:50:00,232,"As NWWalleye said, jigs and minnows are all it takes. 1/8 or 1/4 depending on wind and depth. I like glow, white, chart but all colours work up here. Half my fish are vertical jigging under the boat and half come pitching towards shore and jumping/dragging the jig back towards the boat. Right now, if you get a warm sunny day and the bays heat up, the mayfly nymphs are coming out of the mud and they walleye are gorging on them. I'm seen stomach contents just loaded with mayfly nymphs. They'll be in 3-8 fow in spots that look more like pike spots. Doesn't always produce but worth checking out cause when they're in there, there're IN THERE!!"
1313490,teddi,2011-06-01 12:18:00,349,"right now if it was me i would go to the far end of steamboat before shanty narrows. in thebay on the right there is a reef[marked] or the three small islands on the left just past cox,s island. look for the old river channel and fish the edge of it. or you can go past ghost narrows and fish the two small islands to the east, same old river channel"
1314065,guide7,2011-06-02 19:38:00,70,"So I was reading on an Ontario Lakes website this morning that one of the game species in Lac Seul was Lake Trout. What part of the lake are they in, if at all? We are heading up on June 15 and I would bring my downriggers if the trout are in there."
1314074,BenBeattie,2011-06-02 19:47:00,232,"It's not really worth your time. They are in here but are very few and far between. I've heard of about 5 confirmed lake trout catches over the last 7 years, all in the same area in the south central section of the lake."
1314161,NWwalleye,2011-06-03 06:06:00,223,"In 15 + years of guiding out on Lac Seul, I have never had one come in my boat .. I put a lot of time in the south central section of the lake ."
1314173,teddi,2011-06-03 06:30:00,349,i have heard of trout coming from bray lake in the past but have never caught one myself.
1314179,NWwalleye,2011-06-03 06:40:00,223,Must have been in the Spring .. Bray Bay is shallow and a good spot for early walleye fishing.
1314205,guide7,2011-06-03 07:51:00,70,"Nice to know. Bray is where I tried in the 60-80 foot bowl depth. Graph was full of good deep marks. We vertical jigged a 34"" northern off the bottom in about 70 feet of water. The good thing is he wasn't slimy at all and a lot more pleasant to return to the waters. Then a large tulibee about a half hour later. Our effort ended then. Maybe more time and patience would have yielded a nice deep water ""eye"" too. 7"
1314278,NWwalleye,2011-06-03 12:33:00,223,"My bad was thinking of the bay entering, not the actual BIG Bray Bay ( Lake ) .. Lots of water to hold Lake trout if they are in there .. I fish mostly small entrance and just past, plus around the island for walleyes .."
1314287,Knoxabilly,2011-06-03 13:18:00,225,"We got into some good Walleyes the last 2 days...Radar Island and islands just outside of Sawmill. Caught 26'', 24'', 24'' and multiple in the slot on last day. Caught one of the overs while thowing a northern lure that was probably 8'' long! Slip bobbers weren't working for us even though the bite was slow and soft, catching everything on jig and minnow or leech. We used, green, yellow, pink, chartreuse etc. Color didn't seem to make much of a difference. 2-10 foot deep, had lots of luck with very shallow water, 1-2ft dropping to about 7-8 foot. Caught some over the slot northerns on bucktail spinners and of course while jigging. Had a great time thanks to Pat and Gary of Evergreen Lodge. This was my 5th year there I think. They are so kind and helpful, I would recommend anyone going to Lac Seul to go there. They know we'll be back year after year! Good luck gentlemen, knock um dead!"
1312562,Knoxabilly,2011-05-29 22:18:00,225,"We got here Saturday...Day one was decent, rained all day. Greenhorn in my boat bagged his first Northern of his life, this is his first time fishing, 41'' Northern! Caught it on his ultra Lite with 6lb test! It was a **** of a battle. The group caught about 5 slot Walleyes. Today was a beautiful day, bad for fishing though. After about 12:00 the fish went total lock jaw...crazy slow day. Been catching our fish in shallow waters in Sawmill Bay on jig and minnows and slip bobbers. I hope tomorrow is better and barometric stops moving. How is everyone else doin?"
1312618,wallydave,2011-05-30 08:08:00,2151,"Thanks Knoxabilly my group will hit LS out of Goose Bay Camp this weekend! Keep the reports coming, the juices are flowing! I'm taking a newbie for his first reel fishing trip! Any action at the mouth of the river? How are the water temps? Don't forget the depth and color reports either!! Hope the rest of your week goes great!"
1313261,Knoxabilly,2011-05-31 21:28:00,225,Anyone having any luck? This is by far the slowest year i've ever experienced here. Sucks cause I have 3 greenhorns with me so they now think I don't know what I'm doing and or the lake sucks. Any tips? We're catching like 2-3 Walleyes each in a day?!? Like I said worst numbers in 15yrs for us.
1313330,teddi,2011-06-01 06:35:00,349,maybe you should try some new spots on the lake or change the way you fish. doing the same thing for 15 years maybe time for a change. there is more to lac seul than sawmill bay.
1313345,tv4fish,2011-06-01 07:11:00,2694,"If you're only catching 2-3 walleyes per day on Lac Seul -- you DEFINITELY need to change location, change depth, change presentation, change bait, etc."
1313355,BenBeattie,2011-06-01 07:32:00,232,"Steady 100+ fish days on the east end. Fish are scattred, post spawn. Catching them in 2' to 20' and everywhere in between. Just depends on the spot, conditions, day etc. Keep moving around till you find them. Follow the wind, spots getting hit by the wind have a better chance of having an active bite then 'off-wind' spots."
1313365,wallydave,2011-06-01 07:44:00,2151,"Knoxabilly, the weather can sure make fishing tough! One year we were basically cabin bound for the better part of two days! Windy, rainy, and cold. After the front moved out, the bite was on! Like some of the other posts, try some new spots, the fish are in there, it's just a matter of finding them, and then finding what they will hit on! Try some windy points, right along the clay colored water, where it meets the lake water. I'm taking a newbie up in a couple of days, in the back of my mind, I am worried about a couple of off days! It happens, hopefully the rest of the week things will pick up!"
1313368,Mike Kansas,2011-06-01 07:47:00,1463,"I agree Ben. During all the years we have fished on Lac Seul in the early part of the season when the Walleye are still holding good in shallow shore positions the WIND has been the key. A windy point or shoreline will always have the chance of holding more fish than non wind structure. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1313372,Guest,2011-06-01 07:52:00,0,"Ben, What color & presentations are working best for your right now? Minnows? Crawlers? Thanks!"
1313422,NWwalleye,2011-06-01 09:29:00,223,"I would stick with minnows.. Walleye fishing has been good to great on most days out ..Like Ben says... Move around... Fish have been coming consistently between 5 to 14 fow water for me. I have caught some in the deeper ranges, but the numbers for us have been between the water column mentioned.Fishing with a jig and minnow, using chartreuse, white and orange.. Anything with that colour combination has worked well ..Like some have said... there is a whole lot is lake beside Sawmill Bay.. Move out to the rest of LS and hit the East shore past. Look for walleye looking water and fish the wind.. You will find a pattern, you just have to work at it and change the 15 year way of thinking.. Remember, 365 days is a long time for fish to change their ways. Lots of factors change, the wind, weather, water depth, water temps, barometric pressure, etc......Good luck and tight lines.."
