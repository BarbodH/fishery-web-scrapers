1321515,MorganMan,2011-06-22 18:51:00,341,I have seen some old posts on this subject and have been doing fly ins for 15+ years. We usually tip $50-$100 bucks each way as our group is anywhere from 6 to 10 guys. Too much? Not enough? At least they know we appreciate the job they do.

1321942,go dart,2011-06-23 20:31:00,77,"I cant forget when my buddy told me on his last fly-in trip the pilot had a cup in the plane that said "" don't forget to tip your pilot "". Well they didn't on the flight in and he was a day late picking them up."
1322098,kansasity,2011-06-24 09:09:00,80,Well that's just one more day of fishing for me and my buddys it sounds like to me. My buddys always tip.
1322235,Hawkfan,2011-06-24 13:46:00,237,We have seen a sign in the plane that said not to forget to tip your pilot so he doesn't forget where to pick you up. I guess its true!

These guys along with the dockhands bust their humps for the lodge for usually minimum (or if you're stupid enough to agree to salary like we did, LESS than minimum wage). Cooks work scattered shifts for min. wage but seldom work more than 6-8 hours in a day same go's for the waitresses who clean cabins as well. They wait on guests and do mountains of dishes, and in the day clean cabins and haul garbage bags of dirty linens back and forth. Please guys...these people WORK...tip well"
1322626,michigan walleye guy,2011-06-25 16:49:00,95,We usually pony up $20/guy ($160 for an 8-man group) and leave the tip as we square up the bills before heading home. I believe that these tips are divided equally between the pilots and the dockhands.
