524088,Guest,2002-09-07 05:41:00,0,"My brother and family went there four or five years ago. Lots of Walleye caught by casual fisherman. My youngest niece caught a Walleye while my brother was rigging a line for her sister. He rebaited and another walleye was caught before he was able to finish rigging up the sister's line. They enjoyed the stay and the other guests and fellow Iowans in the camp. The electric start outboard is a plus. Cabins have good supply of kitchen utensis. If there is more than one to a bed, you might experience a ""come here dear"" roll to the middle.I know they would recommend the resort.Good luck fishing."

1321381,Guest,2011-06-22 11:52:00,0,"Wennie is a small lake that flows into Lac Seul on it's north side. It is a short trip east of Ear Falls to the lake and the roads are pretty good. There are close to a dozen ""private"" cabins on the lake that are owned primarily by residents of Fort Dodge, IA., and stay pretty full all season long, so boat traffic is heavier than you would expect. Fishing for walleyes was pretty good the last time I was there. Most productive fishing is above the falls where you anchor close to shore than use a lindy rig (3/4 to 1oz lead), cast upstream and keep your line tight as is moves downstream...minnows, crawlers or leeches have the same success numbers. Cast around or speed troll the islands for northerns and if water is right, you can make it up to adjoining lake where pikes are more prevalent. Have fun! CC"
1321417,Walleyegolfer,2011-06-22 13:22:00,18,I know the spring fishing is great on Winnie by the mouth of the river. A friend of the family has a cabin at the mouth of the river and they don't even leave the dock for a week sometimes to catch fish. I have only fished it a couple of times but have caught a fair amount of walleye there. If you get a chance go up river to the falls. It is scenic and the one time i did go up there you couldn't go a minute without catching a fish. If i remember right though you have to be carefull of the rocks just before you get there. Glenman- we stay on Cedar every year and will be there again this year in Mid-August. We stay at Northern Lights on the SW end of the lake and have been going there for years. When are you headed there?
1321433,outdoorsron,2011-06-22 14:00:00,843,"Hello Dave: Ive been going there for the last 6 or 7 years. Nice resort, nice people. You should have no trouble catching Walleye and Northerns. Only saw 1 group having trouble catching fish 1 year. Found out they were only using spinners, no live bait. Set them straight told them to use jigs and minnows and they had no trouble catching fish.Just ask Dave or Gretchen where they are biting. We really catch fish everywhere we try. As minnows come with the resort package that is about all the bait we use although I do use some Gulp baits because they stay on the hook and you can catch more fish without rebaiting all the time. Good Luck O R"

Recently they have moved the date back to June 15th. My question is can people fish above the Rapids, but not below the Rapids before June 15th?"
