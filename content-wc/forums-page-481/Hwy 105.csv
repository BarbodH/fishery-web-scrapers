1322063,The Donger,2011-06-24 07:33:00,48,Any construction on Hwy 105 this year between Hwy 17 and Red Lake?
1322087,REG,2011-06-24 08:48:00,445,"Nope. The bridges they were working on last year all seem to be done and the road is smooth. Edit - at least as far as Pakwash - I didn't go the last 20 miles to Red Lake. But the bridge over the Chukuni looked done, at least from going underneath it"
