2949761,rdunk,2014-06-29 20:13:00,20,any info on what type of road 622 is. we usually travel north on 502 and was looking at this as a option.
2954225,jethro09,2014-07-01 00:31:00,12,622 is a secondary highway. It doesn't have much traffic on it and is 135km long.
2954457,stillangling,2014-07-01 06:05:00,149,"The road is in good shape and as noted earlier, it gets very little traffic. If you are heading to the Ignace or Savant Lake area, it is not a bad option. If your destination is farther west it makes sense to stick to 502 or 71"
