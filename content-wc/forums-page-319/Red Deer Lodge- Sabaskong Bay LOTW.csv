2949017,Ihaveabaddog,2014-06-29 16:58:00,1,"Have not stayed at this lodge, but know the area VERY well, have fished the area for years. Be advised, this is not a secluded location, right on the highway. Not a big deal to most, a big deal to some. Local fishing is good, but guides will probably take you to Miles Bay and beyond. Nice of them to do so, since not all of us have 200hp engines on our boats! Quite a few local (within a 10 min boat ride) muskies, most are 40 inch range. We have caught a lot of them while casting the shoreline with bass spinner baits, usually right at the opener. Scotty is a local guide that is simply awesome, his personality and knowledge are huge! He is known by everyone locally, though your lodge may steer you to someone else. The water surrounding this area is about 15' deep and well stained, which is nice, since fishing is good all day. Deeper water starts on the way to Wolf island and is 45' deep. Liquor/grocery store is well stocked and about a mile away. ""Green's"" is the local bar/restaurant and is about 2 miles away, right down the highway, good food and atmosphere. Bottom line is, you will catch more fish on a fly in, but if you are willing to do some 1 hr boat rides, this lake has a lot to offer. Sorry I can't be of more help on the lodge, but please contact me if you decide to go there. I can give you more info (and pics) about the fishing. -Jack"
2949073,MikeinMN,2014-06-29 17:12:00,190,"Our group stayed a couple miles west of Red Deer a year or two ago. From the water the camp looks great. Nicely spaced cabins that I think were all right on the water. All their boats are in a little natural harbor that gives good protection from the wind. Red Deer is pretty close to Turtle Portage if you want a change of waters to fish and a little adventure. We had pretty mediocre fishing when we were there for whatever reason, but search this forum for Sabaskong Bay and you will find many others have had very good fishing. We fish mainly walleye, and have virtually no musky experience, but we did manage to raise a few muskies and even hooked one while putting very little time in for them."
2949641,J. Merics,2014-06-29 19:25:00,32,Thanks for the info guys. Red Deer caught my eye because of the price as it will be a 2 week trip. I'm not to keen on the location though. I'm now looking more west at Split Rock Lodge or Hanson's King Island. I will be hauling my own boat. Does the government dock/launch in Nester get busy in July or is it usually in and out?
2950625,oly67,2014-06-30 06:46:00,241,"I have been fishing muskies in that area for 14 years or so. Stayed at C & C, Spilt Rock, Lake of the Woods Lodge, Young's Wilderness Camp, and at Red Wing at Morson. I like the location of Split Rock the best. Largest muskie caught was 52"" by me. Quite a few 45 to 48. Lots of 37 to 45. I have driven by Red Deer many times, did not pay too much attention, seems to be fine. We stay at C & C the most now. Mainly because it is cheap and the rest of my crew is too lazy to help cook when we get back. So we walk to Green's to eat where the food is not the greatest and not cheap either. Oh well, I don't go to Canada to eat. Farther up the road to the north, maybe a couple miles, is another place to eat that we drive to quite often. Can't remember the name, on west side of road, nothing spectacular either. My preference is Split Rock. There are big muskies close to town, far from town, everywhere. You are in a great location at Split Rock. We fish Stony Portage Bay alot, go into the bigger open areas of Sabaskong some to the west, and catch alot back towards town. I am just pissed off you get to go for 2 weeks.....................have fun, catch a big one!"
2952913,LundDriver,2014-06-30 16:14:00,30,"We have never stayed at Red Deer but my wife and I stopped in once just to check them out. Very nice people. Camp looks very well kept. Only problem is it's on the highway. But so are we at Helliars. The traffic is not a problem as we are on the lake all day. In the evenings you have the occasional logging truck but it's not like every ten minutes. The area is great for all species of fish and the best part is you can always find some shelter if the wind comes up. (they don't call it cyclone point for nothing) Did not care much for Splitrock but that may be just our likes and dislikes. Splitrock is also on a highway. A highway for boats. Anyone coming from nestor and going out to the great beyond will pass by splitrock. Also, I do not know when splitrock shuts down their generator. I have fished in that area and their generator runs all day long. On the good side, splitrock cuts off about 15 min. of travel time if you are heading OUT! (depending on your boat size) We never really target muskies as we normally are there in early spring, before season opens, but have seen many 50+ in. fish so they are in the area. LOTW is an awsome fishery, good luck."
2957914,J. Merics,2014-07-02 01:28:00,32,Thanks again for the feedback. I talked with Donna Hanson from King Island Lodge yesterday and as of now I think were pretty much set on going there.
