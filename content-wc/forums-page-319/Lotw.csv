2957490,Dog,2014-07-01 20:00:00,210,Just got back from there Saturday. The water was about 3' high and rising all week but I don't think it hurt the fishin. The water temps were about 10 degrees colder than what we usually see this time of the year but overall considering everything the fishing was great. 2 walleyes over 30 and several between 25 & 29 and plenty for shore lunch.

They had not nested yet but the females were full of eggs. Most were holding in 8 feet of water or so instead of right up on the bank where we usually find them. We like to topwater and they were just not there. Tubes and other platsic worked ok. The walleye were scattered but in the usual spots. We caught most of the fish in 8 to 13 feet of water. We don't fish the mid lake humps like most do. Mostly bays and along shorelines. Water temp was 58 to 62. It rained a bunch and the water really spiked while we were there. The waterline was up into the low tree limbs by the time we left. Overall a very tough year for bass and average to below average for walleye."

It was my first LOTW trip so I have nothing to compare to, but I sure can't complain about the fishing.The only thing weird was lack of walleye, but no one in camp was focused on them.Plenty of pike, musky and smallies."
