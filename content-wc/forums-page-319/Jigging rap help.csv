2960826,timvigen,2014-07-02 20:29:00,42,"I've fished jigging raps alot over rocks pay attension to what your doing and you won't lose very many drop it to the bottom on a fairly light line and reel it up 3 or 4'' watch your locator so you can reel up a little if it gets shallower also put a swivel about a foot above the jigging rap so u don't get line twist,I use just a barrel swivel,its needs to be fairly calm so your fishing just about verticle,its a great bait,be aggressive with your jigging snap it a foot and a half or two feet.they really shine in 20' or more,perfect for reefs in canada.all i've ever used for line is 8 lb trilene xl no leader,tie it directly to the jigging rap"
2881793,rdbalmer,2014-06-09 17:16:00,279,"One thing you may want to try is keeping your line as vertical as possible and avoid making contact with the bottom as much as you can if you are forced to fish in real rocky areas. That is what I do here in Minnesota rather than troll and jig. It is very similar to ice fishing. I haven't used any type of steel leader on my jigging raps so I can't say for sure how it will affect your success. My gut feeling says you will be far better off with out the leader as far as walleyes goes. I just use a duo lock snap on mine. Only one way to know for sure though and that is to try it. As far as the knot goes I use a back to back uni knot. My super line is suffix 832 but I would still recommend it for power pro also. If you have trouble with the knot slipping, a drop of super glue will help. I haven't had that knot slip at all. Good Luck and let us know how it worked out for you. Rob"
2881801,kzoofisher,2014-06-09 17:19:00,5144,"With a lure as erratic as jigging rap I would definitely go with a barrel swivel as my connection. Palomar knot for the braid and improved clinch for the leader. There are entire threads dedicated to the braid to leader connection. Let us know how the raps work, I'm starting to think they might be a great bait on mudflats during the mayfly hatch."
2881953,muskyroller,2014-06-09 18:27:00,56,"What a great idea...swivel! Now, that I think I've got the knot issue solved, what am I going to do about those **** northerns?! Will a heavier flouro leader work to prevent bite offs and still get the attention from big walleyes? I want to maintain the action of the jigging rap, while saving them from a gullet of a jack. I use 100lb and 120lb. for my musky leaders...would a 20 or 30lb. flouro leader be able to take a few nix from pike and still impart the action to the rap? Or should/could I just run a mono leader? Only 11 days till we leave...I'll let you know how it's going when we're up there. Hope the wi-fi has improved!"
2882273,rdbalmer,2014-06-09 19:27:00,279,"There is nothing wrong with using a swivel, particularly if you are using mono as your main line. I personally have not had issues with the back to back uni knot or any line twist in the 832 suffix. I don't know if it is just the way the super lines are or what but I would be willing to bet mono would be a night mare with out the swivel. It is probably easier to tie on the swivel compared to the uni knot unless you have tied it a few times. As far as the heavy fluoro leader..... again my gut says it will hamper you catching many walleyes. I really haven't caught all that many northerns on the raps, although I don't normally use them in any thing other than what I consider deep water(20'-40'). Not to say they won't bite them because I am sure they will but my experience is such that I don't really concern my self with it. I run a 14lb. fluoro and the few northerns I have caught didn't bite me off. Your situation may be different. Let us know. Rob"
2887945,wesman40,2014-06-11 10:45:00,45,I use a back to back Uni-knot or tie a small swivel. Swivel would work well with a jiggin rap.
2956985,muskyroller,2014-07-01 17:27:00,56,"Hi guys, Got back late last week from a week on Lac Seul. I went with a spro swivel to tie power pro to the floro leader. Then, I went with a spro snap swivel to tie to the floro and attach the rap. It was a blast figuring this thing out. I tried it the first few days and on the second spot, caught a 16"". It absolutely smoked it and about tore the rod out of my hands. Admittedly, I'm a musky fiend, so this type of fishing is right up my ally. There was nothing finesse about it! Unfortunately, I only caught one more on the jigging rap for the week. It wasn't for lack of effort and spots, though. Again, another 16"" and about tore the rod out of my hand. On a side note: I did try Musky Innovations ""Nano Dawgs"" and that was an absolute blast. I caught a bunch of walleyes doing the same thing as the jigging rap and had the same experience with jarring hits and great fights. I did lose a few fish, I think, because of the power pro and just ripping the soft plastic away on the jig/hookset. Thanks for all the help and advice. I'll be giiving the jigging rap a greater workout on future trips...deep water! Steve"
2957946,rdbalmer,2014-07-02 04:03:00,279,"Thanks for the feed back. I'm glad to hear you caught a few on the raps. It does take a while to catch on to how to work them and gain the confidence you need in them. Don't give up on them, they are truly a good bait in the right situation. Rob"
2958410,Kansas Bound,2014-07-02 07:57:00,152,Thank you for following up.
2958442,SinOrSwim,2014-07-02 08:07:00,1528,I tried a couple jigging raps last year as well and maybe I'm not doing it right but I didn't catch anything.
2960370,MorganMan,2014-07-02 18:01:00,341,I tried one last year and did catch a small walleye with it. I didn't use it long as I feel like my time is limited and want to be using something I'm more comfortable with. I will likely try again this year if others are seeing promising results.
2875641,muskyroller,2014-06-07 18:22:00,56,"Hi folks, taking the plunge and going to try jigging raps on lac Seul in two weeks. After 8 bucks a pop I'm worried about bite offs and hanging up in rocks. I'm thinking a leader will hurt the action and I'm worried about using power pro, etc. and getting snagged and having to cut line. What would you do? Right now, going with daiwa spinning reel and 6' 3"" med action, fast tip gander guide rod. Line? Leader? Thanks, Steve"
2875713,lassh,2014-06-07 19:08:00,553,"I'm thinking you might be able to straighten the hook out with power pro if the hook on the jigging rap gets hung. If the lure is wedged and you can't get it out after trying all angles then you might have to cut, but you'll be able to save lure from many snags that would have broken off mono or fluoro. If you put a section of Tyger Wire or equivalent it might not affect the jigging rap action too much. You should at least test it out as a potential option."
2875769,muskyroller,2014-06-07 19:28:00,56,"When you tie the tiger wire, just go with a surgeons knot to the power pro?"
2875809,rdbalmer,2014-06-07 19:46:00,279,"I would suggest you run a fluorocarbon leader about 3 feet long with a lighter break strength than your super line. If you do get snagged, and you will the leader will break instead of the super line. My suggestion would be to try to stay away from the really snaggy rocky areas if possible. The shape of the jigging rap makes it a nightmare to fish in the rocks. I have lost a lot of them to the rocks. If you look at it another way even at 8 bucks a piece it isn't that bad compared to the price of minnows up there. They are an awesome bait and given a chance I think you will really like them."
2876145,btmbncr,2014-06-08 00:17:00,492,"In the Anglers Edge video Uncle Al say's""don't fish these over rocks"".Fish them on sand or gravel bottoms.Bill"
2876905,grizzley,2014-06-08 09:30:00,2518,"May not be a ""solve all"", but one of those lure retrievers may be of help.We use them, and they have paid for themselves many times over."
2878337,rdbalmer,2014-06-08 18:59:00,279,Might be worth a try. My experience is once they are stuck between a couple rocks it is all over but I have never tried the lure retriever. It just might work.
2878385,ricorth07,2014-06-08 19:09:00,1143,"If you tie a good knot on a thicker braid or your power Pro, you might be able to straighten out the back hook before line break if wedged tight.. Another thing is you can definitely get jiggin raps cheaper than eight bucks a pop.. sometimes I see them in lot sales on eBay that average out to 5 bucks a piece, not that anybody wants to lose any anywaySent from my LGMS323 using Tapatalk"
2880673,Bigstorm,2014-06-09 11:25:00,799,If you can vertical jig them you can fish over rocks without getting snagged up too much.
2881577,muskyroller,2014-06-09 15:54:00,56,"Thanks for all the help guys. I bought a couple so I think I'll try super line with a floro leader first. If I get bit off by a slimey jack then I'll put some sort of invisi-leader on, tied direct to the power pro. tying floro to power pro, what kind of knot do you guys use? And as far as rocks, I'll do my best to avoid, but up on the ""shield"" not much I can do since they're all over. I'll try deep, open water and try and find a sand bite to get the feel of it first. Excited to try this because all we ever do is 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8 oz. jigs with minnows and a few spinner rigs every so often. Hopefully it speeds up how we find fish.. Steve"
