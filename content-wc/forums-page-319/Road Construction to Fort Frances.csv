We don't head up for a couple months, but wanted to give information to those of you heading up soon. I have traveled I35 from Hinckley to Cloquet, 33 North to 53 all the way to I Falls several times. I do not know what construction is out there from the cities to Hinckley? I do know that there is some construction between Cloquet to Duluth, not sure of delays? Hinckley to Cloquet is clear sailing this year so far, both ways. Hwy 33 is clear. Hwy 53 is clear except that project between Virginia and Cook which had been going on, for what seem like, 8 years. I have been through there several time in the last 2 weeks and I Falls for construction. I do know there are places of slowdown or backups south of the cities?"
