2953817,Mike Borger,2014-06-30 20:14:00,1554,"Yes!! I'll agree with a couple of other posters.If you're driving to Toronto don't rent a car and drive 6 hours north. Total waste of time and money imo.Drive to Toronto then grab a flight to Thunder Bay, it's only a 11/2 hour flight! I guarantee you the cost of a return flight from Pearson to TB is way less than the cost of a car rental for the week.There are several GREAT outfitters that fly direct out of Thunder Bay eliminating the need for car rental.As it happens I just returned from North Caribou Lake on Saturday and they're a prime example. We flew to from Pearson to Thunder Bay then into Weagamow Lake via Wasaya Airlines, then a short float plane ride from Weagamow to the camp. The cost for a week at this camp is inclusive from Thunder Bay.On our last day we left camp at 10:30am and I was in my living room drinking a beer at 6:30pm.And oh yeah it was my best fly in trip to date and I've done close to 50. I'm already rebooked for next year."
2959410,kayakmatt,2014-07-02 12:11:00,105,"This is why I love this forum! Sounds like the only good fishing place north of Toronto is Lady Evelyn. Yes, I priced rental cars from Toronto Pearson and I was shocked. About $600 a week!! That will buy a float plane ride or two if the rental car could be avoided! In the past I have flown to MSP, drive a rental car, and usually only go within an hour or two north of the border. Been to Pipestone, Manitou, and the most convenient of all...Lac La Croix. Fishing has been just ""OK"" at all of them. I guess folks will define good fishing differently! I did learn that I do not like bouncing in others boat wakes if I am spending thousands and going this far to fish...ie Voyageurs Natl Park!I will look further to the suggestions of both Winnipeg and Thunder Bay. Doesn't solve my direct flight desire from Nashville, but hoping to be fishing the same evening I leave the comfort of my own home in the morning. Guess its the tradeoff for the best fishing in North America!"
2959418,ftfarms,2014-07-02 12:27:00,444,If your thinking of flying into Winnipeg I wouldn't rule out driving to kenora and going north and fish the Winnipeg river or the English river. Both are great fisheries
2933177,kayakmatt,2014-06-24 20:11:00,105,"Traveling to Canadian lodges by commercial air, rental car, border crossing is expensive. And I am always trying to simplify the hassle and reduce the travel time. Normally I catch a non-stop flight to MSP, rent a car, and drive to Int'l Falls, cross over border and stay within a couple hours of border...often fishing after dinner the same day. I'm looking for a new destination. I can fly non-stop to Toronto, rent a car, and travel to ???? within 5-6 hours of the Toronto airport? Looking for suggestions. Want a nice lodge / resort American Plan somewhere north of Toronto that is remote, preferably boat in, with walleye, bass, and pike, decent boats (trolling motors are mandatory for bass and pike fishing), and just a good place for my wife and I. Temagami, Lady Evelyn? Nippising looks too wide open. Any lodge / lake suggestions?"
2933561,adempsey,2014-06-24 22:18:00,963,"Lady Evelyn is your best bet. There are options in Quebec as well, but I am not as familiar with them.I've stayed at both Island 10 and Garden Island Lodge and thought they were outstanding. The nice thing about Lady Evelyn is it is difficult to access, so even though it's only 6 hours from Toronto you won't come across many other boats on the lake. The fishing was good too, especially if you like to target smallmouth bass in addition to walleye.As an alternative some outfitters are flying right out of Thunder Bay."
2933753,north560,2014-06-25 04:56:00,53,"Try Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge, its a 6hr drive north/west of Toronto. Great walleye,small mouth, pike and trout fishing.The boats are 16ft open concept with 25hp 4stroke electric you can fish all day in comfort. web site www.gowbushkon.com. Good food all diet NOTE NO SLOT SIZE FOR WALLEYE"
2934065,bigcreekdad,2014-06-25 06:37:00,74,"French River is about 3-4 hours from Toronto. There are many good american plan lodges on it. I quite like Crane's Lochaven Lodge. Also, the Pickeral River is just south of the French. Camp Wanikewin Lodge is quite reasonable. Another option is any of the Kawartha Lakes, but I don't know any of the Lodges. If you like the Canadian Shield ambience, and fewer people/cottages, the French or Pickeral are, IMO, the places to go. Let us know what you decide."
2934521,micropterus,2014-06-25 08:08:00,450,"The week we were there the lodge had 4 30"" walleye and bunches of 24-28. The catch and release has turned this into a great lake."
2934777,doubleheader,2014-06-25 09:07:00,2652,"Nipissing west arm is very protected water compared to the big lake. It's our annual destination, but also been to Lady Lake Evelyn. Both are excellent destinations, fishing on the Nip can be more difficult than Lady Lake Evelyn without some experience."
2935505,Mikep007,2014-06-25 11:37:00,77,"I've been to Wanikiwin (6 years) on the Pickeral and Lunge Lodge (3 years) on the French -- both great places, reasonably priced (800 - 1050 all in) with good boats and great water. We targeted walleye, bass, pike along with perch, whitefish, and others. Both are boatin (pontoon boats, about 10 - 20 minute ride). American and Housekeeping plans available. There is a difference in fish you can keep based on your license -- Nipissing and the French have been having walleye population issues (plenty of news out there), so this is year Sportsman can keep 2 Walleyes, both have to be bigger than 18.1 inches (they used to have a slot)."
2949665,Rich B,2014-06-29 19:31:00,1081,"Have fished Georgian Bay, the GB North Channel, French River, etc over the years and they were ""OK""....have also fished LLE a number of times, and if I was heading back that way, that's where I would go (Island 10 is a good lodge) for the previously mentioned reasons.Good luck with your decision.Rich B"
2951545,rsiminski,2014-06-30 10:17:00,53,"Hands down, try Lady E!!!!!!!! Garden Island Lodge is one of my favorites. Tons of trophy size walleye and the small mouth fishing is fantastic."
2953313,stillangling,2014-06-30 18:20:00,149,"I will probably generate a few more on-line ""friendships"" but here it goes. The area you are referring to (around North Bay) was home until I moved to NW Ontario 25 years ago. I have many great memories of fishing in that area but when I go home to visit family I never bother to even take a rod. The few times I have fished there since moving have been nothing short of frustrating. My suggestion would be get a flight to Winnipeg, thereby avoiding the hassles at International Falls, drive the 2 1/2 hrs to Kenora. Fish the north/central parts of Lake of the Woods. Or better yet, drive 4 1/2 hrs to Ignace or Sioux lookout and enjoy fishing like it was meant to be. You were driving 10 hrs from Minneapolis before. My suggestion will seem like a walk in the park. Another poster suggested Thunder Bay. That would be okay too but connecting flights will be an issue. If you take that route, make sure you go at least as far west as Ignace. Wash lures for a week or fish the part of the province that is constantly being discussed on this forum. Is that by chance?"
