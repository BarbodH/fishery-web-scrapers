2950329,Brandonkop,2014-06-30 03:10:00,124,I was fishing Pinehurst lake looking for big pike... still looking for one to break 20 pounds. Even though caught some nice onces still have a ways to go. Hopefully I'll find one. Anyways in my search caught some walleye in the shallows and one was really nice on a Rapala Tail Dancer in minnow pattern. Most of the pike were caught on swimbaits. This was the first year I've been using swimbaits and they have really impressed me. Fish hit them so aggressively and I think they believe they are the real deal because they will hit them several times. Here are some video links if you'd like to see the action.
