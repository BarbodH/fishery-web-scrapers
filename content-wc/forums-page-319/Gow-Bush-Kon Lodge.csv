2941929,SinOrSwim,2014-06-27 07:18:00,1528,"Trying not to be ""that guy"" but those are some big fish for keepers? No slot limits on that lake?Sounds like a fun trip though"
2941945,north560,2014-06-27 07:22:00,53,"No slot size, the fish are so healthy that the only restriction is only allowed one over 18"".They did throw back lots of other walleye."
2943681,polaris-pete,2014-06-27 14:58:00,343,"Just wondering why those big fish werent released after catching? We catch them this size all day long on Erie and a pic or 2 and back in they go. We only keep the smaller sized ones for eating.If you need a fish for your Wall, a plastic mount is the way to go.Fish those size take a long time to get that size up North but to each his own I guess."
2943929,north560,2014-06-27 16:08:00,53,"On this lake the fishery is so healthy that it doesn't hurt to take some of the big ones.All week they have been catching all sizes of fish, from 8"" up to the 30"" most are thrown back."
2945129,polaris-pete,2014-06-28 07:23:00,343,Great to hear this lake is still healthy and producing nice fish.Looks like a nice place to try.
2945553,lassh,2014-06-28 09:53:00,553,"There may be a healthy fish population and a good forage base, but I believe that if you are allowing 26 to 30"" fish to be greased, you are negatively impacting that fishery. Think of the impact of removing those big fish genes out of the breeding stock of that lake. That lake is likely to be way more fragile than you think, and the impact of harvesting large females may not be noticeable for years; but it could have a long reaching negative impact on the future fishery. If you are a sportsman and especially if you are an owner, please err to the safe side and encourage keeping smaller fish for eating and replica mounts for trophies. I do not mean to come off as holier than thou, its just how I feel after observing the noticeable change in Canadian fishing quality after protective limits were enacted in Canada. Have a great season!"
2945737,polaris-pete,2014-06-28 11:34:00,343,After fisihng Ontario and Quebec for 36 Years we long long ago started the practice of NOT bringing any fish home with us. We keep a few for a few shore lunches and the ones we do keep are the small males. As I mentioned those big females take a long time to get that big up North and we catch them alot here on Erie and they go back right into the lake after a pic or so!! I have a couple 12 lbers that I had mounted but we took pics and measurements and I had a friend do them in plastic mounts and after 10 years still look like they were just caught and I had the pleasure of releasing these 2 big Girls back! Its a great feeling to catch a fish like this but a better feeling when I see it swim back down! We only buy a Conservation license now and many Camp owners provide them free to their Customers to insure the Lakes keep producing.But then again this is what our group does to help insure the fisheries stay healthy.
2947265,north560,2014-06-29 05:22:00,53,"Amazing, everyone talks about returning the big one to the lake, however when the MNR had a slot size on the lake we heard complaints galore as everything caught was in the slot size. Net surveys show a large portion of big fish in every species in the lake.We encourage everyone to catch enough for a good feed most don't take home any just the menories."
