I'll be the goof ball with all the musky gear, fishing pike. This is our 7th year...first time we've ever lasted more than 5 in one place...Blair and Kathy do a great job, top notch service, GREAT dock, and nice camp boats/motors. See you up there? Steve"
2807953,MorganMan,2014-05-18 09:55:00,341,Couldn't agree more about Blair and Kathy and the camp. That fish cleaning house is incredible. We are heading up for our 4th or 5th year with them? We are a September group typically.
2808249,SinOrSwim,2014-05-18 10:39:00,1528,Make sure to feed the Glaucoma eyed pet walleye!!! I wonder how big it has gotten??? For those that haven't been there the fish cleaning house sits out over the water. You can look out the window straight down and throw dead minnows. Thare are a couple walleye and northern that just sit down there and hang out. One of the walleye is a big ole fatty. You can see it's funky eyes from teh surface sometimes before you see the fish.
2808553,muskyroller,2014-05-18 12:40:00,56,"Can't believe I left out feeding the northerns the dead minnows! It's super cool to see the ""pecking order."" Surprisingly, as soon as the big walleye moves in, even the biggest northerns move aside. Great cabins too. We get the place closest to the docks, overlooking the bay to the right...best cabin in my opinion!"
2808633,MorganMan,2014-05-18 13:21:00,341,"We have only stayed in Cabin 3, the big one right across the drive from where you stay? Has 6 bedrooms and couldn't be nicer in my opinion. Also, close to the dock."
2957033,muskyroller,2014-07-01 17:44:00,56,"Got back last Friday from a week at Blair and Kathy's at Onaway Lodge. Awesome accomodations as always. The ""feeding window"" above the boat house was a sight this year! There were a couple 25 to 26"" walleyes which were nice, BUT there was an absolute giant that ran the show. ALL other fish bowed out of the way when this giant walleye swung on a minnow or hunk of ""beef."" I would venture a guess of 30-32 inches and I think I'd be close on accuracy for this fish...incredible! Walleye fishing was not easy like it has been in years past. We really chased all over the lake to find fish, but when we did, three boats would catch 150+ walleyes in a morning or afternoon. Usual spots were not working so we had to try some other things that we weren't confident in, but that grew quickly when fish started to show up. Northern fishing was the worst it's been in years! I fish hard for jacks out of my boat and I struggled, big time. Typically I'll catch 6-8 northerns from 35"" to 40"" in a week. This week I caught two 35"" and one 36"". That's it. I tried it all, too. Points, sand, weeds (that I could find), shallow back bays, points out of those bays, sheer rock cliff, stumps. The jacks just weren't there. Then on the last day we got into a bunch of smaller fish and the one 36"" in cabbage. I think the high water and colder than usual water temps had the northerns (and walleyes) ""off"" this year. Temps started to level off and weeds were rising...maybe the migration to the cabbage was off a week or two? I looked at Silver Water Wheel's report and we had very similar results for walleyes and northerns...so, I think we're doing something right. Two years in a row their report and our week has lined up very similarly. Good luck to all the rest of this year...Only 353 more days until I'm back at Onaway! Steve"
2958218,Hawkfan,2014-07-02 07:10:00,237,We head up to Onaway in two months. Thanks for the report.
2960346,MorganMan,2014-07-02 17:55:00,341,How high is the water? We are seeing record rainfall in Minnesota so I'm just wondering how Lac Seul compared?
