2953249,MorganMan,2014-06-30 18:02:00,341,"Vidalia onions ARE the bomb!! Cut one end off the onion, then a cross cut but not all the way through, (like they do a bloomin onion) then put a little butter on the top (cut end) and sprinkle beef bullion on top, wrap in foil and put on grill for 45-60 min. Glorious. You know what to do while you wait."
2917057,JesterBreeze,2014-06-19 20:22:00,16,We plan to bring 2 bags of onions with us. Any issues with border crossing?
2917609,btyreprich,2014-06-20 04:00:00,1067,"Any vegetable or fruit that we bring into Canada are always commercially packed - free of dirt. As such, we have never had an issue bring such items into Canada. Let me correct myself - sweet corn would be the one vegetable that is not commercially packed we bring into Canada. Again - no issues crossing the border. Enjoy your trip!"

2918553,forgop,2014-06-20 09:06:00,880,WTH are you taking 2 full bags of onions on a fishing trip in the first place? Planning on having a little walleye to go with your onions?

2931889,JAY221,2014-06-24 14:36:00,877,"Fried potatoes are just not complete without onion & peppers!!! We have fried potatoes EVERY day. Later, Jay"
2931985,Fishin Fun,2014-06-24 15:10:00,218,Nothing better than fried potatoes with onions and fresh walleye. We have that every night. Yum! We've never had issues taking onions across the border.
2932745,btyreprich,2014-06-24 18:22:00,1067,"If you can get Vidalia Onions for the trip, be sure to bring several long. Incredible taste - our group loves them on hot dogs and burgers, mixed in with hash browns, and I'll even make onion rings to go with our steak dinners. These onions also go in our fajitas. A bag four four of us never seems to last the trip."
2935577,patricktjms,2014-06-25 11:55:00,67,"I would review the threads on bringing baby wipes with you also. I love onions and if I have to ruin a pair of boxers every day, its absolutely worth it."
