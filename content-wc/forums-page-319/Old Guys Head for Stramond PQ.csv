They have had heart attacks, cancer, and one has Parkinson's. In their earlier years, they were my mentors. Time for me to give a little something back. We haven't been to this lodge in too many years. I am the driver, boat operator, and guide. Time to hit the road !!!"

Sad to report the walleye fishing cannot be compared to what we had there in the '80s and 90's. Also, the Clova road is in real bad shape. What used to take 2 hours to cover 70 miles, took us 5 hours going in. On the bright side, the lake trout fishing was very good. We kept one each : 24 lbs., 22 lbs., 19 lbs., and 17 lbs. The new cabins at Stramond are the best I have ever stayed in anywhere."
