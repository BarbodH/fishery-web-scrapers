On the way back there was just a little water. If it rains some more there will be several areas flooded again. I always take 71, rather than 502, for my own sanity. Have been on 502 and many sightings of moose and they scare the **** out of me, so i go the chickens way. make about the same time. Anyway, a great week of fishing. Two mornings, 8:30-1:00, close to or at 100 fish. We drag spinners and perch color was great. Several nice northerns during the week also. Had a couple of slower days, but always caught fish. Fish were moving, for awhile they would be in 8 feet, then 11 feet all the way to 5 ft. What a fun time. One after another. Most people were fishing Sawmill, Lunker Point, and heard reports they were moving to Steamboat and Cox. Some in the sanctuary. No problems at the border, just didn't have my Labatts Light in bottles at the duty free store"
