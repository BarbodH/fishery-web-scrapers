2947953,Glenman12,2014-06-29 09:14:00,762,as of Friday we were getting them for the most part in 6 1/2ft to 9ft...did get a few in up to 14ft..
2948065,1/4 oz Jig,2014-06-29 09:51:00,90,Thanks for the info looking forward to a great trip!
2948601,Larry Mac,2014-06-29 14:03:00,530,"Glemman12, great report and it looked like you and your group had another outstanding trip. You guys never cease to amaze me when it comes to Cedar Lake!!!! You are the man!!!!!!!Thank you,Larry Mac"
2900425,nitroman,2014-06-15 18:06:00,368,Just got back from our week and boy what a week it was! The walleye and crappie were on fire. Nearly every place we fished we just killed em. Wind was in our favor and stacked em up on our favorite windy points. Jig and a minnow was the ticket either dropped or pitched it didn't matter. Took my son for his first trip and he had a blast. Lots of fish in the 19 to 28 range and a lot of crappie in the 12 to 14 range. We could of filled our freezer the first day. Without a doubt the best fishing I have ever had on cedar by far!
2900545,Glenman12,2014-06-15 18:36:00,762,Good for you and your son..I hope the bite lasts at least 2 more weeks...are you targeting the crappies or catching them when jigging for walleyes?..send me a PM..
2900969,revitup,2014-06-15 20:49:00,140,"Our group also just returned from Cedar and had similar results to nitroman. We (8 in our group) caught and released 27 fish over 23"" with four over 30"". Had my personal best of 32&1/2"" walleye. We didn't count but had several in the 20-22"" range. Jig and minnow was the ticket although I was successful using jig and leech also. The nice thing in terms of the lake is that we also caught hundreds in the 10-13"" range. We never targeted crappie and just might have to do that next year."
2901289,Pikeslayer8,2014-06-16 00:32:00,1460,Congrats on that PB hog.
2902305,BlueJayBert,2014-06-16 09:07:00,15,What part of Cedar or Nelson were the crappies caught?
2902897,revitup,2014-06-16 10:54:00,140,"Thanks Pikeslayer! My heart was thumping! My biggest before that was 26"" and what a difference! Cedar has become an amazing fishery. Obviously the late ice out put us in a fantastic time period on the lake. Hope your time on the water is fun and safe."
2925737,kvman1959,2014-06-23 07:25:00,45,Cedar lake is on the same page as Cliff lake using anglers atlas.
2946441,Glenman12,2014-06-28 18:10:00,762,"Just got back from a week on Cedar Lake... I could pretty much copy and paste Nitromans report and it would be pretty accurate..by far the best trip ever in numbers and size..cant believe how many over slot fish we caught..at points we were just laughing cause it was so ridiculous..started fishing Saturday and by noon Sunday we had enough for 7 guys for our cabin fish fry..ate that Monday afternoon and then by Tues evening all 7 of us had limits of walleye to bring home with none under 16.5""...our boat and my partners son and son in law each boated well over 400 walleyes..we spent most of our time in Hatfield and Sawmill as those spots produced the most and biggest fish but other spots produced well too... Just a note for those going up soon, on numerous occasions we had walleyes and smallies either crap or puke up crawfish in the boat..that helped with our choice of colors.."
2947705,1/4 oz Jig,2014-06-29 07:42:00,90,Sounds like a great trip! Looking forward to our 1st trip to cedar lake in 2 weeks. Are the fish still shallow or have they started moving out to deeper water?
2947849,wallydave,2014-06-29 08:21:00,2151,Glad you had a fantastic week! Cedar sure sounds like a good lake! Hikes another lake to try! What a shame!
2828649,Terwalleye,2014-05-23 19:50:00,166,"BW, Did you open the PDF? It IS the Cedar Lake south of Perrault. I have used the map."
2828657,Terwalleye,2014-05-23 19:51:00,166,Hey BobWe heading up June 13th and start fishing the 14th. 3 short weeks!!
2830969,1jigfish2,2014-05-25 00:48:00,110,"We just returned from Cedar. We could not get out opening day, too much ice, fished from shore, did pretty good at pipes. We used old camp boat and broke ice for next two days, fished at pipes, did extremely well. Biggest was 29"", spawned out. Water temp was 37 degrees on opening day, when we left yesterday, water temp was 53 degrees Ice was gone by 4th day, could fish anywhere. 4 of us fished, we caught slightly over a thousand walleye. We have counters in boat. Fished pipes most, always produced. Our biggest were a 29"", two 28"", and 49 others over 22"" Most fish still had spawn, only a few were done. Saw walleye spawning in one foot of water, would not bite. Caught fish between 4'-42' regularly. Caught more whitefish than any other time."
2832273,jld235,2014-05-25 18:00:00,11,"This Saturday will be my first time up to Cedar. What are ""the pipes""? I haven't heard guys talk about that yet? I've checked my maps but don't see anything that talks about pipes. Any help would be appreciated. Jeff"
2832513,1jigfish2,2014-05-25 19:50:00,110,"The Pipes are located along the Red Lake Highway. They are the pipes that go under the road, that empty water out of Cliff Lake. That is where water runs the fastest into the lake, at least on the west side. By the time that you get there, spawn should be long done. Fish should be in an eating mood. I would fish the deeper water right outside that area, or any drop. We caught lots of fish there in 35'-42'. Most fish were caught in 10'-22'. Take bug spray, they were getting bad the last two days."
2832537,Walleye_Wrangler,2014-05-25 19:57:00,138,Thanks for the info. Where did you stay?
2832705,1jigfish2,2014-05-25 21:14:00,110,"We stay at Northern Lights Resort, part of Clark's Resorts. They are located in the southeastern part of the west side of the lake. We like it there because they have the best boats and biggest motors on the lake, and you get free bait. That adds up to a big savings."
2859897,nitroman,2014-06-02 20:55:00,368,"Ok Cedar Lake guys what's your bets on the pattern next week? A lot of really warm weather recently and a lot of walleye being caught. Think they will start spreading out or will the post spawn frenzy be strong yet. Looks like a cold front is setting in Friday and then a gradual climb back to low 70's. Hoping for stable weather thru the week. Never fished this late into June before . Will give a report when I get back stateside for all. Terewalleye, and glenman revitup and I will try and leave a few for you guys to clean up but we will do our best to catch them all! Just 3 more days! Tight lines to all!"
2862681,revitup,2014-06-03 14:15:00,140,"I'm thinking they will stay in the post spawn frenzy. I'm looking for and certainly hoping for a repeat of last year's great week. Last year they had not moved onto the humps yet, and we caught most relatively shallow. Nitroman--I look forward to shaking your hand on the lake sometime next week."
2863273,Terwalleye,2014-06-03 16:56:00,166,So far this spring seems to be shaping up to be exactly like last year this time. And that is A OK by me. We found little to no weed growth last year and that really concerned me last year as that was a focal point for us the first couple of years fishing Cedar. So last year we decided to try and focus on rocky spots of wind blown points. (I know that is nothing new for most walleye guys but the light finally went on for me last year) Assuming same conditions we did not find them in super shallow but most fish were caught in the 8 to 12 foot range. Once we caught them in numbers in one spot we were able to pretty systematically find similar spots that produced as well. Managed a few nice crappies in the shallows last year too. Hoping to improve on that a little this year.
2814601,Andyeye,2014-05-20 06:43:00,179,We are headed to Cedar Lake in August. We are staying at Cedar Point Resort. It is my first time to this lake. I was hoping someone could give me some information on where to get good maps of this area and any tips on locations and presentations there in mid August. Thanks.
2815025,rockape,2014-05-20 07:54:00,215,Me too. I leave in 3.5 weeks.
2815185,nitroman,2014-05-20 08:28:00,368,"http://www.adventurefishingmaps.on.ca/nwo1.htm Your best bet for info and where to go would be Ray. I go early June and the fishing will be different when you go so i really can't help you on that. Ray has a pretty great knowledge of the lake and can tell you where, when and what is biting at the time you are there."
2818017,ftfarms,2014-05-20 20:05:00,444,I've fished cedar lake and stayed with cedar point resort also. Last year we went third week in July and done really well on smallmouths and walleyes. I did my best in two spots in Nelson lake and the two shallow reefs on the west side of gull island And after you come out of musky narrows go by the big island two the next two and fish the east side of them. One thing I found was you need to fish slow. I used whisler jigs tip with worm or minnow was my best. Me and my wife caught over 400 walleye and 200 smallmouth for the week. We don't fish that many hour especially that week cause it was so hot. The biggest walleye was 27.5 and smallmouth was 18.5 and yes she caught them both It was a blast and ray is a good guy to talk with. To the guy going in june don't rule out the weed bed in Nelson that back toward the bridge. Fish the right side back towards the north. I've fished a lot of lakes in Canada and cedar is my favorite small lake. Good luck
2820089,Terwalleye,2014-05-21 11:04:00,166,You can download this map as a PDF. Blow it up and get it laminated. I have seen camp maps from three different resorts. I believe they all use the same info as this one. For what it's worth; I double sided my map and put the east side on the front and west side on the back. Once laminated it was easy to hold and look at while driving.http://www.anglersatlas.com/lake/102167
2820257,bigwillies,2014-05-21 11:28:00,515,not the right cedar lake.dont think that website lists the one he's looking for.south of perrualt falls.
2826297,Glenman12,2014-05-22 20:22:00,762,Nitroman...would you post a report when you get back..going up 3rd Sat in June this year...or PM me
2826449,nitroman,2014-05-22 21:18:00,368,Will do sir! We are headed up on the 7th of June as school ran late this year. Taking my 10 year old on his first trip and he is quite excited. My brother in law and I drove up a couple weeks ago just to scratch the itch but all was froze over so the only fishing we got was at Wabigon where it runs under the road. It was cool to see Cedar iced over though.
2826497,Gipper,2014-05-22 21:23:00,76,"Terwalleye, When are you heading up?"
2828265,Walleye_Wrangler,2014-05-23 16:24:00,138,Our group will be there June 14-20. Can't wait.
