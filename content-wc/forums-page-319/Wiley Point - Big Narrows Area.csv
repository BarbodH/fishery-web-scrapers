2938673,Knutson21,2014-06-26 08:50:00,348,LOW was us 2 feet last week when we were there.
2940081,nicko,2014-06-26 16:35:00,508,Thanks. I am getting anywhere from 2-3 ft high. Time to be real careful.
2940097,nicko,2014-06-26 16:39:00,508,Oh I have some spots that are right there. No doubt they will hold fish. I've caught everything within 5 minutes of the dock. If I need to we will. Thx N
2946465,nicko,2014-06-28 18:39:00,508,On our way up. We'll be fishin tomorrow. N
2954953,patricktjms,2014-07-01 08:06:00,67,Any good news from the area? We are leaving Friday to head up there.
2891609,Wallii1,2014-06-12 13:01:00,37,Cranks shallow caught the big fish. Worked spinners in deeper water and caught smaller fish
2891889,nicko,2014-06-12 14:49:00,508,"Much appreciated. If this cool weather holds they should still be there shallow. If not, we'll move out deeper. Thanks for the report. What was the water temp any idea? N"
2928529,nicko,2014-06-23 18:11:00,508,Any more reports from this area? Thanks N
2928601,stillangling,2014-06-23 18:25:00,149,"Fished in the general area on the weekend for the opener of musky. Tough fishing. Seeing fish was not the problem, getting them to commit was. Temps in the back bays were around 66F. Fish were very sluggish. We could see fish that we're not even following our baits. Just lying there. This weekend should be good but they will still be in very skinny water."
2928745,nicko,2014-06-23 19:11:00,508,I assume you saw musky correct? I think eyes may still be shallow but some reports have them on the move. In current or transitioning to humps in areas. I hear smallies are slow. Thanks for report.
2929833,deadhead1,2014-06-24 06:05:00,193,Find current you will find walleye. They are starting to move now as spawn seems to be over. Getting a few on the humps. I was in the area on the weekend.
2932361,nicko,2014-06-24 16:24:00,508,Awesome. How high is the lake? I hear up to 3 ft over norm? Good to know. Leaving in 4 days. Thanks N
2934953,deadhead1,2014-06-25 09:55:00,193,Yes lake is stupid high but doesn't seem to effect the fish except that they are late getting to their summer humps.
2936017,nicko,2014-06-25 13:36:00,508,awesome...thanks for the info...Looking forward to getting up there next week....
2938641,deadhead1,2014-06-26 08:40:00,193,If wind comes up stay right in Wiley Bay.
2883169,nicko,2014-06-10 06:40:00,508,Heading out to Wiley Point June 28-July 5. Any fishing reports from the Big Narrows Area. This is our 3rd year out in that area and the last 2 have been awesome weeks. This year looks to be quite different as the temps are only in the low 70's and 50's at night. Has anyone been in the area? Water Temps? Walleye still shallow or have they started to migrate to their summer mid-lake humps? Any info would be great......Thanks...N
2888273,nicko,2014-06-11 12:13:00,508,"Wow 125 looks and not one person fishing this area..... At this point, I may be the first one to fish it this year!!!"
2888489,1shooter,2014-06-11 13:34:00,1493,That's because that area is fished out.
2888921,Wallii1,2014-06-11 16:18:00,37,I was east of there last week. Walleyes were shallow. They hadn't moved to early summer spots yet. water temps were low up to 64 degrees when sun hit the shallow bays.
2889017,JMKC,2014-06-11 17:07:00,238,"Walli is right on, I am up in Northeast Lake of the Woods right now, fishing is great !!! JJ"
2889201,nicko,2014-06-11 18:35:00,508,Thanks guys. It looks like a warmup is headed for up there soon. Much appreciate the info. Are you jigging or pulling bouncers with spinners or trolling? Assuming shallow is in 6-10 ft ?
2889689,Jesse-WI,2014-06-11 21:23:00,534,Never fished walleye in that area but large eyes have a tendencies to hit muskie baits if you happen to be around points or the buoys when there is a good chop on the water.
2889937,Gunner_Fletch,2014-06-12 04:21:00,74,Fished out??? What are you smokin?....lol
2889977,nicko,2014-06-12 05:08:00,508,There's always gotta be one guy who responds that way. One in every crowd.
2889985,nicko,2014-06-12 05:11:00,508,"Yup...... We fish the cans and points relentlessly. Lots of them to choose from. Last year all the muskies wanted small baits. The #5 Mepps was the ticket. One of the other guys caught his 55"" on that bait. Thanks...n"
