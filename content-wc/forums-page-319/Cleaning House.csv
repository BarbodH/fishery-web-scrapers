First two years we were buys with fixing up the main house and docks to bother with a fish cleaning hut. We would clean the fish in the boat house and get eatenr alive by the bugs after dark We built a small screen in house with an old kitchen sink in it Put up a good overhead light, shelves for holding a beer, coat hooks for rain gear. We installed solar power lights on the roof and over the door that just keep on workin We started writing on the wall basic fish stats for the day, nukmber of fish caught and released, fish kept and cleaned. Makes for some interesting reading. Best weekend sent working a project"
