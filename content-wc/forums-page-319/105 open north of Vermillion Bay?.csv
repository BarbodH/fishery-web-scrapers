2935105,stumcfar,2014-06-25 10:29:00,451,"I had friends that came home last Saturday. They said they drove thru a small amount of water in one area, but the road was not closed. Not sure if things have gotten worse since then, but I would doubt it."
2936729,yoopertrout,2014-06-25 16:17:00,1172,"We also came through last Saturday. There was one place with water on the road that was about 10"" deep. The rivers up there were all blown. Hopefully they'll get a little dry weather and the problems will end. Good luck!"
2939113,rockape,2014-06-26 10:43:00,215,"Drove through it last Friday night. There are highway workers with big time lights before the detour. Talked to the guy. He said there was about a foot of water. We had your standard truck and boat. Said to stay in the middle and we would be fine. He spoke the truth. No way a car could get through though. If they have had rain this week, it is probably still flooded."
2946337,Glenman12,2014-06-28 17:36:00,762,Same experience last Friday with two trucks pulling boats and got thru with no problem...coming home yesterday the road was clear but with all the water on the sides a good rain could flood it again..same with 17 going East out of VB...
