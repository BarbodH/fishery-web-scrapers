Some air services can no longer haul any external loads. It is important to check with your air service to make sure that their floatplanes can legally haul external loads. Each floatplane is legal for only certain sizes of boats, canoes and kayaks. The external loads also cut down the total amount of weight the aircraft can take. At Viking Outpost Air, we can legally haul a 18 foot canoe on our Cessna 185 and a 16 foot canoe with our De Haviland Beaver. Call us for details at 807-727-2262"
