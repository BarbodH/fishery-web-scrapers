I'm very comfortable fishing jigs, but just havent ever used spinners before, and want to be sure I'm prepared.Can anyone offer some basic points to keep in mind? Length of the leader, color & size blade, how much and what style weights to use- etc. Any information will help us out, and nothing is too basic to be of use. Can we troll them the same way we usually slowly backtroll with our jig & twister rigs?Also- suggestions on where to buy, and how much to spend on them (or should we just learn to tie our own)- how many of these will you lose to rocks and pike? Similar to jigs? Its a LONG 40 days to our trip and nothing seems to speed up the wait, so thanks in advance for helping us get ready for our trip. We've waited and saved two years for this, and I hope it will be the best yet."

See.....favorite beer, best lakes, camps, minnows vs crawlers, live vs gulp, and the ever popular Passport debate . You could get enough answers to your questions to make you more confused than you were before you asked. So...I will chime in, because I backtroll spinner rigs most of my time on the water for walleye.I tie my own, but any pretied rigs will work. I like the holographic colorado spinners. Color in my opinion depends on water clarity and sunlight. I use both minnow and multi hook crawler harnesses. I plan on going thru 6 rigs per day per guy, sometimes more, some days not, better too have enough. If you tie your own remember that the longer the leader the higher off the bottom you will be trolling, the spinner makes the rig run higher in the water column. I run mine about 24 to 30"" long. Backtroll weed edges, points and drops, particularly wind blown. And the speed is as slow as you can go that keeps the blade spinning.Remember, when beginning the run, don't cast the spinner, rather open the bail and let the rig drop while moving, giving it time to get to the bottom and have about a 30 to 45 degree line angle to the surface. Doing this will avoid tangles and keep everything in line. Lastly, when someone gets a hit, the motor goes into nuetral and everybody else in the boat retrieves thier rig. You will most often snag when the bait rests on the bottom during fish-on times and tight inside turns.Hope this helps, get ready for some ""TRIED TO TAKE THE ROD FROM MY HANDS"" Hits."
1105794,fishman10,2009-05-17 22:48:00,226,"well i cant agree with steve any more! my number 1 colour is hammered gold, and i also like the holograghic blades. troll worms with double snells with instant hook sets and jig for a change up. the fish are waiting and enjoy youself."
1105831,tparker,2009-05-18 07:11:00,100,"Baitslinger, What camp will you be staying at on your Nungesser Lake trip?"
1105846,JimSticks,2009-05-18 08:11:00,11,"I only use 4 spinners rigs in Canada in general (large hammered gold, medium hammered gold, large chart, medium chart), also I think it is good to add that the rigs with an extra stinger hook make it a little easier when first starting out. Finally make sure you have a variety of different weight bottom bouncer for wind conditions and depths. In Late June you should be finding alot of fish 15-20'. good luck.http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/links/link.jsp?id=0019556118005a&type=product&cmCat=SEAR CH_all&returnPage=search-results1.jsp&Ntk=Products&QueryText=bottom+bouncer s&sort=all&Go.y=0&_D%3AhasJS=+&N=0&Nty=1&hasJS=tru e&_DARGS=%2Fcabelas%2Fen%2Fcommon%2Fsearch%2Fsearc h-box.jsp.form23&Go.x=0&_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1"
1106077,RonL,2009-05-18 20:47:00,4,"When using bottom bouncers, use the rule of thumb of 1 oz for every 10 ft of water. If you plan to pull spinners at varying depths make sure you have the weight necessary and enough rod spine to handle the weight and still detect a bite. Pull the bottom bouncer so that it just ticks the bottom. Don't be too shy to pull a leach or even tip a minnow with a crawler. I find dakota blades to be preferable since they will spin at a slower speed. Good luck and have fun."
1106100,Baitslinger,2009-05-18 22:32:00,93,"Thanks for the advice thus far. Got some basic ideas. We'll be at Birch Point Camp.My understanding was that I should be using in-line weights rather than bottom bouncers. Am I way off with that idea?For those that tie their own, do you pretty much tie them as you need them? (I'm quick with knots during daylight at least), or how do you store an assortment of sizes & colors. Speaking of size-- what hook size and style are they best tied on?"
1106106,steve03,2009-05-18 23:45:00,22,"Hi, Baitslinger we go to Nungesser every year and we stay at Nungesser Lake Lodge. We start out by trolling for walleye and we use chartruese little joes and they work best for us at this lake. Also orange, and silver are very good but chartruese seems to be the best. Ours are pre-packaged and are 24 inches long. Minnows seem to be the go to bait here also. This is an awesome walleye lake, they are not hard to find fish the windy side of the lake."
1106140,new hips,2009-05-19 06:52:00,498,"Baitslinger, I use Gold blades a lot, Cabela's especially sunny days the flash is unbelievable. I make my own bottom bouncers (they will be 20-30' Down) using 1 1/2 oz to 2oz weight. Last year on Red Lake we back trolled a 3way swivel 1 1/2 oz walking sinker and about a 6ft leader and a soft floating jig head with leech or half crawler. I use 4lb fireline for walleyes ( it's the best). If walleyes just rap at it, drop the rod tip back at them, about a foot or two and they will inhale it. Making your own is easy, get quick change clevis and Gamatsu red hooks and beads 24"" to 30"" long. I make mine in winter and put one rig in a baggie. You might want to use florocarbon for snells. I figure about 2-3 rigs a day lost to snags. Hit bottom, couple cranks up and raise and lower to make sure your near bottom, baitcasters work great for bottom bouncers, I leave bail open with my thumb on reel, so if you snag just get in back and pull out of rocks. Again 4lb fireline, will give max sensitivity and you can use less weight, (no line resistence in water).Hope this helps......."
