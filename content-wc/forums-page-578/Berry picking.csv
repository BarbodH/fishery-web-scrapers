I have been going to Ontario (Ignace area) around the last week in August and found acre upon acre of berries, usually in areas that had been clear cut 3-4 years previously. Summer weather has an effect on when they are at their peak."
1106674,Bigfishhunter,2009-05-20 18:38:00,803,"Yep, August is the best time to go. Berries need lots of water through the summer, so the more rain we get the more and bigger berries there are."
1106759,Obabikon,2009-05-21 05:52:00,2370,"We're just across the border, but ours go from the middle of July to the middle of August. If you run across a bear, just put down the berries and slowly back away! Nobody'll get hurt! LOL That's all they want at that time of year."
