I'd like to bring up some plastics for fishing and am wondering what your favorite plastics are for targetting the walleyes there. I recall seeing a Lindy show awhile back and they were using their Munchies Thumpin' Grub and doing quite well. Also, what jig/plastic color combination do you find successful?Thank you."

We targeted fish in 2-6' depth and just casted and slowly brought back to the boat. The hits were like they show on TV. They were hard, fast, and hooked well. If I only had one bait to use for the rest of my life there, that would be it!"

Pumpkinseed color (I think, they were kind of a dull yellow). They have a nice gliding action when cast out, let sink, then sweep them in, not really ""jigging"" There were times they outfished twistertails by a good margin, but twisters can work very well too."
