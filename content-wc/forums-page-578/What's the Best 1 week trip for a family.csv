I have been doing a lot of ""surfing"" and printing since some of your responses. Got a great start on my vacation folder. Thanks very much !! Just a thought after reading one of the posts: Would most of you recommend getting a guide for one or two of the days? Or do most of you rely on your fising expertise. I'm guessing brandnew waters with a limited amount of time may bring some pressure packed fishing if I'm just guessing...."
1105129,muskiemamma,2009-05-14 22:57:00,6,You might want to try Moosehorn Lodge. THe fishing is awesome and the hospitality is great. www.canadafish.com
1105130,muskiemamma,2009-05-14 22:59:00,6,If you are fishing new water I think taking a guide for at least one day is the right thing to do. Especially if you have to ay for damages on a motor. The guide is a cheaper alternative.
1106213,Guest,2009-05-19 10:29:00,0,"My Wife and I have fished Lac Seul for the last 12 years. The first two years we hired a guide twice during the week. It was well worth it. We not only learned how to fish the lake, but gained knowledge of some of the hazards and where to avoid them. As the guide took us to various spots I followed along on a map marking whatever seemed important. From those experiences we gained the knowledge and confidence to push out on our own. We now travel about 45 mi. from the resort and continue to explore new areas every year. I highly recommend you hire a guide for one or two days. It should make your trip much more enjoyable."
1106252,Mohleye,2009-05-19 13:07:00,368,"I would post the guide question again once you have chosen your destination. The Gull Rock chain for example (which by the way I would highly recommend as a fit for what you're seeking) is well marked for navigation, and your camp owner should provide a map and mark it up with some good spots to fish. I think several of the camps offer summer family packages which might put it within your budget. I don't think hiring a guide would be necessary at a destination like this."
1106629,StCroixfishingMN7,2009-05-20 15:54:00,35,"I would recommend the voyageurs national park area in minnesota along with International falls and lake of the woods. if you would like canadian fishing areas such as Dryden, Kenora and Atikokan are all fantastic. just check with the local resorts and take your pick."
1104943,darin,2009-05-14 08:30:00,650,"I am looking for something that might not exist, but I thought I'd take a stab at it. My wife enjoys being in the boat and even doing a little fishing, but not like my kid and me... We enjoy fishing walleyes with an occasional fry, but would also like getting into smallies and northerns? My wife would hang in the boat on warm sunny days, but is there nearby shopping and ""other lady like things"" for her to do if she doesn't want to fish some days? I'd come from Wisconsin and bring my boat. Would need a dock and most amenities (electricity, running water, etc). Love to hear any suggestions... thanks much!!"
1104948,Larry Mac,2009-05-14 08:50:00,530,"Hi Darin, do you want to stay in the States or Canada?Thank you,Larry Mac"
1104951,darin,2009-05-14 09:22:00,650,"Wouldn't matter in the least... Just want a nice cozy cabin for one or two families, docks, shopping, great fishing, ... this would not be the trip ""the guys"" take... Not that I wouldn't do one of those."
1104959,Larry Mac,2009-05-14 09:58:00,530,"Hi Darin, IMHO I would recommend in Canada and there are many (as you will probably see in the future replies) places to go. Pine Sunset lodge on Dinorwic Lake;http://www.pinesunsetlodge.com/index.htmThe Red Lake Area in general And in the States The International Falls AreaI believe with some research you and your family will find what you want. Have a great TripThank you,Larry Mac"
1104973,Gary from Iowa,2009-05-14 10:46:00,74,"I am reaching here since I'm a bachelor. I think resorts near Fort Frances/International Falls, Kenora, Ontaro, Dryden, Ontario and Red Lake, Ontario might offer some shopping and opportunities to eat out as well as golf and hiking. I would check for lakes that offer smallmouth bass as well as northerns and walleyes. I assume that you want a drive in resort so your spouse can get off the lake and do her thing. There may be a bed and breakfast for you all too. The opportunity to socialize arround breakfast with other guests may have more appeal to your wife than listening to fisherman discussing fishing techniques and fishing location.Good luck,Gary"
1104976,darin,2009-05-14 11:02:00,650,"I like the bed and breakfast idea... I should mention, I'm thinking somewhere around the 1K mark in terms of green backs... not sure if that is possible or not..."
1105005,Family fisherman,2009-05-14 12:22:00,49,"If looking at going to canada, we have stayed here with my family. http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/ If you bring your own boat it will be 1000 for a week. Nice place and with dryden not far away, good shopping, Also just outside of vermillion bay. My wife and daughters really liked it. Nice place"
1105012,Gary from Iowa,2009-05-14 12:43:00,74,"Regarding your one week trip. You might try a two day stay at a bed and breakfast and select from activities other than fishing: canoeing, horseback riding, shopping, golf, etc. You could then go to a resort that offers daily rates as well as weekly rates. Pick the number of days you want to stay and how many services you want-American plan or housekeeping and/or to a restaurant for a meal(s). This is a family trip with fishing, not a fishing trip, so accomodations may be of a higher priority than a guys fishing trip. I believe there are resorts in Morson (on Lake of the Woods) and Fort Frances (Rainy Lake) that offer daily rates. There are so many places to fish in Canada. Relax and enjoy.Gary"
1105016,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-14 13:05:00,138,"Take a look at Moosehorn Lodge in Sioux Lookout, On. It is a drive-in resort with great fishing and fantastic staff. Also they have some of the best guides (Colin, Greg) in the area.HTML Code:http://www.canadafish.com/"
1105091,rebs,2009-05-14 19:38:00,7587,"Oneida Lake NY great walleye and smallmouth, shopping close by and other things to do Anglers bay Cottages clean cozy and well equiped with heat and air condotioning, they have docks to leave your boat in the water. very reasonable rates Its one of my favorite vacation places"
