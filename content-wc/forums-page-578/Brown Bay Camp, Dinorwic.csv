1105329,elkman99,2009-05-15 18:02:00,180,"well, it seems nobody has fished the lake out of this camp. So, I have one more question. If we choose to drive up to Lac Seul for a day from Dinorwic, I hear there is a launch around Vaughn Bay, is this true? I went there when I was little back in the 80's and the walleye fishing was unbelievable. Thanks for any help! Tony"
1105340,Skywagon,2009-05-15 19:20:00,1106,"Hi Tony,If you want to catch walleye, you have the right idea on Lac Seul. Deception Bay would be the closest point to put in. It is 5 miles or so, North of Sioux Lookout and an hour from your departure point. Margaret will have a map with places to try, but more importantly, will keep you well fed with goodies. If you would be looking for a guide on Lac Seul, PM me and I can make a recomendation."
1105849,Babamel2,2009-05-18 08:27:00,414,I have stayed at Brown Bay and fished for Pike and walleye on Dinorwic. For Muskie I would go to Wabigoon. check with the locals for what spots may be best.Brown Bay is a well run camp the facilities have improved greatly in recent years. Act responsible and you will have a great time and the staff will treat you like family. Get drunk and act stupid and be prepared to go home early.
