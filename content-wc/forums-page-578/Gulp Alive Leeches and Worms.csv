1106067,Fishin Fun,2009-05-18 20:35:00,218,My personal experience that that they do not perform as well as live bait. I've used them a couple of times and have not had a lot of success with them.
1106087,Steve of Madison,2009-05-18 21:11:00,230,"I know the question was about Gulp, but there is available packaged real leeches, dead of course, from a place in Amherst WI. I am wondering if these have been used by anyone with success similar too or even better than Gulp. With the price of leeches last year hovering around $40-$45/per pound, I am also looking for an alternative to use."
1103619,Jahloaf,2009-05-09 09:47:00,74,"Is this stuff worth the $19.99 a container? I have heard some positive reports on it. How many leeches are in a container? Does it outfish live leeches? What about the worms? For $20 I can buy alot of real crawlers so are they worth the cost? I am skeptical of them because of the cost, but if some people can tell me they are as good as advertised I would like to try them. (anything that will give me an advantage over my fishing buddies is worth it too)"
1103621,Jimmy Jig,2009-05-09 10:18:00,1905,"You do caught fish at times,anyway. They have not outfished live bait for me. I have them in the boat just in case............."
1103639,Larry Mac,2009-05-09 11:32:00,530,"Hello Jahloaf, If you have not done so already do a search using Gulp as your key word and see the amazing converstions, comments and opinions on this product. I am amazed at how passionate our fisherman are about this product. Below is a response I posted in the past commenting on Gulp. I must say I do always have it with me whether I have the need to use it or not. Have a great year.""I realize this was not a Gulp VS. Live bait thread but I must agree with the previous post. We prefer Live or Dead minnows over Gulp or any other artificial plastics. Our experience has been live bait out fishes Gulp. IMHO Gulp is the best soft plastic bait on the market. They are trying to duplicate live bait! Gulp is more durable and stays on the hook longer than live bait. We use Gulp on portage lakes when we cannot transport or run out of live bait. There are also lakes we fish that do not allow live minnows. We are jig fisherman and of course I would prefer not to use live bait if I can duplicate the live bait results. Please if there is a silver bullet with gulp fishing techniques please help. Have a great year.""Thank you,Larry Mac"
1103642,Jahloaf,2009-05-09 11:38:00,74,"Larry Mac, thanks for the suggestion on the search, never gave it a thought!...."
1103650,Pile-It,2009-05-09 12:23:00,3,"sitting on the dock side by side with the resort owner last year I tried the gulp minnows while he was using live minnows...he caught 5 or 6 to my one. If you dont have the live bait option then they might be the ticket but after seeing the difference I would stick with the live minnows...then again what do I know, Im mostly after the pike when Im up there. I know the question was baout the leeches or crawlers but I would think thats the case with them as well."
1103689,new hips,2009-05-09 16:53:00,498,"Well last year we had a good bite day going, ended up with about 75-100 walleyes. I pulled out the gulp alive 3-4 in leech. They would rap at it but only had 1 taker in about 45min to an hour. So I'm not really to convinced, when I switched back to a real leech started get them again. I will trying them again, I'm taking a fly-in this July (North Seal River ) can't wait !!!!!!!"
1103698,Larry Mac,2009-05-09 18:04:00,530,"IMHO, when it comes to fishing artificial or live baits, I believe the song that says ""There's nothing like the real thing baby "" When walleye fishing Live bait has continuously and substantially outperformed artificial baits on our trips.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1103700,Jigmatt,2009-05-09 18:24:00,9,"We've found that if the 'eyes are biting well , it works good, but on an average bite, they tend to hit and spit it. We'll use it if we run out of minnows, but prefer live bait. The one up side we see is that it stays on the jig alot longer than live minnows. Best alternative to live bait on the market."
1103765,McQ,2009-05-10 06:21:00,615,"I fish remote areas of Quebec throughout the season and up here live minnows are not allowed so leeches are probably the #1 bait choice and crawlers #2. When Gulp was first introduced I had the opportunity to fish the Gulp Nightcrawlers extensively and in semi-controlled fishing situations (heads up against my partner fishing live bait) found that while live crawlers produced more fish (about 1 1/2 - 1) the Gulp product seemed to attract the bigger fish. The introduction of the Alive line of product especially the 5"" leeches on a harness has become my go-to for a couple of reasons. My catch rate is equal to what I achieved with live crawlers and I'm not replacing the bait every time a fish is boated. The non scientific cost analysis I've performed puts the $ ratio at par with live bulk leech purchases without the necessary time spent to maintain the freshness of live bait. Overall the convenience and $ value of the Alive leech makes it a good choice. Early in the season the 3"" Alive minnows are a must for jigging and as the weather improves I'll move up to the 4"". Color choice depends on your confidence level but I find the emerald shiner #1 in the 3"" and shad #1 in the 4"". I've been experimenting with artificial baits for many years and have worked out some techniques in presentation that consistently produce fish. Add to the mix the ease of transportation and the fact there is no maintenance required makes the Berkley lineup my primary bait choice. My recommendation to any serious angler is to include both the Gulp & Alive products in your tackle bag, give them a fair shot and as your confidence level rises you too will come to appreciate the versatility and effectiveness of these baits."
1103775,Bill Krejca,2009-05-10 07:20:00,6107,"Fishing at O'Sullivan Lake near Nakina last year in July, our bait of choice was the 3"" or 4"" Gulp minnow on a jig head. Those who had minnows stopped using them and switched to Gulp early in the week. We caught many,many fish and lots in the mid to high 20's (""). Smelt finish seemed to work best. Like with most baits/presentations, where one fishes can make a difference in success rate, as fish preferences seem to vary considerably. We'll be bringing plenty of Gulp when we return mid-July.
