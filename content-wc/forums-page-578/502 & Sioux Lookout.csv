1105683,Rhinehart,2009-05-17 14:54:00,4,Heading to SL next week and wondered if the thaw was far enough along to see what condition 502 was in between Ft. Francis and SL. Also may drive a diesel fueled truck and wanted to know if diesel is available in SL. I looked on a current fuel price website for the province and SL and it didn't list any prices for diesel. Thanks.

1105771,LIKEWALLEYE,2009-05-17 20:42:00,70,I asked people on this site what the conditions of 502 are. I was wondering if it was dont getting a face lift on the roughest 19 miles. Yes it was complete. As far as diesel fuel prices. I can tell you it will be cheaper than last year. 1.35 a liter which makes it 5.13 a gallon. Should be pretty good this year i hope.
1105772,Woollybob,2009-05-17 20:43:00,158,Diesel is available in Sioux Lookout. I drive a diesel there every year.
