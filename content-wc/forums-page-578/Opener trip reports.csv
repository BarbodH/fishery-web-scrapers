1105793,fishman10,2009-05-17 22:41:00,226,"we fished the dog river on sunday. fishing was good. the fish were very slow. we had to use 1-8 ounce jigs and really slow presentations. but limits in an hour. beautiful day on sunday, not like saturday."

The water temp dropped from about 45 degrees to 40 degrees and the best fishing for walleyes has been with jig/minnow combos fished SLOWWWWWWW. Fish are post-spawn and scattered, but will be starting to group up now with hopefully warming water temps and bait concentrations. Went out last night myself and got seven nice walleyes in just under two hours, keeping a couple for that first walleye dinner of the season! Not fast and furious, but steady with some nice healthy fish. Have seen some decent lake trout and whitefish this week and some pike between 35-40"" too. Just tonight had two guys in a group come in with a very impressive catch of jumbo perch their second such catch so far this week. Fifty-one perch in tonights catch weighing in at 31.5 pounds."
