6711395,GeoFish,2023-02-02 19:05:00,70,As I said you either need kidling or something. Most camps I have stayed in gave you diesel fuel.Wet wood needs something.
6682900,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-29 14:29:00,240,"I went on my first August trip this summer, and was really pleasantly surprised by the lack of bugs and the excellent sleeping weather. Went on August 14-20. Am going to be taking an August trip from here on out. Another nice bonus is that a lot of outfitters have openings in August that were just not there a month previously. Am looking at Antenna Lake with Clark's for next August. Why? They only require 2 guys...... Anyone ever been to Antenna??"
6682908,Larry S,2022-08-29 15:40:00,665,"michigan walleye guy My sister & I were suppose to go to Antenna May28-June4 this year. Clarks over booked the lake ,the other party-2 guys had been there 3 years previously ,so we told Clark's they could have the booking. We ended up on Pusher Lake, had a Great time. Only bad thing was the weather Cold & Windy. We did very well over 400 fish and one pike at 40 inches If you get to book Antenna ,I have a detailed Map sent to me by a guy who has fished Antenna over 10 times and will send to you if you want it Larry S"

6682960,kona77,2022-08-29 18:59:00,236,"Michigan Guy- I have fished Antenna twice and my buddy still fishes it every year. My buddy is a 'gator guy"" and for a small lake Antenna has a really good population of nice gators. Example- We caught 24 gators over 34"" on our trip in 2015. Walleye fishing is good and one of the nice things about Antenna is the deepest water is right in front of the cabin. Great spot to sit at night on the dock and catch walleye's after a day of fishing the lake. The marked up map on the Clarks site shows most of the best walleye spots but we found a few more. Trips were always first week of June. The Clarks have a blog on their site and they used to post weekly fishing reports. You can look at our reports (and pictures) from June 6-13, 2015..June 4-11th, 2016, June 3-10, 2017. would be happy to answer any other question on the lake/facilities."

6682740,kona77,2022-08-28 22:46:00,236,"GEOFIsh- Glad you had an overall good experience and happy you could take your pups along on the trip. On the weight issue, I have been going on Canada trips for over 30 years now and one thing our group always does is weigh our stuff before we leave. No surprises at the outfitter then. There are a bunch of things to do to get your weights down and that includes keeping your fishing gear to a minimum. Really just a bunch of jigs and some trolling hard baits and a few gator spoons with some plastics are all you need. Reddemon- Sorry you had a negative experience with the Clarks. As far as the weight/scale issue I know the Clarke's scale matched our own weights this past JUne.(and all of our past trips)."
6682754,prov1800,2022-08-29 04:36:00,5010,Glad you caught some fish.The hump is a very good spot but there are many more spots to fish on the lake.Did you get into pusher lake.There is a hump there as well and lots of spots also and a nice trip between the lakes.There is usually lots of firewood there.Just need to split some and make some kindling and use some birch bark to start a fire for stove and outside fire.
6682788,Larry S,2022-08-29 07:09:00,665,GeoFish How heavy are your dogs? How much dog food did you bring? This might be part of the overweight problem. Larry S
6682808,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-08-29 07:50:00,240,"It's not hard to be overweight if you are packing a few extra cases of water and three cases of beer. That's 100 pounds right there. Inexperienced packers usually also have heavy coolers (with ice), giant tackle boxes, 4 extra rods and reels, a backpack full of books and magazines. That's another 50-75 pounds. It does not take much...... One rule I have for my group(s) is that we pre-order beer, pop, and water. If I am flying twice a summer with the same outfitter, I also bring a few boxes with crisco, beans, catsup/mustard, etc., that the outfitter can fly in with the beverages. I always bring a few bait tamers for the minnows, but, in August, they don't last long no matter what. Not being able to bring one's own crawlers is a pain--the 1/2 flats we bought on two occasions this summer were woefully under-conditioned, scrawny, half-dead, etc.Does anyone have recommendations for getting good crawlers between FF and Nestor Falls? I would appreciate any advice. Thanks."
6682816,GeoFish,2022-08-29 08:41:00,70,"They did not weigh the dogs.Just enough dog food for 7 days.Two cases of water 56 Lbs. I could cut another 25 Lbs.Don't take this the wrong way but I do not care about 150 lbs over weight. Only $150. I only do this once a year so I am going to take enough to be comfortable. I spent about 2k just getting to Clark's and back home. This was diesel, 7 nights camping, cold food for fly in, fishing licenses. Another 3k for clarks, so what is $200.I do care about the minnows, BBQ grill and firewood. I have a plan for all 3, so all is good."

Eckholt- That is where we got our crawlers and I also use an empty styrofoam cooler with bedding.Once again, my error for not checking the crawlers. I just threw them in the cooler and laid the newspaper/ice on top. At least 50% of the crawlers were useless when I checked them at our overnight stay 5 hours later.

They charge $2,230 per person, they do supply the food, but I did not spend $200 on food but if I did at 2,230 per person, they are $1,660 + tax more. What am I getting for this much more?

I would think that the weight of the dogs should be part of your weight allotment/over weight. Did you bring in a size 31 12 volt battery for the depth finder as well? Either your dogs were part of the weight, their scales are off or you need one heck of a lesson about packing for a trip."

I have seen groups that probably had over 245 lbs in just beer alone but these groups were larger than 2. I have experienced that you could pre-order beer from your outfitter and then they would fly it in early when they had available room on the plane with out charging beyond the case cost of the beer. I am not sure if any one still provides this service. Stealing some one else's beer in the shed at a fly-in camp is much worse than budding in line at the border when the line is plus 2 hours long.

6682586,GeoFish,2022-08-28 11:19:00,70,"Just got back from a one-week trip to Wapesi with Clarks Resorts. I am going to talk about the good and the not so good. We took three days to drive to International Falls with our camper and two dogs. Crossing the border, I got the dreaded chicken ticket. Yes, I am now an illegal chicken smuggler. LOL. Stayed that night at Cliff Lake campground and drove over to Clarks the next morning. Clarks allows you 100Lbs of gear per person so for two should have under 200 Lbs. Well, our total weight was 445 Lbs. Yes, that's correct 445 Lbs. Megan did not charge us for being overweight, because we had a larger plane, this was our first trip with Clarks and because I am such a charming person, LOL. The weather was a little cold for us at night coming from Kentucky. The bugs were almost nonexistent. The first three days we dodged the rain, not a lot but some. Took us 1 ½ day to find the sunken island, but when we did, fishing at Upper Wapesi was like catching fish in a barrel. Since we had two dogs, if my wife caught a fish, I needed to bring in my line, hold the dogs back (from falling in the lake as they tried to bite the fish), see picture. She did the same if I caught a fish. We would lay our pole down with the jig and minnow hanging in the water. At least 12 times a walleye would come up from 12 feet deep and grab the bait right next to the boat. I have had that happen with pike, but never with walleye. We caught fish in 9 to 17 feet of water. Now we did have some slow times, maybe only caught 6 fish per hour but those times were few. On many occasions, if we dropped our jig to the bottom, click the real we had a fish. Most of the fish were between 15 to 18 with a lot of smaller fish. The biggest was 25 caught on the last evening. I debated on bring my depth finder, glad I did since the fish changed depths multiple times. Even went from 12 feet to 9 feet in the middle of the day. Now for the not so good; 1. They do have a minnow issue. They used a 5-gal bucket, load it with about 6 dozen minnows and sink it to the bottom of the lake. Within one day ½ of the minnow were dead and by day two they all were dead. On one delivery, I put about ½ of the minnows in the boat minnow bucket and the other ½ in the bucket. I modified the 5-gal bucket bringing the top above the water surface, see picture. All the minnows in the boat bucket lived overnight and I only had 3 dead minnows in the bucket. I also think the holes in the bucket are two small compared to the boat bucket. 2. I had a wood stove for heat, but no ash shovel or bucket. Did not have any dry cut firewood. I kind of expect dry firewood and a way to start a fire. Most camps I have stayed at also gave you diesel fuel to start the fire. 3. The BBQ grill was unusable, the grates were so rusted, when I tried to clean them with a wire brush they broke! OK, I understand they have not had any income for two years and they could not keep everything upgraded the way they may like. I do like Clarks and booked a trip for next year. Going to try Okanse lake in August again."
