6712211,prov1800,2023-02-05 11:44:00,5010,Me to or might have been up to throw couple logs in &#x1f525;
6712213,Eckohlt,2023-02-05 11:49:00,3685,Right!!
6712229,RichA$1970,2023-02-05 12:42:00,1159,I think Howey Bay resort has the cabins on the south end of the lake open for business as I think the Geary’s got their tit in a ringer rightfully so & it only takes 1 bad PR mess to tarnish a brand.
6712339,jambi,2023-02-06 08:33:00,504,"I don't think they CAN do anything about this, can they?"
6712343,prov1800,2023-02-06 08:47:00,5010,Have no idea.Guess they can rape the land as much as they want.But guns at night kinda dangerous.We have laws and I personally think everyone should abide by them.
6712405,proguidedream,2023-02-06 14:25:00,345,so 5 guys ALL shot out of the boat at 1 cow moose ? seems unlikely... why would they all plead guilty to that charge though if they hadnt pulled the trigger ?
6712417,Skywagon,2023-02-06 14:59:00,1106,"It is illegal for anyone to shoot a moose after dark in Ontario. With that said I have a friend that is a retired conservation officer that has caught Natives shooting moose after dark, he gave them tickets, but they were always dropped, never required to pay a fine. It's sad, so much that has to be left unsaid..."
6712423,prov1800,2023-02-06 15:05:00,5010,All I can say us poor moose had to go out illegally with probably 5 plus shells in her in the wrong WMU.
6712093,Skywagon,2023-02-05 06:16:00,1106,This was a big one. https://www.ckdr.net/2023/02/03/heft...moose-hunting/
6712095,JAY221,2023-02-05 06:36:00,877,"The only thing I think should be different is that they should be banned for life. ALL of them including the lodge. Later, Jay"
6712097,Juls,2023-02-05 06:43:00,13414,"Wasn't hefty enough....especially, for the lodge."
6712099,RichA$1970,2023-02-05 06:46:00,1159,"Those fines are nothing to send a message. Confiscating their vehicle and possessions (rifles and gear) along with a life time ban of any Canadian license would send a message. Also, they should ban them entry similar to what I hear about if you had a DUI. I always wanted to fish Little Vermillion for Pike but I guess Geary’s is on hiatus (website not running) and I would not do business with them if that’s how they run their camps. Any outfitter worth a crap goes over rules and regulations prior to the hunt and the owner should have been fined a lot more as they are accountable at the end of the day."
6712107,Baseline,2023-02-05 07:32:00,3207,The fines don't match the $$$$$ spent on the investigation. I guess the game laws and fines are supposed to match the crime. I wonder if the US citizens who were guilty will have trouble getting across the border if they ever decide to return.
6712115,pjshorthorn,2023-02-05 07:36:00,5654,"I've fished Red Lake and love it. I'll fish the area again in the future, but not with this dumdarse lodge. His larger punishment is reduced business and a lot of scrutiny from the MNR . Myers on Eagle Lake faced the same issue for Muskie violations and serving game as meals to guests ..never will step foot at that place either. Cost the owner his lodge. PjShorthorn"
6712143,fishin10,2023-02-05 08:53:00,2315,"Interesting, I fished Little Vermillion out of Sportsman Lodge with Golden Eagle back in 2018 for the opening. I had the best walleye and pike fishing of my life. Had a great group of people up there. The camp owner and family were great to deal with and from my point of view did not encourage anything that was not on the up & up. BTW as far as I know Sportsman lodge is the only lodge on Little Vermillion and Flyin only."
6712165,prov1800,2023-02-05 09:23:00,5010,Do the crime pay the fine.These guys got got.Most don't.More moose get shot from boats than you can imagine.Especially water hunts on flyouts.Most native moose shot are from boats at dark with lights.MNR does nothing about that.I see lots of hunts on TV from other provinces that do allow it.Just not here.They will only be banned to hunt in Ontario.Will be able to commit more crimes in the other provinces.
6712169,Eckohlt,2023-02-05 09:37:00,3685,"Dealt with one Geary at way north lodge years ago,that was enough for me.Went on a flyin moose hunt years ago,the native outfitter flew in his two sons to guide,they only wanted to start hunting at midnight,I put a do not disturb sign on my door."
6712189,prov1800,2023-02-05 10:45:00,5010,It's really good after midnight.
