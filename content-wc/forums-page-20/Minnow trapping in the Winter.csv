6712645,Skywagon,2023-02-07 10:42:00,1106,"And that too Bill, but at this time in our lives it is not so much about how many minnows are in the trap, or about the number of fish we catch, it is all about the adventure. We are always looking for an excuse to get out, explore and do different things as long as it is outdoors."
6712941,Pooch,2023-02-08 14:38:00,4618,"When we could cross the border with salted minnows I used to throw a trap in a tiny creek running through our place and catch Red Bellied Dace... and the occasional snake. I was always amazed that a tiny spit of a creek, dry most of the year with no flowing water had minnows in it. Sometimes besides a snake there would be a sucker. Where they came from and how they survived still makes me scratch my head.Hey Skywagon, a friend of mine was killed last week in northern Wisconsin trail riding when another snow machine crossed over on a curve and hit him head on. Both died. Be careful old friend!Pooch"
6713091,Skywagon,2023-02-09 06:11:00,1106,"Riding the trail systems down there can be very dangerous because of people traveling at high speed coming from different directions. I had ridden the trails in northern Wisconsin in my younger days, the amount of watering holes along the trail systems there is something else, thus being partly to blame for some of those accidents (of course I never stopped at any of those places, but I knew of some that had . The trails we ride are mostly just trapper trails in the bush and logging roads, usually not high speed running except on the lakes, we do get banged up from time to time, but try to use a little more common sense as the bones are getting older."
6713167,N_of_Quibell,2023-02-09 09:09:00,151,"Wisconsin is up to 9 snowmobiling fatalities so far this year. Based on the blood alcohol levels in the accident reports, alcohol seems to be involved in the majority of such accidents. I think the trails in Wisconsin must be laid out by the Tavern League."

6712451,Skywagon,2023-02-06 16:21:00,1106,"Today four of us broke trail into our winter minnow trapping lake. This has become an annual event, we pick a nice day when all of us are available and set traps. This year we lucked out and did not have an over abundance of downed trees to clear on the trail, so we got to the lake in record time. The program is to set two traps and fly in periodically to check them, they usually provide enough minnows throughout the winter for our needs. This is about as far away from being a money saving venture as it gets, but it's a great excuse for 4 overgrown kids to get out for a day and play in the bush."
6712465,7 Mag,2023-02-06 16:38:00,1887,That looks like fun.
6712481,Eckohlt,2023-02-06 17:21:00,3685,We're the minnows biting?
6712517,prov1800,2023-02-06 19:10:00,5010,You guys picked a good day.Think it would of been cheaper to go to Clarks.LOL.But more fun your way.

6712593,prov1800,2023-02-07 06:59:00,5010,Absolutely correct
6712597,Bill Krejca,2023-02-07 07:11:00,6107,"I can see a certain thrill about the checking of minnow traps. Back in the day, a fun time was had when Dad and I would go on a minnow seining drive. You just never knew exactly what you'd end up with. Shiners were the desired catch, but ,depending on the creek/water body, crawfish also could be swept up in the 15 ft or so net. Interestingly, small mouth of any size would jump the net , a peculiarity, at least to me, for the species. Gotta make fun where you can. Bill"
6712631,prov1800,2023-02-07 09:41:00,5010,In the old days I would bring my guests up hwy 105 and pull over on what shoulder there was and get my 10 doz minnows from one of the numerous ponds and creeks I had traps in.Was fun for me and my guests.Sometimes not if the mosquitoes where bad in those swampy areas.Now it's pretty easy pulling of hwy 105 down camp Robinson rd to Norther Lights and dip net into one of the minnow tanks.Takes few minutes.Guests enjoy looking at the planes and always one landing or taking off.Then continue on up the hwy to wherever we are headed to.
