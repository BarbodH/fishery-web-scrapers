6713787,N_of_Quibell,2023-02-11 13:13:00,151,"Regarding ""very good reasons"" for putting on a life jacket - they might not be so obvious. I forget the exact statistics, but a shocking percentage of mid-aged and older male drowning victims in Wisconsin, when the bodies are recovered, have their flies down. Can't be too careful, I guess....."
