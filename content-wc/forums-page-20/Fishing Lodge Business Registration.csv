6712719,Namegosikaa,2023-02-07 17:05:00,61,Just a typical provincial business license outside of that if they are on crownland that would be a registered crownland acquisition certificate. If the government has tourist resorts or Outfitters categorized internally as a particular commercial demographic? Maybe but probably not public record.

6712849,Fisherman Ted,2023-02-08 08:50:00,461,Nope. We register as a business. In my case a numbered company with a DBA name. But that's it. There has been talk of NOTO trying to get the province to create a lodge registration process/system. What are you looking for? -FT
