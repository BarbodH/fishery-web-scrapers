6711641,Stickman8474,2023-02-03 16:26:00,39,The baits must of been running pretty true with the success you've had. Thanks.
6711531,Stickman8474,2023-02-03 10:00:00,39,"When Pike are deep I usually turn to crankbaits that get me pretty much where I want to go, Rapala Tail Dancer Deep and Salmo Deep Diver being called on the most. I do this via casting and trolling both. Sometimes though, I'd like to fish spoons or spinners at the same low depths (other than vertically). My question is does anyone use a weighted Carolina rig setup to get spoons or spinners down low in the water column? If so, what kind of success have you had?"
6711539,[email protected],2023-02-03 10:21:00,6,Have you tryed casting swim baits like bulldog tubes zman shads lunkerhunt paddle tails on a slower retrieval or even let you spoon sink and slower retrieval. Usually they go deep when water temp gets to hot so they get sluggish and go deep but will still move up to feed. Big bill lewis rattle trap works well mans -1 stretch version. Rapela jointed x-rap just i few way i like to do it.
6711541,That Minnesota guy,2023-02-03 10:21:00,8293,"What depth are you considering ""deep""?"
6711555,[email protected],2023-02-03 11:00:00,6,no idea i hardly ever fish deeper then 10-12 feet and I can get a spoon that deep np considering pike hit top water from depths of 10 feet.
6711565,guidedfishing,2023-02-03 11:28:00,531,All I know is they can be pretty darn deep. I am always amazed at the number of Pike we pick up on spoons when trolling for lakers in 50-60ft of water. Just put a one ounce lead ball on a three way and you will cover all the water you want with a spoon once you understand the dive curve for trolling.
6711571,bthomas3333,2023-02-03 11:35:00,465,"This is why I avoid NW Ontario and anything south of the big lakes in MB in July.It just isnt a numbers game. If you get 20-40ft down where the water is back into the 50s you can find them but just one at a time.I read something which really holds true in my experience. ""Big pike cant stay long term in water over 55 degrees."" They will slide shallower if they have to for feeding but otherwise they cant stay shallow in water that is in the 60s or higher. Small pike no problem but if you want 20lb fish the 55 number tends to hold for me.Brett"
6711587,Mojo-NC,2023-02-03 13:06:00,1929,"We fished NW Ontario several times in September when the walleyes were in 25-30 FOW. We would drag spinner rigs using just enough weight to keep them down. We did not use bottom bouncers, but instead Carolina-Rigs or a 3-way swivel. With the 3-way we would use a floating jig, a plain hook with a crawler or minnow, a spinner rig, a Ned-rig, or a floating crankbait like a standard Rapala. We caught both walleyes and pike using that method, but mostly walleye. We would also troll spoons and cranks trying to stay on the magic 25"" contour the best we could. The best areas were always adjacent to deep water (this specific lake was not large but had 90' of water in the middle). We would either cross an extended point where the shallow water ran out a bit further from the shoreline or we would run across some shallower water that extended out a bit further than normal while still adjacent to the deeper water, and that's generally when we would catch our nicer pike. We always caught more pike than walleye while trolling. We also caught several suspended pike while trolling out over 50-60 FOW while cutting across from Point A to Point B. Maybe those fish had been following it for a while or maybe they were just suspended fish. Your guess is as good as mine as to why we caught those suspended fish over such deep water. We trolled using 4.5"" Doctor Spoons and Rapala Shad Rap Deep Runner #9 crankbaits mostly, but sometimes Hot 'N Tots. We literally caught fish on every color pattern of those baits we had in our tackle boxes. For fun we would switch to a different color each time we caught a fish. I used a 7' heavy - medium action rod with a Abu Garcia Ambassadeur reel loaded with 50# braid tied directly to a steel leader or with about a 4 foot 17# fluorocarbon leader and a steel leader. You don't want to get snagged while tied directly to 50# braid as it is nearly impossible to break off."
6711633,Stickman8474,2023-02-03 16:10:00,39,"In the ballpark of 15-20', sometimes a few feet deeper."
6711635,LittleBait,2023-02-03 16:12:00,37,Probably why pike are found near cold water streams or rivers coming into a lake in warmer weather?
6711637,Stickman8474,2023-02-03 16:20:00,39,"Yes, a 3 way swivel setup can get your offering deep and it's something I've used when trolling spoons. But the Carolina rig seems it could be more flexible while also suited for casting opportunities."
