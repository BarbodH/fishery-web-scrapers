6712859,mkaz,2023-02-08 09:40:00,16,"Hi All,Three of us have been going up into Northwest Ontario for decades and hit a bunch of camps around the Lac Seul, Perrault Falls areas and have our favorite fishing camps on these larger lakes.This year we are, for better or worse, bringing our boys who are now ages 8, 9 and 12 - The three of use are, again for better or worse, married with kids, and each of us has their own potential boat monster, who we are sure will botch the handling of the net more times that we'll care to remember.Anyhow, we're thinking that the larger lakes may not be the best idea for their first Canadian trip, so we're looking for camps that have boats on multiple lakes so we can hit some of the smaller lakes to cut their teeth so to speak, as the fishing on those, when we've done it, which we have via portables, has been a lot faster in terms of finding them and in terms of numbers.Don't get me wrong, I know there are mega shoals on the larger lakes. We've had our 100+ fish days a plenty. I also know I don't want to have to try to teach my 8 year old how to bottom bounce in 35 feet of water, as the result may be frustration and, ultimately, my feeding him to a bear, which would leave Mom most displeased, despite my best efforts to appease her with some walleye or some tasty jam.Sooo, if anyone has any suggestions as to which camps fit this bill - boats on several bodies of water in Northwestish Ontario, I'd truly appreciate it, and I'm sure our little band of net-bunglers would as well.Thanks in advance and enjoy those trips y'all!"

No idea on cost but sounds cool.For a fly in I always thought Kay Lake would be awesome. Smallies, lakers, and Muskies on the main lake and they have 2 or 3 portage lakes.Alexander’s on Rowan has similar options.If you have your own boats Cliff lake and Little Vermillion have small connected lakes accessed via creeks. Not sure but would be an adventure and I’m sure there are fish to be found.Hopefully somebody on here can offer experience."
6713059,pjshorthorn,2023-02-09 02:16:00,5654,"Took my son on his first trip to Canada when he was 10. It was the best trip of my life. We went to Lac Seul and he had a ball. We never worried about smaller water / lakes because we had a number of protected places to fish if the weather was a bit nasty. If it was cold or he was bored, we went in and had something to eat and warmed up. We did what he wanted to do. Within the second day, he had his routine down with chores, beach exploring , catching fish and just being a kid. One evening after dinner he asked what time we were going back out I asked , what time tomorrow? No Dad, now. We have to catch 100 fish today and he was adamant that we weren't coming in until we had a 100 fish. The minute we got that 100th fish ..time to go Dad. We had snags, line in the motor multiple times ( aka motor Muskie) , and other mishaps that will remain unmentioned .you have to realize that I had two kids in the boat my Dad and Son. Lots of bungles, but it was really a fun trip. Fast forward and my son is turning 28 soon. Last summer we were out fishing the first evening waiting on our trip mates to arrive at the launch. Right as we were getting ready to head in, the son says he is snagged up. Turns out to be a 40+ pike once we get it to the boat .guess who bungled the net job? Still mad about that. Don't be afraid to fish big water with the boys. Any outfitter should be able to help you with setting up a plan with kiddos and weather in mind. A couple of days with portaging in to other lakes would be a big bonus just from an exploratory standpoint. The number of boats in each lake can be limited so regardless of whom you speak with, ask how many boats are cached at each lake you make consider. Last thought .once you are back at camp, the boys will take care of themselves exploring .so there will be Dad time for ya. Hope you have a blast. PjShorthorn"
6713079,Baseline,2023-02-09 05:31:00,3207,Agimac River Outfitters located just north of Ignace. This camp worked well for my kid trips. They have big cabins with up to 6 BR's and aren't all that expensive. Very remote drive to camp with boats on multiple lakes which are road accessible and all have excellent fishing. This camp could be an adventure for these kids and the adults. Kids do just fine fishing anywhere. After all people who live in Canada take their kids fishing all the time.

6713087,kettyspanky,2023-02-09 06:08:00,271,I took my 9 yr old last year as his first trip. We go to whitefish lake which is mostly perch fishing. We do fish walleye and northern in the morning and night. He did awesome and had a great trip. He caught more fish than my buddy who is 52 yrs old. In the afternoon when we got back to the cabin he would go take a swim in the pool or go down to the dock for more fishing. He has been fishing since he could walk. He is pretty good at it too. He is 10 now and insists he is going to go with me until I quit going. Sounds like I have a life long fishing partner. Good luck on your search and have fun with the kids.

6713259,mkaz,2023-02-09 14:21:00,16,"I expect the bungles and some of them in the past, kids or not, have led to some of the funniest and most memorable times on the water.Example, a friend an I were fishing Perrault several years ago and he had gotten himself a new baitcasting reel, which he insisted on casting with. Now, you can can cast with them, but he'd never used one before. So, we're sitting off a reed bed, plunking away and he bird-nests. Line is all over the place but he seems to be getting it under control. Then he was hit by the literally a small breeze and it lifted his line out of the boat, tangled the ever living **** out of everything and next thing we new we were in the reeds, with monofilament all over the place, including in the reeds.This was 20 years ago, at least. To this day all I have to say is 'puff of wind cast' and we'll both know exactly what it is and lose it.Can't wait. Border is open and we're gearing up. Getting all amped up just thinking about it.Cheers"

6713369,nitroman,2023-02-10 06:54:00,368,"Good luck sir and I hope they have a ball. I admit it's tough some days with the younger ones as they get bored and start playing with the minnows etc and you gotta move or what not to keep them interested. I also remeber a day we were on a fish every cast spot and the boy got bored with that. I was like yo this is what we dream of dude! This year we have 6 kids in the group 3 of which are first timers, I am looking forward to watching them learn and grow into this as well. With any hope they will take over the planning and organizing of this some year and us old guys can sit back and enjoy the fishing(and tell them we are bored, we have to go to the bathroom, we are hungry, we are snagged again, we dropped the pliers in the water etc etc!!"
6713123,Knutson21,2023-02-09 07:45:00,348,"I have been taking my kid since he was 7. First (2109) year was at a private cabin with not electricity or water, 18 miles up river from where we launched the boat. He fished with my dad and i in the boat, when he was tired he took a nap, when he wanted to fish he did. He went a week with out the IPAD it was amazing. 2020 cancelled 2021 Witch Bay Camp on Lake of the woods (9 Years Old). Just he and I in the boat, he had a great time. 2022 a house boat trip, 12 guys he was the youngest, 3 other kids in highschool. He adapted and played cards wit the guys hung with the highschoolers and fished a ton. 2023 he will be 11, 3 generations are going to a flyin out of Clarks resort. So in 4 trips he will see 4 different kinds of trips. This being said I don't think it matters where you go, just go and fish with your son. I started fishing 3 generations when I was 7 and now fishing 3 generations with my kid. We missed by a couple of years 4 generations going."

6713141,nitroman,2023-02-09 08:16:00,368,"You get one shot at this and if you do it right you will have a built in fishing partner for life. Look at this trip thru his lens not yours. My youngest started at 10 and he is 19 now. for his ""senior"" trip last season I rented him his own boat and let him be in charge of his week. He and his cousin ran the lake and caught fish and had a ball. Midweek he asked if he could fish with mom and I for the day in our boat. The three of us had the best day of fishing ever! I knew this was his last trip as a kid and the next trip for him was unknown as he is now an adult and job etc may preclude him from getting up there every year now for some time. Looking back I am happy I looked at the trips thru his lens and not mine and helped form one of my favorite fishing buddies! Trust me this year they are 8,10.12 but that will go by so quick then you will be like me wondering when the next time you will get them up north with you will be. pick a lake, any lake and teach them to do what you do and have some fun. It doesn't need to be perfect it needs to be fun and memorable. Have patience and don't bungle the net when he lands his big fish as he will remember how you lost his biggest fish ever!!"

6713239,mkaz,2023-02-09 14:02:00,16,"Hi.We're looking to drive-in this year. When they're older we'll do the fly-ins, I imagine.And, yes, that little chain off of Cliff is good stuff. We launched a porta bote into that many times, pulled over the dams to get all the way back into Twilight and there are a few spots that are absolute walleye machines, with amazing numbers of 18-20"" fish, with some larger ones in there was well and managed to pull a couple of decent musky out of there as well over the years.One of my best fishing stories ever comes from Twilight. A friend and I were back in there, and it takes a bit of time and effort to get back in there, as you go through two lakes connected by streams, and are pulling beaver dams in those streams to keep moving - and his walleye pole snapped. I don't remember what happened to it, but it snapped. While we were floating around deciding what to do he spied a pole laying in the water on a rock pile. He fished it out with a jig, cleaned it up, had another walleye on it in under 10 minutes and fished with it the rest of the trip. Just nuts.This year with the kids I prefer to have the boats there so we don't have to drag and assemble, etc., but if I have to, I'll bring the porta botes and we'll roll with those.Cheers."

That's exactly what we're trying to do here.The reasons we're leaning to these smaller lakes are the adventure factor of rolling off road into the woods- and I know we'll find ridiculous amounts of fish on these in (usually) a reasonable amount of time. We're thinking that putting them on the fish will get those fires burning.Cheers"

6713095,guidedfishing,2023-02-09 06:18:00,531,"MkazIn my opinion when my son started going with me it simply was a wonderful time to have him experience it with me. He had been fishing since he was 3, his first trip to Canada with me, him and I solo was when he was 10. 20 years later he still comes when the busy life of a young man does not pull him away to other commitments.I would be less concerned on the size of the water, and just make sure the setting is comfortable for you and the young man to enjoy.At 10 my son had already been fishing with me pulling down riggers and driving the boat on both Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. I had total confidence in him loading and unloading the boat so all I had to do was back in and have him drive on or off.That being said here are things to consider I think more than the size of the water.Food & Snacks they are growing and I learned early to fill compartments with decent snacks, fruits, and lunches I swear my boat would look like a band of racoons rummaged through the compartments foraging for food by the end of the day.Gear don't skimp, if you want them to enjoy it make sure their rain gear, clothes, boots are every bit as good as yours. When they tell you they packed it, check it and make sure. Don't expect them to hold up or last as long as you can if the weather turns cold and sour. Expect stuff to get lost and gear to be broken, roll with the punches and have fun. I can remember a very nice St Croix rod and reel going into the lake not totally his fault, and there were trips that by the end every set of pliers and forceps, basically anything not tied down in the boat managed to make its way overboard into the lake. How you handle that could be the difference between them wanting to keep coming. Stuff happens don't get upset.They want to catch fish and are less concerned if it is a walleye, lake trout, or pike. I prefer to chase walleye and trout but I soon learned it was even more enjoyable to cruise the shore line and let him catch one hammer handle after another and see the grin on his face. Let them catch what ever is biting they don't care.Although they will have lots of energy, they will not have the endurance of age, don't count on a full day of fishing its hard for young men to maintain that focus all day without getting bored. Just be aware you will see when it happens.If weather and lake temps permit let them get in the water, put a vest on them find a sandy spot, throw a bar of soap at them. My son and his cousins had as much fun in the water even when I thought it was just a tad bit cold for anything other than a quick bath.Overall slow things down, don't expect them to know everything this is the start of all those experiences for them to learn and build on and you are the gate keeper to make sure its as positive as it can be.What joy, have fun with the boys, it goes so fast.Just to add, there are multiple camps on the 599 corridor from Ignace to Pickle lake that all fit that description, most drive to, most if not all have boats on out lakes. good luck."

6713119,adempsey2.0,2023-02-09 07:39:00,611,"I am a bit confused. You want to find a camp that has several ""small"" portage lakes because you believe that finding/catching fish will be easier on them? While that may be true, I think the alternative of finding a camp that is near great fishing spots is worth considering. You can find a larger lake that is less impacted by weather as well, if that is also a concern. What I would do is find a camp that is near incoming rapids/falls. The fishing will almost always be good at those locations. They are pretty cool too! If the camp happens to also have weed beds nearby would be a super bonus to mix things up. Lakes with varied structure, neckdowns and plenty of islands would be a good idea too. For example, at North Caribou Lake you could find walleye off of pretty much every single point and neckdown you fished. If you hit the incoming rapids/falls, 100+ fish was easy. This is not really that unique either. I am sure doing a portage as a kid would be pretty fun too though. However, I don't think this should be your primary filter to narrow down camps. Knowing if you are looking for a drive-to or fly-in would also make a huge difference."
