This is VERY remote portion of NE Saskatchewan and the price reflects everything be inclusive from Saskatoon. The outfitter is operating on Burnett Lake. You also have easy access to two other lakes. This lake was just opened in 2020 and covid has pretty much blocked most customers. Accommodations look awesome. The price includes guides and cooking services.The lake has the Canadian grand slam of Walleye / Pike / Lake Trout / Grayling. The outfitter has the walleyes / trout pretty well dialed in. I'm planning to look for the pike and see what I find and then default back to walleye/trout if I don't find the pike.If interested ping me here. Here is the website for the lodge.http://www.marshlandfishing.com/fly-in-trips/This is a pricey trip but it is also a chance to fish lakes with little to no pressure (just to get us to the camp from Saskatoon is costing the outfitter close to 1600$) in the very fishy part of Sask.I'll post to the share a seat page too!Brett"

6702325,bthomas3333,2022-12-19 14:31:00,465,Hey - Need one more. If interested PM me.Brett
6705053,bthomas3333,2023-01-06 13:38:00,465,We got up to 4! We could take 1/2 more. We are fishing unguided which helps with the price. Also all travel from Saskatoon to the lodge is included. The website is a bit confusing on who pays for charters.Brett
6711529,proguidedream,2023-02-03 09:50:00,345,any idea what they charge for meals ? or do you pack your own cooler and cook yourself ?
6711567,bthomas3333,2023-02-03 11:30:00,465,I was able to get them to cook and provide the food for an extra $550 for the week. If you filled the camp you could do it yourself but 2 of the group wanted guided / american plan and two wanted unguided. The logically solution was to get them to provide food for all four of us. Still have room for 1-3 more. Brett
