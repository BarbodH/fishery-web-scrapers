To this day my wife (yes, we are still married) reminds me how I purposely destroyed the photos of the two large fish she caught that week……big Walleye 28 1/2 and big Pike 42”! These were the disposable camera days and no, cell phones were not a thing. I recall the cabin having a slight propane leak so I took every opportunity tontake advantage of my lovely young bride. I honestly think it was just a ploy for her to get in my britches but will save that story for the Penthouse and Hustler crowd!!!Overall a great week of fishing and shenanigans but never invited her back due to her outfishing me. Maybe one day in the future I will drag her back North with me with a few conditions of course.That’s one of many fine or not so fine moments.PS if only I could just find that old disposable camera. It very well may have pics of her self-proclsimed world record fish and who knows, maybe a few for the girly mags &#x1f60e;"

6710831,last chance,2023-01-31 08:06:00,3262,"at 71 I have so many great fishing moments I will remember to my grave the best time I ever had was many yrs ago on the east fork of the Obey river at dale hollow. a friend and I were night fishing for walleye. we weren't catching and but they were there. when we shined our spotlight in the water the eyes of hundreds of fish lit up like a Christmas tree. we were using jigs tipped with minnows. my friend got hit and reeled in this water dog about 20"" or longer. he said he was just going to cut the line but i told him not to do that we were almost out of jigs, but in reality, I had my small tackle box full. anyway, he grabbed it around the belly and it wrapped its tail around his arm, and started screaming. that's when he started flailing his arm as hard as he could and started screaming like a little girl that lost there favorite doll. after what seemed like forever it came loose and we heard it hit the water about 100 yards down the river. and I laughed till I cried and my belly hurt. then we have our reunion and had a men's night before the reunion. so after we all got there and most were about 3/4 lit and I thought about all the times he told about things I had done when I was younger. so I got everyone's attention and told the story on his catch with arm shaking and screaming and everyone busted out laughing and it seemed we laughed forever when we quit someone would start screaming and we would start laughing again. it was told at men's night for years to come."

When we lived up the road from Little BaydeNoc, we were trolling early season for splake, when there was still some around. Nasty day, before walleye season opened. Stuck to the shoreline right in front of the Gladstone launch to avoid the weather. Husky Jerks. One splake, nice one, but 5 walleye, all between 30-33"", nothing smaller, all released safely, except the splake, of course. Spent tons of time on Lac Seul, caught a million. Now in Florida full time, turns out there are a few fish around here too!"
6710855,kim n indiana,2023-01-31 08:55:00,62,"Maine. river. I used to go and fish for two weeks while ex would visit family/friends as that is where she was from. River came down thru some rocks, and then around big curve before shooting thru/beside an old RR support made of stone that was long abandoned. There were smallies behind every stone in upper part, and the curve was about 6 feet deep and also full of smallies. I had the baby daughter along. life jacket on, she was about 5 yrs old at time. she played in shallow some while i fished up by rocks, and then wanted me to walk back to her. i put her on my back and waded into curve and stood about chest deep fishing with her in tow. Fish after fish. and you know how they jump and splash. she is back there screaming in my ear when they jump next to us but wants to touch every one of them. a magical hour or so that i will never forget. One guess who goes fishing with me now when we can."

We stayed at Golden Eagle camp and went and anchored at the mouth of the Wenesaga River. My son had a jig tied on and as soon as we were anchored he dropped his hook down. He immediately set the hook on a nice walleye. The look on his face told me that he was forever hooked on our Canadian trips!"

Casting for pike with my zebco 33 and a 5 of diamonds. 10lb pike. was fun for this little kid. My 1st fly in experience. 1998. Never caught so many walleye in my life. It was humerous after awhile.
6711283,MNWalleyenut,2023-02-02 13:34:00,11,"My moment involves a trip to Lac Suel with my father. We had fished many times together and always caught plenty but never anything 30""+ . On this trip that changed big time. On our third day we found a spot that produced 2 fish over 30"" and another 6 between 25 and 30"" in a 3 hour span. Needless to say it was a day that will live in my memory until I pass. Sadly, this was one of our last trips together as my father suffered from dementia and wasn't able to make the drive or handle the time in a boat like he once did. He passed about 3 years after that trip. I appreciate all the wonderful stories being posted in this thread and the site in general. Tight lines in '23 everyone."

We were catching a few eater walleye's using 8lb braid with a leader, she enjoys fishing from the bow so she's a few feet from me. I hear this noise and her saying somethings wrong with her reel! I look up and her pole is bent over and out of the corner of my eye i see a huge muskie heading in the opposite direction of our boat. She's trying to crank in some line but it's just ripping off the reel and the drag is screaming, by now she's really ticked at the reel! She never did see the fish but it was hilarious and she was really ticked it took her 1/16 oz pink jig."

6711701,Ohio fisherman,2023-02-03 19:26:00,988,"Early June many years ago on Lake Erie. Fishing had been slow. The western sky started looking ominous. Then the fish turned on. After catching a few, the sky was was looking really mean. The alarm on the weather radio went off. Water spouts had been seen to the west. Still only light wind and 1-2 foot waves. Started in and had gone only a short distance and had to stop for just one more. Almost immediately hooked up with something really good. Took my time enjoying the fun. It was a beautiful 33” walleye that I gently released. That was it, the fish turned off and the sky cleared. I was very happily one short of my limit."

Sunday afternoon Dad takes me and we ran up to Sucker lake. He sets me up with a large sucker minnow and shows me how to keep feeling for the bottom. 5 minutes goes buy and the rod bends fiercely while Dad hollers ""set the hook set the HOOK"". Old bait caster on a fiberglass rod and I'm feeling as hard as I can but no line coming in. Dad keeps hollering ""just keep winding"" over and over. I holler back ""I am winding but nothing's happening."" Keep winding keep winding is all I heard. Finally get the fish up, Dad nets it and immediately starts laughing like a wild man. Then I start laughing hysterically! Next thing I know he's still laughing with tears running down his cheeks telling me what a great fish and a great job catching it. Turned out to be a 6lb walleye and I was hooked on fishing still to this day. Sent from my moto g stylus 5G (2022) using Tapatalk"

6711753,pjshorthorn,2023-02-04 03:50:00,5654,"Without a doubt my best memory will always be my first trip to Canada in 1982 as a 17 year old teenager.My grandfather, father, an uncle and two family friends rounded out the group with myself on an adventure to the NE section of Lac Seul. At the time I had no idea why that destination was chosen, but it has become a lifetime memory with me. I have learned over the years why this place was chosen by my Grandfather.We arrived at Ojibway Outfitters in Sioux Lookout that first evening to check in and were given a bit of bad news. The outfitter told us that our intended destination to camp was occupied. We were hoping to tent camp as far north as we could go where the Root River comes into the lake system. The occupants were natives that were currently trapping in the same area. He told us that if we set up camp, the natives would likely burn the camp down or steal everything we had while we out fishing. Not a good thing.He offered a camp site halfway down the lake on Taylor Island which would be much safer. We took that option….LOL.We launched 3 boats , 1 14’ and 2 16’ footers , the next morning from Deception landing. We boated in everything we needed for a week long trip. This was about as remote as this kid could imagine back in that timeframe. The trip in was amazing. You really had a chance to take in the real beauty of the lake and the scenery at snail speed …..since we were so loaded down. My uncle and his college buddy were the lead boat and we had one paper map from the DNR as our navigation tool. I was in the second boat and saw every finger pointing decision that took place to navigate our 6 hour journey to Taylor Island. We made it there safely and started on setting up camp. The site was rough,but we were seasoned tent campers and I was in my element. - Move the 6 35 gallon gas cans as far from the fire ring as possible. - Get a 6 person tent set up- Get the cooking area set up- Dig an outhouse which was a hole between two trees with saplings nailed to the trees …to form a square seat. The TP holder was an empty cardboard 12 pack box…back then it was probably Schlitz or Pabst.- Build a fish crib for purposes of culling fish. To this day I still think we were illegal doing so ,but gramps told me it was fine. It was 1982……..The first two days of fishing was really slow…..we didn’t know the area at all. I had not caught one fish in those two days and I’m thinking this sucks….Canada sucks…….I should have stayed home and taken my girlfriend out on dates instead. On the second evening we saw a campfire burning on the other end of the island……hadn’t seen anyone in two days.We decided to walk over to figure out what we might need to do….stay or move in the morning. Turned out that we met two brothers who worked for Phillips 66 out of the Chicago area. They were camping just like us and knew the area pretty well. Soon enough I became the beer fetcher guy that evening. The next morning we followed the brothers up through Bear Narrows to Ski Doo Point, Kekabeka Narrows, Scaler Lake, Chamberlain Narrows and beyond. That third day changed everything in terms of fishing and my fishing memories. I have been going to that same area for 40 years now……..as recently as last summer. I have stopped from time to time to check on that Taylor Island campsite and she is still there. I hope to beach a HB there one day again and relive all my memories of my first trip.What started 40 years ago has given me the blessing of fishing with 4 generations in the same general area….my grandfather, my Dad, myself and my son. I have also been blessed with my Dad , myself and my son fishing in the same boat together on a number of trips to this same area. I have 5x7 framed pictures from those past trips that I still bring with me regardless of whether my Dad or Son make a trip. Gramps…..he always makes every trip too no matter what. So many more stories to tell about that area of Lac Seul……..especially the area called Lak-A-Nookie beach. Pulled up to the beach on a 1990 trip.Found a sign and a noose hanging from a tree when we pulled up to tie off our Houseboat The dancing girls showed up around Wednesday night or Thursday about lunch time on that trip. Trip down lake was Friday afternoon. Not a whole lot of fishing going on on Thursday or Friday.Thanks for taking me fishing in Canada Gramps. Keep the thread going…. I love reading about everyone’s adventures present and past.PjShorthorn"

6710877,eyeman_1,2023-01-31 11:37:00,690,"My very own first boat... New Lund ProV 2025IFS - 2001... first trip in new boat to Erie Islands. First afternoon after we arrived we get out, that water is like glass and that great green blue color... I have my dad and one of my best friends Mike in the boat... and I get all the boards set and we are headed towards Rattle Snake Is from Middle... The first rod/board goes back and I yell fish on... take it dad... He says no way son, your new boat you get the first fish... so I proceed to fight the fish, and it's got the board buried. This is during late April so lots of big fish in the area. Finally get the board off and all I have is the line straight down and big thumping head shakes.... thump, thump and no line getting back onto the spool.The good news is it's all open water between these islands so I take my time, eventually getting the fish closer and can see a flash or two of gold down there. My dad is driving the boat and my buddy is at the ready with the net when the fish finally surfaces off the port stern and with one big scoop, the fish is aboard. In the net it looked huge, the head of the fish was enormous. I got the Thunderstick out of her, and put her in the livewell to recoup and get the camera ready, and board back out. Finally I grabbed her and put the tape to the fish... it was 32.5"" and just a beautiful fish spawned out. I put her on the scale and it was just bouncing between 11.5 and 11.6#.... We took some great pics and we put her back into the lake... Great way to christen the new boat. To this date it's still my longest fish... wonder what she would have weighed a week or two earlier?I hope I'm half as fortunate this spring with the new boat. Fingers and toes crossed."

6710495,Pooch,2023-01-29 10:56:00,4618,"At my age there are moments branded into our brains. I have many, but this one has been on my brain lately. I remember exactly the moment, location, trip, etc.. Doc on a good fish, Savant Lake 2007. South of Wildewood Bay along east shore, backtrolling spinners on bottom bouncers for walleye on a steep drop off. Five to ten minutes later what we thought just had to be a big ""big walleye"" turns out to be a big northern. Doc was spot on by letting the fish tire itself against the drag. Disappointed it wasn't our big walleye, but it was a spectacular Northern in the low forty inch range. Few hours later Doc sticks a short 28"" walleye. Great day I will never forget. How about the rest of you chumps........ What moment left a forever memory on a trip? Pooch"
6710505,Juls,2023-01-29 11:24:00,13414,"Long story short....I was prefishing the 2001 PWT event here on Lake Erie with Rick LaCourse and Mike McClellen. (I wasn't entered in that event).It's the event, where Ted Takasaki landed 51+ pounds for his best 5 fish on day one.There were a lot of big fish in the system that year.Anyway....we were trolling along, and those two were arguing over sports or something stupid. I saw the board go back and said, ""Fish on"", and pointed to it.Neither of them paid me any attention, and didn't make a move to get the rod, so I got up, and grabbed the rod, mumbling to myself...""Well, if neither of you want it..."" It turned out to be my second best walleye, ever, weighing in at 12.7 pounds. It's now part of a 5 walleye coffee table in South Dakota, that Mike had made with 4 other Lake Erie monsters. It's a very cool table. I'm still trying to beat 12.9 pounds. Maybe, this will be the year."

LongLining a #7 Jointed(""Clown"") Rapala plug on 15# ""Power Pro/Depth Hunter"" braided line, I thought I had picked-up a snag into some sucken wood in front of the resort docks! #3. I released the bait caster reel, put the 90 Honda in reverse to (hopefully)retrieve the the plug from the snag! #4. While starting my retrieve & tightening the line, the snag began to come alive! #5. I quickly began moving the boat away from the pole docks & began a 20+ minute fight with what I thought was probably a snagged Rainy River ""Sturgeon""! #6. While during the 20 minute battle with what I now knew was a ""Big Muskie""; I was a busy boy trying to keep the boat in the middle of the river, fighting the fish & retrieving my net & pliers for a final look-see & landing! #7. I was fortunate to get the Muskie into the net tail-first. #8. From the top hoop of my net to the stretched bottom of the coated string net measures 38"". Now the tail is curled @ the bottom of the net & @ least 12"" to 15"" of the Muskie's head is above the hoop(38""+ 6"" of tail + 12"" of proturding head = approx. the 54"" to 57""). #9. As I ""Gilled"" the monster from the net & began to lift it out, it gave a head-shake that almost threw me out of the boat! #10. After successfully releasing the Muskie(unmeasured) back to the river, & calming myself; I had only ""One"" regret regarding the ordeal. I was in-front of a resort, only yards away from the Public Ramp & no other boats insight and to the best of my knowledge; ""No-One"" witnessed my adventure!!! That's my story & I'm sticking to it!!

We were anchored above a rapids jigging for walleyes and the action had slowed so he put on a very small Rapala and cast it out. He told me he had a snag and when I looked back at him he asked do rocks move? Nope they don't I ended up netting a 40 inch Northern for him and his knees were shaking. He decided to mount that fish as it was the biggest fish by far that he had ever caught. By the end of the week i had netted a 43"" and a couple of upper 30"" northerns for him. He taught you always caught fish like that in Canada. I took a number of pictures of his 40 incher and the lodge, no longer in business, used them in one of their brochures a few years later. wmd"
6710703,Ltrain,2023-01-30 09:23:00,4145,"One of my favorite moments came up on Cass lake Mn around 2016. The trip itself was horrible- 40mph winds from arriving Saturday til Thursday night. Friday would be our only day of fishing. It was blowing 15 mph Friday but that was double in my 18ft Tyee. I already shattered the windshield on the boat lift awning when a wave surged and pushed the boat up and winshield caught it- great. So I'm out there with half a windshield, decided to drift slow death. As soon as the bottom bouncer touched bottom, the rod double over. So I'm like great, I'm snagged right off the bat. Then came a tug... so I'm like okay probably a northern, but I'm okay with that but it's not fighting like a northern. Then I see the glass eyes on the biggest walleye I've ever hooked. Put the net in and thankfully was able to one hand it and measured out at 29""- still my PB. My son, on my brothers boat pulled in a 27"" wally that day too so we both made the resorts picture wall of fame that day. I also created a moment for my buddy , who never trolled walleye, on lake Erie,April of last year. I was setting lines and was explaining how i like to hook up before I get all my lines out. Well the first line I'm setting pulls back before i even get the board attached so naturally this is my first time on Erie in my new boat, I'm going to land the first fish, which I did a nice 24""er. So i tell my buddy since he never caught one trolling and only caught his first one ever, two days ago jigging, that he's up next. So before long another board goes back and he procedes to land a 30.5"", beautiful monster. He was all smiles the rest of the trip. Go figure first walleye trip and he pulls in a slobasaurus, and it's bigger than my own PB,lol."
