6712669,flipdip,2023-02-07 12:22:00,27,"We did a father-son trip to Poverty in June of 2019. Every other trip we've done have been to Melchett in August/September. First off, the outfitter was amazing and the cabin was great. We got to Nakina early the day before we were supposed to fly out with plans to stay at the hotel by the airport. We went down to checkin and let them know we made and Chad said he'd take us out a day early!! How awesome was that! Now, for the rest of the story....Granted, it was the first time we were ever on this lake so there was obviously a learning curve. We primarily fish for walleye. The lake was pretty shallow so it made it a bit challenging to find what would typically be a wall, point or shelf to fish from. We eventually found them but didn't catch a lot of them and they weren't too big. But the really weird thing, and again this is the first time we've fished in this lake or in June, the walleye's did not taste good or have near the flavor we were used to. All in, we have a good time and it was great to take my boy on his first trip."

You won't catch a hundred fish a day in July on the lake but you will have good fish action. The lake is small but if you can river fish you be good any time of the day for fish but the main lake holds lots of fish as well. As for getting upstream or downstream unless you have a lot of energy and are willing to pull the boat up or down it probably won't happen with July water levels. If you are a Garmin quickdraw user I uploaded the charts I started to build while on the lakes so it would give you a good head start on figuring out the lake. I can also help you out with some of my spots that worked for us. Somedays we didn't even keep dinner fish and went out at 4 pm with confidence that we would have them at the inflowing river fresh for dinner at 6. As for relief and poverty I can't offer any help other than say if you go to youtube and search out nakina and those lakes you'll find some videos. Esser as someone else had mentioned has a great video there done by a young couple and it looks great I'm sure you could contact them through youtube for more info. I can't say enough good things about Chad and Dawn and the business they run, he will do everything to help you have a great trip as I have had many with them.Quote: Originally Posted by flipdipWe did a father-son trip to Poverty in June of 2019.

As the ""founder"" of my family Canada group, I got rattled when I had to consider an alternative lake than the one we have come to know and love. I made the decision to go to Saga. I will hope for normal to higher water levels. But if the water levels isolate us to Saga, so be it. In the end, I am thankful that my group has its health and the ability to simply go somewhere. I'll take it a step further and say that I am thankful that places like remote Canada still exist to go to. Again, thank you everyone for helping this overly nervous planner out."

6713125,adempsey2.0,2023-02-09 07:48:00,611,I have the old MNR depth maps for Durer and Nass if you want them. There wasn't one for Saga for some reason. The lakes that are basically expansions of a river often don't have depth maps.
6713643,andreindy,2023-02-10 21:51:00,308,"Adam, that would be absolutely great to have any information/maps about Durer or Nass. I really appreciate it!"
6711935,andreindy,2023-02-04 16:27:00,308,"Before posting, I tried searching old posts. My small group likely has to change location plans for our Canada trip which was planned for week of July 7th. We likely need to choose between Poverty, Relief or Saga. They are north of Nakina. Anyone fished any of those bodies with Twin Lakes around that time of year? Changing from our usual lake due to scheduling constraints. Unfortunately I know very little about these bodies of water. Stressful decision. Feel free to PM me."
6712109,Larry S,2023-02-05 07:32:00,665,"As you have stated, check out posts on these lakes in the Search Option. Then send Messages to anyone who has fished any of these lakes and ask them questions. Larry Schroeder, Henderson ,Nevada"
6712145,andreindy,2023-02-05 09:00:00,308,"Yes, trying. Found two people from posts over the last 20 years. Worth a shot."
6712153,Eckohlt,2023-02-05 09:05:00,3685,Are those the only 3 lakes your looking at in that area??
6712171,andreindy,2023-02-05 09:44:00,308,I had my deposit in at the end of last year and so staying with the offerings of Twin Lakes Outfitters. Those 3 lakes are available the week of July 7th (Friday to Friday). Trying to accommodate my brother who would otherwise not be able to make it. We were Abamasagi guys.
6712175,Eckohlt,2023-02-05 09:58:00,3685,"Ah ok,I fished Aba last sept 23.sry can't help you on the others.If nobody chimes in on the lakes,be like a crap shoot,pick one n go."
6712237,adempsey2.0,2023-02-05 13:23:00,611,"Just looking at the bodies of water, this would be my preference: 1) Saga IF you can access both Durrer and Nass Lakes in July. 2) Relief IF you can access Tooth Lake in July. 3) Poverty Lake If the water levels make accessing those additional lakes not possible, I would choose: 1) Relief - jumbo perch are a nice added bonus IMO 2) Saga 3) Poverty - shallow lakes are not my favorite"
6712241,kim n indiana,2023-02-05 13:49:00,62,same issue here. i've got esser booked next august but there is scant info here that i can find about it. Most of it old. so i will also take any info anyone has to offer.
