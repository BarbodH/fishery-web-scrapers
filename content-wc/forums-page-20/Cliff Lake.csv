6715209,prov1800,2023-02-16 12:41:00,5010,Will find out next time.
6715215,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 12:47:00,3685,"Hope that next time is soon,like to see a laker pic."
6715217,prov1800,2023-02-16 12:55:00,5010,Right now we are in deep freeze again.-27 tonight and few more days of that.Ill pick my days.Had crappie last night thanks to Skywagon inviting me over last week and have a few walleye and a northern in freezer for back up.lol.But rather get fresh.Spring getting closer.When that gets here its hard for me to stay home
6715237,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 13:53:00,3685,"If I lived up there the wife would have to chain me in the house,with a logging chain to keep me home!"
6715241,prov1800,2023-02-16 14:01:00,5010,My logging chain is -30.Pretty soon I'll be out way more often.I enjoy fishing outside when it's nice out.Nothing else like it.
6715265,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 15:02:00,3685,"Fished lots up there in -30,but I had my otter sled portable with a great heater in it.Those days are gone,many times couldn't pull the rope on the sled in the morning.KC landing like 10 star resort to me as far as ice fishing."
6715275,prov1800,2023-02-16 15:23:00,5010,"Me Eskimo pop up is insulated and my buddy heater gets it t shirt weather in there but the unloading ,riding and getting to spot and setting up lately gets kinda cold.So I pick my days.Shacks at KC is for the cold days."
6715277,Eckohlt,2023-02-16 15:37:00,3685,Right on!
