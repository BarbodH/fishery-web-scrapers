4037009,walleye IA,2015-07-10 20:54:00,129,Any idea where I can buy a 1/2 flat of crawlers on highway 502 or 105 last minute.
4037057,Carnhzkr,2015-07-10 21:19:00,964,Its not on 502 or 105 but I know that Sportsmans in International Falls sells 1/2 flats.
4037073,ftfarms,2015-07-10 21:20:00,444,I bought a half flat in Dryden. When you first come in town. It used to be a gas station. It was last minute. I'm sure Dutchies will have one also. On 105 in Perrualtfalls
4040849,alanexpup,2015-07-12 18:19:00,278,how many worms are we talking in a flat? do they all come in the tall Styrofoam cooler? thanks
4041449,ftfarms,2015-07-13 03:31:00,444,Thay claim there's 480-500 worms in a flat. I wouldn't call it a tall cooler just big enough for the worms and a little bedding.
4042177,Bitinlight,2015-07-13 08:22:00,95,"I checked recently. I know they have them at Sportmen's in International Falls. In Canada, Rainy Lake Sports and Great Bear both have them. I think Great Bear was less costly. The gas station on the corner in Dryden went out of business."
4044113,Skywagon,2015-07-13 16:53:00,1106,QSL Bait and Tackle in Dryden has flats of worms on hand.
4045089,Aspencreek,2015-07-13 21:32:00,2911,"I take it you haven't driven 502 before, there is NOTHING on that road. The rest areas are any small drive off or load check area, and you get to pee behind the tree."
4031929,Andyeye,2015-07-08 16:40:00,179,We are heading up to Cedar Lake to Cedar Point Resort crossing on August 8th. I would like to possibly pick up another flat of crawlers for the trip as we now have 8 going. Where would be a good spot to get them in either Fort Francis or Dryden? and what is a flat going for up there now? Thanks.
4031993,Aspencreek,2015-07-08 17:16:00,2911,"I ordered mine from Rainy Lake sports in FF, on the lake far east end of town. They had it waiting for me along with my order of leeches."
4032433,Carnhzkr,2015-07-08 20:28:00,964,Your best bets are Rainy Lake Sports or The Great Bear. TGB is about 7 miles east of FF after you cross over the causeway. I paid $75 CDN at TGB on 6/27. Call ahead about 4 days and they'll have one waiting with your name on it.
4032449,wallydave,2015-07-08 20:38:00,2151,"Try Dutchies on the 105, good folks from Iowa, 807-529-6556."
4032513,JayM5209,2015-07-08 21:14:00,1050,"x 2. If you are taking one flat from home, call Dutchies and order the 2nd flat for 2 or three days into the week. It'll save you the hassle of keeping the 2nd flat cool and healthy until you need them. And by Tuesday or so someone will have a need to make the run to Dutchies anyway!Dutchies, Perrault Falls - (807) 529-6556"
4032905,last chance,2015-07-09 05:58:00,3262,I order mine from canadiannightcrawlers.com 58.00 shipped to your door. good fishing on your trip.
4034081,Mark R,2015-07-09 13:11:00,1538,where would you get crawlers if you crossed at Baudette instead of IF?
4034441,Bstar,2015-07-09 15:28:00,564,$75 CAN is roughly $64 U.S. Why bother having them shipped to Muncie and then haul them up to Canada when you can get them closer to your destination for $6 more? And they'll probably be fresher. I'll get mine at Rainy Lake Sports
4034489,Carnhzkr,2015-07-09 15:36:00,964,"I like Dutchies. My wife always manages to find something she didn't know she needed there, and we make our way for an ice cream sometime during my weeklong trips, but they are quite a bit higher on their crawlers than they are in Fort Frances. At least that's been my experience. When I called, Dutchies was at $90 for a flat versus $75 at both Rainy Lake Sports and The Great Bear. Prices do tend to fluctuate throughout the year, so it can pay to call around. Both RLS and TGB are nice stores with lots of neat stuff to look at."
4034521,billy weaver,2015-07-09 15:48:00,470,I called Cabelas in Owatonna and ordered a flat for Canada to be picked up on our way. They were packed in a Styrofoam box and chilled. They were in great shape and packed in bedding for Canada. If you call ask about price as our price was cheaper than the price listed at the store.
