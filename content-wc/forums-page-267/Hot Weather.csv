4046305,Kansas Bound,2015-07-14 09:01:00,152,I don't go north till August but have been keeping an eye on the weather. It seems to be hotter this year in Canada. Has your trip been hotter than normal this year?
4049338,anglerjake,2015-07-15 07:13:00,57,We were in Sioux Lookout area 7/4 - 7/9. Only the first day was what I would call hot. Rained 2nd day and was cool and pleasant the rest of the trip. Bugs were nearly non-existant and fishing was superb! Jake
4049442,eyegator,2015-07-15 07:49:00,29,"We were in the Ear Falls area 7/9-7/12. It was 85-90 a few days and we were still hammering walleyes up against shore in 2-10 ft of water near drop offs-- the bite time was even mid afternoon. It made no sense to me, but the weather didn't seem to phase them."
4049490,Golden Eagle,2015-07-15 08:06:00,2642,"I burned a lot of wood from May 14-23 on Little Vermilion Lake. Heavy dose of freezing rain May 17 made it too dangerous to fish off dock. Three to 4"" snow May 18. Fish were around, but not in the usual locations. Found them, but had to look and had to look again the next day. They were moving. Looking forward to an August trip to expand my nostrils, give my lungs a treat and find fish, lots of fish, where they're supposed to be. I'm burning up in Tennessee and almost daily rain is keeping me from working my vegetable garden. Weeds and grass are having a banner year."
4050370,LoDo,2015-07-15 12:59:00,721,Id love to see these temps no warmer than mid 70s by Aug 13. Id prefer upper 60s if I could plan the perfect temps. I'm not one to complain about a scattered rain/storm either. 4 weeks and counting!
