Watched friends videos and the action was great and they were catching lots of big walleyes. Well last weekend in Sept me and a small group are going! I have a few questions for you Tobin guys or guys that have been there. Any advice for a first timer? Thinking of hiring a guide for the first day. What's the tactic there at the end of Sept? Cranks, Jigs, Spinners, live bait? River or main lake? Noticed a lot of photos were at night, are the odds a lot better at night and if so how late at night? I need my sleep JK! Is Tobin one of them lakes when the wind comes up its hard to fish? This wont keep us off the water (unless its serious weather) but just curious. Feel free to put in past experiences also! Everyone likes a great story! Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

4045665,deadhead1,2015-07-14 06:48:00,193,It makes a big difference on where you are staying. The lake can get bad if the wind gets up but the river is usually ok. It is a long way to go from Tobin Lake town site to the river if the wind gets up or from Nipawin out to the big lake. River is better for big walleye that time of year but don't discount heading out to the big lake where the two old rivers meet. Also very good time of year for huge pike using smelts and quick strike under a float. Search Tobin Lake on youtube and you will find some good video about it. Good luck.
4046225,TrollerDude,2015-07-14 08:45:00,33,Thanks for all the advice and the PM's. The info is really helping out in pointing us in the right direction! Cheers to you all
4046249,deadhead1,2015-07-14 08:47:00,193,"also if you haven't already done it, print of a map of Tobin Lake from the Town of Nipawin web site."
4046273,TrollerDude,2015-07-14 08:48:00,33,"Deadhead, I've watched those pike videos up there and man they are some slob pike! That would be a blast! Is the lake and river free of rocks and hazards? We go to Northern Ontario every year and we have to be careful in a few spots and lucky in the others! Found some stones and stumps with the motor up there but luckily nothing happened."
4048746,Mrnovice,2015-07-14 21:15:00,75,"Rocks not much of an issue but dead heads all over the place. Shallow, deep water, doesn't matter. Floating logs. Depth can change in a flash, 30 feet one second and 3 feet the next. I haven't figured out the lay of the land yet on some parts of Tobin. But it's worth it"
4050354,alanexpup,2015-07-15 12:56:00,278,HI. since we moved to vegas from Chicago we went to tobin once. the way they picture the lodges in their brochures on the lake is deceiving. its like a town. anyway the week we were there the wind picked up and no one could out on the lake for 3 days. I would never go and stay on the lake again. somewhere on the river would be the best because the wind would not be a problem. my 2 cents.
