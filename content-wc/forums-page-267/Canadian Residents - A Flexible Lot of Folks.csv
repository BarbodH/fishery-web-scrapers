4032025,Aspencreek,2015-07-08 17:25:00,2911,Ohh MAN !!!!! There's a mental picture I could do without.
4032145,bigwalleye1,2015-07-08 18:46:00,2632,THAT's that diet plan I was talking about right there....
4032169,wallydave,2015-07-08 19:01:00,2151,"Gord that's, 5 in the penalty box for Unsportsmanlike Conduct!"
4032441,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-08 20:34:00,725,"Yeah, you can't unsee that....."
4032601,Nimstug,2015-07-08 21:41:00,2605,"V-Bay, Is that one of your guides?"
4032809,pjshorthorn,2015-07-09 05:21:00,5654,"Now Gord. Although the outfit is quite flattering on this gent, you know that this could not possibly be me. There is no way I would be caught in public in an outfit like this without having had my chest properly ""waxed"". Note to self.....get the chest waxed on the 22nd so the redness goes away before arriving at V-Bay's place. PjShorthorn"

4040961,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 18:45:00,1463,I think we will need a bigger boat
4041153,ftfarms,2015-07-12 19:49:00,444,Yeap. I think he's over the slot limit!!
4041505,pjshorthorn,2015-07-13 04:50:00,5654,I guess getting a ride in that new boat of your's is out of the question ???? PjShorthorn
4029977,pjshorthorn,2015-07-08 05:26:00,5654,"In all my years of traveling to Canada, I have always found Canadian residents to be overwhelmingly polite and a very flexible lot of folks. I now know why they are so flexible. Apparently this is a newer trend called "" paddleboard yoga"". An interesting concept that we ran across while walking at a beach on Lake Ontario. I dare say that this could become a new lodge offering at our favorite fishing locations in Canada. PjShorthorn"
4030153,bigwillies,2015-07-08 06:35:00,515,Think it's time to start snorkelling.
4030185,bigwalleye1,2015-07-08 06:41:00,2632,I hope you're not going to post pictures of a bunch of hairy overweight beer guzzling cheese eaters in speedos trying the same moves... There's an image that'll curb your appetite.
4030273,v-bay gord,2015-07-08 06:59:00,3168,"Here at the lodge we have a different fitness regime......large beach ball yoga. Here's a picture of a typical guest working out before heading out to slay the walleye.... (*note: your results may vary, and we cannot guarantee similar visual appeal for all guests)"
4030521,Lake Wisconsin,2015-07-08 08:14:00,1960,"If class is from 6-7 am, I will not be on the boat any sooner than 7:05."
4031049,phishfearme,2015-07-08 10:57:00,1242,"when you said ""I have always found Canadian residents to be overwhelmingly polite"" I immediately thought of this scene from the movie ""Canadian Bacon"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l0PD80u9k maybe we should all start posting in English and French! phish"
4031073,PRO-V1,2015-07-08 11:03:00,142,............i just booked a cabin for the month of July 2016........see ya next year
4031081,ftfarms,2015-07-08 11:11:00,444,Gord my wife asked if you would take her photo off this site?? LOL!!
4031625,v-bay gord,2015-07-08 14:18:00,3168,I can do that for you ftfarms. In it's place I offer up a very flattering shot of pjshorthorn on a recent Canadian yoga excursion....
4031649,ftfarms,2015-07-08 14:30:00,444,I knew I should have kept my big mouth shut. Sorry everyone. You got me Gord.
