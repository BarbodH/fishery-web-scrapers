This lake is an amazing numbers lake and I have been taking my son here since he could crawl in my efforts to engage him in fishing because the action is fast and furious with pike, walleye, perch and the occasional bass. A few people live on this lake and a few locals fish it and so it does get fishing pressure, for that reason I limit myself to ZERO fish on this lake, catch and release only. Was pretty impressed that my wife was pulling walleye out of the thick cabbage weed on a fire tiger Fox Vibrax spinner...WTG! Also proud that my son is getting more comfortable handling fish now too. Great way to spend an hour or so after work with the family.VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g80E884Zb3E"
