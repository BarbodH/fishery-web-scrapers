Last year we found very high water and a giant year class of walleyes in the 10 to 13 inch size. Has the water returned to normal? Was there significant growth in those small walleye? Any fires up that way? Any Walleye Central folks up that way next week that see me give me a shout, I'll be the old good lookin' big guy in a red Skeeter tiller. Thanks, Big Iver"

4049354,Bigiver,2015-07-15 07:17:00,94,Thanks Reels for the report. We are heading up Friday and I was hoping those small fish had moved into the slot. Looks like next year. Meanwhile looks like burgers and brats for shore lunch. I will write a report when I get back. Thanks again.
