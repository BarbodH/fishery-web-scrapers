Mayflies have finally finished except for a few stragglers. Strong winds were not an issue this trip. What a relief! Temps ranged from 60-85 degrees for day time highs with 2 days of thunderstorms.Fished around Cox island, Steamboat Bay, McKenzie Bay and Ghost Narrows area. Cox and Steambaot areas produced a lot of fish. Lots of 14-16"" fish! When I went down the lake the quality got better. Total fish slot or bigger was 176 and the biggest was 26.5"". Found most fish in the 10-14' depths but always searched deeper and shallower waters and caught them in 5' and 25'. Move if you are not catching fish or are in a school of smaller fish!Pulled spinner rigs with minnows and crank baits to catch fish.Gas in Ear Falls was 1.29 liter and 1.02 in Winnipeg area. Crossed at Pembina and gas was 2.69. Was asked about poultry products when crossing into Canada 2 weeks ago. Have a great trip! Wish I was still there!"
