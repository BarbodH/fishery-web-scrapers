I want to tap into both species and try to make it easy on myself since I will be theone doing everything. I thought about using braid on all of their poles and a flouro/mono leader for walleyes and then just trading out with a steal leader when trolling for the pike. What would be the easiest to do and not have to have 6 reels total with a light and heavy line?"
4037825,youngknight,2015-07-11 11:35:00,228,"If you have 6reels/rods I suggest take them because, as you say, you will be doing everything yourself. Save some time and aggravation and just have the rigs ready to go. Eg. 3 tied to jigs and 3 to snap swivels or leaders for connecting to lures or bottom bouncers or whatever. Also when that one reel if one of your kids gets in a tangle or whatever...just hand another set up to them and figure it out back at camp. I prefer the braid and 36 inch fluorocarbon leader.I did get some single strand wire leader material for pike (knot2kinky) but have difficulty tying it on,..their recommended knots don't seem to work all that well. Just went with conventional leader for casting for pike."
4038585,MrSimon,2015-07-11 19:46:00,922,How old are the kids? Do they have a lot of fishing and boating experience?
4039137,Plotman,2015-07-12 06:17:00,394,"My wife loves her old zebco 33 and refuses to pert with it so I filled it with power pro braid going to a barrel swivel and then to a short fluorocarbon leader (Keep the leader short as they always seem to reel the swivel through the top eyelet). I hate to admit it but, her rig with an unpainted lead head and minnow outfished me and my son the first day-badly!!"
4039153,SinOrSwim,2015-07-12 06:28:00,1528,"wow! lol I just got back and with ONE kid I was hardly fishing at times. Every time he got snagged, I handed him my pole and let him fish while I got the snag. With THREE kids? Between snags, reties, bait, hopefully fish. Good luck. And, that many lines.........tangles. It'll be fun though. I'd just go with braid on everything. Their skills aren't good enough to even worry about the fluoro leader. Just braid to a jig or braid to a leader. Simplify it. THey will catch fish regardless."
