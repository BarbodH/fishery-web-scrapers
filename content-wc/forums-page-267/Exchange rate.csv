4038329,onetimedave,2015-07-11 17:10:00,502,You are right about lodge charging in US or Canadian but what about the trip to the lodge once you enter Canada? We still have an expense for this part of our trip.
4039425,oleJoe,2015-07-12 07:45:00,114,"I have found that a lot of the places that charge in American dollars are owned by Americans. Its nice when the U.S. dollar is strong but I,m going anyway!!"
4036329,onetimedave,2015-07-10 14:29:00,502,Look at the exchange rate!!!!!! As of today $1.00 US equals $1.27 Canadian. Makes the late summer and fall trips more affordable.
4036385,v-bay gord,2015-07-10 15:03:00,3168,Dare I mention it? Only if the lodge charges in Canadian $............
4036537,NARDA 1,2015-07-10 16:41:00,636,"Just had to spoil it, didn't you!!!! lol"
4036641,v-bay gord,2015-07-10 17:46:00,3168,"Spoiler.....no way! I know you're happy to pay in US because you then know what it's going to cost you (20% more), and obviously you are happy to see the lodge owner having a banner year (hey, where do I put this extra 20%?) Is it time for Obabikon to take me to task yet?......."
4036697,halfmoon007,2015-07-10 18:11:00,121,"Us lower Michiganders just make a early Sunday morning run to Windsor , Ontario and cash out about 1,200 bucks American for the fishing trip. they will give you about 1.24 if the internet says 1.27. the key is don't stay very long at the casino or it will cost you . although stopped in Soo Canada .4 years ago at the casino for about 20 min.our way to Chaplou lodge and came out 600$ up. Halfmoon.......with 2 trips booked for august..."
4036713,Obabikon,2015-07-10 18:20:00,2370,Still wanting to compare apples and oranges? Do we need another business economics lesson on here? I hope everyone has had or will have a happy healthy trip.
4036745,3M TA3,2015-07-10 18:37:00,2846,"Well if the lodge were the only cost then that would be true. I mean heck, we go thru 10 dozen eggs per week. So there."
4036753,muskyman73,2015-07-10 18:38:00,402,"yes, we had a safe and wonderful trip, Hey Jared, I left a hooded sweatshirt on the couch, any chance someone found it ?"
4036953,unclepaully,2015-07-10 20:18:00,112,We just paid for the balance of our entire trip with White River Air. They take either US funds or Canadian. Each of us sent a check to my uncle who paid with his credit card. He was given a 26.5% exchange rate. Can't beat that.
4037753,kzoofisher,2015-07-11 11:08:00,5144,I'm really hoping my lodge will take all these leftover drachma's I've got.
