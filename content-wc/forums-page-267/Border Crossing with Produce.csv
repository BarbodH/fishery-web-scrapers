4039393,pjshorthorn,2015-07-12 07:41:00,5654,Nope. The regs indicated 250 kgs per person. Here is the linkwww.inspection.gc.ca/foodI did do my metric conversion incorrectly tho. I guess it only works when I'm actually in Canada 250 kgs= 550 lbs instead of what I previously posted of 114 lbs.PjShorthorn
4039657,v-bay gord,2015-07-12 09:10:00,3168,I can hardly wait for you to arrive at camp with 550 pounds of sweet corn and several hundred pounds of field tomatoes. Nice!
4039785,pjshorthorn,2015-07-12 09:49:00,5654,"If you line up two float planes to pick us and the veggies up at Breezy Point ,MN we can make that happen. We of course would need to arrive a day early to unload everything and fish an extra day PjShorthorn"
4038937,IAWally,2015-07-12 03:24:00,38,Just wonder if there is a limit to the amount of produce you can bring across. I am heading up again Aug 21st and would like to bring about 10 dozen ears of Iowa sweet corn to contribute to the camp cook out. Also the camp manager says he can't get good tomatoes unless someone brings him some. I was thinking 40-50 Lbs. so he and his wife have some to can. Do you think this would this cause problems at the border? I don't plan on selling anything just sharing.
4038993,pjshorthorn,2015-07-12 04:37:00,5654,"I don't recall the exact wording in the regulations regarding bringing food into Canada, but it is something along the lines of "" a reasonable amount of food may be transported into the country for personal use/consumption"". I personally don't think it would be an issue, expecially if you have a decent size group on the trip, but it may be worth a quick review of the regulations to make sure. It would be a shame to lose good corn and 'maters.Best of luck on your trip.PjShorthorn"
4039001,IAWally,2015-07-12 04:54:00,38,Thank You There is only going to be my son and I going this trip. I will have to look them over a little closer.
4039009,ftfarms,2015-07-12 05:21:00,444,If the corns ready when I'm going we ussually take 10-15 dozen with us And its either two or four of us. Never had a problem. The only thing that would be a concern is make sure it dont get to hot it will sour in the heat.
4039057,pjshorthorn,2015-07-12 05:34:00,5654,"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulations on bringing fresh fruit or vegetables read: - 15 packages or less up to 250 kilograms ( approximately 114 lbs) of fresh fruits and vegatables per person ( excluding potatoes ) - must be free of soil, pests, leaves, branches and/or plant debris The only thing that may be open to interpretation is whether the husk on corn would constitute leaves. I think it would be prudent to make sure that there were no vines or leaves on the tomatoes. Seems pretty straight forward, but give the regs a look as well and see how you interpret them. I have never tried bringing any one vegetable in that quantity. PjShorthorn"
4039121,greenie,2015-07-12 06:15:00,87,"If Customs doesn't ask, then don't tell. Never offer up anymore info than necessary."
4039217,SinOrSwim,2015-07-12 06:41:00,1528,"Exactly. I've never been asked if I had vegetables. Just do it. Worst tht can happen is you tell them you are taking corn for the camp cook out. If they toss it, they toss it. I bet they don't ask though."
4039305,lassh,2015-07-12 07:19:00,553,PJSHORTHORN- Should that be 25 kilos instead of 250?
4039313,btyreprich,2015-07-12 07:23:00,1067,"Previous poster hit the nail on the head: Tell the truth if asked by the border guard Never volunteer more info than what is asked In all the years we have been on a housekeeping plan, I have never been questioned at the border about the coolers and boxes of. Food we have with us. On the potatoe issue - we bring a good 20 lbs and have had no issues crossing the border. I will not be bringing any chicken or eggs with us on this trip based on all the comments posted on this site."
4039321,SinOrSwim,2015-07-12 07:27:00,1528,Or eggs or chicken. we don't know which crosses first.
