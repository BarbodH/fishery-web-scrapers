4037969,roscoe33,2015-07-11 13:05:00,653,"Have caught many eyes jigging hammered brass spoons, 1.25 - 1.5"" Copper, gold, or silver did not produce in our waters."
4039145,Jtmwalleye,2015-07-12 06:21:00,16,"We caught plenty of walleye on 1/4 oz jigs with the usual white twister tail (4 inch), and if you pick through enough, we landed a few ""nice walleye"". Now, regarding spoons, albeit not our usual tactic, I landed numerous walleye, and nice walleye, on a Doctor Spoon (gold), about 1 1/16 oz. I removed the treble and put a single hook....key was adding about 2/3rds of a 4 inch twister tail(white), so it ran right. This was absolutely deadly on pike and ""bigger walleye"". Technique was similar to pike....casting current breaks with weeds AND deep water near. Key for the bigger fish were...current....weeds...deep water near. Need all three in my opinion. Early in June we consistently caught larger northern (or saw them) in the northern part of lake...back bays warmed up quicker, more weeds, deep water near, river channel near AND, water temp was 8 degrees warmer in those bays. Large females (walleye and pike), were there as they did not move out to deeper water yet. I am convinced larger spoons...dressed right, produce large walleye at right time of year. Hope this helps. We had a blast in NW Ontario this year."

4039705,LoDo,2015-07-12 09:27:00,721,"Our group leaves Aug 13, fly-in west of Red Lake. I keep reading white twister tail is the move. I don't think there is one comment on this board that discusses any other color than white for a twister tail. I've done well with a white jig and minnow in the past. I guess I'll have to make another trip to Cabelas, oh darn, before our flight to Minneapolis."
4039729,flntknp17,2015-07-12 09:29:00,151,"Ditto.....one of my absolute favorite walleye lures thats sorta outside the ""norm"" for walleyes. I would suggest replacing the stock hook with a high quality SINGLE hook and adding a 3"" grub tail (like a power grub). We caught probably 20%of our walleyes on Lac Seul two weeks ago casting Little Cleos near cabbage beds. Great also because about every species in the lake will hit a small spoon. Matt"
4042841,cma14,2015-07-13 11:38:00,6,Thanks for all the great replies. We leave on Friday and I almost can't wait. Heading to Bass Pro tomorrow so i'll snatch up a few white grubs and make sure i have enough small spoons Cleo and Gold....
4046777,Lovetofish,2015-07-14 10:44:00,458,Also gold/orange or any bright color. We have used them for years. 2/5ths oz.
4047097,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-14 12:10:00,109,"Blue & Chrome Doctor spoon, 4 1/2"". Produces lots of nice walleyes for my group every year. We will often troll them through new areas as a quick way to locate active walleyes, then work the area over with jigs or crankbaits."
4047185,Lovetofish,2015-07-14 12:29:00,458,"We did a portage a week ago today on our annual family trip and all my son used all day was a 4"" silver colored swim bait. He caught all kinds of walleye and northern with it. Anytime he snagged it came right out. Sorry I don't know the name of the bait but it had a single hook on the top of the bait. He had a good time with it."
4033897,cma14,2015-07-09 11:41:00,6,I'm sure there are several threads on this site on this topic so sorry for duplicating... I'm heading to the Attawapiskat River next week and a lot of videos I have watched show monster walleye being caught on spoons. Anyone willing to share the best technique for catching walleye on spoons?
4033977,Obabikon,2015-07-09 12:22:00,2370,I can't speak the BEST way... but we occasionally throw them at rock shore lines and weed beds. That seems to produce some nice fish. Silver or gold work best.
4034049,MrSimon,2015-07-09 12:43:00,922,"I've found spoons work best when targeting walleye that are actively feeding ... which is usually in and around weed beds, current breaks, or shallow flats in the evening."
4034169,MN_Moose,2015-07-09 13:43:00,964,the smaller Williams Whitefish and or Williams Wobbler do well for me. Hammered gold or silver

4034657,pikeandtina,2015-07-09 16:47:00,145,Try a Little Cleo in silver and blue.
4034977,Bill Krejca,2015-07-09 20:20:00,6107,"In the past, I've had fair luck using a Dardevle type spoon in black with a white stripe. Notmuch on red and white, funny. Bill"
4035505,camp chef,2015-07-10 07:54:00,915,We did well this spring on Little Doctor spoons in many colors. Blue and silver seemed to be the best.
4035561,Coyoteman,2015-07-10 08:17:00,209,"I'm somewhat lazy, or just don't like casting. We troll daredevils over the top of weed beds on a lake up north. Usually we catch 3 northerns to every eye but the eyes are usually good ones."
4036593,SpoonieLuv,2015-07-10 17:04:00,16,"I've had good luck ""ripping"" them vertically. Gold was the best but you never know so I have other colors ready."
