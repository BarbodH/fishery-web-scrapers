4042593,PBsQuest,2015-07-13 10:12:00,49,"I wish I could help, but I'm heading up at the end of August. Love to hear your report when you get back."
4042633,FrankLeigh,2015-07-13 10:19:00,80,"It has been about ten years since we last went there, so any advice may not be relevant. However, our best fishing was in the Fort Channel and in front of White Rock. There are numerous shoals all through that area and all have produced big walleye and huge pike at one time or another. Our favourite lures were big Rapalas in black and silver or dark blue and silver, either HuskyJerks or floaters with split shot about two feet ahead.We stopped going for many reasons, the camp was sold and taken private, but the main reason was the change in regulations which basically meant that you could only keep one fish. Check the regs and carry a gps so you know when you cross that invisible line from river to Georgian Bay, as three different zones meet.Also, from a safety point of view, there are a lot of narrow channels between French River village and the Fort Channel. Many are dead ends, so keep an eye on the weather so you don't get trapped when the wind picks up. A steady blow from the west will bring some big waves.Are you using an outfitter?Good luck!"
4043497,Consigliere,2015-07-13 14:22:00,132,Will be staying at a private cabin on the east side of the Bad River Channel outlet. Thanks for the location advice if the weather co-operates we will likely make a day trip over that direction.
4044217,Fish_Heads,2015-07-13 17:32:00,154,"We fished there 25 years ago & stayed at the Bad river Lodge (now private).We went to the mouth of the river where it meets the Georgian Bay & trolled up river with 7"" Rapalas to above the Jamison rapids. We never went out till about 8:30 pm & trolled to about midnite. Booked the week of the full moon every summer in late June /early July & had a great time there, fished till midnite, got our limit, then played poker till 4am ! Those were the days !Also went into Yacht club bay thru devils door rapids & caught nice pike by the old cannery dock pilings."
