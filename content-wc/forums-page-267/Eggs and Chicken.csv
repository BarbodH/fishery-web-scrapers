4041353,CI_Guy,2015-07-12 21:45:00,2118,Crossed into Ontario on 7/8 and returned today. We were asked by both Canadian and U.S. customs at Rainy River if we had any poultry or egg products. We just bought eggs a couple miles across the border.
4041481,pjshorthorn,2015-07-13 04:40:00,5654,This sounds like a story that is told around a campfire not to mention that Dave just possibly received a new nickname PjShorthorn
4041497,wallydave,2015-07-13 04:49:00,2151,Mike has a few stories he can tell around the camp fire too! I'm sure he has a couple other names go goes by!
4041521,pjshorthorn,2015-07-13 04:54:00,5654,"I don't know why, but somehow Possum fits him well...... PjShorthorn"
4047033,toja9801,2015-07-14 11:56:00,6,An aquaintance didn't know about the ban and was sent back after flying up last week. Had to go back to the US to dump them. Just buy once you cross the border.
4047065,Mike Kansas,2015-07-14 12:04:00,1463,I have been called a lot worse things than Possum...in fact by my wife just today as I was cleaning my new boat in preparation for going fishing tomorrow. Mike Kansas
4047081,wallydave,2015-07-14 12:08:00,2151,"Mike, what kind of boat do you have? Do you take it up North?"
4047314,pjshorthorn,2015-07-14 13:17:00,5654,"I'm in the same "" boat""' as you most of the time with my wife. As she continues to remind me frequently, "" Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? "". As long as your wife doesn't use that phrase with you, I think she just wants to go fishing too It has only taken me 33 years to figure out that I just may rather to be happy.......... PjShorthorn"
4049522,Mike Kansas,2015-07-15 08:14:00,1463,"Dave, I retired April 1 and decided to buy myself a retirement present. I stayed conservative and bought a V Hull tracker with a 75 on it. I did take it to Manitoba this year Catfishing but I will not take it to Lac Seul. I love to fish for Walleye out of a tiller because of easy boat control. Was going to take the boat out today for some Bass- Crappie fishing but we have heavy rain and that killed my plans. Mike"
4039417,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 07:44:00,1463,Had a friend tell me that the ban on Eggs and Chicken being taken into Ontario has been lifted. Can anyone verify of refute this. Thanks Mike Kansas
4039545,SpoonieLuv,2015-07-12 08:38:00,16,"Wouldn't bet on it. Resort owner called yesterday to tell us NO eggs/chicken to Canada. Just buy them up there, not a big deal."
4039569,SinOrSwim,2015-07-12 08:43:00,1528,"Considering it took like 15 or more years to lift the potato ban, I can't imagine it will be lifted anytime soon. I just googled it and didn't see anything."
4039761,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 09:36:00,1463,Thanks for your reply. Mike Kansas
4039769,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 09:37:00,1463,Thanks for your reply. Mike Kansas
4039857,pjshorthorn,2015-07-12 10:18:00,5654,"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency website still has it listed as a banned food ( raw eggs and poultry products) that can be imported. The last update was may 15th, but it seems to still be an active regulation. PjShorthorn"
4040721,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 17:02:00,1463,"Thanks pat, Looks like we will go with turtle eggs and possum off of I-35. Mike"
4040753,wallydave,2015-07-12 17:24:00,2151,Mike do you like your eggs over easy with some possum jerky on the side? I guess you are out of mink fillets!
4040817,Mike Kansas,2015-07-12 18:11:00,1463,You are the Mink Man!!! Mike
4040865,wallydave,2015-07-12 18:20:00,2151,I still have the car with the tooth marks to prove it!
