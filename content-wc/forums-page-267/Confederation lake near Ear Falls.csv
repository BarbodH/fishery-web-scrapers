4029073,outdoorsron,2015-07-07 16:12:00,843,Hello: Looking for information about Confederation lake. Fishing for Lake Trout and Pike. Going to the Ear Falls area around July 25 to Aug. 10. Any information would be greatly appreciated. I know you have to tow your boat there and I wondered how safe it is to leave your truck and trailer there for the day. I don't think there are any resorts there and was told the last resort there burned down. Good Luck O - R
