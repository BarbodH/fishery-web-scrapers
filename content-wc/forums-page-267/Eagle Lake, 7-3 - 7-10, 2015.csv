I had a trailer tire blow out just west of Gothenberg, NE only to realize I forgot to put the spare trailer tire in my friends truck. Aaargh. Lost three hours tracking down a spare (along with a couple hundred bucks).My wife was to join us in Minneapolis (she flew) and continue to Eagle. We got to the airport early, found a shady spot and decided to inventory our tackle. This was when I discovered I left my tackle bag in the car at home! AAArgh again (only much worse than a flat tire). Luckily there were several Cabelas around who were willing to take my credit card on a spur of the moment notice. Ha ha.We stayed at the South Shore Lodge. The setting is beautiful and remote. Only one other party was in camp with us so we had the place to ourselves. The fishing was slow all week as the weather was unstable. 65-70 one day, 45 the next with rain. Two low pressure systems moved through. At one point I had on 5 layers including thermal top and shirt, a hoody, a lined camo jacket and goretex. Yikes! Fishing with gloves in July, who'da thunk that? Luckily we had gloves.My tackle mistake didn't hurt us because the mayfly hatch was on and all the walleye wanted were worms. We caught our fair share of walleye but nothing was sizeable. The largest was 23.5"". Pike were taken all over on Zara Spooks and spinnerbaits as were quite a few SMBs, the largest being 18"". Overall it was a good week but the size of the fish was disappointing. We just never found the larger fish. I heard the fishing was great for a couple week before we got there and I read reports to that effect on this forum. I just chalk it up to the weather and inexperience with fishing shield lakes.I think our next trip to Canada will be to a smaller lake which would be more manageable. Oh, we did discover why it was called Eagle Lake. We saw dozens of eagles around the lake."

Fortunately, everything went well except the fishing was often slow...thought about giving it up a couple times. What was your impression of South Shore? I usually like a variety of weather, but sounds like yours was extreme. Glad you survived. Mike"

They reacquired it in March and have been working to restore it to their standards. There were plenty of housekeeping cabins, the rental boats were 17.5 foot Lunds with Garmin fishfinders and 40HP Yamaha's. I thought the value was great and it was nice being away from the traffic of the larger north shore resorts. The fishing right around SSL was great as it was amongst the islands. In other words, the water around the lodge was manageable. The only downside to the SSL was the generator. It was located far from the cabins but you could hear the low rumbling 24/7. Generators are what you have to deal with in those kind of locations. I would recommend the SSL. For the record, we only had two dinners but Gail is an excellent cook!"

Thanks for the tip on the weather might have to bring some more clothes. This is our 13th yr. there love the camp. Hope the fishing picks up. Thanks again"
