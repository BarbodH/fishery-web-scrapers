All we heard the first week was how great the fishing is here but we had really bad luck, rained first three days and hardly caught enough for meals. This week we know the lake better and we are ahead of the game. Today I went out on our local bay in front of Perrault lake camp and struck it rich! I was just fishing for bass but using the bass rig I ended up catching 4 walleys of the following sizes. 22 inches, 26 inches, 30 inches and 27.6 inches. We have been coming to Canada for as long as I can remember and this was my best day ever!!!! This is a catch and release for anything over 18 inch s for walleys. This is better than ever did on LOTW, LAc Saul."
