We fished Bruce,East and Packwash lake with Packwash being the most consistent. As we intend to return next spring,does anyone have any tips/locations they would care to pass on to help me locate fish? We did Ok however, I am not above asking for assistance to fish a lake that large when its totally new to me. Anyone aware of any chips for my lowrance or good maps that cover Packwash to better locate structure/avoid navigation hazards? Thanks for any assistance. PM me if you prefer."
