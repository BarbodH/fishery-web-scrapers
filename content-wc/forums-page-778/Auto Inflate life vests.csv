BUT, when I slip one on in the store they always seem to ride up (maybe will chaff) the back of my neck. Does anyone use the Sospenders, Sterns, Cabelas brands? What do you like or dislike about them? Do you wear them all day or do you find yourself taking them off after a while? Do you wear them under your rainsuit in wet weather? Can a heavy downpour set off the auto inflate? Thanks, Pooch"

545036,Guest,2005-01-14 08:22:00,0,"I bought a couple last summer and I gotta say I love em. 1. It's a life preserver I will actually wear. 2. I barely notice I have it on. 3. You can actually wear it duck hunting and shoot w/ it on. 4. It easily fits under a rain jacket, and I have a couple standard jackets in boat in case it actually downpoured enough to bother, although I can't remember anytime I was ever out in that much rain(I hate fishing in the rain). 5. A bigger deal than the rain thing is here's a life jacket you can wear when its HOT and not be uncomfortable. 6. You can get models that don't self actuate so they can get wet. 7. Regular life jackets suck and are always stowed away in my boat."

I'm hoping to pick up a Sospender (World Class Manual Infaltable- Long model) next time I visit the Cabela's store in Dundee Michigan. Consequently, I'm hopeful your positive comments were attributable to a Sospender product. Thanks in advance."
