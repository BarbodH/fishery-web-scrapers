Any help would be appreciated as to the best time of year and methods to be used (jigging vs. cranks). One guy who was there this summer said Berkley ""Gulp"" was outperforming nitecrawlers but the last time I fished in Alberta you couldn't even use scented baits. Is this still in effect. Thanks to all."

Shaws point, little grassy etc. As the season proggresses the walleye spread out and in the fall the bigger fish for the most part are in the east end of the lake. Canyon Creek is exellent in the fall. The lake is loaded with stucture and is a blast. With the lake being 70 miles long there are times when you should not venture out.4 - 6 footers. Most people will jig with minnows or leeches. bottom bouncing with spinners tipped with a leetch will work best for bigger fish, with lots of numbers. 50- 100 fish a day not uncommon. Live bait is legal except for minnows. Topwater"

543208,Guest,2004-09-08 06:57:00,0,"Everything Topwater says is true. Many people do use bait, but two years ago I started to use Power Bait and Gulp exclusively and I haven't noticed any reduction in the size or numbers of fish I catch. Mostly I will use white Jig Worms on a white jig and occasionally a gulp night crawler on a spinner rig. Another lake with non-stop action is Pidgeon which is just sw of Edmonton. Pidgeon is C&R only for walleye."

543220,Guest,2004-09-08 12:33:00,0,Gulp is a product by Berkley that is very similiar to Power Bait but is not plastic. It is 100% biodegradable. The night crawlers in the natural colour look very realistic.It is also alvailable in other patterns besides the nightcrawlers. I'm not sure it catches any more fish than the Power Bait but I like the fact that it is biodegradable.
543221,Guest,2004-09-08 12:44:00,0,"thanks for your quick reply,Bob. i am going to try them this weekend. art"
545037,Guest,2005-01-14 09:10:00,0,As Bob mentioned white jig with white tail (gulp) works great on this lake. We usually cast it out and give it some action as we reel in. I also like to use a white jig with red eye with a minnow and jig it off bottom if you can get it to bottom...some days fishing is so hot you can't get you hook 3 feet down before they are smacking it. Bottom bouncing with a minnow or learch works great as well. I've landing some nice ones on crank baits. Anytime of the year is good for fishing I find around the fall the lake is a bit rougher and as mentioned above 4-6' swells can kick up in a hurry..just a nice little Walleye chop:) I just moved from Slave Lake but last few years i put in about 70-80 days of fishing each year on that lake. Hope you enjoy your trip
