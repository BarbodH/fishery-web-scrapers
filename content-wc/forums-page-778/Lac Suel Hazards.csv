545130,Guest,2005-01-15 17:02:00,0,"I think it is a good idea to share hazardes spots on Lac Seul. I marked a few on my GPS in 2003 when the water was down. 50.30.310N 092.55,709W also 50.35.158N 093.03.402W."
545138,Guest,2005-01-16 13:01:00,0,"What area of Lac Seul. Is the entire lake full of hazards? We are staying in the Ear Falls area. Is this a dangerous area, or is dangerous even the correct word?"
545139,2 DOGS,2005-01-16 14:38:00,361,"Keep in mind Lac Seul was formed by damming the English River. So on your trip up there look at the countryside and you'll get an idea of what's beneath the water. It's not a dishpan shaped lake. I can only speak to the area around Ear Falls and the 50 miles south and east. Dangerous or hazardous are pretty good definitions to describe the area if you don't pay attention and don't look at the map your camp will give you. If it's your first trip up, hire a guide for a day or two or follow someone else who is familiar with the area for a few trips out. After spending 5 summers up there I thought I knew the area real well and used to blast through one spot until 2003. Was going along the same route and thought if that Gull doesn't get to moving I'm going to run over him until I realized he wasn't swimming, he was standing on a submerged rock the size of my boat. 10 feet on either side of the rock there was 12 foot of water and in a normal year you would have cruised right on by and wouldn't have noticed that little blip on the screen. I don't want to scare you, it's a wonderful fishery, just respect it and you'll do fine. I take comfort in knowing several who have guided many years up there still come back with a dinged prop once in awhile, and they know who I'm talking about."
545140,Guest,2005-01-16 15:03:00,0,i think 2003 was a real eye opener for lots of us.
545147,Guest,2005-01-17 08:54:00,0,"Whit, You are 100% right, 2003 was an eye opener and a prop buster. We fished the same area we have fished for 16 years and it only took one day to figure out that slower travel was better. We dinged up the props on all three of our boats. But the fishing was awesome. In fact it was the best Walleye year we ever had. I believe that the terrain of Lac Seuls bottom is one of the main reasons that it is such a great lake to fish Walleyes on. There are thousands of great spots that hold forage and therefore eyes are plentiful. Lac Seul is full of sheer drops and awesome structure and if one will fish it slow you will find spots that the big girls like to sit in and wait for a tasty meal. We also believe that you want to fish the windy sides of structure and the windy points for the best results. We fish jig/minnow shallow in the spring and move to bottom bouncers in deep water from mid July through fall."
545148,Guest,2005-01-17 09:00:00,0,"Marking and relying on your GPS routes can be dangerous too. First, most GPS coordinates are +/- 25' depending on the model you have and if you are flying across the lake you will never be able to follow the exact route. In general, if you are off even 10 feet from your original path - it can be trouble. Second, the lake levels in Lac Seul can vary as much as 20' depending on the energy requirements from the HydroPower Plant and precipitation year to year. The lake actually varies 6-10 feet each year as a rule. GPS's are nice but too many people rely too heavily on them. Good luck but if you want to be safe, fish Lake of the Woods!"
545150,Guest,2005-01-17 09:32:00,0,"I agree. 2003 with the low water levels was scary at LS. Every year in our camp, guys continue to be towed back with missing lower units and mangled props. Some just don't learn and think that if they have a map it is 100% acurate and the 'path is clear'. If big rocks and big water scare you, LS is not the place for you. Otherwise stick near camp or find another lake."
545151,Guest,2005-01-17 10:37:00,0,Good idea for the faint of heart to fish a lake other than Lac Seul. Leave the World Class Walleye fishing to us. Seriously all you have to do too fish Lac Seul is respect it.
545055,Guest,2005-01-14 16:06:00,0,"While on Lac Suel last year I was heading back to camp from McKenzie Bay. As I approached Shanty Narrows, there were two boats just sitting in the water. As I came closer I noticed one boat was a DNR boat. Well they were right on my GPS route so I started to go wide around them. Then the DNR boat waved me over. No problem, I though he wanted to check my license of catch. When I pulled over there, the officer said he was just trying to warn me that I was heading for an unmarked reef. This was only 50 yards off my plot trail. I thanked the officer and marked an icon on my GPS so I would be cautious in that area. Well I thought if everyone would post any of these type of spots on this board, everyone could benefit by adding them to their GPS's. The rock reef is located just southeast of the south end of Shanty Narrows. N 50*28.803 W 92*52.824 As with all such information, use at your own risk."

545063,2 DOGS,2005-01-14 17:24:00,361,"In that area of Lac Seul, if you put an icon for every reef you wouldn't be able to see your screen. Save your old route, because you obviously didn't hit anything on that pass, then be sure and follow the route closely. What alot of people don't realize is the ice sometimes moves those buoys. Then if they are one of the first ones after ice-out they can be surprised. The campowners maintain those buoys and do a pretty good job, once in awhile somebody drops the ball and doesn't get theirs put out or in the right place in a timely fashion. What I find humorous is the people who forget which side of that color of marker they are supposed to go on. Keeps the boat dealers up there busy with lower units."

545065,Guest,2005-01-14 21:45:00,0,Hi. It depends on the water level. when we use to go there every year it was really scary in a low water year to see all the rocks we were missing when the water was just a few feet deeper. It all boils down to how lucky do ou feel buncky? I have heard of markers being put out and the guides pulling them so they would get more business.

545067,Guest,2005-01-15 07:53:00,0,"2 Dogs, I have saved the trail but it won't due me much good. I am staying at a different resort and will be traveling a different route. The rock bar I posted does not get marked, that is why it is important. I have been on Lac Suel twice before, I used to fish LOTW all the time until I made the switch. Navigating these waters is not too bad with a GPS, I just take my time on the first run and save the plot trail as you said. I just thought if people submitted their locations of these hazards you could start building a great map of the rock bars on your unit. There are no electronic maps of Lac Suel like there are of LOTW. I set these up as icons, not waypoints. That way I can turn them off when not needed. With the GPS units able to store huge amount of this kind of data, the more the better."

545068,orchard frank,2005-01-15 09:00:00,1900,"After 12 yrs and about 20 trips to Lac Seul, you never stop learning spots that can be both a hazard and a good fishing spot at the same time. My first several years I was all over the lake, exploring, trying new spots. Lately I have kept closer to camp, fishing according to wind and season and usually catching just as many, finding the little spots on spots that produce. Some of my best catches have been within sight of camp where everybody blasts right past. I still make the 20-30 miles from camp trips, but not every day and only when the weather is right. I can't tell you how many times we fished a reef or point , not catching much, only to come back a little later and KILL them. My favorite way now is to make a milk run of 6-10 spots or so then just keep popping in and out. Whatever way you do it you can't go wrong, a great fishery. P.S. there are ALWAYS some good fish shallow, especially on weedlines. Flat sunny days you think have to go deep--try 6-8'. Good Luck"
