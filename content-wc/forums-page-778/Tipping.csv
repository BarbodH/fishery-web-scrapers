545071,Guest,2005-01-15 09:54:00,0,"If you think by paying people in those positions, a higher guaranteed wage will ensure they do a good job, you have a led a sheltered life. You need to get into the resort business and see just what it is like to get any kind of employees at all, let alone experienced, top quality employees. Cash is king with this type employee and tips is how they get the cash. Inexperienced workers understand this much: ""Wages is owed to me simply for showing up, but tips = I do good, I get cash"". Thus, they learn very quickly how to make a customer happy and that they can take home more tip cash than they get in their paychecks. For a really good service employee, wages are just a bonus."

545134,Guest,2005-01-16 06:43:00,0,"I go on vacation to have fun. I go to new places to explore and want to enjoy my time so that when I get back I have good memories. I hate getting back from a trip and having second thoughts, or wishing I would have done something different. I am not bragging, and am not saying that I am millionare, but my wife and I make a comfortable living in the Chicago area. Living in Chicago gives me a higher standard of living, but I have to go far for an outdoor experience. Most places that I have vacationed, whether it be Mexico, Canada, northern Wisconsin, Italy, Spain or elsewhere, I see great people who work their butts off because the tourist season is short, and so is their opportunity to make money. If i throw a $20 here or there extra, but it helps my vacation, and I reward someone for good service then I help reach my goal of having a great vacation. Cheap people think that tipping is bad."
545135,orchard frank,2005-01-16 08:13:00,1900,"My wife and I have been going to Canada for many years, not too many fly-ins. We always figure tips as part of the expense. It is a short season, in most cases the staff is working hard to see that you enjoy your stay. I know they enjoy recieving not only the tip, but the thought behind it. If you return to the same lodge, you are establishing a relationship. Yes it is their job, but I would not consider leaving without a ""Thank You"" and a gratuity. Plus, you might end up with brownies in your shore lunch box!!!"
545092,Guest,2005-01-14 10:53:00,0,"You tip to show your gratitude for what you felt was good service, and to act as incentive for good or even better service the next time. This is specifically why you tip at the end of the day/trip/service; to allow evaluation of the quality of the service received. You then, as the customer, have the option to tip (or not) an amount to your discretion. Tipping won't vanish. Why would you rather pay more for the service and not be expected to tip? You may then receive poor service and be left to express only verbal complaints (rather than the option of showing your displeasure by not tipping). The bottom line is it is your (the customer's) decision. Why take the decision out of the customer's hands??? Secondly, having worked extensively in the service field, most notably as a fishing guide, I can tell you other variables, such as socioeconomic background, are often equal or greater indicators of tip amount received than is the quality of the service itself."
545044,Guest,2005-01-14 12:24:00,0,Tipping is of course a very dangerous thing. Once while we were fishing on lac Seul we tipped our boat over and if we hadnt been drunk and in two foot of water we might have drowned. I dont think tipping is a good idea without a life jacket.

545057,Guest,2005-01-14 16:43:00,0,"I used to get tips when I was a guide working for a lodge owner. When I bought the lodge, the tips stopped, of course. But, a cabin cleaner, dockhand, or waitress should be tipped if they do a good job. These employees soon learn to do a good job or they leave. What I hate is restaurants that figure gratuity into the bill for you. (Last time this happened, it was our company Christmas party and I later learned our waitress and the chef were the owners of the establishment). Screw that!"

545033,Guest,2005-01-14 05:00:00,0,"Reelman, I agree with what you are saying. It is too bad that it has come to the point that tipping is expected from the person that waits our tables right on up the food chain. It should be something that is done if extrodinary service is recieved. I think in fact what has happened is that the employers pay less to the employees and the difference is expected to be picked up in tips. You the customer may pay less for the service up front, but pay for it on the back end, or tip. My own choice would be to discontinue this practice and to just pay up front, it would make things a lot easier. I don't see it changing, but I will say I feel a lot better about freely tipping the pilots (who usually are friendly, helpful guys) then receiveing a bill at a resteraunt where the tip is automaticly added on whether we like it or not."

545014,Guest,2005-01-12 20:51:00,0,"Whenever I go on vacation and stay in a hotel, I always tip the person that cleans my room. It was something I was taught as a kid. If you like the service, let it be known. When I go fishing, I always throw money on my pillow at the end of the week. My roommate thought I was an idiot. I asked around, and most of my fishing guys never even thought about tipping housekeeping. THe more I thought about it, some of my friends have only tipped a g-string in their life. Tipping the guide is a given. Tipping the float plane pilot is a given. Anyone else tip the person that cleans the cabin you live in for the week?"
545017,Guest,2005-01-12 23:29:00,0,Interesting. We always do the housekeeping thing and I am always tipping my wife. seriously I dont know if we get any services.
545018,Hawker,2005-01-13 05:22:00,3967,"Have been going to Canada for the past 12 years on the American plan and the idea of tipping the housecleaning gals and dock boys was asked by my wife who always goes with me. It was suggested to us that it is normal and customary and we have been doing so all along. Our cabin is almost always the first one cleaned each day and is always spotless. We also got into the habit of leaving a tip for the dock boys each year, and our boat is usually the first one cleaned, fueled, warmed up and ready to go each morning. Tipping does pay off in the long run in many ways, large and small. Hawker"
