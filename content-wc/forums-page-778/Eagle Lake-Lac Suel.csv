Lac Seul is easier to catch fish on in any kind of wheather and at any time of the year. Dont get me wrong, you will catch fish on Eagle but not as many or as big as you will on Lac Seul. However you need to get busy now and book a place because they flock back to Lac Seul year after year and it can be difficult to get a lodge to stay at."

The accomodations were top notch and the price was fair. The lodge is located on the north end near Vermilion Bay and the fishing was great. Trying to rearrange my schedule so we can make it back this year. After staying at dozens of resorts in MN, I was amazed at how nice this place was. Either way I think your fishing will be fine. Good luck, NC"
