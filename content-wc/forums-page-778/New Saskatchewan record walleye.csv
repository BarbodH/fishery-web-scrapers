The fish is a Saskatchewan record, and possibly an ice fishing World record. There is more info on the fish at my site http://www.westerncanadafishing.net as well as at the nipawin journal site: http://www.nipawinjournal.com. Also, all the local newspapers have info on it. Later! Travis"

545173,Guest,2005-01-18 12:01:00,0,So us Americans can understand how big it was. LOL!

Most people in Canada still go talk about getting a 10 pound walleye, not a 4.4 kilo one, or whatever it would be. Some guys talk about fish in cm's because that is what the fishing regulations are in. However, they're also listed in inches. Basically, everyone uses a little bit of both."
