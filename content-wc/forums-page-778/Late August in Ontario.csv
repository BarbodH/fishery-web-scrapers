How does Late August compare - fishing patterns, climate, bugs, crowds, etc. Typically we like Lac Seul, but are there good arguments for smaller lakes....and have lake trout moved into shallow water yet by last august? Thank - unchartered area for us."
545005,Guest,2005-01-12 12:01:00,0,"August is a good time of the year. First off, bugs are down compared to June. They won't be gone, but they will be less than June. Fishing will likely be different then what you are used to in June. Walleye will usually tend to be more spread out then spring time. The will be well established into a summer type of mode. They will be feeding, and I have found the bite tends to be consistent. If you are lucky enough to hit a stable weather pattern things should be really good. Speaking of weather... in late August you can have some hints of fall already starting. You can have a week of upper 70 low 80's, or you could get hit with rain and a cold front and highs in the 50's. Be ready for both. Crowds are not as large as June, but at the end of August you do see people getting that vacation in before school starts... kind of a last hurrah thing. It's doubtful you will see lake trout in the shallows in August. I don't usually see them shallow until the end of September brushing right up to the end of lake trout season. Any time is a great time to take a trip to Ontario fishing. Hope its a good one for you! Agate"

Can catch some awful nice ones in the narrows during that time. Just be prepared for some lumpy rides but the black flies have had their fill by then.

545013,Guest,2005-01-12 20:43:00,0,"I always went in June, but then I went and got married June 15 a few years back, and then my first child was born June 6. With Birthday parties and the anniversary, the beginning of June is all about family and I have gone on an August trip the last few years. I think there are bigger fish in June, but my best day ever number wise has been on Lac Seul in middle August. We still get a few 26 - 28 but never had anything over 30. No flies or bloodsuckers, and besides last year (very cold), the weather is usually pretty steady in August and not as many fronts coming through. I almost prefer August fishing to June. Tried something new last year and went to somewhere else instead of Lac Seul and was disappointed. Once you go to Lac Seul, you will always compare your next lake to it, and will be disappointed."
545016,2 DOGS,2005-01-12 22:23:00,361,"Big Fish: No boat yet, I'm just like the kid with his nose pressed up to the window at the candy store. Drool alot too. When are you scheduled for the big green tree? I'm gonna get GB down to Mexico in less than 3 weeks now, we'll see if we can't terrorize some of the southern fish. After last year, Pat & Patty won't go fishing with us. Something about not wanting to chum for them anymore! Pills & Patches don't always work."
545043,Big Fish,2005-01-14 12:17:00,138,We're heading up June 25 & Aug. 6. Can not believe that you are going fishing without chumm.. Patty must feel unappreciated. cw
