544993,Guest,2005-01-11 05:54:00,0,I registered a boat in Ontario about 6-7 years ago and had a kicker and electric motor. They still required 2 paddles on a 19 foot boat. It seemed to me they were most interested in the whistle and life jackets when I was checked later. They do acknowledge the requirements of the state in which it's registered though.
544974,Guest,2005-01-10 13:08:00,0,"I was on the boat and motor forum and seen were you are required to have 2 paddles in Canada for your boat. I would like to know if this is a requirement for all the Provinces of Canada? Also,is it based upon boat size or is it automatically 2 no matter the size of the boat? Thanks in advance..."
544975,Guest,2005-01-10 13:20:00,0,What size requirements are the paddles or oars?
544978,Mike M (Sask),2005-01-10 14:11:00,374,Here is a link to the Canada Coast Guard Site requirements for boats under 20 feet.http://www.tc.gc.ca/BoatingSafety/sbg-gsn/6mpower.htm Acording to it it's 1 paddle with no reference to size.
544980,retire55,2005-01-10 14:50:00,1029,"Mike: I appreciated the web reference for the coast guard requirements (one manual propelling device OR an anchor with not less than 15 m of cable, rope or chain in any combination). However, I am never very enthused when I see one or even two paddles in an outfitters boat. I would much prefer two oars to try an move a typical 15 or 16 foot fiberglass boat anywhere. As well, outfitter paddles tend be left exposed to all weather conditions and consequently are very susceptible to breakage. Indeed, last Sep, our one paddle broke right between my hands on the second stroke. I'd also hate to try and get to shore with the coast guard alternative ""an anchor with not less than 15 m of cable, rope or chain in any combination"" in a 100 m deep northern lake. Regardless the minimum recommendations of the coast guard, I prefer two oars."
544981,Mike M (Sask),2005-01-10 15:06:00,374,"Yup, you're right! I would just as soon not paddle at all! LOL We take our 18 foot boats/150Hp north with us. We travel with 2 boats plus we have electric trolling motors. Thank God we have never had much for problems but you are right... it's alot easier to row than paddle."
544983,Guest,2005-01-10 17:24:00,0,Mike thanks for the info. I have a kicker and bow trolling motor to keep me going. I just want to be in compliance with the Canadian Law with respect to a manual device.
544984,Guest,2005-01-10 17:27:00,0,"I carry a paddle, but I also make sure that I have a kicker motor to get me home if my main breaks down. A few years back, I had my lower unit go bad when I was 12 miles away from camp. Fortunately for a 6hp motor, I was able to get home (a nice leisurely ride) without too much issue. Always a good bet to have a back-up motor to get off the water. The little kickers are extremely reliable if taken care of. As for Electrics, what happens when your battery goes dead as you try to reach camp? At least with a kicker (and a little extra oil carried to dump into a main tank if needed) you can get home.. Steve"
544985,rebelrn2001,2005-01-10 17:58:00,1563,I believe you just need to be in compliance with the state (if from the US) you reside in. We were stopped a few years ago and the only thing the guy SUGGESTED was we have a rope that floats attached to the throwable PFD. I did get one because I thought it was a good idea.
544986,happy,2005-01-10 19:35:00,34,We fish out of Hudson area and the lake police require 2 paddles. You can't go wrong with 2.
544991,Guest,2005-01-10 23:43:00,0,I think what they really want is a second method of propulsion if the engine does not work. A kicker would eliminate the need for paddles BUT I have a kicker and paddles. better to have it not need it than need it and not have it. although there should be paddles for each person on board.
