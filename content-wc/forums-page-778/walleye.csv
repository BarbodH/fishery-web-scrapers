It just acurred to me that I have in my freezer some vacuum bagged walleyes and northerns from last summers trip to LOTW. I think I will get a walleye out have a shore lunch here in chicago in the middle of our snow storm tomorrow. yep got it out to thaw overnight. If I recall my wife caught this one around the sunset trail, thats about a 40 minute boat ride west of sioux narrows. And yes we see loads of totem boats and they are all friendly and courtious. have about 2 inches of snow so far here."

I might make up some fish this weekend too - WI is expecting anywhere from 2-12 inches of snow this evening/night, depending on where you are. No snow on the ground here as of now, but about 1/2 coat of ice from last weeks rain..."
