They are steel tube frames with steel roofing running length wise of the carport. I've been looking at a 18' wide by 21' long by 5' wall hieght for $795, from a company out of Illinois. A freind put one up south of Perrault Falls last summer, it will hold two boats nicely. All you would need to do then is find a place to set it up."
