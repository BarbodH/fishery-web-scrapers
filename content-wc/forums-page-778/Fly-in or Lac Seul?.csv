The fishing is great. My question is, will I have better fishing if I go on a fly-in instead of doing it myself at Lac Seul? Warrior56215"

I will never do a drive-in again, but I know others who won't pay for a fly-in. Part of the deal with a fly-in is the remote feeling you get. Having a 2500-5000 acre all to yourself is an unbelievable thing. The fish don't jump in the boat, you still have to know what you are doing. However, overall I would have to say that for sheer numbers of 15-25 inch walleyes the fly-in would win hands down. Just my two cents."

No crowding of hot spots, just us and the lake. Fishing can be up and down on flyin's just like on other lakes. Depends on the weather and season. Either way you decide have a great trip and enjoy.

The fishing seems to be good and never have read any bad comments about the lake. This trip is going to be a graduation present for a special kid, my son. We live close to Lake Erie so we fish it year around when we can. The thing that I wonder about is it a good outdoor experience as well as a good fishing hole? Or am I going to have to go on a fly-in. He's probably going to go to school for fish or wildlife management. In high school ,sports take up summers now so he,s missed out on alot of fishing trips,so I want to get this one right. Of course I'm confused on which camp to go to,whether to take the boat?(20'Lund)etc. This will all work out when i get settled on a location. Thanks for any comments."
545137,Guest,2005-01-16 11:27:00,0,"I have never been to Lac Suel. I am responding to your question about an outdoor experience. I have taken 28 fly-in tips in the past 17 years. I cannot express how much I get out of a fly-in with my wife or a foursome. The trips I have been on with 6 or 8 were not the same to me. Being on a WILDERNESS lake and no one else around except the loons a moose and a pan of fried walleye are to beat. It is not the same for everyone. Each person receives a trip in a different way. If I had a teenage son I would love to spend a week one on one in the wilderness. You can also go with an outfitter that has emergency communication . Just use your common since and be carfull ,as you are on your own. You sound like to me the two of you will have good trip whatever you do !!!!!!!!!!"
