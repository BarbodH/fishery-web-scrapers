We found a father and his two young sons fishing from shore and gave them the leeches. This was a ""new bait"" for them, so we told some ways of putting them on the hook and how to fish them. The little boys fishing with their father is a pleasant memory."
544957,Guest,2005-01-07 17:04:00,0,"A few years back, we left Friday morning instead of Saturday. We packed up and headed to the owners house to settle on bait and gas. I saw the guys from the cabin next to us go in our cabin after we left. When we were done with the owner, we went back to our cabin, and the jerks from next door were scrounging everything. They had our leftover ketchup, mayo, toilet paper, paper towels, a half gallon of peanut oil, and a 3/4 full thing of dish soap. I figured I left the stuff for the OWNER of the resort to keep or for him to leave in the cabin for the next people if he wanted. This stuff I did not really care about, but they also took the half pound of leaches in the refrigerator, and they took the cigars that we left on the table. They left the note on the table though that said ""Thanks for a great week"" that the cigars were on. I hate cheap people. They put the stuff back. I personally would never take open food items from someone else i did not know...would any of you?"
544958,Guest,2005-01-08 03:00:00,0,"Sad story there, but undoubtedly true I'm sure. Precisely why I usually ask the dock hands or resort operator about leftover bait. Wouldn't want it to go to someone like that and they would no doubt make sure it wouldn't either. I hope you told the owner about that incident. Those kind of people shouldn't be allowed to stay at a resort."
544959,Guest,2005-01-08 08:48:00,0,The owner was with us when we saw them go in our cabin. He came with us when we confronted them.
545009,Guest,2005-01-12 13:42:00,0,You left it.. forget about it At least someone was going to use it and not let it sit and rot stinkin the whole cabin up. If I was the owner I would have charged you double for leavin mayo ketchup so someone eats and gets botchilism ands sues the owner!! Unreal.. The guys that took the stuff figured it would not go to waste.
545010,Guest,2005-01-12 14:59:00,0,"Personally I would never want to eat someone elses leftovers. I do not care if they ate my leftover ketchup. I did not like that they took the bait, and the cigars. They were good cigars...it was obvious that I left the cigars for the lodge owner because I left a note, and they stole them!!! If that is OK in your book then you also must be a thief!"
545161,Thumper,2005-01-17 17:58:00,133,"Hey, Pooch I largely agree with you about the ""etiquette"" of passing a cabin on. It's nice to leave some of thee asily forgettable essentials (t.p., soap, paper towels, etc.) Someone will use them and it won't stink the place up. I also agree on the food, I think twice regarding leaving food up there. Especially on a remote outpost. If you don't know that the cabin is booked immediately upon your departure, I say destroy the food at your eagle feeding rock. If you leave food in an unattended cabin, you're just asking for problem. Critters can do a lot of damage to a cabin. Even those red squirrels can mess up a cabin to get at some walnuts left on the counter. And if a bear smells you fritos, look out for the doors and windows cuz he's coming in! As for getting after the pilots on a fly-in, the outfitters usually have to back-to-back the guests trips to make end meet. The new guys coming to camp are usually meeting the old guys leaving camp. So, checking the cabin prior to the new guests arriving frequently isn't possible. The pilot _should_ go through the cabin and facilities quickly with the new guests. This is to show the facilities like water pump, outhouse, fuels, etc. The old guests will still be there in camp. Then, if there are any obvious problems, they can be worked out. Although, if you're chewing out the old guests when you arrive in camp for not cleaning the grill, they may not give you accurate tips regardiung their honey spots, so it's a balancing act. Indignation vs Civility"

Anyone ever do this, I guess its not only a friendly thing to do and it is better than dumping the bait overboard."

544888,Pooch,2005-01-01 16:01:00,4619,"We always leave excess bait in the fridge or cabin. As long as your not just ""skipping out"" of cleaning up your own mess. We have had trips where the left over bait carried us through the week. So we always ""pass it on"". Same goes for extra beer or soft drinks. Food sometimes is another matter. Coming into a cabin you never know how long some of it has been there. Anything that has been opened is usually destoyed or dumped out when we get to the cabin. Always tons of jelly, peanut butter and that stuff. It is always a nice gesture to leave some of your excess TP and paper towels behind also. There is a lot of unwritten ""etiquette"" involved when leaving a cabin ready for the next group. Number one thing is to CLEAN it up before you leave. Nobody wants to spend the first few hour in camp cleaning up another groups mess. We did that last year and we were p------ to say the least. Any camp operators out there that do change overs on remote lakes please take note of what I just said. Have your pilots check the cabins before flying the group out. Or, every group puts down a cleaning deposit and if they trash it and leave the incoming group gets the deposit. Sorry for the rant. Pooch"
544955,Guest,2005-01-06 22:46:00,0,"I always offer it to the dock hand or lodge operator if they are around. Sometimes they will take it back if they are running low, but most times they will suggest someone to give it to. I only give away the bait I've already bought from the resort though. Crawlers I leave as a tip for the guys on the dock to sell or give to someone who takes care of them. It's just good etiquette to offer it back to the resort first."
