565445,Guest,2007-05-19 13:47:00,0,I don't see any posts this year about netting on LOW. I take it that the concerns have been addressed? It is my understanding that a major portion of the problem was that one individual was taking a multi-lake quota entirely from LOW instead of spreading that quota over all the lakes his quota was good for. The MNR was going to put a stop to that practice. Is this true?

565473,Guest,2007-05-21 06:22:00,0,This is what a guy in Tbay was doing when he came face to face with the natives who set the nets. He was looking at the business end of a .303. Needless to say don't think he'll be doing that again........
