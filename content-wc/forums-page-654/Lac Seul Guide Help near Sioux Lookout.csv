565340,Guest,2007-05-16 17:01:00,0,I was hoping someone might have some contacts for a guide on Lac Seul for the day. We are heading up in June. Thank you! Chad

We took Nate with us up on Lac Seul last year, and he showed us a BUNCH of great spots, and we caught many fish slot or better."
565366,Guest,2007-05-17 07:53:00,0,"Try Silver Water Wheel Lodge... it is centrally located on Lac Seul - so a little way's away from where you are looking, but the Walleye fishing and guide service is second to none. And I know that they have occasionally guided day trippers, as I was a guide there and did it myself. Cheers, J. p.s. Check out the website, I am sure you will be impressed with the quality and quantity of huge Walleye they routinely catch... it was an unbelievable place to spend a summer."

565480,Guest,2007-05-21 09:12:00,0,"I realize that it is a 'ways' from Sioux Lookout (please note that I did write: ""so a little way's away from where you are looking""), but I thought the information could still be of some use... people have driven further for less. And as for when I guided there, I believe it was 2003 (the last low water year). What can I say, if nothing else, I am loyal. Cheers, J. p.s. The way that I figure it, with the price of gas and the weak US dollar, the resorts can use as much help as they can get."

565500,Jigger1,2007-05-21 20:23:00,234,"Who doesn't know who the Bum is? By the way NWO, you going to be dropping in this year during our stay?"
