565568,slug72,2007-05-24 17:08:00,34,Anyone ever been to Bear Lake Wilderness Camp near Espanola? I realize that this may be a bit more east than a lot of you guys venture but I thought I would give it a shot. It looks like they have quality more than quantity of walleye but have good multispecies fishing. Thanks in advance. Chris
