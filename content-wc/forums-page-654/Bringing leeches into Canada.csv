565464,sanmatt,2007-05-20 17:32:00,11,"No! Leeches and live minnows may NOT be brought into Canada. Nightcrawlers packed in bedding, (NO SOIL) may be brought in as can frozen or salted minnows, other than smelt. Smelt are asexual (both male and female) and the eggs remain viable even after freezing. Best to plan ahead and buy leeches after you cross the border. Marble-eye Matt"
565466,retire55,2007-05-20 19:51:00,1029,Sanmatt: Are you positive that the ban against transport of live leeches into Ontario is a Canada wide ban as well? I ask this question because correspondence I had with Quebec authorites last year indicated no such ban for that province.
