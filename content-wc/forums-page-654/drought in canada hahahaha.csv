Lovin it. Walleye slow,owner says my just be off spawn. Still avg size for us has been 22-23 We are here for two weeks so we have been drifting more and not sitting on them when we find them. Trout are hitting very good.Need a fire every night but one so for forcast looks like it is getting colder again.I believe fire ban has been lifted here because of rain. They were burning brush yesterday and had fires at shore lunch.Levels shoud be coming up"
