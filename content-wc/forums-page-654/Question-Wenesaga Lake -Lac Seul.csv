565346,Guest,2007-05-16 19:58:00,0,Winnasaga flows into Lac Seul. Mouth of Winnasaga River (on LS) is off limits until like June 1st. That area is know as the walleye santurary. To bad all rivers aren't off limits until the span is over! That will get a few feathers ruffled! Set the hook!

565385,Guest,2007-05-17 15:41:00,0,that doesn't sound right. lac seul and st joe are at near record lows for this time of year. i think wenasaga lies between them. might be wrong. ????
565460,Guest,2007-05-20 13:51:00,0,the wenesaga river empties in to the nw corner of lac-seul. the wenesaga lake has an inlet and outlet which is the wenesaga river. been there twice next week will be 3rd time awesome
