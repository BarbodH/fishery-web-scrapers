I usually buy a bunch from Cabellas and bring them in.......anyone aware of any rule that will prohibit that this year???"
564946,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-05-04 15:33:00,80,"Not really sure of the rules, but I've got a friend who's going with me this year that has used them in the past. He said he did really well with them. He's planning on taking some this year too. Just guessing, but I think it's only live minnows that are a problem. The MNR doesn't want any non-native fish reproducing in their lakes. It's kinda funny because last year was my first trip to Canada. I went to Dogtooth Lake. It's about 20 miles from Kenora. My buddies gave me a hard time all week because I caught a couple of bullheads. Traveled 700 miles to catch bullheads! :muahaha: I don't think they are native to that area. Someone years ago probably dumped a minnow bucket. Anyway, for what it's worth, I think you'll be ok. Joe"

565505,Guest,2007-05-22 11:07:00,0,Just returned from Canada salted minnows were still OK. But with the questions we were asked I think that in the next 2-5 years we will not beable to bring any live bait in. Also for your info if you have any beef product make sure it is labeled so if you try to bring the extras home you do not have to throw $20 steaks away. We had no problem we had venison that was processed in the states with legal package markings. It took us longer to get back in the to go over. Very nice at the border but just trying to be informative. later.
