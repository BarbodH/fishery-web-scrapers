565491,mschaunaman,2007-05-21 12:59:00,1,It's not going to affect any fishing or hunting I do this year. Last year I spent well over $5000 in gas between all the fishing and hunting trips. And I imagine it will be over $6000-6500 this year.
565515,bensen,2007-05-22 21:48:00,155,"So it's a little extra cash. So what, it's worth it if your really enjoy it. I go to Lac Suel in June with the guys & Lake of the Woods in July with the wife & kid. We love it. If you butt cheeks squrim at the cost of gas, stay home & leave the fish for me. Good luck."
565516,scott_r,2007-05-22 22:25:00,88,"Wait till you Americans fill up at the pumps here in Canada. We are at $1.20 per litre, if I convert what you are paying it works to around .90 cents Prices suck but Im no wear near cutting back on my fishing, eating out yes, joy riding yes, Ill cut those out but fishing and hunting will always be a part of my life."
565522,Guest,2007-05-23 10:54:00,0,"Yup I'm not going hardly anywhere right now. I'm aging the gas in my vehicle just like fine Crown Royal in the bottle. I've went three months and haven't put on 3k miles. Ooops, that doesn't work does it? I'm one of those idiots with the 80k in my tow rig and boat and the price of gas affecting me. Seems strange I know but it does. Something about filling my boat and sub the other day and it was $200. Thank god my boat was only half empty. (I hold about 100 gallons total) The boat on order is already sold. The next one will be smaller. I'm getting rid of one of my 4 x 4's. I don't drive to shop, I'll pay the shipping. I'm eating out less or when we do it's much cheaper. I was one of those guys last year saying gas, smasch, who cares? This year, I view it as it isn't ever going down and my pay isn't going up as fast. It's called math. I see giving up tourneys. I see giving up walleyes (too far to drive for them from where I live) I see a lot of choices. We drive 25,000 miles per year / 14 mpg = 1800 gallons About 400 gallons of boat gas 2200 x 3.75 = $8,250 2200 x 3.30 = $7,260 2200 x 2.00 = $4,400 In other words, if I DON'T reduce my gas consumption it will cost me an addition 3-4k per year. That's not only a trip to Canada, that's an incredible trip to Canada! If you make 50k per year (I know some make more, some less), you could basically receive a 10% increase and be wiped out after taxes in petrol alone without rising insurance costs to boot. Something has to change for my family. Since my fishing isn't a priority when you look at it - the change is with me somehow. It's that simple."

It's that simple. > But Then while you are lowering your standard of living, you can console yourself with the fact that Exxon Mobil gave their retiring chief only $400 Million as a GIFT when he retired earlier this year (no parachute deal, no contract deal, no earned but delayed bonus, nothing associated with performance -- JUST AN OUTRIGHT GIFT voted to him by the board of directors!). That poor guy will have to scrimp to get by too now. So, it isn't just US tightening our belts. :-)"
565195,Guest,2007-05-11 22:22:00,0,I am not going to make any trips to Erie because of the price of gas. I also didnt make any trips last yr. I still had fun on local lakes and still took my trip to Florida for two months.
565197,Guest,2007-05-11 23:38:00,0,"Between towing the boat 1600 miles roundtrip and filling my boat's 56 gallon tank twice, I'll spend close to $1000 just on gas. That's $2000 on gas for my two trips this year to LOTW. When I first started going to Canada in the 80s I spent $300 for the whole trip. I'm fortunate to be able to afford it. But I understand why some guys are making trips closer to home. The border problems don't help either. The NW Ontario Tourist Association and camp owners are very concerned. Two years ago, we got to the LCBO in Rainy River to buy beer and my credit card company had put a hold on my credit card. We had spent almost $500 on gas on the trip up between filling the truck's tank four times and the boat's tank before we crossed the border, and that had triggered the fraud alert. They couldn't believe we could spend $500 on gas in 12 hours. I got a kick out of that."
565243,IaCraig,2007-05-14 11:52:00,434,"Not by itself, but it is a factor. Like others when it used to be a ""guys"" trip everyone would split the tab and it ended up costing about $250 per person. Now that I take my wife & family instead, I end up paying the entire bill and with inflation & lower exchange rates it is closer to $2000 than $1000. It used to be a no-brainer, but now it is something I need to budget for and I just plain didn't start the budget in time for a 2007 trip. IaCraig"
565261,Guest,2007-05-14 19:52:00,0,I used to pay 5 cents for a candy bar. Come on guys if $100.00 more questions if you should go you don't love it enough. See you up there.
565268,2746,2007-05-15 09:14:00,3206,"Hasn't stopped us yet as we have two trips planned this year, but.....\our group has talked about it. A combination of gas prices, loss of the tax rebate from Canada and the currency exchange has significantly raised the price of a Canada trip. We are guessing we'll see an increase in camp prices next year because of the currency thing and, if that happens, we'll look more closely at trips here in the states. In the end however it will be hard to give it up!"
565271,jigman 2003,2007-05-15 10:11:00,981,"If you find somewhere here in the states where I can have a lake to myself for a week and the walleye fishing is fantastic, please p.m. me. I'll give up Canada too once I find that place here."
565275,Guest,2007-05-15 12:09:00,0,"I have enough cash for gas to get to Canada......not sure if I'll have enough to get home. hehehe!!!! O'Wella don't have to report back to work until the end of Aug.....a summer in the ""northland"" sounds great!!!"
565295,Guest,2007-05-15 21:57:00,0,"My answer to the original question is Yes....it is affecting my trip to Canada this year.....I'm going to go twice. The answer for me is simple, the extra cost for gas is very small compared to the cost of going anywhere else where I have to take my wife along. Thank's to the fishing God's she has not interested in coming along, my brother for one trip and my son and grandson for another, life is good."

565157,Cameron Muir,2007-05-10 17:02:00,11,"T-Mac, Sorry to hear that. We appreciate the American tourist. I might have to buy myself a bus; and get a little ""US-SK booze cruise"" in operation. I'd like to think that our government will wise up and lower its fuel taxes that are hidden in the price, but that is just wishful thinking. Canada signed on to the Kyoto Accord, so if anything, I wouldn't be surprised if the government raises fuel taxes, keeping even more tourists away. -Cameron Muir"
565165,Guest,2007-05-10 20:03:00,0,going in 16 days. my $1000 dollar trip is now over $2000 the past several years. I drive 1250 miles each way towing a boat. I take my kids so no one helps on gas. Still going but it hurts. Usally go 3 times per year but probably only twice this year. Plan to keep going as long as I can. It is my favorite thing to do. good fishing macdonald
565167,Guest,2007-05-10 20:06:00,0,"OK you guys rationlize the trip anyway you want. the oil companys just love to read this on sites like this. it could be an oil guy maybe even bush or cheney that asked the question. they see these answers and say great we will just keep raising the price because the americans dont care yet. come on now i KNOW you guys know how to lie , you know how that 2 pound fish turns into a ten pounder! when it comes to a question like that DONT tell the truth."
565176,Guest,2007-05-11 07:30:00,0,"I can go to Canada with my wife and stay in a basic but very clean cottage for 2 weeks right on the lake for under $2,000. For me, still well worth it."
565179,Guest,2007-05-11 09:02:00,0,"LOL, ya I'm sure the oil companies browse this site every day."

565192,dewyg,2007-05-11 19:08:00,1006,"T-Mac are you interested in coming to LOTW this fall? I have a house on the lake, we can fish out of my 2025 le. If you are interested email me at [email protected]. If you come later in the fall we can hunt some whitetail, I took Tom Backer out two years ago I think he had a good time. It saves hauling a rig up and accomadations you can split the gas for the boat. Darryl"
565135,Guest,2007-05-10 08:52:00,0,Is anybody not going to Canada this year because of high gas prices?
565137,Guest,2007-05-10 09:08:00,0,not us. If $30-$40 means the difference in going/staying home you should not be considering the trip anyway.
565138,Guest,2007-05-10 09:28:00,0,>not us. If $30-$40 means the difference in going/staying home >you should not be considering the trip anyway. I agree. I will lose that much money in Lures and spilled booze.

565143,T Mac,2007-05-10 11:10:00,10084,"I hate to say it, after all these years...but, yes. Our group made the decision last fall while at Tobin, that the trip was getting too pricey for our group to continue...some being retired now, and all. And, that was before the gas prices really got crazy! It wasn't just the gas. The exchange rate is probably more of a factor. It just seemed like everything took a big hike all in one year. Bummer!!! Over the past 20 plus annual trips,....we sure had a lot of good times there, and we saw the river at its' best...before it got ""discovered"".. ;)"
565146,Guest,2007-05-10 13:03:00,0,"Lets see, My vehicle uses around 130 gallons of gas round trip (2,280 miles). At $2.00/gallon thats $260. At $3.00/gallon thats $390. $130 won't keep me from going. Heck, that's less than what four cases of Blue costs up there...., I need to cut back anyway. LOL"

565150,Guest,2007-05-10 14:49:00,0,It's not the price increase of the trip- but the price increase of gas that eats away from my vacation fund through out the year thats hurting me. Maybe last year going if prices stay high for the rest of this year and next.
565151,jaym,2007-05-10 15:22:00,89,"Go now, in a couple of years you'll say ""geez, we should have went to Canada fishing when gas was ONLY $3.00 a gallon"""
565153,T Mac,2007-05-10 15:33:00,10084,Scarey thought...but I know you are right.
