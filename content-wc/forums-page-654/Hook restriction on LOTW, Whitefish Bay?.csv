565457,Guest,2007-05-20 11:13:00,0,fished with a guide there last year and it was never mentioned?? Not that makes us any more/less liable but that's as much as I know?
565461,Guest,2007-05-20 15:23:00,0,It has been effect for well over a decade! I think it is only in the winter though and barbed comes into effect with on 3rd Saturday in May. Better check to be sure though. Same deal with minnows. No live minnows during the same period.
