Ive been going 9 years now and sometimes twice a year. Tough to do on a teachers salary but what a way to recharge my batteries. Barb really likes to fish to so what more can a man ask for. Say hi to your family and good fishin. Besides the 1st week of June I will be back up the last part of JUne, 1st week of JUly over the 4th. Good Fishin."
