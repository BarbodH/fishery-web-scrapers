565420,Guest,2007-05-18 11:17:00,0,I found Flatrock quite a bit south (ssw) of Ignace at N48 18.071 W90 14.113
565435,Guest,2007-05-18 21:23:00,0,The Flatrock you want is not that one - Flatrock/Arethusa are around 49 40 but I am not a GPS person so will wait for an expert to give you the exact coordinates
