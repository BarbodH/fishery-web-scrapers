563168,Guest,2007-02-03 08:47:00,0,This a large problem that could impact all of us. I am from New York and the state DEC is taking measures to control the spread of this problem. I take one or two trips to Canada each year for a week. We always follow the rules. Minnows are from the local dealer and we take our nightcralers in the proper containers and such. We enjoy fishing in Cananda and want to help preserve it. Thanks Jay
563370,Guest,2007-02-13 14:34:00,0,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE January 25, 2007 Contacts: Kelley Smith 517-373-3375, Gary Whelan 517-373-6948 or Mary Dettloff 517-335-3014 Department of Natural Resources Confirms Spread of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) in Great Lakes Recent analyses of fish sampled from northern Lake Huron have confirmed the existence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) in lake whitefish, walleyes and Chinook salmon, Department of Natural Resources fisheries officials announced today. VHS is a virus that causes disease in fish but does not pose any threat to public health. The analyses that were completed earlier this week establish that VHS has now been confirmed in lake whitefish samples from the Cheboygan area, in lake whitefish and walleye samples from the Thunder Bay area, and in Chinook salmon samples from the Swan River egg-take station near Rogers City. ""The continuing march of VHS through the waters of the Great Lakes is a major challenge to our agency and our management options,"" said DNR Director Rebecca A. Humphries. ""These new discoveries are extremely unfortunate and further highlight the problems created by the constant introductions of new diseases from outside of the Great Lakes region, the speed with which they can spread, and the threat that such pathogens pose to our natural resources."" VHS was detected in lake whitefish from the Cheboygan area after re-analyzing samples collected in 2005 during a survey for bacterial kidney disease (BKD). ""It is not unusual for us to collect fish that have unknown viruses, which typically require a significant effort to properly identify,"" said Gary Whelan, fish production manager for the DNR. ""Once we had indications of VHS in other samples of fish from Lake Huron, this sample was retrieved from storage and fully analyzed by Dr. Mohamed Faisal at Michigan State University."" Samples from the Thunder Bay area were collected last fall during a mortality event that included lake whitefish and walleyes. ""At the time, we suspected that the cause of the mortality might be related to VHS,"" said Kelley Smith, chief of the DNR Fisheries Division. ""Because the fish were so badly decomposed, however, it is still not certain that VHS caused these fish to die since botulism was also a possible cause. But given the detection of VHS and the fact that the mortality occurred during the spawning season both implicate VHS as the probable cause of death of these fish."" A number of Chinook salmon observed at the Swan River egg-take station last fall also showed signs of VHS infection, Whelan said. A standard fish health inspection that is annually conducted by the DNR Fisheries Division on this key broodstock did document VHS in both female and male fish, including one fish exhibiting clinical signs of VHS. Standard methods for disinfecting the eggs were applied last fall at the egg-take station prior to transfer of the eggs to the state's hatchery facilities. To date, all lots of Chinook salmon hatched from these eggs and being reared in DNR hatchery facilities have been tested and all are negative for VHS, which is attributable to the disinfection methods that have been employed at all the DNR's egg-take stations for many years. ""This shows that our standard disinfection procedures, similar to those used on the West Coast where VHS has been found for a long time, were effective in protecting our hatcheries and the fish reared in those hatcheries,"" Whelan said. DNR officials have been in contact with personnel in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, alerting them to the new confirmations of VHS in Lake Huron fish, and outlining the steps being taken by the DNR in response to this new information. ""In the continued battle to slow the spread of VHS throughout the Great Lakes, we must remain vigilant, take every precaution, and implement all options available to us,"" Smith said. Those actions include: * Reclassification of Michigan's waters of Lake Huron, including Saginaw Bay, as a VHS Positive Management Area. In addition to Lake Huron, the management area encompasses the state's waters of the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River and Lake Erie. * Reclassification of Michigan's waters of the St. Marys River from the Soo Locks to Lake Huron and all of Lake Michigan as a VHS Surveillance Management Area. * Sampling efforts for several fish species, including walleyes, emerald shiners and lake whitefish will be significantly increased in the new VHS Surveillance Management Area. * Additional testing of all lots of Chinook salmon in the state's hatchery facilities that originated from eggs collected at the Swan River weir will be conducted prior to stocking those fish in the state's waters. * A prohibition on the trap and transfer of live fish that are collected from the state's waters of the Great Lakes for management purposes unless the fish have tested negative for VHS. * Increased efforts to inform anglers and others about the dangers of VHS, especially to inland waters of the state. Anglers are asked not to move live fish between the Great Lakes and inland waters, particularly minnow species, and to use standard disinfection techniques for boats, live wells and other equipment. See www.michigan.gov/dnrfishing for more information on helping prevent the spread of disease and invasive species on the Great Lakes. Citizens are encouraged to report sick fish or fish kills to their local DNR office or use the DNR Web site at www.michigan.gov/dnr. Anglers should contact the DNR if they observe fish that exhibit any of the following signs: hemorrhaging in the skin, including large red patches particularly on the sides and anterior portion of the head; multiple hemorrhages on the liver, spleen, or intestines; or hemorrhages on the swim bladder that give the otherwise transparent organ a mottled appearance. This information will help DNR fisheries staff to track VHS and take appropriate management actions to help slow the spread of this virus. Anglers and boaters can also help prevent the spread of VHS and other viruses or bacteria that cause disease in fish by not transferring fish between water bodies, and by thoroughly cleaning boats, trailers, nets, and other equipment when traveling between different lakes and streams. The use of a light disinfectant such as a solution of one part chlorine bleach to 10 parts water (i.e., one gallon of bleach to 10 gallons of water) to clean vessels and live wells is very effective against VHS and other viruses and bacteria that cause disease in fish. Soaking exposed items such as live wells, nets, anchors, and bait buckets in a light disinfectant for 30 minutes is also an effective method to prevent the spread of a wide range of aquatic nuisance species. In 2005, VHS was detected for the first time in Great Lakes fish species in the US and Canada, including muskellunge in Michigan's waters of Lake St. Clair and freshwater drum in Lake Ontario. It is not known how VHS was transferred to the Great Lakes region or how long it has been in the waterways of the Great Lakes. The DNR is committed to conservation, protection, management, use and enjoyment of the state's natural resources for current and future generations Still think it is just a Southern Ontario Problem?? we all northerners and us in the south need to work together on this issue.. and not stick our heads in the sand.

564026,Guest,2007-03-20 15:08:00,0,"Ontario Baitfish Update.......Mar.17, 2007 Stand by folks.....we had meetings this past week with our Federal MP Hon. Bev Shipley, a lengthy phone conersation with our MPP Hon. Maria VanBommel, a long meeting yesterday with the Hon. Sandra Pupatello MPP Windsor West Minister of Economic Development, and Trade Minister Responsible for Women's Issues ........and a meeting is scheduled for early this week with the Minister of Tourism, the Hon. Jim Bradley MPP St.Catherines.... ...there's some important info coming down the pipe, we hope, very shortly. Please be aware that we do not disagree with the briefing paper that was recently delivered by the province's partner in all this, Michigan DNR, to all stakeholders and affected government agencies, including those in Ontario, both Federal and provincial.....and we understand fully the seriousness of the VHS issue and fully support their initiative to curtail the spread of this pathogen into uninfected waters. We also fully understand that there is NO CURE for VHS once it enters a body of water. We fully understand that any legislative decision should be based on up-to-date science and not a knee jerk reaction. We also fully understand that this is an alleged ballast water issue that the bait and sportfishing industry is solely being held accountable for, and as such, is seriously jeopardizing the livleyhoods AND way of life of a large number of people on both sides of this immediate border, not to mention the impact on the Tourism, Fishing Tackle and Marine Trade Industries plus Government Tax coffers. We fully understand that there is absolutely NO RISK TO HUMANS from VHS. We also fully understand that VHS has been documented in the present ""INFECTED ZONE"" since 2003 and new evidence may suggest possibly as far back as 1988. We fully understand that VHS has now been documented within 20 miles of the Straits of Mackinaw in 2005 and is also currently being investigated as the possible cause of a major fish die off in Lower Lake Michigan earlier this year.. Here is a link to that briefing paper.....click or cut and paste it into your browser......http://www.savethebaitbusiness.com/d...et20070226.pdf Here is the parent link that also contains a lot of up to date info.......http://www.savethebaitbusiness.com In the meantime we are asking everyone to contact their MP and MPP ...or their State Representative or Congressman... and ask them to back a solution that would allow bait to be CAUGHT WITHIN THE INFECTED ZONE, transported, sold and contained for use ONLY WITHIN THE INFECTED ZONE, HOWEVER WAY THAT ZONE IS DEFINED. Every gov't official we have spoken to has agreed, ""off the record"", that the scientific evidence says this is the correct solution, but the problem is that MP's, MPP's within the infected and buffer zones are not hearing from anyone other than the bait dealers and they have told us that THEY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU ON THIS ISSUE. NY State is already modifying their legislation, effective Mar.15, to suit their specific need, using the available scientific evidence. The infected zone CANNOT GET ANY MORE INFECTED THAN IT ALREADY IS and there is NO CURE, so the common sense solution would be to allow bait to be caught, transported, sold and contained for use WITHIN THE INFECTED ZONE. As per the International Joint Commission, the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, the Great Lakes Fisheries Council, USDA(APHIS), Ag Canada(FIA), DFO, Michigan DNR and Ontario MNR it is acknowledged that once a body of water is infected it will stay infected because THERE IS NO CURE. It is our opinion that Provincial and Federal officials appear to be utilizing USDA/Michigan DNR/Penn DNR/NY DNR etc. data such as test results and DNA sampling to generate legislation, as there has been apparently no known testing by Canadian Laboratories to this point. Time is of the essence so please make the calls on Monday of next week. We need you to get your elected officials involved. COMMON SENSE SOLUTION-----allow bait to be caught WITHIN THE INFECTED ZONE, transported, sold and contained for use ONLY WITHIN THE INFECTED ZONE, HOWEVER WAY THAT ZONE IS DEFINED.

564194,Guest,2007-03-30 16:57:00,0,"TAFF GUIDELINES CONTROL OF VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA (VHS) MARCH 29, 2007 The following guidelines are provided for clarity and consistency in the implementation of management actions to document and control the spread of VHS from currently documented VHS positive waters to other waters within the province. Questions or unusual circumstances not covered in the guidelines should be directed to the appropriate staff contact. 1) Definition of positive waters VHS positive waters are now defined as the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron (including Georgian Bay), their connecting waterways and adjacent tributaries up to the first impassable barrier for all fish species. Where fish are manually transferred over barriers or pass through a fishway, that barrier will not be considered to be impassable. Low head lamprey weirs or dams that do not normally stop salmonid passage also are not considered impassable. Waters associated with the Rideau Lakes/Trent Severn waterways are considered to be VHS free at the current time. MNR is working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to undertake a surveillance program for 2007 to provide better information on the current distribution of VHS. 2) Wild spawn collections a) Salmonids  No restrictions will be imposed on collection of salmonid eggs from VHS positive waters if all eggs are disinfected during water-hardening as per the MNR VHS disinfection protocol (dated October 10, 2006). Spawn collections (any species) from positive waters without disinfection in accordance with the approved protocol, will only be approved if the rearing facility is located in VHS positive waters and all fish in the facility will be stocked into VHS positive waters. Any new licences (Licence to Collect Fish for Aquaculture) issued for the collection of gametes for salmonids from positive waters should contain the following condition to avoid restrictions as per a) above: All wild salmonid eggs collected must be treated during water hardening according to the MNR approved VHS-disinfection protocol (dated October 10, 2006) and documented for reporting to and audit by MNR A practical disinfection procedure based on the MNR VHS-disinfection protocol is described in Fish Culture Technical Bulletin  Best Management Practices  Egg Disinfection and Incubation Procedures, BMP 2007- 01 (separate attachment). Appropriate measures must also be taken to avoid VHS cross-contamination of the eggs, equipment and rearing facilities. Refer to the BMP bulletin for applicable procedures and recommended practices. cool.gif Walleye  There currently is no approved disinfection procedure for non-salmonids. Walleye spawn collections from positive waters will only be allowed if they are to be stocked into positive waters and the receiving culture facility is located in the VHS-positive zone (i.e., discharges effluent to positive waters). The Ministry will endeavour to supply, free of charge, reasonable numbers of eggs to partner non-profit groups from its internal VHS-free captive adult walleye stock for projects where genetics are not a concern. If supplies allow and partner requests are met, the Ministry will also supply eggs to the private sector on a cost recovery basis (approximately $21/1000) or equivalent (exchange of fish such as catchable rainbow trout for eggs). There is also the option to look for other spawn collection sources outside of VHS positive waters. Walleye egg collections that have historically collected from identified VHS positive waters to meet partner and private sector requirements, should be screened and prioritized by the applicable district. Districts are encouraged to proactively contact impacted partners and private sector operators to determine their interest in receiving eggs. Requirements should be forwarded from the District Stocking Coordinator to Scott Watson by April 23rd, 2007, so that decisions can be made on distributions of available Ministry eggs. c) Muskellunge - Fish culture staff are currently working with district staff and two partners including Sir Sandford Fleming College to develop a process for muskellunge egg collections, VHS-disinfection, culture using appropriate bio-secure facilities and fish health testing of fish for Lake Simcoe and a Great Lakes rehabilitation request. Details on this process will be provided separately as they develop, to appropriate individuals involved with the project. Community Fisheries and Wildlife Involvement Program (CFWIP) applications should only be approved and funded for any projects that are in compliance with these guidelines. Conditions in letters of agreement with partners should reflect any necessary controls as per the guidelines. Any other egg collections from positive waters, other than the above should be discussed with MNR. 3) Aquaculture operations Fish currently in facilities (private or partner) where eggs were collected prior to this spring will not have restrictions retroactively placed on stocking or transfers. Any eggs, or fish cultured from eggs, collected from VHS positive waters this spring and henceforth for which the proponent cannot certify or demonstrate that their eggs, fish or facility water supply are VHS free will be restricted to stocking into VHS positive waters only. This could include demonstrating their eggs were properly disinfected and their water supply is outside of VHS positive waters, or that fish health testing has indicated the fish are VHS free. Use of live feeds (i.e., sucker fry, minnows or other wild-origin fish species) for feeding any fish at rearing facilities must also comply with these spawn collection and aquaculture operations guidelines. Use of such live feed is generally not recommended as it poses a fish health risk to culture operations. If live feed is used it must come from VHS-free water sources. Live feeds taken from VHS-positive waters will result in a VHS-positive designation for the rearing facility and all fish produced at that facility, in which case the facility must be located in the VHS-positive zone and all its fish must either be stocked only in positive waters or killed for processing before leaving the rearing site. CFWIP applications should only be approved and funded for any projects that are in compliance with these guidelines. Conditions in letters of agreement with partners should reflect any necessary controls as per the guidelines. 4) Harvest and transfer of baitfish MNR is working with the BAO to implement the following changes:  Expanding the VHS positive zone to include FMZ's 13 and 14.  Redefining the VHS positive zone boundary to include barriers to fish migration on tributaries and road networks based on local assessment  Removing the interim Buffer control zone  Re-instatement of commercial harvest within the VHS positive zone subject to additional restrictions on fish movement to within the zone only The above will require licence amendments for all commercial bait licences. Guidelines are forthcoming that will provide a consistent and timely approach to these changes once a final approach has been developed and approved. This is expected by early May. 5) Fishway operations and fish transfers Movement of migratory fish over barriers via fishways or by manual transfer, that were in place for 2006 or earlier, will continue to be allowed for 2007 spring and fall. No new fish passage will be considered without an impact assessment which evaluates criteria including:  species of fish impacted and involved,  number of fish in the spawning run,  relative importance of spawning population/recruitment  amount of additional water to which access is gained,  impacts on other resource users, and  the status of the species being considered. Fish and Wildlife Branch approval is required to approve any new expansion due to transfers or fishways. Circumstances and requests should be forwarded to Steve Kerr. The decision to allow ongoing fishway operations and transfers for 2007 is for a one year period pending acquisition of better surveillance information, additional consultation with stakeholders and a detailed risk assessment of each location to determine a longer term position. This will be completed prior to the 2008 spring operations. Further details will be provided on this process once available. CFWIP applications should only be approved and funded for any projects that are in compliance with these guidelines. Conditions in letters of agreement with partners should reflect any necessary controls as per the guidelines. 6) Scientific collector's permits The Ministry has limited authority to impose additional conditions based on the current OFRs. The Ministry can request, however, the applicant to address specific concerns as part of the application process and consider the applicant's response and proposed controls in deciding whether to issue a permit or not. Applications for Scientific Collector permits for collection and transfer of live fish from VHS positive waters must address collection, disposal of fish and treatment of effluent to minimize spread of VHS. A copy of Best Management Practices are being prepared and will be available in the near future. These should be provided, once available, with all approved Scientific Collector permits involving fish collected from VHS positive waters. 7) Transport and sale of live commercial (food) fish Transport and sale of live fish is considered a low risk. The Ministry will implement an education/public awareness campaign targeted at live fish wholesalers and retailers to minimize potential for spread of VHS through this activity. A Canuck"

565495,Guest,2007-05-21 14:45:00,0,The fact that the same people that fish in the Winnebago system also fish with the same equipment in many canadian lakes and river systems makes this an appropriate post on the CANADA board.

562993,Guest,2007-01-26 06:38:00,0,Anyone fishing the Detroit river this spring better be very very careful. mnr/dnr will be out in full force and transportation of minnows back and forth across the border is going too lead too some serious fines. You also cant transport live fish from on a boat from Ontario back into michigan anymore. thats going too lead too serious problems with the tourneys that run on the Detroit river.
563048,jake,2007-01-29 08:36:00,1694,"since the finding of vhs in fish from the thunder bay area, this will be a northern ontario issue too. http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7...0980--,00.html voyageur: it's at the top because of it's importance. it was requested to be pinned to the top and the mods thought that it was a good thing for all to see and keep in mind. all border fishermen will be affected by vhs, especially those who travel across a border by boat or those who fish infected waters and then travel to inland lakes too. when we lose the 2nd. amendment the others will be history too!"
563061,Guest,2007-01-29 17:59:00,0,I am kinda surprised Judging by the amount of views this thread has 2000+ only 5 replies? I assumed people would acually care about something that has the chance of leading to MASSIVE fish die offs. Think this does not effect you because you fish the near north? If the word doesnt get out the lakes in the Near North will also be affected. Used to being able to bring your own minnows with you? think again. Used to pick them up long the way.. I wouldnt advise it. Your best bet to help control this is to purchase minnows from the resort owners where you are staying knowing they are locally caught and removing 99.9% of the possibility that you could be infecting our waters with VHS. The bait dealers are not happy with this desicion one bit and are clearly voicing their opinions but if we dont take corrective measures now I dont even want to imagine what it is going to look at in 5 years..
