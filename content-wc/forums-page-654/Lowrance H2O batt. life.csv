Thanks You can adjust from 2 sec a update to 10 sec a update {If I remember right} The longer you set the update, the less Juice it will take. its a difference of 2 AA batteries for 1.5 days of fishing VS 4AA batteries for one day of fishing. Best bet, use rechargable:-)"
565355,Hawker,2007-05-17 04:54:00,3967,I've been taking my H20 up for the past two years and did not take enough AA batteries the first year. Last year I got a 12-Volt battery adaptor that has two alligator clamps with a three foot cord and has a receptacle that you can plug into with the 12 Volt power cord for you H20. I just clip onto the battery in the boat and didn't have to use a single AA battery at all last year and will be taking it with me again this year. It is made by Optronics and I found it in the fishing/boating section at our local Wal-Mart. Don't know if you have a Wal-Mart in your area or not but I'm sure you can find the same thing at just about any fishing/boating supply store. I just now did a google search for it and provided a link to one place you can get it on line just for an example. It's called an Optronics A-203 Battery Adaptor (http://www.eburch.biz/optronics_battery_adapter.htm) and I paid about the same amount at Wally World last year if memory serves correct (under $5 for sure) which was way less than I spent of AA batteries the year before and way less hassle. Hope this helps! Steve (Hawker)

565477,PRD1,2007-05-21 07:54:00,458,"I have an H2OC and with standard Alkaline AAs it will run about 6 to 8 hours. I picked up some Lithium batteries after reading an article in Consumer Reports about their life in electronic devices like GPS and Cameras being very good. They say 7X the life of standard Alkalines. Well on a trip to AZ walking around the Grand Canyon the Lithium lasted all day and were probably only 10% down. So I am a believer. They cost about 2X to 3X the alkaline (four for about $9 at Fleet Farm) but are a bargain given their life. Also in the H20 manual they say the unit will likely even float if you are using Lithium batteries because they are also lighter. No guarantees on this floating however, haven't tried it. Paul"
