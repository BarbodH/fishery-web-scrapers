565504,ii4me,2007-05-22 09:27:00,20,Anyone have a report from the opener on Lac Seul. We are going to Lost Island in 10 days and just wondering how things went.
565509,Guest,2007-05-22 14:04:00,0,"Got to be careful with the low water. Lots of things sticking out of the water that I had never seen before. Caught most of our Walleye in 6/8"" water and the bite was good to very good. Minnows on 1/4 oz jigs worked the best. Caught some on crawlers and jig/ twister was slow. The second day we caught a ton of fish on a windy sand bar right before a little cloud burst. After it stopped raining and the wind layed down we moved out to about a 13"" drop and they picked up again. You will do well. Fish slow and hard."
