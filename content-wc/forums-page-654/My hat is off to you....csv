I witnessed it first hand when I guided on Lac Seul; people would drive up from the Southern US, just to sit on a lake for a few days - happy just to be away from it all. Thank-you, it helps to keep it all in perspective. Cheers, J."

Of course the fishing is outstanding, but the hospitality is great. I really would be entirely disappointed with a less than par fishing trip.....well that may be a stretch. Can't wait for Canada"

My time there is without a doubt the most relaxing and fun filled weeks of each year. I have great friends that are with me and of course some of my family members are there every year which really makes it special. The great fishing is just a bonus...it's the relationships and the solitude of Canadas beauty that make Canada my #1 vacation spot. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
