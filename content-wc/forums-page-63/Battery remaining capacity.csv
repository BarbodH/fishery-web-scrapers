My trolling motor does not have a display on remaining capacity. What kind of ""simple/cheap"" tester can I get to show me the battery's remaining capacity? Thanks"

Still, use them carefully, and they will suffice.If you do put in a more permanent solution, such as a gauge, keep in mind that the digital ones use a tiny amount of power. You might consider putting a disconnect switch in line with the gauge to ensure that you isolate that tiny load from your battery."
