6594540,pattmit,2021-09-03 08:04:00,36,I understand that with the app you can’t do it ahead of time. That’s why I was asking about anyone having success entering 3 people in one app for the entire vehicle. Just hope it’s as easy to enter multiple people as everyone says it is for a single individual
6594546,treegrower,2021-09-03 08:53:00,5,Crossed at pigeon River Sept 20. Since my son was not old enough for vaccine he required a day 1 test. We did it at the hotel in TBay over my iPhone and dropped it off at a puralator drop box the next morning before driving on. We were “in line” for the test with the telenurse about 1/2 hour or so. Was easy. Did not get the results for a week. We were on our way home when I was able to get them. They also require a day 8 test for kids under 12 if you’re there that long.
6594552,1shooter,2021-09-03 09:28:00,1493,Just follow the instruction and answer the questions. Super easy. We crossed last Saturday with no issues. No line at all and probably less than 5 minutes with the border agent.
6594574,Stauff,2021-09-03 10:27:00,110,"Friday, Labor Day weekend, at the Saulte at 11:35 am. Sixteen cars, five semis ahead of us in line. Two lanes open. Forty minute wait to get through. Three of us filled out one ArriveCAN app at 9:00 am that morning. Handed over passports at the booth, answered the usual questions and on our way four minutes later. Doc, don't sweat it. Let your son fill out the app and enjoy the ride."
6594718,SweetD,2021-09-04 05:31:00,243,Be sure if you have only 1 vaccination card with both vaccine dates on it that you follow the instructions and take the picture of the 1 vaccine card twice in the Arrive Canada App. If you have separate cards for vaccine 1 and vaccine 2 then 1 picture of each. My partner and I had 1 card and my partner failed to get second picture taken in App and when at border Agent said doesn’t look like your fully vaccinated. Having the hard copy of card saved his ***. Hard copies of Everything is my recommendation. Border agent was very cool and just said be more careful filling out in future if this thing Covid thing continues. We were 1 deep when we came across at Fort Frances last night at 8pm. Took maybe 5 min.Flying in t-minus 4 hours!!!!!!
6594820,pnnylfr,2021-09-04 15:41:00,114,"We found the app easy to use. Take your time, nobody is rushing you. One of our guys did his own and the remaining 3 did it all on one phone. All androids."
6595246,BuckeyeATC,2021-09-07 08:38:00,88,You can fill the ArriveCan App out well in advance and before the 72 hour window starts. Just DO NOT hit submit at the end and you can go back in and edit your arrival date anytime. since it only allows you to pick a date and time 72 hours out.
6595262,10point,2021-09-07 09:54:00,102,My wife and I crossed the border at Port Huron on Friday night. This was not for fishing but to see her family as she is Canadian. It took us an hour to get through. She lost her vaccine card so we I uploaded proof of vaccine that she had obtained. Before we arrived the app said see border agent under her vaccine status. At the border the agent looked at the papers and sent us on our way. I have been getting messages asking about her quarantine and to update it daily. She actually does not need to quarantine since she is vaccinated. I did some reading and found you may get messages even if you fully exempt and to just ignore them so that is what I am doing now.
6595462,1shooter,2021-09-08 07:23:00,1493,You can enter additional travels with the app. Very simply to do
6594418,OldFootdoc,2021-09-02 18:46:00,393,"Good evening friends... Well, looks like next Wednesday, we will make the trek north through Michigan and into Ontario. I have acquired the ArriveCan App on my phone and am curious if you found it user simple. Was it difficult to up load your vaccination validation? I have a hard copy in my wallet of my vaccination record of both doses. Do I just take a photo of this or show the document to the border folks? How about the 72 hour covid test results? Easy to add to the ArriveCan App? I appreciate the info and will probably work on this over the weekend."
6594432,dakota eye,2021-09-02 19:45:00,69,It's a walk in the park. Just got to Ontario 2 days ago. The app is easy to navigate. We uploaded our passports and our Covid vaccination protocols. 2 pics per person of the vaccination records. They asked for our recent Covid test results. Interestingly they my wife and I to get tested there at the border again.
6594448,OldFootdoc,2021-09-02 20:21:00,393,"Thanks for the response... I am not computer savvy and am wondering if you can give me some tips as to how I upload my passport and my covid vaccination card to the ArriveCan App. I have a standard passport ""book"" and a card in my wallet verifying vaccination but am not certain how I ""upload"" this information to the app. Thanks for your information..."
6594450,pattmit,2021-09-02 21:08:00,36,"In addition to this, I’m headed up with a group of 9 in 3 different vehicles. We have a few members in our group that are in their 70s and smart phones as well as navigating apps might not be super easy. Anyone have any success of uploading 3 people to a single app? It seems hard to forecast uploading all the info 3 weeks in advance and knowing what to expect. So anyone that can share their experiences would be amazing."
6594452,stjoeguy,2021-09-02 21:10:00,979,"To enter the passport info you'll have a choice of scanning the page with your picture on it or entering the data manually. To scan you'll be instructed to go to your camera and align the photo and info at the bottom of the page with an image. Sometimes you get it right away, sometimes not. If you use the camera option the app fills in all the passport info. Be sure to check it carefully. I've seen several instances where it misreads letters; E becomes F, N becomes H, etc. Might be easier to enter manually. For the vaccination card part I took two photos of the card and uploaded the images when instructed. We completed the app for 5 guys at my house yesterday. The two iphones worked fine. The 3 android phones all hallted at the same place and wouldn't scroll far enough to enter the page. We wound up entering the info on a computer."
6594456,stjoeguy,2021-09-02 21:26:00,979,"I believe the arrivecan app can only be completed up to 72 hours prior to crossing the border, so if I'm reading your post correctly, it wouldn't be possible to complete it 3 weeks in advance."
6594492,Bigtaproot,2021-09-03 04:51:00,900,Easier on apple than android. We all got hit with random test upon entry in pigeon falls yesterday. Wait time for on line test was only about 30 minutes. Border time wait was zero. Guard was professional but not friendly
6594498,eyecatcher1,2021-09-03 05:43:00,323,I am 70 and have an android phone and it was a breeze to enter the info for my wife and myself. No problems at the border in I Falls either.
6594522,dakota eye,2021-09-03 06:43:00,69,I agree with Stjoeguy. The app walks you through it. It took my wife and I about 20 minutes to complete. The border guard still asked to see our passports and vaccination cards after looking at the app receipt and pulling up the info on his computer. The process was very efficient overall considering the complexity of the current environment. As a practicing physician I was impressed.
6594526,lawson2343,2021-09-03 07:00:00,459,I heard from my lodge owner that guests that crossed at Pigeon River and got tested had to deliver their results to Thunder Bay. Any truth to this and thanks in advance?
