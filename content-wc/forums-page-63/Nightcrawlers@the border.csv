6596116,1shooter,2021-09-10 10:34:00,1493,We have brought crawlers for over 25 years. I have no issue with them not allowing them...their country their rules. I didn't realize the marina we launch at sold them so we just bought them there. To be honest I would rather buy them in Canada versus traveling with them. The issue I do have is the marina has lots of fishing tackle and ended up spending over $100 on new lures.
6596118,prov1800,2021-09-10 10:42:00,5010,Actually.Tackle stores always have something you need
6596136,NM_Trout,2021-09-10 12:27:00,1094,Plus the Canada crawlers are just better. The American ones have a bit of an accent and it spooks the fish.
6596142,prov1800,2021-09-10 12:40:00,5010,Good one.Agree lol
6596164,combine_billy,2021-09-10 14:32:00,151,Most of the crawlers sold around here come from Canada. I think that accent is french.
6596242,Wallychowder,2021-09-11 06:05:00,1567,"Yeah, ain't that something ! They come from canada to the US , but they won't let them back in ! &#x1f923;"
6595896,tandm,2021-09-09 16:18:00,679,"What is the latest word on taking nightcrawlers into Canada nightcrawlers? I read an article that said as of August 14, 2021 they could be taken in, packed in artificial bedding. My outfitter says no. Who's right?"
6595898,NM_Trout,2021-09-09 16:20:00,1094,Ouch... why risk it? How much more expensive is it to purchase over the border?
6595906,Mark R,2021-09-09 16:31:00,1538,Call the Canada Border Service where u intend to cross they will let you know
6595912,Ozark Bob,2021-09-09 16:38:00,5240,"I did a search. OMG!! I would stay home. This is an outfitters response to things you have to do to go fishing in Canada. No live Bait!https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...GG2YW2F6VX90Iwhttps://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...arrivecan.htmlBAIT: Canada no longer allows ANY LIVE OR DEAD bait to be brought into the country. We will do our best to have bait. This late in the season is not usually a leach bite and we know leaches may be hard to come by. We will have minnows and worms. These fish should be so hungry they will bite a bare hook!This is the search I did. The first item is what I used. Good lucklive bait into canada as of August 14, 2021"
6595990,Baseline,2021-09-09 20:35:00,3207,"I went to Canada a couple weeks ago. No crawlers allowed. We crossed at Fort Francis and stopped a Rainy Lake Bait. Crawlers were 2 doz of $8.99ca. Not much of a difference vs US prices. With exception of having to take time out to get the Covid test the process to cross the border was easy. I presented my vax card, passport and copy of my negative covid test and was passed right through after the regular border crossing questions. Although I downloaded and filled out the Arrive Canada information the Border guy didn't need to see it. It is required so I would recommend completing it."
6596014,Wallychowder,2021-09-10 04:21:00,1567,They claim the agent's dont have time to mess around asking about bait ? You notice they do indeed ask about alcohol though &#x1f923;
6596018,Andre (wallyandre),2021-09-10 05:42:00,2274,I'm in Quebec and fish Lake Champlain on the US side for over 20 years and it's been the same: no live bait and I don't suffer from that rule.
6596038,eyecatcher1,2021-09-10 06:29:00,323,August 16 in International Falls I was asked if I had live bait or any bait that used to be alive.
6596040,Obabikon,2021-09-10 06:37:00,2370,"$60 for a half flat of worms in Canadaâ¦ Just get them when you cross. I would agree that they have time to ask about alcohol. However, I have had three different groups told me they were over the limit and we're not asked to come in and pay. So that is certainly lighter also"
6596064,pnnylfr,2021-09-10 08:02:00,114,Returned from Canada on August 30. While waiting in line to re-enter U.S. we watched a guy walking back from Canada Side to U.S. side to dump his night crawlers.
