I also want to say a big thank you to all that posted about border crossing, what to expect, etc. It helped tremendously for my group to be prepared and feel confident in the process as we were the second week of crossers. When: 08/14  08/18 Where: Branch's Seine River Lodge  near Atikokan, easy 1.5 hour drive from International Falls Who: My dad, uncle and cousin Weather: HOT (near 90 every day) & sunny, windy by mid-morning through the afternoons. Why we do drive-to: Due to work and family obligations, 4 days is about all I can get away with. I've done fly-in in the past and I would say the fishing was probably faster on those smaller lakes, but the lakes on the Seine River Chain offer nearly as good of fishing (just steeper learning curve) but I do not spend as much time in transit. While maybe not as remote as a fly-in lake, we still feel off-grid and saw maybe 3-4 other boats the entire trip, rarely if ever would a boat be within in eye sight while fishing a spot. We had wifi when in camp which was nice for me to check in with family at home and could have been reached in an emergency. The border crossing couldn't have been easier (5 minutes, super friendly agent) my flight in, not so much. I flew into International Falls was meeting the party in International Falls who drove up from MN. My initial flight was delayed, which caused me to miss my connection. Cost us a half day of fishing and a lot of frustration, but forgot about the whole ordeal once the first fish hit that evening. Our group of 4 had a great time fishing the Seine River Chain of Lakes and staying at Branch's Seine River Lodge. The lodge is located on a chain of 5 what I consider to be large lakes with all having deep water (70+ feet with one lake having a depth of 200+). They have easy access to some additional smaller lakes with boat caches, something I have done in the past with great success, but making the trek into the lakes is a little more than my dad wants to bite off these days. The owners are fantastic people and work to ensure you have a good time. Met us as we pulled into camp, got us in our cabin and fishing licenses in hand in less than 30 minutes. We were fishing 45 minutes after arrival! Cabins are clean and very well appointed. Everything you need. They also offer American plan, but we enjoy the cooking ourselves. The lake has good numbers of eater sized walleyes and unbelievable action for smallmouth bass. We could catch all the hammer-handle pike we wanted, but never got anything of size (more on that below). My dad and I like to troll artificial lures, trying new lures/techniques. We got into quite a few walleye with this technique. We love eating walleyes so our goal every morning was to get our limit and then see where the day took us. Limits came easy  first hour of every morning. Healthy 15- 18 walleyes were plentiful. We would run into one off smallmouth and pike with this technique as well. It should be noted that the camp owner gave us tips on jigging with live bait in deeper water (20'+), and others in camp had success with 40+ walleye/smallmouth days,but we stuck with what we knew. Next year we will get out of our comfort zone. The wind picked up substantially each afternoon, which made things more difficult but not enough to get us off the water. Our last evening the water laid down to glass, which is when the magic happened. My cousin and I went out and caught 15+ smallmouth on top water in about an hour and had anpther 20 strikes that we did not land. If you have not fished smallmouth on topwater, I'm not sure you have really lived! You couldn't punch the smiles off our faces. The next morning (our last) my dad I hit the water at 5:30 am, again glass. We absolutely slayed the smallmouth on topwater baits. One after another casting towards the shoreline. All were good sized bass, I'd say we caught 10 that were 17"" - 18 I'll put up an 18 smallmouth against a 30 pike any day as far as fun goes. A few in camp that caught multiple bass over 21 (with pictures to prove). Why no pike of size: it was hot and we talked to the camp owner  the pike and larger walleyes remain suspended in the dep basins at about 20-30' over 80+ feet of water. Next year I'm getting a line counter reel and heavier trolling rod and going to see what we can do long lining crankbaits. I'm sure I will have questions to ask of you all over the next year. Wish we could have fished a couple more days to learn even more, but there is always next year. If anyone has questions about the lakes or the lodge I would be happy to answer. If you want to try smallmouth bass action, I can't imagine there are any places better."
