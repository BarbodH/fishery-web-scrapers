6595712,David Anderson,2021-09-08 21:55:00,2073,"Just got home from Lac Seul Outpost today. First after a 2 years it was good to see Ken and Brenda again. I was taken back by the actual few people in camp. There were many cancellations by groups who had people in their group who refused to come for many reasons. It was also nice to see some new faces in camp and they were definitely coming back. They had a very reasonable policy based on Canadian Covid rules which I thought it was well thought out and made sense. Our bad crossing was a result of unlucky timing. Our agent wasn't in the best of spirits however he is just doing his job. Apparently last Saturday, they gave out random covid tests between the hours of 11:00AM and Noon, until they ran out. Our arrival at 11:45 put us in the crosshairs, things went good until they handed 6 out of 10 (In 3 trucks) blue boxes with instructions, pull off to the side, using your internet on the phone log into SwitchHealth.com and set up an account where you add your kit serial number. Once that is done, you need to download a video app which allows you to talk to a nurse who will visually witness you shoving the swab up your nose as well look up your account to mark it completed. Then drop it off at a designated site (the U Haul rental place) and you are done. An hour later and only half got registered. One finally got a hold of a nurse who was nice enough to walk all six of us the process however we had to call back to get everything confirmed. Then when we called back we got others who had no clue about anything. We finally got the nurse we had who did clear us all. By then we lost the drop box for Ft. Francis. Call SwitchHealth and got someone who would look it up, said there was no such drop box in Ft. Francis. I got a little upset stating we were given the test kits in Ft. Francis and had specific instruction to drop them off before we left town. Finally I said give me another person who verified the U haul location, a small basically unmarked and rusty box about 2 foot x 2 foot. Amazing as we were instructed to use the alcohol wipes to wipe down the envelop. It was a cluster for sure. We finally got back on the road in 3 hours. Why they didn't have a tent set up, these test could have been done in 20 minutes. Fishing was fair for the first 2 days then really turned on Tuesday afternoon. We were fishing Pecker point and my motorguide had all it could do to stay on the anchor spot as it was incredibly windy. The lake is down quite a bit from normal, but made it through the rags. Still great to be back."
