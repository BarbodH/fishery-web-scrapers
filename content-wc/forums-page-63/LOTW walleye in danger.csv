6595386,@Lunker,2021-09-07 19:27:00,835,Was there ever a link to the actual study or a formally published article provided at one point or was this thread the only discussion about the topic? Thought I remembered something more but I could be wrong. Thanks. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...+reduced+limit

It sounds like they are going to do away with the one over 18"" rule... and do only unders. They will also most likely be dropping 18.1"" down to 17"". Still 2 per day 4 total possession. For the most part, the tourism places are pro taking these actions if it means better fishing in the future."
