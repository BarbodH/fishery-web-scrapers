But the most recent blog post from Tall Pines says that two of the Wabaskang basins turned over last week (before 9/3/21): https://www.tallpinescamp.com/post/everything-s-bigger""North Bay"" is also marked as McLeod on some maps and is the roundish basin right between Aerobus Lake, Wine Lake, and the main basin of Wabaskang. Its over 70' deep at the deepest and is mostly 30' +.""Second Lake"" is the larger basin with the many islands and the series points on the northeast shore. It tops out around 60 feet. This is the basin that Tom William's Sleep Dog Cabins looks out onto.I'll be on Wine Lake if a few days, and I'm curious what to expect. Most of the connecting water bodies (smaller lakes) are not accessible now due to lower water levels. I'm a bit worried that Wine Lake will turnover at the start of our trip, and we'll have limited options to avoid the slump."

Water temps are at 65f on both ends of the lake.Fish yesterday in that end were both shallow and some deeper.Just fish it as usuall and rely on your electronics to show you some fish.All you can do.Tgey still have to eat and tgey do.
6595290,jsmyers,2021-09-07 12:16:00,198,Thanks! My takeaway from your statement is that the timing is less to do with surface temps than wind direction and intensity...and that a basin can turn over at a ~60-65 degree surface temp.I wonder if that matches other's experiences.
6595294,prov1800,2021-09-07 12:34:00,5010,Anything is possible.Really don't think it tuŕned over on Cedar at 65f.surface temp needs to be colder.Colder it gets heavier it gets and starts to sink but east end is really getting a lot of debris in it so bottom letting loose.fishing was still good at 24 ft and some fish shallower also.Good to be on the lake often and see whats happening daily.Of course further north you go it changes faster.Last year clarks took my wife and i to gull lake in mid Sept and walleyes and northern were in 5 ft or less.Could catch all you wanted from the dock.
6595752,Bill Krejca,2021-09-09 06:00:00,6107,"Re: Turnover - Although folks who specialize in nature's feats of this sort say that the water surface needs to be about 50 degrees for turnover to occur, I, too, have experienced the presence of water crud when the temp was degrees warmer than 50. Factors such as wind seem to compound timing of the switch. For those interested, here's a short informational on the subject.https://www.outdoornews.com/2015/10/...fall-turnover/ Bill"
