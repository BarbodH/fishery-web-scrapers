6594364,tooski,2021-09-02 11:50:00,393,Thanks for the report Larry...Wife and I were up around the same time frame.. Crossed at the Sault and for the first time in 50 years of crossing there was not a single car in line at the border ( Tues Aug 17th at 5:30)..took less than 2 minutes. It was a five day trip and our scheduled lake ( Bow) was so low we couldn't fish there so Dwight flew us in to Wettlaufer which I believe you have also fished. Very low and very hot. Plus we had two days of extreme weather where we just stayed in the cabin. All in all a poor fishing trip but after 2 years we still loved every minute of it.. Joe T
6594368,Larry S,2021-09-02 12:14:00,665,"Thanks Joe, As posted enjoyed our trip, sorry the trip to Wettlaufer wasn't so Good. Bob's trip was a lot worse Call me some time to talk Larry"
6594616,gordy28,2021-09-03 12:32:00,437,Sounds like a solid trip Larry - thansk for sharing Loving the appearance of trip reports again! Andrew
6594666,Eckohlt,2021-09-03 17:19:00,3685,It's a solid hook set when you rip it hard on timber I know that.it's a under water jungle on the ogoki.
6595340,DavKin,2021-09-07 15:36:00,104,"Our group of 5 fished Ogoki shortly after Larry, Aug. 28-Sept. 4. Largest walleye was 26 inches caught near Falls; 38"" pike in the same spot. We too lost many jigs to timber at the falls. The best spot was Honey Hole, great numbers but nothing over 23"". Minnows worked best followed by leeches in 14-35 FOW. For the week we caught approx. 1300. John is great camp manager and MLO is very organized. Boats and 15 hp Yammies ran great. We would go back if we could not return to our home court, Chimo's Hornby outpost."
6595466,Larry S,2021-09-08 07:39:00,665,"Hey DavKin looks like you had better fishing than us. Our weather was Brutal. Temps in upper 90's with either no wing or lots of wind. I'm from Henderson Nevada Suburb of Las Vegas and the Heat was Way Bad. We had to really work for all the fish we caught. Except for a couple of times the fish were no schooled up Got quite a number of fish in 20 to 30 ft of water The fish were very finicky, you had to keep bait(We used some minnows, Leeches and Tails) right on the bottom with no movement. They would suck it in, sometimes you would not even know you had a fish Glad you had a good time. Just like you we are hopefully going back to our Home Court at North Caribou Lake next Year with our 4 other fishing mates. Larry S"
