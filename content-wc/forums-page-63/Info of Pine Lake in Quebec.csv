But since they have passed away I can not find any info on this lake or cabin they used to go to. I believe it was called the pine lake club? and its located off of the clova road. One of their friends used to lease a cabin on an island on pine lake. If anyone can let me know if this place is still in operation I would appreciate it.I would like to take a trip there to fish sometime. I have attached some pics to show you the cabin. Hopefully someone has seen it or knows where it is.Thanks,Russ"

The place is still active with cabins and a diner. Ther used to be a guy from my neck of the woods (Western NY) who ran the place and it seemed to cater to Americans.

1436073,rsiminski,2012-05-16 06:11:00,53,I checked the picture out on the website and compared them to mine. The main lodge is an exact match for the one I have in my picture and the cabin on the island looks like it could also be the same. Thanks for your help in finding this place. Have you ever fished on the lake? If so how is it?

The guy who used to own Mack's Boat Livery on Silver Lake once told me that he something to do with the club at Pine Lake but it's been so long now that the exact nature of the relationship escapes me. I'm sure that with a little detective work and by contacting them, you could locate references. If the pictures on the website mean anything, I'd say that the pike are average and the walleye are plentiful."
6595768,Emack,2021-09-09 07:02:00,1,I am now looking for this place. I use to go with my grandfather and also from upstate NY. I would love to go back. Any info would be great. Looked at pictures above and this is definitely The place
