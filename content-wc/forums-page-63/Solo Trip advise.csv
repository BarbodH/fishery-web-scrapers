6596102,jaleonard,2021-09-10 09:54:00,29,"I have done the solo trip twice in my early 50s; Sunday to Sunday. I thoroughly enjoyed both and I hope you to do. I think the previous posts have covered most things. The one item I would mention is to have bear spray with you if you are able to portage other lakes and/or have an outhouse away from the cabin, which I had for both trips. And yes, I had bear on the second solo trip. In fact, on one portage, I went to the 4th lake of the sequence of portages. My time was limited because of the many times I had to portage to get to the next lake. The fishing was exceptional and the experience of doing this all alone was exhilarating. However, in hindsight, very stupid. The outfitter had boat/motors, not gas for each portage. The previous customers, may or may not have brought fuel, so I had to carry it with me - not easy. I forget which sequence of portages on the way to the final destination lake, one of the outboards had trouble and then stopped mid lake (these lakes are not huge, but as one poster said, a paddle doesn't do much good. I was able to get the boat to a shoal, reverse the boat around to work on the motor. The problem was fishing line was all around the prop. Fortunately, I had brought along a small tool box with a few standard items and after losing more time than I wanted I finally got it cleared up and was able to run to the next portage - I should have stopped there although the rest of the portages went well. So to add to your list, carry a small tool kit with you in the boat at all times. Also, I did not have a Sat phone or one of those other location gizmos. I don't recall if they were available back then. Also, leave a light on at the cabin - think lighthouse, if you are evening fishing. At 74, I'm still thinking of doing solo again, but without portages. I love the serenity and peacefulness of the Canadian Wilderness. I was north of Woodland Caribou Provincial Park. Good luck and have a safe adventure."

6596138,danvan18$,2021-09-10 12:32:00,67,"I was able to ""phone a friend"" and will have a fishing partner now. Thanks for all the tips- we did purchase the inflatable vests. Our Covid tests are Sunday, one at a clinic and one at Walgreens. Crossing on Tuesday. Hoping for quick response!"
6596140,prov1800,2021-09-10 12:39:00,5010,Great move
6596234,last chance,2021-09-11 03:09:00,3262,you'll never regret buying those vests. once you get used to putting one on you forget about wearing them.
6596250,moondog71,2021-09-11 07:14:00,22,"I did the same thing and was very nervous about a weekend test, but Walgreens had results to me in a couple hours and it went smoothly. Make sure you take the PCR test (Canada does not accept rapid antigen tests) and print the results to give to the border agent. It also helps to print the receipt from the Arrive Can app and present that to the border agent as well. Let me know if you have any questions and good luck!"
6596252,danvan18$,2021-09-11 07:34:00,67,Ok that's good to know- thanks. I'm getting the NAAT/ID Now test and hopefully they will results back to me on Sunday and start completing the app. Yes we plan to have hard copy documentation of everything as well. I have never fished this late before but I'm sure it will all be worth it.
6596302,NM_Trout,2021-09-11 11:18:00,1094,I agree. I'm very comfortable in the water. Volunteered to do a bunch of certification training for the Red Cross. I always wear one when in a boat. But make sure to get the self inflating type. Get whacked on the head on the way into the water and you'll need it. Edited to include this. I found that you can fly (at the airlines discretion) CO2 cartridges up to 28g.https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/more_info/?hazmat=9
6596408,moondog71,2021-09-12 07:34:00,22,"My local Walgreens turned the results around in about 3 hours, then texted a link to see the results. I couldnâ€™t get that link to work on my phone or tablet and had to use a Windows laptop instead to view and print it. Aside from that glitch I was extremely pleased with Walgreens."
6595358,Wallychowder,2021-09-07 16:58:00,1567,Better take a 460 Weatherby with him !

6595366,prov1800,2021-09-07 18:14:00,5010,They will try and accomadate everyone.Bringing one guy up be easy with there check flights.Fishing will be awesome there as any northern lake woukd be right blowfish will be shallow and start jumping around 4-5 pm.Lucky dude.I think any northern lake will have all kinds of nuggets sticking out that you would never see in higher water so at least you won't hit those.lol.
6595368,prov1800,2021-09-07 18:23:00,5010,Better off with a shotgun and goose load.They come at night.
6595474,last chance,2021-09-08 08:04:00,3262,this is the advice I was going to give. you might want to pick up one of those automatically inflate life jackets. you never know you have one on. a few yrs ago before I got so bad I went fishing alone on the Intracoastal in fl. i was anchoring next to a bridge piling and the boat swung in and I pushed off on the piling. when I did the boat swung out faster than I expected leaving my hands against the piling and my feet in the boat. then I fell into the strong current and was washed away before I got my bearing. but I was maybe about 10' by the time I started swimming back to the boat. as hard as I could swim I slowly gained ground. then at last I was on the back of the boat. but I was exhausted and couldn't climb in. after about 20 to 30 minutes of rest and I was able to enter the boat. lesson learned I never go fishing alone without my Cabelas inflatable life jacket. it can happen to anyone at any time. if I had of had a life jacket I could have just floated to shore.
6595510,10lbeye,2021-09-08 09:07:00,61,"Take a pair of side cutters with you to cut any hooks that become lodged anywhere on your body. And an emergency hook remover in case you can't cut the barb. Just got back from a fly in where I buried a crawler harness hook (and barb) deep in my finger. Luckily I had a hook remover in my first aid kit. My boat partner had to yank it out with the remover. Pro tip: like removing a band aid, there's only one way to use one of those removers: yank like ****. 1st attempt he didn't as he was afraid to hurt me, and it hurt like ****. 2nd attempt he reared back and yanked like no tomorrow. Didn't feel a thing, and we laughed like **** afterwards."
6595548,Eckohlt,2021-09-08 11:40:00,3685,Can you imagine how the fish feels when you cross his eye balls!
6595648,NM_Trout,2021-09-08 17:30:00,1094,"Some really good advise above. I want to chime in and echo some of this.1) Ditto on the InReach or SPOT. When I solo, I go with both a SPOT and sometimes a sat phone (you can rent them). My experience with Iridium hand held sat phones in NW Ontario is that they are somewhat spotty. We would have to wait for satellite lock, make the call, and if we got 2 min of talk time without signal loss we were doing well. The good thing about the SPOT is that it just needs to send a ""come and get me"" chirp and everybody has your lon/lat with just the push of a button. If you are hurt, you aren't going to want to be dialing. One other thing... all satellite transponders can be sketchy if you don't have open sky. Check in with someone once a day with your sat communicator. 2) Yes on bringing a spare motor if you have access to one. I don't have that luxury, but even when I go with other folks, we stash a spare boat about half way to the other side of the lake. This way we are usually never more than a 1/4 or so distance of a lake away from a motor, and we can pick the most wind-friendly way to go. 3) Life jacket on at all times in the boat. Even on the dock. Slip and whack your head while over the water and you could be done. 4) Keep an emergency bag with you that you could overnight with if needed. Rain gear, sunscreen, bug spray / head net, lightweight tarp, fire starting stuff. Little bit of food, and a water purifier like a Sawyer mini. Signal mirror and whistle too, spare knife, plus good first aid kit (bring material for a tourniquet). 5) Be OCD about standard safety stuff that you already do. Eye protection when fishing, extra care with fire, don't leave the stove on while you run to the outhouse, go easy with the log splitting. Easy on the booze. Don't get caught out in a storm and pay close attention to lightning. Don't run with scissors in your mouth over ice, etc. :-) I'm normally much less of a risk taker when I'm fishing solo. I took a trip into the Weminuche Wilderness solo most recently, and it was awesome. However, I note that I am usually done after 4 days when solo. Even I can't put up with my crap for much longer than that."
6595940,moondog71,2021-09-09 18:17:00,22,"Just finished a solo trip near Wawa last week. To echo other posters: safety is THE priority. You have nobody to depend upon but you. The Garmin Earthmate app and satellite phone does help with peace of mind. Take a bright headlamp, plenty of food, and water treatment options. I filtered through coffee filters, then boiled, treated with pills, and finally UV light.Also, nights can be lonely so download some movies/shows to your phone or tablet. I took a Jackery power station and solar panel to charge my phone and fish finder, plus run my C-Pap at night."
6595978,CiscoKid,2021-09-09 19:44:00,28,"I've wanted to do a solo trip for some time, would have never thought of half this stuff, but now makes so much sense. Thanks all for the posts. I fished snelgrove twice about 25 years ago when it was with previous owners. The portage lakes were awesome as I recall."
6595140,truth8080,2021-09-06 18:03:00,4,I have been on a few dozen fly-in trips over the last 25 years. I leave for my first solo trip in a few days. Any one else gone color for a week? Any advise?
6595148,Eckohlt,2021-09-06 18:38:00,3685,Who may I ask is flying you in solo?
6595150,truth8080,2021-09-06 18:43:00,4,Clark's Outposts. Heading to Snelgrove Lake.
6595192,Eckohlt,2021-09-07 04:07:00,3685,"It's a very nice camp,but beware of the rocks in the lake it's a underwater mine field,I fished it a few years back,with low water you will see rocks sticking up everywhere.I would suggest to you as you are alone to lay an extra motor down up towards the front of the boat,lay it on some boat cushions,just to be on the safe side."
6595196,prov1800,2021-09-07 05:40:00,5010,Make sure you also wear your life jacket at all times and have a great time.
6595210,Skywagon,2021-09-07 06:18:00,1106,"The advice to carry an extra outboard is some of the best you will get. You don't want to be at the other end of the lake and have the motor quit, no matter how small the lake, a paddle is not a great option, especially at the end of a day, walking through the bush and/or possibly a bog is not a picnic. Whenever I am at the cabin alone, I am the only one on the lake, I always carry a 2.5 hp as backup, a friend that spends the summer at his cabin alone always carries an extra 2 hp, it just makes sense. As big an outfit as Clarks is, I would guess they have a small outboard kicking around somewhere, I would suggest you call them now ahead of time and ask them if they would mind sending one in with you. Besides always wearing a life jacket, the other thing to consider might be to buy\borrow an InReach communications device, or possibly to rent a sat phone and carry it with you when you are in the boat. My friend that stays alone wears an InReach around his neck all the time, I carry mine when in the boat alone. If you are not familiar, an InReach is a satellite communicator that allows you to send and receive text messages to cell phones and e-mail address's, it also has an emergency alert button that will send an SOS to the authorities. Have fun on your solo trip, be safe."
6595218,prov1800,2021-09-07 06:46:00,5010,Clarks will have one available for him.I do a lot if solo fishing and have the Garmin inreach expedition with me at all times.Great piece of mind when your out if cell range.That unit has the map on it also and blue tooths to my phone making it so easy to use.
6595326,danvan18$,2021-09-07 13:47:00,67,I am considering a solo trip in about a week. It would be for 4 days. My wife is concerned about the remoteness and very sketchy (at best) cell service. I think a Satellite phone would be a must. Extra motor in the boat is a great idea plus a boat safety kit.
6595330,troutwater,2021-09-07 14:34:00,299,"Man I'm jealous of you both, that sounds like paradise"
6595356,reddemon2,2021-09-07 16:48:00,255,There have been many reports lately of Sasquatch sightings near the Snelgrove Lake area. Good Luck
