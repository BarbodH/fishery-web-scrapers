The number and size of Walleyes we caught was staggering. Probably a combination of we having the only cabin on a huge lake as Hidden Bay's was shut down and lack of fishing pressure for almost 2 years. Largest Walleye 28.5"" and largest pike estimated at 44"" (lost at net, arghh). Walleyes caught also included 2 26"", 5 25"", and hundreds above 18"" . We also fished right in front of the cabin in 40' of water and my wife caught 34"" and 37"" pike and I caught 35.5"" all in about 1/2 hour. The bait of the century is the Rapala Jiggin Rap. We almost used these exclusively unless there were heavy snags in the area. Production was incredible. Also, the water level is very low. I managed to only find 2 new rocks including 1 in front on the dock. Great time"
