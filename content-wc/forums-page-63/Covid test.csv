6595792,IowaWalleye1978,2021-09-09 08:32:00,96,Looking for confirmation that the binaxnow covid test from Walgreens is sufficient to cross the border into Canada? Thanks
6595800,Mazaska,2021-09-09 08:55:00,18,I do not see that one on the list from Canada's Health Ministry. Walgreens in the Minneapolis area have the RealID (NAATs) test. Got the results back within the hour but getting an appointment was hard.They have;PCR-Polymerase chain reactionRT-PCR-Reverse transcription real time PCRQuantitative PCR (qPCR)Nucleic acid test (NAT) or Nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs)Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)Isothermal amplificationDroplet digital PCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)RNA (Ribonucleic acid)Ct (cycle threshold)CRISPRNext generational sequencing (LamPORE)Detection of the N geneDetection of ORf1a/bDetection of the S geneDetection of the E geneDetection of the RdRp geneGood luck!
6595808,Eagle1,2021-09-09 09:26:00,28,"I did the ID Now (NAAT) test at Walgreens. My only concern was getting an appointment, but was able to schedule one on Monday for Wednesday morning. Took the test at 9:45am, got the results emailed to me at 9:59am, though they say 24 hours. You have to make sure that your Walgreens offers this test. There are maybe 4 or 5 Walgreens in my city, but only one offers the test. They list the tests available on the website when you set up an account and try to schedule your test."
6595832,valley366,2021-09-09 10:39:00,193,I took the same test. Trick with Walgreens is they load the appointments late in the day or early evening for the day 3 days out. So you need to start checking the site 72-96 hours before your desired test date. I also found Mon/Tues appointments were more challenging to get then Wed or Thur.Good luck.
6595870,BuckeyeATC,2021-09-09 14:21:00,88,The BinaxNow test from Walgreens is a rapid antigen test and not accepted by Canada. The ID NOW test is a rapid PCR test and is accepted by Canada. I have had it done twice already this year for two different trips.
6595914,reddemon2,2021-09-09 16:46:00,255,"CVS is the way to go if your close to one, Get an appointment anytime and always a ton of openings, I have done 3 so far with results wiithin 24hrs. NAAT/PCR Test"
