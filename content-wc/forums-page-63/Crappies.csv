6596534,prov1800,2021-09-12 20:21:00,5010,Keep your fingers crossed Bill
6593122,Guest,2021-08-27 22:11:00,0,How far are the resorts from the crappie holes?
6593164,prov1800,2021-08-28 07:38:00,5010,Keystone is located down in the east end and pretty close to the crappies within 5 miles.
6593168,prov1800,2021-08-28 07:40:00,5010,"Clarks,cedar lake lodge and cedar lake camp all are the farthest with cedar point resort being in the middle."
6593170,Obabikon,2021-08-28 07:41:00,2370,Depends on the resort. We have some amazing crappie fishing right next to us this time of year. Later in the fall... 10-15 minute boat rides.
6593494,Bill Krejca,2021-08-29 18:07:00,6107,Yup! Bill
6593508,muskyman73,2021-08-29 19:38:00,401,Do tell me where to go at obabikon.......inquiring minds would love to know !
6593556,Bill Krejca,2021-08-30 05:12:00,6107,"If you stay at Obabikon Camp, they'll help you, can fish right around camp. Otherwise, if you can get into Obabikon Lake(stay on left side, slow and easy), go to extreme end of lake, fish The Elbow, you'll know when you are there. Bill"
6593726,Obabikon,2021-08-30 16:08:00,2370,"Oh he knows.... Dave, when you get back up here, I'll mark a couple of the close by trees. Need to start coming later in the year though. Mid-August through September."
6596386,Guest,2021-09-12 06:21:00,0,Anyone having any luck up around Vermilion Bay?
6596490,prov1800,2021-09-12 18:22:00,5010,Excellent
6592624,wishinfishinmn,2021-08-25 18:56:00,52,I know Cedar Lake north of Vermilion Bay produces crappies. I am wondering if there are other lakes around there that hold crappies to try this fall.
6592628,Obabikon,2021-08-25 19:14:00,2370,Morson out of Lake of the Woods... we hammer the crappies.
6592698,prov1800,2021-08-26 06:23:00,5010,Wabigoon and Dinorwic
6592756,Stevetheoitdoorsman,2021-08-26 10:55:00,5,Check out Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge. Crappies are stacked up in October!
6593054,Guest,2021-08-27 16:09:00,0,How is the public access on Cedar for going there for the day?
6593056,prov1800,2021-08-27 16:13:00,5010,Launch is doable.But real low and lots of rocks right being boat when you launch I.Then 18 mi run to where crappies are.
6593070,Eckohlt,2021-08-27 18:28:00,3685,"An 18 mile run this time of year chews up a lot of daylight,means lots of boating and less time catching."
6593074,prov1800,2021-08-27 18:35:00,5010,Depends on horse power.It will chew up more gas then daylight.Takes me half hr to get there and 20+ ltrs of gas for round trip with my 90.
6593088,Eckohlt,2021-08-27 18:57:00,3685,"Most Americans don't care about how much gas they chew up,catching fish is on there mind."
6593092,Eckohlt,2021-08-27 19:11:00,3685,John is keystone lodge close to the crappies?
