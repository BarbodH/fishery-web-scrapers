6595464,Larry S,2021-09-08 07:29:00,665,Have determined those exact 3 Camps as the destination for a 2nd trip next year for myself & Sister . After we hook up with our group on where we will go (Probably North Caribou Lake ) in late June Early July .We will decide where to go for an August 2nd Trip Larry Schroeder
6595644,Zimm21,2021-09-08 17:22:00,5,"So I have narrowed down to Uchi Lake Lodge and Hawk Lake Lodge. I understand Hawk more expensive but the lakes, amenities, food etc. have me intrigued after the last 15 months I just want a awesome memories with a great friend with amazing fishing. We don't care what we catch just want to catch fish. My buddy loves topwater fishing. Anyone been to both? Thanks"
6595658,prov1800,2021-09-08 18:00:00,5010,Every lake has nice sized fish in my book.
6595660,Eckohlt,2021-09-08 18:02:00,3685,Some lakes just cost more to fish than others.
6595662,prov1800,2021-09-08 18:08:00,5010,Yup.Did you get my text.Your good to go.
6595672,Eckohlt,2021-09-08 18:49:00,3685,"Got your text thanks,I'll see you Friday"

Worth checking out. There will be a pretty large difference in trip price and travel hours between Uchi and the Clark Lake outposts."
6595694,bthomas3333,2021-09-08 20:28:00,465,I've fished Hawk Lake 5 times. Excellent facilities and host. Good smallie fishing during the day and a chance to catch big walleyes in the am and pm. If the stars line up I'll be there for the walleye opener in May. If you have any questions feel free to send me a note.B-
6595704,prov1800,2021-09-08 21:00:00,5010,"If i had the money is go to Clarks on Cedar at northern Lights Resort.Fishing just as good as about anywhere.This I know cause I fish there a lot.Get a comfy 18 ft Crestliner Kodiak 50 hp with all the bait youll ever need..Hire me for a day to get the hang of the lake.Cedar puts out lots of big fish for every species including some huge crappies.Then go out twice through the week to there daily fly in (Zizania) $200 pp which can produce 30"" walleyes and 40+"" pike and you would have the best of 2 worlds.just saying."
6595706,Yellowfin123,2021-09-08 21:04:00,2182,"i'd like to check out hawk lake lodge sometime, done some reading and watched videos of the place, true giants in that lake, its pricey but i guess you get what ya pay for, nice camp boats etc"
6594882,Zimm21,2021-09-05 06:02:00,5,"Deciding between Uchi lake Lodge, Slate fall outpost, or Clark's Outpost? Any of these lakes easier to fish? August 2022Bigger walleye and Pike lake?Thanks for any info.Fish On"
6594886,Eckohlt,2021-09-05 06:24:00,3685,"People have said uchi has really nice size fish,I've never been there."
6594920,Net_Man,2021-09-05 08:56:00,580,I can't help you much but..... Most of my experiences have been earlier in the year with only scattered trips to Canada as late as July. The one thing that I can guarantee you of is that some lakes that are excellent in the spring can be difficult to find fish in the summer and vice versa. To give you a better chance of success I would suggest that when interpreting feedback from some one that you give greater weight to lake/fishing report from some one that has actually fished the particular lake in the approx. time frame that you are discussing.
6594952,gordy28,2021-09-05 13:59:00,437,Can't comment on any of the three other than Slate Falls We went to Root Bay in 2020 and will be going to Miniss w them in 2022 They are in my opinion a top notch outfitter with great outposts and equipment Generally I think smaller lakes are easier to fish or learn for first timers but certainly Root Bay had some spots that always produced and Ryan Will certainly show you Cheers Andrew
6595104,RichA$1970,2021-09-06 15:14:00,1159,"Haven’t been to any of the 3 but my buddy has gone to SFO and says it’s really good, expensive but good. Not sure on Uchi and I would not send Cluck’s a deposit based on their antics to how they did business in the past 2 years."
6595132,prov1800,2021-09-06 17:18:00,5010,"Who's Cluck's.You must mean ""Clarks"".Bringing old stuff up.Tell us your story.Since border opened I have talked to lots of the guests as I've been guiding there a lot and its business as normal there camp is full and planes flying guests out to outpost.Daily flyout busy.Everyone got rolled over just like every other camp and having a great time catching fish.Fished Cedar today and we all had a fantastic day.Walleyes and Crappies on fire."
6595154,RichA$1970,2021-09-06 19:15:00,1159,"Just giving my opinion to the poster based on the way things went down in the past with some customers who were hung out to dry for awhile. I also understand your position as you have a relationship with them for your services. No biggie, everyone has a right to their opinion and a choice where to go."
6595236,prov1800,2021-09-07 07:59:00,5010,I understand your opinion.Just wondering if you had dates there yourself.Lot of guys at camp now and talk to them and dont here any complaints with how things went down.Just happy fisherman glad there here.All camps went through some bad times.Lets just hope things get better we are not done with this covid deal yet
6595320,RichA$1970,2021-09-07 13:38:00,1159,No dates and just word of mouth from members on this site. The one good thing I saw last week was everyone was happy to be there along with the owners. I’d urge anyone with vacation time to call some resorts as I’m sure they’d accommodate if they are open.
6595372,prov1800,2021-09-07 18:29:00,5010,Most are open some full some not.Nice to see fisherman on the lake.It almost feels normall.
