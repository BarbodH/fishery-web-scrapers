6596274,DavKin,2021-09-11 08:36:00,104,We recently fished Ogoki Reservoir with Mattice Lake Outfitters and one of their boats had rod holders for storing rods vertically. I'm looking for a lightweight hack vertical rod holder for future fly-ins. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

This was to keep them from rolling lose in the boat. The others in my group gave this the name ""The Jim Box"" Another member took this further, creating the Patman Camp boat Organizer. He took a standard milk create basically made an open tackle box. he also attached three commercial rod holder (eight inches long) to the side of the create. Therefore creating a rod holder for a camp boat plus neat organization for the rest of his tackle. Sorry, I do not have a picture to post, I will see if Patman will post one."
6596776,phishfearme,2021-09-13 16:59:00,1242,this is what i've used - keeps the rods out of the bottom of the boat - cheap and light. make sure the inside diameter of the tube can hold the rods. phish

6596794,phishfearme,2021-09-13 18:26:00,1242,that's fine except where would you support the bottom?? the bottom would flop up if it's not supported.boat vary a good bit so a variation on this may be needed.phish
6596796,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-09-13 18:28:00,66,here is the PATMAN create/rod holder
6596798,That Minnesota guy,2021-09-13 18:29:00,8293,"I get that, it looks like a hassle to tie off to the seat. In any event, it looks like it works."
6596804,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-09-13 18:35:00,66,No hassle. Just place on the bottom of the boat when moving. It can be placed on the seat when stopped if want. no tying down needed.

It has a rod and drink holder, a space for my Hagen's worm box, and two other ample size areas for spinners, bb'ers, and terminal gear. It has allowed me to fish all day without too much bending.
