Had a nice time. On the way back, well north of the border, there was a border agent standing in the middle of the road waving me down. My kids tend to act a bit silly, so I told everybody in the car to be quiet and that I would do all the talking. I rolled down both driver side windows of my truck, and the agent walked up to a very somber group. He asked one question : ""where was everyone born?"" I pointed to myself : ""Milwaukee"" I pointed to my oldest : ""Oklahoma City"" I pointed to my youngest : ""Denver"" I pointed at my beautiful, dark haired, hispanic wife : "" "" and I immediately drew a blank on her birthplace of Little Rock AR. I looked at her, started to stammer, and I got those dark brown eyes boring into me as she looked at me, and told the guard ""The United States of America"".I had a completely red face when I turned to look at him, and he was trying to not laugh his a$$ off. My kids were giggling. My wife didn't say another word. The guard pointed down the road, and said ""Have a great day!"". And off we went. I have never lived that day down."
