Fishing had been pretty good but some weather changes shut things down for a couple days. While poking around in near-desparation for a bite we came across a little stream that entered the lake. There was a bug hatch going on in the stream (apparently the water was warmer than in the lake) that we weren't immediately aware of. We slipped up to within casting distance of the mouth and on 5 consecutive casts got five fish. We then dropped anchors and caught fish on every cast with slip floats and worms in 2-3 feet of water. Most were walleyes, biggest only 5.5 lb so (that's big for me, but not for many of you), generally 2-3 lb, along with a few bass and the ubiquitous pike. This continued until dark, and we went back the next morning and repeated the same thing until late morning. It was out last day so I don't know how long it lasted. I've read these types of anectdotes here for years, but it's the first time we've ever truly lost count of how many fish we caught, and got complacent about ""just another 3-lb walleye"", and hoping the hook would shake free at the boat so we wouldn't have to handle the fish to get it out. Not bragging, but just sharing as a way of saying thanks (sincerely)to all those who've provided advice and wisdom on this forum over the years. It finally came together for me and Dad, proving it can happen to anyone with patience, persistence, and willingness to listen and learn."
