565993,waleht,2007-06-05 18:27:00,132,"I got back from Wabby on Sat (6/2). The lake was down, but after a week of rain it has come up considerably. Fishing was fair to good since it rained almost everyday. No real large fish in our group. Biggest walleye was 21"", Pike 30"" and trout 34""(15lb). However, we ate fish everyday and brought home our limit. The last day it was sunny, calm and about 80 degerees. The pike were on fire. No large fish boated, but tons of small ones that were hugry. I suspect fishing is good this week with the weather patterns stabilizing. Scott, if you are the same one whom e-mailed me before my trip I am sorry I did not call you yet. I have to look for your number and I will give you a call. Maybe e-mail it again. Brent"

566178,Pooch,2007-06-11 20:35:00,4619,One of my buddies is at Jim and Julies as I write this. They will be back next week. Is that too late for your report needed? Pooch
566298,Guest,2007-06-14 17:22:00,0,"Just returned from a short trip. Arrived on Sat to a beautiful, sunny day. Worked every known spot for northern and got very few. Turned to walleyes and picked up many eater size fish. That was pretty much the story for the rest of the trip. Very few big northerns and tons of eater walleye. The weeds haven't come up yet explains the poor northern fishing. The lake also has raised over 2 feet in 10 days contributing to poor water quality especially on the big lake. Walleyes were caught by our group primarily up in Gawley's Bay on the north end. We fished just about anywhere up there along weed lines, points, and the sunken islands and did well. Jig/minnow was good for us, others were using slip bobbers in the weeds and catching alot of fish. Good luck...the fishing is going to get really good next few weeks!"

566337,pintaildux,2007-06-16 14:40:00,12,"I had the same experience. First part of the week (06/10) the sun was out in full force with high temperatures in the upper 80's and even low 90's one day.Few pike of any size,except for the 4 footer that cruised by the boat while we were perch fishing with bobbers.I think it liked the colors of my yellow and black float.Biggest walleye was 23 inches.We caught about 7 or 8 in the slot limit around 20 inches, so back they went.We left Friday afternoon because of high winds on the lake.No border crossing problems. Tom at Sleeping Dog Cabins was the best host I have had. Cabins were great with satellite TV to keep an eye on the numerous thunderstorms we had this week.Good luck to all going later this year.;)"
565574,Guest,2007-05-24 18:48:00,0,Just curious if there are any reports on fishing and water levels on Wabaskang and if anybody has been back to Wine Lake also. Scott
565589,sidewinder,2007-05-25 08:15:00,96,Hey Scott You going back to Wine? We went to Wabaskang last year and portaged into Wine. We are at Trout lake catching trout fast and furious Walleye slow
565599,Guest,2007-05-25 13:03:00,0,Not going back this year but going next year. Had a great walleye catch last year but the lake trout were slow. Wish I was going this year. Scott
565638,Guest,2007-05-28 13:19:00,0,Trailerguy or anybody else I was just curiuos how the fishing was on Wabaskang or Wine Lake during the Week
565654,Guest,2007-05-28 22:32:00,0,"Heres the latest I've gotten from my brother at Jim & Julies...""Hey, too bad your stuck down in Iowa smelling hsog buildings and fighting allergies...the walleyes are on a tear!"" Seriously....Jim said the fishing has been very good with walleyes being caught from all areas on the lake, gawlys bay, big lake opening, middle lake narrows by the ""river"", mccloud bay, and also keynote. Fish are being caught in 6 to 9 feet of water on jig/minnow combos. Thursday someone at the camp caught a 43.5"" northern that hit the 22 lb mark. I can't wait until next week to get up there (tired of looking at all tbe hog sites on the horizon around here)."
565694,pintaildux,2007-05-29 21:27:00,12,June 9th Cannot get here quick enough.Any report on the water level down to keynote?
565695,Guest,2007-05-29 23:07:00,0,"What I am hearing is guys are able to get down there ok. I believe there is 2 1/2 foot of water after you get through the last curve, until it really widens up and drops into deep water. Guys with bigger boats are going down there with no problems though."
565709,Guest,2007-05-30 12:43:00,0,5/31/07 I heard from Tom today and he said they got 4 inches of rain within 24 hours the other day which has now raised the lake 9 inches!
565722,Trailerguy,2007-05-30 16:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just got back from Wabby last night. The lake is very low, It rained just enough to wet the ground and then blow dry in a cold wind,repeatedly most of the weekend. Until Monday night, then it poured all night. Every little drainage ditch was rushing full with water Tuesday morning as I drove down HWY 105, but south of Hwy 17 there apeared to be no run off. I was only able to get out fishing one evening, the largest eye was a 23"" er, and I released a 38"" pike as well. They were biting nonstop in the flats up by the second narrows. Others were having mixed results, but if you found them they were turned on. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
565740,Guest,2007-05-31 11:19:00,0,"5/31/07 The walleyes are plentiful in Lake Wabaskang, ON Canada! If you are looking for a lake that you can drive to, then Lake Wabaskang is your lake. We stayed, my husband and I, at Sleepy Dog Cabin Resort and Tom the owner couldn't have been more accommodating and the cabins were beautiful. Also, I understand the area recently received a lot of rain and the lake as come up 9 inches. Ted Jack & Judy Grun, Hayward WI USA"
