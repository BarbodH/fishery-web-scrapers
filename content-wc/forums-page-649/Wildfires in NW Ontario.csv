If the following link works, it should take to the Ontario MNR page with the latest fire information. There's a link on the left for current situation. http://affm.mnr.gov.on.ca/spectrasit...m/affmhome.cfm The one below takes you directly to a maps page.http://affm.mnr.gov.on.ca/spectrasit...89EB4D71018E93"

I've included the link to the MNR Forest Fire Management site - all updated info can be found therehttp://affm.mnr.gov.on.ca/spectrasit.../affm/fire.cfm Jessica North Waters Bait & Tackle Kakabeka Falls, ON"
