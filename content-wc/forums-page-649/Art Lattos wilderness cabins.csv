Could not find any large northerns fishing for them but usually ended up getting one 10 lber + per trip fishing for Walleyes. Have a great trip."

We like Rafeal (sorry about the spelling) the best one fish right after another very close to camp. If you cast the weed beds with big plugs or Buzz Baits you will catch big northerns. The Lattos are very friendly people and will help you all they can. Let us know how you do up there, we are going up there next week. Sharon Melbo[email protected]"
