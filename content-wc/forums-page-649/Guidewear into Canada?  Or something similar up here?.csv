566215,uzzi,2007-06-12 13:47:00,349,I think it ships with the order
566221,retire55,2007-06-12 15:08:00,1029,"Uzzi: Cabela's gave me the carrying case even though I purchased the bibs and the parka on different trips to the US. And by the way, I purchased the uninsulated Guidewear because I was concerned about the insulated version being too warm during summer months. During mid Sep walleye trips, when temps can be quite cool, I just wear multiple layers of fleece under the parka. If the temp improves, off comes a layer of fleece."
566222,uzzi,2007-06-12 15:24:00,349,"Yep, thats what I ordered her too, the uninsulated parka and bibs, thought the same thing, can layer underneath as needed. Thanks!"
566230,AMPHIB206,2007-06-12 21:48:00,191,"Yes, I did, but it was not Cabela's fault. The fault lies in the hands of the person I trusted to send it to me. Perhaps you know him you loser.........When are you not coming up to Canada this year?"
566150,uzzi,2007-06-11 11:55:00,349,"Hey all. I was going to order my wife some Cabelas Guidewear. Went online to Cabelas and they've got some ""old"" stock stuff on sale in her size, and comes with a free bag, so I thought OK, what the heck, cant be a whole lot different than the ""new"" stuff anyways. So I proceed to make an order. The pants and jacket totalled 320 US, but when I went to checkout there was almost 100 extra added in ""Taxes and duty"". So I got onto the online chat with a CSR there, and they gave me the breakdown, 60 duty, 25 GST and 22 PST, something like that. Anyways, I asked why the duty, isnt this stuff made in the USA. Nope, apparently made in China, and therefore not covered under NAFTA to be duty free.....great! So was curious if any Canadians own Guidewear? Did you jut suck it up and pay the duty? Or Isuppose you made a trip to the US or have a relative down there pick it up and ship it to ya? I thought it was pricey as it is, without adding the extra for duty. Is there anything made (or at least sold) up here in Canada that would be comparable to it? Reports are its good stuff and thats what I'm after. Thanks for any help!"
566152,freespoolin,2007-06-11 12:38:00,472,"I've looked at SIR, Wholesale Sports, Mountain Co-op, Mark's Work Warehouse and never found any Goretex similar to Cabela's Guidewear at a reasonable price. I have Guidewear and it is great. Make sure that your Cabela's price includes all costs including brokerage and that UPS doesn't charge you brokerage fees on top of the duty. If Cabela's ships by UPS and UPS is going to charge additional brokerage fees, tell UPS you will self-broker, pick up the forms from UPS when the goods arrive and take the forms to Canada Customs."
566155,retire55,2007-06-11 12:50:00,1029,"I purchased my Cabela's Guidewear during 2 one week trips to the US. According to the guide for residents of Canada returning to Canada (RC4044), after each absence of 7 days or more, you can claim up to CAN$750 worth of goods without paying any duties. And after each absence of 48 hours or more you can claim up to CAN$400 worth of goods without paying any duties. A trip to anywhere in the US (to which Cabela's could deliver your purchase) may be warranted. However, in the scheme of things, what's $60? I've had my Cabela's Guidewear for 2 fishing seasons. IMHO, that purchase is the best fishing related purchase I've ever made. I'm not trying to convince you that other rainwear won't work as well - just that Cabela's Guidewear will keep you incredibly dry. And the free bag you get with it - a great value."
566160,uzzi,2007-06-11 13:41:00,349,"Yeah, thats what I'm trying to tell myself about the extra $60 duty. I guess with our strong dollar now, I'm also saving in the exchange rate. From what I've heard, you cant beat the guidewear, so I can also take consolation in knowing I'm buying the best stuff. And since a quick trip to the US is out of the question as the nearest Cabelas is likely close to a 12 hour drive, I knwo what the options are......suck it up and buy it.....or let my fishing partner contnue to get wet/cold.....think we all know where this is going! Thanks for the help, thought it was worth a shot anyways."
566164,T Mac,2007-06-11 14:03:00,10084,"uzzi... Lundwear Canada has some of about the same stuff. Go to: www.ryjus.com then click on ""retail"", then ""LUND"", then ""clothing"". They are located in Winnipeg,MB."
566166,uzzi,2007-06-11 16:02:00,349,"Thanks! I like that suit....but I showed a pic to my wife, and she said she'd look like a grat big red Lund billboard...haha!!"
566181,AMPHIB206,2007-06-11 21:09:00,191,"I live in Winnipeg and made the trek to Cabela's in Grand Forks for the Guide Wear rainsuit. Bit the bullet on the price, but anything in Winnipeg at SIR or Wholesale Sports was rubber and did not have the features that the GuideWear series has. It is an awesome suit; I got the insulated jacket and uninsulated bib. I also got the free guidewear bag they were offering. Cabela's only offers the bag in RED. I got a green suit, so I look a bit Christmas-like while walking down the dock. Well worth the price. Greg"
566183,Roddy,2007-06-11 21:59:00,488,"Uzzi, Where are you located? I live 25 minutes from a Cabela's and will be heading to Sioux Lookout next Tuesday. I will be entering at International Falls. Roddy"
566196,Guest,2007-06-12 08:40:00,0,Did you have to wait long to get the bag that your suit came with?
566198,uzzi,2007-06-12 08:59:00,349,I'm in Saskatchewan
