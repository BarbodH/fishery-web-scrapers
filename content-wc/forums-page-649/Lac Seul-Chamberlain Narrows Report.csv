566169,Guest,2007-06-11 17:48:00,0,Thanks for the report. How low was the water compared to last year? Were you able to get into Scalar? Where did you have your best fishing? Our group heads up there in about 2 weeks and typically spends a lot of time up in Wapesi Bay or Scalar Lake.
566189,Guest,2007-06-12 07:18:00,0,"We were able to get into Scaler, but it was real shallow getting back up into the falls. We did not fish Wapesi, but saw a few boats in and out of there. Good luck on your trip."
566194,IMWalleye,2007-06-12 08:23:00,35,"Just got back Saturday from Ojibway at Chamberlain - had to wait a couple of days for my typing fingers to heal. Despite the lousy weather, our group of four caught a boatload every day last week. The windier the better. Many in slot, but largest only 25"" caught in 20 ft. Best luck at islands and bays adjacent to Bear Narrows. Used minnows and leeches - both equal in productivity."
566197,Guest,2007-06-12 08:56:00,0,"IMWalleye- Glad to hear you had a good trip. We must have been there about the same time. We heard that one of the guide boats hit a rock and took out the lower unit guiding a group out during our stay. Did you hear that as well?? We fished bear narrows one day and did well. Tried 3 sisters, but didn't produce much? Never made it to ski doo point. Did you catch any big northers or any smallmouth?"
566203,IMWalleye,2007-06-12 09:31:00,35,"One 16"" smallie. Lots of Pike, but largest was 36"" - not bad on jig and 6 lb test. Took a few slots on skidoo point, but did better at the rockpile due east of there. Didn't hear about the guide boat, but not surprised as they were moving around a lot all week. I did hear that Ken lost a lower unit on one of his boats Thursday morning."
566205,Guest,2007-06-12 09:49:00,0,"Yes, the Thursday morning incident is what we heard of also. It's scary to think that Ken or one of his guys can hit rocks on that trip...shows how dangerous it can be. They make that trip so many times! Did you fish Scaler at all? We had pretty good luck there on Thursday. What cabin were you in? This was our 5th year. Really have enjoyed ourselved!"
566206,IMWalleye,2007-06-12 09:55:00,35,"Cabin VIP2, behind the old office. This was my 25th straight year. K & B were joking that I probably paid for their new ""office"" on my own. Lots of changes, but the fishing gets better every year. Didn't try Scaler - decided it wasn't worth the risk of hitting the rocks. Did you do any good up north?...we didn't go any farther than Tom's Cabin."
566208,Guest,2007-06-12 10:06:00,0,"25 years!! Very impressive. You probably have paid for a few things in that amount of time. We used to stay in non VIP cabins, but we got squeezed out of those, and have to stay in VIP's now. We did pretty good up north. Heard Pecker was good, but didn't try it. We fished up closer to Birch Narrows, and did ok."
