It may take you about 13 to 14 hours to get there if you stop a lot but well worth the extra couple hours as the fishing is soooooo great. For a resort with the newest cabins check out www.paradisecoveminaki.com They just built a new resort all cabins have 4 bedrooms 2 baths air, screened deck, cable tv. Be sure to ask for a res. at Paradise Park as they have 2 other resorts as well. Hope this helps."

562398,esgrams,2006-12-21 10:04:00,92,"My suggestion is www.reddeerlodge.com --Its just north of Nestor Falls on Lake of the Woods, Its definently within your price range and has the added benefit of being in the ""island"" portion of Sabaskong Bay so you are able to escape the wind, while still being close enough to access the more open water.. As far as being within 12 hours of Chicago, I'm not sure how far that is from International Falls, but Red Deer is only 2-2.5 hrs north of the border..Good Luck, Eric"

562402,Ia Walihntr,2006-12-21 16:24:00,320,"HeadinNorth, Looking at a Rand McNally search, Chicago is approx. 11 1/2 drive to International Falls Mn. You might consider Rainy Lake for your Canada vacation. There are several resorts on the Canada side of Rainy that would run less to considerably less than $1000 apiece. Rainy Lake has good to great walleye, northern, and slab crappie and even an occasional musky. Rainy has exceptional smallmouth fishing. Do a search for Rainy Lake in the archives and I'm sure you will agree with the fishing potential of Rainy! (to say the least that Rainy is your closest option for Canada waters.) Here are some options: Amik Lodge on Northwest Bay-- www.amiklodge.com Labelle's Birch Point Camp on Northwest Bay-- www.labellescamp.com Silver Muskie Lodge on north end of Red Gut Bay--www.silvermuskielodge.com Coppens Resort at the entrance to Red Gut Bay-- www.coppensresort.com The Fisheries Resort (entrance to Red Gut)-- www.thefisheries.com Cascades Camps Ltd. 651-439-5430 Camp Narrows Lodge www.campnarrows.ca Campfire Island Camp (catch and release only) www.campfireisland.com Hope this helps.

562373,Guest,2006-12-19 15:29:00,0,Eight of us are looking for a Resort to catch Walleye at in 2007. Would like to go in June or early July. We live in Chicago area and would like to drive no more than 12 hours one way and spend no more than $1000 per person at the Resort and fish for 5 or 6 days. We are mostly interested in catching Walleye. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I know we need to get reservations ASAP.
562374,jigman 2003,2006-12-19 15:56:00,981,"By resort do you mean a drive in resort where you have American Plan, a fly in resort with Am. Plan, a fly in outpost where you do the housekeeping, or something else? By narrowing your preferences people can help you out better. And you're right, you do need to book soon for that time frame :-)"
562375,Guest,2006-12-19 16:33:00,0,"We don't have a preference as to what immenities the Resort supplies. We can eat their cooking or ours we can fly or drive, Main Resort or Outpost. Our concerns are under $1000 for the week and good to great Walleye fishing. Would love to hear suggestions so I can get on the phone before Xmas. I would imagine that for a $1000 per man that there should be some good choices. Especially drive in, we cook. Thanks Again"
562376,Guest,2006-12-19 17:04:00,0,"i have 3 excellent choices for you..North Star Lodge on Clay Lake.. only resort on this lake.. walleye,smallmouth,and northern.good numbers and size. fished it in late may, early june,and august..fishing was very good to excellent every time we were there.25 minutes from vermilion bay to their camp. Evergreen Lodge on Lac Seul.fished it this past august and did great for walleye (found an island with a reef off of it which was marked by a bouy just outside of mac kenzie bay..you guys who fish lac seul may know where im talking about...)double and triple headers with my kids all day long. what a blast.. the northern fishing was surprisingly slow then, however.great resort and great people, if you contact pat and gary, tell them jigmeister from chicago says happy holidays. (they will remember me as i had a brief hospital stay in red lake and patty had to amuse my 11 yr old daughter for a day)the 3rd camp is White Pine Resort on LOTW just south of Sioux Narrows. fished it for the first time last june..(yes i got two trips in last year..what a wife!!) the american plan is $900.00 and the food is incredible. great cabins with satellite tv in each. 1 day with a guide in his 22 ft guide boat. my first fish with the guide was a 29-1/2 walleye which i posted a message on this board earlier this year. the next fish a 25'er was caught by my buddy hubba bubba. after that fishing was normal with 19 to 21 inch walleye being the norm.. you can catch all the eating and take home size nortern in snake bay which is where the camp is.caught some bonus slab crappie off the dock in the evening also. dont know if they will be around at the end of june though.i will post the web sites for these camps in my next message as i was not prepared to answer your post with that info.. jig out"

562380,Guest,2006-12-19 18:10:00,0,"lac seul ear falls area lodges. 1k should get you 6-7 days, boat, bait, housing, food, beer, and gas there and back. oh, lest i forget, lots of walleyes."

562383,jigman 2003,2006-12-20 09:49:00,981,"If you are trying to keep your total costs (food, gas, licenses, trip, etc.) under $1000 it will take some looking to do a fly in. I recently did a lot of looking for a new place and was able to find a number of fly ins where the trip itself (cabin, flight, boats, etc.) was $1000 or under, but when food, gas, beer, etc. get thrown in we'll be over that number substantially. You will also find that if you do a 5 or 6 day fly in, your costs will be almost what a 7 day fly in costs. The reason for that is that it costs the outfitter the same amount to fly you in and out no matter the length of stay. Fuel is their largest cost. Here's an outfitter with a good reputation and where you may be able to keep your total costs under $1000. It was the most reasonable fly in outfitter I found.www.chimolodge.com"
