This year going up with a new boat with a 150 hp opti on the back & wanted to travel & try different places for a day or two. We always go to Mckenzie Bay & Manitoba point & catch plenty of fish, but want to try new places. My question is how far from Scout Lake to central part of Lac Seul past Manitoba point, the areas around Fish Gut bay, Black Bay & Aldous Bay. Anybody ever travel that far? How long? I know I can catch fish closer, just want to travel & try new places. Any help would be appreciated, thanks! EE"

I know this because I have fished some of them; done quite well too. Take care, and good luck."

We use the camp boats so we venture as far as Stoney point in that direction, on calm days we will go further but have never really seen the need. With that set-up you should make Stoney in about 2/3 to 1/2 the time it takes me, so venture on my friend. I have always looked at those areas with a longing glance, but if I go that far and the wind kicks up I do not want to think about the ride back. Let me know how you do, someday I just might get the itch to go too."
