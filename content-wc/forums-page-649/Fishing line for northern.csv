566284,Jazzy Lu,2007-06-15 11:33:00,11,I love spider wire although it's hard to find nowadays. They still carry it at the Fishermans Outlet in Spirit Lake Iowa. 30 lb does the trick. We drive there special for it and other awesome deals. (It's the Berkley outlet)But use good quality steelon leaders. And gage the leader length by how many folks are in the boat. If casting make sure everyone reels their line almost up to the leader before casting and use shorter leaders when close in the boat. Don't want anyone hooking anyone.

566325,tjsker,2007-06-15 15:08:00,301,"Thanks everyone. I exchanged the 50 for some 30lb Power Pro and plan on using some good leaders. I think the 30lb is a better match for the rod and reel I have, plus I'll be able to put more line on the reel. Eight days left until I'm on the water. Getting butterflies in my stomach just thinking about."
566070,tjsker,2007-06-07 09:17:00,301,I was thinking of spending a day casting for northern on Lac Seul next month and need to fill my baitcaster with line. Any line/weight recommendations? Is Power Pro 50/12 about right?
566071,joeman79,2007-06-07 12:12:00,417,That is what I am trying this year and hoping its a good choice. Casts nice. First time using braided line besides my old Musky reels with the 30 Braided Line from the 80's. Good Luck Joe
566077,Guest,2007-06-07 13:54:00,0,I have been fishing Canada for 17 yrs. in the last 6 yrs I have been using 30 Lb Fireline. We do a lot of trolling and it gives a good feel for the lure and is strong enough to not loose lures when snagged.
566078,Fred_G,2007-06-07 15:03:00,908,I like 30/8 Stren Super Braid. It's not really necessary to use anything heavier. Just be sure to use a good leader.
566086,J.,2007-06-07 19:23:00,32,"I use Cortland's Musky Master; its a dacron line, and I find it very easy to fish, viz. it is easy to cast - granted, I use relatively large musky-type presentations for Northern, it is less likely to turn into a 'birds-nest' on you (happens to the best of us), and it is extremely strong. All in all, it is one fine line. And I have never found Northern to be line shy... so the added diameter has never been much of an issue for me (especially on a lake like Lac Seul). Cheers, J."
566091,Behr,2007-06-07 21:32:00,1240,"I would second the fireline, but I don't use 30#'s. I use 18#, which probably is much closer to 30# in reality and with a smaller dia (if you could call fireline as having a diameter). That stuff is strong. -Behr"
566096,Guest,2007-06-08 08:44:00,0,I have used the power pro in the 30# for the last 7 years and can say it is very good. Casts nice and strong.
566111,Guest,2007-06-09 18:48:00,0,PowerPro 30# very good
566281,bigbuck,2007-06-15 10:50:00,69,"50lb PowerPro or TuffLine or Stren SuperBraid, etc.... are a good choice. Depending on where you are fishing, they can handle a good sized Northern or Muskie for that matter. Make sure you use a good leader (either steel, titanium or at least 50lb Fluorocarbon leader material with quality swivels and snaps)"
