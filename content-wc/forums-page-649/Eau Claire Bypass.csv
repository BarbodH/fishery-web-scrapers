If I want to use the new bypass do I have to go past that exit to get onto it? If so will it still save me time? 66 hours and counting! Thanks for the help, Brett"

566207,Guest,2007-06-12 09:59:00,0,"Used it a few weeks ago....awsome...from the south on I94 use the same exit as before just follow the 53 north signs, takes you right thru with no traffic, stop lights, or even a slow down. It saves a good 20-30 minutes depending on the time of day."
566224,wiggle,2007-06-12 18:38:00,400,"As you come off of I94 and head north on Hwy 53, just get all the way into the left lane and you will be fine. There is a ""Y"" off to the right, just north of Gander Mountain, that will take you thru the old route. So keep to the left till you pass the ""Y"" and you will be good to go. Set the cruise at your speed limit and go, go, go..... Good luck fishin' Brad"
