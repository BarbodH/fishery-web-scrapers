We enjoy catching walleyes but going after big northerns is our main thing. We fly out with Gawley's Little Beaver Resort /Woman River Outposts on Lac Suel. It is common for us to catch 20+ pounders but this year Curt laid into a 34 lb northern in 26 feet of water with a jig and a salted minnow. It was about a 20 minute fun time. The weather was okay one minute and miserable the next - true arctic coldfront. It was tough fishing but saw them suspended in a deep channel , dropped down and bam! It was great. I caught a nice 22lb on a lindy rig in pretty shallow water so that was a fun time, too.Gawley's has about 8-10 lakes with cabins to fly into - we have been to most of them and have our favorites but have done well with big pike in most of them. The cabins are comfy -even hot and cold water."

Another amazing thing that happened was that on the same trip we found a scull including part of the spine of a northern that made this one look ""small"". The teeth were much much larger. HAD to be 40 plus class. We brought the skull home cuz it was so amazing. Really gives you a whole new respect for northerns when you see something that size. If I make an O with my thumb and pointer I couldn't fit it around the spine. We do love northern fishing! That is the reason we fly in for May opener and choose the lakes we do. Antenna and Bertrand Lakes are awesome for huge northern and release only so they continue to get bigger! We always catch lots of walleyes to eat and I really enjoy jigging but the big northerns can be a challenge - especially when you get them up to the boat."
