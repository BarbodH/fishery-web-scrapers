566322,Guest,2007-06-15 14:15:00,0,We usually stay in Dryden at the Best Western but I was wondering if there are any hotels in Vermillion Bay or Perrault Falls. We boat in to camp from Perrault Falls on a Saturday so we would be staying on a Friday night. Or are there any resorts that would let us stay for a evening? Scott
566324,IMWalleye,2007-06-15 14:53:00,35,I stayed in the Holiday Inn Express in Dryden two weeks ago - much better than the Best Western or the Comfort Inn. I don't recall any places in Vermilion.

566330,Guest,2007-06-15 18:03:00,0,Best Western in Dryden is nice but way over priced compared to the Holiday Inn Express... Depending on what your looking for... Dryden has LOTS of clean/basic rooms at a good rate if trying to save acouple bucks....
