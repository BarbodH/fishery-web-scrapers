566289,Guest,2007-06-14 11:31:00,0,Is it worth making the trip from Lount to SEP Rapids? I have never been there. How is the fishing? Does anybody have a general idea how to get there? Is it by SEP lodge?

566273,FishTwentyFourSeven,2007-06-15 07:48:00,38,FishTwentyFourSeven We are going to Lount and are leaving tomorrow. I think I might have seen the rapids last year. I took a trip up the a logging bridge and I believe there was a campground around the corner. We saw some rapids but were too afraid to go on the other side of them. We are goning a month earlier this year. Should we expect to find the walleye in shallower water?

566323,Eyesore,2007-06-15 14:29:00,455,"We stayed at the separation lake campground back in June of 1999. We had very good fishing. We actually got sick of catching Pike. Walleye was good fishing as well. As for the rocks - I did not hit a one. They are there, as with most any lake in Ont, but I had no trouble, and my depth finder was not even working! I can't say what the water levels were then, compared to now. I do not recall them being stupid high or stupid low though. I'd recomend this trip. At least at the campground facilities. We never made the 7 mile trip to the lodge though."
