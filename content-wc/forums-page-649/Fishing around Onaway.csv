There are plenty of good spots at that stretch of the Lake. My favorites are Ghost Narrows, South Inlet, Stoney and Manitoba points, and ALL of the islands, bays, humps and bumps in between. Have fun, be careful, watch the depth finders, and post your results when you get back. Make sure you ask Kathy if you can help feed the fish....it is awsome!"
