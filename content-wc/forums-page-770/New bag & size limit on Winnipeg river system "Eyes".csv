Last year I wrote (complained) about the new law that was being proposed for the Minaki area and surrounding areas of the Winnipeg river system above LOTW. I let it be because it was only speculation at the time even though the owner of the resort we stay at in Minaki told us that it was a sure thing since he is somehow involved with the ministries of fishing up there. Well, it is a done deal. The new limit on ""eyes"" has been reduced from 4 to 2 for a regular license. Both must be between 35 cm and 45cm. Or, 13.8"" - 17.7"". 1 of the fish can be kept if it is over 70cm or 27.6"". A 10"" slot range seems pretty big. Most of the fish we catch are in the low 20's and you could only keep one of those last year. All other species remain the same with no changes. It will seem strange to only be able to keep 2 fish. I know a lot of you say big deal and will argue that it is fine. I personally enjoy bringing back fish to enjoy throughout the year. We have several get togethers for mock shore lunchs with all the fixings. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the whole expierience of the trip and agree that it is not about the fish you take but instead the memories of the trip blah blah. I still think for the amount of money you pay for your 1 or 2 weeks of paradise, you should be able to keep 4 fish. Those that don't want to keep 4 could just simply not. Well, it does not matter now since it is a law. Those of you thinking about trying to get around it, beware, you will never see Wardens in Canada like you will this year. Don't be stupid and ruin your own trip. They will be checking boats, cars, campsites and your cabins if they (excuse the pun) smell something fishy. Remember too that if you have your 2 back at the cabin and are on shore frying up some more, you are breaking the law. I have seen Wardens count fish at a shore lunch and then escort people back to their cabins to see what is in the fridge or freezer. If you have a fish fry at the cabin, eat it all because any leftovers count too. I guess I will have to start eating that soon to be famous dish of baked Muskie with Smallmouth, baby Sturgeon And Bald Eagle egg sauce. All kidding aside, I know it will make things better. The only problem is, I never see the laws change back once things do get better. They just seem to stick forever! Jignminnow <""{{{{{< tight lines wet nets"

I'm surprised that it has taken this long to figure out they needed to do something. If it improves the fishery than we all win in the long run. Not only is that area subject to some pretty heavy fishing pressure but that River system is very fragile because of the water fluctuations, that is with regards to fish spawning and forage.....especially in recent years. I can eat all the fish I want to back here in Indiana...... never could understand why people would want to go to such a great fishery and keep everything they catch (within the limit).....I won't judge though because as long as one is within the law it's their right. I long for the day when the walleye fisherman has the same mindset as the bass and musky fisherman do....call me crazy I guess."
