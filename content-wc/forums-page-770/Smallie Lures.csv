546481,fishinnut,2005-03-22 16:37:00,642,I have had great success with white senkos and white mepps or super vibrax. Crawfish colored fat rap by rapala has also been very good.
546483,Guest,2005-03-22 17:05:00,0,"Yea, I'll go with the Tiny Torpedo as well, I love fishing with these, and a 3"" motor oil tube for below surface."
546342,Guest,2005-03-16 13:14:00,0,What is your all-time favorite smallie catching lure? I have had best luke with a 3/8oz spinnerbait in golf shiner color
546344,Fred_G,2005-03-16 14:14:00,908,1/2 oz yellow/black Smithwick Devils Horse. Love that topwater action.
546345,Hawker,2005-03-16 14:40:00,3967,"3"" Power Tube in smoke or camo for fishing the bottom, Yellow Magic for the top water bite. Have caught'em on other baits but none have worked as well as those listed above. (For me anyway!!) Hawker"
546352,Trailerguy,2005-03-16 19:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A plastic crayfish imiatation with a hollow body contaning a few steel bb's, the orange/chartrose version seems to be the best, pitched towards shore, with a slow retreive."
546365,jigman 2003,2005-03-17 10:03:00,981,"Chartreuse Tiny Torpedo. Catches fish when nothing else will, I'll fish them even with a good chop on the water. They sound like no other prop bait coming through the water."
546384,BuckeyeWilly,2005-03-17 18:17:00,41,"Hey Jigman, if you like the torpedo I'll give you a similar lure to try. Its called a Phillips Cripped Killer in the 1/8 oz size. About the only difference between the two is the Phillips lure has 2 props - front and back. I have killed smallies here in Ohio and also in Ontario on this lure. I believe Cabelas sells them. Love that topwater action!!!"
546393,jigman 2003,2005-03-18 06:31:00,981,"Thanks, I'll give it a try. Are the props similar in design? That seems to be the key to the Torpedo, no other lure that I have found has props like that."
546428,BuckeyeWilly,2005-03-19 22:03:00,41,"No Jigman, the props are different. Lengthwise they are about the same but the torpedo prop is shaped more like an airplane prop that comes to a point on the end. The crippled Killer is more rounded. It usually takes a few casts to fine tune both blades and get them spinning correctly but once that is done you are good to go. Sometimes a steady retreive works, other times a jerk and pause gets them going. Light tackle, 6# test, what a blast!!"
546444,Guest,2005-03-20 20:28:00,0,Without a doubt......one word..........SENKO!
546446,Guest,2005-03-21 07:34:00,0,"A chartruse sparkle 3"" tube in stained water. My best on Erie for smallies was a green with black spots tube. I do not care about the make too much. I feel a tube is a tube."
