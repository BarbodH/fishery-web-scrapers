546454,Guest,2005-03-21 17:44:00,0,I am heading to Canada to fish for Pike. I am interested in any info that anyone has for reasonable $ pike fishing in either Quebec or Ontario. I am interested in remote fishing and the cost in the neighborhood of 800 to 1200 per person per week. Let me know about size and quantity. thanks

Are pike your first choice, and walleyes second? Are you solely interested in trophy fish? What time of year? Fly in or drive in?"
546482,Guest,2005-03-22 16:56:00,0,The timing for fishing is actually june thru aug to include the college kids. Pike is number one with walleye second for several dinners. the higher priced trips such as Manitoba et. al. may have to wait for another year - I assume Ontario/Quebec will fit the bill. Fly in would be great!! thanks for your response!

Just about every fly-in lake has pike, with some trophies. Many times they are caught incidentally to walleye fishing. Every pike over 38"" I have caught has been while jigging for walleyes. Lots of smaller ones when I start trolling/casting big spoons and cranks. Go figure. I am sure someone can help you out. You may want to try another website, (gasp!) thenextbite.com has a section just for pike and musky fishing. You could also ask the guys at Muskie Central. Good luck"
546521,515,2005-03-24 14:45:00,254,Check out Kevins place. Lots of monster pike with some great walleye fishing. Not a fly-in camp boat limited access to the lake. http://www.anglerskingdom.com/ Mike
546532,phishfearme,2005-03-25 06:19:00,1242,you can try way north lodge out of red lake. they have a few lakes where you have a very high probability of getting 40 inchers - especially setting net lake. there's lots of postings on this site about way north. canadian fly-in fishing out of ear falls offers at least two lakes where trophy pike are high probability targets - shearstone and findlay lakes. there's lots of others good luck phish
