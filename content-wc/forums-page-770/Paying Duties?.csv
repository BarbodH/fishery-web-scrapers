546414,Guest,2005-03-19 04:58:00,0,Right now in N.W. Ontario gas is about 87cents/liter X 4 comes out to $3.48cdn/u.s gallon. Take in the current exchange rate and it comes to roughly $2.90u.s/u.s gallon. So if you bring in 60 gallons you may save a whole $50 give or take. I guess you have to ask yourself is it worth driving 10 to 20 hours with a potential bomb in your vehicle with your family or buddies. Not to mention the hassle of pouring out of jerry cans and spilling and making a mess in the boat as well as possibly ticking off the lodge owner.(and as allready mentioned most of them do not allow extra gas to be stored in camp)Your choice.
546416,Guest,2005-03-19 06:51:00,0,At $2.90 per gallon after conversion I'm not to concerned. What had me a little worried was reading posts where guys were saying they paid $5-$6 per gallon at some lodges.
546433,Guest,2005-03-20 06:50:00,0,"We head up to Gullrock Lake, Golden Hook Camp rent their boats, gas is included, also understand that they give 10 gals of gas to private boats it's included in your package. Might check with your resort some gas might come with you package. Have a safe trip , good fishing."
546445,Guest,2005-03-21 07:26:00,0,"Everyone focused on the gas question, and nobody talked about alcohol. You get to bring up one case of beer, or one bottle of hard stuff. After that you pay duty. Duty on a case of beer is about $6. It depends on what you paid for the beer. Duty on hard liquor is much higher, so claim your bottle as the duty-free, and pay the duty on the beer. Beer in Ear Falls usually runs about $24 a case, so it is cheaper to bring your own and pay duty. Some would argue that the beer in Canada is better and worth paying more. A true Canadian Blue is nice. Two years ago on Lac Seul, a resort owner was charging over $7 US for gas we used over the five gallons a day. It is good to ask before you go. We also caught the owner cheating on gas and will never go back to him."
546448,Guest,2005-03-21 08:47:00,0,Well who was it that cheated you?
546449,Guest,2005-03-21 09:26:00,0,"I would rather not say the name of the resort. We had four boats rented (two 17' with 40's and two 16' with 25hp) and eight guys. Two guys got sunburned and fished some weeds a little about a hundred yards from camp in the morning, but never left Scout Lake for two days. They were lobsters and it ruined their trip. We piled six in the two bigger boats and took a long journey to Sunlight Lake two days in a row. We checked our gas usage with the resort owner on Thursday and he had us using 3 1/2 gallons each day for the two boats that were not used. We went over on the 40's but were way under on the 25's. He was trying to tell us that we were already over 20 gallons on all boats and would be charged for all future gas usage. We objected intensely, and he could not figure out how he made that ""mistake"". He must have gotten confused. So confused that he made the same mistake two days in a row. A side note. I did not keep any fish to bring home until Friday morning. I came in and found out that the two sunburned guys left early and forgot their fish in the freezer. We now were over on our possession limit with their 8 in the cabin freezer. I asked the resort owner if he wanted our fish, and he was clearly annoyed that I was offering him the fish in the deadwell. He wanted us to give him the already filleted fish from the freezer, or wanted us to clean the fish and give him the fillets. I am giving him 8 nice 16"" to 17"" walleyes and he is annoyed with me?????????????"
546460,rebelrn2001,2005-03-21 20:18:00,1563,It seems to me about a month or 2 ago someone on here made the exact conversion of US (gallon) to Canadian (liter) gas costs (not 1 liter x 4 = gallon) and came up with $3.71/gallon cost in Canada (not sure if that is US or Canadian $---probably Canadian--so .8 (or so) x 3.71 = 2.97/gal US if fair exchange is given--ie credit card). Likely that is up from then but so is the US.
546467,Trailerguy,2005-03-22 06:23:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Did you notice that Visa and Mastercard amended their terms to include a fee for converting foreign exchange rates to US ? I think mine said it's a 3% fee added to the transaction.
546369,Guest,2005-03-17 11:37:00,0,Does anyone recall what duties are charged on Alcohol and gas when entering Canada? How much gas can be brought in legally. I talked ot a friend who told me they always tell customs the only gas is what they have in the vehicle and the boat (but they dont tell them that they have two thirty gallon containers of gas in the boat). I s it cheaper to bring gas in at $2.00 a gallon and pay duty vs. paying $.75 a liter.
546375,Trailerguy,2005-03-17 15:20:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]To begin with gas is more than .75 a liter. You can legally take a ""reasonable"" amount of gas with you, thanks to NAFTA they seldom ask about it anymore. Two thirty gallon containers are not likely to be ""reasonable"" if they ask. If you lie when ask any question by customs, you will likely find the consqueces to be ""unreasonable""."
546376,Guest,2005-03-17 15:26:00,0,"man, that's a lot of gas. hope you don't get in a wreck. you could become a crispy critter in order to save very few bucks. good luck and drive safely."
546378,Guest,2005-03-17 16:21:00,0,"Okay, maybe this came of wrong. I am not trying to beat the system. What I am wondering is what would the duty be on gas. IF I am traveling 600 miles into Canada and plan on staying a week at a cabin/lodge, It could take a lot of gas. I have heard stories of fisherman paying $5-$6 per gallon. So if it take 60 gallons for your boat(my first boat, so I have no idea how much gas I may go through) for the week and another 40 for your truck you are looking at at big price difference. I am just curious as to what the duty would be bringing extra gas in."

Call and ask the resort owner where you are staying, what they are charging for gas, or if your not staying at a resort call the chamber of comerce and ask what the local price of gas is."
546388,Trailerguy,2005-03-17 19:34:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]In the past the duty on gas was equal to the tax portion of the Canadian gas price. That means you pay both US and Canadian taxes. Which makes the total cost pretty much the same as buying it locally.
546394,Guest,2005-03-18 06:56:00,0,Do you know if they still charge that tax with NAFTA
546399,skrut,2005-03-18 10:15:00,52,"Not trying to rain on your parade, but I would call the resort you are staying at to see if they will allow you to bring the gas in. Many do not any more, because of insurance issues that it raises for the resort."
546403,Trailerguy,2005-03-18 11:06:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]NAFTA didn't eliminate taxes, it only ""greased the wheels"" mostly for big business."
