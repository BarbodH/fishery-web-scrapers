Next would be chartreuse, followed by yellow, followed by white. I like the power bait because I think (might just be in my head) it helps make the fish hold the bait in their mouth just a second or so longer, which sometimes makes all the difference in the world. When the fish are aggressive, or your fishing a jig aggressively, I don't know that color makes much difference. But, when the fish are finicky, and your doing the gentle lift and drop vertical type jigging, it seems that some colors perform better than others. I hope my spelling was o.k. for all you critics out there."

546471,Fred_G,2005-03-22 09:39:00,908,"White, white & white"
546472,Guest,2005-03-22 09:40:00,0,Plain old yellow seems to work best for me.
546475,Guest,2005-03-22 11:06:00,0,"I have had good luck with chartruce, orange, red, white... heck on the right day color does not matter. In general I try to match the tail color to bait the fish are chasing. Orange matched with a green jig, chartruce matched with a orange jig, white matched with blue, etc. sometimes a color combination works, and it does not match anything in the water. Pink will works at times, I have had good luck with walleye using a red (gulp) tail with a bronze mettalic jig. Have a great trip this summer! Agate"
546476,Guest,2005-03-22 12:39:00,0,"""White, white & white"" is probably the simplest, all-encompassing answer, which will be the best or as good as anything else in almost all circumstances. With alternative specific sets of conditions, sure one or two particular colours may flash to a deep-swimming walleye slightly better than white, but in general, white will get the job done the best the most often in all range of conditions. If you wish to use other colours for a given situation, and actually be successful most of the time, you need a solid understanding of colour theory, the basics of reflectance properties and the electromagnetic spectrum, the difference in light interactions above the water vs. below the water, the difference in the visible spectrum of humans vs. walleyes (and there is notable difference), and an understanding of how such details change with changes in water colour, water turbidity, etc. I teach a year-4 undergraduate course in remote sensing (analysis of satellite imagery) which requires knowledge of the same principles and I can tell you the avarage adult's knowledge of colour theory and reflectance properties is VERY weak. There is actually an article in a recent In-Fisherman which touched on this . . . it might be a place to start for those wishing to learn more. For those a little less serious . . . white, white & white."

546487,manitobawalleye,2005-03-22 18:46:00,885,colour works for me in canada color works for you in the states we say zed 28 you say zee 28 which sounds cooler.....:) when on the canada board please try and comply:-) :-)
546489,hawkeye,2005-03-22 19:34:00,112,"My favorite color is chartuese, then yellow. I remember one early spring all the walleyes were back in a shallow bay, we had been using minnows and chartuese twister tails, fishing was slow. I overherd a fisherman in another boat who had been doing quite well say, ""well it looks like white was the color (colour) today."" We switched over to white and really started catching fish. But chartuse still my favorite. Fish Canada three times a year for 27 Yr. Moral of story try different colors."
546493,515,2005-03-23 05:31:00,254,Ive had most my luck on the whites and yellows. I get stuck in rut when the fish are biting and forget to try others. Mike
