546516,Guest,2005-03-24 06:18:00,0,Trying to decide where 4 of us are going to stay at Lac Seul. Thinking about Scout Lake Resort but have heard some good and bad things about it. Can anyone give me some help?
546517,Guest,2005-03-24 07:12:00,0,"It has been a few years since I have been there but it is a really basic fishing camp. I have stayed at the main lodge cabins and the outpost site. We did not have and warm water for the showers that week at the main lodge, but other than that no major problems. Ok docking/ramp facilities. The location is ok not great. You have to run several miles to get to the main lake including a short trip through a shallow and potentially risky channel with underwater obstructions. Rolly(owener was very nice) but he did not offer much help to anybody on fishing or have much in the way of tackle at the resort. Like I said it was ok, everything was real basic and if you are going just to fish and don't mind basic accomedations then you will find this resort will work out fine but it is nothing special. For my money we now go else where on Lac Suel."

If you want to fish that area, there is Fisherman's Cove, Lac Seul Lodge, and Onaway Lodge. Silver Water Wheel is also near there, but it is booked for the year. Maybe I caught him on a bad week but he was about the most unfriendly owner I have come across."
