546123,Guest,2005-03-07 18:58:00,0,Just messing around with my fishing partners and we put this together... How to clean a walleye.http://www.fishingbuddies.ca/cpg132/...eye%282%29.wmv
546125,Guest,2005-03-07 20:32:00,0,"Cripes...I thought I was going to see blood spewing like that SNL parody on Julia Child. Heck, I look at my fillet knife and I have a cut on my finger."

546148,Guest,2005-03-08 14:54:00,0,"I do not want to sound like a know-it-all, but I found a major flaw in the video. After the first fillet, you should take a break and let the fish settle before flipping it and doing the other side. During this break, you can either drink beer from a can, or drink beer from a bottle."
546154,Guest,2005-03-08 19:21:00,0,Can you do Y bones from Northern?
546160,Ohio fisherman,2005-03-08 21:09:00,989,nice video! will you sharpen my fillet knives? thanks for posting the video.
546213,515,2005-03-11 07:27:00,254,Thats a great video. Keep up the good work. Is the first method posted somewhere on the board? I'm going to go searh for it but if not could I get it somehow? Thanks Mike
546221,phishfearme,2005-03-11 13:43:00,1242,"well, everybody has their favorite way - let me add a few thoughts: 1 - in the second method, if you remove the rib bones BEFORE removing the skin it's much easier and less waste. 2 - removing the ""pin bones"" - has anybody used the ""zipper method"" where you hold the fillet by the tail end with both hands and physically pull (zipper) the upper and lower fillets - one half will then have the pin bones than can then be removed with one more zipper move using the knife to start the second zipper??? 3 - a 3 pound walleye is about 20 inches, isn't this abit large?? phish the phish cleaner"
546225,Guest,2005-03-11 16:21:00,0,"Have not tried filleting a 20 inch fish in years...its in the slot. Does the zipper work on 30"" fish? Just kidding."
