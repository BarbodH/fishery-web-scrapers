546359,Guest,2005-03-17 06:18:00,0,"please dont buy anything in canada if you can avoid it, its way over priced and not the best quality. save your money and buy in WI or MN along the way, eh?"
546372,Guest,2005-03-17 13:33:00,0,"If you are coming to Canada, isn't the reason for you coming is because you want to come to Canada? We in Canada depend largely on your patronage of our businesses for our own welfare. Buy in WI or MN when you are there...Buy in Canada when you are here... I know that when I go to Disney World, I wouldn't be bringing my Canadian beaver Suit to wear around...Get the point?"
546374,Guest,2005-03-17 14:28:00,0,"when i first started going to ear falls, i tried to buy everything up there. over the years i found myself bringing more and more stuff up with me. the prices up there are just way too high. that goes for everything you purchase. this year for the first time, i'm taking groceries. stuff you can buy for 89 cents down here is 3 bucks at the little grocery in ear falls. crawlers at $35 a flat at my bait shop are almost twice that at the bait shop up there. i could go on and on. i know it's a remote area, but you all are going to have to get a lot more efficient and competetive to get my business. sorry, that's just the way i feel about it."
546432,Guest,2005-03-20 05:35:00,0,Stay Home! If you are not happy with the cost of your vacation stay at home or utilize the resources in the states. I believe Canadians who rely on the the tourist are beginning to feel frustrated with this issue.

You won't have to worry about anything spoiling, because most of the stuff on there shelves is already spoiled! One thing for sure, you won't have to worry about it being spoiled...takes one heck of a load off your mind. This way you can concentrate on fishing instead of filling that belly button of yours Makes cents to me"
539657,Guest,2004-05-19 05:26:00,0,"I will throw my vote to the Safeway in Dryden, nice store and so is the store on 17 across from Wallmart, but that one closes at 9:00 or 10:00 PM. Wallmart is not 24 Hours. Not sure about their hours but the Safeway Phone # is 807-223-2385. To get to Safeway, turn at the light on 17 by the Weyerhauser Mill and go south about three blocks. Why not help the economy out on that side of the border, their prices are similar to US."
539664,Guest,2004-05-19 07:00:00,0,"Thanks everyone for the suggestions, I think we'll probably hit the Safeway in Dryden, and we'll make sure to get the card....I am assuming US residents can get it, right? Also, I am also assuming we can get all necessities there, i.e.; oil, batter mix, soda, lots of ice, steaks, potatoes, veges, snacks, breakfast stuff....etc. I expect to be in Dryden at about 3:00 PM...we should be good, eh?"
539665,Guest,2004-05-19 07:18:00,0,"After a 10 minute stint on the World Wide Web, I found this website:http://www.safeway.com/default.asp It is for Safeway, it appears one can print the club-card directly from their site and you can just bring it with you when shopping. This place seems to be quite nice and big (hopefully has everything we are looking for). Thanks again for the info!"
539773,Guest,2004-05-20 22:46:00,0,"Why not wait until you get to Sioux Lookout. It has all the services and amenities you will need. You won't have to worry about keeping groceries fresh (especially meat) and on ice. Check in to wherever you are staying and then go into town to visit the grocery store, beer store and liquor store and whatever else you might need. The local businesses will appreciate your support for the local economy. Below is a link to Sioux Lookout and its Chamber of Commerce. Johnny's Foodmarket has all the grocery supplies you will need. Actually they are building a new store which should be completed by this summer.http://www.siouxlookout.com/"
539778,Guest,2004-05-21 01:50:00,0,"we pre freeze alot of our food that needs frozen and then put dry ice on the bottom of our coolers. about ten pound,s that will last at least five or six days in quitico. ps we also freeze one gallon of water in a milk jug to keep it cold for a little longer trips, plus you have a gallon of cold water mid trip good luck"
539788,Guest,2004-05-21 06:56:00,0,"Thanks again guys. I think what we are doing, is bringing all our drinks (bottled water, jugs of juice and mild), steaks (for the one night we don't eat fish) all frozen from home. The rest of it we'll pick up in Dryden."

539621,Guest,2004-05-18 09:16:00,0,"Hey Everyone, Just wondering if anyone can recommend a larger grocery store (Pick-n-Save, Cub, Copps) somewhere around or north of Superior, WI along the HWY 53 route. Last year, we did all our shopping prior to departure, and before we even got out of the state, all the ice was melted....so, we figured wed try to do our shopping as late in the drive as possible. Thanks!"
539625,rpieske,2004-05-18 10:59:00,1276,"Where are you headed? If going into Canada, I can make suggestions in International Falls, MN, Nestor Falls, ON, Emo, On. Let me know."
539626,Guest,2004-05-18 11:05:00,0,"Sorry about that, we are heading through Wisconsin, to the Sioux Lookout area. HWY 11 to HWY 502 to HWY 17 to HWY 72 Thanks!"

539636,retire55,2004-05-18 17:23:00,1029,"Wooglin: I looked up the town of Dryden, Ontario. Its population is about 8500. They have grocery stores and even a bait and tackle shop (Riverside Bait and Tackle - [email protected]), that can provide minnows, worms, leeches, topographic and provincial series maps, depth maps, fuel, convenience store, tackle, hunting and fishing licences and ice (block, cube and dry). Might be worth a look."
539638,Trailerguy,2004-05-18 17:39:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Dryden has a nice new Safeway store downtown, Walmart is East on hwy 17, they have some grocerys and a Murphy's Oil station, or right across the road is another large grocery store, the name of which escapes me right now. Tim Horton's is next door to it (just in case you need a donut). :)"
539639,Guest,2004-05-18 19:39:00,0,"Trailerguy, Do you know if any of those stores are open 24 hrs ?"
539641,cough6609,2004-05-18 20:22:00,48,"Don't know about 24hours, but Wally world carries an extended amount of groceries and what you can't pick up there, across the street is a very nice full-line grocery store for the perishables. Both places are very reasonably priced and both except credit cards so you get the full exchange rate. Know the Wal-Mart well as I had to get a prescription after a ""snake"" decided to veer left when I was moving right and the 7"" rapala treble went through the middle of the thumb nail...don't recommend it or the Canadian socialized medicine...4 hours of waiting in the emergency room...lots of FUN! Cough"
539643,Trailerguy,2004-05-18 20:57:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I'm pretty sure they open at 8 AM, and watchout for Canadian holidays. I stood outside Walmart one morning waiting, watched employees go in, finally one told me it was closed but they we're doing inventory. ;)"
539649,AB,2004-05-18 23:30:00,61,"If you go to the safeway in Dryden, take two minutes and go to the customer service desk. Ask for a safeway card. The card is like an instant coupon. Most items are heavily discounted for cardholders. You will even save money at the gas pumps with the card. The card is not a credit card and there are no hassles. Last year I saved over $100 using the card just the one time."
