Bob passed away early this year in his sleep. He had bought the camp back in the 70's from the original owner Ed Crawford. He and wife Millie were great hosts to all that stayed at Crawfords. Millie & son Matt and Scott are now running the camp. All of us that go there every year hope they will continue Bob's tradition and keep the resort open for all of us who love to return each year. I know son Matt the best, who when I first stayed at Crawfords was still in diapers. Bob taught Matt & Scott the love of the lake and fishing and they are both excellent guides but would rather be fishing themselves than guiding I'm sure. Bob who's camp message board name was ""Fishin Fool"" here is one last message. We will all miss you!"
