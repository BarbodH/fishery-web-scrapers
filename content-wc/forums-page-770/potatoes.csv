Since fish and potatoes are our main course we don't need too much of anything else. As you go past the Goose in Wawa we stop at the first grocery on the left , just past the beer store. It is a small store but has all your needs. Fresh bread , potatoes and other real nice vegies. We even picked up a couple of steaks there too. Get bait at Young,s General Store and an ice cream cone too. Good stopping off point and reasonable motels. Kinda got to be a habit with us to stop there going and coming from Armstrong."
546456,Guest,2005-03-21 18:34:00,0,Is there still a ban on raw potatoes taken across the border???
546458,Guest,2005-03-21 19:32:00,0,Yes
546459,Bean,2005-03-21 19:47:00,20,"What if they are skinned, diced up, and vacuum sealed in a bag?"
546461,Guest,2005-03-21 20:32:00,0,"Potatoes can not be raw; canned, frozen, etc.are OK."
546463,Roadhog,2005-03-21 20:42:00,17,"How about french(I mean freedom) fries, boiled potatoes, au grautin potatoes, potato pancakes, potato rolls, spudnuts, cheesey potatoes, hash browns, sweet potatoes, curley fries, and fried potatoes? Are these all banned? Do they have potatoes in Canada? What about grocery stores?"
546464,Catman59,2005-03-22 04:13:00,345,"Yep you will be impressed....You can get your ""IDAHO RUSSETS"" there !"
546484,Trailerguy,2005-03-22 17:47:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Fresh potatoes can carry a blight, commonly found in soil. That is the primary reason you can't bring them across the border. However if you happen to be a large exporter you can buy a permit and have your potatoes inspected, they can be sold in grocery stores across Canada.;) Processed potatoes can be taken across by anyone. If customs wasn't checking for potatoes who knows how they would occupy there time?"
546497,Guest,2005-03-23 07:31:00,0,Trailerguy is all over this one. The russets you buy in Canada are fine and it gives the custom guys something to do.
