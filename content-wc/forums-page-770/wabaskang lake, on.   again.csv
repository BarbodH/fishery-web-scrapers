546353,Trailerguy,2005-03-16 20:03:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]You will get good information from your hosts at Kingfisher on fishing spots. ButTommy Williams at WWW.sleepydogcabins.com has been on Wabaskang most of his life and has hired out as a guide in the past. I beleive his nephew was guiding out of his camp last summer as well, but his name escapes me."
546362,Fred_G,2005-03-17 08:54:00,908,"Cynthia, I have never seen the need to hire a guide on Wabaskang. The lake is really pretty easy to figure out. The lodge owners are also very helpful in putting you on fish. Good Luck!"
546383,Guest,2005-03-17 18:13:00,0,"check out www.tallpinescamp.com they have a beautiful camp there and know the lake.steve and andrea are as nice of people as you'll ever meet!tell ""gruper"" that rudy sent ya![he shouldn't hold it against ya,i hope!]"
546492,Guest,2005-03-23 03:44:00,0,"I would ditto the part about hiring a guide. If you are just a novice then maybe, but sounds like you and your husband fish alot. You will have no problem finding fish. Most camps provide great info about where to fish and also you will learn alot from the other people staying at the camp the same week. Once on the water don't be afraid to ask questions from others, most will be very helpful and not try to avoid giving advice. If your looking for shore lunch, most camps offer kits that have all the items needed to cook one, just ask the owners. If you are going any of the trips we are you would be welcome to join us, we have one almost every day if the weather is nice. Which week did you book?"
546496,Guest,2005-03-23 07:16:00,0,Just curiuos as how the weather is right now and how much snow did accumulated over the winter. Heard the ice was pretty thin. Do you think the water level will be high again this year?
546502,Fred_G,2005-03-23 09:17:00,908,Here's a link to statistics for Red Lake. It should give a good idea of what the snowfall around Wabaskang has been.http://www.theweathernetwork.com/wea...ges/C02068.htm
546508,Trailerguy,2005-03-23 14:29:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]They had 3' in the bush at Christmas time. One report I got was close to 5' total over by Kenora. One neighbor said the lake came up about 10"" last fall prior to freeze up. Normally the lake doesn't come up until a few days after ice out, even if the snow has melted in the bush by then. I think the question is going to be ""How High"" by opener. I'm going to check with a neighbor again this weekend if I can catch up to him."
546509,Greg @ ABL,2005-03-23 14:48:00,23,"Before we left camp in mid-October the waters had come up about 12"" since Labor day. It was a very high water year most of 2004, and the start of 2005 looks to be about the same. Snow depth in our area runs at about 3 ft and is pretty compact. There will be lots of water once spring temps get going, along with some rain. Hopefully the weather is much more stable and nice in 05... All the best, Agate"
