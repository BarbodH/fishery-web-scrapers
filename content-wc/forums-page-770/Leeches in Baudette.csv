We are trying the crossing there on the way up for the first time, and don't know what is there/available for baitshops. We leave on June 3rd anyone else traveling at this time? Thanks much"
546479,Bill Krejca,2005-03-22 15:35:00,6107,Where are you heading?
546485,Guest,2005-03-22 18:19:00,0,"If you are driving up through Nestor Falls, there are a couple of sport/bait shops along the road. Yeh, we are heading up on the same day. Going to stay overnight just North of Nestor Falls. Taking it easy on the way up sure makes that first day of fishing more enjoyable. (or maybe I'm getting older also). Good luck. 72 days and some change."
546498,Guest,2005-03-23 07:44:00,0,I second Nestor Falls. There is a nice little bait shop on the right side just as you come into Nestor. Large parking lot for turning around rigs and the prices aren't all that bad. Can't beat jumbos by the pound!!...........can't believe I just said that?!?!
546500,Guest,2005-03-23 08:00:00,0,We are heading to Dogtooth Lake. Thanks everyone for the info. We plan to stop in Nestor for a burger before we get to camp anyway. Good luck on your trips. Is anyone else heading to Dogtooth?
546503,DaveIN,2005-03-23 09:27:00,191,"Eastwood's Bait and Tackle, 1-807-484-2401 at Nestor Falls. If you give Kevin Leonard a call, he will make sure to have your bait ready and give you a price. If you want a large quantity, call about two weeks ahead. As stated in another post, there is plenty of room to park and turn your rig around."
546510,Guest,2005-03-23 14:56:00,0,How much is a pound of leeches in US dollars and how do you keep them?
546512,Bill Krejca,2005-03-23 15:54:00,6107,"I usually get my bait at the bait store on the right side of the road in Nestor Falls, but it is the one that is attached to the grocery store. The help there are friendly and curtious."
