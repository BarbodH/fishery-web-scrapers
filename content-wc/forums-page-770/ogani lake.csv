546452,Guest,2005-03-21 14:13:00,0,"Have fished the Ogani, White Mud, Bluffy Lakes for a number of years. You'll find Walleye and Northern there, most everybody has good luck on jig & minnow. Ogani isn't a large lake by any means, only about 2-3 miles long and less than a mile wide. Bluffy is considerably larger. Are you going to an outpost or camping? Where will you be coming from? Maybe I can give you a few directions as well as a few good fishin spots. Email me at [email protected]"
546501,Guest,2005-03-23 08:46:00,0,I have fished it for many years and stayed at the outpost owned by Evergreen lodge. It's very quiet and peaceful. The fishing is pretty good with many walleyes of eater size and larger. The supply of northerns are plentiful with a few trophy size. It's a beautiful quiet little lake I have enjoyed with my son many times. grumpy
