5002809,yoopertrout,2016-07-19 19:42:00,1172,"I've never been further north than the Ear Falls ON area. I have caught grayling in Montana. Beautiful fish. Yesterday I fished the last stream east of the Mississippi to have had grayling. They were discovered by European Americans in the 1880's and wiped out by the 1930's. Still a beautiful stream, and the brookies survived, but they don't get very big anymore."
5004833,vteye2,2016-07-20 14:51:00,123,"Hmm, Yooper - MI ? I heard there was a small population?"
5005169,yoopertrout,2016-07-20 16:15:00,1172,"Unfortunately not. They've tried several times to re-establish them in the U.P. with no luck. There is a private, pay to fish lake in the L.P. that has them, and I think they are going to try to re-introduce them in a stream in the L.P. A lot of the famous trout streams of the L.P., like the Au Sable, originally had only grayling, and no trout. All wiped out by the log drives."
5005297,Larry S,2016-07-20 17:04:00,665,"Fished at Reindeer Lake Lodge in 1997 the last year Gangler owned it Got my largest pike at 47"" Service from Lodge was another story Went to Misaw Lake which is in the far northeast corner of Saskatchewan next to Manitoba and a bit south of N W Territories Got nice pike in 40 in range biggest at 44 also caught a lot of 10 to 25 lb lake trout The best catch of trip was several grayling in the 2 1/2 to 3 lb range"

4995457,Bstar,2016-07-17 08:59:00,564,Burnt Lake with Bighook outposts. It's just west of Opasquia Provincial Park in Ontario near the Manitoba border.
4995657,Danstheman,2016-07-17 10:44:00,25,"Lived in Alaska two years near Fairbanks. Loved fishing the walk in lakes (tangle Lakes) near Paxton. Grayling, lake trout. Never did a fly in but hiked and boated to many magnificent lakes and streams for trout and salmon.Would like to go back before I get too old."
4998209,vteye2,2016-07-18 09:09:00,123,Baffin used to be included in NWT. I also fished around Denali and swam 3 times in Wonder lake in Denali park.
4998433,wantabigone,2016-07-18 11:05:00,39,"4X Lake Athabasca in northern Saskatchewan/Alberta. Caught some grayling (didn't target them much as the pike and Lake Trout are just so much fun) I must say though, grayling is the best tasting fish I have ever had. Gotta love that shore lunch!"
4998489,vteye2,2016-07-18 11:29:00,123,I've fished a couple rivers out of both Dillingham an King Salmon AK and SW Alaska is chock full of salmon egg eating grayling. They are a great species to add to the bucket list.
4999313,dhottle,2016-07-18 15:03:00,163,Fished Great Bear Lodge many years ago. Had an overnight trip to Tree River Camp a few miles from the Arctic coast. Saw a Musk Ox along the river.
4999881,zeebee,2016-07-18 17:51:00,1144,"Out of Ft McMurray Alberta to a lake 3 mi south of the NWT border. Nothing but big lakers and pike. Grayling a short portage away.More bear scat in front of the cabin than Yogi could pile up in a lifetime. My 12 year old son and I oddly saw no bear all week.Forgot my downrigger cannonball on the plane so I filled a big thermal sock with rocks, tied it to the cable, clipped my release to it and worked like a charm.The fly-out was memorable as the pilot hugged tree tops to get under the smoke from local fires. Then Ft Mac gets hit by this spring."

4994433,LoDo,2016-07-16 17:29:00,721,"..... in Canada. I had to edit, because many fisherman get to Alaska. However, very very few get to 55* and the far north of each of the provinces, NW Territory, etc....I'll start out by saying Ive been to Jan Lake Saskatchewan a few times years ago. Jan Lake is 55*. My largest northern came out of this lake at 44"". I was probably 19 years of age. Its the only place where I saw an actual chief, headdress and all living in a tee pee. Didn't think of it much at the time, but thinking about it now amazes me. Pretty cool! My dad keeps throwing out Wollaston as a fishing trip he'd like to entertain. The last 10 years I've been flying out of Red Lake directly west into Donald Lake which is located in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park. A buddy of mine has a private cottage. Donald is 51*.Has anyone ever caught an arctic grayling? I have not. I know the further north the smaller the walleye and if you get too far, there are not walleye at all. My group of friends and family primarily fish for walleye, so there wouldn't be a reason to go so far north where walleye are non existent. Curious with the rest of you. 31 days and counting!"
4994497,kzoofisher,2016-07-16 17:47:00,5144,"61 degrees. No walleye or grayling, yes arctic char and dolly varden."
4994545,Guest,2016-07-16 18:24:00,0,Somewhere just south of Winisk. It was actually a canoe trip but we caught a lot of pike and walleye.
4994593,Skywagon,2016-07-16 19:02:00,1106,"Alaska: salmon, dolly vardin."
4994633,jimirjr,2016-07-16 19:23:00,1149,"Heck... We got GRAYLING in some of Our Colorado lakes... Never fished for them, though..."
4994665,BornToFish,2016-07-16 19:36:00,1224,"I went to MacKay Lake (64 degrees North, 111 degrees West) for a caribou hunt. There were no caribou remotely close to where we were, so it turned out to be a fishing trip. I caught many lake trout, a few northern pike and one grayling."
4994697,Carnhzkr,2016-07-16 19:55:00,964,"I've been fortunate enough to make it into the Northwest Territories four times, before it became known as Nunavut. The farthest north was at about 63 deg north on the Kazan River north of Yathkyed Lake. It was quite an odyssey just getting there. My dad and I flew to Winnipeg, where we rented a car and drove to Thompson, MB. We spent the night in Thompson and the next morning took a plane to Rankin Inlet on Hudson Bay where we refuled, then flew to the outfitter's main camp on Ferguson Lake. From Ferguson Lake, we took a helicopter to Yathkyed. We saw many caribou and musk ox on that trip. That far north, grayling are like bluegills. You just toss a small spinner into fast water and there's one on almost every cast. The trick is to land the grayling before a lake trout gets ahold of it. Grayling are the favorite meal of lake trout.Other trips into the NWT were to Nueltin, Windy Lake (a flyout camp near Nueltin) and Selwyn which straddles Sask and NWT. I have great memories from those four trips."
4994977,pjshorthorn,2016-07-17 05:25:00,5654,"Jimi, They asked how far north you have fished......not how high you have fished. Up is not the same thing as north unless you are high PjShorthorn."
4995009,pjshorthorn,2016-07-17 05:33:00,5654,"I feel quite unworthy compared to some of you folks........51 degrees on Red Lake,Ontario. Quite an interesting lake. I would go back for a chance at another monster pike. PjShorthorn"
4995081,new hips,2016-07-17 06:14:00,498,"Great Slave Lake N61 ......we got some walleye, but not many. I caught Grayling on Maria Lake (actually a portage off Maria)N58 Manitoba."
