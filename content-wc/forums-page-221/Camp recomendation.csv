Looking for housekeeping only and trying to limit the drive up to somewhere near the WaWa area. Don't think we can travel much further with such a short time period. Looking to target mainly walleye with numbers being the priority. We were on Esnagi earlier this year but are looking to try something new. Have been to Nagagami, Wabatongushi, Oba, and Dog in the past. Not opposed to flying in for this trip if it puts us on better water. Looked at Hawk Air but not sure of which lake would fit our needs and what the availability would be with such short notice. thank you in advance. 1-shot"
