Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday was rainy and really wind . 40 mph winds on Wednesday my wife didn't fish on Wednesday. Friday was hot and a little wind. We only fished for walleye all week. Caught alot of 13-16 inch fish. Thursday we caught almost 60 walleyes 17-20 inches in little traverse bay. For the week we caught over 400 walleyes. We don't fish real hard. We leave the dock around 8:30 every morning and back usssally by 4:30.
