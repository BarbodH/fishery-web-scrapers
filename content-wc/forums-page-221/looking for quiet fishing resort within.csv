5004265,The tank,2016-07-20 10:42:00,340,I would suggest cedar lake at Purrault falls. We stay at cedar point resort. It's off the road a couple of miles and quiet. It's located right in the middle of the lake.

The fly out lakes though are housekeeping cabins with food provided, so not really a lodge. They do have an American plan lodge on their home lake, which has pike and lake trout but no walleye. It's a beautiful lake, but I don't know much about the fishing beyond that."
