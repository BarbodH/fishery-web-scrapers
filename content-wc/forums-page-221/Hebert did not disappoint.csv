4986785,octanehi5,2016-07-13 16:06:00,1104,"Hey I think I know that guy, It was good to hear your first trip to hebert was a very good one.Most guys that make that trip Set alot of personal bests As far as fishing goes. The week before yours LT in my group set his personal best of a 28"" 10.3lb fish,along with the best numbers of his life"
4987097,fishron,2016-07-13 18:05:00,317,"Ron, it was a pleasure to meet LT this year. A guy that has a load of fishing experiences under his belt and eager for more. It's great that Hebert gave him a memorable fish. I have a lot of confidence in my portable Lowrance fishfinder and quite often when I was maping a school of walleye tucked on the bottom, I would observe a large singular object separated from the main school. I know a fishfinder only covers a small area of the bottom but to me those marks indicated large walleye or pike in the vicinity of the school.The trick was to get them to bite and a few times on Hebert that would happen. Something, maybe a barometric change, would throw a switch a if you were in the area, multiple trophy's would be caught.No better lake than Hebert that I've fished for that to happen."
4993457,octanehi5,2016-07-16 06:32:00,1104,"Ron are you booked for 2017? I believe you have been contacted by Doug older gent, He's looking for two camps on the island that week or the next.My friend Gary ,who you meet last yr. is on deposit with me for camp #26- 6/25 to 7/2/17 so far"
4962969,fishron,2016-07-02 10:31:00,317,"Just returned from five days at Lac Hebert. Walleye fishing was great. Over nine hundred walleye for the four of us even with much time fishing for pike. Two days overcast, sw wind, three days nw sunny. Many walleye between 17 and 24 inches, my best was 26. Shared two suppers with Octanehi5's group. Good times!! Air Tamarac rune a great camp. The last evening after supper I personally caught over 50 walleye on one shoal."

4966689,octanehi5,2016-07-04 17:53:00,1104,"Just got back Home Sunday night, Great to have Two dinners with Fishron and his crew,one at camp#26,and at #21 Ron's camp, The water was warmer in the south end of the lake,with a better bite in the begining of the week On weds. morning the bite turned on in the big north bay as it warmed up,it was like someone flipped a switch,Seagull Island turned on,as well as the north bay slot. With the late ice out, the conditions on the lake were about two weeks behind a normal yr.Ron's crew as well as mine were banging Walter. Largest Walleye C&R 28"" 10.3 lbs, Eye witnesses Ron's two boats as well as some nice pictures in mine. Many walleye, as Ron said,were caught over the slot of 21""and returned to the lake only to be bigger next yr. Hebert continues to be one of the best fly to lakes in Quebec. My 15th yr on the lake was better than my 1st. The weather this yr was very volitile ,Constant changing winds, Very windy and lot of rain and thunder which in turn,The bite was on,Its hard to fish in that kind of weather,but the bite can not be beat. Totals were just shy of 1100 Walleye and 77 pike.1250 worms gave there lives to put those numbers in the boats. A few new Recipes were tried,Ron's guys made up a complex beer batter which was great along with other fixin's.In camp 26 we made Coconut Beer battered Walleye fried in Peanut oil , With a orange marmalede ,horseradish mustard,sauce , modeled after coconut shrimp. Big Hit. Already booked for 2017 same weekl, hope to see you there . Octanehi5 AKA Walleye Ron"
4969497,Matrix04,2016-07-05 21:00:00,13,"Came back Sunday night too. First time on Lac Hebert and we caught more fish than I could imagine (or believe even after reading all these stories here). Was very windy the 3 days we were there. Was in Cabin 25, and didn't have to go very far to catch fish. Ron, I may have seen you at Clorox Island one evening (two French guys in the only boat there)."
