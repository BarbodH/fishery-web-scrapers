Two years ago, I said I'd never drive this far to go on a fly-in, but after not getting the results I'd hoped for, I'm going to give it a shot. My daughter and I will have the 3 primary lakes to fish in addition to a portage that hasn't had a boat on it in possibly 20+ years. I will likely target the known fishing holes on day 1 and then hit the virgin waters on the morning of day 2 to see what may be in store for us. I will get home at 7:30am Monday morning after working a 12 hour shift, take a nap,and get everything packed and back to bed again in 24 hours. I haven't even touched any of my gear since I got home last year."
