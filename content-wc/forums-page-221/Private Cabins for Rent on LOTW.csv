We essentially are looking for some privacy. We are willing to spend up to $300/night. We have stayed at Resorts and have been happy, just wanting to see what else is out there. Thanks in advance"

Perhaps you could contact them and get the current issue's info or send me a pm and I will get you the same. http://lowdpoa.com/And here is the Craigslist equivalent for the area. http://www.kijiji.ca/b-short-term-re...ra/c42l1700249I don't have any experience with any of these listings."
