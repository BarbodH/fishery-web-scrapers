Sitting down at happy hour and no matter how many or few fish they caught understanding that its the experience that counts and still having a wonderful timePointing out little things in the lodge/camp that we often times take great pains in upgrading, fixing or adding to the lodge. For example a new painting, mount, maybe homemade cookies, a new net in a boat, fresh paint on a cabin, a new kegerator. Whatever it might be. We are human after all and when someone notices the small things it lets us know our hard work is not going unnoticed.When a lodge owner takes you out on his own time in his own boat to go fishing being appreciative. And fun.And finally a happy attitude. Believe it or not we feed off your energy. Throw off a negative vibe and it grates on us, especially during a long season. Being upbeat and positive is the greatest gift you can give us. At the end of the day we share in your same experiences and excitement. We get to be part of your lives during a wonderful time. We see your kids grow up, your new husband or wife, your last fishing trip with a dying parent, reunions after many years apart. And we take great satisfaction that we get to be part of it all. Thanks"

5000713,Obabikon,2016-07-19 05:44:00,2370,"Compliments on improvements. I have some guests that do nothing but compliment. Every time I make an improvement to the camp... no matter how small, they see it. They appreciate it, and they tell me about it. Anytime someone spends money and/or energy trying to make it better, it's nice to go noticed."
