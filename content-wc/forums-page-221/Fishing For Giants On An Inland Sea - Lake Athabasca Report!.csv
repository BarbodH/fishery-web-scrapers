4994057,bthomas3333,2016-07-16 12:40:00,465,Ok. Watched the videos. Why stick the boat paddle in front of the fish while reeling it in? Are you trying to prevent under the boat run? B-

4982977,Mike Borger,2016-07-12 10:48:00,1554,"My group returned from Blackmur's Otherside River Lodge on Lake Athabasca in northern Saskatchewan on July 2, and man, we had one heck of a trip!Incredible weather, great boats to fish out of, great cabins (with air conditioning), great food, and best of all world class fishing. The kind of fishing myself and most anglers dream of.All told my group of four caught 48 pike over 40"" in length with the longest being 45. We all caught endless numbers of smaller pike as well, but I don't count those. On the lake trout end of things we caught 7 giant fish between 40-45 inches and again countless smaller specimens in the 5-10 pound class.The river right in front of the lodge was loaded with walleyes although we never bothered with them until the last night. At that point we caught over 200 fish between the 4 of us in the late afternoon/evening of our last day until we grew bored. No big fish but the numbers were unreal.I also caught a HUGE pike that last evening on light tackle jigging for walleye which capped off the trip pretty well! That entire sequence, the cast, hookset, fight, everything, was all caught on film and the video is part of my report! Speaking of which if you'd care to have a look at this trip in greater detail you can see the full story here with lots of photos and video clips as usual.Cheers http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fi...an-inland-sea/"

4984057,joeflip,2016-07-12 19:06:00,75,Wonderful reading. ..great trip report. I hope to see these reports in print one day. Thank you for sharing.
4984145,Larry S,2016-07-12 19:32:00,665,"Mike ,Glad you had a Wonderful Trip to Blackmur's One of my work and fishing buddies son went to Blackmurs with TV fisherman Bob Meshikomer in the late 90's He had a great trip just like you and was on TV in an episode on Athabasca. On another note I'm going to North Caribou next year at the end on June and will be calling you to discuss fishing strategies, any GPS co-ordinates and marked maps you might have on Caribou. I need you help on finding Big Pike, as you know I'm better at finding walleyes and need All the help I can get to locate Big Pike Take care Will call you later in the year after the fishing season is over Larry S"
4984481,Mike Borger,2016-07-12 22:05:00,1554,"Cool, that must have been neat fishing with Mehsikomer!I can help you lots with the big pike on N. Caribou bud, no problem! If I remember correctly you're not going this year? You'll be foaming at the mouth by the time next June rolls around."
4984593,BrianE,2016-07-12 22:51:00,98,"Thanks again Mike for sharing, appreciate it. Glad your group did well. I know a gentleman who goes there every year in June with a group of friends and mentioned that he would never go anywhere else. I do not know what outfitter he uses but he always has a guide with him while in the boat and has the same one each trip (i think he said name is Andrew? He always comes back with stories and pictures of trophy Pike and Lake Trout. I never realized how good it is, Thanks again Mike."
4984601,Mike Borger,2016-07-12 23:05:00,1554,"You're very welcome! There are two other outfitters about 100km away from Blackmur's on the main body of the lake, all are great I'm sure!We were supposed to be guided - we were on the first afternoon, then we went on our own at my request. Being guided was fine, but being on a schedule wasn't. As usual we put in some long days. There were 20 other people in camp that week, all guided and we did better than all of them."
4987505,BrianE,2016-07-13 20:32:00,98,"Very nice! I have never been on a guided trip so don't know if i could handle it. When the word Guide is mentioned my other family members (that's our group) say no way, they would rather be on their own."
4987721,Mike Borger,2016-07-13 21:46:00,1554,I'm with your family 100%. Finding the fish and figuring things out is what I love the most. Someone else on the tiller takes all the fun out of the sport for me.Plus I have yet to fish with a guide who didn't hinder my ability to catch fish is one way or another. I do better left to my own devices.I know how that sounds. Now I'll probably be crucified LOL!
4989305,adempsey2.0,2016-07-14 12:31:00,612,"Awesome report as usual. Nothing like pulling up those dinosaurs from the depths.In relation to guiding, after my last trip I decided that I am not listening to anyone anymore. The last few trips I listened to the owners suggestions and it rarely worked in my favor - I mean, I wasted days fishing unproductive water. The times we had decent success were spots found on our own. Although, I do hate driving the boat....."
