In that case, it was a couple decades ago, and the whole camps stood with jaws agape, but nothing was said. The other was more recent, and the guest was asked to not come back."

5003713,Bakefish,2016-07-20 07:00:00,1077,"My dad blew the cover off of a guy lying about his fly in only lake at a Chicago outdoors show many years ago. He stood at the counter and listened to the guy lying to a prospective customer about his pristine fly in lake and waited for the perfect time to interject, ""Why would he want to fly in when he can take the logging road right up to the lake?"" The lodge owner stammered and was taken aback and awkwardly stated that the logging road was closed. Hilarious. We had driven to that lake on a day trip the previous season, and the road had been open for several years before we went there."

Most (all) of the posters here either have jobs or had jobs. I'm sure each and every one of them have things that annoy them about their work. These are simply threads that point out the silly things some people do that irritate others. Hopefully none of the people here are culprits to hitting a rock and not being truthful about it. Also, in the other thread, hopefully all the owners here don't do hidden charges, and/or gouge their guests when the guest is honest enough to tell you they hit something."
4999265,farmnfish,2016-07-18 14:39:00,130,"I was grouse hunting once staying at a pretty new lodge with decent furnishings, the lodge owner stopped in the say hi and in the middle of the conversation my bird dog decided to craw up on the couch. I could tell the owner was pissed, and I did put the dog back on the floor. The dog was pretty dirty."
5001193,Bakefish,2016-07-19 08:59:00,1077,"Went on a waterfowl hunt many years ago. The operator promised us a room in a nice rustic lodge, guided hunts with all equipment supplied and order off the menu meals.When we got there we were told the lodge burned down, and we were placed in a house trailer and told we would be sharing that with another party. Luckily, the other party never showed up. Perhaps they knew.The first morning we were paired with an experienced ""guide"" who took us to a hot field that he had scouted the previous day. When we got there I noticed that all of the snow goose poop in that field was old and already turning white. We set up the decoys and it immediately became clear that this joker had no hunting experience. After all morning of watching geese fly off in the distance we began to pick up the decoys and spotted a game warden drive into our field. We noticed that our ""guide"" suddenly got very nervous. The GW pulled him off to the side and we saw him grilling this guy. After a bit he pulled me and my buddy off separately and questioned us. Apparently our guide was not a guide at all, but a handy man employed by our ""lodge"" owner. Not licensed. After lengthy questioning by the game warden we were informed that we were off the hook. Apparently there may have been an issue with us being involved with this guy, but it was determined that we were in the clear. In fact the warden was very nice and polite.I confronted the owner and read him the riot act. He swore he'd make it good.Dinner that night was hardly order from the menu. It was a pan of spaghetti and garlic bread...and not enough for everyone at that. The ""meals"" continued like this for the rest of our stay.To make amends the owner took us out himself along with his best guide. He had us lay down on multi colored blankets in a harvested wheat field covered in vinyl camo covers that moved every time the wind blew, and on the open farmland of North Dakota that means all the time.We saw tens of thousands of snow geese, and that's all we did...see them. Anyone who's ever hunted fall snow geese in the States would know that you need superior stealth and deception to fool these buggers. Apparently we were lacking on both these counts.As we picked up the decoys at the end of the hunt we noticed 6 brand new, still in the box, layout blinds. By then I'd about had it.That night a cold front blew in, temps dropped to about 10 degrees and it snowed just enough to cover the ground. The pipes in the trailer froze up.We hunted that morning with the ""best"" guide in the camp. He put us out in the field and promptly left and sat in the heated truck. After about an hour we decided that we'd had enough and packed up and headed for home, only after the owner knocked $50 off our bill for our inconvenience. What a guy.After returning home to Illinois my buddy penned a letter to the owner telling him how displeased we were with both his operation and his $50 rebate. We also noticed that in his brochure the pile of dead snow geese was actually a pile of snow geese decoys covered up with a few dead snow geese. The owner responded by having his lawyer pen us a letter threatening us with a lawsuit if we complained to them or anyone else about our experience.My buddy's wife worked for a large law firm in Chicago and she took the letter to show to one of the partners. He chuckled and informed her that he figured that his gigantic Chicago law firm could make a North Dakota lawyer back off his threats.Well, we ended up getting most of our money back with the stipulation that we never talk of the incident again."
5001329,Shortline,2016-07-19 09:37:00,234,"I have been involved in two separate instances on the same lake at two different lodges several years apart. One time, I was on the receiving end of a very heated butt-chewing, the othertime was not as severe, but I still received a fairly good tongue lashing. The first time, we rented an outpost cabin from a lodge and boated in with our own boats/gear/food. Adjacent to our rented cabin was another outpost owned by a different lodge. The guys in the other outpost were there on a spring bear hunt and had flown in. One evening, over cocktails and socializing, they inquired as to how we got that big boat and all our gear there(we were in an 18 foot pro-v). We told them we used the public landing down the lake about 20 miles away. They were not happy, as they were told it was a fly-in only lake by their lodge owner. They complained to him, and he proceeded to come over and really chew us out for harming his reputation with his clients. We were showed a brochure that boldly proclaimed a wilderness fly-in only setting, and he was angry that we blew his story out of the water. Fast fwd several years, we stopped into a different camp many miles up the same lake in order to get some info, brochures, etc in case we wanted to stay there in the future. When we got to the dock, there was a float plane tied to the dock and the people loading onto the plane were quite upset to see us roll in, as they were told the same line of BS. We got reprimanded for that as well. So both times I have been chewed out by irritated lodge owners were due to me unknowingly exposing their lies.....lol."

They officially close the week before we got there, but stayed open for us, hard to beat that. Can't say much for Howie Bay on Red though, when you let another customer take your fish (communal freezer) and your comment to us was, ""you caught plenty"" I figure he was as dishonest as the 4 from Iowa who took over half our fish.

They had to throw out all the things left behind by these well meaning but misguided guests. The lodge allowed them to leave paper products, disposable salt & pepper shakers and sealed bottles of water in the cabins when they cleaned them. Everything else went in the trash. I assume the kids may have saved some of the alcohol for personal use, but very few people would trust food bought or prepared by strangers and there are a few people offended by finding booze & beer in the cabins."

I just got off the phone with Gramps to wish him a happy 76th b-day and he gave me a few ideas on things we can try during our trip to make the top ten list. I guess it is best for us to demonstrate our customer arrogance/ignorance during our stay and let the WC masses decide if it qualifies for inclusion on the ""peckerhead"" list .

I asked when check in was and you didn't clarify AM or PM.........SO technically I was late! Chew spit is gross........I don't care who you are. I didn't lose the anchor. YOu should get some that float. (for the record, I have stayed at Teds a couple times and know he runs a top notch operation that literally caters to most anything and anyone. The fact he has guests that don't think that is enough, is crazy) I have been a couple places with service at his lodges level. Pebble Beach Golf being one of them. Then again we weren't fishing there so I didn't have to break the rod into so many small pieces."
