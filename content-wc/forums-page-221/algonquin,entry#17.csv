5006753,gmattbruin,2016-07-21 06:00:00,174,Taking a very quick trip this weekend into Farmer and Booth Lakes off hwy60 entry #17 into Algonquin. Looking for any advice from anyone who has maybe fished either. Using fish kayaks. Heard Booth may have some decent-good pike?
5009185,fishron,2016-07-21 15:44:00,317,It's been quite a few years since I took a couple of canoe trip weeks into Algonquin. This time of the year it's smallmouth bass fishing although Booth and Shall lakes have pike. I did not get on either of those lakes but many others. For trout in the summer you need to go deep. I never used lead core back then but have found it works for lakers since then. The Pettawawa (sp?) on the northern rim of the park has walleye. Large chubs (up to 15 inches) can be taken on many of the lakes in summer on small spinners and jigs if there is deeper water off the island your camping on. Good luck
5009521,Mike Borger,2016-07-21 17:03:00,1554,Booth has fantastic pike fishing! It's a heat wave right now so you won't find any large fish in the shallows. I'd be trolling larger deep diving cranks like a Depthraider in deeper water. Any rock structure that falls quickly into deep water would be a good starting point and there's tons of that in Booth.

Your confirm on there being pike there, i have no doubt he will find them. He targeted Booth for tht reason. This is his 1st kayak trip as opposed to cabin trip so hes just doin a short version. Fishing FANATIC and darn good...if youre looking for any helpers or guides in the future on your adventures let me know. BTW, we come out of Abamasagi this on the absolute BEST fish trip ever. The #s were phenominal...way beyond anything ever...june 18th-24th....literally 1000s."

Tell him good luck, I'd be curious to know how he makes out. There are GIANT pike in Booth if he's able to find them."
