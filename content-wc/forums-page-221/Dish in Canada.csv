One of the guys brings his receiver from his house and it works up there off of his US account. The group we are going with does not use direct but DISH. Anyone have any experience with a Dish Tailgater portable satellite or Winegard X1/X2 in Canada? Everything I see says if the portable dish can hit a satellite, we will have dish. Thanks"

5000577,Moondog,2016-07-18 23:09:00,362,We travel with our dish and change our service address to get the locals. This time we used a Baudette address and were able to recieve Fargo locals and all the other channels in HD in Red Lake. Gotta use a service address in the USA. Worked perfect. NOTE: you have to have a free line of sight to the sateliites that are positioned about Texas. Trees etc block that trajectory so low so??? That is the drawback.
