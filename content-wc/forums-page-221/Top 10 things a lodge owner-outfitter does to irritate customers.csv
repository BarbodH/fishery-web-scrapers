5000625,farmnfish,2016-07-19 04:05:00,130,"My worst experience was driving 13hrs for a fly in, to discover all the lakes still ice covered. The owner never called to warn us."
5003721,kcguy68,2016-07-20 07:27:00,51,"Ding ding ding, we have a winner! Fortunately we found a nice lodge that took care of us and I filed a dispute with Visa, and did get my deposit back. Unfortunately, I made all the arrangements for that trip, so I get to relive that day on all new trips. Just something your fishing buddies won't let you forget."
5005137,yoopertrout,2016-07-20 16:00:00,1172,"My experiences in Canada have mostly been very positive. I did have one experience with a drive in lodge that advertised good brook trout fishing and showed lots of photos of brookies. Three groups from where I live went, each a few weeks apart one summer, and caught only a few, little brookies. I went two years later, same experience. I've come to believe that the big brookie pictures were mostly taken the first year or two of the lodge's existence, several were of owner's relatives, and most of the fish were dead. The owner admitted one of the pictures was from a different body of water no where near the lodge! I believe there was a small population of big brookies that was over exploited early on in the lodge's existence. I'd prefer a realistic view of what the fishing will be like."
4996337,biggamefisher,2016-07-17 15:33:00,540,"I find it funny that all these comments appear in a ""Canada Eh"" forum topic....guess all you Americans are perfect!"
4996433,Obabikon,2016-07-17 16:10:00,2370,"You do realize that there's another thread about what annoys lodge owners, right? Kind of a thing that's going on with the discussion."
4996473,Bstar,2016-07-17 16:30:00,564,Far from it.....the camp owner that I mentioned is American.
4996489,JAY221,2016-07-17 16:31:00,877,"I am far from perfect but I am pretty low maintenance as a guest and as for it being a Canada forum the lodge owner that I spoke of is a USA citizen. Later, Jay"
4997097,fishinnut 3446,2016-07-17 20:08:00,638,Come on now! Is there ever enough for you guy's ? I don't think the LCBO has enough for you guy's when you arrive for the week
4999473,NARDA 1,2016-07-18 15:46:00,636,He has never run out!!! lmao
4999681,kcguy68,2016-07-18 16:43:00,51,"I hate it when the lodge owner takes a deposit for your trip, sends you fishing reports, texts you about the meals you are going to receive, and then when you arrive after a 15 hour trip, you find that camp to be boarded up. To add insult to injury, you later learn the camp owners sold off their inventory the previous Fall, with no intentions of opening. That irritated me just a bit."
4999841,zeebee,2016-07-18 17:37:00,1144,Not having the camp boat gassed up in the morn and making me engage in his version of hide and seek.
4999857,zeebee,2016-07-18 17:42:00,1144,That is loathsome.
4999865,Bstar,2016-07-18 17:45:00,564,"WOW! I would hope you more than a little bit irritated! Since it's closed, what camp?"
4994305,fsz,2016-07-16 16:20:00,144,"I had to take the bait....that said, with the understanding that a clear majority of outfitters and lodge owners are honorable and decent (as are the customers) here we go in no particular order: 1. Hidden charges being added on, often for items previously listed as included or, if not specifically so stated, verbally represented as being gratis. 2. Charging US customers in US funds but charging Canadian customers the exact same dollar amount in Canadian funds. 3. The staff hitting on my wife...or me!"
4994313,fsz,2016-07-16 16:21:00,144,Forgot...I leave the rest for you all to add
4994337,joeflip,2016-07-16 16:52:00,75,"Sending my deposits up..and in turn the outfitter sends the confirmation letter, fast forward ahead six months later trip is over and paying the bill I see a 3.50 charge for sending out a confirmation letter. .why is it always the little things that irritate..maybe next time I will deduct the international bank fee from my bill..on a side note the fishing and boats were top-notch. ."
4994393,Shellback,2016-07-16 17:14:00,8083,Camp store charging in US $ but giving change in CA $. ( US owned camp )
4994657,JAY221,2016-07-16 19:36:00,877,"One year I had a depth finder/fish finder quit working. When we went in around lunch time I reported it to the owner. We went back out fishing for the afternoon & just messing with it I got it to work. When we come in that night I told him to never mind because it was working again. He says that's good because I couldn't get any of the spares to work & beside that I always figured my fish finder was in my right hand. He is one of the reasons I won't be back to that camp. Later, Jay"
4994961,HeHooksHimself,2016-07-17 05:09:00,725,"Similar to fsz, I hate the practice we have experienced in some camps of ""nickle and diming."" Forgot your life vest? $20 bucks a week, want boat seats? (who doesn't) 20 bucks a week. Want to borrow an anchor? 20 bucks a week., etc. No. 2 is crappy equipment without the ability to fix or replace it. No. 3 is asking for some ideas of where to start and the answer is ""on the water."" I love to explore but it would be nice to have an idea when you are on new water."
4995569,Curryale,2016-07-17 09:39:00,50,"1. Sloppiness - we were left in a lake once with straight gas and two stroke motors. Luckily I noticed it as I was filling up the first tank of gas. In a further stroke of luck the lake we were on was a remote drive to lake with a single cabin so we could go back to the main lodge. Burned up a day of our trip. The reaction when we told them: ""oh"". 2. Not returning emails. Drives me crazy. I suppose if you are sold out all year you don't have to but still bad customer service. 3. Not being honest on the webpage. ""Camp has electricity and a portable generator"" - get to the camp and it has propane lights. No generator. No wiring for a generator."
4995601,Bstar,2016-07-17 10:13:00,564,How about gouging on a motor repair? One of the guys in our group got lost on Lac Seul last year and ended up tearing up the lower unit on the camp motor. We took total responsibility for the damage but the camp owner told us it would cost $2900 US for the repair. He said that's what it had cost him on a similar accident to another motor that year. We thought it was very excessive but we paid it anyway. He did say he wouldn't charge us for towing the boat back to camp. How nice of him! All I know is his Dad would not do business that way. We won't be back. Looking back we should have asked for a copy of the repair bill.
4995929,NARDA 1,2016-07-17 13:25:00,636,"#1. Not having enough ""RYE"" at the bar!!!!"
4995961,pale ryder,2016-07-17 13:35:00,1937,"1, Not cleaning the sunflower seed shells out of the rental boat.2, Not telling me that someone hit a rock with the rental boat.3, Cabin dirty.Seriously though,In 30 years of going I've never had a bad experience in Canada. But here's a few things I think it is fair to expect from resort owners.Don't lie. Don't claim the fishing is better than it really is. Don't claim the cabins are better than they are.Everything should be in good working order.The camp should have lake maps that show hazards and some useful fishing info, like weed beds, reefs, etc.It should be clear what is and isn't included. I don't mind bringing my own towels, but I need to know.No hidden fees or costs.No oddly over-priced things, like $20 a week to rent a life jacket that costs $10 to buy, or say $10 for a bag of ice, or gas that is way over normal price.If you have rules like no alcohol or C&R only, be sure people know before they book."
