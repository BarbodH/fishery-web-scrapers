5001641,123chadder,2016-07-19 12:06:00,429,just wondering if happy day lodge is accessible by truck?
5001777,adempsey2.0,2016-07-19 13:10:00,612,It's a drive-to camp. You can walk there if you want. They do have a boat-in outpost cabin as well though.

5002161,123chadder,2016-07-19 15:46:00,429,"im looking for a drive to camp........ i have it narrowed down to happy day lodge,rays camps,green wilderness lodge,KANIPAHOW,Ontario North Fishing Adventures,chapleau lodge,flame lake lodge,Canadianfishing.com"
5004777,Habitual Eyer,2016-07-20 14:13:00,144,Happy Day is a drive to. Nice place and really nice lake. I think it may have the most potential out of the lakes in that region that you can drive to.
5004953,Shellback,2016-07-20 15:20:00,8083,I hope you are looking for a spot next year. I'd bet H/D is booked for the year. They may have camping spots open though.
5005481,123chadder,2016-07-20 18:26:00,429,"yes its for next year,i hear this place books up fast"
5005833,Mike Borger,2016-07-20 19:27:00,1554,"Knowing you and what you and your group prefer I think you'd enjoy Ontario North Fishing Adventures. They're on the old rail line right on the Oba River with direct access to Cameron Lake. Yes, you can drive to the camp on gravel roads from the north (hwy 11 Hearst area). The owner is a very cool dude, the walleye fishing is awesome and the cabin itself is amazing. More like a family cottage with all kinds of amenities."
