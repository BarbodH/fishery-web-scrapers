5007649,JayM5209,2016-07-21 09:35:00,1050,"Certainly an option. Mapquest says that route is 4 hrs., 19 mins. to Duluth and the 29/53 route is 4 hrs., 34 mins. to Duluth. Just personal preference but I'd gladly spend the extra 15 mins. for all four lane limited access driving. Either way . . . . ."
4995129,slick2010,2016-07-17 07:10:00,22,what's the best route for getting around all the storm damage around Ashland on your way to Canada from central Wisconsin??
4995225,Stringbean,2016-07-17 07:40:00,279,"I believe I would head straight west to Hwy 53. This is a major north/south route and if there is damage, it would be one of the first that would be fixed. You didn't mention how far north in central Wisconsin you are."
4995233,Hot Runr Guy,2016-07-17 07:43:00,16061,"I agree, head west to 53. Here's a link to WI road conditions;http://www.511wi.gov/web/traffic/map...=trafficSpeeds HRG"

4998065,JayM5209,2016-07-18 08:18:00,1050,29 west to Chippewa Falls then 53 north. By far the easiest drive. Once you hit 29 it's four lanes to northern MN.
4998281,camp chef,2016-07-18 09:42:00,915,X2.......Best way by far
4999185,slick2010,2016-07-18 14:05:00,22,Thanks to all for the information.
5004929,BrianBman,2016-07-20 15:15:00,2,We are also in Antigo and we leave on the 29th and we will be going 29 to 53
5007417,Fishoil,2016-07-21 08:55:00,1277,"Why not take 64 out of Antigo to 51, 51 to 8, and 8 to 53? I think it would be quicker than driving south to catch 29. Unless there's some storm damage on 8 that I didn't hear about..."
