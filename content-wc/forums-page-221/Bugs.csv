5007833,Jesse-WI,2016-07-21 10:15:00,534,"large numbers of mosquitoes in the cabin at night usually mean easy pathways. We always do an inspection of doors, windows, screens, etc first and apply duck tape as needed. Then we go on the hunt to rid the cabin as best possible. Entry and exit into the cabin is always very quick. next step is coils, spray, thero.... last step for me is a fan at the end of the bed blowing across my entire body."

4991385,lawson2343,2016-07-15 08:31:00,459,"In the event that you do get bit by bugs and react to them, my buddy provided me with a great solution. I react to no-see-ums. About 24-48 hours after getting bit, I get itchy welts. He noticed and went and got a bottle of Benedryl Spray. Within 5 minutes of spraying the bites, no more itching. Works on any bug bite. Had two tick bites last week at the cabin. Terrible itching the next day - the Benedryl took it away. Had to reapply once in a while, but well worth it. The knock off brands work too. I've bought Walgreens brand in the cream. I never go anywhere w/o it now."
4991449,Mike Borger,2016-07-15 08:41:00,1554,"Raid makes a spray specifically for indoors, not just home and garden. A can of indoor Raid goes on every trip with me and has for a good many years. It's essential imo. As you said - a quick spray 10 minutes before bed and Bob's your uncle. Far more palatable than burning mosquito coils all night."

4993321,Skywagon,2016-07-16 05:05:00,1106,"Everyone should be aware that we do have deer ticks in N/W Ontario that carry Lyme disease. Lyme disease is easily treatable if you catch it right away, if not it can be debilitating. Here are some signs of Lyme you should know http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...s/CON-20019701. There is a local lady in the Dryden area that has been fighting Lyme for over a year. A friends daughter was bitten by a Lyme carrying tick about 3 weeks ago, they recognised the signs and she starting getting treated for it immediately. Just be ware they are around."
4993409,octanehi5,2016-07-16 06:21:00,1104,"Hi Fishron I usually light coils just after dinner ,while we are out fishing in the evening. It kills them in house as well as repelles them.Any product that kills or repelles bugs is not good to be inhaled by humans or pets.I have to say that I am availible to smoke Cigars for your group and keep you embelished in good cigar smoke.Along with Making your boat the most productive Walleye and bug killing machine"
4993481,lawson2343,2016-07-16 06:42:00,459,Doc put me on doxycycline right away. Didn't even test for Lyme's as he said the two tests often don't pick up the various strains of Lyme's.
4993521,fishron,2016-07-16 07:06:00,317,Lot's of good advice and great offers on this thread. I'm not a bugaphobic but will certainly try some of this collective wisdom.......Thanks
4987145,fishron,2016-07-13 18:19:00,317,"It's an all to common problem on some of the most pristine, great fishing lakes in Canada with good cabins to have horrendous populations of biting bugs. I know the old adage that if the bugs are not biting neither are the fish. Doesn't help much if you can't sleep at night or spend much time scratching bites. Outdoors you've got sprays to help you cope and it comes with the territory that the biters have to be dealt with. My question is, has there been a spray developed that can be used safely indoors, like in the cabin your in, that can knock down the mosquitoes before everyone turns in for the night, that will allow everyone to wake up the next morning with no ill effects. I'd pay a few bucks for that one."
4987217,joeflip,2016-07-13 18:40:00,75,I swear by skin so soft products from avon..they have specific sprays and lotions that are for the outdoors also safe and not over filled with deet. I served over 23 years active Army and slept in some bug infested places and I found this to be the best out there besides pure deet. Just one grunts opinion. CLIMB TO GLORY.
4988225,Lovetofish,2016-07-14 07:15:00,458,Burn a mosquito coil and watch them drop.
4988321,SinOrSwim,2016-07-14 07:41:00,1528,what about using mosquito netting. Either figure a way to surround yourself in it at night or take a bunch with you with some duct tape and seal up your windows if the screens are crappy.
4988465,MikeG1,2016-07-14 08:03:00,434,"After experiencing what I consider an above average number of skeeters during my most recent trip, my entire group had a few discussions on this very matter. (BTW - We had good screens, but the critters were lined up at the door making it impossible to exit or enter without allowing at least 25 to enter the living area.) So, we decided on our next trip we would implement the following remediation efforts...in no uncertain order. 1. Thermacells 2. Head nets / suits 3. Mosquito coils 4. DEET 5. Battery operated fans...for use in the cleaning shack AND duct taped to the wall blowing our faces at night. 6. Sheets of netting We did not find Avon products to be successful. Please add your successful techniques to this list so we can improve our efforts. TX."
4988481,SinOrSwim,2016-07-14 08:09:00,1528,"Take some yard guard with you and spray around the doors. Also, take some outdoor bug spray. I use a product called Demand CS on my houseboat here. spiders etc. It's a concentrate. Be easy to take a small amount and mix up a spray bottle. Spray the door and the deck area outside the cabin. Will kill any bugs that land on the doors etc. And, the yard guard will help keep them at bay other than that so you could try to come in and out more easily. Could maybe hang mosquito netting over the outside of the door too? Personally, I'd pick a different time of year to go. LOL ONe of the reasons we go in September is because of the bugs."
4988625,Guest,2016-07-14 08:55:00,0,"Go to your local farm supply store and ask for ""milk house spray"". We spray the cabin in the morning and evening before we go to bed and it works awesome with no side effects."
4988705,Blue Lk,2016-07-14 09:24:00,269,"Get a can of Raid House & Garden spray. Give the cabin a good spray before bed & go to sleep, it's Canada in the bush.It's a way of life for us northern residents,we survive,so will you. Man-up."
4988721,Fishoil,2016-07-14 09:29:00,1277,"This is the best way I've ever found too. Just don't light one in a tent and forget about it for a couple hours, the tent ends up looking like it belongs in a Cheech and Chong movie. Don't ask me how I know."
4988777,fishron,2016-07-14 09:45:00,317,We have a Tractor Supply opening in a few day's. I'll check them for the milk house spray. I wasn't aware that coils did more than repel. I'll check them too. If I use the yard bug killers I might not make next years trip. Thanks for the suggestions. I'm just beginning my search.
