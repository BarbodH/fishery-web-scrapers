The food is excellent and all services cannot be topped. My guide Sam Hayes was supper we caught fish at every stop. Many fish over 25"" with the largest 28 1/2. Some days the 4 of us caught over 200 fish. Sam not only keep us on fish, but tried to keep us dry in the boat during some extreme wind. Not only was Sam a very good guide but was a friend in the boat. I booked next year on the 3rd day because of Sam and the staff. It's a family operation that can't go wrong. You'll love it."
5002785,Slim03,2016-07-19 19:38:00,159,glad to hear it was a good experience and fishing was good. I am heading up there in 12 days.
5002921,Fishin Fun,2016-07-19 20:13:00,218,That's great news. Earlier reports were that the fishing was slow. I'm heading up there on the 29th. How was your weather?
5002953,Crackback,2016-07-19 20:27:00,257,"We stayed at White Wings and had the same fishing experience as you folks and never ventured more than 2 miles from camp but I didn't need a guide and took my own boat. I will tell everyone when you have top electronics, finding fish and catching fish is super easy. For those wondering, I run a Humminbird 1119si with a pair of HD side imaging transducers and a 200/83 dual beam transducer handling the 2d imaging. I also run a Humminbird 899si strictly as a plotter with a Naviolnics Map Card. I never touched live bait, crawler harnesses or jigs the entire week. The Lodge owners are U.S. citizens from Georgia. We are going back next year for 2 weeks but will enter Canada from International Falls, MN."
