We'll be fishing out of Ear Falls, mainly at the river mouth. Our standard plan is jigging with minnows and leeches. I was wondering if anybody has tried night crawlers there this early in the season? In past trips we used crawlers exclusively but those trips were in August and fishing in the Bear Narrows area and were incredibly successful. It just got me wondering how effective crawlers would be in the spring. Cheaper than minnows and leeches but if they don't work, I don't want to waste my time. Thanks in advance for any input. 3 months and counting....."

We fish primarily the river mouth, depends on the ice conditions. Two years ago with the ice conditions we were limited to the mouth until the end of the week. We also get down to Lunker Point and Copper Bay area as well. We stay at Timberlane. It amazes me that the majority of the people fishing there opening week are from Iowa."

There's better and more fishing spots down the lake farther. We used worms and minnows on jigs and leechs on slip bobbers. If there's a time I would say minnows are better than worms it would be first 3 weeks of opener and after mid September. So with that said I feel that minnows probly don't catch any more than worms but probly all the ones I've caght over 28"" have been on minnows. So minnows might catch the bigger ones."
