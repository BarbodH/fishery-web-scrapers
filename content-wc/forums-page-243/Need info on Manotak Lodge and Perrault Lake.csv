1210884,Guest,2010-06-17 00:46:00,0,"My dad, 7 year old son and I stayed at Bob and Gale's Rainbow Point Lodge last year. This was our first trip to Canada. I can't say enough about the hospitality of Bob and Gale, the cleanliness of the camp and the quality of the fishing. In the week we were there (mid June) we caught numerous 12"" - 14"" perch, 6 pike over 34"" and a few walleyes. We mostly fished pike for the week, but did fish the river and a few of the bays which yielded our walleyes. I've stayed at a number of different resorts for the last 20+ years in Northern Minnesota and by far, this was the best trip we've ever had. At home, we fish 4-5 nights per week on lakes we know and we don't catch the quality or the number of fish like we caught last year on Perrault. We're going back this year, and if it's anything like last year, we'll be going back for years to come."

Yes Dave does spend a little too much time going over the boats and the fishing but remember that not all people who come to a lodge knew everything about a boat/motor or a lake. And their standard boat is a standard boat at about every lodge in Canada. You get a 14' or 16' boat with seats, and newer 20hp motor. He does have an upgrade where you get a better boat. larger motor. livewell. storage but like most lodges you pay more for that. I was there 2 years ago and never had a different slot size limit pushed on me. He does have a walk-in walleye lake where it is catch and release but he charges you $50 per person. In my opinion he should offer this to guests without a charge. Food is excellent. So if you want more attention, a better upgrade boat, chef quality food and above average fishing then Manotak is a place to consider."
1481898,BornToFish,2012-09-01 12:18:00,1224,"I was at Manotak Lodge the same week as RGD and his group. I understand, but do not agree with, the perspectives expressed by RGD. I also note that his perspectives were not shared by any other guests of the Lodge that week. I will not elaborate, so as to prevent this forum for becoming a ""pee on one another"" contest.Dave and Linda conduct an orientation session on each Saturday afternoon. Guests attend these sessions to cover things such as issuing fishing licenses, current fishing trends, camp policies, boat assignments and the like. This session is followed by dockside training in operation of the Lodge's boats and safe boating near the dock. As covered in the previous post, this dockside training may be too much for longtime guests of the Lodge, but may also be much needed by first-timers or boaters with little experience. It's a balance. I understand that the lodges on Perrault Lake have been encouraging guests to safely return fish within the ""slot"" (e.g. walleyes over eighteen inches long) to the lake. I also understand that lodges on other area lakes do the same. This practice has been in place at Manotak Lodge for about ten years. I am absolutely convinced that this practice has markedly and steadily improved the quality of the fishery within Perrault Lake. I freely admit that it hurt during the first year to return slot walleyes to the lake. Honestly, it now doesn't bother me or my wife in the least bit to return such fish to the lake. For us, like many other guests at the Lodge, it's the total experience rather than focussing on keeping a particular fish. We simply return such slot fish to the lake and catch another one. We enjoy our shore lunches and meals of fish at our cabin with fish beneath the slot.There are many reasons why I choose to stay at Manotak Lodge and fish on Perrault Lake for seven weeks each fishing season. Both the Lodge and lake are that special to me. Many other guests of the Lodge feel that way as well."
1481937,NWwalleye,2012-09-01 16:43:00,223,Dock side training is also the law in Ontario ..
1481977,Glenman12,2012-09-01 19:49:00,762,"I wasnt aware of that..Ive been going to the same lodge on Cedar Lake for over 30 yrs and never had any ""dockside training""..I do know of one lodge on Cedar that has a Saturday afternoon orientation but I dont know what it consists of.."
1498302,Guest,2012-10-24 20:51:00,0,"I spent a week at Manotak this summer. I felt like Dave was a bit too watchful and school teacher-like around camp, but whatever. He also has his own rules for some of the fish you can keep, which was confusing, but again, whatever. The fishing wasn't as great as I expected, it's a big lake and it can get really rough when the wind picks up. Once you found the fish it was pretty good, but you definitely had to work more than I've had to at other places. The fish cleaning service and meals being cooked for you were probably the best part, it was great not having to deal with that after 8 or 9 hours on the lake. I wish I would have known ahead of time that you had to pay $50 to go to the walk in walleye lake and it was catch and release ONLY. That was a fairly significant decision point in picking Manotak, and had we known that we might have gone a different route. Would I go back? I'd definitely consider it, but it's not in that category of no doubt return for me. If I'd want to fish that lake again, Manotak would be my first choice though."
1508787,DMella,2012-11-30 15:12:00,32,My Family and I fished on Perrault this past Aug - the first week. After messing around in the bays and arround the islands for a couple days and catching a few we started trolling the mid lake humps and ridges with cranks and ended up destroying a number of deep down husky jerks on both nice walleye and good sized pike. The boys and I even helped pull a fellow out of the water - no life jacket -after he was trying to get line out of his prop. Blueberries were abundant and the trip was grand.
4565585,[email protected],2016-02-20 16:30:00,1,"I feel I need to write this review to warn others who may be considering booking a reservation at this lodge. The new owners of Manotak have a strict policy of “no refund of a deposit after March 1 (in advance of a stay) for any reason.” This is stated on their website (click: book your stay, rates, deposits section). After putting down a deposit nearly a year in advance, we had a serious family emergency come up that prevented us from being able to go to Canada (we would be too far away from elderly parents who were having serious surgery). Since the issue on our end occurred after the March 1 cutoff date for a deposit refund, we were denied a refund. We canceled a month in advance of our reservation, as soon as we realized our predicament, however there are no exceptions allowed to the policy of no refunds after March 1 for any reason. We asked if we could transfer our deposit to someone else… surprisingly, the answer was no. We were told we will have a credit on an account for future use.Because of the two surgeries, and the fact that our aging parents are all still living, it will likely be some time before we could return to Canada. But after this experience with the new owners, we’re not planning on going back to Manotak. Buyer beware: if you aren’t willing to risk your reservation deposit, you might want to look at other lodges in the area. At the time of this writing, cancellations made in less than 30 days of the reservation result in a forfeiture of the entire deposit. Cancellations after March 1, result in a credit being issued. There are no refunds for any reason after March 1 and the deposit required per person is $250/person. See the lodge website to confirm these details."
1065362,Bearcat,2008-11-21 11:52:00,209,"Can someone give me the skinny on Manotak Lodge and Perrault Lake? I have read conflicting reports about the lake itself, specifically people refering to it as the dead sea. How much pressure does this lake really get? How may cabins and lodges are located on the lake? We will be going late August/early Sept. We like to fish for northern, smallies and having a chance at a muskie. Any comments would be really appreciated."
1065562,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-11-23 14:39:00,116,"Dave and Linda Becker own Manotak and it is very well run, a really nice place and they are very personable people. Cedar lake flows into Perrault lake and I fished Cedar many times. I fished Perrault twice and did just fine. In my opinion it is not a dead sea."
1065587,Bearcat,2008-11-23 18:10:00,209,"Thanks Rose. I have been reading your post for some time now and I know you have a great deal of knowledge and experience in the region. Manotak looks like a great camp to visit, I'm just concerned with a few of the negative comments about Perrault Lake. Best of luck to you and your camp in 2009."
1065718,Mike Kansas,2008-11-24 14:57:00,1463,"I have never fished Perrault but the Husband of one of the Ladies in our office has gone every year for the last 5 or 6 and their group has been very pleased with the fishing. I don't know what resort they go to but they do like the fishing. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1066486,mdoehling,2008-11-29 20:01:00,81,"I stayed at Manotak lodge two summers ago. Trip was in mid-August of 2007, so not exactly the prime walleye season, but the fishing was OK, at best. I personally fished mostly Walleye, but alot of the guys in our group fished a lot of northerns, biggest in our group was 36 inches I believe. Largest in camp was a 40+. One of the main reasons we stayed at Manotak is that they have exclusive rights to a Muskie only lake, Fluke. The first itme we stayed @ Manotak in 1999, we had tremendous fishing on Fluke so some of the guys wanted to go back and try it again. With that said, there were some problems with the lodge owners. First thing they had everyone do is attend a boating saftey seminar they hold for guests using there equipment, Now i can understand that they see alot of, lets say inexperienced anglers and boat operators, but they even made all the guys in our group who were NOT using there boats attend the seminar. Not that big of a deal, but we like to get checked in and get on the lake. Attending their class cost us 2-3 hours of fishing on the first night. So started off the trip with a bad taste. And even after it was demonstrated to them that we all had significant knowledge and experience operating boats we were treated rookies to the point of condosention all week. Really rubbed some of the guys the wrong way. During their seminar we were also informed that they have there own ""slot"" limit if you will. I believe that the ON MNR limits are 4 fish up to 18 inches, one over 24. (something like that) well he informs us that they clean all of your fish and don't want to see anything over 16 inches. This was what really set me off. It's fine if that's the way you want to run your lodge, No problem, but I believe that you shold probally inform your guests before they arrive, this was never in any of their publications or mentioned during the numerous phone conversations we had. Then upon check-out things really went downhill. we had orriganlly reserved two cabins for 12 guests, and had deposits for 12. When Aug. came around we only had 10. Well fine we figured, the min res. for the two cabins was 8 and we still had ten. So shouldn't be a problem, Extra deposits get applied to final bill. Well nope. He decided that all deposits were none re-fundable. What a crook. This happened Thursday evening, and we were planning on leaving the next mornig. Well I called him on this, pointing out the fact that the cabins had the min. occupancy and we shouldn't have to forfeit the deposits. He said he would talk to his Sec. and see what the situation was. Well my thought are that he knew exactly what he was doing. For Pete's sake he runs a fishing lodge and deals with groups that are missing a guy or two probally every week. Just before we are ready to jump in the trucks to take off he shows up with our deposits. So I guess it ended up all right, but no-body felt good about any of it. The group I go with is a semi-annual trip, (every other year), so we really look forward to these trips, and when something like this happens we really remember it. Also because we have never experienced anything remotly close to what he had tried to do. Through in the seminar and the incredible shrinking slot limit and the lodge left a bad taste for everyone. I for one will never return. Way to many great places to stay to try that one again."

1197776,Guest,2010-05-07 12:51:00,0,"Bearcat, Save your money, or go to Rice Lake, I hear Toronto has great night life. I've been going to Manotak twice a year for the past nine years and other than a couple of White Fish and the occational Perch the only thing this lake has to offer are great boat rides. So you and your flatlander fishing buddies please stay away and don't spoil this jewel of sunset country. The Becker's are attentaive wonderful hosts (which I hate), thier boats are terrible (mostly new 18 ft fully equiped deap V's with 50 Yamaha's), the fishing is the pits (unless you like catching trophy Pike and Bronze Backs and all the Walleye you'd ever want for shore lunch.) Not to mention the lake has the most structure in one single lake I've ever seen (I told myself not to mention that). And thoes stupid Muskie, a couple of springs ago I caught a 40"" er jiging for Walleye, you'd think they would know better. I really like not catching fish and that's why I've been up there around 18 times. I go for the boat rides. I'll be up there next week at this time for the spring opener, when I get back I'll tell you how bad it was."
1197972,teddi,2010-05-08 04:43:00,349,"no camps have exclusive rights to any lakes. i have fished fluke lake many times and have done well. manotak is a nice camp,a little pricey for what you get. perrault lake can be good at times but mostly is so so. there are a lot of lakes with better fishing in the area."
1198538,Guest,2010-05-09 20:24:00,0,"We stayed at Rainbow Lodge (just up the lake from Manotak) mid June last year. The walleyes were a little slow for us, but several others in camp did great on the Ord river. The ice out seemed to be keeping things about 2 weeks behind last year and this was my first time on Perrault, so the my walleye experience on Perralut was lacking. The smallies, Pike were great. Grassy Bay is a great Pike spot. Some of the island inlets were great for smallies. The south side had several fingered bays yeilding some of the biggest perch I've seen. All that said, I'm heading back to Rainbow this July 4th. -DJ"
1198604,team walleye,2010-05-10 06:37:00,336,"I've been going to Perrault since 2003 and staying at Rocky Shore Lodge. I have had very good luck on the lake with walleye, smallies, and northern. I love this lake, and to be honest don't mind people calling in ""the dead sea"" spread the word guys and keep calling it the dead sea. I wouldn't mind having the lake all to myself. Oh yeah.. I've also seen guys in camp every trip I've been on pull in some pretty big musky!In my opinion, this is a first classs lake, with plenty of great lodges on it.PM me if you would like any info on it. Bryan"
