We took a ""bonus"" trip the first week of September last year to Kaby Lake flying out of White River, and experienced 4-5 hour fog delays going in and out. We really liked the lake and lodge (Agich's), but losing most of the first day of a 4 day trip was kind of a bummer.We got the impression from the camp that this is not too uncommon of an occurrence. Can anyone who has more experience in this region, including Wawa, shed some light on how typical this situation is and whether it is more prevalent at different times of the year?Thanks."

The return flight was also delayed , due to fog on Wawa Lake. Air-dale later moved their operation to Hawk Junction , to get further inland , away from the Lake Superior coastline , where the fog was coming from. Numerous times , as we have traveled around Lake Superior ,, we have actually had to pull over and wait, as the fog was to thick to see to drive."
4520553,Mike Borger,2016-02-06 06:20:00,1554,Because of the prevailing winds and proximity to Lake Superior fog is very common when flying out of White River and Wawa.I've flown in that region a lot and it's not like the fog is a sure thing. I've had plenty of trips where there was none. But it's certainly been an issue at times.
