4560881,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-19 08:30:00,461,"99% of our guests are wonderful honest people. When they break something they own right up to it and let us know and have no problem paying for any damage. Any good person would do the same. If you break something of someone else's you man up. Where it gets interesting is the 1%. I find it comical yet disheartening to see someone hide damage to a prop or motor or whatever and or blame someone else for their mishap. I have had a group into a trip for 12 grand hide a broken $100 rod. Literally take the rod I lent them that they broke, and then break it up into smaller pieces and stash under the life jackets so they wouldn't have to pay for it. Or not mentioning they blew out a prop. Is that how you were raised?So, as a lodge owner what do you do? Call them out and risk them not coming back? Big dollars at stake here. Especially if they were new. Even if they let me know they hit something I nearly always ate that expense. Still do. Cost of doing business. Where I draw the line is when a guest is going to be deceptive. If you are going to go our of your way to cover something up that you broke I will not stand for it. Its the principle of it to me. It will go right on your bill (and there have been a few sheepish grins at check-out time when a guest sees that I caught them red-handed). But if your are up front with me no problem at all.Again, nearly all of our guests are wonderful. But at the end of the day I have to lay my head on the same pillow my guests do.-FT"

4561233,Obabikon,2016-02-19 09:48:00,2370,That's a good insurance plan. I'm sure he has it figured out for what works for his place.
4561337,lama231,2016-02-19 10:08:00,29,"Believe me we are not trying to take advantage of anyone. When I hit the rocks I went straight to the owners and told them. Just the right thing to do. I still believe that i got had for the $850.00 and didnt want to put myself in the same situation.With the insurance it is a fixed expense so I can budget accordingly, not that I will be less careful with the equiptment. Eagle is a big lake with a lot of hazards, this way we can enjoy or trip without worrying where we are going to go and walking on eggs. Works much better for me."
4561969,LOW1,2016-02-19 12:19:00,2828,"Last year a friend borrowed our US registered boat in Ontario, hit a rock, and trashed the lower unit.He did not have boater's insurance but did have liability coverage under his homeowner's insurance. His insurance company required some persuasion but eventually paid the full repair cost plus the cost of renting a replacement boat.So, check your coverages. Homeowner's insurance usually has liability coverage but there may be an exclusion or a horsepower maximum.The policies I have seen do not have a ""no coverage in Canada"" exclusion but do have a ""no coverage in Mexico"" exclusion. And my personal boating insurance covers me for liability when operating or renting other's boats provided that I have been negligent. I don't think it covers me for casualty to other's boats that I am using."
4562057,Bstar,2016-02-19 12:44:00,564,One of the guys in our group got lost on Lac Seul last summer and hit a reef and tore up the lower unit on a 40 hp Honda. Camp owner told us it would cost $2800 to fix it because the shaft had snapped in the spline and the repair shop would have to pull the power head to remove it. I believe the price was padded quite a bit but what could we do? We have been to the camp several times with no problems. We paid the $2800 but we will probably not return to the camp. There are several others in the same area.
4562545,BornToFish,2016-02-19 14:56:00,1224,"One of you had a post above that suggested to me that you, as a lodge owner, take out an insurance policy for your fleet of 40/50 hp motors and their boats. I understood that a guest wrecking a lower unit for example, would pay the deductible as set forth by the policy. The insurance policy pays the balance for the repair. I understood that the lodge owner spreads the cost of this insurance policy across the guests renting boats. For example, the cost of the insurance policy for one week would be built into the cost of the cabin or boat rental. In other words, the lodge owner essentially stays cash neutral on this affair. I am not familiar with your fleet of boats or your lodges, so have no idea how many boats/motors/guests are involved in your operation. I am curious as to the approximate cost for each person/cabin/boat at your lodge for this insurance policy. For example, is the cost of this insurance $10, $25 or $50 per boat per week? I understand that this might be considered sensitive information that you may not want to put on this forum. If so, I would appreciate a reply by PM. For whatever it might be worth, I am interested in this concept of boating insurance. Others might be as well. I am not a lodge owner/operator. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4562593,Jesse-WI,2016-02-19 15:05:00,534,Alot of places do not offer the insurance because it just leads to people be less careful. The lodge either needs more motors or other guests suffer.
4562609,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-19 15:09:00,461,"I don't break down or allocate a specific cost per client. That cost, like many, many others are included into my entire financial picture. Just like any business I assume I have to pay X thousands (or tens of thousands) of dollars a year for insurance, Y dollars for food and Z for all sorts of items. That then goes into a formula for fixed costs, overhead and the like. Then revenue is compared to costs and a desired target margin is computed. Then of course exchange rates come into play, competitors rates, you name it. Lots of factors. I look at the big picture and do not get to that level of detail. I am not suggesting that owners will charge you their deductible. In my case I am running over 44 boats, a third of which are brand new 20+ thousand dollars a piece. I would be crazy to NOT have waterborne collision on those assets. If someone actually SUNK one that is a major expense, let alone blowing out a $7,000 motor. But every owner determines their own risk and costs that into their pricing accordingly. I can certainly understand that as an owner if I did not insure my boat and someone wrecked it I would be looking for them to re-pay me. But again lots of factors as you have heard including how much to repair, price of the trip, potential to lose a customer etc. Insurance for us is one of our costliest expenses. Many lodges are valued in the millions of dollars. The boat insurance is a small piece of that of course. But insurance (including business interruption insurance) is a critical component to protecting our investment and livelihood. -FTP.S. If I did break down a cost that specific and allocated it per guest I would never share that information as it is indeed sensitive."
4562673,brad34,2016-02-19 15:30:00,892,"By no means am I an expert on this matter, so please let me know if I am way off base here: If I ever trash a lower unit and am on the hook for the entire repair, I sure as heck will be demanding to see the invoice from the mechanic. I will not simply take the resort's word for it. Maybe the mechanic is ripping me off too, but there's not much I can do about that.Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-G870A using Tapatalk"
4558801,BornToFish,2016-02-18 15:06:00,1224,Two things recently happened that caused me to wonder about boating insurance while renting a fishing boat in Canada. I recently rented an automobile. My agent told me that my auto insurance policy would cover me while renting an automobile. I recently renewed my insurance policy for my personal boat. My experience when renting an auto caused me to wonder if my boat insurance policy would cover renting and operating a boat from the fishing lodges that I vacation at. My insurance agent said it would not. He said there is nothing that can be added on to my existing policy. What do you guys do (if anything) for boating insurance when renting a boat at a Canadian fishing lodge? Regards....
4558817,Juls,2016-02-18 15:19:00,13414,My guess is that the lodges that rent the boats would have to have the insurance for them...not you.
4558865,ftfarms,2016-02-18 15:36:00,444,I take my own boat now but before when we used the resorts boat some offered insurance for the week at a charge but most don't you just pay for what you damaged.
4559145,lama231,2016-02-18 17:08:00,29,WE were in Ontario last summer. as we were coming out of a channel from a portage another boat came flying by and forced us over into some rocks. The prop was damaged and as soon as we got back to camp I notified the owner. They sent us out with one of the dock hands to check it out and he said that it was fine and he would straighten out the prop for us and we should be OK. Now bear in mind even with the bent prop there was no vibration or any issue with the motor. Low and behold the next morning the boat was taken out of the water and sent to their expert to be checked out. wouldnt you know it but they said the motor had a bent shaft. Now I m no expert but a bent shaft should have caused some sort of vibration at some speed and this did not. Well since we were in another country and with not a lot of options I paid the $850.00. I am not saying that all resorts are the same but this particular one is now out of business and I will not book a resort that doesnt offer boat insurance. too much can go wrong and once you are there you are at their mercy. Boat insurance is a small price to pay to insure a trouble free experience.
4559593,Obabikon,2016-02-18 19:00:00,2370,"Every resort is different. Personally, we never charge for props. I tried to do an ""insurance"" option (where we just ran it), but that took quite a bit of accounting. So, now if you bang a rock hard enough to wreck a lower unit... there's a $300 fee. I cover the rest (usually runs around $1,100). I expect to wrecked lower units per year, and I work that into my charge. Two years ago, we only had one... so I took the extra $800 and purchased GPS units for some of our boats. Last year, we only lost one also... I was able to buy enough GPS units for all our boats. Now that all boats are equipped with colored units with the lake map on them... I feel that things we can expect fewer and fewer accidents. As far as actual insurance companies go... it become incredibly expensive to insure 18 boats and motors. They are insured from theft only."
4559849,kriplur,2016-02-18 20:33:00,37,Our group would not consider booking a trip to a resort using camp boats and motors unless they offered insurance on equipment. I sure don't want to be on the hook for big $$$ for taking out a lower unit. Accidents happen and insurance is a small price to pay for eliminating a huge problem.
4559969,lama231,2016-02-18 21:18:00,29,Oba I am sure you are an honorable guy and I respect how you run your camp but I am not going to put myself in that situation again. As you can see I reached out to the people on Walleye Central to help choose a spot for this summer. After all the great replies what really kicked us over the edge was the availability of insurance on the boat and motor. We have booked Stanley's Resort on the West Arm of Eagle Lake. Looks like a first rate operation and we hope we made the right choice
4560441,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-19 06:16:00,461,"We do not offer insurance either as the paperwork can be a real pain. We do however charge for props ($150) and all other damage. Have only lost one lower unit in 5 years. That being said all of my larger boats (with 50s) I personally insure. So if someone blows one out the most they are out is my deductible, not 3 grand. We are on a very deep lake with few hazards so damage is rare. And blowing out a lower end on our out-lakes in an 8hp is pretty much unheard of."
4560713,Obabikon,2016-02-19 07:49:00,2370,"I don't blame you one bit. Everyone is looking for something different. With insurance, I'm sure there's still a deductible. I'm not sure what Stanley's charges, but if there isn't one, there is less incentive for people to be careful. It is probably around the same amount as I charge ($300). I'm always happy to put my ""rules"" in writing... but my guests for the most part have faith that I do what I say I'll do. Trust is a big deal to me, and I do my best to not let anyone's trip be ruined because of an accident. If you upset a guest, you lose a lot more than a few hundred dollars. You could lose the entire group. I would much rather EAT the cost of a lower unit ($1000 or so) than lose a group of 5 or 6 who come every year (thousands and thousands). Just good business. It isn't surprising that the guy is out of business after charging you like that."
4560841,Duflebag,2016-02-19 08:17:00,218,"Lama, You have picked an excellent and well run camp at Stanleys. I have known Rob for over 30 years and while i don't go to his camp i think it is a great place. You will have a great time in a camp that is really well kept and has great fishing in the West Arm and access to all other areas of Eagle Lake."
