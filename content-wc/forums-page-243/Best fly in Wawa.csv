4556185,Erie Ranger620,2016-02-17 18:10:00,74,Looking to take wife and kids on a second trip. Wawa area flyin that offers good American plan and a really good boat cost is not the deciding factor just the best. Cabins that offer some privacy and a nice view. Not worried about the fishing as much as the family having nice areas to swim and a nice falls/rapids for viewing and good areas for shore lunch

4556273,Mike Borger,2016-02-17 18:36:00,1554,"American plan in the Wawa region. That's easy Lodge 88. Was there last summer with my family and they loved it. Amazing facilities, boats and food. Fishing was pretty good too. You can also train in to this lodge to keep the costs down.http://www.northtoadventure.com/view...&page=l88_homeMy story:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...-eighty-eight/"

There are probably a few more that would likely be able to arrange transportation from White River as well.Wawahttp://www.fishthefinest.com/http://brunswicklakelodge.com/Hawk Junctionhttp://www.esnagi.com/index.htmlWhite Riverhttp://www.marmaclodge.com/http://www.northtoadventure.com/view...&page=l88_homehttp://www.kabyswildernessvacations.ca/http://www.kabykabins.ca/kaby/Welcome.htmlhttp://www.pkresort.com/Of these, I think Kaby Kabins has the nicest boats. However, I've never fished out of the 18ft cedar boats before, but I hear they are fairly nice to fish from. Also, Marmac and Lodge 88 also have some upgrade boat options."

Every time I've been its been nothing but great. Very clean accomadations, great food, great fishing, great boats and motors,you get the idea. Lots of fish caught on every trip but not the biggest. We usually go in August so it's not prime time for big fish. Walleye, pike and smallmouth."

4558881,norml,2016-02-18 15:37:00,1,"Our group bumped into Denis when another outfitter advertised something he wasn't. He took our group on at the last minute and flew us into his private paradise.His camp is immaculate. All his facilities are top notch boats ,motors, cabins you name it.The place is great for ""the boys"" and familys alike. The fishing has always been spectacular. We are going on our 6th year and still find new fishing spots. Plan on gaining a few pounds with Vals desserts."
