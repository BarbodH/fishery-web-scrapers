4539417,prov1800,2016-02-12 10:14:00,5010,Having been guiding for most of the last 30 years iam kinda wondering what kind of experiences any of you guys have had.Most posts are geared toward camps.But that being said if it wasnt for guides giving up there honey hokes and camp owners marking those spots on guests maps these days fishing would be a heck of a lot different for a lot of fisherman.
4539585,MrSimon,2016-02-12 11:40:00,922,"I grew up fishing Canadian shield lakes so I've never even considered hiring a guide. Heck, I don't think I've even fished a lake in Canada that has professional guides. I think it's fine that they exist and I'm sure they help lots of people find and catch fish. It just isn't on my radar."
4539857,prov1800,2016-02-12 13:11:00,5010,"Iam glad to hear you are such a proficient fisherman.iam lucky like you who got to fish canada at a early age.Alot of fisherman visiting Canada didnt have that luxury and come one or maybe two weeks to fish.Some like a head start and learn a few places from a guide rather than bad week.I myself when i travell hire guides.Not sure where you fish, but in my area there are lots of guides and very busy."
4540017,rzep,2016-02-12 14:24:00,1196,"My wife likes to fish but it is not very ""efficient"" with baiting hooks, untangling knots, getting snags free etc. So each time we go fishing, to save myself time and nerves, I get a guide so he can deal with all the ""issues"". Of course, having someone cook a shore lunch and clean fish is nice as well."
4540121,Bakefish,2016-02-12 14:56:00,1077,"In the 40 years I've been fishing Canada I've gotten a guide 4 times. All 4 times it was because of new water.First time we had an old guy that thought he had some newbs in the boat and was a bit reserved at first. While fishing for walleye I had a perch hitting my jig and told him so. He wasn't sure if he should believe me until I hooked it and brought it in. Then he knew that he didn't have to babysit us and started to open up. He was great. Story after story. Had us in stitches.Second time we got a middle aged guy that knew his stuff. We told him we didn't care if we caught fish, just wanted to mark some spots for the remainder of the week. We took my boat and he showed us plenty of spots. Not the best personality in the world, but definitely worth the money.Third time was at an Ontario lake called Lake Despair. We got a guide who was a local bass tournament fisherman. Unfortunately a vicious front passed through bringing northeast winds, rain, and a 30 degree temperature swing. We knew what we were in store for. We told him we knew it would be a bad day and to just take us around and show us some spots in my boat. Well that guy went above and beyond the call of duty. We fished our butts off that day with not much return. However, he did show us many spots that we marked on the GPS. He even showed us his secret spots that he never showed to clients. Back at the cabin when he brought us our cleaned fish we passed him a wad of cash as a tip. He refused the tip, saying he didn't do us right in the fish department. We argued with that guy for 10 minutes, but he wouldn't budge. The remainder of the trip we were the talk of the camp because fishing was tough and that front wouldn't let go, but we started catching fish and no one else was doing much good. His secret spots were the ticket. I wish I remembered his name because he was special.The last guide we got was just a kid, from Chicago no less. He had some spots, but nothing special. Not many stories, not much knowledge and mediocre at best. He didn't even cook us a very good shore lunch.So there you have it, my experiences with guides."
4540265,turtle chain,2016-02-12 16:06:00,1398,"We fished lac Suel many years ago out of lost Island lodge 3 trips we hired there guides 3 times.We learned alot and had a ton of fun.Shane basil and the boy's treated us like kings,If we ever go back we would hire the guide again"
4540385,emma17,2016-02-12 17:04:00,436,"My sons and I started our Ontario fishing habit 6 years ago. We've been to 5 camps and have hired a guide at 4 of them, and took full advantage of the camp provided fishing assistant (Witch Bay)at the 5th. Our first guide experience was our worst guide experience. A guy in the worst of moods with every outward sign that he'd had a heck of a wild night. Angry about taking my boat and angry about miscommunication from the camp. My kids still tease about how he showed us the Canadian method of hooking a minnow for jigging: ""Ok, I'm going to show you this one time and one time only"". The fact that I forget to put the plug in the boat didn't make his morning any better. Our other experiences were all good for various reasons. Shore lunch is a huge part of our enjoyment with the Guide. Pulling spinners was a new method we learned and really enjoyed (we normally fish in northern WI in a county where trolling wasn't allowed until last year). We had an ol timer guide on Minnitaki that enthralled the kids with good stories. We had a great guide out of Obabikon that put the kids on big fish- calling out the bite before it happened- kids dig that stuff.I'm probably wrong about this, but the least value I get from a guide is Musky fishing. Keep in mind, I've never caught one, so it might have a little something to do with me. I find that Musky fishing spots all seem pretty obvious. I get the importance of the ol figure 8. Aside from these two things, I don't think I've benefited from a Musky guide. Walleye guides have put me in spots that I just didn't think had any reason to produce. Ultimately, like most- the way I figure it is if I'm on new water, I want to maximize my four days of fishing, and a guide helps do that. Perhaps if I stayed a week I'd go without."
4540873,BornToFish,2016-02-12 19:38:00,1224,"I've become a fairly good friend of several of the guides at a lodge that I regularly fish from each summer. They pass on information to me, just a I pass information on to them. We often share spots while fishing. I sometimes leave when they pull up to a spot that I am fishing, so they can enjoy the spot with their guests. One common mistake that I see many guests make when they hire a guide is to focus on the ""spots"" that the guide takes them to rather than HOW to fish the spot. They focus on location of the ""hot spots"" rather than on what the guide is teaching them, for example, in terms of fishing techniques and boat control. Thus, some of the guides that I know don't get to preoccupied with showing ""spots"" or having lodge owners mark up maps. Guests will go to these ""hot spots"" the next day and struggle since they weren't paying attention to the important things the guides were teaching! Before too long they give up on those spots and do something else that will show them fish. I freely give out information at the dock to other anglers at the dock. The guides often come to the dock at night and also talk about fishing to help guests. Honestly, the information doesn't help that many guests as they typically don't know how to successfully fish the spot. I learned long ago that fishing equipment, techniques, strategies and boat control are critically important to my fishing success. Once these consideration are mastered, they can be applied to dozens of spots around the lake. Spots are easy to learn. Anglers can learn spots by asking questions of other knowledgeable anglers, paying attention as they boat about the lake, listening at the dock, studying a map, asking the lodge owner, etc.. In my opinion, mastering techniques and boat control almost always requires a good teacher - for example, a good guide! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4556377,WallyWarrior,2016-02-17 19:06:00,2488,"Just had an ice fishing guide in January that forgot the 4th chair so I got to sit on a bucket the whole first day. Halfway through the day, bucket full. Got to turn it over and sit on open end of bucket the rest of the day. Day 2, guess what, no **** chair again. This time I only got to sit on the bucket for around 4 hrs before he located a metal chair for me. Just telling the story makes me laugh. Fishing was alright, but come on, a day and half sitting on a bucket when you are less than ten minutes from town. I ain't asking for an ice palace, lol. I take friends ice fishing all the time and always ensure I have everything they will need for the day. It's pretty simple. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
4556793,prov1800,2016-02-17 20:18:00,5010,Where was the guide sitting.think maybe hed give up his seat.Or did he drop you of at a hut.
4556817,WallyWarrior,2016-02-17 20:22:00,2488,"He was in and out checking on other clients. I laughed off the situation as it was, but may have been pissed if he had a chair. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
4557593,Coyoteman,2016-02-18 07:52:00,209,The only trips I have had a guide have been trips my suppliers have taken me on. Some of these have been return trips with the same ones. I have seen everything from the good to the bad. Would I ever hire one on my own? No
4554481,v-bay gord,2016-02-17 07:40:00,3168,That's the downside of staying at a large resort I suppose.....at least it would be for me.
4554505,SinOrSwim,2016-02-17 07:42:00,1528,"That isn't necessarily true. We flew in for many many years. We have hired guides a couple times on Lac Seul. It's a BIG body of water vs where we flew in. If you only have 4 days to spend fishing, why mess around trying to learn it all in 4 days? Hire a guide and change your learning curve. Or, if you just want a day of being pampered of sorts. Having someone drive the boat and you just ""fish"", someone with bait, someone to do shorelunch and clean the fish. Not that we can't do that. But, it's nice sometimes for someone else to do it. I like driving the boat but there are times when boat control takes a ton of time and effort. It's nice sitting in front once in awhile and doing nothing but fish.We had a guides a couple times when I took my son to Hawk Lake. I have to say last year the guy we had was amazing. We didn't have good luck fishing but it was honestly one of the most enjoyable days I've ever had on the water. We talked concepts, we changed spots over and over and he explained what he was looking for, he talked to my son about loons and trees. He let my son drive the boat AND park the boat on the way in. Little facts, like how a certain pine tree is designed to reproduce based on fire. The pine needles fall as a V and get caught. Thus givng dry needled to burn. That burning will open the pine cone to release the seed. Point being, yes they are different. But, even though we had a guide, we still had solitude. Very similar to any of the fly ins I've been on."
4554569,Thompmd,2016-02-17 07:55:00,320,"Very well put, its a learning curve. Guides like you described on Hawk Lake are what we all desire and its true that each of us has different expectations of our trip.I have hired both bass & walleye guides over the years and all were a good time and some were a great time. Some thought that w/o them I couldn't possibly find more than a couple fish a day and some as you described tried to teach/explain. Some positioned the boat so that it was difficult for the clients(us) to fish and thus caught many more fish. Yes it was windy and boat control/position are typically critical for a ton of reasons but I think that its ok for the guide to catch a couple fish in those situations to verify the fish are there but then should have quit fishing and allowed the clients to fish(yes we did hint a few times but stopped short of saying just that).I have always thought that the best guides and camp owners are the ones that learn their customers just as they do where/how/why to run a camp or be a guide. At least in our case its not always about the total number of fish. That being said I will definitely hire guide(s) again and I very much appreciate what services both provide. It takes all 3 of us to make each trip the most successful it can be."
4554801,MrSimon,2016-02-17 09:21:00,922,"Like I said, not wrong, just different. Being pampered on a fishing trip to me means having electric start on the motor. And to me, solitude means not having a stranger in my boat."
4554857,prov1800,2016-02-17 09:34:00,5010,"Really dont see the downside to that at all, its all very well organized and all the guests have a blast.some just relax in the shade some cast from shore.They get a great meal they have been waiting for all year long.Looks pretty neat seeing all the guide boat tied up on shore.After lunch we have a hour or so to catch some more fish.Then its back to camp and the guests can go to the bar and have a nice cool one.Sounds like a fine day to me.At times if guys want we take some out after supper."
4555129,Daveygravy,2016-02-17 11:01:00,88,"Back in the nineties I guided for a couple of summers one was in northern Canada and the other was Alaska. What I realized was that when it became my job I began to dislike fishing. I fish and hunt to relax and get away from stress and I thought being a guide would be like a vacation that you get paid for. Wrong , guides work their butt off and some people are very cheap. I think an important question to a guide should be What methods are working and how do you like to fish? This is important to me because I like to fish artificials and if I have to troll or drag bait around I would fish for another species. That's why I like fly ins. If I was going to a big lake like low I would hire a guide."
4555201,prov1800,2016-02-17 11:33:00,5010,After many years guiding its still not a job to me.Love what i do.But love my days off so i can fish my favouritelake which isnt the fastest but peacefull and she puts out great fish with some patience.I do take guests there a long as there prepared for a slower day.
4555793,Old Timer,2016-02-17 16:05:00,255,"My favorite Canadian walleye lake is a remote boat-in/ portage program north of Savant. I thought I knew the lake well until the camp owner suggested that for fun I might hire a native gentleman who lived with his family in a tent during the summer months on an island down the way on the main lake. I did just that, and made the arrangements with this man's wife as he spoke no English. The next day I picked him up at the island and turned over the tiller. We had exceptional day of fishing and at spots I would never think of trying. I often think of that day and pinch myself every once in a while when recalling that I stepped out of my norm and hired someone else. I don't recall the cost, but it was nominal in light of the fishing we had.Looking back over my many years of fishing Canada I wish I would have shelved my pride more frequently and hired someone who knew the lake better than me. From the few times I've hired a guide I've always learned more than what I paid for."
4556145,fishron,2016-02-17 17:58:00,317,"My experience with guides is limited, choosing to go it on our own in most situations. That being said we have had some interesting times when we have felt the need on new water to use a guide. One experience, on a lake we had no knowledge of was quite unique. It was a fly-in and a wild lake where the fish were aggressive. Our guide did not permit us to fish much beyond the prop wash. He didn't want to deal with snagged lures. Amazingly the walleye on that lake would hit the lures in the prop wash, (erie dearies with a worm), regardless. It was a memorable day but the one thing that stood out about this particular guide. He could not form a sentence that did not use the ""F"" word to save his soul. Each to his own, I'm not judging the guide, he did what we hired him to do and we had a good day."

Just simply........hey, I looked and looked and couldn't find that hump. Reply: what!? it's not hard. Just line yourself up with the point and the 2 humps on west horizon...........It's really not hard to find. Maybe you weren't in the right area. LOL Those **** easy to find humps..........UNDER WATER!!!!"

4552889,prov1800,2016-02-16 15:13:00,5010,"Dont get all defensive gord.the point of the thread was what people thought of there guides.I been guiding many years and dont ever recall anybody showing me nothing.Ive always gone looking for my own places to fish.Everycamp has its camp spots and those camp spots are the spots every camp in the area will put on your map.you know just as well as i do that if some guy leaves your dock on eagle without any info from you two things will possibly three.First one is hes going to have very slow day, two they mighg find a rock and three they might get lost even with a map along.All iam getting at is hirign a guide just isn't a bad idea.Good guides will also show people the right techniques for diff seasons, etc.just like lacseulguide mentioned.I fish alot of lakes probably more than most and have a lot of time invested in these lakes."
4553161,Obabikon,2016-02-16 16:18:00,2370,The idea behind honey holes (in my opinion) is a silly one... except with crappie fishing. A guide provides a ton of service aside from spots. How you fish the spot is often as important as the spot itself. Also... spots on a map don't relate to fish patterns. One week the walleye are on 10 foot humps and the next they're on 16 foot points.... it is constantly changing!
4553193,v-bay gord,2016-02-16 16:27:00,3168,"You are getting older, and your memory probably isn't what it once was. Defensive? I'm just an old bassturd..........and yes, I agree a good guide can be an important resource for guests, and for lodge owners....but in my case I like to mark spots that don't get a lot of traffic .......and I like the guest to contribute some initiative on their own."
4553297,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-16 17:01:00,8293,For me personally on a Canadian trip I wouldn't use a guide unless I intended to return to the same camp year after year. Then a guide would be helpful learning the lake. That said I would never return to a camp whose owner didn't mark up a map for me my first day.
4553569,prov1800,2016-02-16 18:24:00,5010,Agreed gord.
4553697,SeulAreaWalleye,2016-02-16 19:19:00,100,"After many years of cooking 2 hrs lunches in a traditional way for clients, I now carry the equipment to make this process said and done in under an hour. Most of my trips only have shorelunch for a one or two days, then just bring a box lunch to fish more. Sometimes we make burgers instead bbqed on a open fire with a stand up grill, add a batch of fire fries and this is a hit every time. Sometimes I serve baked fish out there. Realistically there isn't much that you can't prepare over an open flame and variety at lunch is very popular with most of my regular returns. I usually give each crew the menu options on the first day, and plan the lunches for each day in advance. I also say ""traditional"" or ""modern style"" lunch. Most pick modern, 50 btu burner propane and fast shorelunch but some just want the whole experience...again we are here to provide the style of trip that the client wants each time. 99% of walleye clients have at least one shorelunch. 99% of musky clients will always bring a box lunch!!"
4553945,prov1800,2016-02-16 20:37:00,5010,When i guide at the big camps on eagle they have corperate parties we take out and can have upwards of 40 guests and 10 guides those shorelunches pretty much take the afternoon.lol.when thexweather is bad we come back to camp and cook under a roof and normally we feed the whole camp then as most of the guests that are on their own also have come back.Then everyone is invited to eat provided there is enough to go around according to fish limits.These are times folks remember for sure.
4554337,MrSimon,2016-02-17 06:50:00,922,"I'm getting the impression that fishing on these big, popular bodies of water that have large resorts and lots of camps is a WHOLE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE than fishing on fly-in lakes and remote lakes with outpost camps only. It seems that the type of people who go to those resorts and hire guides are a lot different than the guys I'm used to fishing with. Not wrong, just different."
4542785,Obabikon,2016-02-13 14:09:00,2370,"Good guides are hard to find, and worth their weight in gold! Anyone who is willing to work outside in the ""service"" industry for a living is borderline saint in my opinion. I also want to point out that I said ""good guides"". With fewer and fewer people choosing the profession, the professionals are getting harder and harder to come by. Guides put smiles on their faces through a lot of comments that would make the average person's skin crawl. One experience with a group from a Southern state. The group at check out had nothing but great things to say about their experience, service, and especially the guide. The next day (after four days fishing with them) the guide (who I've known all my life, love like a brother, and happens to be native) basically said... ""hey, if these guys come back next year, is there any chance you could give them to someone else? Not a big deal, i just dont' think I can take them out again"". I of course dug through to find out what had happened. The group had spent the past four days using every single offensive racial slur out in the boat. Some of the things they said would have made slave owners shake their heads. It was BAD."

I've been contacted about a fishing guide position this year,, on a lake I've wanted too fish for a long time.. I'm considering it,, but I'm not sure I could do 4 months of it..

4547537,SeulAreaWalleye,2016-02-15 08:02:00,100,"I have been guiding in the Sioux Lookout area for around 22 yrs, and have been nonstop booked that whole time. I have only met two bad crews, one group many years ago were so ignorant and rude that I tricked them into spending a few hours on an island as I drove home, and sent them a ride. They were kicked out of the camp they were staying at from there as well. The other group I just fired after a few hrs in the boat...some people are just special!!Everybody else I've met have been great folks that are just out to have a good trip. I work extra hard to ensure they produce well and have many yearly returns because of that. I have many clients that are more than capable and experienced to do the guiding on their own....but they don't. In my views the importance of the guide is to ensure that all guests along are catching well, having a fun, safe trip and not doing any of the work involved in making a great day out there. Nearly every group that I take returns for more, and rebooks myself at the same time. For guides out there that want to do well, remember this is the service industry and you are there to make sure the client is on vacation!!! I net every fish, tie every lure, bait every hook and take care of all well. Run the gunnels and I'm exhausted at the end of each day but it's well worth my while. Tough job, and there are not many young people getting into this job now as the pay is low and it actually involves hard work...especially at shore lunches or in bad weather. Longs days, nonstop customer interaction and high expectations with horrible backlash if you don't produce well. I personally cannot find any young people to train, and when I do they are terrible at the job, or just don't last long when they realize that's it's work. It's almost a good thing that not everyone takes along a guide because there truly is a shortage out there of good guides available!!"
4547945,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-15 09:56:00,8293,"Good info. Do you find your new clients EXPECT certain things? Like do they expect you to tie the lures, bait the hooks, net the fish? Just wondering because for me those aren't things I would expect but can see where if it was a once in a life time trip it would be nice. Another thing that baffles me is the shore lunch thing. I can see it once on a week long trip, but daily it just seems it would involve to much time. What does it take maybe 2 hours for a shore lunch? Whatever you are doing you are doing right. Keep up the great service."
4548073,LOW1,2016-02-15 10:15:00,2828,"The guides that I have hired sound like this one and have always been a pleasure. Especially when dealing with kids, which requires great patience.With the lower value of the Cdn$ this summer would be ideal to hire a guide for anyone who hasn't used one. But book early - they will fill up.You would think that there would be more guides available. I guess with only a 15 week long season and the expenses it doesn't pay as well as you think, even at $500 a day or so. Many guide hunts and ice fishing trips, but that may not add up to a full time job.If you find one you like, treat them well."

If 'honey holes"" were all it took to make a good guide, and the ability of a camp operator to ""mark a map"" was all it took to make a good operator, we would have a lot more competition. The concept that a guide has discovered all the ""honey holes"" on the lake ignores the fact that other people have been there first and likely passed on this information. The idea that the camp owner is stealing these from the guide ignores the fact that they may have fishing knowledge too. What you do when you get to these ""honey holes"" is what separates a good guide from someone who likes to go for boat rides. Marking a map, and providing some information on how to fish those spots, separates the lodge owner that wants you to have a great day from the one who just wants you out of his hair for the day."

4541609,jkaup,2016-02-13 06:34:00,56,"Good thread going here! I've only fished fly-ins so a guide is not in my plans. I'm thinking there is a minimum of 3 days if you hire a guide and the price gets up there. Our first trip to Canada we fished 2 and a half days and only lucked up and caught 3 fish. I had no idea what to do to catch a walleye! We charted fish in at least 4 spots that just covered the screen. My crack-head technique was not working...trolling too fast, not enough weight and not enough line out. So when the camp owner came in for a check flight he took us out and had us on 3 good spots within an hour! Showed us how to ditch the plastic and hook a minnow, how to search for fish with a cast toward the bank and jig it back. How to back troll and keep your jig on the bottom. All priceless information. IF we had a guide we would have been on the fish within minutes of the plane landing. We felt the gamut of emotions those first days as we struck out and ate tacos instead of walleye! I think we were much more grateful for the help after we had to tough it out for a bit. So, get a guide? Yes, but try it on your own for at least a day first. You may surprise yourself and lay into them."

At the same time, I've shown up with a bass pro shops catalog of gear to learn that a homemade worm harness catches the fish. As fisherman, we spend countless hours figuring out spots and what works to catch fish. To give out that info daily is truly unselfish, even if your paid to do so. I'd like to thank all the guides out there who do it for the love of fishing."
