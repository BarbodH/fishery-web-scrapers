4460129,adempsey,2016-01-17 11:04:00,963,"Thanks Pooch, that's interesting. Too bad about the Haggland. I tried to determine if Savant had a remote tourism designation, but trying to navigate the government websites and documents is a real challenge."
4460441,prov1800,2016-01-17 12:50:00,5010,I would recommed having a look at clarkes norther lights resort.Fishin is about as good as your going to find anywhere and has multispecies in it.Acces to perrault lake also.Grwat camp boats and free bait.Crappies as bonus fish.

4467826,adempsey,2016-01-19 14:46:00,963,"Just by coincidence I discovered that there is a third outpost on Savant lake located on Turtle Island - Turtle Island Outpost. Primarily a fly-in, but they can arrange to get in by foot or ATV and then boat to the island."
4467962,Pooch,2016-01-19 16:00:00,4619,"That's interesting. I had heard there was an outpost somewhere in the far north end of Savant, but have never been able to find information on it. I always thought it might be part of Cliff & Roma's operation. Maybe someone will know more about it and speak up.Thanks,Pooch"
4468618,pale ryder,2016-01-19 19:50:00,1937,"X2 on Clark's Northern lights, they run a great camp at a good value, and Cedar is a very good lake. Cedar is big enough that you don't have to keep fishing the same spots, but small enough that wind is seldom a problem.The fishing is very good but not so easy as to take the challenge out of it. Walleye, SMB, Muskie, Crappie, and some Pike."
4468634,Mike Borger,2016-01-19 20:08:00,1554,"Can't believe you unearthed that, very cool! Not sure who'd be willing or able to hike 6 miles in to the lake with gear though. I think I'd just fly in LOL!There's half a dozen Ontario lakes high on my hit list and Savant is one of them."
4468642,prov1800,2016-01-19 20:09:00,5010,spring is around the corner.lake just froze up a couple of weeks ago.crazy.
4546353,Hunts1,2016-02-14 18:35:00,123,"We have used Lac Seul Outpost in Chamberlain Narrows on Lac Seul. It is a great camp run by great people. The cabins are very nice and the service is excellent. This is a boat in facility with numerous cabins in one of the greatest fisheries in Ontario. You boat in for about 30 miles from Sioux Lookout Ontario. They will meet you at the dock in Sioux Lookout and take you and all of your gear and guide you in. If you have your own boats you could follow them or if experienced go on your own. The walleye, smallmouth, and pike fishing is some of the best I have ever experienced. Muskie fishing is the best as well . You can bring your own boats or rent theirs. Once there you are on your own however they are set up very well to provide you minnows and some basic staples. The cabins are very clean and great for our group. For years we had done a fly in trip to Ontario but discovered this seven or eight years ago and love it. Ken and Brenda have a great camp and the fishing is incredible. You will not be disappointed. My biggest concern recommending them is that they will be full and I may lose an opportunity to go! I caught a 28 inch walleye off their dock last June. We have caught numerous 30+ inch Pike off the dock as well. We always catch huge numbers of fish and many large ones as well. I have been going to Ontario for the past 25 years at multiple lakes and with multiple outfitters and by far we are most satisfied with Lac Seul Outpost.You can stay within sight of camp and have some of the most spectacular fishing you have ever had in your life. Or you can travel up to 20 miles if you'd like to explore. There are plenty of islands and narrow areas to get out of the wind and weather should it arise.With the exchange rate at a very favorable level right now this is a very reasonable option to some of the other camps.Highly recommend them."

4455585,adempsey,2016-01-15 19:11:00,963,"I tried really hard to get info on Cat Track and Cliff & Roma's. The only information I could find was from the Rusty Myers website. Savant is a relatively big lake at 31,000 acres. I am not sure how accessible it is from the highway, but I don't think very. Definitely be interesting place to fish."
4457241,packpro,2016-01-16 13:25:00,695,"North Star Lodge. Very close to Dryden. Total drive for is about about 45 min from Dryden. Last 7 miles down a dirt gravel road. Only resort on the lake. Camp hold about 70. There is enough water and spots, you don't have to see another boat unless you want to. Clean cabins, with modern with kitchens/baths. Power available on the large docks. Great owners who will put you in fish. I have only fished there once and it was a great experience. I would go back in a minute. There is another camp with a dock that is 17 miles up river. Not much crossover from one area to the other, as you would drive by great fishing just to get to great fishing. The two camps are owned by the same family. We fished the "" goon"" one year, but our experience at North Star was infinitely better. Walleye, large pike, perch, smallmouth all available. Lots of water, and lots of spots, so your never crowded out."
4458345,rather-be-fishin,2016-01-16 19:57:00,429,"Not sure what you mean by ""Big"" Walleyes, but we have been fishing the NW end of Lac Seul just South of Ear Falls for 12 years. It is a very large lake with many areas to fish. The walleye fishing is awesome for numbers & size! The average size fat walleye we catch are 20-26"". We have caught several 27 1/2"", 28s 29 & a 32"". The slot is 18-21"" & resorts encourage all walleye over 18"" be released. It becomes a challenge to catch small enough fish to keep & eat because they are all too big! There are also large northern pike to catch too. There are several good drive to resorts on this area of the lake. Lac Seul Lodge, Onaway Resort, Fisherman's Cove, Evergreen Resort, Goose Bay Resort, Whitewing Resort, Gawley's Resort, CherRob Resort, Timberlane Resort & Gold Pines Resort. Check them out & good luck planning your next trip! 6 months to go and the count down is on to our return trip to Lac Seul! üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏èüé£ RBF"
4458489,adempsey,2016-01-16 20:57:00,963,"With the exception of the Great Lakes/Bay of Quinte, that's as good as it gets for trophy Walleye fishing in Ontario."
4459265,WalleyeWally28,2016-01-17 07:34:00,298,Agree. We have been fishing this area for the past 19 years and have 3 trips booked for next summer. We fish out of Whitewing Resort. Check it out.www.whitewingresort.com
4459393,Pooch,2016-01-17 07:56:00,4619,"Actually Lake Savant is 90,000 plus acres of very interesting fishery. Without a doubt probably my favorite. Even over Lac Seul. Mostly because of the ease of fishing Savant. Fish size is comparable. Numbers are better on LS and the shot of an over 30"" walleye are better on LS. The average sized walleye is larger on Lake Savant though. It's a pounds of fish vs numbers of fish per day thing.Cliff & Roma's and Cat Track seem to be word of mouth. There is no road access into Lake Savant. The closest to that is by using Wildewoods camp. They have a small parking lot just off the highway and pick up their customers at the parking lot in a special build Ford van and trailer for the ride to camp. It's not an easy ride and the five plus mile ride takes an hour or so. They are using an old camp access trail that is marginal even for an ATV. Wildewood used to use a Hagland tracked vehicle, but wore it out and parts scarcity was a problem. Also, getting someone half qualified to fix it was also a problem. The Ford van should be easier to maintain and get parts for, but I can't imagine it lasting many years. Long ago when the camp was a church camp and the last owner and his brother bought it, they brought guests in via the trail using farm type hayracks and pulling it with an old Detroit diesel log skidder. I've seen pictures of the setup and it looked pretty rough to me.Try searching ""Troy and Penny's bait shop"" in Savant Lake (town and mailing address). I think Troy is Cliff's son and both Cat Track and Cliff & Roma's are owned by their families and located next to each other in a fairly protected bay.All these camps are priced about the same. Two are Flyin and one is trail in.I'm told that the MNR will not anyone anyone access the lake other than camp trails, air or Wildewoods limited use trail. Other camps surely have winter roads and can perhaps access their camps via ATV sometimes in the summer months. I don't know any of that for fact though. Just an assumption on my part. You really need to talk to the camp owners themselves.Pooch"

We have been looking around the dryden area, but really we are just trying to find a great walleye lake with big fish. We don't need a five start resort, guys on a budget. Any help would be greatly appreciated thanks"
4454409,bigwalleye1,2016-01-15 12:07:00,2632,"Lac Seul, Abrams, Pelican, Minnitaki are only a short jaunt up 72 from Dryden. Everything you'd want in that chain. Hate to say it, but going as far as Dryden and not going the rest of the way is like driving across the country to see the Grand Canyon, and stopping at the last gas station and turning around and going home....."

Last trip, about 10 years ago, 5 of the 8 of us qualified for Master Angler Awards during the week we were there. Walleyes 22"" and over must be released. The drive-to lodge, which has changed hands since we were there, is http://www.wekuskofallslodge.com/ If you decide you are interested, you can get back to me for more info. [email protected] There are a number of very good places closer, but this place seemed to stand out for consistent large fish. We went there 3 or 4 times before gas prices went haywire. Bill"

4454841,Pooch,2016-01-15 14:55:00,4619,"If you've been fishing around Pickle then you drove by some really good fishing to get there. We have fished Lake Savant for years and it is an excellent fishery. Walleye, Pike and Lake Trout. See my photo album for a few Lake Savant pictures. Three camps on lake. Wildewood on Lake Savant, Cliff & Roma's and Cat Track. Wildewood has a website. The other two, not sure how to contact them. Someone on this board will know. Wildewood is a trail in from the road in their vehicle. Other two are a very brief flight in. All are good camps with great people running them. We stay at Wildewood and are fat dumd and happy there. Cliff from Cliff & Roma's is the king of the lake and catches Lake Trout like you and I breath. There will be a lot of choices in all price ranges, but it is going to be harder to get your dates as the booking season is well under way and many solid drive in camps are booked all summer by now. Pooch"
4454929,BornToFish,2016-01-15 15:15:00,1224,"Let me say first that I am not an owner/operator of Stormer Lake Lodge. I was a guest at the Lodge last year. The Lodge was closed several years and then reopened in 2015.Stormer Lake Lodge is the only fishing lodge on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes. As the Lodge's name suggests, the Lodge is located on Stormer Lake, a ""small"" lake by Canada standards. It is connected to Kirkness Lake via an easily navigable river. I would rate Kirkness Lake as a ""medium"" size lake by Canada standards.There is another ""camp"" on Stormer Lake. Stormer Lake Lodge and the other ""camp"" are separated by a point of land, such that one camp cannot be seen from the other. The other ""camp"" is owned by local natives. I understand that this camp was mostly abandoned last year. There is also a private cabin on Kirkness Lake that I believe is primarily used by moose hunters. I never saw a boat from either the ""camp"" or the private cabin on the lakes.Stormer Lake Lodge has six ""cabins"" and three ""apartments"". I'm guessing they can accommodate about 25-30 guests. The Lodge has twelve boats at their dock - all 17.5 foot boats (Lunds or G3) with 40/50 HP four stroke motors. Stormer Lake Lodge is American Plan only.I hope the above information is helpful. Send me a PM if you want to discuss further off-line.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4454945,ftfarms,2016-01-15 15:33:00,444,"If your on a budget and wanting some bigger walleye why not try the west side of rainy lake. Alot of big walleye caught in that area. I would fish lake of the woods out of morson myself. Go to one of the island resorts. Tamark island or rex toltons milesbay camp. Last year we seen 4 walleyes over 30"" caught the week we was there."
