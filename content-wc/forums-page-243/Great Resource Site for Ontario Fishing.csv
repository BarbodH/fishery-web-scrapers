4561633,Carnhzkr,2016-02-19 11:13:00,964,"You are correct, lineonfishing.com is a terrific site. It's operated by adempsy who is a regular contributor on Walleye Central and freely provides a wealth of knowledge and information. I always appreciate his lists of outfitters that match whatever criteria is being asked for. These are always a great starting point for an hour or two of clicking through the internet and daydreaming about my next trip north."

4562569,adempsey,2016-02-19 15:03:00,963,"Thanks! I am glad you find the site of some use . It currently only contains a directory of those outfitters that offer fly-in outpost camps. Some operate lodges too of course, but there are many lodges not listed.It's always been my intention to add all fly-in and boat-to lodges, but I just haven't got there yet. Not to mention all the outposts outside of Ontario - maybe some day =)."
