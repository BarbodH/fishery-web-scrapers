4549889,pikeman14,2016-02-15 19:53:00,144,"Mike, do you think you would target pike on this trip? The idea of having a ready float plane at the dock sounds like a 3 week trip."
4549937,Mike Borger,2016-02-15 20:06:00,1554,"Pike will be a big part of it! Talking to the outfitter he dropped a couple of boats into Ney lake just north of Echoing last summer. He said he only fished one bay for a couple of hours but caught a ton of pike including some giants. The entire lake is still an unknown. He suggested flying into Ney with a wall tent and staying a night which we might do.I've been eyeing up Stull and Rorke Lake as well, both big lakes and the outfitter has never fished them. Rorke is connected to Kistigan in Manitoba which I know pumps out lots of giant pike.He has a rough outpost camp on the narrows between Yelling and Reider Lake north of Echoing. We'll definitely spend one night there. Walleyes galore supposedly where the rapids come in at the south end of Yelling and brook trout in the Echoing river where it flows north out of Reider.You are absolutely right a week won't be enough time."

4551473,spoonchucker,2016-02-16 09:21:00,82,Mike- I do wills and deeds all day which is why I can only go fishing once a year.... I can see this area is right near the trophy pike lake area of Edmund and Kistigan in Manitoba and I have never duplicated the Pike trip to Edmund where in four days fishing I caught Five Master Angler Pike. This is pretty fascinating.On first glance through his web site I could not see e where he indicated the max capacity and my group is sometimes quite large- like this year we have 16 going to Kesagami and we had to limit two other guys out.
4551633,Mike Borger,2016-02-16 09:57:00,1554,"Just taking an educated guess but I'll bet their max capacity is 16 give or take, although typically the groups in camp are much smaller than that. The outfitter would have the answer to that question. You're right it is fascinating."
4554585,sloughboy,2016-02-17 07:55:00,13,The darkness of September may save your life from utter exhaustion May the weather allow you to fish all the lakes and locations you will have targeted.
4555465,Mike Borger,2016-02-17 13:26:00,1554,"One of the guys coming along actually just said ""thank god the days will be short, not sure if I could take it"" LOL! He was with me at North Caribou last June and we put in some really long days."
4545897,Mike Borger,2016-02-14 16:34:00,1554,"I spend a lot of time researching and seeking out new fishing destinations. Probably too much time. There are very few unknowns or surprises left anymore, at least within the province of Ontario. Not often, but every once in a while I stumble across something amazing. I truly believe this is one of those times and figured you guys might like to hear about it.It's Echoing Lake Camp in FAR northwestern Ontario right near the Manitoba border. They use Rusty Myers in Sioux Lookout and it's a THREE HOUR flight NW into camp. It is easily the furthest north operating camp within the province.Here's a condensed history of the camp. A local gentleman by the name of Andy Tardiff built the existing camp in conjunction with the Sachigo Lake First Nations. Prior to the camp being built he'd fly in there to fish and camp with his native friends. The camp was built primarily so him and his friends would have a place to go fishing.They never really marketed it or advertised it, but always ran a couple groups through camp every year just to offset their costs more or less.Andy is getting older and the camp closed down 3 years ago. That probably explains why my inquiries weren't answered for the last two years. Well, Andy's grandson Shaun Szachury is now taking over the reins and he has officially reopened the camp. He wants to operate it as a viable business.Echoing Lake itself is teeming with mid sized lake trout in the 8-15 pound class with some over 20. There are also some very large pike. I've done my research and talked to a number of people and by all accounts the fishery here is crazy for sheer numbers of fish.Here's the REALLY interesting thing about this place. A float plane is based at the camp and at your disposal to fish any number of nearby lakes and and rivers for trophy pike, walleye and brook trout. Much of these waters are completely virgin and have never been fished. Use of the plane is part of the package price, there are no extra costs. It's a very small camp with only a couple of guest cabins and the price includes all your meals.In my opinion the sheer remoteness of this operation, the untapped virgin fishing and the ability to explore new waters make this perhaps the most interesting and unique fly in destination within the province.If anyone is wondering YES I will be visiting the camp myself this September. I know Shaun is flying by the seat of his pants right now as virtually no one knows about him or his operation.Definitely worth a look I think. http://echoinglake.com/"
4545985,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-14 16:53:00,8293,"Thanks Mike, looked the web site over, it looks like fun."
4545993,pjshorthorn,2016-02-14 16:53:00,5654,"Mike, To quote one of the more well know lines from the movie Sandlot, "" You're killing me Verne "". . I think you have just added another location to the bucket list of the many fishing trip dreamers. Thanks for sharing and I look forward to hearing about your time there. Maybe a short article on the history of the camp for the next magazine publication ? PjShorthorn."

Maybe a short article on the history of the camp for the next magazine publication ? PjShorthorn. Glad I piqued your interest. I've already got all the content for the spring issue in the can. Just working on rounding out content for the fall issue. I'll churn out my usual lengthy online story about Echoing though, and there will be a magazine feature about it next year.I haven't announced this anywhere publicly yet but it looks as though I'll be printing the mag this year which is cool. Scary, but cool."
4546097,pjshorthorn,2016-02-14 17:24:00,5654,"Sweet !!!!!.....on all fronts. You'll do just fine with the print copy......there are enough of us ""old school"" folks left who like to thumb through the pages to make it worthwhile for you PjShorthorn."
4546185,spurs101,2016-02-14 17:52:00,635,Think I'll have a chat with them in Madison this year.
4546281,Mike Borger,2016-02-14 18:17:00,1554,"Talking to Shaun last week he'd been to a couple of shows so far this winter and said it was a colossal waste of time. I know he's got a couple more on tap, I guess Madison is one? He's a really nice young man, I'm rooting for him."
4549409,BrianE,2016-02-15 18:21:00,98,"Thank you for the info Mike, always enjoy reading your articles, very informative right down to the nitty gritty."
4549641,forgop,2016-02-15 19:07:00,880,"Just get behind the yoke and fly right on in Mike. If I had the ability to afford all of Mike's trips, I could start all of my campfires with $100 bills rather than paper towel or newspaper. I need to change careers to enjoy more buckets lists in a season than many achieve in a lifetime. Are you taking applications for an apprentice?"
4549793,bthomas3333,2016-02-15 19:31:00,465,Wow. COOL...I would love to do this. Nothing fights better than 8-20 lb Lake Trout. Offically added to the list of places to visit in the next couple of years.
