I've never ice fished the Canadian side. Guys I'm going with are experienced up there. Told we will fish eyes crappies and run to whitefish bay for trout.. I've never caught a laker... Can I bring euro larvae in sawdust across the border? I bought some white 4"" tubes and big spoons and jigging raps for lakers. Need anything else?"
4529657,Bill Krejca,2016-02-09 08:02:00,6107,"I don't believe you can bring larva, wax worms, etc across the border; I though wax worms could be a great warm water bait,but I believe I read that they can't be brought across. Someone will confirm this, I'm sure. Bill"

4533609,Bluebomber,2016-02-10 09:43:00,29,"Thanks for the info guys! I did pick up some 4"" white with metal flake tubes for lakers with 1/4 oz rattle jigs. Running braid on a bait caster setup do I need a mono leader? Or are the lakers fine with green braid? Just north of black duck be fishing eyes before the days done. Stoked I am!"
4534049,huntercj,2016-02-10 11:57:00,23,Good luck fishing I am up in morson almost every weekend I have a cabin up there. I was just up over the weekend walleye fishing was good. A mono leader for trout isn't a bad idea they can be finicky and water is very clear.
4549137,Bluebomber,2016-02-15 17:02:00,29,Had a great trip! Weather was brutal and I'm sure hurt the fishing. -26 and wind sat morning! Burrrr! Got a few nice eyes and got into some crappies. Never made it up to whitefish... Maybe next time!
