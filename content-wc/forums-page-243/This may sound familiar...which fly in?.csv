4546017,Bstar,2016-02-14 17:01:00,564,"Hi Bigcreek, First and foremost I would like you to extend my thanks and gratitude to your son for serving our country and keeping our freedoms safe so we can continue to do and say(within the law) what we want in this country. I' m sure our good neighbors to the north will concur with me. I can personally recommend Amik Outposts out of Red Lake. You can find them at canadianflyinfishing.com. I have been looking at Slate Falls Outposts, Mattice Lake Outposts as well as White River Air. If your looking at an American plan lodge I would recommend Esnagami Wilderness Lodge. I would also look into Lodge 88 with White River Air. You can find a lot of info on this forum by doing some searches of particular camps. Check out Mike Borger's canadafishingguide.net site for in depth trip reports on several Fly in outposts and camps. Mike's an accomplished writer and a well respected contributor to this site. Good luck with your search and let us know what you decide. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions as I live in the Chicago area."
4541849,bigcreekdad,2016-02-13 07:54:00,74,"A few years ago, I was asking on this board for some fly in recommendations for my son and I. We received some good recommendations. He was in the US Army at the time, and for two consecutive summers, we had to cancel out due to Army assignments. He's now out, after 10 years (ending up as a major in the Special Forces), and is working on his MBA in Chicago. In any case, he sees a potential opening this summer where we might be able to fit a trip in. Our ""problem"" is....we are wimps, and would much prefer indoor plumbing. I know, I know.....why would a guy from Special Forces worry about such...well...cuz he's done enough of that crap, so to speak. I'm kinda of the same mindset, although my such prior experiences were limited to the Boy Scouts. We had planned to use White's Air a few years ago as they had a few ""deluxe"" camps. They are still high on my list, but I was wondering if any new such camps had opened in the last few years. Thanks in advance"
4541913,wallydave,2016-02-13 08:10:00,2151,"Have you checked out Hidden Bay Lodge? They have indoor plumbing in their cabins, they also like helping veterans. They offer a meal plan great customer service, and we had some fantastic fishing on Miniss Lake in September! The owners live in Dundee. Good luck and happy surfing!"
4542001,Mike Borger,2016-02-13 08:46:00,1554,VERY glad to hear you guys are going to try and make it happen this year!Strictly looking at outpost camps with indoor toilets my first choice would be Minniss or Lake St. Joseph with Slate Falls Outposts in Sioux Lookouthttp://slatefallsoutposts.com/If you're willing to forgo the indoor toilet there are countless amazing outpost camps with showers and hot/cold running water.Also if a housekeeping lodge isn't out of the question I can suggest a bunch of great ones that have indoor toilets.
4542185,deputy dog,2016-02-13 09:52:00,305,"also just as important as indoor plumbing is exceptional fishing. true just being in the awesomeness that is remote canada is great but having remarkable fishing just seems to make it all the better. i would put just as much effort in finding a lake that has great fishing, as attested to by actual clients not just their website, as finding a camp with indoor plumbing. due your research as their is a wealth of knowledge on this site. also, give as much info regarding your requirements such as travel time, budget, meals included, boat rental etc. as you can and the guys and gals on here will surely chime in with their suggestions. good luck and take your time to find the perfect fit for you and your son."
4542217,Mike Borger,2016-02-13 10:07:00,1554,I'll just throw these out there in case a housekeeping lodge is an option. All have great fishing and indoor toilets. All are on big bodies of water with lots of room to explore.1. Bauer's on Onaman Lake http://www.onamanlake.com/Onaman_Lake2.html2.Smoothrock Camp http://www.thunderhook.com/smoothrock-camp/3.Whitewater Lake with Mattice Lake Outfitters (I loved this facility and lake)http://walleye.ca/wilderness_lodges/...ke/default.asphttp://www.canadafishingguide.net/wh...of-the-giants/FWIW the fishing on both Minniss and St. Joe is fantastic as well.
4542265,yoopertrout,2016-02-13 10:14:00,1172,"I'd highly recommend Kabeelo. My wife and I went in 2014, and we're going back this summer. They have indoor plumbing (which was a treat for us, as our own cabin has an outhouse), hot showers, and they provide all the food (you have the option of bringing your own.) The also provide a lake map with marked spots, and have the people who are leaving as you arrive tell you where they did well. We picked a small (1000 acre) lake, and it was easy to figure out, and no long boat rides to get to the spots. We asked for a lake that was primarily walleyes, and we could lots of them. The average size was about 19""-20"". We caught about 10 that were over 26"", and lots that were 23""-25"". Our biggest was 27.5"". The group before us caught one that was 28"". We also got some northern in the high thirty inch range, and one that was 40"". The cabin was very clean, and the whole operation was very safe and well run. They have everything down to a science."

4542841,Mike Borger,2016-02-13 14:34:00,1554,As usual you're an amazing source of info! The irony is I was very recently looking at either Cobham Morely or Cobham Daniel on the Cobham river system with Amik Outposts. I like the fact that it's a river system with tons of water to explore with a high potential for trophy fish. I had no clue these camps had indoor toilets LOL! http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/...cobham-daniel/http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/...cobham-morley/Their camp on Cherrington looks pretty great too. Bigger body of water and nice cabin.http://www.canadianflyinfishing.com/...rrington-lake/
4544737,phishfearme,2016-02-14 09:23:00,1242,consider kearns lake - with thousand lakes outposts - see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ht=kearns+lake and there's also a vid of the incredible cabin:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrK6eIBH668 phish
4545777,Bstar,2016-02-14 15:35:00,564,"Hi Mike, Our group went to Amik's Cobham Morley outpost in Aug. 2011. They do have indoor flush toilets as well as hot water and showers. They do request that you use the toilets for your nighttime Labatts Blue deposits. They do have the typical outhouse behind the cabin for everything else if you know what I mean. We had a great time there. Caught a ton of nice walleye. There is a nice hump east of the Cobham Daniel cabin that John ( pilot/owner) recommended that we try. We went there the first morning as there wouldn't be anybody at the Daniel outpost until later that day. We annihilated some big walleye on that spot. We never went back due to the fact that we didn't want to infringe on their water. That's just the way we are. The camps are about 5 miles apart. We caught plenty of walleye on our side of the the lake. Unfortunately we didn't do much pike fishing on our trip. I think you would enjoy the challenge on the Cobham system. There's a lot of water to explore and it's known for the huge pike it produces. John is a true outdoorsman and a great pilot. Cabin was more than adequate with a nice deck, grill and fish cooker.it also had a nice screened in porch. Boats were adequate with good motors. The seat cushions were somewhat worn when we were there so I would recommend to bring your own. John does have swivels seats in the boats. The only problem we had was that our flight out was delayed by about 2 hours due to fog in Red Lake. Mother Nature still rules. Hope this helps. I may be contacting you about Lodge 88 in the future."
