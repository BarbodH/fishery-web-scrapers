Says modern cabins but not much for pics of the actual cabins on the website. Would be strictly musky fishing but would like to hear about water clarity, navigation etc."

Smith Camps is a family business which is still owned by the original family. They have a great beach, cabins, docks and launch are well kept. Lots to do and see on the lake as well as Kenora near by. Many local people come out to the restaurant to enjoy the great food. They offer boat rentals and guide service for those that want it. Worth giving it a go, for sure.Probably not the best part of the lake for musky but very good walleye, bass and pike nearby. Never more than 30 minutes boat ride to good musky. For navigation you have to remember it is Lake of The Woods so always follow a lake chart. Water is good clarity but not as clear as some other parts of the lake."
4552761,Lovetofish,2016-02-16 14:50:00,458,I was there maybe 20 years ago around Labor Day. The camp was fine. Sorry I can't help on the musky as we fished for walleye. We also caught some very nice small mouth. I remember they had a nice bar and dinning area and maybe some games for kids. This was just a guys short trip and it was very reasonable. We stayed 4 nights and fished three days.
4556497,MN_Moose,2016-02-17 19:36:00,964,"We go every year. depending on what you consider ""family"" vacation. How old are the kids? The cabins are very nice. The nicest I have stayed in anywhere from Arkansas to Canada. A few are three bedroom and very nice. We like the lodge amenities. Dockage is very good and dock boys are very helpful. Depending upon what time of year you go would make a difference on musky spots. Both the Smith ""boys"" (they're young men now, and Mack served in US Marines) do very well musky fishing. You can find spots and not much competition. We like it very well and could not recommend a finer place."
4557217,DeBo,2016-02-18 06:14:00,211,Family consists of my wife and I plus my parents. No kids. I meant a family trip from a we won't be spending 13 hours a day in the boat so the cabin needs to offer a nice view and comfort. I think my mom would appreciate Wifi. Dad is pretty happy with a book when not out on the water. Would be nice having kenora a relatively short drive away as well. And if I get lonesome for Minaki I could trailer up there for an evening real easy as well. Trip would be late August time frame. Are the musky grounds far out? Looking at the map there are certainly plenty of spots in the area. I have always heard the density is lower in that portion of the lake but I guess that doesn't bother me a whole lot. Fishing will consist of hitting prime times for 3-4 hour stints.
4559505,MN_Moose,2016-02-18 18:40:00,964,"Since you're with parents you can ask for a cabin on the beach level. No hill to navigate. And yes you can get wi if on deck of the cabin. If you can't get it on the deck anyone can walk up to the main lodge and use it. Musky spots will be on the route to town or, concentrate on Moore bay. The Hades also give up their share of ski. Great time to go. Yes Kenora is interesting. About a 15-20 minute drive. I wouldn't bother with the trip to MinKi. You'll have everything you could want on LOTW. (We used to stay at Sunnyside on the Winnipeg river)"
