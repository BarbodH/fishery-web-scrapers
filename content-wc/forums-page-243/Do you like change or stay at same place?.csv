4532945,SinOrSwim,2016-02-10 07:15:00,1528,We are making a change after about 5 or 6 years. Makes me nervous. Been going to Lac Seul but the drive to where we liked to fish was getting LONG. Trying Cedar this year at Clark's. Very impressed so far with their response time and ease to work with. What does your group do? Who makes the decision? Makes me nervous to sort of lead the change. If fishing isn't as good I will feel horrible.
4533145,oleJoe,2016-02-10 07:53:00,114,"We have been going with the same outfitter for 20 yrs now. We have tried most of his lakes and settled on Melchett for 7 or 8 years. Its a long drive to Nakina from Ohio but with at least 6 guys the driving wasn't to bad then! Now we spend the night in the Soo. Going up and coming back. I know it adds 2 day onto the trip , but is so much more relaxing. Before Nakina we bounced around eastern Ont. and a couple trips to Quebec. Tough fishing and some sad cabins. Lots of wildlife though. You didn't even have to go out of the cabin to see it either. Older now and slowing down but very satisfied with our Nakina outfitter. I guess its what you enjoy doing. Just catching or figuring out where they are, or some of both. I know I want to just keep doing it. Have fun."
4533177,BornToFish,2016-02-10 08:04:00,1224,"You asked an interesting question. I believe the answer might not be as simple as one might expect. Basically, it comes down to two parts. The first part is to encourage anglers stay at one place (camp or lake) the first several years of fishing on the Canadian Shield. The reason that I say this is that beginners need to learn HOW to successfully fish on the Shield. Proven fishing strategies and techniques when I fish on the Shield are very different from those developed for my lakes at home. Beginners need to learn their proven techniques, strategies and refine their fishing equipment as may be needed. Keeping the lake a constant the first few years allows the beginner to focus on the techniques, strategies and equipment. The second part comes into play once the angler establishes proven techniques and strategies for fishing on the Shield. I believe it's easier for an established angler to move lakes as it comes down to simply learning spots to fish. These are much easier to learn (from guides, lodge owners, friends at the dock, maps, etc.) than learning the techniques and strategies. Established anglers can look at a map, go to the spot on the lake, and fairly quickly catch fish as they already know what to do and how to do it, once they get there. I see newbie anglers every season at the lodge that I fish from that are chasing the mystical bite. They badmouth the previous year's lake as not having fish. I show them spots on the lake to fish, and watch them struggle as they use their ""proven"" techniques from their waters back home in the US. The Clarks are a top-notch family that operate a well-respected business on great lakes to fish. I sense that your group is in the second group of anglers that I described above. I am confident that you will need a day or two to learn a handful of spots to fish, but after that you will be into some great fish. I predict that you will be glad that you made the move.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4533361,Duflebag,2016-02-10 08:41:00,218,"I am probably different than a lot on WC. I have stayed at the same camp for 28 years now. What probably keeps me satisfied with one camp is that they are not on the lake and we fish different lakes every day if we want. We drive to the lakes we fish every day instead of going to the dock and fishing the same lake.Being not tied to one lake addresses those cycles in fishing that every lake experiences. Some years are just not good years and other years are outstanding on any lake. Being able to fish whatever lake is hot means that we have a higher percentage of good days versus bad days consistently. In addition, fishing a great walleye lake like Lac Seul is great when the weather cooperates but as anyone who has fished Lac Seul knows, that lake is a monster when the wind blows. On those days we have the option of fishing another smaller lake and still have a great day of fishing without getting our brains beat in or not fishing at all.In addition, driving to the lakes we fish gives us the ability to fish for multiple species on a lake that has great fishing for that species. Want smallmouth, we fish a smallmouth lake. Want muskies, we fish a numbers lake for someone that wants to catch their first musky and Cedar or Eagle for those that want a personal best. That is why I have stayed at one camp for almost three decades. We have great fishing every year and top notch guides taking us out. You will have a great time at Clarks. Cedar is a great lake to fish with excellent multi-species fishing."
4533633,MikeinMN,2016-02-10 09:50:00,190,"I used to fish with a group that did fly-in trips, and most every year we would use a different outfitter. The quality of everything varied a lot from one to another (although somehow the cost was usually really close) and we were all OK with that. There were always a couple surprises every year, some for the good and some not. We always felt that was part of the adventure, and it was adventure first, fishing second, comfort last. The group I go with now is totally different. I think this group will be at Gawley's on Lac Seul until we don't go anymore. We know exactly what to expect (except for the weather), navigate fairly easily, and have our favorite spots to fish. Fishing is first, comfort second, and adventure is dead last with this group. I don't really feel either group had a definite ""leader"" who made all the decisions, but some group members had stronger opinions than others. I have been one of the strong opinion guys in both groups, and like you I have worried about pushing the group in a direction they are not comfortable with. I think you will find out where your group is on the fishing vs. comfort vs. adventure scale this year, and if for some reason Clark's is not your new spot, hopefully you can just fall back on LS the next year."
4533665,tv4fish,2016-02-10 09:55:00,2694,"OH --- Maybe not. My group is similar to yours. We've been going up to Sioux Lookout and fishing Lac Seul since 1985. The very first resort that we went to is now the same one that we stay with every year. We actually have tried different resorts in the earlier years, but when you find one that meets all your needs and is reasonably priced, it's hard to go to a different one."
4533673,Mike Borger,2016-02-10 09:59:00,1554,I love fishing new water. No matter how good the fishing was I'd lose my mind fishing the same lake year after year.
4533769,packpro,2016-02-10 10:51:00,695,"Our group has been together for 17 years. We have tried to find a different location 6 different times. Our group is made up of some hard core fishermen and others who just enjoy the fun and camaraderie of the group. Yet they still like to catch fish. For obvious reasons the hardcore guys fish with the hardcore guys, and the party guys go their own way. It is just their nature. So when we try new water the hardcore guys still catch fish, but the others struggle. I think we are done with the searching. We have finally settled a great multi species body of water, that has tons of eaters and great deal of bigger fish. They average gets bigger every year. There are so many spots everyone can go there own way and have a great time. Having said that, there are two of us that have our eye on a pioneering trip to south Lac Suel. Oh darn, wemay have to take two trips one of these years."
4533849,camp chef,2016-02-10 11:06:00,915,"We seem to move every three to four years for the adventure of fishing new water and seeing new things as well as making new friends. Once we switch to a new place we stay until it starts to ""Seem Small "". Then we pick a new adventure. Lately it has been places closer. The older we get the less time in the Truck we seem to be able to endure"
4538729,SinOrSwim,2016-02-12 07:26:00,1528,"ProV knows what he is doing. We have fished with him before. I see pros and cons to both. We aren't what I would consider highly skilled fisherman so finding go to spots is always nice. Knowing what to expect from the cabins and equipment is always nice. We go in September so keeping our spot isn't typically an issue. If you had a spot in June, that would be tough to leave. it is a lot easier to change now I think. I remember when we first started going, changing or booking came down to who we saw at the All Canada Show. You really had to put trust in what they were telling you but now the internet lets you explore and compare a ton of different places. Really looking forward to a few days on Cedar. The ONLY downside I see is the fact I keep watching all those **** Muskie videos and want to try. LOL I saw a guy said on one..........it's the fish of 10000 casts..........then said..........it's also the fish of $10000 LOL Yowza that gear is expensive. Lures in particular."
4538825,prov1800,2016-02-12 07:40:00,5010,"Haha.dont get all caught up in the muskie trap.when we go out in sept you can use my gear.I have plenty and it wont take 10,000 casts either.Cedar wil be good to you guys.The day we go to Cliff lake for trout we'll cast over there for some muskies as well.You will have a great experience."
4539201,Old Timer,2016-02-12 09:04:00,255,"Say, Michigan Walleye Guy, if you were going to pick a single fly-in lake to fish you couldn't do much better than Larus. That was one of my few repeat lakes back in the late 70's and early 80's. We always managed to catch three or four 30"" class fish each trip and for a while, that was reason enough to return to Larus. We mixed it up one year and hauled the Lunds around the falls at the west end and down into the Sabourin Lake system. That's a beautiful stretch of water and wonderful fishing to boot."
4540601,Daveygravy,2016-02-12 17:57:00,88,"Our group has gone on the same fly in for the last 10 years , but due to camp neglect we have booked with a new outfitter for this summer. I was given the job of finding a new spot for our group , which consists of 2 older gentlemen and 4 42 to 57 year olds. We liked the old camp due to the fact that it was the only camp on the system and we knew the spots. However the trophy potential was not there. I researched a lot and finally decided on lake st joe through slate falls. It's hard to please everyone and I think this is a good choice. I myself, like a mixture of both. Some places are just magical and must be revisited and others are just fun."
4543377,pale ryder,2016-02-13 18:48:00,1937,I've been going to Clark's Northern Lights on Cedar Lake for the past 10 years. I can't compare the fishing there to Lac Seul because I haven't fished Lac Seul. But I can say the fishing on Cedar is very good but not super easy like a fly in. The lake is small enough that wind is seldom a problem but big enough that you shouldn't get bored. The Clarks run a great camp everything is clean up to date and well kept. I think you will be happy with your choice.
4546025,515,2016-02-14 17:01:00,254,Different lake each year for us as we love the new scenery and challenge of a new lake.
4547209,SinOrSwim,2016-02-15 06:33:00,1528,I was going to mention Slate Falls as I was reading your post. I believe they have installed hand rails at some of their lakes for the older men specifically. You will not find a better outfitter. Their attention to detail and the way the keep their camps is outstanding. I've never fished St. Joe but we went to North and South Gull with Verne for many years before he sold that part of his operation to John.
4536457,Stehle1,2016-02-11 09:37:00,22,"We drove from Northern Indiana to Savant Lake for several years to the same outfitter (24 hour drive). It started off that we rented a Motorhome to haul anywhere from 6-8 guys. When gas got expensive, we switched to vehicles and saved a lot of money but it required two drivers of the group to be awake enough to drive. At the same time, our long time outfitter was changing hands from Father to Son. The new owner was not maintaining his equipment and was difficult to work with. The fishing also took a dip. We switched some six years ago to a new location (Expeditions North) that best fit our decision matrix. It is still a fly in camp but the lake has several more fisherman than the last lake. However, the fish are larger and more prevalent. We got our drive down to 12 hours and we made the decision to spend a night on the way in to help us with driver grogginess. It seems the older we get the less capable we are of driving through the night. One note though, our fishing tactics did switch from lake to lake. On the first lake, we fished primarily bottom bouncers and crankbaits. The current lake it is best to use jigs followed by crankbaits. I don't even tie on a bottom bouncer anymore and have a crap ton of beads and blades that I may never use."
4536713,Bigstorm,2016-02-11 10:47:00,799,"I have been going to the same place for the past 10yrs (Grassy Narrows, English River). There is a lot of water and we find new places every year, so until we get bored there, we'll keep going back"
4536977,prov1800,2016-02-11 12:32:00,5010,"Iam very fortunate that i live in a great area and can pick and chose lakes to fish anytime i want and i do.But with my guiding life i have guided at one camp a few years ago for 8 years and came to the conclusion that i needed a change.it just got old.but thats being on the water every day.Always loved the fishing part and never got tired of that.I ended up guiding all over the place most of the time on the same lake just a different camp and enjoyed the new looks, docks, different people.I do have my own guiding business which i do in between camp jobs and enjoy that even more as i can and do take folks out to any lake they want to go to for any species.Mind you if i could only come up for one week i would probably be happy anywhere allthough everything would have still have make you happy.But through out my encounters with guests i have taken out at some of the camps i do hear a lot of grumbling here and there.Pretty much keep that to myself and guys will switch till they find the right place.To some numbers is everything and if thats not there they look for a new place even if there poor fisherman.But with all the lakes here and can catch as many fish as i want i lean toward challenging lakes where they dont jump in the boat and i really have to use my fishing skills.In conclusion to this i would say yes to the change, if your not happy, get happy."
4537105,tv4fish,2016-02-11 13:45:00,2694,"I would think that as a guide - it would be to your advantage to ""stick to"" a lake and learn where the fish are at different times of the year. I believe people that hire you (a guide) to ""put them on fish"" ARE concerned about and EXPECT to catch fish. I don't think they want to be a part of just ""searching"" for fish."
4537201,prov1800,2016-02-11 14:28:00,5010,You wouldnt have to be concerned about any lake i guide on.I know them all at all times of the year and through the winter as well.Thats my job and i take seriously.If someone wants a specific fish that isnt in a certain lake wouldnt it be nice to have someone take you there and know your guide knows that lake also.Theres a lot of guys on this forum that i have guided staying at the different camps on different lakes and cant remember ever having any complaints.
4537217,tv4fish,2016-02-11 14:32:00,2694,"OK -- Sure sounds like you have it covered, then......"
4537281,KSjim,2016-02-11 14:55:00,88,"Over the years we have gotten to like to rotate a few lakes. Seems like you appreciate all the things that makes that particular lake special more if you have not been there for awhile. The down side is you lose your time slot. We like to fish the second week of June, as well as a lot of other people. This, in the occasional year pushes us to a new lake, but with all the great fishing lakes in Canada that is not necessarily a bad thing either."
4537593,Old Timer,2016-02-11 17:14:00,255,"I found the guy who fishes the same lake and the same narrows has few interesting stories to share. I guess that's fine for some, but I always wanted to fish the next lake over, and then the next one over from the one before."
4537673,prov1800,2016-02-11 17:31:00,5010,Excatly.Nothing like fishing new waters.ive had the privilege of taking guests out on Eagle Lake for instance but get to take them from various camps spread all over the lake so thats always a treat for me .From the west arm of Eagle to Ingall falls is 65 miles.or lakes like Lac Seul fished from different access points.Always exciting.
4538057,michigan walleye guy,2016-02-11 19:59:00,95,"Great thread! I'm in the camp of not wanting to change up a good thing, which is why I look forward so much to my May fly-in to Larus Lake. Because of family graduations this spring, for the first time since 2001, I will be missing this trip. I'm already grousing about that, even though I booked a shorter trip with Mattice Lake Outfitters for the week before. What's interesting, though, is I cut my teeth on Canadian fishing on a small drive-to lake on 599, Wintering Lake. At the time, I couldn't imagine anything better. Fly-in trips seemed way to costly back in 1984, and I didn't want to change anything. However, once I went on my first fly in, I couldn't imagine every going back to a drive-to lake. I go on two fly-in's a year now, and as long as Nestor Falls Outposts are around, I'll probably never consider anything else, unless I have to, like this year. I do have several ""bucket list"" trips on my wish list, though, like a trip to Eagle Lake and a trip to either Aikens Lake or Gunisao, which I could only afford to do once in my life. I have reached that tipping point in my life in which I have more disposable income and time than I do the legs and stamina to do things like the Boundary Waters canoe trips I used to love so much. I now stay at a nice lodge like Gunflint Lodge and only fish the lakes I can use a boat/motor in. Fishing Saganaga, Gunflint, and North lakes is also one of my favorite things in life. Thanks for listening! Have a great season, everybody!!"
4533977,drlee,2016-02-10 11:48:00,409,"I want it both ways. I love the familiarity of fishing the same lake(s) every summer, which allows me to typically catch enough fish to keep me happy. Also, the opportunity to explore new water and face the challenge of learning new spots to fish, intrigues me. Over many years, I have actually fished 26 different lakes in northern Ontario and have no regrets. Met a lot of great people, got on well with the camp owners in virtually every case, and saw some beautiful country. When I retired 9 years ago, I narrowed down to two lakes, one of which I fish for a week in June, the other for two consecutive weeks in late July/early August. I love both lakes, the people I have gotten to know, since many return year after year the same weeks, and the owners are first class. Once in a while, I get the urge to take on a different lake. I am a bit nostalgic about a couple of the lakes I fished years ago and could give that some thought. But, I would be reluctant to give up any weeks I have on the two favorites, since I would run the risk of not getting back in the following year, if I so desired. I have fished big lakes, Lac Seul, Eagle, St. Joseph, and some smaller lakes like Thaddeus, Wabaskang, and Route. The ones I fish now are 10,000 acres and 20,000 acres so the variety is certainly available on both. Sure is fun to think back on all of the great experiences and hope the good Lord will give me a few more years to enjoy his beautiful creation."

Same place since the first trip with someone else in the late 90s, now running my own trips, 2 per year, trying to ""catch up"" on the trip count. We trailer to Lac Seul every day, but may not fish the same spot twice in a trip. Same place means I know the service level I can expect, know what's in the cabins, know my routes, and routines, see the same folks in camp every year. Here and there, I've had a little wanderlust, and have moved to different cabins in the same resort, but I'd hate to give up my week there to try something else. For me, ""Why fold with a winning hand?"""
4534201,tv4fish,2016-02-10 12:35:00,2694,"EXACTLY --- After all, Lac Seul is certainly big enough that you could/can try many new spots every year. That said - it's also nice to know that you can go to some ""honey holes"" that you know have produced good fish every year."
4534265,ogilville,2016-02-10 12:56:00,262,"My experience has been one lake and one camp, and now on the second owner. This will be the 30th anniversary of the first time I went in 1986. Although I have missed going a couple of times for various reasons. I was the guy that tagged along the first year. There were three of us young guys in our 20's that were as interested in drinking beer and having a good time as much as we were the fishing. The next several years were usually groups of four guys from work. The beer drinking still went on but the fishing became more important with each year. Then I started taking my Dad and sometimes some of my Uncles went at different times too. One year it was with Dad and his four remaining brothers. Those are all great memories now as they have all passed away. The trip evolved over the years with different people going. Now for about the last ten years it has been me and one buddy that make the trip. We have our system down to where we share the duties required without any problems. The beer drinking has become something that we do at lunch time and in the evening when we aren't in the boat as the law requires. Its now more important to find and catch the fish. This annual trip has been a major highlight of my year for a long time now. We make our reservation for the next year before we leave at the end of the week. I have heard stories of guys at different camps that aren't as clean or as well ran as ours. So, we just go back every year and know what to expect and try to enjoy the week as much as possible. Then do it again next year."

For us - it's a great time to get together and talk about what has happened in the last year (We live a little ways apart). Same scenario - the beer drinking USED to be a big part of the trip. Now we are ""older and wiser"" (I think) and do it more for the camaraderie and the chance to reminisce and enjoy the chance to have some great fishing."

The first one is usually a safer 'known' lake. The second trip is something new and different. A few times the 'new' thing became the known thing and then I keep trying new places as a second trip.Seems to give me the best of both worlds.b-"
4534609,Coyoteman,2016-02-10 14:59:00,209,I have been fishing the same lake for at least 15 years. Although every year is similar we always discover something new. I did start going on a second trip last year to a completely different lake and it was fun figuring out a completely different fishery.

It's perfect for the kids, weekend trips, and cheap family vacations. We are starting to get to know people in the community and as the kids grow they will certainly develop a familiarity with the area. Fishing is darn good too. But for my big Canadian trips each year, we always try new water. We like the research, planning, excitement, and adventure into the unknown more than we like the actual fishing."
4536169,ftfarms,2016-02-11 07:50:00,444,Since 1991 ive fished lac suel for 16 years and over 20 weeks. I started taking a second trip. spring we stayed around earfalls summer we stayed around scout bay. Both great trips but I keep thinking I'm missing something. So the second trip was with my wife so we started to explore other lakes. I've found some fun camp owners and great Lakes. I haven't fished lac suel since 2008. Not because of the fishing. The walleye fishing is still tops on my list. I fell in love with lake of the woods. It's a way shorter drive (walleye smallmouth crappie pike musky) fishing is great. So many islands. Doing two trips there this year. July and August.
4533969,DeBo,2016-02-10 11:47:00,211,"No right answer to this question! For me the quality of fishing is paramount. I need a big body of water cause I like to roam and a multi basin water provides better fishing in more season/weather scenarios. I don't mind driving all over in the boat but I would rather not drive too far in the truck. Really prefer to have a nice dock for the boat as trailering to different lakes can get old. I have done that trip in NE SD for the last 8-10 years and a week of launching the boat 1-4 times a day gets old. Relatively cheap is important as well. All I require is a clean cabin or a decent campsite. If I wanted to be pampered I would go on a different type of vacation/trip. I ended up at my first destination cause I went with friends who's dads have been going there forever. However the last few years I have started to check some other destinations and don't really plan on going back. The resort was perfect for what I wanted but the fishing pressure just got to be too much. If I wanna chase fish with hook tears on 75% of the fish I will fish near home. Learning new water is fun and exciting but I really miss the detailed knowledge that only time on the water can give. So it took me about a decade to decide what I wanted. Many bodies of water up there seem to have their own ""Mystique"". I think that plays a very important role in how much we enjoy the water/trips. I'm betting I will have a hard time later this summer thinking about how the year passed without fishing some of my favorite spots I have ever fished."
