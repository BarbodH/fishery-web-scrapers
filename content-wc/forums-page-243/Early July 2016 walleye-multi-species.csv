But, it certainly was a LOT different than my typical week long fishing trips with the guys. We did a lot of swimming, played games, went for ice cream etc etc. We took our own pontoon, which was PERFECT for a family. I found that my kids were WAY more interested in catching perch and crappie right from the dock than going out in the boat and trying for bigger fish. It took me a few days to adjust to the ""family trip mindset"". But once I did, it was some of the most fun I've ever had."
4557849,okiesprayguy,2016-02-18 09:17:00,12,"Thanks for your reply. It will definitely be a family oriented trip. Our atving/hunting/fishing trips usually result in a ""collection"" of some kind (rocks, sticks, bones, fossils, treasure, etc). My parents are going too. I figure dad and I will fish early mornings. Then we can all go trolling, shore lunch, boating and wildlife viewing, etc. I am thinking about having the kids learn about the types of fish in Ontario. So they can identify them and stay more engaged.Anybody ever smoke fish up there to bring home? Or just clean and freeze?"
4558089,HeHooksHimself,2016-02-18 11:05:00,725,"I tried smoking them last year but couldnt keep the darn things lit! Well...I knew someone would go there, might as well be me!"
4517057,okiesprayguy,2016-02-04 21:27:00,12,New member here. Great forum and resources. We're planning a fishing trip to Ontario in early July. My wife and I along with our 5 and 9 year old kids. My parents will also be going. They camped and fished Blindfold lake 40 years ago and are interested in going back there. Is anyone familiar with Tyc's resort on Blindfold lake? I'm also looking Clarks KC'S Landing. Looks good but appears to be about twice as much money. Has anybody taken their kids for a full week? Was it too long for them? Did they fish everyday? We do go to Colorado for a week and ride atv's and they don't want to go home.
4517233,roscoe33,2016-02-04 23:40:00,653,"Looks like tac's rates are $850 Canadian per week ($600 US )for the cabin for 6 people. And Clarks rates are per person, in US $. That is a huge difference in the total bill."
4518113,adempsey,2016-02-05 09:25:00,963,"The rates at Tyc's are reasonable, but they do not include a boat and motor rental. So you need to take that into account. It looks like a decent place to me though.Another thing to keep in mind, in terms of rates, is some lodges will offer discounted rates (and even free) for children. I think for the ages of your children, it's definitely something you should look around for, or at least negotiate it in.For example, Clark's Resort, kids under 8 are free and those between 8 and 13 are half price of the adult fare.My daughter used to fish with me all day when she was 5. Not long after though she just didn't enjoy being out on the water for too long. Some people bring books etc for the kids to play with in the boat too.Just make sure wherever you go has plenty of other things to do besides fishing. A beach should be a must. Trails with free bikes. Berry picking. Maybe ATV rentals. Canoes, Kayaks,Paddleboats etc.. If you can manage it, a Pontoon boat is great for a family and nice to fish from. They are fairly common at camps out here in southwestern Ontario though, not sure about out west."
4520185,okiesprayguy,2016-02-05 21:38:00,12,"Thanks for the replies. Good ideas on the pontoon, biking and berry picking. All things we enjoy at home too. Is there much difference in the fishing between early July and late July?"
4535273,okiesprayguy,2016-02-10 19:21:00,12,"I need some more suggestions on resorts to try. I real interested in Gustafsons and Tyc's but they didn't have any availability for 4 adults and 2 kids for July 2-9. They were what I was looking for as far as size, location, and PRICE."
4535409,adempsey,2016-02-10 20:15:00,963,Here's a few you can look into. I know nothing about them. Finding a per week cabin rate is going to be a challenge.http://www.raleighlakeresort.com/http://www.gummesonscamp.com/?pgid=1http://cobbbaylodge.com/http://www.agimacriveroutfitters.ca/...ke-cabins.htmlhttp://www.breezypointcamp.com/index.htmlGood luck.
4535505,okiesprayguy,2016-02-10 21:07:00,12,"I think we may go with Lumberjack lodge on Sturgeon lake northeast of Ignace. It is a little further than I wanted to drive, but availability is there and price is right. My neighbor's uncle has been up there multiple times and said they also catch a lot of fish."
4556529,okiesprayguy,2016-02-17 19:39:00,12,"We are booked with David at Lumberjack Lodge on Sturgeon Lake for July 2 -9. I thought deciding where to go was the stressful part. It's 4.5 months away, and I'm organizing tackle boxes, switching reels out and agonizing over which combos to take and what line to use. I may have to go catch some Oklahoma crappie to ease the stress. Any suggestions line and rod/reel combos."
4557057,roscoe33,2016-02-17 23:52:00,653,"I'm a light tackle guy.Ultralight, light, medium light rods for the most part.6# mono line10# power pro line20# power pro for the northern rod.1000 and 2000 series shimano reels, between $30 and $60You don't need $400 rod n reel combos to catch fish.I do have a few St Croix rods, but my favorites were only $35."
4557153,okiesprayguy,2016-02-18 05:27:00,12,"Thanks for the suggestions. I've got 2 Shimano sienna 1000 front drag reels. I'll probably use 6 lb mono and put them on a 7' light rod. One for myself and one for my wife. I'll probably grab a couple zebco trigger spin, ultra light combos for the kids. I'll replace the line on them.I'll probably also take 2 6'6 med rods with bps pro qualifier bait casters and 10-14 lb line. Might also take a couple 6'10 or 7' mh for trolling and bigger species. We are not targeting one specific species. We just want to catch a lot of fish. I have been told there is great smallmouth fishing in some of the small lakes near there."
