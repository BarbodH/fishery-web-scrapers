Late June you should be good to go with whatever bait you choose, leaches, crawlers, or minnows. Personally I would hope for a crawler bite, less trouble keeping bait alive and much cheaper."
4533697,Strickers cut,2016-02-10 10:16:00,33,Hopefully the attachment works. The cursor is on Fishermans point.
4533889,Stringbean,2016-02-10 11:16:00,279,"We are staying over at Poplar Point which is down the river, under the bridge and around the corner. I don't see distance as being a factor on Gull Rock. If you can handle the distances on Lac Seul, this should be a piece of cake."
4534161,Coyoteman,2016-02-10 12:24:00,209,Most of the time the whole lake is no problem to navigate with camp boats. We take our own and never worried about the weather. In june the river between keg and gull can be good. The fish should be very happy to bite about any presentation about then. Shallow raps work well for us that time of year.

4560081,tyeegs,2016-02-18 21:44:00,177,"I stay at Five Lakes Lodge. Ian and Drew are great. Usually go mid-June when the hatcheries open. At that time of year, it all depends upon the ice-out."
4526633,Stringbean,2016-02-08 09:23:00,279,Little help needed here. I have seen several references to Fisherman's Point on Gull Rock Lake. I have searched the entire map of the lake and I can't find it. Anyone care to share?
4526721,Pooch,2016-02-08 09:55:00,4619,"Gull Rock used to be discussed a lot on this board in the past. Have not seen much chatter the last few years for some reason. I always thought it was a good lake with access to Red Lake or some other chain of lakes. Maybe guys are keeping it on the ""down low"" to protect their secret...Has been on my bucket list for years, but can't seem to get past Lac Seul when headed north to Red Lake area.Good luck. How about a fishing report when you get home?Pooch"
4526865,Stringbean,2016-02-08 10:28:00,279,"I share that same problem with you. If I go up the road to Ear Falls, I want to take a right and go over to Gold Pines. Its difficult if you are familiar with so many places that produce nice size walleyes and then you have to leave. I'm part of a different group of fisherman this year and they would like to fish lakes where there are no great distances. Remember, from Gold Pines to Shanty Narrows is 23 miles on the GPS and the good fishing starts south of there. Lets see how Gull Rock matches up to Lac Seul. Its going to be interesting."
4527385,Coyoteman,2016-02-08 12:30:00,209,"It's the big point on the west side just south of ranger bay. Straight west of the three sisters, or three small islands."
4527793,Strickers cut,2016-02-08 14:07:00,33,Which camp are you staying at? I'm sure they could help. Alot of good fishing spots on that end of the lake.
4528025,Pooch,2016-02-08 15:21:00,4619,"Talking about only the area from Ear Falls all the way to Manitiba Point, I've always thought that the ""good fishing"" started earlier in the season in the NW (Ear Falls) to Steamboat Bay area then migrated SE towards Manitoba Point as the the season progressed. With McKenzie Bay the exception as it seems to be it's own ecosystem with both back bays and open water.I've fished out of Goose Bay before in July and was disappointed in the fishing in the immediate area. While others claimed they did well there, so it was just me being new to that area. We boated through the Shanty Narrows and hit some decent fishing that same trip. Places camp people told us they were catching fish the week before were all but devoid of fish when we were there. Saw other boats, but never saw anyone catching fish so we headed south. I think a couple weeks earlier would have been a different story.I see that same pattern on other larger lakes we fish in Canada. I've fished Savant in late June had all the fish we could want fishing bays, then return later July and those same bays hold very few fish.When planning a trip we now consider the time of year and try to book a camp according to location to keep us as close to the fishing as we can get. Especially on LS. This is especially true if fishing out of a smaller (16.5 tiller) boat like mine on LS.Hoping others with more experience on LS than me chime in a correct me if I'm wrong about those mentioned parts of LS. We now fish out of a different camp located more in the middle of that same general area during that same time frame and the fish still seem to be moving from the bays to deeper and more open water with some fish still in the bays or feeder creek areas. Friends tell me that the fishing in the bays and feeder rivers fades as the summer moves on. Which makes sense to me.Gull Rock still on my mind, but holding for now. I wonder if Gull Rock has a pattern like Lac Seul as the season progresses? Anyone?Pooch"
4528057,Coyoteman,2016-02-08 15:29:00,209,I've never fished LS. I have never had a problem locating the fish on gullrock in the 12 years I have been going there.
4528233,Stringbean,2016-02-08 16:38:00,279,"Pooch, you absolutely correct. The fish seem to migrate to the south as the season goes by. We usually don't get up there until the second or third week of August because of other commitments. Yes, you may pick up several stragglers near Steamboat Narrows, but the larger population of fish have moved south of Manitoba Point to the mid-lake basins. This is a wide open area and you need to watch the weather very closely. If the wind starts to blow, you could looking at 7 footers in no time at all. It happened to me once and it is not fun."
4531097,Coyoteman,2016-02-09 14:09:00,209,When are you going to gullrock? I can maybe give you some pointers on some places to check out.
4531513,Stringbean,2016-02-09 16:23:00,279,"We will be up there during the last week of June. I'm just wonder if the walleyes will be set up on the underwater humps in that time frame. That usually doesn't happen until mid-July, but then again every year seems to be just a bit different."
