4547737,Mike Borger,2016-02-15 08:49:00,1554,An MNR biologist from that region told me Shoal Lake had shockingly good fishing for very large pike. Might be worth a look.http://shoallakelodge.net/the-fishery/
4547889,camp chef,2016-02-15 09:38:00,915,"What do you consider trophy Pike? Last year our group of 4 had 6 Pike in the 40 in, range on Rainy Lake."
4547897,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-15 09:40:00,8293,Looks very nice Mike. For some reason I couldn't click and open the pictures of the cabins. Also I noticed the pricing appears to be based on per person and not a particular cabin. I'll check back on it later.
4549145,prov1800,2016-02-15 17:09:00,5010,"Although there is good pike fishing in most of the lakes in the Vermilion bay area (2 1/2-3 hr)drive from internation falls.There are a couple that would stand out in my book.I would look at Northstar Lodge Resort.Only camp on about 25 miles of lake and river system.Excellent pike fishing, lots of 30-40""fish. I would check out Wabaskang Lake also, might look into Kingfisher Lodge.These two lakes both produce some good fishing."
4549417,bassnblast,2016-02-15 18:23:00,56,Was also going to recommend Shoal Lake. I've stayed at Crow Rock Lodge and Ash Rapids Lodge on LOTW and you can fish both lakes quite easily -- especially from Ash Rapids.
4550897,MN_Moose,2016-02-16 07:31:00,964,You might consider Jim's Caviar Camp. Southeast of Sioux Narrows. There is gravel road for a couple miles. http://jimscaviarcamp.com/
4560177,Timber Edge,2016-02-18 23:22:00,8,"Minnitaki Lake check out Timber Edge Camps 45 minutes north of Dryden, 12 miles south of Sioux Lookout AWESOME PIKE"
4560649,packpro,2016-02-19 07:34:00,695,"Nunguesser is at the far range of what you are looking to travel. There are three outfitters on that lake. Kevin Geary owns one of them. It is a very good Walleye lake, but Kevin guides and will mark a map for you targeting trophy Pike. Pike are his specialty. We were fishing next to him one day and watched him land a 48"" monster. I'm sure any of the outfitters on that lake can help you, but Kevin's place is called Anglers Kingdom. Loves to cast Suicks and other large baits into the weed flats, also uses sucker rigs if they go deep."
4560657,GBS,2016-02-19 07:35:00,2271,"If you'd at all consider adding more drive time, go to Grass River Lodge. Paved roads all the way.http://www.grassriverlodge.com/ My wife and I caught many each day in the mid-40's. To the point where something under 40 was just an irritation. My best was a 52"". Now they are getting to the 53+ range."
4560985,Mike Borger,2016-02-19 08:55:00,1554,Wow. Really?
4545929,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-14 16:41:00,8293,Looking for a drive to (paved roads only please) resort to fish for Trophy Pike. I like larger bodies of water with a good river inlet. Looking for something 2-4 hours drive from International Falls at the most. Accommodations do not need to be 5 star but leaky roofs and broken windows and screens won't work either. Idea's? Thank you.
4545977,Mike Borger,2016-02-14 16:48:00,1554,Lake Nipigon easily. You can launch your own boat and camp on one of the islands. Or maybe look at Onaman River Resort which has direct access into Nipigon:http://www.onamanriverresort.com/I'll just throw this one out there just for fun because it's waaay further than 4 hours from International Falls. BUT it's world class fishing for numbers of trophy pike and is a drive-to.http://grandslamlodge.com/
4546033,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-14 17:02:00,8293,Onamon looks interesting. Thank you.
4546057,rather-be-fishin,2016-02-14 17:09:00,429,Eagle Lake in Vermilion Bay has several resorts on it. Good roads all the way.
4546953,bigrutnut,2016-02-15 02:51:00,2,"I've been to Onaman River Resort. It definitely does not fit into the ""paved roads"" restriction."
4547145,Obabikon,2016-02-15 06:10:00,2370,Lake of the Woods has some amazing pike fishing. Focus on either Stevens' Bay area or Obabikon Lake.
4547369,That Minnesota guy,2016-02-15 07:35:00,8293,"Thank you, what month provides the best opportunity at a trophy size fish? Are there bigger rivers flowing into either?"
4547601,Guest,2016-02-15 08:11:00,0,Lake St. Joseph up by Pickle Lake.
4547681,NARDA 1,2016-02-15 08:32:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake, Vermilion Bay ON. 807-227-5262 owners name is Marcel. Paved roads except for a maintained gravel road the last 2.25 miles. Nice cabins and equipment, the American Plan you order off of a menu like a restaurant instead of everyone eating the same thing, great food. 40"" pike have been caught of the dock at night."
4547713,ftfarms,2016-02-15 08:42:00,444,I would second lake of the woods. Love the area around obabikon bay- milesbay out of morson. I would also say Wabaskang lake up by Perreault.
