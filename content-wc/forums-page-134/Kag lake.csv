6284528,adempsey2.0,2019-01-30 15:29:00,611,"17th Largest Fly-In Outpost Lake in OntarioThe surface area of Kagianagami Lake is 75 km2 (29 square miles) or 18,405 acres with a shoreline of 340 km (211 miles). The lake offers fishing for Walleye, Northern Pike, Lake Trout, Brook Trout and Whitefish. This is a remote lake with no direct road access. Kagianagami Lake is located north of Lake Nipigon and east of Wabakimi Provinical Park between Ogoki Reservoir and Ogoki Lake. The lake has a large central basin and two large connected bays, Humble and Big Trout Bays, at the southwest end of the lake. Water enters from several small tributaries and flows out at the northwest end through the Opichuan River. There is access to Van Poele Lake at the southeastern end of the lake and the Opichuan River is navigable for a large distance. There are two fly-in fishing outpost camps on the lake (red stars), one at the entrance to Humble Bay in the southwest that is operated by Twin Lakes Outfitters and the other at the northwest end at the entrance to the Opichuan River operated by Mattice Lake Outfitters. There is also a fly-in fishing resort (magenta star), Leuenbergerâ€™s Kag Lake Lodge, located on a large island near the Opichuan River entrance. Kagianagami lake is also accessible by the fly-in fishing outpost camps on Van Poele Lake, also operated by Twin Lakes Outfitters, and on the Opichuan River, which is operated by 7 Lake Wilderness Camps."

We are using MLO and they sent me a very nice, large (23""-30"") map. I am wondering if anyone who has fished here has any marked up maps for ""hot spots"" that they would be willing to share. Any info at all with be appreciated. Thanks in advance. PMs are fine."
