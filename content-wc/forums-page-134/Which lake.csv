6286468,Namegosikaa,2019-02-04 14:53:00,61,"I would pick Percy, two major inflows and and a few miles of river at east end. Nakina north has a nice big camp on the outflow of the east end beautiful spot. You should pm Chris Brock, he's fished all of them but kap, all would be great in the spring tho.... getting a opening might be tough"
6288388,acplumber,2019-02-11 04:53:00,80,I've been to Percy and its awesome. stayed with leuenbergers. everything ran/worked well when we were there. its not long trip in the boat to get to great fishing. its all around their island. and the one river is about 5 min ride. we want to go back!

Washi puts you on several nice rapids of the Albany (which require longer boat rides), but also has some good spots near the camp. We were at Percy and Kap more than 20 years ago and the details of those are foggy. For the Percy trip, we canoed in to the camp through O'Sullivan, Superb, and then the Little Current River and then flew out."

We fished it in the spring and I think a lot of the walleye were still in the river. The only problem was the river was the colour of chocolate milk and from what I've heard, it's usually chocolate milk in the spring."
