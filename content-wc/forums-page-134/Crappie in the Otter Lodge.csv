Jack had a play date with a buddy so I took Rowan from the Camp I work for out for another crack at some crappie. We were there for at least six hours, there would be a gap in the action for a whole hour sometimes before a bunch of fish would move in, just enough action to keep us there that long, or at least not brave the cold to move spots.* We had a great fish fry that evening, good times.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/FveXg07xgVM"
