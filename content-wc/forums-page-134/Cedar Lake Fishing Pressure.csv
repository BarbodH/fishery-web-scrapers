6284896,makejason,2019-01-31 11:15:00,2,"A group of of us (Cousins and Uncles) are heading up to Clark's late May this year. The talks of the lake getting ""pressure"" slightly worries me. I hope we get the full Canadian fishing experience. Any tips/tricks for early season? Thanks in advance. Jake"
6284920,Bill Krejca,2019-01-31 11:41:00,6107,"With 5 camps on the lake, it can get a little on the busy side, but 2019 will be my 5th Sep. trip,and it has always been enjoyable. My experience/observation over the years has been that crappie fishermen seem to be somewhat more tolerant of ""close-by neighbors"" than walleye fishermen. Within reason. Bill"
6284948,v-bay gord,2019-01-31 12:28:00,3168,Probably the most pressure you'll have is prov1800 pushing you out of your spots. Threatening to take a picture of him and posting it on WC should keep him at bay. Generally the late May timeframe guarantees there will be minimal pressure. Good luck.
6284958,BornToFish,2019-01-31 12:45:00,1224,"Greetings,I believe that I mentioned in an earlier post on this thread that I have considerable experience fishing on Perrault Lake. Cedar and Perrault Lakes are connected to each other by the easily navigable Cedar River. The boats would get highly concentrated on Perrault Lake during years when the spring weather is late. By this I mean that the boats will be where the fish are - in their spawning areas. I have fished in years where there was a LOT of boats fishing Ord River. In fact, there were years that you would marvel at the parade of boats coming down Cedar River from Cedar Lake, just to partake in the frenzy on Ord River. I don't know the spawning areas associated with Cedar Lake, so can't comment about how things are there.The boating congestion on Perrault Lake decreased rapidly when the walleyes left their spawning grounds. The walleyes simply followed the minnows along the shorelines away from the spawning areas, as they searched out new food sources in the warming waters. I've observed that this reduces the boating congestion as the walleyes can be widely spread out and on the move.Boating congestion can return in late July through September when the schools of walleyes stack up on off-shore humps/reefs. This is the time of the season when it's nice to know the location of as many humps/reefs as you can. It's also the time of the year when anglers can most easily learn the location of humps/reefs, as that is where most of the boats are!Jake: you might find the boats to be congested when you are there in May. Alternatively, the boats might be very dispersed around the lake. The difference between the two scenarios will be weather trends in April and May - snowmelt, rain, temperature and wind. These weather trends will dictate water temperature, which strongly influences walleyes in their seasonal movements.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6284970,prov1800,2019-01-31 13:09:00,5010,nothing keeps me at bay.lol.iam a lot better now that ism more mature but if a muskie lure ends up in your boat your defiantly to close.haha.i fish on a lot of lakes in spring and there all busy.cant be helped.theres areas better at that time and all camps sent there guests to them.i have to say I don't go to these areas.plenty of shoreline/bay spawners and you will do well.late May probably to early for crappie spawn.pre spawn yes.normally crappies are best second week of June.cedar is a good walleye lake.if your new you might need to fish the known spots and explore a bit to and have fun.
6286410,makejason,2019-02-04 11:44:00,2,Thanks so much for the responses! I am less concerned now about the pressure seeing as we will be on the lake for one of the first opening weeks of the year. Now it's the waiting game. Just 103 days until we are on the lake. Jake
6279702,ElectricSlide19,2019-01-16 17:12:00,147,"Hello all, was looking at Cedar Lake for next years trip as my dad really wants to get into Crappie along with walleyes and I want to spend a day or two fishing for Muskies. When talking with my uncle about a possible trip in September he told me we should rethink going to Cedar because all of the pressure it gets and that there are a ton of people all fishing the same spots. For those that have fished Cedar is this true? Thanks!"
6279716,HitmanSB,2019-01-16 18:11:00,10,"I fished Cedar in August 2015, and didn't see much traffic and fished the whole lake over the week, even one day up the channel to Perrault Lake. Caught small size walleyes with only a handful over 20, 22 big. Lots and lots of crappie action, especially around wood. Marked many musky along the North shore of the middle stretch. Better walleye action on the East arm. Heavy rain (7 on first night) and cold weather in 40's impacted a few days. If we got close to a camp, we would see boats but no one could read my T-shirt and was respectful."
6279758,jackpotjohnny48,2019-01-16 23:20:00,153,"I sent you a PM regarding Cedar. Please check your inbox, and feel free to reply if you have any additional questions. ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

6279834,IAranger,2019-01-17 08:21:00,352,Would love to hear the private info on this lake also as I was thinking about a trip in Sept this summer
6279872,prov1800,2019-01-17 09:32:00,5010,I do a lot of guidng on cedar weely.also guide on the other popular lakes in the vermilion bay area.allthough it seems all lakes end to have busier week than others it always seems to me there s lots of places o fish.its the camp spots that get crowds.pretty much all camps show there guests creates the crowds.but still plenty of fish can be caught at this places.east end o like is always the busiest and if you want crappies that's where you will need to go.there harder to find in summer but if you know the lake not a problem.as or the other species you won't have any problem hooking some fish.the end down by Clarke's camp is usually pretty quite as a lot of guys don't like fishing the clearer water but it's really good toward aug/Sep.some awesome muskie fishing to.mid lake always has good fishing all smmer long.its the least busy my book.great fishery and very capable on rough days.but I would not say it's that busy in Sept.butdo find that's when there are more muskie guys ripping around in the big boats as it is with all lakes.where are you planning to stay.
6280126,ElectricSlide19,2019-01-18 07:48:00,147,"Thank you all for the replies! Pro V we didn’t have a particular lodge in mind, I talked to the owner of cedar lake lodge at the show and really liked him. I think the main interest in the lake was do to the crappie population. So if anyone has suggestions for other lakes for crappie I’m all ears. Another option would be Obabikon out of Morson or Camp Narrows on Rainy"
6280150,prov1800,2019-01-18 08:54:00,5010,cedar does have a good crappie population as well as wabigoon and dinorwic lakes.wasnt aware that al rempel from cedar lake lodge was at any show.maybe you talked to Darrin from cedar lake camp.
6280162,Skywagon,2019-01-18 09:09:00,1106,"ElectricSlide19, from a local's prospective, I think a good numbers lake for the multiple species you are looking for, Cedar would be hard to beat."
6281166,rockape,2019-01-21 10:15:00,215,"I have fished Cedar for a total of 3 weeks on 3 trips. Haven't been there in a couple of years though. I don't crappie fish, but I always caught some jigging for walleyes. I always caught good sized walleyes there. Especially closer to sunset. Others seem to think or have experienced that the walleyes are small on Cedar. I didn't think so. I can say it is probably the easiest lake I have fished to catch a musky. Big ones too. And they are all over the system. Cedar Point Resort at the top middle of the lake is the best place to stay. Shorter boat rides to spots!"
