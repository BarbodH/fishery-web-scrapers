6289632,prov1800,2019-02-14 06:50:00,5010,"I've personally been to 3 outposts myself.Upper Wapesi and the adjoining Pusher lake and have been to Anishinabi Lake Lodge twice.The accomadations in my book were terrific,great cabins with bbq's and outdoor cookers the cook up your fish.Great docks and equipment.I don't count fish as you would need a clicker of some sort.Normally I just count out 10 dozen or so from the minnow cages that are attached to the dock.They bring in fresh minnows by plane every couple of days.which is a good thing as you go through them in a hurry.10 dozen on either upper wapesi and pusher will go fast.On my trip there with 4 guys we had to raid the minnow supply in pusher by noon as we were out of 20 dozen with the 2 boats.it was like that for our 3 days there.wapesi cabin can handle six guys easy with plenty of room.comfy furniture,great kitchen and huge living room.awesome fire pit for evening fires.whole place is powered by a Honda generator you can not here.if you go on there web site you will find there blog there are reports from every outpost they have and fishing reports from there guests."
6289636,prov1800,2019-02-14 06:59:00,5010,"Just like to add we caught a number of walleyes up to 27"" right out front of the cabin in upper wapesi on hump out there.it is now marked with a jug.Also coming out of the creek going into pusher lake we caught a number of silver pike which are kinda rare.we also caught a number of pike up to 36"".very easy to catch pike in both lakes.basically every cast."
6289768,kona77,2019-02-14 10:40:00,236,"I believe you asked about the Clarks awhile back on this site.. We have fished 4 of their outpost lakes ( Grace, Antenna, Bertrand and Kapikik) and this year we are trying Wright Lake. Our initial group of guys has now grown to three separate groups and we are all fishing different lakes this year. Here is a short breakdown on our experience. Grace Lake- Our first trip with Wayne/Karla after they purchased some outposts from Gawley's . Late spring and we delayed our trip a couple of days due to ice conditions. Walleye fishing on Grace is outstanding. After spending a few days getting to know the lake we could count on catching 100+ fish per boat each day. Last two days I would calculate that number to be 150+. If you look at the Clarks site you will see guys reporting catching thousands of fish per week on Grace. Antenna- One of the guys from our group loves to catch Pike so we selected this lake for years 2 and 3.. Pike fishing is outstanding and we caught 20-30 fish over 34"" and several over 40"".. My buddy still goes to Antenna every year. Walleye fishing is good but I would rate Grace a little better. We still had some 100+ days and you can usually catch fish right off the dock at night.Bertrand= Another lake known for bigger pike and we had our two best days ever on gators on Bertrand. Ended up with 7 fish over 40"" and numerous others over 34"". Walleye fishing is good on Bertrand and we had some 50-100 days. Once again you can catch walleyes right off the docks at night.Kapikik - Fished in 2017/2018. One phrase ""crazy good walleye"" fishing applies to Kapikik.. Have had numerous 100+ days (probably a few 200+ days). We also caught some decent gators on Kapikik. We were able to secure this spot on Kapikik the last two years due to a scheduling issue from another group. That group is able to come back this year and is the reason why we are fishing Wright in 2019. I have some good intel on Wright and am looking forward to another great trip. You can also see 3-4 years of fishing reports on their various lakes on their website.. They now have 15-20 outpost lakes so they have a lot of options. I have talked to numerous other groups (coming and going) at the airbase on Cedar before our flights and have never encountered a group that was not happy with their fishing trip.I have replied to several other threads and private messages thru Walleye Central about the Clarks. Besides the free minnows and bottle water they always keep their cabins and equipment in good shape.. Our group has used numerous other outfitters in Ont/Manitoba (25+ trips). Some a lot better than others but Wayne/Karla/Meagan/Chris etc are at the top of our list for the service and value they provide to our group."
6289788,prov1800,2019-02-14 11:19:00,5010,That's a great true report.iam very fortunate to be guiding 2 moose hunters in Sept on Wright lake and will give a report after the hunt on fishing there in mid Sept.iam sure it's going to be real good.
6290076,kona77,2019-02-15 08:08:00,236,Prov1800- Will let you know if we see any moose on our trip (1st week of June). We did see moose on both our trips to Antenna and a buddy has also seen them there the last two years (cows and calves).. Always look forward to seeing/exploring new water and I know we will have a good trip. Hoping the water levels recover so we can get to Granite Boss and Kaminskag.Guys I have talked to have done pretty well on those two portage lakes.
6290078,prov1800,2019-02-15 08:21:00,5010,thx appreciate the info.wayne is going to bring me and my wife up there in later summer so I can check the area out.of course will bringing fishing gear lol.maybe ill bring my fish counter along.i usually cant even remember to click it.lol.
