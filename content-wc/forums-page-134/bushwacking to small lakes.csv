6285424,jambi,2019-02-01 15:46:00,504,Considering bushwacking to some small lakes near our fly-in. I know some lakes are dead of fish; and some could hold game fish. Is a 20 acre lake too small to mess with? How about 100 acre lake?
6285468,WiRiver,2019-02-01 17:45:00,13,"Years ago in my younger days we used to drag a 12' boat from logging roads into bush lakes near Ear Falls. From my experience as long as the lake had a river or creek running in or out the lake had fish. Small lakes with no water in or out had very few fish, Bigger lakes with no running water in or out had some fish. If you have the ambition to bushwack could be worth looking at Google Earth and check for lakes with running water near by. Good Luck we always had an interesting day when we went into the bush."

Current movement is a big factor in sustaining a fish population over the winter,as shallow bodies of water tend to freeze to the bottom,which is usually not a good thing. I have hiked to some neat looking backwaters, only to find nothing. Bill"

Before just randomly dumping your boat / canoe into a random lake, you may want to check out the Ontario MNR ""Fish ON"" website. You can click on each lake, and it will tell you what species of fish are in the lake, and sometimes it will even tell you the size of the lake as well as maximum depth. Note: The info isn't 100% accurate for every single lake, but it's a good starting point. For example, I have found some lakes that were listed as only having northern pike and lake trout as the gamefish species. But when I fished these lakes, I also found that the lake contained smallmouth bass (despite the fact that the FISH ON site had failed to list smallmouth). So, it's not 100% perfect, infallible information. But it's a good start.

6286586,fsz,2019-02-05 05:40:00,144,"I agree with the others. Check Fish ON-line for species present it is pretty accurate although not 100%. It also has satellite view where you can see islands, obvious shallow spots/reefs, neck downs, etc. Depth is important, as well as the lakes natural dissolved oxygen. There are some pretty small lakes that are know to have brookies (in many, but not all cases, stocked) and they do fine. Many smaller type lakes that are relatively shallow may have pike only, this seems to be more common if there is no or little inflowing water. In general, for walleye and pike fish are going to be smaller on smaller water but numbers can be higher and/or easier to locate. It seems to me in the best ""numbers lakes"" for pike often the walleye are low in numbers or not present. These lakes you may get huge numbers of pike 24-28"" but larger ones can be rare. There are good walleye lakes that are small with no inflow, but you normally won't hear about those small lakes only stay good because of ultra low fishing pressure. However, since you are bushwacking from a fly in lake, hopefully the outfitter should have some knowledge of the area lakes after all to an extent that is part of what you are paying for."
