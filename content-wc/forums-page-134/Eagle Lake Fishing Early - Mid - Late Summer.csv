We've always planned our trips around the 1st week of August. This typically means really nice weather, but the walleye are typically rather deep, and I think the same can be said for the bigger pike. We've always had decent luck, but I am curious as what could be expected in June / July. I just wanted to have others weigh in on what the biggest differences are between fishing in June, as compared to July, and August."
6288672,prov1800,2019-02-11 16:13:00,5010,From my experience fishing on Eagle Lake the only difference is th depth you would fish in.As a guide I hàve to know how to fish a number of lakes from opener till close to freeze up.wether iam fishing early or later really doesn't matter still catch a bunch of fish.Earlty season is real productive though.Walleyes have just gone through there spawn and rested a bit and become super hungry.With all baitfish spawning it's defiantly a frenzy in the shallows.Ive found this time of year the easiest to fish in the 2 ft and 6 ft depth for sometimes a month.very fast action and enjoyable fishing being able to cast out and jig back to the boat.Later in July/Aug it's more of a verticle presentation over deeper water.Still good action but there's mores days of slower fishing associated with vertical presentations.When that happens I get back to shallower water and weed beds.Probably going deeper might also get a few more fish but at the same time you would be killing them.So every season in my book is great.its all about water temps and the right presentations for the right time of the year.Right now Iam fishing à 20 ft spot ice fishing and doing real good.But fairly soon I will have to move and find them on there way toward there spawning beds.Then it starts all over aģain.
6288812,BornToFish,2019-02-12 07:09:00,1224,"Greetings, There's a LOT of wisdom in Prov1800's comments!! Fish have seasonal migrations. They will be in their spawning grounds every spring. They then move along the shorelines as the water warms. Then they move out to near-shore structure as the water continues to warm. Then, they move out to off-shore structure where they remain until it's time to return to the spawning grounds. I have found that fish eat (more-or-less) every day. Thus, it's important to pick a body of water that has a good population of the fish that the angler wants to target. What changes throughout the season is that anglers must change where and how he/she fishes. I've observed over the years that many anglers are more comfortable fishing shorelines during the opening weeks of the season, as they have a rock or tree on the shore that they can relate to. Boat control is generally not as critical as it can be later in the season. These anglers are often not comfortable fishing a rock hump in the middle of the lake as there isn't anything for the angler to really look at besides more water. Thus, these anglers often comment that the springtime bite is ""best"" as they are within their comfort zone and do well fishing. I will offer an observation that builds on Prov1800's comments. I've noticed that the fish are often on the move during the opening weeks of the season. I might do very well during an afternoon session along one particular stretch of shoreline, and then strike out the following morning in the same place. I believe that it all comes down to finding the warmest water temperatures as that is where the fish's food (e.g. minnows) will be, as well as their preferred water temperature. I've observed that weather (and especially wind) can quickly and dramatically change the fishing in the early season. I prefer to fish in late season as the fish tend to be bunched up on off-shore structure. I'm thinking ""game-on"" when I pull up to a rock hump and catch one walleye, as I then likely know where they all are. The fish will likely not move, and if they do, it likely won't be very far away. As Prov1800 pointed out, it might take a while to catch the first fish. I suspect the Original Poster has experience on Eagle Lake and is comfortable with the populations of the fish he/she targets. Again, the fish will eat on a regular basis. The angler just needs to adjust the where and how of fishing to the point that the fish are at during their seasonal migration. That is, the Original Poster may not want to fish during June where and how he/she would be fishing in early August. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6288840,rosh1,2019-02-12 08:02:00,275,"As the 2 have said the fish migrate. If you are use to fishing in aug and fish are close to where you stay,keep fishing there. When we open the cottage up in may, have about 1/2 hour boat ride to where the fish are. As the water warms up the fish move closer to us. So july, aug,sept only a few minutes to fish. I always feel for the people that are in guide boats that have come over 30 min ride to fish in july. They could have picked a camp only 5 mins away and fished for an hour longer that day."
6288936,v-bay gord,2019-02-12 11:25:00,3168,"rosh, while agree with what you are observing, is it a ""choice"" or a ""necessity"". I particularly appreciate the fact that many camps send their guests a long distance away to fish. Keeps things peaceful where I like to fish!"
6288948,rosh1,2019-02-12 11:54:00,275,"Gord good question, think some guides like driving boats more then baiting hooks."
6289074,prov1800,2019-02-12 16:30:00,5010,Most guides will bring you to good fishing so if they have to travell a bit then so be it.thats there job.there might be some fish closer by I always ask my guests what the pleasure is.i guide in the east end of eagle.in my book the best place to fish.i guide lots for north shore lodge so I don't normally go much further than 5 miles from camp to catch all the fish we need in a day.from what I see daily is a lot of guide boats that travell the 20-25 miles from the vermilion bay area.not saying there isn't any fish on the north end nust more in the east end that goes for muskies to.i used to guide in North end and used to make the big trip a couple of times during the week.not that I just wanted to take any people for a boat ride.if I fished the West arm from vermilion bay that's quite the trip to.iam about catching fish and would take my guests where I needed to.
6289110,v-bay gord,2019-02-12 17:37:00,3168,"I do agree that if you're driving 25 miles to fish each day then you would be better served staying at a lodge closer to where you fish. I'm sure some anglers figure that out pretty quick, which is probably the reason certain lodges spend a lot of money on promotion. Then again some people enjoy the scenery and the boat ride......special ""bonding time"" with your guide!"
