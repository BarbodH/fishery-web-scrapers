6287650,BornToFish,2019-02-08 10:52:00,1224,"Greetings, Pooch: You mentioned under the HGT forum that you coated your gold glitter jigs with a Lacquer from Rust-Oleum. You mentioned that it was a high lustre, clear lacquer finish, with the model number of 1906830. I used it to coat some jigs that I made and it worked great. I just ordered some willow leaf blades from LurePartsOnline that are in a matt finish and NOT clear coated. I had to order these non-coated blades in order to get the colors and sizes of blades that I wanted. I will use these blades to assemble some deep running musky/pike bucktails. I want to clear coat the blades to minimize chipping of the paint on the blades. What do you think of using the Rust-Oleum 1906830 clear lacquer finish to clear coat the blades? Is there a better choice of clear coating material? Kindest regards...."
6287664,Pooch,2019-02-08 11:27:00,4618,"There are probably better clear coats out there, but the lacquer is quick, easy and dries fast.I paint a lot of my own spinner blades using water based paints. I clear coat them with the same lacquer, BUT you have to make sure the base colors are really, really cured and then just mist the clear coat on very lightly the first coat. Let it cure overnight then hit it once more.Lacquer attacks most any other paint if it goes on wet. I would just try (or ""sacrifice"") one blade to see how it reacts. On the HGT page several guys mention different epoxies that they use. I'm uneasy with anything with a lot of fumes. Especially in my basement fishing bench area. I try to keep it simple since few blades last more than a day before getting bit off. Long term endurance isn't important to me.Good luck and post your results for the rest of us to drool mover.Pooch"
6287702,BornToFish,2019-02-08 13:37:00,1224,"Greetings, Pooch: I sincerely thank you for the prompt reply. I very much wanted to tap into your experience in lure painting and finishing as you have considerable experience and credibility on this forum. I purchased a variety of colors and sizes of the willow-leaf blades from LurePartsOnline. I have no idea as to what type of paint is used in making the blades. Each code comes in a package of ten blades. Thus, sacrificing a few of the blades during experiments is not a problem! I chatted with Mike at CS Coatings in Wausau, WI. They make and sell a popular line of jig paints that are readily available in Wisconsin. He said that their Clear Vinyl Lure & Jig Finish is made with an organic solvent. He said that this clear coat might work - depending upon the type of paint used on the blade. I already have a bottle of this in the basement - left over from an earlier project. Mike said their Clear Seal-Coat Finish is made with water as the solvent and may work to clear coat the blade. Mike said that one or the other of the CS clear coats will very likely work to clear coat the blades - no matter what paint was used on the blades. The blades are to arrive on Monday afternoon. I will conduct an experiment with the CS Vinyl Lure & Jig Finish (organic solvent) and the Rust-Oleum high lustre Lacquer and see if they will work or just dissolve the paint. I will look for the water-based clear coat if the above coatings do not work. Again, thanks for your prompt response. I think that I have a good plan to follow. Kindest regards...."
6287764,Pooch,2019-02-08 15:55:00,4618,"You know the problem (for me, maybe my wife) with Lure Parts Online? They are only just over an hour drive from my place. On occasion when I'm going to be in that area, I'll put in an order and just stop by and pick it up. Great group of folks.There is no way they could ever have a retail outlet store. Just thousands upon thousands of small items in bins. No idea how they keep track of inventory.Talk about a candy store... ye-ow!Post pictures.Pooch"
6290172,BornToFish,2019-02-15 11:29:00,1224,"Greetings,I completed three prototypes of an in-line spinner bait that I intend to try in the upcoming season. A picture of these baits is (hopefully) presented below.I was looking for a bucktail to use for northern pike over deep water rock humps. I wanted something with a fairly large profile that will run about ten feet down in the water column. The bucktails weigh about 2.5 ounces each.The matte-finished, willow-leaf blades from Lure Parts Online were clear-coated with CS Seal-Coat (aqueous base). The keel sinkers at the front of the lure came from Moore's Lures. The treble hook is a VMC 9650 black nickel in size 5/0. The soft plastic is an Esox Assault ""Killer Tail"". Everything else is pretty much stock components.The bucktails in the picture may remind some of you of the Musky-Houn from the 1940s and 1950s, as this lure was the inspiration for my efforts.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6290226,Pooch,2019-02-15 13:51:00,4618,"Those are really professional looking and good color combos. The blue grabs me as it is one of my go to colors. How could any self respecting toothy not be fooled?Cutting board is sharp, too. Did you make that?Before the end of summer, the rest of us want to see pictures with a big Pike on the business end of them. You surely know how broken heart'd your gonna be should you lose one of them...It never ceases to amaze me at the skill sets people on WC possess.Pooch"
6290260,BornToFish,2019-02-15 15:35:00,1224,"Greetings, Pooch: I sincerely thank you for the very kind words! The lakes that I am now fishing have shiners and spot-tail minnows as the forage base, in addition to ciscoe and whitefish. Because of that, blue anything has been a good color scheme. I almost always have white in my lures somewhere, to resemble the belly of a baitfish. I liked the gold keel sinker and yellow hackle as a contrast color for the blue. I have had some folks comment that my lures sometimes are ""too good"". That is, they will get trashed. Well, I have had some lures get worked over pretty well over the years. I just take them home and rebuild them. I guess that I would rather have a lure get trashed than remain good looking for too long! I came up with another idea when I was snapping the picture! There will be an order going out to Moore's Lures this weekend. The lure will feature a weighted treble, a trailing treble, a bucktail lure tag and the keel sinker. I will try to update the thread with another picture in a week or so. I'm thinking these blade baits will work well, but time will tell. I've been catching many nice pike on deep water humps over the years. I've been using crankbaits and rubber baits with multiple treble hooks. They are a pain to dig out of unhappy pike, especially when only a part of the wire leader is sticking out of the mouth. Thus, I was thinking that a heavy, big profile bucktail with a single treble might work well. I just happened to remember the old Musky Houn from the 1930s to 1960s. I sort of made the cutting board. I have a good fishing friend that is a highly skilled wood worker. We worked together in his shop to make a set of three cutting boards from ash, hard maple, black walnut, Brazilian walnut and purpleheart. We made the board shown in the picture, and a narrower board for filleting fish and cutting bread. We also made a much larger and thicker board that I use when making bread. This board weighs around forty pounds. It doesn't move when I knead the bread! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6290282,Bill Krejca,2019-02-15 16:48:00,6107,"Good looking baits! Several comments: Yeah, the baits do remind me of the Musky-Houn from years past, especially the weight, lots of great fish taken on them.. I have never given much thought to protecting the finish on spinner blades. They can get a bit scratched up from teeth and hitting rocks, but when they are spinning, the imperfections are probably not real visible to the fish. But..part of the joy of making your own stuff is ending up with a cool product, so I fully understand the pride which can go into producing a ""masterpiece"" and hats off to all who can produce a quality bait. Re: hooks - Big baits for big fish of the past have established a culture of the necessity for huge trebles, sometimes several. I have found that a single large enough hook will produce as well for me, perhaps even better because the force exerted in setting the hook does not have to be distributed over more than one penetrating point. I have also found that I seem to be able to pull the bait through more snags. Again, nice job on the baits, it is fun to look at others' creations during the winter doldrums. Bill"
6290306,BornToFish,2019-02-15 19:44:00,1224,"Greetings,Bill: Thank you for the reply and kind words!I wanted to make the lures with a willow blade as I want minimal ""lift"" as the lure comes through the water. I want the lure to run fairly deep - say around ten feet down in the water column.The best combination of size + colors for willow blades that I could find was from Lure Parts Online. These blades come without anything such as a clear coat to protect the integrity of the paint. The paint is on both sides of the blade. Experience has shown me that the un-protected paints gets chipped very easily - especially along the edges of the blade. I think most of this chipping of the paint takes place when the blade clanks against lure bodies.I learned that the CS Seal-Coat provides a good clear coat from an aqueous solution. This means there is no ""stink"" from an organic solvent. I don't mind using vinyl type paints outside during the summer, but won't tolerate the ""stink"" inside the house during the winter.Again, thanks for sharing your thoughts.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
