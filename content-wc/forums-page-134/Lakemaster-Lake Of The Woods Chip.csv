With 1 foot contours, you can really see the bottom and find small humps that would be otherwise invisible. I think I bought mine at Scheels. Sorry, mine's not for sale though. Be advised that the northern part of the lake is not in high-def (1 foot contours). At least it wasn't when I bought my card."
