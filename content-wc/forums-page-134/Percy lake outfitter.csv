Motors were great, one boat leaked a bit and had to be bailed out once a day (maybe chris.brock hit a rock before I got there?). Mosquitos were fierce when we arrived after a rain but cleared up after a couple sunny days. Got good numbers, not a lot of big fish, biggest was 27"". The fish are FAT! Two fish each and side dishes were enough to feed us (1 16yo, 3 adults) except the 6' 11"" college basketball player. There are beds for 12 people and we all found one that suited us. The pump water in the cabin comes straight out of the lake and can be pretty dirty if the water is stirred up, plan to pre-filter if you are going to take your own filtration system. Coffee filters in a funnel work well. Halfmoon gave me some good tips and I learned a bit more while I was there, would be willing to pass them on."
