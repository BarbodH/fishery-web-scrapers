6289272,rockape,2019-02-13 08:15:00,215,"I've hit two deer in the last 17 years. First one was about 1:30am around Black River Falls. Little deer and a glance off the front left headlight. Some damage to the driver door, but we went onward. About 3 years ago, we hit a big doe head on on 53 around Spooner. 1:30am. Truck undrivable. TOTALLY SUCKED. Stranded 700 miles from home with $10k in gear in the middle of nowhere. Advice - DON'T EVER LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU. What a long trip home and a pain in the *** getting the rig fixed in Minnesota. Lots of DUMB drives on 72 in the middle of the night. Never again. Moose city."
6289294,fishmanric,2019-02-13 08:52:00,219,Typically drive the 750 miles in 11 or 12 hours straight to camp. Usually leave around 3am in the morning from southeast Wisconsin. Now my trips will be originating from central Florida and haven't figured the logistics just yet. I know I won't be driving 2000 miles straight through.
6289858,bobbylfishermon,2019-02-14 14:25:00,241,"I drive 850 miles to Indian Lake Lodge ( for the last 20 years) . Finally got the wife to retire, soooo we're staying the month of May, month in July and the month of September - mid October, we get along great with the owners and we LOVE Canada and the people!!!! WAY TO BIZARE here in the states and we worked our butts off, so we can do this, and we both have our health sooooo we're out of here!!!! Stay safe out there!"
6289890,bobbylfishermon,2019-02-14 16:06:00,241,Thank You LORD !!! Thank you Canada!
6286908,Mojo-NC,2019-02-06 06:59:00,1929,"My group resides fairly close to your group around Raleigh/Durham/Chapel Hill, NC. We leave our boats at home and fly to either INL or Winnipeg. We pick up our rental car/truck/van, get groceries, and head to Dryden to spend the night. We finish our drive the following morning, which is about another 2 hours drive to arrive at camp at the requested check-in time. It is still a long day on Day 1 because we have to be at the airport for a 6:30 AM EDT flight and we don't usually arrive Dryden until around 5:00 PM CDT. On our way home we leave the camp early and drive straight to the airport for an afternoon flight home. Another long day but at least we're not driving for 23-24 hours."
6287080,NARDA 1,2019-02-06 15:26:00,636,Here is the number for the Northside Motel in Vermilion Bay if that helps you out. 807-227-5339
6287100,bobg5808,2019-02-06 16:41:00,5,"Mojo I know what you mean about the long drive. On the way up everyone will be pretty pumped up so we should be okay.On the return trip we may need to take a few days to get back.Everyone is retired so no time constraints. Plan on driving till we get tired or thirsty.Narda, thanks for the info.That may well be the best choice after a week in an outpost. I imagine I should make reservations sooner than later as we are doing a Friday to Friday trip.Of course it's all contingent on whether or not big foot gets us at Snelgrove&#x1f600;"
6287174,NARDA 1,2019-02-06 22:15:00,636,Sent you a PM.
6287440,kzoofisher,2019-02-07 17:08:00,5144,"I'd plan on whatever is the maximum time you think is an easy drive (4,6,8 hrs?) and look for a hotel in that area. We always take it easy the last night so we're well rested for the drive home and not foggy so we don't leave anything important behind. We do plan the trip so we aren't driving after dark in moose country. I don't mind driving and prefer to go straight through for anything under 18 hours but some of the guys I go with hate anything over 10 hours. Compromising makes a nice trip for everyone."
6287574,rockape,2019-02-08 07:08:00,215,"I live in Indianapolis, so it is about 1100 miles to Sioux Lookout or the Vermilion Bay area. We would drive straight through for years. TOTALLY STUPID. We would get to Sioux Lookout at about 7am. Throw our crap in the cabin, rig up our rods, and go fish! Total all nighter. BRUTAL. And DUMB! We get a motel room in Orr or INTL now. It is nice to be fresh to fish. Get a good night's sleep and finish off the last 4-5 hours in the morning. I need to send a thank you to RAY from Cedar Point Resort. One year we left at like 10:30pm to drive home. Totally driving in the dark on the 502. The next year, he sat us down ant told us it isn't if, it is when you hit a moose. He made me a believer! We do drive straight through on the way home. We leave about 4:30am so there is some decent sunlight. I get home about midnight. Pretty long day, but SAFE!"
6288224,rzep,2019-02-10 11:56:00,1196,"My last trip from Chicago area to Red Lake included overnight close to the I. Falls on the way up. Cant recall exactly why but on the way back , I drove straight thru with short food/bathroom breaks. I dont think I will do that again."
6288598,Whopper,2019-02-11 13:21:00,340,"On the way up from southwest Ohio to Red Lake I stop and spend the night in International Falls, the next day 4 to 5 hours and I'm fresh. I've done the 71, 502 and the 105 at night numerous times all with near misses and won't do again if possible. I even done the 527 north of Thunder Bay to Armstrong at night and won't do it anymore either. On the way home I go straight through and even that is crap shoot anymore, hit a deer right in the middle of Janesville at 2am and another near miss right at the airport in the windy city. The last two years I now stop at my place in northeast Indiana, even then the earliest I've arrived is about 1am on the returned trip. Been doing it for years but seriously thinking about breaking up the return trip in the future for safety reasons."
6288654,PA troutguy,2019-02-11 15:01:00,58,"It takes me three days to make Sioux Lookout on the way up. I stop in Illinois after about 13 hours, Ifalls the next night and 4-5 hours in the last day. I stop for groceries in Virginia, MN. I am towing a boat and don't run faster than 65 mph. Two days on the way home, no grocery stop total drive time each way about 27 hours. I do not drive 502 at night. Have dodged enough moose on 502 and 72 in the day time. I run I-80 to I-39, not dealing with Chicago traffic dragging a boat."
6289094,jbb1069,2019-02-12 17:13:00,33,"I departed late and ended up driving 502 between 200 and 430 in the morning one trip. Had a near miss with a bull moose I never even saw and later came around blind corner and did an emergency 4 wheel skid ending about 10 ft from a massive bull moose and 2 cows who just GLARED at us. Fortunately a local semi happened by with mega zillion watt floodlights above the cab and a moose catcher bar on the front, he lit up the entire horizon. I just followed him the rest of the way. When we stopped for fuel in Dryden we heard he took out a mountain lion before passing us on the 502. I have a nephew who moved from Calgary to southern Ontario and made the bad decision of travelling the 502 at night. He had a bull moose come out of a ravine and ran into his Ram pickup, TWICE, First time ...he took out the passenger mirror and cracked the windshield, which just seemed to piss him off.......second try he poked his rack through the closed passenger window glass and all and scratched up the interior. I will not ever again drive 502 at night. P.S. We drive from Port Huron Mi.to Ear Falls. Our overnight stop is usually at Eveleth Minnesota"
6286672,bobg5808,2019-02-05 11:25:00,5,"Taking my first trip to Canada. Was wondering how many hours you all drive after a week at a fly in camp?There will be 5 of us and it's about a 23 hour trip home.Are you pretty well beat and just drive a short distance or try to rack up a lot of miles that first day?We are not spring chickens or would drive the entire distance like we use to on trips.Think I have read the entire Canada section, thanks for all that I have learned so far.Bob"
6286686,Jeler,2019-02-05 12:02:00,92,"Bob,That's quite a drive you'll have going there. Granted on the way up to your fly in the adrenaline and excitement could take you a long ways. But my wife and I like to take our time and not rush it, both going and coming home. We have close friends in Northern MN we always stay overnight with, then leisurely take our time across the border to camp or a close by motel to get ready for our next morning flight to the outpost. Not spring chickens here either and any night driving is avoided. Granted we only have a 15-16 hour total drive, but no way could we do it 1 day anymore. Have fun !"
6286708,Ogoki,2019-02-05 12:43:00,291,"We now , after doing the 21 hour drive straight thru vs staying over is a no brainer. We stay over , period . We are fortunate enough to have a cabin in northern Michigan . Go there the first night . Finish trip the next day . Even before we bought our place in Michigan ,we would at least leave by noon the first day and get 40% of the trip out of the way . Hard to get rest while someone else even driving . Plus the chance of hitting a bear or moose at night ,is not what anyone wants . Figuring the cost of the total trip, a motel room is only a small part of the trip . Being pumped up and driving straight thru ,even being young ,will catch up . I am saying this with over 60 long trips behind me . Feel better and enjoy trip better . There was a long thread about this ,a while back . Many feel the same as I do. I go on a canoe trip with some friends . They have plenty ,but are just flat out too cheap to stay over. To each their own . When on the canoe trip ,after driving all night and then paddling 10 miles the next day , the whole group is whipped . Enjoy yourself , you are on vacation ."
6286716,btyreprich,2019-02-05 13:13:00,1067,"We used to drive from our home in suburban Chicago to Pickle Lake to fish Lake St Joseph. 975 miles one way. At that time, we were younger and drove straight through. We now prefer to fish Lac Seul out of Ear Falls and now do an over night stay in International Falls. I urge you to do an overnight stay on the way up - dangerous to drive in Canada at night what with the wild life on the side of roads. On the way back, you could always grab a room on Priceline from your phone if you are too tired to drive safely home. 23 hours is a long way!"
6286734,bobg5808,2019-02-05 14:04:00,5,Thanks We are definitely driving daytime for the most part.Leaving Northern Virginia (right outside the swamp) early am and stop near Elverth for the night. Then about 5 hours the next day to Dryden Holiday Inn for a good nights rest.Then to Clark's the next morning. Just wanted to see if we should shoot for Elverth or spend the night in Dryden on the return. From what I've read don't want to be on Rt 502 at night
6286738,BornToFish,2019-02-05 14:22:00,1224,"Greetings,Give careful consideration to the earlier post by Btyreprich!!!! Nothing good will ever come out of an encounter with a moose on the highway! There is only one thought that will go through your mind if you see a moose in your headlights: ""Oh $hit, just how bad am I going to lose?"". This is far more common than many folks realize.There are some other factors to consider for your travel home. Are you the kind of folks that fish from first light to last light? If so, you might be worn down tired at the end of your week of fishing, such that you start driving while tired. Folks in your group might have a touch of air-sickness if your flight to the base is long or you encounter rough weather. You might need some quiet time before driving, just to regain your equilibrium.You might also be dealing with wet clothes if you pack your raingear and then encounter rain while packing the plane. This could make for a long day of driving.You may not get back to the base until afternoon if your pickup is scheduled late in the morning or due to weather. All of the above things have happened to me at one time or another. Thus, I encourage you to not plan on pushing things too hard the first day of your return trip. You might want to have several potential spots to overnight in mind, so that you can check on-the-fly for hotel availability.I believe there is only one major highway the runs east-west in Canada. That is the Trans-Canada (Hwy 17). You will be surprised as to how fast the hotel rooms fill up on this highway, even during the week.Kindest regards......"
6286740,x4flatfish,2019-02-05 14:23:00,319,"I would think it depends on what time you get back to your trucks/cars. I would not want to be on 502 at night. However that is only an 1 1/2 hour trip. If I could make it to Intl. Falls before dark I would probably be inclined to do that, and then make plans from there..."
6286758,bobg5808,2019-02-05 15:16:00,5,"Thanks everyone Sounds like the best plan will be to play it by ear on the trip home with all the variables. I just know we won't be driving at night or when we're tired.I'm sure I'll have more time questions as it gets closer to August. Been getting ready for this trip, I need to start gearing up for the saltwater flatfish!Thanks again Bob"
6286760,Jeler,2019-02-05 15:19:00,92,"Excellent advise a moose in the headlights is something you will never forget! I've had them running along side of me where I could reach out and touch them out the drivers side window-not fun for either you or the Moose!Our Drive is semi similar (except much shorter) to yours Bob5808, we drive up to Cook/Lake Vermillion area, spend an evening with great friends. Then leave mid-morning for Vermilion Bay. Spending the night after a 5 hour drive to Vermilion Bay, we then have a short drive to Clark's! Leaving August 29th for Una Lake, it can't get here fast enough!"
6286874,Jim Clark,2019-02-06 03:24:00,9,No flatfish for you. Overnite in Drydden on departure day.
