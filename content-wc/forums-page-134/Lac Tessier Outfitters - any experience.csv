He was 82 at the time and had made at least one and often 2 trips there every year for about 30 consecutive years. It has been my goal to make a yearly walleye trip also and am exploring drive-in options. I would like to stick with Quebec but distance and dirt roads are not a problem.We stayed with Hibou outfitters and at that time it was still under the old owners. The price, cabins and staff were great. The boats were ok but my biggest complaint was the boat ride to get to decent fishing. I was hoping that someone may have some experience with Lac Tessier outfitters which is located close to Clova. I found a mention of them from a staff write in an Outdoor Canada magazine last year. From the website the camp looks well kept and I have emailed the owner who seems very nice. The lake sounds to be a more manageable size and is in the area where I would like to go.I have note been able to find any reviews about the outfitter or lake when searching the internet. I would be looking at going in mid to late June. Has anyone stayed here or have any into on the lake? Thank you."
