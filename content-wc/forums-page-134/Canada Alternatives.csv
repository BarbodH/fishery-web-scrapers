6281640,jgregory,2019-01-22 12:37:00,1,"Hi All,I have been going to different fly in outpost camps to lakes through Lake Bertholet in Quebec(what a great operation they run) every year with my dad since 1988. He turned 86 this year and is still in good shape but is starting to have some medical issues and this past August we had to head to an emergency room up there and come home early. I know we are never going to get that kind of experience closer to home but I was wondering if anyone had ideas about other options that would be drivable from NJ (was thinking PA-NY-NH-VT-ME). Would be looking for an outfitter that had basic cabins on a lake. We have had anywhere from 3-8 people in our group. Flexible on the size of the lake but I don't think we would want to fish on something as big as the Great Lakes. Also flexible on the type of fishing but we are most familiar with jigging and trolling for walleye and pike. It does not need to be so close to a hospital- I can research that part- but the two issues with the fly in camp in Quebec is that we had to wait for a flight out and then negotiate the Canadian Health Care system with US Health Insurance. Again, I know we are not going to get the same experience but just looking to modify this so my dad can still participate and spend time with us. I appreciate any ideas that people can share.Thanks,John"

6281660,bthomas3333,2019-01-22 14:12:00,465,Couple of ideas but these are not in the states you mention...Maybe too much travel?Detroit River has some pretty great walleye fishing esp early SpringLake St Clair has some pretty good walleye fishing and muskie action nearly all year round.Devil's Lake ND has what you are used to. Cabins and access to Walleye and Pike fishing.There are also options around Mille Lac Lake in Minnesota for Walleye / Pike / SmalliesIt sounds like the travel is the bigger issue than access to hospitals so these may be too far to travel?B-
6281664,5richards,2019-01-22 14:20:00,131,"Lake Champlain is a good option, but your fishing would be centered around Bass and Pike --- The Bass are plentiful and the pike less numerous than their cousins in Canada."
6281922,retire55,2019-01-23 08:24:00,1029,"Our group of seniors always fish Quebec and we have been subscribing to Air Medic - see https://www.airmedic.net/en/ for evacuation services (helicopter) if required. OK, we've been fortunate and have never had to avail ourselves of Air Medic services and we're very happy about that. Costs are quite reasonable for the peace of mind."
6282002,vteye3,2019-01-23 10:50:00,496,"Champlain has top notch sm bass, excellent pike, close to NJ relatively speaking and top notch health care. I would consider Holiday Harbor resort in North Hero island. A few walleyes are caught but more of a bass/pike lake. Lake trout/ landlocked salmon are available in May/June."

6283302,jfaisten,2019-01-28 04:19:00,1060,"bthomas3333 hit the nail on the head. It's hard to beat the Detroit River for walleye's in the early spring and later, smallmouth as well as muskie's in Lake Saint Clair. The fishing is outstanding and there are lots of places to stay as well as world class medical facilities. I'd be happy to share what I know about Detroit River walleye fishing. Good luck"
6283668,beer slayer,2019-01-28 18:02:00,33,"Fellow NJ Guy here, 81 north through Scranton-Binghampton- Syracuse-Watertown. Lots of spots, really nice cabins on Wesley Island USA. Dang good Pike Fishing, way, way cheaper, and 6 hr. ride. And ya can cross the beautiful bridge into Canada to get the good Beer! Good Luck. Sure respect and think it's great to be Fishin with your Dad"
6285196,MrSimon,2019-02-01 06:45:00,922,"I agree with Beer Slayer, the St. Lawrence River is truly a special fishery. It's gigantic. It's beautiful. And it has world class smallmouth, walleye, and muskie fishing. WORLD. CLASS. And the pike fishing is good too if you can find them. Not to mention carp, perch, largemouth, catfish etc. There are countless little camps and cottages all up and down the river, on both sides. There are two drawbacks though. First, it's a massive body of water, and deep. Finding the fish is not always easy. Second, the current and weather can sometimes make fishing in smaller boats difficult and dangerous. With that said, I've been fishing Canada my whole life and my biggest walleye and smallie (by far) came out of that river. Black Lake is up there as well. It's a great lake that has a bit of the Canadian shield feeling."
