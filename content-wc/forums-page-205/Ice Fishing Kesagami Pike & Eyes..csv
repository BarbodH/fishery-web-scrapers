5299090,Moosebunk,2017-01-29 11:08:00,211,"Some years back took a first crack at winter camping. A plane dropped two of us off in Kesagami Provincial Park where we expected to pitch a tent and ice fish pike and walleye for four days. Night one, just before an unexpected blizzard rolled in, the trip took a little detour off course. The remaining days became an interesting challenge but we still managed a little great fishing. Live and learn... Recently having re-edited the old story to post up, thought any here who like their pike and walleye and are familiar with Kesagami, may want to read about this great fishery during it's winter months.http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/kesagami-ice-on-fire/"
5299458,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-29 14:59:00,8293,Nice read. Could have been a real disaster if that whole tent had burned with your supplies.
5304218,Moosebunk,2017-01-31 17:24:00,211,"Clothes on our backs would have been it. Do remember that the food and supplies were in bins and probably far enough from the tent that the black smoke signals would have had us running to save them in time. Live and learn. Camped out many, many times and alone too... simple little things can be cause for disaster. After learning the hard way on this trip, have always wanted to go back and try things differently."

On a winter camping trip about ten years ago, I had a propane pad heater start shooting major flames and would not turn off when I turned the valve off. I have no idea what the issue was, maybe the valve had ice form inside or something that stopped it from closing. I was very fortunate not to be sleeping and then to get it out of the tent before something caught on fire. Propane at very low temps is erratic in my experience. I no longer will use propane heaters in freezing temps in a tent I am sleeping in. I understand something fell on yours, different issue. I am just pointing out I have seen propane heaters do weird things at really low temps."
5306569,Moosebunk,2017-02-01 21:08:00,211,"Absolutely!!! And we kinda should have known better. My wife and I first took the propane Coleman stove in with us for single days of this ice fishing in 2005. Whenever it was too cold one or both of us would keep a propane cylinder in our jackets to warm it up, because we'd have to change them out with the one attached to the stove after a short while of it being exposed in the cold temps. Never did I think with a dozen propane cylinders, two stoves, heaters, shelter and such that we would have too much issue on our camping trip but, again that one little mistake seemed to snowball on us... Once the blizzard stopped and we walked off to the cabin, had we not been able to do that I still think we would have been fine enough to get a fire going, use our stove grills, heat food, tough it out and stay put until the plane came. Lucky to have a better option in the safety of the cabin though. Thanks for reading the story too!"

Cant wait as Kesagami is the most beautiful spot I have ever seen. The fishing is not bad either.Do you fish the north side of the lake?We have never gone more than about eight miles from south end and wondered if farther north was better.Always enjoy reading your writings. Good fishing Pikeman"

I'm not intrigued in the least by winter camping - regardless how good the fishing might be. I'll stick to spring, summer and fall fishing. Not that into myself but usually willing to try most things once. In highschool and college that did get me into some trouble from time to time. PIKEMAN you have to get into the north bays of this lake. Michelbobs, North, Otter, Small, No Name and even Edgar all have their moments. Dumbbell & South Bay are great early spring as I understand it but, have most experience late July when the north bays are really the best. Parts of Newnham are good too but, if you're gonna travel all that way south you could have done the same to the north and given yourself alot more water (and productive water at that) to fish. There are two private camps, one in the far south and one far north ends of the lake. Great body of water to enjoy. Always more productive fishing when the main lodge shuts down though."
