5133522,Musky Magic,2016-09-29 13:57:00,3,Looking at a June smallmouth trip to Halleys Caribou Falls landing - does anyone have any experience or recommendation with the lodge or the fishing?
5135521,The tank,2016-09-30 20:26:00,340,The camp is a nice camp the Halleyes are nice people and smallmouth fishing can be as good as any where. I've got a friend that has stayed there for over 25 years. He won't go nowhere else. I can't really help any more than that.

I have personally stayed at one of their lodges and at their outpost company locations multiple times now. The fishing has always been great and the number of trophies continues to improve due to the conservation program they participate in. We usually stay at Kettle Falls, but I have met both Chris and Amber and they are very nice people. Since the fishing is on the same lake, I would assume it would be great at Caribou as well. We have had some great memories make fishing with the Halley family and look forward to this years trip in June. Good luck, I hope this helps."
