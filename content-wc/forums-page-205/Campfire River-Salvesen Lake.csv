Myself and a few family members are going to be fishing this lake using Halley's Camps and The Outpost company. I would like to know if anyone has fished this river and how far upstream from Salvesen Lake we can go, how good the fishing was, and if there is any rapids upstream. I did notice on you tube there has been a group that always fishes Sharpstone Lake and one time had to fish this water since the ice was not out yet. The publishers name of the video was Wally. Anything anyone might have would be helpful. Thanks."

I thought I would give this a shot first and see if someone on this forum has actually fished the system. Also, I looked into some maps about the river, but haven't had much luck yet. I do know there is a natural resources road near there, but am unsure how far upstream. I have previously fished Salvesen a couple of times and it has been pretty good for walleye and pike, but I would like to be a little more adventurous this year. I would love to venture farther north and fish Sharpstone some year since they say it is more open to bigger fish. It would be great to run into you sometime on a trip. I really like your videos and love the information and story you present. I will try to get ahold of Wally via youtube. Now only if I could remember my login!"
