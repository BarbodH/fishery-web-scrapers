5314817,wdkott,2017-02-05 15:37:00,26,"Try the smaller sized silver or gold colored Hot N Tots. It's our group's go to trolling lure. It also catches all other sport fish, including good sized pike. My largest pike, 44 inches, was caught trolling a silver with blue back Hot N Tot one evening on Lount Lake."
5314849,Daveygravy,2017-02-05 15:57:00,88,"Hard to beat a Firetiger shad rap. I find that bigger baits work best at dusk and after dark. Try size 18 floating Rapala's in blue with a jerk, jerk reel retrieve or troll them. Suspending baits like x raps and husky jerks work great also , just remember to pause the bait several times during the retrieve ( about 3 to 5 seconds)."
5314977,adempsey2.0,2017-02-05 16:55:00,612,"I primarily use jigs and meat rigs. I do like to work the shorelines and troll at times though. There are tons of great brands and models of lures out there, so I think focusing on method is more important. For me, I want a jerk bait for working shoreline and edges of structure, a shad type bait for pretty much everything, a stick bait for trolling, a deep diving stick and shad bait for trolling, blade bait for jigging and maybe some other types of jigging lures often associated with ice fishing. Can't go wrong with Rapala, Storm, Live Target or Berkley"

5316121,orchard frank,2017-02-06 08:38:00,1900,"Have to agree on the Tots, by far my favorite when I was spending a lot of time on Lac Seul. Trolling any speed, cast a mile, bounce them off rocks and shore. Lots of stuff works but the tots always seemed to be the best cranks. Gold/Pink was my favorite, really shows up in tea-colored water. Good Luck"
5316241,stumcfar,2017-02-06 09:47:00,451,"#7 shad raps, crawdad and hot steel. Those are my go to colors in Buffalo Bay which is the bay on the Manitoba side of LOW. My guess is colors will vary by lake, but hard to beat a #7 shad rap."
5317337,pale ryder,2017-02-06 18:32:00,1937,i don't have a favorite. i try to have two of every size and color of everything.
5317393,Bstar,2017-02-06 18:47:00,564,Try Bandit Walleye Diver in Clown pattern. Great action out of the box. Definitely a must have crank for walleyes and pike.They come in a shallow and deep versions. Not too expensive $6.39 ea at landbigfish.com.
5317473,Bayou,2017-02-06 19:41:00,52,"I'm the most unlucky person when it comes to cranks and walleyes. I can kill them with grubs but I've yet to catch one on a crank. I always try several colors from divers to raps and always strike out, lol. Every year I try and it's my nemesis."
5314561,team walleye,2017-02-05 13:40:00,336,I'm headed up to Perrault Lake in Perrault Falls again in June. We always do very well on the Walleye with live bait rigs and twister tails. I was wondering what everyone liked to use for crank baits for Walleye. I was hoping to try more crank baits this year. Thanks for the info.

5314601,team walleye,2017-02-05 14:10:00,336,Wow.. that's $24.99. No way I would throw that in a rock filled lake like I fish in NW Ontario. My luck that $24.99 would be gone in cast #1
5314617,prov1800,2017-02-05 14:20:00,5010,I spend a lot of time fishing some parts of perrault but mostly cedar.although i use live bait most of the time i do use cranbaits often when that bite is on.my go to baits are live target baits.they run true and are the best quality.only thing i do with them as i do with any bait is file the hooks.
5314625,team walleye,2017-02-05 14:21:00,336,How has your luck been on Perrault and Cedar for Walleye?
5314721,wallydave,2017-02-05 14:58:00,2151,"perch pattern wallydivers have worked well for me, minnow pattern works too."
5314745,team walleye,2017-02-05 15:07:00,336,I recently purchased some of these. Excited to try them out.
5314777,Walleye will,2017-02-05 15:17:00,218,I have used flicker shads in the gold and purple. Along with the standard perch and bait fish colors.
5314793,team walleye,2017-02-05 15:21:00,336,Do you guys find that bigger the bait bigger the fish?
5314809,Bill Krejca,2017-02-05 15:34:00,6107,"I have seen the big baits take some nicer fish, hard to say why, maybe just physics. I have found this particularly true with plastics. Bill"
