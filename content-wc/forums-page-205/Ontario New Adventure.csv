5309809,The tank,2017-02-03 03:46:00,340,I would look at separation lake camp. We've stayed at the camp grounds several times in the past. Walleye and smallmouth fishing is really good. Caught a few big pike but don't fish for them. We just don't do the tent thing no more or we would still be staying there.
5298322,wally28,2017-01-29 05:46:00,65,Buddy and I looking for new adventure. We have been tent camping at White Lake east of Wawa for the last 7 years. Fishing has been awesome. Just need a change and new adventure. Any location in N Ontario. Have done LOW. Any info would be great. My boat is a 17' side counsel. We have been looking at Dogtooth Lake and also lakes in N East Ontario. Thanks
5299290,Rich B,2017-01-29 12:51:00,1081,"Lots and lots of lakes in Ontario....so what's most important to you and your buddy ? LOCATION....do you want to have only a 1 day drive each way as opposed to a 2+ day drive each way (where do you live)? COST & STYLE....are you looking to ""tent camp"" again or are you looking for a cabin/motel....and how much $$ do you want to spend ? FISHING QUALITY....are you looking for good decent fishery or one that is exceptional ? Once you outline what you're looking for in terms of these factors, the folks on here will give you many, many suggestions....I have found a lot of the fun in fishing trips is the planning. Good luck with your adventures this year. Rich B"
5299554,wally28,2017-01-29 15:49:00,65,"Hey Thanks for the reply. We live near Marquette, MI, USA so can spend 2 days drive if need be. We will tent camp and look for ""outstanding"" fishing. Either lakes or rivers or chain of lakes."
5299562,wally28,2017-01-29 15:51:00,65,"Rich, we will be pulling my boat so we could even boat in and tent on an island. Thanks. PM me if you want to keep this on the qt."

5304410,wally28,2017-01-31 19:00:00,65,Thank you all for the information; now need to sort it all out. One more question: have any of you fished Dogtooth Lake near the Rushing River- just another consideration?
