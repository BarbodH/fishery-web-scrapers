Frame it up as a June & July special. I don't use guides in MN or Canada, but I do when I go to Alaska, the West Coast and Salt fishing. What I want is boat that is up to date and clean. Rods and reels that look good and work perfectly. I want a comfortable seat. I want the guide to teach me to fish not do it for me. Salt is a bit different because they set the lines and you just wait for the fish to strike. I want the guide to be at the dock ready to go when I arrive at the appointed time. If they are going to clean fish I want them to do it as soon as we get back at the dock and not after they gas and clean their boat. I also like to hear about local attractions, restaurants, and the history of the area."
5314953,fsz,2017-02-05 16:45:00,144,"Like the others have said, have good equipment and know how to use it. Don't have hidden charges. Give customers the amount of advertised fishing time. For example, Lets look at a 7am-3 pm trip. If it genuinely takes 30 minutes to return to port, dont quit fishing at 2, slow your return run to port unnecessarily, and get back at 2:45. If it is a long run to get to good fishing, let the customer know that. If possible, Offer them the options of more fishing time, shorter run, but maybe slower fishing OR longer run less fishing time but faster action. I've seen guides not want to spend the $$$ on ""extra fuel"" to make long runs to get to quality fishing, then have a marginal day and try to sell it as ""thats fishing"". Offer options to cancel/reschedule trip in ""marginal weather (not the same thing as bad weather). (note: ""bad weather"" to me means the guide cancels the trip for safety reasons). I booked a trip on the niagara river. The fishing was beyond epic. This was a function of timing and river conditions- everyone was hammering the fish. The guide was a good ""teacher"". But The quides equipment and boat were sub par. And, Since we were catching so many fish, he felt enoguh was enough and he shorted us an hour on the trip. He probably knew we wouldnt complain about that because we had such a good day. We tipped him well. But, he didn't get us as a repeat customer. Next time we used a different guide. Better equipment. Got out full 8 hours. Also a good teacher. Fishing...just fair. That was a function of weather and timing. Any time I refer anyone it is to guide number 2. Guide #1 got a good tip. Guide #2 got a good tip, repeat business, and referrals."
5317353,martinbns,2017-02-06 18:35:00,1520,"We used a guide last year out of Totem Lodge, Marc Lalonde I believe was his name. He was excellent, funny, we caught a good number of fish, shore lunch was good. We used my boat as a form of education on how to handle it as it was our first boat. Tipped him fairly well, replaced the few lures of his we lost and have recommended him. He figured out fairly quickly we weren't going to be pissed if we didn't catch monsters, walleye were very deep, so part of our time we fished successfully for pike, my wife and I had a very good time. He clearly knew what he was doing both with the boat and the fish."

5307937,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-02 10:39:00,447,"Was your first post deleted? You're asking for the ""bads on guides""? As a way to help you start your guide business?? I think you're going about this the wrong way. I wish you well though."
5308049,prov1800,2017-02-02 10:58:00,5010,I did make a comment earlier posts got deleted i guess. To much money talk.
5308105,LOW1,2017-02-02 11:05:00,2828,"Whether you succeed or fail will depend upon what you do, not what other guides do. If you provide a professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and hard-working experience to your customers I think you can stay busy in the summer. If you don't, you won't."
5308169,prov1800,2017-02-02 11:27:00,5010,LOW1 is right on the money.it will take time to build up clientle.
5308225,MrSimon,2017-02-02 11:44:00,922,"As I said in the other thread, set your prices noticeably lower than experienced guides in the area. Then focus on two things: 1) Make sure you guests have a very enjoyable experience!! 2) Make yourself visible through good marketing Do those things well and the money will follow."
5308305,walleyemuskyguyzone5,2017-02-02 12:05:00,2,"yes it was deleted not to sure why but like you said I might of been going the wrong way with my topic,what i meant is what do you look for in a good guide,good and bad experiences some of you might of had with your trips,im not here to promote camps just tryin figure out what I need to do before I start my quest in the industry of as a fish guide"
5310713,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-03 10:32:00,447,"I haven't hired many guides so I'm not the best source but my top priority is that safety always comes first. Operate the boat safely, have the required safety gear and make sure it's in good working order, make sure your clients are safe with knives, hooks, etc and NEVER push your luck with bad weather or let a client talk you into doing something you know you shouldn't. Obviously you should know the waters and the species you're fishing and have good fishing equipment. Be prepared to put up with some annoying clients; most will be a pleasure to guide but there will be a few who try your patience. Be professional in how you deal with them. Don't hesitate to answer questions. The few times I've hired a guide I've asked a lot of questions related to fishing. I figure I'm hiring your knowledge as much as I am your boat and boat handling. I also asked a lot of questions about his family and his life outside fishing. Easier to like someone when you know more about them. At the end of the day I ask myself--did he do his level best to put me on fish and was he pleasant to share a boat with. I had a guide stay out an extra 45 minutes because the fishing was slow and he was disappointed for us. I really appreciated that and my tip reflected my appreciation. In short, be safe, be professional, do your best to make your clients happy and be a good conversationalist. Good luck."
5311849,Skywagon,2017-02-03 17:16:00,1106,"I am not a guide, but this is my observation.There are many clients that rather not go out with a guide that smokes, once they find out he does, they ask for another guide. This may not pertain to you, but something to consider.I am always suspect of any product that is less expensive than the similar one that everyone else sells. Same applies to a guides in my book, if you are cheaper than everyone else, is it because your guiding ability is inferior? I suspect the client that goes for the cheaper guide, probably tips accordingly and this is where the real money is.A 17.5' boat is very limited in size for the amount of people that can comfortably fish out of it and still give you room to move around to bait hooks and take fish off. A group of people that are looking for a deal is what a freelancer without a reputation will more than likely get and what you will need cater too, in order to generate enough revenue to make a go of it. These are just a few thoughts that came to mind, this may be your calling, if so be prepared for some lean times until you sort through what works best for you. Good luck on whatever you decide."
5312801,Aspencreek,2017-02-04 09:41:00,2911,"I have used a guide on only a few occasions, but when starting a business where you are trying to break in means you need to market yourself, market yourself again, and when you think you are done...do it again. Just a couple thoughts. 1) Visit each and every camp in your area, they have the customers and you will have to share some commission with them. 2) Visit each and every bait shop, sporting goods store, hardware store, liquor store, etc and see if they keep a guide listing or will allow you to put up a flier or some other kind of marketing piece. 3) Have a website, with all the information someone might need to make an informed decision. Too many websites do not include enough info, have it reviewed by people out of the norm for content. Pictures, testimonials, contact info. and get back to them QUICKLY. 4) Have your equipment and boat clean, not just OK clean, like new clean!!! and in working order. And you need to be clean too. Please do not be offended but if you have a 3 day beard, or a Duck Commander type beard and it looks and smells like you haven't seen a shower in a couple days.....well. I scheduled a guide through my camp owner for a day and the guy showed up 30 min late, the motor smoked, the boat had not been cleaned since he got it. He smelled like his cigar, his old cap needed to be retired, and his jacket had more holes than swiss cheese. Moral of the story.....if you are a professional, look like it, in anything you do, and nobody is hiring you for your political views. Good luck!!!"
