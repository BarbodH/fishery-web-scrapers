519633,Guest,2002-04-30 06:34:00,0,A friend of mine is looking for a topo map with depths for Lake Athapapuskow up by Flin Flon in Manitoba. Any idea where he can get one?
519634,Guest,2002-04-30 06:52:00,0,"I order my hydological maps from www.fedpubs.com. I order maps for Ontario. Check out their site, they might have the lake you are looking for in Manitoba. I like hydrological maps since they concentrate their efforts on the depths of lakes, rather than the heights of land.good luck,pooch"
519635,Behle,2002-04-30 07:06:00,51,You may try http://www.gpsnuts.com also. Lots of information that can be gained if you have some of the coordinates of the places you fish. Will be able to help even if you don't have them.
519636,Guest,2002-05-01 10:44:00,0,"Here's the deal, the topo maps I've seen do not have water depth. DO NOT go out on that lake without a topo map though. The East Arm of the Lake is particularly dangerous. Subsurface rocks are a-plenty and angling maps with depths DO NOT show all of them, only the topo maps do. Maps can be purchased right in the small village of Cranberry Portage which resides on the East Arm of the Lake. At least one of the three small stores there carries them along with maps of other lakes in the area.You'd prob. be better off looking at this link.http://www.canadamapsales.com/The office is right in Winnipeg so either they could send them to you or order them and pick them up on your way through, assuming you'd be driving from here.Good luck."
