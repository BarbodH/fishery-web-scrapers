5323137,Bstar,2017-02-09 11:08:00,564,You can also get an inexpensive waterproof case from Amazon. Mine cost $8.99
5323169,jamesherbst,2017-02-09 11:30:00,12,"I've arrived at a solution!I've settled on the Garmin Echomap 45CV, and purchased the universal portable kit for it. The 45CV comes with Chirp sonar, Clear view down-scan imaging, and a built-in map of over 14,000 Canadian Lakes....and Marchington Lake is included in the map set. At $449, the whole thing set me back a little more than I wanted to spend, but hopefully I'll get a good 10 years out of this setup, and it's portable to take anywhere. (although I'll still have to figure out the battery charging issue for a fly-in lake)"
5307329,jamesherbst,2017-02-02 08:35:00,12,"I've booked a trip to Ghost River Lodge in May this year, and am thinking of upgrading my portable fish finder. I really like what I see in the Humminbird Helix 5 with the GPS feature. The problem is....I can't seem to find a GPS card that includes the lake that I'll be fishing on. Ghost River is located on Marchington Lake, and the Unimap feature built into the Humminbird does not include much of Canada at all. I've checked with Navionics, and they told me that Marchington Lake is not yet included on their Canada card. I don't need contours...just the lake outline. Has anyone used a GPS feature on Marchington Lake? Any help would be appreciated."
5309137,Bstar,2017-02-02 15:38:00,564,You probably won't find anything for your Helix. I have the same problem. I bought a helix 5 with the Navionics chip but it doesn't have Miniss Lake on it either. You can still use the gps for marking waypoints and tracks but you won't have the outline of the lake on it. If you have an iPhone or an iPad you can download an app called Topo Maps Canada. You can then zoom into your lake and download the map of your lake to the device. It will show you where you are on the lake and you can also flag spots and when you tap on the flag it will give you the option to navigate to that spot. The app works with the gps on your device so you don't need a cell signal to use it. The maps have a fair amount of detail but no depths are marked. Hope this helps.

5309217,Walleye will,2017-02-02 16:09:00,218,"That's is very true, you got to go to clamshell for some really good fishing!!"
5310617,Seanik,2017-02-03 09:49:00,218,"For topo maps of all Ontario do a search at Trakmaps. They have a micro chip for Hummingbird or Lowrance that includes all of Ontario. The Ontario Micro chip is 150.00 Ca. with free shipping, also a chip for Quebec. I have both chips and they are accurate and precise. Seanik"
5317857,Skyraptor,2017-02-07 06:32:00,291,Don at GRL will have a good set of maps of all the lakes that you can fish on. Plus he will mark areas to go to where the fish are. Can't go wrong fishing at Ghost River.
5319153,jamesherbst,2017-02-07 15:15:00,12,"Thanks for the replies! I have loaded the topo maps Canada on to my iPad and the result is pretty sweet! Great detail to the maps and nice to see on a 9"" screen. Easy to zoom and scroll too. The problem with that is that I don't necessarily want to drag a non-weatherproof iPad around on the lake to find out where I'm at. I've also touched base with TracMaps and their chip cards are only compatible with Garmin units and a couple of Lowrance units. So...after considerable searching, I've found a Garmin unit (the Echomap) that has down imaging, gps, and Chirp technology for under $400. Garmin has a Canada GPS card that includes Marchington, as well as 14,000 other lakes, and sells for about $150.00. And finally, they offer a portable kit that includes a rechargeable battery, carrying case, and suction cup transducer for another $100. So...all in, I'm around $650.00. Kind of expensive...but it's the most complete solution I've been able to find."
5320969,Lenman,2017-02-08 11:59:00,19,"I'm going up in May also! Excellent choice as this is my 5th or 6th trip up there. Darrell or Don will do an excellent job explaining the lake(s) for you and making sure you're on the fish! I bring up my Hummingbird fish finder for depth and contours and rely on that. It's a fairly easy lake to travel so I've been relying on their maps and have purchased a waterproof one also for reference. I've had many 50 & 100+ fish days there... sort of spoils you as I haven't had that type of action anywhere else I've tried. PM me if you want more details, I'm glad to share!"
5321001,Bakefish,2017-02-08 12:06:00,1077,I went to GRL back in the day. We went in by train and flew out at the end of the week. It wasn't the same place it is now. Let's just say that the owner wasn't very fastidious.
5321345,Redwake,2017-02-08 15:03:00,1,I have had the same problem so after many years of frustration I found that using google earth your could make your own map and export it to your Hummingbird unit. Go to google and search for map hack for hummingbird and they will explain how to do it.
