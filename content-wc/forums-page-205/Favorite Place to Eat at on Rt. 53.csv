5303482,walleyehunt13,2017-01-31 10:44:00,10,Gordy's Hi Hat is a new tradition when we make our Canada trip
5303514,Golden Eagle,2017-01-31 10:49:00,2642,My ice chest holds plenty of food for 26 hours on the road.
5303530,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-31 11:01:00,447,I used to travel that way. Now I find it nice to stop every 4 hours or so. Must be an age related bladder issue. I usually eat in either EC or Superior because there isn't much between but I see now that there are a couple places I need to check out.
5303562,The tank,2017-01-31 11:16:00,340,Not right on 53 but in Chetek there's Reds not far off 53 and a little farther there's Gilligans both bar and grills with good food. Probly 2-5 minutes off of 53.
5303682,Golden Eagle,2017-01-31 12:07:00,2642,"I understand. We go gas stop, rest area stop, over and over. A short, but brisk walk on both stops works for me. Food still come from the ice chest."
5303698,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-31 12:08:00,147,"Haha that's ok, sounds like we may need to hold out until Superior and hit up Anchor Bar lol"
5303706,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-31 12:09:00,147,Also thank you everyone for the suggestions!
5301618,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-30 16:05:00,147,"Looking for some suggestions for your favorite place to grab some grub between Eau Claire and Superior on Rt. 53. Our group normally does the drive thru game because we want to get there as fast as possible, but this year we will be staying overnight so we are going to take our time on the way up. Name your favorite dive! Thanks!"
5301714,Skywagon,2017-01-30 16:58:00,1106,"Not a lot of great choices (in my opinion) on that stretch of road, have stopped by Rice Lake many times for fast food."
5301866,Bstar,2017-01-30 17:55:00,564,We haven't really stopped for anything but fast food on that stretch but this year we are spending the night in Rice Lake on the way home. I have looked at Adventures Restaurant and Pub. Reviews are pretty good and they have something for everybody on their menu. Don't know when you will be passing through but they open at 11am. Not too far east of the highway at exit 140. There's also an Applebee's at the same exit.
5301906,Aspencreek,2017-01-30 18:06:00,2911,"I am through that section of hwy every month and the only place I stop is in Trego at the family diner right on the hwy (standard fare but always good) and when it is open there is a restaurant at the CR B intersection just south of Superior, nice folks and good food, but not always open."
5301954,iamthejayhawk,2017-01-30 18:26:00,2,"Without question, you need to stop at the Anchor Bar in Superior for burgers. It is one of the best burgers I've had a long time. You will not be disappointed."
5301962,manfishing,2017-01-30 18:28:00,131,"Anchor bar in Superior. Really good bar food, if you like bar food. Check it out on Google."
5303138,rzep,2017-01-31 09:27:00,1196,I am really suprised how the menu/presentation has improved in Applebee's over the last few years. ... at least one around here and one in Devils Lake ND.. not a a lot but quality food...
5303258,Fishoil,2017-01-31 09:49:00,1277,"We've stopped at the Norske Nook in Rice Lake many times. The food is good and fairly quick, but not fast food fast, plan on spending a little time."
5303282,Frankm,2017-01-31 09:53:00,154,There is a Perkins right off 53 in Black River Falls.
5303442,LOW1,2017-01-31 10:28:00,2828,"Probably out of your way, but if you go down to Cloquet, MN you could have a chance to eat at Gordy's Top Hat. Great burgers, fish sandwiches, onion rings and shakes. You may have seen it on the TV show where the guy with spiked hair checks out local places."
