I also see there is an area between some rapids ""One Mile Lake"" right before the portage to Walleye Lake? I plan on staying around the west end and not venturing very far east into Vermillion Bay...don't want to run too far to find some spots. Seems like the slot has helped numbers go up in recent years? Any help would be appreciated."

No need to go all the way to Vermillion Bay. Our group of 7 caught between 25 and 30 Walleye between 24"" and 28"" all on the West Arm. Plenty of smallmouth lake trout and pike also, we did not target Musky. The portage lakes were too difficult to get to for me as I have a very bad ankle but others in camp seemed to do well there We are returning this year on 7-1. Any other questions pm me"
