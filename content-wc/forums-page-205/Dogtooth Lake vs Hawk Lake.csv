5273442,67ZL1,2017-01-16 09:51:00,277,I saw the Linder show on Hawk and they were saying that Hawk is catch and release for Walleye. Not sure about the other species tho. That might explain why HLL is quite a bit more than Dogtooth.
5274586,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-16 19:28:00,461,"Hawk Lake is catch and release for all species, including walleye. There is also no public access to the lake or other lakes around the lodge. Dogtooth Lake does not have the same policy and there are many public campgrounds and access points for fishermen to access the lake."
5274722,bthomas3333,2017-01-16 20:09:00,465,So here is what I am hearing: Hawk No public access Catch and Release Lindner fish caught on Hawk not Dogtooth Orvis Endorsed High end all inclusive Dogtooth Public access Catch Keep Cheaper I guess the general watershed has large Walleyes but I wouldn't / won't gamble my vacation after fantastic experiences at Hawk. If I am worried about money I would just stay 4 days at Hawk vs a week at Dogtooth. To each his own. B-
5312289,Fisherman Ted,2017-02-03 21:43:00,461,Babe Winkelman also fished Hawk Lake last summer. That experience is airing this weekend.
5313665,Golden Eagle,2017-02-04 20:31:00,2642,"I recorded and watched Winkleman's show today. Very impressive. Lots of huge walleyes.Ted, you've got it going on."
5270738,BadgerRedd1,2017-01-14 14:16:00,82,"After watching recent shows on the walleye fishing on these 2 lakes I looked at the resorts and their prices, I must be missing something, Dogtooth Lake Resort has prices of around $65-$70 CANADIAN, each person, per night, while Hawk Lake Lodge shows $400-$440 US Funds, each person, per night. Hawk Lake Lodge is an all-inclusive resort which includes the use of an 18' boat, motor and unlimited gas and 3 meals but wow, that seems expensive for a fishing trip. Anyway, can anybody offer any insights as to how these resorts compare? Is the fishing ""better"" at one lake over the other? Thanks for your opinions !!"
5270746,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-14 14:31:00,461,Dogtooth and Hawk Lake are not connected and completely separate fisheries.
5270858,kzoofisher,2017-01-14 15:26:00,5144,"From what I've seen and heard about Hawk I would say they are completely different experiences. I'd call both places and see which sounds more attractive to you. I only do outposts because one of my absolute priorities is to get away from the hustle and bustle of my daily life and at this time neither of these fine lodges is attractive to me. In the future, maybe. I can see going to places like these when I'm retired and want to take several generations somewhere."
5270994,bthomas3333,2017-01-14 17:20:00,465,"Hey,I have been to HLL several times. This last year when I was at HLL I talked to a couple of guys who had fished Dogtooth for a number of years and were making their first trip to HLL.I asked the same question you are asking. Here is what they said:The boats are much better at HLL. Almost brand new bigger better motor with high end electronics and trolling motor.The food at Hawk Lake is high end (real Chef)HLL has an evening happy hour - Apps / Drinks - includedNo extra fees. At HLL everything is included (Boat / Gas / Trolling motor / bait / soft drinks in stocked cabin frig / snacks in the room)The biggest difference to these two guys was the fishing. They fished hard but also had several 28+inch each. SO on the whole they had better fishing than they had ever seen at Dogtooth.I personally think HLL is higher quality all around and worth the extra $. Just a different experience. I will make my forth trip in 3 years for the opener. If you decide to visit Hawk feel free to PM me.Brett"
5271074,BadgerRedd1,2017-01-14 18:29:00,82,"Hi Ted,You seem to be enjoying your ""mid life crisis"" change nicely !! I know that Dogtooth and Hawk Lake are not connected, just saw 2 different celebrities fishing them and was intrigued enough to look into the resorts. No doubt that HLL offers more than Dogtooth Lake resort, but it's at a much higher cost, and to be honest, I'm not sure I need the ""extras"", we make an early breakfast and pack a lunch and are on the water by 5am, usually back about 4pm, couple of guys clean fish while the other 2 make dinner. Then back on the water for an evening trip. Couple of adult beverages during dinner and a nightcap(or 2) and time to hit the sack, so we can do it again. I don't know that I would use the jacuzzi or would want to come in from fishing to enjoy the Chef's specials, especially if catching 25""-30"" walleyes. Both shows did a good job of peaking my interest, certainly worth looking into."
5271658,buckeye1,2017-01-15 07:58:00,269,"I have fished Dogtooth. Did not stay at the resort so can't comment. We go in august. It can be a tough a tough lake to fish. You go there for trophy not numbers. I watched the Linder show this morning. Funny thing is they mentioned dogtooth, but all the fishing was on Hawk. Maybe next week they'll actually be on Dogtooth."
5271962,BadgerRedd1,2017-01-15 10:53:00,82,"Babe Winkelman was on Dogtooth last week, and Lindner's were on Hawk Lake this week. Both shows mentioned the lakes were more noted for quality sized walleyes and not numbers."
5271986,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-15 11:24:00,461,Babe Winkelman also fished Hawk Last summer and taped 2 shows. They will both be airing shortly.
5272010,kzoofisher,2017-01-15 11:49:00,5144,Hawk also has a reputation for being a superb smallmouth fishery which probably accounts for its popularity with fly fisherman. Anyone know how Dogtooth is for bass? I like the way a multi-species fishery gives you options when the weather makes single species fishing tough. I've never been to Hawk Lake Lodge but it is endorsed by Orvis. That is pretty much a guarantee that it is as nice as advertised. An Orvis endorsement is the Michelin 3 star equivalent of outdoor resort ratings.
5272282,buckeye1,2017-01-15 14:34:00,269,Did see the Babe show. What channel is he on these days.
