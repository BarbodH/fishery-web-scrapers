There are some that are trout or bass only lakes though.In general, the lakes out west are larger. 90% of the outpost lakes are 500 acres or more, with ~1,650 acres being the average. Out east, the average size is ~625 acres.Probably one of the reasons why you often hear that the fishing is better out west."
5275626,MrSimon,2017-01-17 09:32:00,922,"This is a neat thread. I had fun thinking about lake size and stuff. Here are my thoughts:I agree with the original definitions of size, although I think there could be a fourth category for mega lakes (maybe 100k acres and up)I think fish size has more to do with food, structure, temp, depth etc. than it does with size, although it sure seems that true monsters typically come from large lakesSmall Lakes: I love fishing them, but not for a week straight. They are usually easy to fish, safe and protected, and a good one can be massive amounts of fun for a day trip. Also, you don't need a big fancy boat.Medium Lakes: I love them, but mostly for week long outpost type trips. I prefer to have a medium sized boat and at least a portable depth finder. Don't need GPS, charts, fast boats etc. Perfect fly-in lakes.Large Lakes: I love them, but only if I have a boat that can handle big water, is comfy, and has good electronics, including GPS. This basically means I want my own boat if I'm on big water. Without that, I tend to get overwhelmed and sometimes frustrated because I can't fish as effectively as I'd like. Just for kicks, I looked up the size of a bunch of lakes that get mentioned on this board regularly. Ontario = 4,684,800 acres Reindeer = 1,606,400 Nipigon = 1,198,080 LOW = 1,074,560 Lac Seul = 409,600 Rainy = 230,272 Eagle = 68,464 Onaman = 28,000 Wabigoon = 26,000 Kagianagami = 20,000 Esnagami = 17,049 O'Sullivan = 15,000 Windermere = 10,000 Crotch = 3,850 Quantz = 1,794 Also, if you are interested: 1 square mile = 640 acres 1 hectacre = 2.47 acres"
5275666,Mike Borger,2017-01-17 09:52:00,1554,"As a fan of larger lakes I already knew this. For me, my preference is something at least 20,000 acres in size so that limits things even further.Strictly speaking large outpost lakes within Ontario, the small number available is the main reason why I've begun to fish Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec more often."
5275818,mjayn,2017-01-17 10:51:00,1188,"Fish them all. I have never fished or not fished a lake based on size(unless weather is a factor). Only on research, past experience, and the big one ...curiosity."
5276194,fsz,2017-01-17 15:11:00,144,"Mr Simons point on matching boat size to lake size is well taken. I could probably handle a smaller lake for 2-3 days but certainly not a week (unless I did 2 or 3 in a week). A small lake with any amount of fishing pressure can get fished down pretty quick though. Ones that you have to hand carry a boat in can be great. Never did a fly-in on one. I think fishing out west is better, not just because of size, but also distance to population centers and amount of available water. Less fisherman + more lakes= tons of opportunity."
5319593,shermanpup,2017-02-07 18:15:00,3,"I am on a 80 Acre lake with a 50 acre lake connected by a channel. It has limited fishing ,Pike in small numbers, but some big ones, not so much pan fish in numbers ,and good bass .Average bass 16,"" some caught up to 27"",good forage ,a lot of different minnows. Big bass at night!. There are Walleye too but we don't know the numbers. The lake has a 20 foot drop off .a 30 foot drop off , a 40 foot drop off ,and a 53 foot deep hole .There was a lot of cabbage ,but that seems to be changing , Some fool introduced Zebra Mussels about 4 years ago .The are a couple of creeks that enter and exit but we don't know if the Walleyes spawn .There are always a couple of Loons there every season and an occasional Osprey. .I am going to snoop around with my camera this year out deep .The good thing is that there no jet skis and no water skiers on the lakes ,Just pontoons and small fishing boats. If it was a bigger lake the fishing would be better ,but it would be a lot busier also , so there is always a trade off"
5269394,fsz,2017-01-13 16:54:00,144,"If we had to categorize lakes as small, medium, and large based on acreage, what does everyone think the cutoffs would be? I'll throw out these numbers as starters: small- under 1000 acres; medium 1000-10000; large over 10,000. From reading posts over the years, all other things besides size being equal, seems like many people feel small lakes can give up good numbers but size of walleye runs small; Medium size lakes can give up good numbers and some large fish; Large lakes can give numbers and size but finding fish can be difficult. This has basically been my experience. Just curious what everyone else feels."
5269426,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-13 17:25:00,8293,"Your stats all make sense. Personally I like the large lakes if for no other reason then lots of scenery. I'm a troller and nothing is worse than a small lake. It's like NASCAR, round & round ya go."
5269442,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-13 17:29:00,447,"In Canada, my small lakes would be up to 5000A, medium up to 50,000A and large above 50,000A. In WI, I would go with under 1000, 1000-5000 and over 5000."
5270034,Pooch,2017-01-14 05:58:00,4618,"A square mile is 640 acres so a 1000 acre lake is not very big. Especially if spending a week in a cabin on such a lake. That same lake on a river system would be just a wide spot and OK as long as the river system was large enough and contained decent fish and other ""wide spots"".My thinking is that size of lake is relative to each person and how much traveling they like to do. I've seen guys (on a 30-40,000 acre flyin lake) fish less than a quarter mile from camp for a week at a time and they catch plenty of fish and are happy campers. Seen the same thing on a large lake like Lac Seul, too.Any lake with enough open water that the wind can make it angry suddenly becomes a large lake to me.Pooch"
5270058,BornToFish,2017-01-14 06:24:00,1224,"Greetings,I can go with the proposal set forth in the original post. If not perfect, his proposal seems like a reasonable place to start.I have been on several fly-in trips that were to ""small"" lakes. We caught lots of eater size walleyes with an occasional trophy size walleye (e.g. 28+ inches). I recall staying on spots and continuously yanking walleyes for hours - but all of the fish were under 16 inches.I recall reading a thread on Walleye Central years ago that discussed attributes of lakes having bigger walleyes. There was a post that mentioned regularly finding bigger walleyes in lakes with sustainable populations of ciscoes and whitefish. This comment pretty well nailed it in terms of my experiences.Sure there will be exceptions, but many of the smaller lakes that I fish in Canada have forage bases made up of minnows and perch. This might be because the smaller lakes are generally shallower and warmer than deep water (big) lakes. The perch and minnows are ""non oily"" sources of food for predators that lack the calories needed for predators to be come giants.On the other hand, ciscoes and whitefish are commonly viewed as high calorie foods (i.e. ""oily"") that can support growth to trophy proportions. I find that this applies to northern pike and muskies, as well as walleyes.I believe that bigger lakes, rather than smaller lakes, generally have the deep water main lake basins associated with ciscoes and whitefish. These species of baitfish seem to need cool water to thrive.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5270970,fsz,2017-01-14 17:07:00,144,Born to fish's inclusion of the forage base and deep water makes sense and probably holds true in most cases. But there are a few large lakes that are pretty shallow that are known for large fish. Don't know the specific habitat requirements for cisco and whitefish.
5271378,adempsey2.0,2017-01-14 22:01:00,612,"I did this analysis for 631 lakes with outpost camps on them. Here is what I found:5% of lakes were over 13,320 acres10% of lakes were over 6,570 acres25% of lakes were over 2,610 acres50% of lakes were over 1,126 acres25% of lakes were below 537 acres10% of lakes were below 280 acres5% of lakes were below 170 acresSo, your estimate actually works out quite well.I am not quite sure about the relationship between lake size and fish size. Obviously the larger the lake the more fish it should contain. I think the average size of the fish is going to be dependent on the forage base, but also on survival and successful reproduction rates. It's important to note that a small lake that's part of an extensive water system may behave like a larger lake, especially seasonally. Lake boundaries are often artificially created by man."
5271826,fsz,2017-01-15 09:37:00,144,"Very interesting adempsey! Very surprising to see half of those lakes are below 1,100 acres. My guess is lakes of those size are attractive for folks looking to be the only group on a lake (rent-a lake)- unlikely outfitters would have multiple camps on a small lake. What got this thread going was a neighbor who flys in to a smaller lake in NEO and they are pretty satisfied with the fishing. When I saw the lake on a map I was shocked at how small it was. For sure, if fish can move thru a system, a small lake could fish ""big"". I've had my eye on some small lakes in the 400-800 acre size (not flyins, but rather portage ins). I've decided to make a go of these adventures."
5273130,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-16 07:18:00,447,"Really interesting breakdown but I'm not sure restricting to just outpost lakes is statistically valid. I assume that your percentages add up to >100 because lakes that are over 13,320 also count as over 1,126, 2,610 etc. Same for the ""under"" lakes. What was especially interesting to me was that 40% of outpost lakes are under 537A with 5% under 170A. I can't imagine spending a week long vacation on a <170A lake."
5273290,fsz,2017-01-16 08:32:00,144,My guess is many of the outposts on lakes that small are either trout lakes and/or used primarily for moose/bear hunting.
