5296370,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-27 19:11:00,147,"Hello all, I am looking for suggestions for a lodge that is open in May, or would be willing to take a 4 person group before they open in June. I am looking for a walleye and bigger pike lake. Drive in or boat in does not matter. Also only need a housekeeping plan, as we bring our own food. Looking to stay in Ontario and more secluded, not a big resort lake like Lac Seul or LOTW. Normally we go to Nungesser, to give you all an idea on what we are used to, however that does not look like it is going to happen this year. Whatcha all got? Thanks!"
5296394,Aspencreek,2017-01-27 19:30:00,2911,"Just curious, why May?"
5296458,ElectricSlide19,2017-01-27 20:06:00,147,"Only time we can all get our schedules to line up. Technically it would be May 26th-June 3rd. Ideal would be ice out for the big pike, but spring in general is good for pike"
5296730,north560,2017-01-28 03:44:00,53,"Check out Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge, open start of May with great walleye,pike ,bass and trout fishing.Similar to Nugesser Lodge, only the lake is not as big only 6 1/2 miles long but lots of structure to fish."
5296802,The tank,2017-01-28 06:09:00,340,I would check out Gawleys parkview camp on Wabaskang lake. Pike fishing is good there nice camp awsome hosts. It's just past dutchies store on 105.
5297154,prov1800,2017-01-28 11:41:00,5010,Agree with tank.wabaskang has good pike.few other camps as well on the lake. another place i take guests to is northstar lodge on clay lake.i highly recommend this lake it has real good pike with some real good ones mixed in.also the walleye fishing is fantastic but tends to be slower earluer in the season.only camp on the lenough can travel up to 27 mi.on it.it can get rough in sections but theres enough areas to get out of it.they are open in may
