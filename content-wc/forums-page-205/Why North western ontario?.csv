5307913,Golden Eagle,2017-02-02 10:36:00,2642,Paper mill signs a lot of good pay checks. Employees probably don't mind the odor.They also provide a bridge that I use 4 -6 times a year.
5305306,bigwalleye1,2017-02-01 10:18:00,2632,"You a funny man. Are we crossing the same bridge, i.e., the one where the water runs through a ditch, weaves through a paper mill and smells like the inside of a wet paper sack on a hot day?? 2 miles north of the crossing has everything you're talking about, but the border crossing itself....not so much."
5305434,Pooch,2017-02-01 11:18:00,4618,"I love that paper mill smell as it tells me I'm getting close to some of my most treasured places on earth. Home is off the radar for a short time along with all the other distractions to life.Used to hate it (about thirty years ago), but now look forward to the border crossing whether IF/FF or Pigeon River. There is a mental change in my brain at that point. Might be a dopamine dump.Pooch"
5305442,Ricky Spanish,2017-02-01 11:25:00,1298,"Sure smells like one. Every trip I notice it less, and will probably start to actually like it at some point."
5305570,bigwalleye1,2017-02-01 12:29:00,2632,"Oh, no argument, Pooch. Never said I wasn't glad to smell it, just disagreed that it was scenic views or fresh air at the crossing. I save myself for the next bridge north, crossing over Rainy Lake, the Noden Causeway!!"
5305586,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-01 12:32:00,447,I love that smell when headed north; not so much when headed south.
5305730,fishron,2017-02-01 13:41:00,317,If you've ever crossed over at the Thousand Island Bridge you know what a spectacularly beautiful area it is. Some folks never go any farther.
5306497,HeHooksHimself,2017-02-01 19:36:00,725,"Yeah, Big, I was just messing with you. It is fun to pump up the rookies telling them how wonderful the crossing is then doing it. Almost as fun as it used to be to tell them to ask Allen at Bobby's in V Bay (who we told them was Bobby) if we could get a discount on a lure or some other dumb question and then watch as he ripped them a new one. That, of course, was after we had a great breakfast at the Village Corner. This time of year those memories keep me going until May. Fish On! Hooks"
5306513,elkman99,2017-02-01 19:55:00,180,Now that right there is hilarious! I would have love being in Bobby's for that lol.
5307137,Bstar,2017-02-02 07:20:00,564,"X2 on the paper mill smell. It also reminds me of visiting my aunt in Mosinee,WI when I was a kid. Brings back good memories. Funny how certain smells conjure up some old memories even if they are offensive to most people."
5307457,MrSimon,2017-02-02 09:01:00,922,Agreed! I even bought a cottage in that area. But it's not thinking about the St. Lawrence that keeps me up at night ..... it's NW Ontario.
5300162,adempsey2.0,2017-01-29 21:06:00,612,"This is my take on it:a) Population density and accessibility - much higher in Southern and Eastern Ontario; that means more virgin and less pressured lakes in Western Ontario. ~40% of the population of Canada is in Ontario alone. Over 90% of them live in Southern Ontario. That's a lot of fishing pressure!b) More lakes - a lot more lakes, especially larger ones, and major water systems in Western Ontario compared to Eastern and Southern Ontario.c) Easier access for those from the USA - users on here are from the USA and many come from the states where the drive to Western Ontario is easyd) Lodges in Western Ontario focus on the USA for business - most of their clientele are from the USAe) More Remote - less populated and a more remote feel. You wont' see many, if any at all, cottages on a lot of lakes out west.Still, some great fishing and camps out here. I haven't done much traveling out west myself. Even though I live in Ontario, it's a 15 hour drive for me to get to Thunderbay and 20 hours to Red Lake."
5301146,spoonchucker,2017-01-30 10:54:00,82,"Fished Quebec, NE Ontario, Nw Ontario, Manitoba and Sask. Ne Ontario Lakes are the least desirable - although you can fly out of Cochrane to some good fishing, but as you move west there is a definite difference. I heard the stories about the Sudbury nickel mine doing damage to the smaller lakes N and Ne and don't know how true its, but I can tell you that I flew out of Sudbury to fish on a few occasions and it was not at all comparable to lakes flying out of Nakina. My French River trip was a total bust, but that could just be we were not skilled enough, same as my trips to Nippising. I think there is big difference in fishing pressure as you go west and maybe in the management of the fisheries too...."
5301250,Pooch,2017-01-30 11:45:00,4618,"Years ago I read a long lost article about fisherman going to Canada and the conclusion was that most folks tend to go more or less straight north from where they live.Can't tell you where I read it, but I think it came from a Canadian sourced paper.Pooch"
5301586,martinbns,2017-01-30 15:39:00,1520,"Probably true, Canada is pretty wide. If live in Upstate NY, you have to drive maybe 1,000 km to get away from people into NE Ontario or NW Quebec, if you chose to go to Lac Seul it would be more like 2,500 km."
5301834,fishron,2017-01-30 17:36:00,317,"Also agree with Pooch. I live in SE Pennsylvania and my many trips to Canada have been due north. I wouldn't debate that NW Ontario rules when it comes to great accessibility to superior fishing. That being said, I can't think of a trip I've made that was a total disappointment. Perhaps one trip I suggested to the French River where they had recently dropped the river 40 inches and completely put the fishing off. Not the lodges fault and we did find some fast walleye fishing at the end of the trip. I've fished the St Lawrence, many of the SE Ontario Lakes, Lady Evelyn three times, (always gave me a trophy or two each trip and big numbers on certain days), Cabonga in Quebec many times and great fishing until they messed with the water level. Big pike, big walleye, and decent lake trout. Nothing compares to my three flyins to Lac Hebert in Quebec. Never saw numbers and quality of walleye that we had there. I did have a night with a friend on the St Lawrence where the bag was filled with walleye from 8 to 12 pounds. I've got a few more trips left in me and I might just take the two day drive to one of Mike Borgers spots north of Wawa. It's hard to deviate from true North but I agree it would be worth it."
5303434,Baseline,2017-01-31 10:27:00,3207,"The border crossing at International Falls is 2 hours away. So that's where I go. In 3 to 8 hours of driving I can have access to enough fishing opportunity to keep me busy. If I want to take a longer trip, I'm more likely to jump on a plane and go to Alaska, west coast, or to a saltwater location."
5304818,north560,2017-02-01 05:51:00,53,"Thanks for the input, was just curious. And by the way to us Northerners any place south of North Bay is considered Southern Ontario wouldn't catch us going that direction for fishing.: You are right though always thought going further north might be fun one day."
5305106,HeHooksHimself,2017-02-01 08:34:00,725,"I agree with most of the other posters. However, the deal breaker for me is the beautiful I Falls/ Ft. Frances border crossing. The smell of fresh air and the scenic waterway really gets us ready for NW Ontario. Fish On! Hooks"
5305186,MrSimon,2017-02-01 09:19:00,922,"Like Fishron, I live in SE Pennsylvania. I've fished the St. Lawrence and a bunch of lakes and rivers in Eastern Ontario. It's nice there with some good fishing, no doubt. And the short 8-10 hour drive is nice. But, we regularly make the 20-24 hour drive to NW Ontario for one simple reason ..... the fishing/scenery/experience is on a whole other level. If I lived in the mid-west or the upper mid-west .... I'd never even consider eastern Ontario."
5305234,northernbite,2017-02-01 09:47:00,1186,"I live in NW Pa. by Lake Erie, a great walleye Lake BTW, But my cousin and I go all the way to The pickle Lake region of NW Ontario. Why, great fishing and no people. We do about 15-18 days travel and fishing. It takes us 2 1/2 days to get home from up there! Worth every mile. I also do the straight up from here into northern Ontario, have great time with a number of friends, but no where near the quality of fishing in the NW corner. This is my take, very lucky to still be able to go.Paul"
5298610,north560,2017-01-29 08:02:00,53,"Been reading posts for a while and it seems most people have definite preference for Northwestern Ontario fishing, what is more appealing in the west than Eastern Ontario."
5298658,elkman99,2017-01-29 08:20:00,180,"For me its mainly just because that is where I have always gone from the first time my neighbors took me to Perrault Falls. Plus, as a musky fisherman, the majority of the lakes reside there. The beauty and great fishing keep me going back. Having said that, I have always thought a trip to the French River would be a wonderful adventure. The pictures look beautiful and different than NW Ontario and is something I will venture to someday in the near future."
5298746,The tank,2017-01-29 08:43:00,340,For us it's closer. We've tried a couple lakes years back(suggested by others) on the east side. My opinion is west side fishing is better and the Canadians on the west side are very friendly and most on the east side not so much.
5298754,martinbns,2017-01-29 08:45:00,1520,"Having fished both, NW has more water, more fish and almost no people. A good combination for an excellent fishery."
5298946,BornToFish,2017-01-29 10:06:00,1224,"Greetings,My thoughts follow the last two posts. NW Ontario is much closer for my wife and I when traveling. We chose wisely in terms of lake/lodge for our first fishing trip. We were hooked! Our fishing trips are much more than just about the fishing.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5299034,LOW1,2017-01-29 10:52:00,2828,"Canada is huge and I am 100% sure that you can easily find wonderful fishing opportunities and good friendly people anywhere.For us NW Ontario is a day's drive away so its convenient.The other issue is population. Frequently (with notable exceptions) better water quality and scenery and fishing exists further away from population centers. The further east you go in Ontario the more likely you are to run into the effects of both Canadian and American population centers. The Toronto area, for example has something like 1/3 of the entire population of Canada in it. NW Ontario has a good balance of facilities to make a vacation enjoyable and still has good fishing.That being said, I would love to go to Newfoundland or Labrador. It's beautiful and I am sure you can find great fishing also. But its also a 2 or 3 day drive for us."
5299186,Aspencreek,2017-01-29 11:48:00,2911,"We live in WI, so we are closer to NW ontario and Manitoba. Although I have considered area more eastern the old saying ""bird in the hand"" comes to mind and go back to what has worked in the past. Plus, I'm not going to leave fish to chase fish."
5299210,Obabikon,2017-01-29 11:58:00,2370,"As someone who actively tracks where hundreds (if not thousands) of guests are coming from.... I believe it has to do more with being in the midwest. Seems like a high percentage of people in Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois... etc. are outdoorsmen (and women). That could be because there's more opportunities in the midwest, but most guests are going to NW Ontario, simply because it is the closest piece of Canada offering what they're looking for."
5299250,martinbns,2017-01-29 12:18:00,1520,"If you live one day from LOTW, it's quite a bit more than a 2-3 day drive to Newfoundland. With ferry times etc more 5-6."
5299282,Rich B,2017-01-29 12:31:00,1081,"For what it's worth, I started fishing Canada in Eastern Ontario in the mid 80's (sounds like a long time ago - ha), after fishing Ohio, northern Minn and lower Michigan lakes prior to that time. While the NE Ontario ""drive-in"" fishing was better than fishing in Ohio (outside of Lake Erie) as well as these other areas; there is no comparison with the available quality of drive-in fishing in NW Ontario. Now if you're comparing ""fly-in"" lakes that may be a closer comparison, but for any waters that are ""drive-in"" NE Ontario doesn't compare. Have fished Georgian Bay, Trent-Severn Riverway, French River, North Channel, Chapleau area lakes and LLE....all are OK to decent fisheries, but day in and day out the fishing in NW Ontario is far much better. I wish it were otherwise, as it's a long day's drive to many of these NE waters compared to 2 long days on the road for the NW Ontario waters. Most likely there are a number of reasons for this difference, as previously mentioned (larger population hitting these waters, more airborne pollution (over decades), and some overfishing years ago all contributed to the present status. Also worth mentioning is that there may be a lake here and there in NE Ontario that compares with the fishing in NW Ontario, but overall the waters appear to have more fishing pressure, and reflect same. If I believed otherwise, I'd be fishing more time in NE Ontario; though I'm headed once again for the Spring Opener to NW Ontario (voting with my $ and time). Rich B"
