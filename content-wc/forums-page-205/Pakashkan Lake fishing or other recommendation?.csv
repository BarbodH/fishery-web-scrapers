Looking for information on Pakashkan lake in the Graham area? Info on the resort/Lodge on the lake? Then more importantly, any tips or comments on the walleye and northern fishing quality? How, when, where on this lake? Looking at the 3rd week of June timeframe. Or is there another time of the year recommended? I've already searched this message board, just looking to add to what I already read, and just trying to avoid surprises to a new lake. Or feel free to give recommendations on another quality lake? Prefer not to trailer boat to other lakes (but willing to for quality), just like keeping my boat on one lake, and come and go as we want. And don't want to travel 10-20 miles to far reaches of a lake. Looking for walleye numbers and large northern lake, smallmouth too, but only a 3rd priority. Want a resort that offers camping as an option to keep the trip costs down. A low cost cabin recommendation is good too. Thanks!"
