507950,Guest,2000-06-24 21:35:00,0,"Jay, J.P. again...Back to guides Shawn is very good also( but he may no longer be there)..Your best bet is get Eli or his son Walter or another family member for a guide...Note...I have to Makok twice.. did stay at the lodge.. the people there were great..very helpful..Dock help very good also..Steve is still there.. I believe..But have heard the family has sold the other two lodges...""Walleye Alley"" was good ...But, that late in the year.. I do not think it would very good for walleyes..They have marked some good spots w/ jugs..down from the Island you eat shore lunch at...Also the point just up the from the lodge is easy fishing w/ a Hot'n'tot 10 -16 ft trolling ask Steve...The bay & points across from ""Walleye Alley"" were very good..Back trolling jigs w/ tail ..caught a few 7-8 pounds there..Look for schools of bait fish on your depth finder walleye will be there..Also watch out for some showls up from the lodge they go out pretty far ( 100 yards +)They drop to 16 -24 ft...You can find fish off of them...I'm wish I was going there this year...I'm going w/ some friends to ""Buck & Bingwood"" out of Hornepayne not as good of a lake but still good fishing..Leave some fish there!!!! Sorry but I'm a catch & release fisherman...Hope you have a great time..Once again ...it can get pretty rough on that lake be careful..."
507948,Guest,2000-06-26 12:20:00,0,"Dan,Received your marked up map via fax. Just wanted to thank you for taking the time to do that. It should be a big help.We did hear about the sandy point but our exploits have not taken us to that spot yet. We will correct that this year.It is interesting to note that the spot you call out directly across from the lodge as ""good looking pike water but never caught anything of size"". I had been studying this map and was thinking that that area should be a major pike player. Feeder creek, expansive shallow flat adjacent to main lake basin. Still worth a try anway.As for down by the outpost...I think I caught one walleye and another guy caught a couple. Other than that, all pike. Maybe that will change being it will be later in the year.Again, thanks. And I will post here on how we did!"
507939,Guest,2000-05-18 11:31:00,0,"I will be fishing this body of water during mid August and wanted to know the preferred methods for putting fish in the boat, trolling?, jigging?, casting? and the preferred baits associated with each. Pike and walleyes are abundant in the Albany but what do they like at Makok? Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks!!"
507940,Dan,2000-06-12 20:54:00,325,"I have fished Makok 4 times and have had outstanding walleye and northern fishing each time. However, we have always been there early in the season. As a result, we have fished primarily the western inlet of the lake known as""Walleye Alley."" Jigging for walleye and trolling for pike (various spoons). It is myunderstanding that as the season progresses more fishing is done at the eastern end of the lake (in the Albany itself) and along the southern shore of the lake off of the numerous points.2 pieces of advice :1. Get a guide early in the week (call ahead andschedule one). Makok is a large lake. The guides will put you on the action right out of the gate. They are well worth the cost. I cannot emphasize this enough. Our first trip there we figured we were good enough fishermen to get by without any help. Three days in we swallowed our pride, spent the day with Eli, and have nothad another bad day fishing there. We still get a guide our first full day there each year to make sure we are not wasting any time.2. Call Steve Liddle at the Lodge (807-242-1220)He has been running the place since 1993 and cantell you what lures to bring and techniques will be most productive while you are there. Hope you have a good time. Post how you did when you return."
507941,Guest,2000-06-13 06:32:00,0,"DanThanks for the information, I really appreciate it and will apply it when I'm there in mid August. Thanks again!!"
507942,Guest,2000-06-13 10:03:00,0,"Dan,I am Jay's boat partner and have been for a long time. We had a great time at Makok and are really looking forward to this years trip.Couple questions...first, would it be possible to fax a map to you and have you mark up hotspots for us?Secondly, how did your group do? Anything caught that was particularly noteworthy? What kind of numbers were you putting in the boat?Thanks again for your response."
507943,Dan,2000-06-21 19:55:00,325,"Andrew : Sorry it took me so long to respond. I would be happy to mark a map. Fax it to me at 614-566-6792. However, the information that Steve and the guides at the Lodge give you will be much more valuable. We have done very well each time we have been at Makok. Our group goes to Makok every odd numbered year and tries a different ""more remote, newly openned"", one cabin lake out of Armstrong or Pickle Lake each even numbered year. Each time we go to one of the other places I come home vowing to simply go to Makok every year. Given our repeated good sucess and the excellent service we receive at Makok, we will likely stop trying other places soon. We spend one day each time fishing for speckled trout in the Albany River. The rest of the time is spent 90% walleye and 10% pike fishing. As a result, each time our best pike of the week has come on a jig while fishing for walleye. Best pike per year vary from 38"" to 40"" - not giant but interesting on jig and 6 or 8 lb. test. Walleye - bad day 10 - 30 per boat. Good day 60 - 100+. Size Up to 9 lbs. Most 2 - 4 lbs. but enough 5 - 7s to make it interesting. We primarily jig fish (although hit the mayfly hatch in June one year when trolling crankbaits was much more effective.) We always take live bait - nightcrawlers - and in May alsoget minnows in Nakina (Pennock's Tourist Service807-329-5265 across from the regular airport). We likely do not need the live bait, but I always take it and use it because I would hate myself to not take it one time and have that be the time when things were tough. Usually use a jig with a Powerbait grub tipped with a minnow or part of a crawler. Good luck."
507945,Dan,2000-06-22 05:20:00,325,"Andrew - I also should add, we always have a depthfinder. Take your own or call up and reserve one of theirs."

507944,Guest,2000-06-22 06:08:00,0,"Dan,Thanks for the response and I will fax the map later today (6/22/00). The group I go with (6 total) are totally against jigging in that we find it boring. For some reason we just love to troll. Although this year, as hard as it is to say, we might try drift jigging.Two of the group are totally into walleye. My partner and I are totally into pike, and walleye fish during pike ""off"" times, or walleye ""on"" times. But we particularly love casting for pike.The other two in the group fall somewhere in between.It is interesting to note your high regards for the hospitality of the lodge on Makok. We stayed and are staying at the outpost and we get the feeling we are the embarressing cousin or uncle in the family. The refridgerators didn't work well and when we mentioned it they didn't do anything...not even come to the cabin to check it out. We were forced to lug ice every day from the lodge to the cabin. Had to change boats due to massive leakage. Also had to change props due to previous users leaving nothing but nubbins for blades. I didn't go there to perform maintenance for them, I came to fish. All in all, a bunch of things that could have been avoided by simple, and I would say typical pro-activeness of any lodge. The only reason we are going back is the fishing. On that there is no arguement...simply excellent.Sorry, didn't mean to go off on that tangent...I will be calling them today as I just received our invoice for this August. Anyway, again thanks for marking up the map (I will fax it by lunch time)."

507949,Guest,2000-06-24 20:20:00,0,"Jay, Hot'tot work well 10 - 14 ft.....Jigs ..##### anything works well on that lake.. .it kicks....but watch it ...it can get rough...Big time rough....Get a guide one day for sure...for walleyes ask for Walter or his father ..have him take you to Washi Lake for the day...Book him ahead..before you go...also see about 16ft boats now...you may need it one windy day...Walter and Father grew up on that lake....they are very good guides. Ask about the sand bar on the other side of the lake...Bring some big jerk baits..Big Pike !!!! Also down at end passed where the river comes in ..Big Pike....My bother-in-law caught a 40"" pike & My mother-in-law caught a 30"" walleye good lake all around...Just have a great time.."
