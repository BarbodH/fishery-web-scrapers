508718,docIN,2000-06-24 11:07:00,120,Has anyone had any experience using these travelers checks? Do all merchants except these as legal tender?My local AAA sells these at the current exchange rate with no fees.Thanks for the info.

508720,acp,2000-06-24 16:05:00,156,There's a problem with using a credit card if the facility figures charges in US dollars which is quite common.If the proprietor doesn't due an accurate conversion from US to Canadian dollars you can get screwed real bad or on the other hand make out quite well.Just food for thought.Later....Al
