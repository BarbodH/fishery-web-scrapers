We caught some perch on the NE side and I was wondering if that same action will continue on the NW side of the flowage. Also, I know you have to leave the skin on the fish that you clean up there for pike and walleye but are you required to leave it on for perch as well? Any information given is greatly appreciated, thanks!-Nick"
508651,Guest,2000-06-21 15:23:00,0,You need to leave the skin on ANY fish you catch. It'd be pretty hard for the CO to tell a small perch filet from a small walleye filet if there's wasn't the patch of skin on it.
