508640,Moose,2000-06-22 13:28:00,248,"I just booked my trip for next year to Manotak Lodge. #####://www.duenorth.net/manotak/Will be my first time personally, but everything I read tells me it's gonna be great. It's a drive in with fly out day trips...not sure if that qualify's for ya. I think your budget of $850 will have plenty of room for beer...thats a good thing...lol Taking a group of 14 guys June 15 next year...cant wait. Be happy to tell ya more about why I picked it if your interested...EMAIL me at [email protected]...Good Luck"
508641,Guest,2000-06-22 14:07:00,0,"Randy,You may want to look into the place I go to every year. It has everything that you want but it is typical to catch northerns over 40 inches everyday!!! I just got back form this place and the weather was terrible (we did not see the sun for six straight days and we had an east wind the entire time) but we still managed to catch all trout we wanted up to 16 lbs and all the eyes we wanted up to 11 lbs. Due to the weather the northern fishing was slow but did manage 4 between 15 and 20 lbs. You will have to expand your budget if you want to go there for a week with meals by about 15% but it is definately worth it. The price includes flight in and out, all meals, fishing on four lakes. You could get closer to to your budget if you went for five or four days however. Meals are optional. You can bring and cook your own. The flights are out of red lake E-mail me if you want more info. [email protected]. Good luck and let me know if I can help."
508642,Guest,2000-06-22 22:03:00,0,"Was at Manotak (Perrault Lake) last September.Walleye was good for shore lunch size fish early and late only. Pike fishing was very slow. Only one 30"". This lake is very accessible,i.e. ....lots of public pressure. The lodge was okay.This was my first Canada trip, but I hope there is better places than this, but the time you are going might be better than in the fall. good luck."
508643,Moose,2000-06-23 06:48:00,248,Thanks for the report...although it is a bit sobering...We'll hope June is better fishing...Had a very similar experience at Kenora a couple yrs ago. But if the poker Gods are good to me and the beer stays cold...all will be well...Did you do a day trip flyin by chance??Thanks...can EMAIL me at [email protected] if ya like...
508644,Guest,2000-06-23 06:55:00,0,I was at Manotak in Sept. last year too and would agree that the fishing was fairly slow. With the comment though that the weather was horrible for two straight weeks before we got there and for the first few days we were there too.Best luck we had was a stretch of water right in front of the cabin pulling bottom bouncers and spinners. Also saw some pretty awsome smallmouth caught and one of the guys in the group did manage a pretty nice Pike.The folks there were really nice and we did have a good time!
