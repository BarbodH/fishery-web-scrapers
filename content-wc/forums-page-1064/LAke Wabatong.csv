508744,Guest,2000-06-26 05:35:00,0,"Went up there in late May / Early June in 1997. Had some decent success with walleye way up near the fish sanctuary...where the lake narrows between the northern and southern halves. Also had some luck in Moose Bay, near the creek inlet, and some decent luck inside Tie Bay along the shore in about 4' - 6' of water along the weed edge. Didn't see many pike this time of year, no bass whatsoever. It was quite cold and only about 4 weeks after ice-off though. As the weather warmed during the week, our success got better. I remember our guides saying the walleye move further toward the south end of the lake as the summer progresses...they stack up on points that run off into deeper water. There's a lot of those. Where are you staying, Loch Island Lodge, Camp Lochalsh or Errington's?"
