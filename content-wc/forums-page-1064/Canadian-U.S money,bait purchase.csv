I wasnt considering purchasing bait,because I believe the resort I am staying at probably has everything I need.But I have been told by several people,that they may not have leeches ,and I should consider bringing my own.I am familiar with the border rules,and know I cant bring them accross.So where can I Buy bait after crossing at I Falls and will I need Canadian money? Or do they take US currency? Also what would I expect to Pay for a lb of Leeches? Or would they be selling them in some metric quantity? Advise please .Thanks in advance!"
508572,Guest,2000-06-18 19:23:00,0,i just returned from sioux lookout they willtake us currency but the exchange rate at banks is60% but if you purchase in canada with us dollarsthey will only give 70 to 80 % you need to exchangeyour spending money before entering canada
508573,Guest,2000-06-19 11:17:00,0,"When in Canada use Canadian funds. If you can, go to a bank to exchange funds. The next best thing is to use Visa aor Master Card. You will get the NY exchange rate for that day. Be aware that there are a lot of bait shops that won't take credit cards. I always use CA cash. There is a money exchange in the tourist information center located just across the I-Falls bridge as you enter Canada. You will get the best rate less 3% commission. You can also change any left over currency at a US bank or at the money changer. Don't trust that the resort has everything you need. They may advertise that they do, but all to often their anticpated bait delivery doesn't show up. Several years ago I stayed at a fly in camp for 5 days that couldn't supply a minnow because their supplier's plane broke down. I highly recommend Rainy Lake Baits in Fort Francis. They are located on HWY 11 just east of downtown Fort Francis. You will have to go right past them on the way to HWY 502. TGG"

508575,Guest,2000-06-20 14:39:00,0,"Change your money at one of the bank machines on the main drag in Fort Frances, if you have a bank card. The best place for bait is Rainy Lake Sport and Tackle. It is situated next to the river on the east side of town. You will drive right past it on your way to eagle. You can reserve your leeches ahead of time, give them a call at 807-274-6429 or fax at 807-274-7553.Good Luck.Jeff"

It is the ONLY way to get the absolute best transaction rate available. You get whatever the internation exchange rate is without paying any penalty whatsoever. If you buy cash at a bank or anywhere else, whether it is in the states or Canada, you will pay a fee of some sort. I've been going to Birch Point camp on Rainy at the end of Hwy 613 for almost 30 years and for the last 10 I have been bring virtually zero Canadian currency. Put everything on the tab and pay for it when I leave with the debit card. Mike."
