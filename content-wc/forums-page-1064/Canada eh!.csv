508711,Guest,2000-06-23 13:04:00,0,"new to the board and you all seem rationali`m canadian and have fished n/w Ont for many years primarily out of Nakina the fish appear to be plentiful and have had good fortune every-year.for the walleye twister tails and tubes appear to work consistently. I have used leeches that i caught while there: from earlier posts i get the thought that i`m breaking the law if i grab a fewleeches. What is the law??? am i not allowed to catch leeches....and if i can, Americans can`twheres the logic there??ps. not that using leeches has improved the fishing on slow days, but a change sometimes etc.thanks"
