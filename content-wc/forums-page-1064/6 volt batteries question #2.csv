508757,fishhead,2000-06-26 00:31:00,48,Is there any way to convert these older units to use d-cell batteries???? I'd think it would be cheaper but not sure how long the d's would last....
508758,Pooch,2000-06-26 10:20:00,4619,"I would stick with the six volts. ""D"" cells are more readily available and easier to pack, but my very unscientific hunch thinks that the six volts have more volume of chemical so they will most likely outlast the ""D"" cells. Maybe somebody else on the board has some practical experience. Surely batteries are rated in amp hours or something, so folks like us could compare them. Hope others read this because now you have me curious. What kind of locater are you converting?Take care.Pooch"
508759,Guest,2000-06-26 12:21:00,0,I use 10 amp hour rechargeable sealed lead acid batteries. I use a milliamp charger. When I go on long trips I bring two. They will last you for many years if you fully discharge them before charging. You can buy the batteries at any Electrical supply house. They are the same batteries that go in emergency lighting packs. They cost about 25-30 Canadian.The milli amp charger is available at any electronics components store. They are about 15 Canadian. Do not use a regular charger. They will overheat and damage your battery if you forget about it. Good fishing: Frank
