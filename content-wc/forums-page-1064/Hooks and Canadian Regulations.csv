508693,Guest,2000-06-22 08:09:00,0,"Ontario's fishing regulations state:""Unless otherwise stated, each angler may use only one line, except for ice fishing. A fishing line must not have more than four hooks. On anartifical lure, a gang containing up to three hooks is considered to be one hook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks and a treble hook counts as three hooks.""Here is my question...Is a production lure, say a Hot-n-Tot, considered to be one ""hook""? Or as a production lure with two ""gangs"", and counted as two hooks.Say, for instance, I am running a three way rig with a hot-n-tot and a flutter spoon. There are two production lures...yet three trebles. Is this two ""hooks"" or three."

Sometimes it take a Philadelphia lawyer to interpret these darn regulations.Later....Al"
508695,Karl,2000-06-22 10:05:00,63,"Doesn't matter how many hooks are on one lure, just don't use more than one lure. The rig you mentioned is definitely contrary to the regulation."
508696,Guest,2000-06-22 11:13:00,0,"Karl,I believe you are incorrect. I actually found out about three way trolling a spoon and hot-n-tot from an article in a In-Fisherman Walleye magazine. The article was about fishing in Ontario. Also, this is a popular rig on Erie, the Detroit River, and Lake St. Claire."
508697,Guest,2000-06-22 11:21:00,0,"The more I think about this the more I believe I can answer my own question.On an artificial lure each treble can be considered one hook. If it wasn't, and each hook on a treble counted as a hook, then the Hot-n-tot would be illegal since it would have six hooks. Since you are allowed four hooks, then my three way rig of a flutter spoon (one hook), and the hot-n-tot (two hooks), is still below the limit of four hooks.The ""in all other situations"", to me means anything other than ""artificial"". Such as live bait rigs. In this case a treble would be considered 3 hooks.You got to love the careful wording of laws. Especially since ignorance of the law is no excuse."

508699,Guest,2000-06-22 12:30:00,0,"OK here it is right from a conservation officer, Tom Greene. My buddy called and personally talked to him.""I just talked to conservation officer Tom Greene out of Geraldton and the max amount of trebels allowed in the water at one time per rod is four. This can be one lure with 4 trebels, two lures with 2 each, or four lures with 1 each. Three way rigs as we troll them are not in violation."""
