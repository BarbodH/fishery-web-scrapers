508606,Guest,2000-06-19 21:52:00,0,Won't be able to get up to Reed Lake this year. If any one has been up there I would like to know how things are. I had trouble catching decent sized eyes the last two years.
508607,Guest,2000-06-21 22:56:00,0,i'll let you in a little secret. I don't know what you've been doing but we just killed the eyes on minnows sprayed down with wd40.
