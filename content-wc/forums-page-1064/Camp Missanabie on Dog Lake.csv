508214,Guest,2000-06-09 05:44:00,0,Fished Dog lake about 20 years ago...caught eyes & pike trolling rapalas past weed beds in shallows. Far side of lake near RR tressel is a good spot for eyes using spinners. This was a long time ago...before all the new age tackle..we caught eyes using mepps spinners trailed witha minnow. Be careful of the rivers coming off of Dog L...My Dad & I almost killed ourselves trying to go down in a canoe...better to portage to the bottom! Good luck.

Later I switch to crawler harnesses. Was there over Memorial Day by myself and caught close to 100 walleyes in 2 1/2 days. All on jigs and minnows. Bugs will be bad especially if weather is warm. There is slot size on lake (14 3/4"" to 17"") any in slot must be returned. 80 % of fish that I catch fall in the slot. Hope this helps.Bucks"
