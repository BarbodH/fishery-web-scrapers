508604,Guest,2000-06-19 14:24:00,0,Anyone know where the eyes are this time of year. I'm heading up this weekend...although it's opening bass weekend I'd rather hook into a nice pickeral. I'm fishing a deep clear water lake. Any advice is appreciated. I'd really like some advice on where to fish during the day! Seems like the only time we catch em is at night.

The key to my daytime success has always the first dropoff after a narrows or neckdown area near where you catch the fish at dusk or night. The deeper the are the better, at least 25ft. If panfish are troublesome to your crawlers or leeches try using large minnows or chubs. One other good option is a jigging spoon tipped with a minnow, strip of sucker (one large muskie sucker can be fileted into strips, salted and kept for several days in a ziplock in your cooler)or a strip of perch flesh. Hopkins spoons, Rocker minnows and Swedish Pimples of around 1/2 ounce and up have worked for me."
