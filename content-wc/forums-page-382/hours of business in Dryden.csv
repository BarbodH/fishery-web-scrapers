1748025,bigwalleye1,2013-05-06 05:50:00,2632,There are several banks in I falls that will exchange American for Canadian funds if you have an account with them.. Found that out the hard way. I exchange at home before I go.
1749185,SinOrSwim,2013-05-06 11:03:00,1528,"We used to exchange money but we haven't for several years. We always used the visitor center across from the customs area in Fort Frances. With the exchange rates being so similar we don't spend enough US money to worry about a little higher fee at a particular gas station or restaurant. Plus, we only put in as much gas we think we will need to get back. In addition, many times we have forgotten to re-exchange money on the way back to the US. It's not worth the time or effort but the money we bring back and can't be spent makes up for any extra fees there might be.Good advice to call credit card. Will usually work the first time but get denied the second time."
1749601,benn,2013-05-06 13:04:00,48,"We used to stop at the visitor center in Fort Frances as well, but the last several years decided to skip that. When the US dollar was stronger than the Canadian, we probably came out ahead by stopping. Now that they are about par, it doesn't seem to matter as much. We have a guy in the group who uses his Safeway card for the groceries and another that likes to use his credit card (for the points) for gas. If we go out to eat or something like that we pay in US funds. Most small stores don't even bother with the exchange now. Our resort charges in US so we bring plenty of cash and pay for the resort in cash. They like that better than a check or credit card."

My wife is taking it to Europe this summer. As far as telephone calls, sign up with One Suite for a $10 deposit into an escrow account. They will give you a Canadian access number. I call home for 2.9 cents per minute. Then the phone company gets me for 55 cents for using the pay phone in camp. When you get back home, you can use up the remainder of the $10. Been doing it for years, no problem yet."
1751185,bigdaddyguns,2013-05-06 21:47:00,608,"Up at Perrault Falls I was able to use my cell phone (T-Mobile) to call home at the roaming rate of $0.59/minute which I found acceptable. Just a friendly reminder if you do take a phone across the border to shut off data roaming as 1.0 GB of data will cost you $10,000 or so in Canada."
1742969,JayM5209,2013-05-04 09:03:00,1050,"bigdaddyguns, I always decide which cards I'm going to use when in Canada and then call the 1-800- customer service number on the back of each card to let them know when I'll be travelling. Our cards are readily accepted in Canada, but the automated security programs of the card companies may flag a transaction and refuse it. It happened to me twice before I started calling before the travel. A phone call from me resolved the issue and the vendor got paid, but it's just a hassle. The systems see an unusual location or charge of an unusual size - unusual given my history with that card - and red flag it as possibly a stolen card or fraudulent use. A quick pre-trip call will avoid the issue."
1743057,Golden Eagle,2013-05-04 09:33:00,2642,I have a Safeway card that saves our group a few bucks every once in a while. A safeway receipt also allows for a discount at their gas station in Dryden. About 15 years ago a Dryden Safeway manager and her husband had an auto accident in Tenness and came to my office to buy insurance on a newly purchased auto. Instead of making the sale I called their agent in Dryden and added the unit to their existing policy. I drew attention of other Safeway employees in Dryden when I shopped with them the next May and got a big hug from their manager.
1743449,NARDA 1,2013-05-04 11:44:00,636,"[QUOTE=bigdaddyguns;1742953]At the Safeway in Dryden (or Canada in general) can you buy beer or do you have to purchase at a LCBO? In Dryden beer has to be purchased at ""The Beer Store"" 79 Queen St. 807-223-2263. Hard liquor has to be purchased at ""The LCBO Store"" 99 King St. 807-223-4029. If you are going towards Vermillion Bay you can buy both beer and liquor at the one LCBO Store, Highway 17 & Tower Rd. 807-227-2041. Smaller towns usually have a single store and larger towns separate the beer and liquor into two stores."
1743665,bobbylfishermon,2013-05-04 12:58:00,241,"All great advice, especially calling your credit cards and let them know you are traveling and where, and USE your credit cards as much as you can, a lot of camps even take credit cards."
1743705,stillangling,2013-05-04 13:05:00,149,"As stated by the previous poster, there are separate beer and liqour stores. You will still be able to buy beer in the liqour stores BUT you will pay about 20% more for beer in the liqour store. In the smaller towns that only have an LCBO (liqour) you will be able to buy beer at Beer Store prices...but even that means getting gouged. Such is the Socialist country that I call home. Be prepared to get b%ned if you intend to spend US dollars during your trip this summer. I have some US money left over from a trip south. Even though the dollar is pretty much at par, I paid 12% at the Husky in Fort Frances to use US dollars for gas yesterday. I gave up 10% at a store in Kenora today. Yikes! I would suggest getting at least some money converted at your local bank before travelling north."
1743825,Nimstug,2013-05-04 14:22:00,2605,"If you plan on making phone calls from Canada to the US, consider picking up a $10 (at most) calling card. We get our from the Safeway. A collect call from a phone booth 3-4 minutes will cost over $20. Yes, there are phone booths. If your lodge has a phone or radio phone, you'll avoid any charges they may add. I think a $10 card is good for 120 minutes. My son and I check in at home about 3 times a week and come nowhere closeto using it up. We leave the card for the next group. Nimstug"
1744025,wallydave,2013-05-04 15:21:00,2151,"The banks in the States, at least the local credit union will charge a fee for exchanging currency. Does anyplace in I Falls exchange currency?"
1744169,skindzier,2013-05-04 16:29:00,137,"I'll reiterate what other folks have said about credit cards. I never exchange money either. I use my debit card almost exclusively and I get the real exchange rate, plus my bank charges me 1% for the transaction. Both camps I've gone to in recent years take credit cards - one adds 3% to cover their costs - I can't remember if the other adds or not. I always take $400 - $500 US cash just in case but typically use very little of it. All in all, well worth avoiding the hassle of exchanging money (to me at least)."
1746841,bigdaddyguns,2013-05-05 17:15:00,608,Thanks to all for the information it has been very helpful and much appreciated. I did find the Beer Store has a web site (http://www.thebeerstore.ca/) which is really informative providing the beers sold at each location as well as an inventory count with prices. I assume they take credit cards too for payment.
1746977,zeebee,2013-05-05 18:21:00,1144,"They do accept CC's.Some CC companies gouge you on exchange rates. Might add 3- 10% to the going rate. If it matters to you, pick up some CDN currency before heading up. The exchange rate charged varies widely amongst the CC companies."
1740681,revitup,2013-05-03 13:49:00,140,"Hi guys. I will be heading up towards our lodge on Saturday morning June 8. We will have a few chores to do and want to get them done and still get to lodge when it opens. We will need to get some groceries, liquor and also exchange some money. We will be crossing at Fort Frances and going through Dryden and Vermilion Bay on way towards Cedar Lake. When do these businesses open in Dryden, Fort Frances or Vermilion Bay? Would like to cross border before the heavy traffic starts, so I am thinking Dryden is best to do all these things. Any help is appreciated. Thanks. Revitup"
1740825,Blue Lk,2013-05-03 14:27:00,269,"THe liguor stores (LCBO) open at 10 am in Ontario,most grocery stores open at 9 am.Why would you wait to exchange your $,no banks open on the weekends & most stores will charge you a premium to change your money.Change it at your bank before you leave."
1740833,Guest,2013-05-03 14:28:00,0,Cross the border at 6:00 a.m. and stop at the LaPlace Rendezvous for breakfast as you are leaving Ft. Frances. It's a two hour drive from there to Dryden where you can stop at the Safeway grocery store and LCBO store if necessary. Mill around there a bit and arrive at camp around noon. This is our normal routine and it works great for us.

1742377,revitup,2013-05-04 05:42:00,140,"Thanks for the responses guys--I appreciate it. Regarding exchange of money, that makes sense. Brings up another question. How much Canadian money is necessary? The resort uses American funds. I would guess that gas stations and restaurants take credit cards where the exchange is automatic. Would tips to staff matter if it were US funds or Canadian funds? We are bringing golf clubs in case we want a diversion, but again, credit cards are probably in order there. What's your experience related to how much Canadian money is necessary? Our group is 11 guys. Thanks. I must be getting pretty excited about the trip if things like this are taking up my thoughts!"
1742409,Tonyo,2013-05-04 05:57:00,212,"Just 2 thoughts. We drive over the border on Friday late afternoon and stay over in Dryden. This gives us a very lazy Saturday morning milling around Dryden and leaving at a decent time to arrive at Gullrock around 12. The second thought is, why bring any Canadian money? We have been traveling back and forth for several years and I have never exchanged money prior to going. Maybe I am missing something but we don't spend a lot of money in Canada. Some for gas, groceries, etc but most places will take our $, I know we are not getting the best exchange, but there is very little hassle and we use up our Canadian $'s on the way home. Seems to work just fine and there is no hassles. Have a great trip.. TonyO"
1742417,Shellback,2013-05-04 05:57:00,8083,"I try to use a credit card as much as possible. I have a Cabelas Visa. They charge 1% for Canadian transactions, and you get the actual rate of exchange. I have found that American banks and Canadian banks hit you with a few percent for the exchange. I'm fortunate that I have a Canadian friend to swap cash with. That way we both avoid the bank charges. If you plan to use your credit card, call them and let them know you will be using your card in Canada."
1742937,JayM5209,2013-05-04 08:53:00,1050,"revitup, in 34 yrs. and about 50 trips I've never once bothered to exchange money. Skip the time, hassle and worry. Credit card companies do the exchange automatically and US dollars spend just fine in Canada. Staff who provide you good service will appreciate the tips whether the bills have the Queen or Andrew Jackson on them. I have no idea what the exchange rate is today, but last year I think every place I paid with cash treated the currencies as equal.Enjoy your trip."
1742953,bigdaddyguns,2013-05-04 08:53:00,608,"At the Safeway in Dryden (or Canada in general) can you buy beer or do you have to purchase at a LCBO? I assume the fuel station at that Safeway accepts credit card payments. Any issues with using an American credit card beyond the exchange fees and rate conversions? I would like to purchase (via credit card) all my perishable foods, beer, and fuel at one time there is Dryden and be done with it for the trip and bypass the need for any Canadian $$$. Thanks."
1742961,revitup,2013-05-04 08:57:00,140,Good questions Bigdaddy! I'm interested in the answers to that as well!
