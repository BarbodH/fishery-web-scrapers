1756777,camp chef,2013-05-08 12:35:00,915,I don't hear much talk about Muskies in Rainy Lake. I know they are in there but perhaps only in certain areas or in numbers too small to excite real Muskie hunters. Any info? I don't chase them on pupose. Just curious as we will be fishing the East End of the lake in a couple weeks.
