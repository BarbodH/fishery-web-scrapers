1728065,J Arendt,2013-04-30 10:58:00,45,Tackleman----How are the conditions on the Bug???
1729265,tackleman,2013-04-30 15:29:00,444,"the river is just starting to open, there is a hole in the ice under the bridge that is about 25 feet long and about 8 feet wide. the creek flowing into the bug is really going so the ice should be worn away shortly if we get warm temps but today we have been having snow storms roll through. and the temps are supposed to stay below freezing for a day or so.This year the government is repairing or replacing the bridge so it may be tricky getting under it . the construction crews are just in the process of getting set up at the site and according to the newspaper the work is supposed to start in full force by the middle of May."
1730401,Golden Eagle,2013-04-30 20:33:00,2642,"Bill, where will you be sitting in your chair, smoking a cigar and fishing pike around May 16 or 17?"
1730753,tackleman,2013-04-30 23:53:00,444,"i'm on call for work those days so i'll probably be at the bug river boat launch. if i'm not there i'll be at home or work. Love to see you stop by the house, not so much work. LOL"
1730865,Tonyo,2013-05-01 04:50:00,212,"Tackleman, If the bridge is being worked on and the launch is not available where would the next place be to launch? We always use this while staying with 5 Lakes. Just curious. I'm sure it is not a big deal just wondering as I sit here waiting for our trip. TonyO"
1731009,tackleman,2013-05-01 06:04:00,444,"I don't think the launch will be closed, they can't shut down the channel to the lake, care will just have to be taken when going under the bridge"
1749697,J Arendt,2013-05-06 13:24:00,45,Tackleman-- Whats the latest on the Bug?
1749809,Golden Eagle,2013-05-06 13:58:00,2642,No response might mean the Bug is open and Bill is out there pounding huge toothies.
1749897,tackleman,2013-05-06 14:34:00,444,"sorry you put the post up while I was having my afternoon nap (but fear not, I was dreaming about fishing)I went to town this morning and the bug is making progress, there are now a few areas of blue water and they are almost to the boat launch. by opening weekend it will be open (maybe not the whole lake) but you should be able to fish the river."
1757561,Minnow Man,2013-05-08 17:18:00,85,"Hello J Arendt Drove up the hwy to-day, Bug River has open water right to Gullrock Lake. Seen Ian Cook in town owner of Five Lakes lodge & he said open water was close to his docks. Gullrock Lake ice is looking real dark, stopped in and visited with the folks at Golden Hook Camp, open water by the feeder creeks, you can't walk on the ice right now, looks like slush ice, it's ready to go out with the next strong wind, open water around the shore line & docks. Seen 5-6 float planes at the docks at the Balmertown Bridge, looks like a few of the local fly in operators have their planes ready to go. Ill see you on Gullrock for the opener."
