(although I did hear them say there may still be some paper issued licenses in the far north of the province where internet is not available.) Here is the linkhttp://environment.gov.sk.ca/licences/HAL go to the bottom of the page and click on ""enter"" where it says you need a license or to create a HAL. HAl means hunting/anging license. then click on sign up now. takes you to another page where it says to Create a New Account. then, select, 2nd choice( I am a Sask resident without a valid health card... or am not a resident. I haven't done it myself yet, but they say it is easy to do. I do know that you need a separate email address for each license applied for, which means if you and your wife/partner want a license, you will need separate email addresses. Good Luck."

Incompatible computers or operating systems, time delays, printing problems, technical glitches - those are a few of the challenges catching some vendors and users of the online licence system. ""We are taking a decades-old paper system and moving it online and there have been a few growing pains this spring,"" Environment Minister Ken Chevelday-off said in a news release Thursday. ""In support of the stakeholders who are going through this transition with us and to make sure anglers can hit the water this spring issue free, we will make paper licences available as a backup, in the event of computer problems or challenges with data entry."" The backup paper licences will be available only for this year and from vendors making the transition to the new Hunting, Trapping and Angling Licence (HAL) system. It is being managed by a U.S. company through its offices in Nashville, Tenn. Earlier this year, some outfitters and vendors, particularly in remote areas, began to raise concerns as the system was being introduced. Replacing the old, hand-written paper licences, automated licensing requires a computer, printer, high-speed Internet and a reliable online network - challenges for some northern camps or small-town businesses. The Saskatchewan Outfitters Association (SOA) welcomed the continuation of the paper licences while the kinks get straightened out. ""We've been negotiating on this all winter long ... We have to have a temporary system until we get this all into play,"" said SOA president Brian Hoffart. Hoffart, who operates a camp near Green Lake, said he personally experienced one of the glitches when him and his wife tried to register and encountered a problem because they share the same email address. ""We understand with any new system, there's going to be bumps,"" Hoffart said, adding they've made ample use of the company's tech support. He's told SOA members: ""Be patient ... It's going to be a handy, dandy thing."" But some vendors have decided the switch to an automated system isn't worth the trouble. For the first time in 26 years, Pokey's Tackle Shop in Regina isn't selling fishing licences. Owner Greg Prokopetz said it simply wasn't cost effective - given the cost of buying a computer system and accessories, the time required to key in information for each licence, and the fact a vendor only makes $1 on each licence sold. ""We're not getting enough,"" he said. The province has said it's making the move because of demand from the public. Individuals can buy their licences online through their personal computer any time; through private issuers, Ministry of Environment and select Provincial Park offices; or by phone at 1-855-848-4773.
