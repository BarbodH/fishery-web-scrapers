1763817,Guest,2013-05-10 15:09:00,0,is there anything new on this? Any first hand accounts of people crossing in the last year with a DWI?
1763841,v-bay gord,2013-05-10 15:24:00,3168,They are continuing the program started last year......here's a recent press release:http://gregrickford.ca/2013/05/06/gr...132014-season/ If you are in doubt about your ability to cross you should be able to get an opinion by contacting the border crossing where you are going (ie. Fort Francis).
1394633,LOW1,2012-02-15 08:34:00,2828,"Gerry, do you have any statistics re tourism over the last several years? How do you measure it? Non-resident licenses issued? vacancy rates? border crossings? retail sales? beer sales? Any sense as to any recent upswings?"
1394981,NP4ME,2012-02-15 20:44:00,378,"Wade B, Your question to Novo made it seem like you thought it was the norm to drink too much and then drive. Please tell me I just read the question wrong."
1397507,Sunset Country,2012-02-21 21:09:00,6,"We can count the number of US travelers that cross at Fort Frances (I-Falls) and Rainy River (Baudette) crossings. These numbers have been on a delcine last 5 years or so with some variatioons but it is a downward trend - especially since 2009. As the US economy recovers (it's taking a long time this time around) so will the numbers of Americans traveling to Sunset Country to fish. With the relaxed rules around minor criminality (e.g. DUI) we expect this to help the overall trend but I expect it to be a few years before the numbers of 2003 and 2004 return. I don't think we'll ever get back to the numbers of the good old days in the 1980s and 1990s, a lot has changed."
1397509,Sunset Country,2012-02-21 21:15:00,6,"Thanks Justin, I appreciate it.I just want our lodge operators to get a fair shake and there are no stats to prove that before the new problems surfaced at the Border way back in 2002, that we had drunk Americans driving on our highways, it just doesn't happen. Facts are hard for some people to deal with but I don't think one (relatively minor) mistake a person makes should have such far reaching consequences - such as not being allowed into Canada to go fishing.When I fish the lakes up here I often come across guys from the States and they have always been fun to talk to and in the end, are just like we are, they just live in a different country."

It is exactly how I feel now if we can just get that fairy to shuttle us between Dover & Erie."
1406633,mrpike57,2012-03-13 17:48:00,97,"One of the major reasons traffic crossing into Canada is down is the value of the dollar, the days of getting $1.50 Canadian for $1.00 American are long gone. With the increase cost of gas, etc. traffic across the border is down."
1531180,k80john,2013-01-31 02:08:00,53,Less people means less traffic on the lake. Fewer boats is why I come to Canada. Fewer people taking fewer fish means better fishing.
1531197,Skywagon,2013-01-31 05:37:00,1106,"shh, let's keep that secret."
1531219,Hawgeye,2013-01-31 06:32:00,1355,"I think the DUI issue to enter Canada was always an unfortunate Canadian decision. Most people that I know who got a DUI paid their dues and are probably the most responsible at not driving after drinking that I know. Not that I know many, I just think it was a unique decision. I also have been traveling to Canada for 35 years and if you ask me about the Canadians that I have met are no more responsible about driving after drinking than their US neighbors. We all have made mistakes, made stupid decisions etc....I also believe in paying your dues and being forgiven....once."
1534327,Sportdog,2013-02-06 19:13:00,6735,I think that our friends from the north are too smart to let their fishing decline. They do a fantastic job of managing this valuable resource and I am so glad they do.
1394389,lcwhit,2012-02-14 15:58:00,104,i've watched these two threads progress and have to grin when i hear a guy from windsor pontificate about drunk driving. more bootleg booze came thru there during prohibition than almost anywhere else. how times have changed.
1394422,JinxCanada,2012-02-14 17:23:00,1306,"LOL. what does ""bootleg"" booze have to do with drunk driving exactly? All ""prohibition"" did was make 80% of Americans criminals"
1394427,Novo10,2012-02-14 17:35:00,10,"I live here in Manitoba, all I can say say is if you can't live by the law then don't break it, and than ask if it's OK!!!! Don't worry your money you think that will save us keep it!!!"
1394433,Andre (wallyandre),2012-02-14 17:45:00,2274,It's not my intention too.If you're ask if ever been arrested and convicted for something and the answer is yes: 99% chance they will tell you: go back in you're country whatever the reason why you got a criminal record.I cross the border more then 50 times a year and luckily I don't have nothing against me.
1394461,NP4ME,2012-02-14 18:49:00,378,"Novo, I agree with you completely. I just wish the US would do as good as a job as Canada from keeping the criminals out."
1394473,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2012-02-14 19:05:00,5533,"I know a couple guys who will be happy to join us up in Canada.Novo, are you saying you've never had a beer to many and driven?"
1394498,Boots,2012-02-14 19:37:00,19,A few posts back someone said they did not know of Canadian residents being denied entry into the US. My home is in Wisconsin but I bought a trailer home in Texas a few miles from Mexico and spend my winters here in Texas. There are many Canadians here also that have purchased trailers and homes here to spend the winter. They told me even though they own property here in Texas they must be very carfull about getting any into any trouble in Canada as the US denies Canadian residents entry for the same reasons Canada denies US residents. They would not be able to come to thier winter homes in Texas.
1394505,Glenman12,2012-02-14 19:47:00,762,he wont swallow it..he'll choke on it...
1394522,Sunset Country,2012-02-14 20:33:00,6,"Jinx, it will be on the CIC website in next few days. The Government is calling this effort the ""Tourism facilitation Action Plan""RegardsGerry"
1394550,J-Man,2012-02-14 22:33:00,191,"Way to keep on top of this, Gerry. You've been a champion for NW Ontario for so long. I hope you had a drink and cigar after the conference call. See you at the spring NWOTA meeting."
1393971,Sunset Country,2012-02-13 18:54:00,6,"Hi all, Gerry Cariou, Executive Director of Ontario's Sunset Country Travel Association posting. I have great news for Americans with ONE minor criminal conviction e,g. DUi who may have been refused entry to Canada. Again this applies only if you have 1 conviction - more than one old rules apply. Here is an intial newspaper article about the changes in policy, I will post more info as I get it from the Government of Canadahttp://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...aspx?e=3468347Welcome Back! The good times (and great walleye fishing) are here once again.Regards to all.Gerry"
1393978,v-bay gord,2012-02-13 19:00:00,3168,Great news......but a bitter pill for Jinx to have to swallow.......
1393985,Juls,2012-02-13 19:04:00,13414,Come on......be nice. Please.
1393986,jkonop,2012-02-13 19:04:00,544,LMAO
1393992,Sunset Country,2012-02-13 19:21:00,6,"It was a bitter pill Gord, but better now than never...There is no downside to this from my perspective, so please pass the news on to everyone you know and ask them to do the same.RegardsGerry"
1394009,v-bay gord,2012-02-13 19:50:00,3168,"Thanks for posting that article Gerry.....and yes, there is no downside to this. Be nice, of course Juls!"
1394075,Pikehunters,2012-02-14 05:35:00,100,"We are just one group going to one town for one week. We will bring an additional 2 people due to this policy. Additional $ to the outfitter, extra lodging & restaurants. The $ envolved across Canada for all towns is unimaginable. Congaratulations maybe some of the empty motels & restaurants up the 400 will be revived!!!"
1394131,Andre (wallyandre),2012-02-14 08:10:00,2274,Wish the US border do the same. I have a couple of friends that can't cross the border because of small things that happen 30 years ago.But I doubt we will see that for coming in the US
1394191,JAY221,2012-02-14 10:02:00,877,"Andre, It is NOT my intention to make this political. Can you tell me what little things your friends did 30 years ago that keeps them out of the U.S. I always here about the U.S. citizen that can not get in to Canada but have never thought of it the other way around. Please enlighten me. Thanks, Jay"
1394239,JinxCanada,2012-02-14 11:13:00,1306,Pass me a beer :-)before you all get too excited I'd wait to see the OFFICIAL government release. So Far these reports are from tiny little newspapers without any real facts or anything in writing to explain exactly what they are planning to do.
