They also let about 7-8 feet out of Rafferty to make room for spring runoff. Season opener is May 5th, but can't see us having a dock in by then. Boundary dam may not be useable either. They let a lot of water out in case of flood, so the docks are not even close to being in the water. Also putting in a new $22,000 floating dock there as well. they will be charging a $40 seasonal docking fee, or $5 a day, besides the cost to get into the regional park. If you buy a regional park sticker($30 or $35) that would get you into boundary as well as Alameda."

Water is pretty low, but I see it has come up about 2 feet in the past week here is a place you can check the levels of Boundary and Rafferty, alamedahttps://www.wsask.ca/Lakes-and-River...er-Watershed-/ Have attached a pic of Boundary."
1720745,oldblue2008,2013-04-27 23:09:00,313,Boundary Dam today
1724153,oldblue2008,2013-04-29 08:56:00,313,"Well, if the readings are correct, Boundary Dam came up about 40 inches from Saturday night to Sunday night. Rafferty came up about 3 inches. They are letting water out of Boundary over to Rafferty through the diversion channel."
1727241,oldblue2008,2013-04-30 06:55:00,313,"So much for Boundary being low. Looking at the website above, it is full to the nuts now, so it has come up about 7 feet since Saturday night. They are also spilling a fair amount into Rafferty, from Boundary."
1727737,tlee,2013-04-30 09:06:00,65,I would say so. That came up fast!
1755641,oldblue2008,2013-05-08 07:54:00,313,"Has come up about 50 inches since May 1st, according to website. I was out there on May 6th, ice is still pretty much fully covered except down near the dam, where water is coming in thru the diversion channel. Weather has been hot, so that should help. Still looks like awhile before any docks can go in."
1761929,oldblue2008,2013-05-09 22:01:00,313,"open water on the east end, probably about 1/2 mile. Starting to open up around boat launch, water darn chilly!!! pics from today, one from on top of the dam, and other at boat launch. Cooler this weekend, and then supposed to be around 80 degrees Monday."
