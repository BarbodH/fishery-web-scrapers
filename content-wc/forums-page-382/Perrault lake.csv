1749321,JayM5209,2013-05-06 11:38:00,1050,I saw a picture last week from Jackfish Lake next door (its outlet creek flows into Perrault) and there's a LOT of ice yet. You can check out the pix at Gold Arrow Camp's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Gold-...3889737?ref=ts
1749553,team walleye,2013-05-06 12:57:00,336,Always wondered how the fish on Jackfish is. We have fished Jackfish Bay on Perrault where the creek runs in.
1749929,JayM5209,2013-05-06 14:48:00,1050,"Jackfish is a great little lake. Plenty of eyes, mostly eating size with some larger, lots of jumbo perch, some smallies, and the usual nuisance northerns. You can't get up to Jackfish from Perrault and the only place to get a boat in is at Gold Arrow Camp. It doesn't get real heavy pressure. The guests at Gold Arrow go up the creek to Pickerel Lake or spend most days trucking to cache lakes. Years ago I remember seeing a track along the creek between Jackfish and Perrault where boats used to be hauled back and forth on some kind of trolley. Don't know if any remnants of that are left or not."

Most open areas are now free of snow. We saw our first robins today. Some frost is leaving the ground. The ice on the lake turned quite dark today. There is a fair amount of open water along the shore lines, such that ducks are working the shoreline now. We measured the ice thickness yesterday near our shoreline at 10-12 inches, down from 22+ inches last week. I will not venture onto the ice any longer. The ice hasn't started moving around yet. The lake's level is improved from last autumn, but not as high as you might expect. The air temperatures are to be in the 40s-50s the next several days, with the forecast calling for some chances of rain. The chances of having open water for the opener are much improved, but it will still be a close call either way."
1755025,Kevin R,2013-05-08 05:13:00,305,Those tracks could have been from the trail to Red Lake during the gold rush. Tracks were on Twilight lake as you entered the creek going to Evening lake those tracks were from the trail not sure if they are still there now. Back in the 1970's the English River dam at Snowshoe portage still had the machine that pulled the equipment around the falls. I explored these places as a teenager was amazed how difficult that journey was. The park at ear falls has some old equipment on display.
