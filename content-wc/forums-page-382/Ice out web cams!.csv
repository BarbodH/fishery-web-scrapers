1756985,teddi,2013-05-08 13:37:00,349,I don't think the ice will be out in the goose bay area of lac seul for opener. There are some camps closer to ear falls more on the river that should be fine. It's hard to tell. I guess we will just have to wait and see.
1757041,wallydave,2013-05-08 14:04:00,2151,"Last week I got an e-mail from Andrea at Goose Bay. Some spots were open not far from camp, places with current had some openings. I saw a pic from Bow Narrow blog, some open water near flowing waters. She said they would put boats in where the water is open. Last two years we have gone in mid-June. Both years had different ice outs, the fishing was better with the late ice out! Time will tell! 37 days to go for our trip! I bet the water will be open then!?"

My prediction....May 18 for Vermilion Bay (Eagle Lake). You might want some reading material if going further north. http://www.experimentallakesarea.ca/L239cam.html"

1763209,Golden Eagle,2013-05-10 10:49:00,2642,Most of all I want ice gone for the opener so camp owners can put money in their bank account. They've had a tough few years and deserve a break. Operating costs are up and numbers of guests are down. Not good! Opening week needs to be a financial success for camp owners and local business openers.We appreciate them and want them to be around for a long time.Those guys made my life better for 54 years.
