Heading up May 12 with 2 of my kids, it will be their first trip to Gull Rock. Check out the pictures in the Goldem Hook Camp site. Temps in the high 50,s for red lake this week will make it happen. Anybode ever ice fish Gull Rock?TPC"

1759241,Guest,2013-05-09 07:46:00,0,Just wondering if the ice is out yet (or close) on Pakashkan - looks like it's supposed to be fairly nice (60's) all next week up there so that should help if it's not. Anyone know?
1762097,Davis Viehbeck,2013-05-10 04:42:00,48,"I would suspect Pakashkan will be out the week after the opener. Lakes are starting to get dark and some breaking away from shore. It will be a close call on the shallower lakes southwest and west of Thunder Bay (Whitefish Lake, etc.) I think anglers will be more or less limited to lakes with flow (current), or shallower, dark water lakes.

1763137,Guest,2013-05-10 10:21:00,0,Our group will be there May 20-24. So just hoping the ice is out several days before. Sounds like next weeks temps should make that happen. Thanks for the update.
