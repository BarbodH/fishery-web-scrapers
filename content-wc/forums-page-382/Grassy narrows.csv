Also any input about fishing that area for walleye and smallies with concern to the late ice out would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys."
1761329,mudpusher,2013-05-09 18:02:00,248,"Debbie at Grassy Narrows knows the lake well, if anyone can answer your questions, she can. Do you want her phone number? We will be going there June 8. Let me know how you did."
1761337,soill84,2013-05-09 18:06:00,5,"I got the number for the marina yesterday and haven't had a chance to call yet. Figured I'd check on here and see if anyone knew anything. I will let you know how it goes, hopefully the ice melts in time for us to test the water before you head up."
1761401,mudpusher,2013-05-09 18:29:00,248,Do you troll or jig ? How deep?
1761417,soill84,2013-05-09 18:32:00,5,"It's been about 7 years since I've been and in the past we jogged most of the time, but last year the guys had good luck trolling. Not sure what kind of depths they were in. I'm sure we'll do a little of both this year"

You'll have no worries about the ice being off. With the late ice out, the shallow bays will be the place to be......"
1765801,soill84,2013-05-11 10:39:00,5,"I figured that we might start with jerk baits in the shallows depending on the weather and then if that doesn't produce, maybe drop off a little deeper with tubes and jigs for smallies. Think that would be a good starting point? Like I said we usually go in July and I expect the pattern to be a little different going this early. Any other suggestions would be great."
1766441,JoeWho14,2013-05-11 15:32:00,20,I just got an e-mail from our lodge manager at Ball Lake today and he said that the ice just went out today!
1766457,soill84,2013-05-11 15:35:00,5,Good deal I'm pretty fired up. Can't wait to get on the water.
