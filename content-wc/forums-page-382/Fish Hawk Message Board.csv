I belong to some sites where the members make annual contributions to the administrator to keep the site going. If there is a money obstacle here to get the site up & running, maybe a solicitation of members would be helpful. With that said, I really don't have any idea as to what would be involved with ""recreating"" the site. Just sad how so much enjoyment has been taken away from so many and WHY!!!!"

1686473,Jig A Lowe,2013-04-18 06:21:00,87,I hope this question is not out of line on this site but does anyone know what happened to the Fish Hawk message board? I have been unable to access their site for the past couple of days.
1694353,Shellback,2013-04-20 05:32:00,8083,"Just checked, no luck here either."
1694641,Jig A Lowe,2013-04-20 07:02:00,87,"Yeah, wonder what's up with the site. I haven't been able to access all week. But, no one else seems to be chiming in?"
1695249,Andre (wallyandre),2013-04-20 09:58:00,2274,It's been a week now.Maybe they just pull the plug.

1714449,Jig A Lowe,2013-04-25 12:57:00,87,"Snowball -- wonder how we will know if & when the site is back up.? I'm thinking that my current bookmark will not work with the ""new"" site. Any thoughts?"
1720097,Snowball,2013-04-27 16:49:00,28,"I plan on monitoring their current link and also checking on Google. There is another site in Canada that has friends and miss Fish Hawk , I am sure they will be notifying their members upon Fish Hawks return. I will add a thread to Walleye Central , once I hear.

1720401,Moosebunk,2013-04-27 19:32:00,211,Hi guys.I have heard/read that F-H was hit hard by a virus. The Admin is rumored to be away (until the 28th) and will then have to rebuild. It could take time but I firmly believe it will get back online.Bunk
1750553,Shellback,2013-05-06 18:44:00,8083,He has a message up now regarding the problem. Doesn't sound good!
1751281,Moosebunk,2013-05-06 23:15:00,211,No... it certainly doesn't.
