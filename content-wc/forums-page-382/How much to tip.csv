1747889,Kwags,2013-05-06 05:16:00,48,"Guys, I have a different sort of question. Where we have been in the past, we went American plan and guides. Different guide each day. Tipped the guide at the end of the day and the staff at the end of the week. This time, the camp owner will be our guide for the week. Here's the question(s): do we tip the owner at the end of each day or at the end of the week? Alternately, does the camp owner expect to be tipped for guiding? We just want to do the right thing. Thanks"
1748129,MrSimon,2013-05-06 06:30:00,922,"If the camp owner is taking time to personally guide you .... and he does a good job ... you should definitely tip him. I don't think it really makes that big a difference when you tip him ...... but, if he gets 10 or 20 bucks at the end of the first day, he'll be pretty ""motivated"" to keep you on fish"
1716961,AllenW,2013-04-26 11:51:00,11482,"Sometimes.The only guide I ever used showed up 3 hours late, drunk and in a pi$$ poor mood, he than ate and drank what ever he could in the boat and was absolutely no help finding fish, we were back at the lodge by noon.No tip.Tips imho are for services done well, I'll go 10-20% usually if they deserve it.I am not obligated to tip, they are obligated to serve well if they want a tip.While not opposed to tipping, I do think it's gotten out of hand.Al"
1717097,MrSimon,2013-04-26 12:36:00,922,"Its a little off-topic, but this thread has got me thinking ..... what kind of trips are you guys going on where you have to tip so much money anyway? Don't you do anything for yourselves anymore? Some of you make it sound like there is a guy sitting in the boat waiting to wipe the sweat off your forehead with a towel. I am mostly kidding .... and everyone is more than welcome to take whatever kind of vacation they want .... but the self-sufficient do-it-yourself Canadian fishing adventure seems to be a dying breed."
1718401,stillangling,2013-04-26 21:00:00,149,Makes me wonder what kind of a resort that you went to. Any guide that treats guests like that deserves ZERO! Any resort that employs guides like that should be avoided. Please share the name of the place. That is what this forum is about! Tell people what to avoid and recommend the rights spots.
1718449,Guest,2013-04-26 21:38:00,0,"Thats good AllenW, I wouldn't tip the guy either. I've been to lots of places in Canada so I do have quite a bit experience tipping, I look at it this way. I'm safe with a guide, he knows where all the rocks are..I know people who didn't have a guide and hit rock after rock on their vacation, probably cost them a few bucks. I bet they went back complaining about their trip. And we always catch fish with a guide, I can tell who doesn't have a guide at the supper table they just listen with disgust at all the stories of big fish being caught except them. At shorelunch when it rains some guide are good enough to even bring a tarp for cover and builds a fire right away to warm us up. And most of all, when our kids are smiling and laughing in the boat enjoying themselves and especially when the guide make a genuine effort to help them and tell them stories. Now not all camps and lodges have these kind of guide I grant you that but the guide we have now is awesome and we have a great time with him every year and this year we are going to have three of us in the boat and I plan on tipping $800.00 cause I know we are going to have an awesome time, my nephew can't wait especially after all the stories and pics of big fish on our trips. I don't think there is anything worse then a quit guide or one who complains about the camp owner or always seems to be angry about something...it is your right to request a new guide if you want. We always request our guide when we leave a deposit for the next year also."
1718665,NathanH,2013-04-27 00:18:00,697,Yep because drunk driving is always a big joke. I do 10% assuming staff does their job. Also leave extra beer ect.
1719001,Dogbreath,2013-04-27 07:08:00,494,"I like the little sign on the dash of the Beaver that says ....""Tipping your pilot helps him remember where he left you""...."
1720481,Moosebunk,2013-04-27 19:59:00,211,"Lunker Larry in Lucky Boat #7's best tip in 20 years for a weeks guiding in the NWT was $10,000. You'd have to guess where. lol.Tipping is a personal thing really... although when in a group it's best to sort it out ahead of time."

1723434,John N,2013-04-29 05:12:00,362,"Our group's practice in Canada is this: Guide: The guide meets us at camp shortly after breakfast, on the water around 8:30 or so, and back at camp around 6 p.m. - the guide prepares a great shore lunch each day, always puts us on fish, cleans lunch fish daily as well as cleaning, wrapping and freezing those we take home at the end of the week, great guy, a real woodsman's woodsman. We tip $10 per man per day. This year, 8 guys, total of $80/day for each of the 5 days on the water. Camp staff: They take whatever we want (coolers, etc.) down to the boat each morning (except rods), meet us on the beach each evening to carry our stuff back to cabin, prepare and serve breakfast and dinner each day, prepare cabin for our arrival (it's very clean, bedding, towels, etc.), take care of the rest of the camp so it's ready for our enjoyment, etc. - we tip the camp staff $100/man/week - so in the above example, we'll tip the camp staff $800 for the week. Camp owner divides that up equally among all the camp staff. For years, we've had a wonderful time, thanks in very large part to being very well taken care of by these folks. The total tip of $150/man for the week is a bargain. John"
1723601,AllenW,2013-04-29 06:25:00,11482,"Was probably 25+years ago, soured me to the point of not hiring a guide after that.It was on Nippigon and the resort owner opologized.I doubt he's still guiding there.. Not the norm by any means, but it was meant more for an example than anything else.Poor service=no tipGood service=tipAl"
1624905,stillangling,2013-04-01 16:54:00,149,"I started a reply to the don't tip post and then deleted it. Waited a day and started again. If you rent a cabin, leave it cleaner than it was when you arrived and do not receive ANY services, you probably do not need to leave a tip. If you rely upon staff at the resort, you should be tipping. Guides in particular rely very heavily upon tips as a portion of their total annual income. No different than staff waiting on your table in a restaurant. It is just the way the business works. Many of the guides that you will encounter will be there year after year. They are not summer students. This is a career choice. A poor tip from the year before will result in you ""washing your lures"" for the week this year. The fish are not always biting but most of us will realize it when someone is putting in the extra effort."
1626514,MrSimon,2013-04-02 06:42:00,922,That seems reasonable.
1664825,emma17,2013-04-12 11:09:00,436,So how much should I tip the guide? Incentivize him on #'s and size?
1677505,alberta bum,2013-04-15 21:30:00,312,"I went to lady Evelyn lake last year. Couldn't hire the camp guide he was booked solid. He was walking by the cabin half hour after I got there. Asked him to join me for a beer, he sat down, I handed him a beer the lake map and $100. He marked out a bunch of things I wouldn't have noticed and told me exactly what wind directions and what he would use. He checked up on us the rest of the week,, we did very well as far as I was concerned. I tipped the dock guys 50 each(4 of them) and the 2 that went above an beyond got 100. Didn't tip cook,, we provided our own meals. So for our stay it was 20% of the bill got hand out. I also left what beer liquor I had leftover for the dock guys(keep this on the lowdown,, some owners don't like staff having a few beers in the evening)."
1678225,BornToFish,2013-04-16 07:13:00,1224,"There is a point about guides that may be worth mentioning. At many lodges, guests pay the lodge owner for the guiding service when they pay their bill at the end of the week. The lodge owner in turn compensates the guide for their day's work. The lodge owner often keeps a portion of the fee paid for the guiding service. This seems reasonable to me as it's the lodge owner's gas, boat and time coordinating guides etc. that are used to support the guides. The guides often do not earn what you pay for their service, but rather a portion of what you pay.The reason that I mention this is that many guides that I know rely upon their guiding fees as a principle source of their annual income. They have sixteen weeks to make most of their annual income. Thus, tips are important to them and their families.I haven't hired a fishing guide in Canada for quite some time as I am now pretty familiar with the lake that I fish. My tips back then were about 20% per cent of the fee that I paid to the lodge owner as the guides worked incredibly hard for me and my wife. We remain friends with many of them today as they are good people to be around.My tips are based on what the guide does that is ""above and beyond"" minimum service. I have had a few guides that provided minimum service (e.g. I fueled the boat in the morning and emptied it of empty bottles and cans). These guides didn't do well by me.At the end of your day being guided on the lake. ask yourself the question: were you glad to meet this guide and share a day in the boat with him/her? If so, bear in mind that his family is counting on you when you open your wallet. If so, recommend other anglers to your guide.Good fishing!!"
1680497,polaris-pete,2013-04-16 15:14:00,343,I agree also that remark was very rude and more inconsiderate.Most of these Lodge owners and employees go out of their way to make sure their Customers have a great trip. Help them out as their workdays are long and hard.
1693289,Guest,2013-04-19 17:45:00,0,"This is a question that has many answers, I can only tell of my experiences. We fish for 3 days with guide, tips vary for guide $300.00-$600.00, thats $150.00-$200.00 per day. After meeting our guide on the dock for the first time and before we leave the dock he asked a series of questions to guage our fishing ability which I thought was great. Very first spot we stopped at had some good fishing on it, I thought anyways but he thought we should move and I asked him why cause the fishing was good here. HE proceeded to tell me with the wind direction this morning another point just up the way would have fish all over it, I believed him..he sounded professional. We got to the next spot and he jumped in the front and threw out the anchor, he told me to jump in the back and cast to the shoreline and wham..every cast for about an hour an half. So suffice to say, we have no problem tipping our guide for last 3 years $600.00, he not only puts on big fish but he polite,respectful, takes good care of us, he even goes as far as pouring our coffee for us on the cold mornings, keeps us laughing in the boat, everything he does is to make sure we have a memorable time in his boat. I hope this helps a little, only my 2cents."
1697233,theeyeshaveit,2013-04-21 05:16:00,15,"Instead of giving just the tip, I offer the whole thing!"
1715873,Guest,2013-04-26 00:18:00,0,"NICE!! Classy and nice!! But seriously now. Our group has being going for years to the same outfit in Sioux Lookout. They treat us very very well, so we return year after year. Besides, the fishing is amazing! They fly us in and we cook for ourselves. No guide. We are ready know the lake. We always tip. We give the pilot $10 per guy in the group. There is 5 of us so we give him 50 bucks. We tip him when he fly's us in as it may be a different pilot who picks us up. If its the same pilot, he gets another $50. We give the dock hand at the air base a 50 also for helping load and unload the aircraft. He and pilot do all the loading at the airbase. The tell us to sit back and relax, your on vacation, we;ll take care of it! The pilots are fantastic. They run around at the outpost cabin, checking equipment, gas, LP etc before he heads back to the base. Years ago we tried a different outfit and the pilot never stepped foot off the dock. The cabin was a disaster. crapped out motors. Never returned. Went back to what we knew was real service. Dont be cheap! You tip our restaurant server, hotel maid, taxi driver, barber. ****, I tip the school kid standing outside during a cold winters day for fueling up the truck at the station, while I sit in the warm cab. Dont forget Cruise Lines and All Inclusive Resorts have tips added to their packages and you pay that. That package is about the same price as your fishing trip isn't it. Sure they get paid for their work, but its seasonal. When them lakes ice up, that pilot is not flying the seaplane any more and the dock hand waits out the winter till the start of the next fishing season. Unemployed! I was surprised how little the pilot makes. When I asked, he said he makes $3500 per month before tax. Working from May till end of September. Long hours too. He said there is little flying over the winter and departs back home. So we don't mind leaving a tip, but each to their own! It s your choice!"
1716873,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-04-26 11:26:00,358,I attempted to tip an OPP oficer after being pulled over for drunk driving and was arrested for attempted bribery.
1600465,5richards,2013-03-26 09:07:00,131,I tried to check for previous posts but was not successful -- probably my fault! I am curious about how much to tip the various workers that make your trip so successful! I'd hate to under-tip due to ignorance -- Pilot----maid --- dock hand--etc. I look forward to your responses!
1600537,WalleyeWally28,2013-03-26 09:19:00,298,Just bumped a previous thread on tipping.
1600577,Pooch,2013-03-26 09:23:00,4619,"Every person in any group I've ever been with places a different value on tipping. Figure it out ahead of time. Most folks working camps work hard and depend on gratuities for a decent wage. What would you feel was fair if you were doing their job?Having one guy of the group tip the pilot on a fly in avoids over or not tipping. ""I thought you did, no I thought it was your turn"" thing happens making the group as a whole look like schmucks. (Done that!) Same for two guys both tipping for the group and the pilot now really, really likes this group.Dock hands and camp workers should be tipped. Period. If you're not getting service (boats not fueled completely full or bait not available in the mornings) then I'd ask about it before not tipping.Our group now puts in $20 a person for each week we are in camp for the staff to split.When we used to do a lot of fly-in's we would tip $10 a person each way. Don't wait to tip the pilot until the trip out as you might have a different pilot. Tip each way when unloading.Just my thoughts. Until we hear of a better method.Pooch"
1600625,5richards,2013-03-26 09:35:00,131,Thanks Walleyewally -- I read the bumped posts -- no need for more info!
1600737,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-26 09:52:00,1460,Pooch nailed it right there!
1607113,octanehi5,2013-03-27 17:15:00,1104,"Your pilot should be $20 in and $20 out, Caretaker Treat him to dinner at your camp,drinks,cigar. We have out post camp the caretaker is only there twice a week,we fuel our own boats. more care deserves a bigger tip.The owner gets a good bottle of wine"
1616145,kayakmatt,2013-03-29 19:21:00,105,"I've been leaving about 10% (before taxes, for wife and I) with the camp owner at checkout on an American Plan boat-in resort (not my own boat). But...is it better to tip individuals personally and separately? The waitress, dock help, maid, shuttle boat driver?? I could see the latter being better, so they know where the tip money is coming from and some verbal appreciation. I have to assume the lodge owner forwards this money to the help? Problem is, I usually have simply made this tip by adding to the total bill with a personal check or credit card. If Canada is like the US, the owner may have to take out federal withholdings out of the tip money before paying the help!?Got me rethinking this whole process. I'll just have to bring alot more cash and divy up the approximately 10% of total bill among the the lodge employees based on some percieved value...and do it personally!! ...and maybe early in the trip??....like generously tipping the bartender on your first beer in hopes of getting even better service on the next 5 beers!"
1618225,bullhockey,2013-03-30 14:46:00,41,these people getpaid. don't tip anything.
1618249,Fisherman Ted,2013-03-30 14:52:00,461,"There is another good thread on this subject, but its actually easier if you do it at the end and all at once. Easier for you and the lodge. If you had to walk around finding everyone that would be a hassle. Plus if an employee is not working that day they would get left out. We pool all the tips and then push all tips out to everyone. Works very well. -FT"
1622625,MrSimon,2013-04-01 06:33:00,922,"Oh come on ... that's just rude. Even if its only a couple bucks, its an expression of your gratitude toward people working hard to serve you. Also, I've had times when I tipped fairly well and ended up getting a price break on the next year's trip that was MORE than the amount I tipped. Take care of the help and they'll take care of you."
