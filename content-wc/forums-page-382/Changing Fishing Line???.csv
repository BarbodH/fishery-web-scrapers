1736489,Blue Fin,2013-05-02 14:19:00,47,"I am thinking about switching up the line I have been using for Walleye Fishing. I typically jig and use live bait rigs with an 8 lb Mono. I am a little fed up with the memory and ""bird nests"" that I can get after a few days of fishing. Does anyone have a line that they swear by or would recommend?"
1736505,wallydave,2013-05-02 14:26:00,2151,"I have been switching to braid for jigging walleye the last several trips North.Spiderwire and Northlands braids to be exact! Both work well, I will be spooled up with both of these for this years trip too! The Northland walleye braid is nice for fishing stained lakes, there is a white section every 3-5 ft, easy to find the depth and easy to line watch with a stained water backdrop. I like both plus they help prevent pike bite offs while jigging for walleye.You will get plenty of responces, you might also try the search function, this topic comes up often.Try a couple different lines the one you like is all that matters! Good luck!"
1736609,adempsey,2013-05-02 15:03:00,963,"I've been using Power Pro braid.Just ordered some Sunline X1 braid to try out.The one thing I have read about jigging with certain types of braid is that sometimes the line can wrap around your tip. I think that has a lot to do with how you jig, so you may not have that issue at all. I have not. I think most problems were with the limper and rounder braids, like Sufix 832. Unfortunately it's expensive to try a bunch out."
1737217,fishguide1800,2013-05-02 18:28:00,84,Do you use s swivel .i use braid but i still use mono on a few of my reels and have no problems.basically use berkley.but i put a swivel on and have zero twist problems.
1737233,1jigfish2,2013-05-02 18:30:00,110,"When jig fishing, use a small swivel about 2 - 3 feet before your jig. It will take the twist out of your line when jigging. I run 8lb. Trilene XL on the reel up to the swivel. I then use a 6lb. XL leader to the jig. This stops twists and if you have to break off because of a snag, the swivel almost always stays on, along with some leader line. We have been doing this for years and the line never twists up. Everybody in our party soes this, it works great. We can run all week without any twisting. That is jigging about 10 hours a day for 7 days. I know some of our guys run the same line for a few years, but this one week is only fishing that they do. Tight lines to all."
1737673,ftfarms,2013-05-02 20:12:00,444,I use power pro also but still use mono on one jigging rod I just use reel magic helps with the line twists it great stuff.
1747121,Tinyfish,2013-05-05 19:00:00,16,I use Power Pro super slick. It's one of the slickest and roundest braids I've used. I also use a fluorocarbon leader on my jigging rod.
