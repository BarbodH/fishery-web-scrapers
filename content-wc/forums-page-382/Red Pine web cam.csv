It was actually moved between cabin 1 and 2 for a day, that was a pretty cool picture. Its good to see the dock again, it was covered in a lot of snow until the last few days. I'll be up there in a few weeks, I'll be sure to wave to everyone as I go by the camera!"
1757729,RapShad,2013-05-08 18:00:00,76,I've been monitoring this webcam for a week or so now. Is it me or do the water levels look really low? Is this normal until all the snow/ice melt? I've stayed at red pine for 14 years and only once or twice has that dock been sitting on the lake bed
1758889,IaDave,2013-05-09 06:03:00,476,I thought the same thing- I'm going to be up there the last week of May but at a different camp. It will be interesting to see what Abrams Chute looks like.
