Looking for insights from WC bass folks on preferred tactics and baits for early season, cold water smallmouth . . . . talking the 1st two weeks following ice out. I'm guessing cranks tossed to shoreline rocks, tube jigs, crawfish plastics???? Read somewhere that spinner baits aren't real effective until water temps reach mid-50s?Thanks for any suggestions and insights. Of course, if the lake trout fishing is what I anticipate, I may never get to the bass gear!"

1749689,GeoFish,2013-05-06 13:21:00,70,"The first two weeks following ice out they will be deep and schooled up.You won't catch anything throwing baits to the shore.Depending on the lake, 20 to 25 feet is my best guess.Be sure to take a good portable depth finder that will mark fish.One year at Big Canon lake, we were fishing early, first group in camp.We were the only ones with a depth finder and the only ones catching smallies.Fished on the steep drop line of reefs. Areas were the reef dropped from 10 foot quickly to 80 feet. They were around that 20 foot mark, schooled up and hungry.We were using Â¼ OZ. jigs, in white, since this lake is fairly clear, tipped with a minnow.GeoFish"
1751457,Davis Viehbeck,2013-05-07 05:18:00,48,"I'd have to disagree with the last post. Yes, you'll be able to find groups of smallies in deeper water, but you'll also find some fish that will gravitate towards shallow water within days of the ice going off lakes. We'll typically find smallies up tight very early on. Jerkbaits (fished slowly) such as X-Raps, Husky Jerks, Clackin' Minnows and tubes dragged on bottom will account for a fair share of your fish. If you mark fish deeper, hover over them and drop down a smelt imitator like a Trigger X Minnow or other fluke-style bait on a long-shanked jig head like a Slurp Jig and simply hold it just above the level you're marking the fish. Good luck!"
1754353,Terwalleye,2013-05-07 19:19:00,166,Just watched an Al Lidner show this AM on this very topic. They were chuckin X-raps right up to shore. Commented specfically on the ice being out and the water still near 40 degrees.
1754473,v-bay gord,2013-05-07 19:55:00,3168,"From my limited experience in fishing a lake that has primarily smallmouth during a pre-spawn condition (early, cold water) I would have to agree with Geofish. The fish we found were near the spawning areas but in deeper water....in this case maybe 15 feet. They were all bunched up there and we caught them on white tube jigs. I guess both scenarios (shallow and deep) are worth trying....."
1755961,Aaron-IN,2013-05-08 08:51:00,500,"Honstly it really depends on what happens with the weather right after ice out. If it's cloudy, rainy and cold for the first few weeks the bass will definately be schooled in deeper water 15-25 ft, sure there will be a few fish found in shallow water but most wont be there. Now, if right after ice out the weather is 75 and sunny every day the smallies will be going shallow for sure as the temps will quickly warm up in the bays and spawning areas. If water temps hit 50 they will be found shallow and it's on like Donkey Kong!"
