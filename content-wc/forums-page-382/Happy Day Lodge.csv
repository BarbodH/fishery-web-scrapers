Fished up there last year for first time, had a blast, great fishing and accommodations, but thats not the story. On last day, it was miserable, rain, cold, choppy lake, and we had to drive the loaded boats back from outpost. Anyways, one thing led to another with hurriedly trying to get everything packed, and ended up leaving my two spare trailer tires at boat launch area. Crap. After several emails trying to coordinate with them, we finally were able to hook up today on west side of Oakland county to get my tires back. They very well could have said sorry, they'll be here if you come up next year, as I was a first time customer. But they didn't, they went extra mile, and made me happy to have spares back instead of having to go out and spend $200-$300 on new ones.I will be back up there some time in near future for sure. Just a quick story on the quality of these guys if you are looking for a future trip, and oh, the fishing is great. Thanks again Bob and Sondra, good luck this year, and look forward to seeing you guys again.Doug"

They and their family work hard at providing their guests with top quality service and a very nice Canadian experience (and the fishing ain't bad either - ha) ! Doug, your post didn't surprise me at all, as I know these folks are very service minded and go out of their way for their guests (even the 1st year ones -ha). It's been a few years since I was last up at their Lodge, though I have many great memories of the trips to their camp. Rich B"
