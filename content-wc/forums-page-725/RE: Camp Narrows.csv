I started going for 2 weeks but now that I'm retired, I go for 5 weeks and I would go for the whole summer if I thought my wife would let me get away with it. I have definitely found my happy place. The camp is great---low keyed and run by great people who make you feel like you are one of the family. The fishing is excellent. I go for the month of August and the first week in Sept. I am mainly a smallmouth person---I just catch them and let them go. However, it is a great place for walleye and northerns. The walleye fishing has just been getting better and better since I've been going up there. In short it is the best fishing camp I've ever found and I would recommend it highly to anyone. Bob R."
