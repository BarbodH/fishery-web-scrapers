The samllies are awesome and there are tons of walleyes now, not like 10 years ago. This is one hot area. I usually stay at Camp Narrows when I go. It's a bit more expensive but the cabins are brand new, and it is a boat in. They pick me up at the landing when I don't bring my boat too."
553134,Guest,2005-11-20 19:37:00,0,"I am looking to do a trip to this area over the summer, wife, kids ,, you know the drill. How is the fishing this time of year.. walleyes? It seems I hit the mayfly hatch right on the head every time i went to Vermillion. I am looking for a place that the wife can tolerate, clean, modern, sand beach, activities for the kids, game room, trading post. Thanks"
553147,Guest,2005-11-22 09:35:00,0,"RangerRat, I've fished Kabby and Rainy several times. Mayfly hatches are to be expected, especially if you fish late June to late July. I prefer going to Minaki, much better fishing but somewhat limited for family activities. The Canadian side of Rainy has better walleye fishing in my opinion. However you'll need a remote crossing permit to come and go between Canada and the US, and live bait is not permitted. (We don't use live bait for our walleye anyway.) You can catch walleye on the US side of the lake, but we consistently caught more and bigger walleye on the Canadian side--too bad the limit and slot on the Canadian side is so restrictive. Kettle Falls on Rainy was pretty good, but it is quite a boat ride from Ash River, however the families that we saw there seemed to be having a good time (as best as I could tell). It is quite large and spread out--good hiking trails between the different parts of the resort. That part of the lake doesn't see as much pressure as the west end, and fishing seemed a little better. However, the rooms in the quad-plexes were kinda small, so don't know how the family would react to that. In addition, a lot of the rooms had bunk beds, which are ok for kids, but a pain for us older folks! Kabby has some very nice walleye fishing in June. Moosehorn Resort(?) is ok, but I didn't see a trading post there. However, there are some convience stores/gas stations not too far away that may help in those regards. Hospitality at that resort was pretty good and the owner was very friendly. ...just some thoughts, Chuck"
553149,Guest,2005-11-22 14:29:00,0,"--too bad the limit and slot on the Canadian side is so restrictive. To bad the limits are so restricted. The north arm of Rainy is now the success story of Ontario for walleye. We are rated #2 in our area for big walleyes by the MNR. We definitely are rivalling any lake north of us. Plus with the smelts coming in the northerns are averaging about 32"". We also have the biggest smallies in Ontario. I catch them right in front of my kitchen window. Look at the tourny weights. Who here has fished the north arm in the last 2 years. It's the big secret and they are just getting bigger with the slot's and the limit. IT was the dead sea 15 years ago and like I said it rivals any lake now. The slot and the limit were the best thing that could of happened to the lake. Now if only I could retire and fish more."
553150,Guest,2005-11-22 18:48:00,0,"I've exclusively fished the north arm of Rainy for two weeks over the past two years. [Stayed at the resorts on the north part of the arm.] I found that it is definately an excellent smallmouth fishery--given the number of smallies and size that we caught. The walleye and northern fishing is good in late-June, but in my opinion, not any better than the other Canadian portions of Rainy. You are right, there aren't many that know about the superb smallmouth fishing that is up on that part of Rainy. Chuck"
553155,Guest,2005-11-23 15:57:00,0,"--too bad the limit and slot on the Canadian side is so restrictive. Huh? That is exactly why fishing has improved so dramatically in this area. Restrictive slots & limits are here to stay & I say ""it's about time!"" I go for the overall experience wherever I'm fishing, not just for what I can keep. Upper Red Lake is a prime example of what can happen when a fishery is given the protection it needs in order to recover. I'm from Canada and look forward to hearing good reports coming from Upper Red Lake when the walleye season officially opens. I like hearing ""good news"" fishing stories regardless of which side of the border it's on."
553156,dutchboy,2005-11-23 16:38:00,5717,When Upper Red opens the poaching will be like nothing ever seen before.
553168,River_eye,2005-11-25 17:17:00,1486,"umm, is that a joke????? You would like unrestrictive slots on the canadian side, so the fishing gets as poor as on the american side? Seriously, you had to have been joking with that comment."

553204,Guest,2005-12-01 06:52:00,0,"The following are two resorts that interested me when I considered a fishing trip to Rainy Lake. I haven't been to either and don't know if they offer all of the amenities that you want. They are drive to, so you all could drive to Fort Frances if it is raining or if tired of fishing.www.thefisheries.comwww.coppensresort.com In addition to Walleye, Rainy Lake offers Smallmouth, Northerns, Musky and Crappies. The Crappies tend to be on the large side. If you hit the lake when they are biting, it would be a definite plus. Good luck on your vacation"
