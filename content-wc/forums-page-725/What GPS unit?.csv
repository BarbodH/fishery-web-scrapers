553187,clemento,2005-11-29 08:25:00,48,I am looking for a GPS unit to mark fishing holes at a remote outpost lake in NW Ontario. Any suggestions? I don't need fancy features just reliability.

553197,clemento,2005-11-30 08:26:00,48,All I want to be able to do is accurately mark a spot. If I find a reef in open water I want to be able to go right back there next year without searching for it. I want ACCURACY at the cheapest price.
553198,Guest,2005-11-30 09:29:00,0,"E-Trex on sale at BPS for $90.00 this week. I have many hand held units. The one I use most is the cheapest. E-Trex. I also have the Lowrance I-Finder with mapping capability, really cool unit with neat features. The lowrance cost about $200.00. The mapping chips run about $150.00-$200.00 each. I don't know that remote Canadian lakes are available on the mapping chips?"
553199,clemento,2005-11-30 10:08:00,48,Is BPS Bass Pro Shops? I went to their website and could not find any for $90
553202,Guest,2005-11-30 19:49:00,0,www.reedssports.com I see they had some pretty good specials on Lowrance handhelds.
553205,Guest,2005-12-01 10:38:00,0,"Lowrance H20 GPS at www.jollyannsales.com is about $169 right now w/free shipping. Wade is a visitor at the board to help quite a bit. It comes with a cigarette adaptor, mapping ability, runs 12 hours on AA batteries and oh yeah - waterproof!"

553227,Guest,2005-12-05 10:38:00,0,Sorry for not checking back sooner. Yes BPS is Bass Pro Shop. I just this past weekend purchased an E-Trex for $84.99. It will be a christmas gift to a good buddy with a bad sense of direction. He was lost for three hours a few weeks ago after gutting his buck he stood up and walked (dragged) in the wrong direction. The funny thing is that he has hunted this area for almost 40 years. I imagine some of the trees looked familar. LOL The people at BPS also told me that the lowrwance I-Finder has been marked down $50.00 to about $150.00 now. That is the regular price. Good luck.
