I recieved a e mail from my ""regular"" Totem guide who said that since early June guides have been quitting & or been fired. From what I know, some of these guides were some of the best @ Totem. Yes, my regualr guide was one who was ""terminated"". Made my re-booking real easy, I won't be back."
552479,Guest,2005-10-03 20:58:00,0,"Yes I heard they lost a few guides who had a problem for showing up for work and the managment has takin a hard line on that, a give everybody a couple chances and if it happen more then that , see ya.Lots of other places you can fish in the Sioux Narrows area who have good guides to."
552646,Wonderer,2005-10-14 06:32:00,10,"As far as I am concerned when it comes to guides. Guides are guides. I know guides out of two other resorts on Lake of the Woods, that put any guide at Totem to shame. More professional and certainly better knowledge and these two resorts are not located too far away from Totem either. One is very close, the other on the Western Peninsula. They have Totem beat hands down in the guide dept. and even as I see it facilities. The only thing Totem is, is bigger. Nothing more. And bigger folks does not necessarily mean better."
552647,Wonderer,2005-10-14 06:54:00,10,"I understand that guides have either been fired or been quitting. I am not sure of what the reason is. One worker at wiley that I know will not comment on it, but told me there was something mentioned on this board and I cannot find it any longer. However. In a few min. I will post how ""I"" rate some of the resorts in the Totem, Wiley areas. As I say, Bigger, is NOT necessarily better. If you are a guest at any resort and the bill is being paid by your company, who cares. However, if you are paying for the trip yourself, than I strongly suggest shopping around for a lower prices, no air conditioning, (not needed anyway) and other goodies that the bigger places offer. They all ""nearly"" fish the same waters anyway it just depends on yourself if you want to use the Totem/Wiley banner and the bigger buck to have that privilage to fish LOTW.."
552676,Guest,2005-10-16 20:38:00,0,"not hard to tell you are a resort owner from nearby ,,, i bet you have never even taken a totem guide,, so you really don't know,,,,,, dale jr. hard to compare just by word of mouth ,,, people do lie,,,"
553006,Wonderer,2005-11-08 23:46:00,10,"Wrong. Worked at Totem sometime ago and I do not own a resort either. Just a lowly guide myself. Only now private. Best few guides I ever met, were. Bob Monet, and Dean Howard. Bob is deceased, but I believe Dean is down around Emo. Not many could beat those two guides no matter what resort they came from."
553038,Guest,2005-11-10 13:19:00,0,"Have you ever fished with Barney Vanderheyden? He is without a doubt the greatest Guide ever. We always called him ""Bigfish Barney"" he would not only put you on lots of fish but lots of BIG fish!!!!"
553055,Guest,2005-11-11 21:16:00,0,"I have been at Totem and Wiley the past 6 years, and they have had the best guides in my 20 years in Ontario. I appreciate how tough they are on their guides, as we pay a high price for great service. Byron, Bortko, Dean , Mike and the #1 guide in Ontario is Shawn have been incredible. They do need to raise the daily pay for the guides, as they make lower than the norm, probably because of the clientel they receive. They probably think that they will tip more because of the number of corporate groups. I know about service as I am with Hyatt hotels, and these guys are on the top of the list with service."
553057,Guest,2005-11-12 22:11:00,0,You mean that Sauger King Corky isn't the best guide @ Totem ?
553085,Guest,2005-11-15 12:08:00,0,"hey, Blake thanks for the good words. I loved fishing with you guys. I wish sometimes the guides had a choose of guests. You, Cliffy and Kev would be 1st.Congrats on the big Muskie this year. Just went down to Lake St. Clair this past weekend and caught 9 with a 48"" the biggest.Have agood one"
