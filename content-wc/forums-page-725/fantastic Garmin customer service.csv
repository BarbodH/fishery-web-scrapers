I called spoke to them in person & through emails several times about purchasing software and deciding which to purchase and they were great!!! I also sent them another email after purchasing the software and in 2 days(counting the day I spoke to them)I received a message from my local postmaster telling me I had a package from Garmin. In this day/age customer service has gone but not with Garmin, thanks again."
