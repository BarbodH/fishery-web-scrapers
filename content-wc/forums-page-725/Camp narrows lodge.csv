553240,Guest,2005-12-07 19:23:00,0,"Eh, I've been to Camp Narrows nearly every year (sometimes twice a year) since early/mid 90's. In this time, Narrows has improved dramatically with regard to the camp. What was once a run-down camp has now turned into a very comfortable and modern Canadian fishing lodge. Tom, the lodge operator, and his Dad have completely rebuilt his camp and has done an outstanding job. Furthermore, he has upgraded all his equipment (in the event you would want to rent your boat). Camp Narrows is truly a quality camp. As for the fishing...well, it's as good as it gets. I've fished Rainy Lake for 15 years. It was outstanding back then and it is even better now. In fact it is significantly better now. I've done lots of fly-ins all over Canada to remote lakes. Yeah, the fishing was good, but not as good as Rainy. You will NOT find fatter fish anywhere - I guarantee. At Narrows, you have endless access to some excellent fishing waters and Tom is always glad to point you in the right direction. Truthfully, I'm not into Walleye so much. I'm more a Smallmouth/Pike guy but don't mind going for the Eyes once in awhile. In fact, I trolled up a 12 pounder last July. That was just 20 minutes after I trolled up a 10 pounder. No, that's not the norm (nor is it in any lake), but I can assure you any walleye you catch in Rainy will be fatter than any walleye in any other lake. The smallmouth fishing is also incredible and you can not help to catch the Northerns. Just listen to Tom's advice. He knows the lake and he will tie you into some fish. My recommendation: GO FOR IT!"
553241,Guest,2005-12-07 22:05:00,0,"Just curious what time of the summer you've been going to Camp Narrows. I agree, the North Arm of Rainy is an excellent smallmouth fishery, and walleye has made a dramatic comeback! Chuck"
553243,Guest,2005-12-08 01:44:00,0,"flathead, if your looking at fishing Rainy -any part of Rainy- try Tom at Camp narrows,it's a great place.My first trip to the narrows was 4 yrs. ago and after years of fishing many Canadian lodges I knew I found ""my place.""The owner Tom and his staff instantly made me feel at home.Very nice modern cabins just a step off the water,unbeatable view,good people,great food and reliable equipment.I tow my own boat almost 1000 miles to fish hard and since finding Tom's lodge I dont have to drag extra batteries along,I get as good of charge as at home.The fishing is awesome,most people there are bass fishing but I'm an eye guy and Rainy has the most beutifull walleyes I've ever fished,my first trip I caught the biggest eye I've ever held,a 9.5lb 28""pig, then a 27"",a few 4-6lb and a31.5 inch monster,my biggest to date.The walleyes can be finicky at times but thats when I fish bass.lot's of quallity fish 3-4.5lbs.+ a 21""smallmouth.theres always something biting at the narrows,even the odd crappie, I've never been there in the fall when the crappie bite was on but I did snag a heafty 16.5""slab 2yrs ago.maybe next year I'll book a fall deer\fishing trip.Anyway check out Tom's place at www.campnarrows.ca,you won't be dissapointed."

We consistently catch walleyes close to the camp and last year we got into lots of big smallies the first week in August. I've even brought my fianc√© there who doesn't fish 3 times and she loves it. Now I have to take two trips a year, one with the boys and one with her and the dog. It's a cool place."
553245,Guest,2005-12-08 09:22:00,0,I've been going to Camp Narrows for 20 years now. The camp is in an excellent location with great fishing all around you. The walleye fishing has become better and better since they started the slot limits a few years back. Tom and Eric will make you feel at home and point you to some great spots on the lake. Book ahead to make sure you get the week you want!
553247,Guest,2005-12-08 16:54:00,0,"Hey Chuck, I've gone to Narrows all times of the summer. From Early June all the way through late August. I seemed to have settled on early/mid July the last five or more years though. Seems the biggest Smallies I've caught came in mid/late August. Don't know if that agrees with what all the experts say but it has been my experience. The past few years it seems the Smally bite did not start until later (mid-July). High water and unusually cold temperatures have kind of squelched the Smally bite during the first half of the season in the recent couple years but I have also done very well at those times in years past. When do you go to Narrows? ED"
553249,Guest,2005-12-08 22:06:00,0,"We went in mid-June last year, and hit a period of relatively stable weather -- nice smallies, plenty of big huge females! The next to the last day the weather turned really bad and temps dropped like a rock as severe storms rolled thru. Needless to say the smallie action abruptly stopped. Chuck"
