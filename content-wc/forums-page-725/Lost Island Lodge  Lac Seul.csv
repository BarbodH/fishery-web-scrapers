553209,Guest,2005-12-01 19:39:00,0,The best thing you can do is look through the archives. There is tons of talk on this lodge and many others. Spend 20-30 minutes skimming the archives and you will get more feedback than you ever needed. NWO Fishing Bum

553213,Guest,2005-12-02 09:14:00,0,"Been to Lost Island three times. Twice in the middle of June and once the first week of July. Fishing was excellent all three times. We always use their Guides for a couple of the days we are there and have found that the Guides do a super job of putting you on fish and they are very friendly. The cabins and boats are also very nice and the owners are very accomadating and friendly. You should have a great time if you can get in. If you want to go i would get a reservation in soon. Good Luck, Colt"

553222,Guest,2005-12-03 17:39:00,0,Plenty of fish close to camp in June. We did run north a couple of times but not as far as Chamberlin.

Be a good idea to get a guide early on in the trip, will show you locations and techniques. A lot of people travel all over from the Lodge, but it isn't necessary. It's fun, great boating, but there is great fishing very near the camp. Good Luck"
