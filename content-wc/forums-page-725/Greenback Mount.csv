553165,Guest,2005-11-25 09:47:00,0,"Look up Starodub in Winnipeg on Google. He's the best I think. Another tip, order the biggest fish he has and then get a tag made for yours. Keep adding tags or redoing if you'ld like then. Personally, I've found replica's tend to run smaller than reproductions, be careful of that. In other words, your 12 lb looks like a 10"

553169,Guest,2005-11-25 19:20:00,0,"Thanx guys. I checked out a fish posted by Backwater Eddy on a Starodub mount, and it was definitely a fine quality mount. I don't quite get the tag thing that you were referring to. I'd like to post a pic of the greenback I caught but am unsure how. It was a 13.3 pound fish though."
