Yes....I know for a fact that if a person does not mess around, when the walleye bite is on, you can catch a lot of walleyes in a very short time. There is a spot on the Peribonka river in Quebec where I often catch quite a few walleye just as the sun sets. I get about 20 minutes of furious activity. I keep my limit of 6 ""eaters"" and let the rest go. All are caught in about 4 feet of water with jigs lobbed out about 15 feet from my canoe. This isn't the time to get tangles, eat a sandwich, drink a beer or lose a jig, you lose precious time....lol."
552796,Guest,2005-10-25 23:19:00,0,"Just got back from Pinefalls/Red River... Sick of everyone saying that PineFalls isnt hitting right now. We've caught more fish this year than any other year. We averaged 50+ fish a day and boated over 14 over 9lbs. Spent one day at the Red and had 4 over 10 in less than 2 hours of fishing. Seems like every year we are ready to go up, there are no posts on how good things are, or someone comes on here and says its hitting and some one jumps all over them. It sure seems to me that ""people"" are purposely trying to keep us away. It would be nice if only one year people could be honest about what is going on. Or if some one does say they are catching fish they won't let you know what there doing. So here is what works for us this year. Trolled Plugs in 10-13 feat South of Robinson Rock w/ Anything with Pearl on it. Jigged Traverse bay on the drop offs around 15 feet with 5/8 pink jigs with flashers and stingers. On the Red fished 14 feet N of Sugar Island on the Float Plane basin with the same jig. We caught more fish this year than any other, and we didn't think it would be that good this year. So hears a little heads up for any one going up. It's really hot right now and big fish are being caught daily by about every boat. If I can help with any other q's just ask."

552805,Guest,2005-10-26 12:17:00,0,"Wow sounds like you had a great trip, my group just got back on the 20th didn't do real well on the Red biggest being a 28"" not alot of action fished primarily on the Miracle Mile, saw a few fish caught that were masters the lastest being an 11lb. Maybe I missed this but did the wind direction make any difference for you on the Red? Did you Jig or Troll. The Traverse Bay area was way more productive for our group with 75+ fish days, biggest fish for my group was a 29"" caught jigging, couldn't get the fish going trolling. Were you trolling shads raps ? What speeds? Are you a member of the group up from Sioux Co IA?"

552866,Guest,2005-10-27 21:06:00,0,THE WIND DIRECTION DID SEEM TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. ON THE DAYSWITH THE NORTH WIND WE SEEMED TO BE BETTER BUT WHO KNOWS IF THAT IS THE REAL REASON FOR SUCCESS OR FAILURE. WE WERE TROLLING SHAD RAPS...MOSTLY #7'S BUT SOME # 8'S IF NECESSARY. SEEMS LIKE WE HAD THE MOST LUCK TROLLING AT ABOUT 1.5 MPH WITH RAPS HAVING PEARL ON THEM BEING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. AT TIMES IT SEEMED TO BE SLOW BUT IF YOU STICK IT OUT IT SHOULD PRODUCE.
553093,buck-eye hunter,2005-11-15 18:24:00,5,"Well Wally I guess the truth to the matter is its not that simple because we had an excellent year by our standards on the Red but as I was loading the boat on the trailer the last day at Selkirk we talked to veterans and most were very disappointed.Our overall group from Sioux City,Ia did not do as good as normal but a pair of boats the week before ours (9/30-10/5)did very well with numerous fish between 8 and 12 lbs.the other boat sucked. The next week our boat landed 6 10 + fish(everyone got at least one) but no one else caught any over six(three boats). My best friend had the 45 mins. to die on a 10lb 6oz,9-12,9-8,8-12,8-8,8-6,7-12,7-8 and 6-8.There wasn't one dink between,all were green and not one other guy in the boat caught anything while he was dragging them in.We had a 100+ day the first day mainly on sauger but we figured it was good practice and it paid off. After three years going north and watching postings on WC it appears that the greenies are like the grey ghosts of the woods where you never know where or when all you can do is fight it out and hope your paying attention when the big one bites."

553189,Burr,2005-11-29 09:12:00,8612,">What is ""winnipeg/red"" ? Winnpeg/red are 2 rivers in Manitoba that flow into the south end of Lake Winnipeg. You will also hear the Red referred to as Selkirk. Red (Selkirk) is just 20 miles or so north of Winnipeg, Mb. The Winnigpeg River is also referred to as Pine Falls, Traverse Bay, and Papertown. Pine Falls is 80-90 miles north and east of Winnipeg, Mb. >What are ""greenies"" ? Greenies - well, that's kind of a different term, referring to Greenbacks. The Walleye from this area are nicknamed Greenbacks due to the irredescant (sp) green coloring on the backs of the walleye that is unique to these waters. It is a real pretty Green. Here is a link to my photo's that show a few greenbacks. Canadians commonly call Walleyes ""Pickerel"". https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...php?photo=2534 >What does this mean ; ""My best friend had the 45 mins. to die >on a 10lb 6oz,9-12,9-8,8-12,8-8,8-6,7-12,7-8 and 6-8."" It means he caught a bunch of nice fish in 45 minutes!"
553190,Guest,2005-11-29 11:05:00,0,They must not fight to hard to get them all in in 45 min. Or was it a bit of an exaggeration. i have never been there.
553191,Burr,2005-11-29 11:48:00,8612,"I don't know Phern, but catching that many fish in 45 minutes is very believable. The water is shallow, and if your anchored on the right place when they come through a bunch can be caught real quickly. Seems like when you catch one big one, there is a good chance of catching more of similar size at the same time - similar size fish running in schools. Might be harder pulling cranks, but when verticle jigging, it can happen fast."
