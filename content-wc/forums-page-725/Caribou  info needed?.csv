I have a few friends that have done caribou hunts and it sounds like a high % hunt as far as quantity of animals and shooting situations goes. Caribou hunts also seem the most cost effective to do as I will have a bill for 2 to carry. I am interested in hearing from any of you that have done Caribou hunts and have recommendations for area's or better yet outfitter to check out. I am not hung up on trophy class animals, average animals with the chance of seeing above average bulls is fine. I am more interested on high numbers and a comfortable camp that is ""youth friendly"" and not to rough. Hunting situations and terrain should be beginner - intermediate level. I want this hunt to be FUN for her. She does handle her guns fine and does ok on game. Any suggestions would be appreciated..Thank you for your time, RJ in Montana..."

Beware, some outfitters have folded and didn't tell their clients. Supposedly Kanguk outfitters closed and kept the money. Fortunatley another outfit covered them. I think you might want to post this on the huning forum. Good luck - Stu"
