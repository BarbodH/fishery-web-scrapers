553175,Hump,2005-11-27 09:49:00,578,Just got our confirmation and reservation information. our camp remained the same.
553177,Guest,2005-11-27 19:06:00,0,"ALL RIGHT, WHERE IS THE GUY WHO PREDICTED 30% INCREASES. I REMEMBER HE WAS GOING TO DO A IN DEPTH SURVEY AND HIS RESULTS WOULD VALIDATE HIS PREDICTION......HOGWASH."
553178,phishfearme,2005-11-27 21:06:00,1242,he replied but his response was nuked. note the number of responses stated for this thread versus the actual number listed - phish
553179,Guest,2005-11-28 04:21:00,0,Like I said all data and the new 2006 pricing for the vast majority of camps are net yet announced. Be patient.
553184,Guest,2005-11-28 16:34:00,0,"Patience is a virtue, a 30% increase will never happen. Been doing this for 40 years and have never seen or will never see that kind of increase. It defies good business sense for any business to raise prices 30% and maintain that increase and survive. Im expecting a 5% to 10% increase on operating my business and it of course will be passed on to the consumer. Hopefully the fish will be 5% to 10% bigger next year too."
553215,Guest,2005-12-02 15:01:00,0,just got my reservation form. prices stayed the same. looks like they cut the gas allowance by 5 liters per day. probably amounts to a 3% increase or there abouts. hardly kept up with inflation.
553129,phishfearme,2005-11-19 16:36:00,1242,"there was a lengthly tread some time ago about how much will the increase be for 2006. well, i just got the new rates from the outfitter we're using next year (northern outposts out of armstrong) the the weekly rate for a fly-in housekeeping trip is going up 15% - from $995 to $1145USD. the outfitter blamed the increse on fuel and exchange rate changes. with PST/GST the total is $1214 and when you add travel costs, you easily at $200 per day. i know someone predicted 30% on average. what are others experiencing? phish"
553130,Catman59,2005-11-19 21:05:00,345,"I just got mine too. The Family Plan went up 11%. That is for 2 adults and 2 children. The cost for an extra person went up $5. I would consider this a very minimal increase and I was expecting it to be higher. I originally chose this camp for its family atmosphere as well as the price. The fishing is excellant , the location is fantastic and the camp owners are the best......Only 243 days to wait !!!!!!!!"
553131,bigfish1965,2005-11-20 00:38:00,3210,The exchange may be the biggest factor now since fuel prices are expected to fall right into the new year. Hoping the US Dollar makes a comeback soon!
553132,Pooch,2005-11-20 09:25:00,4619,One camp we go to did not raise for 2006. Although we have to pay for our own flight in and out of that one. I can't imagine that the ride in won't get bumped a little for '06. This camp took about an $10 per day increase last year. Have not heard from the other camp which includes the flight. It also took about a $10 per day increase last year. Both of these camps were just over $600 when we started going to them about six years ago. Now (2005) both are chasing $900 for six and seven days respectively. Pooch
553133,Catman59,2005-11-20 12:08:00,345,This is the first price increase for us in the 5 years we have been going.I have seen camp improvements every year. Even though its our vacation.....you still have to remember that its their livelyhood.
553138,jerry bark,2005-11-21 09:25:00,822,"no increase in cabins for this year where i go, i would expect some increase in bait/ice/fuel/goodies at camp but that's OK. i know the owners are not getting rich on me and i can still afford a full week at about $650 for everything from my door to camp and back. Oh, and for those who say shop in canada: i do buy most everything in canada, and from the camp when i can, except the gear which i already own and some basic food items. have a good holiday, jerry"
553139,Guest,2005-11-21 09:32:00,0,"Our fly-in outpost 110 air miles out of Red Lake went up 5%. Deposits increased to $300 from $200 and the overweight (150 lbs. allowed/person)charge will be $0.75/lb. instead of $0.50. In speaking about the increase with the owner, he mentioned the exchange rate and the price of gasoline were the main reasons."
553141,Guest,2005-11-21 17:34:00,0,tall pines price is the same for next year if you get your 100.00 $$$ deposit in by jan 1st wayne
553145,Crede,2005-11-22 08:32:00,134,Fly in lodge out of Nakina up 8% over 2005. Have had similar % increases the past several years.
553173,Guest,2005-11-26 16:46:00,0,Ours went up 6% unless you get your deposit in by Jan 1st. If you do you get last years rate on Cabin and Boat. Expect bait to go up.....still great fishing....great price....great Canada.
