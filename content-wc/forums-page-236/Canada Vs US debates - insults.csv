4738754,LOW1,2016-04-15 08:28:00,2828,"You have to love it when even the Wall Street Journal can't help but subtly insult Canadians, especially when hockey is involved:. . . A survey released in 2013 by Hockey Canada and equipment-maker Bauer Hockey Inc., reported that 90% of Canadian children weren't playing hockey. The findings set off a round of hand-wringing across Canada, which might be the country's second favorite pastime, after playing the sport itself.. . .http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-amer...ion-1460584181"

4743594,P&y only,2016-04-17 06:10:00,133,"I've read a few posts about Canadians being pissed at Americans for leaving trash behind or in the lakes. Or being rude to locals. I would like to apologize, on behalf of Americans who DON'T do this crap, for the actions of the idiots who do. I for one truly appreciate the opportunity to come to your country and spend some time relaxing in the wild north. I'm cool with your tight fish limits. I'm happy to buy local when I can. And I hope that we aren't all judged by the actions of the few that don't respect your rules. What country you live in doesn't mean **** to me. I'd hop right in the boat with ya and go fishin. Cause it's fishin. So, sorry for the idiots and thanks for the opportunity! Fish On!"
4744242,HeHooksHimself,2016-04-17 11:40:00,725,Is P & y really the president? Once again apologizing for Americans and pretending he is above the fray? Suspicious...

4746242,Kartman35,2016-04-18 08:21:00,245,"It isn't an American/Canadian thing...It's all a-boot percentages. In any population there's a percentage that are awesome, most are cool, and the rest are morons. If I'm Canadian for example and I see an American acting like the third category, and I come to the conclusion that because of this all Americans are morons, I think that makes me a bigger moron than the original American moron (whether he was in fact a moron or not). There are some tourists, Canadians, and natives that leave garbage everywhere, take dumps on footpaths near scenic waterfalls and just leave it there. Most people pack out their garbage and are conscientious when in the wilderness. Better just to recognize that it's not about where you're from, it's how you act as an individual that counts. So come, visit, fish knowing securely that anyone who judges you on the basis that you are an American, because of behavior he may have seen other Americans engage in, is just a moron. Yup, there's a not so insignificant percentage of those up here too. Happy fishing"

4736146,youngknight,2016-04-14 11:06:00,228,"Thankfully, it doesn't happen often but occasionally I have read on this board Canadians making unfair judgements against our neighbours to the US including those that come up here to fish (yep, I'm Canadian)...and vice versa as well. So, came across this youtube video...and in the name of international relations....have a cold one and a look!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2E064kb3UnU"

4736754,MassillonBuckeye,2016-04-14 14:40:00,661,We're closing the beer gap BTW.. Especially here in Central Ohio. Local breweries popping up everywhere. And no one is making watered down lagers or pilsners really.
