4792762,muskyroller,2016-05-01 17:24:00,56,Good luck getting in there this late. Repeat business for Blair and Kathy is VERY good. We had to push our trip back a week this year and it was a struggle to accomodate our group of 9. We'll be there the last week of June. Can't wait!
4777410,JDP,2016-04-26 21:12:00,1457,"ProV1800,Careful with nuts...From Fishernman's Cove I went as far as Aldous Bay, about 32 miles.I did not do that every day.I mostly fished Bay of Islands,Manitoba Point, Windigo Point, McKenzie Bay, South Bay, Altimeter Creek, Broad lake, Sunlight Lake.The other spots (Bray Lake, Bear Narrows, Chamberlain Narrows, etc.)I have fished from Mahkwa Lodge.They were too far to travel to from Fisherman's Cove,that is why I moved to Mahkwa Lodge."
4777458,prov1800,2016-04-26 21:17:00,5010,Still one heck of a trip to chamberlain.have been there from deception.
4777650,pjshorthorn,2016-04-27 04:38:00,5654,"With a decent size motor and knowing what you are doing, it is about 1 hr to 1:15 . Nice ride. PjShorthorn."
4777698,prov1800,2016-04-27 05:05:00,5010,Yes it is and some nice fish up that way.
4777722,pjshorthorn,2016-04-27 05:16:00,5654,"I agree. Caught many 26""-28"" walleye in the Kekabeka Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows areas. For my money, I fish Kekabeka Narrows heavier than any other location up that way. Also have caught 40"" class snakes in Kekabeka. I'm amazed at how lightly Kekabeka is fished. Most days we are the only boats...... for the entire week.PjShorthorn."
4777746,prov1800,2016-04-27 05:26:00,5010,"Well it is a long run and there are hardly any camps up there on lac seul..lac suel outpost anda few houseboats, andersons lodge brings there guests up there and leavecfrom pelicon falls and a few moose horn lodge boatd.and they dont go wuit that far.diffently not as crowded as brood lake.lol.anybody else that fishes the lake hascto trailer and put in at deception bay landing.sen bay also is good."
4778034,SinOrSwim,2016-04-27 06:56:00,1528,"You can't go wrong with Onaway when it comes to facilities. By far the nicest cabins and their fish cleaning facility is pretty much perfect. The owners, another question. We have a split group. Some like them and others do not. We had never had good communication even when booking in previous years. Sometimes it would take a week or two before a response. Obviously some of that is a personal preference as there are some in our group who chatted with them daily and others that barely said a word. Not trying to throw anyone under the bus. Just trying to put out a different perspective to give an honest accounting to others looking for places to go. Our group is not going back after about 5 or more years there. But, it wasnt' an easy decision. The camp and area is really really nice."
4778354,vaquero01,2016-04-27 08:02:00,101,"Great cabins, good boats, pretty reasonable prices when you factor in 30 gallons of gas free, even if you bring your own boat, and the couple dozen minnow per person free per day. This will be our fourth year there (me, wife, lab, boat). We think Blair and Kathy are fine hosts. No issues with communications. We will be going back for as long as we are able."
4780698,bigtimeelectric,2016-04-27 19:17:00,174,"If you are bringing your own boat my vote is Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge. South of Ear Falls 5 miles small camp, only 3 big cabins. Great owners and top notch facilities. pm me for any more details."
4792674,LoDo,2016-05-01 17:11:00,721,"The consensus seems to be Onaway. I've stayed at Onaway years ago. Ive stayed Lac Seul lodge and Fishermans too. I prefer south of Ear Falls where these three lodges are located. I honestly think the boat ride to McKenzie Bay, Manitoba Pt and everything between those two locations is phenomenal fishing. I'm hoping to book Onaway this June."
4756898,Baseline,2016-04-20 19:39:00,3207,"If you would like to try another area further west of Lac Suel Separation Lake Lodge on the English River. Lots of water to fish, but none of the big water to deal with when the wind kicks up. I fished Lac Suel at least once of year for many years until will tired this area. It is now a once or twice a year stop. I've been to Caribou....What a great place to camp and fish."
4757386,teddi,2016-04-21 03:39:00,349,"I would try Golden Eagle Resort right next door to Evergreen. Cleaner cabins,better boats,lower rates and nice hosts."
4758570,prov1800,2016-04-21 09:18:00,5010,"Have never stayed at golden eagle but have boated past it when i guide out of evergreen lodge a fewctimes a year for pat.so really dont know anything about the cabins, rates or host.but evergreens boats are new 1800 crestliners with 60 tamahas on them and areca real nice boat in my book.just wondering what kind of boats golden eagle has if you say there better."
4759378,teddi,2016-04-21 12:17:00,349,"Golden eagle has new oners and they have done a lot of work to the place. I hear they are getting new boats this year but don,t know what kind. Evergreen,s boats are getting up there in years but they are in good shape."
4764730,WalleyeWally28,2016-04-23 06:23:00,298,"Whitewing, about 5 miles south of Ear Falls has very nice well maintained cabins including a couple that hold 8 or 10 people. We've stayed there 23 weeks in the last 13 years and have 3 more trips booked for this summer. If you want more adventure you might want to check out Whitewing's houseboats. They have two large really nice ones that hold up to 12 people. They park them where Altimeter and Manitou Creeks enter LS which is right in the middle of the best fishing on the west side. It's just a short ride north to McKenzie Bay or south to the main basin.www.whitewingresort.com"
4769922,Knoxabilly,2016-04-24 21:44:00,225,The boats are one of the very reasons we started coming here. They're 20 foot Starcrafts with 60hp Yamaha. They're very spacious and smooth even in big water. I just talked to Pat and she said she had the boat's refurbished for the season and reinforced the transoms. Evergreens camp and cabins are very clean- another thing that brought us in initially. And Pat is the best and will take care of you and make sure you have the best trip! 27 days and counting boys!
4770090,btyreprich,2016-04-25 04:33:00,1067,"This will be our second time with Pat at Evergreen Lodge. The boat and motor packages was a key factor in our deciding to stay here versus another lodge we had been going to for over 10 years. While the boats are not brand new, they are very well maintained. Same with the motors. The 60 hp motors really move these boats along nicely. To save money, we all fish out of one boat and can tell you there is enough room for our group of 4. Very nice people work and stay there. Our group is happy to have found this camp. Pat the owner of this camp told me she feels her boats are great advertising for the lodge. As such, she makes sure they are in great shape."
4773466,rather-be-fishin,2016-04-25 20:27:00,429,JDP What part of Lac Seul are you fishing now? RBF
4773498,JDP,2016-04-25 20:32:00,1457,"I go to Mahkwa Lodge. The reason I go there is quicker access to parts of Lac Seul that were long rides from Fisherman's Cove. Areas such as Aldous Bay, Bray Lake, Vaughn Lake, Bear Narrows and even on occasion Chamberlain Narrows."
4776194,prov1800,2016-04-26 16:03:00,5010,Why where you going so far.thats nuts.
4751778,LoDo,2016-04-19 13:10:00,721,"I used to fish Lac Seul 10-20 years ago and have stayed primarily in the Ear Falls area. I've stayed 20-50 miles south of Ear Falls too at a couple nice lodges. The past 10 years our group has fished the Caribou Prov Park west of Red Lake. Our group is doing the same this year too. However, spring 2017 our group is headed back to Lac Seul to get into some larger water. I'm curious as to what resort / outpost your prefer. LoDo"
4751858,ftfarms,2016-04-19 13:26:00,444,First 3-4 weeks after opener I like whitewing and that area. After that I would go lac suel lodge. Onaway lodge. Scout lake resort. Down in that area. Fishermans cove. All in that same area. That's what I used to do when we fished lac suel.
4752530,wallydave,2016-04-19 16:33:00,2151,"I have stayed at Goose Bay for many trips, Andrea has done a great job improving the cabins and docks, nice boat upgrades too. Good luck!"
4753290,mswope13,2016-04-19 20:37:00,73,"My vote goes to Evergreen Lodge, you can't beat the cabins and boats. Sure it's a long boat ride to Steamboat (30 minutes), but well worth it to us! I suppose if we were fishing McKenzie, further south would make sense."
4755162,Steve Ediger,2016-04-20 11:10:00,97,"Without a doubt, Lac Seul Lodge would be my choice. They have great cabins, boats, and equipment. It is close to great fishing in McKinzie Bay, South Inlet, Broad and Sunlight lakes and Manitoba point."
4755354,Knoxabilly,2016-04-20 11:45:00,225,Evergreen Lodge- the cabins and boats are top Notch. Pat and Moose are super helpful. Can't wait- one month out and we'll be there!
4755506,JDP,2016-04-20 12:25:00,1457,"For me for 17 years over 30 trips in that time, it was Fisherman's Cove.I have since migrated to a different part of Lac Seul."
4756034,prov1800,2016-04-20 15:29:00,5010,Agree with the area to stay.but wouldnt consider any of those places you mentioned close. But good fishing.and i would also highly recommend onaway lodge.
4756666,muskyroller,2016-04-20 18:17:00,56,Onaway. Period. Camp boats and motors - top notch! cabins - remodeled or new! dock - incredible...best we've ever had at 20+ camps up that way. Unlimited Ice - nothing worse than getting nickle and dimed for ice up there. So ridiculous. Minnows - massive...none of those peewee crappie minnows getting passed off as fatheads. AND Kathy doesn't sit and count out each one as she scoops em up for you. Blair and Kathy - tremendous owners and operators I'm sure there's more!
4756746,prov1800,2016-04-20 18:52:00,5010,And good fishing close to camp
