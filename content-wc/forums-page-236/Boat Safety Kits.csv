4788890,Mr Walleye,2016-04-30 15:09:00,29,"I searched this forum but couldn't find anything recent that states whether the outfitter is responsible to provide a ""Boat Safety Kit"" if I rent a boat from them. I've done over 20 fly-ins and never even thought about packing these ""kits"". I'd say that on most recent trips the outfitter had them in the boats for us. Anyone know who's responsility it is for RENTAL BOATS? Thanks in advance . . ."
4789594,speckmaster,2016-04-30 18:31:00,17,You!
4789650,pjshorthorn,2016-04-30 18:56:00,5654,"I would disagree to a certain extent. It is the responsibility of anyone renting a boat to make sure that everything is provided by the lodge to meet the boating safety requirements as outlined by the MNR regulations. This means.....make sure you have what is required from the outfitter. The MNR may write you a ticket even if the outfitter fell short on providing the proper gear.It is the lodge's responsibility to provide the required safety equipment for a rental boat. If anyone disagrees with my thought on this aspect, please correct me. I've used camp boats for many years and all the required gear was provided. I've always checked it to make sure , on every boat I've rented.Ask the outfitter if they provide the safety gear and then check it against the MNR regulations. PjShorthorn."
4789666,Obabikon,2016-04-30 19:07:00,2370,"We provide them in all of our boats, but we won't be the ones getting the ticket if a guest didn't have one. If I sent out a boat without one... I WOULD pay the ticket, but the officer is going to write it to the guest first. I hope I didn't confuse it. The ticket is being written to the person operating the boat. ""Official"" responsibility is to that person."
4789682,Obabikon,2016-04-30 19:09:00,2370,"Completely agree. MNR would write the ticket to the operator of the boat. However, the lodge owner SHOULD be the one responsible. (just my 2cents)"
4790370,north560,2016-05-01 04:37:00,53,"Most outfitters provide the safety kits, however you are the operator of the boat and responsible for everything about the boat. If you see something missing in the boat let the operator know, and if you do a portage make sure you take the safety kit from the main lake boat with you and be sure to put it back when you return from the portage."
4790874,John N,2016-05-01 07:35:00,362,What is supposed to be in the kit (per MNR reg. or otherwise)?John
4790930,Obabikon,2016-05-01 07:46:00,2370,"50' rope whistle or horn water tight flash light or 3 flares I think that's it.... but could be wrong. I didn't look it up on the MNR website, just went by what's in the safety kits that I buy."
4790970,north560,2016-05-01 07:53:00,53,"Floating throw rope, whistle (pealess),floating flashlight and bailing bucket.If boat has inboard motor then flares and fire extinquisher. Not in safety kit but should be, enough lifejackets for everyone aboard."
4790978,BreezyPoint,2016-05-01 08:04:00,1581,Both Red Wing Lodge and Vermilion Bay Lodge provide these kits.Frank
