I've found a number of references to""The Peephole"". Anyone have any idea where this is? East arm, west arm?"

4760826,nitroman,2016-04-21 20:24:00,368,Ol'Peehole man there alot of great spots to fish down there! Just go slow when going in it gets pretty shallow and watch out for the old man of the sea floating down there he may put a dent in the rig if you run him over!
4764682,Andyeye,2016-04-23 05:43:00,179,Nitro man is right it gets shallow going in there. Caught lots of crappies last August down in that area. They were deep!
