4774306,a3dad,2016-04-26 07:21:00,115,Hey anyone ever fish Lake Charlotte? I've been going to the Gouin for over 16 years with Air Tamarac but think it might be time to try something new next year. We mainly fish for trophy pike in May. Looking at the map the lake is 3 miles long - I think I'd cover that in about a day. I'm thinking that 5 days (our usual stay) might be WAY too long on that body of water. We were on a small lake once with a different outfitter and we bored to death by day 3. Anyway any experience with this lake? Is there enough pike fishing/habitat to keep us interested? Thanks for any advice.
