4785706,Lovetofish,2016-04-29 12:34:00,458,"I lose more jigs to northern than snags, so I buy Northland assorted colors from Mills Fleet, mostly 3/8ths. Works fine for me. Seems like I last bought them 100 jigs for $20. I fish stained water and use a white or chartreus twister tail on the jig. Jig color doesn't seem to matter. If the bite is slower I add a salted minnow."
4788618,Guest,2016-04-30 13:04:00,0,"!/8 or 1/4 oz. Perch or parrot, I like them short shanked and a minnow. Alive or dead doesn't matter with that spinner blade there adding flash and life. www.reelbait.com"
4789098,Guest,2016-04-30 16:13:00,0,"So many great jigs out there, but, I really like the Northland Whistler jig & Walleye love them."
4779450,Manitou,2016-04-27 13:03:00,125,"I see they now have a barbed version, mine is collared.I also size up on the hooks too."
4779634,kzoofisher,2016-04-27 13:57:00,5144,"The one with a walleye on it. Usually a darter or ball, with oversized hooks because I fish plastic all the time. For instance my 1/8 darters take a 3/0 aberdeen and I can put a large plastic on it and fish rip it while still getting a slow fall. Or a smaller plastic and tip it with a bit of meat."

4780026,Knoxabilly,2016-04-27 15:49:00,225,I like the knuckle ball and oddball jigs. Less snags and the hooks are great! I use a lot of the Bass Pro walleye jigs- I really dig the stand up style
4782298,Ver88,2016-04-28 11:44:00,114,I use homemade Roundhead jigs with a wire bait keeper. I like to fish plastics and making my own jigs allows me to use larger hooks than most jigs I see at the store. White 1/4 oz with a 2/0 hook and wire bait keeper is my go to jig.
4784874,rocko0305,2016-04-29 08:23:00,138,This sounds very similar to what I was going to say.The jigs I use most for walleye and smallmouth for fishing soft plastics are:Northland ThumpersNorthland Slurp/Mimic Minnow headsBlakemore Roadrunner 2.0 Pro (wish the hook was longer on these because I like the willow blade on these better than the Colorado blade on the Thumpers)BFishn Tackle Precision Jigs
4785002,Walleye_Guru,2016-04-29 08:55:00,62,Yep - odd ball all the way!
4785274,brad34,2016-04-29 10:26:00,892,Has anyone tried the flexi-jigs?
4785338,Ranger319,2016-04-29 10:47:00,166,"Just looked them up. At $3.50 each, I don't ever see myself trying them. Interesting concept though. I wonder how they hold up?"
4785346,brad34,2016-04-29 10:49:00,892,"Yep, the high cost is part of the reason I asked. Curious if they perform well and last very long."

4776818,fishron,2016-04-26 18:52:00,317,I favor the roadrunner jigs because they add the element of flash that a plain jig doesn't. Other jigs that get down a little faster can be better in some situations. A northland whistler jig that is sweeped on the retrieve or on the troll to produce added vibration can also be deadly.

4778482,KSjim,2016-04-27 08:24:00,88,Roadrunner and Walleye Weapon jigs mostly 3/16 and 1/4 oz. The last few years I have used more Fuzz-E Grub bodies than twister tails. The Fuzz-E-Grub bodies pair very well with a minnow.
4778546,Manitou,2016-04-27 08:34:00,125,"I pour my own ""walleye"" jigs using a do-it mold:http://store.do-itmolds.com/Walleye-...rb_p_1051.html"
4779274,Bill Krejca,2016-04-27 12:04:00,6107,"I'll second the walleye jig mold from Do-It, for not getting hung up as much in rocks.It is my favorite head for fishing in rocks. I have modified my mold by creating another hook eye position, so that the jig will hang completely horizontal (for fishing vertically). I don't know why the Do-It folks can't recognize the extra potential sales they could generate by providing another model with the horizontal feature.Bill"
4779378,billy weaver,2016-04-27 12:31:00,470,"I use 1/8 or 1/4 oz. jigs tipped with 3"" Tripple Ripple grubs. A veteran Canada fisherman told me to use white Tripple Ripples years ago and I would catch fish. I have found that to be true although I have went to other colors along with my goto white. Bass Pro sells the Tripple Ripples. I believe the split tail gives it a little more slow speed action on the drop."
4774586,Ranger319,2016-04-26 08:07:00,166,So what is everyone's favorite Walleye jig? Mine is 1/8oz vmc moon eye in pink uv with a white trailer
4774626,jveri,2016-04-26 08:12:00,70,I like the VMC moon eye jigs as well but mostly use 1/4 and 3/8oz jigs while up north. Use mister twister double tails and gulp minnows/leeches
4774634,wallydave,2016-04-26 08:13:00,2151,Sirmanski and Capt Redbeard jigs are my favorite jigs color doesn't seem to matter when the bite is on. 1/4 oz feels right with my eyecon.
4774738,BornToFish,2016-04-26 08:51:00,1224,"Greetings, If I could only take two lures with me to fish in Canada, they would both be jigs. They would both be of the ""live bait"" style featuring short shank hooks in size #2. One of the jigs would weigh 1/16 ounce. The other jig might also weigh 1/16 ounce, but more likely would weigh in at 1/8 ounce. The color of the jigs wouldn't matter that much to me, but would likely choose a custom gold glitter paint. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4774914,Twodogs,2016-04-26 09:40:00,115,A 1/4 or 3/8 oz purple wide gap jig with a trigger x swim bait..my go to bait 90% of the time. I must have bought 50 packs of the paddle tail minnow before trigger x got bought out by Rapala...not the same bait now.

4775738,Mike Borger,2016-04-26 13:51:00,1554,In the tannin stained waters I fish I really like the Northland Thumper jigs. The extra flash from the blade really seems to help.
