1318650,BuckeyeBill,2011-06-15 14:01:00,76,"muskyhunter, it has been a few years since I stayed at deer path lodge but I will give you my report on the camp and lake. As for fishing, I was targeting the smallies and then also fished for lake trout after some great tips from Rick, the owner. Excellent fishing for both and the big bay that we fished for smallies we had to our self. We really slayed them, plenty of fish in the 3 - 5 lb range. Seeing your name I assume you will be fishing for muskies and we did see quite a few while fishing for bass but did not go after them. Most of the smallies we caught on tubes baits and then also top water in the evenings.The cabins aren't anything special but did have all the conveniences, full kitchen and bath. I do remember that the living room area was short on seating. Rick is a great guy and was certainly a lot of help. Told us where to try for smallies and we never left that bay and then also gave us some pointers on how to catch the lakers in deep water which worked out great because it was our first time at fishing for lakes trouts.If it wasnt so far from Ohio and I wasn't 60 years old I'd make a trip there every year. You are also only 10 minutes from a launch ramp on Lac Seul which has tremendous walleye fishing. You wouldn't go wrong booking a trip with Rick.Bill"

I know every part of that lake. We will be fishing up there this year with a party of 11 guys the week of august 1st. My personal email is casica19682att.net if you need any help. Rick is a Great Guy and knows my family well. Please fee free to email me with any question.
1400253,Guest,2012-02-28 11:40:00,0,"I have fished Lakers from a island, and trolled for pike. We caught only 3 lakers and about 6 nice pike (33-35 inches). I dont know the lake very well, just wondering if anyone would want to share a little info about fishing for lakers and pike? also, is there any other fish in the lake (walleye, perch?) Also, does anyone have a map of the lake? I have been looking for a contour map, but no luck. Also, has anyone fished Lost Lake at all? I used to fish that lake from shore, and caught a few pike, but really thinking about putting the boat in just outside of hudson and trying for some eyes. I cant wait to get back up there, I love staying at Deer Path Lodge. Thanks for any help!"
1400595,counterguy,2012-02-28 22:08:00,84,"Deer Path is an awesome place to stay. The cabins have everything you need, bathroom, kitchen etc. they arent fancy but they are clean and well maintained. Rick and Evelyn are very friendly and accomadating. Big Vermillion is great for smallies, muskies and the big bay is great for Lake trout. There is even a couple of portage lakes off of Vermillion if you are up to it. If you want walleyes, in my opinion, the best place in Ontario is just a couple miles away. Lost lake which is part of Lac Seul, is by far the best drive to walleye lake anywhere. I like Deer Path because it is quiet, friendly, and not crowded. OH! and by the way, the sunsets are Awesome too!"
1421623,benn,2012-04-16 10:13:00,48,"Our group has fished Big V extensively for lakers early in the season (1st week June). We have caught muskies and smallies, but target the lakers. I'm sure the smallmouth fishing would be excellent. No experience fishing for muskies. For lakers, we fish them shallow (5 - 10' water) with shallow running plugs. We've found them in weedy bays, rock points and over the tops of reefs. They are everywhere that time of year! As the water warms we move to deeper water and use deeper diving lures. We will also find them suspended in open water, but they can be difficult to locate that way. We've stayed at Deer Path and it was fine, except when we were there, they had outhouses only. Big V is a very beautiful lake and a lot of fun! We also trailer to Lost and fish north of the landing a few miles for walleyes. Great walleye fishing over there! Look for windswept shoreline and you'll do fine."
1422795,crawler catcher,2012-04-18 11:26:00,72,"I make 4-6 trips each summer to Deer Path. Rick And Evelyn are great people and great hosts. Most of my fishing is on Lac Seul for walleye, northern and smallmouth. You won't be disappointed on that lake......awesome ! I only have had limited fishing on Big Vermillion. We wanted to target lake trout.....Rick marked the map and he was right on the spot. The lake is very good for smallmouth with musky in good supply. No walleye on this lake. I'm sure you have a GPS because you'll need it with the all rocks around. Give Rick a call with any questions. He'll give you straight answers and facts.Enjoy your trip."
1444506,fishnut,2012-06-04 07:08:00,46,"Benn, and all. I'm going to Sioux Lkt June 15. Primarily fish Minnitaki but usually fish Big V one day. My question is where to fish in Mid June? Is it to late for the shallows/. Probably to early for the deep Jig type fishing of mid summer. Would you suggest trolling spoons and plugs? Target what depth/ Also not to familiar with the lake layout. I have primarily fished the arm going bact to Littlle V. So many points and islands. Any help would be appreciated. Fishnut"
4791522,Doorcountyguy,2016-05-01 10:25:00,2,Curious how the fishing has been up on Big V. The past few years? Looking to head there with the family late August. Any info would be appreciated
