4794946,Thompmd,2016-05-02 10:29:00,320,I'm trying to research the lodge/area and read on a thread from a guy that mentioned there is a Red main channel buoy right in front of the cabin we are considering and there was a lot of boat traffic even cruisers and I am trying to verify? One of the things that attracted us to this lodge was the remoteness. Thoughts good or bad?

I rarely run into any boats fishing around the lodge itself. If you fish around Big Narrows Island or into Ptarmigan Bay you my see a few boats pass by. I can't say about the traffic around the private cabins. Kurt and Wendal have always been very fair to me and my family. I would ask them.

It's a good distance from the closest island island camps (maybe Big Narrows and Wiley) and a very long way from the mainland. The presence of a buoy doesn't mean high traffic. Once you hit the Tug Channel and go north up through French portage the traffic always seemed light to me. Sometimes downright lonely."
