Due to some schedule odors we are going to be going the second week in July this time. Has anyone fished Perrault Around time? Just trying to figure out wha to expect. Thanks, Bryan"

Some years, spring weather lingers forever and slows the progression of seasonal movements. Other years, summer weather takes over early and moves things along. On an average year, you will notice that things get more settled compared to your fishing experiences in June. June fishing typically involves covering water along shorelines to see where the fish moved along the shoreline. In July, many walleyes and pike are now set up on off-shore structure. You will likely find fish in 16-22 fow or so. You will work harder to find your first fish, but will notice that you then know where they all are. Vertical jigging might be the name of the walleye game when you are there. You might get away with anchoring on tops of the rock humps and pitching jigs if the weather is cool. Either way, you will very likely want to find structure away from shore. Weeds are usually well-developed by early July. Perch will be in these weeds. If the weather is cooler, you might encounter a fabulous top-water bite for smallies. If the weather is warm, the smallies might move out to the tops of off-shore structure. With regard to muskies, the old adage comes to mind: ""speed kills"". What lodge will you be staying at? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
