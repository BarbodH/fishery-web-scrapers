4783818,muskyroller,2016-04-28 19:30:00,56,"1. Tobie's for caramel rolls (crabby lady in there and all! - man she's unpleasant) We still stop all these years (40) even if the rolls have gone down hill. 2. Gas/Beer at the duty free store in Int. Falls 3. Used to do this before online licenses - Buy the licenses in Dryden. 4. Cheeseburgers the first night, after unloading all the gear, before going out for a ""pike tournament."" 5. After day 1 fishing, Walleye fish fry. 6. Game of ""Bags,"" beers, and VO (whisky) 7. Last day, hot dogs/brats shorelunch with spaghetti at night. Why? So, we are fishing/keeping legally. We use the last day for the fish we are going to bring home. MNR guys never believe us... There are more, I'm sure I'm just missing them."
4731690,itsme,2016-04-12 20:10:00,31,Hi Itsme againSome years ago we found this ideal stop for our lunch...Osseo Wis @ the Nordic Cafe. Most of us order the pork/mashed potatoes and gravy. Then those of use who really know our way around some of the best pie recipes anywhere; order the Lemon Coconut Pie. It sure would be nice to have a nap after that but its off to International Falls to have the Spl Strawberry/Pecan Salad with homemade poppy seed dressing @ The Chocolate Moose... You can order a 1/2 if you are still sated from lunch... But remember you won't have this chance for another year... Unless you are lucky enough to make two trips...
4732362,bigwalleye1,2016-04-13 06:24:00,2632,"First trip out from the landing, I stand in the boat and toss a couple Canadian coins over my right shoulder, over the stern, and into the waters of Lac Seul. Old sailor's tradition, and offering to Neptune for safe passage on the waters. Got to start a new tradition this year, mentioned previously in the thread. A toast to those no longer with us. One of the friends we've made in camp over the years passed a couple months ago. Tight lines, Kieth!!"
4732634,Golden Eagle,2016-04-13 08:07:00,2642,"Instead of a pacifier, I've offered a glass of warm milk (98.6 F.) to a whiner."
4732698,btyreprich,2016-04-13 08:16:00,1067,"My buddy and I are both 59 years of age. When we started to bring our kids up on the annual fishing trips, we would tell the young ones they'd have to ""pay their dues"" and be : 1. Minnow boy - getting us a minnow when we lost out bait 2. Net boy - man the net to land a fish 3. Pepsi boy - when we needed a drink. It was all in good fun and the adults made sure the kids caught fish and to make a big fuss over every fish they caught. Many times I'd set the hook on a fish and then quietly hand the rod to one of the kids as I was ""tired"". The looks on their faces when they'd realize they caught a fish was priceless."
4732778,camp chef,2016-04-13 08:38:00,915,"We traditionally stop at the Abbyland truck stop for a big breakfast once we get a couple hours out of town on our way up. We have had the same waitress for many years....We also have a tradition of bringing with us multiple blocks of 10 year old cheddar which we bring in and share or leave with our many friends we have made along our route north, /the place we stop for a beer ......the place we gas up and get bait....the place we stay the night before we boat in etc."
4735050,Baseline,2016-04-14 00:05:00,3207,"""No Bannas on the Boat"" I started this tradition about 15 years ago after my first trip to Alaska. Most of the charter boats I used had ""No Bananas"" posted. Some of the harbors also have these signs. The first time I saw one I asked the charter captain about it. He said Bananas are bad luck. He continued by explaining that many years ago they would load so many Bananas on a sail boat that it would sink in any kind of bad weather. Bananas on board were soon determined to be unlucky cargo."
4735498,Carnhzkr,2016-04-14 08:05:00,964,"Last fall, for the first time in my life I hired a guide. He's perhaps the most well-known guide in the Sturgeon Bay area, and on his website it mentions you can bring a small cooler for snacks but specifically states, ""no bananas in the boat"". I assumed that had something to do with the stringy banana peels getting stepped on and crushed into his $80k boat, but when I asked about that when booking I was told it was bad luck. I'd never heard of that before. As it turned out, I'd have been better off bringing a whole bunch of bananas because we struck out on the fishing."
4735506,Danbear,2016-04-14 08:08:00,72,"Our gang always stops at Uncle Mikes tavern in Trego,Wi for lunch. Mike remembers us every year, they have great burgers and sandwichs and it's right on Hwy 53 easy on and off."
4735554,ogilville,2016-04-14 08:16:00,262,We always said any new guy going had the lowest seniority and had to get out and pull the boat through the places that were too shallow to drive the boat through. Of course we never go anywhere that shallow but the new guy doesn't need to know. We always tell a new guy how good the fishing is in Canada. The fishing can be so good that sometimes you have to stand behind a tree to bait your hook....
4735810,forgop,2016-04-14 09:30:00,880,"Ewwww2 years ago, my uncle went all week without getting in the outdoor shower until the morning we flew out. He even fell out of the boat midway through the trip. Told my cousin he's not getting in the plane to fly out unless he gets a shower first. Thankfully, he chose to jump in the shower without having to say anything."
4730210,Hooper,2016-04-12 12:45:00,4,"It seems like it's been a few years since a thread on Canada trip traditions has popped up. We are taking 3 new guys in our group this year, it will be fun to share the traditions and stories of years past and start some new ones. What tradition would you be most excited to share with a new member of your fishing group?"
4730682,bigwalleye1,2016-04-12 14:27:00,2632,"That the new guy gets his choice, wash or dry, but those are the only options ( WATCHING is not a choice)"
4730818,pjshorthorn,2016-04-12 14:49:00,5654,"The newbie or youngest member on the trip gets the job of plunging the toilet (or sticking the holding tank on a houseboat ) regardless of who may have created a problem. My son was awarded a golden plunger at the end of last year's trip for his fantastic plumbing prowess in keeping the pipes clear all week Of course, any other shenanigans to make it a memorable trip are celebrated often and with great reverance ;culminating in an overall wienie award given to the member who displayed exceptional performance in making themselves look silly throughout the week PjShorthorn."
4731266,Pooch,2016-04-12 17:10:00,4619,"We used to bring a pacifier on a neck string and give it to anyone who was whining. Last time I saw it, it was headed south on a buddies trailer. Tied to the license plate holder.Gave a guy a box of Midol once after listening to him crab around all day about something totally insignificant. He didn't get the humor in that. Didn't help his mood any either. But was worth it..........Pooch"
4731298,WalleyeMatt,2016-04-12 17:20:00,93,We have never had to plunge the out house. All gravity. Loading the boat and truck the night before is a process and tradition enjoyed by all. The toast to the guys who are no longer with us. The stop at the LCBO in Wabagoon is one everyone likes. Matt
4731442,jimirjr,2016-04-12 18:22:00,1149,"Not really a ""CANADIAN"" trip tradition.... BUT.. When We go to Wyoming for the weekly GUYS, camping, fishing, et al, trip... NEW GUY buys the ""ROCKY MOUNTAIN OYSTERS"" Minimum of 10 lbs...."
4731458,Mike Borger,2016-04-12 18:28:00,1554,"I could have used that on one of my trips last year, great idea."
4731482,dented boat guy,2016-04-12 18:35:00,24,Tomato and mozzarella salad and Kokanee.
4731530,nitroman,2016-04-12 18:54:00,368,Ours is kinda gross but its the annual who can go tje longest without a shower. Not so bad when its cold but when its warm out well...... After some making it the whole week it's not as popular as it once was!
4731682,elkman99,2016-04-12 20:09:00,180,Try to watch the old Paul Newman movie Slap Shot at least once during the week.
