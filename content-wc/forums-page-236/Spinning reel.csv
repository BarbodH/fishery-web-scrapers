4796610,halfmoon007,2016-05-02 18:40:00,121,Our group of nakina fly ins were all shimano die hards but were slowly all switching to pflueger presidents.we all were wearing out the pricey shimanos way to fast. The pflueger seems to out last the shimano in durability and is perfect for those Mellchett lake walleyes and of coarse that dreaded MR PIKIE. LOL Yea babie 89 days and a wake up and its float plane time....Halfmoon the camp cook. (you know Me I'm the guy that takes your booze weight away to fly in groceries.) How about oil and breading only this year Boys. LOL

4793450,nitroman,2016-05-01 21:16:00,368,http://www.cabelas.com/product/Pflue...A&gclsrc=aw.ds With some Nanofil on this you can pitch jigs a country mile with that setup
4793794,Bigstorm,2016-05-02 05:59:00,799,I would recommend a Pflueger Patriarch or Supreme XT. I know a lot of people like the Shimano Stradic Ci4 too but I haven't tried that (I have the older version of the Stradic and I personally like both Pfluegers better)
4793866,BornToFish,2016-05-02 06:23:00,1224,"Greetings, I hope that I am not sounding like a broken record, as there have been similar threads the last few months. You have selected an outstanding fishing rod. Peak sensitivity with any rod + reel is achieved when it's balanced. The reel should not cause the rod + reel to be either ""tip heavy"" or ""butt heavy"". There are many good brands and models of reels out there to choose from. I wouldn't be too preoccupied with the brand, but rather the size of the reel's frame (e.g. 750, 1000, 1500, 2500, etc.). Picking the wrong reel size can turn your outstanding fishing rod into a club. Picking the correct reel size will amaze you in terms of the sensitivity of your fishing rod. It's all about how the rod + reel feels in your hand. The rod + reel should disappear in your hand when the reel is chosen properly. I have been very pleased over the years with several of the Shimano reels - Saros and Stradics. You didn't mention the power or action of your new St. Croix, so I am not able to suggest a reel size for you to start with. I fish quite a bit with light power St. Croix fishing rods. It's tough for me to beat a 1000 series Shimano reel on my walleye rods. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4793922,Ranger319,2016-05-02 06:29:00,166,"6'3"" Med/extra fast I was thinking about a 1000 series Shimano. I was also looking at the new Abu Garcia spinning reels as well as Pflueger. Thanks everyone for the suggestions so far."
4794298,stevensinks,2016-05-02 07:56:00,330,I go along with BornToFish . I buy a GOOD rod then just find a reel that feels good on it. The rod is what catches the fish.
4794306,bthomas3333,2016-05-02 07:57:00,465,"I have the exact same rod. I pair it with a Shimano Stradic Ci4. I tried it in the store with all three reel sizes. I personally preferred the 4000 because I wanted a little more drag, but the 2500 or 3000 might fit you best.You will LOVE the rod. I honestly think I pick up on an extra handful of bites every night.Brett"
4794338,fishron,2016-05-02 08:05:00,317,"It's really a pleasure to fish quality small (1000) reels for walleye on light graphite rods. But when I fish a lake that has more potential to produce a plus size walleye or large pike on occasion, I prefer to use a 2000 or slightly above size reel. The drag is more robust and the capacity allows me to fish a slightly heavier superline. Even a small reel can wear down a big fish but if there are stumps and rocks around the odds seem to go the other way. You've chosen a great rod. good luck with reel to balance it best."
4795634,ftfarms,2016-05-02 14:07:00,444,I have 5 shimano stradic ci4 and they're smooth very smooth. I also have 3 pflueger patriarch and love them. For the money I just got the new pflueger president limited edition 30 off ebay for $70 and probly the best reel I've messed with for the money.
4796218,pikeman14,2016-05-02 16:51:00,144,"I would recommend the Shimano symmetry, I like it more than my ci14. The phlueger president is also a great reel for the price."
