4787466,Bigredmf,2016-04-30 06:57:00,129,It's great when a couple come diving in and munch through a swarm and eliminate it in short order.Dragonflies are the good guys.Red

4788834,CI_Guy,2016-04-30 15:04:00,2118,They don't work on black flies but they work better for mosquitoes if you put a couple under the cleaning table instead of on top.
4791114,Guest,2016-05-01 08:33:00,0,Maybe you don't know what black flies are.
4791506,martinbns,2016-05-01 10:15:00,1520,One of the other good thing to do is wear light coloured clothes. Black flies are attracted to opaque objects.
4792034,prov1800,2016-05-01 13:22:00,5010,I know what they are.read the post and though about the ankle biters.made a mistake.i live just north of vermilion bay so i know them well.dont find them to be to bad.them ankle biters are worse.black flies are worst near fast moving water if thats a tip.iam on the water most days and do lots of shorelunches and normally never see a blackfly.more skitters than anything.
4793834,Skywagon,2016-05-02 06:15:00,1106,"It is the same discussion every year, black flies as we know them here in Ontario, are not ankle biters. Black flies are tiny, ankle biters are about the size of a house fly. Many people (including me) if bitten by a black fly, will have a welt for a few days, not the case with the ankle biter, they are just an annoyance. Ankle biters seem to be an issue when you are in the boat, going after your ankles, black flies are only an issue when you are on shore. The only real solution that I have found for black flies when tromping around the bush is to wear a head net, works for deer flies too."

4784322,Freytown,2016-04-29 05:53:00,770,"When the black flies are real bad, skipping a shower works for me...just sayin'."
4784562,Bill Krejca,2016-04-29 07:05:00,6107,That explains a lot! Habits begun while camping seem to carry over to most of my all north woods fishing activities. Bill
4784658,Bakefish,2016-04-29 07:13:00,1077,"Coppertone Sport sun block cream. I'm telling you that it works. I was in Canada packing up the boat to come home and was surrounded by those pesky lil buggers. I remembered reading about someone mentioning Coppertone as a repellent. I squirted some on my hand and rubbed it on the back of my neck....problem solved, immediately. I'm a believer."
4784810,camp chef,2016-04-29 08:00:00,915,X 100............Best thing ever..... We have been using it for a bunch of years now.
4784914,big popi,2016-04-29 08:33:00,635,I agree with the Coppertone Sport (we use the spray) it works better than anything else I have tried.
4784930,Golden Eagle,2016-04-29 08:41:00,2642,"Dragonflies eat blackflies. Where can I buy a box of dragonflies for my May 14-28 trip? I expect blackflies to show up a bit early this season. Blackflies, then dragonflies, then yellow butterflies, followed by spawning shiners. All contribute to great fishing. Nature rules. Fishing during time of change makes my life better."
4784962,camp chef,2016-04-29 08:48:00,915,A big Dragon Fly hatch is one of the coolest things there is to experience
4784978,Walleye_Guru,2016-04-29 08:52:00,62,"For our kids, we rub vaseline behind their ears, on the neck and hair line. Works great! Doesn't necessarily repel, but it does prevent them from biting! Blackfly season usually starts around the last week in May, first we in June and peaks mid June. Come July (when walleye fishing is probably at it's best) they can be non-existent. On a dry year, we've gone almost black fly-less. Its pretty rare, but goes to show you moisture has a huge impact on the population and their buggyiness."
4787050,ftfarms,2016-04-30 04:58:00,444,One year we had about everything in the boat. Cooperton sport highest % of deet you can buy and a couple others they all worked for skeeters but the only two that worked on the little black Flys was the white mountain but stinks and the bug soother smells good but you need to repay alot. That was our findings.
4787410,martinbns,2016-04-30 06:44:00,1520,My wife swears by the Watkins stuff. They bug her more than me.
4783346,spw2350,2016-04-28 17:15:00,26,I was looking at an ad for Thermacell a mosquito repellant review are very positive anybody have experience using it against blackflies?
4783362,Blades-n-Beads,2016-04-28 17:32:00,484,I have tried them before works great on mosquitos with no wind but for black flies the only thing I have found that works is Repel Lemon Eucaliptus repellent.
4783882,Pooch,2016-04-28 20:00:00,4619,Last year I followed the advice from another WC question like yours and purchased a can of fly spray intended for livestock. Worked good in the boat. Didn't see any ill effects either to me or boat. Farm and Fleet or similar stores carry it.Pooch
4783922,prov1800,2016-04-28 20:14:00,5010,Best thing i have found out is runners and socks and pants.for added security place a couple of dead minnows in a strategic spot on the floor of the boat and a fly swatter.this system cant be beat.should end up with around 500 flies on a average day.
4784106,martinbns,2016-04-28 22:13:00,1520,"I lived in Blackfly country for a long time, eventually they stop bugging you. I found a good aggressive aerosol with heavy deet the best, the other tip I would give is large wraparound sunglasses. For me as long as the flies don't get under the glasses I am good."
4784146,rather-be-fishin,2016-04-28 22:40:00,429,This product works good for those nasty biting black flies! You do have to reapply frequently. I make sure everyone in our group has some in their boat. Give it a try. http://www.whitemountaininsectrepellent.com/ RBF
4784178,pjshorthorn,2016-04-29 02:23:00,5654,"Now I understand why using a guide in Canada can be a little pricey. They have to find fish, run the boat, make shorelunch AND swat black flies.......that's a lot of stuff......PjShorthorn."
4784258,acplumber,2016-04-29 05:04:00,80,I remember a post last year that someone said coppertone sport spray sunblock?? Maybe that was for the no seeums?
4784266,Guest,2016-04-29 05:10:00,0,Blue Jeans.
4784282,jfaisten,2016-04-29 05:28:00,1060,I found the higher the DEET content the better. Of course if you get any in your eyes your fishing day is about shot. Black Flies have ruined 2 trips for me regardless of the spray I used. Can't take a walk or sit outside and enjoy the day. They are miserable. Good luck.
