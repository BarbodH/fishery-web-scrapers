4764250,Pooch,2016-04-22 20:24:00,4619,"How about showing us where that reef is you are talking about? Is it one of the red circled areas on the attached map? I ran across one about the middle of McKenzie Bay several years ago and put a waypoint on it, but now can't find it. I'm thinking it was about dead center of the bay. Maybe half way between the small island and rocky area SE of Moose Island and Deer Island. Out in the open area of the bay. I thought it was about in the middle of the yellow circled area on the attached map. Maybe it was the blue circled hazard on the map itself? I just can't remember and I'm angry at myself for losing the waypoint somehow.Pooch"
4764314,prov1800,2016-04-22 20:42:00,5010,I would say thats pretty close.about the farthest east on the red line.by theceast shanty.ive seen it sticking out of the water years ago and theres a lot of lower unit parts there.lol.
4765986,pjshorthorn,2016-04-23 16:26:00,5654,Thanks for sharing the book information. I'll need to look into getting a copy. PjShorthorn.
4775562,jimwalleye,2016-04-26 13:03:00,30,"Two springs ago I was going through Shanty Narrows and the buoy was missing and you guessed it, I hit the rocks with my 300 Verado. The motor ran fine the rest of the week but the Skeg was missing. When I got back they put a gauge on it and it showed the shaft was slightly bent. That was over a $3000 mistake I hope not to make again. We were staying in Fisherman's Cove, we found out that the walleyes don't come to the center basin until a little later in the season. We did catch lots of big walleyes in Broad Lake that week which were spawning. Also we had some great northern fishing in the creek on the right side going down towards those falls can't remember the name, South Bay maybe. The ice had gone out late and we were there over Memorial Day week."
4776178,prov1800,2016-04-26 16:00:00,5010,Could have been worse.your lucky.
4756098,prov1800,2016-04-20 15:40:00,5010,Just to let you know.if you go down the shanty narrows coming from the bay of islands And you havnt hit anything yet your lucky.there is a huge reef just before you get to the east shanty.you will see thecred jug coming.but from the small island you pass it just out front of that.
4756594,Pooch,2016-04-20 18:01:00,4619,"How about Prov1800, Steve and others with knowledge of those areas post a map for the rest of us who only occasionally transit that and other dangerous areas?Even as I try to keep my paper maps marked with red X's as I encounter those ""knot in stomach"" areas unexpectedly, I know there are many others just waiting to hurt me and others.I fish every year with a guy who grew up on LS and knows the lake well. He always drives and tries to show me areas to be careful when approaching. When fishing LS I'm always just a little ""on edge"" and never run WOT.Pretty please? :-)Pooch"
4756634,prov1800,2016-04-20 18:14:00,5010,"For any of you guys that fish lac seul and have a navions canada chip there is a safe route on that chip from earfalls to sioux lookout.not sure if they still have that on the new chips.mine is8-9 years old. it would take you rightvthrough the shanties and poplar narrows toward manitoba point, etc."
4757514,Pooch,2016-04-21 05:16:00,4619,"My Navionics chip is not quite as old as yours and the travel route is also on it. Sometimes it takes me through some kind of precarious areas when I know there is a safer passage. Have seen that several times in the Mahkwa area west. I've learned to be a little reluctant to follow it blindly, but maybe I should have more faith in it. I'm much more comfortable traveling in the Mahkwa area than from Manitoba Point on north and west. I spend a week on both ends each year with the LSL/McKenzie bay area being relatively new to me.Is there an actual ""old channel"" through LS? Is the Navionics travel route the old channel?Pooch"
4757594,prov1800,2016-04-21 05:47:00,5010,It might be.i think that route was used when they were hauling supplies in the old days to the gold mine in red lade.
4757666,pjshorthorn,2016-04-21 06:01:00,5654,"I transferred my ""self approved"" navigation route. (NE section) onto a map from memory for some fellas last year and I was really surprised at how close the Navionics was to the one I had learned over many years. The Wapesi, Root,English and Vermillion Rivers all enter the lake on the NE and SE end of the lake. I believe the Navionics and published houseboating routes follow the river channels created way back when . Some of the best fishing I have had on the NE section is in narrows where the water flow (rivers ) is very prevalent. I believe Prov1800 is dead on about the route being one that was used for supplies transfer. That aspect is pretty well documented. PjShorthorn"
4757818,Pooch,2016-04-21 06:43:00,4619,"If you can get your hands on a copy of ""Yesterday The River"" by Rae Kiebuzinski you will surely enjoy it. Tremendous amount of information about the history of that entire area we are chatting about.Probably not news to my Canadian friends, but for the rest of us it's really an interesting read.Pooch"
4758298,prov1800,2016-04-21 08:30:00,5010,Well pooch being a canadian i admit i love that stuff.a freind of mine in sioux lookout his father in law ran a tug boat hauling supplies to earfalls for the mines.interesting stories as these guyscteavelled day and night with no navigation.i do fish the sioux lookout end at times and find it safer teavelling in that end than the west end and there buoys are still in place.but thectrip up to chamberlain is a duzy.
4761834,Stringbean,2016-04-22 07:32:00,279,"I can identify with what muskyroller said. The green buoy is there for a reason and if you are going NW(downstream), the green buoy should be on your right. I'm in the channel between the green buoy and the white jug and here comes Mr. Speedboat down the channel on the wrong side of the green buoy. It amazes me that very few people know how to use the navigational aids provided. I can't recall the depth of the water over there, but if you look down, the boulders are right there. During the summer of the really low water several years back, these boulders were dry land."
4762434,prov1800,2016-04-22 09:53:00,5010,I myself know how to go on the wrong side of the green jug and the red one.as long as you have done it and feel comfortable about it.i take many routes that i wouldnt recommend to any one.i see a lot of people coming from the bay of island heading for mckenzie bay and dont think a lot of people realize that there is a huge reef right in the middle headed that way.one particular spot comes up very shallow when water drops throughout summer or it was visible some years ago.there are lots of those kinds of hazards out in the middle of nowhere.
2887089,Pooch,2014-06-11 07:24:00,4619,I've only been through these narrows a couple time and it seems fairly precarious. Always went very slow and still scuffed up a scag last year. Is there a path or safe way to go though there without swallowing your heart every time you see rocks just under the water next to the boat?Sure would appreciate some experience in that area. Some kind of marked map would be great!Thanks in advance.Pooch
2887921,LoDo,2014-06-11 10:43:00,721,Are you traveling throughout the Shany narrows instead of Steamboat Narrows to get to MacKenzie Bay. Or am I way off?
2888233,Guest,2014-06-11 12:01:00,0,Biggest hazard is at the light on Mckenzie bay side The green bout is missing most of the time there is a reef that goes from the light west approx 30 yards. Steamboat side I go to the west side of the first island heading towards McKenzie bay
2888241,skindzier,2014-06-11 12:04:00,137,"Definitely scary. Prior to having a GPS, I crawled thorough there. The Navionics chip does a great job getting you through there - I still go pretty slow though. It is definitely not a straight-line..."
2888673,Pooch,2014-06-11 14:51:00,4619,"Lodo, Last year we stayed at Goose Bay and went through Steamboat Narrows then ran the length of Steamboat to go through both Shanty narrows areas on our way to McKenzie Bay.Meloveseyes, I don't remember a light near either Shanty Narrows. Is that what the yellow mark is on the attached map? When we leave Steamboat Bay and enter West Shanty Narrows then head into East Shanty Narrows, are you saying to stay to the ""right"" as you go SW headed for the main basin and McKenzie Bay through the narrows? Last year there was a jug about in the middle of East Shanty narrows. Does that mark (approximately) the east end of the rock reef? If so, then I should stay west of that jug (if it's there this year)?Skindiezr, I have the Navionics card, but didn't put a lot of faith in it going through that area. That's how I scuffed my skag, even at a fast idle as I went up and over a large rock. Might have been part of that rock reef the others were talking about. Not knowing what the jug last year marked, I probably was on the ""inside"" of it. Hopefully we are staying at Lac Seul Lodge this year so we can avoid that entire area. New question:Does anyone know, as we leave LSL and enter Farewell Bay can we turn right (south) and go through that shallow area marked as ten FOW just north of Bay of Islands to access the main basin and McKenzie?I sure appreciate all your help.Pooch"
2888809,South Dakota,2014-06-11 15:54:00,24,"Looking at the recent Lac Seul water levels posted, you should have no problem with those narrows. I know them well and have traversed them several times. No worries."
2889993,Guest,2014-06-12 05:16:00,0,"Pooch The map does show the lights and are marked yellow. Leaving Lac Suel Lodge you only options are to head south into Bay of Islands or head straight east into the center of Shanty narrows then head south. Personally I would head south and go to Bay of Islands and go between the two islands that has Shanty Narrows written that goes east/west. Clear path till the red bouy at McKenzie/Shanty Narrows. Current water levels, you should be ok. Might talk to others in camp and follow them if you are unsure of the Shanty Narrows route> better option if there is a STIFF south wind. Good luck and set the hook!"
2890113,muskyroller,2014-06-12 06:20:00,56,Been fishing and traveling through this area for about ten years now. Hug the WEST shoreline and you should be good as you are getting into McKenzie Bay or coming out of it. My father in-law and I were fishing the east side a few years back and had a boat come rippin' through the EAST side..........I'm still not sure how they didn't rip up their lower unit and I'm still not sure how they thought it was a good idea to go full blast twenty yards or so from another boat. Good luck to all on LS...we'll be up in 8 days! 41st annual...thanks Grandpa Rick!
4754626,Hooper,2016-04-20 09:10:00,4,"Any comments on how accurate the hazards are indicated in the highlighted area? I think about 4 years ago the water was down a bit and you could really see how nasty that area is. We have some bread crumbs saved in a gps that seem to work ok for us, but I'm surprised I don't hear about more trouble from this area."
4755234,Steve Ediger,2016-04-20 11:22:00,97,"If you don't mind traveling a bit further and you are coming from Steamboat you can go into Farwell Bay and go around the west end of the big island. You will need to go through a narrow opening between the big island and a small island but it is a sand bottom. Once you are through the narrows, all you need to do is head east through the Bay of Islands. You will soon be just south of shanty narrows and can keep going east to McKinzie Bay or head south to go to the South Inlet, Manitoba Point, Sunlight or Broad lake. This route should keep you clear of the rocky hazards you face in Shanty Narrows."
