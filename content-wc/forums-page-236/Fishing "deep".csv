4760890,prov1800,2016-04-21 20:39:00,5010,Lake trout wise i use a number of cranks and spoons and to get them down to 50-60 ft its 50'out then hoom a 6 oz line weight on and then a 100' out at 1 1/2+ mph does that trick..would bectargetting trout down 65-70'.walleyes in the 20-25 ft range can easilg be reached with bottom bouncers.
4763090,WallyWarrior,2016-04-22 12:58:00,2488,I don't think you read my reply. Someone said they could get to those depths without the use of weights.
4763138,prov1800,2016-04-22 13:09:00,5010,I did read your reply and that technique i mentioned is what my book says for those lures.i get to fish with tony puzzio a lot here and he is a master at trolling and have learned a lot from him.we do a lot of long lining on eagle for lake trout and we fish evenings for huge walleyes that come up shallow so we run anywhere from 15 -20' all off planer boards with out weights but according to the book which gives you specific speed and amount of line.we fish over 80 ft of water.but shiners will be near the surface.
4763170,WallyWarrior,2016-04-22 13:25:00,2488,"Ok? So do you have any idea what crank bait he is talking about that will get to 50 feet without any help? I have no argument who you fish with, I have no argument that you can catch fish shallow over deep water, I have no argument that attaching 6 oz of lead to your line will get you to 50 feet. What I am questioning is what crank will get to 50 feet without the help of weight? You quoted me and your reply didn't seem to be in line with my conversation. Sorry for brining it up.* (edit) I read back and see that you were replying to the second part of my statement. I get what you are saying now."
4763258,prov1800,2016-04-22 13:56:00,5010,Ok i seecwhat your asking.if there is a crank that goes that deep i dont know about it.sounds like a lot of bull to me.
4763338,Ranger319,2016-04-22 14:21:00,166,A strike King 10xd would troll to 50. There is a video of a guy casting it out and hitting bottom at 40 something. I would have to think that trolling it would get it to 50.
4763506,spurs101,2016-04-22 15:22:00,635,Why not just mount a Cannon Mini Downrigger and run cranks behind the ball... then you know where your at. I've used that in September in Canada. Deadly and maximizes time in strike zone. Thundersticks and Hot n Tots. Vertical jig a 3/8 or slow drift. I never targeted fish below 30.
4763826,Manitou,2016-04-22 17:22:00,125,Just troll a floating crankbait on a three-way swivel rig or a bottom bouncer.2 oz. works for me on LOTW.Put those old floating rapalas you haven't used in years back to work.
4764426,h8go4s,2016-04-22 21:30:00,1673,"BS. Here's a quote from the 2016 Strike King online catalog:Series 10XD 2 oz. Dives to 25 feet and beyondAn extra large deep diving crankbait with unique curved bill that allows the bait to dive deeper & faster than most other deep diving crankbaitshttp://www.strikeking.com/pdf/catalo...SK_catalog.pdfIf this thing would dive even close to 40 feet, Strike King would be bragging it up, not advertising it as ""25 feet and beyond""."
4764434,Ranger319,2016-04-22 22:19:00,166,"Maybe I should have said a 10XD POTENTIALLY cound dive when trolled to 50'. Anyway, I did some digging and here is the link to the discussion. A lot of people calling bs on the guy until he posted a video. I went to watch the video and it asked me to sign in? No clue what that is about. If you read the comments, you can see he must have done what he said he did and hit 40'.http://www.bbcboards.net/showthread....highlight=10xdPersonally, I willNever know how deep they run. I have zero desire to horse in that size of crankbait. One cast and I would be spent. LOL"
4753914,Ranger319,2016-04-20 07:08:00,166,"Our group goes to LS every June and we usually have no problem catching fish in 8-14'. Very rarely do we ever try fishing deeper than this. There are times when I think we are missing out not going deeper. So how does one fish in the 20'+ range? Would we go to our typical spots and keep moving out until we hit 20'? Or would we need to find new spots? Having never really attempted this, I have no idea what to look for. Thanks"
4754026,Golden Eagle,2016-04-20 07:31:00,2642,"Locate a hump. Move toward the wind (deeper water) until you've located walleyes. Feed them jigs. When you're into walleyes, cast toward shallower water occasionally to try for a large pike."
4754154,BornToFish,2016-04-20 07:55:00,1224,"Greetings Ranger, I fish a lake not too far away from Lac Seul. The lake that I fish is fairly clear and deep. I find that walleyes in June are in a time of transition. The walleyes are primarily relating to shorelines in early June, but typically move out to structure by end of June. The structure that I am referring to is usually near shore - the first set of humps and islands off of shorelines. I look for the walleyes near the top of these structural elements during June - say 15 fow or so. June is also a time of transition in my presentation to the walleyes. In early June, I am often casting crankbaits or jigs/minnows along shorelines and trolling weed edges. I am often vertical jigging by the end of June. That is, my presentation transitions from horizontal (cranking and trolling, a classic reaction bite) to vertical (finesse bite). One thing that I have learned over the years is that it's all about depth of water when the fish move off the shorelines. I have to fish at or slightly above the depth of water holding walleyes or I won't get bit. It's that simple. I select a presentation when fishing offshore structure that maximizes the amount of time that my lure is in the fish's strike zone. I will cast a jig/minnow or crankbait if the depth of water holding fish is big enough - e.g. the top of a flat rock hump. On the other hand, if the fishing are holding along the sides of the rock hump, casting is a poor presentation as the lure just doesn't spend enough time in the strike zone. This is when I switch to vertical jigging as I can keep the jig in the strike zone at all times through proper boat control. Fishing ""deep"" is problematic for many anglers as they struggle to keep their lure in the fish's strike zone. They are either too deep or too shallow. I spend a LOT of time vertical jigging. I change depth of water being fished in increments of one fow as I always want my jig in the strike zone. That is, my line is truly vertical - perpendicular to the water!! I am most definitely not trolling (i.e. my line is at an angle to the surface of the water). In summary, I encourage you to give thought to what depth of water is showing you fish that you want to target. Once you figure this out, then select a presentation that maximizes the time your lure is in this depth of water, that is, is in the strike zone. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4755178,tv4fish,2016-04-20 11:16:00,2694,"Ranger: I would certainly ALWAYS try your ""hotspots"" first. That is what my group does on Lac Seul. We know we have caught fish in those hot spots - it may just be a matter of ""sliding in or out"" until you find the depth where the fish are. We do a controlled drift while vertical jigging starting shallow and working deeper on each pass- keep an eye on your locator and you will soon find out where the fish are on that day. Weather conditions WILL make a diference."
4758178,prov1800,2016-04-21 08:11:00,5010,Lac seul i a different lake to fish.problem with it is it takes forever to warm up.walleyes tend to followshallowemperature.early june is tough fishing unless you head to known spots but those get crowded.not sure what part of june you come in but that makes a big difference.or which part of the lake your staying at.i wouldnt be worried about gojng to much deeper unless you can find warmef water.thats the key.you might have 60 degresx in a bay but it will be50-55 on the main lake.big difference.lac seul walleyes do behave different than some other lakes.maybe go shallower like 2 ft.old weed beds work great.anything that draws heat like sand in the back bays or any trickle of current will bring them in.lac seul doesnt ever warm up till early july to really hump fish.
4760306,yoopertrout,2016-04-21 16:57:00,1172,"The last time I went to Canada, it was mid June. The group leaving the lake reported that they were doing well in 6'-10' of water. After we arrived, it got cold and windy. We did better in 15-25' of water, especially for bigger fish. The wind was angling out from shore, so, when it wasn't too windy, we'd make short casts or vertical jig. When it was too windy to do that, we backtrolled up wind doing the same. Walleyes aren't my main species, so I'm not pro, but that worked."
4760658,zeebee,2016-04-21 19:21:00,1144,"Come mid August, with rare exception, I target 20- 40'. I dont enjoy jigging; troll 95% of the time. There are many cranks that will get you down to 30' and a few to 50' without need of weights or other aids. BB with 3-4 ozs allows for a slow presentation if conditions call for it. Rarely do you need to go below 20 before August.....cold fronts as mentioned might be one of those situations. Its also generally true that larger fish are more plentiful at deeper depths."
4760690,prov1800,2016-04-21 19:34:00,5010,Dont understand the need to fish that deep besides the fact there easier to get.but a death sentence to most of the fish released.
4760802,h8go4s,2016-04-21 20:16:00,1673,"I'd be interested in a list of cranks that would troll to 50'. I know of a few that will do 30' (Rapala Deep Tail Dancer is my favorite) but even 35' is a stretch. And yes, you should plan to keep every walleye you catch that deep as their survival rate drops the deeper they are caught. No point in releasing a fish that will die anyway."
4760834,WallyWarrior,2016-04-21 20:25:00,2488,"Agreed. 50 feet without the aid of a diver, leadcore, or snap weights? I do a lot of trolling and would be interested to hear what these cranks would be. Even the 30 feet listed above is pretty hard to reach in a real world scenario. As for the actually getting down that far, I would download the precision trolling app and look at the snap weight calculations. It will help you get an idea of what it actually takes to get down that far."
