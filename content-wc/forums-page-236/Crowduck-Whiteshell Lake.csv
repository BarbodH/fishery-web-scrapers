Also, are there any fish in Whiteshell and is there any other way into Crowduck? I have heard you can take one day trips back into Crowduck. Does anyone know how much that costs? Any info in general is appreciated.Thanks"
524173,Guest,2002-09-10 10:35:00,0,"You can get into crowduck from Big Whiteshell lake, its about a five to ten minute ride across the lake from Big Whiteshell lodge. There is a portage trail that is about 1/2 mile that you can walk into the lake. You can arrange for a boat rental in Crowduck (including a ride across big whiteshell and back). The walleye have been a little slow in big whiteshell, but is always hot, with many trophy sized walleyes in crowduck. Keep in mind that crowduck is strictly catch and release only. I'm not too sure on the costs for rentals as I have always just launched my own boat in Whiteshell and walked into crowduck. but check out Big Whiteshell Lodge, here is the info:Big Whiteshell Lodge Ltd.General DeliveryRennie, Manitoba, Canada R0E 1R0Phone: (204) 348-7623Fax: (204) 348-3284Email: [email protected]"

Lime jigs and salted minnows is the ticket! Unfortunately when it gets hot it is hard to get a limit of under 16"" walleye as that is the slot limit."
524176,Bobby,2002-09-16 19:42:00,211,"Again, it is $180 for a boat for a day, and that's for a max of 3 guys. I went to Big Whiteshell in August and fishing was really tough for walleyes, rigging around the islands. However LOTS of algae in the lake, so the daytime bite was as good as the night bite. Some guy came to the launch at Big Whiteshell with a 27"" walleye. He told everyone he tried to revive it for about an hour after catching it but had no luck, so he said the ##### with it and was keeping it. I didn't see him, my fiance did. When she told me, we'd already left the launch. That fish was in the protected slot - I would have called TIPS if I'd have seen him or got a plate number.Lastly, a fellow who works at Fishing Hole in Wpg caught a 47"" Pike in nearby Dorothy Lake the same weekend, cranking down deep for walleyes."

The slot size for walleye is 18"" and under so have fun. Give Big Whiteshell Lodge a call if you are looking for a place to stay for great fishing. You can call them Toll Free at 866-892-2929 to book a cabin or a boat for fishing. Their boats go for $125/day plus gas. Max 3 guys to a boat. Have FUN !!"

He will pick you up in Big Whiteshell, take you across the lake, drive you into Crowduck, show you where to fish in the lake and provide boats and motors on Crowduck. I believe that in 2016 you can keep 2 walleye in Crowduck. You can't compare fishing on Big Whiteshell with fishing in Crowduck. From 60 years experience."
