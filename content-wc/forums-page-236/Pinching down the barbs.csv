4751018,Pooch,2016-04-19 09:50:00,4619,"I take my plastic worms that are torn up and cut them into small cross sections and use them behind the live bait to keep the live bait on the hook. Has worked well for twenty years now.Ten years ago I bought a package of cheap bright solid colored plastic worms and use them most of the time for my ""keepers"". I think using a bright colored small piece of plastic to hold a leech or minnow on barbless hooks is actually an attracter. Before a trip I cut up a bunch of various colors and put them in a tiny plastic bag so I don't have to be butchering plastic instead of fishing. A cross section of a plastic worm cut to about 1/8 inch works perfect. Half or quarter that if you are using a tiny plain hook and leech.I thought this is what everyone did?Pooch"

4754066,daver6322,2016-04-20 07:38:00,2,"No downside to crimped barbs. Easy on the fish, fishermen, clothes, equipment, Been doing it for years on Lake St. Joseph."
4759914,lassh,2016-04-21 14:46:00,553,Camp Chef- How bad does that gulp taste? Its pretty nasty on cuts on the hands. Does it hold on hook better than standard plastics cut into keepers? Just wonderin.
4761906,camp chef,2016-04-22 07:48:00,915,LOL.....It doesn't taste terrible....I don't think it works any better than any other plastics. It just happens to be what we usually have handy. You could use a knife or scissors if you are more civilized that I am.
4764130,lassh,2016-04-22 19:48:00,553,I doubt I'm more civilized. I bitten worse things than gulp. Ozzie O.

4766274,pike50plus,2016-04-23 19:22:00,584,on most lures that can be switched without too much action change.
4741306,spoonchucker,2016-04-16 05:50:00,82,"Our group fishes not only pinched barbs, but one single hook on all lures, no trebles. The only exception is on a long minnow hard bait, like a rapala is to use two single hooks for balance, and the lure may not run right even then so we lean toward spoons, in line spinners with single hook tails, and jigs/ swimbaits, Do not feel we lose any fish because of it and makes release of fish and de hooking fishermen easy."
4741410,new hips,2016-04-16 06:30:00,498,"Single pinched barb on all spoons a must. keep the fish in the water and with a simple twist with a 12in needle nose.......no harm done. I have never noticed missing a fish, I guess if I was on a lake that you only get a few hits a day, I might rethink it. I fish lakes that usually average 20+ Northern a day and 50+ walleye a day......so mortality is the most important factor. Learn how to handle your fish, for future generations."
4741562,acplumber,2016-04-16 06:56:00,80,Thx for all of the replysI think I will be pinching down the barbs on most of my lures. Probly just the ones that will be my go to lures. Not the other 150 that'll barely get touched. Camp chef u had said u don't pinch em on the jigs. Just wondering why? We will spending half our time with jigs with either twister tail or worms. Do u find the worms don't stay on as well? Might be getting some minnows too....
4741610,Ruddiger,2016-04-16 07:06:00,649,"Howdy, I have done it on all my fly-in lures for over 20 years. Do you lose more fish? Yes, but not a lot more. The bard is there for a reason and it does work. If your on a lake where losing a fish here and there is not a bid deal, go for it! If your muskie fishing for days and struggling to find a fish I would recommend against it (don't ask me how I know). Take care, Ruddiger"
4747370,Aaron-IN,2016-04-18 12:54:00,500,"I sunk a treble hook deep into my index finger last year (first time in 38 years) releasing a smallmouth, I will be pinching the barbs down on all of mine from now on."
4747386,camp chef,2016-04-18 12:58:00,915,Probably should pinch down the jigs too. We just don't find them as dangerous or as much of a mess in the net as the treble hook and multiple treble hook lures. The barb does help keep the bait on while jigging.
4747514,bthomas3333,2016-04-18 13:38:00,465,Same with me. After 30+ years I did the same thing. Caught a Pike with a crank with 3 trebles and one treble wound up in my pinkie finger and it wound up 85% of the way through wrapped around the bone right down to the shank.Net/Net - Other than the obvious fun of now having to cut the hook from the treble while through my finger and pushing it the rest of the way through...I now can't feel anything with my pinkie below the injury. Dr said permanent nerve damage. Obviously not a big deal with a pinkie finger but if it was an index finger...I still fish with trebles but I push the barb down on all my lures. I also am not a huge fan of removing barbs from jigs. I guess the trebles are normally catching Smallies or Pike. Neither one is that big of deal. Jigs / Walleyes and only one hook to manage.
4747530,stjoeguy,2016-04-18 13:48:00,979,"Camp Chef brought up a good point about barbs keeping the bait on. I use barbless jigs and Gulp or plastic tails and rely on the keepers by the jig head to keep the tail on. Live, frozen or salted bait is more difficult to keep on a barbless jig. You might want to look at a product like bait buttons to help keep the bait on the jig. I've also heard of cutting up twister tails or other plastic to make your own buttons."
4747970,camp chef,2016-04-18 15:43:00,915,we bite off little pieces of gulp as keepers for the minnows or crawlers on the jig but you really need the barb to keep the keepers on too.
4748530,3M TA3,2016-04-18 18:43:00,2846,I guess a pinched down barb would be far less painful in this situation.
4738322,acplumber,2016-04-15 07:05:00,80,"Do you guys end up pitching down the barbs on your hooks? We are going on a fly in, and had a meeting last night. And the topic came up about fishing hooks stuck inside your hand. Which made me think since we are so far away from anything I'm just wondering is it worth it? Do you find that you lose more fish? Or does it make any difference at all?"
4738370,wallydave,2016-04-15 07:12:00,2151,Crimping the barbs is good for the fish and fishermen. Take the middle hooks of your stick baits too. Less chance of getting hooked when releasing fish. Safety means you can keep fishing!
4738386,acplumber,2016-04-15 07:14:00,80,Thanks Dave Did you find that you lost more fish?
4738418,stjoeguy,2016-04-15 07:17:00,979,"The lake we fish requires barbless hooks. We might occasionally lose a fish that we wouldn't lose with a barb, but it really has never been an issue. The occasional lost fish is worth it, however. You'll probably be catching so many fish that you'll enjoy how easy it is to remove the hook, release the fish, and go after another. Easier hook removal from a hand would be an added bonus."
4738442,GBS,2016-04-15 07:23:00,2271,"While I don't do it routinely, a quite high percentage of my hooks are ""barbless"" from trips to places that mandate their use. In all kinds of fishing, I can't say that I have lost any due to not having the barb. Just have to make sure to always maintain some kind of pressure on the line when playing the fish - never let it go slack. But that is true no matter what. And it is far easier to unhook a fish (or myself) with less damage. I've also moved to using circle hooks wherever possible. Far less ""gut hooking""."
4738466,wallydave,2016-04-15 07:30:00,2151,"As far as loosing fish goes, you will probably loose a couple, but most of the time it's a catch and release situation any way. It's known as a remote catch and release! Besides the ""big one that got away"" stories can begin!"
4738850,camp chef,2016-04-15 08:46:00,915,We pinch down all the hooks on our stick baits and spoons.........Not so much on the jigs
4739266,jfaisten,2016-04-15 10:45:00,1060,"Pinch them down, you'll never know how many fish you lose because of it. Makes no difference in my mind -- much easier on the fish you release and very good if you get a hook embedded in your person. Be sure to bring along a good pair of wire cutters -- you'll need them to get a hook out of your hand or elsewhereGood luck"
4739418,ziggyzag,2016-04-15 11:38:00,125,"I know this thread is about pinching down barbs on hooks which I agree to, but I think everyone should take a good look at how you remove a hook into one self. The thought of pushing a hook thu and cutting off the barb to remove is so wrong or cutting it out is just wrong. To remove a hook in one's hand take a piece of fishing line placed under the hook as you hold down the shank against your hand and have someone holding the two ends of the fishing line give it a quick and firm pull this will remove the hook with barbs or not no pain no blood and no ripped skin. this is a brief description but I am sure you can find more on line with visual aids on this I watch it on tv on some fishing show years ago and have used it a few time on myself and others and it works great. All fishermen and women should check it out and teach your young and up coming fishermen this simple and effective method. WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4740586,Bill Krejca,2016-04-15 19:06:00,6107,"No significant difference noticed in lost fish. Sure make for quick release on netted fish, they almost unhook themselves in the net after landing. Bill"
