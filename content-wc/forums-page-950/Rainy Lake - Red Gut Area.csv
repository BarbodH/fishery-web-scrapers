This is our 4th trip to Rainy and the 2nd to the Red Gut area (east arm). Appreciate any info. This lake is a great fisherie. Thanks in advance!:)"

In Baseline, Three Sisters reef is a good place to start, also the reefs off of Smith's (aka Airplane) island all have fish. Fish should still be hanging in the Red Pine Narrows area. In Red Gut the Gull island area is good as well as the mainchannel point as you approach the narrows into porters inlet. Look for fish down to 40 feet in all areas. Also, try main channel points with deep water adjacent to large bays. Smallmouth are going crazy right now. Should still be good in couple of weeks. Get a good map with the reefs marked. A good rule-of-thumb for Rainy in mid-summer is fish early and after 5 pm if the sky is clear. On cloudy days the fish can be had allday. TGG PS: I hope you don't mind the train running through camp at 2 - 3 - 4 -5 am."

521228,Guest,2002-06-11 06:58:00,0,While you are up there stop by and see my good buddy Ed Taylor at Taylors Cove just south of the Fisheries on Bear Pass. He's just renovated the entire place. Your vacation will then be trainless. TGG
521229,Guest,2002-06-11 12:07:00,0,"Great Guide - thanks, we'll check out Taylors when we get there. In the mean time, any (new) news on fishing conditions in Red Gut will still be appreciated. Also, do you fish the Canadian Bass Championship?"
