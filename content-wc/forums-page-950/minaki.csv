520833,Guest,2002-06-09 22:35:00,0,"got back friday from paradise cove. the water was six feet down. 5 boats from paradise were already damaged, be careful. the walleye bite was very slow. jig and a minnow or leach. people were casting jigs and a minnow in big sand toward the banks and having luck. people went to the dalles in the morning for shore lunch and fished spots in between, eventually ending up in big sand. the weather was decent so the next couple of days the walleye bite is going to take off. water temps were rising."
520821,brian1785,2002-06-01 08:22:00,1534,Thank you sir. I'll give you a call when we get up there to finalize meeting places and such. Thanks again.PS Youre only as old as you act!
520822,DonC,2002-06-02 08:48:00,93,"Just got back yesterday from Minaki. The first 2 days was tough. As the temperatures improved, so did the fishing. The last 2 days were great for smallmouth. The walleye were still 20 to 34 feet, but we were also catching them shallow on tubes, diving crankbaits and minnows. A few muskie were caught in our group, and the pike were all over the place. Couldn't keep them off our lures. I stay at Birch Island Resort. The largest walleye being caught were around 28 inches, down from the 30 inchers we caught last year with the high water. The water levels are slightly down, and there is very little current.Good luck to all those going soon,Don"
520823,Keith,2002-06-02 16:29:00,48,Were the fish in all the classic spots on little sand?

520824,DonC,2002-06-02 17:01:00,93,"Yes, they were where they usually are.Don"
520826,DonC,2002-06-02 17:05:00,93,"Minaki lodge was sold. What is going to happen to it is questionable. If you are referring to any other lodge, then I have no information. Don"

520828,Guest,2002-06-03 14:08:00,0,Don What was the road like from Kenora to Minaki? A couple of years ago they were working the road and I got a lot of chips on my boat. Where are some of the usual places on Little Sand ? Hay Jeeps are you getting ready. I can already taste those walleyes. geo.
520829,DonC,2002-06-03 14:18:00,93,"Minnow, the road is finished and is smooth all the way.Good fishing,Don"

520812,Reels,2002-05-29 06:02:00,2876,I leave Friday morning. Cant wait. Watching the clock go tick tick tick....<{{}}><
520813,brian1785,2002-05-29 08:35:00,1534,I leave on the 14th of June. Wish someone could point us in the right direction as far as patterns and maybe a location or two for walleye. Thanks everyone.
520814,illinijeeps,2002-05-29 18:43:00,5,"just go to gun lake and fish points use the old stand by jigs and leeches. or go up to big sand, they say to pull reef runners for big eyes. where are you staying???"
520815,brian1785,2002-05-30 06:35:00,1534,"We are staying at Northstar Village. Have you fished Big Sand before? If so, where do they usually pull cranks? Thanks!"
520816,Reels,2002-05-30 06:45:00,2876,"I dont think the eyes will be suspended in Big Sand that early. It's easy to see were they are either outside Green or the East end by the elephant humps. Just cruize until you see the big arches suspended down 10-20'. Then pull #7 or #9 Shadraps depending on the depth. Clown or perch seems to work good.I think though when your going, the bulk of the active fish will be on little sand, or down in Gun. The fish seem to run smaller in Gun. Try spots like wildedge, rasberry, whiskey, or burnt island. Jig if they are a tough bite, pull a spinner if they are active. Hammered bronze #4 blade is my favorite for this system.<{{}}><"
520817,Guest,2002-05-30 19:58:00,0,reels where is wildedge?? i know where the rest of those places are but that one doesnt ring a bell . its a never ending place to fish we try new places every year . it just keeps getting better and better. bill
