521206,Guest,2002-06-08 21:29:00,0,Going to LaRounge in three days and am a avid jig fisherman for walleyes. Don't get me wrong nothing wrong with live bait but at the same time I love to catch them on jig with artificals. Been told by many people that because of the late ice out that the walleys will not like to artifical biats and will have to use live bait. I think a jig tipped with a artifical will work but they tell me no. Back here in Nebraska when the walleyes are on the slow bite in colder water I can get them to hit jigs when most say that this is not so but I am sure that the water temp is going to be cooler up there. What do you think? To jig or not to jig that is the question? Do you think that light jigs will produce??

My early spring favorite has always been a 1/16 ounce yellow jig with a small yellow Berekly Power Grub and a night crawler. The bite is often very, very soft at this time of year and an extemely slow presentation seems to work best. I'll cast out and retreive in 6"" - 12"" increments, allowing 15 -20 seconds between each short pop of the rod. For trolling I use long(3-4"") slim crankbaits in a variety of colors, but for me jigging has always produced better in the cold water in that area."

We mustly slow trolled back and forward and pumped the rod about every 3 seconds. Never got bit without without the worm. Caught only 10-20 per day, but fished with minnows on the last night for 2 hours and caught 20+ fish. Take minnows if you can!Tracy"
