I think it has a magnifiying glass.Click on it, and it asks you what keywords to search for, which boards to search in, and what field (author, title, etc.).Lastly, it asks how far back you want to go. While it does not say ""archives"" specifically, if you go back beyond the current pages, you will automatically be searching in the archives. You can go deep into the archives by going back a long way. But, these long searches take a while, and if you search very general terms, you will get alot of returns.Hope this helps.derrek.""Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get me."""
