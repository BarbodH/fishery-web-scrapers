If each of us can only take 40 ounces(1 liter) and this is the only alcohol we take, will we have a problem at the border?? Sounds silly I know but do NOT want any problems with our friends to the north."

521178,Guest,2002-06-10 07:52:00,0,"Guide 7 has it right on the mark: when they ask how much alcohol you have, claim 1.75 litres. You are allowed 2 litres (2 adults in the car). It doesn't matter that it is all in one bottle.In my experience, it is better to bring alcohol (wine and booze) into Canada and buy beer there--the beer is better, it is often difficult to find the specific brand of alcohol in out-of-the-way places in Canada (as it would be in the US), and the tax on the alcohol is not that high.Have a good trip. Catch and release on barbless hooks.Terry"
