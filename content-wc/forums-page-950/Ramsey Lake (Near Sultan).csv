520806,Guest,2002-05-31 06:38:00,0,hey jeff and tracy - my group used to go to Ray's Camps from way back in 1972 to about 1982. i have all kinds of details about the lake but haven't been there since '82. when ray first opened the lake (resevoir) he promised 100 pounds of pike a day or you stayed free. it would only take 10 fish to get there and almost always by lunch. things really changed in the late 70's. they took hugh nets full of walleye from bisco lake via helicopter and the pike population crashed shortly thereafter. they also let the lake level vary by 7-8 feet VERTICLE which makes spawning next to impossible. be glad to provide you with maps and our old hot spots mplus some additional historical perspective.bob kerr [email protected]
520807,Tracy,2002-05-31 20:03:00,376,"Thanks for the reply Bob, we leave in an hour 12:00 am local time 06-01! Guess I'll find out in 2 days where/how to fish there!Tracy"
520808,Guest,2002-06-03 06:57:00,0,"Fished Ramsey and Bisco for a couple of years. Bisco is dead, locals pull everything out. Ramsey is a good Walleye place. Most around 15-20 inches. Walk to the pike lake, it's worth the walk. 4 of us caught 55 in 3 hours, all clones thought, 25"". Pete and Thea have become money hungry over the years, too much Florida tennis. Won't go back anymore."
520809,Guest,2002-06-03 19:14:00,0,"TD- same here. We used to fish at Rays camps for 7 years but wouldn!t go back again if someone paid the bill for us. Pete & Thea have gotten to be poor hosts and as lodge owners, in our opinions "" STINK"". Last time we were there, guys were keeping fish in the slot size and he never said a thing. I think they are just riding it out hoping someone will buy them out or hopefully they will get too old and cranky and let someone else run it for them. Just our 2 cents worth."
520810,Tracy,2002-06-09 16:49:00,376,"TD, Fireman;I would not say they stink or that they are money hungry. I don't know where you can come up with the money hungry part, $397.00 per person on the full plan, all groceries included, is pretty cheap. The $6.00 a gallon for fuel might be questionable, but try hauling those 55 gallon drums from Bisco and up and over that portage! BTW gas was $3.75 a gallon US when we fueled up on 129. I guess for the hardship the $2.25 upcharge is reasonable.My only beefs would be that thet really were not forthcoming or helpful with where the best bite was, no one told us that the water was lake water and the musical boat thing was out of control. People tied their boat up where ever they wanted to when ever they came in. Other than that, I felt the trip was a great value and I thuroughly enjoyed my time there.I don't any help catching walleyes and we were able to find and catch them on our own, but every other lodge I have been to has steered us to the bays or bays that are productive. Rocky shorelines, points and drop offs was a little vague and who doesn't already know that. Pete and Paul were both nice and we saw them everyday. The new kid Jeff was good too. Only saw Thea when she was collecting the $$$ so can't comment there! Jeff is a 27 year old camp helper that guides for $25/person in the evening. He was pretty tuned into where the fish were biting and when. I went out with him on the last night and had my best day of the week in 3 hours. We caught and released over 30 walleyes. First timers would benefit from his knowledge of locations.Fishing was just OK! I caught close to 80 walleyes and 40 notherns all week, most of the eyes were in the slot. Had 1 walleye over, only saw 1other walleye over the slot all week. My biggest nothern was 27"", 3 guys claimed to have lost fish at or over 40"".If you are looking for a Canadian vacation where you can fish as opposed to Canadian Fishing vacation, this place is for you.Tracy"
