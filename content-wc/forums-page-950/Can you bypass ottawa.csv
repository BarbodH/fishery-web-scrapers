It has been a few years since I have gone this way and I was wondering if there is a route that we can take to bypass ottawa with out adding hours to the trip. Thanks, Rich"

(I think we got lost something like 5 years in a row) Go north on 416 until you reach 417. Go east on 417 until the Nicholas/Lee's Avenue exit. Keep right on to Lee's Ave. Turn left at the stop. Continue on Lee's until it becomes King Edward. Continue on King Edward north toward Hull and stay on Rt. 5 which will run into 105, north to Maniwaki. Nothing to it. Good luck and be sure to file a report."

There is a quicker alternative.Yes, take 417 East to the Nicholas exit and stay on Nicholas. Nicholas is a four lane highway heading towards King Edward and the speed is 80 kilometers/hour (50 mph). Turn right from Nicholas onto Besserer and go two blocks east to King Edward. Turn left on King Edward and continue on King Edward as you stated. Jay"
521317,Trophymuskie,2002-06-11 08:16:00,254,"Retire55 has it correct, Nicholas is a larger road with no stops or lights till you get to Laurier st. then like he says right on Besserer and by then there should be some signs indicating the route to Quebec.Hwy 416 is just outside of town and saves you from the BS of the old hwy 16 that became a small 30 MPH road for 15+ miles going through town.Only time you might encounter traffic is from 7 to 9 am and in late afternoon like after 3:30 and only on weekdays but thats only from 417 downtown on. You definatly want to avoid it in the morning thats for sure.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
521318,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-11 08:47:00,618,"Thanks guys, there seems to be quite a few less turns than I remember. This sounds like I can avoid the older section of town with the tiny road signs and narrow streets. T-stick, I too have done some sight seeing years ago (OK we got lost lol). Thanks again, Rich"
