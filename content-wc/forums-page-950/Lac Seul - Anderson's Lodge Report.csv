Simply cannot say enough good things about the folks at Anderson's....first class accomodations, food and service all the way. As for fishing, it was very good. Good walleye and northern action each day, with the last three days of our trip yielding high numbers of both species. No giant Northern's but several in the 33 - 37"" bracket. Generally good size on the walleyes with several above the slot and one 28 1/2"" (pictured and proudly released). Not having fished the area before, the guides were especially helpful. Caught fish all over the lake but had the best numbers in the north end which required a long boat ride from our launch, but well worth the trip. Walleyes were caught primarily on jigs tipped w/ minnows (8-15 feet of water). Caught several northern's on this same method plus had success using spoons. Weather was perfect all week...low of around 40F and highs in the 60-65F range. All in all, many great memories to tide us over till our next trip."
