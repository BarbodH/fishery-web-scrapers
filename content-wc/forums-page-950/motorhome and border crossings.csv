521320,Planocat,2002-06-11 06:24:00,473,"I'll be crossing same site on Sunday. Pretty urpredictable, but I would allow 1-2 hours extra in travel time. We have been checked thoroughly the last 2 years, although they didn't go through the boat last year, only the motorhome.My brother crossed on last Saturday without any holdup or problems, but I would think that, in this day and age, that would be the exception.It really doen't bother us to be checked. I realize they are only doing their job and, for the most part, are very courteous. Over the last 15 years we have encountered all different types. A few years back we had a young gal who insisted that we ""estimate"" the number of gallons in our built in tank (52 gal.) and pay duty on that gas! That was a first. Just go with the flow, be legal, and consider it part of the priviledge of enjoying their beautiful country. No matter how long it takes, it is worth it. Planocat"
521321,Behle,2002-06-11 13:37:00,51,Our group of eight will be crossing June the 22nd early in the morning. Last year we were stopped and everything was checked. It seemed that any motor home was going to get checked that morning as two others got the same treatment. We were back on the road in about 45 minutes.We were checked less thoroughly one other time when we had a motor home and trailor for eight people. With exception of a few cans of beer that were lost when the lady inspecting stepped on the beer as she was wading into the trailor to look around we had no problems.We also cross at Pigeon River.
