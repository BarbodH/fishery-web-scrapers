I'm planning one of the most important trips of my life- since I'm taking my son on his first trip to Canada.I hope it becomes one of those memorable experiences for us. We chose a new area, in part of Ontario I have never visited. I asked a few questions and WOW, what wonderful folks.One member, AL actually took time out of his schedule to mail me a map indicating where & how to fish this particular piece of water- as per his experience (ours may be different I know)- No charge- just a fisherman trying to help others enjoy the sport. He provided excellent details about fish, structure and safety. WW sent me several emails with excellent details from his experience. And I also got mail from John (can't remember his board name) that was great information. Thanks to all.My point is that true sportsmen and women enjoy a kinship that we should value. This board makes that possible so thanks Walleye Central.I'm looking forward to the opportunity to return the favors and as importantly demonstrate to my son, the joy of fishing."

521189,Guest,2002-06-08 16:39:00,0,"Wisconeye, I echo your words about the help that is provided on this board. My Dad and I go to Ontario just 2 weeks a year to fish for walleye and pike. Those 2 weeks are the best 2 weeks of the entire year because I get to go with my Dad. When we come back we are allready planning for the next trip. And most of the information that we gather about techniques for catching walleye and pike are provided by the great folks on this board. THANKYOU everyone for making a father and son fishing trip to a very special place that much more sucessful. 13 more weeks!!! Gofish"

521191,Guest,2002-06-09 05:54:00,0,"I couldn`t agree more. Our family has fished the same lake near Kenora each year for over 45 years(Dad discovered it) and through this board we found others that had fished it also. Now we thought we knew everything there was to know about that lake but one gentleman took the time to tell us about his secret honey hole. It definitely produced, catching a seven pounder on the first pass. We respected his information and returned that and most of the other fish caught(kept a couple small ones). Its nice to see that there are people out there who are that unselfish as the trend seems to be the other way. That was the way my Dad was-he couldn`t keep a secret. It wasn`t until later that I learned you might discover twice as many secrets as you give up when you share information. Kord"

So last year we started going up for 2 weeks and that is much better. The lodge we go to is Lost Lake Wilderness Lodge located between Elk Lake and Gowganda, Ontario. They have 10 different lakes to fish and with 2 weeks we can fish all 10 if we want to. Who knows, next year we might start going for 3 weeks!!! There's no such thing as too much time to fish. Gofish"
