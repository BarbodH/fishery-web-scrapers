Any suggestions as far as which lures and presentations might best apply for this water at this time of year? We'll have the benefit of a guide but I'd appreciate help in determining which of my lures, rods and reels, etc. I should pack for this trip. Thanks, in advance, for any assistance."

Lake of the woods and a lot of moving water and fishing between islands were the water is moving seem to attract fish. A popular guide up there is Alan Meline at http://www.melinesresort.com/ check him out.

I'd recommend slow trolling or drifting spinner rigs with minnows or crawlers and hammered gold or hammered silver spinners. Trolling plugs (shad raps, walleye divers, etc.) should also be effective. Heading up there myself on Saturday. Please post a message on how you do if you get a chance. Good luck."

Rocks are key , walleyes are not in flats yet, only saugers.We got limits 9 lbs largest mostly 2 lbs fish . Walleye are in main lake areas 40 ft deep, find that you will find eyes."
