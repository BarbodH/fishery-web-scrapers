In our state (NY) there is a lesser offense: Driving While Ability Impaired (DWAI) which is issued to offenders with borderline blood alcohol readings and no previous record of driving under the influence and is considered a misdemeanor. I can only assume that there is a similar law in other states. Can anyone tell me if a DWAI offense is treated as seriously by the Canadians and does it jeoprodize one's chance to successfully enter Canada? As a post script...I was convicted of a DWAI about nine years ago and another member of our party had a similar encounter about fifteen years ago. We have successfully crossed the border at least twice a year for the past twenty years (most recently in May, 2002 and late Sept.2001). The question of driving convictions has never come up. Should we anticipate problems?"
