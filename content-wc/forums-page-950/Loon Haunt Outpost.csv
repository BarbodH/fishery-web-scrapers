521221,WillieB,2002-06-10 13:20:00,292,"No, but I've good friends who have. Loon Haunt was on my short list this year, ended up booking Aug 15th-24th with Bill Paryniuk and Jubilee Outposts out of Red Lake.I think Cherrington is supposed to be one of Loon Haunts best, and a great catch and release/consume policy sounds like it'll stay that way. Watch out for the ultra-clear water!! Stay to the shadows or do some trolling (or a nap if you're doing some night fishing) when the sun is high overhead. Pinch down your trebles or go barbless, you'll be getting into some BIG northerns and those gang trebles really tear them up.My buddies said the only ""odd"" thing was the old/new growth line of trees, seems they had a h3ll of a fire thru that whole area back in the mid 80s.Let me know how it goes!!"
