540085,MrEyes,2004-05-29 07:25:00,360,"Shoe, I just got back from Lac Seul last night. Travel between Fort F. and Dryden was good going up (because we went threw on Saturday morning. However we came back on Friday afternoon and there is about 6-8 different spots that are being worked on and traffic goes down to 1 lane. We drove most of the way up (Souteastern WI) and stayed in Superior. I would advise you not to go that route on construction days. Mark"

It was a disaster. The weather and the fishing I mean. It rained every day. The high temperature was about 45 degrees. Oh, and windy usually too. The water was REALLY high. I heard on the TV that this has been the 3rd coldest May in Manitoba recorded history. I kept 5 small Walleyes (the biggest was just over 14). I did catch 4 nice Northern but they were too big to keep (29 ½, 30, 32 and nice and fat that had a good-sized northern sticking out of its mouth) and one 35. All of the large Northern were caught while Walleye fishing. No large Northern were caught while casting. The water temperature was mostly in the upper 40's to low 50's. Last year it was in the mid-60's. The roads were for the most part good. The second 25% or so on 502 was kind of rough. They were just starting to do some roadwork as you got onto 502 south bound up near Dryden. There still is a detour on 53 in Duluth. If you follow the signs you will be ok. 53 South out of International Falls was just about as rough as the 502 part. I don't recall 53 North bound near International Falls being bad. Gas prices were lowest in MN as usual. It jumped a few cents while we were gone. It's about 207.9-209.9 there now. The lowest we saw on the way back was just South of International Falls about 10-15 miles on the East side of the road. It was 203.9. We didn't have to buy gas in Canada but we were told it was much higher there. Bob/ .Just before we left I ordered a new MCC mapping card for my fish finder/GPS. It is AWESOME. It shows all of Northern Ontario. It showed all the small islands/rivers/land for the lake we are on. I looked and it shows Lac Seul GREAT too. You can't get lost with this mapping now. I don't recall what brand electronics you have on your boat but if you want to see mine before you go give me a call (826-6042) and you could run out and take a look. The map is ordered directly from Lowrance/LEI and was $99. I ordered it second day air for $15 more plus the standard $9 shipping/handling. So, all in all it was a good trip except for the fishing and the weather. The truck/boat/motor/electronics/trolling motor worked great. I am already looking forward to next year. Good Luck to you all and I hope the weather/fishing is better than we had."
