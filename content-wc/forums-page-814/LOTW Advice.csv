539892,Renn,2004-05-24 17:11:00,87,"FARVE4, Thanks for the ideas on the walleyes. We will probably chase a crappie or two as well. Any advice on locations and/or presentations for them? Thanks again."
540005,Guest,2004-05-26 21:46:00,0,"CRAPPIES CAN BE SHALLOW, BUT I HEAR WATER TEMP IS 50 DEGREES SO THEY MIGHT BE STAGGING IN DEEP WATER . CHECK IN SHALLOWS 1ST 3-4 FT , IF NOT THERE GO DEEP, 30FT-25FT. I CANT TELL UNTIL WE GET THERE THIS SATURDAY, ITS A CRAP SHOOT WITH COOOL WATER TEMP. THE GOOD THING IS WE ALWAYS CAN LOCATE THEM IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BY SEEING WHAT WATER TEMP IS. THEY ARE ALWAYS DEEP OR SHALLOW,BUT YOU NEED TO FISH KNOWN CRAPPIE SPOTS,ASK PRO ANGLERS BAIT IN NESTOR FALLS, HE WILL TELL YOU WHERE AT A LOCATION NEAR YOUR CAMP, HE IS UP TO DATE, HIS SON GUIDES.MINNOWS ONLY FOR CRAPPIE, WITH JIG IF DEEP AND IF SHALLOW ,BOBBER AND HOOK."
539670,Renn,2004-05-19 08:53:00,87,"I will be traveling to fish Sabaskong Bay for the first time the last week of May. I know this is going to be like pulling teeth, but if anyone has any advice on general locations and/or presentations for this time of the year I would greatly appreciate the help. Thanks in advance and I will let everyone know how we do when we get back. Renn"
539682,Dr888,2004-05-19 11:47:00,39,we haved fish the Nestor Falls area for walleyes at that time for many years and it almost always about the same type of bite.Use a 3/4 oz bottom bouncer 2 hook spinner rig baited with a live crawler or a power crawler with a gold #3 blade.The areas that holds the walleye are sand beach areas with new weed growth 3-10ft of water.If the weeds arent up try areas with large boulders in the same depths. good luck
539689,MTJ,2004-05-19 13:15:00,106,Where will you be launching out of? I could probably help if you are going out of Morson.
539692,Renn,2004-05-19 13:33:00,87,"MTJ, We will be staying in Nestor Falls but we would be willing to travel to the areas near Morson. Thanks, Renn"
539693,Guest,2004-05-19 13:47:00,0,Where are you staying in Nestor Falls? Will be up the week of May 28th as well. Have been fishing with Dr888 for a number of years and the spinner bite can be tremendous at this time.

539731,MTJ,2004-05-20 09:24:00,106,"Renn, I'm not real familiar with the area East of Morson. If you get into the Morson area I would try any sandy/rubble bay with a spinner and minnow or crawler. Once you get on fish change to a jig and minnow and work the area slowly. The area from Brule Island to Jackpine Bay is maily sand/rubble shoreline and has produced this time of year. Another area would be Dawson Island. I'll be up from the 28th till the 31st. Let me know if you would like more help. MTJ"
