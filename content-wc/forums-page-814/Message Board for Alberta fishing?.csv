539980,timeout,2004-05-26 12:19:00,28,"www.outdoormessageboard.com/ should take you to a host that has a fishing alberta message board. www.looneybeaver.com/forum/ has a manitoba board, with a small western canada section also. A strictly manitoba board is http://members3.boardhost.com/fishmanitoba/ From the manitoba sites there should be links in some posts to an extreme fishing site for northern manitoba that a ""northern manitoban"" has set up fairly recently. Good info on the manitoba sites, with only a few annoying personalities, that are easily ignored. Hope this helps"
