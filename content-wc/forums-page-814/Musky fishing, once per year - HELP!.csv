540001,Guest,2004-05-26 19:44:00,0,Are you fishing Big or Little Vermillion Lake? I've fished Little Vermillion for 25 years.... most productive lure has been a #5 blade Mepps with silver blade/ purple bucktail- You can throw this with light baitcasting tackle with no problem. Try the west end with the large cabbage flats where they contact big boulders! good luck ! JBP
540002,Guest,2004-05-26 20:44:00,0,"Big Lake Vermillion - this is where we are staying:http://www.countrycamping.net/index.html We were there last year, nice place - everything we needed, and real close to fishing...5 minute drive"
539901,Guest,2004-05-25 06:56:00,0,"Guys, I fish for musky one day per year, during our trip to the Lac Seul area. We camp on Lake Vermillion, and spend one day on there chasing musky around and going for smalleys. For about $50, can you please tell me if you'd suggest this rod/reel combo? As I said, I only do this one day per year, so I am not willing to spend $200-$300 on a get-up....http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll...677940973&rd=1 Thanks!"
539909,fishinnut,2004-05-25 07:50:00,642,"Sure it would work, but a broomstick and reel would too. I think casting that rod all day will wear you out. Try to find something in the 6'6"" - 7' range"
539916,Guest,2004-05-25 09:47:00,0,Thanks for the info......
539921,Guest,2004-05-25 12:36:00,0,"Anyone have any suggestions on line? I have done minimal research on it, and have come up with either PowerPro or SpiderLine (both braided) 30 or 50 pound test."
539922,Fred_G,2004-05-25 12:42:00,908,I would suggest Spiderwire Braid in 80 lbs test. Diameter is equivalent to about 20 lbs mono.
539954,Guest,2004-05-26 06:55:00,0,"For a rod, take a look at the Gander Mountain line of Gander Series rods in the 7' or so length, heavy or medium heavy. Or, check out Cabelas rods. They have one for about $40 or so which I have used for years. You can pick up used reels on e-bay pretty cheap. However, I would probably bite the bullet and get an Ambassaduer (sp?) 5500 C3 or 6500 C3. As far as line goes, I use the power pro in the 80 lb test and really like it. It seems the spiderline is very comparable. As the other post indicates, I would recommend the higher test line. They still have the lower diameter, but are generally easier to use. Good luck."
539979,rpieske,2004-05-26 11:50:00,1276,"Don't use an open face spinning reel for muskie fishing. You lose all control and will wear yourself out trying to cast heavy lures all day. Bite the bullet and get the Pete Maina combo from Bass Pro. It is about as inexpensive as you can reasonably expect for that type gear. PowerPro line in no less than 65 lb. test and get a Terminator Titanium leader to use. http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catal...&cmCat=3333406 There are some nice muskies in Lac Seul and it would break you heart to lose a really good fish with inferior equipment. Besides, this combo will last you for many years. I have been fishing muskies for over 50 years and I have learned the hard way. Get decent equipment....because what can go wrong usually will."
539982,timeout,2004-05-26 12:36:00,28,"as mentioned in other posts, bite the bullet and buy a decent level wind baitcaster. You can't go wrong with a 5500 or 6500 C3. Its a multi purpose reel for me. Mine gets used for cats,carp northern etc and they last forever with minimal care and they don't cost an arm and leg like the gasoline seems to. We use 50# spiderwire stealth and I have no hesitation in recommending that either. I'm pretty cheap myself and use cheap rods, but the reel is what matters to me. Has to have a smooth drag for the large fish. good luck"
539991,Guest,2004-05-26 14:17:00,0,"What type of walleye gear do you have? Planer board rods? Dipsey rods? What kind of reels? What size muskie baits do you plan on slinging? If you're going to throw medium-sized bucktails and minnow baits, you should be able to convert a 7-8' Medium action planer-board or 8-9' Medium Heavy dipsey rod into action. If you have a decent Abu Garcia baitcaster 5000 or 6000 series already, you're pretty much there. Add a spool of PowerPro and a good leader and you're there. Muskie rods and reels are made for long term use/abuse and larger, heavier lures, and if you had planned on taking up muskie fishing full-time, I wouldn't hesitate suggesting that you invest in a good rod and reel set-up. But..I've caught a lot of muskies on walleye baitcasting set-ups and have never lost a fish. Just be smart with your drag and don't horse the fish around. Also, stay away from heavy duty surf/spinning reel combos. Casting muskie baits all day, even for just one day, requires two hands on the rod handle, something difficult to do with a spinning set-up."
539993,Guest,2004-05-26 14:34:00,0,"Thanks for all the handy info. guys. I have already purchased the two rod/reel combos that I posted earlier on. I don't do musky fishing at all during the year, only the one day up in Canada on our week long trip. I currently have an ugly stick with shimano open face reel for walleye - medium action. I brought in a bunch of northern last year without breaking a line - 12 pound test. We chose to spend one day on Vermillion chasing musky, because we'll have steak to eat - no need to spend another day filling our boats with Walleye. So, I figured I better get something for musky, if I can get one on. I raised one last year trying for smallies, the biggest dang fish I have ever seen from my boat (I'd guess around the 50-55 inch mark, looked like a friggen log until I saw its eyes. He came up once right next to the boat, then our next pass on that point, he follwed my little rattling crank bait - it was awesome!). So I told myself, next time I go, I will have atleast a setup that might be able to get that fish in the boat. This rod/reel combo will work, I am going to get the spiderwire 50 or 80 pound test. Probably going to go get a few big Mepps bucktails, a few large crank baits and a few top-water baits as well, and some heavy duty steel leeters. As I mentioned, this is only one day per year, so I don't need to be spending a few hundred dollars.. Thanks again fellas! Happy fishing!"
