539853,Guest,2004-05-23 11:23:00,0,does anyone have any info. on this outfitter? He seems to have many outpost cabins available. anyone ever use this company? any feedback would be appreciated. thanks
539899,lobo1,2004-05-24 21:30:00,734,"A little pricey compared to some but you just won't find another one that is any better. Highly organized, state of the art - new cabins and equipment, cabins are on lakes that have seen little or no fishing pressure. We stopped going because I couldn't keep a group of 6 guys together. You need 6 guys to fly into most of his better camps. ""better"" to me means more likely to catch numerous trophy fish. ""better"" also means - departure on pressurized aircraft out of Thunder Bay - saving another day of driving (for us) to Pickle or Red lake departures. The other camps that he promotes that do not leave from T-Bay are excellent as well - you probly wont have any trouble getting 100 fish a day at any of them just might not land a trophy to get a picture of. I would go to any of his camps in a heartbeat. lobo1"
539900,Larry S,2004-05-25 06:23:00,666,"I second what lobo says,have been to moccasin trails several times,once out of Thunder bay ,and once from Red Lake.had a great time numbers and size wise both trips.As lobo said the only reason I don't go every year is that you need at least 6 guys to go to the best fishing camps.I go now out of Armstrong and do just as well,to camps which have virtually never been fished.Call Jack Rezny at Moc Trails he is always happy to talk fishing.You can't go wrong fishing with Moccasin Trails"
539929,Guest,2004-05-25 14:08:00,0,"thanks for the feedback guys. I talked with Jack Rezny. What lakes did you fish, and do you think the chance of a trophy is better at these lakes. How far north did you fly? do you need live bait? how were the cabins and boats? Should we plan an early June to fish the shallows? thanks Newcer"
539938,lobo1,2004-05-25 17:36:00,734,"I've been to Upturned Root and Obabika which are very nice camps. You can catch hundred fish a day here per person but never saw any really big fish - but what a riot tho! Excellent camps. We had a contest here and 17 fish on 17 consecutive casts took the prize. Average walleye was probly 16-18 inches and average pike probly 26-28"". We booked Kanuchuan two years back and missed it because the ice was not out. We like to get in as early as possible and catch the pike spawn if possible. We went to Favourable when he still offered it but that was discontinued for a variety of reasons, none of which was the fishing - which was great. Live bait would be a total waste of time, money and effort. White twisters on a gold metallic head for jigging and you are all set. For the pike - almost anything you have works great but we found the large Johnson silver minnows in a variety of colors with Uncle Josh muskie strips on them or some belly meat worked great. Only crank I took last time was a handful of Bomber Long A's in firetiger. wish I was going, lobo1 All new equipment every year // everything is top notch - nothing I would change. If you can swing a trip out of T-Bay I think any of them would produce multiple trophies. The two others that I went to have bigger fish too but chances at a trophy (pike over 40"" and walleye 25-26 +) would be reduced quite a bit."
539960,phishfearme,2004-05-26 08:17:00,1242,hey lobo - i've noted that excellent adventures (faron buckler) out of ear falls is now booking trips to upturned root and obabika. do you know if this is the same camp or are there two different camps on these lakes? we're considering these for next years. i'd love to hear more details from you. phish ([email protected])

Tom has been on his own ""cat lake outfitters"" and then with (still is) Mocassin Trails. I'm not sure what is going on"
540008,lobo1,2004-05-27 06:56:00,734,I'm 99.9% sure these are single camp lakes but still worth the question to the outfitter. Personnally I would not consider either if there were more than one camp on it. lobo1
540017,phishfearme,2004-05-27 10:00:00,1242,"yah - we like private lakes also. if you go to exc-adventures.com and click on ""outposts"" you'll see that faron is offering both obabika and upturned root as well as redpath. faron is an outstanding outfitter/pilot - maybe he's just handling the flying and advertising for these lakes now. lobo - please drop me an email at [email protected] - i'd like to discuss obabika with you if you don't mind. - phish"
