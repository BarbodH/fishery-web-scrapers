539928,Trailerguy,2004-05-25 13:59:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just got back last nite from working on the cottage roof. I fished several evenings, mostly in the 1st narrows. We mostly caught post spawn females, in the 18-22"" range. Also some nice smallies :). The spawn seems to have been slowed by the big snow fall the week before, as usually there would be post spawn males in the narrows about now. I didn't have a lot of time to spend fishing, but everybody I talked to had good luck. Guests at a couple camps I talked to were heading back on Thursday because they were limited out and tired of releasing fish. It sounded like large pike still were carrying eggs,,, go figure. I'm going back up with the wife Friday for the long weekend, and hope to spend it fishing."

I've heard that the water is still cold and things are about 1 to 2 weeks behind normal year, so it will be a finesse bie for us. Later, Mike"

As the weather warmed up, the fishing picked up tremendously. Caught some good lake trout in the falls on the north end, and tons of walley in the usual ""honey hole"" narrows between Gawley Bay and ""Mean Lake"". Also tried the falls on Wine Lake but didn't have any luck there at all. Water temps didn't seem to be warm enough yet for pikes in the bays. Water lever is about 2 to 3 feet above last year. The water rose at least 6"" just during the time we were there mostly due to all the snow melt."
