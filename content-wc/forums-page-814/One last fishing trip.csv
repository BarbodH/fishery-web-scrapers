540077,rpieske,2004-05-28 18:03:00,1276,"I had my last fishing trip with my Dad in 1987. We had started fishing Lake of the Woods in 1953. He taught me how to fish and turned me on to muskies. He was one **** of a fisherman, but even more important, one **** of a man. Now I'm the old fart and my son comes to LOTW to fish with me. He started coming up here with my Dad and me in 1985. He is now a great fisherman and a bigger muskie nut than I am. He just called me to tell me he is leaving Sunday to come up here and spend the week fishing with me. Life is good! He already has instructions to spread my ashes here in LOTW when my time comes. This is my 51st year on LOTW and my love of this area grows each year. None of us knows when our last fishing trip will be, but enjoy each one as though it were the last. Keep your lines tight!"
540094,fishnmagicin,2004-05-29 13:32:00,45,In my backyard or close to it. I live in northern ontario and everyday is a good day!!!! We've got almost every fresh water species up here!!!!!!!!!!
540098,Guest,2004-05-29 19:34:00,0,"I will be going up to LOTW in a couple of weeks with my father. We have been going on and off for the last twenty years. I had a stretch where I quit going (about 8 years) because I got married and money was tight. I have since decided to go since my father isn't getting any younger and has had Heart bypass surgery. So it makes me wonder how much longer he will be around and I say to #### with the cost and we will go every year. The times we have had fishing and hunting have been very memorable. We always have a good time whether we catch anything or not. Guys, cherish these times with your family enjoying the outdoors together because you never know how much more time you have left with them. Wingmann"

539997,Guest,2004-05-26 14:59:00,0,"I would fly in on a rented Lear jet and land at Walleye Flats Outpost Camp on Lake Cachabigun. I would spend every day in a 28"" Lund with my Guide Chief Wallyketcher. At the end of the day I would sit by a campfire drinking Canadian Mist on the rocks and telling the other guys in camp about the big one that got away. After my passing I would be cremated and have my ashes spread over the lake in one last effort to be part of the Lake forever."
539998,Ivy,2004-05-26 16:46:00,556,"The trip we took last year with my Dad. Dad passed away 3-17-04 He knew and so did we, that it was his last fishing trip. We did a Fly out with Kay-Air out of Ear Falls to a small lake. We were the only people on the lake. The where is important but takes a back seat to the time spent with your loved ones. Ivy I miss my Dad."
540012,Guest,2004-05-27 08:38:00,0,I would fish in Heather Locklear's fishing hole!
540029,Guest,2004-05-27 15:57:00,0,"I think the answer is best covered by Ivy perhaps. There are countless great lakes in Canada, regardless of your favorite species of fish to pursue. The question isn't where....it's with who. Good for you Ivy...you did it right. If I had once last trip(and that possibilty exists for all of us) I would be more selective of who than where. I never fished with my Dad, he died when I was pretty young......but what I would give to have had the chance."
540042,Guest,2004-05-27 21:10:00,0,"I would contact Rand Thomas at Canada Outfitters out of Kenora and fly out to one of their outposts. The cabins are not too rustic (actually they are nice) and the fishing is incredible. The trip was what we thought would be my dad's last fishing trip, and we experienced unbelievable fishing - 500-600 walleyes, many northern pike including one around 40"". Best of all, we got to spend time together (dad, older brother and me) on our ""own"" lake with no distractions. It was one #### of a way to spend father's day in 1999. We have been all over Ontario but that trip will always stand out. That was 5 years ago. This year we are headed to Lac Seul to continue the tradition and count our blesings that we are still able to fish together, even though our dad finds every snag in the lake. Good luck"
540053,Guest,2004-05-28 08:06:00,0,"I will be spending what might be my fathers last trip to Canada, (35 years of fishing trips to Canada) once again on Lac Seul. With my father, brother, and two sons, three generations will be fishing from a houseboat on Fathers Day! I not sure what else could ever compare with these upcoming seven days."
540064,Guest,2004-05-28 17:38:00,0,"Wow, my thoughts exactly guys. I only started going up to Canada a few years ago. Along with some buddies, I made sure my Dad started making the annual trip to Wabaskang lake. He's the reason I started fishing as a child, and so now it's my turn to take him fishing. He has a great time, and sometimes gets giddy just like a little kid. He'll be making the trip as long as he's able. As far as where, it would have to be Wabaskang, with friends, Dad, an ice cold beer, and a fine cigar after a great week of fishing. Sorry to hear about your Dad, Ivy."
