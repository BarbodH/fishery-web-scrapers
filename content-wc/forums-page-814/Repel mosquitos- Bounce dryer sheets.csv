539976,IaDave,2004-05-26 11:13:00,476,Anyone ever hung Bounce dryer sheets in your cabin for mosquitos? The guys I'm going with to a fly-in claim that it works but I'm still going to take a mosquito coil with me. I think one of the guy's wife read it in some stupid womens magazine.

539996,Guest,2004-05-26 14:47:00,0,I heard they help keep stupid people out of your boat too. Im buying some because they dont come any dumber than the guys I fish with.
540000,Pooch,2004-05-26 19:13:00,4619,We have used them for years when storing farm equipment away for the winter. One sheet in each piece of equipment works well and have not had any mouse problems since. Plus the cabs smell a lot better come spring. Don't know why but it sure seems to work. I think mosquitos could be a stretch though. Pooch
