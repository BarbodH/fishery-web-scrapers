Never tried the Cleo's but it looks like I will have to this summer! cm"

539850,Guest,2004-05-23 10:36:00,0,"Spoons are my #1 productive lure for Pike! Always have some in my Northern tackle box. I like the Cleo's but use the Cabela's Canadian Spoons as well as many others. Truth is I haven't found a really terrible spoon yet! Heavy spoons do not always perform in deeper water, especially at slow retrieve speeds so keep that in mind. I wish a single color worked but its dependent on water clarity and light, for example a bright silver usually performs well on overcast days but gold & brass can do the trick in sun light. Crank baits are my #2 productive lure for Pike. Usually variants of Rapala jointed DB-13, Shad Rap's, Walleye Divers, Hellbenders, Thundersticks, you should get the idea. Just cast them into the weed beds and slow your retrieve to where the lure is just bumping along the tops of the weeds. The same color phenomena applies here as bright colors for overcast days or stained water. Top water Floating Minnow's are my #3 productive lure but #1 for fun in catching fish. If I'm not trying to put fish in the box such as to take home or eat, you can count on a top water minnow tied on the end of my line. I love to watch big aggressive Pike explode on top water lures. Once in a while even a big walleye will rise and take a bite out of these too. Hope this helps."
539851,Guest,2004-05-23 11:12:00,0,I second the use of spoons. We fish a week every June for Pike and Trout and the Pike love spoons. 1oz dare devils and len thompson in red and white and 5 of diamonds are the best on the lake we fish. All need to have either brass or copper backs normally . We also use top raiders at times and black bunny jigs when they are on the bottom. Atlanta Dave
539852,Guest,2004-05-23 11:16:00,0,"suicks, bulldawgs, and some large bucktails or spinner baits. Use lures with high quality hooks and use high quality leaders if your going after the pigs or they will tear your gear up and send you home crying when you hook a fish of a lifetime and loose it from equipment failure. Don't forget about your line. Super braid type line in 65 to 80 is best. I use to think 20 pound mono was good enough, and it is if your fishing for 3 to 5 pounders. It sounds like you will be looking at bigger fish"

540009,lobo1,2004-05-27 07:17:00,734,"I like to have either spinner baits or johnson silver minnows for working the weed edges. I like something heavy for my casting reel - so I use a 1 oz white and red Len Thompson spoon or a huge suick (they call it perch color but looks like a walleye). My lighter rods usually have a firetiger Bomber Long A on them or a jig. Dont underestimate the jig for this time of year. I took all my musky baits for years but was consistantly outfished by the guys with the ""standard"" sized offerings. I cant resist bringing that suick but my other ""musky sized"" stuff stays home this time of year. Not to get into it with the other poster but I think them invisi-leaders are junk . Get yourself some high end steel leaders like the Sampo's that dont kink. There are some others that are REALLY nice made by Terminator but they are quite pricey. We used to take Uncle josh strips - and they are good - look for them in the ""musky strips"" they are longer. We switch to using belly meat or some walleye gut in place of the pork but that may be illegal. lobo1"
540021,Guest,2004-05-27 11:35:00,0,"Heading to Lac Seul this weekend and hoping to find the Northerns up shallow and agressive! We have had most success casting Little Cleos--gold or silver with orange, burgundy, hammered green or hammered blue. Size doesn't seem to matter. Also lots of fun casting and retrieving buzzbaits on the top of the water--it's a RUSH when the big Northerns slam a topwater on the retrieve!"
539659,Guest,2004-05-19 05:52:00,0,"Heading to God's Lake in northern Manitoba in 10 days and always struggle with what to take and what to leave home. Help me out with your personal 3 favorite lures for early season pike. This lake has huge pike and they are in the shallows now. Last year, they hit about anything and I had incredible luck with a simple, little cleo in double sided orange. I think it was any a 1/2 oz lure. My son was chucking all these huge lures and I was flinging my little spoon and doing just fine. Can't wait!"
539660,VMS,2004-05-19 06:20:00,1103,"I fish over by flin flon and the little cleo is our standard. I have about 30 of them that I bring along, and only use about 5 of them (go figure that one out...) THE must have color is what we call the minnesota cleo (Gold spoon with 1/2 maroon) I usually go through one a trip (wearing off the maroon paint). The 2/5oz size works really well for walleyes, and the 3/4oz is what we use for northerns. We also had good luck last year on the good old Red-eye in gold. Should be a fun trip!! Steve"
539662,rebelrn2001,2004-05-19 06:51:00,1563,"1) I like the Red Eye Silver but use the gold too. I usually change the hooks to put on a high quality one. You can go just about forever w/the better hooks as the OEM ones are cheap and will bend way too easily and aren't nearly as sharp. The better hooks stay sharp forever. 2) I also like a Rapala type bait at times. 3) Also, I use a spinner bait (tandum) once in a while. The size/weight depends on the depth. I run just above the bottom or just above/into the weeds. When I have to remove weeds too often from my lure it's time to go to a lighter lure. I don't rely as much on color as I do getting the lure presented correctly. I most often outfish my boating partners for pike. They are my favorite fish to catch. CAST AND RETRIEVE BABY!!!! ""BAM, ANOTHER ONE, IT'S A NICE ONE"""
539678,Guest,2004-05-19 10:38:00,0,"1. Husky Jerk, #13 color to match conditions 2. Johnson Silver Minnow, nickel or gold, bigger sizes, dressed with an Uncle Josh Bass Strip (yellow or white) 3. Zara Spook, black preferred but they all do the job. ""Invisi-leaders"" by South Bend, at least 10"" Erratic retrieves or speed trolling with the Husky Jerk (4 to 6 mph) It really works. It was an Al Lindner tip from one of his In-Fisherman days. You'll think you're moving too fast until you're digging a #13 HJ out of some 17 pounder's throat. When they're hitting and active, it's a good time to experiment. 1 1/2 oz (or bigger) jigs dressed with something bright and ugly is fun, too. Erratic is the key. Good luck."
539697,roscoe,2004-05-19 13:52:00,38,Another lure that I like to use and have had excellent luck with is a #5 Gold Mepps Spinner. I have had better luck with the ones that are not dressed. They are light and do not take a lot of room and I have caught many northerns with this lure. I also like the 5 of Diamonds and also the #9 Shad Rap.
539698,Guest,2004-05-19 13:57:00,0,"We were nailing the pike with deep diving, cray-fish painted, rattling, crank baits."

539708,Fred_G,2004-05-19 15:45:00,908,I only have one. Medium size (1/2 oz) Williams Wabler in hammered gold/silver. Works great.
539806,fourize,2004-05-21 15:39:00,287,I agree with Fred. Ya gotta have a bunch of Williams Wablers in your tackle box. I prefer just plain gold.
