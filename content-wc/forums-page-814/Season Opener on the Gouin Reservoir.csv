540010,McQ,2004-05-27 08:35:00,615,"Just got back from fishing the season opener on the Gouin Reservoir at Nemio River Outfitters. What a great trip, went in Saturday morning and the gravel road was as smooth as a super highway. Arrived just shortly after noon, had a quick bite of lunch and my partner headed out in a camp boat to fish the river. I stayed behind to get caught up with the camp owner on all the happenings since our last meeting at the Gatineau show. I did get to wet a line off the dock later in the afternoon and the walleye were there - put a 24"", 20"" and 18"" walleye towards the chef's request ""get some fresh filets for supper"". Gaston came back just a bit before 7 o'clock with his share of the pot and we managed to feed 11 people. Wish we could do the groceries every day as cheaply and with such ease. Sunday morning dawned bright and cold - major front and the fishing was slow all day for walleye, we managed to catch and release a couple of dozen of the big eyed critters but the pike made up for the lack of walleye bite with more than 20 coming to the boat on our small walleye baits. Monday was more of the same with the air temps just above freezing and a brisk wind out of the east. This was when I appreciated the location of the outfitter the most. The river offers up so much varied location that it was easy to find spots to fish without being blown all over the place. Not only that - the fishing was great too. We had our bait selection down to gold ""Hot n Tots"" and black/gold ""Fin S Fish"" 4"" minnows for jigging. The days catch yielded a limit of walleye for the evening meal and we managed to have a bit more fun with the cooperative Pike with a 42""er to anchor the string. Overnight the temps warmed and Tuesday was a shirt sleeve day, trolling and drifting lindy rigs with a float and nightcrawler was the key for active walleye. We fished areas that were necked down by islands with repeated success. By count the afternoon bite totalled 55 walleye and 32 Northerns and we were very busy with double headers a few times. We kept a limit of 8 walleye each to bring home. I can't say enough about the outfitter, we were treated to great hospitality. The other guests were friendly and having as much fun as we were. The location is excellent, the cabins are well appointed and very clean, the equipment is very well maintained and you can check out the listing in the business directory https://www.walleyecentral.com/phpyel...rs&textToFind= I've also added a few pics in my photo gallery https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=101219"
540018,retire55,2004-05-27 10:26:00,1029,Congrats McQ. Sounds like you had a great couple of days.
540019,Alces,2004-05-27 10:56:00,35,"Too busy to go and chat with you McQ, heard that my guys did see you and you were legal (lol), Opening was too much for us, we managed to reach all the area only the thursday before the opening day, we spend the better day of friday, saturday and sunday putting up the no fishing zone buoy on all the spawning area. On saturday the three patrol boats checked 147 anglers, which is very good considering the fact that the walleye just entered the spawning area and won't be out before at least 10 days. Fishing should be at his best by the beginning of june when all the spawning will be over and the fishes will go back in the main body of water. Will keep you posted on the succes situation"

540036,Alces,2004-05-27 19:19:00,35,"Atlanta Dave....how did you guess??????you must be a cop LOL. As a matter of fact I am the guy that brought McQ and their friends fishing last august when everything was pretty slow, as I remember we had some fivers and we played the game ""which color doesn't work today?"". McQ and friends had a, they called it this,"" memorable shore lunch"", saw a pack of wolfes and new places on the reservoir they didn't know existed. Hope you enjoy your trip up here, as I said on another thread, I will be there, I am always there Have fun and enjoy your stay!"
