5293682,1-shot,2017-01-26 12:20:00,35,"Just wanted to get some others opinions regarding the differences between Fly in's, Drive-in's, Train-in's.I try to get to Canada twice a year if possible. Our main group takes a trip in early June and ""fly in"" has not really been an option due to a couple people in the groups fear of flying in small planes. Does anyone out there experience the same dilemma and how do you handle it? A smaller group of us has taken a couple of august fly-in trips and the fishing was much better than the other options and opens up so many more possibilities. Also love having the solitude of being the only camp on a lake. The train-ins are nice but you lose a lot of fishing time with the way the train schedule works. Although I have not done any research to support, I would think that the 10+ hour drive to get to your destination is probably much more dangerous than a 1/2 hour flight to camp.Thoughts?"
5293754,bthomas3333,2017-01-26 12:56:00,465,I have dealt with a similar problem in the past. It kinda drives me nuts as I fly every week to work. Often times all the way across the country. Flying is a lot safer than driving but rational or irrational it is real to the person involved. In my case we just told the guy he could fly in or not go.You really have a couple of options. Do a remote boat-in which can offer good fishing and prevents the fear factor. Some really good options on LOTW or Red Lake. I also know a fly-in which can and has boated people in. Instead of a 35 mins float plane ride out of Red Lake it is a 90-120 minute boat ride all the way across Red Lake. Then a 30 min portage and another 45 min boat ride back across the lake to the lodge. Crazy IMO but to each his own. The real mess starts when you do those long boat runs in BAD weather. I know you can have float plane issues with weather but big water and long runs on the water is no treat either.I guess I don't know how far you want to travel but I would probably lean towards a remote boat in. As mentioned by Mike a few weeks ago there are some amazing fisheries in the far North of Sas and MB that can be driven to if you are up for a 2 day drive.Brett

Similar to boat props, they get damaged and brought back to spec. He has no issues flying but will not consider a fly-in trip because he has seen the props that come off some of the float planes. That's his reason and I respect that. We do a boat-in trip of about 7 miles. Your airspeed may vary."
5293890,MrSimon,2017-01-26 15:02:00,922,"First question: Difference between trip types? Personally, I find that as a general rule (there are exceptions), fly-ins are on another level than drive/train/boat. The fishing tends to be better, but the whole experience is just ratcheted up a notch. Second question: Dealing with guys who won't fly. I deal with this, but it's a price or time issue, not a fear issue. Since people are more important than fish, I plan most trips to accommodate the least common denominator. But every few years I put together a higher-end trip and just go with whoever can make it. It's a great compromise that works well."
