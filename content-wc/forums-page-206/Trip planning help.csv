5299866,mattm2632,2017-01-29 19:17:00,71,"Might have to work on the ""well behaved"" aspect.......Matt"
5299962,Aspencreek,2017-01-29 19:52:00,2911,"Oh my my, that is exactly what i was thinking, hahaha If it's just you and the wife, things have probably been decided how things work around the home/camp already. Good luck in your search! BTW, I started on these trips in 2000, never has my wife gone along. I have asked but she has no interest in going. But for me it's OK. This is my time with my son and brother and son-in-law. It used to be several others but they all decided to take their wives on different trips and now are not allowed to go without the wives. Fatal mistake on their part."
5300810,The tank,2017-01-30 08:10:00,340,I will second what Jared said about the morson area. I would add Milesbay camp but you have a central shower and most cabins have a outhouse. It's a little more pimative no hairdryer or coffee makers.
5301066,3 Z's,2017-01-30 09:54:00,133,"Witch Bay Camp gets my vote. My wife loves the place, hospitality is second to none. If you are flexible on your dates they have some very nice cabins with full baths and showers in them."
5298202,mattm2632,2017-01-29 00:54:00,71,"Guys,*I need some help with planning my first Canada fishing trip for mid to late August.* I started looking on the internet and am overwhelmed by the amount of choices.* I realize that most of the places have excellent fishing but I am looking for the following details:1. Dive in location no more than 2 hours from the MN border2. I would prefer to bring my boat and do not want to trailer it across miles and miles of gravel roads.* I figure some gravel road travel is probably necessary, but I would chose a location solely based on this if it had little to no gravel road travel.* 3. Nice accommodations with good friendly helpful hosts.*Is there anything else I should be thinking about or dos/do not?s that you would recommend for a first timer.* **I am up for any and all recommendations* Thanks, Matt"
5298218,Thompmd,2017-01-29 02:59:00,320,"Are you looking for American or Housekeeping and how about budget? I look here pretty frequently and don't see much about bad host but I'm sure there are a few and I think that sometimes is determined on how much attention a guest does/doesn't need. I'm pretty low mtce but I have seen a difference in hosts.I do housekeeping and bring my own boat so docks are pretty important to me(I have a fiberglass boat). I also like either a lodge that will allow you to eat an occasional meal(they generally like a day's notice).I like big water(LOTW) so the gravel road thing has never been an issue as I have been able to find tons of water and only had to run short distances.One thing I look for or ask about are ""extra's"" a resort offers and for me those are things like a nearby lake I can trailer to for a day, lakes they may have boats cached at or day fly in/out trips."
5298378,@Lunker,2017-01-29 06:26:00,835,"www.witchbay.com The ""camp road"" - 2 hours north of I Falls / Ft France's - is 7 miles of sand, gravel, and rock but you're not going to be traveling fast enough on it to damage your boat. Will take you about 45 - 50 minutes to travel that 7 miles. Everything up to the most expensive glass boats money can buy have been towed over that road into camp."
5298426,Obabikon,2017-01-29 06:39:00,2370,"Tough to beat the Morson area. If you're looking for American Plan... I suggest us at www.obabikon.com We are a boat in, but you can bring your own boat with no problems at all. Housekeeping...www.myliesplace.com - Justin does a fantastic job if you can get a cabinwww.buenavistaresort.com - an additional option in Morson. No gravel roads at all."
5298930,Bstar,2017-01-29 09:56:00,564,It sounds like Lake of the Woods fits your criteria. If your willing to travel 4-5 hours north of IFalls it would really open up a lot of options for you. Lac Seul has several drive in camps and all of them are on paved roads. And the walleye fishing is second to none but like LOTW it's big water. Just south of Lac Seul off of 105 is Cedar Lake which has a pretty good following on this forum.. A handful of camps to choose from there. Good luck with your search. It's all part of the fun. Since this will be your first trip this website might help you out http://www.ezbordercrossing.com/
5298938,bob888,2017-01-29 10:04:00,244,"Mylies Place out of Morson Ontario runs an outstanding resort. Excellent docks which is a plus as our group runs a pair of bass boats. Mylies books quickly as a lot of groups put there reservation in for the foth coming year. However there are openings in the early part of the season and more in August/September. The openings are are under ""Availability"" in the link below.http://www.myliesplaceresort.com/pag...mmodations.php Also their Facebook page adds additional information.https://www.facebook.com/myliesplace I've fished the lake once each a year and sometimes twice for twenty years. Lake of the Woods is just a fantastic lake to fish with a lot of opportunity to fish for Walleyes, Northern Pike, Musky and not least Small Mouth Bass."
5299042,NARDA 1,2017-01-29 10:53:00,636,"www.birchdalelodge.com Located on Eagle Lake about 130 miles North of International Falls MN with only about the last 2 miles being gravel road. Nice docks with a launch ramp for your boat. Fish for Walleye, Northern Pike, Smallmouth Bass, Lake Trout, Musky and Perch within a few minutes of the lodge. They offer an American Plan where you order off of a menu like a restaurant instead of everyone eating the same thing each night. There is also a grill your own steakhouse in the lodge for occasional meals. My group will be returning to Birch Dale Lodge in September for our 29th year there. Owners name is Marcel give him a call at 807-227-5262 he will take great care of you. Terry"
5299170,Aspencreek,2017-01-29 11:36:00,2911,"If you are limiting yourself to just a couple hours north of I Falls you may be limited to LOW or those waters. Lac Seul is 4-5hrs depending if you are going to go all the way to Ear Falls, but the roads are all paved. Camp roads can be an adventure so ask the questions when you start the booking process. We always do the housekeeping plan because I can cook along with some of the other guys that come along. And we eat really good!! Better than I tell my wife! TIP: Be sure to set with your group who is going to do what around the cabin, i.e. who will do the cooking, dishes, fetch beers, clean fish etc. I can get more specific but for that PM me. A trip where a couple guys decide they are not going to do anything can ruin a trip, they are not invited back. First things first, narrow your choices by budget and location and of course how some of your group feels about larger bodies of water vs smaller, experience with boating & navigation, and species trying to target. But start contacting camps NOW. The camps I go to book guests from year to year and do not attend the shows, because they don't have too, they are 80 to 90% booked from the previous year. Give yourself several choices, 6-8, then sit down with or give the rest of your group a couple days to a week to give their input. Since you are taking the lead, you get to proclaim yourself KING. Decide and get it booked. You may have some who will not agree, I always did, but if they don't like it they can book their own trip. Lastly, everybody says sure I'm in.......until they have to put a non-refundable deposit down to save their spot. DO THIS! It makes sure you are not scrambling for a replacement in July, and assures you that you are not going to get stuck, it happens, even with the best of friends."
5299482,mattm2632,2017-01-29 15:12:00,71,Thanks all for the help so far. It definitely gives me guidance. I should have added that it will just be the wife and I going. Don't know if that presents lodging issues?Matt
5299658,Bstar,2017-01-29 17:31:00,564,"My wife has gone with me on most of our trips to several different camps and there have been absolutely no issues. Now as we have gotten older the creature comforts have become more of a concern but most if not all drive in camps are going to have the basics like electricity, three piece bath in the cabin, wifi, etc. FWIW it seems like more and more wives are joining their husbands on their annual pilgrimages to Canada."
