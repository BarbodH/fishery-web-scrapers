5299138,Fishbuddy,2017-01-29 11:28:00,1,I am looking to fish Northern Ontario this fall. The past 3 years we have done the Kanipahow outposts around Chapleau but would like to find another quiet drive to fish camp with reasonably good fishing in the Chapleau/Wawa area? Any input would be appreciated.
