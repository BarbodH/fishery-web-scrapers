5285802,cozz3,2017-01-22 17:39:00,5,Hey Everyone - I'm a newbie to the site and appreciate all the great information people are willing to share! Located in central Ohio: My wife and kids have spent the last 4 years making the two day trip to a cabin near Longlac area to walleye fish but this year I'm looking for a fishing lodge a little closer. We are looking at the mid-late August time frame or early Sept might work as well. We usually take our 16' smokercraft and atv since wife and daughter enjoy hanging around the lake and cabins 1/2 the time riding and picking berries. Any recommendations on outfitters with good walleye fishing within a one day drive from central Ohio would be greatly appreciated. I was thinking somewhere within 6 hours of Sault Ste Marie or Toronto.

5286018,fsz,2017-01-22 20:30:00,144,"I just did the drive from Ohio to Longlac this past fall. I seem to recall it taking only 7 hours from the soo to longlac. But I was not pulling a boat trailer, and I have a 36 gallon tank on the f150 so minimal stopping. And perhaps your accomodations were west of longlac (I'd be interested in hearing your experiences in that area, I just went for the first time last fall and loved it) I've never been there but Happy Days camps on Lake windermere (chaplau) might fit the bill. Lots of reviews on this place here. I believe the owners are from ohio. They also have camps on prarie bee lake. The various lodges on lake kipawa in temiscaming quebec would meet your distance requirements, and the roads to kipawa are generally good enough to get that kind of boat in. Kipawa is known as a hard lake to fish at times, and you won't see many positive reviews here. You are not going to get 50-100 fish per person days there. But the area does have several outfitters to choose from (big lake) and there is decent fishing to be had. Google ""kipawa fishing forum"", there is a site the kipawa crowd uses. Many folks from ohio, pa, w ny fish that region, myself included ( I don't fish kipawa but rather fish at bush lakes in the area with no services/outfitters where getting a boat that size in would be hard)."
5286058,Rich B,2017-01-22 21:29:00,1081,"We live over in East Central Ohio and have fished a number of camps north of the Soo....with what you are looking for I would also suggest you check out Happy Day Lodge, as that camp may fit your needs: www.happydaylodge.com Another camp also worth checking out is Grand Falls Camp, Thessalon, Ont (ask for Mike or Paulette) and rent one of their cabins on Tunnel Lake, which has good walleye, SM Bass and Pike fishing.....they also have a number of cabins on Cummings lake which is located next to Tunnel, and offers very good SM Bass, Pike and Lake Trout fishing: www.grandfallscamp.com My family have stayed at and enjoyed both camps, and I have also gone up to both camps to fish with my buddies....both camps are clean and family oriented. Good luck with your search. Rich B"
5286298,Shellback,2017-01-23 06:02:00,8083,"I've been to Happy Days. Great camp for fishing, but didn't seem like a family place to me. Most groups kept to themselves, and didn't see any young children. Paquette's is on the same road but 11 miles closer to the blacktop. I'm booked at Paquette's 3rd week of July this year, I think it will be a better experience for my wife and I. A guy's fishing trip? Yes Happy Days. But a family vacation and fishing trip? Not so much."
5286866,MrSimon,2017-01-23 09:28:00,922,"I have some reports on Happy Day posted here ... look them up. Last time I was there, we rented their Honda ATVs and did some exploring. There were miles and miles of trails to ride with some really neat sand dune areas to play around in. I didn't see any berries, but wasn't looking for them either. If by kid friendly you mean playgrounds, swing sets, and merry-go-rounds, then no they don't have any of that. But they did have a basketball hoop and I think an in-door game room of some sort. But who takes their kids to a fishing camp in Ontario for playground equipment anyway. I would take my young kids to Happy Day with no problem whatsoever. It's a nice clean safe camp run by decent people. With all that said though, I think everything I just mentioned would apply to dozens and dozens of other camps also in your driving range."
5288682,north560,2017-01-24 08:25:00,53,"Check out Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge , 6 hours north west of Toronto. Lots of trails and bush road to run with atv's,good walleye fishing, lots of small mouth,pike and trout.At that time of year the berries should be good and almost no flies."
5294954,cozz3,2017-01-27 07:57:00,5,thanks again for all your help. Heading to Happy Day the first week of Sept. It's a big lake but plan to do a lot of research and plot out some waypoints before getting on the Lake. Looks like there is a lot of potential
5295298,MrSimon,2017-01-27 10:00:00,922,"I've been there that same week. Shoot me a PM if you want more info, I'd be happy to share."
5295874,Paul H,2017-01-27 15:34:00,1232,"I'll second this - Stayed there years ago a few times, but for 15 years I stayed at a more remote area within 10 miles of Gowganda. About 800 miles from Columbus. - give or take, I hauled everything from a canoe, canoe and trailer 16' Smokercraft to a 19' Lund over the years. I really love the area - pure Canadian Shield 0 decent to great fishing and ATV trails forever. The others mentioned Chapleau - about the same style area as well. Never fished it bit did a day trip there once."
