This was nice of them but not at all helpful for my cabin fever. Just got a new jig mold so I guess I'll spend some time pouring, painting and maybe adding glitter nail polish as has been suggested in another thread. Temps in the 50s next week so I might hit one of the local rivers that get good runs of steelhead and walleye. The big girls will be showing up soon."

( for the third time) Got the rods and reels oiled and cleaned and everything but the perishables for the Canadian trip already bought and packed. Another sports show this weekend and hope it doesn't get to cold from then on out. I,m ready but like all things, mother nature will just take her time. Be careful and good fishing"

So now gear stays in the garage until a week before I leave, but I still piddle around out there all the time."
