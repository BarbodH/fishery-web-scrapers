5261730,MN_Moose,2017-01-09 17:31:00,964,I used to come across a web page advertising a cabin for rent on the small island near Bald Island in French Narrows South of Andrew Bay LOTW. Does anyone recall what the name of the Island or Cabin web page is?
5261898,Dog,2017-01-09 19:04:00,210,That is Eagle Island. I have seen a website advertising there island cottage but don't recall what it was. Great area to fish Fred
5267457,MN_Moose,2017-01-12 19:31:00,964,Ha ha found it Fred Dog. This was my response to your post 12-12-14 looking for private island. This is in a very nice location near Andrews Bay and French Narrows. http://eagleislandfishing.com/ We must think alike.

5281674,jamesherbst,2017-01-20 12:49:00,12,"I think that cabin is run by the guys at Totem Resorts. If you look at their website, it's advertised as the ""French Portage Outpost"" cabin. I stayed there about 7 years ago with a group of 7 of us. The boats are fantastic; 17' Triumph boats with 50 hp, live wells, GPS, etc. Excellent walleye for size and numbers."
