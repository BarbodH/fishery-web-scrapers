5276474,The tank,2017-01-17 19:07:00,340,Haven't gone to a show in long time. Got to the st charles show on Saturday and it seemed to be very busy. Hope it worked out for all involved. Enjoyed meeting Jared from obabikon and talking with Matt from miles bay. Good luck on your next shows. Looking forward to see you both on the water.

Wasn't sure what to expect as far as crowds but, even on Sat morning, found it fairly easy to move around and chat with a few different camps. Booked a trip for Sept 2017 and about 95% sure I'll be putting a deposit down soon on a 2018 trip. Some very good camps to choose from and I'd like to hit several of them over the next 3-4 years."
5277010,Bstar,2017-01-18 06:03:00,564,I was there on Sunday and there were a fair amount of people there. Got to talk to Shaun from Echoing Lake Lodge. What a nice guy. He is definitely passionate about his new operation there and he was blown away by the amount of people that stopped by because they seen Mike Borger's trip report from last September. Also talked to the owners of Stormer Lake Lodge. They're really nice people except for being Packer fans! Lol. Their camp looks great. These two camps are definitely on my radar for the future. Sorry Jared I didn't' get to talk to you as your booth seemed quite busy when we went by. Hope you booked a lot of trips.
