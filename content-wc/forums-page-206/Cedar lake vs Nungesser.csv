5276546,SWM08,2017-01-17 19:43:00,10,This is my first post on WC and want to thank you all for making this a very interesting site. I am considering booking a week at Northern Lights on cedar late August or early September and was wondering if any of you have fished both cedar and Nungesser for walleyes and how they compare . Thanks

If you want solid multi-species and great lodge experiences, Cedar is the way to go. I've stayed at Northern Lights and agree with Prov1800 that it is excellent."

5278329,SWM08,2017-01-18 19:34:00,10,"The boat traffic on Nungesser isn't bad at all. Haven't been to cedar yet. My last trip to Nungesser was 2010 for a three day solo trip and caught approximately 200 walleyes in the three days but fished pretty hard 10 to 12 hours a day. The reason I'm interested in going to cedar is because two guys in my group would love to get in to some quality smallmouth action! What are the possibilities of catching 20"" smallies on cedar? Also we are looking at booking a week mid August to maybe third week of September. Would you go earlier or later in that time frame for walleyes,smallies and crappies/perch? Thanks."
5278370,prov1800,2017-01-18 20:03:00,5010,Anything is possible.i fish cedar a lot and for all species.still have to know how to fish but a 100 walleyes a day is not out of the question.have done it many times.there is a hugecsmallouth population there as well.huge pike and muskies.and cedars crappies are crazy.not easy to catch fish if your new but should do well.time of year and water temps control fishing there.there will be more boat traffic iam sure than nungessorbut there are lotsofvplace to fish on the 17 mi. Long lake.wind usually not a big factor but can get rough at times in certain areas.
5278450,padreeo,2017-01-18 20:40:00,2,"Boat traffic is significantly heavier on cedar. Additionally, our group found the number of cabins/lodges on cedar diatracts from the feeling of remoteness we'd prefer for a Canadian experience."
5280530,packpro,2017-01-19 20:11:00,695,"Our group fished Nungesser twice. Great trips both times. One fall trip and another the following spring. In the fall, the camp only offered salted frozen minnows. They worked fine, but they made quite a mess and we ended up using stinger hooks to compensate for when they got mushy. In the spring we had 12 guys. We made arrangements with the outfitter and had 200 dozen minnow brought in. At the time we could get them in bulk for $3/doz. They just kept them in two huge fine mesh (large) boxes on the end of the docks. The live bait worked better. We caught great numbers(walleyes) and enough better than average(24""-29"") size walleyes. We didn't target Pike but we caught quite a few 34"" plus fish. The guys in camp who did target them caught many over 40"" and one 48"" monster. Plenty of water here. At the time there were three active camps on the lake. Two of three had camp boats with smaller motors. They tended to stay at one end of the lake. We fished there and the fishing was good. Our camp offered larger motors so had the full run of the lake. We fished the opposite end of the lake and it was rare to see another boat unless it was our group. Lots of good spots on both ends of the lake."
