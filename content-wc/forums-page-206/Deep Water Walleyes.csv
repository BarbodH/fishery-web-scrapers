5294786,Aspencreek,2017-01-27 07:00:00,2911,"I understand that it can be done, but I guess I need to be educated. I was told that pulling some species of fish from very deep (over 30-40') would create a ""bends"" type reaction without ""bleeding"" the air bladder, or something like that. And I don't know how to do it nor do I care to learn how. I do enough damage when cleaning them. When salmon and Laker fishing the captain said those fish can self regulate because they spend so much time in really deep water, but some other species cannot and will die shortly after release. I'd like to know, was I fed a load of BS."
5294842,Bobby Winds,2017-01-27 07:20:00,10817,No.........walleye and perch not to mention bass and even gobies cannot survive from being caught from deep water. Salmon and trout most times can.
5295282,Obabikon,2017-01-27 09:52:00,2370,"When we find fish at 35 feet deep... I actually slide up the hill. Even 35' is tough on bigger walleye. For them to be that deep, I would imagine it is a very clear water lake."
5295346,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-27 10:13:00,461,"Brett, Don't do it buddy. And I have also had guys tell its not a problem. I throw them back and they swim away. What they don't see is that fish is dead and they won't even know it. On my lake the big fish down there are usually lakers. Hundreds of them. And every night the whole school will pop up to maybe 60 feet to feed and then head on back down. You can also see some HUGE walleye schools at 40-60 feet. Can't miss them. But while you can get down there it isn't worth it. I won't even fish for bass 30+ feet down. If what you are seeing are truly walleye that deep then do yourself a favor and get out of bed at first light or fish into dusk and those fish will be within range of you not taking a hammer to their air bladder. -FT"
5295378,Aspencreek,2017-01-27 10:24:00,2911,"We ran into this situation on Lac Seul a few years ago, my son and I were marking a big school just off the bottom in 40-45'. My brother comes over and is convinced they are lazy mid-day walleye. He proceeds to try and get heavy jigs down to them. After and hour and a half of sitting on top of them he gives up, NOT 1 bite. Now LS is stained water not clear, and fish at 40', in Aug. I'm betting they were close mouthed Whitefish. And my brother proved he has way more patience than me."
5295994,BornToFish,2017-01-27 16:32:00,1224,"Greetings,I was thinking that schools of ciscoes might be pulling some walleyes to very deep water. If so, these walleyes might be the biggest in the system. Thus, they might be worth pursuing. Maybe not many numbers, but possibly trophy fish.One thing that you might consider is waiting these walleyes out. Ciscoes often rise up in the water column in the afternoon going into evening. If so, these trophy walleyes may also rise upwards in the water column to stay in contact with their food source.I read somewhere a theory that the day's sunlight often triggers a rise in algae and other microscopic plants/animals that ciscoes use as their food source. This daily source of new food is in the upper reaches of the water column - where sunlight penetrates the water. The ciscoes move upwards later in the day to take advantage of this daily source of new food.You might consider noting the location of your deep water sonar marks. Then, revisit these same areas later in the day and see if they have moved upwards in the water column. If so, these fish might be very active and more readily accessible.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5296066,The tank,2017-01-27 17:05:00,340,A couple years back someone posted a study from the MNR on catching deep walleyes. I think the mortality rate at 40ft was 7-10 percent and after that it got pretty high. If I remember right it said that you cant rececitate them like other fish. (Shoot air in there bladder or whatever) i think the study said at 40ft if you reeled them up really fast the mortality rate was even higher. It was a good read I just can't remember stuff like I use too.
5294122,bthomas3333,2017-01-26 18:03:00,465,"Hey Guys, Ok so its August and you are fishing a walleye lake where you normally catch walleyes in 15-25 ft in June. You start search for them on the finder and you start to finding them in 60+ ft all the way down to 100 ft. You go out at midnight and they are still 60+ ft. Occasionally you find one or two small ones in 35 ft but how do you target the deeper ones? In the past I have given up and fished other species. My ideas: Down riggers - UGH! Floro line to keep all that line down there and 3-6 oz jigs? Big weights and spinners or cranks? Any ideas guys? Has anyone ever had success targeting walleyes in 60+ ft? Thanks, Brett"
5294146,pjshorthorn,2017-01-26 18:15:00,5654,"Sorry, but I never thought to try catching them at that depth due to the high mortality rate. I don't even target them if they are close to 30 ft deep. PjShorthorn"
5294194,bthomas3333,2017-01-26 18:43:00,465,Good point. Didn't think about that...very true. B-
5294314,adempsey2.0,2017-01-26 20:28:00,612,"Seems kind of deep for August, but I guess it depends on the lake. You sure it wasn't Whitefish you were marking?"
5294354,tight-lines,2017-01-26 20:45:00,12,"3 way rigs with 4-8oz's. Spinners and cranks will work or just a regular BB slow speeds. Do some google searches on Lake Oahe, that are typically super deep come July and August.."
5294386,Aspencreek,2017-01-26 20:56:00,2911,"I was thinking the same thing, if I'm marking fish over 30' deep in august, even at midnight ""they are not walleyes"" and if the are, I'm not in the mood to try and drag them up that far. I'll probably kill every one, even tho I have released them. Back to solving the problem...... If given the same conditions, I'm going to see if they have really moved up even more shallow than I feel comfortable boating in, under 4'. I hit the points and windy side of the islands and slip bobber in tight and work it back out to deeper water, or drag a floating jig with a tail hooked minnow with a sinker about 2' up the line. If that doesn't work....well, I tried, pull out the pike rod and head for the weeds."
5294402,jb_wi,2017-01-26 21:08:00,212,"I wouldn't fish them that deep either because they will most likely die. As far as how to get lures down that deep, the Offshore snap weight kit works well, especially with mainline thin diameter braid with 15 or 20 foot flouro leader."
5294514,tight-lines,2017-01-26 22:50:00,12,30ft seems like deep water until you fish deep water. Last summer while trolling salmon we pulled several walleye from over 100ft. On some big reservoirs 30 feet is normal and 50-60 feet is getting deep.
5294562,BornToFish,2017-01-27 03:55:00,1224,"Greetings,I am with Adempsey, in that my first and immediate reaction is the deep water fish on the sonar unit may be whitefish or lakers. I would look for and then target walleyes on shallower structure, as these fish might be easier to approach.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5294682,Bobby Winds,2017-01-27 06:08:00,10817,"On the EAST Basin on Erie we can find walleyes in the summer from 30' to 120 feet deep... but mostly 40' - 72'.........so I just drift in a heavy wind or slow troll using my electric TM while pulling worm harnesses with a 5/8 oz to 3/4 oz slip sinker sinker and sometimes a small 1 to 1.5 oz chugging iron when depths are over 60'. I find this a relaxing way to fish and very productive too. Could I catch more dropping my riggers, planer board and dipsey's down, yes but nowhere as much fun. I don't care if I come home with 4 walleyes or a limit, it's the fun experience that matters to me."
