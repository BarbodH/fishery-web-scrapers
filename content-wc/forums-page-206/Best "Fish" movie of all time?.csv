It reminds me of the rumor I heard about you trying to catch Pokemon on your trip to Wine Lake last year....... PjShorthorn"
5286738,HeHooksHimself,2017-01-23 08:56:00,725,"Oh yeah, I remember that scene. Jeremiah Johnson is one of my favorites, Pilgrim. ""Ever skin Grizz, Pilgrim?"" ""When ya get done with that one I'll get ya another!"" PJ, You've either been talking to Doc or you have been following me. I didn't think anyone was watching. I'm gonna get that Pokeman rascal. No time for fishing! Hooks"
5286802,pjshorthorn,2017-01-23 09:07:00,5654,"Well, I'm embarrassed to admit that my wife bought me a waterproof case for my phone after last year's trip.......I don't even want to get into what I did to one of V-bay Gord's upgrade boat chasing those dang critters. Just a piece of advice, don't mount your cell phone over the depth finder screen...... Even if it is really easy to zip tie your phone to it and the mount is in just the right spot.....you can't see when it goes from 20 to 2 ft quick. PjShorthorn"

I never knew there was a film version of Old Man And The Sea. I'm going to have to look for that, as I've read the book multiple times. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5275858,Blackmacs,2017-01-17 11:39:00,2121,There's the horror classic Blood Hook.

5276138,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-17 14:42:00,447,I'm sorry but in light of Rock being gay (not that there's anything wrong with that-Seinfeld reference) that sentence struck me as funny.
5276338,pale ryder,2017-01-17 17:43:00,1937,The book was a lot better.
5277434,Larbo,2017-01-18 11:23:00,231,I have to include Jeremiah Johnson.

5271410,Carnhzkr,2017-01-15 04:22:00,964,"There was the ""scene"" with Al & Ernie and the two girls from Moose Lake. My guess is there was a lot more to that story that remains untold, perhaps to protect the innocent. Their Siren call brought the boys back in search of them the following year. They must have been exceptional waitresses."
5271506,Obabikon,2017-01-15 06:56:00,2370,HAHA... that's right.
5271514,pjshorthorn,2017-01-15 07:07:00,5654,"All of the movies mentioned are great entertainment. Although not movies, all of trips that I have taken with Gramps ( my Dad ) are as funny as a good movie. He has the uncanny ability to create the funniest moments by just being himself and doing stuff on our trips that just make you shake your head and laugh. So for me, I just relive those memories and laugh my butt off every year when he tries to deflect and blame others for the past moments he created himself.. I do wish I had many of those trips on video tape. It would have been quite a montage by now if I had. PjShorthorn"
5271738,3M TA3,2017-01-15 09:05:00,2846,Funny. I'm getting more like Burgess Meredith. Wife is starting to run faster than me now though. Lucky her.

5269690,yoopertrout,2017-01-13 19:58:00,1172,A river Runs Through It. Jaws and Grumpy Old Men were good too.

5269882,Obabikon,2017-01-13 22:22:00,2370,"Fantastic.... Grumpy Old Men is a fantastic move.

He has never fished or been in the outdoors in his life. He is entered in a fishing tournament by his boss and the movie is a comedy of him trying to fish, camp and uphold his life as an Outdoors Expert"

5270594,NP4ME,2017-01-14 12:56:00,378,"Great list, Jared! Jaws is an all time classic, but the Grumpy Old Men movies are right up there. Lemmon and Matthau were quite the duo. Too bad they're no longer around. Although not necessarily a ""fish"" movie, John Candy in ""The Great Outdoors"" I think would fit this bill. That movie always reminded me of trips to the north woods. I still love watching it. Candy is another one that left too soon."

5268930,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-13 13:51:00,447,I think you mean Henry Fonda. Can we include FINDING NEMO as a fish movie? That's a good movie when watched with kids or grandkids.
5268978,chinewalker,2017-01-13 14:11:00,59,Grumpy Old Men for Sure!
5269002,Ricky Spanish,2017-01-13 14:28:00,1298,"Yes, thanks for reminding me to remember my poor memory. Now I feel stupid. Wait, what was I talking about again?"
5269050,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-13 14:52:00,447,"The relatively recent movie IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, which is based on the true story that inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick, did not do well at the box office but should make the list as a ""fish"" movie. (Yea, I know, whales are mammals not fish)."
5269090,Mike Borger,2017-01-13 14:58:00,1554,Grumpy Old Men for sure. The irony is I'm morphing more and more into Walter Mathau every day!

5269202,The tank,2017-01-13 15:33:00,340,Grumpy old men is my pick. The only movie I've watched more times is 8 seconds.
5269330,andersaki,2017-01-13 16:32:00,1426,I second the Old man and the sea. I re-read it every couple of years. andersaki

Maybe what we need is a less serious topic to get us all excited about fishing again! Personally... A River Runs Through It was one of the best movies I've watched in my entire life. We will just have to wait until ""A North Woods Fisherman's Story"" comes out on the big screen! If you dont' get that reference... that is WalleyeCentral's very own amazing Bill Krejca's awesome book!"
5268490,prov1800,2017-01-13 10:33:00,5010,Loved them all but grumpier old men get my vote.
5268570,LOW1,2017-01-13 10:48:00,2828,My vote would go to Spencer Tracey in The Old Man and the Sea.
5268666,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-13 11:25:00,447,"The scene from JAWS where they compare scars is one of my all-time favorite movie scenes, especially when Quint talks about the USS Indianapolis."

5268746,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-13 12:42:00,8293,Grumpy Old Men was the only one i've seen. (go figure eh?)
5268778,Ricky Spanish,2017-01-13 12:57:00,1298,"Favorite is definitely Jaws. Liked both Grumpy Old Men movies, too. I remember cracking up when Peter Fonda was cussing at Walter the fish in On Golden Pond. I think I was about 9."
5268794,Bstar,2017-01-13 12:57:00,564,"A river runs through it gets my vote. Jared, it must be slow at the All Canada show! I'll be there Sunday collecting brochures and talking to camp owners."
5268842,Obabikon,2017-01-13 13:14:00,2370,Doesn't open until 3 today. It was actually packed last night! A fantastic day for a Thursday!
