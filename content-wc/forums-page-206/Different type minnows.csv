I've never been super selective about the breed of minnow we buy, but some guys are. One group are diehard Emerald shiner fans.Occasionally I see a Stickleback in our bait supply and have never caught a fish using them. Just me? They are ugly little buggers.Any thoughts on different species and availability, hardiness, walleye favorites?Pooch"

I did usually try to avoid the sticklebacks but when it came down to using them they seemed to catch fish pretty good too. I started salting fatheads and taking them along several years ago and haven't used a live minnow north of the border since."
5278234,Baseline,2017-01-18 18:31:00,3207,IMO rainbow chubs are the best minnows to have. They are hardy and hold up well while on the hook. When fishing some lakes like Lake of the Woods emerald shiners are good to have.

Unless, the size is related to the species, I have no idea. Most of the time they just look like shiners to me.I read many times that certain minnows are better than others. Often it has to do with how robust they are. I seem to recall in one book I read the author preferred females over males (yes, minnows!).I remember as a kid when we got our scoops of minnows it was just loaded with different types - dace, darters, shiners, sculpins, sticklebacks, chubs.... it was just as fun to pick my minnow to fish with as it was to fish!"

5279634,bigwalleye1,2017-01-19 13:17:00,2632,"I believe most of we get in the local bait shop and at the lodge in the Sioux Lookout area are a dace species. We see an occasional red stripe or yellow stripe dace, those I know, in the bucket, and the others looks the same to me, except they're stripe-less. As to sticklebacks, not my favorite, but i'll fish it if i grab it in the bucket."
