5279146,Lotw1,2017-01-19 09:16:00,36,"I have a Consul propane fridge and have had good luck with it. 100lb tanks are the way to go now with all the inspections. I've heard the new inspection requirements really scrutinize the lines running above ground because of the bedrock, not sure of the exact issues though. We heat with wood but the Empire vented heaters are good units"
5279202,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-19 09:36:00,461,"Hey there. Your solution to the inspection problem with TSSA is not entirely correct. Yes, you can go into town and get the 100 pounders filled up. I own a lodge and I do the same thing. I run maybe 5 at a time and get them refilled every now and then (only one stove and a fireplace is run on propane everything else is electric). So yes, now you have propane whereas before they would not fill you up on-site based on the failing inspection. HOWEVER, that still does not give you a pass on the failed inspection. If and when TSSA shows up again and they see that you have not fixed the issue (and in fact jerry rigged your system to keep right on working) you are going to have bigger problems to deal with. Much bigger. These guys do not mess around. As a lodge owner I have seen and heard horror stories of their abuse of power. They can and have shut down lodges and entire operations when they shut down your fuel distribution. And the best part by far is that when they come back out to re-inspect to see if you did the required work they send you a BILL for their time. I could go on and on. Anyway, my suggestion to you from personal experience is fix the problem or someone (you) will pay the piper. -FT"
5279346,tolsen,2017-01-19 10:28:00,126,"There is just a bunch of new regulations that came up in the last 8-10 years since it has been inspected. A couple off the tip of my head were: -Need drip lines for all appliances, we just had on at the main entry which was okay back then -They strongly recommended to have black pipe for the main trunk line and not copper (not sure why) -Can't have the grill inside of our screened in porch since it has a small roof -Water heater needs to now be moved inside (it was outside off the bathroom with a small enclosure we made) -Our heater we have is now not up to their code (which we agree is pretty old and inefficient) Then just some other things so pretty much we would just have to re-do all the lines which being that the cabin is older we dont disagree with. Especially when you are messing with propane there is no reason to take any risks. However, it have been fine and worked great for 20 years so it is just frustrating that now everything is failing due to new regulations in the area. Also they happily quote about $20,000 to redo all the lines and add in a new tankless system, and a couple propane baseboard heaters. We are all very handy and have worked with this stuff before so dont mind doing it ourselves for closer to $2,000 ."
5279362,tolsen,2017-01-19 10:31:00,126,"Hey just to clarify too, it isnt a lodge, just our own personal small cabin. However, I agree with them potentially trying to charge even more to come and inspect again."
5279754,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-19 14:08:00,447,"Am I understanding this correctly, the same organization that does the inspections also will perform the ""necessary"" repairs? Sounds like a pretty good racket."
5279842,tolsen,2017-01-19 14:41:00,126,"That is correct! Now you can understand our frustrations about working with them. We are going to get other opinions too, but it is $250 for someone to come out and look since we are out on an island and fairly remote in Minaki area. Our thoughts were to run 1/2"" black pipe as the main line through the middle of the cabin, use 3/8"" CSST as the branch lines off of that into the fixtures/appliances with a sediment trap before all the appliances. However, I have not 100% how to get both 100 lber's together with one regulator. Also from there what is the best way to run from those into the cabin. High Pressure flexible black rubber line or do CSST there are well? I have read that CSST even though it is designed to be flexible it is not something that you want to moved and disconnect a lot or else I can start to crack over time."

5280402,Skywagon,2017-01-19 19:10:00,1106,"The Rinnai tankless water heater in my home DOES use 110 volt electricity, the tankless water heaters in our outpost cabins only use a 9 volt battery for the igniter. Tolsen, the Government have been busy in our direction also. Last year we had to dig in new grey water lines from two of the outpost cabins (by hand). All just part of the fun."
5277802,tolsen,2017-01-18 14:49:00,126,"Hey guys! Hoping for some help, last time for our dock project everyone was helpful with how to get it all anchored into the granite. We have the lovely propane inspection and like about 90% of everyone up there we talked to we of course failed for different reasons (some seem ridiculous). Any who we are at the cabin about 4 week total out of the year so dont really see a reason to dump tons of $$$$ into it. We need to get a new propane heater though. What are some approved propane heaters in Canada for small off the grid cottages? What are options too about how large/small a solar system needs to be to power a small fridge?"
5278058,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-18 17:21:00,447,Have you considered a propane fridge. I love mine and it is very fuel efficient.
5278362,tolsen,2017-01-18 19:56:00,126,"We have a propane one now, but have not had tons of luck they seem to only last like 5-6 years for us and at $1400-2000 we were just looking for other options. Our main thing now is a propane heater that we can use and a new propane tankless water heater both of which we dont want that HAVE to have electricity."
5278386,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-18 20:05:00,8293,"I think you can try Lakes Gas in International Falls Mn. 877- 877- 9905 I'm pretty sure they had a propane refrigerator last time I was in there. If they have a refrigerator odds are they will have a heater you are looking for. I would assume they can answer your questions on what you can use in Canada. If not they should have a contact for who would know. Good luck, let us know what you find out."
5278410,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-18 20:10:00,447,"Solar is going to end up costing you more. A system big enough to run a fridge, a few lights, phone charging etc is going to run at least $7000 US. Batteries are going to last 5-7 years with good care. Care that being there 4 weeks a year won't provide. There are some new experimental batteries that hold promise of longer life but you're looking at probably $3000 for new batteries every 4-5 years and that's with a small genset tied to battery bank to top up batteries when the sun is insufficient. There are some good solar forums where you can get some great advice, better than I can provide. I'll bet most will recommend a propane fridge. They should last longer than what you've experienced. Good luck, wish I could help you more."
5278426,That Minnesota guy,2017-01-18 20:16:00,8293,"Personally I would go all propane. Heat, refrig, water heater, lights. It works for the fly in camps. I also think you must have gotten a bad unit if it only lasted 5-7 years. Maybe some camp owners can chime in on how long their propane refrigerators last."
5278674,Skywagon,2017-01-19 04:48:00,1106,"You should not be having that much trouble with a propane fridge. The most favored brand of propane fridge right now seems to be Crystal Cold, the are made in Arthur Illinois by the Amish, phone 800-898-0552. These fridges have been trouble free in the operation I am involved in and I have heard the same from others that are using them. The on demand hot water heater is the only way to go, it does not require any electricity, works great and only uses propane when you turn the hot water faucet on. I have no experience heating cabins with propane (only wood), but would wonder if propane infrared heat might be good option, there is no fan, so no need for electricity. Don't be afraid of using propane, it is being used in most outpost cabins and is trouble free. Include that with a basic solar system, a small Honda 2000 backup generator and it should be all you would ever need to be comfortable."
5278690,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-19 05:02:00,447,My tankless water heater DOES require electricity. Perhaps some do not. I have a propane space heater in my basement that DOES NOT require electricity as the basement heats adequately without a blower on the heater.
5278898,tolsen,2017-01-19 06:54:00,126,"Thanks for all the responses and keep them coming! We are not afraid of propane at all, everything up there currently runs off propane it is just that the ""Canada Propane Police"" did their inspection and failed items. Like I said there is no leaks or anything just not to code items. From what it sounds like they have pretty much failed everyone in the area for minor items. With that though they will not refill our bulk tank until those are all fixed which we have some experience and can do ourselves. We have also heard though that most of the smaller lodges in the area and cottages are using 100lb tanks which they can just disconnect then take into town to get refilled (therefore bypassing the inspection). I think we might go that route and get a couple 100lb tanks. So what we have currently is gas mantels (6 or so), Propane fridge (needs replaced), Stove, and hot water heater. So I heard Norcold what are some others of your guys favorites?"
5279098,pjshorthorn,2017-01-19 08:54:00,5654,"Out of curiosity, what failed on the inspections ? Been in the compressed gas business a long time and just interested in learning something new that Transport Canada has in terms of regulations. PjShorthorn"
