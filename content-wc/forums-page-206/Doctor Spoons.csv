I still use them all the time because they are very effective!Quote: Originally Posted by FishoilMike, do you mainly use the 4 1/2"" size?Yes.

5281018,BornToFish,2017-01-20 06:49:00,1224,"Greetings,I picked up some Doctor spoons (4.5 inches, 1+ ounces) from the Thorne Brothers booth at the All Canada Show in Green Bay. I intend to use them casting around weeds, weed edges and shallow rocks for northern pike. The packaging indicates that the hook can be placed on either end of the spoon, to tweak the action of the spoons on the retrieve.How do you run your Doctor spoons when casting? Do you attach your fishing line (leader) at the narrow or wide end of the spoon?Many thanks.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5281026,Bakefish,2017-01-20 06:54:00,1077,I've never considered attaching to the wide end. I may now. I do know that it can be a great lure at times.
5281034,Mike Borger,2017-01-20 06:54:00,1554,"My favorite non weedless spoon for pike - love them! I have never switched the hooks around though, have only ever used them as they're rigged out of the package - with hook at the wide end.Make sure you get a couple in the hammered fluorescent orange/copper color. It's a magic lure."
5281050,BornToFish,2017-01-20 07:10:00,1224,"Greetings,I just re-read the packaging for the Doctor spoon. It says that attaching the line to the larger end of the spoon will induce a wider wobble and run at mid-depth on the retrieve. The recommend attaching the line to the narrow end of the spoon when trolling, suggesting the spoon will have a narrow wobble and run deeper.I would appreciate thoughts from guys that have experimented with the spoons. Many thanks.....Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5281210,BornToFish,2017-01-20 08:06:00,1224,"Greetings once again,It so happens that the first spoon off the rack was a hammered copper version of the Doctor spoon with two orange stripes. I recall that Mike Borger mentioned in a thread about one month ago that this particular spoon was one of his favorites! It looks like it should be a champion. I will be throwing this spoon this summer.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5281354,MrSimon,2017-01-20 09:24:00,922,"They look nice and folks seem to like them. But at $10 a pop, I don't know if I'll be stocking up on them. One or two wouldn't hurt though.EDIT: Just spent $30 on Amazon ....."
5281530,rocko0305,2017-01-20 11:07:00,138,"I use Johnson Silver Minnows, Williams Whitefish, and Daredevles spoons all the time, but have yet to try the Doctor Spoon. Does anyone know if the weedless version has the same action as the non-weedless version? I rarely am in a situation where I can throw something that isn't weedless, which is why I use the Silver Minnow 90% of the time, and the Whitefish and Daredevle very sparingly."
5281538,fishron,2017-01-20 11:17:00,317,A cheaper alternative that is also a very effective pike spoon is the Thomas Buoyant. I have both Doctor spoons and these in my pike box and in the flashy gold and red finishes they are effective.
5281658,Fishoil,2017-01-20 12:48:00,1277,"Mike, do you mainly use the 4 1/2"" size?"
5281762,adempsey2.0,2017-01-20 13:20:00,612,"The Williams Whitefish spoons mention the same thing. You can switch around where the hook is attached. As a matter of fact, they sell two versions of the same spoon, the hooks are just at opposite ends. At least they used to."
