4771202,KSlivin,2016-04-25 09:47:00,36,Looking around for a new lake and was seeing if anyone has any reviews on Sharpstone Lake with Halley's Camps or Malaher Lake with Nestor Falls outfitters? Thanks in advance
4772698,pikeman14,2016-04-25 16:34:00,144,"Sharpstone is supposed to be halleys best lake for a chance at trophy fish. I believe it is their most northerly lake outpost. They do record some monster pike on that lake. We were at salvesen and chase lake a couple years ago, excellent cabins and service. I believe Sharpstone is a 5 day trip compared to 6 day trips with no check in flights. When I asked the owners about Sharpstone the tone in their voice changed with excitement. It must be a special spot and fishery. My next trip with halleys will be Sharpstone."

5295058,Mike Borger,2017-01-27 08:36:00,1554,"No, but I want to fish it badly. It's right near the top of my own personal short list. Specifically because you have the ability to access Moar Lake.Worth noting Malaher Lake with Nestor Falls also gives you access to Moar with a little more difficulty and it's a very nice cabin.http://nestorfalls.com/outposts/malaher-lake/"
5295106,KSlivin,2017-01-27 08:46:00,36,"Thanks Mike, We are actually slated to fish up there at the end of May. I've talked to a few people that have fished it in the past and they all have given me some bays to make sure and hit. With all of your experience with fly-ins and having weight restrictions, what do you recommend for tackle and how many do you usually take for your preferred method for this time of year? We will be mostly fishing for pike with the walleye thrown in there for meals. I like your video you just put out on youtube! Great work!Thanks in advance, Gabe"
5295690,Mike Borger,2017-01-27 14:16:00,1554,"You'll have a GREAT trip at the end of May in that lake! For pike, just pinpoint every single bay with a creek filtering into Moar and do a milk run. I usually run and gun fairly quickly, you'll usually know pretty quick whether the pike are there.Bare minimum for rods/reels on a trip like that for me is four. Two med/hvy saltwater spinning rods to start with. I'm really loving the St. Croix Avid 7' med hvy saltwater spinning rod paired with a nice light spinning reel filled with 30lb braid, usually a Stradic CI4 4000. Another med/heavy baitcaster with 40lb braid, then one light spinning rod/reel for jigging walleye."
