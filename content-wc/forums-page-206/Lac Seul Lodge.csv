(Assuming no really adverse conditions). Also, any success with Perch or smallmouth at this time? Are the 2 outpost lakes worth the run? Thanks."
5283114,prov1800,2017-01-21 08:44:00,5010,"I do get out on lac seul early to late fall.from my experience on the lake in late may i just do the long trips to brood and sunlight,the back of mackemzie bay or south inlet.these are the go to spots and you wont be alone.the trips are well worth it on a nicer day.you are looking atva 25 + mile trip one way.fishing is very good in the places i mentioned due to warmer water temps and they are spawning areas.if its rough there are goodxspots to fish in rat bay ascyou are coming from camp.its a fair trip to main lake andxtwo ways to access main lake.you wont get into the numbers of fish as you would the other spots but should still be able to find some.would suggest to fish very slow.water temps will be colder on west side than the east side."

5285474,Shotgun,2017-01-22 15:43:00,759,"jeok3, we will be there the first week of june. Just a word of caution, that time of year the water level will be two to three feet lower than later in the summer. This will probably narrow your access to the main lake to one way as the short cut will be shallow. Also, be careful going to sunlight as one year I hit a ledge and tore up a prop. It's a narrow channel with not much room to navigate. Lac Seul is full of rocks which can make it a challenge but the great fishing makes up for it. Enjoy!https://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/LacSeulGraph2017.01.20.pdf"
5285834,prov1800,2017-01-22 18:11:00,5010,Your absolutly right.could be even shallower.not a problem if youve done it but new guts need to be very carefull.
5286554,Lake Wisconsin,2017-01-23 07:52:00,1960,"I fished the fall on the west end. Never NEEDED to go far, but did explore. One of our best spots was about 1 mile from camp - south winds were pushing the waves up that shore all week long and the hot spot was right on the weed line in 6 fow. Was great."
5288618,prov1800,2017-01-24 08:02:00,5010,Fall fishing is totally different than spring time.west side really turns on as the water temps climb and dont have to travell very far if you dont want to.but the further away spots can really shine and nothing like a calm day to go to those places.east side has the spawning areas and also much warmer water.basically to get good fishing you almost need to head there.although fish can be caught on all the west shoreline.
5292682,Aspencreek,2017-01-25 19:53:00,2911,"I fish out of Onaway which is not far away on LS but on a totally different bay, but not until July or aug/sept. Getting to the main lake from LS lodge can be tricky that early due to changing water levels. Some of the spots are shallow and tight. As far as spots to fish that time of year, they have been noted earlier in this thread, all a looong boat ride with some interesting but tricky navigation. Again, you will NOT be alone on those spots as that early in the year those spots are the ones with the greatest fish populations. Another reason why I don't go until July. Another thing to consider is weather, the only times I fished LS in May it snowed both times and trying to fish thru the ice is a possibility. Good Luck and have fun!"
5294002,Joek3,2017-01-26 16:32:00,244,"Great info. I am sure we will try the popular spots but I tend To try and find a bit of seclusion. I will sacrifice fish as some of the enjoyment to me is the solitude. Again, all good stuff. Cannot wait and hope I don't need my ice auger!!!"
