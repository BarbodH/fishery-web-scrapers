4924361,v-bay gord,2016-06-13 17:36:00,3168,I'm sure you're just having some fun......but I'm glad that someone is checking to keep things legit. I've heard through the grapevine that Pikeslayer8 can be a bit of a renegade........
4924393,smithcr1981,2016-06-13 17:54:00,42,"i have never been checked before in canada. what is the deal with the bait reciept? also i thought you just have to have your life jacket in the boat? good thing they didnt check a group of wisconsin boys, Im sure they would find more than their limit of beer in the cooler."
4924401,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 17:55:00,1460,Lol..... Bet ya like my song though.
4924425,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 18:09:00,1460,"The bait receipt proves I purchased them(leeches and minnows) in Canada. Without the receipt, they could cast dispersion on the origin of the leeches. I'm guessing they would probably take your bait and give a hefty fine Now, if they were to start counting leeches, that would suck."
4924537,Bass Lake,2016-06-13 18:48:00,20,"So, you have to carry a receipt of your purchased bait or you get your rear fined? And the life jackets... dont they just need to be in the boat, not literally on you? Ya, I am new to fly-ins in Canada. Been up there several times, but its been awhile and never before a fly-in.. I surely dont remember having to have a receipt for bait, or having to be wearing the life jacket.. just had it in the boat for each person-like here in Minny. Please enlighten me, fly-in trip vets.."
4925041,v-bay gord,2016-06-13 21:42:00,3168,"There is no regulation requiring you to have a bait receipt. Life jackets need to be in the boat, not worn."
4925057,Mike Borger,2016-06-13 21:52:00,1554,"Interesting stories, both Bill and Keith. Was very glad to read both of your tales as I thought maybe they might go in a different direction. I should have known better.You guys are both cool, I'd be happy to share a boat with either one of you."
4925745,NP4ME,2016-06-14 07:24:00,378,"Why do you view it as harassment? I have been checked in both Canada and Minnesota (Minnesota multiple times), and I welcome it. The officers I have had the encounters with have been nothing but respectful and professional. I'm sure glad someone is out there to protect the resource."
4925785,Ricky Spanish,2016-06-14 07:33:00,1298,"My wife and I were checked on Eagle Lake, near Dead Man's Reef, a couple weeks ago. They were polite and asked the usual questions, where did we get our bait, lifejackets, how many fish in camp and on board. I was a bit nervous being that our new boat didn't have the registration numbers on it yet. They never even mentioned it. WI DNR took three months to get my application processed and send the numbers. Heading back up again after work tomorrow for nine more days of fishing heaven."
4925945,emma17,2016-06-14 07:56:00,436,"I wouldn't have a problem with an on the water inspection. However, if it took 1 1/2 hours of my day, I'd be upset- no two ways about it."
4923737,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 14:32:00,1460,"Ya better not cry. You better not pout, I'm telling you why The MNR is coming to camp The MNR is coming to camp The MNR is coming to camp Their making a list, checking it twice Gonna find out who's naughty or nice The MNR is coming to camp The MNR is coming to camp The MNR is coming to camp They sees you when you are drinking They know when you're all fuc.ed up They know if you've been bad or good So be good for goodness sake So, we got checked on Thursday. I was the lead boat heading out just after having Walleye Tacos and the beaver was on us when we were mid-lake crossing. They searched my boat, my cooler, my boat safety kit. We all had lifejackets on and they questioned us separately, by boat.... Did you have walleye for lunch and how many and how many are in the freezer. So, we told him that we had 9 walleye for lunch and 8 in the freezer with 2 sport licenses among the 7 of us. Well, that didn't seem to compute well with the officer so we had to go back to camp so they could inspect us more thoroughly. I personally had a lot I wanted to tell them from my last encounter 5 years ago. I needed to tell them .... The rest of the story. Instead of just taxiing behind us back to camp (a 10 min. boat ride) the MNR Beaver took off and flew over and I swear, almost hovering over our camp. So we arrive back and Pat takes the one officer to the freezer to count fish. John had to do the math for them for it to make sense that we can have 18 fish and we accounted for 17. They also wanted to see the bait receipt for the leeches, which I produced. Meanwhile, at the dock, I told the MNR chief about the MNR officer who almost got shredded to pieces on our shore lunch rock, 5 years ago, how we were somewhat read the riot act on ""party fishing"", and how they are tired of dragging dead drunk Americans out of these outpost camps. I told him how my boys put out the lightning fire at the Outlet on River Bay 5 years ago when fires were all over the Province just a day after this encounter. Felt good to get this off my back and I think they liked hearing what I had to say. These guys were very cool and I told them how much they are appreciated and that we regard them as heroic guardians of the resource. The junior officer told me that he just got transferred out of Ft Francis. Which made me think that he was Checkpoint Charlie. My buddy Dave did ask them if they just saw us or what, and the junior officer said that they now have a set schedule and route they will check. So, on Wabakimi, I know they checked this lake the Friday before and then Thursday.... a 6 day turnaround...... so be forewarned."
4923889,tv4fish,2016-06-13 15:07:00,2694,"Can we take that as ""They were respectful and polite""?"
4923905,LOW1,2016-06-13 15:09:00,2828,"I'm glad that the MNR did its job well and professionally and that we won't be reading about you in the local papers.When you think about it, the cost of a Beaver and keeping it in the air and paying the officers, etc makes for a hefty investment in protecting the resource that is being provided by Ontario."
4923921,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 15:13:00,1460,
4923937,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 15:19:00,1460,"Yup, felt great to have all my ducks in a row right down to the bait receipt, which in the past, I've been nonchalant about. Double yup, 2 officers, pilot and the Beaver probably costs close to 1000/hr and they mean business. Just wanted to give a heads up to those who think it wont happen to their group!"
4924105,v-bay gord,2016-06-13 16:18:00,3168,Turbo beaver.....nice.
4924121,LLewellin,2016-06-13 16:26:00,1790,So why would I want to go and get harassed like you did in Canada? I can get that same level of harassment right here in MN. Glad they weren't checking for something really serious like bringing in the wrong groceries! Just how many regulations do they need? For me not worth it. Let them have their lakes and fish and then we can charge them double for everything when they come down to the US.......or is that what happens when we go north? Glad they were professional and respectful.
4924225,Ogoki,2016-06-13 16:54:00,291,"Hey Pikeslayer, they must have left us and came looking for you. They checked my wife and I on Ogoki Reservoir about 10:30 am. that same morning . They were curteous . Asked for license which I already had in my hand before they landed. I started to hand him the license and he asked what license we had , I told him and he said he didn't need to see them. The couple with us were told to just hold out away from the plane and he asked what license they had , which I told him. He said do you understand what limit you are allowed which I told him. He mentioned our life vests and I pointed to our two Labs and told him they even have theirs on. He asked what fish we have at camp , which I replied 8 walleye and 6 pike . He went to cabin but only opened the door but didn't go in. (We were told that by camp attendant)4 veteran Canadian fly in fishermen were coming out as we flew in . They told us they were checked and a fish was a half centimeter over. They released to swim away and the guy was fined $180 . These guys couldn't get on the plane fast enough and all four said they were done fishing Canada. Camp attendant verified the measurement . I made sure what we kept was at least a half inch under 18 inches . I have enjoyed my 39 fly in trips and would rather spend that $180 fine towards another trip or gear or something . As you know the wind and rain was a bear but my wife and I fished EVERYDAY. The couple with us stayed in the cabin two days.Our walleye fishing was fantastic . Got into big numbers that ran from 18 to 22 inches and kept smaller to eat. . Needless to say we ate well everyday . Spend time at Moose Crossing and experienced superb fishing . Tied off in 14 ft of water and plucked them out . Awesome body of water. Moose Crossing is 14 mile or so boat ride each way . With the wind it beat us up. BUT WORTH IT . Got on Don's otter at 8 am , was pulling out their drive at 8:50 and pulled in my driveway at 5 am. Worked all day . Time for bed"
4924233,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 16:54:00,1460,"I didn't feel harassed at all. I mean just as soon as I saw that Beaver swooping down to land, I said to my boys that we are getting checked, get out the go-pro. I knew I was lilly-white legal, but yeah, it did cost me a hour and a half of prime fishing time. We weren't really all that mad at the fish anyway and we kinda enjoyed the experience. I hope you can reconsider your Canadian stance someday LLewellin . I wouldn't trade this years trip for nothing!"
4924273,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-13 17:10:00,1460,"I think it was about 5:00 when they got to us Keith. The West End trip is about the same as Moose Crossing, so yeah, I know what you mean, only difference in your report is that we identified 18' as the happy depth. Water levels down 2'-3' in Wabakimi"
