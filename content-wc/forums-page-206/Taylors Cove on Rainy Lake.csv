5289282,JDP,2017-01-24 12:22:00,1457,I found this:http://www.practical-fishing-tips.com/taylors-cove.htmlI have driven by many times but have not stopped to check it out.
5289666,Baseline,2017-01-24 15:14:00,3207,"I haven't been to Taylor's Cove since they closed their campground, but was a frequent visitor prior to that. Ed Taylor is a standup guy who runs a nice operation. The location is in the dead center of many Rainy fishing opportunities. Swell Bay - Seine Bay - Baseline Bay - Red Gut and all the intersecting waters. Great walleye action all summer. Smallmouth fishing is excellent from late May through June.. Good crappie action in late May and June. I don't think you will be disappointed with this resort."
