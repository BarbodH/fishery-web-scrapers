I fish up towards the NY / Ontario border and who's buying goods and services up there........the rough terrain or all the trees.........NO comparison to large ""MALLS"" you claimed to take Canadian money at par."
5277058,mickr,2017-01-18 07:02:00,74,"well Bobby....maybe I don't know what the term upper state NY means to you guys down south....I kind of consider Buffalo heading southI live in Ottawa and the NY state directly beneath us is a lot more ""upper"" than BuffaloAll I can tell you is ..... as I posted when the exchange rate is in that 20% range or less, everything south of the border from here takes Cdn money at par and they advertise up here about it. It's not uncommon at all. I've only been to Buffalo once....didn't like it...haven't been back and can't speak to the mall and sales situation there."
5277170,Bobby Winds,2017-01-18 07:37:00,10817,"Since you live in Canada you don't know the term UP State NEW YORK......it's a term that means you live anywhere except NYC........since you used the term you should know what it means. I'm glad you didn't like the Buffalo area, stay away, we don't need your funny money."
5277202,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-18 07:47:00,461,"You misread my post. I am not saying to charge different price to a different social class (or region). Not at all. Also nowhere did I compare choosing a lodge to choosing a plane seat. Not sure where you get that. I made the pricing model comparison to that of a hotel or a plane. This is very common in the industry. Next time you fly ask someone what they paid. It is common knowledge people pay less or more based on when they book. No surprise there. So when you ask them why they paid less I imagine they will say the same thing. And yes, we grant the same consideration to everyone. We have to abide by the same rules we put in place."
5277346,mickr,2017-01-18 09:25:00,74,"really Bobby? you are on a message board about Canadian fishing and throwing insults around as I said, I was in Buffalo once years ago before the days of GPS, I got lost. I pulled over to ask for directions and a kind gentleman told me that I did not want to be in the area of town I was in. He directed me to get back on the freeway, go a few exits, then get off and ask for directions. I am glad I don't live in a city like that. As for your comments re Canadians and our money....all I can say Bobby is that you seem to be the type that gives your fellow Americans a bad name when travelling globally. It's a shame really because most Americans I meet are very nice people."

He said the guy that owned XYZ resort was known for doing all sorts of non-customer friendly things. I believe the quote was ""he thinks he owns Canada."" He never got anymore business from me and this story was related to many of my fishing buddies who do Canadian fishing trips."

If my host wants to charge an individual or his countrymen less or more, it's really none of my business. Our hosts are fantastic people trying to earn a living. To the extent they have some sort of pricing strategy in play I just hope it is working for them."

I am just glad that this year I will be going to place which takes CC without upcharging and quotes in CAN. I find it very annoying when spending thousands to be nickeled and dimed. Annoying as **** when the $1200 per person becomes 1550 and you are in rush to catch plain and get back home.
5270866,mickr,2017-01-14 15:31:00,74,"it's funny how this issue pops up on fishing boards whenever the spread between the two currencies starts widening why don't we just put a moratorium on Americans fishing in Canada so we don't have this issue so 3M, if the lodge is 1000 bucks and you are happy paying that.....why does it matter what someone else pays? Seriously, I want to understand this. I'm Canadian, with the exchange rate being what it is, there's no way I am spending 1350 or 1400 or whatever on that vacation and if that cabin goes empty for the week and the boat unrented.....who loses? Ted does. Sucks to be Ted, I don't even know Ted. Ted runs a business, he can charge whatever the heck he wants to whoever he wants. His objective in running the business is to maximize his profit. I've got news for you....as a Canadian I pay less for stuff all the time compared to Americans. Do you live near the border? Anytime the exchange is less than 20%, businesses of all stripes just south of that border are taking Canadian money at par. Golf is a good example. The course might be 50 bucks - but they advertise north of the border that they take Canadian money at par so I only pay about 40 American to play. Does that pi$$ you off? All the malls just south of the border advertise and take Canadian money at par. as far as fishing lodges go - personally I look at lodges that charge in US funds as charging a premium that I will not pay."
5271058,rzep,2017-01-14 18:11:00,1196,"Unless you have some sort of personal or businesses relationship with lodge , the price is deciding factor. If you go to one of these Canadian shows - like one this weekend in Pheasant Run- there are isles of lodge owners with all the high and low tech marketing help. They all are very nice people and guess what....fishing on their lakes is the best.. So why are surprised that price is driving factor?"
5271098,Obabikon,2017-01-14 18:42:00,2370,"Don't assume that all owners simply lie about their place/lake being the best. I will flat out say, if you want a 30"" walleye, go to Lake Erie. If you want a 45"" Northern... try Athabasca. If you like a little of everything, including crappie... lake of the woods might be perfect for you. If you want to try to catch a 50+"" musky... Lake of the Woods is as good as any of them out there. We are all biased, but we are honest about it."

Those businesses charge me the same as you. I'll be glad to pay for services with Canadian money anywhere. If I can get a great deal using Canadian money, I'd be a fool not to use it. Also, I use Canadian money anywhere I can in the US if they accept it at par value. I spend a great deal of time in the Sault, both Michigan and Ontario and very few places offer par value. Very few. I would gladly shop at those places you're talking about if you could give me some tips. We don't have any malls up here south of the boarder. They have them north of the boarder though. I can't afford to shop there with Canadian or US funds. Just too darn expensive. Lastly, it does matter what someone else pays if they're getting a better deal. I want the same deal. Canadian or no Canadian. What happens after I spent the money doesn't matter. It's how I shop and spend my money. No sense in pi$$ing it away. Gotta buy bait too, ya know."

Either way, we as the consumer NEVER get the full exchange rate as the government post daily. The best we got was going over to Fort Erie, Ontario years ago (12 mile ride) and exchange our US dollars to Canadian at the casino / race track they had there. At times it was as high as 58%....then I would let the wifey play $20 or so in the slot machine and many times she won enough to pay for our fishing licenses.......the trick then was to drag her out of there before she had a chance to lose it in the slot machine."
5266145,pjshorthorn,2017-01-12 07:11:00,5654,"You are correct. The poster referred to a transaction fee in his post. To your point, he would not save hundreds of dollars on not being charged a transaction fee on each purchase. My point is that his CC company converts his transactions into US dollars at their exchange rate at the time of purchase. That rate is decided by the CC card and is quite favorable compared to exchanging hard currency at a casino. That is comparing minnows to night crawlers......no one will ever get a full exchange as published by the market, but CC transactions are much more favorable than exchanging hard currency at Homer's House of Bait or a casino, not to mention you don't have to carry cash along on your trip. PjShorthorn"
5266177,Bobby Winds,2017-01-12 07:26:00,10817,"I agree with everything you posted above, but believe it or not the casino gave better exchange rates then credit cards or banks to get you into the casino. They knew most were going to lose it anyways. The casino is only 2 miles from the City of Buffalo.........they closed it a few years ago to lack of US customers since the Indians were able to open their casinos on our side of the border. But when they were open just about EVERYONE I knew that went north on vacations went to the casino for the exchange rate which I believe was the full rate back in the day.

5266409,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-12 09:13:00,461,Ask your lodge owner for the exchange. We get the best rate around. Better than cards and usually withing .001 of the spot rate you see on-line. Happy to help we are...
5270722,mickr,2017-01-14 14:12:00,74,"You Americans ask some funny questions some times. No a Canadian resort would not refuse Canadian funds. Most of the traffic on this site seems to be Americans that vacation in NW Ontario at lodges that market to and cater to Americans. My sense is that if the lodge owner is targeting American clientele and let's say 90% of the business is American, and repeat American business for that matter, they price their service in American dollars so that Americans know what it will cost them. that way, a thousand bucks is a thousand bucks. It doesn't leave you wondering every year ""how much will my vacation cost this year"" The lodge owner has to turn the currency around and report in Canadian funds for tax purposes. They have to pay in Canadian funds for all the products / food they buy that gets consumed. And I certainly expect that in certain years when the exchange rates are what they are this year for example, the lodge owner has a dip in revenue from Canadian clients. A few years ago the Canadian buck was worth more than the US buck and Canadians might have been paying say 950 bucks for that 1000 dollar vacation. With the exchange rate being what it now is, that vacation might be say 1350 and many Canadians might say ""that's too much"" so it makes sense that there is a dip in revenue. That's NW Ontario. I live in eastern Ontario and fish lodges in eastern Ontario and in Quebec. In my experience, very very few lodges in this area charge in US currency and as the guy that does all the bookings for my group, I don't frequent lodges that do charge in US currency."
5270762,rzep,2017-01-14 14:36:00,1196,I figure that by now every American owns a smartphone and can use calculator to figure out US cost....Some of us do not even need the calculator.... 😁......No need to make us feel that multiplying two numbers is a privilege reserved for Canadians...
5270778,3M TA3,2017-01-14 14:47:00,2846,"Oh, now you've done it. The actual saying has to do with gold and feathers. And so. There are 28.35 grams to an ounce of feathers. There are 31.1 grams to an ounce of gold. Gold is measured in Troy ounces and is also sold as Troy ounces. I would be happy to sell you gold at a 5% discount if you're willing to accept it at 28.35 grams per ounce. Then you can tell me that an ounce of gold is equal to an ounce of feathers. OK sorry. Highjack."
5270818,3M TA3,2017-01-14 15:04:00,2846,"Well Ted. Here is something for you to think about. Having a good time doesn't even come to play here. I have never been there so I don't have a record of what a good time is. I am comparing prices and gambling on whether I'll have a good time or not. If I've done my homework and find that you're going to charge me 30% more than my Canadian fishing buddy, for what ever reason, I'll continue to shop around, and you'll never get a dime from me. By the way, I have duel citizenship, so now what? You've explained some great reasons for charging different prices but you didn't explain why someone would charge me more just because I've come from someplace else. Also, if I was informed that someone next to me on the plane paid less than me, I'd find out why and make sure next time I have the same consideration granted to me, at least try. If not I'll shop elsewhere. Your comparison of choosing a plane seat and choosing a lodge makes me laugh. It really does."
5265081,Obabikon,2017-01-11 14:09:00,2370,"Again, so you call one resort to find out what the general practice was? Seems like out of the thousands and thousands of resorts in Ontario... one might not be an adequate sample size. You don't want to assume that he's the only one doing this, but you're willing to assume that all the others do it? I gave you a perfectly fine reason why he might be willing to give Canadians a discount... trying to encourage more Canadian business. Again, this is not my practice. I may give Canadians a favorable exchange... since I have bills in Canada, and it would eliminate all banking exchange fees by doing so. However, 30% is much more than I would discount. I would say you found a guy who loves Canadians, and his offer isn't the norm."
5265105,Obabikon,2017-01-11 14:31:00,2370,"This law is designed to protect people from being charged more than the posted (agreed to) price. It also protects them from being refused business simply because of any of the attributes listed. It does not guarantee people discounts given to others. The reason I'm nearly positive that this is not applicable is because of ""age"". This law would make it illegal to give a 13 year old a discounted trip, while an adult would pay full price. Expand that... it would be illegal to have youth tickets to any service (movies, amusement parks, live shows). It would be illegal for life insurance companies to charge different prices based on age. It would also be illegal for all ""senior"" discounts."
5265137,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-11 14:51:00,447,"Years ago I had a solo Ontario trip planned that I had to back out of several months prior due to an unexpected financial hardship I called the resort, explained my situation and asked if I could apply my deposit to a trip the following year. Owner said NO which I fully understood and didn't contest but then he reamed me out for backing out. I'm glad to hear that the resort owners who have responded in this thread are a little more understanding. My viewpoint on owners giving discounts and what currency they charge me is that they can operate their business as they see fit. If I feel I will get good value for my money I will give them my business. If not, I will go somewhere else. What others pay is of no concern to me."
5265169,LOW1,2017-01-11 15:07:00,2828,"Ontario's age discrimination doesn't kick in until age 18 and includes specific exceptions for senior discounts. And actuaries will tell you that young people are sometimes more expensive to insure (car insurance) and sometimes less expensive to insure (health insurance).The rest of your argument is a real tough one to make. Sometimes substituting the name of the protected class helps. For example, instead of saying ""I want to charge Canadians less so that I can build my Canadian business"" try saying ""I want to charge white people less so that I can build my white persons' business.""I am not suggesting that you would ever do such a thing, but a protected class is a protected class."

This may seem naïve, but I figure my cost is my cost. My dollars, my dollars. So, if the camp makes some extra money due to the exchange rate, I am fine with that. Most camp owners are not getting rich. Kind of like farmers. They don't make a lot annually, but hopefully, when they retire, the land/camp prices when they sell are enough to equip them with a good retirement nest egg. I am an ol' Iowa boy, so I reckon I will stick with my thinking. I do, on the other hand, use my US credit card for everything I buy in Canada, gas, food, motel, incidentals, groceries, etc. My Cabelas Visa does not charge me much for foreign transactions, and I save myself a couple of hundred bucks every trip. Would rather pay the camp owners than the gas stations..."
5266017,Bobby Winds,2017-01-12 06:25:00,10817,"HTH do you save hundreds of dollars on EACH Canadian trip by Cabela's not charging a transaction fee.........you do know this is not the exchange rate but rather a fee this is usually 1.5% or less. So on a $5000 Canadian trip that would calculate out to $75 at most. I do agree on using a Credit Card that does not charge a foreign transaction fee and also own a Cabela's card for years but was not aware they did not charge a foreign transaction fee, so I looked it up. They actually do charge a 1% fee so your savings on said $5000 trip would only be $50 total. Scroll down to ""FEES"".....http://www.cabelas.com/custserv/cust...cabelasclub_tc BTW on my Capital One Venture Card there is no foreign fee and I get 2% on EVERYTHING I purchase. Since I got this card a couple of years ago I no longer use my Cabela's card that only gives 1% on none Cabela's purchases and then can only be used at Cabela's."
5266033,Bobby Winds,2017-01-12 06:27:00,10817,I would also like to say that most lodges / camps in Canada that only charge US dollars are usually owned by Americans and that is why they do that. I also notice not many Canadian lodge owners responded to the OP's question.

5264681,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-11 10:04:00,461,"Did you have a great time on your trip? If so what other people pay should be of little consequence and diminish that enjoyment. Lodge owners (of which I am one) cut deals ALL the time for many different reasons. First off is dynamic or variable pricing that many lodge owners employ as part of their business model. Just like the airlines, or hotels the further out you book the better price you get. It is also based on occupancy load. Once load hits a certain percentage rates go up. The closer we get to an open week potentially the price drops. We need to keep buts in beds. That simple. That could mean giving great deals to people on the fence, or families, or people down on their luck. Or going the other way with up-charges for people that demand private bedrooms or other items. Its a business. Do you sit down in your airplane seat and ask the guy next to you how much they paid? And if they paid a lot less get off the plane and not travel? Of course not. Why would you do the same at a lodge. You were having a great time at that lodge until you found out you paid more than another customer? Business 101."
5264721,Kartman35,2017-01-11 10:21:00,245,"What we're talking about here is different pricing being applied specifically for the same services at the same booking time for two different GROUPS OF PEOPLE. As a Canadian I can enjoy a 30% discount for the same trip, booked on the same day. We're not talking about last minute deals or seasonal discounts here. A lodge owner who offers a break to someone they know is suffering a financial hardship or to a friend of a friend is a nice guy and not at all relevant here. This is discrimination pure and simple."
5264729,Obabikon,2017-01-11 10:24:00,2370,"First off... I think it is strange that you would do that. Basically called an ""unnamed"" resort... with no interest in going, in order to try to see if you can get 30% off? Secondly, as a resort owner, I give discounts for lots of reasons. I usually give a large discount for people who are from my home town. I also like to give repeat guests a bit of a break. This one really might upset some... I've been known to completely donate trips to organizations that I like. Especially organizations that promote fishing with children. My point in even responding to this is that comparing a resort to a gas station is silly. It doesn't work that way. Each group comes with different circumstances. Each person costs me a different amount of money when they are there. Filling up a gas tank is exactly the same... every time. They can set their margins and just enjoy it. As far as you promoting Quebec goes... that is perfectly fine. I'm sure Quebec has many wonderful lakes and fisheries.

5264817,LOW1,2017-01-11 11:06:00,2828,"I don't know Canadian discrimination laws. In the US variable pricing is fine as long as it is not based on a ""protected category"" such as race, religion, etc.So if you want to lower your prices because you have a lot of vacant space to fill, that;s fine. Or to raise prices because there is a lot of demand, that too is fine. Of course, you should have and keep documentation showing what you did and why you did it.But if you charge a higher rate to Canadians than Americans because of their citizenship or because you want to help your fellow countryman you likely will have violated a number of local, state, and federal anti-discrimination laws."

I'd surely offer discounts to returning customers that were pleasant and treated/tipped my staff well also. But on what basis can you support the notion that American guests across the board will cost you more than Canadian guests? It's when you have a scenario that x group pays x and y group pays y that brings out the SJW in me. Should resort owners be allowed to charge more for certain races because they think they have more money? Less for others because they might have had less opportunity? By the way, most zones in Quebec allow 8 walleye...so you can keep 7, keep fishing and still have more walleye than most zones in Ontario I'll save you the trouble of pointing out that most of Quebec does have a dumb law that makes us keep skin on the whole fillet guaranteeing slimy tasting walleye..."

5265065,Shellback,2017-01-11 13:36:00,8083,That's a tough one. Not sure if rates or fees would fall under discrimination. I'm charged more by Ontario for my fishing license because I'm a US resident. Am I being discriminated against due to citizenship?
5265073,LOW1,2017-01-11 13:49:00,2828,Hard to see how a license could be a service?
5263937,Kartman35,2017-01-10 22:21:00,245,"Having read the thread asking for resorts that charge in Canadian I'm wondering how a resort owner in Canada can refuse payment in Canadian.Surely these resorts are open to Canadian fisherman...are they supposed to convert their currency to USD when vacationing in their own country? Are there separate rates for visitors from the US? How can that be legal???I can see resort owners offering to accept USD as a courtesy, but a Canadian resort must have a Canadian price and if the exchange rate makes paying in Canadian currency more advantageous than how can they refuse to accept their own country's legal tender??I've never heard of this before and it seems completely ridiculous to me.Any resort owners that can explain this??"
5263961,yoopertrout,2017-01-10 22:58:00,1172,"I'm not a resort owner, but it seems to me that resorts have a right to set the price as they want. If they say 1000 U.S., you can't roll in with Canadian, or pesos or dinars and expect one to one. I suspect, that when they get Canadian customers they accept Canadian, but at the current exchange rate."
5264129,martinbns,2017-01-11 05:44:00,1520,"Overwelmingly the customers are Americans, I fished out of two lodges last year and negotiated a price in Canadian dollars. The first was opening weekend which is our May long weekend, but the week before the US one. We were one of three groups in a lodge that could hold 100 or more. We paid roughly the US price in Canadian dollars, but the lodge was empty. The second was the last week of july which isn't primetime and we paid somewhere close to the same before exchange, but again the lodge wasn't full. In both cases, we were the only Canadians there. Most Canadian fishermen are cheap and can fish the lake without the lodge's help. Unless you live in Southern Ontario, there is so much water to fish using public launches etc we won't pay a premium for a place to stay."
5264137,Shellback,2017-01-11 05:45:00,8083,"I'd bet that as long as the Canadian tax man is getting his correct cut, the govt doesn't care what currency a lodge uses. I'd be curious if some lodges charging in US $ give Canadian residents a break. Especially if they had been long time clients. In reality a Canadian would be paying close to 30% or more now, than 4 or 5 years ago. I say that because a couple years ago when the rates flipped, I mentioned to a Canadian at the lodge that it must have cost him a lot more that year. His answer was no. These were long time clients. I doubt any lodge owner would fess up to it as it sure would put him in a bad situation with American clients. But I can also understand him taking care of long time clients."
5264249,Baseline,2017-01-11 06:49:00,3207,"A few years ago I asked that specific question to a resort owner at Lac Suel. I pulled into a dock at a resort (I was not a guest) and filled my gas tank. The per liter gas price was clearly posted on a big sign pointed toward the lake. When I went to pay I pulled out Canadian and was informed that the resort only accepted US. I asked what Canadians do and he replied that he rarely gets anyone who comes off the lake to buy anything, and if they do, they are from the States like me. So I guess the owner can make his own rules. Besides who are you going to call to force the guy to take Canadian. On a more positive note most of the resort owners are so customer friendly that I am sure they would take a YEN from a group of fisherman if they could exchange it."
5264305,rzep,2017-01-11 07:26:00,1196,"When US was close to CAN..,I used currency interchangeably at gas stations, restaurants etc.....once they drifted apart,I noticed some places would give change back as everything was still on par. When asked was told this was the policy. So now I use credit card for everything whether paying for my Resort stay or bag of chips and soda at the gas station. My CC does not charge me for foreign transactions so it is all good ."
5264337,pjshorthorn,2017-01-11 07:30:00,5654,"There are many folks who own resort property (ies ) in foreign countries where they may not be residents full time or have established residency of any kind. They can charge whatever currency they choose to accommodate their client base wishes, as well as , their personal financial needs in order to make a business model work; unless laws regulate that practice differently in the said country. I have paid Canadian dollars to resort owners who are Canadian, I have paid US dollars to resort owners who are Canadian, I have paid US dollars to resort owners in Canada who are American, I have paid US dollars to resort owners in Mexico who are American, I have paid US dollars to resort owners in Mexico who are Mexican, I have paid pesos to resort owners in Mexico who are Mexican. When I get to take bucket list fishing trips to Austrialia and Costa Rica, I will expect to pay either in the country's currency or in US dollars. That is the norm in most cases. The whole concept of what currency one will pay is pretty simple. The currency published and agreed upon with the resort owner is the currency they will accept . If one doesn't have that aspect in writing from the resort, shame on the person who is paying the bill. PjShorthorn"
5264577,Kartman35,2017-01-11 09:19:00,245,"If you were in Canada, and asked the guy to fill up, and the price was indicated but not the currency, and after filling up you were told that it was USD, I really can't see how this would be legal. If they're so interested in appealing to American customers why quote the price in litres vs gallons??In general you can call the Ontario better business bureau or Ontario consumer protection, but in your case, I'd have handed him canadian funds and taken off and let HIM figure out who to call.(Unless there's a sign saying USD and even then he'd have to take Canadian funds at the days current exchange rate)"
5264641,Obabikon,2017-01-11 09:52:00,2370,"I have never heard of a resort not accepting Canadian currency. The gas issue is about the same. Our price is in USD's... however, I remind everyone off the lake of that prior to pumping. I'm not sure it would be illegal... but it would be a dumb business practice. I do charge in US, but as many have pointed out... I will take a fare price of anything that I can convert. Payment is payment. I may charge a little more for handling euros, yen or pesos than I would USD or Canadian, simply because it would cost me time and money to exchange them... but believe me, I will take it. It's like the old riddle... what's heavier 10 LBS of feathers or 10 LBS of lead. They weigh the exact same. One just takes more to reach the same result."
5264649,Kartman35,2017-01-11 09:54:00,245,"I just called a random lodge on Lac Seul whose website advertises in USD. Explained that I'm from Quebec and wondering if I'd have to get my money exchanged to pay for a trip there. The answer totally shocked me...He said that for his Canadian clients (of which he gets very few) he charges the same rate in Canadian that you guys pay in US...""For my fellow countrymen"". As an American I'd never be able to enjoy my vacation knowing I'm getting fleeced for 30% of my trip versus other guests enjoying the same services. Choose your outfitters carefully or just come to Quebec where everything is charged in Canadian funds. We have good fishing too."
