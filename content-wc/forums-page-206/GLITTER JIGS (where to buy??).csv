5288154,wallydave,2017-01-23 21:14:00,2151,"PM Mike Kansas, he is Sirmanski lures. Last I heard, the website had been hacked. He made some jigs for a group fishing Red Lake out of Black Bear Lodge! Good jigs, the glitter jigs work great!"
5292890,jkwildhunting,2017-01-26 00:41:00,361,"As stated earlier pro tec has a ""disco"" powder out. http://www.tjstackle.com/PowderPaintDisco.htm 9 different colors. I have used all 9 and they come out pretty good. I put a UV blast clear coat on after I dip the jig in my choice of color. Pop them in your toaster oven to cure and you have a paint that will take a beating against those rocks up north. Like what was mentioned also you can get some clear coat and some glitter and go that route. The disco paint really has made it easier and those colors really pop in the sun. Good luck any questions feel free to send a pm."

My son likes using them and I wanna make sure I have some for this spring. (Or perhaps you may have advice on making them?) Thanks for any reply! Chuck Bearfvr 160 days and counting!!!"
5269130,Pooch,2017-01-13 15:06:00,4618,"I just came from Home Depot paint section and I noticed all the ""glitter"" rattle cans they have. I'm curious if they would work on jigs or maybe even add some ""glitter"" (stuff that some younger women sprinkle on their face). Spray the jig then sprinkle it on. I think I might have some of glitter (for powder coating) I bought from Lure Parts Online a few years ago. Gotta go look....Store bought glitter jigs shouldn't be that hard to come by.Pooch"
5269186,revitup,2017-01-13 15:26:00,140,Hutch's jigs. We've used them for several years now and really like them. Can be found at: riverwalleyes.com
5269226,The tank,2017-01-13 15:52:00,340,I buy clear finger nail polish with glitter in it and paint over the color I want to be a glitter jig. I mostly paint pink jigs with gold glitter.
5269994,DavKin,2017-01-14 05:08:00,104,Try www.customjigs.com Go the H2O precision jig tab. Hooks are strong plus they have a nice keeper. Dave
5270026,Fishoil,2017-01-14 05:44:00,1277,Pro-tec makes powder paints with glitter in them and also has glitter that can be added to clear as an overcoat. I've used some of the glitter colors and they go on very well and hold up to the abuse that a jig is subject to. On crankbaits I've used glitter nail polish or glitter flakes from my kids' craft supplies with clear nail polish. Either one works well and would look good on jigs but I think durability would be a problem.
