5282154,packpro,2017-01-20 16:39:00,695,"Pictured below. 6"" Purple Tiger Powerbait. Can't find them any more. I think they have been replaced by the Ripple Shad. I loaded up on them back then so no need to replace yet. Used this bait with a weighted hook. 2009 trip- it caught the largest walleye, pike, and small mouth on the trip. It selects for bigger fish. Lots of 35""-39"" pike casting to shore. Last year while fishing for smallies it caught a small 33' Musky. Love its versatility for multi species. Also love the endurance. Threw it every day into a lot of cover and only used two all week. We use jig and minnow predominately, but their is always a bait caster rigged and ready with this lure to break up the monotony."

5282754,Joek3,2017-01-21 06:10:00,244,My fav is a 1/4 oz VMC swim bait jig head (blueish/green color) with either a Keitech Fat swim impact or a Reaction Innovation swim bait. Always lean towards the shad colors.
5284090,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-21 20:52:00,447,Thanks to all who responded. I'm going to order a few of the baits mentioned and test them out.
5284354,a3dad,2017-01-22 07:09:00,115,"Great reading for this winter Sunday morning. Thanks everyone! What do you think of something like this? Lixada 8"" / 20cm 66g Lifelike Multi-jointed 8-segement Pike. Very often see pike chasing other pike."
5284442,Hawker,2017-01-22 08:02:00,3967,"I've been using several of the varied swim baits others have suggested the past couple three years with great success on my forays to LOTW. You will have fun with the Pike (and other species) with them! I've tried several hook, jig head options with them but my all time favorite to use hasn't been listed or shown so thought I'd share. Even though it's not touted for swimbait usage, it works great in open water, heavy cover (weeds, trees, rocks etc) and shallow water. (http://www.cabelas.com/product/Gene-...A&gclsrc=aw.ds) To be honest, I found a guy to make these for me now at a much better price point and I know if one does some looking around there are several aftermarket spin-offs of this head available as well. I like them because with the pivoting hook, the swimbait has a lot more action and the fact they are virtually weedless."
5284554,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-22 09:06:00,447,"I'm definitely going to check those out. You're right, small pike are on the menu when there are big pike around. I've caught pike in the low 30"" range that have wounds from a bigger pike grabbing them. Here's some fun video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXuyal4WQL8"
5284602,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-22 09:18:00,447,"Thanks, I've seen those jig heads, or some similar, and wanted to try them. You mentioned the increased action, that's exactly what I'm looking for. Good tail action and good body wobble. I've tried a few baits that didn't have any action on slow to moderate speed retrieves due to poor design or plastic that's too stiff."
5280138,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-19 17:22:00,447,"I've used 3 and 4"" swimbaits with decent success on bass and northerns on my home waters. I particularly like the Berkeley Ripple Shads because of the good tail action combined with a body wobble that looks great in the water. Some brands don't have great tail action at slower retrieve speeds. Looking to use some bigger baits for trophy bass and pike both at home and north of the border. Big Hammer looks like a possibility. Anyone have a favorite large swimbait and what hook/jig do you find works well with the larger baits. Thanks"
5280186,Mike Borger,2017-01-19 17:32:00,1554,"The Ripple Shads are awesome, I slayed fish with them on a number of trips last year. 31/2"" size for walleye, 5"" size for pike and lakers.But I don't really classify those as swimbaits because they're a solid bodied plastic. 51/2-6"" hollow bodied paddle tails are lethal rigged in a variety of different ways. There are so many on the market and quite honestly they all work, but I use Basstrix paddle tails and Yum Money Minnows quite a bit."
5280258,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-19 18:13:00,447,"That's an interesting distinction I hadn't heard before. I've heard paddle tails, flap tails, twister tails, etc, solid or hollow, referred to as swimbaits. Why the distinction and what do you call baits like Ripple Shads, which I agree are awesome. Thanks for the tip on the Basstrix baits."
5280282,clawman,2017-01-19 18:28:00,2078,"I use the Z-Man baits for walleye. http://zmanfishing.com/store/categor...diezel_minnowzTell you what, you put this bait on a Owner head with the wire holder and a drop of super glue they will last ALL day long. Super tough and the 'eyes eat it up!"
5280498,bthomas3333,2017-01-19 19:47:00,465,The largest Yum Money Minnows work great for pike. The issue I have is they are SO soft the pike destroy them within 4-5 fish and at 10 bucks per box of 5 it can get really pricey. Brett
5280810,Mike Borger,2017-01-20 05:13:00,1554,"I consider the Ripple Shad simply a paddletail plastic, not unlike a Mister Twister Sassy Shad or a Northland Impulse. What I like about them is the wider profile they have - often the fish seem to prefer it.Those plastics are too heavy imo to be considered a swimbait. The hollow bodied versions are way lighter, and rigged with a light swimbait hook can be worked dead slow.Of course that is my opinion only so take it with a grain of salt.

5281634,tsquared,2017-01-20 12:24:00,57,"I have used the Berkley Powerbait Saltwater Shad. Definitely a more rigid bait and takes the beating pretty well. I have used the big hammer swimbaits too, but I definitely prefer the Berkley over the big hammer. IMO the rigid body on the berkley gives the tail a harder wobble. I love casting to the edge of weedlines (or parallel along weedlines) and taking out to deeper water. Also, if I am jigging for walleye and getting bit off a lot, the berkley does a good job of finding the Northern stealing your bait. I have some hollow body swimbaits, but haven't built up the confidence in them yet, but based on others review will give them more time next year. Interesting thread - thanks."
5281922,KSjim,2017-01-20 14:15:00,88,"I have had very good luck with 5"" Big Hammers. They have been very durable and what I really like about them they seem to catch as many big walleye as big pike."
5281938,tsquared,2017-01-20 14:26:00,57,"That's one of the things I love about fishing, preferences of baits, etc, so much comes down to confidence in lures...I like watching Major League Fishing and they were fishing Lake of the Ozarks which I get to fish pretty often, so it was really interesting. People were fishing shallow, people were fishing deep docks and everything in between. Ultimately they all did one thing, fished what they had confidence in...."
5282074,Daveygravy,2017-01-20 15:57:00,88,"I like the Berkley havoc grass pig swimbait for alot of situations. Rig it on an owner head up to 1/2oz for fishing deeper cabbage or rig it on a weightless swimbait hook for fishing the slop for bass. Pearl is my best color. Another overlooked bait for pike is the slug o in the 6 inch size, it has a deadly darting action and can be fished weightless or with weight that you insert into the body."
