I guess water can run uphill.And, I can't believe the US/Canada hostility exhibited here. I'm glad I don't experience it when I visit the Provinces. The folks I meet seem decent and friendly."
514443,Guest,2001-08-16 19:08:00,0,Good post tyler. Thats what it all boils down to. Us bushcutters still like American tourists even though your government just slapped a 19% duty on Canadian wood thus putting a lot of the boys out of work.........LOL
514445,FOOTDOC,2001-08-16 19:36:00,139,"I really just thought this was an interesting fact that leeches SOLD is Canada are brought to the Candian bait stores from Minnesota. The price is insignificant or I would not have bought them. I guess the reason I liked buying them in the US is availability and selection of leech size. Apparently, the leeches SOLD in Canada are not sorted, whereas in the past, when I would bring leeches into Canada, I could go to a Minnesota bait store and SELECT whatever size leeches I wanted to buy. No, gentlemen, the cost of the leeches is definitely secondary especially when you see the cost of a dozen minnows at the Canadian camps."
514446,Ketchenanny,2001-08-17 09:34:00,38,"As an American who goes to Canada a couple of times per year, I would not want the hassle of keeping my bait alive during the road trip. As some of the posts state - stop in the local baitshops, buy your bait fresh and lively. After all, I don't think you would go into a dinner, order a cup of coffee, then pull out a sandwich that you brought from home. Enjoy your trip without added worries. Canada is a great country to enjoy."
514433,FOOTDOC,2001-08-14 06:12:00,139,"OK, I try to follow and respect all the rules and like to use leeches in LOTW jigging for walleye. So I take my annual 14 hour drive up to Morson and stop at the local bait store in Bergland to buy my leeches and the owner tells me she has them available. In fact, she tells me they JUST arrived from her distributor in MINNESOTA! This amazed me! Anyone who tells me they are restricting me from bringing leeches into Ontario for the ecology reasons will have to talk long and hard to convince me of this! Also, the leeches in Ontario were about $35/pound canadian. So, I get my leeches and I had also taken several dozen crawlers and son of a gun, the crawlers were much more successful. I just found this interesting and maybe you will too!"
514434,Guest,2001-08-14 07:25:00,0,"You should hear this one, our supplyer of leaches in Alberta gets them from Saskatchewan but when we go to a tournement in Saskatchewan we cant take them across the provincial border.We have to buy them there."
514435,Guest,2001-08-15 07:55:00,0,"Rules are rules. They are in place for a reason, protection of water. Why do you drive 14 hours to fish in Canada? Because the fishing is awesome. Why??? Rules and regulations.Live bait bought out of province have different Microbiology, so the introduction of a new Microb can wipe out a lake practically.Ever hear of Zebra mussels, enough said!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
514436,Xplorer,2001-08-15 09:12:00,244,"md, Understand your postion and determination to protect the fisheries completly, but why is it OK for bait dealers in Ontario to buy leeches from ""out of province"" and sell them? I know awhile back on a similar thread someone said that dealers were given a two year exemption to find/establish leech suppliers in Ontario. Well the leech ban is in its second or third summer, and leeches are still coming to bait dealers from Minnesota. This seems like a double standard. Is there any microbilogical difference if I bring a pound of raised leeches from Minn. to fish with or if that same pound is shipped to Morson for resale? I understand the need to protect from exotics, I live/fish on Lake Superior and deal with spiny water fleas, zebra's, ruffe and goby, but I dont see what kind of protection the rule provides for now.

514437,Guest,2001-08-15 09:52:00,0,"gee whiz , don't do us any favours and spend more than the cost of the lodge in Canada, bring your own American beer and food and worms, leeches, That way you will almost feel like your in your own country..... Give us a break and stop at a local bait shop , get to know the locals and what tackle has been working on the water and develop a repore and appreciation for Canadian culture by getting involved. Just be happy free trade allows leeches to come into Canada . To bad free trade doesn't allow us to sell our lumber to you without 19% tarrifs now !!. Its only ""free trade"" when USA gets their way."
514439,Peanut,2001-08-15 10:22:00,929,"I must agree, on the surface, it seems to not make much sense.I had similar experience, in reverse. We were crossing the border into the US, when the guard asked if we had any fruit (routine question). One of our group had brought along a couple of oranges to snack on. The guard said they could not be brought into the US, and threw them into the garbage can beside her. We got a chuckle out of the whole episode, because the oranges were FLORIDA ORANGES!But, back to the leech thing - In asked a gov't enviroment guy what's the problem with a guy's own out-of province leeches, if what we buy here is from the same place.The answer was simple - the out-of-prov. leeches that are allowed to be sold as bait come from a tested and confirmed safe source. So, the enviro guys know if only these ""approved"" leeches are used, no contamination will occur.He said the leeches you want to bring in may be safe - but they are not sure, and cannot possibly test everyone, and it's not worth the risk. Also, even if yours were confirmed safe, if they let you bring in your own, they have to let everyone, and then who knows what problems may be brought in - all control is lost.So, it's not so much where they're from geographically, but it's ensuring that all bait used comes from safe suppliers.I hope this provides some clarification.derrek.CANADIAN WALLEYE OPEN UP AND SAY ""EH""!"
514440,Guest,2001-08-15 10:41:00,0,"I am an american who goes to canada ever year and I say Just buy the damm leeches in canada. Do you really need to save a few bucks that badly. I am not rich but I think i can spend 10 extra bucks to support the local economy. Everyone knows if the roles were reveresed every bait shop in MN. would lobby the gov. to ban bait coming in from canada. I doubt that the excuse of ""bad leeches"" is the reason for americans not being allowed to bring them in. Lets call a spade a spade. The real reason is to help the canadian merchants and there nothing wrong with that becasue as I said before if the roles were reveresed we would do the same. we may even use the same bogus excuse. As my father used to say to me ""Just shut up and fish""."
514438,Guest,2001-08-15 15:30:00,0,"hey dm. how are you going to stop the zebra mussels and the gobys from entering lotw when the water feeding into it comes from lake superior. you do have a beautiful country and you should be proud of it, but dont try to act like we bring undesireable species into canada. remember we share a common boundry. its called the great lakes. and nobody that i know of in the usa asked to have them brought in. they are both of our countrys problem, and i hope they get some resolution to the problem. good fishing to all. pepe"
514441,bigfish1965,2001-08-15 21:33:00,3210,I heard that the leeches bought in the U.S. for export to Canada are each handwashed and disinfected to prevent giving our bloodsuckers unknown microbes. ;-)
514442,Guest,2001-08-16 09:38:00,0,"I'm not saying were perfect far from it, but the Ministry of Natural resources is trying hard to keep the fishing great. Admitted they make mistakes, but it's not out of ignorance it's out of trying.You can't complain too much so far. All I'm saying is, is it worth all this trouble for a couple of bucks. You've just travelled 14 hours and your worried about a couple bucks, MAKES NO SENSE TO ME!Tight and wet that's the best!!!!"
