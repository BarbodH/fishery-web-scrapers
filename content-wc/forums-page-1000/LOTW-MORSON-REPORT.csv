The staff there is great and the food is excellent. The fishing is always a challenge for a person who shows up once a year. The kids liked fishing for northerns in the Obabikon bay and we found it no problem to take and release 100 northerns daily. The largest of the northerns was 38"" and hit while casting a large Mepp's Muskie bucktail spinner. It was caught by my 17 year old and he has been tough to live with. Northern fishing was awesome and lively. Walleyes were pretty cooperative but the kids don't have as much patience for jigging as casting. Found my eyes off of rock points in Miles bay just northeast of Garden Island. They seemed to be in about 19-20' of water. Caught a ton of dinks but still had nice fish to bring home and also for shore lunch. Crawlers were also great and a nice alternative with minnows being over three dollars a dozen. Overall, another great four days in LOTW and my family and I appreciate the resorce. Now if they would only quit messing with all the rules and regulations long enough for a person to understand and get used to them!"
514429,PJM,2001-08-14 21:28:00,3516,FOOTDOCWhen you say you were fishing rock points NE of Garden Island were you fishing A 21ft rock pile or right by Garden Island. Where in Obabikon Bay were you fishing Northerns and did you catch and crappies. I love that lake and I am going up there in the beginning of September and 1st of October and I am always looking for new spots............

Give the basin trolling a shot, with #9 Raps and T-sticks. That is mostly what we have done in the past ten years. This has given up many nice to big eyes (23-30"") as well as some numbers (16-20""). Due to everyone's schedule we have taken a closer location for this August, but will be up there again next year.Good Luck"
514431,PJM,2001-08-15 20:18:00,3516,DeeZee Thank's for responding to my post and as you know there is a lot of water on that lake and every time i go there I try to learn new spots. When you say the basin I am not sure where you are talking and how deep. I know people fish the rock reefs kinda west of Buena Vista are you talking out there. or are you talking in the middle of Obabikon bay. Now you got me curious.
514432,FOOTDOC,2001-08-16 19:46:00,139,"We caught our northerns in the Obabikon itself. As you know, you have to pass thru the narrows to enter the Obabikon. As you go thru the narrows and get past the FIRST island, you turn east to head toward the elbow. Right after you circle the FIRST island and head east, look to the south and you will see a wide, expansive area that eventually leads to weedy, rice bays. If you look on a hot spots map, notice that bay swings all the way around and goes further to the east. We actually enter this large weedy bay from the FURTHEST point east and work our way back, casting spinner baits and Mepp's bucktail muskie killers. As far as the walleyes in Miles Bay, we fished all the way up near Thompson's creek. Not in Thompson's creek, but slightly west of there. There is a creek (not Thompson's) the actually visually drains and spills over into LOTW. Right out in front of that creek in 19-22' of water was productive using crawlers and 1/8 ounce jigs in orange or chartruse. Please let me know if I can provide any further information. Also, a partial crawler worker best, not the whole thing!"
