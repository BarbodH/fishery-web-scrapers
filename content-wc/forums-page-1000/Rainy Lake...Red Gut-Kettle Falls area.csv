We will be very close to the new cabin that Gary put up several years ago since his last one by the lake blew up!!Several of us love to fish for different species, but will concentrate on walleyes.Although we have fished the area several years ago, we are not too familiar with what works best and where the best areas are.Any help on what works best and where to go would be greatly appreciated!! Like I said, I'll try for any specie that is biting. In order of preference: walleye, northern, smallies, crappie .muskie has to be thrown in there also, but the guys that I fish with do not like to throw the hardware Â– I would go out by myself for MR. M .."
