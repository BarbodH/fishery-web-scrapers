514310,Guest,2001-08-06 17:57:00,0,"I see you have asked about rough rock. Are you staying on rough rock? Is this the minaki area that you are looking for? I myself leave on the 16th of august. I am staying in gun lake at barbers. I have fished this system for years. You will find the walleyes to be in deep cool water. I think you will be up the week of the gary roach tourney. There willbe a lot of boats. There are no secrets on this system. I have found green ,pickeral, to be very good producers. I have gps#'s if you would like drop me a line. Do you do any musky fishing?lots of luck, please post when you return. thanks bill"
514311,jvfisherman,2001-08-18 21:25:00,15,Just got back from the winnepeg River system. The fishing was good. The walleyes were in 35-40ft in heavy current. Got a few over 24 inches. Got plenty of Musky follows and caught 2. All in all a great trip.
