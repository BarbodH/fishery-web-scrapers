If you're thinking of riding the train, be prepared for delays. We rode the train and it was 3 or 4 hours late on the way in. Not nearly as bad going home, maybe an hour late. The cabins were not very fancy either. You don't spend much time in them anyway, but they just weren't real nice. As for the fishing: Walleyes are everywhere. Very easy to find, and lots of 'em. We caught a lot of fish between 16-20 inches. We go very early in the year, so big fish are not caught very often. I'd say our biggest fish was 25 or 26 inches. If your planning on casting for northerns, don't waste your time. They are practically non-existant. Overall I'd give the fishing a B. Arguably the best walleye lake I've ever been to, and at the same time, the worst northern lake I've been to. They catch a few whitefish out of that lake too. If you do try the lake, be careful if you get out of the main river channel, there are rocks the size of boxcars just under the surface, and they are not always marked. Feel free to E-Mail me if you have any questions. Good Luck!"

We caught numerous pike while trolling for walleye with my biggest one being 42"", 15 minutes later my wife caught one 37"". We caught alot of 20 to 24 inch walleye. Check out their website at flindtlandingcamp.com, I'm the guest from Indiana with the 42"" pike and the huge grin on my face. It was the best Canadian trip we have had. E-mail me if you have more questions. We are going back up there next summer."
