I'l be staying at Euler's Camp near Vermillion Bay.Also, are there any special restrictions on the lake, other than no night fishing? Is trolling permitted?Thanks for any helpRegards"
514454,Guest,2001-08-14 16:42:00,0,"Returned from a week on Eagle Sat(11th). 90 degrees most of the week and the bite was slow during mid day but good early and late. We fished out of Vermilion Bay also and caught most of our larger fish in 26-28' off round and strawberry Islands but expect most Islands with structure and access to that depth of water would produce. Fish in that depth were all ""slotters"" and over. Eating fish came from 15' along weed lines and averaged 15"".No special regulations I'm aware of. Check slot size as that seems to vary from lake to lake. In Eagle it's 18 to 23"" for walleye. No night fishing but can fish from 1/2 hour before sunrise to 1/2 hour after. Your camp should have ""official"" sunrise and sunset times. (last day we were there sun sat at 8:45 thus we had to stop at 9:15) Again the best bite for us was 6-9pm and really did not start until 7.(thats when the locals came out) Early was probably also good but our group was hard to raise in the morning after a night of cards.Have a good trip!"
514455,Guest,2001-08-14 17:20:00,0,"Yes trolling is ok and thats the method that worked best for us. Nightcrawlers seemed to work the best, leeches next and minnows the slowest. Plain or colored hooks fished on the bottom seemed to out perform spinners but both worked. Tried trolling some cranks but didn't stay with it long enough to know if it would work. Needed to be on the bottom with live bait and I expect cranks as well."
514456,Dave in Mpls,2001-08-15 14:04:00,2336,"Thank you for the report, Larry. I'm bringing a flat of crawlers, so that is what I plan on using primarily. I am also becomming a trolling fanatic, so will throw some of that in as well. I'm sure I'll also make a run across nearly the entire lake and spend a day in Osborne Bay looking for some toothy critters!Thanks againRegards"
514457,Darren B,2001-08-16 12:42:00,13,"Dave, It's been a while since I've fished that side of the lake..but when we did we had pretty good luck around the Strawberry Island area like Larry suggested. Lots of pike around the 28-30 inch mark caught around the deep weedlines around the island trolling spoons, Rapala Magnum crankbaits and jointed Pikie minnows with the west side of the isle bieng the most productive for us. Also caught a musky in the area."
