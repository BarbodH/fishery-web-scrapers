514476,Ketchenanny,2001-08-15 14:11:00,38,How about just one hot-spot?
514477,Guest,2001-08-17 06:21:00,0,"Ketchenennyyou don't give up do you, good trait for an angler!As for hotspots I am not happy lately on only small walleye coming out of Whitefish Lake. I hear there is a combination Salmon Walleye Derby in Wawa area at end of the month, We will see what local lake gets the big ones bitingExtreme drought past 5 weeks slowed down walleye evening fishing but last night Algoma region got tons of rain so perhaps finally the bigones will come on bite. I have a week off to try day and night now."
514478,Ketchenanny,2001-08-17 09:11:00,38,Just thought I would try one more time. Hope the bite improves for you. Rain & cool weather should help. Down here on Lake St. Clair the walleye are going crazy in numbers and size. Just had to slow down to a drift and a plain nightcrawler on a 4 inch drop is doing the trick for me right now. You might want to try the same.Tight lines and hope see you next June.
