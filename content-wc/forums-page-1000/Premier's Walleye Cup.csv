If so, how did you catch them, and whats ection of the river? We were unable to find them, and ended up with around 11 pounds. Im heading up there in a week, so any tips you have would be great.!Joker"

Boy it's always hard to put together two days. We prefished the day before and had an honest 15+ pounds.But it was just hard to find those 2.5 to 4 pound fish. Oh well, you fishing the Vanity on late sept. We are hopefully we can win it. well see ya later."

I dont want a secret spot, just general...i.e. eagle's nest on live bait rigs in 15 feet.All our fish came from just past the white rock in 15-20 feet on live bait rigs, leeches, and 7 foot snells. We als had a good couple days of pre-fish, but it definetly is tough to get the fish just under the slot.Good to here from you!Joker"
