514515,Hawgeye,2001-08-17 09:28:00,1355,"Depending on what part of the river you are fishing, have several assortments of 1/4 oz to 3/4 oz jigs with plenty of Chertreuse, white, and black. You'll want to slip with the current keeping your line at less than a 30 degree angle. Tip them with a good sized minnow. Also if you anchor, try an earie dearie tipped with a minnow and flip it out into the current and slide it back into the eddie water. I will be at Traverse bay the last weekend of September to early October for my first trip and the next will be the weekend of Oct 20th. Anyone else. I have a White Pro-V with a 125HP Merc..."
514516,Guest,2001-08-19 07:12:00,0,I'll be up there the last week of Sept also. Last year we trolled shad raps and did well.
514517,Guest,2001-08-20 08:32:00,0,"My advice would be to pull #8 or #9 Shad Raps over the flats in Traverse Bay. If the weather/wind conditions prohibit you from getting out in the bay I would jig Red Northland Fire Ball's over current breaks and humps in the river, tipped with a 3 to 4 inch live minnow."
