Our trip was horrible, motors that didn't fit boats, bear attack, bears all over, boat sank, mediocre fishing. Our cabin had nothing but filth, no generator, horrible roads etc.However, about three years ago I met some guys in Dryden that said they were going there, and had been there and they couldn't believe my story, so things must of changed. Don't take my word for it, because, as I said, that was 14 years ago. Been going to Gull Rock ever since."
