513963,Guest,2001-07-17 15:32:00,0,Hello MelonbobWe were at the camp ground last week and fished the lake at the mine that you told me about last winter also fished a couple of other lakes in the bush. Son-in-law caught a good fat 40 inch pike and a good number of smaller eyes.Do you have any of the details of the drowning on Dog- I think it was one of the outfitters there.I asked arouond about you while there but the locals must not know you as MB.Thanks for the lake tips.len in michigan

513967,Guest,2001-07-29 14:29:00,0,I'm in Michigan also. I emailed him several times looking for info this past spring. I didn't get the particulars - sorry - not much help.lobo
513968,lenray,2001-08-03 19:05:00,467,hELLO loboI was wondering where you are located in Michigan??I am at Clare exactly 200 miles south of the SOO.I like to get up into Ontario 6-8 times per year but will only make it 4 times this year. I fish some out of Missanabie go out into the bush say 20-30 miles out of town and fish west of Manitouwadge and some north of Terrace Bay. We fish lakes only reached by a quad and canoe with some backpacking with an inflatible--some lakes are harder to reach than others. It depends on which lakes I fish by the number of strong mules that are willing to go along--don't have many secondtimers.take care lobolen
513969,Guest,2001-08-04 23:42:00,0,"Len,Or should I call you ""neighbor"". I'm in Midland.You're type of trip sounds like a great adventure but we cheat and drive.We usually drive FOREVER to Pickle Lake or Red Lake and fly from there. We usually go with an outfit called Mocassin Trails that opens up a new camp or two every year on virgin waters; the fishing is incredible.We went to a place called Waynorth this year and did pretty well but are going back with Moc Trails next year to a new camp that is under construction now (on the Winisk river system).Mocassin Trails is flying direct from TBay next year so it should shorten the drive by 600 miles or so round trip.Lobo"
