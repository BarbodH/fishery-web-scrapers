519907,Guest,2002-05-07 11:20:00,0,If we cross at International Falls where is the best place to buy Leechs and how many will six guys use on Lac Seul for one week fishing 8 hours a day...tough question....Thanks
519908,Guest,2002-05-07 12:03:00,0,"I buy two pounds of leeches for myself for a week on Lac Seul. I also use a few minnows, but not many. I bring leeches home, but its less than half a pound. Better too many than to run out."
519909,Guest,2002-05-07 12:04:00,0,Good luck crossing the border better hope you dont get searched!
519910,Guest,2002-05-07 13:25:00,0,"Legally, you are not suppose to take leeches across the border. We got some JUMBOS in Nestor Falls last year in August at the first bait shop on the right side of the highway as you enter town. I am not sure of the name though. You may need to ask for them because they might not be on the price board. I agree with USA7, you better have a good hiding spot if you try to take them across.Good Luck!!Renn"
519911,Guest,2002-05-07 13:50:00,0,"Sorry boys ,I should have said after we cross the border at Int Falls where is the best place to buy Leechs. I never was planning on buying them in the states....Thanks"
519912,Guest,2002-05-08 05:05:00,0,"The comments were aimed at me, Sam, not you.For the record, I buy my leeches in Fort Francis. If it is against the law to bring leeches from Ontario to Minnesota, I've not been aware of it. I've never been asked whether I'm bringing any bait home with me."
519913,Guest,2002-05-08 06:32:00,0,"I can not remember the name of the place I get them at, but after crossing the border take the highway West that goes to Nester Falls, go West about a mile or two, its a gas station and bait Shop on the right hand side of the highway, its still in town. He has good bait and not too high. If I find the name tonight I'll post it for you.Good Luck."
519914,bphunger,2002-05-08 07:18:00,28,The bait shop and gas stations you are talking about is Whitherspoons. It is a good place to stop. Have fun!
519916,Guest,2002-05-08 11:52:00,0,"I buy most of my leeches and minnows at Rainy Lake Baits. They are located on the east side of town on HWY 11. It's a couple miles out of the way if you are planning to travel north on HWY 17, but I have always found them to be a reliable source for have both fresh bait and have adequate supplies. They always have plenty of staff to process customers buying licenses and bait. I have never thought much of Witherspoons. TGG"
