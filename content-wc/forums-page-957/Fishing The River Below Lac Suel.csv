We will arrive early on Saturday the 29th, and are thinking of fishing the English River below Lac Seul, or the Cedar River at Perrault Falls. We will have to fish from shore. My question is: Can this be done, are there places that you can reach on foot. We would appreciate ay information or tips."
520560,Guest,2002-05-22 12:42:00,0,do you have to fish from shore? There are lots of ways to get a boat up in that country many times years ago when I didn't have a boat I just brought a motor up north to use for fishing and a boat was found to use at many different lakes up there. The bars are a good source for a boat for the trip. I like to walk to falls and rapids to fish the washout or hole below the fast water a good practice even from a boat.
520561,Byron,2002-05-22 13:08:00,42,"We will not be towing our boat to Lac Seul, so we are stuck on shore. We figured if there is a way to get down to the rivers, we would fish the eddy's and pools with jigs and slip bobbers. We have not done this before, and were not sure if the land along the rivers are private or public, or if jigs and slip bobbers would be the right approach. We hadn't thought about securing a boat when we got there. We will have a 40lb. thrust trolling motor with us. Would this be powerfull enough to navigate the waters, or would it be to dangerous?If any kind residents of the area are watching this board, and have a small boat they would let us borrow, or rent, you would make a couple of Okie's mighty grateful."

520565,Jesse-WI,2002-05-22 18:32:00,534,"Below the dam about a hundred yards or so there is a very small bay on the north side of the river. You want to position yourself along the northeast side. A short ways out is a very large eddie when the water is flowing. I saw a local using a leech, plain hook and split shot catch alot of very nice walleyes from shore last year. He would cast out to the edge of the eddie and let the current sweep his bait along the rock bottom back towards the dam.The only problem is I could not tell you exactly how to walk to this spot."
520566,Byron,2002-05-22 19:27:00,42,"Thanks for all the information. We will check out the river and see what we can get into. Also, we'll talk to locals for some tips."

North side is a little tricky. Have to turn in at power plant after you cross bridge. There is a lane that runs along the north side of their fenced in property boundry. Follow the lane (very rough and deep potholes so will need a truck or suv) as it will make a 90 to the left and another 90 back to right. Then it will open up into a little grassy area which is the parking area. There will be a path that will lead you down over hill to fishing area. Also, another place to try is the river below the manitou hydro plant. Can be very good fishing at times when they're letting the water through. Only downside is that there's not a lot of room for very many people there."
