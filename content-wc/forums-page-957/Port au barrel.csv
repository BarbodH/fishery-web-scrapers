520362,Guest,2002-05-16 12:40:00,0,"In my limited experiences at Pointe au Baril I've had quite a bit of success with one-eyed jacks followed by Chigaco at the end. I usually prefer to stay in until the end because you always have the chance for the perfect high or low card.In rougher waters I've tried follow the queen and in some cases king's and little ones. If that doesn't produce results and cloud cover permits, you can always try blind baseball, but be wary of the wild cards."
520363,Tyee,2002-05-16 17:15:00,60,"MDC,I've fished the Pointe area three times, and frankly never didvery well....though we fished a little later in the summer.For this time of the year, you'll want to find the main river that feeds the Pointe area, and fish it's mouth at the bay, and go up the river til you hit a rapids....I hear it's good from the mouth back to the rapids. Your camp should get you a map, and directions to theriver.Also, there are several rock islands near the mouth that should befished. Most guys troll and pick up some pike/small mouth bass aswell as the eyes.This area is in a ""restocking"" program, and it needs all the helpit can get for the walleye. It's my understanding that years agothis was a great area for fishing, and got pounded year after year;and basically got fished down, though it's now on the rebound ?If you've never been up to the Georgian Islands before, you're infor a treat, as it's a beautiful area with a lot of history.Good luck,Rich B."
520364,Guest,2002-05-18 05:11:00,0,"If you don't mind fishing with live bait, then hit the bait shop for some 6""-8"" suckers...hunt the shallow bays and work the weeds for big pike. Often, they won't get active until the sun pops out and warms the shallow water. Lots of 10lb-15lb spawners. Catch 'em and release 'em."
520365,Matdech,2002-05-23 07:07:00,2,yup.....back from the long weekend and we did pretty well.5 Pick's over 3 pounds highest at 65 Pike highest at 11....We were lucky...others were not!
