When a fish is one for the wall I release the fish after taking a photo and basic measurments. each carving is a one of a kind creation that increases in value. In addition, I like to carve Gone fishing signs for the office door or the lake cabin door. remember to leave your e mail address for a copy of my newsletter with specials and new carvings for the fisherman.
