520409,Guest,2002-05-16 20:11:00,0,I will be making a trip up to Morson to do some walleye fishing on Lake of the Woods the second week in June. Does anyone have the name and phone number or web address of a good bait shop in Rainy River that I can buy leeches from by the pound. Thanks in advance for your help.

It's run by Karen at 807-488-9670, she can have leeches there for you if you call in advance, and she's a real nice lady. We generally buy our licences there also. I haven't found a good bait shop in Rainy River yet. Good luck."
