The ice has been off the lakes here for just over a week, the trees aren't budding at all, it's a terrible spring.I noticed today while on the river that in shallow areas with lots of current and rocks, especially at the bottom of rapids, were hundreds of Suckers, side by side, in 1-3 feet of water. They were obviously spawning. My question is, who spawns first - Suckers or Walleyes? (I've heard Suckers spawn first, in which case it would appear that the Walleyes STILL haven't spawned yet.)"
520503,Thumper,2002-05-20 04:38:00,133,I'd say Walleyes spawn first. Many times we are catching spawned out Walleye when the suckers are running. Even with the late ice out here in NW Ontario the boys are catching spawned out females. In some cases the ice has only been off for a week and they are catching spawnwed out fish.
520504,Guest,2002-05-20 06:19:00,0,Walleye spawn first given their reproduction sequence relative to temp. Suckers spawn generally a touch later with some overlap. Tight LinesODG
520505,Wawajake,2002-05-21 05:42:00,413,"I read some where that Walleye need a minimum of 48 degree farenheit water to spawn. I also read that the temperature of surface water must reach 39 to 40 degrees farenheit before the density of that water causes it to drop in water column and lake to ""turnover"" so fish could be anywhere during turnover timeframe.If thats true that explains why the lake I fished this weekend ,it was very diffcult to find walleye , I doubt they spawned yet.Ice out was two weeks ago and surface temperature was 40 degrees in current locations and only in the odd shallow bay could I find 46 degree surface water and thats where pike were but not walleye.Are these assumptions correct ?? I am going back next weekend what water temperature should I look for ??confused by this cold spring toojakejake"
520506,Bobby,2002-05-23 00:05:00,211,"Jake, that's exactly what I was thinking, and I had similar temp readings around the lake, on the fishfinder. However, a few days ago I was cleaning a fish and noted but a few traces of eggs, obviously meaning they've spawned. Finally found a whole bunch of fish, and they were hanging around the mouth of the river, near the weeds. Trolling long minnow baits (floating rapalas) or jigging minnows. Then, today, it snowed. #@*#!!!"
