520543,Guest,2002-05-21 14:31:00,0,Plan on crossing border in late July. Is Sault Ste. Marie usually a busy border? Should be crossing mid to late afternoon on Sunday. Is this a good time? Also is there someone from Imigration there 24-7 or just through the week? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
520544,Guest,2002-05-21 17:15:00,0,have crossed in most months of the year including July and it always seems about the same not too busy except on Friday and Saturday evenings. There should be someone on duty 24/7 for immigration and customs but maybe call ahead and they can help you.
