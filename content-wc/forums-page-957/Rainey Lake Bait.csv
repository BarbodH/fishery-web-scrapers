Can we take minnows and leeches from the USA or do we need to stop someplace in canada to buy them?we will be up there the first week of June, anyone have any suggestions, please respond."

If you buy leeches in Canada you have to keep your reciept so you can prove they were bought in Canada. Your minnows have to be dead, if you put them in a plastic bag and wrap them up tight and pack them on ice that will be good enough."
