That's why without hesitation I return. I've had several guys backout on me this year, so for the right individuals that don't have their Canadian trip planned, respond with e:mail address and I'll send you specifics. Guide service is free, just cost of food and lodging for 6 days of great fishing. Trip planned for 7/6 thru 7/12. The way the weather has been, this timeframe promises to be a post spawn bonanza."

Outpost sounds great! In addition to fishing, eating and sleeping, we can also operate a boat, and cook, too. Have topo-hydro chart(s) for the area & handheld GPS. Send particulars; be happy to respond. [email protected]Bugs"
