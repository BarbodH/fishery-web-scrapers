520517,Keith,2002-05-24 06:49:00,48,My email is [email protected]. That would be appreciated. We have never done very well on big sand. I have always heard that is the place to find big fish but I have never been able to find them. We did well on the raspberry and Baker's PT last year about the time you are going if that helps.
520518,Guest,2002-05-25 13:10:00,0,"Hey Ron, when you are in Minaki where you staying at ? Last I remember I think you said ""Fergies"" or ""Barbers"". Think I might make a drive out on the monday to chat with you.....Rob"
520519,Guest,2002-05-25 16:05:00,0,he stays with peter
520520,Reels,2002-05-26 05:32:00,2876,"Hi Rob,Yes, I'm staying at Barbers. It would be nice meeting you. I always enjoy meeting the people on walleye central.If you want, you can leave a message with Peter what time your thinking, and I'll be sure I'm there. I think we are in Cabin #1 this trip.Tight Lines,Ron<{{}}><"
520507,DonC,2002-05-20 04:51:00,93,"Well, it has finally arrived, the time to go to Minaki. This Saturday, our group leaves for Minaki. The forecast continues to look colder than usual. I wonder if the smallmouth will be up shallow yet, like they have in past years, the last week of May? I enjoy catching crappie, where will they be with colder water temperatures? I suspect the walleye fishing will be fine, along with the pike. It will be nice to return to Minaki, even if it is cooler than normal.Don"
520508,Guest,2002-05-20 06:11:00,0,We are also going to Minaki next week. Crossing over on Friday afternoon and staying in Ft. Francis that night. It is a good way to breakup a 14 hour drive.Better take your raingear! The 10 day forcast looks like cool weather and rain up until Wednesday.Smallies will be slow and not many will be found up along the rocky shores. Its been too cold.
520509,Reels,2002-05-20 06:22:00,2876,"Good luck guys! I'll be heading up the 31st. You should have some great northern pike action in the bays!Make sure you check our Duck bay. Should be some hogs in there for a few weeks. If they arent in the bay, fish just outside of it by the rock reef.<{{}}><"
520510,Guest,2002-05-20 17:32:00,0,You don't fish for northerns do you?
520511,Guest,2002-05-21 00:10:00,0,"I think what Reels was trying to say is that ""While fishing the shallows for walleye, them Pike Monsters roam in & try to steal a easy meal from them dumb walleye........."" Just a hunch on my part...Reels, ""Duck Bay"" ? ? ? still playing with the middle weights ? When yah gonna move up & fish the big girls ? ? ? Duck Bay is for rookies. :-}Good FishenRob"
520512,Guest,2002-05-21 03:49:00,0,Ya Reels!Fish the north east side of big sand and hold on!
520513,Reels,2002-05-21 07:12:00,2876,"You guys crack me up! :-)I keep hearing about those giant Northern up on the north east end of big sand, but have had a bunch of luck there. I certainly will try again though! If someone wants to go for a boat ride, let me know. I have plenty of room in the boat.And yes, when those walleye get tight lips, which dosent happen often up there, I'll cast for a gator now and then. Even a smallmouth or two!<{{}}><"
520514,iamwalleye1,2002-05-21 19:07:00,1589,Look out for the rocks up there reels! I wish you good warm luck!
520515,Keith,2002-05-23 06:04:00,48,I leave for Minaki June 8. If you do not mind a fishing report would be appreciated. We have been going there for several years and decided to push it back a week to catch more post spawn females. We had really good fishing the last two days of our trip last year with several big ones. Hope we did not make a mistake. Good Luck
520516,Reels,2002-05-23 09:20:00,2876,"I'll be driving back on the 8th, so I cant post a report, but if you send me an e-mail, I'll give you my cell # and you can call while we're on the road.Ron<{{}}><"
