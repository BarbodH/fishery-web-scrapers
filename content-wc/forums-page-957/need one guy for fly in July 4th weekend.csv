520280,sdyer,2002-05-15 19:12:00,34,I am flying in to sportsmans lodge which is north of Red lake ontario over fourth of july weekend and I need a fishing partner. The trip starts early on July 4th and ends the following tuesday the 9th. The trip will be guided for three of the five days. I am friends with manager and owner and have a great deal on the trip but none of my buddies can make it. If you are interested e-mail at [email protected] for all of the details. Duffy

520282,duffy,2002-05-16 15:21:00,49,"Steve,yes we did. What's the story with your trip? Did the ice come out yet? Can you make it over the 4th?Sean"
520283,lobo1,2002-05-16 16:36:00,734,"Sean,I'd love to go in July but the family vacation is also scheduled then.I'm sort of in a bind with my trip. My guy says it's iced up and there is no hope of departing next Thursday. He has given me several alternatives, none of which will work for the whole group.I did contact Bob today and he has two openings that work for our group at the outpost. I should get more info tomorrow.Bob said the ice is breaking nicely on Fav and should be looking good next week.I need to make it clear to him that if we go next week that I need a good shot at getting up on the Borland - those female hogs ought to be packed in there. He said that both trout lakes are iced up.So, after planning a trip for a year I am replanning, maybe at the last minute. If it doesn't work out we may go in late Sept or just skip it and lean toward Costa Rica in the winter.Steve"
