520621,Guest,2002-05-25 15:33:00,0,"Just got back from north east side of Lac Seul. We did not get a ton of fish, but it was by far the most large fish we ever got. 4 of us caught over 100 fish over 25"" in 6 day's,the biggest being 29 1/2"". Of course we put them all back. Most of them were spawned out and are heading towards the big lake.The water was acually warmer up by Chamberlain narrows than down by Pelican rapids"
