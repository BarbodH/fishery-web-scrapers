1331071,briand,2011-07-18 10:56:00,48,"Aaron,It wasn't all that long ago that we were in there, and everything seemed normal.We've seen a lot of kids go in there to party !!Our boat is is legal, as well we keep it out of sight.Around the end of aug I want to head in there and camp for a couple of nights and try for some deep trout."
1328285,Aaron-IN,2011-07-11 07:52:00,500,"Just returned from a trip to the Minaki area (July 4-8). Weather was absolutely beautiful, this was a family trip so I wasn't too disappointed that it was sunny and warm all week. I didn't fish as much as I usually would. Targeted smallmouth mostly landing three that were just at 19 inches (actually I landed one and each of my boys landed one), several 16-18 inchers as well, most were caught in the evening on topwater baits. I only went walleye fishing one evening and we caught a 22, 27 and 28 incher within an hour of each other while trolling. The highlight of the trip was reeling in a 16 inch smallmouth caught on a senko then having my pole double over all of the sudden.......ended up landing both the bass and a 49 inch Musky that grabbed the bass's tail and never let go. Also, I witnessed the mother of all mayfly hatches while there, never seen a hatch like that one."
1328292,Guest,2011-07-11 08:15:00,0,"Hi AAron, Long time since I've posted but I've still enjoyed watching for your updates on the Minaki area. Congrats on the musky! that had to scare the heck out of you! did you see many follows while you where there? We're going up a couple weeks later this year - five days and counting so I guess we've missed the smallie spawn. This will be our 20th year going to Canada and can't what to get the lines wet! How is the water level? Any other info you can share would be great. IndyPikeSlinger"
1328296,Aaron-IN,2011-07-11 08:26:00,500,"I only saw one other musky and he was cruising the shore back in Mine bay, did not have any follows. I probably only fished 1/4 of what I would normally fish when the family isn't with me. The spawn is over for sure granted there might be a few here or there with eggs still. The water level is what I consider ""normal"" for that system, it is lower than it has been in the past few years though. If you don't know that system well you better be carefull. I marked a couple of rocks with jugs while I was there but there are plenty more that will remove your lower unit. You should have a good week up there, the walleye should be in their normal summer patterns and the smallies should be moving more towards the islands and out of the bays. In my 30+ years of going up there I have never seen so few boats and people as I did that week. Nester Falls and Soix Narrows looked like ghost towns (except for Sat when there was a flea market in SN). I guess the prior two weeks there were a lot of fisherman up in Minaki for the pre-fish and tournament but they had all left when I got there. Good luck to you."
1328305,Guest,2011-07-11 08:46:00,0,"Aaron, Thanks for the reply. I let you know how it went when we get back. If anyone else has any reports I'm eager to hear them! Thanks, IPS"

1328483,KSauers,2011-07-11 15:47:00,385,I'll be leaving Saturday for 11 days of fishing. Walleyes mostly during the day and muskies every evening until about 10 or so. Hope the eyes are on all my favorite big sand reefs.
1329828,briand,2011-07-14 11:23:00,48,Sounds like a good holiday.Did you manage to hike into vermillion ?? Though this time of year that portage may have the worst bugs!Aaron have you ever fished for white fish or mooneye at Minaki ???
1330101,Bigiver,2011-07-15 06:10:00,94,"I am down to eight days until we leave for Minaki, actually nine until were fishing (July 23rd). Jignminnow you must be down to six. KSauers you and IndyPikeSlinger will get ther before either of us. Don't catch them all. Look foward to reading everyone's post when they get home. Arron-IN it is always makes me feel good to read your Minaki posts, kind of makes a guy feel that he is up there with you. I'm not a big bass fisherman but any fishing is good fishing."
1330120,jignminow,2011-07-15 07:32:00,168,"Well, my actual time is the same as yours. We get to Minaki, Barbers Resort, on Saturday the 23rd but we stay in Nestor Falls, Arrowhead Resort, Friday night. So, we will get some fishing in there on Friday. We leave from here Thursday morning with a stopover at my moms in Chetek Wi Thursday night and off to Nestor Falls in the morning. So, I count it as Thursday since we leave that day and I aint at work!!!!!!!!! Can't come soon enough. Salmon fishing on the big pond tomorrow morning and then the complete boat re-tool and cleaning on Sunday. WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!"
1330121,Aaron-IN,2011-07-15 07:34:00,500,"Brian, I did hike over to vermillion and took a nice swim, bugs were not that bad. So who is destroying all the boats left illegally in there? As far as I know there is only one boat with a permit in there (Otto) and some jack wagon tried to sink it in the falls. I pulled it back out and drug it back on the bank.Never fished for white fish or mooneye."
