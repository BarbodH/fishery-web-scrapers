1330504,#lakes.area75,2011-07-16 14:43:00,19,"Yes, the rags are still a go. I just returned today from the trip and we took the rags both ways! Good luck"
1330564,Warrior56215,2011-07-16 18:24:00,46,Thanks. How was fishing?
1330565,Warrior56215,2011-07-16 18:28:00,46,"Lakes.Area,Should have looked a little further down the page to see your report. Curious as how deep you found them?"
1331343,#lakes.area75,2011-07-18 19:44:00,19,"Fishing was good! It always is up there. We found them anywhere from 9-17 ft. We would find them everywhere we went but they were not stacked like in previous trips, but we always found fish. When do you go up there?"
1331356,Warrior56215,2011-07-18 20:18:00,46,Be there Friday. Wish I could leave in the morning. Gonna be a long week at work!
1331450,jswinter40,2011-07-19 07:05:00,127,brought the houseboat through the RAGS on Friday the 15th. fished it a little too and saw about 4.5 -5 fow in the channel. fishing was real good for us most fish for us were from 14-22 fow. real slow for northerns for us though. maybe a little less in the numbers department but much better in the size department on average. i would say we got as many fish in the slot or over than we got under.
