1330990,tooski,2011-07-18 08:22:00,393,"Fishing was a bit slower than the June all male trip when the walleye were pretty much continual. This was a family trip and more relaxed than our earlier effort. Lake was down about 18"" from our June trip and weeds had sprung up along the shorelines all the way out to about 7 feet in depth. Water temps were hovering around 72. The hatch was thick and the fish were gorged with the insects. Sure made a mess of the filet board. The walleye were still plentiful even under those conditions. Basically just trolled jigs in June since that was the easiest method of catching fish. The preferred walleye bite was on spinner rigs for this trip however. The lake is relatively small and shallow to a max of 14 feet and probably for this reason most of our fish were caught along and in the weed beds close to shore. As Phish likes to describe these lakes it is a saucer shaped lake with little structure in the way of reefs or underwater humps. Never the less this lake has a lot of walleye. The pix are not really fishing related (although we took quite a few if interested) but are a payoff on what must have been an alcohol related wager.."

1331054,Larry S,2011-07-18 10:05:00,665,"Hey Tooski. Loved your pictures,except I couldn't see your face. Your dog looked fine,but have no idea what you look like? I lost a bet with my brother in-law who lives 45 miles north of Goon Bay and had to wear a Goon Bay Packers Jersey for a month after the Goons beat my Bears and won the Super Bowl this year. No pictures though I won't be embarrased. I give you a lot of credit Tooski for not welshing on you bet. And posting these pictures,except were is your face? On our trip to Kearns Lake we caught most of our walleyes on jigs w/ twister tails and plain hooks w/nitecrawlers. Although I did catch a number of walleyes on homemade spinners w/leeches or nitecrawlers Hope to meet you one of these days and have a cold one with you. One of my good friends in Vegas is a Letter carrier who transfered out here from Cleveland. We watch a lot of football games together I.m now a retired Letter Carrier as of 1-3 11 Take Care Larry S"
1331072,tooski,2011-07-18 10:57:00,393,Bad enough I had to wear the ****nn thing let alone show my face. Maybe we will get together for a fly in one of these days. Phishlips has been trying to talk me into it for awhile but he is a bit too fanatical with his 10 day trips. My e-mail is [email protected] so we can continue talking without clogging the board. The dog hasn't eaten since I made him wear that jersey.
