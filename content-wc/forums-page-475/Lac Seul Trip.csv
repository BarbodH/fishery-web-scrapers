Water temp was very warm this year with it being anywhere from 69-74 degrees F. Biggest walleye was 27.5"", Biggest northern was 38"" and biggest smallmouth was 17"". No muskies this year, but, caught more northerns then usual. Rained lightly only two days with light wind to no wind from several different directions each day. Walleye bite was great as usual. Trip went way too fast as it usually does and can't wait for next year already! Good luck fishing, Kurt"
