1329011,NP4ME,2011-07-12 19:21:00,378,"Looking for some help and recommendations on the best mulit-species lakes. Our group wants muskies, walleye, northerns, and smallies. We want an American plan package and want the camp to be as remote as possible. It can either be a drive-to or boat-in. Appreciate any help! NP"
1329025,JDP,2011-07-12 19:59:00,1457,"For sure Lac Seul NE section of the lake...boat-in or houseboat.A 2nd possibilty would be Lake of the Woods, Canadian waters.A 3rd possibility Cliff Lake, much smaller than Lac Seul, south of Ear Falls, drive-in also has Lake Trout."
1329032,geareng,2011-07-12 20:20:00,335,"Without a doubt, the Canadian side of Lake of The Woods is the best multi-species lake I have ever fished. This year we caught Walleye, Pike, Sauger, Muskie (by accident, they were out of season), Pike, Smallmouth, Largemouth, Perch and Crappie all in the same week."
1329206,Obabikon,2011-07-13 07:25:00,2370,lake of the woods is tough to beat.

1329282,@Lunker,2011-07-13 10:05:00,835,"Check out witchbay.com on the NE corner of LOTW. Camp road is 2 hours north of I. Falls, American plan, all the species you're looking for, remote drive-to camp, and the closest ""neighbor"" is 10 miles away by water."
1330325,Guest,2011-07-15 19:18:00,0,"Hawk Lake Lodge Best trophy walleye fishing in the world, largest smallmouth in the country (they catch 6-8 pound fish and have the largest catch and release world record at 9 pounds and walleye at 37 inches), big pike, lake trout, perch and even crappie. American Plan, 35 square miles of fishing on remote waters and the new owner is very hands on. Check them out. I went last month and loved it. hawk-lake.com"
1330567,NP4ME,2011-07-16 18:37:00,378,"Canada Lover, Thanks for the info about Hawk Lake. Looked pretty neat, but no musky and it was quite a bit out of our price range. @Lunker, With the next ""neighbor"" 10 miles away, do you see many other boats? I have had a couple people tell me about Witch Bay and it seems pretty interesting. Thanks, NP"
1330912,Robert Cardenas,2011-07-17 23:05:00,138,"Check out Lake Wabigoon, www.bonnybay.com take a look at there web site and you will see all the fish you are asking for. Awesome resort!"
1331594,tdscott86,2011-07-19 12:01:00,5,Lac Seul. www.lostislandlodge.com they have their own small island with cabins on it that is very good fishing and only a short boat from the ramp and they are reasonable priced. We've stayed there twice now.
