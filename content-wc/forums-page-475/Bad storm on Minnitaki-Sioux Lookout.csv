1331372,scar,2011-07-18 20:56:00,196,Real bad storm went through at 4 am on Sunday. We had large trees go down on our property on Minnitaki. There was a group camping on an island close to our cabin and I wonder how they fared. Anyone from the area know about injuries/damage? really thought the cabin was going to take flight but we only lost our stove pipe and had branches of a huge tree that went down graze our roof. Had to leave for home later Sunday morning and we noticed a lot of trees down and debris in the water.
