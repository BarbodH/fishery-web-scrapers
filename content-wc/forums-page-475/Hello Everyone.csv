1330204,emma17,2011-07-15 11:43:00,436,Welcome pikeslayer8 and Drew59. I'm a few months new to this site and I'm amazed how friendly and helpful the posters are. Great site for a rookie especially like me. Hey Fishoil- I spend a good bit of time in NE WI- are you in Eagle River area?
1330278,Fishoil,2011-07-15 16:06:00,1277,I live near Appleton but I do venture north occasionally.
1330451,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-16 10:09:00,1460,"Drew59,I checked out Forest Lodge website, very cool. What is the lake just north of Caribou? It borders on the park. Looks to me our lakes are only about 40-50 miles apart. I can't wait to here more from you. Seems to me, you married well. Good luck in Sept.Slayer"
1330524,drew59,2011-07-16 15:31:00,87,"Hi Slayer, You are probably looking at Smoothrock. Caribou drains into it. Beautiful rapids but not navigable.As for my wife, she is a good one. Leeches are her favorite bait, she pees over the side of the boat, and she's very good looking. All the makings of an excellent fishing partner!"
1329472,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-13 17:06:00,1460,"Let me intoduce myself.Pikeslayer8 new to this online walleye scene. I am a diplaced Iowan living in Colorado. My dad started takin me when I was 9 and I guess I havn't missed many years trip for 40 years as I'm 49. My dad has passed on, have to continue this beatiful tradition as long as I am able.Read a lot of awesome posts and see their is much wisdom here. I've watched SoloPaddler go across Wabakimion on you tube many times and read many of his posts on OFC, cool man. Nimstug and Phish expert fisherman. Wish I was but I do my best. Caught a 27"" eye in June.Anyway, the big question is? How would you like to have been in that lodge with Mushmorton and his puppy?"
1329494,drew59,2011-07-13 18:06:00,87,"I'm new too. Been lurking here a LONG time, now it's time to jump in. My wife and I have been to Canada every year, sometimes twice, for almost 30 years. For the past several years we have been going to Forrest Lodge on Caribou Lake. Oustanding camp and lake. Heading back up in Sept."
1329529,phishfearme,2011-07-13 19:21:00,1242,"welcome guys!! don't be afraid to jump into any topic that suits your fancy! if you're like many of us, you will ""meet"" many new friends and sometimes actually meet them in person. we just did a 10 day trip to kearns lake and of the 4 guys on the trip, i met two of them here on ""canada, eh?"". this has been a very valuable board for me and i'm sure will be for you also. phish"
1329545,joeman79,2011-07-13 19:53:00,417,"Welcome to WC and take these posts, wild posts for what they are. And to answer your last question about Mush, I would not spend much time in Lodge that's for sure. I want to be happy and enjoy myself and not listen to propaganda comparing Wardens to Nazi's. I would do the housekeeping plan and leave early and come in late."
1329564,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-13 20:40:00,1460,"Thank you Phish, Been checking out your post on Bow Lake with N of 51. Been thinkin bout a 2nd trip. Love to pick your brain"
