1331026,stevie,2011-07-18 09:21:00,21,"here's how it has been explained to me and how I interperate and explain to my guests every sat nite after check in. as gordy explained as an example on eagle you are allowed 2 trout but only 1 per day and you have access to lakes with a 2 per day possession that you much travel through eagle coming back as well as a walleye slot on eagle of 18-22.8""and an 18"" no slot line on the same lakes. as well as access to nearby drive to lakes that have no slot. you are legal as long as YOU TRAVEL DIRECTLY FROM THOSE LAKES THROUGH EAGLE WITH OUT STOPPING TO FISH. STOPPING TO FISH WITH ANYONE IN THE BOAT IN POSSESION OF 2 YOU WOULD BE ILLEGAL AND SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE FINE.SAME WITH WALLEYES WITH NO SLOT ON BOAT TO LAKES AND OUTLYING DRIVE TO LAKES,YOU CAN HAVE A 19"" FISH IN THE FREEZER FROM ONE OF THOSE LAKES JUST NOT IN POSSESSION IN THE BOAT WHILE ON THE LAKE IT WOULD NOT BE LEGAL ON WHILE FISHING VS TRAVELING FROM. SHOULD BE NO DIFF. IN REGARD TO POSSESION LIMITS. SO IF YOU POSSESS A VALID REG 8 DAY OR SEASONAL SPORT FISHING LIC YOU MAY POSSESS 4 FISH IN THE FREEZER BUT NOT WHILE ON OR IN THE BOAT ON WATERS WITH A 2 FISH LIMIT. in the situation described and asked about even though that is the law an interpretation by a CO initially may be diff. or questionable during a freezer check as a method of investigation to see if one was really fishing on a 4 fish lake prior so i would recomend the reciept from the resort on the 4 fish lake to be in possession to erase doubts or any question of. steve AML"

1330767,jignminow,2011-07-17 13:58:00,168,"The limit for Walleye on the Winnipeg River system in Minaki is 2 fish. On our way up to our destination, we spend the afternoon and evening the the day before at a resort in Nestor Falls where the limit is 4. I will have a receipt for my stay in Nestor Falls so is it legal for me to keep 2 fish from there and bring them with me to Minaki? If my freezer gets checked at a resort in Minaki, can I have 2 fish caught legally elsewhere and still be legal to take 2 from there? Steve"
1330791,teddi,2011-07-17 14:57:00,349,NO||||||
1330793,v-bay gord,2011-07-17 15:06:00,3168,"Why not? Technically you would not be breaking any laws......of course the burden of proof would fall on your shoulders. A similar example is on Eagle Lake.......a two trout possession limit BUT only one per day. Fishing a portage lake where the limit is two means you have to boat back across Eagle with ""over your limit for Eagle Lake""...hasn't been an issue yet for anyone I know."
1330818,jignminow,2011-07-17 17:09:00,168,Wouldn't the burdon of proof fall on the warden? I have a receipt that shows that I stayed in a place that allows 4 fish and I kept 2. I just don't know the exact letter of the law. I will call the DNR office myself and ask this question.
1330828,jow,2011-07-17 17:49:00,20,Yes
1330844,Reels,2011-07-17 19:01:00,2876,"One no, one yes and one maybe. Clear as mud."
1330926,teddi,2011-07-18 05:15:00,349,say you stay at a camp on lac seul and you have a fish in the slot[18 to21] and the warden comes to check. you tell him you caught it on a different lake you will have to prove it or get your check book out.
1330932,Shellback,2011-07-18 05:35:00,8083,"I don't think it would be in your best interest. The burden of proof would be on you. A receipt for a resort stay means nothing other than you stayed there. Maybe if you had a local warden write you a note that they were caught there, might work, good luck getting that done."
1330934,jignminow,2011-07-18 05:49:00,168,"I will get the official word today...............seems to be that it would be impossible to prove either way. I know, for example, when fishing the Wisconsin/Illinois border water on Lake Michigan and you launched in Illinois, you can catch your 5 fish limit in Wisconsin, bring them to shore and leave them in your truck in a cooler marked that you caught them in Wisconsin and then proceed back out and catch 5 more in Illinois....this works in Illinois because there is only a daily limit with no possession limit. It won't work in the reverse if you launched in Wisconsin. Anyway, official word to follow................."
1330984,jignminow,2011-07-18 08:14:00,168,"O.K., here is the official answer from officer Matt Brook out of the Kenora office. The answer is YES, as long as you have the regular sport fishing license, you can catch and keep fish from a 4-limit area and bring them to a 2-limit area to keep and can catch your 2 fish limit there. He said that it would be a good idea to mark the fish from the 4-fish area with a date and location caught. Backing it up with a receipt from the resort would be helpful as well however, what if you just stopped at a lake and caught two and then proceeded on? I didn't ask him that and didn't want to push it either. He mentioned that the possession limit relates to the body of water that you are fishing at the time. Wait a second, if that is the rule, could I keep 4 and then 2? I might have to call him back. Anyway, I got my answer. I will be sure to keep officer Brooks name handy just in case."
