1331136,Bitinlight,2011-07-18 12:47:00,95,"Just returned yesterday with my wife and Pacman and his wife after fishing the NE section of Lac Seul from 7/12 to 7/16. Fished primarily from Bear Narrows to Chamberlain Narrows. Numbers were 1056 walleyes(wives keep track) between the four of us. Found fish mostly in 15-20 feet of water but also caught some shallower and deeper. Best action came from jig and minnow, then jig and crawler, and also a little bottom bouncer and crawler mixed in. Fished our traditional islands, points, and shorelines where we find fish in our June trip. Had 5 days of beautiful weather---two cloudy and good walleye chop, two sunny and some wind, and the last day warm and sunny with good wind. Where the wind was blowing was where the fish were. We had two really good evening bites, also. There was a small mayfly hatch while we were there, which apparently was the fourth one this year--it didn't seem to affect the fishing. Three biggest fish--24.5, 24, 24. We usually get a couple in the 26-28 inch range, but it just didn't happen. Numerous slot fish and quite a few over slot in the 20-22 inch range. We caught a few northerns, none of which were big, but we don't target those. We take a June trip with the guys and the July trip with the girls. This July trip was our best fishing ever-just as good as June. Don't know what this heat wave will do, but the fish are there and biting. The Rags is taking boat traffic with no problem. Good luck if you go."
1331164,tv4fish,2011-07-18 13:42:00,2694,Just curious - Do you launch at Deception Bay and make the run up through the Rags each day? (your trip soons very similar to the one we had). Ours was 6-25 to 07-02.
1331200,Bitinlight,2011-07-18 14:59:00,95,We stay at Lac Seul Outposts and use their boats for fishing. They take us in and out using their transport boats that run 150 Mercs. They are running it daily. People who bring in their own boats are also running through there.
1331330,bigwalleye1,2011-07-18 19:11:00,2632,"We ran out of Deception landing Thursday to Sunday (yesterday). The Rags are passable without problems, although for my annual July trip, I would estimate the water to be 2 ft or more lower than the same period the last couple years. Thursday and Friday were good fishing, mostly jigging with minnows, 27.5 largest for the trip, and the largest walleye my Dad has ever caught. We released her. Fished Deception to Taylor Island. With wind we found walleyes. No wind on Saturday late moring and the hot sun made for a tough bite. Sunday was very similar except we did have a breeze. Still blazing hot in the afternoon. Catch rates seemed to be off from previous years in the areas we normally fishLOTS of 14 and unders, so I see promise for the future... Skated the border both ways at I Falls, little to no wait times either diraction. Safe travels to you all, on the roads and on the water."
