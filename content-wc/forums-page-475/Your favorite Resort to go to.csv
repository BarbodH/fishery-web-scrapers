1329805,NARDA 1,2011-07-14 10:53:00,636,"I've been going to Birch Dale Lodge on Eagle since 1988 and will continue to go until it is physically impossible. My group and I have been treated like family since we first arrived at the lodge. The Bruetsch family bent over backwards to insure we had a successful and enjoyable trip. The fishing and size of fish has continued to get better year after year. With walleye, plke, musky, lake trout, small mouth, perch and the occasional white fish thrown in there is plenty to fish for. If we ever have a problem with anything they are quick to make it right. The lodge was sold last year to the Pinette family and they picked up where the Bruetsch's left off and putting their own touches on the place. The food is excellent and with the Bullpit Steakhouse right on the premises how can you gp wrong. I really don't know how I would handle it if I couldn't go up. Only about 55 days to go, can't wait!!!!!!"
1329824,emma17,2011-07-14 11:15:00,436,"I've only been to one- last year I brought my sons to Andersons on Abram. The cabin was huge and clean and the restaurant was very good. In reading the above post, I didn't have any interaction w owners that gave me a part of the family feeling. I feel Andersons is almost more of a commercial operation- focused on their big guide boats to Lac Seul- and less about a vacation atmosphere. Our guide wasn't the most friendly of men- I think he was fighting a hang over. For a pure fishing trip w the guys and a restaurant on the grounds, it's good."
1329848,HeHooksHimself,2011-07-14 11:57:00,725,"I have really only been to three different resorts and I have not had a bad experience with any of them. Four years ago my brother-in-law and I went to McKinley Lake through Thunderhook Fly-ins. Thunderhook appears to have been sold since then, but the crew that was there, including Rudy who is still there, was very accommodating. We had a little confusion about when we were supposed to arrive, but they flew us right in when we got there. The lake was small but the fishing was awesome. We caught hundreds of walleye and my bro in law caught his biggest pike ever at 42"" on a blue fox spinner at a shallow inlet. They checked on us in midweek, but other than that just let us alone. There were no add-ons and the value was fantastic at $1050 each for a full week. I have been to Woman River Camp 5 times over the years and you will look long and hard to find better hosts than Paul and Deb. Paul knows everything about the Woman River system and freely shares information. He will also guide you if necessary. The cabins are simple but well equipped and the boats/motors are adequate. The thing we love about this drive-in camp is that they will never nickel and dime you for extras, including most portages. The system is vast and there is a public boat ramp so the boat traffic can be a nuisance if you are looking for complete solitude, but the system is big enough that you can go most of the day without seeing others if you try. The fishing is good, but not great, but we have caught pike over 40"" and many big walleye. We went once early and the lakers were shallow and plentiful in Big Woman. Paul and Deb will bend over backwards to accommodate special situations, for instance we have gone twice with four-day trips Fri-Mon. and they have given us a great deal. The place we have been to most is a boat-in with a portage to Wine Lake Camp. I would say they are on the higher end of the price bracket, especially for people who like to fish in the spring, but the fishing is worth it. This system features five lakes without getting out of the boat, all of which are productive and unique. Herb and Ann are great hosts, but be prepared to pay for anything extra, i.e. boat seats, ice, electric starts. Also, the 20 gals. of gas they include in the package is never enough and extra gas will cost $8/gal. We usually have about 8 gals. extra for each boat. Any portage trip costs extra, usually $50/person. There is no electricity or indoor plumbing but Herb was a carpenter in his previous life and the cabins are hard to beat- clean, comfortable and well-built. The propane stoves and refrigerators work great but the hike to the outhouses gets old. Ann prefers that you don't pee off the deck but everyone does (sshh). They are aging hippies so you would think they would resist rules, but they are ultra liberal so they have a lot of rules. As usual, many of them are suggestions, but the rules on what you keep have resulted in very productive waters. The strictest is lake trout. They expect you to release anything over 22"" but the Ontario restrictions are over 26"". The trout are plentiful and all over the shallows during the spring. During the summer you will need outriggers and I thing they will furnish them (for an extra charge, of course). This year we are trying somewhere new for our fall trip- Cobblestone Lodge near Ignace. If anyone has read this post this far and knows anything about this resort, please let me know! I will give my feedback upon our return. Bottom line is this: Most resorts realize that their repeat business depends on customer service. I appreciate the fact that this forum provides an opportunity to report lapses in customer service. Just realize that some people can't be pleased and may be unreasonable (Mushmouth comes to mind, but I still think he was punking us). Happy fishing!"
1329862,wallydave,2011-07-14 12:38:00,2151,"I have fished the NW end of LS out of Goose Bay Camp, for 10 trips since the late 90's. Andrea, continues to improve the camp, docks and boats. Each trip we can see all of the improvements she makes! She always puts us on the fish, gives us the space we like, but she is always ready to visit when we want to socialize. She called us last week to offer a couple of cabins for next years trip. I mailed off our depsosit this morning!"

1329881,Larry Mac,2011-07-14 13:26:00,530,"Hi Mike Kansas, Nice thread!! We have been fishing Ghost River Lodges many times for many years (One of my favorite all around Canadian destinations). Ghost River Lodge has premium walleye fishing water, stained, highly oxygenated, great cover and lots of fish. I consider this to be a numbers Lodge. Our best day with me and a friend was over 220. 100 fish days are often a reality. Size is usually 15"" to 19"". Our largest caught there has been 28"". Lots of Northern also, the largest for us has been 38"". Most of the Northern range from hammer handles to 32"". The accommodations are fine and it is truly a remote location. IMHO Ghost River offers the complete Canadian Wilderness Adventure providing great fishing, amazing wildlife and a variety of fishing locations i.e. waterfalls, reefs, islands, vegetation, rivers and bays. We also utilize the portage lakes a couple of times during the week for added adventure. If you are bringing children they can catch walleye and northern right from the dock while you are doing your camp duties. I highly recommend this camp. They are great people and will definitely put you on fish. PS it is not mentioned much in there literature but there is wonderful Small Mouth and Lake Trout in specific locations and we have had 22lb+ stringers of Jumbo Perch.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1330915,Robert Cardenas,2011-07-17 23:24:00,138,"With out a doubt Bonny Bay Resort. www.bonnybay.com the resort owners Nancy and Len invite you in for the week as if your one of the family. Fishing is phenomenal with trophy muskie, northern pike, walleye, smallies, jumbo perch, and crappies."
1330286,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-15 16:44:00,1460,Shikag has been catch and release http://www.moosepointlodge.com/great wallys. Havn't been for 20 years. I was there on hmoon. Wood fired sauna. Kind of pricy but first class all the way. I would think the lake alone is worthy of consideration. . Slayer
1330288,GWC,2011-07-15 16:49:00,1021,"I like Poplar Point Resort on Gullrock lake. It's a good place to stay, good equipment & great host. We've been going there for several years. Each & every trip is special. Can't wait for the next trip.http://poplarpoint.com/"
1330293,Hump,2011-07-15 17:08:00,578,"Evergreen is fantastic. The cabins are clean, everything you need to be comfortable. Gary and Pat are great, as is all of the help. The boats are outstanding, gas, minnows, ice are included in the price. The camp is only a mile from town, but you would never know it. Very peaceful and quiet."

1330329,drew59,2011-07-15 19:30:00,87,"Forrest Lodge on Caribou Lake near Armstrong. Best drive-in camp we've been to (28 years and counting). Scott and Mary Jo maintain a beautiful camp. Enough water to get away and feel like you are on a fly-in. Easy walleyes, nice pike, plus LAKE TROUT. Great fun. Crossing at Pidgeon River is a dream compared to IF. We love it."
1330646,Bobbajig,2011-07-17 08:12:00,24,My family and I went to Birchdale on several different occasions. Greg and Ernie and everyone at Birchdale were always great. One of my best memories was of my 5 year old son catching a big northern off of the dock with his Spiderman rod and 8lb. test with no wire leader.Recently been going to Lac seul with a group of fishing buddies and staying at Gold Pines fantastic fishing great people but Birchdale will always hold great memories
1330652,Jaskonie,2011-07-17 08:25:00,80,"Our 20 person group has been to 4 different outfitters now and this summer we stayed at Horwood Lake Lodge. Here is how I break down the camp on a 1-10 scale.Cabins, 7. All have lake view and 3 piece baths in decent shape.Boats, 10. 2008 16 footers with live wells fish finders and swivel seats. 20 hp Yamahas.Meal plan 9.5. All the meals were phenomenal with packed lunches in a cooler to go.Service 10. All boats gassed up at night, beds made and wait staff very attentive.Fishing 6. Alot of walleye within 2-5 miles from camp, too many small ones, a bunch in the 16-18 range, hardly any bigger than 18 inches. It was our first trip in so we didnt find the hogs yet.Scenery and Lake 5. Too many weekend cottagers on the lake, and the logs are a lil nuisance.Value 10. Far and away the best trip we have had, and we will be back for a try at the hogs."
1330693,REG,2011-07-17 09:42:00,445,"Rowe's Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash. Everything is well maintained from the docks to the boats. They have done a lot of work to make the cabins the best you can find. Housekeeping only but they've got a great location close to good fishing. Pakwash doesn't have muskies or lakers, but offers every other species including smallmouths. I did 3 years on a houseboat trip on Lac Seul before coming up to SFC but we've not gone anywhere else over the past 15+ years since we're very satisfied with where we are."

1330235,Danbear,2011-07-15 12:50:00,72,"Our 1st Candian trip we took the bus trip to Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake and it was ok but there must have been 100 other guys there too. We went to the All Canda Show the next year and met Ernie from Birchdale he seemed like a down to earth freindly guy and reminded me of my Grandfather, the price was right and off we went. I am still catching walleyes and smallies from one of Ernie's spots he sent us too. Last year Cherlyl and Marcel took over Birchdale and what a great couple we had a ton of laughs with them and I even sat in the booth with them at the Canada show this winter. We will be leaving in 57 days and we even get to meet up with the famous NARDA gang so I am sure the Rye and laughter will be flowing in the Bull Pit bar come September 10th. I am sure there are fancier and more expensive lodges every where, but if you want to go some where were people are friendly, fishing is good and you don't have to break the bank Birch Dale Lodge gets my vote."
1330257,tv4fish,2011-07-15 14:47:00,2694,"My group has been going to the Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout since 1985. We have our own boat and do our own cooking. We like our ""privacy"" and will only contact the Owners if we need something. Otherwise, we do not need a guide, as we have found our own good fishing spots through the years. We primarily fish for walleyes, but also will target northerns and smallmouth bass. The rates at Red Pine are very reasonable and the cabins have been upgraded through the years and are now very nice. If you want/need to rent a boat, they have those available. The resort is very close to Sioux Lookout, so if you want to ""eat out"", it is a short drive to do that. We target ""larger"" walleyes, we have found that catching 100's of 12-16"" walleyes gets ""old"" after a while. I guess there must be some good reasons for us to continue to go there for over 25 years ."
1330262,Stu,2011-07-15 15:01:00,472,"I'm still looking for that ""perfect place"". Only one lodge on a small - meduim sized lake with excellent walleye. So far Thaddeus has been the best, but Press Lake and Holinshead are on my short list. The only problem is they always seem to be full. I guess that's a good sign."
