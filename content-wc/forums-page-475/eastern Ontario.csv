We caught smallmouth and didn't have stuff for trout. However, Algonquin is high elevation, rock, low nutrient count in water, and the streams draining the lake that are impassable to fish. I fished Jack Lake to the south off 28 near Apsley many years ago and it was packed with perch, bass, and some walleye. the lakes in your area looks decent, but have a good amount of road access which may equal cottages or fishing pressure. lotsa lakes to choose from in that area. Give us a report when you retrun if you can.If you are passing through Toronto, you might plan to miss the rush hours as it can be very slow. If you are taking 400N to 11 N above Toronto, I'd suggest avoiding the ETR/407 tool road. It can be very expensive ($28 each way when pulling boat) from QEW to 400. also if taking route 11, check out Weber's charcoal dogs/burgers, north of Orilla, you'll see a pedestrian bridge, lotsa cars and a line for food!"

Cope lake has a good population of small mouth and last spring was stocked with rainbows which are now 12 to 14 in. My SIL knows the area well but not a die hard fisherman and was looking for some pointers , thanks again."
