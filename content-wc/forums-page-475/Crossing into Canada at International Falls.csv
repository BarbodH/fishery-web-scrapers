1331812,jignminow,2011-07-20 05:25:00,168,We always aim for Friday at noonish
1331193,Gipper,2011-07-18 14:45:00,76,Is anyone familiar with the wait I might experience at the border in mid-July on a Friday afternoon?
1331197,greg2648,2011-07-18 14:51:00,80,"Since most camps check in on Saturday noon, I would think that the traffic would be light. We were in International Falls on Friday the 8th and it was a ghost town at 5 pm. Traffic picked up after dinner at the hotels. We cross at 5 am on Saturday and we were the only vehicles on the road. hope this helps. Greg."
1331215,Biggerbear,2011-07-18 15:18:00,13,I have been through there at least 15 times and very early morning - 6am or earlier is the best as greg2648 posted. If you plan on getting bait right away after crossing I don't know of any places that open that early. We usually get what we need in Kenora.
1331217,81Saluki,2011-07-18 15:20:00,97,Check out this link. It tells the latest wait times and is fairly accurate from my experience. Good luck and have fun!! :-)
1331227,Jig Man,2011-07-18 15:31:00,95,Crossed on Friday July 8th around 4:30pm. Only 2 cars in front of us.
1331314,wallydave,2011-07-18 18:30:00,2151,"My last couple of trips North have included crossing the border on Friday nights, both times, a total of 6 cars/trucks ahead of us. The hotels and motels in IF are filled with trucks and boats waiting to wait in line Sat AM. Have a good trip the border should be painless, I hope your trip goes well!"
1331414,Lazy Fisherman,2011-07-19 04:37:00,276,"Crossed early afternoon on Friday, July the 8th and had 3 cars in each lane ahead of us."
1331516,jstme,2011-07-19 09:23:00,269,"Not sure but it always seemed to be a shift change time, Light traffic"
1331532,oxdrift2,2011-07-19 09:43:00,37,"We have crossed on Friday afternoon several times. You will have a little wait, but not that bad. As someone else stated , most resorts run from Saturday to Friday, so crossing should be easy."
1331787,MorganMan,2011-07-19 22:07:00,341,We also will cross on Fridays and stay in FF so as to miss the big Saturday lines at the border. Much less stress getting on the road Sat am without being rushed. Have a great trip.
