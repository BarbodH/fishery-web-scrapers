1330183,J.Iverson,2011-07-15 10:46:00,64,Has anyone used ever used the scout bay landing? Is it open to the public? We are trying the Ear Falls side of the lake for the first time and wondering if there is a walleye migration toward the cooler water of McKenzie Bay in Early August. When we fish the Sioux Lookout side it seemed to get better as we got in to the deeper part of the lake early August.

You better hope you don't meet another vehicle on your way in to the ramp unless you are very good at backing a trailer long distances - not room for two to pass. There is an area to park your vehicle & trailer when you get to the end. You may want to consider paying a nominal fee and use Lac Seul Lodges ramp. It's just another mile down the road and has easy access to McKenzie Bay. Also a very nice camp to stay at."

As the other poster said about meeting another vehicle, it would SUCK! Used it maybe 15 times over the years and haven't had that issue yet. Loading is a pain > ramp is sloped to the east and NOT level. From the public boat ramp to the large sand banks it is 14 miles and from Ear falls would be over 25 miles one way. Using the ramp will reduce boating time. You will find the walleyes will move to the bigger/deeper bays like Steamboat bay, Mckenzie bay and the area around Windigo/Manatoba point as the season progresses."

There is 2 creeks that that run into mckenzie that I believe the mckenzie eyes spawn in. I bet I am not alone in thinking this as there is plenty of deep water in steamboat and north of steamboat. I am sure you could go to the sand banks on the opener and catch fish if you wanted to make the run.. any opinions on this thought I would love to hear. As far as lodges go I have only stayed at Gawleys little beaver lodge on lac seul, and was there last week. Great place wonderfull cabins,owners,cleaning house, the whole works and we ran down to mckenzie a few times at 20 miles each way, but wouldn't change a thing.. good luck boys wish I was going up again this summer. Lots of 24 to 28"" eyes!!!!!"

Have never used the public landing but see boats coming & going. Went same time last year & fishing was good! Starting to shop, pack & get all the tackle, rods & reels ready to go. CANT WAIT!!! 14 more days to go to AWESOME walleye fishing on Lac Seul!!! RBF"
