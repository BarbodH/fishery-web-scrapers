559583,Guest,2006-07-20 12:49:00,0,Yes even with a total fire ban you can still use a camp stove to cook your shore lunch. Have used on in the past as well as our guides during a fire ban. Above all just be carefull using any fire.
559558,Guest,2006-07-20 13:04:00,0,Thanks for the confirmation. And be extra careful using those little tripod stoves. I learned a couple years ago that they're very unstable when you put a large frying pan on them. Use rocks to build a platform for the pan.

1331520,Guest,2011-07-19 09:26:00,0,"Hello, I'm a resident of Sioux Lookout, Ontario. There are fires currently fires burning all over Northwestern Ontario and two of them are really big and nasty. My parents own a camp up near Sioux Lookout Fire #70 and are in jeopardy of it burning. The road has been closed and they cant even get in to rescue that cat or any other belongings. I'm crossing my fingers and toes that the camp is spared. As a personal request. I would very much appreciate it if nobody would burn so much as a twig while there up here until the fire ban is lifted. Don't even use a charcoal barbecue. If you wanna cook fish then use a Coleman stove or bring the fish home or to camp and cook it on a normal stove. I'm worried. I'm practically living in a tinder box here. The air is full of smoke, everybody is walking around rubbing their sore eyes and many are coughing and puffing away on their asthma inhalers. This is what we have to live with when the fires are burning. If you don't believe me believe this ---> http://www.lakesuperiornews.com/ForestFires.aspx or ---> http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/268862.html"
1331602,Guest,2011-07-19 12:25:00,0,"Just to add to the above.... Dryden is experiencing quite a bit of smoke now due to the fires up North. Also, Pickle Lake has lost it's power once again as fire has burnt down some more power lines. Definitely worth checking before you travel as things are quite bad in certain areas. And if you do travel up this way, please, please be sensible and follow the advice regarding fires, cooking etc."

1331717,Guest,2011-07-19 17:52:00,0,"This is good for a general overview for this area.http://ckdr.net/news/index.php The official MNR fire websitehttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/268862.html and maphttp://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...ap_English.htm As you can see, not an ideal situation."
559521,Guest,2006-07-19 14:57:00,0,Is there currently a fire ban for Sioux Lookout and the surrounding area? Wondering if we will be able to have a camp fire when we visit next week. Thanks.
559526,Guest,2006-07-19 16:29:00,0,"Good Question, I was wondering that also. It has been so dry in Minn., Wis, and North Dakota that it wouldn't suprise me if Ontario was also in a high fire danger zone now. It would do away with my shore lunches next week. I guess my camp operator will let me know. But would be nice to know before hand as i could then leave some equipment at home."
559527,Lovetofish,2006-07-19 16:32:00,458,Fire Ban on by Pickle Lake. Spoke with camp owners yesterday.
559531,Skyraptor,2006-07-19 18:16:00,291,"The following zones (see map below) are currently under a Restricted Fire Zone until further notice. * Effective at midnight Monday, July 17th, 2006 and until further notice all open burning is prohibited in Zones 1 through 13 of the Northwest Region including the territorial districts of Red Lake, Kenora, Fort Frances, Dryden, Sioux Lookout, Thunder Bay, and Nipigon. For exact locations, please contact your local Ministry of Natural Resources office."
559535,Skyraptor,2006-07-19 18:35:00,291,"New Update: West Fire Region Situation Update Tuesday, July 18th, 2006  19:00 A continuation of warm, dry weather has resulted in an escalated forest fire situation in Northwestern Ontario. As a result of a high forest fire hazard, and a significant increase in forest fire occurrences requiring the commitment of significant fire fighting resources the Ministry of Natural Resources has imposed a Restricted Fire Zone across all sections of Northwestern Ontario. By eliminating human caused fires that result from carelessness the Ministry of Natural Resources can focus its resources on responding to new lightning caused forest fires. Under the Restricted Fire Zone all open burning is prohibited. Campfires are prohibited - even in an outdoor fire grate, fire place or fire pit. There were 24 new forest fires reported in the West Fire Region on Tuesday, marking the seventh consecutive day where over 20 new fires have been reported. There have been 524 fires in Northwestern Ontario so far this year. Smoke in the Thunder Bay area is the result of a large forest fire burning in the United States and several fires aflame in Quetico Park. Smoke will be present in the area over the next few days. If you are concerned with the health effects of smoke from forest fires please contact your local health unit. On Tuesday July 18th, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources provided continuous heavy water bombers support on the U.S. Cavity Lake fire; focusing on stopping the fires advance north. A Canadian Liaison Officer and an Ignition Team, both from the West Fire Region, are working with the American Incident Command Team in battling the fire. A new fire of note that occurred on Tuesday was Sioux Lookout fire 51. The fire is located approximately 10 kilometres east of the northern community of Weagamow in the Sioux Lookout District. Aggressive response by water bombers and FireRangers resulted in the fire being limited to a size of 6 hectares. Excellent progress continues to be made in consolidating hose lines and implementing suppression plans on Sioux Lookout fire 44, Nipigon fires 70 and 81, and Red Lake fire 44.

559550,Guest,2006-07-20 11:11:00,0,Best check with OMNR before you go. There have been incidents of OMNR charging back the fighting costs to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Be safe....

559552,Guest,2006-07-20 11:32:00,0,"I'm pretty sure the ban does not apply to camp stoves. So, you can still have a shorelunch with a camp stove. If I'm wrong, someone will correct me."
