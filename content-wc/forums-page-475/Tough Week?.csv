1331229,Jig Man,2011-07-18 15:33:00,95,Was in Souix Lookout area 7/9 to 7/16. Did not experience a Mayfly problem. Fishing was decent although first time on lake so I have nothing to compare to.
1331230,greg2648,2011-07-18 15:36:00,80,We were in NW Lac Seul same week. No mayflies. Great fishing. We have been going there for several years. This was our best. Greg.
