We always seem to get a flat tire on the outfitter road. Fishing can be tough on those lakes, the regulars catch fish every year. Check out kipawa.net for reports especially from Ksmitty. Bush Country on Saseginaga is the neighboring lake to Ogascanan. A new guy is running the Bush Camp and doesnt care for us Americans so we probably wont stay with him again, but the fishing always is good. The Mullens cousins own the Saseginaga outpost on the south end of the lake and have a few outpost cabins which look nice. Always see mixed results for those lakes and the bite seems to be early and late in the day."
