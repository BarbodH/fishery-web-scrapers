1320505,doubleheader,2011-06-20 12:20:00,2652,"I hate to tell you how long I've been going to Ontario, let''s just say many many years. I remember years ago my parents would get a postcard every year from their lodge, just a ""hello, how you doin"" kind of thing and a re-cap of the year's activities, but it was a personalized message, and it made my parents feel a little special, that they were valued as clients. Over the years things have changed so much with the internet and more recently Facebook. Today and for the last number of years my wife and I and another couple take a two week vacation in Ontario. We love it. I'd have to say we are ideal clients, we keep our cabin area clean, we make very little noise, and we require very little of our lodge owners personal time. I'm sure like many of you we start looking foward to our next trip about a week after we get back from the last one. Our lodge has a website and even has Facebook. Throughout the year I check it out as they had posted a semi-annual Newsletter. But not this year, no update since last year. About two months back my wife posted a simple message on their Facebook page. ""We're under 90 days, see ya soon"". It didn't even illicit a response; there hasn't even been anyone from the Lodge post anything new on their Facebook page since her post. Zip, nada. They sent a reservation confirmation e-mail last week and didn't even attempt to personalize it. They didn't even remember we bring 2 boats. I guess I just don't get it. I certainly understand that lodges get busy, but when you're in the service industry it would seem to me to be a worthwhile investment to take a little time and get to know your customers, take some notes for goodness sake, make your customers feel as though their business is appreciated. Two years ago we moved to this lodge after many many years at another. One of the main reasons we left that lodge was this exact same issue; a feeling that our business wasn't appreciated. For 3 years I asked those people to give us a mattress that was decent enough to sleep on, but they couldn't be bothered, and finally we said that's enough. I just don't understand the new world I guess, spend money on a Facebook account and website you don't maintain but don't spend the time to know your customers."
1320523,camp chef,2011-06-20 12:46:00,915,"The times they are a changing.It's hard to put a finger on why some of the proprieties and considerate behavior that past generations appreciated have gone by the wayside. I think it is a symptom of the degradation of our culture as a whole. We communicate without speaking with each other, those we elect to govern apparently think nothing of lying to us and the service industry( as you experienced) is less about service than it ever has been.My solution (at least temporarily) is to try to lead by example and go fishing as often as I possibly can,with good friends who haven't forgotten how it used to be and still should be. With that said,We have created some wonderful relationships with resort owners in Canada.Keep looking and I am sure you find what you are searching for."
1320527,phishfearme,2011-06-20 12:53:00,1242,"i don't think you're expecting too much but there is a reallity today that many of the outfitters are hurting and simply have to cut back in some areas. regrettably, communications is one - there's almost too many ways to communicate. just think about it: 1 - base phone, 2 - cell phones, 3 - emails, 4 - facebook, 5 - snail mail and others. at the end of the day, many guys have had it and simply ignore some methods. i would bet that maintaining touch with all clients could be a full time job for one or two people for some larger operations - and i'll bet they can't afford this. guys like yourselves who don't ""squeek"" tend to get no oil. where you at in western PA? phish"
1320534,doubleheader,2011-06-20 13:10:00,2652,"We live in Warren, PA up in the NW corner about an hour east of Erie. I appreciate your response, and while I certainly think it would be easy to ""blow"" a lot of man hours (overdoing it in my book), I honestly believe some common sense and organizational skill would allow for a reasonable customer interraction at about 1 manhour/day on average. I mean, what the heck does one do all winter? How about a newsletter or two or some other type of communication thru Facebook or the website? How about taking the time on arrival day to know your clients name when they arrive? Take a picture of the client and write his/her name on it if you have to. Hey, thanks for the reply and GO BUCS!!!"
1320536,v-bay gord,2011-06-20 13:12:00,3168,"Maintaining some form of contact with old guests, and keeping the relationship going, is one of the most cost effective forms of marketing.....and it only makes good sense to do so. The internet makes this easier....not harder. But you still have to make the effort....... v-bay gordwww.electricbeaver.ca"
1320538,Juls,2011-06-20 13:16:00,13414,"Did you put their lodge in the facebook search engine to see if they had a second or even third account? The one your wife posted to might not even be the one they are maintaining, by the sounds of it.I see it a lot on FB. One account is started and then up pops another one...just something to check, I guess. It could be why she never got a response.Juls"
1320541,doubleheader,2011-06-20 13:27:00,2652,"Hi Juls thanks for the response. My wife's pretty savvy in the computer so I'm sure this is their only Facebook account. No, I'd have to say it's just plain ole' laziness."
1320555,tv4fish,2011-06-20 13:50:00,2694,Doubleheader: Some little bird just told me that he thinks the lodge you are referring to won't be around too much longer???Our lodge DOES send out a yearly newsletter with a personal note added.
1320829,smackthewalleyes,2011-06-21 08:21:00,9,"I don't think you are expecting too much at all! I will be heading out on my first trip with L&M Flyin Outposts in mid July and they have been nothing short of AWESOME with everything. From the first time I contacted them to the 150th question I sent them through e-mail! I have NEVER had to wait more than a day for a response. Also, they have updated fishing reports directly from their clients that they post right after each trip! I know I haven't been on the trip yet, but I am VERY confident that they will be a top notch resort because of the way they have treated me so far. I think service like this goes a long way and is what keeps their repeat customers coming back every year. Yeah, e-mail and social networking sites have changed the way people communicate, but I think that it is absolutely awesome! The resorts who keep up to date and are serious with communication and technology will only reach more people yearly and have better business because of it!"
1323378,GarryB,2011-06-27 19:37:00,365,"I recently contacted a resort on Lac Suel asking if they had any cabins that were smoke free as I am extremely allergic to smoke. I also asked if any of the cabins had a screened in porch so one could be outside watching the sunsets without being eaten alive my misquotes.Talk about customer service, I was blown away by the owners reply. Listed below are excerpts from the owners e-mail. No, customer service is alive and well, at least at this resort.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++""I will make sure the cabin that you are staying in Has been super cleaned before you come and will not allow any smoking in cabin 7 or 8 from now on and make them non smoking cabins.I donâ€™t want to lose you as a customer for the that reason.We can even have professional cleaners come in the spring and and have everything scrubbed perfectly. Please let us have a chance to show you that we would be very grateful to have you.We would also purchase a gazebo to place out in front of your cabin in order to stay out of the bugs and still have the lake side view.We sure would love to have you come."""
1323382,Mike Borger,2011-06-27 19:42:00,1554,Now that's going the extra mile. Impressive!
1323428,downriverbob,2011-06-27 20:32:00,880,"I feel really luck my wife and I have been going to same resort on Lake of the Woods for about 15 years. It is small rustic family run resort. We get Christmas cards, emails, and talk on the telephone with the people who own the place. We always bring ""gifts"" for them because it is like visiting family. They do everthing they can to make you happy. BOB"
1323438,Guest,2011-06-27 21:06:00,0,"Actually, what many of us do all winter is work at our second job. My problem maybe is that I am older and new technology comes hard. We send (snail mail) a Christmas newsletter and calendar to all of our guests (this year plus the year before) but chatting on Facebook - no. We do answer emails as promptly as possible and try desperately to remember all of our guests names, as do most of the outfitters I know. It was easier when you had to give us your driver's licence to get a fishing licence. Not that we don't know you but with 500 plus people sailing through each summer, we do mix up names and I HATE that. The driver's licence pic was a great and quick name refresher. But taking everyone's pic? Not very customer friendly"
1323514,doubleheader,2011-06-28 07:05:00,2652,"Nothing wrong with snail mail, in fact I think it's far more personal than e-mail and the like. You're demonstrating interest in your customers. As far as pics are concerned, I'll bet most folks would be happy to have their picture taken with their host at some point during their visit."
1323688,Rich D,2011-06-28 13:59:00,75,"I know exactly what lodge you are referring too and saw your wife's post on their FB page! We'll be heading up in about 3 weeks ourselves. I understand your point although mine is a little different. We are similar to your group. We go up and require very little attention from the owners. I'm very satisfied with them - they don't bug us and we don't bug them. The cabins are clean, the boats are dry and when I did have an issue they were all over it. That will keep me coming back! For me, the personal touch is o.k. but not important. Have a good trip!"
1323764,teddi,2011-06-28 16:46:00,349,you pay your money and you take your chances. if you are not happy go some place else and see how you are treated.
1331105,doubleheader,2011-07-18 11:58:00,2652,"We just got back from our 2 week trip, and I just wanted to report on the hospitality and service we received given my initial post and concerns I raised. All I can say is that while I maintain my conviction that personalized contact is important (making some form of personalized contact with the client during the year), we were treated exceptionally well during our visit. For example, for some reason my kicker wouldn't start. I asked one of the guides for a spare fuel line because I thought my bulb might have gone bad, within a couple minutes the owner showed up and was working on my motor. This wasn't a motor I rented, this was my motor. We found the entire staff extremely courteous and helpful during our stay and it helped make for a great vacation."
1322932,Walley Guide,2011-06-26 18:34:00,67,"You aren't expecting too much and I agree the times are changing. I spent a lot of years at one place, went through the changes from the orginal owner and through a couple more. They all took time to drop you a note and check on you from time to time through the year. Then another set of owners came along, you couldn't reserve a cabin, just a spot and they would decide what cabin you would stay in when you arrived. (took the thought of building memories year after year in a given cabin.) Maybe for some that isn't a big deal, it is all about what the customer desires. The owners wife would rip you if you took an oversize fish out, claiming it would hurt ""her"" business, when her attitude was hurting the business more than you could imagine. (took one oversize fish out of there due to floating on it's side when I tried to release it after it tried to swallow a 1oz spoon, however she failed to ""ask"" just preach the rules and laws of the camp.) What topped it off was them being convicted of breaking the law with the fisheries division after being warned. I have since moved on to better times and better people. Don't worry, if a business out there isn't providing you the customer service you expect, move on, in these times others are out there willing to go the extra mile. By the way the new place we stay asks that we drop them an email when we get home just so they know we made it home safe and sound, started going up twice a year due to how we are treated, makes it easy to look forward to the trip each time, and yes we hear from them through out the year. Amazing....how a little customer service goes a long way. Happy Fishin' Walley"
