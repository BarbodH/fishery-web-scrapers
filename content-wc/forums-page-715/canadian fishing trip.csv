554487,Guest,2006-02-09 09:09:00,0,"I have a friend going to Trail's End Lodge on the Pipestone chain in August. I have never fished there but he says it has everything, walleye, pike, smallmouth, and musky. I think he said it is a boat in. A local judge I know also goes to the Pipestone chain and he stays at Pipestone Lodge. He goes every year and loves it. Ross Camp is also on Pipestone and it looks pretty nice as well."
