555189,rebelrunner,2006-03-05 13:28:00,20,"True/False? An ""Eight-day Sport Fishing Licence"" is available for 2006. It appears so according their webpage. Who can confirm this and relay the USD on such a license?http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/fishing/ocnonresopt.html An Eight-day sure would work in my favor this year! Thanks"

This is a great idea and aimed at those that stay a full 7 nights and like to fish the morning they leave for home. In past years, if you arrived on a Saturday and bought a 7 day license, you would not be legal to fish that following saturday morning before you leave. Kudos to the MNR for listening to outfitters and guests and implementing the change."
