555014,Pooch,2006-03-01 08:00:00,4619,Potential for a good site. Depends on the webmaster's attentivness. NEEDS TO BE MONITORED. First post I read had two responses. One from an on line gambling joint and the other selling property in Vegas. Neither one anyway remotely about the post. Just dumped thier ad there. This will doom the site before it gets started. Always some DA screwing things up for others. Pooch
