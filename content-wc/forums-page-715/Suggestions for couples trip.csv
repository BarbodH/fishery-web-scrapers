554955,Guest,2006-02-27 08:15:00,0,Frolander Island Resort This use to be a great place for a couple. They have nice cabins and really good food. A bit more expensive than the average resort but the spouse will be happy. I do know it changed owners and camp management a year ago. The owner is out of Chicago and not a qualified day to day camp manager unless he hired an experience camp manager I would pass. If the owner is just that an owner and has good people day to day it would be a place to look into. Fishing is good with lots of islands nearby to help minimize the winds which is nice for getting the wife and kids out on the water.

554965,ackermannsacre,2006-02-27 15:47:00,196,Took my wife to Booi's on Trout Lake last year. She wanted to stay for another week but they were booked up solid for the rest to the year. The cabins are bigger and nicer than the small home we live in!http://www.boois.com/index.html
554967,Mohleye,2006-02-27 17:09:00,368,"Thanks to everyone for the ideas. I know people who have been to Booi's, and that was an idea I had already passed on. I will share the rest, except Dutchboy's. That was my first suggestion."
554923,Mohleye,2006-02-24 16:29:00,368,"Just had a buddy of mine call me for suggestions for a NW Ontario trip for several couples. Looking for American plan. His first priority is quality fishing, secondly nice accomodations and food. Thought I would see who has suggestions. Fly-in's are fine, but they do want American plan. Thanks"

554927,dutchboy,2006-02-24 18:00:00,5717,"I would suggest send the ladies to Bloomington Minnestoa, Mall of America. Put them up in a posh hotel for a week. The men would enjoy either Lake of the Woods or Rainey."
554931,Guest,2006-02-24 22:08:00,0,Try Tetu Island Lodge. My wife loves it there.www.tetuislandlodge.com
554936,Guest,2006-02-25 15:01:00,0,"Look at Peace Island Lodge, and Delaney Lake Lodge. Both are fly in American plan very nice resorts"
554940,2 DOGS,2006-02-25 16:51:00,361,"Whitewing Lodge and Fisherman's Cove, both are on the NW side of Lac Seul, need I say anything regarding fishing? Both have nice cabins and both offer a nice American Plan. The down side is trying to get a reservation for 2006 at this late date. You might give them a try though."
554949,Guest,2006-02-26 10:23:00,0,"On Lake of the Woods, I would recommend Red Indian Lodge or Duck Bay Lodge. Both have nice facilities which should appeal to the ladies. Red Indian has more activities for them. Good Luck, Wingmann"
554950,Pooch,2006-02-26 10:41:00,4619,Fly out of Red Lake (15-20 minutes) to Trout lake. Large body of water with about a gazillian islands. (Think small gps unit!) There are a couple of camps on Trout that I know of that both have good reputaions. Green Airways in Red Lake and Bui's camp. Both have websites. We have not fished Trout but fly over it a couple times a year going to another of Green's camps further north. One retired guy I know fills in as a guide there and talks about some really nice fish coming out of Trout. (Known him for a long time and he does not embelish his stories.) We plan on stopping there for an extra week in a couple of years. (retirement) Trout lake is clear and cold. Good Lake trout lake and from what I've been told some good walleye fishing too. Big enough lake that you should consider a guide at first. There are a bunch of American plan camps in Canada. Depends on how much remoteness and human creature comforts you are looking for. Zero in on several camps and post it here. Odds are you will get some good honest answers. These guys tend to say whats on thier mind! Sesaganaga is located near the town of Savant Lake and has an American plan camp. Last time we were there it was getting a little run down but they put a new person in too run the camp and it should be better. Fishing was quite good and made up for a little more rustic camp. A couple drive in or boat in camps that come to mind are Route Lake lodge north of Dryden and O'Sullivans Rainbow north of Geraldton. Have fished both and they are very decent lakes with good camps. Friends (married couple) fish on Wabagaskang (sp) near Ear Falls and keep going back. It is mentioned on this website a lot. Camps on Gullrock just south of Red Lake gets a lot of talk on this site also. Pooch
554953,Guest,2006-02-26 18:42:00,0,"reasonably serious about fishing and don't need much in the way of land-based activities to occupy their time, you might want to take a look at www.witchbay.com It's a very family oriented place and well over 65% return guests each year. Have fun wherever you decide to go. Lunk"
554954,Ia Walihntr,2006-02-26 22:29:00,320,"I second Duck Bay Lodge. Good accomodations, good food, good fishing, guides on staff. www.duckbaylodge.com"
