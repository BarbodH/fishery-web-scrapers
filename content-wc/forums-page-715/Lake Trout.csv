They will hit hard at that presentation. Try about 20 ft. deep and work out from there."
555040,lenray,2006-03-02 09:23:00,467,ON SOME LAKES that have trout we fish them all summer long with the eyes and pike. We troll with a 3/4 oz. Rattle Trap blue to blue silver in color and you have to troll faster than you feel is good .

555063,lenray,2006-03-02 15:56:00,467,I fish for lake trout on very secluded lakes north of LAKE Superior maybe 130 miles north. We fish from May to the last day of September and those we catch in August are suspended but we still catch a lot of them but nothing like the last week of September. Also if you ever have caught one on the first day of October it is a 50.00 dollar fish. Only did that one time. We caught 3 ate two and had a half of one left in the cooler. It was our first time to ever catch trout we were on an adventure to get to another lake looking for eyes. We told the warden about the 2 we had eaten after we had found out we were in trouble--so we had to pay for 3 fish. He said we were ignorant of the law and we were. No excuse for that on our part. Because we confessed to two fish that there wasn't any proof of he said we were ignorant of the law. He said if he thought we were straight our vialotors he would have everything we had there plus the money. It was a mistake on our part and the CO was very good to us and treated us very well and we will never make that mistake again and when we get that book we read everything pertaining to where we fish every year. Fishing in Canada Ontario is something that means a lot to us and we thank our great neighbors to the North for your great hospitality and friendship. We are bush campers.

554934,lazyk,2006-02-25 13:48:00,26,"I know we all love to fish for walleye but I have an urge to try for some lake trout during our vacation in August. Not the best timing I know but I`m looking for general pointers to get me in the right direction. I do have downriggers available but it seems like alot to bring with for only one afternoon of fishing. What are likely areas to find them-do they like structure or do they just suspend in deep water? What are the habits of their baitfish(ciscoes and whitefish) as to what do they eat and what times of day are they active. What colors, bait, presentation has worked for you? How do you handle bringing them up from the depths? Is it worth thinking of returning any(do they survive)? How big of jigs have you used? Is there any correlation between catching them in the great lakes and smaller lakes in Canada, as far as methods used? Chris"
554935,Trailerguy,2006-02-25 14:24:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]That's a ton of questions. Lakers should be deep in August, depending on the lake, at least in Canada. The key to locating them is a water temperature of about 52*, often at 100+'. They do like submerged structure,(rock piles) in deep water, they ocasionally rise a short distance to strucure to feed, but aren't comfortable in warmer water. Lakers don't have a swim bladder like a Walleye so they can be released after being pulled up from deep water. Whitefish and Ciscos are going to spend their time in the same kind of places as the Lakers in August. If you are only planning to spend an afternoon fishing them, I'd use a bobber and a dead cicso lying on the bottum of a deep rockpile or rock point. They are more active morning and evening in my experiance. A temperature guage is more important than the downrigger on a quick trip like that. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
554938,retire55,2006-02-25 16:03:00,1029,"Although I do have fishing days where I only target lake trout, I also fish lake trout during my annual September walleye trip into north western Quebec. On my walleye trips, I target walleyes early morning and dusk till dark. Consequently, my lake trout fishing is restricted to late morning or early afternoon. That's not always detrimental to catching lakers though. Last September, one early afternoon, my partner and I boated and released 6 lake trout between 12:30 and 1:30 PM. I prefer to use a portable downrigger to get my Sutton flutter spoon (#71) to the designated depth (based on water temperature to start and then on what depth is successful). Usually, in September, we catch lakers around 40 foot deep in water that is 65 to 100 feet deep or deeper. Usually there is some structure close by. There's usually a lot of lakers much deeper (e.g. 90 feet near the thermocline) but in our experience, they have not been the active ones. Other methods we have used for lake trout include simply long lining stickbaits, trolling 1 to 2 ounce spoons (e.g Krocodiles) or trolling dead minnows behind long gang trolls (involves lead core line)."
554939,lazyk,2006-02-25 16:32:00,26,"Yeah, I know that`s alot of questions but you gave me lots of good answers. Thanks! At least I`ll have an idea on how to start approaching the basics of laker fishing. How are the populations of lake trout in Ontario? I`ve heard they are on the decline in some areas. But they do taste good in tin foil, butter and seasoning. Chris"
554943,Trailerguy,2006-02-25 20:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Usually, how much traffic a lake has and how much deep water has a direct relationship to what the population is. Wabby has some lakers, but they are more plentiful/easier to catch, down the road on Cliff Lake or out the logging road to Aureobus Lake as an example. Your outfitter should be able to shed some light on where to go in the area you're going to be in. The DNR trys to control some lakes by not allowing additional developement or boat caches on trout lakes. Trout are slow growing in most lakes, in Ontario. Catch and release is benifical in most lakes. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
554945,Guest,2006-02-25 23:10:00,0,"I just love lake trout fishing! It is a nice change of pace. The beginning of August and the end of August are two very different situations. The type of lake will also lead to different fishing tactics. First lets look at lake types. If the lake is deep, not just a deep hole here or there, but large expanses of deep water... I am talking a couple miles of water that is 70 - 100 ft deep. Lakes like that are good spots for a downrigger. Early August, they will likely be spreadout, and following bait fish. As you get towards the end of August, they may start staging in deep water that is near spawning areas. Late August and September can be a real bonanza in these types of lakes. If you are fishing a lake that has limited areas of deep water, then controlled jigging may be your best option. Using a trolling motor to sit on spots, you can use large jigs, heavier tube baits, or heavier jigging spoons. This type of fishing will have you looking for groups of fish in the hole, trying to stay over them, and jigging. If they are held up on the bottom, drop a spoon all the way down, then reel quickly upward. You only need to go about 20 ft up, then drop the spoon back down. Lake trout on inland lakes can give some great action, and as you mentioned, are great for a shore lunch. Try this sometime... If you have a regular grill, oil up the filet, season it well with a cajun spice (I prefer the kind without salt), then on the grill. Don't overcook it. The hot grill will sear the fish on the outside, and keep it moist inside. I think I have one lake trout fillet in the freezer... guess what is for dinner tomorrow. All the best, Agate"
554966,ackermannsacre,2006-02-27 15:58:00,196,We usually fish for lake trout for a day or so every trip to Trout Lake. I take one portable downrigger but do just as well fishing a 3-way with a 3 or 4 oz weight on the other rod. Also use one oz bucktail jigs and spoons. We go in July and the trout are generally 70-90 ft down. We do best trolling or jigging deep channels between islands.
555031,Stu,2006-03-01 17:03:00,472,I have had pretty good luck fishing in Aerobus Bay on Wabby. We usually fish for lakers during our luch break. I thread a wire thru the rear of the fish and put a treble hook in the mouth. I have been told that lakers grab bait head-first. I fish them on the bottom on a slack line w/ a 1/2 oz. weightin at least 50 ft. of water. We usually catch a couple in about 30 minutes. Good luck - Stu
