554928,Guest,2006-02-24 19:02:00,0,"Toby, thanks for the info on the netting situation on Rainy, that seems to help explain the reduced limit on walleyes."
555200,Guest,2006-03-05 17:00:00,0,"The regulations on the canadian side where not put in because of netting. The US based fisherman were basically raping the Canadian side. They were asked to slow down on their development, drop the limits on the US side, and put in a slot size. Being good neighbours, they were given 2 years to curve this. None was done. Actually the reverse. US based fisherman actually went up over the 2 years. Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake were in real trouble from over fishing. The Ontario gov't then passed regulations to slow the day tripping and houseboat traffic. At the time over 75% of all fish caught in Ontario waters were being caught by US based fisherman. Ontario owns about 75% of the water on Rainy Lake. The regs were passed, in order to keep fish you had to be Ontario based. This way, because bed space is controled at the Ontario based resorts, the amount of fish coming out of the lake could be controled. All US based fisherman would have to fish catch and release on the Canadian side. Think about it this way. If it was mexicans fishing and taking out 75% of the fish out of a lake in Texas, how long would it last. This lasted about 4 years. This is still to this day, why Rainy Lake is now one of the best fisheries in Ontario. On the Ontario side we have had slot sizes, sanctuaries, lower limits, property restrictions etc. On Lake of the woods, the limit on the US side was 14 (6 walleye, 8 sauger) on the ontario side it was 2 ( of either). They have finally got in with the times. Anyways, a couple of resorts and guides from MN got together and challenged the Ontario gov't in the NAFTA courts. They said they had unfairly effected their business. It actually stated that they had no where to have shorelunches. Hmmmm sell all the land and then complain you don't have any land. But the Ontario side has lots of crown land on it. The Ontario gov't fought the NAFTA challenge for 2 years, but like every thing else, you can win but you will still lose when fighting US industry. Also if they did lose, Washington trade people would be setting the regulations, not the biologists. So the Ontario Gov't backdown and changed the regulations back. All of the Ontario resort owners and MNR decided to drop the limit to 1 fish a day, to KEEP the US based fisherman to a minimum. They basically decided it would be better to drop the limit for their own guests, than to see the high volume of day trippers back. It has worked very well and the fish are there to prove it."
555202,Guest,2006-03-05 20:25:00,0,"I don't know wher you get your information from, Rainy River is still extensively netted by natives on the canadian side. I live on Rainyy river and the only native first nation on the canadian side. Yes, we net for Sturgeon because were trying to brinig back the population that we didn't destroy! And yes the DNR did extensively net our fish to send the to RED LAKE and the RED RIVER. NO ONE NET WALLEYE ON THE CANADIAN SIDE!!!!!!! ask any of my friends and clients"
555253,Guest,2006-03-07 21:20:00,0,"I didn't want this to turn into an argument, I just wanted a ""heads up"" on the regulations for Rainy Lake. I'm not sure on how the ""Americans"" depleted the fishery as I wasn't there but, I live near Madison WI, and my home lake has hundreds of people on it all season(including ice fishing) keeping limits of 25 panfish, yet the fish are still there.(and this lake is only 2000 acres) And I would imagine the resorts on both sides rely on the tourism dollars so I'm not sure why anyone on either side would want the fishery depleted? I certainly understand the Canadian resorts anger if only the American resorts were getting customers and then taking their boat into the Canadian side and catching & keeping fish, but with the size of Rainy it's hard for me to fathom how keeping more than 1 walleye a day will cripple the fishery(4 total in possession, including what's back at the resort.) Again you guys live up there and know whats going on BY FAR better than I do and I will still enjoy my trip to Canada & Rainy Lake, but it does make me question how a lake like Lac Seul with all the pressure on it, still produces lots of fish(according to the WC regulars) even with less stringent limits than Rainy Lake. Hopefully the fishery in both lakes in outstanding!! Tight lines, Badger Red (aka Mickey)"

I want to know if I can keep fish ALIVE in the livewell and any special size limits for bass, walleyes, etc. Any help on a website or Ontario MNR site concerning this lake is appreciated!! Thanks !!"
554735,Guest,2006-02-20 12:50:00,0,Not sure when the new regs come out but here is the website for '05-'06. http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/gen.html
554741,toby,2006-02-20 20:41:00,49,Yes on livewell-- no bass size limit-- one walleye daily 13.8 to 17.7 in. one over 27.5 in. 4 in possesion on sport license
554764,Guest,2006-02-21 17:29:00,0,"Your right there is no limit on bass from July 1-Nov 30. But from Dec 1-June 30 the limit is 2 fish per day under 13.8""."
554765,Guest,2006-02-21 17:30:00,0,"Thanks for the quick reply folks, it looks like I better get Jesus to help me if we want a ""shore lunch"". If he could feed the masses on just a couple of fish, maybe my 1 walleye per day will go farther with his divine help, otherwise I better pack a sandwich:-)"

554806,Guest,2006-02-22 21:04:00,0,"I don't mean this as any sort of ""put down"" but is the walleye fishery on Rainy that fragile that the limit is only 1 per day? It seems like one of the highlights of a Canadian trip is a freshly caught shore lunch but I think most fishermen could eat more than 1 15"" walleye.(However, I really like fried fish!!!) Again, I'm just questioning the walleye population in Rainy and I will follow the regulations as best as I can. Tight lines to all !!"
