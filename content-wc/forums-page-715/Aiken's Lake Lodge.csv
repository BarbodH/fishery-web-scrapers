Jig and a minnow vertical in 20 to 25 feet during the day and trolling wind blown shore lines in the evening. Accomodations and food was great. We stayed at the Lodge but I did go up and look at the Outpost. It was a grat looking facility, the next time I go up i would stay at the Outpost."

I just loved vertical jigging in 20 t0 25 feet of water on rocky humps for bigger walleye. Portable fish locator a must. If you are going in as a group 8-10, look into the Grey Owl log cabin, 8,000 square feet of pure heaven. Have a look on the web site. W5"
