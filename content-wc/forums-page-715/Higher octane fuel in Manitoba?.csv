555238,PJM,2006-03-07 10:02:00,3516,VMS What kind of motor are you running ?
555240,VMS,2006-03-07 12:13:00,1103,"yamaha 90hp with a modified head. Motor has a bit higher compression, thus the need for higher octane to reduce possibility of detonation. Steve"
555243,Guest,2006-03-07 13:53:00,0,I would guess you are going to need to bring some octane boost with you.
555244,Mike M (Sask),2006-03-07 14:23:00,374,"Octane boost doesn't ""boost"" much. Most of the guys running high performance sleds around here mix their own fuel because even if you find someplace selling high octane, how do you know how old it is. They claim fuel starts to loose octane after 30 days now. It's a mixture of race fuel and regular unleaded. I think the race fuel comes in 2 octanes. Something like 100 and 110 or 110 and 120."
555251,manitobawalleye,2006-03-07 20:31:00,885,our low octane cheap gas here is 89 at the shell station sure their high octane is 90 or more friends yamaha has no problem using premium
555255,2 DOGS,2006-03-07 21:50:00,361,Would aviation fuel work? I thought that was 100 octane. They certainly would have planes there.
555258,PJM,2006-03-08 00:34:00,3516,"VMS If it is a problem, then go to a colder spark plug. That will take some of the heat out of the combustion chamber........."
