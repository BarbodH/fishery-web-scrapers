Any tackle recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Also, it would be great to hear of anyone's success (or lack thereof) at targeting pike from this camp. We will likely spend more than 50% of our time targeting pike. Thanks in advance."

Heavy line has to ba on your rods, why goto big fish lake with gear that doesn't match. I think athabasca has the largest trout caught in a net there, 101 lbs i think."

Since you will be fishing deep I like to use the smaller diameter Superline like 50lb Spiderwire. that will really help you get deeper with a minimum of added weights. You can easily reach 30 feet with a Kwikfish on a straight line with no weight. Huskie Deviles, Luhr Jensen Kwikfish, are the main baits used. I also had good luck with large dodgers rigged as baits but they are difficult to fish deep because of all the drag. The Pike fishing is very good as well. You will mostly fish shallow bays less than five feet of water. Use Bucktails, spoons, plugs and soft plastics. It pays to have some offbeat stuff since the do get fished pretty hard. Lakers is a great place and they will put you on the fish. You don't have to get carried away with buying every color spoon and Kwikfish since you can usually borrow them from the guide if there is a hot color. I'm going to the Spring Bay camp for the first time in mid-June for mainly Pike. Should be a good time. Shoot me an email direct if you have more questions. Tight Lines Doc"
