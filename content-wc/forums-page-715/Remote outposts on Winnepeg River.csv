They have a base house keeping place, and a boat to Lodge that is top notch. at the area that is the base they also have a camp ground. The fishing is great at both areas but the lodge up river is the best and has the area to it's self. here is the web site. Also Eric, River-eye on here has guided for fred off and on over the years http://eaglenest.mb.ca/"

There is one other lodge in Manitoba, and three in Ontario. In Manitoba, There is Pine Island lodge as well In Ontario, there is Tetu island, Caribou falls, and KCR camp. In my opinion, Eaglenest has the nicest location, and the most bang for the buck, and the most return staff."
