554875,jigman 2003,2006-02-23 12:23:00,981,"Since I am about losing it thinking about fishing in Canada, I thought it might be interesting to share what worked best for you last year (or everyday if you're a Canadian). For me, an electric blue 4"" twister on a black/gold sparkle 3/8 ounce jighead was the hot lure last year. Other colors with lots of sparkles also did well. I worked these jigs on current breaks, windy points, and in thick timber (Ogoki Reservoir). It was the first time I ever gave some of these colors much of a chance. Wish I would have done it sooner. Wow guys, nobody wants to share?"

554889,Guest,2006-02-23 19:08:00,0,I too am an avid jig fisherman. I tip with various baits and use various sizes to 1/2 oz. I make my own and my favourite colour is chartreuse. On many days I have done the best with unpainted or natural lead colour. I prefer to hunt the fish with the heavier jigs to stay on bottom and then move to a lighter slower presentation when I find a good group. I also like to vertical fish with live bait right beside the boat while anchored just like ice fishing. Works real well.

554915,Guest,2006-02-24 11:29:00,0,"Not fished straight down. Just tap it to the bottom every few seconds to make sure you are close. ""Carry"" it, the bulk of the time. It works well, especially in stained water, or when drifting in a little deeper water."

554942,Ohio fisherman,2006-02-25 18:12:00,989,"As the other person said, not hard just use the proper weight and shoot for 45 degrees and just tickle the bottom. Of course, it the drift is too slow - add some power to make it work better. But someone asked for favorite and mine is drifting a bouncer rather than trolling becuase it is silent."
