554960,jigman 2003,2006-02-27 12:11:00,981,Can someone tell me the quickest place to pick up some cigars and beer after crossing at Pigeon River? I cross there and then head to Armstrong. I'd like to pick up some of these items without getting too far off the highway. I think there is a store on the left side of the road (as you're heading to Thunder Bay) shortly after you cross the border. Don't know the name. Does anyone know if that place sells beer and cigars? Anyone know a good brand name of cigars? Thanks
