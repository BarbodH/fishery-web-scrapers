555226,Guest,2006-03-06 18:37:00,0,I have decided to bring my own rig with me this year to fish the Ottowa River. Any one tell me what if anything I have to know about border crossing towing my own rig. Anything in the way of extra paperwork etc. I may need. I know people have asked this but I don't remember what was said and there doesn't seem an easy way to search the posts.

Combine that with your proof of identity and you should be all set. They may ask how much gas you have....I tell them ""just what is in the boat"" I do not know how much you can bring across without paying duty... Steve"
555230,iamwalleye1,2006-03-06 20:41:00,1589,when you get to the border they will have to register your boat there. The form number is E99 trailer and boat numbers needed! Good luck!
555231,esgrams,2006-03-06 20:58:00,92,"I have gone to Canada at least 30 times with my own boat and have never had to register it, I've never even heard that you have too, when did that start?"
555232,2 DOGS,2006-03-06 21:10:00,361,I believe the E99 is only necessary if you leave the boat up there. Say you go up twice and leave the boat on the first trip because you'll be back in a month. The E99 is for when you aren't with the boat.
555233,Guest,2006-03-06 21:29:00,0,"registration, you might want to consider proof of insurability as well. I get a card from my auto/boat insurance guy - a Canada Inter-Province Non-Resident Insurance Liability Card. Just an extra step in proof should something go wrong."
555237,pfg1,2006-03-07 01:03:00,52,"We cross at Pigeon River every July. We have always filled our onboard gas tank and left portable tanks empty. We then fillup the portable tanks in Kekabeka Falls, Ontario. The USA border guys never ask about gas on the way back into USA. Good luck, David"
555241,Guest,2006-03-07 12:45:00,0,Thanks for the information. I always go over 1000 islands bridge and never had any major issues with customs yet. Over the last ten years they only checked my truck once and it was nothing. It seems like the boat thing is nothing to hard either to hear you guys tell it. Again thanks for the help I hope the walleye are as easy to catch as information is to get.
555245,dave10,2006-03-07 15:48:00,342,"I checked into this last year, and learned about the need to have the separate proof of insurance cards on the boat and the vehicle (your agent will get them for you), as well as the need to get a license plate for your trailer, even if you don't need one in your home state, as is the case here in Wisconsin. Also, I learned about the need for snap-shut safety chain hooks (as opposed to the ""S"" hooks found on most safety chains). I wasn't checked closely at Fort Frances, which is where we cross, but I felt it was a lot better to be safe than sorry. Dave"
