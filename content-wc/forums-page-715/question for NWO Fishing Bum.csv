Wondering if you could suggest the best weight and best way to pull spinner rigs in deeper (25-35 ft) water. We usually set up a 3 way system using a 3/4 to 1 oz dropper weight, but after reading your info on jig size, I'm not sure that weight range is heavy enough. We usually pull a floating spinner rig with a leech, about 3-4 feet behind the 3 way swivel--dropper length about 8-10 inches. Thanks for any input."
554976,Guest,2006-02-27 22:36:00,0,"That is certainly an option. I haven't used a 3-way a lot, but have at times, and it has certainly produced. When I did, I used a similar set-up. Much like with the jigs, the weight must be adequate to stay on bottom, given the speed you want to go in conjunction with the aggressiveness of the fish. Obviously, you can adjust your speed and thus the weight necessary according to fish behaviour, less aggressive fish often requiring a slower presentation. When you really need to slow down is when you'll probably want to switch over to jigs. Lindy rigging is another option, but I got hooked on bottom bouncers several years ago now, and haven't went with much else too often. I use the standard bottom bouncers, and weights vary from 3/4oz. for anything less than 15-17, up to 2oz. for anything around 35 or deeper. The key is for the bouncer to be on bottom, and JUST on bottom. Most agree you need enough line out to be just on bottom, and to maintain a 45 degree angle between your line and the vertical. There are many considerations to bottom bouncing and related techniques . . . Phil Rolfe has a good review of bottom bouncing techniques for walleyes, and he covers a wealth of such considerations:http://www.justfishontario.com/botto...ing_a_to_z.htm It's a good read!!

554978,Guest,2006-02-28 06:18:00,0,"Thanks again for your reply. I had read earlier the article by Mr. Rolfe, and have used a bottom bouncer a few times. Being a novice walleye fisherman, but a professional cheapskate, I found the 3 way swivels and dropper with weights quite a bit cheaper, though I realize the wire will aid in moving over certain structure without the hangup of droppers. Again, thanks for your info."
554983,Guest,2006-02-28 09:08:00,0,"NWO - Another question...I always was taught by my Grandfather growing up that I should never fish for walleye deeper than 35 feet because if I want to release the fish, it will die anyway because of air bladder issues. What are your experiences with deep water walleye fishing. Pros and cons."

555148,Guest,2006-03-03 11:05:00,0,What I really like to use is an old catfish ear sinker and tie it on about a foot above a treble hook with a gob of Catfish Charlie Stink Bait. Cant trool with it but you can tight line it and the Walleye love it.
