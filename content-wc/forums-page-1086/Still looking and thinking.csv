I have fished both ends with only moderate results. Where do you do best? What time of yr?Looks like i will be going over Mem day to Souix lookout, any tips.I tried to respond via your e-mail icon but says"" no user""Fishnut"
506757,Guest,2000-01-22 12:07:00,0,"I fish out of fishermens cove near scout bay on the west side. we fish each day a different area. macintosch bay, south bay,and the area east fron manitoba point. we go the week after the 4th of july each year.early in year is supposed to be better however the weather is more coopertive at this time.I look for weed beds that go out to 12' of water and try to fish that edge.I use a floating jig with spinner home made with a lindy sinker 3/8 ounce tied anywhere between 12-24 inches in front depending how close to bottom you want bait to be. also when its real windy I like going to that side of island where there is rocks and boulders out in water 6-8' deep and cast jigs right up to the rocks and bring bring back as slowly as possible without loosing lures. good boat control is a must or you will be in the rocks!I call that fishing the raggged edge!"
506745,Pooch,2000-01-04 20:15:00,4619,"Have looked at Sturgen, St. Joseph and others for next years trip with my wife. We have never fished Lac Seul. Walleyes are my passion so we are looking for size not numbers. Any thoughts on which part of the lake or camps you like or dislike? Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated. Drive in camps are OK if not rowdy or crowded. Are there any camps or cabins on the north shore of Lac Seul? Thanks..Pooch"
506746,fishnut,2000-01-05 10:29:00,46,"Pooch,I've fished both ends of the lake and recomend the East out of Souix Lookout. Chamberlin Narrows on the NE side has rep for big 'Eyes and muskie. It's a long run from the launch site but the camp brings down a large boat each day that you can follow if you have your own boat. I don't have the name of the resort in front of me but I can send it to you. There are quite a few out of Souix Lookout.It's a big lake. Get a good map and bring your GPS.Looks like I'm going up there over Mem day but I may try Minnitaki Lake which runs into Lac Seul and maybe take one day to Lac Seul. Minnitaki has Trout."
506747,River_eye,2000-01-05 17:57:00,1486,"Have you considered eastern Manitoba? There are a few excellent boat-in lodges on the Winnipeg River just over the Mb/On border. Excellent fishing for Walleye, Smallmouth Bass, and Pike. A couple of the lodges offer day trips to Crowduck lake (Trophy Walleye fishery), where walleye's under 20"" are EXTREMELY hard to find, no exageration here. The lodges on the Winnipeg river are also a lot more accessable."
506748,Guest,2000-01-11 11:45:00,0,"Two words for you---St. Joes. No crowds, size, and quantity. Two resorts on the lake with NO other cabins."
506749,Guest,2000-01-12 09:58:00,0,"I would highly agree with GWB. Lake ST. Joe is a great lake for walleye, both size and numbers. Take a look at the latest issue of In Fisherman. They pick the top ten walleye lakes in Ontario. Lake St. Joe is number four on the list. They call it the Erie of the north. Having been there for the last three years, and also planning on this year again, I would have to agree."
506750,Guest,2000-01-12 18:40:00,0,IN FISHERMEN LISTED 10 BEST LAKES. WHAT ARE THE NAMES OF ALL 10?
506751,Ron,2000-01-19 08:50:00,387,Where is lake St. Joe?Thank You
506752,Smitty,2000-01-19 12:01:00,1934,Any recommendations on a lodge with a reasonable housekeeping plan? Ballpark weekly rates would be appreciated.
506758,Pooch,2000-01-20 07:52:00,4619,Thanks for everyones suggestions. Looks like the wife and I are headed for Sac Bay camp on Sturgen over the fourth of July week. Then back north of Red Lake in August. Thanks again.Pooch in central Illinois
