506851,chrism,2000-01-22 17:46:00,429,"Hey Walleyeman!How's it going?The stone barn is south of wee-too about 5 miles. It is actually straight across(west) from Glen Harbour. If you are not familiar with the route to get there - from Regina(?) just go through Silton and follow the higway (NNW) about 15min till you see a white church perched atop a hill on the west side of the road. Turn here to Glen Harbour, drive across the lake into the mouth of a big bay, and the stone barn is more or less a decrepid pile of junk and stones on the southwest side. Can't miss it. I have heard the fishing has been OK there this year. Hope this helps.CM"
