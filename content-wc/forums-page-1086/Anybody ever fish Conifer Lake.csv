The boats and other equipment were very adequate. I'd give the whole experienced a big thumbs up.The fishing on Sumach was outstanding in terms of numbers, especially walleye. My teenage son caught 60 one day, all between 17"" and 20"". We also caught northerns and a few lake trout. Our group didn't find any big fish, but that doesn't mean they aren't there."
