506841,Guest,2000-01-20 09:04:00,0,Anyone familiar with Duroboats? I have a 15' Duroboat (no rivets) that has developed a leak along the keel (possibly from poor trailering). Attempts to locate the leak by putting water in the boat have produced only a slight drip in the transom area but in the water it takes water on fairly fast (maybe 2 gallon per hour). Any ideas out there?
