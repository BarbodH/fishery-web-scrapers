From the sounds of this board, it is a good fishery, but I havn't heard of the lake being very spectacular from anywhere but on this board. Are the walleye populations spread evenly throughout the lake or do you have to travel far from town, or fish near the inlet/outlet streams? I'm not looking for a detailed description, but just some general coments from people who are familiar with the lake. Thanks."
