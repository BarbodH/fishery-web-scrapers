We liked NW Ontario, but other places would be considered. We fly out of Phoenix,(flying into a large city and then driving(ie.,Minneapolis to Emo 400mi) is more economical). Prefer a quit, secluded lodge you can drive to, that has an american plan. Any comments or suggestions would be appreciate, thank you in advance."

Watch for ""Rivereyes"" who frequents this page - he works at one of the lodges and would probably be more than happy to fill you in on the details. And those two lodges are reeaallll quiet! CM"
