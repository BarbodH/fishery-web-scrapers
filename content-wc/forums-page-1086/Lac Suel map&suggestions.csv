506843,Hammer,2000-01-21 14:03:00,12,My father and I will be fishing out of Lost Island lodge on Lac Suel May 28th. Which is located east of Hudson about 4 miles. We are looking for a detailed map of the area along with techniques and suggestions. Thanks for the reply.

Lac Seul has 4 sections. You will want the Southeast section. They cost about 7 or 8 bucks. They are also in color. Good luck Bill Wyss"

I have fished there a number of time, usually stay on Big Vermillion (Lake trout) and launch at Hudson for Lac Seul. Looks like I may be up there the same time as you and would like to know how you do. I can give you some spots if I know your e-mail address."
