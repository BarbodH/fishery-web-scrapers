506870,Guest,2000-01-25 18:06:00,0,I HAVE FISHED THE STURGEON LAKE NORTH OF IGNACETHERE IS PUBLIC DOCK SOUTH OF CAMP MID GAURD.WE USED THIS TO FISH THE LAKE. ALSO ABOUT 5 MILESSOUTH OF CAMP MID GAURD THE STURGEON RIVER HAS A BOAT ACCESS TO IT. THIS IS A PUBLIC ACCESSNOT VERY EASY TO USE. IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL YEARSSINCE I HAVE USED THIS RAMP. HOPFULLY THIS IS STILL THEIR. I SUGGEST YOU FISH THE MAINLAKE FOR WALLEYE. THE MAIN LAKE IS USUALLY VERY GOOD IN THE SPRING. JUST AS SOON AS THE SEASONOPENS. THE NORTH END BY CAMP MID GAURD IS PROTECTED AREA FOR A WALLEYE SPAWN IN THE SPRING.YOU CAN FISH BY RUSTY MYER FLYING SERVICE IN THE SPRING AND GET ALL THE WALLEYE YOU CAN EAT.
