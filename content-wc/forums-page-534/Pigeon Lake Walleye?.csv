1200987,Ruddiger,2010-05-16 18:29:00,649,"Howdy, Sorry to be of little help as I have not been up there this year, however, I have usually done well with suspending cranks, floating Rapalas, jigs, swimbaits and Mepps tipped with crawlers on deep weed lines and shallow flats. I will be up there in a couple of weeks so I may be able to give you more information thereafter. Good luck. Take care, Ruddiger"

1209552,Ruddiger,2010-06-12 17:45:00,649,"Howdy, I apologize for taking so long to get back to you on my trip to the Kawarthas. I was up there the week before the muskie opener to do some panfish and walleye fishing. The panfish bite was, as usual, insane to say the least. I had to work a little harder for the eyes but I did have some success on the following: 3 inch Berkley Gulp minnows jigged on deep weedlines in 10-12 feet of water. 1/8 to 1/4 jigs worked best. Top areas were weeds by 3 Sisters Shoal on Pigeon and the Back Channel by Big Island. I also took fish along the ""muskie highway"" on Buckhorn. 4 inch Storm Swim Shads in the same areas, as well as the 5 inch Berkley swimbaits, fished Doug Stange style, in the same location. If you have not tried this on the tri-lakes area, you are missing out. It is one of the best baits I have thrown for Kawarthas walleye and muskie...seriously, it works. 5 inch Berkley hollow belly swim baits. This thing is amazing. Totally weedless. I did very well on walleye on very overcast days in the shallow end of Pigeon in 4-5 feet of water fishing it over the flats. It's surprising to find fish that shallow but they were there. Run a fluorocarbon leader as the skies like them too. Take care, Ruddiger"
