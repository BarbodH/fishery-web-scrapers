Long story short, I am not heading to Alaska and will be back up to Wabaskang June 12-19. With the unusually warm spring, how much will the fishing patterns change? I have only ever needed to fish the weed lines to catch plenty of walleye. Will this go to more of a jig bite off of rock structure? To be safe on bait, I plan on bringing a flat of crawlers for jigging and running harnesses. What else might I be missing? Also, I heard 502 has been improved. So you can travel more than 40 mph without having your trailer fall apart? Can't wait and looking forward to the tug tug on my line! Thanks in advance for any help."

I think you will find (despite the early spring/summer weather) that the fishing pattern on Wabaskang will remain (as we have seen so far) pretty consistent. Weeds will always produce fish on Wabby. The primary difference this year is that the weedbeds are developing faster. I would be shocked if you have to fish any deeper than 14 feet by June 12th to catch fish. Not saying that there won't be fish deeper, but 14' and less should still be holding plenty of fish. Mid-lake humps could very well be going if the weather trends continue.Recent rains have cooled surface temps back to around 60 degrees which should result in an excellent bite on minnows, crawlers and straight plastics etc.502 was redone about 3 years ago and is in excellent shape. That 30 mile stretch or so in the middle that used to be a washboard is now a breeze. Have an excellent trip."
