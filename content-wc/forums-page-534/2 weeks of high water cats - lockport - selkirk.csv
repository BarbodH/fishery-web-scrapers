At least the day time bite. It was hard to get anchored anywhere near the main current and allmost impossible to land a big cat in it anyway so most anglers were sticking tight to shorelines and in the current breaks. we were doing ok during the day light hours but the shore fishermen were reportting awesome catches tight to shore and late at night and early in the morning. Days went by, the river peaked and started dropping and pretty soon we were getting anchored a little farther out, just enough to catch a piece of the channel and we started getting into the fat ones. The other night we hit one of my high water holes and nailed 18 cats in 3 hours between my girlfriend and myself. A couple of small ones, a pile of those cookie cutter 32 inchers, and a few between 34 -36 inches. Shes is becoming a hard core catter and would rather do that than head out for bass, walleye or anything else.....even though the 36 almost pulled her into the river when it ran ...lol. That night the water temp hit 69 degrees and the cats are ready to explode. The next month should be awesome. here are some pics from the last few weeks. enjoy."
