1206079,Warrior56215,2010-06-01 20:26:00,46,I heard that there is a spot on Dogtooth where you can troll crankbaits for Crown Royal. You should have someone show you that spot.

1208351,Guest,2010-06-08 21:19:00,0,Heading up on 12th. Any reports yet? Wondering about lake level and getting over to Kilvert. Are fish in bays or more main water haunts? Any water temps? Seems like it has been very warm spring and patterns may be a bit differnt than usual. my email is [email protected] if anyone wants to exchange some info.
1209658,joe dahlquist,2010-06-13 08:06:00,9,Well guys the fishing was okay. the fish are already moving out onto the reefs and going into there summer patterns. the water temp was 66 AND THE WATER IS UP . The mayflys are starting to come out and then i would guess the fishing will slow down.`we caught fish from two feet of water down to 35ft of water. i dont have enough time to write about all the spots that we caught fish.My litlle girl needs some daddy time. If you want any info call me 715-482-8299 and ill shoot you some more info. thanks for all the help every one..
