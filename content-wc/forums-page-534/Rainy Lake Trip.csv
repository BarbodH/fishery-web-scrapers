1209304,Jeff Jones,2010-06-11 12:45:00,49,We leave for our trip to Rainy at Amik Lodge in about 30 days. Our target species is smallmouth. But also want to catch northerns and pike. Can you guys give me a list of your favorite lures to use up there? Any help is appreciated.

We also had good luck on crawdad colored crankbaits and either drawdad colored rattletraps or gold colored. 5/16oz white spinnerbaits/chart trailers worked well as well as Tiny Torpedos worked slowly. The other thing that worked periodically was senko type baits. Personally we never had much luck on tubes but its bc we could not seem to keep them out of the rocks. The key on LOTW was small rocks and any isolated rock. I know your questions were about Rainy but I would guess they are similar. Good luck and please post a report when you return."
