One other time I was up there I rented a boat on Sparrow lake and caught a bunch of Bass and Pike which was fun. Just wondering if there were any other options without spending $400 on a charter. Any ideas would be helpful! Thanks!"

It has great jumbo perch, whitefish, trout, walleye, ling and pike fishing. You can easily fish form shore for perch if you can't find a boat to rent. I typically only ice fish on Simcoe but I am sure there are plenty of places to rent small fishing boats in and near Orillia. If you do rent a small fishing boat, you must pay attention to the weather since the lake can get rough quite fast. If you do decide to rent a boat I don't think it will be difficult to find some perch. There are some decent whitefish and trout grounds too, but you need a long anchor to vertical jig at depths of 60 to 80 FOW. You could probably three way/lead core for trout though.I am not sure where to go for walleye or pike around the North end of the lake. Couchiching is a shallower lake and has bass, perch, pike and walleye etc.. I have never fished here, but again I am sure there are places to rent boats from.Try here for more info: http://www.lakesimcoemessageboard.comhttp://www.ontariofishingforums.com/...ching-fishing/http://www.visitlakesimcoe.ca/page.asp?pageid=10003http://ontariomarinas.notjustfishing...trentals.shtmlhttp://www.lakesimcoemarine.com/Rent...S/Default.aspxhttp://www.bluebeaconmarina.com/rent_a_boat.htmlGood luck!"
