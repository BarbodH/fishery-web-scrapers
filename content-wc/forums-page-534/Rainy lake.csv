We like to find a public boat launch and then head out to an island to camp, is this feasible in this area? Appreciate any input or suggestions anyone has. Thanks."

Best public launch I have ever used.If you head East through the Brule Narrows you will come upon the camp sites. You need to check in at the park office before going in, there you can pick up maps for the camp sites. Just make sure you stay off the house boat sites. They get a bit testy about that. It's always best to go in before (Thursday) or after (Sunday) the week end to get the best choice of sites. VNP is popular and the sites will fill during prime time.You will have a great trip if you.........A) Use common sense around rocks and islands.B) Watch the weather. Storms move fast through the area in the summertime.And please, leave everything the way you find it. Bring out your trash and be sure campfires are out.Have a great trip!!"
