1207582,Guest,2010-06-06 16:57:00,0,Our outfitter fly's in our beer a week before we arrive and does not charge us for this service.. This year we are paying $37/case for Labatt's blue.. We fly out of Red Lake.. We do have a strict weight limit (100 lbs) and we would not be able to meet this requirement (we bring in all of our food) with our beer..
1207737,Stu,2010-06-07 07:54:00,472,"Hey Kona, who is your outfitter? Will he bring in food too?"
1207823,LoDo,2010-06-07 12:18:00,721,"We are using Chimo air to fly us out of Red Lake this summer. We are flying 50 miles west to Donald Lake, which is located in the Woodland Caribou Park."
1207824,phishfearme,2010-06-07 12:26:00,1242,our outfitter charges about $40 per case to have it there for us - pretty cheap for such a service. phish
1207926,SSA,2010-06-07 19:20:00,19,I bought some Molson Canadian Light at the beer store today (24 of cans) and the price was 41.50 from the beer store. Exchange is pretty nil but neverless still acouple cents worth to be factored in. Im surprised a outfitter is charging 37.00 a case to be flown in ahead of time as thats less than what you can buy it for at the beer store. Labatts products are approx the same price as Molson products.
1208044,campchick,2010-06-08 07:25:00,96,"You're correct - usually the 2 major beer companies, (Molson and Labatts), charge the same prices for their beer. However, there has been a sale on Blue and Blue Light for the last few weeks. $6.00 off per case, so the outfitter is passing the savings on to his guests. There is a new brewer on the scene and they are finally getting their product (Boxer) to the beer stores in Ontario. I think Labatt's is going head to head with them on pricing as it is a discount beer. Boxer is getting good reviews so you might want to try a case or two."
1208125,Guest,2010-06-08 11:22:00,0,Stu- Our group uses Loon Haunt outfitters.. I am not sure if Bill would fly-in food ahead of time but you can contact him thru his website www.loonhaunt.com.. This will be our fifth year with Bill and he seems to have a lot of repeat and loyal customers.. I quess that is the best guage of an outfitter.. Walleye fishing is always good for quantity//quality and the cabins and equipment are always in good shape.. Beer Cost-- Campchick is correct on the Lablatt's promo.. Bill contacted us in May to let us know about this promo ($37 per case) and Bill purchased the beer then for our group.. Another side service that he did not have to do for us but we appreciated his efforts (saved us $72)..
