1208522,NYBowHunter,2010-06-09 09:23:00,35,Be especially wary after a heavy rainstorm - I haven't been on this road in a few years but I still don't think it is graded every day and after a storm it's like driving on speedbumps the entire way.
1208553,bloom08,2010-06-09 11:02:00,13,I thought you didn't have to travel the old clova road. Thought the new road went to Parent from Mont-Laurier and then from there it was a about a 55 minute ride to clova on a well kept gravel road. http://www.caesars-northcamps.com/wa...camps-eng.html
