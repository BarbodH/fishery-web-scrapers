575499,Fish_on,2008-06-26 06:03:00,1856,Stay out. Seriously I have fished it many many times for 25 years. It's very remote and I like it that way. :)

There are a few water crossings and a lot of mud puddles. Just keep'er rolling. The launch is not real good either. I haven't been there for about 6 years, but fished it for 15 years befor that. We also rented boats from Flayer's resort for a week and stayed out on islands. They will rent a boat and motor, or you can bring your own motor. The fishing is great. Early season the fish are shallow, late season they are deep(20-30'). Northerns sre in any weedbed you find. There were some smallies on some of the rocks. Walleye were on rocks or just next to them."
