1209338,eyefanatic,2010-06-11 14:51:00,25,I know that it is still early in the season but I am surprised at the lack of chatter on the fishing reports for Lac Seul (Ear Falls).
1209355,Steve of Madison,2010-06-11 16:00:00,230,Just alot of chatter from the Iowa crowd
1209390,rather-be-fishin,2010-06-11 19:36:00,429,"Just talked to someone who got back from Scout Bay, Onaway Lodge yesterday.....said it was some of slowest fishing they have had in many years. Caught most of their walleye in Broad Lake and in the far northeast end of McKenzie Bay. Fish were scattered and they would bite for 1 hour and then totally shut down. They did catch more bigger fish 20+ inches than other years."
1206056,bpetersen,2010-06-01 19:44:00,251,Heading up in a couple of days. Just curious how the walleye bite has been in the Northwest arm of Lac Seul. Any particulars would be appreciated.
1206122,Knoxabilly,2010-06-01 21:57:00,225,"I was there a week ago, experienced some of the slowest fishing in the 15yrs i've been going there. I fished Sawmill Bay the whole time, the walleyes were still up shallow, 4 foot was the depth, we caught them 4-10 ft, did well off of Radar Island, fish were scattered, would pull up to a spot catch a few and then wait. Did not get into any schools, caught on jig and minnow or leech and lots of action on slip bobbers set a few feet of the bottom. I did not get any large northern either, most of my camp was having about the same experience, I know one group really got into them in sawmill, they are there but with the early ice i guess i didn't know where to find the big schools."
1206465,bpetersen,2010-06-02 21:04:00,251,Thanks
1206476,skindzier,2010-06-02 21:58:00,137,I'm betting with the early ice they're already starting to migrate toward Steamboat & McKenzie.
1208138,chock,2010-06-08 12:00:00,19,"Does anybody have any reports lately? We are heading up this Friday and have not seen or heard too much. Are the fish still in the same places? We usually spend the most time at the sands in McKenzie. We will usually hit Lunker Point closer to the resort. I have been hearing that the weather is hot and early ice out, etc. Did that change anything for the walleye and pike? Any help would be appreciated."
1208226,KTroller,2010-06-08 15:50:00,237,"Chock, I heard from our resort last week and they said they were slightly deeper but not too deep 10-13 ft. Didn't get much more than that from them. Where are you staying? We're heading up early Saturday morning for an afternoon arrival.KT"
1208326,LoDo,2010-06-08 20:27:00,721,"Gents, I stayed in Rat Bay and drove to McKenzie all week. The fishing was solid all throughout McKenzie, both little and big sands and down through the Ghost Narrows and into Broad Lake. Fish are in 67 degrees and warmer. Jig and minnow and trolled Rapala's. Several over the slot walleyes and large northern on the Rapala's. I've experienced tough results in the Ear Falls, Sawmill and Fish Sanctuary in early June. LoDo"
1208425,chock,2010-06-09 06:41:00,19,We stay at Evergreen. This will be the fifth year in a row going the same week in June. We like to fish McKenzie as much as possible depending on the weather and wind. We have definately had our best luck over there and is worth the little bit longer distance. We also do not like to spend a lot of time in Sawmill or the sanctuary. We have fished it before and have caught some fish but just prefer other spots.
1208754,IowaWalleyeGuy,2010-06-09 21:35:00,47,"Chock, I will also be at evergreen lodge starting sunday, second time there, last year we went two weeks earlier and it was cold and hard fishing. Stop by for a beverage if you get a chance, we'll be in one of the camping cabins. Look for a 1999 alumacraft trophy 175.Good fishing !!!!"
1208829,chock,2010-06-10 06:37:00,19,"IowaWalleyeGuy, now thats a small world. We will be staying at the other two camping cabins. I see in your profile that you are from Ankeny. I live in Elkhart and most of our crew lives in Iowa."
