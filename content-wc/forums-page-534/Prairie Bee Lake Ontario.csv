The most current posts are pretty dated.I am going up for a three day weekend soon and it was a very last minute deal. The lodge owner told me that fishing has been tough with all the heat but it looks like it will cool down by next week. My expectations are not that high, but I am bringing a buddy that has never been fishing in Canada so I am hoping for at least some decent fishing. Any tips or other information would be appreciated. thanks.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"
1205156,TIGHTLINER,2010-05-29 09:06:00,223,Read my post of several days ago The np were hitting good however the walleye were slow. A total of 426 caught by 4 guys. I just got a email from the camp and they said the fish started to hit better once it cooled down so you should have some better fishing. Most all lakes in ontario are down from where they should be because of the lack of snow melt. Ramsey lake is about 100 miles north of your place. I take it this is just off of 17 east of the soo? Good fishing and don't forget to post a message after the trip..

I would try fishing in the narrows, jigging with live bait. I'm pretty sure the narrows is just south of the camp. We always caught fish but fishing has been slow. The heat really got to the fish but now that it has cooled down it should be better. The bass are on their nest right now, so sight fishing is very easy right now. Please remember if you catch a bass off the nest, PLEASE release them back right away as they are protecting their nest."

There is all kinds of structure around it. Just don't get too close, the buoy is there for a reason! Also, work the island that is just east of the marker buoy. Best of luck. Let us know how you do."
1205449,dosxx,2010-05-30 17:52:00,60,Thanks to those who posted a reply. This is about my 10th trip to Ontario but never have I gone in on such short notice. The info gives me a good place to start. I will post when I get back.

The hosts, Tom and Bonnie were very friendly and helpful. He sent us to a spot where we caught fish right away. Fishing was good first day, poor the second, and somewhere in between the third day. We did not really target walleye as much as I usually do because I just wanted my buddy to catch fish on his first trip to Canada. We used no live bait. I think we caught 6 walleye total all in 10' or less. They are still working the fire scenes on 101 but they appeared all out. No problems at all ecxept fo forgetting our paddles to the Portage lake! This appears to be a nice fishery with lots if water to explore."
