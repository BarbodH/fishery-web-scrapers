1208708,Skwire,2010-06-09 19:05:00,7,"PikepatrolWe flew in with Air Melancon twice back in the mid 90's!We flew into Sand Lake, good pike, laker and pickerel...ummmm, I mean walleye fishing! Also a back lake up a mountain for brookies.....we were never disappointed!The island camp we stayed at, at the time, was basic, but very comfortable and clean. Gary, now the owner with his wife, is an AME, and his aircraft are impeccable.We flew in the first year in their Turbo Otter, an amazing aircraft. The following year, we flew in with two of their Beavers.We had the pleasure of ""dropping"" into one of their camps on Lac Natakim a few years ago on a return flight from Lac Hebert to the Baskatong with Air Tamarac. We ran into low clouds and had to put down and wait it out for a few hours, and ended up at their camp at the south end of the lake.Very nice locatin, nice cabin, with solar lighting and running water!Ironically, our group we normally fish with was at their camp at the north end of the lake, although they didn't see us, except when we flew (real low) over their cabins looking for a place to put down! All in all. good outfitter, great service, nice cabins!"
1208710,ed08walleye,2010-06-09 19:21:00,27,SkwireHow did the group do/what did they think of Lac Natakim when they were there?
1208718,Skwire,2010-06-09 19:40:00,7,"EdThe guys enjoyed their trip. They caught enough walleye to eat, but nothing big! I remember them mentioning that there were a lot of rocks out and about on the lake! Having said that, they (we) like to try different places once in a while, and they have not been back since!That same group is currently up at Airdale's Little Missanabi camp as we speak! We were there 2 years ago, and we really enjoyed it and decided to go back.Due to family commitments, I couldn't attend this year!"

Excellent outfitters, impeccable cabins, very good fishing. The ONLY complaint any of our group ever had concerned the size of the walleye in Naticum. Tons of fish, great numbers of catch and release, but nothing very big for walleye, with some nice Nords. As I recall the biggest walleye for the week between 8 guys fishing was just 18"". But what a beautiful place! I recommend both the Outfiitter and that lake very highly. The only reason we stopped going there was the sharp increase in price due to the price of fuel. It's a little too expensive now for us....though we'd all like to return someday."
