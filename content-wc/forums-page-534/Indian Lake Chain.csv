The Indian Lake chain is a walleye factory, tons of eyes,all sorts of year classes, with a chancefor a big Canadian eye(6- 10lb) My wife got a 61/2lb. and is still rubbing it in!!! WHO was the GUIDE!!!! MEEEEE!!! Beautilful placeto go. Our hosts and camp owners Derek&Cassy Becker are truly a delight to be around and the camp is well maintained,cabins were spotless(all 12 of them, we snooped) coffee makers, microwaves, clean linens, towels, etc.We loved the place(and lake),so we booked for two more weeks in the fall and two weeks next spring, like I said we LOVED the place!!! PLUS this chain of lakes is loaded with Muskies as well,so if you get tired of fishing for eyes and Musky season is open, there's a great chance for a 40 in. Musky too!!! Just wanted to share some info on a sweet trip!!!!!! GOOD FISHING MY BROTHERS!!"
1208691,Bigfish10702,2010-06-09 18:22:00,60,"Which of the lakes do you fish? I have been going there (KC's Landing)for 4 years, we do pretty good on Indian. Biggest Muskie in our group last fall was 48"", we really have not gotten any big eyes, I think 22"" was the biggest ever."
1208702,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-09 18:47:00,241,"I'm a troller ( spring & fall) #5 shad raps and if you're deeper than 7-8 ft. youre to deep. we fished 5th& pines bay on indian lake, the wall, and Suds bay, and moose creek after Jun. 1st. Suds or moose creek or the opening to moose creek is FULL of down timber, we put the trolling motor down and trolled 5in. rapala shallow divers ( floaters) over the wood and KILLED the *******s,I have no need to fish to many other spots,Clarks will know where I'm talking about, or call Derek at Indian Lake Lodge,he's a great guy and would help you out. Hope this helps!"
1208753,Bigfish10702,2010-06-09 21:31:00,60,"Never fished Moose Creek by all those stumps, How can you troll without a snag????? It is a nightmare just getting to the creek. We go into Moose, and Little Moose and either do good, or get absolutely nothing."
1208776,Guest,2010-06-09 23:17:00,0,"Hey big fish we are at Indian Lake Lodge now and there was a guy got a 27"" & 23"" eye in less than an hour than the afternoon a boat goat another 24"" eye all were released too, which is great, what a day!"
1208878,Bigfish10702,2010-06-10 08:02:00,60,"We go in the fall, I have always wanted to give it a shot in the spring....maybe one of these years I will switch things up. I have no doubt that there are big walleyes about, we have just always encountered good numbers but no big ones. I would love to spend a whole week on Boulder Lake alone, it looks to have so much potential."
1208922,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-10 10:25:00,241,"We troll floating minnow baits over the top of that wood (rapalas, rebels, etc.) they only dive a foot or 18ins. so they go right over the top and those eyes are in that wood, you'll need to put your trolling motor down (electric) hope this helps!"
1208965,81Saluki,2010-06-10 13:08:00,97,I love the mouth to Moose Creek too and the points on either side â€¦ along with many other people! :-) I was there this morning and caught a bunch of eaters. Even had a 2-fer going for a minute (walleye on the hook and a muskie on the walleye). I had the entire lake to myself until about 8:15 when 2 boats joined me and spoiled my fun. Oh well. This chain is a great place to fish!!
1209152,JEREDOG,2010-06-11 00:05:00,21,this place is te real deal. love it. fishing is second to none!!! love fishin the rocky pionts with cranks for bass and walleyes!!!!!!
1209158,dcraven,2010-06-11 04:42:00,47,"I believe the ILC is a classic example of proof that large walleyes do ""other things"" when compared to regular-size walleyes. I've fished there since my childhood (the 70's) and my father since 1958. I've seen four legit fourteen lb walleyes taken out of the ILC and one fifteen lber. Interesting that in 1980 two of the fish were taken in the same week plus a 15 lber was in the baitshop in town that I witnessed weighed on a certified scale at 15 lbs out of Cedar Lake, just up north a bit.Anyway, the big fish I'm talking about were all caught by muskie anglers - proving to me that these big fish eat big baits. These fish were all caught in a suspended fashion - over open water - right out in the middle of the lake, as well. Obviously eating ciscos/tulibees as a primary forage. These fish were caught on large Jake/Grandma style baits and one on a large Lindy Shadling.I wish I was younger, kind of, and had the guts to fish there after dark (I'm not scared of the water, just the mosquitos), trolling large stickbaits just under he surface - that's how I think a guy could manage to catch a giant walleye or two. Gotta have time to do this, though - not much of a way to spend a week's vacation when you are up there for only a week or two. You guys that live up there should give it a try!"
