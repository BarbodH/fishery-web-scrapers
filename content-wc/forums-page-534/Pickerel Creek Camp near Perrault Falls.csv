We pass the Pickerel Creek dock frequently on our way up the creek to Pickerel Lake. While I can't advise you on the Camp, you will be in the heart of some great fishing. Five minutes downstream puts you on (small) Jackfish Lake for great walleye and perch fishing. Fifteen minutes upstream (depending on water levels) gets you to Pickerel Lake for very good walleye, smallmouth, and perch fishing, along with lots of northerns, some big but probably not trophy size. Gold Arrow has boats cached on Caribou Lake, one of our favorite off the road walleye lakes, but years ago we used to get there by running up to Pickerel, across the length of the lake, then 30+ minutes up another creek to Caribou. Don't know if the creek to Caribou is used much anymore, but if it's not too clogged w/ beaver dams it's a nice excursion from Pickerel Camp.If you are taking your own boat along, there are a dozen great lakes within easy access that I could suggest for walleye or lake trout fishing, including Cliff Lake 8 miles south with easy access for late trout and muskies. Incidentally, last week the guy fishing with me for lakers in Cliff caught a 25"" walleye.I'm not discouraging you from Pickerel Creek Camp and hope someone who's stayed there responds. But, check out Gold Arrow Camp, too. It's just a mile or so north on the highway. The Gold Arrow website is http://www.fishandhuntontario.com/You'll enjoy that part of NW Ontario. Lots of fishing options easily accessible. Feel free to PM me if I can provide more info."

1208556,trapper_john,2010-06-09 11:10:00,83,We are going to be staying at Kingfisher on Wabbie. Is there a launch on Pickerel or Jackfish? It sounds like a nice day trip..
1208586,JayM5209,2010-06-09 12:52:00,1050,"The only launch on Jackfish is at Gold Arrow Camp. I'm sure the new owners, Todd and Renee, would let you launch and park for a very nominal fee, at most. The only way to get to Pickerel Lake is up the creek from Jackfish or from Pickerel Creek Camp, which is on the creek - west side of Hwy. 105 right where the creek flows under the highway. I've never used the PC Camp launch, but they'd probably let you in there, too.The last stretch of the creek into Pickerel Lake gets shallow and there's some tight maneuvering around and between rocks. I always leave my 16' Lund Rebel at camp and use a 14' camp boat w/ 9.9 hp Merc to make the trip. I'm sure I remember seeing people with a wider 14'er or even a 16'er on Pickerel some years ago, but I absolutely wouldn't try it.Wabbie is a great lake with lots of area to explore. Have a great trip!"
