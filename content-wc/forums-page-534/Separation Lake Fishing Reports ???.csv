1203213,JoeWho14,2010-05-23 17:37:00,20,"I just talked to the manager of the lodge we go to (Ball Lake Lodge), which is east of Separation Lake on the English River and he said that the water levels are close to normal or just below normal. He's perdicting a good year for pike and the walleye fishing was OK but getting better daily!! JoeWho14"
1203465,rg,2010-05-24 10:49:00,9,"Joe, How is Ball Lake Lodge? We stopped in there a few years ago looked around when we were camping on the islands. I haven't been up there in 3 years because the camping just gets to be a pain in the a$$. Would like to start going back up there!!!"
1203542,ret-ro,2010-05-24 14:42:00,41,"Joewho, have you been going to ball very long?Sending you a pm."
1203730,JoeWho14,2010-05-25 06:58:00,20,"I've been going to Ball Lake Lodge ever since it opened, I'm guessing around 15 yrs or so, prior to that I went to Grassy Lodge. Now the Indians run both camps, Ball Lake is primarily an American Plan operation where Grassy is more Housekeeping. It's nothing fancy, the cabins are comfortable, the food is more than adequate, the guides are good and the fishing is excellent. They don't have a web site, but I do have a couple of brochures & rate sheets left from this year's All Canada Show that I could send you!"
1205526,PIKE PRO,2010-05-31 05:38:00,28,Leaving in 5 days really could use a report or two to get me started in the right direction. It's been 5 years since I've fished S.L. Plus I'll be bringing up 3 newcomers to canada. So any reports would help out alot. THANKS PIKE PRO
