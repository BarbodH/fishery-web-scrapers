4873537,1-shot,2016-05-26 14:47:00,35,"Hello, Wondering if anyone has any experience with fishing Esnagi LAke norht of WaWa. I will be there this June and will be staying at lodge 88. I have heard that the better fishing is in the north side of the lake but lodge 88 is on the south side. Do you's think its worth riding to the far north section of the lake or should I be able to find fishing areas nearer to my cabin location. We will mainly be targeting walleye. thanks 1-shot"
4873617,Bstar,2016-05-26 15:30:00,564,I have not been there myself but you can see a trip report from last July here http://www.canadafishingguide.net/th...-eighty-eight/ from Mike Borger. He's a regular WC contributor.
4874449,Seanik,2016-05-26 20:48:00,218,"Hi 1-ShotLooking forward to your report on Esnagi Lake, We will be there the week of July 9th. We booked on Mike Borger's advice and report. It seems Walleye can be caught in abundance near Lodge 88. We are going by train from Sudbury about 8hrs. Check out Mike's reports.Seanik"

4876609,10lbeye,2016-05-27 19:22:00,61,"Mike Borger wrote a great trip report on Esnagi and I'm sure can clue you in way more than I. I've fished there 3 times and it's a long haul from 88 to North End. Columbus Island and north end can get crowded at times and if there are 2-3 boats drifting around Columbus Island humps, it's tough to fish. There is a spot right in front of Mar Mac Lodge that can be terrific. There's a series of humps that change from about 8 to 25-30 ft. Years ago took the wife and my 2 kids (who were small) to Mar Mac and we drifted in front of camp while we watched numerous boats take off for parts unknown. we boated about 20 nice walleyes in the midst of all the departing traffic. nobody saw us catch the fish and I'm sure they thought we were clueless! It's worth a stop while en route north and returning south. Spot is best in a north or south wind, though. Long Bay near 88 sets up well in a west wind, and there are plentiful weed lines to probe. You'll love the camp and the lake."
4877937,ggershon1956,2016-05-28 18:54:00,1,I have fished the lake several timesOther bay north of marmac lodge and the island with the cabin right in front are good. That's where you will find those humps mentioned earlier.
4879217,Mike Borger,2016-05-29 13:05:00,1554,"Thanks for all the kind words guys. Yes I was at Esnagi Lake last August. For me at least it was more of a quality over quantity thing as far as the walleyes went, but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fishing.If the original poster or anyone else for that matter is looking for some insight on spots and tactics I'm happy to help.It's worth noting if I don't reply right away it's probably because I'm not around. My travel season has started and I'm constantly gone..."
4953889,1-shot,2016-06-28 07:26:00,35,"Returned last Thursday from a 4 day fishing trip to Esnagi lake. Had a great time. We had a bit of a scare a few days before leaving as the VIA rail train had threatened to go on strike. We later learned that the strike would not have affected our train but it was resolved prior to the strike anyways but was still a little stressful nonetheless. Now on to the trip: the accommodations and equipment were 1st class. The fishing was a little slow on the first day. It was very hot and calm (around 85 F) and we were told it had been that way the week prior. This made it challenging to activate the fish. By the second day, the weather had cooled down a bit and and a slight breeze had picked up. This seemed to trigger the fish to turn on and we did very well from then on. The largest walleye was 27.5 inches along with a number of fish between 22-25. We were not really targeting pike but caught a bunch of them as well with most falling in the 22-27 inch range. Caught most of the fish jigging a 1/4 oz gold or silver jig tipped with either a live minnow or some type of plastic. The live minnow out performed the plastic by about 2:1. Also trolled some husky jerks when the water was too rough to jig and did pretty well with them as well. The weather was very unpredictable. We had rain storms every day. It would go from completely calm and then a huge storm cloud would appear out of nowhere. This was a common occurrence during our trip. We really didn't venture far out from our lodge. Most of the fishing was done within a couple miles of the lodge. Overall, we had a great time and I would definitely recommend Lodge 88. Good luck all, 1-shot"
