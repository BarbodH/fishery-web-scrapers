I have never been there and he hasn't since the early 90s. We are staying at Knotty Pines on the English river system which is a brand new area to both of us. I'm just looking for an idea on what to bring up for tackle and what techniques are work the best this time of year. Any other tips would be greatly appreciated. We are planning on fishing walleye most of the time but have heard there is some good muskie fishing so will bring the muskie gear along too. I enjoy catching northerns also so if anyone has any knowledge of what types of lures normally work best for them up there that would help. Thanks!"

I like a med fast tip rod.. A far ss pike and musky goes white spinner baits, spoons and crank baits can work. Post a report when you get back!"
4894241,walleye/musky,2016-06-02 20:21:00,47,you jigs and minnow or leeches for walleyes use daredevil or any spoons small mepps for pike and then musky they are big there so heavy gear is needed
4894289,Carnhzkr,2016-06-02 20:37:00,964,"I'd guess that 80% of walleye fishermen in Canada are using the tried and true jig and a minnow. However, I've done a lot of river fishing and bottom bouncers and spinners with either minnows or crawlers is my go to presentation for river walleyes. You can fish the current much easier with bottom bouncers than with 1/4 or even 3/8 oz. jigs. Using a heavier presentation such as a bottom bouncer opens up a lot more fishable area. If there's much current at all, you'll have a difficult time feeling the bottom using jigs. That's my opinion. It would be a good idea to call the outfitter to see what he'd recommend."
4895097,Bakefish,2016-06-03 07:18:00,1077,"Pike - Minnow baits, Spinner Baits, Chatter Baits, Swim Baits, Doctor SpoonsWalleye - Orange/chartreuse jigs with minnow or chartreuse gulp minnowMusky - Big Minnow baits, bucktail spinners, SuickAll of my musky have come trolling for pike. You'll be more than delighted with the fishery. Go where the wind is blowing onto shorelines or bays. Don't be afraid to fish the shallows for walleye in those locations."
4931481,nwifisherman,2016-06-16 08:41:00,9,"Leaving for Canada tomorrow!!! I have been organizing tackle all week and have a few dozen jigs of every popular color in 1/8 and 1/4oz, tons of plastics, shadow raps, jigging raps, and crawler harnesses ready to go for the walleyes. Have some spinners and daredevil spoons for the northerns and bringing all the muskie rods and bucktails, jerkbaits, and topwaters to hopefully get into a big one! Anything I am missing or need to get on the way up? First trip and I am super excited to fish somewhere new! My worst fear is getting up there and wishing I had bought more of something."
4931633,muskyroller,2016-06-16 09:06:00,56,"Good luck with the shadow rap. I absolutely love that bait. It's such a great multi species lure. A little word of caution. Last year I ""donated"" two to pike due to bite offs and already two this year. So, I started using leader material that fly guys use for toothy critter fishing. It worked without killing the baits action. At first I tried small steel leaders, but they were brutal on the action they didn't allow the bait to swing. I tie a ""loop knot"" to the nose of the leader and then a loop knot to the end of the leader. That ""loop"" gets looped onto a small spro swivel/snap and I'm good to go. No bite offs on my homemade leader and I still catch bass, crappie, walleye, perch, and even the occasional sunfish on them (with the leader) and of course northerns."
4932897,UpNorthGuy,2016-06-16 16:32:00,53,"I'm a spinner rig kind of guy. I use mostly Little Joe spinners in bright colors. Lime Green or Bright yellow, Florescent red works good to. I also use 3/4 chain sinkers and use a bottom bounce presentation.. The brighter the color the better on all your lure's The river system and lakes are all dark water. (only exceptions being Clear Lake and Johnson). Johnson has been really good. Just inside the opening of the lake on the west side. Also try the river that's on he NW side of Johnson. Tell Norm Hi for me Paul"
4951129,nwifisherman,2016-06-26 16:14:00,9,"Best trip I have ever been on. Norm is one awesome dude and did everything to make our stay great. His brother Jeff showed us around when we arrived and we had our first 20"" walleye in less than 5 minutes. 100+ fish days and the quality was great. Biggest walleyes were just over 26"" and had 3 Northerns right at 35"". I would highly recommend Knotty Pines and look forward to going back next year!"
4952633,UpNorthGuy,2016-06-27 11:42:00,53,I'm glad you had a good time. The river/lake system in that area is can't miss type of fishing. Cain pole and a can of corn would work. How was the water level?
