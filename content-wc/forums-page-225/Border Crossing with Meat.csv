All will be cooked and frozen. Any suggestion on how to package and label to satisfy customs? I was concerned about the statement that says something about original packaging and place of origin."
4951561,Wisconeye,2016-06-26 21:37:00,79,I've never been asked about meat per se--last year poultry but not meat. I've regularly taken venison bacon and jerky to Canada and just label it like I do for my freezer which includes date of packaging and what's in it. I do all my own processing so it's not inspected except by the person who is gonna eat it---me.

Now least year there was the question of whether or not we had poultry and eggs to declare which I knew not to bring across the border. I too am considering smoking a pork shoulder at home and then freezing for the trip. Will be clearly labeled as to what it is. Doubt that the border guard will care."

4952553,bigwalleye1,2016-06-27 11:09:00,2632,"I agree. I've brought smoked pork shoulder, and ribs, and pork loin in, all cooked, and it's never been an issue, nor even asked about."
