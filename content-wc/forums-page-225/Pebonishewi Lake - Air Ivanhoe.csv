4957769,wallags,2016-06-30 04:13:00,10,Hello All. Going back with George this year at Air Ivanhoe but switching to Pebonishewi Lake. My buddies who are going on the trip with me used to fish Pebonishewi through Gogama years ago. George opened it up last year and I was wondering if anyone has had the chance to fish it under the new management. Thanks!!
