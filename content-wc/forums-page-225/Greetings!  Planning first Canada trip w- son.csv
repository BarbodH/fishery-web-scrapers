4762586,ukcats11,2016-04-22 10:44:00,12,"Hello, I got the ok to start planning a fishing trip for 2017 with my son. He will be almost 10 when we go. Seems like June is the month to go and we will shoot for that. He loves to fish and its usually me dragging him in to leave. I am interested in a drive in location as we will be driving from KY. Looks to be about a 16 hour trip to International falls were would get a hotel and then make the final drive to the lodge. A little background: We fish small farm ponds and neighborhood ponds for bass. We both have never caught a walleye/pike/musky etc nor fish for them. I have a few spinning rods i use for tubes etc that i will bring. Plan to pick up two more set ups for walleye as most of my gear is for bass and in the MH to H range. We also don't have a boat but i fish in some bass tournaments and have no problem navigating big water to find fish BUT..... For this first time i am looking at going to a smaller lake. since finding walleye will be different from bass i think for the first time a smaller lake will be perfect. Say around 4-8,000 acres or so. Even smaller is fine. We are more interested in numbers and catching multiple species. The last thing i want to do is have to make a huge run and get caught in a storm and i have zero experience using a tiller etc. I have searched here but most seems to point towards the bigger Lac Seul area. That would be too big for my taste unless the fishing is a short ride from the camps etc. Finally i thought i wanted an American plan but frankly i would hate to be at the mercy of the lodge for food. For breakfast we would only want cereal etc and can pack a lunch for fishing (hopefully a shore lune if we are lucky). I assume there would be groceries close by to pick up a few steaks etc for dinner. Plus this would help with the savings etc. I know i will have a lot more questions. Ive never used live bait other than to saltwater fish. But it seems like most lodges offer minnows to use. Also do you guys take any fish home back? Just looking to get a place booked first then will narrow down the details then. I was looking at Perrault Lake area but will entertain anything at this time Thanks, Mark"
4762650,LOW1,2016-04-22 11:02:00,2828,"Splendid! Lots of planning and choices ahead of you, but that's part of the fun. Involve Junior in the planning and he'll feel invested.This is probably where I would start: https://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/A guide would be a good thing to consider given your lack of experience, etc. Find one who will cook a shore lunch and it will be a great memory.If the cost is doable, an American Plan would be a hoot. I have never heard too many complaints about American plan food other than people ate too much. And if its just the two of you, not having to cook will make it more of a vacation for you.What lake? What resort? Lots of choices. Perhaps narrow it down to several that sound good to you and let us know and you will get more direct feedback.Can you really get to IFalls from Kentucky in 16 hours? Don't push too hard driving the first day or you will both be sorry and tired, especially if you are the only driver. An earlier motel stop, perhaps?"
4762674,camp chef,2016-04-22 11:05:00,915,Take a look at BigNorth lodge on the Winnipeg river. I think it would fit all your needs. They have a very informative website. If you decide to go there.....I would be happy to share all the info I have........We have fished out of Big North 5 or 6 times and have taken several young first timers there.
4762706,1/4 oz Jig,2016-04-22 11:15:00,90,"I would recommend Cedar Lake North of Vermillion Bay. Lake is 6500 acres and horseshoe shaped. Wind not really an issue because lake is mostly long and narrow. Also not many navigational hazards to worry about. Walleye fishing is good and can also fish for pike, smallmouth, musky or crappie. I've stayed at Clarks Northern Lights resort. Boats and accommodations are great plus the free minnows are a bonus!"
4762810,Stu,2016-04-22 11:38:00,472,"I have 2 quick suggestions: Holinshead Lake Resort http://www.holinshead.ca/ This is on the east side of Minnesota (north of Thunder Bay), so you'll cross at Grand Portage, MN. This is where I fish now and I probably won't go anywhere else. Holinshead is a relatively small lake (5000 acres). They only have walleye, northern and perch in the lake, but the fishing is phenomenal! You can expect to catch 100 fish per day, if you hit it hard. They are very restrictive though. You can only keep 2 walleyes and 2 northern per day and you cannot take any fish home. They fill up fast and it's difficult to get a reservation. They are also the only lodge on the lake, but they are 2 ½ hours from the nearest town, so you have to pick up all your groceries in Thunder Bay. Tall Pines Camp http://www.tallpinescamp.com/ Tall Pines is one of several resorts on Lake Wabaskang. It is actually a chain of 5 smaller lakes and there is good fishing near the lodge, so you don't have to travel very far (but there is lots to explore, if you want to). Dutchie's General Store is just a few miles down the road, so you can pick up anything you forgot. I took my son here in his 1 trip when we was 7 and we had a blast. You can catch all 5 species (walleye, northern, musky, perch and lake trout). I hope this helps, feel free to pm me if you need any more info. Good luck  Stu"
4762834,digjig,2016-04-22 11:43:00,146,"I was in the same boat (figuratively speaking) 7 years ago. I was looking for a Canadian drive in trip with 2 kids, wife and a smaller lake than the open seas of Lac Suel. We landed on Rainbow Point Lodge on Perrault Lake and have been going ever since. No American plan, but great owners, staff, fishing (walleye, pike, small mouth bass & perch). Nice equipment, nice camp with a store onsite and good people at the camp. A lot of repeat customers for many years. Dutchies (another store with beer) is about 1/4 mile away. Rainbow Point is about 4 hours from International Falls/Fort Frances. Ear Falls is about 1/2 hour north of camp. We will be there the last week in June."
4762922,yoopertrout,2016-04-22 12:11:00,1172,"If you decide to consider a fly-in, I'd recommend Kabeelo Outfitters. My wife and I went their two summers ago, and we are going back this year. They have a dozen or so lakes. The one that we stayed on was called was small - about 3 miles by a mile. They give you a map, and also have the people who are leaving as you arrive tell you where they did best. We specifically asked for a lake that is mostly walleyes, and we caught logs and nice ones (several over 26"") and a few northerns to 40"". The cabin is the only one on the lake. It's not American plan but all food is provided, except for a few things like cereal and snack. We found their operation to be very finely tuned. We'd previously fished a drive in lodge on a bigger lake, where we didn't do so well, and got tired of boating for miles every day. It's nice to be back at camp in ten minutes if you forget something. We're mostly catch and release fishermen at home, but the camp staff told us the lake is far from overfished, so we had some wonderful meals there, but decided not to mess with bringing fish home. Also, they have flush toilets and showers. I think picking a little bit smaller lake has some advantages. Good luck wherever you go!"
4957809,prov1800,2016-06-30 05:09:00,5010,1/4 oz mentioned cedar lake.that would be a great choice for a lake.clarkescnkrthern lights runs a great place.if yourclooking for a evening meal plan then i would suggest lookinv at cedar point resort as they offer a flecible AP plan.they arecalso in the middlecof the lake and close to better fishing in june.
4773258,John N,2016-04-25 19:39:00,362,"We've long ago become familiar with the lake. The guide we began with fished with us for many years, and it's become much more a matter of friendships than need. That said, the lake is about 190 square miles, and we often run 50-60 miles or so on any given day (more options). The guide's familiarity with present conditions is always useful, and we'll often travel to spots we haven't been before in the several major regions of the lake. We've found it very enjoyable to have the day's fishing hosted and shore lunch prepared by a good guide. John"
4773290,bassnblast,2016-04-25 19:45:00,56,"As a fellow southern bass fisherman who is still relatively new to fishing in Canada (about 10-15 years), I would recommend a lodge on Lake of the Woods with guides -- there are lots of good ones. The lake is amazing and something is always biting -- pike, muskie, walleye, crappie, bass (smallies and largemouth). I guarantee your son will get the Canada 'bug' and it will allow you to figure out some things about walleye fishing and perhaps your next trip could be on your own... Just my two cents. I just hate to think of you going all the way up there and struggling on the fishing -- there can be a pretty steep learning curve!"
4773306,John N,2016-04-25 19:47:00,362,"If on the arrangement where the camp provides meals, the guide is $250/day. While not chump change, divided among the group it's not too bad. And we've all enjoyed having the camp prepare meals (they've really been great), but as you say, to each his own. Pretty hard to have a bad time fishing with friends. John"
4774106,Bobby Winds,2016-04-26 05:42:00,10817,Don't stop planning a June trip if that is best for you. The only problem is bass season is closed and you can't keep any........SO WHAT ! ! ! You will still catch plenty of bass and NP along with your walleyes while walleye fishing.And DON'T plan on musky fishing with a ten year old.......a incidental catch would be great but fishing all day for a hope of catching one fish is a sure way to turn a kid off fishing.......BTW you and him will probably catch plenty of NP for excitement.

4781882,emma17,2016-04-28 09:04:00,436,"UKcats Congrats on winning approval to make the trip next year. I started taking my sons around the same age, thankfully they love it and it's an annual must do for us. There are lots of Great camps and lakes to pick from. As you son will be 10, look for camps that offer father/son packages or discounts for children. The camp owners I've dealt with have all offered kid plans. As for the American Plan or not, my personal preference is absolutely. I've never felt confined to a meal time and they pack a lunch for you if you want to stay out all day. I personally don't get great enjoyment out of cooking. I get great enjoyment from going right from bed or right from the boat to the Lodge dining room. Not only do you get more one on one time w your son/family to talk, you get great interaction with the other people in camp while breaking bread. I have learned a lot at the dining table over the years, and my sons have great memories of people they have met. It's all about preference though. As for big lakes. Keep in mind that you can find many quiet and small areas within a big lake. You don't have to cruise the big open water if you don't want."
4957705,LacSeulSam,2016-06-29 23:22:00,9,"Hi Mark, My wife and I have just opened a camp located on Lost Lake, a smaller part of Lac Seul. It is a housekeeping plan, with boat rental available and use of kayaks and paddle board. We are small and would welcome the opportunity to introduce you and your son to our beautiful lake. We are located on the Lac Seul First Nation across from the small town of Hudson. If you would like more information I would be more than happy to send you an e-mail. As I said, we are new, we are small, but big on detail."
4766042,ukcats11,2016-04-23 17:07:00,12,Anyone rig a rod just for musky? Any lakes better than the other for musky?
4766178,ftfarms,2016-04-23 18:41:00,444,I do. Musky lakes I like lake of the woods eagle lake. Cedar lake and cliff lake. I saw you are going to move your week back to July I think that's good. I've fished over 40 weeks in ontario in my life and I've had as many 100 plus walleye days in late july-mid august as I've had in late may-last of June. The weathers usually better in July and August also.
4766290,pale ryder,2016-04-23 19:25:00,1937,"""A"" rod just for muskies, no. I rig up 3 or more musky rods. 2 at a minimum. Cedar, Eagle, and LOTW have huge muskies. The Indian chain has a lot of muskies and some big ones."
4766370,3M TA3,2016-04-23 20:19:00,2846,"No doubt Musky fishing is a spectacular sport although I would be concerned for the 10 year old for two reasons. The first is the cost vs benefits. A lot of time may be invested in search of the quarry with no reward. It takes a lot of effort to catch one and overall they are pretty rare. I'm thinking boredom could set in and discourage the boys excitement. Two, if he does catch one, you may need special equipment to keep him in the boat. Imagine that. And just imagine his fish story if he catches one (WooHoo). Perhaps that one benefit outweighs everything else. However I think catching an incidental Musky would be spectacular but targeting them would just be too costly. A bored kid isn't having fun."
4766490,Walleye will,2016-04-23 21:17:00,218,Check out black bear lodge. It's a American plan but it worth it. <700 per adult includes everything but bait. ( awesome portage lakes). www.fishblackbear.com

4772770,yoopertrout,2016-04-25 17:00:00,1172,"The other person's point on muskies are smart. They can requires hours with no action, throwing big lures, backlashes etc. On the other hand, you'll be in country were there are lots of other big toothy fish - northern pike - that are much easier to catch and really exciting, especially for a child your son's age."
4773034,rnnonmt,2016-04-25 18:33:00,992,What is a backlash? Never tried one of those before. Are they any good for Musky?Is that a new lure that PJshorthorn or Jimi came up with?
4764378,pale ryder,2016-04-22 20:57:00,1937,"X2 I highly recommend Clark's on Cedar Lake. I also recommend Clark's Camp on the Indian chain. Both lakes are small enough to be easy to fish and navigate, but large enough to offer many fishing options."
4764418,1/4 oz Jig,2016-04-22 21:24:00,90,"I saw someone mention it earlier but no matter what lake or resort you choose I would strongly consider getting a guide. They will put you on fish and really shorten the learning curve of the lake (depth, colors, structure). Also most guides won't mind marking more spots on a map for you to check out. I find myself to be a pretty good walleye fisherman but I still hire a guide the first time I go to a new lake."
4764474,roscoe33,2016-04-22 23:23:00,653,"Early June will be more walleyes. Later June or early July seems to be when the northern and smallmouth pick up. But also the bugs. So if you want multi species, consider going at the end of June into July."
4764570,pjshorthorn,2016-04-23 03:47:00,5654,"The cost of a fishing license never entered my mind. A first trip with my son was never about how much things cost,how many fish were caught or whether we got a big fish. The trip was about he and I spending a full 10 days together,having him experience seeing a moose,bear,wolf ,eagle and lynx for the first time, him feeling like he was part of a big family tradition, watching him having fun with his grandfather, listening to his questions and knowing that he was absorbing the whole experience, watching his face as his uncles trolled past us with a 30"" Rapala being pulled behind them and everyone in the group making a really big deal about him being on the trip. That first trip was all about him. I now have the distinct pleasure of a 21 year old man wanting to go fishing with his dad, grandfather,family and friends every opportunity we get. I do know this, there is only one ""first trip"" with a child, and a dollar amount can't be placed on that experience. PjShorthorn"
4764578,pjshorthorn,2016-04-23 04:03:00,5654,"Ukcats, You may want to look at the Ontario Master Angler program as part of your trip research. The program helps recognize anglers who catch a qualifying size fish of many different species. I sent in the info on each qualifying fish that my son caught and he would receive a certificate and patch from the organization. It was a neat way to celebrate his success on bigger fish caught and released. The program is free and everyone that has caught fish in Canada can register their catches.Enjoy the process you are embarking upon with your son. I'd be glad to offer thoughts on our trip planning so send me a PM at any time.PjShorthorn."

Others have brought their sons along as well over the years. Great fun, memories of a lifetime. We've gone to www.oldpost.com every year. Always use their guides, camp prepares breakfast and dinner, guide makes shore lunch every day. Pretty cushy camp, been wonderful every year. Northern and walleye fishing has been excellent every year. We typically go at the end of July. Wherever you go, what a great experience to share with your son! John"
4763074,ukcats11,2016-04-22 12:55:00,12,Wow! Thanks guys. That was quick I will investigate all links provided. What does Canada consider a possession? Like am I allowed 4 walleye per the whole trip or is that 4 a day with the appropriate license?
4763298,Bigredmf,2016-04-22 14:05:00,129,4 in your possession per license total.For your example 2 anglers = 8 fish once you eat them you can then get more. I have been in a line just prior to the border where they inspect all of your coolers to confirm your possession numbers. The agents picked through each package and inspected each fillet.Depending on where you go know and understand the regulations. This can be region dependent where in certain portions of a province based on your license you may need to leave the full skin and tail intact or just a portion of the skin so they may id the species and length. Red
4763330,forgop,2016-04-22 14:19:00,880,"Because you have to buy a full price license and Ontario outdoors card for kids, I find it cost prohibitive to get them a license as they're free with an adult carrying them. When I took my daughters last year, I was the only one with a license, I didn't get them one as 4 in possession was enough."
4763354,LOW1,2016-04-22 14:30:00,2828,"Some of the area you are considering may fall under what are called Border Waters and in these areas as an American your walleye daily catch and possession amounts would be 2 and 2.Here is a link to the 2016 regs. https://www.ontario.ca/document/onta...ations-summary I am sure that there will be changes prior to 2017. As you can see, Ontario is big on dividing itself up into numerous zones for regulation purposes."
4763386,ukcats11,2016-04-22 14:37:00,12,If I wanted to bring 8 walleyes home I could get my son the license correct? I know he can fish under mine but that would limit us to 4 fish.
4763394,ftfarms,2016-04-22 14:45:00,444,In some lakes yes but not all. I'm going to also say small lake I would see if I could get in at cedar point resort on cedar lake peuruallt falls ontario. The location is the best on the lake.
4763866,pjshorthorn,2016-04-22 17:33:00,5654,"That is correct. When you purchase a license for your son,he is allowed to keep his limit as well. My son took his first trip with me when he was 10 and it was a big deal for him to have his own license and get to keep his own fish. After his 1st 4 trips, I framed each of his licenses with a favorite photo from each year. It has been hanging in his bedroom ever since and I have all of his other licenses for future presents as well. The first trip with my son was the best ever in all my years, bar none..... You will have a great time with him. On a calm day, teach him how to run the boat a little bit,with you at his side, at a slow pace. Some of my best memories were doing just that.....he had a big smile the entire time. Best of luck and as already mentioned, make your son a big part of the planning process. He will get the bug for many years to come. PjShorthorn."

4764162,rnnonmt,2016-04-22 20:04:00,992,"ukcats11 - A lot of good information for you in the WC posts.... and a lot of good folks too. I can remember taking my son for the first time when he was 10 to Lac Seul. I also remember my dad taking me for the first time when I was around the same age. Priceless memories. Absolutely get your son involved with the decision making before and during your trip. He will feel empowered and invested. You can not go wrong on Lac Seul. It is a big body of water but you don't have to go far. I also recommend a guide to help ease some animosity you may have on a bigger body of water. Plenty of choices on Lac Seul for cabins and plans. Most places offer guide services as well. With a guide you will save time.... and I am certain your arms will get tired of catching fish and even have a great chance for a 30 inch walleye or a 40""+ Pike. Your MH & H rods will be fine for Pike but may want something a bit lighter for walleye. You will find it extremely easy to catch fish - period! Good luck and I wish you a great trip with your son."
4764170,rnnonmt,2016-04-22 20:06:00,992,My answer - Absolutely!!
4762930,MikeinMN,2016-04-22 12:11:00,190,"I think you are on the right track with your choice of lake size and location. The English River might be an option in that area also. This site has alot of info about fishing in that general area if you use the search feature for a specific lake. Organization is the key to a good shore lunch, Youtube has some good videos to help. Also, some resorts provide a shore lunch kit. Shore lunch does take a little extra time but is well worth it. Fort Francis and Dryden are you last two ""big"" towns on the way for shopping, and Ear Falls also has pretty much any groceries or other stuff you might need. Dutchies in Perrault Falls has any small items you might have forgotten. Take your heavy bass gear and spinnerbaits for pike. That time of year fish pike like bass and you will do ok. Youtube how to fillet a pike, they are a little different to clean but are very tasty. Jig and minnow is the most popular walleye bait, but slip bobbers with leeches or minnows work well too. Trolling shorelines with shad raps and husky jerks should get a mixed bag in June. Take warmer clothes than you think you will need. Take rain gear also. Probably TMI already, but PM me if you want.
