4957273,Larry S,2016-06-29 18:21:00,665,"Wisconeye, Does MLO have minnows which you can buy at Ogoki or do you have to buy/bring minnows up yourself. If MLO has minnows wondering what is the cost per doz?"
4957529,BrianE,2016-06-29 20:44:00,98,"Larry, Yes they do have minnows. You may want to send an email to Don & Annette a few days before your trip, they can answer all your questions. Their supply depends on customer demand at any given time."
4957545,BrianE,2016-06-29 20:48:00,98,Just for safety sake it's probably easier on the minnows if you get them just before your flight to the lake but just my opinion.
4957553,Wisconeye,2016-06-29 21:01:00,79,"Yes, they have minnows. I emailed them about 10 days ahead of our fly in date and asked to have 25 Dozen ready to fly in with us. When we got there we had 5 bags of 5 Doz ready to go with Oxygen. When we get to the lake the first thing is to put them in a five gallon bucket with holes top and around the sides---they have a few, put the lid on and sink the bucket---keeps great for about 4 days. Just FYI---I plan on 10-15 dozen per fisherman per week provided they will be fishing spoons/cranks/gulp etc. for some bit of the time. Straight up--minnow and jig only guys can easily use 25 doz a week. It seems like there is a plane into Ogoki nearly everyday but if you think you will need more just tell Ted at the camp and he will see that some arrive either the next day or two at the most usually The price in June was 5.00 CAD per dozen---I tell all of our new guys to plan on spending 100 on bait. Personally I don't spend that cause i chase pike and use a lot of gulp and twisters----but minnows definitely produce--always."
4957665,Larry S,2016-06-29 22:41:00,665,"Wisconeye Thanks for your response. Not going fishing this year due to family & work circumstances. May go next year with my sister & friends to an MLO outpost. I have fished all over Ontario and out of Armstrong a number of times with Northern Outposts . I see you live southwest of Stevens Point where my sister is from Glad you had a great trip to Ogoki, I'm definitely all ready missing Canada Take Care Larry S"
4949929,Wisconeye,2016-06-26 09:17:00,79,"Just returned (June 25, 2016) from a week on Ogoki Reservoir via Mattice Lake Outfitters. Before the fishing report I just have to say that after many trips here with MLO they absolutely never fail to make each trip fantastic. From initial booking until we drive out of their driveway they are great. A special thanks to Ted at Ogoki for all of his efforts, he is just an all around great guy. We arrived mid-day Saturday to high sun and 80+ temperatures with a slight breeze. Unpacked, set up the boats and took our two newbies to Eight Flume Falls for their first fish (5 minutes), caught a bunch and toured up and around to the upper falls for some more great walleye action. We really found that minnows made a difference this year and normally for new guys I always get some as they are sure to work. My son and I used a few minnows but after constant minnow dipping switched to Gulp Alive both the 2"" and 4"" minnows and while it didn't work equally as well is was close enough. Twister tails struggled but fish could be had on them. Sunday through Tuesday we had very unsettled weather--some high sun, some glass water, some wind, some rain, a bit of lightning and thunder ---it seemed like we had it all but the rain and wind was never enough to keep you from getting out and the rains were of the shower variety---ten minutes then quit and a half hour later it would do it again. This unsettled weather seemed to really throw the large pike off and scatter them. We couldn't top a 38"" this year like we usually do but plenty of 25-27"" fish for eating pike. Years ago we used to catch a lot of 22-24"" inch walleyes here, then size kind of shrunk but this year it really was great. I don't think we boated more than a dozen walleyes under 15"" with the average going 17-18"" and lots of 22"" inch fish. Caught walleyes anywhere you wanted. They were particularly aggressive with their favorite non-jig bait being a 1/2 oz. green w/gold back Mepps Cyclops. I caught dozens on the Cyclops and finally took off the treble hook and put on a 3/0 single Aberdeen hook for easier releases. The occasional small pike would inhale this as well. I make my own Muskie inline spinners and threw them here and there for pike and caught good ones, but again the walleyes would take this too! We travelled to Moose Crossing one day and as usual boated a ton of fish, but for the first time I have to say the average size was better closer to camp. However, living up to it's name we did experience a bull moose swim within 10 yards of our boat. We watched him on shore until he finally decided to cross and he swam right at our boats and it seemed like he was coming to us and passed really close. Throw in watching a bull Woodland Caribou closer to camp and a Black Bear and two cubs and it was really cool. Wrapping up it was the hardest year for larger pike ever but that seems to be a result of weather. Probably a mix of the unsettled weather and the heat. I think they are about to transition to deeper water and may have already but we couldn't even get them there. Word was a 40 and 41 inch were caught by another group but we simply couldn't get it done. The last day was still, and HOT with a heavy storm front approaching and we were glad we got out when we did. It's the one risk you take with a fly-in, the weather can keep you from getting in and from getting out and with your gear and food all packed away, it's a boring wait for the plane, but still better than sitting in an airport. Key places: Both falls, Scorpion Point at dusk, Moose Crossing, the left hand creek outlet at the mouth of two mile, the honey hole, and wall behind scorpion point. Strike Outs- One mile bay, 2nd and 3rd bay---water too low for constant action based on what we have previously experienced. Great Trip."
4951201,BrianE,2016-06-26 17:14:00,98,"Thanks for the report Wisconeye appreciate it and glad you guys did well. The Ogoki is on our future list, been to Mojikit which is very good but its a little bit of a haul there from the MLO Mojikit camp. Just never enough time on these trips ....the fishing there is never disappointing."
4951225,smithcr1981,2016-06-26 17:44:00,42,im headed there in september and staying at short lake.. are these spots labled the same as what you call them on the lake maps.
4951457,BrianE,2016-06-26 20:14:00,98,The maps that Don has and gives to his clients yes they are the same.
4951553,Wisconeye,2016-06-26 21:33:00,79,"They are pretty much the same, but with the exception of Moose Crossing it will be a long trip by boat. It's 14 miles from Moose Crossing up to the Ogoki Reservoir Mini-Camp. In September I would expect Short to be much the same as the reservoir with typical aggressive northern pike action and walleyes putting on a feed bag as well. I've not been to Short Lake but down towards Moose Crossing be sure to take plenty of jigs---the reservoir was flooded timber years ago and it is snaggy to say the least. Standard jig set ups for me include fireline or power pro in 14 pound test so I can just bend the wire hook when pulling the jigs out-- bend them back, touch em up a bit with a sharpener and back to fishing."
4951953,Stauff,2016-06-27 07:13:00,110,Thanks for the report. Our group heads up next week. How was the mosquito situation??
4952721,smithcr1981,2016-06-27 12:09:00,42,Thanks for the reply. I appreciate the information. I will definitely take a lot of jigs. Will definitely also ask the folks at Mattice Lake for their recommendations but wondering what you find works best either leeches or minnows?
4953401,Wisconeye,2016-06-27 20:42:00,79,"Mosquitos and 'no-see-ums' were typical for this time of year--in other words healthy and mean. You do learn to tolerate them to some extent, the no-see-ums are the worst because the darn bites seem to hang on longer--at lest you can swat a mosquito! Several years ago we started taking a large can of LD44 Dairy Fly Spray along and the first guy to the outhouse in the morning has the responsibility of spraying that down and the last guy out of the cabin in the morning gives a shot or two into the cabin and those two things really help! You can get this aerosol at about any farm supply store---kills spiders, flies and mosquitoes really well. As for the question about minnows or leeches---I'd say earlier in the year minnows are my favorite but the leeches seem to get better later. Ogoki has a bumper crop of leeches this year and if you put a bucket with a few dead minnows and rock off the dock so it sinks you'll raise it in a day and have a pretty good crop---caution, they will also invade a sunk bucket with live minnows and you'll lose some minnows to the darn things. We always take about 20 doz minnows in with us and use a five gallon bucket with a lid and lots small holes and sink it---make sure the bucket is clean with absolutely no rough edges inside and no plastic drilling remnants which will kill all your minnows. Also don't allow the bucket to float, the sloshing around will also beat the minnows to death. Sorry about the long answers."
4953409,Wisconeye,2016-06-27 20:45:00,79,Sorry I didn't see you were going in September until after the previous post----September would have me definitely taking some crawlers along as well--I've found them to work really well in the fall but not worth taking in the spring usually.
4957241,smithcr1981,2016-06-29 18:02:00,42,thanks for the info. i cant hardly wait
