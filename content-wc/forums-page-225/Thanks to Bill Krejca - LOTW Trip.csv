Frank and I really enjoyed our adventure. I believe it had been at least 10 years since he had made the journey to that part of the lake. I think Frank has made close to 60 trips to LOTW so I was blessed in many different ways on my first trip there. I'll email you the pictures so you can enjoy them on a larger scale. I bet your Dad was watching over us a little bit as we didn't run into any skunks or porcupines ðŸ˜€ Take care, PjShorthorn."
4955473,jimirjr,2016-06-28 18:20:00,1149,"BWAHAHAHA!!! We've done the ""circle route"" ourselves a couple times.... lol! Once, as we passed a small Red Cabin on an island point for the THIRD time.... At least a nice Guy standing on that dock asked Us if We were lost... The proceeded to direct Us the right direction... Now, with GPS, well..... some of the adventure is missing..."
4957609,birddogger,2016-06-29 21:55:00,43,Nice job PJ. What an honor to Bill K. and his father. I'm going up in Sept and will have to make it over to that part of the lake from Morson.
4957673,pjshorthorn,2016-06-29 22:52:00,5654,"Thank you sir. If you do happen to make it to Turtle Lake, I would sure appreciate a report on how the sign is holding up PjShorthorn."
4954025,pjshorthorn,2016-06-28 08:03:00,5654,"Howdy Bill, I just got back from my first adventure to the Sabaskong Bay area on Lake of The Woods. What a beautiful lake system. I'm hopeful to take many more trips there in the future. I'm a ""trip planner"" kinda guy and in preparation for our adventure to LOTW, I bought a map of the area and read your book chronicling you and your father's adventures. As I mentioned in emails to you prior to our trip, by reading the book I was able to follow your father's adventures via the map. I can only say that it was quite amazing as to what he and his friends accomplished on those early trips some 80 years ago now. In appreciation of your willingness to help a rookie with fishing spot suggestions, I decided to make a sign ( I call it my ""Little Rascals"" sign as she isn't fancy ) that would somewhat memorialize your father and all of his trips to the same general area that I would be fishing. As I thought about a place for the sign, that would capture the essence of his trips, Turtle Lake and Turtle Portage kept coming to mind many times over. The stories in your book drew me to this place in my mind without ever having been there. Breezy and I made a trip to Turtle Lake on Father's Day , fishing our way there, with the intent of finding a suitable place for the sign. When we arrived, I immediately understood how your father would have missed the entrance to Turtle Lake when approaching from the east. As we trolled through the entrance we found a group of trees on the right side about a 100 yds from the point that were just right for the sign. We went into Turtle Lake to fish your Muskie spot ( that reef was right where you said.......where the weed bed ended ), look at Turtle Portage as it exists today and get a glimpse of the camp area next to the portage where you and your parents camped so many years ago. In my mind's eye, as we trolled past the camp, I could see you father there and why he found it to be a special place. Attached are some pictures that we took on our own little adventure to Turtle Lake. Sorry for the quality of the picture that shows the point.....the sign is a white dot,but I hope it will give you a perspective on where it was hung. I'll have to send multiple posts due to the picture file size. Breezy and his daughter will be going back up for another trip in a couple of weeks and he plans on taking her to see the sign and do a little more maintenance on making sure it stays in place for quite some time. I'm hopeful that anyone who reads this and fishes the Sabaskong Bay area will report on the sign condition if one were to make it to the Turtle Lake entrance. Thanks again Bill. Your help made my first trip to LOTW a very memorable experience I won't soon forget. PjShorthorn."

4954137,1700SS,2016-06-28 08:43:00,104,Nice job pj and Breezy!! I will check it out next week while I am there. How was the fishing?
4954601,jimirjr,2016-06-28 11:50:00,1149,"Heck Pat... We are usually a bit North of Sabaskong when We travel to LOW.. More Northwest of Whitefish Bay, Nearer to Yellow Girl bay.. WAY to much water to cover in a LIFETIME !! let alone a 9 day HB trip.. Glad You Guys had fun !! Oh Yeah, BILL K.... My Wife is from Chas City Ia......."
4954873,pjshorthorn,2016-06-28 13:18:00,5654,"Fishing was a little tough in terms of numbers. We were blessed with a large cold front and high winds for a couple of days, but we caught some nice solid fish. I have to get on the stick and get the trip report out with the fishy details. PjShorthorn."
4954945,Pikeslayer8,2016-06-28 13:25:00,1460,So very well done fellas.... just an awesome tribute.... a well deserved memorial.... and a new LOW attraction. I'm guessin one of you guys used to work for Wall Drug.
4954993,pjshorthorn,2016-06-28 13:44:00,5654,"Jimi, I knew you weren't piloting any of those HBs we saw last week. They weren't spinning in circles PjShorthorn"
4955313,Bill Krejca,2016-06-28 16:14:00,6107,"Wow, thanks, bud, the surprising posting of the sign literally chokes me up! Dad would have beamed at the act of being honored in such a thoughtful way. I am at a loss for words, and will honestly be forever grateful! Bill"
4955393,wallydave,2016-06-28 17:16:00,2151,"Pat and Frank, nice job by a couple of stand up guys! I'm sure Frank will be able to keep an eye on the sign. Well done guys!"
