4956465,BrianinVA,2016-06-29 10:42:00,160,"That was my initial thought as well, but it seems ""Sport Fishing License"" and ""Sportsman's License"" are one and the same. From page 3:Remember that most catch and possession limits and some size limits are different for a holder of a Sport Fishing Licence than for a holder of a Conservation Fishing Licence.• S - refers to limits under a Sport Fishing Licence Tag.For example: S – 4 = catch and possession limit of four.• C - refers to limits under a Conservation Fishing Licence Tag.For example: C – 2 = catch and possession limit of two."
4957049,Bass Lake,2016-06-29 15:47:00,20,Thanks!. Heading up to Auger via Mattice Outfitters in about 3 weeks. Getting pumped for it!
4957113,BreezyPoint,2016-06-29 16:34:00,1581,I should note that you can only get the three year license only at the time your outdoors card is renewed.Frank
4957457,v-bay gord,2016-06-29 20:06:00,3168,I checked with someone in the MNR and my initial assumption was correct. A conservation license with an adult covers a younger person without a license.
4958233,BrianinVA,2016-06-30 08:06:00,160,"Taking into consideration the rigidity of with which many of these regs are enforced, and with all due respect for your MNR contact, it would be wise to follow what is printed versus what has been verbally or informally conveyed. There was a very deliberate change in verbiage from 2015 to 2016 and ""Sport Fishing Licence"" clearly indicates a specific fishing licence that is not a Conservation License. If the intent is to allow non-residents under 18s to fish with an adult with a Sport Fishing or Conservation license the reg booklet need to be corrected and reverted back to the 2015 language. 2016: Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Sport Fishing Licence. Any fish kept are part of the catch and possession limit of the person who holds the licence. As another option, non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may purchase an Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag to have their own limits2015: Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Outdoors Card and fishing licence tag.

4958313,BrianinVA,2016-06-30 08:37:00,160,"13. A non-Canadian resident who is under 18 years of age and who is fishing with the holder of a sport fishing licence shall be deemed to hold a sport fishing licence but one limited to fishing under the authority of the licence holder. O. Reg. 281/08, s. 1. (link)Just to finally lay this to rest, your MNR contact seems to be correct and the 2016 regulation fishing book appears to have an error. The above is the official reg which states the adult must have a ""sport fishing license"" and not a ""Sport Fishing License"". Looks like this one got past the lawyers."
4929089,lawson2343,2016-06-15 08:23:00,459,"So a popular discussion in our fishing group has been what size range are the best reproducers. When we got checked by the CO last year we asked him. His answer was the 18-24"" fish are the best. I think I then found something online to corroborate that. So we try to not keep those anymore. One 25"" that we caught in our boat last week still had eggs! They were almost white, so we really wondered if she was no longer producing fertile eggs. We released her. I'm no walleye biologist, but I believe she should have spawned long ago."
4955825,Bass Lake,2016-06-28 22:48:00,20,"So, we need the outdoor card, in addition to license?"
4955905,Bstar,2016-06-29 05:05:00,564,You cannot purchase a license without the outdoor card. The online site will walk you through it.
4956033,BreezyPoint,2016-06-29 06:36:00,1581,"If you go up every year, the best deal is the three year license. If you get the three year license, the license info is printed on the back of the outdoors card, so no need for a paper copy if you're ur card arrives in time.Frank"
4956113,lawson2343,2016-06-29 07:22:00,459,I bought my license online for $85.53 Canadian. Just got the credit card bill and the cost US was 65.58. I doubt I would have got that good of a rate at a point of sale.
4956153,BrianinVA,2016-06-29 07:55:00,160,"I have a hard time believing this would be strictly enforced, but a Conservation license would not technically cover a non-resident fisherman under 18. From the 2016 Ontario fishing regulation book: ""Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Sport Fishing Licence."""
4956201,Pooch,2016-06-29 08:08:00,4619,"Make sure you understand limits inside and out. Daily limits include what fish you had for lunch that day. I would get a conservation license for everyone in the party, including underage family. I think that allows them to have a daily limit. Otherwise fish they catch and save are counted on YOUR daily limit.Make sure you really, really understand these regulations as there are a lot of people on this forum who have been burnt because of misunderstandings.Do your homework and make it a great trip and not come home pizzed off over a fine.Ditto doing it online, but time is running out as your trip approaches.Pooch"
4956233,LOW1,2016-06-29 08:21:00,2828,"I just buy the sport license because the money goes to a good cause. Especially with the exchange rate the way it is, no reason to get chintzy."
4956281,pjshorthorn,2016-06-29 09:04:00,5654,"Pooch is correct on the above aspects. If a child fishes under your license their catch counts towards your possession limit. If you buy a child their own license, the child can keep their own possession limit. I started buying my son his own license when he was 10. It wasn't to keep more fish as much as it was to make him feel like he was a true member of a Canadian fishing trip with his grandfather and uncles. It did make him feel important to know that he could keep his own fish if he wanted to. For myself, it was worth the price of admission to watch him catch fish under his own license while learning the importance of following the regulations. My son and I are leaving in 4 weeks for another great adventure to Canada. What he doesn't know yet is that since he has now turned 21, he has to buy his own license. Online licenses are very easy. I laminated one copy for the boat and have extra paper copies in case somehow one gets lost along the way. Be sure to keep your license the entire time you are traveling home so there are no questions in case you are stopped at a fish check station. Also make sure that fish being transported home match the allowable possession limits for the passengers in each vehicle. Have a great time on your adventure !!! You will have many memories. PjShorthorn"
4956425,v-bay gord,2016-06-29 10:31:00,3168,"Correct me if I'm wrong but the Sport Fishing License they refer to is not the same as a ""Sportsman's license""......it is just a generic term for having a valid fishing license. So as long as the adult has a valid license (Sportsman's or Conservation) a younger person can fish with you. To the person wondering about musky fishing on a conservation license, that is fine. It is done all the time. The limit is zero but you can still legally catch and release. Even if you had a Sportsman's license, bringing back a musky to camp would probably result in you being ""drawn and quartered"" by most lodge owners around here."
4925081,okiesprayguy,2016-06-13 22:12:00,12,"Less than 3 weeks til we head to lumberjack lodge on Sturgeon. Which license do most of you buy? Sportsman or conservation? There will be 4 adults and 2 kids. We will probably eat fish daily. Hopefully several shore lunches. Any favorite recipes? We wouldn't mind bringing a limit home. 1st trip to Canada, so lots of questions. Also do most wait and get sportsman's card and license there or purchase online before you go?"
4925249,kzoofisher,2016-06-14 04:04:00,5144,Will conservation licenses feed you and the kids? Will they save you any money aside from the initial purchase? If the answer to either of these is no I would get the sport. If the answer to both is yes I would get the conservation. The lodge I go to knocks $35 off the stay with the C lic. so between me and my son this year the saving will amount to over $100 for both licenses and our stay. Two walleye each is plenty to feed us. Easy decision.
4925457,Bill Krejca,2016-06-14 06:22:00,6107,"Re: On line vs getting up there - We have felt it more convenient to just get the card and license on line, instead of spending vacation time doing same. Trying to find a place to procure these items up there could turn into a frantic hassle. I have experienced the frenzy that can result from such a decision, and that was before ""the system"" became computerized. Bill"
4925833,lawson2343,2016-06-14 07:43:00,459,"I agree with Bill. We always get out licenses/outdoor card on line. Here is another benefit of it. You get an email receipt and a pdf file of the license. Put those on your phone. That way if you lose paper copies, you have proof of purchase. My buddy just had that problem coming through a fish checkpoint Saturday. Forgot his tackle box at the camp. The CO accepted the fact that he had an email receipt for purchase of the license and we were on our way. As far as Conservation verse Sportsman - it really does depend on how much you plan to eat. Going to Canada is not about the fish you bring home! So when you think of the cost difference between the licenses, those two extra walleye you bring home are very expensive. Have fun!"
4926633,1/4 oz Jig,2016-06-14 11:35:00,90,"I have always purchased the conservation license because 2 walleyes a day is enough to feed me for shore lunch and I don't take any home so I don't have to worry about whats in the freezer at camp. If you want to bring fish home it might be better to go with the sportsman. Also I find it much more convenient to by online before the trip. You can print multiple copies. Put 1 in your wallet, 1 in the tackle box. My question revolves around musky fishing. On a conservation there are to be no musky in possession. Doesn't say anything about specifically targeting them. So when I catch a musky do all hook removal in the net at boat side and remove it measure and snap a quick pic and release it am I breaking the law? Seems ridiculous but I read a different post where someone got fined for having a walleye a 1/2cm over and was fined so who knows! Maybe one of the lodge owners can chime in. Thanks in advance."
4926929,Whopper,2016-06-14 12:53:00,340,Online hands down is the way to go to get your license. Print off copies for sure.
4927561,Slushfish,2016-06-14 17:17:00,263,"Online for sure. We started buying a sportsman licence for one of my sons when he was ten so we didn't have to keep big fish to feed us. My wife and I and two boys could easily eat eight small walleye(the tasty ones) Then, when we started shore lunches on LOTW where the limit is two, we had to buy a licence for him. Even though he didn't need one."
4927577,okiesprayguy,2016-06-14 17:22:00,12,"Sounds like online is the way to purchase. I'm thinking 3 conservation and 1 sportsman is what we'll do. Not likely to need the extra 2 for eating, but we can put away some fish. It also would allow for a muskie to be kept, if I got into a monster. Does anyone ever keep their ""overs""? Or just take a pic and release."
4927777,Guest,2016-06-14 18:56:00,0,"I buy both myself and my son a full sports license for Ontario. We try to come home with our 8 if possible, and yes we do take our ""overs"" if it works out. I like an occasional 24-25"" eye for grilling. They grill up way better than small ones, and a single 24"" walleye will feed my family of three for a meal. SL"
4928265,roscoe33,2016-06-14 22:05:00,653,"We take a break after crossing the border, go into the travel info center, find the bathroom, and get the license. Sometimes, we wait till we get to town. Stop for groceries, gas, coffee and donuts, and the license. There are plenty of places to buy them after you cross the border, as long as you are not traveling at night."
