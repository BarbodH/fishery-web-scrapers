Due to some mobility issues, finding the most accessible cabin and dock was a major concern. Shaggy at Hidden Bay, took pictures and wrote a description of each of the lakes. We are going to Armit Lake in early September. Service like that is something special! Thanks again to the whole Hidden Bay team! Share some of your stories!"
