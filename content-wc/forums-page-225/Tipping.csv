4956249,deadhead1,2016-06-29 08:50:00,193,"I generally don't agree with ""have to leave a tip"", to me tipping is for good service and if it is good I'll always leave at least 10%. On one trip we had a terrible guide the first day so we talked to camp owner and he said he would give us his best guide for the rest of the trip. He was right he was excellent at putting us on fish and had a great sense of humor. We wanted to get into some big pike but I could tell the guide didn't want to go for pike. I told him there was $100 in it if he found me a pike over 20 lbs. and I don't think my hook was out of the water before boat was moving and within 15 minutes we had the 20 lb fish in the boat! I always tip guide at end of each day rather than at end of trip so he knows that he will be paid for good service and we often get even better service second day out."
4956433,Ricky Spanish,2016-06-29 10:31:00,1298,"This is for two of us, me and the missus: Guides get $100/day, minimum. Trophy fish or exceptional numbers adds another $50-100. Waitress gets $100 for a five day stay. This is less than a restaurant would get from us for two great meals each day. I would guess that the bartenders get about $80-100 over five days. I don't actually want to know. My generosity is directly proportional to my alcohol content. More booze = more generous. The lodge we go to has separate jars for housekeeping, cooks, and dockhands. I always put $60 in each. Tips, gifts or invitations to fish on our boat on their days/evenings off are pretty common, too."
4950337,NP4ME,2016-06-26 10:51:00,378,"Every year my group has a big discussion about tipping. It is one that seems to never be resolved. We don't want to be tight, but we don't have a whole lot of money and the trips are darn expensive the way it is. We have a new dilemma this year. In years past we have gone to a lodge where the help was hired in by the lodge owner. This year we are going to a family run camp. Would you guys tip any differently in this type of situation? Our trip is an American plan package. I know we have discussed the tipping issue before, which was good discussion, but I'm curious about any new thoughts. Also curious about what those of you normally tip on your trips. Do you do a percentage of total bill? A flat tip rate? Thanks for any suggestions."
4950393,Mondo,2016-06-26 10:59:00,61,"Regardless of who is providing the service to you, they are trying to make your trip as enjoyable and fulfilling as possible. This applies to family, or hired help... Our experience has been to tip 10% of the entire bill. Everyone in the party understands this PRIOR to arriving. They have an entire year to save and plan for this expense. Typically, this ranges from $60- 75 per person. Hope this help. P.S. I've never had anyone in my party refuse or argue this point. If they did, I wouldn't want them to join us as they would be counting the number of minnows they use and only pay for those. Life is too short to sweat the small stuff... Have fun!"
4950577,BornToFish,2016-06-26 11:50:00,1224,"Greetings, I have friends that are seasonal workers at fishing lodges in NW Ontario. Tips are very important to their annual income. That is, their tips go a long ways in meeting their expenses during the off-season. These friends know that customer service is important to the tips they receive. To me, tips are earned. Someone is not assured a tip from me simply because they showed up for work. I do not feel obligated to tip anyone when they provided the bare minimum of service for whatever I hired them to do for me. There have been a few isolated instances when I did not tip someone at a fishing lodge. I generally tip the camp's cook and wait-staff American Plan), dock hand and guide (if used). Over the years, I average around $25 per person, per week. On a side note, I've found that there are other ways to ""tip"" a lodge's staff. That is, I show interest in them as people. For example, I ask about their families. I greet them by name each morning and have conversation when they are not busy. I thank them each night for whatever they did for me that day. These little acts go a long way in setting the atmosphere of the camp. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4950713,Pooch,2016-06-26 13:10:00,4619,"Each guy in our group ponies up $20 per fisherman, per week. Two week stay is $40. This gets divided by the staff.Years ago we had a real cheap azz with us who through in a dollar. He was never asked to join the group again. Some of us came up with a little extra each to not make our group look like jerks.Pooch"
4951089,Obabikon,2016-06-26 15:55:00,2370,"If you're doing American Plan with daily service, it should be a minimum of 5% of the entire bill. That's what I suggest anyways. It splits up 4-5 different ways most of the time. Guide tips should range from $50-$100 per day in my opinion. (that's total, not per person and depends how many people he was in charge of... and how good of a job he did) I also tell people tips are earned, not demanded. If you don't feel like you got adequate service, feel free to tip less. I expect nothing but the best from my staff though, and if you feel like you got better service... feel free to tip more."
4951209,martinbns,2016-06-26 17:31:00,1520,"We just went to Totem. I tipped the restaurant staff $75 for three days and gave the guide who was terrific $250 for two days and replaced the 3 Husky Jerks of his we lost, another $40. I tend to be relatively generous with people that provide excellent service. These folks have to live on relatively small incomes, and noone who owns a family camp is getting rich off the weekly rates."
4951585,46Harley,2016-06-26 22:16:00,149,"There are 6 of us in our group and we have all agreed ahead of time that each of us will add $100 to our bill for a tip for the staff. The dock hand may even get a bottle of Crown on our last night. I have to tell you though, our service leaves nothing to be desired at Young's Wilderness Camp in Nestor Falls."
4951633,martinbns,2016-06-27 02:51:00,1520,"This makes me think a bit about how we define service. Every time I visit the US, I am amazed by how customer centric most business is compared to Canada. How do you guys compare the quality of service you get in Canada to the US and do you tip the same way in both countries?"
4951737,Pooch,2016-06-27 05:28:00,4619,"How do you guys compare the quality of service you get in Canada to the US and do you tip the same way in both countries?Quality of service more or less about the same in both countries. Gratuities always the same as people are always the same more or less. In general I think Canadians are a more friendly bunch and more similar to the country folks I grew up with and still live around. City folks seem to always have their ""shields up"" turned on and in appearance only seem less friendly or approachable. Both sides of the border.Pooch"
4951817,port1042,2016-06-27 06:18:00,509,"I fish with 2 other guys and we use a camp boat. There are 2 dock hands who provide not only general dock services but also filet and package our fish. The housekeeping staff cleans the cabin after our departure (and of course it's clean when we arrive) and they change out our towels mid-week. We don't have daily housekeeping services and we cook our own meals. We tip $150.00 to the dock hands and leave $30.00 for the housekeeping crew. Overall that works out to be about 10% of our lodge bill, pre-tax. I've never been sure if this is too much or too little. We get excellent service and the staff seems pleased to see us on return trips! Since we're happy to pay it I guess it's not too much -- but is it too little?"
