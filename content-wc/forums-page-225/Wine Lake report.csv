4953433,ILScott,2016-06-27 21:14:00,139,"This is a late report but got back June 18th. We had great weather and caught a limit of walleye in the first hour fishing with many thrown back. This is the first year I fished a different area everyday. Mud, Beaver, Ghost, Turn Around, Sandy Beach, Dynamite Bay, North End, Halverson and Annishinabi. I was successful in all those spots. Some I had to search and change techniques but it worked. My boat partner and I tied for the fish contest day with another boat from my cabin. During the week I believe 3 or 4 pike over 40"" where caught and some 39"" and 38"" to go with them. Many walleye caught in camp this week with the biggest around 28.5 but many in the 21-24 class. I fished for lake trout daily on Wine but never got one until I went to Annishinabi. Other wise it was a great week and the first time trying all the different lakes. I used to fish the same spot over and over because I knew the fish where there. This was a nice change and picked up a few new spots."
4953617,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-28 05:55:00,725,"Scott, Good to hear you had good success! We go first week so Ghost is a waste of time. Once the water warms to over 60F the trout go deeper. Anishinabi is clear and deep so glad to hear you tied into some trout there. I have fished Anishinabi once but caught nothing. On that same day one of our guys caught several on a humpback crankbait that is not available any longer. Did Nick take good care of you? What did you miss about Herb and Ann and what did you like about the Karakis family? As I mentioned, we will always miss Herb and Ann but Nick and his family will do well because he has lived his life as a Canadian fisherman. Did you have to use minnows to catch the walleye or did twisters work? Were you jigging or dragging rigs? Fish On! Hooks"
4953641,ILScott,2016-06-28 06:15:00,139,"Hooks, When we went to Anishinabi we fishied Halveson for smallmouth first. We then trolled just past the outpost cabin in 25 feet and caught some nice northern. Once we got to the first point on the left is where we caught the trout in about 35 feet. Temp on Wine was about 65 degrees and Annishinabi was 57. Nick took good care of us and he sold a lot of minnows that week. He is more chatty and wanting to get to know people a little bit. Herb and Ann already knew everyone so they did not do this as much. He came up and checked on us a couple of times and tried to get people on fish. Herb knew the lakes like the back of his hand and Nick is just getting a feel for the lakes. The week we where there should help him locate fish for that time of the year. Nick has some good plans for upgrades. But you are right it is a little different without Ann and Herb but I think Nick will give it a new feel. For most of the week I fish with bottom bouncers and my homemade spinners. We pulled minnows and worms with worms out fishing most of the time. In beaver the fish wanted a slow drift and jig. Many people slow drifted spots with minnows and got a lot of walleye. Always a fun time. IlScott"
4954257,jsmyers,2016-06-28 09:34:00,198,"Thanks for the report Scott!I'll be taking my first trip to WLC September 3-10, and I'm pretty excited. I fished Wine one day in 2011 when we stayed on Wabaskang and did the portage a few times when I was growing up and staying at Gawley's.I want to catch everything, but especially big pike. Glad to hear that some big pike were caught recently. HeHooksHimself has written that he hasn't seen as many big pike recently. My biggest came from the north end of the lake in 2011. It was a really fat one about 37"" long. I really want to break 40""!What is Anishinabi like? It seems so immense, deep, and clear, that I have to imagine it is an intimidating lake to fish.Question: Does Nick (and previously did Herb) ask that all Lake Trout from Wine Lake are released, or only ones over a certain size?"
4954681,ILScott,2016-06-28 12:14:00,139,"Anishinabi is a massive lake but we only fished the northeast narrow bay. We actually where fishing for smallies most of the day in Halveson and it was raining so we did not explore the big lake. Anishinabi has big pike also. Anything over 22"" for trout has to go back in Wine. If you want to go for trout I would recommend going up to little trout lake for a day, beautiful little lake. If you have any questions please PM me."
4888865,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-01 10:58:00,725,"Well, we have been back a few days now and were delayed on the road as Doc had a little problem with his ticker that took an extra few days for me to get home. All is well so here is our report. Went in Fri. before opener and did some trout fishing and hunting. As usual the falls were productive this time of year and Dunkin' Bob pulled out a few big smallies including a 19 1/4. Other Bob and I each caught a trout, mine being a big boy at almost 33"". Sat. and Sun. were pretty hot but the falls produced plenty of walleye for our dinner. The fish moved out of the falls during the week and all of us struggled to catch fish of eater size as almost all of the walleyes were in the 20's, but a 26"" won the pot for walleye. Doc managed to run into a 38"" pike to take the prize for the biggest pike. I was sure my trout would hold out but I put Sleepy on a 35"" behemoth. I netted it and I know that fat boy was over 25 lbs. Dunkin' Bob thought his smallie would holdout but Netter and Other Bob took a trip to Tipover and caught the first smallie I ever heard of from that lake, a healthy 19 1/2"" whopper. Doc and Netter took a trip to Little Trout and brought back some eater size trout that grilled up really nice, garnished with a little garlic, lemon and Netter's special spice concoction. It was heavenly. We kept a count through the week and between 3 boats pulled up 776 fish. It would have been higher if we just sat on walleye holes, but trout fever had us trolling most afternoons and evenings. All six of us caught trout on crankbaits. Man, are those things fun and the really make the reels sing when they see the boat or a net. A little bit about Nick, the new owner of Wine Lake Camp. We really appreciated his approach to our group. He went overboard to make sure we had all we need and to make sure we had a positive experience. If he keeps that up, he will be successful. He is fortunate to have very good helpers this year in Brent and Karen- hard workers with a great attitude and great sense of humor. As usual, we had a fantastic time and are already marking the days until next May. Until then, we will be dreaming about our glimpse of paradise in May of 2016. Fish On! Hooks"
4889321,jsmyers,2016-06-01 12:35:00,198,"Thanks for the Report!I've been eagerly awaiting it. I hope Doc is well.I'll take my first trip to WLC the first week of September (I've fished it a tiny bit over the years).When you say the falls, you mean Anishinabi, correct (Not the falls out of Wabaskang)?BTW, for those that care, Nick's blog is at a different location than the old WLC blog: http://winelakecamp2.blogspot.com/"
4890241,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-01 16:50:00,725,I was referring to Anishinabi Falls.
4890849,ILScott,2016-06-01 19:22:00,139,Glad you had a good time. I am headed up in a week and boating in on June 11. Was the water low? Glad to hear Nick is doing a nice job. Did he make any changes during the week from when Ann and Herb owned it? Mainly did he have the fish contest and ice cream?
4891521,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-02 05:27:00,725,"Fishing contest had a little wrinkle. No burbot or whitefish bonuses. Ice cream and brownies by Maddie (Nick's 19 yr. old daughter- she REALLY runs the camp...) were delicious. Return time moved up to 3:00, which works out for us since we usually come in for our big meal at 3 to be back out by 5-5:30. Nick eliminated two teams (one from our cabin, which would have been the winner) for oversize. He is trying to make a point that the MNR will have no leeway. By the way, MNR landed and checked one of our boats on the water. They were probably looking for walleye taken before the opener. This was Friday before opener and they measured a couple smallies they had. They were spot on at 13 3/4. They just checked the coolers on the boat. They had one empty beer can which was smashed and in a pocket but they didn't pat them down. Another of our boats at the falls had a couple smallies at 14"" (they thought that was the legal max.) Fortunately they only checked the one boat."
4891641,pjshorthorn,2016-06-02 06:06:00,5654,"Hooks, Sounds like you fellas had a great time with the exception of Doc not feeling well. Glad to hear he is doing better. You fellas caught some nice fish and quite the quantity as well. I'm especially glad to see that everyone in the report is referred to by their nicknames which is a long standing tradition with all of my trips as well. I fella really has to earn that nickname through those ""special"" moments that just happen during a trip Take care and Go Irish !! PjShorthorn."
4892601,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-02 11:07:00,725,"PJShorthorn, Yeah, nicknames are important. A little about Doc. He had an ""episode"" Friday night he didn't mention to anyone. In the car right after we stopped for something to eat in Eau Claire, he said he couldn't get comfortable and needed to stop and ""walk it off."" He said he had a headache. When I asked for more information he admitted the headache was jaw pain and he had chest pains. We stopped immediately and Other Bob, or Obie, is a physician and we had an ambulance called immediately. We were in Tomah and they sent him to Lacrosse and he was cathed and stented by 11:00 pm. I hung around with him until Monday but the other guys left for home once Obie determined that he was going to be okay. You just never know what is going to happen and we were glad it didn't happen a day or two before. By the way, I finally caught a few fish on one of your Bad *** rigs! Hooks"
4896457,pjshorthorn,2016-06-03 14:20:00,5654,"Hooks, Since you actually used the Bad Azz Baits, you are now a certified field tester. Out of curiosity, did you land walleye using them? Did you use the standard spinners or the slow death rigs I sent ya? Minnow or crawler ? Boy, Doc is lucky you weren't in the bush. Very glad to hear he is feeling better. I bet he notices a big difference after the stent was put in.Take care,PjShorthorn."
4897193,HeHooksHimself,2016-06-03 19:06:00,725,"Well, I am honored to be a certified field tester. Does that mean I have to wear yoga pants or can I get by with a three hour nap on the bunk? I had one hooked up most of the week and would use it on nice wind aided drifts. It worked as good as anything for those circumstances. It was a minnow on the straight hook for the most part. Doc is doing better. Yeah, we might have had to call a chopper or something. He is not his old self yet but hey, it has only been 6 days. We are gearing up for what might be our last fly-in with Mattice in September to Luella Lake. We are 98 days out, not that anyone is counting or geeked up about the trip."
4897609,pjshorthorn,2016-06-03 23:38:00,5654,"I'm thinking that since you have access to all the ND athletic gear, you should probably stick to wearing that while taking those 3 hr power naps Glad you caught some fish on the spinners. An official field tester certificate will be mailed to you in about 180 days of so. PjShorthorn."
