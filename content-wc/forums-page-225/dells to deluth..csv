4957297,Pooch,2016-06-29 18:40:00,4619,"Came home from Canada through there ten days ago and some single lane traffic, but nothing out of the ordinary for that long stretch of road going ""kitty cornered"" through Wisconsin. For me the worst part of our trip is Rockford to Eau Claire. Once we are on 53 I always start to relax more. I think there was some single lane on 53 also, but nothing to fret about.I've never had a Canada trip where there isn't some road construction somewhere. Even the Red Lake road was being rebuilt south of Ear Falls for about ten miles of sandy gravel with a water truck keeping the dust somewhat under control. Headed back in ten days for our mid summer trip. Give us a report when you get home. By the way, do you have an IPASS in your traveling vehicle? Wonderful addition if you are in and or near the northern Illinois toll roads. Tolls are half price and you don't even slow down. Has easily paid for itself in two years.Pooch"
