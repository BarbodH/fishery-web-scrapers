4956257,sauvain,2016-06-29 08:53:00,63,"Been flying in to Birch Lake with Peter Kay for years. Taking the wife on her first fly-in trip this year, along with another couple. We are going to Whitewater Lake with Mattice Outfitters. We live in NW Iowa so we will be taking highway 20 across to I-35 and heading up through the twin cities and spending the night at Silver Bay, MN along Lake Superior. Never have went this way before. We were wondering of any must sees on this route. We will then take off from Silver Bay, MN and cross into Canada near Thunder Bay. Head north up to Armstrong and spend the night in the cabin before we fly out bright and early Saturday morning. Any advice on ways to bypass the cities? Or any advice on the trip would be greatly appreciated. We chose Mattice Lake Outfitters off the reputation on this board. We chose Whitewater Lake due to electricity and we are staying in the flush toilet cabin Trying to give the wife some comforts of home. We will packing in lots of Crown Royal for the trip. Looking forward to some great walleye fishing, maybe a master angler pike, and some great shore lunches! Any help on Whitewater would be appreciated also."

Daylight hours and non-rush hour and you should be fine through the stretch. It's a couple miles long."
4956417,Bstar,2016-06-29 10:30:00,564,MN 61 between Duluth and Grand Portage is one of the most scenic roads in the Midwest. There are a lot of waterfalls and scenic overlooks along the route. Gooseberry Falls State Park is a must stop as it's right on the highway. Plan for some extra time on this route. Go to www.northshorevisitor.com for more info.
4956449,bigwalleye1,2016-06-29 10:36:00,2632,"+1 there. If you've had enough of the interstate by the time you get to Duluth, stay to the right on the north side of Duluth and take the ""old"" 61 to Two Harbors. It's along the lake, and there's lots more to see than the 4 lane bypass wasteland. Russ Kendalls smoked fish is on the northern end of the stretch. There's a nice meal stop on the left side of the road around Castle Danger area, a bunch of red buildings, a local will help me with a name. HAVE A PIECE OF PIE ( and it's NOT Betty's Pies. That went downhill after Betty sold out)"
4956521,WallyNut,2016-06-29 10:56:00,79,"I35 from Rush City to Hinckley is under construction. I went to Duluth on June 17, took a hour and a half to go that 25 mile stretch. That was at about 2:30 in the afternoon. The timing on that stretch is important. Bigwalleye1 is right on with ""Old 61""."
4956617,LOW1,2016-06-29 11:43:00,2828,"There are some neat old mansions to tour in Duluth, if that is the sort of thing that you like. http://glensheen.org/tours/And just the drive on 61 is excellent. Budget some daylight time just for walking on the beaches.I don't know of any way to avoid the construction delay on I35. I would think that any time between 8 am and 8 pm on weekends could be bad."
4957137,port1042,2016-06-29 17:07:00,509,Split Rock is a good stop too. Not too far from Gooseberry Falls. The border crossing at Pigeon River is great and quick. If you want to make a real trip out of it -- take a day trip to Isle Royale out of Grand Portage. It's a great trip but you'll have to add a full day to your itinerary.
4957305,Pooch,2016-06-29 18:49:00,4619,"Nice scenic route, but can be somewhat congested at times. Especially nearer the holidays and tourist towns which is about all of them along the route.Not a road you can plan on making any time on. Once you get further north the traffic thins out to the border crossing at Pigeon River. Usually the cheapest place for fuel is at Grand Portage just south of the border ten miles or so.Be safe and watch for pedestrians all along route 61. Drive doesn't get a chance to see much scenery.Pooch"
