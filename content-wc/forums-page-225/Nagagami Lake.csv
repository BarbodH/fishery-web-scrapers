It wasn't non stop action but there were plenty of fish. Chuck's point, Twin Island and the sunken reef continue to hold good numbers of fish. Timberwolf point and Debbies Island also did but more dependent on time of day and wave direction. In fact, the wind and waves determined where we fished more than anything else. The rivers are fishable but mainly for eater fish. The MNR was in last week to do a fish sample study. They had several small nets up all over the lake. I don't think they took too many but don't really know for sure. The sizes were good. I had more fish from 17-18"" this year than in years past. I still feel this is the hardest Walleye to find on this lake. At least a third of the fish caught were over 20"". Our groups biggest was 26"" which is small compared to other years. Everyone caught at least one 24"" or bigger though. I had 10 or so that big or bigger. Black flies seemed bad. Mosquitoes aren't too bad though."
