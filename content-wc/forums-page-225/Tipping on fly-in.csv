We have a camp attendant, that I believe will filet fish, put gas in boats, keep us with ice for the crown royal, etc....what should we tip him? %wise that is. Also should we tip the pilot on the way out?"

John is a great guy but don't think that is part of his duites. I outright asked one of the attendants not long ago and he said "" I don't expect anything, but when I do get tips it's usually about $30 US per person"" Some more, some less. Our group of four leaves about $150. These guys often stay for years at the same place and if you go back you'll have a great friend if you show your appreciation. At MLO, no matter what you'll always have great service. We tip the inbound and outbound pilots--often not the same- We do about $10 each man/each way."
