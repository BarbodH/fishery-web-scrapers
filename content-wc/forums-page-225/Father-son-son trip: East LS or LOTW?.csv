4854169,Carnhzkr,2016-05-19 18:50:00,964,"That would be very welcomed. I can use all the intel I can get. Hope you have a great trip, ftfarms. Great two trips, that is."
4957697,LacSeulSam,2016-06-29 23:08:00,9,"Hi Keith, If you are still looking for a place on Lac Seul, I have a very nice cabin available on Lost Lake. We are located on the Lac Seul First Nation and have weeks open in late July early August as we are a new operation.The NE part of the lake will be a distance, but there are many good fishing locations close by. Sam"
4836346,emma17,2016-05-14 18:58:00,436,I imagine somebody has done a detail expense sheet that compares the cost of a housekeeping plan that includes their cost of food and associated kitchen supplies to the cost of an American plan. How much difference in ultimate cost is there really?
4836594,ftfarms,2016-05-14 20:50:00,444,I've fished both er nds of Lac suel many times and now we go to lotws out of morson and stay at milesbay with Matt and Jenn. Great camp great prices. The only differance I see in lotws and lac suel is I used to catch a little bigger walleye on lac suel. We catch more and bigger smallmouths on lotws. And some really really nice crappies on lotws. We go through Baudette MN faster to get in and out of canada and 40 miles over the boarder we are backing the boat in and headed to camp. I don't miss the drive to lac suel at all.
4836602,mt hook,2016-05-14 20:51:00,65,"I did a quick comparison a long long time ago. It is a little cheaper to do a housekeeping plane, as long as you don't get to extravagant. That being said,What your time worth? I love to plane the tripe/ food, gas, hotels, packing,cooking, clean up, I sure I left some out. Lets just stay with the food. I and the rest of the group like to eat well. If youtake all you need, compared to how almost any camp will feed you, camp wins...I know that after 2 or 3 days of cooking, cleaning, and FISHING HARD it's timefor a brake. No time for that, your only there for week right.Here is one way to keep you cost down. Ask to do a modified plain, you do breakfastand lunch, camp feeds you dinner. I did this for many years and it works well.And it gives you lots more time for fishing. I don't no about you but, I would much rather fish and fish hard then spend two hr.a day cooking and cleaning up. Shure everyone in the group pitches in and helpsbut it's still two hr. of no fishing. When I go north fishing thats all I want to do! Let the camp do it, and RELAXI can cook and clean up at home. I can't catch bass, walleye, musky, crappie.perch and northern all in one day at home. What your time worth?"
4836666,prov1800,2016-05-14 21:09:00,5010,If your looking to target pike this iscthe bestvtime to be doing that.iam guessing water temps are the same throughout our area.they are 42-46 f slightly warmer in bays.pike will stayvshallowr right now due to the cold water and are easy targets right now.if you wait another couple of weeks the big pike will start to go deeper.
4836754,Lotw1,2016-05-14 22:27:00,36,Yup. Spring is always a fun time to break out the open water gear and chase some pike. Have plenty of stuff to do around the cabin but when mid afternoon rolls around I'll be out doing a little casting. Hopefully get into a couple big ones and keep a 3 or 4 pounder for dinner. Thanks for the water temp update.
4853489,Carnhzkr,2016-05-19 15:01:00,964,"Thanks for all of the recommendations. I just booked with Miles Bay Camp. I'm sure we'll have a great trip. Jared, if it's okay I might swing by your place for a first-hand look at your camp, if I'm in the area. I keep promising my wife I'll take her on an American Plan trip one of these years."
4853585,pjshorthorn,2016-05-19 15:27:00,5654,When are you heading there? I'll be going to Redwing Lodge June 18th-22nd. PjShorthorn.
4853681,Carnhzkr,2016-05-19 15:59:00,964,"I'll miss you by a day, Pat. I'll be at Fisherman's Cove on LS 6/25 - 7/2, then to Miles Bay Camp on 7/23 - 7/30. With any luck I may swing another trip in September.Oh wait, I see you're at Redwing in June. Guess I'll miss you by a month and a day."
4853721,pjshorthorn,2016-05-19 16:15:00,5654,"We will be fishing in a lot of areas towards where you will be staying. I'll mark up a map for you and the boys where we had some success........hopefully We will be mostly fishing for musky and walleye. I wouldn't think the fishing will be that much different in July vs. June. Glad you were able to put a boys trip together with your sons. It will be fun to hear how you guys do. Take care, PjShorthorn."
4854081,ftfarms,2016-05-19 18:22:00,444,Me and the wife will be at milesbay July 9th-16th. And then august 13th-20th I go with the guys. When we get back on July 16th I'll let you know what was working for us. We mainly fish fo walleye and smallmouth. I'll fish for musky a little while for two days.
4833498,Carnhzkr,2016-05-13 17:41:00,964,"It looks like I'll be putting together a father/son/son trip in late July to early August this year. My last six trips have been to the NW section of Lac Seul, and in fact I'll be there again with both sons and my wife the last week in June, so I'd like to do something different for a change in scenery. My first thought was to try the eastern side of the lake since I've never been there. LS Outposts has been high on my wish list for some time, and they do have an opening so that's a strong possibility, but I've also been thinking about trying LOTW at some point. I've never been on that water and it seems a shame to pass it up since it's a much easier drive. So here are my questions: Would I be disappointed in the walleye fishing on LOTW? I've gotten used to some pretty outstanding walleye weeks on LS. I'm not familiar with LOTWs, and I know there are a bazillion lodges so I'd be pretty lost as to where to go. I told my wife I'll take her to either Obabikon or Witch Bay someday, but those are both American Plan. I love my sons but not enough to drop that kind of coin. So the parameters I need to fill are housekeeping, good walleye action, and the more secluded the better. Any recommendations? BTW, my sons are both adultish (17 and 21) and they both have many Ontario trips under their belts. Also, I'll be pulling my own boat. Thanks for reading and responding."
4833810,Obabikon,2016-05-13 19:33:00,2370,"There really are a ton of options on Lake of the Woods. If you're looking for mainland housekeeping... Mylie's Place would be hard to beat. Justin is top notch. I have a pretty nice outpost cabin up by the narrows that is reasonably priced if you're looking to go that route. If you're wanting housekeeping, remote, but at a main resort.... Young's or Tamarack would both be great options."
4833882,Lotw1,2016-05-13 20:05:00,36,"Miles Bay Camp out of Morson. Secluded, great fishing, great price."
4834378,pjshorthorn,2016-05-14 05:33:00,5654,"Howdy Keith, Let me know if you decide to go to the NE section using Lac Seul Outposts. I'll send you maps with all of my favorite spots marked up. I could even be persuaded to send some more purple and pink spinner rigs so the wifey can outfish you boys . I was recently asked to go on a trip to LOTW which was too good to pass up.It will be my first time fishing there so I have a lot to learn about the lake, but I'm fortunate to be going with a LOTW veteran.We will be fishing out of Redwing Lodge which is around the Morson area and we will be fishing primarily walleye and musky. Going June 18th and I would be happy to send info on the areas we fished if you would be interested. Let me know if I can help out. PjShorthorn."
4834698,prov1800,2016-05-14 07:24:00,5010,If you head up to the NE section you won't be disappointed. Fishing will be basically the same as the west side.butvyou will be way out there.lac seul outpost is in chamberlain narrows and its a 40 mi boat ride from deception bay.the muskie fishing there is the best.
4834802,Obabikon,2016-05-14 07:42:00,2370,"I have to agree with LOTW1... Matt at Miles bay camp is a great guy. Great family there, and in the middle of prime fishing."
4834850,Lotw1,2016-05-14 07:50:00,36,"Obabikon, any idea what the water temps are? Bringing the boat up tmrw and going out to open the cabin up. Might try catch a pike or two."
4835258,Carnhzkr,2016-05-14 10:04:00,964,"Thanks, Pat. I had already added to the plus side of the scale for Lac Seul Outposts that I know a guy that'd be willing to point me in the right direction. If end up in that area, you'll be the first I contact. That'd be a huge help."
4835378,Obabikon,2016-05-14 11:07:00,2370,"No clue... been so busy getting the camp ready, haven't started working on the boats. I don't have a unit on yet. But... it is currently snowing off and on, and the couple times I did touch the water, it was horribly cold. So, I'm going to say they'll be a little sluggish. However, its supposed to be nice in a couple days. (mid to upper 60's)"
4835914,Lotw1,2016-05-14 16:07:00,36,Sounds good. Thanks
