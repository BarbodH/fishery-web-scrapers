4949257,packpro,2016-06-25 18:17:00,695,Took my boat for a shake down run about a month before our Canadian trip. No problems with the boat. Ran great. Tied off on the community dock and went to double check the condition of the bunks on the trailer. All good. I had checked the tire before I left to that morning. However while checking the bunks I got to see the entire inside sidewall of the tires. This could only be seen when the boat was off the trailer. One of the tires had a big bubble in the sidewall. Very glad to have caught that before the 800 mile trip.

It must be more common than I would have thought, as the dealer had them in stock. My guess is the break was due to weight in the front of the boat, causing a slight bend in the tongue area. Bill"

I would hate to plan a trip only to see it end badly with a breakdown."
4949937,LoDo,2016-06-26 09:20:00,721,"Leaving our camp last year between Red Lake and Ear Falls there was a nice rig driving northbound on the 105. The trailer came off the pickup truck at 50mph across on coming traffic and into the ditch. I'd never seen anything like it. Id guess the hitch was not the right size, didn't lock and clearly didn't have the backup chains. As much I want to say the driver is an idiot, I'd have to no all the facts first. Triple check everything and its a great idea to have backups."

I have a roller trailer but have 2 little bunks up front and noticed it looked a little funky when the son and I went Musky fishing last week,pulled trailer out of water and parked it and inspected and 1 was rotten,also replaced when doing lights. And why would they not make them out of treated lumber ?"
4951065,WallyWarrior,2016-06-26 15:42:00,2488,Some of those chemicals used to treat lumber will eat through an aluminum boat. Hope you thought of that in your replacement decision. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
