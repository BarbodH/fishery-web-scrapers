Looking at the weather forecast, my week is the hottest of the year (average high of 76 and average low of 58). I realize that's still not exactly hot, but wondering if I might stand to see a higher percentage of bigger fish or what. I""m also interested in getting out on the water at night and trying to see some northern lights as well as I have yet to catch any the past 3 trips. Will see if there are any ""forecasts"" for those as well. ."

You are going at the worst time of year for them to be active, April and Sept are the best months to actually see them, but they are not as spectacular as the dead of winter. I lived at the 57* of latitude and rarely saw them in the summer, because it was only dark for 3-4 hours. I wonder the 51.10* is far enough north for them to be active."
4949729,forgop,2016-06-26 06:57:00,880,"I'll be there for 8 nights, so I'm just trying to figure out what might give the best possibility while I am there. I realize it's not the best time but looking to find the best possibility while I'm there. I see options for twitter/email/app notifications but I need text notifications with my inReach device to receive notification while I'm in the bush. Sent from my SM-G935T using Tapatalk"
4949745,martinbns,2016-06-26 07:12:00,1520,"Just stay up late a few times. IF they are up, you will seem them, in the summer they don't have the vibrant colours they do in the winter, they are just sort of a brightness in the sky but are visible. We had friends come an visit us in March one year and after way to many wobbly pops we went out on our deck and we couldn't get one of them to come back in despite it being -20*."
4949817,wallydave,2016-06-26 08:33:00,2151,"I have had many June trips, I did see some Northern lights in mid June, late at night, nothing spectacular, just a few quick flashes. August and September trips have been much better displays, flying with Hidden Bay in early September we had two nights of displays. The first night was cloudy and no moon. The sky just closed green and white! The second night was clear, and we saw a single curtain of glowing green along the horizon. Good luck on your trip!"
4949833,LoDo,2016-06-26 08:40:00,721,"Our camp is just north of 51*, fly-in, super remote and we saw them last year in late Aug. They were best viewed after midnight without a moon."
4949913,imafishslayer,2016-06-26 09:15:00,64,The solar activity is in a dead phase right now so I would not expect much for Northern Lights this year
4951137,Bill Krejca,2016-06-26 16:21:00,6107,"One of the looked-forward-to aspects of our September/October camping trips was seeing the northern lights. It was standard procedure to check the sky before going to bed. Being on an island away from all civilization illumination is a great place to observe. Sometimes the sky just shows a tiny bit of brightness to the north, sort of like maybe a town was in that direction, and other times it might be colored, mostly greenish, and cover a large portion of the sky. Shooting stars was an added bonus. Bill"
4951193,bigwillies,2016-06-26 17:03:00,515,I find about 16 beer really get the northern lights goin
4951681,Paul H,2016-06-27 05:12:00,1232,Except last week had some great activity - in the UP from my UP friends. Go figure
