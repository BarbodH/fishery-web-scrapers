Looking forward to the Ice Fishing season in a few short weeks.Spent a day on Quinte, last Monday. Thought I'd share a Pic. of the gang: I'm the character, bottom right corner.http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...tos/quinte.jpgMost were brought in off Planer Boards - 2 flat lining - 1 Dip'syLooking forward to posting up during Ice Fishing - the boat is now asleep till spring.bobby"

We saw only one fish caught just north of the cement plant. With 133 fow, were you closer to Lake Ontario?FrankLeighP.S I hope there enough ice to get out at Beaverton, this year."
1512515,marapoint,2012-12-12 09:28:00,38,"Hi FrankWe trolled between the Bat Cave and Lighthouse Pt. We had good luck trolling along the dropoff's both sides.The day after I came home, one of the people in our Party (he stayed behind for another day) caught a personal best 15.5lb beauty - same location.As for Beaverton, I am 1 mile from the Trent Canal, on Marapoint. I ice fish it most days thru out the winter. Stay in touch by pm or email and I'll give you the current conditions - I just don't take anyones word - I drill myself.bobby"
1512521,marapoint,2012-12-12 09:55:00,38,"Frank,Just re-read your ps again - this time a little closer. We had excellent ice from Beaverton to the North Pt of Thorah East Bay all winter. Average 10"" of good blue. Yes - the Trout Grounds were poor (White Shoal) but we had no issues catching Whitefish/Walleye/Perch where we fished. We fished up until March 20th.Here's a couple links: The Launch area is Centennial Beach - maintained by the Township of Brock. The whole Bay your viewing had no less than 10"" of ice. If you look close you'll see Mara Point. Centennial Beach is at the end of the 9th Conc:http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...os/WildMap.jpgThe flag area was my area last winter 2012.http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...CampGoFish.jpgSome fishy Pic's from that area:http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...b112012001.jpghttp://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...52012004-1.jpghttp://i964.photobucket.com/albums/a...b082012012.jpgKept mostly males - 10"" and over.Towards Georgina - between Thorah and Georgina - it was okay in most spots - but there were the usual pressure cracks. I usually don't go over that way - no need to as I can hit the trout grounds from my house in 10 minutes.Always like fishing with people - stay in touch,bobby"
1512538,FrankLeigh,2012-12-12 10:49:00,80,"Hi mara,Thanks for the info. We have always just fished for lake trout and whitefish in 70 + fow, so about 7 or 8 miles out. We usually go with Roy C. (if you know him). Last year there wasn't ice out that far, so we didn't go.We normally do a two day trip and are normally successful.I have also fished the Narrows for the perch derby a few times and also in the fall.FrankLeigh"
