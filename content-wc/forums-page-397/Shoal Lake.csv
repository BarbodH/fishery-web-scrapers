We stayed at Ash Rapids Lodge which is located on LOTW right by the entrance into Shoal Lake. We mostly fished LOTW for walleye. If catching nice Pike is your thing, I would recommend giving it a try."
1517249,reconssd,2012-12-27 19:31:00,147,Thank you to everyone who has shared their experiences and information. Have a happy and healthy 2013.
1516716,reconssd,2012-12-25 16:28:00,147,"Happy holidays everyone. Has anyone fished this body of water? If so, how was it? Thanks in advance for your replies."
1516721,bassnblast,2012-12-25 16:56:00,56,"Spent a day fishing Shoal Lake the first week of June. We were staying at Crow Rock on LOTW and took the 45 minute run to Shoal -- it was well worth it. Caught a lot of bass and pike. It is closed to walleye fishing, but my brother caught a 33"" while bass fishing. I plan to go back again and spend more time on Shoal..."
1516725,Limeyangler,2012-12-25 17:08:00,563,Walleye is closed and there is a no live bait rule in effect as far as i know. I have never fished it on the open water but it is good for crappie and whitefish in the winter.
1516765,zeebee,2012-12-25 19:36:00,1144,I used to fish it regularly as its only a couple hr drive for me. It is closed to walleye although you have access to LOW main body. As previously mentioned great smallie and NP though. Not a musky guy but I understand its good waters. Lots of protected areas too.
1516824,lassh,2012-12-26 08:11:00,553,"Shoal lake is a very good pike and smallmouth lake. It is a walleye sanctuary, so you are not allowed to fish for them although we did catch a couple large walleyes while fishing for pike. Live minnow fishing is not allowed. Shoal Lake Lodge is the best place to stay if you want to avoid the torturous path from LOW. The Kobelka brothers are great hosts. Check with them early as I think they fill up. Be very careful navigating Shoal; its called Shoal Lake for a reason. Shoals/reefs are spread throughout the lake, and most of the lake is uncharted."
1516827,lassh,2012-12-26 08:20:00,553,"I forgot to mention the musky fishing. There are some musky in Shoal, but it is predominantly a large pike fishery. If your main target is musky, you would probably be better off up on LOW. However the pike on Shoal are big, fat, strong fish and you are likely to catch multiple respectable pike."
1516888,jkonop,2012-12-26 11:20:00,544,"So is it just a no minnow rule? I have heard of a local guide that uses leeches jigging for bass, so are leaches legal, and just not minnows?"

1517022,stillangling,2012-12-26 18:55:00,149,"Surprised by your reference to fishing crappies in the winter on Shoal. I have spent a reasonable amount of time trying with very limited success. Open water has been more kind to me but it is a puzzel in the winter and I am not alone in this observation. Whitefish for sure but that fishery has declined significantly in the last 5 yrs or so. Hard to describe how good it was when it peaked... Not quite sure what LASSH is referring to when he mentions the ""treacherous"" run from LOW and the need to stay at Shoal Lake Lodge??? It is all charted waters from LOW, through Ash Rapids and the Labrynth to the main body of Shoal (that isn't charted)."
1517114,lassh,2012-12-27 08:32:00,553,Treacherous was not the right word. It will just take a little more time to get down into Shoal. And it is charted on that part of the lake.
