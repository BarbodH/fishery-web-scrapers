1516066,theeyeshaveit,2012-12-23 06:18:00,15,No increase at my place on Ara Lake....but they did say that 2013 is their last season and they will be list the camp in the fall.
1516567,Glenman12,2012-12-24 20:34:00,762,"our lodge owner on Cedar Lake, after holding down rates for years has increased to $30 for the week..thats $5 a day..when you take into account what a trip costs in total, thats peanuts.."
1514676,onetimedave,2012-12-18 15:39:00,502,My outfitter (AWO) just advised me that his rates for 2013 would not change. They have not changed rates for the past several years. Good times still available.
1514681,GOBIG,2012-12-18 15:45:00,126,Remi runs a CLASS A operation. Melchett is a great lake. Glad to see this.
1514720,zeebee,2012-12-18 17:35:00,1144,I googled AWO and came up with ....Afghan Women's Organization...?
1514730,Fishoil,2012-12-18 17:49:00,1277,Try here:http://awonakina.com/
1514734,zeebee,2012-12-18 17:57:00,1144,much better...thanks... those are wallet friendly rates for sure. I have hunted the area north of Nipigon in the past outta Armstong tho. Great country.
1514779,vteye,2012-12-18 20:02:00,812,"Appreciate the AWO update, we are looking forward to the first trip to Nakina and hope to meet you at the dock."
1515293,onetimedave,2012-12-20 11:13:00,502,"I used AWO instead of Arctic Watershed Outposts because in the past I was called on the carpet for promoting Arctic Watershed Outposts. I replied I was just posting info I thought would be of interest to fly in fisherman. Again I have much info on their lakes, just ask. Web is www.awonakina.com."
1515295,TIGHTLINER,2012-12-20 11:22:00,223,AWO. owned by chris and remi have a great outfitting business. Been to his camps twice and both times they were clean plenty of firewood boats and motors were in great shape. Plenty of fuel and most of all some of the best fishing i have ever had in 27 years of going to canada fishing.
1515486,wallydave,2012-12-20 19:25:00,2151,Goose Bay's rates are staying the same for 2013. I bet most places are holding the rates down. Not as many groups fishing up North like there used to be. AWO sure looks tempting... one more for the bucket list eh!
1515943,Mara5,2012-12-22 14:49:00,209,Pickeral Arm has raised their rates!
