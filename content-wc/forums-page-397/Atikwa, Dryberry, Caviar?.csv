1256871,Skywagon,2010-12-21 05:34:00,1106,What way would you be coming in from? Snow machine?
1256954,lakerbreaker,2010-12-21 09:57:00,253,"We would be on snowmobiles and coming in from Crow. According to my topo software it looks like a route from the West end of Rowan and up through Overflow Lake could work. Also looks like a possible route through Cedar Tree, Flint, Caviar and up through Waterfall? Anyone been back in that area in winter? Will be up there for trout opener and would like to hit some new water away from the crowds..."
1256990,absolut_zero273,2010-12-21 11:55:00,9,"I've always wanted to ice fish Atikwa, but never had the chance. I have spent A LOT of time there during the spring, summer, and fall (worked as a guide for 8 years) so I might be of some help. Your best bet to get in would be the logging road that runs along the south side of the lake. If you can get to that road then there is a small rough road that goes to the old gold mine in Head Bay (SW end of the lake near waterfall). Google maps actually vaguely shows the road and mine on the map. That will run you right up to the lake and the small camp there. You will likely have a fair amount of trouble getting in from overflow as its got a pretty steep hill to get over (as does much of the lake). If you want to come in from that side you would be better off coming in from further east at rainmaker and no name lakes to fourleg bay. If you've never fished Atikwa it truly is one of the best Lake Trout fisheries anywhere particularly for numbers. I have had many many 100+ fish days during the spring and summer (even july and august). Most of the fish are 4-12 lbs, but there are some monsters in there. I worked with the MNR doing lake studies on Atikwa and many of the smaller nearby lakes and they said the trout population is 3-4 times more abundant than pretty much any other lake they have studied. Fishing wise most of my favorite trout spots are more on the north end of the lake, but I bet the big rock pile in the middle of overflow bay would be a great spot to try. It will be easy to spot as it comes out of the water. The south edge of it drops off into deep water. The shallows should be great for pike as its a pretty big area (at least its a great place during the summer and will hold food year round). I know the narrows right at Atikwa Lake Lodge is one of the best spots for trout year round. It comes up to about 40 ft and is a soft bottom until it drops off to the north. It stays around 35 ft or so for most of the south side of the narrow. Many big trout have come out of this area in the early spring (35+ lbs off the shore/dock of camp). I have been told it is a fantastic spot to ice fish as well. I do have my old contour maps of the lake still so if you don't have one yet let me know and I can scan it or mail one to you. If you have any other questions I would be happy to help out any way I can."
1256993,Skywagon,2010-12-21 12:27:00,1106,"I dug my maps out and it looks like the easiest way might be to go to Sioux Narrows and jump on the snowmobile trail that goes east across the lake. This trail goes over Caviar and splits off at Denmark Lake, where you can go north to Atikwa and on to Dryberry if you choose. The three lakes you mentioned are on the west edge of where I normally venture and have only been on Dryberry once in the summer and flew into Antikwa once on skis, trout fishing. You probably won't have to worry about the crowds, as it is rare see many out on the trout lakes. Do be careful when running the lakes, especially the narrows where there may be some current. You will have fun trout fishing through the ice, it is right up there with walleye in my book. Steve"
1256996,lakerbreaker,2010-12-21 12:43:00,253,I think those trail permits are around $100 bucks for a 3 dayer so that's not an option for us...Thanks for all the help from everyone...absolutezero sent you a pm...thanks a ton...Is it January yet? We are veteran trout anglers just looking to try some new water...
1257004,v-bay gord,2010-12-21 13:47:00,3168,"Lakerbreaker......I've fished Atikwa but have accessed it off of Eagle (Muskeg Bay), on to logging roads and then through 3 or 4 small lakes and then on to Long Bay (?) on Atikwa. I have also been through the Waterfall lake route but that did not seem to be used much. I thought I was told that the logging road to the old mine was closed off by the MNR, but I'm not sure of that. I wonder if anyone else has been on the trail between Waterfall lake and the next one (?). There is the remains of a shed that was once a cedar shake enterprise of some sorts. Apparently it was run by an American who was wanted in the US.....and was picked up and deported in Sioux Narrows (he had a younger fellow with him who was left behind at the Waterfall area and had to hoof it over to the old gold mine to get out). When we went through that trail there was equipment still sitting there after quite a few years....a Stihl chain saw and a Yamaha 6 wheeler in the shed. The roof was beginning to cave in but apparently all the stuff was never touched by locals using the trail. One word of caution......the area of Atikwa near the gold mine and waterfall lake has a number of narrows with thin ice or even open water in spots......"
1257243,lakerbreaker,2010-12-22 14:49:00,253,"v-bay gord-thanks for the heads up on the narrows advice, I know those areas up there all have flow and narrows are generally open in early January. The Waterfall lake route you took was mostly over the lake and rivers of that path or was a lot of it through the woods? I guess we will be going pretty much blind as no one really seems to know too much about that route. Even the owners of the resort we stay aren't real helpful in ventures off the beaten path. Any other advice is more than welcome."
1257246,lakerbreaker,2010-12-22 14:52:00,253,"absolut_zero273, I would be very interested in hearing about the maps you have...and also any areas to target....you can send me an email if that's easier.... [email protected]"
1257425,v-bay gord,2010-12-23 11:09:00,3168,"absolute.......my recollection of being in Waterfall Lake was getting there off the logging road. We had come into Atikwa from Eagle Lake and had exited through the old gold mine, on to the logging road, and then off onto Waterfall. I would say there is no access directly from Waterfall to Atikwa by snomo trail. Add to that all the open water around the water fall, it might be dicey as well. We went through Waterfall and onto a trail that went to Empire Lake. It was on that trail that the shack with the equipment (cedar shake guy) was located. From Empire I can't remember if we continued on somehow through Fischer and Stout lakes onto Hawkcliff and then back onto Eagle. It is possible the logging road (if not plowed) would be the quickest route to get to Atikwa.......but then the gold mine could be locked up. I think a call to the local MNR office would be a start to finding out some of these questions."
1257879,absolut_zero273,2010-12-27 08:12:00,9,Here are a couple photobucket links to the map. It's in 2 halves so you will have to put it back together. Take a look at it and let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss things further. http://s1115.photobucket.com/albums/...rent%3DTop.jpghttp://s1115.photobucket.com/albums/...nt%3DTop-1.jpg
1514802,lakerbreaker,2012-12-18 21:11:00,253,"We were unable to make it into Atikwa last year as the area had next to no ice and even less snow...Might try it this year, anyone have anything to add to this?"
1514868,lowgator,2012-12-19 06:43:00,6,"your best bet would be to go across Crow Lake up through Cameron into Rowan and Take the portage on the NW corner of Rowan. With regards to the logging roads don't get caught by the wardens, fines are quite large. They are closed loging roads so access is only granted by obtaining a permit from MNR. One of the above posts brought up some of the narrows on Atikwa which is a good point, you don't want to go swimming. Crow has been froze for around 10 days but still a little sketchy. not sure if opener will be an option. Good luck will let you know when we get out there and check ice."
1515034,lakerbreaker,2012-12-19 14:05:00,253,"I have been into Rowan before through the Cameron portage, my maps don't show a portage trail out of the NW end of Rowan-Do you know which bay it heads North from? I have all the garmin canadian topo software and the Lowrance Rainy/LOTW chip on my dash mounted Lowrance 522 which shows fairly good detail. Don't want to get in there and be stuck on Rowan or lose the whole day trying to find a route. Have you traveled into Atikwa on that route before?"
1257413,absolut_zero273,2010-12-23 09:55:00,9,"Sorry for the delay getting back to you, we are in the process of moving the first week in Jan. and going out of town for the weekend. I will try to hunt down the maps on Monday and email you. If I don't get back to you on Monday email and remind me at [email protected]. I can even give you my phone number and we can chat about spots once you get the map. I will second v-bay gords warning about the narrows, especially the one leaving head bay to the north. That one will likely have a couple rocks above the water/ice that may be covered by snow so take that one extra carefully. It's been nearly 10 years since I have been up there, but the mine road always had a locked gate and only a couple people had access to it. The last couple years I was there the road was in really rough shape and actually washed out in a few spots. We tried keeping it maintained, but some of the washes got bigger than a couple guys with shovels could repair. At this point I would say the road is impossible to travel by truck and likely closed for safety reasons unless someone came in with heavy equipment to repair it. Even with a good 4wd truck and offroad tires we had difficulty traveling the road when it was in it's best shape. Much of the road is made out of the rock they blasted out of the mine so it is made up of large and very sharp rocks. We used to average one blown tire each way on that road and it was an all day adventure to get to sioux narrows for just an hour or two. That said I would bet you could still get a snowmobile around the gate and down the road without too much trouble if you can't get through at waterfall. v-bay gord - do you remember where the snowmobile trail from waterfall to atikwa started? Was it just to the left of the waterfall? That is where the foot trail is at. I know that there is a very steep slippery hill going up along side the waterfall that a snowmobile would likely have trouble getting up. By the way just under that waterfall is some fantastic walleye fishing during the summer. We used to wade fish from shore in the evenings and have a blast. Several 8 to 10 lb walleye have been landed there."
