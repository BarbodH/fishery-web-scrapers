The fishing is quite good, many days with 60-70 fish in a boat, 2 people. People talk of 100 fish days a s if they happen all the time on different lakes, that is quite a bite have done it doesn't happen that often. The equipment is well kept, have yet to be in a boat that leaks. You can fish 15 different lakes, so you have many choices. Cabins are clean and kept in good repair. Any specific questions feel free to PM me.wmd"

He went above and beyond to put us on fish. He gave us numerous spots everyday when we left the dock. Some were great numbers and others were for bigger fish. He called every spot perfectly. He even gave us jigging guys a spot where we could cast for bigger walleyes. He also gave us a hidden spot. We navigated a large patch of tall reeds that led us to a very narrow opening of a small shoot. We only caught two fish there, but both were 26"" The portages were fun, scenic and resonable to get to.With 15 lakes there is lots of water with few fisherman, no real issue with having to compete for spots. We also had meals provided two nights. Very good food and great hospitality in the dining hall. Very professional camp, run by a very nice family and staff."
