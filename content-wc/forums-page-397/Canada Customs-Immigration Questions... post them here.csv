1182984,jimirjr,2010-03-28 08:59:00,1149,"Yeah, it was UNREAL! I believe one of the ""bosses"" was present when we were checked. Thay tore us apart and made us unpack suitcases, coolers, packs and groceries. I tried to take a pic of the mess laying on the ground and the female officer was gonna confiscate my camera! She told me ""NO PICTURES"" Then I asked for help to repack it all and was strongly told to forget it.... then taken inside the building (Rainy River/Ft. Francis) and waited about 15 minutes while they did a background check... then fined. Thank GOD I'm clean! Anyhow, I've been to Mexico twice since then, and our customs guys told me I had a ""check"" by my name signalling to them to take extra precaution with me.... HUH? For a twelve pack? Oh well, I'll try it again this Fall for LOW houseboat trip, hope it goes smoother!"
1183151,JinxCanada,2010-03-28 16:42:00,1306,any valid passport from the USA is fine

1183155,JinxCanada,2010-03-28 16:44:00,1306,"people are ""criminally inadmissible"" IF they have been convicted of a crime in another country that if committed in Canada could have been charged as an indictable offense such offenses include but not limited to:DUI, theft, assault, fraud etc."
1183156,JinxCanada,2010-03-28 16:45:00,1306,"should be fine, however, you should probably bring them in empty and fill in Canada...you may need a transport for dangerous goods...however doubtful. you should be fine"
1183177,joeman79,2010-03-28 17:33:00,417,"I bought a cheap pack of Cuban Cigars on the way to Lac Seul last summer. They were horrible, I threw them in my tote with my fishing gear second day of trip. Came back thru Baudette and a young American Customs guy searched tote and found them lying right on top. I just laughed at my absent mindness. 45 minutes later after filling out 2 forms and watching them destroy cigars, I was allowed to return to the USA. So guess maybe I am on the smugglers list also. Seems like 1 out of 3 times I cross I seem to be searched. Oh well its still worth it."
1183251,CowDoc75,2010-03-28 20:33:00,8,Is it OK to haul a boat on top of your truck? Planning on putting a flat bottom on a rack over the top of the truck and then pulling another boat. What do you think?
1183254,cbprov,2010-03-28 20:39:00,1010,"If you are from Canada and going into the USA what shows up on the USA customs computors about us canadians when they punch you in at the border , just curios do fines, charges, convictions etc show up ,are the canada/ US customs computors linked ,thanks always curios what they are looking at when you cross"

1183306,TIGHTLINER,2010-03-29 06:14:00,223,Several years ago we had stopped at the duty free and purchased our spirits for the trip into canada. We were all legal and purchased only what we were allowed to take in to the country. I had pulled up to the window and while answering the questions they had ask if we had anything to claim. At that i told them that the pickup truck traveling behind us was also with us as we were traveling together and we had all the spirits purchased at the duty free with us because of room and for fear of getting anything broken going into camp. We were ask to pull over to be checked. Several customs agents came out and said this is going to be a long ordeal with that one of them jumped up into the truck and started to rip the tape from the totes we had pulling things apart and leaving them lay. This person was 6 ft 5 in probably 280 lbs and he walked over and stepped on anything that he could crushing two of the tackle boxes. When he got done i ask him what he was looking for and he said the spirits. I had it inside the truck. Needless to say we were told we had to pay the duty on the extra spirits because we were over what we could legally take into the country. This agent was very rude and could be seen with the others laughing at the way he did what he did to the items in the truck. We were honest and up front with them on everything and to have something like this happen puts a sour taste in ones mouth for going into canada on a fishing trip. Been going there for almost 30 times and have never had anything like this happen before.

1181882,phishfearme,2010-03-25 10:55:00,1242,"hey jinx - thanks for this!! you're another reason this board is so valuable. how about some pointers on ""one group travel in two vehicles"". specifically about one vehicle being a hugh land yacht which carries everything (food, tackle, personal gear, etc.) and the other is a subcompact carrying two guys and minimal stuff. i know that we're going to keep our duty free booze with each traveler but does customs strictly require any other ""splits""? thanks again, phish"

1182910,Guest,2010-03-27 21:59:00,0,Which record(s) do they check for criminal history? Are you only barred from entry if you have a conviction or arrest? What if you were charged with a crime but never arrested or convicted?
1182925,81Saluki,2010-03-28 03:56:00,97,"Smuggler list? Wow, that's a new one to me.I know someone who didn't declare an extra case of wine a couple of years ago and ""got caught"". He had to pay the extra duty but didn't get fined (at least that's his story). He got searched again during his next trip despite declaring everything and was clean. He now declares *everything* (alcohol, gifts, bait, whatever) and his vehicle/boat hasn't been searched since.Sounds like if a person has a history of trying to bring something across the border without declaring it then ...[A] if you aren't declaring anything this trip, your chances of being searched again are high.[B] if you declare excess stuff, you will probably (but not always) have to go inside to pay the duty but your chances of being searched are lower.Just an anecdotal observation. FWIW ... Searches are no fun!! And it's always quicker/easier to go inside and pay extra duty than it is to be searched!Also, on the flip side, me and 3 buddies got searched *coming back into the USA* one year -- pre-9/11. Although we probably didn't look like it after spending a week in the bush, we were all mid/upper managers of a good company. Don't know what we said or did to warrant the action, but it was intimidating â€¦ not only did my vehicle get thoroughly searched, but they took us inside for a lengthy personal check. One of my buddies had a money clip with an itty-bitty little pen knife in it and they confiscated it. Go figure. We ultimately got through OK, but it was an experience I don't want to repeat. Just wish I knew what we did wrong to warrant the attention/action. NOTE: On the positive side, we've been back several times since without incident either way.81Saluki"
