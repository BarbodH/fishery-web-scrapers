1516810,Guest,2012-12-26 07:08:00,0,"I agree that angler numbers are shrinking, but so are the amount of resorts. Both are due in some parts to the aging population. Also, many resorts are gearing their traditionally slower fall periods to the now booming fall deer hunt for resident and non-resident hunters which just ten years ago wasn't there. So it's not all doom and gloom."
1516829,zeebee,2012-12-26 08:25:00,1144,"I had tried searching the change in resort #'s over the same period but couldn't find meaningful stats nevertheless, a 42% drop in non-resident licences over a 10 year period has to be devastating. Deer hunting wont come close to filling the void and is a non factor for fly-ins. Can only think that those lodges that carried little or no debt might make it while others shutter up. Interesting to see what the future holds. The report has some interesting reading with respect to demographics and implications for fishing quality, the latter which is expected to improve with less pressure and more catch 'n release, other factors considered."
1516845,Lazy Fisherman,2012-12-26 09:28:00,276,The 2 resorts in Canada that we go to have both said they have had in increase in Canadians using there resort along with a decline of Americans. Both said they are still staying rather full.
1516847,MrSimon,2012-12-26 09:29:00,922,"That is an incredibly interesting article. Thanks for posting! Some of the stats that jumped out at me are: Fishing Pressure (measured in number of days on the water) Canadians 93.5% Foreign 6.5% Total Fish Caught Canadians 81.9% Foreign 18.1% Total Fish Harvested Canadians 91.7% Foreign 8.3% I hadn't really thought about it before, but it makes complete sense that Canadian residents make up the lion's share of people fishing for, catching, and keeping fish. We often think that U.S. fisherman have a big impact on the fishery, but compared to the locals, its relatively minor. I also found it fascinating that $2.5 billion gets spent every year on recreational fishing in Canada. The article goes out of its way to NOT give the breakdown of cost between Canadians and Foreign fishermen. But based on the enormous amounts allocated to transportation, lodging, food, and package deals, its reasonable to assume foreign fishermen account for somewhere between 50% and 80% of the total expenditures. You can draw your own conclusions from the data, but it helps me realize that, as a U.S. resident, I'm truly a guest being allowed to fish in someone else's honey hole .... although I am paying a premium for it. I'm totally fine with that and apparently so are half a million other Americans."
1516859,plumberjoe,2012-12-26 09:51:00,54,As far as the booming deer hunting I have been hunting up there for 6 years now and it seemed to peak 3 years ago. This year I was in Vermillion Bay area for 12 days and never ran into another hunter in the areas we hunt. Other years other hunters were common. Also talked to a warden while we were there and he said the same thing not as many hunters. The place we stay at said they had alot of locals coming for long weekends this summer which means the same of amount of work for less money. I hope it turns around for them the bright side for those of that do go is the hunting and fishing seems to be getting better each year.
1517527,muskiemamma,2012-12-28 17:03:00,6,We seem to be doing okay but a deer hunt or being able to get in the lottery for moose tags would sure help us out too. Thank goodness for the great fishing at our lodge or we would have problems too.
1517593,Skywagon,2012-12-29 06:03:00,1106,"Moose populations are down, we need less tags issued, not more, to stop this trend. As you said, a lake with great fishing and a lodge that takes care of it's people is key, the cream will rise to the top. The lodges that don't have what it takes to make a financial go of it will probably be bought up for personal use."
1517595,Munshaw,2012-12-29 06:21:00,279,"While Americans certainly pay more than Canadians per day of fishing, I doubt it's that much. I'm looking at approx. $200 a day to go fishing locally including transportation, bait etc. I fished a lot last summer. Also paid for a trailer rental spot. I bet I'm in $6,000 for last summer. So yes per trip we pay less but most of us fish very frequently and it adds up. We certainly appreciate the business, but unless you get away from the lodge areas where you will pretty much only see Americans, you won't see the vast majority of fisherman are locals. My lake has several lodges and thus 90% of boats are U.S. (Lac des Mille Lacs) Canadians also do in-country trips. I did a west coast steelhead trip that wasn't cheap..."
1517809,zeebee,2012-12-30 00:30:00,1144,"In the immortal words of an outfitter... ""never have so few (lodge owners)... been so indebted to the dwindling (americans) ...for so much (tourist $)""."
