1513045,keek,2012-12-14 06:07:00,1003,Class move - Great job Pooch
1513061,Mike Kansas,2012-12-14 07:27:00,1463,"I remember my first trip to Canada in 1955. My dad and I and two others went. Dad took $150 with him for the two of us and brought money home. Wood ribbed boats, 5hp motors (our own) and steel rods with Langly casting reels an black dacron line. Spent most of our time trolling spoons for pike bobber fishing walleye with minnows. Must have been fun because I have been back to Canada about 90 times. Mike Kansas"
1513073,lcwhit,2012-12-14 08:00:00,104,in 1955 the minimum wage was 75 cents per hour. 150 dollars then was worth 1289 dollars today.
1513083,Mike Kansas,2012-12-14 08:36:00,1463,Good Point
1513103,HeHooksHimself,2012-12-14 09:27:00,725,Wages might have been lower but dollar was worth something. Gas was 25 cents a gallon unless there was a gas war when you could buy it for 18 cents. Furthermore the CDN $ was worth at best 2/3 of an American $. Those were the days!
1513139,Golden Eagle,2012-12-14 11:45:00,2642,Dollars were huge back then. Could wallpaper a large livingroom with 2 or 3 of them.
1513151,Nimstug,2012-12-14 12:34:00,2605,Dave - do you have a scanner (and some time)? If so how about posting some pages in your album?
1513444,wallydave,2012-12-15 09:09:00,2151,"Sorry guys no scanner at my house! I'll try to take some pics, if they turn out I'll add them to my albums!"
1512682,wallydave,2012-12-12 19:38:00,2151,That's why Walleye Central is a wonderful site! Pooch sent me a ebay link for a Goose Bay Camp brochure from the 50s! It came in the mail today. Its in near perfect shape. Andreas mom died in November after a long illness. The brochure dates to when her mom owned and operated the camp. I plan on giving Andrea the brochure next June! Thanks Gary!
1512685,zeebee,2012-12-12 19:44:00,1144,cool
1512698,JDP,2012-12-12 21:01:00,1457,What were the rates in the brochure from the '50s?
1512700,zeebee,2012-12-12 21:10:00,1144,.....and how big were the fish?and...mono or braid?

1512707,Pikeslayer8,2012-12-12 21:31:00,1460,What a thoughtful gesture. By both of ya. Sniff
1512710,wallydave,2012-12-12 21:34:00,2151,"The rates include the option of a wood or aluminum boat, cabins with or without a shower! Lets just say the daily rate now would cover a week back then!"
1512981,wallydave,2012-12-13 18:57:00,2151,"Here are the prices from the 50's at Goose Bay! A cabin for two, $35 a week! Boat options, 16ft wooden $4 a day. 14ft aluminum $4 a day. The top of the line 16ft aluminum $5 a day. Motors went for 10,18and 35 horse went for 4,5 and $7 a day! Wow!! Since I wasn't even alive yet I guess I didn't miss the good old days!?"
1513019,JDP,2012-12-13 21:26:00,1457,Thanks WallyDave that is unbelieveable.On a side note...Onaway Lodge was using wood boats until the late 1990's or so.
1513020,bobo4030,2012-12-13 21:31:00,235,Pooch for president!
