Does anyone sell an electronic chart/map for Perrault Lake? I believe that LakeMaster and Navionics do not. Is there a Canadian company selling such maps? I use a Humminbird gps/sonar unit that I have set up to be portable. Many thanks in advance."

1512732,BornToFish,2012-12-13 06:20:00,1224,"I am told there is a Perrault Falls at the far north end of Perrault Lake. I haven't been to it, but know several folks that have been there. I'm led to believe that it's not a visually impressive type of waterfall. Perrault Falls must be about 45-50 miles north of Vermillion Bay and about 15 miles or so south of Ear Falls. Perrault Falls is on the west side of Highway 105, not too far off the highway. I've never looked on a map, but suspect that Perrault Lake must empty into Wabaskang Lake, and eventually into the English River system.Thanks for the offer. Happy Holidays to you and your family. Regards...."

Just looked at the paper map - Vermillion Bay is approx 36 miles from the P Falls.Looks like a nice lake - had a cousin who fished all thru that area and loved it - except for the mosquito's.......lol (never heard about the size of the fish - just the size of the bugs....)If you want a copy let me know.All the Best to you an yours during the Holiday Season,bobby"
