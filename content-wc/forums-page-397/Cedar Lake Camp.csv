1515721,zman8701,2012-12-21 15:07:00,100,Anyone have additional info regarding the sale of the camp?
1515785,Glenman12,2012-12-21 19:01:00,762,I know this is no help but I just emailed our lodge owner on Cedar and he said that was the first he heard about it..
1515842,teddi,2012-12-22 04:38:00,349,check austin and austin in dryden. listing c428. SOLD.
1515867,lonewolf73,2012-12-22 07:14:00,17,"We just received the year end letter from Jerry and Ellie and it confirms that they have sold the camp to a young family from North Freedom, WI. The name of the new owners is Darren and Merrilee Bochler. I was very surprised by the letter as I didn't know they were even considering selling the camp. I wish the new owners well in their new investment. It will be strange seeing new owners this year when we drive up the first week of June especially since the all of our 12 years on Cedar have been with Jerry & Ellie."

They stated they will be vacationing there themselves several weeks this upcoming year. I wish them well as they were great hosts and ran a wonderful Camp. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
