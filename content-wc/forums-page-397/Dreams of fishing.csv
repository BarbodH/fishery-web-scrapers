1516893,Guest,2012-12-26 11:45:00,0,Does anyone else have dreams of their fishing trip to Canada. I have a recurring dream(nightmare) fairly often. I had it 2 nights in a row this week. I'll be in Ontario for our annual trip and suddenly it's the last day of the trip and I haven't done any fishing yet. I am really frustrated and try like heck to fish that last day but before I get any fishing done I wake up. How rotten is that? I bet I have had this dream 15 times
1516896,tackleman,2012-12-26 12:02:00,444,"I dream of fishing all the time, lots of times I get a big fish then when it gets near the boat, the line breaks or sometimes the others with me are getting all the fish and i'm not getting a nibble.don't know if these should be classified as dreams or nightmares."
1516908,Bill Krejca,2012-12-26 12:30:00,6107,"I thought it was normal to have reoccurring and/or often dreams of fishing and the north country. Anyone NOT have them? I just figured this was what happened when sleeping, kinda like breathing. Bill"
1516922,camp chef,2012-12-26 13:05:00,915,"The only times that I don't dream about being in Canada is when I actually am in Canada,"
1516923,Lovetofish,2012-12-26 13:07:00,458,Does day dreaming count? I'm guilty.
1516952,wallydave,2012-12-26 14:35:00,2151,"Amen! I am always thinking about the hope and expectation of a great day on the water!! The coolness of the dawn sky as the sun rises, the brisk fresh air, the sound of the bow as it cuts through the still early monring water! Oh yea!"

1517007,Pooch,2012-12-26 17:38:00,4619,"Nearly the same dream about the trip being about over and we've been wasting time and have yet to get on the water. I think it is because most in our group are up and at it early nearly every day. We make an effort to not waste valuable time on the water.Years ago we made one of our annual trips a long one of fifteen days on the water. That way as we get tired we can relax and not be ""hammer down"" every minute like a shorter trip. We are slowing down as our group ages.Also used to dream that we were on a fly-in and I forgot my reels and or poles. Once in a while I didn't have line on my reels or forgot the depth finder.Guess I'm not the only weird one.Pooch"
1517021,wallydave,2012-12-26 18:53:00,2151,"Z I feel your pain!! June 15th is a loong wait, thats when I hit the water!! Forgive me, waxing on helps me process the long winter wait!!"
1517025,Pikeslayer8,2012-12-26 19:31:00,1460,"My problem is getting to sleep, especially the closer my trip gets. I'd bet I'm not alone here. Like others, I was taught to count sheep to fall asleep. I used to picture a giant herd of fluffy white sheep in a green pasture and slowly, one by one, they would gently hop over (yawn) a little brown (yawn) split rail fence and I would proceed to count them 1...2...3 till.............................................. ................ Sorry, must have dozed off there for a minute. As I was saying, the sheep thing was working fairly well but could be improved. That's when I came up with the brilliant idea of counting walleye. Yup, I'd imagine myself fishin in one of my favorite fishin holes. I like to start out catchin 2 pounders for a while, mentally catchin roughly about 3 or 4 hundred or so, then I'd move up to 3 pounders and catch another 3 or 4 hundred, then 4 pounders, 5 pounders, and so on and so forth till I'm mentally catchin some world class 10-12 pounders. Man, I'm tellin ya that this works great, after just 6 or 7 hours I'm sleepin like a baby"
