1513290,downriverbob,2012-12-14 20:19:00,880,"D, Here is an article about Robert Horley Sr., Peter's father: http://www.anglingmasters.com/index....9&eve=7&id=706. If you have any other questions feel free to contact me. My wife and I are going to fish with Peter this winter, try to catch a monster laker ! BOB"
1517399,DMella,2012-12-28 09:14:00,32,Thanks for the link BobThe kids and I read it and we are fired up to meet the family and learn a bit as well. We are considering splurging and hiring Pete to guide for a day as a learning experience.Have a happy new yearDan
1517551,downriverbob,2012-12-28 18:44:00,880,"Dan, Peter will work his butt off for you, he can show you a lot of areas that he knows hold fish. He as does a great shore lunch, he is great with kids. BOB"
1508764,DMella,2012-11-30 14:25:00,32,We are heading to LOW camping in Whitefish bay near Timber Is. the last two weeks of June. Does anyone have experience with the fishing (walleye-pike-muskie) at that time of the year in that section of the lake? We have mainly fished from Red Cliff bay to Mouse Is. in the northern part of the lake and we can boat up there if it is best but would like to the the southern section of whitefish bay a chance. Thank you
1508941,djk50164,2012-12-01 05:04:00,370,"Yes those fish are present in whitefish and can be caught, but because of the clear water in whitefish sunny days make it tough to catch walleyes during the mid day. If you are lucky and find a group of bitting walleyes there size will probably run larger then the northern part of the lake. I would talk to your camp owner for some areas that have been producing while you are there. Also fish the overcast days there and head for stained water on those clear and sunny days."
1508954,Bill Krejca,2012-12-01 06:50:00,6107,"D - I assume you will be camping at a resort, or will be with a resident. Non residents are not permitted to camp out on the lake in the Whitefish Bay area. Re: walleye fishing - go as far south as you can in Whitefish for maybe productive walleye fishing, trying not as clear water areas. Also, you might try quietly trolling the beaches/shallow water areas after dark. Use long lined Rapalas, or similar minnow shaped lures. Some gigantic walleyes have been taken using this method. Take bug dope with. Bill Krejca"
1509020,fishanytime,2012-12-01 11:21:00,63,You can also try Snake Bay along weed edges using crawlers or trolling small plugs.
1509055,DMella,2012-12-01 14:13:00,32,Bill we are staying at Sanctuary resort - they have One rustic camp site. It is just north of Tinned island. We a have caught some big walleye during the day trolling deep diving cranks around the entry of knickerbocker and ghost inlet. I love the idea of night trolling for the big girls. How about pike and Lakers in whitefish the last week of June?
1509197,Bill Krejca,2012-12-02 08:14:00,6107,"Re:camping - OK. I'd try going deep for both fish. Depends on water temp/weather for the trout, 51 degrees is a kind of accepted standard for their comfort zone. Pike can be anywhere, but many folks feel they too, like cooler water, I wouldn't be surprised to get both while trout fishing.Re: trout - Many folks like to dead bait for them by sitting on an island adjacent to deep water. I'd ask around about this - it is a fun way to catch them, but can be slow at times.Let us know how you do when you return.Thanks,Bill"

1510868,downriverbob,2012-12-06 18:15:00,880,"I have been going to Sanctuary Resort for the past 15 plus years, very rustic resort but you are not going to meet more nice people than Carol and Peter Horley. We mainly fish for musky, but have done well on pike and walleye. The two walleye pictured were caught between two island back by Bell Island. There is great fish structure for all the species you are fishing for in pretty much all the sections of Whitefish Bay. I tend to stay away from the east because it is hit hardest because it is closer to main shore and the majority of the resorts. It is hard to specify locationsthat because you won't know what kind of weather that will occur during the spring. If you hit it right the muskies will still be in their spawing bays, you will than sight fish using large rubber baits. I would also try to pick Peter's brain about locations, he has lived in the area his entire life, his father was probably one of the most knowledgeable musky guides on LOTW. If you have any other questions about fishing the area feel free to contact me. BOB"
1511862,DMella,2012-12-10 08:57:00,32,Nice fish! We are looking forward to seeing what the island looks like and exploring. Thank you for offering to answer questions. What time of the year have you typically been at Sanctuary? Have you ever checked out the camp site? Wondering if it is close to the waters edge or back in the woods. We had some luck vertical jigging for trout last year in later July and are excited to try our luck a little shallower this June.We would love to catch a musky... the family and I spent a couple days last July focusing on them and one day was on the east side of bell back in ghost inlet and we had one going for a while. I will talk with Peter over the winter to learn what I can to give ourselves a better crack at a big toothy critter.Have you ever tried trolling cranks for pike and musky in June?Thanks again for the offerDan
1512055,downriverbob,2012-12-10 20:51:00,880,"We have fished there from late June to late September. The camp site is on the south side of the island, it is slightly wooded but very close to water. It is also close to the dock. It is very quiet place being away from the mainland. That time of the year you are better off fish just out or in the bays for musky, pike will be out a little further out like I said alot will be dependent on the spring weather conditions. Get a good map of the area if you don't have one now, mark areas that you see fish, another suggestion is to get the book, ""Muskies on the Shield"" by Dick Pearson, it as section specific to Whiefish Bay and different times of the year. Again feel free to contact me. BOB"
