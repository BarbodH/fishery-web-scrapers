1509631,Mike Kansas,2012-12-03 12:57:00,1463,We fish the central part of the lake on the north shore. It has become a smallie factory for us during the second week of June. Mike Kansas
1514728,kseye,2012-12-18 17:44:00,7,"Jointed Rapala, suspending rouge. Tear them up in the Cedar Lake area in June."
1515886,Guest,2012-12-22 08:06:00,0,"a 3.5"" tube jig with an 1/8 oz jighead. red/orange/brown in color. it fishes fast, any depth and they really whallop that thing. fish it on a real light rod/line for added challenge"
1508288,Mike Kansas,2012-11-29 08:41:00,1463,"What is your favorite Smallmouth presentation when fishing Canadian waters? We have had our best results with small V spinners, cranks and flipping plastics on 1/8 ounce jigs. We fish Lac Seul and the Smallie population has rapidly grown there in the last 10 years. We are seeing 17"" & 18"" fish on a regular basis and 20"" are not uncommon. Last year we had one that was 22 1/2"" and looked more like a football than a fish. Mike Kansas"
1508305,MrSimon,2012-11-29 09:28:00,922,"We have excellent success with (in no particular order): 1. Silver and blue flat sided rattling crank baits (various brands - trolled). 2. Small orange Little Cleo spoons. 3. Large in-line spinners like Panther Martin and Mepps (Mepps with tails, PM without). 4. Topwater poppers."
1508323,Larry Mac,2012-11-29 10:34:00,530,"Hi Mike Kansas, our favorite presentation is a Slip Bobber and Leech. Mr. Simon Great Pics!!! Thanks for sharingHave a great YearThank you,Larry Mac"
1508332,Steve Ediger,2012-11-29 11:05:00,97,"#3 Mepps with a brass blade or a 1/8 oz wide gap jig head with a 3"" grub."
1508348,10point,2012-11-29 11:51:00,102,Plastic worm here. I have had my best luck using the generic version of senkos which is the bass pro stick o's.
1508369,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-11-29 12:20:00,629,#1. Jointed & Tail Dancer Rapalas trolling.#2. #3 & #4 Red/White Meps with squirrel hair over the treble hook when casting shorelines.
1508404,zeebee,2012-11-29 13:51:00,1144,Many of the lipless cranks esp when the water warms up.......fast and steady retrieve.
1508742,Aaron-IN,2012-11-30 12:49:00,500,If you aren't throwing a whacky rigged Senko you are missing the boat.
1508774,Paul H,2012-11-30 14:48:00,1232,"In no particular order - depends on what works that day. Senko - wacky or nose 1st Power Bait Tube or Grub, Motor Oil, Black , white sometimes chartreuse Small crank - Rebel craw - but if one still has or can find them Bass Magnets, also their is a small crappie plug, maybe cotton Cordell in chrome works well. #2 or 3 Vibrax spinner in Chartreuse - better than Mepps and this crazy color, well it's crazy. Topwater - floating Rapala works better for me than Spooks, Hula Poper or other true top water. Throw a Rap - let sit for 20-30 seconds and just barely move. When I was fishing a lot I did more smallie than walleye, even on the Canada trips I'd always take a day or 2 and fish mainly smallies."
1508890,Knoxabilly,2012-11-30 19:53:00,225,"Mike, what part of Lac Seul do you fish? I fish out of Ear Falls and this year we caught the most we have, got into a nice little school of them. First time caught them cast after cast in 15yrs! They're definitely moving into Lac Seul- prior to this we would average 1 a week."
