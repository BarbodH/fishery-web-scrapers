1306372,Guest,2011-05-13 07:33:00,0,Baudette is closer then Grand Portage. We usually go through there since its only about an hour out of the way.
1304927,MidWestFishman,2011-05-09 21:25:00,44,"I usually cross at Winnipeg since I fish generally in Manitoba but this year I am going fishing around Kenora. I need to go into Wisconsin on the return trip. I am not familiar with these crossing areas being mentioned. Would any of them be better getting back into Wisconsin than Int Falls? I need to get to Rhinelander, Wisc which is 11.5 hours from Kenora before figuring border crossing times."
1304998,camp chef,2011-05-10 06:49:00,915,International falls..Faster by quite a bit.
1305322,guidedfishing,2011-05-10 19:26:00,531,"Midwestfisherman, If you have not been down the North shore then you owe it to yourself to make that trip. Total time wise you will not notice any real difference. The crossing at Grand portage / Pigeon river is simple and fast. Come east on 11/17 just after Kakabeka Falls, take a right to to go thru Stanley route 130 which will cut a fair distance of the trip instead of going into Thunder bay. Take 20 mins to stop at the falls in Kakabeka falls, and then enjoy one of the most beautiful drives in the world coming down the north shore. My assumption of course is you will travel it during daylight hours. good luck and enjoy. GF"
1305335,Larry S,2011-05-10 20:08:00,665,"Since your going to Kenora Area cross at International Falls. It will be faster and the highway from I-Falls to Kenora is fine. I have gone fishing north of Kenora for 30plus years and have always used I-Falls crossing because it's a lot shorter than the Pidgeon River crossing We are going pass Thunder Bay to Armstrong area and will cross at Pidgeon River,but would cross at P-River if we were going to Ignace or Pickle Lake Area"
1305365,MidWestFishman,2011-05-10 21:20:00,44,Thanks for the suggestions. I think I will try that route down through the North Shore. I am taking 3 weeks vacation then so I can take my time and enjoy a scenic ride.
1305368,elway12,2011-05-10 21:27:00,335,You will enjoy the drive its one of the many things my group looks forward to on our way to Canada. The state of MN has a good website to check for road construction also watch for deer if your driving that road at night or early morning there LOTS of them!
1305441,MGretz,2011-05-11 05:53:00,4,"Of course it depends entirely on where you are headed. When we cross the border we are heading for Ignace. My computer tells me it's 10 miles further to cross at Grand Portage, so we didn't do that for many years. Finally tried it one time and have never considered Int. Falls again. The scenic drive, ease of crossing (never waited in a line more than 2 cars long), it's just a whole different laid back vacation type atmosphere. Regarding facilities, Grand Portage has everything you need just on the U.S. side of the border at Rydens or at Grand Portage Casino-Lodge. I don't miss Int. Falls one bit and don't care if I ever go back there. Once waited in a line 5 blocks long at Int. Falls!Going to Kenora though .. hmm .. how many miles more is it? If there's 40+ miles difference, I'd probably bite the bullet and go back to Int. Falls ... with regrets."
1305454,Gary from Iowa,2011-05-11 06:25:00,74,"My brother and traveled along the north shore and to Grand Portage. On the trip north be sure to stop for Betty's pies, and if you can, stay in Grand Marais, MN overnight. Its a busy place in tourist season, so get your reservations early. If your a hands on kind of person and like woodworking or canoe building check our the North House Folk School. (You could do a whole vacation attending some of the classes available.) Good places to eat too-sorry I cann't remember the names. One is a restaurant on the shore of Lake Superior and has ""Trout"" in its name. There is a small bakery along the shore too, that opens very early in the morning. Stop in for a cup of coffee and some good pastry.For more information check this link.http://grandmarais.com/what_to_do/wt...0Folk%20SchoolFYI: I have no financial interest or personal connections to the town. Its just a nice place to spend some time.Gary"
1305527,Spin,2011-05-11 08:48:00,42,"My group goes the North Shore route every year. Once in a while come back through Int' Falls. Last time we when through Int' Falls it looked like they were working on building a 4 lane North of Virginia up to Orr? How far did that make it? And for you conspiracy theorist, its part of the NAFTA Super Highway I always get stuck behind a motor home on the North Shore that is going slower than the posted speed limits, and can't make it up hills. Ussually there is enough traffic you can't pass them either. If there is a four lane to Int' Falls it would be nice."
1305538,LOW1,2011-05-11 09:25:00,2828,"If I remember right, the four lane stops near the south edge of Cook, which is about an hour and fifteen minutes from the border. Unless you stop at Zup's grocery store in Cook for some of the great sausage, brats, smoked turkey, etc, which will cost you 45 minutes and 25 cholesteral points. I wish the 4 lane went to IFalls but I did not see a lot of survey markers, etc which indicated that they were going to be building all the way to the border in the near future. But the road does make the stretch from Cloquet to Cook much faster."
1304514,SteveJ715,2011-05-09 07:27:00,59,"I saw the thread about border wait times and I have a separate but related question. If the drive was roughly the same, would you cross the border at International Falls or Grand Portage? We would be crossing on a Friday.The Grand Portage crossing would be a bit out of the way for us on the way up to Sioux Lookout from Minneapolis, but if the crossing is going to take a lot longer, maybe it's worth it. Think it's worth some extra driving, or would you just stick with I-Falls?Thanks for all the input as always. Less than 2 weeks to wait!- Steve"
1304517,elway12,2011-05-09 07:34:00,335,We have gone thru G.P for the last few years and there has never been a wait. I would have to look up what day of the week we have been thru but it always is mid-morning. We did I.F. years ago and we had to wait 10-15 minutes. I have also heard it can get crowed there at certain times. I just know we have never had even close to a long wait at G.P.
1304547,dutchboy,2011-05-09 08:29:00,5717,I-Falls. You have waited this long a couple more minutes won't matter. Any wait times in the past seem to have been getting back into the United States not getting out.
1304606,JDP,2011-05-09 10:09:00,1457,I would check the distance travelled from let's say Cloquet to your destination using both routes. My opinion would be go through I-Falls. If you are concerned about waiting to cross the border plan your trip for off-peak crossing times.
1304620,Lovetofish,2011-05-09 10:39:00,458,I've gone both ways from Minneapolis up to Sioux Lookout and I fish up by Pickle Lake. All things being equal International Falls is shorter in miles. We cross in Friday about 2 pm and the wait time has not be bad at either crossing. Coming back is a different story. I've been hung up in Fort Frances every time so the last 10 years I've come back through Pigeon River. Don't think I've ever waited more then 10 minutes crossing back in. The roads are easier to travel too. I can run my cruise control a lot of the time. The question for me is how the road construction is in Duluth? That added an hour on my return last summer.
1304624,camp chef,2011-05-09 10:49:00,915,"The beauty of the drive along Minnesota's north shore is worth the extra drive time if you are not in a hurry.I am getting better at not being in a hurry,in fact I am getting pretty darn good at it."
1304787,Tonyo,2011-05-09 16:41:00,212,I know this was not a part of the question but we have been avoiding the International Falls crossing on our way home for the past few years and going through Baudette. On our way up we always go through I.F. because we cross on Friday afternoon and never had to wait longer than 30 minutes. We have avoided the Saturday morning rush by scheduling it this way. It makes our Saturday drive a breeze. TonyO
1304791,guidedfishing,2011-05-09 16:55:00,531,"I-falls, Better road access to the border Shorter distance relative to where you are headed. sometime longer wait sometime less friendly custom agents better facilities relative to the border Pigeon River / Grand Portage Beautiful drive Deer can be a pain at dark Typically get stuck behind a slow mover for miles at a time Not much for amenities near the border wait times usually in mins, or none at all custom agents seem to be more friendly and laid back."
1304800,phishfearme,2011-05-09 17:17:00,1242,pidgeon river is a much nicer drive and no line at the border - and - don't forget the rt 130 shortcut to ignace and points north - it's all paved now and cut numerous miles off going into thunder bay. phish
1304808,wallydave,2011-05-09 17:30:00,2151,"My last trip to Lac Seul, Ear Falls section, we crossed Friday night and stayed in FF. Little to no wait, and a head start on the trip North. I have a room in FF for the Friday of our trip, less than 4 weeks away now!"
