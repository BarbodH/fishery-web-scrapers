My question is if we want to bring 2 or 3 cases per person where would we pay the duty to make this go as smooth as possible? Do you stop in the Duty Free Shop and pay the extra duty there or wait until you get to the Customers Officer? I've been reading the threads I found here but can't tell...it seems as if most people tell the customers officer and have to pull over, and that some people are given a very hard time. We really don't mind paying the extra $10-$12 a case in duty but we don't really want to have to deal with a long wait or get hassled over it.Also, if it's a big hassle to declare it with the Customs Officer would it be possible to bring one case per person and get the rest at Duty Free (but tell them you need to pay duty) and do it that way so that you have all your ducks in a row and everything paid for the Customs Officer?thanks"

Be ready to tell them how many cases of beer and liters of liquor you have. If everything else goes OK they will give you a paper and tell you where to park and to bring the paper inside. Once inside another office will figure the tax/duty you owe and you pay up and your on your way. Maybe 10 minutes from the time you park till your driving away.

Beer purchased there is no different than beer purchased anywhere else, as it pertains to declaring at customs. The only way to avoid having to stop and pay duty is to bring the one case per person you are allowed across the border, and buy any extra in Canada."
1307657,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-16 15:30:00,66,Just tell them you have 30 cases of beer and 7 bottles of liquor and they will give you all the directions you need.
