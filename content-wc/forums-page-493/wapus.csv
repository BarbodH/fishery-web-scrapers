Have had 5 great fly-ins in Pickle Lake area in the past, but trying to find something somewhere closer (eastern Ontario or Western Quebec)to east coast (Wash DC area). Planning on Wapus in June (MacArthur Lake) in what will be first Canada outing for the 3 others in group. Hoping that it will turn out well and become the first of annual trips to somewhere in that general region. Thanx, rappoo"

1262133,chocho1971,2011-01-16 10:46:00,16,Trip started out bad but finished pretty good. Day of arrival checked in drove to cabin walked down to the floating dock and found it to be underwater. Drove back to lodge asked outfitter if they could do anything because my 83 yearold father couldn't get in boat they said they already fixed it. They followed me back and hooked their atv to the dock and drug it up on the beach being it had a axel and tires on the end. Problem solved. Cabin was pretty good if you weren't scared of mice killed 8 that week. Boats and motors were nice no problems. Fishing was tough the first couple of days like always at a new place. Lake was a little high alot of rain the week before. Road into lodge wasn't too bad drove caravan and brand new toyota avalon. Would return but need electric 24 dads now on oxygen. If any other questions be happy to answer. P.S. if was my kids first trip to canada they loved it!
