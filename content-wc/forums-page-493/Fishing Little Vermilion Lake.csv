Two of us arrived Friday afternoon after a 1500 mile drive from Tennessee. Pike fishing has been good and our weather has been better than decent since we arrived. We're going to have hot, sunny days for about a week.Most in camp are fishing with dead bait, but our pike are eating Johnson Silver Minnows and Suicks for us. We're only hitting the water from 10:30 a.m. to around 6:30 p.m. We'll be joined by the rest of our party for the walleye opener and a second week for my partner and me. Then we'll be staying out for the evening walleye bite and having walleye dinners at 11 p.m. Lots of sleep for us this week and not so much during our second week.We're expecting to find huge pike in shallow water this afternoon after the sun warms shallow bays.So far we've boated plenty of pike with none under 35"", but only a few over 40"". Most have come from moving water. Bigger pike should be waiting for us in shallow water beginning today or tomorrow for sure. We'll give them a chance.Life if good up here. Warmer here than in Tennessee today."
