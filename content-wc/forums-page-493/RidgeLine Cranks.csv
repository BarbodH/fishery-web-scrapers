1306897,Guest,2011-05-14 19:49:00,0,I picked up some Ridge line Cranks from Wholesale sports. Going to give them a try. Anyone try these yet they are New but I'm told you can troll them at high speed and the colors seem Good. Once the water slows down and clears a bit. I'm hitting the Water. Any info would be great.
