1305936,JJJ4,2011-05-12 06:36:00,16,"Wow, interesting! That's the latest I've heard on the forums -- seems like everywhere else has reported complete ice out already.Would you say this is ""normal"" ice out for Sturgeon or a little late? Also, how do you think it will affect the fishing depths? We will be there May 28 -- I'm thinking it should be about perfect!"
1306053,Ogoki,2011-05-12 10:21:00,291,"Going on 2 fly-ins . Go to Pickle Lake with some frinds and get back and go to Armstrong with my wife 3 days later . Our report from outfitter at Pickle Lake on Tuesday was that the lake we are going to is still iced over . We go in in 2 weeks and 2 days ,and I feal we should be good by then .At least I hope so . First trip is a fly-in camp out trip. Have not seen anything here about ice out for the Pickle Lake area . Mattice Lake Outfitters said ice should be off Whitewater lake by Saturday . We are going to Ogoki Res. for my wife's and my trip. Have had fantastic fishing there the second week of June when we had a normal to late ice out ."

1307250,Catman59,2011-05-15 18:17:00,345,She's gone. The Lake is ready to fish !!!!!!
1307371,JJJMN,2011-05-16 04:41:00,153,Forecast looks like it will be sunny and in the 70's thru to Sunday. Looks better in Souix Lookout than Kansas City.
1101771,iman63,2009-05-01 14:14:00,91,Anyone have any info on current ice conditions?
1101773,plumberjoe,2009-05-01 14:17:00,54,"Talked to a resort owner on the north end this morning. He said there is 18"" of ice yet. It has started to pull away from shore and there is allot of water on top of the ice. It should make it for the opener."
1103378,JJJMN,2009-05-08 09:10:00,153,Any update. Our group stays at Camp Midgard on the north end of Sturgeon Lake. I've been watching the webcam at Sweet Water Cruises (almost straight west of Sturgeon lake) Looks like Ice there is about gone (camera view anyway). http://www.sweetwatercruises.com/id5.html. Any word on Water level?
1103475,plumberjoe,2009-05-08 14:01:00,54,As of Monday the river from Midguard to the main lake was open but main lake still froze. Water levels are high. I will know more tomorrow.
1303634,JJJ4,2011-05-06 09:58:00,16,"Anyone have an ice out update for Sturgeon Lake? Also, any update on water levels on Sturgeon this year?Thanks,JJJ4"
1304979,JJJ4,2011-05-10 06:24:00,16,bump.How are the water levels on Sturgeon this year?
1305003,JJJMN,2011-05-10 07:01:00,153,"Just got off the phone with Lloyd of Bergman's Camp Midgard (Trappers Point, North End of lake). Some ice on main lake, should be gone in a day or two. Water level about normal, docks aren't under water. Walleyes are still in spawn. Sounds like a average spring up north. I'm pumped. Allways look forward to the opener."
1305030,JJJ4,2011-05-10 08:11:00,16,Thanks for the update! Good luck with your trip.
1305230,Further North,2011-05-10 15:41:00,2008,We'll be up there mid June (starting the 18th) I'll be interested to hear how things are going.
1305905,Catman59,2011-05-12 04:38:00,345,Still ice on the main lake last night .......
