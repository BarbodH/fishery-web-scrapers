Excellent lake for small walleye,buts LOTS, you should be 50-80/guy a day easy. Across from the cabin is good,go out from the cabin and head right ,there is a set of narrows to another part of the lake,those narrows are excellent. all shorelines,especially at end of may,1st of june. Im sure the outfitter will have a good map with hot spots. Pike are everywhere. VERY shallow lake but great fishing. We were hit with mayfly hatch and didnt stop the fishing."
