1125012,riverratrich,2009-07-30 10:31:00,1,"my wife and i have been up to Garden Island on Lady Evelyn Lake and had a great experience. however, I've noticed there are 3 other fishing lodges on this lake- Ellen Island, Red Pine, and Island 10. Just wanted to get some opinions from people who may have stayed at Garden Island along with any others. i know Ellen Island doesn't offer american plan so i wouldn't be interested in that. Garden island has live wells, your fishing license is included, and dogs are welcome and all not true with Island 10. Garden Island is the only lodge on the western arm of the lake. i'm sure all the lodges are nice and from what i can tell are comparable in price. just wanted some opinions before i choose what lodge to stay at for my next trip. thanks"
1125096,micropterus,2009-07-30 14:44:00,450,Great people and food. Dogs are welcome but the jokes are just OK
1125511,adempsey,2009-08-01 00:46:00,963,I stayed at both Garden Island and Island 10. They are both good places. Some minor differences that you would likely have to experience in order to really decide which one you like better.I'd just book whichever has availability and the best price.

1223590,SkeeterJeff,2010-07-29 20:35:00,31,"Just got back from a week on Garden Island. I have never stayed at any of the other camps. Eight years in a row for us at GI. I can't imagine any better accomodations, food, and service. And we are on the main lake. I saw lots of Island 10 boats making the 5 mile trip throgh the narrows to get to the main lake. Guess where the best fishing is? :-) We are registered for the third week in July again in 2011, and may take a second trip there in late August or early September. -Jeff"
1223654,micropterus,2010-07-30 06:17:00,450,The addition of Michael completes a very good staff. Good eats Fish are getting bigger every year.
1306669,speckeye,2011-05-14 06:07:00,61,"I'm hitting Lady Evelyn from Garden Island again this summer(last week of July).After last spring's big fish trip in May,I'm psyched for some serious walleye jigging,but also wish to tempt some smallies on flies.Does anyone oWC have good fly experience in this lake in late July?I've found Hex nymphs suggested,as this is a cold lake and the fish will eat mayfly nymphs readily,but I need to know if any particular surface bugs work at this 'early' time of year(compared to Aug and Sept).I will certainly have mickeys and leech flies,but I was hoping to find someone who has actual fly-time on the lake and would share fly suggestions.Thank You! PS:Micropterus--absolutely correct! Michael was like our personal gourmet chef when I fished last year--they were booked heavy on the weeks either side of us,but we were the only two in camp fishing on our week!"
554048,Guest,2006-01-25 18:13:00,0,Hi folks Im looking for any first hand information on Island 10 fishing resort on Lady Evelyn Lake in Ontario. Its just north of North Bay. Iv got a chance to take the wife and kids up there for a week and would like to hear from anyone thats been up there. Thanks Karl

554052,Rich B,2006-01-25 19:18:00,1081,"Karl, I've been up to that camp under prior ownership, and several of my friends go up over Labor Day week to this camp every year. Top quality camp, with a great ""boat-in"" experience up a river, portage around a dam and then back to the camp on a cruiser from the lodge. Very nice/new accommodations and good food/boats/cabins. Very clean and helpful owners/staff. You'll catch fish, though from my experience the fishing isn't as good as you'd find in Western Ontario. I've fished Lady Lake Evelyn 6 or 7 times, and caught walleye up to 8 lbs; and pike up to 6+ lb range....there are certainly bigger walleyes and pike, and smallmouth bass (I've caught those up to 2+ lbs); though day in and out you're more likely to catch 1-2 lb (eaters) walleye and 1-2 lb bass, and an occasionally pike. Most guys that I saw fished the walleye with a jig and worm or jig and minnow off the bottom with good success, along as they used light line. The lake itself is beautiful, and you normally won't see many (if any) other boats in the bays (other than from your camp) or the two other camps on the lake. If you wish to fish the back bays, you'll have those to yourselves. Good luck with your decision......feel free to email me if you have any questions, or want info from my friends (they're headed back up this Labor Day weekend). Rich B"

1056409,striper sam,2008-09-20 12:10:00,1,try another lake. this one's fished out. we tried island 10. a brutal waste of time. they actually used `used water bottles' for the lunch ! got kidnapped when they refused to return us to their landing a day ahead of time. wanted to charge us $300 instead of their posted $50.chincy food. a lot of yack yack on day one. we had a license and could have been fishing but had to listen to a loud mouth owner who wasted everybody's time. maybe it was about gas $$a lot of other lake in this area to choose from. try another. also...................try the US. Canada sucks. the border problems suck. but then they are our allies aren't they ? I think NOT.ss

1109494,Guest,2009-05-31 07:22:00,0,"Have been 5 times over the last 7 years and have had nothing but positiv experiences each and every time. From the fishing to the service and hospitality, nothing but the best. Maybe Striper Sam was looking for monster fish to jump in the boat. That isn't going to happen. Its a great fishery though and the scenery is unmatched. Mike"
1112612,micropterus,2009-06-10 11:13:00,450,Do not know any specifics of Island 10. Have been going to Lady Evenlyn for over 50 years. The fishing has gone from great to sucks and is back to very good. Best food is at Red Pine Lodge. I going to try new owners at Garden Island this year.
1115383,SkeeterJeff,2009-06-21 20:48:00,31,"My wife and I have been going to Lady Evelyn for six years now. We will be back up at Garden Island the last week of July. We loved Val and Norm, and Joe, the new Owner, did fine last year. We have never stayed at Island 10, only at Garden Island, and can not imagine anyone else having better service than what we have received. I had never even seen a walleye until we went to Lady Evelyn six years ago, and now I'm hooked. The walleye fishing just gets better every year. Last year the weather was cloudy, cool, windy, and rainy all week and we caught more/bigger walleye than every before. I had two 29.75's and my wife had a 29.5 and we had several over 25"". We had to eat fish every day to keep our license open to go out the next day. Sorry the other guy had a bad experience, but even our first year was an awesome experience. If you want an all inclusive trip, give Garden Island a try. Unlimited bait and gas, two hot meals a day and everything you need for shore lunch, 16.5' Lund boats with 25hp 4 stroke Yamahas (30hp if you have three in your boat), awesome dockside service and a knowledgeable, friendly, service oriented staff. It is pure ""Eat, Sleep, Fish"" for seven days!! We literally start counting the days to our next trip to Garden Island on our way home each year!! Jeff"
1123020,Sheila J.,2009-07-22 13:27:00,1,"We have been going to Island 10 for the past 29 years (it would be 30 but camp was full). We have been through three different owners and fishing that went from good to mediocre and now back to very good. You could not ask for a better run camp than Island 10! Ken & Bev have made vast improvements both to the cabins and the equipment. They are very nice and accomodating people and the staff is terrific. If you leave the lodge after a meal and complain that you are hungry......its no ones fault but your own. The food is great and plentiful. The cabins are modern with indoor plumbing and hot water. The staff takes care of your cabin every day, making the beds, supplying towels, and general clean-up. I found it VERY hard to believe the comments by ""stripersam"". He must have had a burr up.... Oh well, I am glad to hear he is not returning to the Island, as I would not want him to ruin the enjoyment of all the other guests. You cannot find a much nicer place to go than Island 10.......if you are fishing or if you just want to relax, read a book, and enjoy the beauty and quiet of Lady Evelyn."
