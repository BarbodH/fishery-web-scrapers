1306687,HighTech,2011-05-14 07:36:00,75,"If the dog is 19 years old or older he can bring in a case of Beer. He can apply for 2 fishing licences since he has 4 feet. (one licence per pair!) He will also need a boat licence to operate the motor, and a life vest. Other than that he should be good to go!"
1305500,LOW1,2011-05-11 08:01:00,2828,Do I need anything besides a rabies vaccination certificate to take a dog into Canada? We have been going to our Lake of the Woods cabin for years but I have never taken our dog before. Anyone ever have problems crossing the border with a dog? We will cross the border at Fort Frances if that makes a difference.
1305508,Pezman38,2011-05-11 08:17:00,3196,"Took a lab hunting last year, and had no issues, they didn't even ask about him. We had the record of the shots from the vet the dog had received but were never asked for them. Bring your dog with you!"

1305520,Sportfisher,2011-05-11 08:35:00,47,Been going to Sask hunting every fall for over 20 years. You will need the rabies certificate from your vet. Make sure that it was signed by the vet no more than 30 days prior to your crossing. I have only been asked for the certificate 1 time. Take the dog.
1305523,Pezman38,2011-05-11 08:41:00,3196,"Good call on the 30 days, forgot to mention that."
1305594,81Saluki,2011-05-11 11:36:00,97,Went up several years ago with my folks and took their dog. Was asked if we had the certificate (but didn't have to show it) AND if we had brought dog food ... we had to show them the dog food bag ingredients label. We were OK but apparently some types of dog food aren't allowed. Maybe someone else here can clarify this for you.
1305596,Pezman38,2011-05-11 11:40:00,3196,Probably dog food with dirt and potatoes aren't allowed!
1305606,Jimmy Jig,2011-05-11 11:55:00,1905,"I believe that beef in dog food is not OK, lamb and salman are OK"
1305610,cast_and_blast,2011-05-11 12:06:00,1098,"Make sure the dog doesn't have a DUI or they will need to pay the ""rehabilitation"" fee. Scott"
