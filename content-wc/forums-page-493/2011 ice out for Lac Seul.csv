1304004,Jigger1,2011-05-07 14:12:00,234,"That is the right site for viewing a large portion of LacSeul. You'll need to look at the USA 3 satellite and zoom into 250m. Depending on your screen, if you have a wide screen you'll be able to see the entire central portion of LacSeul in the upper right hand corner without having to scroll on the screen. The last several days have been overcast so it's impossible to see, however today it looks like a light haze is over LacSeul but you can still see some ice. If look at the picture from May 3, LacSeul kind of jumps off the page and it was entirely covered with ice."
1304287,gapwedge,2011-05-08 13:24:00,19,"Can anyone tell me when the ice out typically occurs on LS?Im planning my first trip to LS the last week of June. I'm guessing that the time of ice out has a bearing on the fishing through, say, the end of June. Is this right?Specifically, I'm planning on fishing Big V for bass half the time and LS for eyes the other half. Might also devote some time to go for LT and/or musky if conditions are right.Any thoughts how current conditions foretell what I'll find productive come the end of June. Thanks."
1304318,BenBeattie,2011-05-08 15:59:00,232,"A later ice out will definitely delay the walleye moving onto their classic main lake summer spots. By the end of june, fishing will be excellent for walleye on LS. I'd expect to be fishing avg depths of 15-25' depending on the conditions during the specific time you're here. Around that time, I expect to be filling my days around Bear Narrows. Of course you can catch fish all over the lake, but that's a great area with a lot of fish moving through. Well worth the drive, IMO. As far as your lakers on Big V, you could probably still get them trolling with some deeper diving cranks or Dipsey Divers. I'd be prepared to troll and jig tubes though. Musky... now you're talking!! Last week of June is basically the 2nd week of the season.... find the warmest water in bays with emerging weeds. Are you planning on fishing muskie on Big V or Lac Seul?"
1304999,wallydave,2011-05-10 06:53:00,2151,What is the latest from the western end of Lac Seul? May 5th is the average ice-out at Goose Bay.
1305468,Guest,2011-05-11 06:59:00,0,"Ice went out on Sunday for us here at Evergreen Lodge, water levels are at a seasonal norm and coming up quickly with the dams holding back water to aid the Winnipeg Flooding. Looks to be a great post spawn bite with the 21st opener, take care of the big girls, Gary"
1305507,NWwalleye,2011-05-11 08:17:00,223,Thanks Gary.Looking forward to another great year of guiding on Lac Seul ..
1305571,wallydave,2011-05-11 10:41:00,2151,"The group I fish with has always tried to hit the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul around the first of June. This year we will be a week later than usual, with the late ice-out we are hoping our timing will be perfect"
1305578,Knoxabilly,2011-05-11 11:07:00,225,16 days!!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to pull up to Evergreen!
1305611,NWwalleye,2011-05-11 12:09:00,223,"Should be awesome this year .. Normal ice out , normal water levels and hopefully the weather patterns stay normal ..I too can't wait"
1306289,wallydave,2011-05-12 21:57:00,2151,"NW, we have fished the Ear Falls section with low, high and ""normal"" water levels. We have always done well, sometimes great! I am taking a newbie up North, so I hope we do well! Any time you are up North especially on the mighty Lac, you are going to have a great trip! Just a few more weeks to go! For our group anyway! We'll be out of GBC, heading for the Sanctuary, Steamboat, plus a few new spots!?"
1294156,jswinter40,2011-04-13 10:03:00,127,I bet on May 10th LS will be ice free.
1295479,wallydave,2011-04-16 09:03:00,2151,"Looks like winter is not ready to let go just yet! I just checked the weather for Ear Falls, snow and colder. The webcam and ice out blog at Tomahawk are looking like snow and cold weather ahead. The wait continues!"
1297694,wallydave,2011-04-21 12:52:00,2151,"Several other ice-out threads are appearing, must be signs of spring! It looks like it could be a later ice-out this season any new or revised ice-out dates?"
1300132,wallydave,2011-04-27 19:20:00,2151,"I had picked April 28 for my ice-out date. Looks like I am out for the big grand prize! I got an e-mail full of misspellings tell me I had inherited something like 5 million pounds, from some distant relative in England. Sorry guys that was the seed money for the grand prize for the right ice out date! So any other guesses for ice out!"
1300319,wallydave,2011-04-28 07:54:00,2151,"I just heard from Andrea at Goose Bay Camp, she is calling for a May 15th ice-out!"
1300684,fishinfever76,2011-04-29 06:34:00,1,"Hey guys, was checking things on the Tomahawk Resort webcam at www.tomahawkresort.ca/ReginaBayCamera.cfm, and there is a big crack forming in the ice. Looking at the ice out pics on their blog, the last update yesterday, things are looking black and pretty soft. Their weather forecast is calling to be quite windy over the next couple days and rain over the weekend. From what it sounds, they may have open water on lake of the woods after the weekend (woo hoo!!)"
1301936,wallydave,2011-05-02 07:29:00,2151,"It looks like LOW is open now, saw a report from Red Lake 4/29 8 inches of ice, how are things looking on LS?"
1303547,wallydave,2011-05-06 07:17:00,2151,"I read a post that the east end of Lac Seul is staring to open up, any news on the west end? According to several WC sources May 5th is the average ice-out for the Goose Bay area, one day out from that, how are things looking!?"
1303552,Jack77,2011-05-06 07:23:00,168,http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/I don't know if you saw this before but it is a link to a site that has daily sat photos. You can see which lakes are iced out and which are not.
1303579,wallydave,2011-05-06 08:07:00,2151,"Thanks Jack, I did see this site, but it looks like LS is just to far north, oh well, all of the looking around really can't speed up the wait, but it sure seems to help!"
1285948,wallydave,2011-03-23 14:49:00,2151,"From what I have read here on WC, the Ear Falls area is still deep into winter. My group is watching the weather up north closely. Part of this years trip is a teacher taking his family to Goose Bay. We had a few snow days that will delay his departure, June 3rd instead of June 1st. Our last trip 08 we were a week later, the water was high, warm, and it had been an early ice out. Fishing was still good, but all our usual spots did not produce, that why we call it fishing, not just catching?! We are just going a little crazy waiting for another trip to Canada!"
1285998,BenBeattie,2011-03-23 16:23:00,232,"Add at least another week for ice out... -25 C last night and at least -20 at night for the next 5 nights. Lots of ice, nearly 3' still. A lot could still change but this weeks weather will certainly prolong ice out."
1286018,Skywagon,2011-03-23 17:10:00,1106,"Last year we were off the ice by the end of March, this year it looks like we will be out there until the close of walleye season, April 15th. Three feet of ice on some lakes here too Ben, though the quality of the top few inches is suspect."
1287356,wallydave,2011-03-26 19:30:00,2151,"One of our group just bought a Toyota Tundra crew cab for this years and years following trip to Goose Bay! A couple of years ago, on the way back home, he was in his car, and was singled out for inspection at the US border. He looked around, his was the only car in line! Maybe this year he won't get inspected!?"
1287391,fishman10,2011-03-26 21:17:00,226,"i travel every 3 weeks from thunder bay to kapuskasing. this year has been a normal winter. an believe me, it is still like the middle of january up hear."
1289147,wallydave,2011-03-31 06:57:00,2151,I found web cam from Tomahawk resort on LOW. It looks like the ice is still holding up! According to some of the posts it looks like a late ice out. The wait until June goes on... very slowly!
1293852,wallydave,2011-04-12 13:00:00,2151,"Weather reporters are calling for the chance of snow in Cen. Il. this weekend, looks like some cold weather for Ontario too! Hows is the ice holding up near Ear Falls?"
1294115,wallydave,2011-04-13 08:21:00,2151,"My group has a school teacher as it founding member. When we started he was a tile setter, until he hurt his back, went back to school and now he is a school teacher. We would always go to the Ear Falls end of LacSeul, late May, early June time frame. This year we will be a week later, due to his and his boys end of school year timing. So is it wrong to hope for a slightly later ice out, so we can hit the water in time for the post spawn bite?"
1294148,jswinter40,2011-04-13 09:43:00,127,"Its only wrong to fish the same spots and hope for the same conditions each year. So if you only fish early season post spawn transition spots then yes hope for a later ice out. If you learn spots the corespond to different times a year then you wouldn't have to be so nervous about what exact week you go. I certainly don't know it all but on Lac Suel they are biting all year, you just got to find where. I can tell you that the last week of June and into July can be fantastic from my personal experience and you get more stable weather."
1294154,wallydave,2011-04-13 10:03:00,2151,"JSW, we have been fishing the EF section for several years and different times of the year! Water levels, temps and ice out dates always impact where the fish are. LS is a great fishery, and adapting to conditions is why its called fishing, not just catching! After fishing the usual spots, its an adventure to try new spots, and techniques! LS is a large body of water, and plenty of different structure, but some spots just bring back memories of so many great trips, it is hard to let those spots go unfished!"
1250832,wallydave,2010-11-22 08:24:00,2151,"Thanks again Rob! Just how far are you from Goose Bay Camp, it sounds like your just down the Bay from Andrea's place. We usually fish the rapids, the mouth,Sawmill and windy points. I like you web site, how has your business been? I hope the economy improves soon! Have a good day!"
1253634,wallydave,2010-12-06 12:56:00,2151,"Anybody know how thick the ice is in the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul? Any other depth reports would be interesting to hear about! In central Il. some ponds and lakes are frozen, others are open, and others are getting close to freezing over."
1253654,Guest,2010-12-06 14:54:00,0,"After the surface froze we had three heavy snowfalls in as many days. I haven,t been out to measure the thickness but I could see open water in the main part of the lake while I was snowplowing on Friday. You can see where the slush is coming up to the snow surface and freezing in our bay. The bays will be poor ice this year and will melt fast come spring due to the slushy ice that has formed. I noticed that KayAir just south of me put out small conifer trees to mark his runway on Saturday. No planes on the ice yet. There has been at least five snowmachines through the ice in the last few days in the Kenora and Dryden areas with one death. The temps are going to drop this week so things should tighten up...Rob"
1254437,bpetersen,2010-12-09 21:00:00,251,"Good to hear from you, Rob. Hope your season went well and had good moose hunting."
1257180,wallydave,2010-12-22 10:58:00,2151,"Here in central Illinois, we just had a father and son incident while ice fishing. The 15 year old son was under water and taken to the hospital. No word on how the son is doing. Becareful on the ice!"
1269834,wallydave,2011-02-10 07:17:00,2151,"Here in Central Il. we just missed a second major snow storm, and are looking at some temps in the high 30's and low 40's to melt the 15-20 inches of snow from last week. According to some of the camp owners from the Ear Falls section of LS, average ice out is May 5th, does anyone have a date to pick for the ice out? My dates is April 28."
1272973,wallydave,2011-02-19 20:01:00,2151,"We have thawed out from the Feb blizzard. The Illinois River is open in the channel,but still some ice along the banks. Looka like the local ponds are still mostly ice covered, but showing signs of opening up. How are things in the rest of the walleye world?"
1273390,Skywagon,2011-02-21 04:17:00,1106,"wallydave,I have heard you guys in Illinois crying all winter about the bad weather. I have been in Central Illinois for 10 days now and it feels like Florida. I hope to head back home to fantacy land tomorrow, where there is ""real"" winter (none of this mamby-pampy we had 20 inches of snow stuff) and ""real"" fish to be caught. If you like, I will leave my bermuda shorts for any of you guys that have worn yours out in this (rough winter)."
1273429,wallydave,2011-02-21 07:06:00,2151,"Skywagon, we just are not used to being snowed in down in these parts of the States! Several years ago, we were in Florida in winter, it was around 60 degrees, we were in our shorts and tee-shirts, the natives were in coats and long pants! So I guess by the time LS opens up, it could use those shorts! Just leave them with Andrea at Goose Bay, or you could mail them to me with some Cubans cigars in the pockets!"
1277597,wallydave,2011-03-03 14:29:00,2151,"Tackle Man from Gull Rock posted a May 10th Iceout for his lake, north of the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul. Any gesstimates for the NW section of LS?"
1247775,wallydave,2010-11-08 19:19:00,2151,Are there any guesses to when the 2011 ice out on Lac Seul will be? My guess is April 24th.
1247827,Skywagon,2010-11-09 05:55:00,1106,"Gee Dave, with above normal temperatures here, it may never freeze up this year, but in case it does, I'll say May 2nd. Feel free to deposit the winnings in my snow machine account."
1247929,JDP,2010-11-09 14:21:00,1457,"These are the dates that I have collected from a Goose Bay resort on the west end of Lac Seul.

1247940,Golden Eagle,2010-11-09 14:50:00,2642,"A sudden, late, cold snap could freeze it really thick before snow covers and insulates the ice. Could be lots of ice this winter. Might not break up until around July 4."
1248060,wallydave,2010-11-10 07:05:00,2151,"Golden Eagle, if we still have ice in July, I could try ice fishing when I'm at Goose Bay in June! I bet I could safe a few bucks on renting a boat!! Another plus, not skeeters or black flys!!"
1249737,wallydave,2010-11-17 09:34:00,2151,Both my boat and cabin buddies picked May 5th for the ice out date. Any other takers?
1250636,Guest,2010-11-21 09:20:00,0,"Don't know if anyone is creating a data base to track these things or if anyone even cares, but the bay in front of our place froze over yesterday afternoon. The wind came up during the night and it is fractured and big chunks this morning. Once the wind stops it will be frozen for good. We got our first snow of the season on Friday(about five inch's) it chilled the surface to close to freezing. I will report again in the spring when it melts...Cheers....Rob"
1250706,wallydave,2010-11-21 15:56:00,2151,Thanks for the ice in report. Do you have a guess for the ice out?
1250771,Guest,2010-11-21 21:27:00,0,"The dates that JDP posted are from my records. You could average them out and come close. There are so many variables that could affect this. If we have an early but light freeze up and then a lot of snow the ice tends to be of a poorer quality and will melt fast. A year with no snow and low temps makes good clear ice and it will melt slower. I recall one year when there was a lot of dust or dirt in the air it collected on the surface of the lake and attracted the sun in the spring. You could see it melt in front of your eyes. Another year it was melting nicely and we had a spring blizzard with some cold weather, the fresh white snow took another month to melt down to where it was earlier. Andrea at Goose Bay will be able tell you some stories she has lived on the shore of this bay since the mid fiftys. I have only been here since the late seventys. Stop over for a visit when you are up....Rob"
