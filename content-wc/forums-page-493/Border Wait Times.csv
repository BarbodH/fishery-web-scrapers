575311,Brown,2008-06-22 12:09:00,4,"You are correct Sam. Everyone should unite behind your personal boycott and vendetta against the Canadian Government and its innocent population for your friends unintended possession of an illegal letter opener. That anal retentive boarder guard should have just let your friend go. Who does he think he is? What did he think you were going to do with an illegal object? He should have known you had no intention of killing someone with it. Or maybe use it in self defense. That boarder guard should be immediately removed from that position and terminated, that should teach the rest of the guards to look the other way as well. You didn't mention why you may have been pulled over in the first place. Was it just routine, were they just picking on you or were they looking for a vehicle that may have fit the same description as the one you were in. Just can't imagine that some criminal may be driving the same make and color of vehicle that you were in. They should have know your group was not who they may have been looking for. Get real Sam, store's and flea markets sell things that one cannot posses. Doesn't make any sense that it may be legal to sell, but illegal to have or use. For instance, here in Wisconsin its illegal to use electronic game calls, you can buy them and have them. You just can't use them to call in game and shoot them. There maybe exceptions to that rule, but one should read the rules to make sure when and where they can be used. As they say, ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking the law. Yes, the guard could of look the other way, or could have just taken the letter opener. He didn't, we have only heard one side of this story. I wonder what the other side has to say? Sam, your demands make no sense to me. Seems you what to hurt all of Canada for the actions of one person who just may have been doing their job for what ever reason. What if your job or retirement or one of your groups jobs depend on shipping products they make to companies in Canada or partially depend on those for their income, and those companies quit buying those products in defense of your demands. Seems you want to punish a lot of innocent people for an obvious innocent mistake. Remember the box cutters on those planes, no one thought they could be used to hijack them. Far fetched, maybe. Think of me what you want and blast away if need be. Good luck in your endeavor to cripple a Country."

1305063,REG,2011-05-10 09:19:00,445,"The last couple of years the wait has been nothing. Much different from just a few years ago (when this was originally posted). About 10 years ago, I was in line at Intl Falls for about an hour to get across on a Friday evening. The last couple of years it has been maybe a 5 car wait - even on Friday evening around 6-7pm."
1306277,wallydave,2011-05-12 21:03:00,2151,"My last trip we crossed on Friday night, a couple of cars, instead of a couple of hours on Sat. am! So we plan on staying in FF Friday night before we hear for Goose Bay Camp near Ear Falls. In three weeks, I'll be finishing up on the packing, and trying to get a good nights sleep before we head North!"
1306406,jswinter40,2011-05-13 08:26:00,127,unfortunately we will be going thru on a Sat in July on our way to Lac Seul. Who early should I be to the border to aviod the big Saturday lines? 6:00am? 7:00am? 8:00am? I would just stay in Ifalls on friday but I don't think my whole crew can swing that.
575030,MOfish,2008-06-13 11:29:00,39,Does anybody have an estimate for crossing into Fort Frances for next Friday at 7:00am? and back into International Falls on the following Friday at 7:00am?
575048,rpieske,2008-06-13 18:49:00,1276,At 7 am on Fridays it shouldn't be too bad. Give yourself 30-40 minutes. If you cross any later the time grows. Today was pretty crowded at 9 am. Long lines.
575049,phishfearme,2008-06-13 18:58:00,1242,take a look at the following site - i hear it's pretty accurate:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html phish

575083,Guest,2008-06-14 21:42:00,0,"Went through last Fri and waited maybe fifteen min. total at noon. Was told those coming back in had waited an hour at least. Today, took about another fifteen min to get back on our way, noon again."
575103,Guest,2008-06-15 21:34:00,0,Went into Canada on Friday June 6th at about 6:30 or 7 and got across in 3 minutes. Came back on Saturday June 14 around noon and got across in less than 5 minutes. The quickest every no wait either way. The line going in on Saturday at noon was very long.
575111,Guest,2008-06-16 11:01:00,0,how much is the toll at the border and which side is it on?
575163,Guest,2008-06-17 13:31:00,0,$6.00 going north only.
