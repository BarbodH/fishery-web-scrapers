1306549,oldtimefisherman,2011-05-13 15:28:00,1,I am taking a group of guys up to Dinorwic/Wabigoon this year and they do not know the lake. Can anyone suggest a goog GPS and map they could purchase so they do not kill themselves on the rocks.

Go to http://drydenyachtclub.com/ and scroll down the page to the info. on how to get it.

I have had trakmaps for about three years and have had absolutely no trouble with them in the Garmin GPS. Good Luck!"
