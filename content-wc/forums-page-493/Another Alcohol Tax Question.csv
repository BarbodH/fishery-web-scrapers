1306126,Guest,2011-05-12 13:09:00,0,"Ok, I made a call to the duty free store in IF they sell Bud Light for $18.00 a case. So you get one case free or one liter duty free into Canada. After your 1st case or liter you will pay 8 to 10 bucks/case duty at the border. So figure you will have $27.00 per case invested into a case of beer after the 1st one. Now, if you buy your Bud light at the LCBO in Ear Falls the price is $37.95 fro case(24) in cans. Price of a case of bottles of Bud Light is $33.95, bottles hold less then cans in Canada. Smokes are $33.00 a carton at the Duty Free store. Don't care about the price of smokes in Canada. This may or may not answer the orginal question. BTW the Bud Light you buy at the Duty Free & LCBO is the same. It is NOT the same as what you buy in the States."
1306130,teddi,2011-05-12 13:32:00,349,if you are worried about $5.00 or so in duty then you may want to rethink your trip to canada. when we go south most of us are not concerned about a few extra dollars.
1306132,KevinSB,2011-05-12 13:33:00,73,"Thanks to JDP and others for the helpful notes. Since it appears beer is not subject to a value-based tax, looks like the KevinSB party will bring most (it would be wrong to skip Canadian beer entirely) of its beer from Illinois.Time to daydream about tying countless spinners while my buddy drives us up on May 27..."
1306133,KevinSB,2011-05-12 13:39:00,73,"Teddi, I wasn't. I was worried about the possibility of $30-40/case duty instead of $10, and I was ""worried"" only in the sense that the tax would lead me to choose product differently.Not sure what about the thread suggested this was a $5 issue, but anyway other helpful folks answered my question."
1306137,Walley Guide,2011-05-12 13:50:00,67,"teddi....I agree with you on the few extra dollars making or breaking the trip. I'll toss in my two cents as well....take/buy what you need to make your trip more enjoyable, doesn't matter if it is an extra bag of your favorite jigs, or your beverage of choice. It all comes down to making the trip a memorable one. The northland has a lot to offer. Hope you all have a great trip this year! Happy Fishin' Walley"
1306151,Guest,2011-05-12 14:36:00,0,"Well, we plan our trip and expenses down to the penny and budget accordingly. Carefully rationing our beer and liquor to last the entire week. After doing this for the last 15 years we can almost make it till Tuesday before going into town for a resupply."
1306189,NARDA 1,2011-05-12 17:42:00,636,"You could also try going to a lodge that has a bar, then you don't have to worry about the duty...."
1306279,wallydave,2011-05-12 21:18:00,2151,"My group actually likes Canadian beer! Blue and Kokanee are our favs! The Canadian beer south of the border does not seem to taste the same. So we take our case of beer in, and pick up a 12 or two while we are there! It is just part of the trip! Part of the adventure of traveling is trying the local food and beverages. But thats just me?! It is your trip, do what it takes to make the trip memorable! Within reason of course!"
1306420,Spin,2011-05-13 09:35:00,42,Not sure why your drinking Bud Light in Canada when Kokanee is readily available and taste much better.
1306429,Guest,2011-05-13 09:57:00,0,I used Bud Light because you can buy it about anywhere in the states & the LCBO. This was a thread about cost & tax on bringing beer into Canada. If you want to discuss your favaorite or best tasting Canadian beer I think there is another thread already going on that issue. BTW Canadian Bud Light is brewed by Labatt's and tastes alot like Labbats Blue.
1305595,KevinSB,2011-05-11 11:37:00,73,"Sorry to bother the board with yet another import tax question, but I have searched the archives and been unable to find the answer to my question: is the tax for excess beer (i.e., over one case per person) subject to a fixed tax or instead one based on value?I'd read numerous comments suggesting tax was based on value, but I then found the document below. I'm not convinced I understand it correctly (is this the only tax or instead one of several taxes?), but Appendix B suggests that the excess Ontario tax for beer is $.0676/liter. My buddies and I are beer snobs, so if the tax is fixed I'd likely buy preferred beer locally. However, if tax is based on value I'd consider buying cheaper beer at the duty-free store.To be clear, in either case we'll fully declare and pay taxes on what we owe. Thanks in advance.http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publicati...d2-3-6-eng.pdf (see Appendix B)p.s. 16 days to go!"
1305612,Mark R,2011-05-11 12:11:00,1538,"If they ask, and sometimes they do how much you paid per case, I would say it's based upon the price you paid per case. we usually pay about $9.00 per case. As a beer snob what amount in additaional tax is to high to bring the snobby beer instead of drinking the cheap stuff. BTW the beer at duty free isn't to much cheaper then you can buy at home."
1305617,Sportfisher,2011-05-11 12:16:00,47,"I believe the duty is based on your purchase price. I always bring over the 8 box limit on shotgun shells and always carried a box with the sales price sticker on it, in case I had to show the nice people at the border. That box was about 10 years old, and was price at something like $5.00, when current prices were about 2x that amount. If you are bringing beer, don't forget that the duty free limit is 1 case per person. Also they do make 30 can cases!"
1305643,Bill Krejca,2011-05-11 13:22:00,6107,"Re: 30 can case - Occasionally, the folks at the border ask if the case is 24 or 30. Just sharing this. Bill"
1305653,cast_and_blast,2011-05-11 13:40:00,1098,"Yep, it's 24 x 12oz (or the ml equivalent). Not 24 tall boys or 30 x 12oz. PS - if you're bringing beer and liquor, it's cheaper to pay the duty on the beer. Scott"
1305731,Tbum,2011-05-11 17:29:00,12,My 2 cents for what it's worth...I'd rather paythe extra $9 duty per case rather than spending close to $40/case close to camp.Kevin I sent you a PM. See you on Wabaskang.
1305765,Glenman12,2011-05-11 18:56:00,762,yep..found that out the hard way several years back..always declare you hard liquor and pay the duty on the beer
1305868,MorganMan,2011-05-11 21:48:00,341,"We too had been asked in the past about how much we paid per case leading one to believe the duty is based on what was paid. We haven't been asked lately though. Definitely better to buy beer in states and pay duty. We have done the math and if you shop for it and get deals, way cheaper. Also, then it is packed where you want it as far as weight distribution....if you take what we take."
1306040,KevinSB,2011-05-12 09:33:00,73,"Thanks to all for the info so far. No question we'll bring from home or buy at duty-free in lieu of Ontario's Beer Store, but still trying to figure out if tax is based on value.If my $10ish/case tax triples to $30 because the beer costs more, I'd rather know that (and then drink cheaper beer). If I'm paying $10ish/case regardless, I'll bring more of the good stuff from home (although it'd be criminal not to drink some Canadian beer on the trip).Thanks again for the replies. And is anybody familiar with the document linked to in my initial note?"
1306080,JDP,2011-05-12 11:24:00,1457,I found this tidbit for you:http://wiki.answers.com/Q/When_visit...uty-free_limitI also found a number of posts on other message boards that corraborated the $8/case figure during the summer of 2010.Have A Great Trip!So maybe you could allow for $9 - $10 per case of beer...you will still be in good shape.
