1302222,Guest,2011-05-02 20:03:00,0,Take along a container or two of gas additive or gas dryer. Went one time and the storage tank had a bunch of water in it. Filled up the tanks and everyone had motor problems. Had to pump a pitcher of fuel and let the water settle out to get fresh fuel. Also I had to work on about 5 outboards and carbs with a modicum of tools. I guarantee that a high percentage of groups would have been stranded. Got back to Fort frances and told them but they seemed like it didn't matter to them.
1302382,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-03 08:18:00,66,"A tether or lanyard for your fishing pliers. Somebody always loses a set every year trying to do boat side releases or something. I watched my brother-in-law lose two.....in one day....in the exact same spot in the river....4 hours apart. The second one was priceless. In one hand he held a throw back walleye, in the other a pair of pliers. I hear ""ker-plunk"". I turn around and he still has the walleye....no pliers. We ate that walleye out of principle."
1307300,pike usa,2011-05-15 19:45:00,15,finally got almost all of the stuff from my fishing list. thx again for all the replys. Leaving for melchett lake in 19 days and counting..
1307326,Mike Borger,2011-05-15 20:35:00,1554,"Without getting into my entire list here's a couple things I always bring.Many of these cabins can be quite dark. I always bring a mini butane lantern. They're incredibly lightweight and throw off a ton of light. I have this one:http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_d...34374302697119It never ceases to amaze me when I see people fly bottled water into a camp.Yes you can boil it, but I've found a lightweight water filter to be indispensible. It takes all the bacteria, protozoa and tannin colour and taste out of the water. Pumps roughly 1L of water in a minute and weighs nothing.The model I use screws right into the top of a 1L nalgene bottle for pumping. If you're thirsty on the lake drop the filter in and fill up your bottle.I'll bring sugar free (aspartame based) drink crystals like Crystal Light and mix it in with the water. I really like the ice tea, tastes great.This is the model I have:http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_d...34374302696689Finally, many times you'll get a few stray mosquitos in the cabin at night. Nothing worse than trying to sleep with a blood thirsty wee beastie buzzing in your ear. First off I always bring a roll of duct tape and a bit of plastic to patch any potential holes. Then instead of burning mosquito coils all night (can't stand breathing that crap in, I'd rather be bitten), I bring a can of household Raid and spray the cabin 15 mins. before hitting the sack. Problem solved."
1307353,JayM5209,2011-05-15 21:49:00,1050,"Three additions:1) Someone mentioned hand lotion to soften and soothe those water logged and slimed hands. Make sure it's Corn Huskers, the extra heavy duty lotion, available at Walgreens and other such stores.2) If you are at danger of sun burn from over exposure - as I am - be sure to pack a small jar of Noxzema. Absolutely the most effective thing there is to take the burn out.3) Several extra boot laces or two foot lengths of heavy cord. I have several in the boat, two or three more in tackle bags, and several others scattered in jacket pockets, the truck, etc. They are not for your boots, but to remove a fish hook should the need arise! Also, if you haven't had to do it, or seen someone else use the line jerk technique, Google ""fish hook removal"" before leaving home and be sure you understand the technique.P.S. Why a boot lace or heavy cord when most instructions say a loop of fishing line? Because I don't trust fishing line. First time I saw this done the person doing the removal used a double loop of 12lb. mono and it broke, so the poor victim had to go through it twice. Also, if you ever have to remove a hook using this method, do not pull the hook out. JERK it out using all the speed and strength you can muster. It will reduce the pain for the patient. Here's one explanation..... http://www.simplesurvival.net/hooks.htm"
1295372,GOBIG,2011-04-16 05:48:00,126,I went one year and the whole group got sick. Take anything from nasal to antibiotics. Several guys could not fish for two days due to being sick. You can never have too much or the wrong stuff.
1295492,wallydave,2011-04-16 09:35:00,2151,"As we watch this list continue to grow it reminds me why I like the drive-in option. I have only been on one fly-in trip, and I drove myself crazy worrying about the weight limit. In the future I would like to try another fly-in trip, and I will keep some of the itmes posted here, as well as the packing list from the outfitter in mind, but for this years trip, I can take along everything I might, or at least think I can't live without to my dirve-in camp near Ear Falls!"
1295545,Freytown,2011-04-16 11:53:00,770,A small tube or bottle of hand lotion is always in my 1st aid pack. We all know what cleaning fish does to the hands. Good ideas on here.
1295580,Nimstug,2011-04-16 13:05:00,2605,"I take a small spiral notebook ~ 5x7 and a pencil that I write a summary of what happened that day, where we fished, weather, sketches of spots that have produced, or whatever strikes me. One day I will give it to my son and fishing partner, Jeff.NimstugMany men fish all their lives without knowing it is not fish they are after. -H.D. Thoreau"
1295921,walleyeduran,2011-04-17 11:21:00,286,Deck of cards and a cribage board. Life jacket? File to sharpen hooks.
1295978,joeman79,2011-04-17 13:41:00,417,"We forgot that and I put an ample supply of Stick matches in bathroom. Worked well compared to nothing. Nothing like ""man on an island fragance"" after a couple days of a grease and alchohol diet. Also as in previous posts especially on a fly in trip, not everyone needs to bring sunscreen-bug dope-first aid kits etc. We have gone to where we also just take one tackle box for each 2 people or each boat. and every year we bring less and less. When Shane comes to the dock to pick us up at Lost Island Lodge he is just shaking his head at the stack of crap we bring. We always bring way to much stuff, especially TACKLE!!! end up using a handful of jigs a few spinners and an assortment of Pike and Bass baits."
1296204,TIGHTLINER,2011-04-18 06:23:00,223,grasshopper you have gotten a lot of replies to your request most of all being what to take. You are going with seasoned fishermen who have had lots of full moons pass over them most have gathered great knowledge from this. Listen to the wise old ones do as they say soon you will be rewarded with great knowledge you can pass on also. Offer to clean cabin and clean dishes clean ****ter make beds get fire water when ask to. You someday will be sitting where the wise old ones are now. Enjoy trip you will be waiting for the many moons to pass for the following year.
1296237,Bigstorm,2011-04-18 07:53:00,799,"I havent seen it on here, but may have overlooked it, if you are pulling a boat, dont forget a spare tire for the trailer (I've seen this forgetten), and a decent jack to change a tire. Also, if you bring your own boat, its a good idea to bring a spare prop and the tools to change a prop and keep these items in your boat. A spare prop wont do you any good if you hit a rock and you are an hour away from your camp where the spare is."
1296510,pike usa,2011-04-18 19:40:00,15,the info on this forum is awesome. thanks everyone

1294607,back357,2011-04-14 08:32:00,106,"If you wear contacts, bring wetting solution as by the end of the day, the dust can cake up in your eyes. Super Glue and 5 min Epoxy. They don't take up space, but can definitely help if you break something or need to quick patch a leak in the boat. Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Hot Pepper for cooking (your cookie might be brining them, but wasn't sure) More beer. Gloves. Extra spool of fishing line. Also, and this sounds strange, I will wear clothes nearing the end of their usefulness (t-shirts, pants, socks, underwear) that I was planning on throwing away. Instead of hauling back dirty clothes, I just throw away some of the things."
1294651,Jack77,2011-04-14 10:13:00,168,I sure wish this kind of thing was avaiable the first time I went on a fly in. It would have saved me a whole lot of headaches. Pike USA is getting years worth of knowldege and experience in this forum while the rest of us had to learn the hard way. Good for you Pike.

1294661,Guest,2011-04-14 10:45:00,0,Do you pull the boat behind the U-Haul or pull the U-Haul behind the boat? And if you take the wife along the list just about triples!!!
1294796,ILScott,2011-04-14 15:55:00,139,"Couple of things I would reccomend would be buy a good rain suit. This could make or break your trip. Also, talk to your group because not everyone will need to bring a fish finder. You just need one for each boat. My group is allowed one tackle box and one plastic container to put clothes in to stay dry. I am not there to impress anybody so I fish in the same clothes most of the week. I travel light. There is always one person in a group that brings the kitchen sink you could borrow from especially if you are a newbie."
1294865,nd89sc88,2011-04-14 19:00:00,92,"Ok, so when I first saw this thread, I mocked it in my head, but I gotta say, this has turned into a really valuable resource. Well done all. So now, I just have to add my two cents: A sharp knife (or two) is key. Camp knives are always just sharp enough to cut your hand, but suck at actually cutting food. I usually bring two knives, a chefs knife (for everything except fish), and a fillet knife . . . they each get a good session with my water stones before they get packed, very carefully. If you can't shave with them, why bother? ;-) I know . . . I'm obsessed. But once you work with a truly sharp knife, it's hard to do without one. The scary part is that I actually have more money invested in my sharpening set-up than my most expensive Japanese knife. So I'm shocked. This turned out to be a really good thread. Bill PS Super glue is a great idea. Don't forget that it's a superb first aid tool for sealing a cut when stitches would otherwise be necessary."
1295050,Lovetofish,2011-04-15 09:58:00,458,Good thread going here. Thanks for the tip on the super glue. Didn't have that one and my list goes back 20 years. I take my family and pull a boat. I can add a rope to be used as a clothes line and mouse traps. Those furry friends show up every year.
1294192,jswinter40,2011-04-13 11:15:00,127,"This stuff is not in a first aid kit and someone needs to bring : BENADRYL (most important and may save your life), chewable Aspirin (especailly if you are over 50 - maybe your only line of defense from a Heart attack in the wilderness), Imodium, Sudafed (not the PE stuff, pseudoephedrine from behind the pharmacy counter (USA)).not necessitites but good to have: Ibuprofen/naproxen product, Zantac/Pepcid product, Tums, Aloe Vera Gel.If you normally have heartburn and have not seen a DR. then don't wait for it to happen in Canada.

1294326,CI_Guy,2011-04-13 15:47:00,2118,An extra set of keys for the tow vehicle in the boat and an extra set of boat keys in the vehicle!
1294331,Jack77,2011-04-13 16:06:00,168,"I will start out by saying that you should run this list by your crew first, becasue over wieght charges are generally shared among the group. Lets break down the list. - not everyone needs to bring their own shampoo, TP and toothpaste, check to see who is bringing it and share.- i don't think that music and headphones are neccessary but as long as you are talking about a Ipod then go ahead.- leave the tennis shoes at home, all you need are boots and flip flops for around camp.- grow the beard for a week and leave the razor at home- leave your clothes for the ride home in the car and change when you get back to the airbase.- some things that you might think about.- bug net- sweat shirts are nice but fleece is lighter- a pair of fishing gloves or rubber coated gloves- some other people brought up anti - diareha pills and hand lotion - GOOD IDEAS- Duct tape, but again your whole group only needs one roll- This may sound kind of gross but I will mention it anyway. A piss jug for the boat. Cut a bleach bottle in half like you would for a boat bailer. Pee in it and toss it over board then wash it out real quick in the lake. It is difficult and sometimes dangersous to pee over the side and you never get all of it over the side. This is much easier, cleaner and safer. I talked to some coasties once and they said that they pull alot of dead guys out of the lake with their flies open.- I bring two empty gatorade bottles to mix my drinks in. You can bring a lot of crystal light, powdered lemonade, etc and it weighs almost nothing.There are a lot of good ideas already mentioned but the important thing to remember is that you have a responsibilty to your group to keep your weight down so talk with them and get things ironed out."
1294332,elway12,2011-04-13 16:12:00,335,"Good points Jack77. There is a big diffence in whether you are flying in, driving in, bringing your own boat etc. and what type of resort/camp you are staying. I always brought a dish scrub pad, dish soap, roll of paper towels and trash bags but now the camp owner has all those things so we don't have to bring them. So it is importantt o ask and know what the resort provides and what it doesn't. Good idea on the gatorade bottles etc. for powdered drink mixes especially fly-ins to save weight on liquid."
1294351,bigwalleye1,2011-04-13 17:20:00,2632,"How about a landing net? Sounds like the answer to a ""Family Feud"" question....."
1294369,pike usa,2011-04-13 18:17:00,15,I am still laughing about this post because since this my first trip I got that list from a buddy and he'll love that his manhood is being challenged. hahahhahahhahaha

1293895,pike usa,2011-04-12 15:13:00,15,"I am going to list my fishing list below. Some of it might sound crazy but can you think of anything else i may need? first trip to canada for a week in early june.toothpaste/brush, soap, shampoo, deodorant, nasal medicine, qtips, advil, motion sickness pills, ear plugs, head phones/music, sunglasses, chap stick, hand sanitizer,toilet paper, pepto, underwear, socks,fishing pants,jeans and belt, shorts to sleep in, t shirts, cold gear mock turtleneck, sweatshirts, gloves, hats, flip flops, boots, tennis shoes, rain gear, life jacket, tackle box, rods, camera, video camera if needed, towels and wash cloths, pillow, blanket, bug spray, sunscreen, batteries, flashlight, fish finder, gps, maps, confirmation paperwork, towels for boat, small lunch box and ice pack, passport, small worm container, cash for trip, razor, shaving cream, fillet knives, outfit for comin out of camp, band aids, gum, cigars, lighter, beer etc. I know some of you will probably say you're crazy for taking this or that but we all need to be prepared. Any ideas on something you think i may need?"
1293908,mbay1455,2011-04-12 15:57:00,25,May depend on whether you are at a lodge or camping or in between but...I suggest having a mosquito net head covering for over your hat. Especially useful if you are out fishing near shore just before dark and the wind dies or if you're eating outside. I'd also suggest some black fly salve or ointment. They can be bad in June and it's easy to put some stuff on your ears and neck to keep 'em off. If you're going to do a lot of pike fishing and not experienced at handling them your hands will get quite a few nicks and scrapes during the week. I've started taking a heavy duty lotion for working hands kind of stuff and rub some on at night before bed. It helps.Good luck.
1293924,v-bay gord,2011-04-12 16:57:00,3168,"If you are taking everything but the kitchen sink, I would consider substituting a light sleeping bag for the blanket, and don't forget some plastic bags for fish....if you are freezing some."

1294168,elway12,2011-04-13 10:31:00,335,From my last couple of Canada experiences here are some very helpful things to take/keep in mind. Duct tape is very handy for many things that can break etc. during a trip. I have had to use it many times after flying in when clips break off of rod cases and coolers. Don't forget the video tape in your video camera(if you have an old one) and extra batteries for your cameras or a charger for them. 2 pair of sunglasses in case one falls off into the water A small alarm clock if you don't have a watch with that feature. Stringer/fish basket etc. Jerky there is no better snack on the boat!
