Specifically, I am looking at the following lakes:HighwindEthelmaKushogMirrorI don't think Highwind Lake Camp has any lodging availability for the time frame I want, but I still would like to launch my canoe onto Highwind (in order to gain access to Ethelma, Kushog, and Mirror lakes).It seems that the MNR ""Fish On"" site shows a boat launch between Highwind and Ethelma, but I don't know exactly how to access it.In looking at the topo map, it appears that there might be a road that heads east from 71 (near Andy Lake) and winds along the south side of Kilvert Lake toward Highwind.Does anybody happen to know the name of this road, and if it's possible to have public canoe access to Highwind even if I'm not staying at Highwind Lake Camp?Thanks in advance for any info,""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6056825,Low4fish,2018-03-12 19:55:00,37,The road is called the high wind lake rd. It takes you to high wind lake also easy access to Ethelma there with a couple options. With canoe high wind is accessible from the creek.Sent from my SM-T800 using Tapatalk

(Even if I'm not staying at Highwind Lake Camp)?I will be staying at Willard Lake (Pleasant Point Resort), because there was no lodging available at Highwind for the time I wanted.I'm assuming I can still get my canoe on these lakes though (via public access) if I am understanding correctly.Is that right?Thanks,John"
6060633,Laketripper,2018-03-14 11:23:00,103,The lakes you have interest in are all public access. You might want to consider a few nights camping out there if that is an option for you. Another trip to consider is to paddle to the east end of Willard Lake and portage along a fire road located north of the river which will take you east to Bruin Lake about 15 minute walk. From Bruin Lake I believe you may be able to paddle into Linklater Lake. This would be a nice day trip with no highway travel.
6060777,jackpotjohnny48,2018-03-14 12:19:00,153,"Thanks for the reply.I just checked the ""Fish On"" site from the Ontario MNR, and it appears that Linklater has both lake trout and northern pike. This is mainly what we would want to fish for, with an emphasis toward larger size (35+ inch) pike being our preferred target. I always prefer to fish for pike on the lake trout lakes, because I think the cisco forage base makes them grow bigger. But I do enjoy the lake trout fishing as well, so Linklater might be an option.Do you have any prior experience fishing Linklater, and if so, how did you do?Thanks."
6062393,Laketripper,2018-03-15 09:05:00,103,I've never been to Linklater Lake and never caught anything in Bruin Lake the few times I've fished it.
