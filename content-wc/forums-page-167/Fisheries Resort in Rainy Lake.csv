6024185,team walleye,2018-02-24 20:02:00,336,Has one stayed here? I just came across this looking for new places to stay on my June trips up north. I have always wanted to try Rainy. We mainly fish for walleye but getting into some crappie would also be fun.
6024217,That Minnesota guy,2018-02-24 20:14:00,8293,Personally I have never heard of it. What side you want to be on ? American or Canadian.
6024241,team walleye,2018-02-24 20:18:00,336,Doesn't really matter. Just needs to be walleye fishing near by. Crappie would be a nice bonus.
6024297,Baseline,2018-02-24 20:48:00,3207,"I've stayed at the Fisheries several times. It is located on Bears Passage and is in the dead center of some great fishing. From there you can go north into Baseline - Red Gut and beyond or south to Swell Bay and Seine Bays. Red Gut has great walleye, crappie and SMB fishing. Same with Swell and Seine. The resort is well run and kept up. Owners are pros."
6024337,team walleye,2018-02-24 21:16:00,336,Thank you for the info! Looks like a nice place. Glad to hear it's in a good location as well. Seems very affordable as well.
6024601,Baseline,2018-02-25 06:17:00,3207,"June 1 to 20 is an excellent time to fish this area of Rainy. Walleyes are piled up in the pinch points of Red Pine and the entrance to Porters Inlet and can also be found in the bays and reefs nearby. Crappies are in Porters Inlet, but this area is closed as a sanctuary until June 14th. SMB are close to the shorelines and usually very cooperative. Swell is also very good for SMB and walleyes will be in the east end. A long run to Grassy Narrows and Grassy Bay down Seine Bay is worthwhile for walleyes. We do best in the shallow water of the bay. There is enough water to keep you busy for years. Very scenic too."
