6064913,Ogoki,2018-03-16 06:50:00,291,"Bill, The outfitter we use , takes new large onion sacks, puts about 2 1/2 gallons of old cookies, granola, nuts in sack. Tops with a slurry of water jelly/ jam. Ties sack shut . We hang in tree at bait site. About 6 feet high. Bear stands up to get bag and we can judge size of bear. He gets 55 gallon barrels of scrap cookies etc from cookie bakers here in the US. The jelly is in 55 gallon barrels from Smukers. Works out well. He also has old Jet Puff marshmallow topping. My wife thinks the marshmallow topping is the real draw , as the bears lick that up first. Lord Willing we are headed there the end of May. Love the North Country."

We picked a location where it is going to get a good shot of the main lake. Aimed it to the west and covering a very narrow little land bridge that connects a good sized island to the mainland. I can't wait to pull that card in June, got my fingers crossed that it will have some interesting shots on it. It automatically tracks the sun setting and rising times and it's a pretty good cam with the best batteries I could find. Camp owner said the ones he sets up on the campo in the winter freeze up till spring. Anyone else ever do this? I'm hoping for hundreds of pis of Moose, Bear, Wolves, Caribou and maybe a Bigfoot! LOL"
6059441,JOE WALLEYE,2018-03-13 20:54:00,753,We set a couple out for the week while we are there. We have gotten pictures of bear and moose. Never thought of leaving one for the entire year. I hope you got some great shots. Good luck and share some of what you get.
6059569,Bill Krejca,2018-03-14 05:06:00,6107,"Great idea, also, be sure to share your pictures, can't wait. Bill"
6059657,Black Crown,2018-03-14 06:41:00,6,"That is a cool idea. I really hope it works for you and you are able to share them here. If you don't mind, I plan to steal your idea."
6059849,Jerryv,2018-03-14 07:59:00,1222,"A friend of mine forgot one near his deer stand one year. I think it took pictures for at least 10 months before the batteries died. It was pretty cool to rapidly scan through the pictures and see the seasons change, plants grow, etc. He was going to try to make a time lapse video out of it, but I don't think he ever figured out how to do it. Jerry"
6059945,Shellback,2018-03-14 08:32:00,8083,Was that your trailcam? Sorry I thought someone left it behind when I was up there in Dec. Send me your address and I'll get it back to you.. Just kidding!
6061185,stumcfar,2018-03-14 15:45:00,451,"You should have some great shots. The frigid temps drain batteries in a hurry, so it will be interesting to see when it finally died. You will need to post some of the better pics when you get at it!"
6061393,yoopertrout,2018-03-14 18:38:00,1172,That's a great idea. Post your pictures.
6064169,Live to jig,2018-03-15 19:23:00,159,I will post them for sure.
6064769,Ogoki,2018-03-16 05:48:00,291,"I would be curious to see your pictures also. One year i took the fish scrap about a mile from camp and dumped in new location . I placed a camera on it . Everyday dumped again. We had a large group and ate fish every night. End of week i checked camera. Had 4 mature bald eagle on camera everyday after first day. Amazing how well their eyesight is to pick that up from the air. We bear hunt at Armstrong and put cameras on the bear baits. It's interesting to check cameras. Dumped bear guts and put camera on it , not all that far from camp , where outfitter told me too. None had been dumped there before. Had wolves clean it up first night."
