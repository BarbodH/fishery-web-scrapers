6075817,Mojo-NC,2018-03-21 11:07:00,1929,"We've been fishing the Ear Falls area the last week of May or the first week of June for the last 14 years and it varies from year to year due to the ongoing weather pattern. We've experienced 90 degree weather one year and rain/sleet/snow on another. The colder it is, the shallower you'll find the fish. However, that time of the year I don't think we've ever had to go much deeper than 14 feet to catch 'em. I've personally always had the most success pulling spinner rigs, but that's kind of my area of specialty - jigs and crankbaits have worked well too. The one year we went opening weekend, we missed ice-out by a couple of days and the fish were still prespawn. They were all stacked up in a very small area early in the week. That year leeches worked best on spinner rigs slowly retrieved up the incline against the current at the mouth of the river where it enters the lake. Other years, minnows, crawlers, and leeches have all produced almost identical returns and the fish were more spread out amongst the various structure locations throughout the lake. As BornToFish pointed out, find a bay with some warmer water and some weeds or slightly different bottom structure and you'll be golden. Good luck! We'll be there again this year fishing June 2-7."
6075993,Golden Eagle,2018-03-21 12:04:00,2642,"I've fished the opener every year, missing only 2017, beginning in 1984. With ice still on the lake, as it has been for a few of my openers, I find them still in their spawning locations. When ice has been gone for a long time I found walleyes pretty much all over the lake. They'll be somewhere between spawning area and all over the lake. Lots of walleyes find their spring home near moving water that's between their spawning area and the lake. A few stay there all year.Fish go by nature's calendar, not the calendar on the wall.I'm arriving in camp on May 17 this year for 2 days of pike fishing before the walleye opener. Having broken ice on parts of the lake would make it ideal for me. I have a good idea where the big pike will be and when they'll be there. Same for walleyes. Ice out is a time of change and change happens fast. I'll be at a fly in lake, about 70 miles past Ear Falls.I'm looking forward to a great 2018. I've booked trips for May and mid July. A third trip will surely happen.I was expecting to come up with 4 fishermen for the opener, but our party has grown to 16. Eleven will be first timers. I've never met 10 of our group. I expect NW Ontario fishing camps to have their busiest season since around 2007. Fishermen are excited about their sport and they appear to be ready to spend money for their fun.Look for longer lines at the border crossing."
6077625,Whopper,2018-03-22 06:22:00,340,Bare jigs???? You act like you have witnessed this phenomenon before lol. Spring of 2008 and I wouldn't have believed it myself had I not lived it myself. It's one of those days on the water we as fisherman hope will happen but rarely if ever does.
6077913,Golden Eagle,2018-03-22 07:14:00,2642,"Yep, lots of good things happen when we spend time on the water. Some are hardly believable, that's why we hesitate to share. I've experience one afternoon of catching pike that most won't believe. I've had 3 days of solo walleye catching that I find hard to believe. I've experienced a day of pike fishing that people believe because 3 boats moved in close enough to observe and I still have guys coming to me in camp and telling me they watched us the day we caught all those huge pike on Suicks in 2-4 fow. I've had another day, when fishing alone and caught a 40+"" pike on the first cast at the first 3 locations. Same day made a cast, hooked a pike and my lab busted the water to retrieve the pike. A second big pike nipped my dog's tail as she swam toward my pike.Anybody doubt what I'm saying? Not a problem for me.Whopper continued to pound small to medium walleyes with his bare jig, until they stopped biting. When he lifted his jig a couple of feet off the bottom he hooked into big pike. With the pike released and out of the area, the walleye bite picked up again."
6078785,fishin10,2018-03-22 12:56:00,2315,In 53 days we will be heading north out of Cookeville with great anticipation. I hope my being a 1st timer does not jinx the expedition.Currently 38* at Red Lake Ont.
6073449,brett13,2018-03-20 13:06:00,51,"Hey guys, just wondering. What is everyones best tactic for catching walleyes this time of year. We have always had good luck pulling lindy rigs and spinners. Generally seems like, minnows and leeches catch more fish, but crawlers catch bigger fish. Tight lines, all!!!"
6073481,Wedge,2018-03-20 13:12:00,270,So we were on Pakwash last June. The walleye were stacked on sandy bottom shallows. Find any area that has a sandy bottom in 2-5 feet of water. We just slowly moved around at like .5mph and bounced Gold headed jigs tipped with minnows. Nothing else came close to being as productive. Find beach areas on the map - go there. Find cabbage weeds that end into sand at 3-5 feet - go there.
6074121,The tank,2018-03-20 16:57:00,340,we usually don't pull spinners till late June early July. may-june is mostly jigs or soft floaters like Phelps or lip stick with worms or big minnows.
6074417,BornToFish,2018-03-20 19:30:00,1224,"Greetings,I have some experience fishing a lake near Ear Falls during the opening week(s) of the open-water season. A key to my success during the opening weeks of the season has been finding warm water. ""Warm"" is a relative term. I look for water that might be just 0.5 degree warmer than surrounding water. As the season progresses into June, emergent vegetation (often found in ""warm"" water over sand) can be a key to success, as such vegetation can be a place for young baitfish to hide.Keys to finding ""warm"" water can be as simple as noticing the direction of the wind. Shorelines receiving wind and thus waves are often great places to look for walleyes early in the season. Shorelines having a feature (e.g. a cove or point) that concentrates warm surface water can be phenomenal. Another place to look for warm water is where streams empty into a lake.In most years, there isn't much ""warm"" water available to walleyes during the opening week of the season. The walleyes are often bunched up in relatively small areas of the lake - often near where they spawn. However, the water warms relatively quickly, such that the walleyes are quickly expanding into newly warming water. Thus, you may find yourself chasing walleyes. They might be in one spot this afternoon, and a half mile away the next day. So, be prepared to be on the move in early June as fishing yesterday's bite might be futile.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6074753,Golden Eagle,2018-03-20 21:53:00,2642,"Catching them will be easy. Locating them, not so easy.I don't know where they'll be, but unless you're fishing on opening day, the guys who were there before you will have a good idea where to start.Moving water, downstream from the spawning area will hold walleyes. Even though most walleyes passed through, there will be a few sticking around and there's a good chance that big pike are hanging around the walleyes, looking for a meal. If you run across a lot of walleyes, they might be eating bare jigs. No grub. No meat. Just a bare jig head. They might be small males."
6075281,tparker,2018-03-21 07:53:00,100,"Wedge, I sent you a PM."
6075313,Aspencreek,2018-03-21 08:18:00,2911,"Born, You read my mind. The fish are not going to be where you think they should be, they are going to be where they are. And finding them is the key, and start by finding warmer water. Dark bottom bays, spots with incoming water, sun exposed sand bottom shorelines. Your temp gauge on your locator is more important than the fish you are supposedly seeing on the graph. This time of year it can be hot for 10 min and then nothing for an hour, rinse and repeat."
6075617,brett13,2018-03-21 10:20:00,51,"thanks everyone. My dad and I have been going up the first weekend in June for the last 15 years. Locating the fish hasn't been an issue. I was just curious to see what other tactics people are using this time of year. Last year was a great year, we boated 564 walleyes in our week there. Hope y'all have a great year of fishing, and tight lines guys!"
6075681,stumcfar,2018-03-21 10:32:00,451,"We have fished the Ear Falls area as early as Memorial Weekend to mid-June. Depending on the year the mouth of the Wenesaga can be fantastic, anchoring and jigging. You will have company! Other years, shorelines that are sandy or pebbly with a little wind blowing in have been the best for us. Again we typically slow troll with jigs until we find fish or just drop anchor and jig, pitching towards shore. Often slip bobber fishing with a jig and minnow is fantastic also. A lot of people head into Sawmill and I have yet to find a good spot deeper in SawMill, even though many do well. We went a little closer to mi-June last year and it was very disappointing. The fishing was okay if you could find a spot. I have never seen so many boats in my life. All our tried and true spots usually had 2 to 4 boats anchored on them. If you did find a spot and got on fish, you had better stay because within a minute of pulling up anchor another boat was there. We are actually skipping Lac Seul this year to go on a fly in and try get away from the crowds. We will be back, but I prefer the Memorial Day time frame as there seems to be less people."
6075801,BornToFish,2018-03-21 11:02:00,1224,"Greetings,As I mentioned in my earlier post on this thread, my key strategy in the opening weeks of the season is to cover water to locate fish. Minnows will expand into newly warming water in search of their food. The walleyes invariably follow the minnows.I might use bottom bouncers or Lindy Rigs if I need to cover lots of water - e.g. along a long stretch of shoreline. If the stretch of shoreline is relatively shorter, I might go with slowly moving the boat along the shore and cast a crankbait.My key thought in the above scenarios is to cover water to locate fish. Once located, I almost always abandon the search technique and switch to a technique to catch fish. For example, I might anchor the boat where I located a school of fish and cast jigs or crankbaits to catch as many fish as I can before they move on to a new location.Lindy rigs and bottom bouncers along a shoreline are great search tools. However, I don't very often rely on them to catch fish, as it's about as easy to motor away from fish as it is to motor towards them. I am reminded of two elderly gentleman at the dock a few years ago that were pulling Lindy rigs. They said they were working a stretch of shoreline and kept catching fish each time they passed a rock outcroppings. I thought to myself, why not put the Lindy rigs away and just anchor in front of the rock outcropping where the fish were known to be located.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
