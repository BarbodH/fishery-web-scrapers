6061233,jabecker,2018-03-14 16:29:00,118,"I just booked My September trip to Coppens for next year. Been in touch with Kelly and with Erik and from what I have seen on their website my wife and I have decided to go there. We usually travel 500 miles to another resort in September to fish, but I wanted more of a chance to catch larger walleyes on a more consistent basis. I usually caught 300 to 350 walleyes per week at the other resort with the largest being a about 25 inches. I am hoping to catch more larger walleyes and may have to sacrifice quantity to catch quality. The cabins are completely furnished and we are only 25 miles from Fort Francis or International Falls to be able to do other things. I like the atmosphere of smaller resorts and Coppens fit the bill."
6046321,jabecker,2018-03-07 15:10:00,118,"Has anyone fished out of Coppens Resort on Rainy Lake? Looking to try a different lake to fish in the fall. I have my own boat, a ranger 620. Any other resorts to consider. Looking to fish mainly Walleyes, but wouldn't mind catching some crappies, perch, or smallies."

6046617,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-07 16:55:00,8293,I see the Stokes Bay boat on the Ash River Trail all the time picking up clients. I've never been there but intend to head up that way fishing this summer.
6046713,jabecker,2018-03-07 17:43:00,118,Its a little to rustic for my wife. She needs indoor facilities and likes her privacy for women things. She wants a drive to place. Any other resort options on rainy that anyone has been to or recommends?
6046745,camp chef,2018-03-07 18:04:00,915,We stay at the Thunderbird the night before we cross the border...many times.....very nice great food ...lots of nice things. we will be staying there in late May before we head up to the Winnipeg River.

6047865,jabecker,2018-03-08 08:01:00,118,Anyone been to Labelles. Saw their web site and it looks interesting. Anybody been there or have any thoughts on it?
6048065,Bergy,2018-03-08 09:03:00,83,"We were at LaBelles with our family and my sisters family last July. My wife and kids were along. The cabins are very outdated. They have all the amenities, but need updates and cleaning. The fish cleaning shack needs cleaning and updating. The docking is pretty nice and protected. They do have gas in cans at the dock and bait. The fishing was decent, but not outstanding for Walleyes."
6049313,DaBirdman,2018-03-08 18:31:00,164,"Been going to LaBelle's for 40 years. Was there last July as well, actually we always go in July. We like the cabins mostly. They don't have TV, phones, or things like that which is what we like because we wish to get away from all that. It's all available at the lodge though. The docks by the cabins are nice and protected by a rock wall built years ago after a bad storm tore up all our boats. Cleaning shack is older than me, but serves it's purpose. They do bring full gas cans down to the dock for you, but I just pull the boat out, pull it up to the pumps & refill with gas. Takes about 20 minutes. Fishing last year was tougher in NW bay. Maybe because of the early spring. Bigger walleyes in NW bay, but huge numbers of fish 12-20 miles out...hardly a boat out that far. Fish after fish, many doubles, but size was smaller (eaters). Good smallie fishing in NW bay too if that's your thing. Found walleyes on reefs in NW bay, but most were REAL TIGHT to the weeds. Mostly 22-25""ers with a 26.5 & 28 last year. Great scenery all over the place. LaBelle's isn't too big so not a bunch of traffic either. Most of the time you can be all by yourself but sometimes curious George shows up. We love the place, hence why we've been going there for 40 years. The owners are kinda quiet, but nice & cordial."
6049361,Carnhzkr,2018-03-08 18:49:00,964,"Check out Camp Narrows. It's a boat in resort. You put in at LaBelles and it's around 7 miles out from there. Cabins have flush toilets and showers and the camp is close to good fishing and seven miles closer to the main part of the lake than LaBelles. My wife enjoyed it. If I were going back to Rainy, I'd go back to CN."
