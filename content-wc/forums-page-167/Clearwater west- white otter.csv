6061265,PRO-V16,2018-03-14 16:54:00,454,One bunch of 10 family members go every February and keep count and average over 200 trout in 3 days the last several years running and they are not bs'rs. Four friends just made a quick run in there on the way home from Lac Seul and caught four in 2 hours. And that was the slowest trip they've had so far.
6036393,cw21,2018-03-02 22:22:00,3,"A buddy and I are headed to Clearwater west and white otter in a week for lake trout. This is our first trip to Ontario for Lakers, what kind of depth should we be looking for, and are there some decent lake maps in atikokan? What kind of numbers should we expect per day? Any other pointers you guys would want to throw our way to help us out would be greatly appreciated!"
6036769,Beer King,2018-03-03 07:17:00,146,"Im jealous, I expect you will have a great time. Have fished WO annually in summer for many years, both lakes are great lake trout waters. Sorry, no winter fishing experience to offer but Navionics web app does have Clearwater West mapped - can't vouch for accuracy. There are no depth maps available for WO that I am aware of. Paper topo maps should be available in Atikokan - tourist center where you turn into town (if open), ranger station in town, or one of the outfitters in town. Browns could have them too. If you have not been there before and do fish WO, make sure to take a run over to see the castle. Good Luck Dan"
6039233,PRO-V16,2018-03-04 16:29:00,16,"I would fish shoreline related structure in the 30' to 50' range. Look for shelves, walls, reefs. We only give an area roughly a half hour or so. If no fish sighted or strikes we move on looking for active fish. When we find a good area it usually holds multiple fish. We use tubes, blade baits and spoons. White is generally our favorite color but it pays to try others at times."
6039585,cw21,2018-03-04 19:07:00,3,Any one know if the south end or north end of white otter is better fishing for trout? What about walleye?
6052233,123chadder,2018-03-10 18:57:00,429,lakers prefer water temps between 50-54 degrees...we use a depth therm to find the proper depth in that temp range.. what is the date of your trip?
6052281,PRO-V16,2018-03-10 19:08:00,16,That's interesting Chadder but where we are catching in winter it can't possibly be that warm. The active ones will be where the food is. I doubt the water can be that warm at 30'. I'll have to bring my deptherm with me next time and check where we are catching fish.
6052537,123chadder,2018-03-11 03:07:00,429,"oh sorry,i thought it was in summer"
6052577,PRO-V16,2018-03-11 05:40:00,454,No problem
6059921,cw21,2018-03-14 08:21:00,3,"We ended with 11 fish for 2 guys over 3 days of fishing. We caught 6 of them the first day within the first few hrs of fishing, then the rest of the trip was a grind. It was our first time fishing lakers so not sure what a good number is, but after the first we thought it was pretty slow. What are average number s for lake trout? I know it depends on multiple factors but curious if it's worth going back or should we look for another place to go? Thanks"
6060329,PRO-V16,2018-03-14 09:59:00,454,It's a crapshoot. I've been on trips where guys got 4 or 5 apiece a day and one guy would only get 1 or 2 all weekend. That suggestion of going to Manitou is a good one. I have several friends that go there and they can sometimes get 10 or more a day per guy. One of the better places I've heard of.
