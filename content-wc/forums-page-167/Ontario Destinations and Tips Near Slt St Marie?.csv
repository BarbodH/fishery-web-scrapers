We go for 5 days in June, and 5 days in August the past couple years. The only people to fish with are my mom in her 70s, and my 5 and 6 years old boys. We have my boat (17ft Aluminum) and catch some fish but not much in numbers. Does anyone have any suggestions on what and where to be trying in the main St Joes River sections? Im also looking for some lakes in this area of Ontario (Algoma region?) that are worth making a day trip to. There are many lakes in that area, Im just not sure which ones are worth going to, or if staying connected to big water is better. Thanks in advance. Even a catch and release only lake if the fishing is good, as we rarely seem to keep anything."

I'm limited to about an hour or so from Slt Ste Marie or St Joes Island since we already will be at the destination on the St joes island. Seems to me there should be good fishing around the island, Im just not sure about the where and how too much. There are countless small protected bays and many small channels with good current, just not sure how to fish them well either. Im good with any species, but I would probably choose to focus on walleye and smallmouth, or perch if we could find any..."
