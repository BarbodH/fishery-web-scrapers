6015681,btyreprich,2018-02-20 16:20:00,1067,Thanks for the update. Guess Pat will reach out to us guests or perhaps it will be the new owner. Our group wishes Pat the best - just a great lady and fine host.
6015753,Skywagon,2018-02-20 16:48:00,1106,Somebody local buy it?
6018241,Skywagon,2018-02-21 18:02:00,1106,"I guess that answers my question on who bought it, figured."
6018345,prov1800,2018-02-21 18:37:00,5010,I never asked who bought it.i just asked if it was sold.ill find out tomorrow and let you know.most likely it won't be a local.

6028625,Guest,2018-02-27 03:04:00,0,Any news on the sale of the camp? Tried calling Patti but got no answer.
