Targeting walleye, numbers over size, northern, and perch or lakers would be a bonus but not necessary.4 people going. Want a flyin to a one cabin lake. 7 day trip (Saturday to Saturday). Around $900 to $1300 per person. Looking for info on Manitoba. Live near Milwaukee. 10-15 hour drive acceptable. Looking to go in summer or fall Give me your thoughts please. Kitchi island outpost caught my eye."
6045257,bthomas3333,2018-03-07 08:20:00,465,Hey - I have actually been looking for something similar for a Sept trip. I have my eye on the outposts associated with Saslodge. The outposts are on Charron and Apisko Lakes. They fly directly out of a float base 10 miles North of Winnipeg. The drive from S WI to Winnipeg should be around 12 hours. Then you would be flown directly to the outposts which both look pretty remote. The rates on the website are in CAD and you pay for the cabin and the flights in and out separately. When you add the ~1000CAD per person for the cabin and ~600CAD for the flights you should be around that 1300 USD.http://saslodge.comHere's the thing. I have no directly experience with this lodge other than to say they have a good reputation. I do know this area of MB has nice sized walleyes and big pike their main lodge turns out a number of Master Anglers every year. They have brand new boats. So some real positives but do your homework.B-

6045369,bthomas3333,2018-03-07 09:01:00,465,Was thinking the same thing. Someone must have said or thought...$#$@%ing docks. Sick and tired of the #$@%ing docks. I want the best #$%@ing dock in the entire country. No more $#%@ing around. Then they built that. LOL B
6045729,KSjim,2018-03-07 11:14:00,88,Jackson's Lodge and Outpost fly's out of Lac du Bonnet in southern Manitoba. They are a good outfitter with a lot of good lakes.
6051801,BreezyPoint,2018-03-10 13:46:00,1581,"It's been quite a few years, but I flew into Sassaginigak Lake in the early 90s. Caught 100s of walleyes and saw a 48 inch northern caught. Probably the best fishing I ever had. My company, believe it or not paid for the trip as a bonus. That was in the days when they appreciated their employees. This was a fly-in.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

Free safe parking right at their base at St Andrews airport. Every bed got a new mattress 2 years ago; the lodge and outpost all got brand new 16.5 ft boats last year with brand new electric start Yamaha's. Just built the brand new cabins within the past 2 years. The fishing is incredible; the camp is great. And yes, their dock system is a reflection of how they run a business. It's set up that way for 3 float planes to utilize, and the golf cars can load and unload planes without having to try to turn around on a dock. The pilots will show you where to fish as you fly into the camp. I'm in no way affiliated with them; I work at the airport that they fly out of. Call Bonnie at the their number. It's remote; they are the only camp on the lakes."
