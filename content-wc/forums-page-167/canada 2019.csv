It took about a day and a half to find the walleye. Northern were easy. The walleye bite was just generally slow for all camps that week. Biggest walleye that week was 27 inch. Bigges northern was 38. The thing that bugged me was the insane amount of snags in that system.
6050209,wmd,2018-03-09 10:40:00,388,"We went to Blackbirch Lake with Amik outposts in May of 2016. I told the guys I was with after the first day that I would not go back to that lake because it was too small and would be full of small fish. I was WRONG about that. 4 of us in 5 days caught about 1000 walleyes with lots of fish 20-26 inches. We caught some dinks but not too many, without that the fish can't get big. John and Rena were very good to work with and the cabin was very satisfactory. They do a very good job of keeping you informed of the fishing throughout the summer on John's blog. I would not hesitate to use them again. wmd"
6050361,eyegator,2018-03-09 12:49:00,29,Kabeelo lodge is very well run family resort- excellent walleye numbers on most all of their lakes

6036073,smithcr1981,2018-03-02 17:54:00,42,"i am working on getting a group of buddies together for a trip in summer or fall of 2019. two of the people have never been on a flyin before. one guy has been on one before. I have been one three. two of them I was the group planner/leader. I have been to Kay Air twice and Mattice lake once. both excellent outfitters. birch lake with kay air was very good fishing. the two time at kay air we stayed on birch lake, once in late june and once in early September. then went to mattice and stayed on short lake, part of the ogoki reservoir. took a couple days but finally found the fish. I would go with mattice again but that ogokki reservoir SUCKS. places I'm looking at for 2019 are :kay air, mattice, chimo, Canadian fly infishing in red lake. just wanted some thoughts or feed back. we are looking to spend between 900 and 1300. 10-15 hour drive from Milwaukee is fine. and a place with hot/cold running water and shower. I want numbers over size for walleye. a chance at 35 inch plus northerns, and maybe lake trout. thanks"

The lakes with outposts from Amik Outposts, Big Hook and Sportsman's Lodge would be top considerations for me and I believe all within your price range. Mattice Lake Outfitters always gets rave reviews. I'd definitely consider their other camps."
6036449,onetimedave,2018-03-03 04:22:00,502,"Look at the outfitters in the Nakina, Ontario area. Brace Lake, Boreal Forest Outfitters, and others."
6036529,smithcr1981,2018-03-03 05:56:00,42,I'm glad I have a lot of time to make a decision. so far the one that peaks my interest is amik outposts. if anyone has any personal stories about them please share. I know that at the end of the day no matter where I pick it is still fishing and anything can happen. I think I am leaning more towards a medium size lake with no other cabins on it. thanks for any and all advice and tips.
6036825,kona77,2018-03-03 07:53:00,236,"Our group has been using Clarks resorts for the last 6-7 years. Have fished 4 of their lakes and had outstanding fishing each time. Wayne/Karla are always updating their facilities and equipment and go out of their way tomake sure their quests are having a good trip. We are mainly walleye fisherman but have caught numerous 40"" Northern's on two of their lakes.I live north of Milw. and would be happy to provide any other information.(free minnows are another nice bonus with the Clarks)..I see a lot of positive feedback about Mattice and they appear to have a lot of repeat quests. We did fish Cherrington Lake (one of Amik's lakes) with another outfitter but lost our spot when the other current outfitter on Cherrington took over.. Cherrington is an outstanding walleye lake with a chance to catch some laker's.."
6036881,Bstar,2018-03-03 08:39:00,564,We went to Amik's Cobham Lake Morley outpost in 2011. Walleye numbers and size were outrageous. Cobham is known for big pike too but we didn't see any that week. They do have another outpost about 5 miles away but we only seen one other boat all week. They also have the Cobham river outpost which is pretty far away from the lake outposts. The nice thing about Cobham is that there is a ton of water to fish but being a river system it doesn't get blown up by high winds. I would like to go back someday. John and Rena have a nice operation and will take care of you.We went to Slate Falls Outpost's Miniss East outpost last year and had a great time. Walleye numbers and big pike. Awesome camp with endless possibilities to fish. Verne and Ryan run a tight ship and their camps show it. They have a great July and August rate on Miniss also. We are booked with them in 2019. You might want to check out their Hooker Lake camp. Smaller water and only camp on the lake.There are so many good camps and outfitters out there that trying to pare it down to one is sometimes hard to do. Good luck.
6037281,prov1800,2018-03-03 14:35:00,5010,Clarke's has just recently purchased annishinabi lodge which has some great lake trout and big pike action.and many portage walleye lakes close to main camp.
6040265,KSjim,2018-03-05 07:51:00,88,Our group has had many good trips over the years with Loon Haunt Outposts out of Red Lake. Unnamed and Goose are the two lakes we have fished with them. Would highly recommend both.
6040457,Stauff,2018-03-05 08:57:00,110,"I'm one of those that's a repeat with Mattice AND absolutely love the Ogoki Reservoir!! It took us a day or two on our first fly-in trip to the reservoir years ago to figure out just how this Canadian fishing scene worked, but once we did, game on. Ted Pelletier has been the camp manager at Ogoki the past few years, and you won't find a better resource or person to work with anywhere! Ted's goal is to make certain that every person leaves with a smile on their face and a huge desire to return! You're on your own at Short Lake, which does take some time to adapt to. Don't be too quick to write off a return trip with Mattice. Don and Annette have always been the most gracious hosts and I'm sure would love to have a second chance at your best fishing trip ever! Talk to them!!"
