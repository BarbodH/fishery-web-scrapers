However, if you look at a lot of Salmon Spoons, which are very often single hooks, they are pointing down. However, they are usually trolling spoons with little curvature so it's likely to matter much less on a flutter type spoon. WIthout doing a bunch of math, who knows...lol.It probably doesn't really matter. I pointed mine up and successfully caught fish. So, I am content with that."
5968618,Mike Borger,2018-01-27 04:55:00,1554,"That's a really good answer. I haven't given nearly as much thought to it as Adam, but I always point the hook up."
5979442,fldoc1,2018-02-01 20:35:00,69,"I try to use the single hooks as much as possible on most of my northern casting spoons especially when throwing into cabbage. In Manitoba barbs must be removed and I find that I really like using the barbless single hooks as easier on the fish. I do not feel I lose more fish because I use mostly barbless, single hooks. I have never given much thought to which way the hooks are turned so will think about that. I typically have used the gold/silver combo but orange has always been a good casting color. I will need to get the hammered orange / copper combo. Randy from duluth"
6055497,turkeyriver,2018-03-12 12:01:00,80,"OK, so i ordered some Doctor spoons and want to replace the trebles. I got 5/0 Siwash open eye hooks. Do I just squeeze them onto the split ring? I don't remove the split ring? Why did I get the open eye if I'm going to use the split ring? Haven't even thought about which way to turn the hook!!!"
6055545,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-12 12:16:00,8293,Leave the split ring on. Be sure you squeeze the eye as tight as you can get it. Hook up or down.....I haven't really thought about that.
6055561,BornToFish,2018-03-12 12:22:00,1224,"Greetings,I concur with the Minnesota Guy. I leave the split ring in place, to minimize the chance of a fish getting leverage on me to shake the hook. I carefully put the open eye hook in a vise on my workbench and gently squeeze the eye shut. I then install the hook on the split ring.I too haven't given much though to hook up or hook down. I will pay attention this season and see if any trends develop in terms of hook position and hookups or swing/misses.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5957994,BornToFish,2018-01-21 06:54:00,1224,"Greetings,I read a thread on this forum about one year ago that pertained to using doctor spoons when casting for northern pike. I picked up three or so doctor spoons (4.5 inches) in the color schemes that were recommended on this thread. They worked as advertised.Mike Borger particularly recommended the 4.5 inch long doctor spoon in a hammered copper finish with a orange swirl, for use when fishing stained water. He knows what he is talking about! That lure must just make them mad, as my lure is missing a fair amount of paint that is not due to hook rash.One thing that attracted me to this casting spoon is that I can add a rubber twister tail without killing the action of the spoon. I previously tried adding the rubber tail to other brands of spoons and noticed that the lure suddenly became a wet rag when coming through the water.I was planning to purchase several more spoons while attending the All Canada Show in Green Bay, WI. Unfortunately, the vendor was not at the show. Thus, I called Yellow Bird Products in Illinois and placed an order for several of the 4.5 inch original doctor spoons. They offer free shipping on orders over $50 and same day shipping.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5958138,Mike Borger,2018-01-21 08:03:00,1554,"Worth mentioning, on some of my Doctor spoons I've swapped out the treble with 5/0 and 6/0 open eye siwash hooks.The siwash works wonderfully if you want to tip it with an oversized grub, something I do quite often. Much better than tipping a treble hook with a grub..."
5958154,andreindy,2018-01-21 08:04:00,308,Could anyone share what size siwash hook (and even a specific brand) they have used successfully with the 4.5 inch spoons? Using the plastics as a trailer intrigues me and maintaining the integrity of the pike's mouth afterwards intrigues me even more!
5958170,andreindy,2018-01-21 08:05:00,308,"Mike, you and I must have submitted at practically the same time. Thank you for the info sir!"
5958226,Doublelung76,2018-01-21 08:37:00,42,"Just ordered 8 a few days ago,Williams wabler has been my go to for years but can't wait to try them out on my fly in to hebert, between hauling in the wallies,u can't beat yellow birds free shipping over $50,great incentive to buy more than 1 or 2,thanks for all the great input Mr borger"
5958826,BornToFish,2018-01-21 13:17:00,1224,"Greetings,I followed Mike Borger's recommendation last season and used Gamakatsu Siwash (open eye) single hooks in size 6/0. I was quite pleased with this size hook and would not go smaller than size 5/0. I used some plastic tails from Esox Assault Tackle called Killer Tails. They have two models in a wide variety of colors. One model is for single hooks. The other model is for treble hooks. On both models, there is a channel built into the body of the tail that will accommodate the eye/shaft of the hook. These are easy to put on the hook. They are mostly marketed for the musky world.Most of the lures that I recently ordered will wear single hooks. I found that they were fairly weed-proof, hooked and held the fish very well, and were easy to remove.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5958978,andreindy,2018-01-21 14:29:00,308,Perfect. That is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you again.
5968082,Mojo-NC,2018-01-26 13:25:00,1929,"One last question - when you switched out the standard treble hooks with a single 6/0 hook on the Doctor Spoons, the Siwash hooks are placed on the ring with the hook pointing up right? The weedless versions of the spoons all have the hooks pointing down. Or does it even matter?"
5968146,BornToFish,2018-01-26 14:25:00,1224,"Greetings,I checked my Doctor spoons and noticed that I have all of the hook points towards the shiny (non-painted) side of the spoon. My reasoning is that the painted side of the spoon should generally be facing downward in the water column. The shiny side of the spoon should be facing towards the surface of the water. I wanted the point of the hook facing upwards, so that the hook gets buried in the top jaw when I set the hook.Maybe it doesn't even matter as the spoon wobbles side to side as it comes through the water on the retrieve.Mojo - you asked a great question. I look forward to hearing the thoughts of others on this question. It might be that I should have one half of the hooks facing the painted side and the other half towards the non-painted side. This way, at least half of them would be right!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5950746,BornToFish,2018-01-16 14:09:00,1224,"Greetings,I will be attending the All Canada Show in Green Bay this weekend. Thorne Brothers normally has a significant presence at this show. I'm thinking of picking up a few more Doctor Spoons in 4.5 inches. What are your favorite color schemes when casting for northern pike?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5950786,That Minnesota guy,2018-01-16 14:20:00,8293,"I like Gold, Red & White. But to be honest I troll more with the Doctor spoons then cast with them."
5950810,camp chef,2018-01-16 14:30:00,915,I like blue and silver
5950850,Golden Eagle,2018-01-16 14:47:00,2642,"Choose a color that matches what pike have, available for them to eat, in the lake you're fishing."
5950938,Mike Borger,2018-01-16 15:25:00,1554,In general the hammered orange and copper color is my favorite specially in tannin stained waters.Last season the pink and white swirl color was lethal on a couple of trips in crystal clear water. It's a new favorite now.
5951050,bthomas3333,2018-01-16 16:21:00,465,x2 for the hammered orange and copper. Last summer was a stained lake and it yield several 40+.B-
5951410,adempsey2.0,2018-01-16 19:38:00,612,"Don't think you can go wrong with the Five of Diamonds Red/Chartreuse, Perch and Firetiger patterns either. I would just be sure to have a couple of each with a silver back, gold back and copper back. If you already have a lot of other spoons in silver/gold, get more copper."
5952802,Thompmd,2018-01-17 17:26:00,320,"The hammered orange and copper 4 1/2"" 1 3/16oz is $5.13 at Walmart."
5956818,yoopertrout,2018-01-20 10:19:00,1172,"I've never used a doctor spoon. I went to their website and see that there are a bunch of different styles. What do you recommend for casting? The original? The casting spoon? Also, what length do you recommend?"
5957026,Mike Borger,2018-01-20 11:56:00,1554,"Yes, the original. 99% of the time I'm throwing the 41/2"" version."
