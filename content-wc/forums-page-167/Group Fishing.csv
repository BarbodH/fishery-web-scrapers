6028121,jaym,2018-02-26 17:42:00,89,We normally split up but try to stay within eyesight or walkie talkie range in case someone needs help.
6032185,valley366,2018-02-28 18:55:00,193,When I went with a group of 6 (3 boats) we had a general schedule each day. The place we went had the main lake and basically 3 other bodies of water to fish. The 3 other bodies of water involved navigating a channel and culvert from the main lake.Each day we had a designated lake we would start on and fish in the same general area together until lunch. Same general area usually meant within sight of the other boats or let the group know they were head further up the system. We would either run all the way to the distant lake we were fishing or fish along the way.We usually had a designated spot we would stop for shore lunch depending on wind and what part of the lake we expected to fish on. We ate lunch together and split up some in the afternoon. Usually letting the others know where they were going and if we left the body of water we were on where they were going. Usually each group would fish their way back to camp hitting various spots along the way. If anyone was going back to camp early they let the others know and we usually established a time to be back at the dock for dinner.
6032209,Live to jig,2018-02-28 19:17:00,159,"With GPS the risk of getting lost is really not an issue, we all have maps on board as well. We always kind of give the general area we will be headed and if there is an excursion everyone knows what the plan is. The rule is if you break down, get to a main point and build a fire if it looks like it is going to stretch into darkness. Couple of years ago I got up at 5am while the wife slept in, went around the 1st point headed out to the lake and there a group on a tiny island waving be in. they hit a rock and only had a trolling motor. They asked where camp was and I said just around that point...surprise you can't see the light....they were pissed lol I towed them in they looked very uncomfortable on that rock!"
6035153,northernbite,2018-03-02 08:48:00,1186,We split up but are good about keeping in touch. Some time we get spread out and somebody can reach one of us to see where so and so is. I'm big on going off on my own. But I'll fish with in 400 yards of somebody if we are fishing 2 different areas of lake.Paul
6044601,Rock Hound,2018-03-06 21:17:00,51,"We usually trade up fishing partners throughout the week, but on a daily basis will communicate where we will try and use radios to communicate. If someone gets on a super hot bite, we share info. We usually plan all meals together and will usually compare notes / game plan and boats usually will go at least in pairs or stay in the same vicinity. We have had a few break downs over the years, etc. - we are on a pretty big body of water, so you don't want to be alone, especially at sundown... We at least make sure people know the area we are going if we do separate. We fish quite hard, about 12 hours a day, so most of our visiting happens in the boats either by switching partners or fishing close together."
6051001,Mrxlh,2018-03-09 19:49:00,210,"We stay together when we fish Lac Seul, all the other lakes we go our separate ways, we also switch partners every day as well. Like others have mentioned we talk/agree on what time we are going to meet at the fish cleaning shack so we know if we need to go look for someone. We used to use radios, but they typically don't have the range you need to work well."
6052057,DaBirdman,2018-03-10 17:35:00,164,"We've been going to Rainy Lake for many years and we all split up in our own separate boats. Often times we are within walkie distance of at least one boat. Sometimes not. We sort of set a time to fire up grills & get food/beverage going. If one boat isn't back for that, there'd be cause for concern. Knock on wood it's never been a problem. I like to venture out 15-30 miles at times & when I do, I make darn good & sure my dad knows what route we're taking and the areas we're fishing, and a ""No later than"" time we'll be back. This year some of us are doing a fly-in trip. And we'll be staying within sight distance, or good walkie distance of each other."
6026225,Baseline,2018-02-25 17:50:00,3207,Does your group fish together or do they go their separate ways? The boats in my group always split up and only occasionally occupy the same spot.
6026345,Pooch,2018-02-25 19:08:00,4618,"In the early years our boats all stayed together. After a couple trips we all went our separate ways, but always try to let the other boats know about where we will be fishing that day. Now with all of us having marine band radios we scatter right out of the chute then meet back at the cabin for lunch at a preset time. If a boat is late then we pay attention and try to contact them. Usually when one boat heads in to camp or is going to make long run to a distant part of the lake we contact at least one other of our boats.Unless we have a new member boat on the trip, it makes me more than crazy to have a shadow boat. All of our guys are experienced, responsible and are quite self sufficient. Even the new members scatter after the first day or two.New to a lake or inexperienced groups should at least stay close initially. With close being mostly within view. Spending the night lost or broken down is very over rated. Running out of fuel and being lost sucks at best. Have seen camps put out a all on call lookout for a missing boat. Found them a day later totally in the wrong part of the lake from where they thought they were. Out of fuel, hungry, thirsty, bug bit and not in a good humor other than for being found.Over the years have helped a couple lost boats and out of fuel boats. Some day it could be any of us.Pooch"
6026449,Mojo-NC,2018-02-25 20:08:00,1929,"We all use camp boats and we set up a fishing partner schedule before we leave so that we each switch fishing partners every day. This year we have 8 guys, so everyone gets to fish with everyone else in the group except one. However, if someone wants to switch, or if 2 guys want to get together and go to an outlake for the day, they can always trade. We sometimes go to the same location and fish together with our other camp boats, but it's generally not because we plan it that way. We go to different areas and use techniques that were successful to one or the other guy in the boat earlier in the week. That way we all get a chance to learn our fishing partner's techniques and fish the areas that have been productive for both guys. It's win-win. Some guys like to chase pike and others prefer to focus mostly on walleyes. We usually fish early, then come back and have a nice breakfast and discuss strategy for the day. We go back out and fish until it's time to come in for dinner. The guys scheduled to cook have to come back in a little early and we rotate the cooking schedule too. It all works out pretty well. We're also pretty flexible if someone wants to switch things up a little."
6027193,vteye3,2018-02-26 09:23:00,496,"I found a bewildered fellow on the Gouin resv Quebec who got lost. He had spent a rough night, seemed disorientated, etc. There is a lot to be said for staying together."
6027257,Aspencreek,2018-02-26 09:37:00,2911,"We will all fish in a general area with a pre-set place we will all meet at lunchtime, we have our shorelunch spots. And then we have a large sand flat we call 5 o'clock hump where we all meet up between 5-6 pm fish it for a while and then head in for dinner. It is reassuring to know that if somebody did get in trouble or ""confused"" we can locate them without to much trouble. (had a guy go into an area and got turned around) Having to spend a night on an island would not be my idea of a good time, although we did find one a few years ago. The poor guy wrecked his lower unit on a really nice rig, and he and his wife was out there all night. We towed him back in to camp (ours) and when we hit the dock the wife raced to the cabin, and never saw her again the rest of the week. I have to believe that she doesn't do Fishing trips to Canada anymore."
6027345,Pooch,2018-02-26 10:39:00,4618,"Yea, unintentionally spending the night on an island with your wife would have very different long term ramifications than doing the same with a fishing buddy.Need to avoid the wife/island thingy at all costs..................Pooch"
6027465,mjayn,2018-02-26 11:37:00,1188,We would split up. Then we would either meet somewhere or talk on the walkie talkies(or cell phones if they worked) and decide where to go(together) for the evening fishing. Usually going to meet whomever was doing the best that day.
6027569,Mojo-NC,2018-02-26 13:05:00,1929,"Wow, I hadn't really thought about getting lost thing or having an unintentional breakdown while fishing big water. It would be much more important to make sure everyone knew where you were in that case. I guess I was thinking about the lake we fish, which is a relatively small lake compared to Lac Seul or a large river system. We decided to skip dinner one night because we had a tough day and finally got into some really nice fish. They came out to find us and were not very happy upon arrival to find that we were just fishing. In retrospect, that was a pretty stupid and inconsiderate thing we did. If that were to happen to anyone in the group now, a check-in would occur."
6027593,stumcfar,2018-02-26 13:26:00,451,"We usually go in the same general vicinity. If someone is going off somewhere different, they usually check in with the others. Just nice to know in case of a breakdown or a storm, where people are at. If we are on fish, it is fun to have our two, three boats catching, bragging and joking with each other."
6027833,Bill Krejca,2018-02-26 15:37:00,6107,Yes we do. Bill
