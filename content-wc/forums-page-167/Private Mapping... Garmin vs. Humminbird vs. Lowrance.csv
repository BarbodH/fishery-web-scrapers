CMAPS is a dominant player in digital cartography and mapping software worldwide, so I'm not sure why you'd be too concerned about Genesis going away. If nothing else, the database of mapping data that they've built up has value, someone will always see that value. I've heard rumours CMAPs has a ""live"" version of Genesis in the works. I'm really hoping they do and that it has the ability to incorporate your existing map data. That would be awesome for Lowrance users. Another option for you that I've tried and had very good success with is the Navionics Sonar Chart Live. Rather than switching brands, stick with what you know, keep your existing Genesis mapping, and just spend $200 on a Navionics+ card. Sonar Charts live works very well and would give you another independent map source. Waxy"
5918042,BobOregon2017,2017-12-29 23:44:00,3,"[QUOTE=wnafabrication;5911794]Looking at making the switch from Lowrance to either Humminbird or Garmin. With the instability and seemingly steady ownership change in (Insight genesis, genesis maps, C-Map Genesis etc... What will it be called next) I have lost all confidence in this system. For me I have an issue with Lowrance not being in control of the mapping software. Not to mention they now want $25/month for the mapping or $100/yr (im in Canada so id be monthly)I don't know anything about Genesis. I have owned Garmin and Humminbird and have done mapping on both.We had a Garmin EchoMap 94SV. Did map recording and it did a good job. Wide path covering a lot of area as I went back and fourth. I also was able to download from Garmin's web site map that Garmin users submitted. I got most of what I needed to record and added to that.The Garmin EchoMap side imaging wasn't very good. Had other owners of the unit tell me their side imaging was good. Never seen it. That was one of the primary features I wanted on a new unit. I sold it and got the Humminbird. Wish I could take all the good features and put into one.Humminbird Helix G2N I tried the AutoChart Live and added to the Zero Lines card and backed up the data I recorded. I was a bit disappointed in that the recording was done with a narrow path. I was told that it is more accurate. I think that is a total BS story. Garmin did a wide path and it worked great.The Zero Lines card is $100. AutoChart PC is $200, AutoChart PC is $250Zero Lines card if it goes bad you have to buy a new one. If you accidently mess it up you have to pay $25 to have it fixed by Humminbird. You can only view recorded maps with the Zero Lines card.Garmin recording maps is all free. Just buy a standard 32GB Mini SD Card. Put everything on it and back up and put on another 32GB Mini SD Card. Fill it buy another one. Also software you can download free and use with your maps.Humminbird support told me if I wanted a wider path I could use AutoChart PC or AutoChart Pro. Both require you to do a Sonar Recording. You also can record with the dual beam 83/200. It is now called Medium/High Frequency, Medium Frequency or High Frequency. The default is the High Frequency. I bought the AutoChart PC which doesn't include bottom hardness and Side Image Mosaic. We got out once and I did the sonar recording and converted with AutoChart PC software on my Windows 10 PC. Worked good a little bit of a pain but results good. I also used another program that takes all the side imaging and you can view separate pictures of your side imaging recording. Going through the picture I came across one showing three tires on the bottom that I didn't see before."
5949442,wnafabrication,2018-01-15 19:30:00,9,"I had a big long reply that didn't end up posting for some reason. Here's the jist of it...Humminbird, Garmin, Lowrance all have some pros and cons but I believe that Garmin has my needs covered and the cons list of the other brands outweigh what the pros of the Garmin are.Humminbird mapping requires a zero lines card on top of the price. And you can't just copy it to keep a backup in case sh*t happens.Lowrance you need sonar chart live which requires a navionics card plus subscription or a unit that is wifi and use the boating app on your phone or iPad.All of this really makes me frustrated... why do I have to pay for a stupid micro SD, a subscription, share my logs in exchange for being nickel and dimed... Hey here's an idea...let me use my own Micro sd, back up MY data, not pay to keep my data private, let me fish my remote lake without taking my iPad, iPhone, wifi, internet, upload download, convert, run this program etc....GARMIN! Yes. Thank the lord... I will be purchasing a Garmin EchoMAP 95sv for $950Can and require nothing else. No programs, no wifi, no fees, no subscriptions. And from what I can see, the Panoptics is way better for fishing than 360 imaging. I'm open to reasons why I should change my mind and would love to hear about your opinions on this!"
5950050,prov1800,2018-01-16 08:22:00,5010,Sorry boys.i was reading your input on the electronics your talking about and you lost me.dont have a clue what your talking about.i have a combo lowrance unit that I turn on and that's it.i have 2000 waypoints on it from 10 different lakes on it.and a few safe routes.ive travelled enough times on these lakes and don't even look at the unit anymore.i know where all waypoints are and use them to pinpoint where I'll start fishing and always seem to catch lots of fish.ill go and explore sometimes during the day nice and slow like and sometimes find something new.have had my old lowrance for 10 years.still going strong even after a being under water when I had it on a camp boat at the dock.trying to figure out if I would catch more fish if I upgraded to the units like your talking about.what benefits would I gain.i can run eagle lake it's entire lengthy without any electronics and could go from earfalls to siouxlookout also.actually my navionics chip i have has a route on it that would let anyone do the lac suel run and up to chamberlai narrows.
5958218,515,2018-01-21 08:27:00,254,First great topic and insight from everyone so far. I'm looking at upgrading my electronics on my boat now and was just at boat show in Toronto this week a and gained far more knowledge here than I did from the surprising pros at the show. I came away from there more confused than anything. There was some awesome pricing on all units there but I didn't feel I had the knowledge while there to pull the plug on one and glad I decided to investigate more on places like this from the people who use them. On a side note Garmin now owns Navionics so that might change everything in the future. Thanks Mike
5958562,wnafabrication,2018-01-21 10:53:00,9,"Great news about Garmin buying Navionics. The fact that Garmins map as you go feature came as a free update to compatible units, I would then presume and hope that any update in the future that will allow Navionics chips to be Garmin compatible will also be free. What helped me decide on Garmin is that a big update such as map as you go came free and they could have easily required you to buy the latest and greatest to get this but didn’t. From what I can see Garmin doesn’t nickel and dime you for every little thing where as humminbird and lowrance do.I just finished getting my Garmin EchoMAP 95dv for $900Can with transducer so I’ll see how things go come springtime.I reached out to Garmin Canada about whether or not Navionics maps would be either incorperated as an update to current maps or if Garmin units would get an update that would make it navionics chip compatible. Here is what the response was...""There will be mapping updates in the future as we usually do 2 times a year. At some point in the not too distant future you should find the Navionics data incorporated into our mapping. If it falls within the time our 1 year new chart guarantee covers you will be upgraded for free.""According to Garmin's website you are allowed ONE free mapping update within a one year period, so for those of you who are looking to buy a new Garmin, or have bought one in the last few months and HAVEN'T updated your maps yet, might as well hold off and maybe you will end up with the Navionics chart updates for free!"
5963522,515,2018-01-23 21:23:00,254,While I like alot about Garmin the one thing making lean towards Humminbird is that fact that I can use it to control trolling motor and with me fishing the big lakes alone sometimes the autopilot is a huge bonus.
5965234,wnafabrication,2018-01-25 00:32:00,9,Agreed that is very handy. What I did in the past with my Ipilot was drive the boat over my desired track with my boat motor while recording the track with the Ipilot. Then hit use the ipilot to recreate that route. Way faster than setting a bunch of stuff up on the electronics in my mind. Following a contour in a Canadian Shield Lake would be alot of zig zagging so for me its no big deal to miss out on the ipilot link.
6025097,515,2018-02-25 09:29:00,254,Good point about the i-pilot and its uses alone. So now I have it narrowed down to the garmin and humminbird. More to thinking to do.
6065209,515,2018-03-16 08:25:00,254,"Decision made at Toronto sportsman show, I bought a Garmin echomap 95sv for $900 taxes in amazing price. Lowrance wants an extra $100 a year for map sharing and they own it after you download it to there site so I'm not into paying to do that for them. Humminbird was a close choice but spending extra $100+ for a special card rubbed me the wrong way. Garmin seems to have it all in a great package and doesn't seem to want to nickel and dime the user after purchase. So can't wait to get it on boat and hit the water."
5953434,wnafabrication,2018-01-18 06:29:00,9,"Basically here is the main difference... My favorite lake I fish for Lake Trout, Walleye and Pike is remote with no mapping available. I have fished this lake for 30 years since I was a kid, and my dad fished it for 30 years before that. We definately had our favorite spots and had great fishing every time we went. As we all know the honey holes have good and bad days, so having more spots to try is always a good thing. With Lake Trout, they are very mobile and don't always hold in the same area depending on time of year, water temperature, thermocline depth, and weather conditions. I usually go for a week at a time to this lake and with my current unit (Lowrance Elite 5 HDI) I had to wait until I returned back from this trip to upload, convert, download, and install these recorded sonar logs. Not useful until I returned back for another trip AND this service costs 24.95/month or $99/yr through C-Map Genesis to keep your information private. What I found was amazing. Alot of the contour structure in the lake that I would pass over fishing and catch fish at actually ran out into the middle of the lake. I could map my favorite spots and then inspect the maps that I had made of other spots in the lake to find similar structure to my honey holes. I would fish these spots on my next trip and BLAMO! New honey hole. Now when there are a few other fisherman in one of the spots I want to fish I can pick another one to get some peace and quiet to enjoy my trip. So to be able to map as I go would be a huge advantage on a week long trip and my knowledge of the lake would increase alot faster. Last year I actually found an underwater island in the middle of the lake that had a connection to a reef that ran straight out from the shoreline. The trout were using this reef and travelling out to the underwater island in late summer/fall. I found it because my dad told me of a few times they had ""Line up that point on the north side and head towards the second tallest hill on the south side and you might hit that reef"" Now I know not only where that spot is, but I understand why the fish are there. With trout, once you know where the thermocline is, you can look for structure in the lake where the trout can run baitfish on an inside turn up to the thermocline and gorge on them. I literally identify the thermocline, identify inside turns at that depth close to areas I know they usually are around, then go there. 95% of the time there is a school there and jigging them is ridiculous. With Walleye you will be able to find your own advantage there but with the 3 brands pros and cons, there is only one choice for a guy like me who likes to purchase something and be done paying nickels and dimes to a company to use their product. Garmin has no hidden charges, nothing further to buy. Humminbird you have to buy a minimum of a zero lines card for $100, Lowrance you have to buy a subscription. Also with Garmin you can buy a basic 4"" screen unit and it is compatible with all the same mapping features as the 9"" version and has the same abilities and gadgets as well. Right now the garmin 9"" screen with Canadian Maps preloaded, chirp, down imaging and side imaging transducer is on sale for $900 Can. Downfall is that it is not compatible with any Navionics or similar mapping cards."
5953506,BornToFish,2018-01-18 07:03:00,1224,"Greetings,The previous post by WNAF.... resonated with me in view of my previous post on this thread. He used the words ""similar structure"", ""knowledge"" and ""understand"" in his comments. These words are powerful when taken in the context of making my own depth contour maps. I am able to use my depth contour maps to understand why my ""spots on the spots"" are good, and use this knowledge to locate more such spots on the spots.The previous posters have identified many of the pros/cons of the various brands of sonar/gps units.One thing they all have in common is the need to invest time in creating the maps. It might take me 2-3 hours to survey a large mid-lake rock hump to my degree of detail. A small hump might take thirty minutes or so to survey. I am willing to invest this time as I am confident that there will be a real return to me for this investment - better fishing!Thus, surveying a lake might not be for everyone. It's a substantial commitment of time and money. I don't see many people devoting a significant amount of time out of their one week long vacation to lake mapping, when they could be catching fish. However, there are people (e.g. me!) that are willing to invest the time and money to take my fishing to a higher level. I have made a commitment to the particular lake system that I fish.Every angler must decide for himself/herself if it's a good investment in time/money to gain further knowledge, understanding and insights into the water she/he is fishing. Lake mapping has worked very well for me, but may not work at all for the next person.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5953522,wnafabrication,2018-01-18 07:20:00,9,"Well I think we all have experienced the frustration of fishing and not understanding where the fish are and why they aren't biting. Understanding behaviours of the certain fish you are targeting in relation to time of year, current weather conditions, fishing pressure, baitfish types as well as their behaviours etc. Is just as important as knowing the structure of the lake you are fishing on. If you don't have maps available or do not know the lake, fish, baitfish very well you will catch less fish than those that know the lake better than you do unless you are lucky. It feels good to have options in times where the fish are elusive or holding tight in specific spots. If you catch a few in one spot and they quit, look on your maps to find similar areas and try them. Do I love mapping? Absolutely. My fishing buddies and my dad also love that I love it for obvious reasons. On my trips I'll wake up before everyone else and go mapping while they make breakfast. It's a great way I get out of cooking and cleaning by doing something I enjoy!"

5911818,h8go4s,2017-12-24 19:46:00,1673,Get a Humminbird Helix 10 g2n Mega and a zero lines card. Read the web page below.https://www.humminbird.com/Category/...utoChart-Live/
5911930,Shellback,2017-12-25 05:14:00,8083,No extra costs for Garmin self mapping with exception to the mini SD cards. Keep it private or you can share on their internet site. Unfortunately I don't think any of the 3 big companies mapping can be made compatible with the others. You will have to start from scratch.
5911938,Remi,2017-12-25 05:52:00,41,"I have the Hummingbird Helix 10, original generation 1, down image only. First year in Canada used the internal memory, you get about 6 hours, filled that the first day, clear it a few times. Second year got the Zero Lines card, Hummingbird support said you could record 30 year straight on it, well I turned on recording and never turned it off, I love it. Third year up in Canada came back to same lakes, could see my recorded maps and added more. In my experience it will record as long as you are marking bottom. But I have the original, just marks the depth, not the bottom type(mud, weeds). Running a 40 hp on a 16 foot Lund. Calm days it will mark good at full speed doing about 26 mph."
5912770,wnafabrication,2017-12-26 06:41:00,9,"Thanks for the replies... I missed out on a good deal a few weeks ago when the Helix 10 Mega was on sale for $899USD at Cabelas but at that time I wasn't sure what to get. As for the mapping compatability, I had seen some old posts about Dr Depth and using that program to do the conversion but haven't read into that much yet. ANYONE HAVE A COPY THEY COULD EMAIL ME? I have most of my Sonar Logs saved still so that would be nice to be able to do. With the Lowrance mapping you can export a GPX file but im thinking that just has my track and waypoint info in it, not sure there. Was considering getting a Humminbird Helix 7 and using the saved cash to get the 360 imaging transducer. From my readings it looks like I would have to get a second transducer if I went to the Humminbird MegaHz models as I would like to see depth past 6-10MPH. Anyone have better luck with the MegaHz models at speed?"
5912786,wnafabrication,2017-12-26 06:59:00,9,"I did like in some of the Garmin videos how the ""map as you go"" had a circle around the boat so it was easier to not miss any spots as you mapped."
5912866,lawson2343,2017-12-26 07:38:00,459,"My cousin put on a Helix 10 this spring and it records depth at all speeds. There are plenty of threads on WC on the subject. You just need to get the correct placement of the transducer. You shouldn't have to buy a high speed transducer. As stated earlier in this thread, as long as you are reading bottom, you are mapping the bottom, no matter the speed. You say you have your track files - that will give you are head start in creating your Hbird map. Each data point in that track file has a depth. You convert your Lowrance track into Hbird track and that can be used to create a map."
5912874,BornToFish,2017-12-26 07:38:00,1224,"Greetings,I rigged my boat with Lowrance units about twelve years ago. All ran well with these units for the first few years, then issues started developing. I found Lowrance's customer service (at that time) was pathetic at best, and absent most of the time. The last time I contacted their customer service people, the lady listened to my problem with their units. Her response was ""huh"" and advised me to post on various fishing forums and see what advice is offered to me.I promptly made the switch to Humminbirds based on recommendations from several fishing friends. I haven't looked back!I purchased a Navionics Canada card as it includes a lake map for a lake of interest to me. I was finding that many places that I fished were not shown on the lake map. Conversely, I was unable to locate some places on the lake that were shown on the lake map. Hence, I decided to make the jump and explore making my own lake maps.I purchased a Humminbird Helix 9 in the autumn of 2016. This unit is set up to be portable. I only used it when fishing in NW Ontario. On the positive side, I can sincerely state that my personal lake maps have allowed me to take my fishing to a much higher level. For example, my personal lake maps explain why some of my ""good spots"" are ""good spots"". This knowledge allowed me to look at my lake maps to locate other ""good spots"". Now, I frequently motor directly to the ""spot on the spot"" (e.g. an inside or outside turn, a saddle between a rock hump and a nearby satellite hump) on a piece of structure and start fishing/catching, rather than wandering around the rock hump hoping to find some fish.In hindsight, I can see two downsides. The first is the cost of the equipment - hardly insignificant! The other is the investment in time to make to lake maps. The time spent mapping will normally not overlap with fishing - at least in my experience. All of my lake mapping has been directed to specific areas of the lake that were of interest to me, such that the structures are defined with acceptable detail. My mapping did not take place while ""running at high speed"" while haphazardly navigating between points of interest.Returning to the original post, I doubt that the data files are interchangeable between the various brands of gps/sonar units. Obviously, the original poster can decide if he wants to make a switch and just how deep of a financial investment to make. There might be a fairly subtle issue for the original poster to ponder. That is, do you have the temperament to invest time/effort to make quality lake maps that will allow you to improve your fishing? I suspect that not all fishermen have the temperament to spend many hours mapping areas of a lake as it is sort of like watching paint dry.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5913866,h8go4s,2017-12-26 21:27:00,1673,"1. The Helix 7 has only one card slot, so I don't know how you'd be able to save more than 8 hours of recording. Helix 9, 10 and 12 have 2 card slots.2. No need to get a second transducer. You can get high speed readings, you just have to have the patience to adjust the transducer position properly. BTW, recommended top speed for AutoChart is 10 mph."
5914018,Shellback,2017-12-27 05:35:00,8083,"That's correct, the area being mapped is highlighted."
