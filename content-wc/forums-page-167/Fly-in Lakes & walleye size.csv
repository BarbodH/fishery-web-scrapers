6061937,tv4fish,2018-03-15 05:51:00,2694,"I will just ""throw this out there"".............. Years ago, we learned the hard way that some lakes are commercially fished, and of course, those guys take the ""nice"" sized fish - NOT the small guys. We had requested to fly into a lake that had ""only"" bigger fish. Well - we ended up with a new pilot that dropped us into our lake. We ended up spending the entire day catching 13-16"" walleyes - not one bigger one to be caught. When we returned to the flyout base --- we were told about the pilot's error - he dropped us into a lake that WAS commercially fished. Yeah, we got part of our money back, but still a major disappointment."
6063945,phishfearme,2018-03-15 17:55:00,1242,"there's one other important lake characteristics that has not been mentioned that I think is quite important - and that is if the lake has a large area of deep water. kearns lake north of thunder bay - which is a small lake that consistently produces trophy walleye and pike, has deep water - greater than 20 ft - in at least 1/2 of the lake area. this large amount of deep area permits good winter carryover as well as permitting a small lake to function like a large one enabling fish to grow in good numbers to large size. a few of the lakes we've been to - that produced tons of small fish but few over 20 inches - like obashi lake, wettlaufer lake and others - it was difficult to find any water over even 15ft and that was rare. imagine 5 ft of ice over a lake like this - very little area to survive in. we have lots of other example - from now on, we look for lakes with a significant amount of deep water. phish"
6058617,Braggart,2018-03-13 14:33:00,22,"The 2 factors I spoke about earlier are directly connected to each other and can be summed up as: Growing season and Forage base Some southern reservoirs produce huge walleye...why? The water is warmer, the feeding season is longer, the forage base is larger. Forage base is certainly a key component. Take a similar southern body of water that has little to no forage base, fish are either stunted or few and far in between. Not every southern body of water is full of trophy fish. Let's head north now. Why do some lakes produce large fish? Again, forage base is the key. Now one would argue that most untouched lakes have decent forage bases. Actually they don't. Why? Water temp. Water does not warm up until June, so the forage base takes longer to develop and the prime feeding periods are therefore shorter. Why are there trophy fish in some northern lakes? In a word...longevity. Less fishing pressure means all these trophy fish can continue to feed and grow. Fish that are 15lbs in a southern lake may only be 5-10 years old. In northern lakes they are more likely 20+ years old. Larger lakes will have larger forage bases as well. Trophy fish in northern lakes are better at foraging than their smaller cousins...they get bigger...they forage more...they get bigger...repeat, etc. Good genetics also play a role. However they take a lot longer to get as big as their counterparts in a more southern locale. These trophy fish are present because they are not ""fished out"" due to their northern (read: hard to get to) location. There are no ""absolutes"" when it comes to these discussions, but temperature and feed are at the top of the list. It's a safe bet to say that the next world record walleye will come from a warm water area. Tennessee holds the current record, but 20lb fish are now being caught in the Columbia system. This system has an incredible forage base, and in addition these large fish can move downstream (southward migration) to take advantage of longer feeding seasons. Here's a good study on their (walleye's) effects on the Columbia system.http://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/343828.pdf Sorry to ramble."
6058625,MrSimon,2018-03-13 14:42:00,922,"Well if you bring Tennessee and big Southern US reservoirs into the mix ... then sure, growing season will have an impact. I still don't think growing season makes a noticeable or measurable difference between Ontario lakes."
6058801,KSjim,2018-03-13 15:50:00,88,"Over the years of fly in fishing trips to Ontario and Manitoba it has seemed to our group that the larger bodies of water produce larger fish on average but we have seen a couple exceptions. One year we had to book very late and the third week of June were the only dates that matched up for everyone. Needless to say our options were limited. We ended up at a very small lake in northern Manitoba. The web site said 9.9 hp motors. When we got there they were 6 hp motors. No problem you could still get to anywhere on the lake in 15 to 20 minutes top. It was a lake that normally we would have never considered but we ended up having a great trip. We caught, fat healthy, walleye 18"" and up at will and while no monsters, our group of 4 caught 34 walleye 23"" to 27"" for the week. The biggest problem we had was the cabin was way to close when the cooler got a little light!"

6058913,Braggart,2018-03-13 17:14:00,22,Lots of factors between lakes. To name but a few... Trophic status (eutrophoc? mesotrophic? oligotrophic?) Fishing pressure Past fishing pressure Average depth Available spawning areas Bird population Average water temperature Species diversity Forage diversity Yadda yadda. You'll always get bodies of water that are side by side that produce differently. In general however the aforementioned holds true.

6059593,Baseline,2018-03-14 05:52:00,3207,My experience has been that flowing river systems like the English River have a larger average sized walleye.
6061529,DaBirdman,2018-03-14 19:55:00,164,"Thanks for all the replies! Good reads & interesting information. I agree that it probably takes a special body of water with all the right conditions to get a good population of large fish. The lake we are flying into this August is not huge, maybe 3500 to 4000 acres. It's loaded with 16-20 inch fish from what I gather, but walleyes up to 30 are in there. Just far and few it seems. In the end, I'm just thrilled to be going on this trip! I'll take loads of 16-20 inch fish all day, every day and twice on Sunday! Nice to hear also that there is a chance at a big one, even if it's a small chance."
6061809,Flyinfisher1,2018-03-15 04:28:00,5,We have always found the larger lakes or larger systems will provide bigger fish on our fly-ins.
6061825,pjshorthorn,2018-03-15 04:42:00,5654,"I would have to somewhat disagree with your last sentence. I have studied the growth charts of walleye and northern in Red Lake Ontario that was compiled by the Ministry. There is definitely a correlation between the growth rates and how long the winter's last in upper NW Ontario. My son and I were fortunate enough to catch a personal best northern (44"") and a walleye ( 27.5"") on that trip. I don't recall the growth rate year on year, but it was quite small. According to the growth charts both of our big fish were right at the 25 year mark to reach the size we measured. This discussion came up a couple of years ago and someone posted a growth chart in the thread which was spot on with the charts we reviewed that trip. PjShorthorn"
6056801,DaBirdman,2018-03-12 19:48:00,164,"In reading quite a number of threads & posts about fly in lakes, it seems many, many of the lakes are loaded with say 16-22 inch fish. Is that due to forage base? Growing season? Genetics? Over-populated? With all these lakes having just one cabin with minimal pressure & harvest, one would think that each lake would be filled with big, sometimes giant fish???"
6056969,Bill Krejca,2018-03-12 21:06:00,6107,Some of the lakes perhaps have the larger ones selectively removed during the ice over period. Bill
6056985,adempsey2.0,2018-03-12 21:28:00,612,"Probably many reasons. I can make some guesses.1) For the most part, the population is going to follow a normal distribution (i.e., bell curve). So, there will always be fewer older (i.e., larger) fish than ""middle aged"" fish.2) The sex ratio might favor males over females. Males are typically smaller and likely school together. Not sure if females behave differently or not. 3) Age classes school up. You hit some active fish, but they are all smaller. Possibly because they are from the same age class and the bigger ones are feeding somewhere else.4) Environment. Compared to the Great Lakes, Walleye seem to be on the smaller size on average. So, the lake size likely matters. How different is a 10,000 acre vs a 2,000 acre lake? Not really sure. Probably have to consider other things besides surface area, such as total volume, structure and forage base. Ultimately, it may simply be the forage base. Larger lakes = more forage in abundance and variety? Not sure.5) Genetics. Possibly. I have this discussion about Jumbo Perch often. Are they just big perch? or a genetic variety? Isolated lakes could produce genetically distinct populations.6) Location. Further north, the colder it is. Less time to eat and grow? Smaller forage base?"
6056993,bthomas3333,2018-03-12 21:30:00,465,"I will put my two cents out there. I think you are on the right track with all the potential issues. Smaller lakes / less forage / lower calorie forage / growing season / etc...etc.The one thing I have learned after more than 20 fly-ins to the same lake. I can say with 100% certainty that this lake doesn't have enough large fish to make them fishable. 20+ trips...many 100 walleye days...usually 6 guys. zero 28+ walleye. Tens of thousands of 16-26 inch walleyes. My guess is the lake doesnt have a large enough forage base of Ciscos / White fish to grow really big fish before they die. Even the pike are smaller....,many many 10lb but very few larger ones. Now this lake is 7 miles by about 3 miles. Not a small lake but it doesnt hold really LARGE fish. It just isnt a trophy fishery. That doesnt make it is bad or less desirable to many guys. But, if you want to target bigger fish you need to fish lakes with a history of producing big fish. I think you will find they are clearer deeper water with more high cal baitfish.I guess if you want to fish for trophies find the lakes that hold trophies and pay the price to fish there. If you want to catch trophy fish, fish trophy water. Ask people here. Search the forums here and across the web. For a VERY long time I wanted to fish trophies but was fishing water that didn't have the fish I wanted to target. I had to move on to find what I wanted. Know thyself.Brett"
6057633,phishfearme,2018-03-13 08:18:00,1242,"one thing to add - consider that in northern Ontario, a 19 inch walleye is 10-12 years old. (similarly, a 20 pound pike (40 +/- inches) is about 20 years old). you are catching quite old fish - we always considered ""large"" to be anything over 20 inches. phish"
6057673,MrSimon,2018-03-13 08:29:00,922,"Potential for big fish has everything to do with food, habitat, and to a lesser degree, water volume. Every lake is different. There are fly-ins that produce absolute giants on a regular basis, and others that are good for numbers. Outfitters know which lakes are which, and usually advertise accordingly. For example, Hearst air flies to the Attawapiskat River where giant walleye are caught regularly ... but they also have a bunch of small fertile lakes that are stuffed with eater size walleye. That's what I love about Canada, you can choose the experience you want and go get it."
6057689,Braggart,2018-03-13 08:31:00,22,"Testify! Brett is bang on IMO. I've fished lakes in Northern Canada that have seen perhaps a dozen fishermen in possibly a decade (not easy to get into). One would think that there would be trophies at every second cast. Not so. The walleye are all cookie cutter, regardess of where and when you fish. Pike are more varied, but rarely do you find anything over 10lbs. If you want trophy fish, I think you need one of two criteria...big water or longer growing season. Big water changes the forage base and the competition factor between fish. The fish that get trophy size are better at foraging than those that remain smaller. Like a snowball effect, the bigger they get the bigger forage they can eat. Eventually you have a trophy fish. Trouble is, only 1 out of 1000 get to this size. The longer growing season aspect speaks for itself. Warmer water, more forage, more time and stuff to eat. It's like me during football season. Why do celebrity fishermen catch so many trophies in a short period of time (usually in a 30 min TV show)? They fish big water (aka trophy water) during specific times of the season. Pike are known to stack up right after ice out in shallow bays to catch the sun and warm up. Same for walleye, except they stack off weed beds and rocky shorelines during pre and post spawn. Add in the fact that they film for 3-5 days, but only show 20 mins of footage and you have a TV show full of trophy fish. Fish the right water at the right time and your odds improve dramatically. Myself, I prefer 100 fish days over 2 trophies (and 10 fish a day) in 5 days. Everyone is different."
6058225,MrSimon,2018-03-13 12:03:00,922,"I'm no biologist, but I don't think that a ""shorter growing season up north"" is a factor ... at least not when comparing Southern Ontario to Northern Ontario, which differs only by about 350 miles. Heck, there are world class trophy walleye lakes in Manitoba and Saskatchewan that are further north than the top of Ontario."
6058409,valley366,2018-03-13 13:28:00,193,"I think any body of water has a certain size fish that is associated with it. Could be genetics, could be forage, could be mass but who knows.We fished a resort (not fly in) for several years in a row. 4 interconnected lakes. 2 were similarly stained dirty generally shallow water and 2 were clear deeper water. Only one of the lakes produced a large quantity of larger fish. Yes you could catch up to about 25"" fish in any one of the 4 but only the one produced a large number of the fish over 25"".Is it possible that all the larger fish migrate to the one larger lake? Possibly but seeing that only connected by shallow stream about 1/2 long I doubt it.I am sure there are people that are smarter than me that have the answer but I just accept it. Some lakes produce great numbers and some large fish."
6058433,camp chef,2018-03-13 13:35:00,915,When we can't find bigger fish we switch to smaller rods and reels. Everything fights like a trophy on ultra lights with 4 # .
