6051705,Pooch,2018-03-10 12:30:00,4618,Picture of that bent rod got my attention before I realized what you guys were talking about. I foresee requests for broken rod warranty applications in your future!! There's probably a story somewhere in that photo.Pooch
6051833,PRO-V16,2018-03-10 14:10:00,16,"There is no such thing as bigfoot!! I have buddies up by my hunting shack that made sasquach feet by pouring silicone in a mold they made and inserted shoe laces. When they get to a muddy area they strap them on, leave some tracks and break a few branches. Sure get's the believers excited!!"
6051897,northernbite,2018-03-10 14:50:00,1186,"Boy if that isn't the truth. 20 years ago we had a new guy going with us because one of the guys had died the year before and was his cousin. We where taking ashes up so I thought I'd let him come.Mean time I say can you cook? Why yes he says. Turns out his expertise was pan cakes and cutting up salad if somebody else started and he would jump in. Well I went back to cooking with a new guy looking over my shoulder.LOL, Paul"
6051961,pjshorthorn,2018-03-10 16:13:00,5654,"Apparently flamingos are an indigenous bird to NW Ontario, just like the pelicans we encountered at the same time last year. I've done a lot of research since our ""strange"" encounter with both bird species at VBL Lodge. What stands out about flamingos is they are aggressive dog herders, they head in for dinner on queue just like cows ( we fed them turkey flavored squirrel nuts) , they attract large herons in hopes of mating ( just a guess on the mating part, but there was a whole lot of squaking going on late at night), they keep Canadian Geese from crapping all over the shoreline in camp ( that is kinda harsh since Canadian Geese are from Canada) and they are really good at horseshoes. I'm still trying to figure out how they can stand on one leg and throw a horseshoe...... Thanks for not insinuating that I would have been smart enough to smuggle flamingos into Canada. PjShorthorn"
6052009,That Minnesota guy,2018-03-10 16:46:00,8293,Naw............nobody here would have thought you had anything to do with those Flamingos.
6054585,Overwatchmike,2018-03-11 21:21:00,201,Oh this brings back a memory....Middle of the night.... buddies dog goes out with me. Standing in the outhouse / storage shed relieving the adult beverages when I hear a throaty growl and then all @#$%ing **** breaks loose. The dog and something.... were going at it within feet of where I was standing and I can't see anything. No flash light and I'm trapped in the outhouse with a dog and who knows what raising **** just outside. After what seemed like ages the growling stopped and I got up the nerve to head out and make a mad dash for the cabin. The dog was at waiting at the door with a dead fox in its mouth... I never did fall back to sleep after that...Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk

6054785,pjshorthorn,2018-03-12 06:17:00,5654,"Pooch, you are very perceptive in the fact that there is always a story with most every picture that I take.......including the one you are commenting on. I'm somewhat reluctant to share the story because it will cause folks on WC to think I'm even more crazy than they already think at the moment. Oh heck, who gives a rip. Here goes. A couple of years ago the son and I decided to take a remote portage trip into a small lake associated with VBL lodge on Eagle Lake. It was a trip described as "" not for the faint of heart"". It was explained that there were 4 portages on foot and 4 boats rides to get into this backcountry lake full of smallmouth. What wasn't explained to me was the distinct possibility of coming across Sasquatch in the dense Boreal forest while making these portages. We started out with a mosquito laden hike of about a 1/2 mile,but all in all it was full of anticipation as we scooted across the lake to the next portage. We journeyed almost straight uphill for about 10 minutes. As we took a break on a rock outcropping to catch our breath, there was what we thought was loud snorting and grunting coming from the dense bush. I told the son that we may have a bear close so keep your eyes peeled. Before we know it, this tall hairy and smelly creature comes up behind us and steals all of our boat cushions.....like they needed new pillows or something. With a grunt and high pitch scream, the beast was off on the portage with strides of proportions never seen before. A little shaken and wet between the legs, we weren't quite sure what to do so we thought the safest thing to do was to get to the next cache of boats ASAP and get out in the middle of Otter Lake. Surely no beast like that could swim. We trolled in circles for about an hour in the middle of the lake scanning the shorelines for signs of the creature. With no sightings it was decision time , do we soldier on or flee back to our boat on Eagle Lake? We figured that since we had no more pee left in us, we might as well make the last quick portage to get into smallmouth heaven. Roll the dice and see what happens....I mean we didn't think there was a chance of wetting ourselves again so why not? We made it to our destination lake with no further issues, but It should be said that launching the boat was like a rapid deployment excercise. On to fishing and good fishing it was. We had great success catching smallmouth quickly and often on our UL rigs with a few nice northern s thrown in for an occasional surprise. The journey was well worth the effort!!!! After a couple of hours , a storm blew up and with one crack of lightening to close to us we made a beeline for a small sandy area on shore. As we waited out the storm, one could imagine that we were constantly had our head on a swivel looking for more ""things"". The son started casting from shore and picked up some nice small mouth while I kept watching for anything that would make me shriek like a little girl. And then it happened......as the son reeled in a nice fish, a roar erupted from behind us and before we knew what was happening the Sqautch looking thing grabbed the rod from my son and proceeded to try and get the fish off the hook. Increasingly frustrated by the hook ( I think the long nails on the creature caused a lack of dexterity ) it bit the head of the fish and let out a small screech.....I'm guessing it hooked itself on its lip because the screech sounded a lot like OUCH!!! By now I have wet myself again and there was no telling what condition the son was in because he was 25' up in a jack pine tree, but I'm pretty sure he was going to need some birch bark to clean out his britches. The beast continued to wrangle with the fish and by now I'm getting pretty peeved off because my $531 combo is being stepped on , beat against the boat and generally abused. I started yelling and showing off some karate moves to distract it. Well, that didn't go as planned and to show me it was a bada$$, it bit the fish in half and raised both pieces into the air with a guttural noise that shook me to my core. I knew this was end as I had known it. Like that......it was gone with quick strides and sounds that seemed like laughter. There was no time to waste and I wasn't going to take anymore chances. I made a call to the lodge on the Sat Phone and told them to send in Wilderness Air to get us out. On the way back to the lodge there were so many things going through my mind, but the only thing that made sense was the beast had to be a Canadian Sasquatch........I mean it was pasty white from head to giant toe.

6055361,Carnhzkr,2018-03-12 10:55:00,964,"I believed the entire story until you said you had a $531 combo. If you'd said it was a Zebco 202 on an Ugly Stik, I'd have bought it."
6055249,Pooch,2018-03-12 10:24:00,4618,"I heard that funny smelling smokes might be close to be legal up there, but were you maybe getting a little jump on that legalization?Surely you watched too many late night scary movies at some point in your life?I've had hallucinations not unlike yours, but they were pain medication induced and I never took another one in my life since. That's some bad juju.Pooch"
6050993,smithcr1981,2018-03-09 19:44:00,42,reading old threads about strange things found at camps and things that piss off lodge owners. I want too hear if you all have any strange/unexplainable sightings of incidents while at remote fly in camps
6051049,Pooch,2018-03-09 20:28:00,4618,"Yea, strange that all the guys that can't cook at home suddenly become very knowledgeable when looking over the shoulder of the only guy that can and does actually cook prepares a meal.Pooch"
6051145,TimJamison11,2018-03-09 23:17:00,224,I was hoping the sighting was a Squatch.... :0
6051185,smithcr1981,2018-03-10 05:00:00,42,"the only thing I have ever experienced is that lonely feeling when taking the unfortunate trip to the outhouse in the middle of the night, armed with only a flashlight. It really makes your ears turn up"
6051217,pjshorthorn,2018-03-10 05:13:00,5654,Here are a few from trips at Vermilion Bay Lodge. And we did actually have a Sasquatch sighting too!!!!! The odd part it looked quite similar to the lodge owner PjShorthorn
6051225,wallydave,2018-03-10 05:27:00,2151,"We're you dynamite fishing again, or was Big Foot jumping in to chase your top water bait?"
6051241,pjshorthorn,2018-03-10 05:44:00,5654,We found the biggest float plane we could to bring us into camp. It just happened to be able to scoop walleye up at the same time when we came in for a landing. Easy way to get nice eaters for dinner the first couple of nights. PjShorthorn
6051385,Shellback,2018-03-10 07:16:00,8083,"If he was wearing a MAGA hat, it really was a STRANGE sighting!"
6051497,pjshorthorn,2018-03-10 08:50:00,5654,I agree with you. Strange is a common occurence when at VBL. Even more strange is how fish get unhooked from time to time. I guess that's why they call them things Big Foot. PjShorthorn
6051601,MikeinMN,2018-03-10 10:38:00,190,"We had a wolf walk through camp about 75-100 feet away from us right before dark. He walked right through a clearing, was in no hurry, and never seemed to look at us. We only saw him the one time that week, but when we mentioned it to the camp owner he said another group earlier in the year had seen a lone wolf also. Maybe our group should get one of those flamingo decoys to keep a wandering wolf interested a little longer."
