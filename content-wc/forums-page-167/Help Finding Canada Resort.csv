6047601,fishron,2018-03-08 06:48:00,317,Check out Bark Lake Lodge. It's on an arm of Cabonga Reservoir. It's eight hours from Wilson N.C. to where I live in S.E. Pa. and would be another twelve to Bark Lake Lodge using the Thousand Island crossing. They have a meal plan and boat rentals and guides. I have not fished there but I am familiar with the good fishing on Cabonga Reservoir. Their website is impressive and their clientele is mostly French Canadian. Maybe Andre has some familiarity with the lodge.

If you forgo the American Plan (many lodges are doing away with them all over) there is not much that you cannot bring across from the U.S. making the cost of cooking very reasonable. Bringing your own boat can also be very cost effective as there is no Gasoline duty like there is on Beer or Tobacco, many lodges charge for gasoline and or boats, doing away with that cost may pay for your groceries. Our group brings several frozen meals (Gumbo, Chili, Ect) which just equates to heat and serve."
6041561,papadave,2018-03-05 15:40:00,151,We are looking for a nice American Plan drive-to resort for walleye in mid to late August. We will be driving from NC so we want to find something crossing at Sault Ste. Marie or 1000 Islands. I have been looking for a long time without much luck at finding a good match for us. Any suggestions would be much appreciated?
6041777,Guest,2018-03-05 17:22:00,0,"That's a long long long drive from North Carolina. Just a suggestion you could possibly fly from Raleigh to Milwaukee? Two hour flight non stop. Frontier Air just started a direct flight to Milwaukee from Raleigh. I got airfare round trip for $78 for travel in April to Raleigh and back. Probably a lot cheaper than driving and motels. Of course they nick you extra for baggage. Then I would go on line and look at Temple Bay Lodge near Dryden on Eagle Lake. They have bus trips out of Milwaukee, Chicago, Appleton and Minnesota. Do not know if days would coordinate. OR rent a car in Milwukee and drive to any other resort of your choice. Temple Bay is a good value, good boats , food and accommodations . Good Luck"
6042065,adempsey2.0,2018-03-05 19:39:00,612,"Might be worth a look at Lady Evelyn Lake. They are boat-in lodges though.http://www.garden-island.com/http://www.island10.com/lady-evelyn-lake.aspThere's also Wabatongushi Lakehttps://lochisland.com/I've been to Evelyn, but not Wabatongushi (yet!), and I truly enjoyed my trips there. The Walleye fishing is good and can be excellent. Smallmouth Bass fishing is great. Pike is OK. There are some portage lakes for more Bass or Lake Trout fishing. Great camps, great boats, decent food. I give the slight edge to Garden Island primarily due to location. I am considering going back this year myself. That being said, you can find better fishing elsewhere, but you'll likely have to drive much further west, fly in or go camp in the bush!"

Time is getting REALLY short, even for a trip in AUG. It may be time to redo the priority list, your group list, or talk about what IS available."
6043409,Bstar,2018-03-06 10:09:00,564,Unless your bringing your own boat I would check out Lodge 88 on Esnagi Lake. Not a drive to but you can either train in or fly in. Haven't been there myself but it's on my radar. Here's a great trip report from Mike Borger. https://www.canadafishingguide.net/t...-eighty-eight/
6044665,FishinSasquatch,2018-03-06 23:45:00,8,"If you would be willing to forgo the American plan there are multiple fantastic fishing opportunities on Rainy lake in Ontario. In mid to late August walleyes move to the deeper flats and reefs, and you can catch lunkers to your hearts content. There are drive to options that do boat rentals like Coppen's Resor8t, The Fisheries, The Landing (Not sure if they have rentals), and boat to places like Camp Narrows and Silver Musky lodge. They all differ in price and location with a majority in the red gut area exception being camp narrows which is on the north arm of rainy. Coppen's and Fisheries is situated in the center between red gut and the South arm which allows for more variety in style of fishing (one part is shallow darker water the other being deeper and clearer). Sorry for the winded reply but thought I'd throw the idea out there."
6044913,Shellback,2018-03-07 06:28:00,8083,"Papadave, You are in about the same situation I'm in, 900 miles to Sault Saint Marie. A couple hours less to Thousand Islands crossing. Have you considered Quebec instead of Ontario?"
6045249,retire55,2018-03-07 08:18:00,1029,"Yes, you may want to consider Taggart Bay Lodge on Lake Kipawa in Quebec. All highway driving except for last 3 miles. See http://www.taggartbaylodge.com/"
6046225,papadave,2018-03-07 14:39:00,151,"Wow, there are a lot of really exceptional suggestions here! Thank you very much. I may PM a few of you to ask some questions if you don't mind. Shellback, I have stayed at La Reserve Beauchene in Quebec a couple times but they got way too expensive over the years. However it was like staying and especially eating at a high class exclusive resort. I haven't been able to locate any other place in Quebec that looked good. If you have any suggestions I'd like to know."
6047281,Shellback,2018-03-08 05:03:00,8083,"I personally have no experiences in Quebec, just thought it would be an alternative to the long drive to N.W. ON"
