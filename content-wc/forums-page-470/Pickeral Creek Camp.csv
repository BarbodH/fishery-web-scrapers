1304692,teddi,2011-05-09 13:15:00,349,no fishing to speak of at the camp. you put the boat motor and gas tank in your trunk and are given a map and a key for the boat. they have a lot of remote drive to lakes that have very good fishing. they also have an outpost[drive to] north and east of ear falls with very good fishing.

My group always motors past PC Camp at least once each year on our way from Jackfish Lake to Pickerel Lake. Decent walleye fishing, good smallies, and if the sun's just right, lots of jumbo perch. But, never stayed at PC Camp so can't help you there.I seem to remember a thread last year on PC Camp. Try the search function at the top of the page and see what it calls up."
