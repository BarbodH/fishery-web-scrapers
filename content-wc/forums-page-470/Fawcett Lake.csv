1337741,SinOrSwim,2011-08-05 18:39:00,1528,"I know there is a 30""+ fish in the narrows that should still be swimming up there! Probably bigger now after I caught it and released it. I go with morgan and hawk and the fishing on both north and south gull is fantastic. We have had many days up there catching fish to eat was difficult. Difficult????? Yes, too big to keep. Couldn't catch fish small enough to eat. A very very nice problem to have. The river by the North cabin has never produced very well for us. Others say it has but we have tried it many times with little success. Some yes, but a LOT of snags and it's a pain in my opinion.Many other places that are easier to fish and produce much better. Lots and lots of shore lunch areas on both north and south as well. I'm trying to remember if it was fawcett we went one day to find a shore lunch spot and Morgan Man ended up with a crap load of ANTS in their boat. LOLOLOL Nothing like sitting off shore watching a grown man scream and dance yelling ANTS ANTS ANTS!!!! lololololHave fun!!!"
1337848,Angry Minnow,2011-08-06 08:35:00,14,"The river looks like it would be a day's drive anyway, the narrows looks like a interesting spot though and close to us, that 40' hole looks like it drop's fast what depth range do you try to work? We seem to always be about 15 +/- I'll try to stay away from the ant island but it make's for a great story."
1337919,Hawkfan,2011-08-06 15:11:00,237,"We usually troll along the southern side of the narrows and mostly the eastern half. It drops off pretty quick in some areas, but there are some good underwater humps too. The eastern point has a hump that comes out so it looks from the water that you are out in the middle of nowhere, but there is still good structure. Perfect place to find the hogs come up from the deep spots. And I think the ant island was on Zionz. But wow did they move fast! Both the ants and the two guys on the island. Good thing too, I think we were looking for a place for shore lunch and the ants were up by their heads before any other boats could get up to the shore!"
1338019,MorganMan,2011-08-07 06:48:00,341,Ant island is on Zionz.
1338042,Angry Minnow,2011-08-07 08:01:00,14,"This ant story makes me think of the time several years ago we had a cabin that was infested with mice, as soon as the lights went out you could here them crawling up the screens they were every were, so anyway my dad some how catches one and puts it in my nephews tackle box. The next day he's out on the lake and when he opened that box that mouse didn't just crawl out it jumped right at him and things got wild I don't know how he didn't end up in the lake."
1338242,Hawkfan,2011-08-07 21:23:00,237,I'm glad I don't fish with your dad! I've seen people go in the water from a lot less. That's good stuff.
1338501,MorganMan,2011-08-08 18:23:00,341,"OMG, that is hilarious. Now you've given the clowns in our group something else to do!! We too have had some infestations when we flew out of Kenora years and years ago."
1338530,Angry Minnow,2011-08-08 19:44:00,14,"Bad news... Just found out that we got bummped to Otatakan there telling us that forest fires are the problem, not the fire but smoke and ash is so bad they had to fly a group out early."
1338577,Hawkfan,2011-08-08 21:53:00,237,"That sucks. Hopefully that is as close as it gets up there. I can't imagine being a camp owner this year, wondering if your cabin will be there the next day. If you get a chance again, I wouldn't hesitate to book a trip in that lake system in the future."
1336625,Angry Minnow,2011-08-02 14:12:00,14,Have a trip booked for late aug. anyone fish Fawcett or Gull?
1336728,MorganMan,2011-08-02 19:27:00,341,"We have been flying in to Gull for at least a dozen years and have had great success there. We have ventured to Fawcett and Zionz on occasion, but have stayed on Gull the most. We have our spots depending on which end we stay. We do hit the narrows between the 3 lobes of Gull and have found fish almost anywhere we look. Have a great trip and post an update when you return."
1336769,Hawkfan,2011-08-02 22:29:00,237,"I go with MorganMan and can't say enough good things about that lake system. One year we ventured up to Fawcett and nailed the walleye right out in front of a cabin that was being built at the time. It couldn't have been more than 100 yds away. I think the only reason we were that far away from our cabin was to explore new places, because like he said, you can find fish pretty much anywhere. You will enjoy it for sure."
1336795,Angry Minnow,2011-08-03 06:00:00,14,"When you guy's fly in what outfitter are you going with it was my understanding there were just two on Fawcett, Pickeral Arm and L&M."
1337036,MorganMan,2011-08-03 18:56:00,341,"We flew for years with Verne and Slate Falls Outposts which is now owned by John at Red Pine Outposts out of Sioux Lookout. There are two cabins on Gull, one at the mouth of the river on the north end and one at the south end. Haven't ever stayed on Fawcett."
1337084,Angry Minnow,2011-08-03 20:40:00,14,"I never herd of Slate Falls or Red Pine I'll have to look them up. Were going in with Pickeral Arm, Do you work that river at all? Does it flow in or out? I personally like some curent."
1337116,Hawkfan,2011-08-03 22:10:00,237,"I think we've only been up to Fawcett one time because the fishing on Gull is so good, there isn't much reason to go any further. The flow would be from Gull into Fawcett and it looks like the Pickerel Arm cabin is right by the inflow. One place on Gull we hit no matter which cabin we end up in is Sparks narrows. It does't look too far from where you would be. You can see the map at www.fishredpine.com and compare to the one from Pickerel Arm."
1337149,Angry Minnow,2011-08-04 06:56:00,14,"Thank's for the info, one of the reasons we decided on Fawcett is it's size and there is definetly alot of water to cover and our group likes to venture out. (the fishing is always better on the other side of the you know.) The map that Red Pine has looks a lot better than the one Pickeral Arm shows, do you know how to get the full version of that other than what prints off the Red Pine web site?"
1337290,Hawkfan,2011-08-04 12:30:00,237,I don't. Red Pine has cabins on both Gull and Zionz so you can get pretty good info from both those maps for all attached lake area you don't get from Pickerel Arm. I'm sure the map they give you when you get up there will probably be a little more detailed as well.
1337393,Angry Minnow,2011-08-04 16:56:00,14,"Thank's again for the info, I'll be sure to give you a report when I get back."
