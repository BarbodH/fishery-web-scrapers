1323609,turtle chain,2011-06-28 10:41:00,1398,any good topo maps for this lake?? and where to get them thanks much
1338259,turtle chain,2011-08-08 05:09:00,1398,There is a forest fire on the back door of the beach cabin?? It dose not look good I hope all is well??
1338346,kansasity,2011-08-08 09:48:00,80,"No it doesn't! I was on there website this morning and the have a heck of a blog on it, check it out and take the time to vote for there fishing contest. I wrote one in for a kid we saved out of a horrible crash who was going hunting one morning and never made it. It's called the Mike fishing story or something. Hope that cabin makes it through, but it doesn't look good. I don't think those sprinkler's are gonna do it."
1338377,jambi,2011-08-08 12:09:00,504,I've been following this blog as well. Doesn't look good as of the last report....That last picture showing the wall of fire behind the cabin is incredible.
1338568,kansasity,2011-08-08 21:39:00,80,"I feel horrible for them, heck that's a brand new cabin I think to. That's bad for anyone to go through."
1338815,turtle chain,2011-08-09 17:15:00,1398,The cabin survived that is good news
1272825,walleye4life,2011-02-19 09:17:00,54,I have been to Larus at least 30 times....3-5 trips a year for the last few years. It is hands down in the top 5 walleye lakes I have ever fished in my life. They have just built a new beach cabin even though we always stay at the bay. You will not be dissapointed.
1272845,turtle chain,2011-02-19 10:52:00,1398,Thanks
1273243,Basser,2011-02-20 15:14:00,31,"Barn Dog, Tshad - how did you do on Laurus last year? Don't recall seeing a report. Basser"
1273330,michigan walleye guy,2011-02-20 18:55:00,95,"I have fished Larus Lake for the past ten years--the best walleye lake I have ever been on. We have always stayed at the beach cabin, can't wait to see the new cabin this year.I am also flying into Clear Lake this June. Has anybody on this board been to that lake?"
1277874,DROP SHOT,2011-03-04 08:36:00,10,the cabin of larus beach is on the website of nestor falls fly-in and the last guy. I fly into clear for the last few years it is a very good lake i have been on larus for 5 years also herod for 5 years and the fishing on all the lake are wicked and you can tell the catch and release works the quality of the fish . I talked to Dave at the sport shows and his son Jon at one also and the cabin on larus just needs the inside to be finished. If you have question call nestor talk to Dave and Jon there are always willing to help anyone with there question.thank-you bill
1278018,turtle chain,2011-03-04 14:37:00,1398,what is the biggest walleye on Larus
1278022,walleye4life,2011-03-04 14:46:00,54,"The average walleye on Larus is 20-23"" and if your there a few days you will catch at least one that's 30"". I'm being conservative. One of the top fly-in lakes i've ever fished hands down."
1278180,turtle chain,2011-03-04 22:48:00,1398,now I really can't wait till september 10th to come thanks
1322036,BarnDog,2011-06-24 06:40:00,14,"Fished Larus this past week. Great conditions....found the eyes in ""The River"" by the hundreds. Also in ""Northern Bay"" near the NE corner., and in the NW bay which is a big flats or gradual type area.Near the creek..Normal for a cool Spring.The ""Falls "" is always interesting too and have seen monsters caught there. Fish were just beginning to move to the reefs, and I suspect that is where they will be now.. A few have asked about big fish. The numbers are way down for big fish but every year we still get a few above 28. We got a 27 last week, but tons of 23's. We return July 31...and we usually get bigger fish then. We have switched entirely to Gulp the last few years because we feel the big fish have been killed off by Lindy Rigging bi minnows and leeches. When the biggies were still pretty plentiful, we maybe caught 30% less whoppers , but still got a bunch, and on Gulp. I prefer 4"" Gulp Minnows ( black shad or smelt color). Last July I got a 40 "" Northern on a white Reed Runner ( Northland) , and a 29"" Walt on a gold 3/8 jig with a 4"" B.Shad Gulp on a reef.I have fished Larus for almost twenty years and it is awesome.Dave and Michelle at Nestor Falls Fly In Outposts are great outfitters and really nice people. This year they built a new cabin on Larus at the beach location and it is beatiful. I like the Bay personally though and it is equally as nice.I have never fished Larus in September , but I can only imagine that it would be super. There are still big fish , and I think it is recovering. The average size seems to be creeping up again. There were years (many ) where we would catch 12 to 18 fish over 27"" in 3 1/2 days. I personally watched my buddy put 6 fish in the boat over 26"" in an hour one time. That spot is a secret , but I bet you can figure out where.Channels and skinny spots. Do NOT ignore any reefs though , especially after the end of June. Consider the gulp thing , or at least limiting live bait lindy tuype rigs. When they swalow they die in greater numbers , and frankly I don't have the ""feel"" to prevent the swallowing of live rigged bait. Gulp (or similar) will give you all the action you want. Phil at Angler's Pro Shop in Nestor will help. Great guy! Groceries at the store right next to him , and finally... the ""Lawg Cabun"" is a quick and decent place to eat breakfast,. The night before we fly in we always get a tasty ice cream cone at Hillier's Souvenir hshop in the heart of Nestor , near the waterfall. Have a great trip with Dave and Michelle."
1322628,michigan walleye guy,2011-06-25 16:56:00,95,"I was at Larus in early June, and have been there the past 11 years. What a lake! I have never had a bad (or even an average) trip there. 50-100 fish days are routine, especially when the weather conditions allow for an 8-hour day on the lake. The fact that it is almost impossible to book Larus from May-August speaks for itself."
1195720,Guest,2010-05-02 06:11:00,0,"We will be heading up to Larus Lake using Nestor Falls Outfitters the first in August and asking if any one can supply us with some info on what we can expect. This is our first fly in and we will by flying into International Fall and once up to Nestor Falls will be purchasing all our supplies. Would we be better to purchase these prior to heading up to Nestor Falls? How is Larus lake fishing? Suggestions for bait or tackle. Thanks,"
1195799,Riceburner,2010-05-02 09:41:00,436,"Fished there a number of years, with Dave and Michelle and previous owners, tho' it has been quite a while ago, and mainly in the Spring. Very good fishing and outfitter. Email me if you want more details.[email protected]"
1205607,BarnDog,2010-05-31 11:39:00,14,"I just saw your post.We have been flying with Dave and Michelle for nearly 20 years...two trips a year for the last 10. Would you like to call and get the lowdown some evening? I will be up there in a week ,then back end of July. They are absolutely the best and I have flown with several outfitters.Their emphasis on having top notch equipement from thier outposts to their aircraft is impressive. You will be pleased. I would gladly talk some time.I check this site from time to time . 320-894-5545."
1205612,BarnDog,2010-05-31 11:59:00,14,"...BTW...to answer your questions...groceries in Int. Falls ,probably liqour too , althought D &M (Dave and Michelle)will fly in your beer for $10 extra a case (about $50 in Canada) ahead of your trip.Worth it on the weight savings toward your 100# per person limit. (fairly strict).We also fly in our cooking oil and pop for drink mix.We use a water purifier (Katadyn Base Camp hanging bag) so we don't fly in bottled water.The pilots and guides just drink water from the faucet.Not me. Then ... Anglers Pro Shop in Nestor (license online on their website ahead of time)...4 inch Gulp minnows ( color: blk shad and the like) , big minnows , and leeches (in that order ...really). this year was an early spring so in early Aug. fish the reefs. 3/8 oz. jigs (gold/blk, white/blk and all gold or all silver...in that order) and Gulp will leave you smiling even if you bring nothing else.The reef fish will be nuts and the Gulp catches 10 to 15 fish without reloading bait.Nobody believes it so when you convince yourself that you HAVE to bring something besides Gulp...and you are losing sleep over it...bring a pound of leeches ...you won't use them. If you stay the night before you fly out in Nestor get an ice cream cone at the store by the falls on the main drag.Good. [email protected] . subject:Larus"
1205667,Guest,2010-05-31 16:14:00,0,"Thanks for the info Mad Dog, Let me know when you get back from your outing so we can check to see how have done. We will be going up the first week in August and thinking of driving from central Wisconsin to avoid the air travel hassel. Good Luck!"
1205690,BarnDog,2010-05-31 18:16:00,14,"no problem! Have a good trip.Are you staying at the ""beach"" or the ""bay "" cabin? We come out August 2 from our second trip.We stay at the Bay. The beach is older but they will be rebuilding it in the next few years if not already. It is the last of their cabins that hadn't been redone.When they do..it will be an awesome spot.The Bay is fabulous. Dave will mark a map for you and he is pretty helpful.If you like northern fishing , there are lots of weed beds, and some big pike You are going to have a blast . You will be spoiled on this kind of fly-in!"
1205775,Guest,2010-06-01 03:52:00,0,"Barn Dog, we will be staying at the Beach the same week that you'll be up there, Let me know when you get back and we will need to talk befor this trip. We will have a group of four coming up, looking forward to it."
1206108,BarnDog,2010-06-01 21:24:00,14,"Cool Tshad. We arrive to LArus on July 29 and return August 2. We will have to compare notes. You will like the BEach .It is older but the beach itself is nice . The seperate cooking and sleeping quarters has advantages .Like I said they plan to redo it sometime but I stopped there last year and it is still pretty nice.Another advantage of the Beach is how close it is to the Falls which is a great spot and has nonstop action.We head up there next Tuesday and fly in Wed. We return Sunday. I talked to Michelle today and they have had an early Spring , but now it has been cooler.I think the fish will be out of the river and into the main lake.It is better fishing in July/August , and it seems like we catch bigger walleyes then. .And the bonus is some pike fishing when you get tired of hoisting walleye after walleye. We can touch base when I return.You can email me too or I will check back here too. HAve fun planning your trip! I just went thru all my supply boxes and checked my lists. We bring most of our stuff in several Action Packers which are pretty watertight , and pack well in the plane. Waterproof bags for your clothes etc. is a good idea. I am rambling... you probabaly have your own ideas. Talk to you later."
