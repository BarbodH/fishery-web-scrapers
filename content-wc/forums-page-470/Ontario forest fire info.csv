After a little poking around, I found some info. If you're curious, here's a link to a map of the current and recent fires in the province, courtesy of the MNR:http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...ap_English.htmThe map shows the status of the fire, the probable cause (almost all are from lightning), when it started and how big it is. Just click on the little balloon tab for the fire in the region and you'll see the data.Of course, good luck to all the lodge owners out there. Here's hoping you get some rain, but without all the lightning.- Steve"

Two weeks ago, we flew into a lake (40 miles north of Lac Seul), smoke came in and for a while visibility was less than 1/4 mile. The smell was awfull and I thought we might have to spend the night in the plane, fortunately later the wind changed and it cleared. There has even been smoke in the air as far south as Dryden on occasion. I can't imagine being on a fishing trip anywhere close to any of the many fires that are burning. You might want to call or e-mail your outfitter to see what their conditions are, before going and sitting in a smoker for a week, if the camp is in one of the effected areas. From what I hear, the fires (locally) have been mostly north of Lac Seul, one somewhere around Ear Falls, others around Pickle Lake and Red Lake. The air water tankers have been going all summer and equipment has even come in to help, from other provinces and the States. Hopefully they will get a good rain in those areas and not many of you will be effected."
1338020,dogrodder,2011-08-07 06:52:00,400,We were on Wabigoon Thursday morning and the smoke had indeed made it's way in. Visibility was about a mile at one point.

It's smokey here almost every other day, I constantly see bombers going north and west. All the pilots i've talk to say it's like a black waste land way up north. We need heavy rain without any lightning."
