1338309,Walleyegolfer,2011-08-08 07:49:00,18,Thanks for the report......Sounds like you had a good time....It is ashame you couldn't get into Ord as it is a fun lake to fish but at least you were able to get them on Thaddeus. We leave on Friday. I can't wait.
1317440,Lunge1,2011-06-12 14:27:00,9,Going up to Thaddeus Lake Resort for the 1st time in 2 weeks. Just wondering if anyone had any information to help us get started on this chain of lakes? I will make sure I post a trip report when we return.Thanks
1317476,teddi,2011-06-12 16:41:00,349,you are not really on a chain of lakes there. you can boat down to ord or you stay where you are. i can think of a lot of lakes that are better in the same area.

1317562,Lunge1,2011-06-12 20:13:00,9,"Jay, Yes I did. Thank You very much, the information is very helpful.Dan"
1318040,Muskie Bob,2011-06-13 22:22:00,45,"There is a tunnel contecting Thaddeus Lake to Ord Lake. Depending on your boat and outboard motor you may find it difficult to return to Thaddeus Lake. The water flows from Thaddeus into Ord. There is a large rope on the right side of the turnnel to help pull your boat when going from Ord lake to Thaddeus.As to once into Ord Lake, I've seen several boats from Thaddeus Lake go into Moose Lake. I assume most of them were fishing for walleye. I'm sure your resort will provide you with proper information regarding entering and returning from Ord lake. Good Luck."
1320987,Walleyegolfer,2011-06-21 15:01:00,18,"I fish Ord and Moose a few days every year we are up there in August/June. Only Fished Thaddues once......didn't do much there. Late June is excellent time to fish walleye on Ord. I would concentrate on the the weed egdes on points with a jig and minnow or troll along the outter edges with cranks or lindy rigs. The main part of Ord tends to have the larger walleye in it but don't overlook puzzle bay. The water is a little more stained back there usually but the walleye fishing can be awesome, with some really big northern caught there as well. Moose can be good at times as well. There are a TON of weed beds in Moose.....basically all the way around if you are bored you can catch little hammer handles all day in there with some bigger ones as well. Walleye for us have been a big hit or miss there. There are either a alot of big ones or they are not there, in our normal spots anyways. Last time we went there in June we had our best fishing in Moose. Wish we had more time to find them but a day or two a year can really handcuff you when you try to go to different lakes everyday. Sorry I am not much help on Thaddeus but hopefully this will give you a head start this year.....oh and BTW save some fish for us when we get there in Mid-August and give a report once you get back....."
1326994,JayM5209,2011-07-07 10:58:00,1050,Bumping this up to see if Lunge1 has a report on the trip to Thaddeus and Ord lakes. Thanks for any report.
1337681,Walleyegolfer,2011-08-05 14:50:00,18,Bump for a report.
1338084,Lunge1,2011-08-07 10:29:00,9,"Well here is the report. Sorry about the delay.I went up with my brother and our main target was going to be Muskie.Fished the last week of June. Overall it was a good week. We boated 14 Muskies over 30"" in the 5-1/2 days of fishing. Two biggest being 47-1/2"" and 47"". Muskies were chasing smaller bucktails. Bucher 700 Series type. Key was weeds. We had 20-30 follows some days. Not bad for the 1st time on the lake.Walleye fishing was fair. Live bait and minnows were the ticket. Caught enough to eat dinner and if we had tried, I would have said the fishing would have been good. Caught 6 over 25"" with the biggest being 29"" The muskies keep on calling us back.Also caught some nice Pike when we were Ski fishing. Had 6 over 36"" with the biggest being 39""One dissapoint was that we could not get into Ord Lake due to low water. Really wanted to fish this lake.The guys at Thaddeus Lake lodge did everything they could to make our stay a good one. Great place.Lunge1"
