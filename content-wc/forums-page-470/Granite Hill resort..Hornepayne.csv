Haven't been there since so I dont know how it is today. Very friendly people running the resort at the time, dont know if they are the same owners. I stayed on the Granite Hill lake, never went to the outposts didnt have to, fishing was great right where I was, Good luck if you go."

Very clean cabins 6 of them usually held 6 people and 1 of them I believe held 10 people. Dishes, towels, linens were all furnished. Also had a motel unit with 4 rooms each good for 3 guests and extra cots if needed. Good boats and motors, minnows,etc... sauna and fish cleaning station and so much more"
