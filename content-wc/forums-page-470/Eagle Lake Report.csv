It was the best in 9 years, caught tons of walleye 30 being the biggest and a good amount of northern. Friday the 29th myself and 2 others caught 66 walleye in 3 hours on the flats. We caught 115 for the day that consisted of 6 hours. We backed trolled craulers most of the week with a few leeches thrown in. All in all it was the best time in the 9 years we have been going up. Totals for the week 973 walleye caught by 9 people. Great Time."
