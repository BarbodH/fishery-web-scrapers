1338548,fishforlife,2011-08-08 20:22:00,77,"Deputy,Don't listen to mapquest, take 17 to 631 north to 11 west to 584 north to Nakina. Good luck to you, my group of 8 leaves on the 19th to fly into Brace Lake on 21st.Take Care,Rob"

1338644,Guest,2011-08-09 07:54:00,0,"we use this road every year and it is in good shape .use caution in the low light times of day,there is no shortage of big moose on this roadway. the only drawback on this is after you leave Hornepayne there is only one place on rte 11 to get fuel before you get to Longlac. we use 17 to 631 to 11 then top off the tank at longlac ,backtrack 12 k's to the logging road then take the crib road to nakina watch on crib road there was acouple of culverts that were collapsed on the north bound side keep your eyes open on this road also moose cross at any time of the day. enjoy your trip . plenty of wildlife and goood fishing ..."
