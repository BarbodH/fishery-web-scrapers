Said these camps are located about 10 miles east of IF, and there's about 40 miles of water to fish going east out of these camps. We are heading up either the week of Memorial Day, or close to that time. Has anyone fished this area of Rainy in the Spring for walleye, and how is the fishing ? Anyone stayed at either of these camps ? Clean ? Good, bad or fair ? Dockage OK ? Are there a lot of boats on the water or can you get off by yourself ? We would save about 1/2 day's drive each way....some of us are driving up from Ohio, so by the time we get to International Falls, we've already driven 2 full days. I know this isn't a ""true"" Canada board question, though I figure some of the people reading the Canada board may know this area of Rainy lake or these camps. Thanks for any info you wish to share. Rich B"

We have stayed there for the last 4 years after a try at Island View. IV was dirty, run down, over priced and you run the chance of getting mugged by a bar crowd of low life dirtballs looking for fights."

Great food ,bar nice people and clean rooms or cabins. Check out their website."

With all the water on the US side there are a ton of places to fish and get off by yourself but remember if you are going on a ""big"" weekend like a holiday you are going to see other boats. You will not regret going to Sha Sha. IMHO"
