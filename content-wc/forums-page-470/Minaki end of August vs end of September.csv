1339367,judd,2011-08-11 09:47:00,2,We have been going to Minaki at the end of September for quite a few years. Now that the young uns' are old enough to go we have been going the end of August before school starts. Our trip is basically a split between Walleye and Muskie. Just wondering if anyone has experienced Minaki during both time frames and have any big change in fishing patterns. Thanks

We used to go late September and now have moved the trip to late August - we arrive on the 24th of August this year. As Gramps has gotten older - now 87 this year, he does not like the real cold weather that we experienced at times in late September. In addition, we also had trouble getting decent large minnows during late September. So, three or four years ago we switched to late August. Here is my 2 cents on the fishing: We target walleye, often with crank baits, so we catch our share of Northerns and an occasional Muskie. Walleye won't be quite as deep. Depending on where you fish - we favor Big Sand - concentrate more on the mid 20's to lower 30 ft. range in August. We had great success fishing late September on main lake drop offs - catching fish in the 40 ft to 50 ft. I would have to say we caught more Big Walleyes in late September than we do in late August. Our biggest being 11lb 14 oz, caught and released on Big Sand. The total number of fish boated, anybodys guess. Some years are just better than others. One thing about late September, Mesquitos are nearly non-existant. I will know more in a couple weeks! We will be fishing out of Barbers from the 24th thru the 28th. Best of Luck!"

We buy them in the states - packaged for canada. Make room in the refrigerator for them - they keep very fresh. Three of us, my brother and I and our Grandpa. See ya in eleven days! Mark"
