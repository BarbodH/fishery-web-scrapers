1333162,81Saluki,2011-07-23 16:36:00,97,Wishin -- I'm up here now. Will give you a report when I get back home on Wednesday. 81Saluki
1334041,81Saluki,2011-07-26 09:41:00,97,"Hey Wishin' -- Just got back home (earlier than planned but not because of the fishing) and wanted to give you a quick update. We always fish exclusively for walleye so I can't help you out much on the muskie front but we raised one and caught one this trip which isn't unusual. From my experience, August can be fickle. If targeting walleye, they can be shallow or deep. Just be flexible and try different depths/structures until you find something that works. Last week we thought they'd be deep (20 feet) but finally found them shallow (9-12 feet), mostly around rock piles. If you're staying at KC's or Clark's on Edwards Lake, ask them what the pattern is -- depth and structure -- for whatever you want to catch. They'll give you good advice. If you come up to Forest, don't stay fixed on the deep water trolling strategy for muskie. You can catch big ones casting near land too! A buddy of mine caught a 39-incher at the ""Big Island"" several years ago and there's always a brute (gotta be 40+ inches now) hanging around our dock/shoreline I raised him last fall while casting off the dock for walleye. There are also numerous holes for walleye around our cabin and elsewhere in the lake. So don't be afraid to give it a try. :-) If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Good Luck and Have Fun!! 81Saluki P.S. For your reference, click here for info about our cabin. You can't miss it. :-)"
