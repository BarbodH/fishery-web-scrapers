Weather was good to great all week, windy a couple days but that didn't slow us down. Caught a lot of walleye and perch but overall numbers were down a little from previous trips, but it seemed the average size of fish was up. Wind direction and some calm meant some areas we were used to fishing just didn't produce. Had to change strategies and fished the heck out of any hump we could find. My best were a 27, 26 and 25. My daughter's boyfriend came with us on the trip and caught one of the biggest walleye I've ever seen. He's only fished a couple times in his life but did a great job with this fish. My daughter was his 'netman' and handled it like a pro. The fish in the picture below was 32 1/8"" and right at 11lbs on both a digital scale and a boga grip scale. After weighing and pictures she went back in the water and swam away. My picture taking skills need some improvement as this picture doesn't do this monster fish justice.It's a long trip from Texas but since we've had 37 straight days over 100 degrees here it was worth the trip to experience highs in the low 70's and lows in the 50's everyday.Always a great trip to O'sullilvan and owners Bob and Shelley do a fantastic job.Curt"

I'm lucky I'm able to store all my gear at my brothers place and only have to show up with something to wear when he picks me up at the airport. I'm going to have to send you a PM ...I believe I recognize the shore line behind you! the shore line in this picture looks the same!Stay cool, that sweet Northern Ontario breeze is hard to beat after this heat!"
