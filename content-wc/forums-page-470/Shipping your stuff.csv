If you come in from the Bemidji side, turn right at Menards, you'll come out at McDonalds and he's just north. Good chow at Shorelunch Cafe, right across the sidestreet, also on the right side. Use the outside pump on the north side, and come in from the north, since the concrete tips toward the street. You get a nice ""full"" fill on trucks and boats. Korby's a stand-up guy, and while I've never met Outfitter17, his dad is #1 in my book. He's also got non-ox fuel and diesel in that outside pump. He gets my business when I'm in town, going north or south."
1338091,Kwags,2011-08-07 10:39:00,48,"We are flying into Internatonal Falls and hopping across the border. We would like to ship our stuff (Rods, Tackle Boxes, Sleeping bags) ahead of time to the outfitter to avoid excess baggage fees. Does anyone have any experience doing this? Who did you use and what is the approximate cost? Thanks!"
1338094,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-07 11:08:00,1460,"Kwags,check your private messages"
1338095,pike50plus,2011-08-07 11:10:00,584,"I checked this out last year when going through Winnipeg to Thom[pson,,was prbably more costly plus it's not with you?"
1338125,Outfitter17,2011-08-07 13:44:00,127,"Kwags,I have all my customers ship their stuff to my Dad's Bp Station in I. Falls. It's always their waiting for them and nothing ever gets lost. They fly in and rent car or we setup a van service for them to bring them up to our landing, they stop by the station to get their gear and then they are off on their fishing trip. If you need some info for shipping, just let me know.Matt"
1338146,Kwags,2011-08-07 15:22:00,48,"Thats good info, Matt. Do they use UPS, or the Postal Service to ship? Or something else? How do they package it?"
1338262,Skywagon,2011-08-08 05:23:00,1106,"If shipping into Canada, make sure you do it well in advance of of your arrival, as it may take a long (really long) time to get here. If passing through International Falls, there is a business there that you can pay to recieve your packages, delivery to I Falls is about as quick as anywhere in the US."
1338317,Outfitter17,2011-08-08 08:11:00,127,"Kwags,I think most of them ship with UPS, they pack their gear in boxes and just put a small lock on the rod tubes.Skywagon is also right, I think the place is called border boxes. You can ship there and then pickup your stuff on the way by. The only problem is you need to be there when they are open. If you are on the 4:32pm flight into I. Falls, they will be closed by the time you get there."
1338513,Kwags,2011-08-08 19:02:00,48,Thank you guys for your help and information. Nice to know about the place there in Int Falls. I'm looking into the costs with USPS and UPS vs. the airlines.
1339218,rnnonmt,2011-08-10 21:16:00,992,"There has been 4 of us going to lacseul for the last 4 years all the way from Arizona. We typically ship our gear UPS ground to Chicago where the rest of our fishing party trucks them up for us. We ship them well in advance (month) just incase there are any ""lost"" items which has never happened to us. 4 guys worth of gear 30lbs a piece usually cost us about 30 bucks a guy each way which is about the same as ""checking"" your stuff with the airlines (Delta). This year one of the guys became an elite Delta member and anyone travelling in his group got to check an extra bag for free so we checked all of our gear without having to pay anything this year. Size restrictions applied. We were all a bit skeptical with the airlines handling our stuff but thank goodness it all arrived when we did."
