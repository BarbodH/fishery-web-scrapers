1339244,bpetersen,2011-08-10 22:17:00,251,Have the resorts on Lac Seul this year been full?
1339277,wallydave,2011-08-11 06:59:00,2151,"We try to hit Goose Bay Camp in the NW end in early June. Andrea had some late May openings this year, but June was booked, same for next year, we will have a couple cabins for mid-June. Which end of LS are you asking about? Its a big body of water with quite a few places to fish out of, but there will be times when finding an open cabin will be difficult.Good luck!"

1339360,Mike Kansas,2011-08-11 09:29:00,1463,We patronize Lac Seul Lodge and Lost Island Lodge. Both of them have great customer service and fishing. If you want to book them contact them early because they have a lot of return customers because of their great service. Mike Kansas
1339364,JDP,2011-08-11 09:38:00,1457,Sounds like BPete is just trying to get a handle on whether the resort business has declined some this year...he's not necessarily looking for a place to stay.
1339510,bpetersen,2011-08-11 18:39:00,251,My mistake. I was asking about Ear Falls area. Thanks for the reply.
1339512,bpetersen,2011-08-11 18:41:00,251,Good service and friendly people go a long way.
1339538,Mike Kansas,2011-08-11 20:56:00,1463,Good point....both Lac Seul Lodge and Lost Island Lodge were 90% or better filled with bookings this year. Mike Kansas
