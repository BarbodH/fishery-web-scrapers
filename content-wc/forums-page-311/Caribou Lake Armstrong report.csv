3063065,bode,2014-08-05 17:08:00,39,Glad to see other people enjoy that part of Canada as well as further west.We've had several meals at the Chateau over the years as well as E and J while they were open. Mainly have meals at Gail's now--seems most of the rr workers and truck drivers eat in there usually a pretty good indicator.
3063433,Ogoki,2014-08-05 19:12:00,291,I have never post a picture here so I hope this works. This is how the Chateau North looked in 1958 . It was then known as the King George Hotel
3063745,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-05 20:52:00,1460,Very cool ...... From 1958 to 2011
3059361,bode,2014-08-04 10:14:00,39,"Just back after a week trip to Caribou Lake Lodge; walleyes were in 25-33 feet of water for the most part. Some caught as shallow as 15-18 and a few caught in water over 40. Caught a few northerns while targeting walleye but no big ones. Most walleye in the 16-18 inch range did not catch any larger than 23. Jigs used tipped with a leech, color didn't seem to matter."
3059505,Ogoki,2014-08-04 10:48:00,291,Bode you have private message. Thanks
3060177,Whopper,2014-08-04 14:54:00,340,Good deal Ten days and a bunch of us will be heading that way to fly out to WhiteClay with Mattice Lake Outfitters. We will spend Friday night on the banks of Caribou
3060489,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-04 17:43:00,1460,"Nice report. Any Blue Walleye this year Bode?Quote: Originally Posted by WhopperGood deal Ten days and a bunch of us will be heading that way to fly out to WhiteClay with Mattice Lake Outfitters.

3060521,Ogoki,2014-08-04 17:59:00,291,"Phil, I am envious!!!!!!!!! Missed going with MLO this summer but I see Whiteclay on the horizon for next June ! I am headed to Quitico at the end of the month , for an 80 mile canoe loop. We plan to spend 4 days camped at one location ,on a super walleye/ smallmouth lake. Tried to get some guys to go to Whiteclay or Caribou and they are too cheap . Sad part is all three can afford to go too. A fly in trip is money a nursing home will never get . Good luck ! Keith"
3061177,Mike Borger,2014-08-05 02:26:00,1554,Love this line.
3061361,bode,2014-08-05 06:24:00,39,"Had a few with that bluish color, but not sure if they are blue walleyes or just shaded that color due to the minerals near the bottom.Stayed at Caribou Lake Lodge---kind of old school, have stayed there the last ten years and is fine for our group especially for the price."
3062489,Whopper,2014-08-05 13:46:00,340,"Not really sure exactly where Don is going to put us up yet, two years ago we stayed at the main house that used to be Armstrong Air and Outpost, it's the outfitter that MLO bought.

KeithKeith envious? heck I'm just trying to catch up with you on these fly ins :-) I'll touch base with you when we return. Edit Bode sorry to hijack your thread, thanks for the info in your first post"
3062609,Ogoki,2014-08-05 14:27:00,291,"Sorry Bode as I am part of this hijack process too. Phil , I bet Pikeslayer8 is referring to Chateau North , right in the heart of downtown Armstrong. My cousin stayed there once and never slept a wink as there was bar fights all night ."
3062689,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-05 14:58:00,1460,"You're exactly right Keith! The Chateau is a giant step back in time. When I stayed there a couple of years ago, there were a couple of mange dogs roaming anywhere and everywhere, the restaurant/bar stayed open well past midnight filled with Indians from the reservation or fresh from the bush. No yuppies allowed! Man, that place is great! Sorry Bode, it's just good to get some talk from that neck of da woods."
