I found a website listing the marine band channels in Canada and it is a little confusing. The other boat on our trip has one and we wanted to be able to talk back and forth when possible so I got one for the trip. Being able to get weather reports on it would be nice also. Any information would be great, thanks in advance."

The problem in some areas is that there are so many trees and other objects in line of sight from the stations, it might make receiving a little tough. All Canadian stations broadcast in English and French. BOB"
3064361,Andyeye,2014-08-06 06:45:00,179,Thanks for the replies guys I will try the scan method and wait for the English versions I don't think I can learn French in the next 3 days.
