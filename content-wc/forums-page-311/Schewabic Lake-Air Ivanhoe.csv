George will have maps from prior groups mapping their best spots. We did best at the south side rapids it seemed. Never had good fishing bright and early nor at night. We'd anchor down in middle of rapids and cast all around. Caught multiple smallies of 4# size. Portage around Rapids on south end if u can get through and troll that area between both sets of Rapids. Caught biggest walleye in there but my cousin dropped it pulling it out of the water (he insisted not using a net). I'd take a spare boat up and leave it there to use all week, but not that old heavy boat. Nice cabin w showers and solar power/generator for light electrical power. Best results using ripplin red fins, reef runners, and rat l traps around points in 8-12' depths."
