3066673,1jigfish2,2014-08-06 21:30:00,110,"I was not going to post, because we never go for musky. We go up opening weekend, and again the third week in September, for walleyes. We do extremely well in the fall. We talk to other guys, going after 'skies, they do well also. I used to fish them years ago, so I know that if you want big fish, go after them in fall. Use BIG bait, and you should produce. Weather can be nice, and it can be bad. Two years ago we had pretty good weather all week, but it turned at end of week. Our last day we fished in a white out, best fishing all week. Tight lines, go ahead and give it a try, I do not believe that you will be disappointed. We stay at Northern Lights Resort, they give you free bait there. That is a big bonus. There have been lots of 50"" plus 'skies caught this summer, that should mean real good news for fall."
