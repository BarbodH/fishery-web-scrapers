We are pumped to say the least Gordy"

I'd love some intel on that lake.You've got the right idea as far as prospecting, but don't exclude some deeper diving crankbaits.Key on the windblown shorelines and structure.Having a cursory look at the map there's some pretty funky looking points at the south end of Pickle that look good. Also the two neckdown areas towards the top end of the lake. You want to check out both sides of each and the neckdown itself assuming it's deep enough. The first one looks very narrow, if it has any kind of depth it should be good.I't's actually WRA that's flying my group into John's Lake next week. I'll tell Dan you said hi. On another note I just discovered something in June when I flew into Dayohessarah. There's a couple of motels in White River that are okay as far as motels go for overnighting before your fly in.What I discovered is the White River Motel also rents a cottage in town that sleeps up to 8 people. We stayed in that and it was awesome. Same price as the motel and a great venue with a large deck with a bbq and lots of room for a big group to socialize.I booked it again next week as there's 6 in my group (3 dads and 3 young sons).If I can help you with anymore planning shoot me an email,Cheers, Mike"
3046225,gordy28,2014-07-30 17:15:00,437,Thanks Mike Appreciated. Will definitely check some the spots u mentioned and have got a few of my favorite deep divers packed as well Funny we are staying at the white river motel. Will ask about the cottage Any suggestions on dinner in white river? Not sure there is much choice but figured I'd ask Cheers Gordy
