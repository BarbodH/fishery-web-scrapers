I will be putting in at the Deception landing everyday and am wondering what area to fish. I know the Bear Narrows/Taylor Island area is good this time of year, but I'm hoping to make the shorter boat ride to Sen Bay. With regards to numbers, does Sen Bay produce this time of year? Thanks for taking the time to read. -Matt"
