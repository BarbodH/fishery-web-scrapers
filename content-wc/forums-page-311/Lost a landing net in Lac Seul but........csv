We called His cell to inform Him of His good luck, BUT He didn't believe Us....We gave the rod to a friend of His who lived really close to Him....To this day... he still can't believe We recovered that rod and reel..."

3057505,Glenman12,2014-08-03 14:31:00,762,"No landing nets overboard in our group (yet) but just about everthing else has..camera, Oakley sunglasses, stringers with fish on them, minnow bucket with minnows in them, and numerous pairs of pliers.. Just this last trip me and my partner jump in one morning with a guy whose partner cancelled on him..it was one of the crappiest days I can remember out of all our June trips..42 dgrees, steady rain and 20mph winds..we were trolling in a bay and this guy is driving the boat from the drivers seat but using the electric trolling motor with the pad on his lap...being right handed he had to cast out backhanded..well, he made this one cast and the rod just slipped out of his hands and sunk.. Lucky for him #1, it was spinning reel and the bail was still open and #2 he was using a shad rap which floats..after scanning the surface for a minute or two we spotted the lure and went over to it...got it in the boat and he just kept pulling in line til finally the rod tip came up and he got his rod and reel back.."
3058585,BoxingRef_Rick,2014-08-03 23:03:00,34,"Was bank fishing for crappie in southern Indiana a bunch of years back -casting a jig on one rod and a bobber and minner on ""The Other ..."" The last time I saw ""The Other..."" it was trailing a big airborne goose across the lake.As everbody fishing where I was snickered and then realized the guy who owned it - might be kinda pissed off - but nope; All I said was, ""this is gonna make a good fishing story some day!"" and kept on casting."

3058969,Aspencreek,2014-08-04 07:53:00,2911,Now that's FUNNY
3060097,Mike Kansas,2014-08-04 14:40:00,1463,Had the wife go over the side once while landing one of my fish. She had a red life jacket on. If anyone finds the life jacket please return it to me...EMPTY. Hope the wife doesn't see this. Mike Kansas
3048545,Bakefish,2014-07-31 11:30:00,1077,You should have just snuck it into Bob's boat without saying anything and then let him figure out how it got there.
3048601,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-31 11:49:00,461,"Was guiding Chris Pronger and his dad a few weeks ago and they got into a good walleye. Landed the fish, 31 but it was getting very dark and my boat was being pushed into the rocks so I handed them the net. They then dropped the thing in the lake, fish and all. Too dark to look for it. Went back the next day with an underwater camera and sure enough there was the net on the bottom, with the walleye still sitting there wondering what the **** was going on. Saved the net and the fish! -FT"

3049433,Pooch,2014-07-31 16:32:00,4619,"Three years ago on LS one of our boats lost a rod out of a holder when they left a spot. Another of our boats snagged the rod the next day while jigging the same area.Some long odds there, too!Pooch"
3049769,garage_logician,2014-07-31 18:03:00,346,"Two years ago I was fishing in Detroit Lakes with my Uncle. We were drifting along bouncing Lindy rigs on the bottom. We had moved off our area and were pulling lines in to go back when my Uncle accidentally dropped his rod and reel, in 45 feet of water.Once we realized what happened he set a waypoint and we tried bouncing jigs on the bottom with no success. So we returned to the cabin where he continued to lament the loss of his gear.I dug around one of the sheds and found a garden rake, some rope and a brick. With some clever rigging I made a drag of sorts. We loaded back into the boat and went back to the waypoint. I figured the odds were a million to one, but stranger things have happened.When we arrived I dropped the rake into the Lake. We went about 50 feet and I thought the rake felt as though it was not dragging correctly, so I pulled it up. And what do you know, hooked in the tines of the rake was the rod and reel. Unbelievable.Sent from my Nexus 10 using Tapatalk"
3050017,Aspencreek,2014-07-31 19:20:00,2911,"I wonder if some of that Yankee ingenuity would work to get back the 6-caps, Jig rod and reel, landing net, pisser (you know what I mean), the bag lunch, and finally the wrist watch that is located strewn about the bottom of Lac Seul."
3050161,Glenman12,2014-07-31 20:05:00,762,not sure why someone from Boston would be guiding Pronger...I get it youre the camp owner...great story..
3051065,last chance,2014-08-01 07:42:00,3262,we lost our net up on lake erie in 70' of water. and its never been seen again. a couple of yrs ago we went to the ego s2 slider net and it floats.
3051385,phishfearme,2014-08-01 09:10:00,1242,you clearly snagged this net so it must be returned to the water!
3051545,last chance,2014-08-01 10:02:00,3262,LOL you just made my day.
3046441,btmbncr,2014-07-30 18:58:00,492,"We got on a real nice bunch of fish down in the main lake basin today.My buddy was unhooking a fish he had just caught and knocked the net over the side.We finished our trolling pass and turned around.We went about 30 yds and I snagged something.Yes it was the landing net.We all were just floored.What are the odds of that happening again. All in all we had a great day on Lac Seul.We got on some concentrations of nice fish,had lots of doubles and the fixings for a great fish fry.Bill"
3046521,Fishin Fun,2014-07-30 19:25:00,218,Congrats! Sounds like you got your boat motor fixed. Looks like a couple nice days of weather coming your way.
3046753,bigtimeelectric,2014-07-30 20:41:00,174,"Bill, outstanding!!! haha glad to here your doing well... keep it up. Hope your waving to them guide boats down there...lol"
3046777,Aspencreek,2014-07-30 20:46:00,2911,"Want to NEVER lose a net again??? Take a 4-6"" piece of Float noodle and tape it onto the handle. You guys know what a noodle is right, one of those long tube things the kids use swimming. Cut a piece off and duct tape it on the handle end, it will float like a bobber, nice and cushioned grip and won't bang on the boat bottom when dropped on the floor. I have piece of noodle attached to all sorts of stuff that will sink like a stone if it goes in the water."
3046881,btmbncr,2014-07-30 21:28:00,492,good idea

3047577,jimirjr,2014-07-31 07:35:00,1149,"We had a group of guys fishing at Glendo Reservoir, Wyo. a few years back... Most of the group was pulling crawler harnesses... Me and My buddy were rigging with leeches as one of the groups boats passed us slowly on the outside. Suddenly They had a fish on and ""Bob"" grabbed the net to land Mike's fish... Bob's rod, which He left laying on the gunnel of His boat suddenly nailed a fish and guess what? Yes Sir... right over the side into 32' of water.. Next day, my Bud and I are jigging the same are when ""Pat"" says, ""fish on""! He's bringing it in and I notice His Jig has hooked some ""yellow"" mono... I tell Him, ""Hey, Bob was using that stuff yesterday."" Sure enough, We slowly reeled in the line and there was Bob's rod and reel... We took it back to camp and the laughing never ceased all nite...."
3047713,MrSimon,2014-07-31 07:57:00,922,"A long time ago I was fishing in the boat with my Grandfather and one of his buddies, Glen. Glen was the nicest guy in the world. He forgot to tie off the stringer of walleye after adding one to it. It drifted off. He was heartbroken about loosing all of our fish. A few drifts later, my grandfather caught and reeled in the stringer full of fish. Glen was so happy and relieved I thought he would cry. Just a few weeks ago while trolling a local lake for muskie, I caught a very nice 7' ugly stick with a nice shimano reel attached. I cleaned it up and it works great. Its about a $60 combo. I was thrilled."
3047745,wallydave,2014-07-31 08:02:00,2151,"One of my first trips to Ontario had a similar thing happen! We had a group of 12 guys, in four boats, we were fishing the mouth of the Wenesaga River NW section of Lac Seul, I'm not sure how it happened, but one of our guys ""lost"" his rod and reel, a couple days later yup you guessed it another guy in our group ""landed"" a big one! Couple years later we watched that guy catch a small walleye with a big pike attatched with that same rod! Only in Canada!"
3047937,Hump,2014-07-31 08:44:00,578,We had a net go over the side. I caught the same net a year later.
