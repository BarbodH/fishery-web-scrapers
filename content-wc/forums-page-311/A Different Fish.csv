3058953,Mike Kansas,2014-08-04 07:49:00,1463,Just got back from fishing the Red River below the dam at Selkirk Manitoba. It was a Catfish trip and for three days it was a blast. We fished three days and caught around 200 fish with the average fish weighing 20lbs. Our biggest was 27Lbs and even though they were not Walleye it was a great time. This was the first time we have done this since 2006 and before that we did it every year. Great place to take a youngster and watch their eyes get big and there arms get sore. Anybody want any info PM me. Mike Kansas
