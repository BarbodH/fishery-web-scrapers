3063409,onetimedave,2014-08-05 19:04:00,502,Look at Melchett Lake out of Nakina Ontario or Brace Lake also out of Nakina. Both have web sites but don't have them available.
3066409,NY Walleye,2014-08-06 19:26:00,78,I would give Air Tamarac a try in the Gouin Reserviour. Good pike and lots of walleye. Camps and accommodations are awesome. Check their website.
