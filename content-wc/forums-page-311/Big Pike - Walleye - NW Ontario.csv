3015497,camjofish,2014-07-20 20:51:00,19,"Whats your definition of big pike? We usually catch pike in the low 4o's and upper 30""s. Send me an email at [email protected] if you are interested in more info!"
3015569,Mike Borger,2014-07-20 21:21:00,1554,"I fished North Caribou Lake the last week of June and it blew me away. Best pike and walleye fishing I've ever experienced. Set a camp record for the amount of northerns caught over 40"" and if anything the walleye fishing was even better.http://www.canadafishingguide.net/no...-pike-walleye/"
3059121,tjandy,2014-08-04 08:40:00,107,"There are 50"" Pike in Nungesser. Accommodations are great at Anglers Kingdom. 18"" Lunds with 50 hp Honda four strokes and lowrance locators."
3060553,eyeman_1,2014-08-04 18:06:00,690,"We are definitely considering Anglers Kingdom.... If I were to take the wife, would the accommodations suit her? She's not a girly girl, as long as it's clean and comfortable. Decent food and great wildlife scenery. What are your thoughts?"
3061273,tjandy,2014-08-05 05:45:00,107,"I have never done their meal plan, but the cabins are nice. Heading up there in a couple days. I've stayed there about 6 times. Been on that lake for over 10 though. Walleyes can be caught into the low 30's and pike in the 50's My biggest is 45"" though, but we don't fish them much."
3061585,camp chef,2014-08-05 07:59:00,915,Cabins are very nice. We did our own cooking so I can't comment on the food. The scenery of course is spectacular.
3063145,eyeman_1,2014-08-05 17:40:00,690,"What should one know before heading up in terms of what to bring tackle wise for pike and eyes that isn't on the site, what bedding would we need to bring, should we pick up bait, beverages? Do we need bug nets, bug coils, candles? How about mouse traps, etc... As far as boats, equipment, nets, anything we need to bring that we shouldn't be without or that our own stuff would be better? Would it be a good idea to bring snacks or munchies? Ay info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
2990497,eyeman_1,2014-07-13 08:08:00,690,"Looking for a lodge in NW Ontario to take my dad and a couple of friends next summer for a shot at big pike. We've been fishing LOTW the past several years and it is a tremendous lake and awesome multi-species lake. We've been fishing in and around the Big Narrows area so we've had great fishing close to the lodge. We've been kicking around something different and a new adventure, specifically for something remote, and for big pike and eyes. Something we can either drive to and boat in and or fly in. I've been looking at Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser Lake. Does anyone have any insight good or bad? Can anyone comment on the accomodations, food, service, boats, equipment and most importantly the fishing? What can we expect for avg. size and or numbers. Tactics / tackle needed. What is the walleye fishing like? What is a typical day like and what is the trip into the lodge like? Thanks and I appreciate all info and suggestions."
2993265,camp chef,2014-07-14 07:53:00,915,Search past threads for information on Nungesser and Anglers Kingdom. I hope to go back again. It is worth the travel.
2995770,eyeman_1,2014-07-14 18:35:00,690,"Thanks for the info. What were the eyes and pike like? Numbers of eater size eyes or were there larger fish to be had. Also what kind of numbers were there for big pike? Cabins - were they acceptable? Not looking for Taj Mahal but comfortable and clean. Enough room for gear and the ability to hang clothes to dry out? Suggestions for time of year and suggestions for places to stay on the way up? Coming from 35 mi west of Chicago. Was thinking of staying in Dryden or somewhere in that area. Usually stay in International Falls on way to LOTW, but since this place is much further north, wanted a short am drive on day of arrival if we go. Thanks."
2995834,Fred_G,2014-07-14 18:44:00,908,I would highly recommend Old Post Lodge on Lake ST. Joseph. I've been going there for 18 years and the fishing gets better every year. Here are links to the website & Facebook page:http://www.oldpost.com/https://www.facebook.com/oldpostlodge That first posting on Facebook is me last Friday.
2996018,Blades-n-Beads,2014-07-14 19:29:00,484,"Eyeman, give LacSeul a whirl you won't be disappointed . Some great camps on LacSeul"
3003706,eyeman_1,2014-07-16 18:15:00,690,"We fished Lac Suel years ago back in the 90s and stayed once over at Ojibway Outposts. I loved the lake and the fishing, but would not recommend going back to that place... long story there. We are still kicking around where to go, but really are looking for a big pike / eye lake. Nungesser is interesting, but we are open to suggestions. Worse case we go back to LOTW."
3003858,ftfarms,2014-07-16 18:49:00,444,I would stay with lotws but stay in miles bay or obabikon big walleye and big pike. I fished lac suel for years have no reason to go back The smallmouth and crappie fishing on lotws is the big kicker for us
3003906,Blades-n-Beads,2014-07-16 18:59:00,484,"I hear ya on that one. I fish LacSeul once a year every June and low 3 times a year, the reason is the bonus sumo perch. My wife just loves them when we get into them it's just a blast. Great eating to boot. I've done better for big walleye on LacSeul over the years but LOW is hard to beat for multi species."
3003970,eyeman_1,2014-07-16 19:16:00,690,"Agreed. We really like where we've been going, the fishing is fantastic. Just looking for something different. Short of going to the far north, which is a little pricier than I'd want, just looking for a place in NW Ontario where I can get my dad a big pike."
3004034,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-16 19:36:00,1460,I recommend Moose Point Lodge. http://www.moosepointlodge.com/
