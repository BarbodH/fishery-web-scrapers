3035585,Painter1,2014-07-27 15:46:00,26,Do you use a leader with that?
3036705,forgop,2014-07-27 23:43:00,880,I really want to get some new braid. I've been using the Fireline Crystal and less than trilled with it. My line shouldn't be snapping when I cast in the back pond for bass.
3036785,Mike Borger,2014-07-28 04:02:00,1554,"For walleye 5lb moss green Power Pro for jigging, no leader required. 10lb for trolling/casting. Awesome stuff wouldn't consider using anything else."

3037665,MrSimon,2014-07-28 09:58:00,922,"When trolling in rocks, how does the Power Pro stand up? Other braids I've used begin to get threadbare and then break at the worst times. Leaders can certainly take care of this, but if there is a braid that is more abrasion resistant, I'd try it."
3039265,1100 Remington Man,2014-07-28 16:13:00,73,"My take on all of this. Tried Fireline when it first came out loved the sensitive feel with it but hated the wind knots I would occasionally get with casting it & the wrapping on my rod tip. Went to ProwerPro 4lb diameter and liked it better, used it with & without a Mono leader & did have less wind knots.. Well this year went to Canada with 4 lb diameter ProwerPro on one spinning rod & tried 8lb diameter Fireline on my other spinning rod big mistake way to heavy & unessary for walleye, no wind knots but poor casting distance with it. Here's my take today I'm 53 & been fishing since I was a child and Walleye fishing for 40 plus years, I have fished IA,MN,LA,SD,NE,WI,IL Canada more than 15 times. I'm going back to 100% Mono Line in my Spinning Rods & plan on buying Berkley's best line in Mono for Spinning Rods. I'm on the fence Braid vs Mono on my Casting Rods for big Northern Pike. I hope this helps & to be truthfull for 99% of the time 4 & 6 lb. Berkley XL will do for Jigging & is better than most other lines that I have tried. Cost has not been a factor in my choice of lines. Good Fishing"
3039305,Mike Borger,2014-07-28 16:26:00,1554,"Depends on what you're trolling. If it's a bottom bouncer then obviously no fluoro leader is needed. If I'm banging crankbaits off a rocky bottom then yeah, I'll tie on a 2-3' section of 12lb fluoro. Most of the time, like 80%, you're not banging bottom like that so I just tie the braid direct to the lure (with some kind of cross lock snap).I rebelled against braid for a long time before finally converting now I use it for almost everything. The benefits FAR outweigh the negatives. Bear in mind no line is perfect."
3039361,yoopertrout,2014-07-28 17:01:00,1172,I haven't used a leader with the 15 lbs. for walleye. For muskie I do.
3056377,Lanningjw,2014-08-03 07:54:00,3,My issue with the braid is it flips over the tip of the rod and causes tangles when your jigging. Rigged my bottom bouncer rig with XT and so far so good on a bait reel. Am impressed with that line.
3056625,octanehi5,2014-08-03 09:16:00,1104,"On your line shy lakes ,mono or floro, will out fish braids. on a good Canadian shield lake when the bite is on, on the 100 + walleye days,Braid will out fish any other line,Just because of its lack of stretch,and twice the strength, 6lb Suffix 832,for jigging,10 to 12 lb for other types of fishing.Your drags have to be set differant for braid than monos, givin the stretch of mono & floro's needs to be set at a higher poundedge, than braids.Once you load the rod with the braid, keeping the rod loaded is key,with a 2lb drag set it gives you plenty of hook set power with 6 lb braid. With a proper hook set you should be hooking your walleye in the top center of the mouth, line never gets to the mouth of the fish. Braid or any type of line can be bitten off by any toothy criter. Your reaction time to the first tap is key setting the hook at the same time as the second bite down. if your hooking your walleyes deep in the mouth,you are waiting to long to set the hook,and yes sometimes they just inhale the baits. Braids teleghaph the bite much better than mono or floros, Jigging with an ultra light or light rod will always out fish a less sensitve rod.Alot of guys laugh at my small rod choices, but at the end of the day my totals are higher than their's Just to prove my point this yr.I brought a light pan fish ice fishing rod ,used a 1/4 oz knuckle ball jig that bent the rod about 4 "".I caught walleye's while the other guys were not, using the same baits. The key to catching a great number of walleye lyes with being able to feel the bite. I like a rod that you can feel a gnat land on it,one piece rods. If you are comfortable with the line you use, you will not second guess youir self. Its why they call it fishing and not catching"
3025393,1shooter,2014-07-23 21:16:00,1493,What do you think is the best for jigging a 1/4 jig for walleyes?
3025577,forgop,2014-07-23 23:05:00,880,"I've used braid and about to give up on it. Between last summer fishing for largemouth in the pond behind my house and my fly-in trip last September, I found my line just snapping in both applications. I get that northern will weaken the line, but it was odd that my line would snap while casting."
3025601,Guest,2014-07-24 00:34:00,0,"I have tried many braids over the years. A couple years ago, I converted over to PowerPro 10# Moss green, NO leader, mostly because my eyes and fingers can't make the splice. But have never felt a leader was needed. It is by far the best on the market in my opinion. Far superior to fireline. Quiet thru the guides, limp, casts further, works very well with slip bobber rigs and light jigs. Not quite sure what to think about people that are getting birds nests. I don't get them with either fire line of power pro, but will get them with trilene xl, hate that stuff. I did have breakage issues with nanofil and super slick, but no problems with PowerPro."
3025689,ftfarms,2014-07-24 03:37:00,444,The lightest jig you can get away with is the best. If there's not a big wind or currant 1/8 is all we use. If its to windy or a little currant than we go 1/4 or heavier Thats how we fish.
3025705,octanehi5,2014-07-24 03:46:00,1104,"Braid has been my go to line for more than 10 yrs. Power pro about 5 yrs. ago and now suffex 832, You can always tye on a floro leader, depends on the lake you fish,.I tye directly to the braid jigging,6lb for Walter and 10lb for pike,ultra light rod for jigging,. with the braided line,can not be beat. It all boils down to what you are comfortable with."
3027481,Danbear,2014-07-24 14:31:00,72,"I am a big fan of Crystal Fireline, I like being able to feel the bottom better and the subtle bites. When we jig in deeper water (Over 20ft) we tie straight to the jig has not seemed to make a difference. I don't put a backing on my spinning reels, I do put a wrap of electical tape around the spool before I spool up, stops the slipping and gives the line something to dig into. I like the fact of getting 2-3 years or more out of the line."
3028089,Further North,2014-07-24 17:54:00,2008,"I have braid on everything I fish these days. The only downsides I can come up with:It will break if you drag it over rocks, docks, or toothy critter teeth. Solution: Leaders. I use fluorocarbon or Tyger Wire depending on the circumstances.I've never had a situation where the fish ""seeing the line"" has caused a problem, but can see it as a potential issue. Again, leaders are the solution, fluorocarbon is the best choice if seeing the line is a problem.If you go with the same line test as your fluorocarbon/mono...it is much, much thinner and will slice a finger in a heartbeat. Solution: I use the same diameter line with the benefit of getting much more strength. I loose a lot less lures...I don't understand the ""stretch-helps-set-hooks"" issue. Being able to instantly set a hook on a fish the moment you can feel them (and you feel them much sooner on braid) outweighs any disadvantage I can think of, for me. YMMV.Brands I use: Suffix 832 and Power Pro."
3028121,muskyman73,2014-07-24 18:20:00,402,"I use fireline on spinning reels and mostly power pro on baitcasting reels. That's what I find works best for me. I get the fireline on ffo-tackle.com, great prices."
3031065,Painter1,2014-07-25 19:20:00,26,I snapped a lot of Nanofil line on a hookset until I learned to really loosen the drag. The biggest advantage to using Nanofil is the extreme casting distance while still being able to set the hook. Very easy to tie a leader to without the need for a swivel.
3035209,yoopertrout,2014-07-27 14:05:00,1172,"I like power pro 15 lbs for walleyes. I know it sounds heavy, but it looks to be about as thin as 8 lbs mono, and I've heard that if you go much lighter, you can get wind knots. I like 80 lbs power pro for muskies. It's heavier than needed, but 65 lbs seems to dig into itself on the reel and get more bird nests. I've found that I can feel the bites better when jigging for walleyes with braid. One caution, don't grab it with your hand to break it. It's strong, and a doctor friend has treated people who have sawed through their tendons with it. . ."
3022529,bigcreekdad,2014-07-23 07:25:00,74,"I'm sure this has been asked before, but thought I'd get some recent views. I've been using Trilene exclusively for many years. From 6lb to 17lb on my spinning reals. I seem to see more folks using braided these days. I realize the no stretch of braid has its advantages, but are there any disadvantages? Also, does braid line twist like mono?"
3022593,Pezman38,2014-07-23 07:40:00,3196,"Braid can be seen easier so using a leader can be important. Need to back it on the spool so the drag works correctly, this means a connection to mono (this also saves you money). If the guides on your pole aren't for braid it can cut into them (long shot with this, I haven't seen it happen).I have some hi vis braid on a spinning pole now and have a leader on it with a drop shot for bass. So far it was worked just fine. Seems to twist up a bit less, but within a few trips I am usually back to mono."
3022769,ftfarms,2014-07-23 08:32:00,444,We've done the circle of line. Mono than braided than floro-carbon and now back to mono. We've found mono to be our favorite for our spinning reals for walleye and smallmouth fishing but I still use braided on my musky bait casters. I think it's more preference on what you want out of your line but we still prefer mono for casting and jiggling with spinning reals.
3022897,Carnhzkr,2014-07-23 09:14:00,964,"Another consideration with the thinner diameter braid is it can tend to dig into itself on the spool. I prefer braid over mono and use it on both my spinning and baitcasting reels. I think it works great for jigging, although as pointed out, you should use a flouro leader as it is more visible. It is much less buoyant than mono, so you can use a 10 or 12 lb. braid and still feel the bottom with 1/4 oz. jigs (maybe even lighter, but I haven't tried).One thing I'm not good at is tying the flouro leader using a blood knot. I just use a small barrel swivel anymore. Seems to work okay, but I'd much rather tie about 7' of flouro directly to the braid. With a barrel swivel, you have to remember it's there so you don't reel it up into your tiny lead eyelet.The main reason I prefer braid is so I can use a single outfit and switch between bottom bouncing and jigging. The line is strong enough for BB and light enough for jigging."
3022993,adempsey,2014-07-23 09:45:00,963,"I have braid on all my spinning reels. The thin diameter and no stretch outweigh all the disadvantages for me. At least so far. The only time I use mono now is if I am targeting fish using topwater baits.The main disadvantages for me so far have been:1) Increased chance of knotting or birds nests. This doesn't happen all that often, but it does happen on occasion. I can usually undo the knot though, but sometimes I have to cut the line.2) Line wrap. This happens more for me than with mono. The line gets flipped up over the rod tip and wraps around. Not a huge issue, and it still happens with all line types, but my experience is it happens more often with braid. 3) Initial cost. It's more expensive to buy, but you can easily use it for twice as long [or longer] as mono so it ends up being similar or cheaper.4) No stretch. Although this is a great thing, it can be bad too. I broke a rod a couple of years ago because of it - lb test was too high for my rod and was trying to remove a snag. Lesson learned =)"
3023073,Brookieslayer,2014-07-23 10:09:00,123,"the best part about braid for jigging is the ""feel"" of the tick bite... also the 2lb diameter has less ""push"" on the line when fishing with for example 10lb fireline crystal. you can drag a lighter jig deeper. The visibility of the line when you are following a slack line drop is also a huge advantage... I can see any change in the line, slack, sideways movement, etc.. I also run the mono backing on my spools as it helps to keep the spool from being stressed. You need to run a little lighter drag on the reel with braid as there is no stretch. one last thing I do it attach a 10lb fluorocarbon leader, usually Seagar to my braid with a crazy Alberto knot. Hope some of this helps. tight lines."
3023321,fishron,2014-07-23 11:05:00,317,"I use fireline (not really a braid) and other assorted braids on spinning and bait casting setups. The great sensitivity of these lines have increased my enjoyment of fishing. It can feel every tick of the bottom. Even the slight change of picking up a small piece of weed. When the forward line gets worn, (usually when wind knots occur), I reverse the line on the spool. Superlines don't take a memory when their on the spool and don't pick up a twist. I'll use a fluorocarbon leader, using a tiny spro swivel. To me it's the best fishing set-up that's ever been available."
3023329,MrSimon,2014-07-23 11:14:00,922,"I was a braid man for years, but have recently switched to floro for my spinning rods and heavy braid for my musky rod. Things I don't like about braid:Its noisy when you reel itIt frays easily in rocks and breaks easily when frayedZero stretch means pulling a lot of hooks out of the fish's mouth I find that floro is much more abrasion resistant, is quieter and smoother, and the little bit of stretch if provides helps me not lose fish. I use 6lb floro on my jigging rod and 12lb on my casting and bouncing rods. I use steel leaders when casting for pike and I tie my crawler harnesses with 20lb floro."
3023881,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-23 13:48:00,241,"I'm old school,braid for musky, and northerns, mono for everything else. I hear talk about ""feel"" with braid, but that means they ""feel"" you also, and I would bet they ""feel you first. Tackle Co.'s need customers, and fishing shows need viewers to sell the latest and greatest tackle, use what works for you, being able to use your tackle correctly is what catches fish!"
3024545,kzoofisher,2014-07-23 17:01:00,5144,"Braid for jigging and finesse techniques, mono for everything else. Like others have said a leader is nice, especially in clear water, also ease of tying and because braid is less abrasion resistant than mono or fluoro. Haven't had more issues with twisting compared to mono and less than with fluoro. I usually start with a 4' leader off a quality swivel, Maxima ultra green unless visibility is more than 15' which is when I use fluoro. Retie when I get to 18""-20"". I know plenty of guys who use the leftover line after re-spooling mono reals as leader and they seem to do just fine. I usually use that line for tying up spinners, rigs, dropshots and stinger hooks so I buy small spools of leader for the boat."
