3059073,port1042,2014-08-04 08:24:00,509,How does this work? Do you make gaiters with it?
3042177,515,2014-07-29 11:52:00,254,"I haven't found anything yet to stop them as I swear they land teeth first, mostly just have wear socks once they start."
3046041,ftfarms,2014-07-30 15:39:00,444,I will have too agree on white mountian. I seen somebody before had said this and got some off of eBay and it works well. The best I've used.
3046337,Iowa4ND,2014-07-30 17:47:00,35,"Mother used to use a dab of pure vanilla for gnats. Not sure it will work on the ankle biters. Going up to Nungesser end of next week, anyone see the flies and skeeters backing off ? We've never had them bother us on August trips"
3049713,stillangling,2014-07-31 17:43:00,149,"The beast they are referring to is the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans). They are very common in NW Ontario. I first encountered them in Timmins about 30 yrs ago. Couldn't understand why the ""house flies"" over there would bite you. I never encountered them growing up in central Ontario. I think they must reach peak densities in NW Ontario. Probably has something to do with the densities of deer and moose over here but they can be just nuts. If you put your feet up they won't bug you as much. The locals call them ankle biters and that is not by chance. They go for the lowest point. I tend to be a bit of a fashion maven but my approach is wool socks with my sandals. Deet will also work but you need to apply it often."

3055393,Golden Eagle,2014-08-02 18:15:00,2642,A clean boat helps.
3056025,big popi,2014-08-03 05:45:00,635,"We just got back from Canada yesterday, pretty warm and sunny so the black flies were horrible. For the second year (from advice gained here on WC) we used Coppertone Sport 30. It worked great, nothing I have tried even comes close."
3057313,Guest,2014-08-03 12:31:00,0,Avon makes a new product that contains Skin So Soft and various insect repellents. Comes in spray - with sunscreen and without - and works great. We used it last year and so far this year and results have been good. Have to reapply every 2 hours or so.
3058105,maddogg,2014-08-03 18:53:00,178,Tin foil !! Worked for me.
3059041,Aspencreek,2014-08-04 08:13:00,2911,"X2 It seems that the biting flies don't show up in my boat unless one of us catches a Northern that we can't boat side release. If that thing hits the net, the flies come in from 2 counties away. And it takes a good power washing to get the slime remains and stink out. So for you guys that fish for Northern or Musky.......take along a good supply of ""whatever"". I don't target them, don't want the slimey buggers in my boat!"
3037305,AllenW,2014-07-28 07:54:00,11482,"They liked my black socks.. I carry a fly swatter, nothing better than seeing the little buggers die. Also gives ya something to do when the fishing is a bit slow. Al"
3038297,stevensinks,2014-07-28 12:11:00,330,We were at Red Lake last week. The first part of the week they were REALLY bad. I had taken some spray that is meant to use on horses. I sprayed the boat and our socks down with it every 2 or 3 hours and that did the trick. After a couple of days the fly's were gone and we had no more problems.
3038481,metalmike,2014-07-28 12:50:00,1,I know that for mosquitos a thermacell works really well. Has anyone tried one for the black flies?
3038801,btmbncr,2014-07-28 14:20:00,492,White Mountain Insect repellant works great for ankle biter flies.Bill
3040593,dcraven,2014-07-29 05:00:00,47,Utralthon applied about every 45 minutes. DC
3040633,Mike Borger,2014-07-29 05:12:00,1554,Depends on precisely what you mean by ankle biters. That's a pretty vague term.
3040873,mrwalleye5,2014-07-29 06:35:00,1922,"Different flies need different methods. The biting flies we encounter generally in early summer that have about a 2 week season look like miniature house flies but can they be annoying with their constant biting. They just love the ankle area. Copper Tone keeps them at bay for the most part. The larger, meaner ones we call horse flies...they bite right through light shirts and socks. For them a firm two handed grip on a fly swatter is the only thing I have found to dispatch them."
3041289,Labsrit,2014-07-29 08:12:00,142,I use a soap made by Watkins called Basic H. I mix it 1/3 Basic H and 2/3 water. It works awesome!!!!

3041897,shortmag,2014-07-29 10:28:00,70,Try Shoofly black fly repellant by Blackberry Creek Soap Co. The stuff works great for about an hour and then another application is required. Stuff saved an Ontario trip with my wife.
3034801,cbprov,2014-07-27 10:57:00,1010,"what do you guys think is the best to keep way to keep those biting flies, they chew your ankles ,have not found a good repelant .nw ontario is worst i have seen it"

3034945,Elrik,2014-07-27 12:27:00,82,Dark socks! I found they were attracted to the bright white socks and ignored black ones.

3036329,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-07-27 19:54:00,45,"We tried Coppertone Sport, Deet, etc. All that did was make them hungrier. What worked the best for us, was wear long jeans and Velcro the bottoms or duck tape the jean bottom. You have to cover your socks or they will bite right through them."
3037033,Aaron-IN,2014-07-28 06:45:00,500,"The Coppertone Sport worked really well for us with the black flies, it did nothing to stop those larger biting flies (not sure what they are called but they look like a common house fly)."
