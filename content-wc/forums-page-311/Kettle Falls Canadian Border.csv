My question is how long does it take to go from Kettle Falls to lake Kabetogama, I do have a Garmin gps/fishfinder on board. Thanks for your help, and any fishing reports would be awesome."
3058177,imafishslayer,2014-08-03 19:06:00,64,Northern Lights is one of the farthest points on Kab to Kettle Falls. I would say it is about an hour cruise from there. The route can be confusing so make sure you have a good map and plan your landmarks - is easy to get lost.
3058273,Nimstug,2014-08-03 19:27:00,2605,I agree with the hour estimate. We've made the trip from the national park ramp to K.F. which is about 20 miles one way. I would not rely on a gps alone. I strongly suggest you get charts from these folks:http://www.fishermaps.com/ Maybe the resort sells them or the local bait shopsYou will need chart E-17 for Kab and chart E-20 for Namakan. The charts have the locations of the navigation markers and their identifying numbers so you can follow along. I ordered the two earlier this year and they arrived within 4-5 days. We'll be in the area in about 6 weeks. NimstugCommit To The Indian
3059713,camp chef,2014-08-04 12:34:00,915,It is a pretty easy trip from the landing in the N.P. There are a couple tricky spots though. It would be best to have someone who has been there before mark the trouble spots on your map. It is a piece of cake once you have done it.
