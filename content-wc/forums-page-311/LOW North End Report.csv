By end of week this has been the best week of fishing in 35+ trips to this water. Water levels are still very high, 3-4' most areas. Walleye have been widely scattered throu out the water , good fish at all depths, one day they like a jig and crawler next day no way. They want bouncers and big blades. My best fish was taken on Friday at dinner time! 12:00 sharp my wife landed my 31.25""walleye. 10 min later same spot my daughter hauled in her best fish at 27"". Crazy lunch hour. Both fish bit #6 deep cup yellow backed blade with orange/baby blue front side with lime green beads, I had tied up 4 of these and they were hands down the top choice for the entire stay!! 20lb flouro with 2 blood red circle hooks. Best bite seemed to be at 22' and up on reefs. Mid day was best. Winds were light and full sun. Great trip with wife and daughter, headed back in 3 weeks. The big perch were few and far between , managed to bring a few home but not as many as I hoped. Good luck to those headed up."

Stopped for weiner roast on shore and by the time we got back on the water we couldn't keep them off using jigs and either leeches or worms. This kept up until 3:00, then it stopped just as fast as it started. Went back to same spot on Monday morning and got a few but nothing like it was on Saturday. It's a weird year."
