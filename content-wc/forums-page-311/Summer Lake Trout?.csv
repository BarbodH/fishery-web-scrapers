So on Friday I'll be going up to spend a week in McInnes Lake, through Viking Outfitters at Red Lake. The lake is 20+ miles long, with depths of 150-200ft. Needless to say I'll be plumbing the depths at some point for some trout! But the thing is, I've never done it before! I have several rods, medium and medium heavy spinning and baitcasting gear, and I've stocked up on some spoons and plastics I think will work. My main questions concern actually finding and catching the fish. I've never jigged 50-80 feet down before...I don't even know what size weight is needed! Will 1/2oz be enough or should I go bigger? My plan is to mostly run the depth finder and try to jig schools of fish, but I'll probably also try three-way trolling a rapala or something down there. I imagine even the 30 foot diving Tail Dancers are too shallow for mid-August Lakers? How much weight would I want to add in front of the crankbait? And how much of a dropper line to the weight? I was thinking just a few inches since I don't want the sinker getting twisted up in the line or something. As far as line, will 12lb flouro be good enough? I expect to catch fish in the 2-10lb range, but I think I have a decent shot at a 20lber. Next, where should I look for trout? Should I fish them like a walleye, fishing off main lake points and breaks, just out much deeper than I normally would? Or should I just troll the main lake basin and hope to find a school? I know that Great Lakes fisherman just go for open water schools, but I've heard about Canadian fish relating to structure more. So advice there would be helpful. Finally, any other tips you guys want to share would be much appreciated! Again as far as baits go I'm thinking jigs and twister tails/paddle tails, jigging spoons, trolling cranks, and I'll probably bring some salted sucker minnows up to throw on a plain jig, anyone ever tried that? Thanks guys."

Also, VBay Gord has a very good intro to the subject posted on the web site for Vermilion Bay Lodge at http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/lak...hing-tips.html.Just a few suggestions for you -* 12 lb. line is plenty* Take a few jigging spoons, such as blue/silver Little Cleo, silver Crocodile spoon, Kastmaster, etc.* If you have them, a large blade bait is excellent for jigging lakers* Troll with three-way rigs, using 5 or 6 oz. weights and stick baits (they do not need to be deep divers with a 3-way). Black/silver, blue/silver, and feel free to experiment with colors. I've had lakers take anything from silver to green to orange in every imaginable color pattern.* Take some heavier jigs, 1 and 1 1/2 oz, with a few white 4"" or 5"" twister tails and large white tube lures.Good luck! Let us know how you do."
3065657,dcraven,2014-08-06 14:06:00,47,"Just got back from the Vermilion Bay area. Our lakers were shallower than we've ever seen at this time of year. We even caught one on a flat line at about 8 in the morning with a large reef runner, probably running no deeper than 22 ft. Weird year. We caught smbass on flasher and fly in 35 to 45 fow and got the lakers at 28 to 45 fow. Fish shallower in the early morning as these fish are making forays into the upper portions of the lake to feed on young perch and ciscos suspending over deeper portions of the lake. That being said, if the fish are more normal as summer progresses, they should be holding in 60-over 100 fow at this time of year. Drive around, use your sonar. In low populated lakes, I drive around, mark fish, drop on them, jig them for 5 minutes and move on. Most hit on the first or second drop if they are going to. Move on. If you are drifting and fishing 'blind', find likely areas. Drop it to the bottom, reel to the top, repeat. Lakers will hit at the surface after following out of the depths. FUN! DC"
3065681,dcraven,2014-08-06 14:10:00,47,"BTWay... My favorite jigs are the River2Sea Aji jig and the Diver Vibe 80. Both baits about 1 and 3/4 ounces. Problem is, they quit making the darn things this winter. If you can find them, buy all you can - trust me - be a hoarder. They are that good. Good luck with that, though as myself and a few others are ahead of the curve on that. Good options are the Heddon Sonars and KenKatch Bucktail Jigs.DC"
3066057,rdbalmer,2014-08-06 16:21:00,279,"You've gotten some excellent advice so far. I'll add a bit more for you to think about. If you are looking for the River to Sea baits and having a tough time finding them give Tabers Bait in Bemidji Mn. a call. They had a very good selection the last time I was in there. A good friend of mine was using them the last time we went up to Canada together and pretty much put on a clinic with them. Drop them to the bottom and work them very aggressively. I don't think you could keep them away from a laker that actually wants it. Tabers also stocks the KenKatch jigs that were mentioned. I would recommend the 11/2 or 17/8 ounce size. I know it sounds awfully big but when you are fishing that deep it will help you keep your bait more verticle. Drop it all the way to the bottom and reel it toward the surface at a fast pace while giving it a good jig every so often. Fish the River to Seas the same. Think of it as verticle casting. It truly does work well. If you want to tip it with some sucker meat it won't hurt but we've caught lots of them without. We usually try to find a school of them that are suspended, hopefully near a school of bait fish, and drive up wind a ways and drift back over them using the baits an techniques I described. As Dcraven mentioned if they are feeding you will normally catch one right away. You can also take a heavy beadchain sinker and add about a 3 foot leader to it and use a craink bait on it as the lure. Do the verticle casting thing with this set up also. Some of the baits that have worked the best for us were hot n tots, rattle traps, wally divers. Our best colors were without a doubt green chartreuse or blue and silver. The lake we fished had a lot of cisco and I'm sure that played into it. Last year my son and I trolled lead core and crank baits and did well also. It just isn't quite the same as feeling them smack a jig or bait being vertically jigged though. It is something to consider though. I would recommend a no stretch braid with a mono or flouro leader for jigging as you will be in fairly deep water and you do need to get a GOOD hook set on these fish. They have strong jaws and get a good grip on a bait which makes it a bit harder to get the hooks into them. Also make sure your hooks are very sharp. It does make a big difference. Good Luck Rob"
