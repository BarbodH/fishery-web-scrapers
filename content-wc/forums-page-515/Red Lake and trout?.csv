1235707,Guest,2010-09-14 20:02:00,0,"Hello, Allan Trout on red is C&R/artificial/single barbless. But I live on Red, and never target Trout, walleye only, and I've never caught more trout than in the last 3 or 4 years. The trout on Red were/are in trouble, however I think their coming back strong. Have a great trip, and if your fish-n pipestone for wally's I guarantee the trout will be attacking.... Good Luck"
1235739,AllenW,2010-09-15 06:02:00,11482,"Thanks, C&R and barbless is fine, lots of my tackle has the barb bend down already.We used to fish for them in the 80's when we were up there, but I think we stopped fishing for them either because of low fish count or they became a protected species..don't remember.I have a couple friends who either live up there or have a place up there, I think they can help also, but ones hard to get a hold of and the other is prob prefishing for the big walleye tourny so I'll see him when he gets back to Mpls.Just looking for alternatives....thanks.Al"
1233736,AllenW,2010-09-07 11:28:00,11482,"I may finally have a trip back to Red Lake, woun't be till next season, but at least its getting back there.One of the resorts on their website mentions trout as one of the fish to catch.Can you catch trout on Red??Seems they stopped that years back if I remember right???Maybe it was just C&R??Trying to figure the regs out but still can figure what zone Red is in.tiaal...been to long."
1233739,ranger22,2010-09-07 11:33:00,124,Nope angling for lake trout is not allowed. Not even catch and release. But you will have your hands full with more walleye then you can handle.Good luck
1233746,AllenW,2010-09-07 12:01:00,11482,"Thanks, that's what I remembered.Used to enjoy the ride up to Pipestone bay and fishing for trout...o-wellYa, fishing is good up there, been doing the red lake trip for over 35 years now, just missed the last couple.Used to stay at the Chkuni river campgrounds until old age took the fun out of camping. Al"
1234424,AllenW,2010-09-09 13:49:00,11482,"Guy I hopefully will be going with wants to fish for trout..I guess I do too, any lakes near Red that you can reccomend that have trout and you can fish for them?Keeping or C&R either is fine.tiaAl"
1234535,ranger22,2010-09-09 20:45:00,124,Trout lakes up here are usually harder to get into. If you are staying with a outfitter he might be able set something up for you. Let me know know it goes.
1234586,AllenW,2010-09-10 06:28:00,11482,"No outfitter, but maybe whatever resort we stay at will be able to help.Thanks, for some reason I'm having a hard time figuring what zone red is, any idea?That may help me find a trout lake near red.Al"
1234764,ranger22,2010-09-10 19:18:00,124,Ya that's what I mean. Resort. They should be willing to help you find something. Zone 4
1234767,ranger22,2010-09-10 19:24:00,124,If you choose to do a fly in. Big trout lake has everything your looking for. I don't know what the lodges are like but you might find something you like.
1234772,JDP,2010-09-10 19:32:00,1457,Red Lake is in Zone 4:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...nr_e001324.pdf
1234804,the Sandman,2010-09-10 22:55:00,13,"From the Regulations posted, I saw that you can only use artificial bait with a single hook to fish for lake trout. The catch and possession limit is 0, so it is catch and release only.I hate it when those trout bite while walleye fishing............"
