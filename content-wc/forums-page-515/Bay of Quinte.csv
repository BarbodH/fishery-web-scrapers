1234844,rebs,2010-09-11 07:43:00,7587,great map Komo
1234846,rebs,2010-09-11 07:45:00,7587,"after looking into it more, I guess Tip of The Bay is not such a great place to stay anymore. One place I read even said it is slated for demolition WOW it used to be a great place"
1235464,Guest,2010-09-13 19:02:00,0,"If you are going to be in the Kingston area for your trip, you can head out into Lake Ontario and get those big walleye everyone waits for in the fall. Last trip out I landed 5 walleye over 10lbs and 3 over 12lbs. No need to wait for the fall rush on Quinte when all the trophy walleye are out in Lake Ontario right now waiting to be caught.

1235519,Shellback,2010-09-14 05:22:00,8083,Would you care to elaborate a little on that? You could PM or email if you like. Thanks!
1232427,Shellback,2010-09-01 18:43:00,8083,"Any decent walleye action on Bay of Quinte in Sept, or does the action not heat up till later in the fall?"
1232483,FISH HUNTER,2010-09-02 03:35:00,161,The fishing is pretty good in September but the later it gets the better. It is mostly resident fish right now but come late October and into November the fish from the big lake move in. This is when it really heats up and there are alot more bigger fish to be had. FISH HUNTER
1232487,Shellback,2010-09-02 05:41:00,8083,Thanks! I'll be staying on the river over in Gananoque and was thinking of taking a day trip over to Quite.
1232526,octanehi5,2010-09-02 08:30:00,1104,"The fishing at the bay is good now, but like fish hunter said, october is better and nov. is even better yet. Lots of big fish in numbers.we are going the end of oct. for a few days. Its the best place in my mind to catch a walleye over #10 lbs. I have one mounted on my wall ,Big fish"
1232597,rebs,2010-09-02 11:29:00,7587,"We were there quite a few years ago and stayed at The Tip Of The Bay Hotel, it was a great place to stay. Not a fish camp but a very nice hotel. We went in Setember and we thought the fishing for walleye was great"
1232831,Superdad,2010-09-03 08:00:00,64,You might want to keep an eye on www.quintefishing.com to see what is happening on the BOQ. Cheers
1232956,Shellback,2010-09-03 14:48:00,8083,Thanks for that link! The wife and I will be arriving sometime after the 15th if the weather looks good. What's a good launch coming from Gananoque? Thanks!
1232984,FISH HUNTER,2010-09-03 17:54:00,161,"It really depends on what part of the Bay you wanna fish. If you're looking to fish in the Hay Bay, Picton Bay area than either the launch at the Glenora ferry on the Adolphustown side or one of the launches on Hay Bay. You could also launch out of Napanee. It would be a longer run by boat but much less of a drive from Gan. You could also launch out of Deseronto but I'm not sure what the condition of it is like. Have heard it can be a bit tricky when the water is down. Belleville has an amazing launch as well if you are looking to fish the western end of the bay. Feel free to pm or email me if you need any directions or have any questions and I'll help you out as much as I can. FISH HUNTER"
1233049,Shellback,2010-09-04 05:13:00,8083,"Thanks, I'll PM or email you with some questions. Sure would be nice to have a starting point!"
1233782,Shellback,2010-09-07 13:45:00,8083,"Fish Hunter, Sent you an email the other day."
