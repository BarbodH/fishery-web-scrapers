1234437,Moondog,2010-09-09 15:06:00,362,Power Pro 8# for jigging and Power Pro with a flouro leader if dragging a bare hook and live bait or a spinner and live bait. 50# Power Pro for casting for northerns.
1234521,NYBowHunter,2010-09-09 19:19:00,35,Absolutely love Seaquar InvizX Fluorocarbon - 10 or 12# for 'eyes and 15# for pike.
1233829,sidewinder,2010-09-07 16:21:00,96,"headed to canada in few days fishing for walleye, lake trout and pike in fairly clear water What do you all suggest? I have used 14lb fireline as a one line does all think about floro carbon for walleye and trout have used some cajun red is line type as important as testor other way around? sidewinder"
1233854,Mich_Fisherman,2010-09-07 18:25:00,292,"6 lb fireline for jigging 14 lb Trilene Sensation for trolling, it same diamter as 10 lb XL or XT so the dive charts work 17 lb XT or Big Game for steelhead and lakers 30 lb Fireline when fishing dipsys or jets with a 17lb XT leader"
1233890,Rich B,2010-09-07 19:54:00,1081,"I really like Power Pro - yes, it's more expensive but it lasts, is limp with a small diameter for it's strength....I'll go with 10 - 15 lb test, all depending if I'm jigging or trolling, etc. Good luck with your Canadian trip.....in less than 2 weeks I'm heading up to Cedar Lake (up by Lac Suel) for a week of walleye, pike and Musky fishing (and I'll be wetting a lot of power pro line along with downing a few cold Blues nightly at our fish fry's). Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing. Rich B"
1233898,Baitslinger,2010-09-07 20:19:00,93,"I've always been happy with standard old 8# trilene XL for most all the rods, with 10 or 12 pound XT for the heavier casting rod for pike. I like to keep things simple. I change off the line every year.We did a school science project a few years ago for my son, and the trilene XL tested as good or better than other mono. Stren, which we had been using for a few years, tested out very poorly."
1233899,bpetersen,2010-09-07 20:27:00,251,4 lb. diameter red Stealth braid. It is good stuff and lasts a long time. I use it jigging and trolling with a lindy rig. I know all about the line stretch in certain situations but set the drag right and I have no problems. I just don't like to switch lines all of the time and have ten rods in the boat. 4 lb. fire line isn't bad either but have has some fraying with it.
1233961,GOBIG,2010-09-08 06:27:00,126,"I like powerpro. Have been using it on big and small fish. It is better to have more poundage than needed, than to not have enough when the big one comes."
1234000,JayM5209,2010-09-08 08:49:00,1050,"I'm with ya, Baitslinger. 6 or 8 lb. Trilene XL on almost all the 'eye rods. 4 lb. XL on the ultralites for perch/panfish. I'll usually have a baitcaster with 10 or 12 lb. XL for trolling cranks or bottom bouncers.For trolling or jigging lakers it's 12 lb. Trilene Big Game or 10 lb. Quattro Pro, just because that's what's already on several reels I use for saltwater surf and flats fishing. This has been my set-up for many, many years. Lose tackle to northerns, but 6-8 lb. XL is sufficient for any walleye fishing. About every other year I'll strip off the top 50 yards or so of line, use double uniknots to attach line of the same size, and refill the spool. With only the top 20% - 25% of the line ever coming off the reel, I never was able to understand stripping it all off so I could spend more money when respooling.Sidewinder, just keep it simple, don't worry too much about getting the ""right"" line, and enjoy your trip.Just my $.02 worth."
