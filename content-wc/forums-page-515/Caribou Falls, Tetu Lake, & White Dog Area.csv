I have been going up since 1976 to the KCR Landing & KCR Camp and fished mostly from White Dog Dam to the KCR Camp and down to Swan Lake. I am planning to explore the area from KCR Camp to Tetu Lake and possibly on up to Caribou Falls this year.Generally fish for the walleye in 10-20', but last year due to the high water temps in September, we had good luck in the 40' range.We have only caught crappie in Swan Lake, never outside of Swan Lake? Any info would be appreciated."

Our group fished the KCR area from camp to Whitedog from the early 70's to the early ninites. We occasionally went into Tetu for big northerns. In the early ninities we started venturing more into Tetu/up to Caribou Falls and the Boundry falls areas. Since 1995 we've been going to Caribou Falls camp. We still go down to the KCR area occasionally, but in general find the fishing more consistant past Tetu Lodge (towards boundry falls) and at Caribou Fall dam than down by KCR. Would be interested in hearing how/where you fished for crappie in Swan."
