1234926,Baitslinger,2010-09-11 15:43:00,93,"Always been annoyed by this-- when jigging a plastic tail or live minnow, we seem to get some hecklacious line twist. I try to leave line out and lift the jig out of the water and let it untwist itself, but in deeper water it doesnt get the job done. Its gotten bad enough where I have let the line out behind the boat with nothing on the end, then just reeled it in to straighten it back out, but its never long before the twists return.Vertical jigging works so well sometimes, but the twisted line is really a pain. Any other ways to deal with it? Would a barrel swivel 3 or 4 feet up the line help?"

1234956,polaris-pete,2010-09-11 17:51:00,343,I use a small #10 Spro swivel on my line while vertical jigging ice fishing and it helps quite alot with the line twist.I started using these swivels a few years ago also while jigging out of my boat. It does help alot here to.I usually put about 6 ft of line between the floro leader and my main line. If the line doesn't untagle then I respool with new line.

1235088,AllenW,2010-09-12 10:55:00,11482,"X2Make sure you use a good ball bearing swivel like Sampo, I usually also run 8# test mono as the main line and 6# for the leader after the swivel, that way if you get snagged you just loose a few feet of line.I also make my leaders about 4 or 5 foot, personal choice I guess.Even if spooled wrong, this set up has always worked to get the line spooled right.Just let a bunch out while trolling slowly and no lure on and reel back in, may take a time or two but should work..Al"
