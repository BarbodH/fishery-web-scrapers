1233689,J-Man,2010-09-07 08:36:00,191,"Fishing has been above average in general the last few years in my opinion. I can only base this on results from our people and others I speak to of course, but I think the sample size would be more than big enough to speak in general terms. Wallleyes have been great...both size and numbers are increasing. Several 30 plus inchers again this year and the 28-29 inchers have been too many to count.Muskies..average size of fish caught has been excellent...fish have been thicker on average than they were a few years ago. Big fish numbers are quite good...the 46-49 inch fish have been really showing up....the 50s have been there, but still more falling off than getting caught...that is the way it always is it seems! The 54"" minimum and nearly 100% catch and release attitude is doing wonders for the upper end class sizes. Northerns...the 24""-27"" below slot northerns have been tougher to track down, especially later in the season it seems...the slot and above slot fish have been increasing with the regulations...the 40 plus inch class pike have been excellent.Smallie population is quite good..bass tourney a couple weeks ago proves the qaulity of fish in the area. Cabbage weeds have been declining in Sabaskong..most of the blame seems to go to the rusty crayfish population. Some areas that were lush year after year don't have any weeds now. The last couple years have seen a distinct decline in traffic on the lake. It seems several, especially island resorts, have been going through some lean years. Overall, it's a great time to be an angler in and around Sabaskong Bay. Less people fishing catching more and more fish."
