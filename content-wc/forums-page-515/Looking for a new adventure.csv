1235617,wallydave,2010-09-14 12:29:00,2151,"What lakes have you fished before? My boat/cabin buddy have always fished Lac Seul, I would like to try a new lake or two, but he is locked-in on LS. Are you looking to fly, boat or drive-in? There is planty of water up north, good luck in your search!"
1235619,jsmyers,2010-09-14 12:33:00,198,What do you fish for?
1235637,camp chef,2010-09-14 14:25:00,915,"We fish for everything,but the lake has to have trophy Walleye and Northern potential. We have fished Nungesser,Winnipeg River,Indian Lake,Holinshead Lake and Longlac.This trip needs to be a boat in or drive in as we like to take our own equipment at least once a year and we are flying in later in the year."
1235724,GNO,2010-09-14 22:01:00,153,Pipestone offers some great multi species fishing and good opportunity at a trophy. Shoot me an email or PM if you have any specific questions
1235985,jsmyers,2010-09-16 10:07:00,198,"I've seen some calling fish over the slot ""trophies."" I don't agree. I'd consider pike over 40"" and walleye over about 29"" legitimate trophies in NW Ontario. Because of the ability of the prairie lakes to grow huge pike, master angler cuttoffs for Canada are usually 42"". I'm not sure about walleye.I don't know much about the other lakes you mention, but I don't see a lot of pike and walleye of those sizes coming out of Wabaskang. LOTS of pike bigger than 35"" and walleye around 25,"" but it doesn't seem like a great lake for real monsters. But there are some.From the fishing reports I read, pike numbers seem to drop off drastically around 40"" and few walleye make it to 30""Here are the websites of the camps on the lake:http://www.peffleyscamp.com/http://tallpinescamp.com/http://gawleysparkviewcamp.com/http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/http://kingfisherlodge.com/http://www.wabaskangcamp.com/My understanding of Wabaskang and limnology makes me think that Wabaskang is too fertile to have oxygen in the cold depths in the summer. This means that ciscos and whitefish aren't as plentiful as they might be in other lakes. Without a large forage base of this type, the real giants have a hard time growing. There are benefits to the fertility as well though."
1236238,@Lunker,2010-09-17 11:11:00,835,Pipestone can indeed offer some quality fishing for all 4 game species. The added bonus is that it has lake trout as well. However it can be tough to fish at times.....the water is quite clear.
1236417,Stu,2010-09-18 11:21:00,472,"""Limnology is the study of inland waters."" I wish you guys would stop using words I have to look up! I agree with you tho JS, I haven't seen lots of really big fish in wabby. Still a great lake all-in-all, but those monsters are hard to come by."
