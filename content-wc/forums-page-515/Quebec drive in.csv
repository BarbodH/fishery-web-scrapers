1234982,octanehi5,2010-09-11 19:30:00,1104,"You can drive to the gouin it has very good fishing,many outfitters,house boats, cabins"
1234987,vteye,2010-09-11 19:48:00,812,"Check out Barrage du Gouin and stay at there outpost camps. Great accomodations, 16 foot boats with 20 hp 4 strokes, hot showers, good not great fishing, spring is best late May first week or two of June. Overall highly recommend we have stayed at Outpost camps 5 times now in last 10 years."

Good fishing and very good outfitters Parent Lake is right on Rt.113 but it is a large lake about 29 miles long so crowding is not a problem.Berthelot is about a sixty mile drive from Senneterre on a good dirt road,50 mph no problem.By all means go early spring for best water levels at Parent.Water level no problem at Berthelot."
1235333,Fishing Traveler,2010-09-13 10:47:00,19,I would have to suggest Nemio Outfitters on the Gouin. We had a great time with them. PM me if you want some more details about our trip or look back at some old Walleye Central posts. Chris
1235797,Guest,2010-09-15 11:35:00,0,Poutricourt is really a pretty decent fishing lake for walleye with some good sized ones and there really are few pike to contend with. Trolling and jigging both work well.
