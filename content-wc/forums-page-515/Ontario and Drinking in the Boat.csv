1103445,rpieske,2009-05-08 12:55:00,1276,"I would hope American fisherman would use some judgement, but I imagine it rarely works that way. Sounds a little different put that way, don't you think?"
1103451,jigman 2003,2009-05-08 13:01:00,981,"I tried to make it clear that I wasn't attacking Canadians and Canadian law. Not trying to get into a pi$$ing match here. To me, having 2 beers over the course of two to three hours IS using judgement. I do not and never have advocated being able to go out, get hammered and drive your boat around. I do feel that moderation is fine. I realize the law exists because to some chuckleheads moderation is equal to whatever you can drink plus one. Sorry if you took it as an attack, wasn't meant that way. I think my posts here over the years have been nearly 100% supportive of Canadians and Canadian law. Like I said, your country your rules. Sometimes it appears that government (not just yours, ours too) in an attempt to protect public safety becomes over zealous. I think I'm entitled to that opinion. If you don't, you're entitled to yours."
1103485,@Lunker,2009-05-08 14:49:00,835,"1) Yes, it's against the law.2) Yes, you can get nailed with a pretty hefty fine.3) There are guests who go to the same camp I do on LOTW who carry COOLERS full of beer out for the day and don't get busted. (unfortunately, it's probably the boat that only has one or two brews per person that would get checked.That having been said.....1) How remote is your fly-in? Especially if you're in a location where you're the only party on the entire lake, how much attention do you think you're going to get from the authorities to begin with?2) Anyone who is concerned about their blood alcohol level while technically breaking the law deserves to get nailed. IMHO, quaffing an ice cold adult beverage or two during the course of a day (which I DON'T do) isn't going to hurt anyone. And let's be honest boys, there are a LOT of us who ""bend"" the law every now and again."

1103488,Larry Mac,2009-05-08 15:33:00,530,"Hello fellow Canadian Fisherman,We were checked last spring on a very remote lake(portage only). Seen a couple of guys drifting along shore (only boat we seen all day) waving their arms, we thought they we in trouble but they weren't. They made a very thorough inspection on everything including our day coolers. We are non drinkers and were fortunately legal. It was very apparent that they were very serious.If we were drinkers one of our concerns would be if we were convicted of DWI in the boat we would not be allowed back into the country for many years to come. I do not know that for sure but everything I read leads me to believe that. For all the obvious reasons from safety (ours and others) to the legal issues, the risk-reward does not appear to be there.One Question: are you allowed to bring a beer with you into the boat for shore lunch? This year we will have a few beer drinkers with us.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1103491,dirt,2009-05-08 15:39:00,144,"Let me be the first to say I was wrong. I got pinched for having an open container in the boat last year. The fine was $120 Canadian. I had been driving the boat all day and wanted to have a beer, so I switched with my boat partner and he took over at the helm. Let me make this perfectly clear - I WILL NOT drive a boat and drink. Needless to say I was pulling in a trophy walleye and the newly opened beer was at my feet when the boat with the officers showed up. They were very nice and explained the situation very thoroughly. I was wrong. I won´t do that again and I respect them for doing their job. I realize I will probably get some flack for this, but hey, I made a mistake that I won´t make again. All I can say is save the drinks for camp."
1103498,v-bay gord,2009-05-08 16:28:00,3168,"I'll be honest and say I have bent the law....yes, I have drunk a beer in the boat. It was very tasty. Will I do it again, you can count on it.....with clarification. Depending on who I am with and what we are doing. Example...we are doing some portaging into another lake for the day. I will pack one beer each on ice and leave it in the boat for the days end.....a reward for walking the trail there and back. We will drink the beer in due course.....not wave it around while heading down the lake.....and the empty can or bottle goes back in the cooler or pack. Common sense tells me that it is not an issue. Should I be stopped and checked I will not hide the fact and should I be fined, well I can accept it but I would be surprised at the lack of common sense of the offficer. All that being said, it is a serious issue because of the knuckleheads of this world who end up killing someone or themselves because of this.....the rest of us pay the price. Let common sense prevail. A beer at a shorelunch is not the end of the world.....ie one each.......meeting up with a big group for lunch and having all the beer, now that is not common sense. I'm just being honest with how I feel and how I sometimes bend the rule.......not that often, and with an eye to being cautious. A $120 fine may convince me to do otherwise, but in some situations the law is just stupid. My name is Gord, and I am a beer (singular while on the water) drinker."
1103516,hogridnfool,2009-05-08 18:46:00,349,The OPP does fly around in float planes looking at boats through binoculars. If you are drinking on the water you might find a plane landing next to you and having an OPP officer writing you a ticket.
1103531,Glenman12,2009-05-08 19:41:00,762,"Hi Larry As you know we've been going to Cedar Lake for 25 years...I have never once seen a conservation officer there..one year, we went on a one day flyout to a remote lake (Vaughn Lake) and we got checked by a conservation officer..we had no beer and thankfully we were under on our fish"
1103242,pegasis0066,2009-05-07 16:01:00,64,"I booked a fly in with an Ontario outfitter and on his website was a sternly written section about how seriously the Province takes open container and the blood alcohol level of those in the boat. Has this always been the law? I guess it makes sense to apply car alcohol laws to boating, but there is a part of me that is sadden by the fact that you can't have a few beers while fishing, especially when you are the only one on the lake. Disclaimer - I know, I know - drinking and driving, boating, snowmobiling, bicycle riding, walking in public, etc is socially, morally, and ethically unacceptable and I am ignorant to think otherwise."
1103256,Golden Eagle,2009-05-07 16:36:00,2642,Your outfitter is giving you good advice.
1103282,pikepaul,2009-05-07 19:13:00,16,I think you answered your own question.
1103285,JAY221,2009-05-07 19:33:00,877,"I've been going since 93 & we were told then to do what you want BUT if you get caught it is VERY serious stuff & illegal. I have never been confronted by one of those fine officers & don't want to meet one. Later, Jay"
1103303,Jesse-WI,2009-05-07 21:30:00,534,"for the record, even an empty beer can in the boat will get you a fine."
1103328,jigman 2003,2009-05-08 06:20:00,981,"Yep, empty beer cans or even a bottle top can get you some consequences. That being said, we do partake responsibly in the boat from time to time. We realize that could get us a ticket, and if over the limit a DUI. If you get caught, don't complain. You know you are taking the chance. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
1103332,Golden Eagle,2009-05-08 06:43:00,2642,"Question: should we pick up litter on the water if it includes an empty beer can? I have, but it could end up costing me."
1103333,AllenW,2009-05-08 06:45:00,11482,"Years back we would partake in what I'm sure was excessive amounts, getting older and wiser we cut back to maybe having one or two during shore lunch.Its used to be that generally out of sight out of mind was good enough to get by the DNR, not so sure that still holds true though, and would depend on who stopped you.This is one of them, If your gonna play you may have to pay things.If your bound to have a beer or two I'd definitely find out what the penatly was for getting caught, your choice then as to whether it was worth it or not.If your drunk and they stop you, I doubt you'll get off with a warning, no matter who stops you.Al"
1103346,Guest,2009-05-08 07:32:00,0,"Any time I have been stopped on the water (by OPP or an agent) they asked if I had any beer/ect in the boat. They have always been very professional to us. I agree with the others, if you play the game you could pay. It's no secret the CAN govt' looks down at drinking and operating a vehicle on land or water. Look at the DUI thread at the top of the fourm it covers a lot of information. One thing you might want to take notice of is they have dropped the limits on blood alcohol from .08 to .05. Here is part of a news release from ckdr yesterday.....First Charge Under New Law The Dryden Police Service has laid its first charge under the new drinking and driving regulation. Officers stopped a vehicle and found that the driver had a blood alcohol limit of between .05 and .08 milligrams. Wallace"
1103440,jigman 2003,2009-05-08 12:40:00,981,".05 is pretty much 1 beer I imagine. I certainly understand why rules like this are put into place. However, it does seem a bit excessive to me that if a guy is on a fly in lake with nobody else around and has 2 beers that a ticket would be issued. I know, your country your rules. Just seems a little bit over zealous. I would hope most MNR and OPP officers would use some judgement, but I imagine it rarely works that way."
