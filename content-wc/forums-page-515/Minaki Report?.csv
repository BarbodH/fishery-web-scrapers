Fished the bays from the railroad bridge south to power lines and on calm days we tried areas off the stretch. The weather was mostly sunny but cool. Dropped down to the high 40's at night. Only had 1 day of heavy rain, which lasted all day Friday. Caught several northern, most were in the slot. Only a couple that were over. Tried Potato Island down by the power lines for walleye, but the winds made it hard to fish. If you are taking your own boat it might not be a problem, we had a rental from the resort so it was a rough ride everyday. Had to work for the fish we caught. Recommend you watch the weather forcast. Watch the road for construction from Kenora to Minaki several spots are down to gravel with pot holes. Very little warning before you hit it. Border crossing both ways was the easiest I can remember. Agents were very nice. Wait time was less than 10 minutes each way."
