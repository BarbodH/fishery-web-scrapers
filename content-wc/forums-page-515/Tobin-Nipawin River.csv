1234678,Topwater,2010-09-10 12:57:00,484,Lots of small walleye and the guys who are putting there time in on the river have been getting at least 1 28 inch plus fish in there 2-3 days here. The unstabble weathers not doing us any favors but the Pike fishing in the river has been great for over a week now. Steve
