We only caught 1 walleye the entire week on Cliff. Other groups were having the same problem and some went over to Cedar and caught walleye over there. A few of our guys went to mystery and evening and caught quite a few walleye and small pike. My Dad was able to get a few lake trout and had a blast with that. I fished for musky most of the time and was able to catch my first musky! Boy what a blast! I will never forget my first musky catch, he slamed the bucktail and started ripping line off, he was 41 1/2"". I fished hard for musky and saw quite a few but only got the one in the boat. The people at Lost Bay Resort were very nice and do a great job. Were thinking of going to Cedar Lake next year. Any advice would be helpful. Most of our group wants walleye and I want muskies (I have the fever now). Is the lake good for both muskies and walleye? Any advice would be helpful. Thinking of going the last week in June. Thank You."

My dad and I have been fished Cedar the past nine years and have never been disappointed with the walleye fishing. The past couple of years the walleye fishing has been fantastic....lots of walleyes in the the low to mid twenty inch range and plenty of eater size fish too. The last four years we have fished the lake during the first week of June and the five previous years during late August. We have seen numerous muskies in the 50"" range swimming in the shallows early in June. We have been in camp when a couple of high 40's were caught as well. We have always stayed at Jerry & Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp and I would highly recommend them as the cabins are spotless and well maintained and they are fantastic hosts. The Tuesday noon fish fry is second to none. Actually, I have never heard anything negative about any of the other lodges on the lake, Cedar Point Resort, Cedar Lake Lodge or Keystone. Glenman is a regular contributor on here and I know for a fact he has been treated well at Cedar Lake Lodge. He has been fishing Cedar longer than I have and I'm sure he has more to add as well. Do a search for Cedar Lake on this site and also check Lake-Link.com and go to the forums header and down to the Canadian forums. There's a heading there for Cedar as well. Good luck! June 2011 can't get here fast enough!"

Ray and Kathi are good people, and the camp is centrally located so you can head in any direction without having to travel a long way. We jig for walleyes most of the time, and have had a few 50 to 70 fish days. We have also had days when they were hard to find. The biggest walleye was 29.5 inches. We have managed to catch 7 muskys without actually fishing for muskys. The biggest was a 49 inch pig, caught it on a #5 mepps fishing for smallmouth and pike. You can PM me if you need any specific information.............Hawghead"
