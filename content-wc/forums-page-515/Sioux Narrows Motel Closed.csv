1157811,way2goofy,2010-01-04 10:35:00,22,I called Crawford's Camp to make my reservations for this summer. Millie told me her phone has been riniging off the hook. The only motel in Sioux Narrows was forclosed on and shut down. Ice Fishermen are scrambling to find a place to stay that had reservations there. It's the motel on the main drag going through town on the east side of the highway. Some of the camps have winterized cabins for ice fisherman but not all. Crawford's has 4 winterized cabins but I bet they are all booked now!
1157873,Guest,2010-01-04 14:41:00,0,Was it the Cedar Creek Motel that closed ?
1157958,way2goofy,2010-01-04 19:50:00,22,Sorry but I'm not sure. It's the motel right in town near the trading post and sport shop on Hwy. 71. I guess it has changed hands several times over the years. The person that just lost it owned it for four years.
1157978,LOTWDave,2010-01-04 22:07:00,3,"If anyone had reservations at the motel and is in a bind, let me know maybe I can help. I'll call around and see who has room and will post tomorrow."
1158014,Lazy Fisherman,2010-01-05 07:20:00,276,Sorry to here that the motel closed. Have stayed there the last 2 years as I was passing through. Maybe someone will be taking it over and reopen it.
1158255,Guk,2010-01-06 09:35:00,39,Was it the rod and reel motel just across the bridge?
1158318,scotttheguide,2010-01-06 13:20:00,73,"Rod and Reel Resort has four motel rooms open during the season for travelers or extra guests. It was not the Rod and Reel Motel Rooms it was the Motel just south of the bridge in Sioux Narrows.The motel rooms are big, nice and clean for anyone traveling this season through Sioux Narrows that needs a room for the night. They do book up so so if you need a reservation you should call soon."
1159038,J.Iverson,2010-01-09 09:42:00,64,was it the hotel that used to be called the maple leaf?
1159062,Lazy Fisherman,2010-01-09 11:18:00,276,"The Maple Leaf did become the Cedar Creek. So, yes, that is the one they are referring to."
1234784,Sioux Narrows Motel,2010-09-10 21:16:00,1,"Just letting you know that my husband and I have purchased the old 'Cedar Creek' or 'Maple Leaf' motel, and are planning on officially opening in Spring of 2011 after some much needed renovations. If anyone needs a room this ice-fishing season, we will try our best to accommodate you. A website will be going up soon, so keep watch for updates. We will be known as simply the Sioux Narrows Motel from now on."
