I'm only going to do it sparingly just to try it, so I don't want to spend a lot of money on gear. I've heard that a large tube on a 1-2 oz jig head works well, but that's about all I know. Anyone have any tips? Thanks."
1234018,chosenone_intraining,2010-09-08 09:54:00,55,"Not sure where you'll be fishing, but we have had some good luck with pulling an assortment of 3/4 oz and 1oz Williams Wobblers attached to a 3-way with 8 oz of weight. Hope this helps. Good Luck! -Dave"
1234024,JayM5209,2010-09-08 10:22:00,1050,"troutwater, fishing for lakers is not all that complicated and doesn't take a bunch of special gear and tackle. A good place to start your thinking is by reading the excellent tips V-Bay Gord has on his web site. Go to http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/ and scroll down to the Fishing Tips links. There's one for lake trout fishing.The main factor will be the time of year you go, plus the specific lake. For years I've fished for lakers at the end of May and in mid- to late August. Two totally different events. In the early season, many people troll with a variety of spoons, often flutter spoons like a small Sutton. My best days have been long line trolling Rapalas . . . CDs, Husky Jerks, and larger Shad Raps. A variety of colors (blue/silver, gold/orange) work, but the consistently most effective are black/silver. In May to mid-June, before the water warms, we catch lakers this way in water 7' to 30' deep. After the Raps, my go to laker lure is a blue/silver Canadian Wiggler.After the water warms the trout will be deep. Basic electronics will help you find them. A common way to do that is to troll a three way rig with a spoon and 4-6 oz. of weight. When you mark fish, if the wind isn't blowing too hard, you can drift and jig for them. A silver Crocodile spoon or a heavy blue/silver Little Cleo works good. I have used 1 1/2 or 2 oz. jigs with a white tube or 5"" white curly tail, but they haven't been as effective for me as the jigging spoons. Some folks have had good luck with a heavy Whistler jig (the one with the little propeller on it) and a white curly tail. This year, during an end of May trip and a late August trip, on different NW Ontario lakes, I discovered the effectiveness of blade baits for jigging up lakers. In May the water was starting to warm and they were in the shallow to deep transition. We jigged them as they were holding at 25'-30' over deeper water. In August they were on bottom in 70'-75' of water. 1 1/2 or 2 oz. blade baits were unbelievably effective in catching both lakers and whitefish. I had done an online search and found several sources for the larger blade baits, but I'm sure you could use the smaller Cicadas or Heddon Sonars commonly available in tackle stores.Try it. I think fishing for lake trout is a real hoot. It can be a lot of boat time between fish, but on those days when you find them and figure out the right trolling or jigging combo to use it can be a blast. Good luck!"
1234035,wallydave,2010-09-08 10:33:00,2151,"I had one trips worth of Laker fishing. Three way swivels, an ounce of lead and a big blue/silver rapela worked. I also had good luck with a big hammered silver spoon. A stout rod and reel and plenty o line to get deep. Cloudy days seemed to be the best weather on a clear water lake. After the catch, my favorite way to cook Lake trout was to ""blacken"" it. Cajun spices or black pepper and a hot dry griddle or frying pan!"
1234059,troutwater,2010-09-08 11:49:00,299,"Thanks for the replies. I would be up on the Manitou most likely fishing for mainly muskie around the 4th of July. I've never fished for lake trout before, but thought that would be a good time to try it out for a bit. I hear they are fun to catch though. Have you guys ever heard of lures called Buzzits, or something like that? Up on Crow some guys were using them for lake trout, but I've never seen one or even know who makes them."
1234252,Outfitter17,2010-09-08 21:29:00,127,"Troutwater,Are you sure you not talking about Buzz Bombs? If you are fishing the manitou in early july, you will most likely be fishing trout just at the end of there transition from shallow to deep water. You will find them in 65-75 feet down in 80-100fow. At that time of the year I like to use 3/4 saltwater jigs with either a white tube to a white northland minnow sluppie in the 4-5"" range. If you have a decent graph you will be able to hold your boat above the trout and see your line on the screen. It's a blast to get a hit while watching the trout come up to your jig on screen.Good luck on your trip."
1234593,troutwater,2010-09-10 06:52:00,299,"Thanks for the tips. Like I said we've never fished for lakers before, but we'd like to give it a shot, mainly just to say we did it. We haven't decided where exactly to stay on the Manitou, but we've heard the straights are the best area for muskie."
1234604,Outfitter17,2010-09-10 07:17:00,127,"There is some excellent muskie water on the manitou. Manitou is ultra clear and not a lake with lots of smaller fish/numbers, but there are big girls out there and that's what most musky guys are after - the big fish. If you are looking at the July timeframe, you better spots to fish musky are Glass Bay, Esox Lake, and the straights. The only thing you need to watch out for is the wind, when the wind picks up crossing the big lake will almost be impossible on some days. Good Luck"
