1235491,GNO,2010-09-13 20:46:00,153,"It refers to fish being given away counting on your possession limit, so if you give 4 fish away they would still count on your possession limit."
1235541,adempsey,2010-09-14 07:09:00,963,"Here are the regulations for Ontario for 2010. Perhaps the issue is that you're referring to older regulations. They change regularly and have changed much the past two years. I live in Ontario and have to consult them on a regular basis. Although they provide general regulations for the province and for each fishery management zone, there are many lakes within each zone that have exceptions.My last paragraph was not directed at you, but to the others suggesting you won't get caught if you go fishing when you are already at your possession limit, making it acceptable to do so.I apologize if I offended you. That was not my intention."
1235549,dogrodder,2010-09-14 07:28:00,400,That is an excellent point. I eat what I catch no later than the day after I catch it. To each their own but I don't ever bring any fish home.
1235600,Guest,2010-09-14 11:28:00,0,"I know that retire55 is right. If I catch 4 walleye, I can give them to the little old lady in my town who loves fish but cannot go fishing. I do it all the time. The law states what you can possess; it cannot dictate who you give them to. The only thing is you cannot catch and keep more than 4 in one day and that four, of course, includes fish you have frozen or have eaten for shore lunch"
1235614,Outfitter17,2010-09-14 12:23:00,127,"GNO is right, I just had a conservation officer stop by the camp this morning and I showed him this post. He said that you can give your fish away, but until that person eats them they still fall under your possession limit."
1235623,bob oh,2010-09-14 13:29:00,3936,How much more absurd can this law get LoL
1235627,octanehi5,2010-09-14 13:46:00,1104,"Fishanytime was asking about the amount of walleyes you can keep home in the US if you caught them in canada. If you think that you have to many walleye filets in your freezer. Do not give them to your wife girlfriend or kids ,send them to me in a cooler full of dry ice and let me worrie about the limit. And you can go back fishing You will like this one I heard that all the new fry walleye this coming spring are going to be branded. so we can tell an american walleye from a canada walleye in the freezer. Once I cook them in beer batter,hot oil,and dip in fresh made tartar sauce I can't tell the differance Fishanytime I'm glad you get it CIAO"
1235813,Guest,2010-09-15 13:54:00,0,That warden needs to go back to school and learn the law. He'd be laughed out of court on that charge
1235048,fishanytime,2010-09-12 07:45:00,63,"Thank you for the reply's, the above answer was the reason for my question, I fish Canada 4 to 5 times a year, I don't think I have brought back my limit yet this year but we do shore lunch every day and thus would rather wait until winter to eat some fish at home. I don't ice fish and Canadian fishing has spoiled fishing for me in southern Wisconsin so I rarely fish at home. I do label the fish as required in Canada. Thank you for the reply's."
1235071,retire55,2010-09-12 09:44:00,1029,"Although I am completely unaware of the rules regarding walleye possession limits within your state, I am aware of the walleye possession limit requirements in Ontario and Quebec. In these two Canadian provinces, every person is entitled to a possession limit of walleye regardless whether that person has a fishing licence or not. Persons without a fishing licence can legally acquire a possession limit of walleye because another person, with a fishing licence, gave them a possession limit of walleye. Consequently, if you're the least bit concerned about the legality of taking home another walleye possession limit from Quebec when you already have a walleye possession limit from Quebec in your freezer, simply give those walleye in the freezer to your spouse or to an off spring before your next trip north. There's really no problem staying legal if you apply the rules. FWIW."
1235086,Outfitter17,2010-09-12 10:49:00,127,"Retire55,I am pretty sure you are wrong about ""every person is entitled to a possession limit of walleye regardless whether that person has a fishing lic. or not."" I have fished in ontario for 24 years and I own 2 fishing resorts and deal with the MNR quite a bit and I have never heard or read anything like that in regs.There is no way a family of 6 can posses 6 possession limits of walleyes (only the dad fishes, no one else does) and only the husband has a lic. and just say each member of the family has a limit?The only time I have ever heard of this is when a native indian gives some fish away or deer/moose meat away, they need to put there name, satus info, tribe info on a letter to go with the stuff being given away just in case the person who the food was given to gets stopped.If you have supporting info for your statement above I would love to see it."
1235123,adempsey,2010-09-12 14:33:00,963,"Sorry, but this is incorrect.In Ontario, you need a license if you're between 18 and 64. Individuals <18 or 65+ follow the rules of a sportsman license. Giving fish away still counts toward your possession limit. I am not aware of the Quebec regulations.I'd say just eat the fish before you leave. Fish that have been frozen for a while don't taste that great anyway, IMO.It's also nice that people don't mind possessing fish over the limit. Just because it's hard to enforce, and you're unlikely to get caught, doesn't mean you should be doing it. I'd rather you just stay home and fish your local waters if that is the case. There is enough of that going on locally as it is."
1235163,GNO,2010-09-12 17:14:00,153,adempsey - well put and totally agree.

1235228,Outfitter17,2010-09-12 21:45:00,127,"jow,Did you read my post? A family of 6 can not have 6 possession limits in the freezer (36 fish where the limit is 6 or 24 fish where the limits are 4) with only the husband having a lic. and giving a limit to each family member, they need to have a lic. to posses a limit of fish."

1235379,retire55,2010-09-13 12:54:00,1029,"Hi Outfitter17: I too have experienced difficulty finding the answers to questions I've had about fishing in Ontario within the Ontario Fishing Regulations. As a consequence, I've resorted to sending emails to Ontario MNR representatives to seek clarification or interpretations of the rules. I'm including the following definition extracted from Ontario's fishing Regulations in this post just because it makes mention of ""fish given away"". Catch and Possession Limits Â– The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are retained for any period of time and any fish eaten or given away. The possession limit is the number you are allowed to have in your possession on hand, in cold storage, in transit, or anywhere. Possession limits are the same as one day's catch limit except where otherwise specified. Here are two questions I emailed to the Ontario MNR back in 2003 followed by the email response I received from them. Does an Ontario resident without a valid fishing licence have the right to a possession limit of fish? ""Any person is entitled to a valid possession of a limit of fish. The holder of a full sport fishing licence or any other person may possess the legal limit of fish."" If I give my possession limit of walleye to my wife for her possession limit, can I then legally return to fish walleye the next day and bring home another possession limit of walleye? ""If you give your fish to another person who may legally possess them, you are entitled to catch and retain or possess your possession limit."" I sent the same questions to the Quebec Sport Fishing authorities and their response follows: ""In answer to your request, the regulation is similar than in Ontario, so that you have to stop fishing if you have reached your daily quota, but you can give the fish to your wife, so that the next day you're entitled to fish another daily quota."""
1235389,retire55,2010-09-13 13:28:00,1029,"Obviously you think my post is incorrect. I would question ""based on what"". If you have an valid MNR interpretation of the possession limits that differs from mine, I'd appreciate reading it or at least having you provide reference to it. I have no idea what your last paragraph has to do with my post. To suggest that I possess fish over limit is baseless and unacceptable!"
1234614,fishanytime,2010-09-10 07:48:00,63,"What are the rules for possession of Canadian fish in the U.S. If you make more than one trip, do you have to have consumed your fish from the previous trip, assuming you brought your legal limits with you on the last trip?"
1234621,Outfitter17,2010-09-10 08:34:00,127,"Your possession limit is exactly that what it means, you can only legally posses what your limit allows. And legally if you have 4 fish in the freezer at home, you can't keep any on your next trip for shorelunch or dinner, even if you don't plan on taking any home, because you are already at your legal limit even though they are at your home."
1234633,REG,2010-09-10 09:36:00,445,"I have very seldom had the Ontario DNR check my freezer in Illinois. (OK, never would be more like it) We once had a young Canadian pilot our houseboat out on Lac Seul. One of his favorite sayings has become one of our's as well. ""You gotta use a little common, eh?"" (common sense) Now with all kidding aside - in your possession is in your possession, just like Outfitter17 said. If you're back home, have fish in the freezer, and planning another trip - start heating up the grease and get rid of those fillets..."
1234783,hogridnfool,2010-09-10 21:14:00,349,"Unless the Ministry of Natural Resources has secretly implanted GPS tracking chips in all of their fish they aren't going to have a clue as to how many Canadian Walleyes you have in your freezer back in Wisconsin, just be sure you aren't over limit while in their country. Which Province and which Division do you fish in (daily catch and possession limits vary across the country)? Here is a little excerpt from the Wisconsin DNR fishing regulations, it doesn't address your question directly, but.... Traveling If you travel through Wisconsin with fish from another state, those fish are not considered part of your Wisconsin possession limit, even if you stop to fish in Wisconsin. However, you must be able to show the fish were from out of state with: a valid fishing license from another state, and labeled packages of fish with number of fish, angler's name, date and where caught. BTW, Wisconsin's possession limit is 10 Walleyes."

1234974,Bill Krejca,2010-09-11 18:35:00,6107,"Just a heads-up - just because one makes it across the border doesn't mean that the Minn (or another state's officials) can't check you for fish. Most states have a reciprocal agreement with Canada for fish checks. As far as I know, home freezers are not ""fair game."" Bill Krejca"
1234981,octanehi5,2010-09-11 19:25:00,1104,You can pack them in a portable cooler pack it with dry ice and ship them to me here in Ct. No more problem

1235037,octanehi5,2010-09-12 06:39:00,1104,"Fishanytime I have fished in northern quebec many times in a season,the outfitter on the lac we fish has his own slot limit on walleyes and pike that you can keep you can eat or take home 14""-20"" walleye anything under or over that goes back in the lac. Most of Quebec has an 8 walleye possession limit,If I have 8 in my freezer at home,I am not going to tell anyone.Just cross over the border with the right limit and you will be fine. There are not any walleye police that are going to check your freezer. Another point the state law in my state says a walleye has to be 20"" before you can keep it, now what about my fish from Quebec that are 14-19"" are they illegal. The law is there so any one person or group does not take a bag of 100s of walleye.I have been fishing up nord for 25 yrs I aways bring home my limit no matter if is ten times a yr. The way I look at it we pay good money to catch fish,I observe the limits.but if I have 8 or 16 in my freezer thats my perogative. others are going to disagree with this but I eat those fish when I want to. If I choose to eat them before I go back,I am still coming back with my legal limit"
