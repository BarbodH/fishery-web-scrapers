I use bottom bouncers and jigs tipped with minnows. Never been in Miles Bay before. I have a paper map and a basic depthfinder. Any input would be appreciated. Great sight you have here.Thanks,Fuzznutts"

But you might bottom bounce into several cases of beer on the bottom that we left there a few years ago close to the southern entrance to Miles Bay just up from Obabikon Bay (for those of you that remember our ""adventure"" in 08). There is a hump on the north side of Smokehouse Island (north side of Miles Bay) that is productive in the summer. The map from the Canadian government is superior to the other maps out there and shows a lot of humps and better depth details. Also try the south face of Smokehouse Island and around Garden and Horseshoe Islands. Another option is to contact Jared at Obabikon Bay and hire one his guides for a day. He's the closest camp and would know the spots for this time of year. I'm curious to what others have to say - always willing to try new spots that I never thought of before. Alanb"

1228556,Fuzznutts,2010-08-17 19:24:00,4,Friends cabin in Nestor Falls. Looks like an hour ride to get out to Miles Bay from there. The reefs way out west of Miles Bay in the big open water look very interesting. If I catch a low wind morning or evening it might be a great place to catch a nice'un.
1228605,1shooter,2010-08-17 21:31:00,1493,Good luck...I will be in the area over labor day weekend.
