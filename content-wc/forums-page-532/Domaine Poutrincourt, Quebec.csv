If your primary target is walleye, this would be my recommendation. We've caught pike here, but not in significant numbers, although we never specifically targeted them. The first time we went in June 2006 and for a group of 4 who never fished the area before, we caught 496 walleye and 48 pike for the week. This year, we stayed at the main lodge area of the lake in July and we caught 348 walleye and 36 pike. The first time we stayed in Cabin # 11 and last year we stayed near the main lodge in cabin #13. You must have a fish finder to determine bottom structure. Once you locate holes / drop-offs, etc, you'll catch fish. Any of the numerous rock piles that are marked and border deep water will produce. Andre is a very personable guy and will help you in any way he can. Both years, I've taken my own boat. The road into the main lodge is in decent shape, although this year Andre said that the logging operations have ceased in the area and the road is getting worse. He said he has plans to purchase a road grader to maintain it. I noticed a difference from one year to the next. Still, not a bad road to travel on as compared to say the Clova Road. We are considering going back again in 2008, although some of the guys don't care for the long drive to get there. We live near Pittsburgh, and it is 20hrs of solid driving to get to the lodge. We stay in LaDore going up, but drive straight thru coming home. So, if you like walleye fishing, catching good numbers although not huge sizes, 15 - 18 avg with 25 being big, and don't mind the long drive, then I would go here. This is the best walleye lake I've ever fished in Quebec. Trolling will pick up pike and the larger walleye, but you have to have the patience to drift and jig with night crawlers to get numbers. If you need anything else, let me know. Larry"

There are now indoor showers no more bathing in the lake. We are planning to go back next year again. Been there in June, July and August and found only the beginning of June to be a bit harder to fish. Make sure you work your way up yhe river. The chutes can be a bit hard to get through in low water but the fishing up in Lac Buade is good, lots of big eyes up there. I have always stayed in cabins 1 and 2 but hear the rest as just as comfortable. Andre is a good guy and his crew are friendly. His son is a bit on the quiet side but he knows the lake and can be very helpfull. The road is a little rough but we made it last year with a Ford van and didn't have any real problems.Go for it."
