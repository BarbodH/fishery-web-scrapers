We trolled rapala's in 8-15ft water, 65-68 temp.Pick a pt and work the wind all through McKenzie and you will not be disappointed!! lindy's, jigs and minnows."
1209841,Guest,2010-06-13 20:30:00,0,"A group of 4 of us returned from our annual Lac Seul fishing trip in the Ear Falls area. We spent most of our time in and around Sawmill Bay and found the fishing to be tough. I estimate our group caught less than half of what we caught the previous year. Our entire camp was reporting that the catch rate was way down this year. There was no real pattern and the fish seemed to be scattered. The water temps were in the low 60's. We tried crawlers, leeches, minnows, frozen shiners, crankbaits, soft plastics among others. Frozen shiners were the most effective under a green fuzz-e-grub. That combination was suggested by an old timer at the camp and it worked better than most. The group staying next to us caught most of their fish on leeches. The water in Sawmill Bay was extremely muddy due to heavy rains a week or two ago. Our weather was fairly stable and everyday except Sunday was about 60 and cloudy. Rain did pass through the area, but seemed to miss us for the most part. We typically fish Sawmill Bay and focus on the wind blown points and islands. This did not produce for us and the quiet shorelines were more effective on some days. We also went to McKenzie Bay on one day and watched the aforementioned old timer catch walleye after walleye on the sand banks with his green fuzz-e-grub. An impressive display. I'm not sure when or if the fish move out of Sawmill as summer progresses, but I wouldn't spend much time their at this point. We did see four moose, a wolf, and a bald eagle pluck a 12 inch northern in a foot of water for an afternoon snack. There was a 1 hour 40 minute wait to get into Canada through International Falls on Saturday morning at about 8:30. Returning into the US yesterday about 11:00 there was a 15 minute wait. Good luck to all."
1209862,bpetersen,2010-06-13 21:47:00,251,Very good report. I was in the Ear Falls area also during the same time frame. We fished the sanctuary and Lunker Point area two days with mixed results. Two of our boats did o.k. but two others did poor. The sanctuary did best for us with a lindy rig and crawlers. We were told leeches but crawler worked best for us in about 8-10 feet of water. Lunker Point was best with an orange jig and minnow at 18 to 22 feet of water. The next four days we went below the dam and had very good luck on walleye and northerns on lindy rigs with crawlers and leeches. We just couldn't bring ourselves to travel to McKenzie because of distance and hazards.
1209919,eyefanatic,2010-06-14 07:25:00,25,Thank you for taking the time to post your findings. Good or bad is better than nothing at all.
1209927,Mike Kansas,2010-06-14 07:56:00,1463,"We were on Lac Seul the 5th thru the 12th at Black Bay Outpost camp out of Lac Seul Lodge. We had an awesome week. We caught a lot of walleyes and many of our fish were slot and above. This is our 20th plus year at Black Bay and has to be one of our top 5 years. The majority of our fish came on wind blown structure. The wind did change almost every day, in fact we had three days in a row that it changed 180 degrees from west to east. The wind change required us to fish different structure but the Walleye on Lac Seul do follow the wind patterens and it really worked for us this year. Big eye was 28 1/2"" Mike Kansas"
1209986,fish hack,2010-06-14 10:51:00,1,heading out in two weeks and the more i read the more excited i get. any body fish broad lake or ghost narrows?
1209992,LoDo,2010-06-14 11:10:00,721,"I have fished those areas several times in the past. I usually stay in Rat Bay or Black Bay depending on the resort. Lac Seul lodge is in Black Bay and Fisherman's Cove is in Rat Bay. Both great resorts!!We usually make the long boat ride to McKenzie Bay. Our best luck always seems to be there. If you are going to make it to the Ghost Narrows and Broad Lake, be sure to take a day and fish the SW end of the small island at the far end of MeKenzie Bay. Look at the map and you'll see the small island I'm referring too. We had a group that fished that island in early June last year and produced record numbers! Lindy rig / jig and a minnow.Good luck!!"
1209993,LoDo,2010-06-14 11:11:00,721,The warmer the water the better the bite is my theory in early June. Anything about 65-66 degrees should be solid.
1210019,stumcfar,2010-06-14 12:38:00,451,"I have vowed never to waste another minute of our fishing trips in Sawmill. I know there will be a ton of people who will say the fishing in there is dynamite, but we have tried it about every year for the 9 years we have been up there, and have never had good success. Now there are some areas close to opening of Sawmill that have been fantastic and we spend hoursi f not days on these spots each year. We are heading to the Outpost cabin in McKenzie Bay on July 10th. THis is a new area for us and anyone who is willing to share info on that area for that time of year, I would sure appreciate it."
1210151,bpetersen,2010-06-14 19:43:00,251,"Temperature at Goose Island, lunker point and the area was already 65 to 66 degrees surface temp. June 5 - 12th."
1210593,eyefanatic,2010-06-16 08:00:00,25,"Lac Seul Does anyone know if the lake shinners have spawned yet? Also, I am assuming that it has to be getting close to the time when the large mayflys start hatching in the shallow bays. Any update on this would be much appreciated! Thanks."
