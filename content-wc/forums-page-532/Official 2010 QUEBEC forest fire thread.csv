1207216,McQ,2010-06-05 08:37:00,615,"All fires are now under control east of Parent according to Sopfeu, steady rain today which is providing a good ground soaking. Long range forecast shows intermittent days of rain for the upcoming week and low temps. Fishing is great with big Pike & walleye coming in daily. Trolling Hot n Tots has been the main method but the jig bite is strong - leeches for bait. I'll be on the water guiding starting Sunday so more info coming daily (about time)"
1207218,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-05 08:41:00,151,McQ:Thanks for taking the time w/ your update. It sure means an awful lot hearing it from someone who's in the area. Thanks again and I'm looking forward to your next post. Best.
1208040,Freytown,2010-06-08 07:04:00,770,"I am hoping ""no news is good news"" regarding the fires in the Gouin region. I will be heading to Baie du Sud friday 6/11 & hope the fish are hungry, lol. After 30 yrs of Canada trips, the excitment never wanes."
1210806,fosterthedog,2010-06-16 18:15:00,51,"Just returned from Clova (6/12) road is open and in good shape. In Parent you can turn toward Clova but not to LaTuorqe. Parent is also a stging area for firefighters so watch out as you turn left toward Clova, barricades are set up for watertrucks and the helicopters LZ. Also watch around blind corners and hills for road graters due to dry dusty road conditions they can suprise you. Have a great safe drive up"

Many have upcoming trips. When updating the thread, please site your source as this thread is meant to be a factual, not a speculative thread. Thanks Freytown!"
1205828,Freytown,2010-06-01 08:27:00,770,Your welcome.Great post (idea).Newspaper link: http://www.montrealgazette.com/healt...957/story.htmlhttp://www.montrealgazette.com/healt...826/story.html
1205830,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-01 08:34:00,151,"Actually, the idea came form you...and my stupidity. It will be nice though just to go to one source and find whatever information you need along w/ the links. It should help everyone heading up there. I figure I'll let someone start up the other provinces if there is a need. These Quebec fires seem to be never ending..."
1205838,a3dad,2010-06-01 09:00:00,115,"GREAT IDEA GUYS. Thanks. A lot of good information can be found on the SOPFEU site. Unfortunately some of the reports are in french. Check out the ""report of fire situation"" link. There is a nice map showing the locations of the fires.http://www.sopfeu.qc.ca/index_en.php I'm traveling up to Clova via the Parent road Saturday night. Anyone know where to get up to date information on road closures?"

1206202,Freytown,2010-06-02 07:05:00,770,"I didn't see any reports in the papers this morning but there was rain in a lot of the fire regions. The weather forecast calls for more rain & much cooler temperatures, so this should help get these fire under control.Anybody have any other info?"
1206211,McQ,2010-06-02 07:29:00,615,"The fires are burning from the east of Parent to the la Toque area. The road from Parent to La Toque has been closed for the last 5 days. While extensive in scope the fires are all along the northern edge of the railroad in the Gouin region and irregularly shaprd for 30 Km to the north, Camps west of Parent are operating, those who have reservations should remain in contact as the situation could change overnight. It's raining this morning which will grant some relief - sunny and cool thru friday and the long range forecast calls for more rain saturday thru monday. Here at Nenio we had heavy smoke late laat week but the winds have kept the air clear since. Sopfeau is in daily contact with us and helicopter patrols are in place to monitor the situation. We are extremely busy here but I will try to keep in touch as time allows. McQ"
