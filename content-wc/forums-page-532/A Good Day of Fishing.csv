We've seen eagles soaring; bull moose swimming and a cow moose teaching her twin calves how to survive; woodland caribou and deer playing; pelicans, ducks and loons paddling; cormorants nesting; etc., etc., etc. We eat fresh walleye every night and for at least one shore lunch every trip. In regard to numbers of fish caught, we have good days and not so good days but still average over 50 fish per day. All that and us being together enjoying the total wilderness experience makes every day on LS a great day. We wouldn't trade those experiences for anything and can't wait to get back to LS the first week in July and again in August."
1210332,MidWestFishman,2010-06-15 13:10:00,44,"I was wondering what others consider to be a ""good"" day of fishing in regards to numbers or size of fish. To me just being on the lake with my fishing partner and enjoying nature makes it a good day. In terms of size and numbers, I have caught over 50 fish in a day and thought that was great and have caught only 6 fish in a day but one was a 35 lb lake trout so that was a great day also. My so called worse day was catching only 4 fish but was with family so I still had a blast. Just curious what others consider as good fishing. Thanks for your comments."
1210355,Aaron-IN,2010-06-15 14:41:00,500,Any day I'm fishing and not working is a good day.
1210363,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-15 14:59:00,109,"I've only been on one trip north of the border - last summer - so I have limited data. All I know is the worst fishing day of my trip to Savant Lake last summer was as good as the BEST day I've ever had fishing Leech, Winnie, Cass, Pike Bay, or any of the other great walleye lakes in northern MN where I live. The fewest walleye I caught in a day was about 40; the most was about 85-90 (I lost track after awhile!). Add in the pike and lakers, and it was more than that. Like somebody mentioned above, though, any day fishing is better than a day at work!"
1210482,prov1900,2010-06-15 20:50:00,544,"Numbers are one thing, but don't forget to take in the ""sights"" and the ""smells"" and the comraderie of friends and family. We try to keep track, but it doesn't really matter. The atmosphere is priceless and the ""accounting"" chores become irrelevant. As far as your question, a great day is 20+ apiece. Someone always struggles, make sure they keep up if it includes dropping your guard (and rod) for awhile."
1210545,rebs,2010-06-16 05:59:00,7587,"I can't say I ever had a bad day fishing other than the time I ruined my prop. But thats another story, lol.It is always a good day fishing when I am on the water with friends or family, doesn't really matter how many or how big, just being out is great. Sometimes the wife and I take the boat out just to go for a boat ride and stop at Swiston's for a fabulous roast beef on weck and a bowl of great chilliI really do enjoy catching fish but it is not a must to have a great day on the water. More important is to look up and give thanks for the day and the water to have my boat on."
1210571,Pooch,2010-06-16 07:24:00,4619,"I don't remember having a ""bad"" day of fishing. Even days when we got spanked we still had fun and learned a little about what wasn't working! Anytime we are together ""shootin' the breeze"" we are happy, but catching fish at the same time makes us happier.You hear guys talking about one hundred fish days all the time. That seems to be a magic number for a lot of folks and really is a benchmark day, but most days fishing if you can total twenty to thirty fish per man is a ""successful"" day. Odds are that most of those fish came in little spurts of activity so in reality most of the day you sat there meditating on your rod tip.Like Rebs just said about a ruined prop. Sooner or later some type break down will happen to about everybody. That day too could be considered a ""success"" if you limped back to camp or the ramp without needing a tow or spending the night on an island full of skeeters.Pooch"
1210574,Bob_Loblaw,2010-06-16 07:30:00,109,"I'll second what was said above. The nicest part of my trip last year was when we finally had the wind die down to where we could cut the motor and cast to the fish we were on. Once the motor was off, the only thing you could hear was...nothing. It was the most beautiful sound."
1210760,Guest,2010-06-16 14:42:00,0,5-10 fish a day if you fish DogFish. Why anyone would ever drive by world premier lakes to go to that sterile lake I will never know.
1210973,Guest,2010-06-17 09:31:00,0,"Hi Guys - regarding ""numbers"" -- I fish with 2 ""childhood"" buddies - we go to Lac Seul for 1 week every year -- we have been doing this since 1985. ! We usually do quite well, in fact a few years ago, after having a great day catching, we looked at each other and asked - ""I wonder how many fish we boated today?"" Well - I solved that little problem the next year. I mounted 3 ""lap-counters"" on the side of my boat - 1 is marked ""under the slot"", 1 ""in the slot"" and 1 ""over the slot"". Every time a fish is caught, the respective counter is tapped to record it. Usually we fish from about 9-3, and we typically will total around 100 fish total. At least NOW we know what kind of a day we really had."
