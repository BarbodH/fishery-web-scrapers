1134923,mojo1,2009-09-09 19:47:00,4,"As a born and bred Southern Ontarioian and 40 odd years of experiance in the consumpution of ales and lagers, I had to give some serious thought to the original question in this post. The difficulty in providing a straight forward answer to this issue is that there isnt one (answer). Back in the 60's and 70's there wasn't the great amount of choices as we have now. In that era the mainstays were Molson Golden, Labbatts 50 and O'Keefe, either ale or lager. There were other ones around, but these were the big hitters. Remember the old Molson Golden commercials, they were some of the coolest TV commercials ever done. Personally back then I was a Labbatts 50 drinker. As we get into the 70's Labbatts decided to start spending most of their marketing budget on Blue, so 50 started to fall out of favour with the general public and Blue took over as their main beer. I'm sure there are lots of websites to check out history on Canadian beer companies, Labbatts, Molson and Carling where the big 3 for suds. Personally I think selling beer is all about marketing and perception. I've long ago out grown my taste for 50. I have tried many differ beers over the years, and as most people we go through spells of liking one over another for a period of time, until one day you try something different that catches you fancy and start all over again. My personal opinion, Blue and Canadian = pony pissExport and 50 = gut rotCoors light = marginally ok My present time favorites (varies on my mood, sort of like ""flavour of the week"")Alexander KiethsCarlsbergKokaneeMoosehead - ocassionallyAs someone else pointed out earlier, dont get hung up on the mainstream beers, there are so many great beers to choose from. We are fortunate in Ontario to have such a great selection. Try some of the micro breweries in the province (internet search), the great thing about the micro brews is they don't use any chemical preservitives, its all natural so don't leave them sitting around too long. If you are in Southern Ontario, find a LCBO that has a Vintages designation, they will have many of the micro brewery beers that are local and they will also carry many different beers from all over the world, plus, you can pick and choose what ever you wish to try. Whatever you buy, enjoy your visit, and play safe.CheersGL"

All they had in the store that day was the big bottles and I didn't think my buddy would look good carrying around those in camp in front of his in-laws. LOL But my second choice was pretty good....BLUE. And once again, I stopped on the way home and bought a case of BLUE. The border agent just smiled when I said I was bringing home a good case of brew. Of course, I was smiling too."

1104860,v-bay gord,2009-05-13 21:23:00,3168,"Nothing wrong with O.V., but then again I often drink ""50"" which is a brand that has similarly gone out of fashion. By the way, O.V. is a lager, 50 is an ale. Both taste great, especially when drunk at the Bayview Hotel here in Vermilion Bay.......a classic 1950's style Canadian bar. Even has the shuffleboard table from way back when."
1129353,Walleyeguy2u,2009-08-17 12:22:00,5,"That's why you should buy it in cans. The cans will float, bottles will sink. I used to camp at the bottom of a portage and had several 6 packs show up as short term guests."

1103002,joeman79,2009-05-06 18:02:00,417,I am sure we bought AK IPA in cans last year. It was in a green and red can with a stag on it I think. Yeah I checked they make it in cans 44.50 a case

1103317,adempsey,2009-05-08 00:19:00,963,"Although I live in Canada I don't really drink too much Canadian beer any more. Most of beer from the big companies isn't all that great IMO but some of the micro-breweries make some good beers. Part of it is also how it sold and the cost. I can buy better imported beer for a similar price at more convenient locations. In Ontario, beer is sold in only two retail stores. ""The Beer Store"" (yes that is the name, it used to be called Brewer's Retail, and is owned by the big three breweries) or the LCBO (which is government run).I am not quite sure how it works in Manitoba. Each province is different. For example, in Quebec, you can get beer at grocery stores.You can get Alexander Keiths IPA in 355mL or 473mL cans. This isn't too bad a beer actually. COLD Moosehead and Steam Whistle are similar IMO. http://www.liquormartsonline.com/e/i...1=1&op5.rt1=25http://www.thebeerstore.ca/Beers/pricelist.asp?str=&id=0512&brandname=KEITHShttp://www.thebeerstore.ca/Beers/bra...ch_results.aspBesides micro-brews and imported beers, I do like John Labatt's Classic, Rickard's White (a wheat beer - yes you often put an orange slice in it, but it's good), Steam Whistle and Creemore Springs. Regardless, if someone offers me an ice cold beer of any kind I will gladly accept it!!"
1103327,jigman 2003,2009-05-08 06:16:00,981,"Did some reading on AK IPA. Sounds like it is not the IPA I'm used to. Not super ""hoppy"" or bitter. More ""lager"" like. I'm used to some pretty wicked hoppy stuff (New Glarus IPA, Tyranena Bitter Woman, Big Sky IPA, etc.). Guess I'll just stick with the old classics - Blue, Canadian, Moosehead"

1090577,bassface44,2009-03-24 11:14:00,96,I have always enjoyed Upper Canada beers. Wildcat makes an appearance now and again too. The staple is usually blue and blue light though. This year we are going to get all sorts of different brands though.
1090767,bardern,2009-03-25 07:26:00,28,"hmm having read this thread and it seems you guys need some direction from a native.First off we are second only to the Aussies when it comes to beer. secondly if you all are going to pay the big price (hey we've got the big taxes to pay for our medi-care) you might as well get the good stuff. If you are lookin to drown your sorrows after getting skunked go with the Blue, 50 that type of stuff. The Micro Brewery stuff is what you want but is hard to find everywhere.some suggestionsI see that Upper Canada has been mentioned.OUTSTANDING. Drink lots!

But, I do worry a lot that Anhueser-Busch will spoil one of America's premier beers now that they own the brand and have closed the Latrobe, PA brewery. Also, I do believe RR Green is still available in cans.Steve of Madison, Dutchie's!!! Everyone should have that experience at least once. You've never had a real Canadian fishing experience until you've done the beer and cigarette run to Dutchie's on a rainy, cold morning!"

1089635,prov1900,2009-03-20 19:33:00,544,"...and it doesn't mean you can't sip some of Canada's finest brews, right? Molson for me."
1089648,Dipstick,2009-03-20 20:03:00,101,"The Keith you mentioned is Alexander Keith Pale India Ale. Mighty good. Interesting comments by others. Blue and Molson are popular but certainly not the best. They have the biggest advertising budgets - like Bud. There are many smaller breweries and micro-breweries in Canada that produce superior beer. Moosehead actually has a good reputation and following in Canada. Kokanee was big for a while. Sleeman's is great beer and is readily available for those going up to LOTW. Don't be afraid to try to smaller names, and different styles, such as the reds and honey browns. Ask the clerks in the stores and other shoppers for suggestions. Try them all and enjoy."
1089663,Bigfishhunter,2009-03-20 21:17:00,803,"Sleeman is without a doubt the best canadian beer, in my humble Canadian opinion is Fort Garry Dark. However, this is tough to get outside Manitoba. Then it would have to be Sleeman's, although they were bought out by a Japanes Co. a couple of years ago, so makes them less Canadian. Although the beer hasn't changed. The main stay in my fridge (because my wife likes it soo much) is Kokanee. P.s. the only thing that Labatt's is good for is beer battered fish"
1089668,Hawkfan,2009-03-20 21:45:00,237,Our group always buys Kokanee for the night before we fly out. The first round always seems to have a race to find the little guy or sasquatch on the label.
1089681,alanb,2009-03-21 00:21:00,56,"Alexander Keiths IPA is definitely our choice. Sometimes we get Canadian's as ""backup"" after the Keith's are gone.
