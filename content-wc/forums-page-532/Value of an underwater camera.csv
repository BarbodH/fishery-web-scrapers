Brisk wind that causes increased wave action and reduces light3. Changes direction of wind that stirs up water on points, weedlines and bays that may have been undisturbed for a day or two. New feeding opportunities are available for all the feeders in the area. I'm sure that several of you have fished a weed bed with no results, but have turned fish on by blasting through the bed wide open with your small boat. A weather change turns me on and gets me out on the water for some action and it seems to have the same effect on fish. Wind and rain excite me."
1210220,81Saluki,2010-06-15 06:13:00,97,"I thought y'all might find this interesting … I bought an underwater camera several years ago and have learned a lot over the years by observing detailed bottom structure where we fish. But this past week I learned something new that debunked a ""myth"".THE ""MYTH"" IN THIS CASE IS: Fish don't bite when the barometer goes haywire.OUR SCENARIO: We had done well Saturday through Thursday morning … caught lots of fish in our usual &/or backup holes. Between Thursday afternoon and Saturday morning, the barometer went on a roller coaster ride and we never got a bite where we had been catching fish. At first we were inclined to chalk it up to the fish getting lockjaw. But I lowered the camera into the water and discovered that the fish had simply disappeared … not one of the holes where we had caught fish earlier in the week showed fish on the camera. It was like all the walleye had been sucked into a black hole! We never found them but a friend with a cabin down the lake told us before we left that he found & caught them in a spot that is at the very bottom of our hole list.LESSON LEARNED: If the weather has changed and the fish aren't biting where you were catching them before, don't assume they simply shut down. Rather, they may have just moved to a new location off the beaten path.NOTE: Upon arrival each trip, we use the camera to scout holes. Dad fishes while I drop the camera into the water. If I don't see fish on the camera within 30 minutes, we move on to a new spot. When we find fish, we note the temp, depth and structure and target similar spots on the lake. Makes our time on the water MUCH more productive!"
1210373,hawks_rule,2010-06-15 15:31:00,115,"Interesting observation, was your depth finder still showing fish after they had vacated the normal locations? What type of camera do you have?"
1210378,81Saluki,2010-06-15 15:42:00,97,Hawkeye -- Our depth finder *always* shows fish. :-) We were never able to figure out the right settings/sensitivity for it to accurately detect fish. That's one reason why I bought the camera ... an Altlantis AUW-701. 81Saluki -- your neighbor in Des Moines
1211262,81Saluki,2010-06-18 09:16:00,97,"Grandpa told me many years ago this little rhyme that I will always remember:When the wind is from the west, That's when fishing is the best.When the wind is from the south, It blows the bait into their mouth.When the wind is from the east, That's when fishing is the least.-----I've found the rhyme to be fairly accurate and it is well-documented that the barometer can affect fish behavior.So -- back to my original post about the walleye disappearing -- what I found most interesting during my underwater camera observations is that they didn't just quit biting, they vacated the areas after the wind shifted from the east.It would be interesting to hear from any experts/biologists on this topic … do walleye really get ""lockjaw"" or do they move to a new location/structure ... or both?Hmmm. Just curious."
1211282,bassface44,2010-06-18 10:24:00,96,"Pressure has a great affect. When you have high pressure after a cold front winds often come from the east as winds from the high pressure system move clockwise. think of the density of water compared to air for a moment. Higher pressure has a greater affect on organisms in a liquid environment. This does not mean that fish will not feed more so that the feeding windows will be smaller. Also, they will move, often deeper, as pressure effects will be greater at shallower depths."
1211290,Skywagon,2010-06-18 10:45:00,1106,"81Saluki, I'll bet you are not out fishing in this wind today. Question, what depth-structure did you find the fish in? Mayflies seem to be out in force, wondering if that may not play into the equation also."
1211332,alanexpup,2010-06-18 12:19:00,278,the pressure thing is a myth. just think about it for a second. the maximum change in the barometric pressure would be be equal to what maybe a one inch change in the pressure of water column?? do you think the fish can tell the difference in depth of 1 inch? I dont think so. just my 2 cents.

1211365,Bill Krejca,2010-06-18 13:52:00,6107,"I think it is just amazing that with all the technology we have today, articles written on walleyes fitted with transmitters never reveal the whole story - that is, their movements in respect to the weather. Specifically, how they move when the wind blows - from where to where, how pressure, etc., affects them in respect to movements. All I've ever seen is a general direction based on seasons, very little on their movements with respect to daily weather changes. I just have a difficult time believing observations of this nature are not made. I realize this is not a camera issue, per the thread, but feel it fits with the spirit of the discussion. Comments are welcome. Bill Krejca"
1211391,81Saluki,2010-06-18 15:38:00,97,SkyWagon -- our best holes before the barometer went haywire and the mayflies hatched were rocky areas in 6-10 feet.BillK -- Dad and I had that exact same conversation (re: transmitter data) while he was jigging in empty waters and I was watching a blank TV screen. We believe there has to be some researcher out there somewhere who's put transmitters with GPS/temp/depth/barometer sensors on walleye. Hmmm. Maybe I should apply for some federal stimulus money to do that. :-)81Saluki
