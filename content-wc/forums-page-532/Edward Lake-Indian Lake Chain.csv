1211637,bpetersen,2010-06-19 20:26:00,251,"The present owners bought the resort from Kevin and Karen Welniak. They own Buster's restaurant in Vermilion Bay. A very good place to eat. Kevin and Karen bought the resort from Scott and Lee Ballentyne. If I remember correctly, Scott's dad and granddad started the resort. It is always interesting to read about the owners of this resort. How these owners operate the resort sound just how Kevin and Karen ran it and how Scott and Lee ran it. I know Kevin spent an entire summer with the present owners. It sounds like they listened well. I might have to go back and try the resort again some day."

1174576,wishinfishinmn,2010-03-04 18:31:00,52,of the lakes on the indian lake chain. Which one do you like to fish the best? Which is the most scenic?
1174592,bpetersen,2010-03-04 19:19:00,251,"Boulder and Little Boulder. I have not fished Forest, however."
1211276,JEREDOG,2010-06-18 09:58:00,21,Northern fishing is getting real good on the Indian Lake Chain now. Walleye fishing there has been real hot this year too. just got back from there. i stayed at indian lake lodge
1211463,bpetersen,2010-06-18 20:44:00,251,How did you like the new owners? I stayed at Indian Lake Lodge many times with two previous owners. I know their prices went up when they took over two or three years ago.
1211473,JEREDOG,2010-06-18 22:27:00,21,"W love them. they are Derek and Cassy and they are some of the nicest host to have. derek or their dock hand, Dan are at the docks everytime you get off the lake. They even will ask if you want your fish cleaned everytime. we love them. we are going back up in August. who were the owners when you went??"
1211474,Guest,2010-06-18 22:30:00,0,"My experience has been great with the new owners(Derek , Cassy & kids)The long term guests have informed me they are the best thing thats happened to the camp.Very friendly and great help.They are a younger couple (mid 30s) and have the drive to make it happen.Well worth trying again if that was your thoughts."
1211495,81Saluki,2010-06-19 05:56:00,97,"Fishing preferences [walleye]? Spring = Whitney & Cobble. Summer/Fall = Forest & Whitney. We've never fished Edwards or Indian/Alexandra, however.Most scenic? Boy, that's a hard question to answer. For me, everywhere is scenic!! We have a cabin on Forest and love the view from our point. The entire chain is sparsely populated so the views from nearly all the prime fishing holes are pristine and peaceful. Bald eagles are a regular sight. With a keen eye and a little luck, you have a fairly good chance of seeing deer, moose or bear along the shore and -- if you're REALLY lucky -- you might even see a fawn, calf or cub with momma in the Spring. Wolves are seen/heard upon occasion. Every year yields new memories that will last a lifetime. But my most memorable ""scene"" is from 1997 when I saw another boat pierce a fog bank early one summer morning ... I can still hear the putt-putt sound of his motor and the birds singing. A close 2nd is getting a moose and her calf on video. Ahhhh, life is good on the Indian Lake Chain.81Saluki"
1211568,JEREDOG,2010-06-19 12:19:00,21,"yeah, what cat said is right. i know some long term guests that come multiple times a year. they said that Derek and Cassy are the best owners that the camp has seen. i also think that their dock service is second to none. this year is even better than the previouse years. they have new dock numbers so it is very easy to find your slip and Dan is alwayse there to help you clean our fish and help you onto the dock"
1170304,bpetersen,2010-02-19 12:49:00,251,"No sign by the entrance to the Corner Lake landing, (not much of a landing) watch out for big rock right at the landing. The sign I was think of is the Dunbar Road sign which is about 200 yards north of the little entrance to Corner/Langton Lake Forest Access Road or whatever it is called. There just isn't a sign marking the entrance. It is easy to miss."
1170323,v-bay gord,2010-02-19 13:48:00,3168,"No, the Corner Lake access road definately has a sign. It is an MNR sign that says ""Langton Lake Forest Access Road"". I think the access you are talking about with the big boulder might be for Indian Lake."
1170336,bpetersen,2010-02-19 14:16:00,251,"You are probably right about the sign, just don't remember it. There is a BIG boulder easy to see at Indian Lake Lodge ramp but there is a one at Corner, also. My prop told me so. Water isn't as clear at Corner ramp (sand shore line) as Indian Lake Lodge ramp."
1170441,wishinfishinmn,2010-02-19 20:24:00,52,What is the slot limit on this lake for walleye? Do you have to immidiately kill the fish like Lac Seul or can you use the live well?
1170574,bpetersen,2010-02-20 12:01:00,251,One fish over 18.1 inches and yes you can keep them alive in the livewell.
1171198,dcraven,2010-02-22 17:49:00,47,"Corner Lake is a fabulous walleye lake. Twenty years ago, when the fishing on Eagle was tough on certain years for walleyes, you would see fifteen or so camp boats on Corner from the Eagle Lake resorts, alone. It is known as a great lake for numbers, but I have seen fish up to 13 lbs taken in Corner - usually on muskie baits. Yes, most of the muskies are smaller, but my family has seen fish killed (years back by folks fishing for walleyes) at least to 28 lbs...; and we've seen larger fish. The access is poor and tough for turning around. Back in the eighties we started catching a lot of tiger muskies in there as the owner of Blue Lake store, at the time, released pike into Blue to ""improve"" the fishing. On a high water year many beaver dams were blown out between Blue and Corner and this is how pike entered Corner/Langton and the IL Chain. When I started fishing it as a kid in the mid-seventies there were no pike in Corner, then about 1986 or so we started catching a tiger or two and then finally pike grew to numbers where they are today."
1171210,bpetersen,2010-02-22 18:27:00,251,Thanks for the information. I have really enjoyed fishing Corner over the passed 15 years or so.
1171391,wishinfishinmn,2010-02-23 11:59:00,52,my family and i are staying at kc's landing first week of august. would like to try this corner lake. can you get there by boat from the resort?
1171443,skindzier,2010-02-23 15:25:00,137,I believe there is a falls that cuts it off from the rest of the chain.
1171516,bpetersen,2010-02-23 20:34:00,251,You cannot access Corner or Langton by boat. Local resort owners have tried to build up the narrow area where to water comes from Corner/Langton to keep northern out. They want to keep the muskie thriving well in the chain beyond Corner/Langton. From my understanding about small northern is they are more agressive at a younger age. The small norther will kill small muskie. They truly love their muskie in the chain.
1168402,81Saluki,2010-02-12 12:25:00,97,"MuskieBob is spot on with his guess. Our cabin (on the north end of Forest) is 5.5 miles from Clarks.If there is still a problem with Indian Lake Lodge's link to the Forest Lake map, I archived it years ago and just posted the high resolution version on my web site. You can only find it here:http://www.bolen.net/private/lakemaps/forest.pdf81Saluki"
1168731,Guest,2010-02-13 21:09:00,0,"I've fished the ILC since 1977 and my father since 1958. If you have some fishing skills you should do fine for walleyes up there. Clarks have a great beach for kids at KC's Landing. My family will be there the first week in August. Whitney Lake, the lake between Cobble and Edwards is about 1.5 miles from the resort. It is a great place to take kids and fish the last one and one half hours before dark. Walleyes can be trolled with number 5 shad raps in 6-10 feet of water or you could fish slip bobbers in ten feet of water right next to some of the shoreline points on the west side of the lake. There is a little island in Whitney, too, that many folks anchor off of and catch walleyes. Fish 8-12 ft of water with an anchor and you'll do fine. Move around if you don't find fish. When you do, the fish should continue to produce for you in that same spot and similar spots for your week's stay."
1169245,wishinfishinmn,2010-02-15 17:38:00,52,is the indian lake chain a clear lake? fish deeper in the summer for walleyes or is it stained similar to lac seul?
1169351,81Saluki,2010-02-16 04:37:00,97,"I've never been to Lac Seul so I can't make a comparison. But I can drop my camera in 15 feet of water and see for quite a ways (see this video). As for where the walleye are in the summer ... it depends. ;-) I've caught them both shallow (<10') and deep (20-25'). Rocky bottom is always our 1st choice. Then timber, little humps and holes. I'm sure Clarks/KCs will let you know where they're at when you get there."
1169877,dcraven,2010-02-17 18:40:00,47,"The ILC has varying water clarities depending on what lake you are fishing. Indian/Alexandra has a mild clay-colored stain to it. Edwards fairly clear, the next lake, Whitney is heavily clay-colored as are the next two -Cobble and Bladder. Big Boulder, the next is very clear and Little Boulder is gin clear. The other lake, Forrest, varies from fairly clear to a slight clay-stain since the water flows out of Whitney and into Forrest."
1170049,cspierings,2010-02-18 12:56:00,230,"I haven't fished the Indian Chain in a few years but in terms of water clarity the chain is stained but still clearer than Lac Seul, I have never seen much an algae bloom on that chain but you do see the water get green on LS. Someone earlier commented on Corner this lake is a sleeper for walleye and muskie. My Dad and I had one day where he caught 13 muskie while we were fishing. You can't get from the Indian Chain to Corner because of a falls but if you decide to give it a try let me know, send me a message and I can share a couple spots that produced well for us. In terms of the Indian chain for us the fish were typically smaller than corner but the numbers were a bit higher."
1170083,skindzier,2010-02-18 16:06:00,137,"We do a combined Lac Seul for walleyes/V Bay area for muskies trip every year & I've been kicking around trying Corner for muskies. Is the access road marked off of 647? If not not, what are the markers? Thanks a bunch!"
1170116,bpetersen,2010-02-18 19:52:00,251,I will have to think about the name on the sign into corner. It isn't much of a road. It is one lane only. The owners of Indian Lake use to send us over to Corner to fish for Northern. We caught a few muskie but not many. After a few trips to Corner we realized how good the walleye fishing can be. It is a nice little lake and even smallmouth can be caught.
1170117,v-bay gord,2010-02-18 19:54:00,3168,"You are thinking of the ""Langton Lake Forest Access Road"", which is Corner Lake."
1170136,skindzier,2010-02-19 01:15:00,137,Thanks guys!
1166371,wishinfishinmn,2010-02-05 09:32:00,52,Anyone fish this lake in August?Need some intel before making a trip reservation.
1166541,bpetersen,2010-02-05 20:24:00,251,I have fished the chain several times in late July and August. What are you fishing for?
1166600,wishinfishinmn,2010-02-06 08:27:00,52,Looking at taking my twin 6 year olds. So this time of the year water should be a bit warmer. Fishing walleyes on reefs. Staying at Clark's camp. Would like to find reefs as close as possible so kids can go out for a few hours a day and when they are done they and mom can hang out at the beach.My friend would like to try and get some muskies. I love to hook into smallies as well.
1166604,Thumpr50,2010-02-06 08:49:00,139,"Fished Indian Chain several year ago, stayed at Clark's you will not find better hosts than Wayne & Karla anywhere, everything top notch. Lots of walleyes although not a lot of big ones, muskie fishing very good as well. Great place to go with your sons, great action water. Have fun!"
1166794,bpetersen,2010-02-06 22:04:00,251,"I have heard Clark's is a good place to stay. I stayed at Indian Lake Lodge on Indian Lake (Alexandra Lake). Indian Lake Lodge on their website has maps of all of the lakes in the chain, nothing exceptional but o.k. Hopefully this link will take you to the map sight.http://www.indianlakelodge.com/index.php?menu_id=5615 The chain is full of Muskie. While fishing walleye, we always have muskie contact and bring several in on lindy rigs. I have fished both spring and summer on the chain. Fishing spots are different in the summer. I will concentrate on the summer. There are not a lot of reefs in Edward, some, or Indian. We had some luck in Indian in the evening but to be honest, we would fish close to the lodge a couple of day and then head out to our old standbys toward the end of the chain in cobble, boulder and little boulder. It is about an 8+ mile run from Edward. You have to go through a couple of narrow areas with stumps. The locals and game wardens have know problem going at high speed though this area but even after several years of going through them, I go sloooooooow. Smallmouth fishing can be found in Cobble, Boulder and Little Boulder. I never caught smallies in Edward or Indian Lake. Our resort owner always said the smallies were in the three lakes I listed above. There are reefs down down there and much deeper water for summer fishing. Bigger fish to be had on the reefs down there. Don't get me wrong. We would always catch walleye in Indian and Edward but eaters only. They will be scattered in late summer. In between Edward and Indian, you will come across a reef. Keep an eye on your electronics. There is a good spot where the reef goes up to a point on shore. A small island just getting into Indian has very good walleye structure on the east side. Watch out for muskie around that little island, lost of boulders. In the northeast corner of Indian there is a nice weed batch, fish the edge. The falls coming in from Langley lake is good for walleye, also. Also, a beautiful little area to take a little hike (very little) and take the little one to see the falls and Langley. There is a small man-make **** there to keep the northern from coming in the chain. Northerns are very hard on young muskie and they love their muskie up there. By the way, we fished 95% crawlers and always had great luck with them. Jig and minnow works well if you go down in Litlle boulder and jig the reef drop-offs. By the way, If you have your own boat or Clark's has boats on Corner. Corner is a very good northern and walleye lake. It is a very short drive. Blue lake is right next door. It is a very good smallie lake. It is a beautiful area. You and your son will have a ball. My boys have some great memories on the chain. Great blueberries that time of the year. Let me know if I can be more help. Pete"
1167122,81Saluki,2010-02-08 09:17:00,97,We have a cabin on Forest Lake (the northern-most lake in the chain). Late August is usually a great time to fish so you should be good. Cobble & Forest are our go-to lakes that time of year for walleye.Muskie? We don't actively seek them but know that our cabin's point and nearby islands are among the most popular locations in the area.For more info see: http://www.bolen.net/html/canada/index.htmlBest Wishes & Good Luck!!
1167233,Muskie Bob,2010-02-08 15:40:00,45,"call or email Karla with your questions and concerns.Although I have never stayed at one their camps on Indian lake Chain, I meet them while staying at their camp on Cedar Lake. Wayne and Karla are great hosts and will give you some good advice and help.I'm sure they will have a marked map showing fish locations and stumps, etc. Be sure to ask for one and make sure you understand the markings and where the stumps are located.If you don't have any muskie lures, get a Mepps #5 bucktail (silver blade and black tail). A walk the dog top water would be a fun lure too.I only fished Indian Lake Chain once for muskies. Forest Lake area is one of my favorite areas. Depending on weather, muskies sometimes like to sun in a small shallow bay around late morning or mid day.If you would like other lure suggestions, etc., send me an email [email protected]"
