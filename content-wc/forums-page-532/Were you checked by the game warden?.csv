1211025,Guest,2010-06-17 12:41:00,0,"We need to be clear about something! Even though it likes to think it is, Ontario is NOT Canada! It is a Province and each Province does its own thing just like your States. In Manitoba for example, Game Wardens DO NOT ENFORCE any of the boating safety, registration or licencing regulations. None, zero, zip, nada! The Manitoba Government has told the Federal Government that if it wants Federal regulations enforced, they can cough up the dough to do it or do it themselves. Therefore, in Manitoba the RCMP is the only enforcement body that has the authority to enforce any boating related regulation. Although slightly possible it highly improbable that anyone will get checked, let alone charged for boating violations in Manitoba. The RCMP have much bigger fish to fry than a guy in a 14 foot tin can trying to get a feed of fish."
1211035,campchick,2010-06-17 13:06:00,96,"Thanks for your reply Gaterhunter. It sounds like I live and do business in the wrong province. My guests (and there are fewer of them every year), shouldn't be hassled as soon as they cross the border into Canada. It is bad for business. There is also a ""trickle down effect"" to every town our guests drive through. Less restaurant meals, less gas sales, less tackle sales and souvenir sales. I recently heard of a group of May fishermen who were torn apart at the customs and allowed to proceed into Canada. Nothing was found. They were caught for speeding and fined. At the outpost lake the game wardens checked them and fined them for improper packaging of fish. They vowed never return to Ontario. They said Minnesota has fish too."
1211040,stumcfar,2010-06-17 13:24:00,451,"In Minnesota they will fine you for speeding and they will ticket people for transporting fish the incorrect way, so you can't feel too sorry for those offenses. The border hassles will deter people if they are done unprofessionally and rudely."
1211043,JayM5209,2010-06-17 13:46:00,1050,"Campchick, don't generalize too far from the experience of your guests who related the above experiences. If they were speeding, they should be cited and fined. If they didn't have fish packaged in a manner meeting the regs., they should be cited. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is willingness to exceed the established limits or evade reasonable requirements of the fishing/game laws.I've been traveling to NW Ontario for more than thirty years, in recent years twice/yr. I have been questioned at the border - both ways - and had coolers looked at once. Three times my group has been checked by MNR or OPP officers - once on Wabigoon, once on Ord, and once a freezer and refrigerator check in camp. We were clean on all occasions. If my truck was examined every time I came to Ontario, it would not diminish my eagerness to make the trip nor be considered too much hassle to do it again.I know those of you in the tourist business, and related ones dependent on the level of traffic, are hurting. I think it is a reflection of economic times and people needing to make choices about using limited resources. In general, it is not because the OPP and MNR personnel are doing their jobs. Frankly, IMHO, you don't need guests who get PO'd and threaten to not come back because of their own ignorance or willful disregard of the rules and regulations. Fortunately, there have only been a few expressions of that kind of sick attitude on this site, and it's only been a very few rare occasions where I've run into it during my trips north. It's reassuring to know that the vast majority of the fishermen/fisherwomen coming north of the border enjoy the experience, are grateful for the hospitality and helpfulness of their camp/resort hosts, and are respectful not only of the natural resources and environment, but also are respectful of the officers who protect these resources and the public safety.Can't wait for late August for my 2nd trip this year with my son.........."
1211077,Tonyo,2010-06-17 16:09:00,212,"Our group recently returned from Gullrock Lake and was checked on the water while we there. This was the first time in 10 years anyone in our group was checked. He asked to look into the livewells of each of the boats, wanted to know exactly how many fish we had in the resort's freezer and asked to see each license. He then went back to camp and checked the freezer and compared the notes he took to the count in the freezer and all was well. My opinion is to understand the laws of the province you visit and the rules on the lake you fish. If you do, it is a wonderful experience that you will enjoy for years to come. TonyO"
1211095,2746,2010-06-17 17:21:00,3206,"We've been checked twice on Gullrock in the 10 years we've been going there. (not this year however) Both times our experience was just like Tony's. Polite guys who were doing their job well and only checked fish against license. (one stop was in the afternoon and they asked about fish we had eaten for shore lunch. We knew that rule and gave them accurate information) I appreciate Jay's post as well. This spring one of the guests at the lodge we stayed had come up with one of his adult sons along with two boats. His second son was coming in from Utah. He was stopped at customs for a 9 year old DUI and had to go back to Salt Lake City. Family was bummed and said never again. But, as Jay said, it's a matter of just knowing the laws. These folks were regulars, knew about DUI's and Canada and knew they could take care of the situation ahead of time by applying for a permit.....they just chose to take a short cut and hoped to ""get by"". To blame that on Canada doesn't make much sense."
1211096,fireboat,2010-06-17 17:28:00,752,"Been checked once in 60 yrs. and it was this year. End of the day and the warden was trying to check every boat coming off the lake, looking for short fish. I knew we were 100% legal so I decided to jack with him a little. We got the boat on the trailer, tried to look as guilty as we could and took off. He caught up with us at the fish cleaning station, checked our fish, boat, license. I told him what we did and we all had a good laugh."
1211426,walleyeduran,2010-06-18 18:16:00,286,"fireboat, that is a good way to get the rubber glove treatment. Conservation officers and border patrol agents, as a rule, don't like to joke. They take their job very seriously. Duran"
1211441,Little Billy,2010-06-18 19:08:00,1,Liquor and fish are the main issues.There is no problem if you know and obay the law. Remenber it is there country.
1211460,fireboat,2010-06-18 20:25:00,752,"Like I said, we were 100% legal. He didn't tell us to wait at the ramp for him to check us. It was his choice to follow us. I could have driven home instead and he would have never caught up with us. If he got the rubber gloves out, it very well could have cost him his job. I had a state patrol and a city cop with me. We know the law and weren't committing a crime."
1210113,campchick,2010-06-14 17:09:00,96,"I'm just curious if any users were checked by the game warden this spring. What area were you fishing? Are they checking for liquor in the boat, boater safety cards and safety equipment in the boats (life jackets, paddles, whistle, throwing line, flashlight) Thanks to all that reply."
1210142,Obabikon,2010-06-14 19:19:00,2370,"A warden stopped by the camp a couple days ago. I usually see one a season, so hopefully that's it. He was polite and easy to work with. Looked at the freezers, asked me some questions... then off he went. While he was in the area, none of my guests got checked. There was not an OPP officer with him, so he couldn't have been looking for booze. (I'm on Lake of the Woods)"
1210186,Guest,2010-06-14 21:24:00,0,We were checked a few weeks ago. One group had poor packaging and were warned. He talked to all of our guests (very polite). End result: guests were aware the laws are enforced. Perfect.
1210250,onetimedave,2010-06-15 07:28:00,502,We have been checked at customs at the SOO the past three years. Fishing license and coolers. They won't believe we have no fish. A pain in the .
1210351,campchick,2010-06-15 14:21:00,96,"Still looking for anyone who can tell me what the wardens are checking for. As a camp owner I'm interested whether they even check boat safety kits, etc. This year boater safety cards are required and I have forms for guests to sign so that they are legal. Are the wardens even asking to see these? My experience is that fishermen have just had enough. Even though I explain the rules I notice that they don't listen and leave the unsigned forms on the kitchen table and go fishing. Do any camp owners have the same problem?"
1210645,REG,2010-06-16 10:14:00,445,"I haven't been checked for a few years while on the water. But the couple times I was checked, the only thing they seemed interested in were the licenses. No questions on life jackets, horn, lines, etc like you get if stopped in the states. I was just up the first week of June and the owner of the camp said the wardens were really busy the week before we got there - even came into camp to count fish one day. No mention of boater safety cards, etc."
1210646,Reels,2010-06-16 10:20:00,2876,"It has been discussed here over the winter quite a bit that a boater safety card is not needed if operating own boat and visiting less than 45 days. I think that is the same subject you are talking about, if not sorry. If you do a search on boating safety cards, there are some good discussions."
1210715,campchick,2010-06-16 13:15:00,96,Thanks for replying to this thread. My guests don't bring their own boats - they use mine. They typically stay for a week or less. I understand that a boater safety card from their home state covers them while in Canada. Those who do not have a boater safety card must fill out a form at the camp they are staying at and have it in the boat with them. It looks like the game wardens are not checking for these cards at all.
1210920,J-Man,2010-06-17 06:52:00,191,"Wardens are considered peace officers and can check for safety equipment, boater cards, liquor, fishing licenses, etc. We had some guests checked a week ago, but no wardens came into the resort. Nobody reported being asked about anything other than fish and licenses.I would like to see them come in every other week so that people are aware that they could be stopped anytime. Like most cases involving law enforcement....if you are following the rules, you have nothing to worry about."
1210961,Guest,2010-06-17 08:58:00,0,"We have even seen people checked up on Lac Seul by wardens in airplanes ---- When we have been checked -- it's almost always the same procedure - life vests, illegal size of fish, safety equipment."
