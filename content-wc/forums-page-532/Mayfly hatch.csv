1210852,1shooter,2010-06-16 20:45:00,1493,Just came back from LOTW and the south side of Miles bay was nasty with mayflies. They hatched. Fishing was good though.
1208247,Obabikon,2010-06-08 16:58:00,2370,"Mayfly hatch has started here... fishing is still pretty good, but the walleyes are full of them."
1208353,Steve of Madison,2010-06-08 21:26:00,230,"This is fantastik news, our group goes up July 9 and no mayfly hatch to concern ourselves with. The best news I've had in a month."
1208368,Rock Hound,2010-06-08 22:32:00,51,"I would agree that it is best not to fish during a hatch - but on a week long trip if you are unlucky enough to be there while a hatch is on, you still have the challenge of competing with nature's feedbag - or you could just sit at camp and stew. I have had great luck during mayfly hatches, both in Canada and at home fishing the Mississippi river. In fact, one of my best days ever on the Mississippi river was during a huge mayfly hatch (also 90 degree weather). What works for me? A jig threaded with half a night crawler - does anyone else go to this when the hatch is on? Or does anyone else have ""go to"" tricks for a hatch?"
1208513,IowaDave,2010-06-09 09:12:00,69,"I go when the hatch is on if the hatch is on when I'm going! We always plan our Canada trips a year in adavnce, so if they're hatching when we get up there we just figure out how to deal with it and adapt. Like I said earlier, I found the linked thread above to have some helpful tips."
1208615,v-bay gord,2010-06-09 14:01:00,3168,During a mayfly hatch you can often improve your odds by speeding up your presentation (trolling Raps for example) or upsizing your baits......or both. Also time of day may dictate when the feeding frenzy occurs.........often the major hatches occur during the warmest and highest light period of the day. So if they are not feeding in the morning check back in the afternoon. Mud flats and adjacent weed areas are the spots to key in on. If you can't make the shallow bite work then a fall back is always those fish that are using deeper structure and not necessarily feeding on mayfly larvae.
1208658,oldlakerat,2010-06-09 16:43:00,4,Any mayflys hatching at red lake ?
1208693,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-09 18:25:00,241,"mayflys hatch in sandy and muddy bottoms,cut those bellies open and your eyes will be FULL of larvae, high protein walleye food. Go back into those back bays and down size your cranks or jigs and darken your colors to brown , black, or dark red, hope this helps."
1209037,5richards,2010-06-10 18:04:00,131,Any mayfly report around red lake or little vermilion -- also any significant rain lately

1210820,stevie,2010-06-16 19:22:00,21,"mayfly tactics -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's up in the air but you will very likley see some affects.the hatch started in ernest on most of eagle sat. 6/12 some shallower lakes earlier,some deeper lakes just starting after a week of just an inclincing which really only stimulated the bite. we are seeing some affects now but not the end of the world,how long it will last is up to mother nature and water temps/moon phases. the mayfly hatch puts the fear of god into anglers and yes it can slow fishing down some but with some modifications of presentations and the way you approach your day you can still end up with outstanding catches. for instance we had gillespie filming,came in sun pm.,day after the first 2 heavy hatches,2 days is all we had and he wanted 2 shows to go home with,ok,we went to the coldest water in the lake to get behind the hatch best we could vs going to the shallowest mud bottomed part of the lake and concentrated on heavy cabbage beds and caught alot of nice 19-24"" walleyes along with a 14-15# pike,stopped for an hr caught a bunch of bass,and ended the day fishing deeper water breaks with big chubs and boated a 27"" and a 31"" (losing 2 other big fish) to cap off a good day on the water and a good show. the show will be aired next sat. 2nd day he and danny fly into a deep clear lake to show we do many diff things here also to try and be ahead of a hatch vs going into a shallow mud bottomed lake (that were all smok'n last week)and boated 200+ walleyes 60+ 24-30"" . john said it was his best day of inland walleye fishing in 800+ shows,all during the peak of the mayfly hatch. the fly in show will be shown mid july. if it would have been last week or next week we might have reversed philosphys,so key here is try and fish lakes or sections of lakes you are either ahead or behind the hatch when ever you can and it can be done, diff. lakes,or sections of lakes depending on make up,depth,bottom composition,etc. don't all hatch or at least heavily at exactly the same time. right now we have fish both in the weeds/flats 6-14' and on the reefs moving up and down from 15' to as deep as 32'. obviously the fish in deep water will be less affected than the fish on the mud flats and thats has been proved last few days though some good catches have been coming out of emerging cabbage beds also just spots with heavy action vs several fish here and there are more scattered than last week when flats and weeds were THE dominate pattern. REMEMBER THEY ARE GORGING,so going to smaller presentations like leeches,tails of crawlers,smaller minnows on light wire hooks or very lite jigs 1/32-1/64 when fishing weeds (though bigger minnows are always better when fishing deep),,slip bobbers, long lindy rigs, in other words finesse presentations are one way to go,give them a very natural presentation dessert instead of a full meal which they already have had the night before. the death hook technique with a 1/3 crawler can be deadly during a hatch regardless if fishing 6' or 30' of water. on 6'-16' flats take a small #0 or 1 colorado spinner rig in in gold or silver with a tail of a crawler and a very lite weight very slowly elec trolled with a long line,let it sink and flutter to the bottom then with a long rod slowly pull it towards the surface,dropping your rod tip and stopping the trolling motor to coast while it sinks fluttering down with a few twitches of the rod tip then start back up and very slowly pull it towards the surface repeating the process,it imitates a hatching mayfly. another opposite tactic is to try and trigger fish. trolling smaller shallow running cranks a bit faster than normal off boards and long lined will usually will put some fish in the boat especially in the pms. over the flats or deeper breaks divers like shad raps or flicker shads on the edges of breaks and weedlines during the day, a 3 way with a stickbait shallow runner over deeper mud flats,the key is just a bit more speed than normal to trigger instinctive responses. i've seen where casting and cranking/ripping rattle traps or snap jigging spoons produced big fish. it isn't as bad as it's made out to be,yes it can slow things down some but it isn't the end of the world and if you're where walleyes are you will catch fish even sticking with conventioanl methods,many just use it as an excuse when they don't catch fish,it''s a good one and one that has some merit,but..... good luck and stay positive thats the main thing. steve ANDY MYERS LODGE EAGLE LAKE"
1206013,back357,2010-06-01 17:23:00,106,Anyone have accounts of Mayfly hatches in Ontario as of yet? Just wondering if they have already hatched or should I be prepared in a few weeks.
1206021,Obabikon,2010-06-01 17:48:00,2370,no hatches yet... but the walleye are eating the larva.
1206085,ranger22,2010-06-01 20:44:00,124,"How does one know that they are eating the larva? opening up the stomach? Canadain sheild lakes when the hatch happens what type of area do you target? Do you look for different bottoms, windy sideof the lake. Sorry for the Q just trying to expand my fishing knowledge."
1206140,Obabikon,2010-06-02 04:18:00,2370,"yeah... opening up the stomach. They have the same patterns then... so, where you fish for them depends on what the walleyes are doing. The problem is, a lot of them are so full from eating the may flies that it's tougher to catch them. But, they're still there. Typically, when the hatch happens we have a slight slow down. I don't find it to be as big of a deal as a lot of people do. You're still going to catch walleyes on reefs, shorelines or whatever their pattern is at the time."
1206237,PRD1,2010-06-02 08:54:00,458,"We were on the Umfreville lake on the English River last week and there were a few but not many Mayflies hatching. Did not seem to effect the fishing which was very good. Good numbers of fish with a number in the mid 20s and one guy got a 27"""
1206349,IowaDave,2010-06-02 14:37:00,69,I was looking for info about fishing during the mayfly hatch a week or so ago & found this thread to have some good info:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=mayfly
1207463,back357,2010-06-06 07:53:00,106,PRD - sounds like you had a great trip. What depth were you fishing on the Umfreville?
1207474,J-Man,2010-06-06 08:33:00,191,Seeing some mayflys the last two mornings here in the Morson area. It will be time to turn the yard lights off at night for a couple of weeks soon. Much earlier than the last two years when the weather was cold in the spring into June.
1208038,DonC,2010-06-08 06:51:00,93,The mayfly hatches are heavy the past 2 days. Don
1208056,PRD1,2010-06-08 07:51:00,458,"The fish were still relatively shallow in Umfreville, Walleye in 5-12 feet or so and did well on slip bobbers and crank baits. The pike were still in the spring pattern, along shoreline and in bays, most were in under 10' of water with the bigger ones seeming to hug the shoreline as usual early in the year. Main lake temps in the mid 50s with bays into the mid 60s during the day. The water temps were cooler than I expected given the nery early ice-out. We were hampered a couple days by strong south winds that really churned up the water in some areas."
