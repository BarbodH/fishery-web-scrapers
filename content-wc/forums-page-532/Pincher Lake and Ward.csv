1210788,csuram,2010-06-16 16:22:00,18,Does anyone have any updates or info on Pincher lake (only muskie) and Ward (large pike)lake..how does a lake only have muskie's in it..i am assuming it has other fish but it's billed as a muskie only lake. Wilderness Air fly's to two of these lakes and they both seem very interesting to our group. We have been told Ward has great Pike action and size. Would love any and all comments on either of these lakes ..Thanks!!

We caught nine muskies the day we flew in there. The largest was 29 inches. We saw one that might have went 32-33. Definitely numbers not size. We went in the day following a brutal cold front so it might not have been a good indicator of what is in there. We were told there were fish to 40 inches but we didn't see anything close to that.
