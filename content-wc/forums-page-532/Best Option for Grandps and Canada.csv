1208847,Mondo,2010-06-10 07:19:00,61,"Without a doubt Sunset Lodge, Red Lake Ontario. Check out their website at www.sunsetlodgeredlake.com Not only is this an awesome lake and the resort owner caters to families, the community of Red Lake has a complete Hospital facility in case something should happen. As a fire fighter/EMT, I'd suggest you consider something that has these amenities nearby. Some of the remote drive-in locations or smaller towns will not have any medical facilities within miles. My party of 14 people have been going to this resort for 20+ years. It's been a great place to make memories, catch a bunch of quality fish and relax. Best of luck!"

1209695,wmd,2010-06-13 11:51:00,388,which lake did you fish at Hidden Bay? Do you have any knowledge of the other lakes they have?wmd
1209873,Guest,2010-06-13 23:18:00,0,"As someone who has had to use the Canadian medical system TWICE...I would have to agree with Mondo that you should look for resorts/lakes within short travel time to medical facilities....just in case. A couple suggestions would be around Kenora, Red Lake, Dryden or Sioux Lookout areas. All 4 have lakes that fit your descriptions of what you're looking for in fishing and the ability to ""go to town"" for a little time out of the boat and experience the life of real Canadians."
1210261,Skiuseme,2010-06-15 08:11:00,5,"I would suggest using Andersons Lodge in Sioux Lookout. Their Staff is Fantastic, have great facilities, a great fleet of Large Boats, and is full service. Not too bad of a drive from I-Falls about 3.5 hours. I have been going there for 13 years and would not change. I wont fix whats not broken."
1211846,wmd,2010-06-20 15:46:00,388,"This looks like an interesting place, I looked at their website and it looks like it is well run. Which lake did you fish and do you know anything about the other lakes?Thankswmd"
1208248,TheRattler,2010-06-08 16:59:00,163,My Grandfather is 84 and really wants to go to Canada fishing with our entire family (10 people) before isn't able to do it any longer. Can someone give us some suggestions on a good resort/outfitter to go to that would allow us all to do this. We live in South Dakota so north of ND/MN would be our best option. Plus he is not at an age where a fly in is not an option. We would like to fish for walleye/northern/smallies. Thanks
1208254,biggamefisher,2010-06-08 17:13:00,540,"Here are two; Trail End Camp, road access to the remote Whiteshell Park , spend alot of time up there, fantastic. Eagle's Nest Lodge, road access to the landing, then they take you by boat 27 miles up river to the lodge, great lodge. Both these places are on the Winnipeg River (but it's more like a lake), has the three species you are after. They both have wesites."
1208258,Kevin R,2010-06-08 17:25:00,305,When are you planing to go ?
1208271,wingmann,2010-06-08 18:13:00,42,"There are numerous good resorts on Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul. For LOTW check out Duck Bay Lodge, Obabikion or Witchbay Camp. Lac Seul try Silver Water Wheel Lodge, Lost Island Lodge or Evergreen Lodge. These are all good quality camps with great fishing. You won't be disappointed no matter which one you go to.Wingmann"
1208276,BGunn,2010-06-08 18:21:00,880,"I've been here (Lake of the Woods, Northwest Angle), and they have everything your looking for. We stayed in a large house/camp that I'm pretty sure 10 would be no problem, and the owner Frank is a great guy and hard worker...http://www.baystorecamp.com/"
1208304,bellies exposed,2010-06-08 19:30:00,71,"dogtooth lake would be a great choice. its about 10 hours from sf,sd. i went in 2003 and 2004 and the fishing was amazing. been to busy to get back but planning on going next year. its by kenora. wayne and patty are great people. google dogtooth lake."

1208350,Justin Syder,2010-06-08 21:18:00,6,"Unfortunate you are unable to do a Fly in. We found a great deal!My group of 4 just returned from a 4 day fly in trip with Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout. I found them offering a 30% discounted special on their website. We were not planning a trip this year, but 30% off for a fly in, WOW, couldn't say no. Our buddy had fished with them in the past. The weather was great and the fishing was amazing. Good numbers and size. Best June fishing I had in years.The staff really took take of us. Price included groceries for our trip and free satellite internet at the cabin!!! Never heard of that before. I was able to call the girlfriend from the far wilds of Canada for free. Nice little perk!! They even gave us a free nights stay at their main lodge and seaplane base.I just might go on another trip, if they still have deals in August. Fingers crossed!Good Luck!Justin"
1208372,adempsey,2010-06-08 23:01:00,963,"No fly in because of the actual flight or because it is ""too rustic""? Just making sure because there are fly in lodges that are first class all the way, not a shed in the woods ."
1208493,alanb,2010-06-09 08:43:00,56,"What a cool thing to do with grandpa! I'm really looking forward to my yearly trip a few years from now when my son is old enough to go fishing with me and grandpa. It'll be a great experience for both of them. Something out of Morson on LOTW would probably be great to keep the time in a vehicle down. I've only had experience with Obabikon Bay Camp and it is a short 9 mile boat ride from Morson. They have a great staff, clean rooms and good fishing right around the camp (especially right off the dock for crappie). The only issue might be the hills on the island if grandpa has issues with elevation changes. Another bonus - from where you are coming from in the states, you can cross over in Baudette to avoid the long lines and hassles at International Falls. Alanb"
