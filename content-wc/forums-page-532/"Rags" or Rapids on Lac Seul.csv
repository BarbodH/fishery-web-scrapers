1210977,Northpoint,2010-06-17 09:42:00,38,Could someone explain to me what this refers to? Thanks Bob
1211012,Guest,2010-06-17 11:42:00,0,"Sure can Bob: The ""rags"" is kind of a short cut up on Lac Seul - Most people use that route (that is if it is not TOO shallow) to go up to the Chamberlain Narrows area on Lac Seul. It does cut quite a bit of time/distance off the longer route."
1211015,Guest,2010-06-17 11:48:00,0,"Sure can Bob: The ""Rags"" is kind of a short cut up on Lac Seul - Most people use that route (that is if it is not TOO shallow) to go up to the Chamberlain Narrows area on Lac Seul. It does cut quite a bit of time/distance off the longer route. It is only somewhat narrow, but fairly shallow, and you have to know the route to go through it safely. I guess I don't think that narrow area is called the ""Rapids"" also - as the ""Rapids"", at least as we know it, is the area that is kind of an ""S"" area before you even get to the Rags. The water flows through there rapidly (whether high OR low water)."
