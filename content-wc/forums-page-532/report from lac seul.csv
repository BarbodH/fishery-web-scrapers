1210777,eyefanatic,2010-06-16 15:16:00,25,A mayfly hatch can effect how and where we fish. I am assuming that it has to be getting close to the time when the large mayflys start hatching in the shallow bays. Does anyone know the water temp and when the mayflys typically hatch? Any updates on the current lake conditions would be much appreciated! Thanks.
1211050,Jigger1,2010-06-17 14:07:00,234,"Got back on Monday. We fished June 9-13 and with the exception of the afternoon of the 13th had 4.5 days of overcast conditions which held surface temperatures in the 60 - 61.5 degree area througout the lake. When the sun did breakout within two hours we were reading surface temps over 63. We caught fish from a very wide range of 10 to 30 feet deep. We spend most of our time hunting big fish so volume wasn't nuts but the size was fantastic. Topped out at 28 this year but we caught lots of 24 - 26 inch very health fish. I took a picture of a 25.5 just becuase it was so over the top fat. This was the earliest I've ever fished LacSeul, I usually go the last week of June but with the early ice out we were fishing all of the same spots I typically do. Walleye's are defininately in transition to summer haunts as was obvious by the number of plus 24"" walleyes we picked up in spots over 20 feet deep. Caught all of mine on jig and minnow. Smallies were just wrapping up on the beds and my guess is they will be gone within the week which is at least two weeks ahead of schedule. Good fishing everyone!"
1200958,Guest,2010-05-16 16:36:00,0,The fish are very scattered. We are catching them from 3 to 25' we have been from deception to birch narrows. It's been the same. Nothing huge but a lot of Nice eaters. Water is a little down. I don't suggest going through the rags. The northerns have been active. Vermilion still had lake trout shallow along with the small mouths. Weather has been great and will be all week
1201030,JDP,2010-05-16 20:28:00,1457,Thanks jabs keep 'em coming!
1201040,rather-be-fishin,2010-05-16 21:11:00,429,"Thanks for the Lac Seul update! It will be an interesting and challenging season of fishing with the record setting ice out and early Spring, so any info will be helpful. 75 days and counting down to the trip to Lac Seul! Rather-be-fishing....on Lac Seul!"
1201091,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-05-17 06:22:00,100,"Yes, fish are scattered, but still plentiful. You can either wait them out at a spot or move to the next. Saw many walleye from 25"" up to 27"" on opening day.The shallow bite, and constant moving, then returning has been working well for me.For the record, we ran the rags wide open for the first time yesterday with an 18' and 50 yamaha, trimmed up. There is about 2.5 feet in there(if you know the exact channnel...). Water is rising daily. Good luck to all Lac seul fisherman this week, the weather is incredible for this time of year!"
1201325,Guest,2010-05-17 18:14:00,0,"Collin your right. Someone else told us that and yet we were able to go through the rags after all. We went to grassy, mcClean narrows and deception and did poor because we kept trolling and couldn't figure the depth. Talking to others they did well because the kept still and found them deeper. Its weird because there are some that are catching fish that still have eggs in them. We think it will Be better this week but we are going to play it safe and go for the current."
1201338,Guest,2010-05-17 18:52:00,0,"The opener out of Sioux Lookout was great. The weather was excellent and for a good part of the day we had the waters pretty much to ourselves. Even Crooked and Manitou were pretty empty when we went through and checked out those areas. Fish were scattered with many locations producing only one or two fish immediately and then nothing. As a result we were running and gunning with a couple of stops producing well enough to warrant an hour or so. Coming back to these stops also worked but fish were moving in and then out a fair bit. Best bites and most active fish were shallow. Lots of nice eaters, some slots and a few overs but nothing above 24 inches. Water is still very cold despite early ice out. Some fish are still in spawn mode. The best advice I could offer is downsize both your jig and minnow size if the bite remains on the slow side. Enjoy!"
1203645,downtown,2010-05-24 20:09:00,3,How much of the stump marker at n. end is showing. [if it hasn't been repaired from last yr.}
1203661,bodon,2010-05-24 20:41:00,2,"Colin is correct. The fish are still mainly close to shore. Fishing towards shore has paid off for myself and guests on Lac Seul. Jigs and jointed shad raps have worked well. The weather is much ahead of normal and the walleye are eagerly taking worms as well, rather early indeed. bodon"
1204011,Knoxabilly,2010-05-25 21:06:00,225,"The weather has been too nice. The fishing a little slower then what I'm used to. Still catching fish 4ft to 10ft in Sawmill Bay. Water is a little low and have not caught any real large walleyes or northerns. Anyone up here right now have any tips where you are catching them? I think some crumby days would go along way right now, not used to this post spawn summer bite thing."
1208579,Guest,2010-06-09 12:39:00,0,Heading up to lac Seul in 1 week. Curious to which bays the walleyes are biting this time of year. Fished this lake alot in Sept but not in June before. Anybody been fishing there lately?
