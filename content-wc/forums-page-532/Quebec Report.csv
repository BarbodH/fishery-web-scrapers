The water was low (2' below norm) and it probably made the daily catches less than normal at that time of year. We went some days with no eye's in the boat but did find the pike on those days. Largest for me was a 4.5lb walleye and a 42"" Northern. Trolled 75% of the time and casted cranks the other 25% Water was 63* when we arrived and low 70*'s when we left. Weather was a mixed bag with one all day rain. Things I learned:1) Canada is Amazing and addicting like you said.2) Guys love a good convoy - dosn't matter if it's trucks pulling boats or boats on the water - it's all good!3) The trip is tough on gear, get the good stuff if you can.4) Don't do ANY boat or trailer repairs, modifications, or additions the week before you go. Have these done ahead of time so they can prove themselves before you head north.5) I took way too much stuff."
