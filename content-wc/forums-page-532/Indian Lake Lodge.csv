1211273,JEREDOG,2010-06-18 09:49:00,21,i have been going to Indian Lake lodge for a numer of years now. its a great place to go and a supreme camp. i can see why jake put this on to tell everyone what a fantastic stay he had at Indian Lake Lodge
1210025,Jake105,2010-06-14 12:52:00,1,"I stayed at Indian Lake Lodge last year. i loved it. derek and cassy made me feel like was at home. i caught a lot of big fish and the dock service was great. derek cleaned all of my fish for me and made my trip even better. since it was my first time on the chain, Derek gave me a few pionters on where to catch fish and that made it even better. i used to go to gulrock but i will never go back. Indian Lake Lodge has better boats, cheaper boat rental better cabins, and cheaper cabin rental."
1210126,Golden Eagle,2010-06-14 18:05:00,2642,"I have not fished either body of water, but I respect those who fish Gullrock Lake and refrain from trashing the other. They seem to be a classy bunch."
1210154,81Saluki,2010-06-14 19:50:00,97,"Hey there Golden Eagle ... Give the newbie a break. Since it sounds like you haven't fished either area, don't discount his experience/opinion. Forums like this are supposed to be a place for people to share their experiences ... both good and bad. Jake's is just one of hundreds of first-hand accounts. Let it speak for itself."
1210160,JEREDOG,2010-06-14 19:59:00,21,I have heard good about both. i love the indian lake chain. you catch a great veriety there which makes it better. Im sure Jake didnt mean to trash gullrock lake. i am sure he has caught great fish at both
1210259,bobbylfishermon,2010-06-15 08:01:00,241,"My wife and I have been at Indian Lake Lodge for 10 years,It's been a great experience with our hosts (Cassy & Derek) and the fishing. Hope to make it another 20 years( I'm 59)!!!!!!!!"
1210314,JEREDOG,2010-06-15 11:23:00,21,good luck in your surgery bobby
1210495,2746,2010-06-15 21:35:00,3206,I agree with Golden Eagle. Jake's first post on this board and it sounds like an ad. Then tops it off with a dig at Gullrock. Pretty tacky!
1210548,81Saluki,2010-06-16 06:09:00,97,"I guess I'm nieve. :-) I took Jake's post at face value, chalking it up to a newbie who wanted to share a good deal when he found it. But I can now see where some people might be skeptical. Oh well. It never hurts to call attention to a possible ""ad"" post."
1210674,JEREDOG,2010-06-16 11:48:00,21,there is 50 other posts just like that. why does everyone have to pick this one to trash??
1210757,MidWestFishman,2010-06-16 14:39:00,44,"I think it is human nature to be skeptical but while the thought went through my mind that it could be promoting a lodge, I also remember having a trip or two where there were some definite shortcomings as well as trips that exceeded my expectations. I tend to assume innocence on the posts and didn't take it as trashing in particular as much as just finding someplace he likes better. I just enjoy the heck out being anywhere in Canada fishing. Even when I was disappointed in things I didn't let it ruin my trip as all my fishing trips have good memories of time spent with family and being able to get out in the great outdoors to enjoy the beauty of the area I was in. I suppose all of us have trips that had ""challenges"" but that is the great thing about Canada. There are so many places to try if you want to and at the end of the day you just can't wait to go fishing again."
