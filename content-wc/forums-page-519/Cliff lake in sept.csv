1227857,Kevin R,2010-08-15 08:06:00,305,"I was just at Cliff for a day it was not what I had hoped for the water was dark in all sections of the Lake that we fished so dark that it was like fishing in mud I had a strike next to the boat & could not see the fish at all just the mouth of the fish at the surface. Fishing was the poorest I have ever had just some Bass & one 36"" pike we did not try trout it was very windy. We saw about twenty different boats on the lake zooming from spot to spot the last time this happened in the 1980'S fishing went down hill fast this lake can't handle that much fishing pressure. I will wait before trying it again & hope the water clears up next week."
1227923,flntknp17,2010-08-15 13:16:00,151,Wow......thats amazing that the water was that dark! I've always thought Cliff had some of the very clearest water I have ever fished......we sight-fished for bass all the time and could watch loons catching baitfish below the boat. Wonder what the deal is? Was it stained (like tanin/bog stain) or was it muddy? Matt
1227942,sidewinder,2010-08-15 15:00:00,96,I actually was there about 11 years ago and had similar experience. We left a day or two early. I realized later that most of my fishing woes were inexperience. Mainly tried fishing like I fished canada in may. Either stubborn or curious but wanting to try it again would like to catch some lakers and nice walleye and occaisional smallie and musky Am I asking for to much. will check into gold arrow also
1227948,Skyraptor,2010-08-15 15:50:00,291,"I know that area has had some good storms and plenty of rain lately. Might make for the muddy water. Have fished Cliff before and even went into Evening, Mystery and Twilight and got walleyes."
1228233,sidewinder,2010-08-16 16:13:00,96,"I stayed there about 11 yrs ago and left two days early. the owners were more like ""tree huggers"" I made many fishing mistakes and maybe stubborn but would like to try it with a little more fishing knowledge. especially for lakers, then walleye then musky"
1226875,sidewinder,2010-08-11 10:27:00,96,"Hi everyone I have not been to canada in several years so I have not been here. Could use some help thinking about going to canada first or second week in sept thinking about cliff lake for several reasons 1. super grand slam walleye,pike, musky,lake trout, and small mouth 2reasonable rates Any supporters or dissenters for cliff lake? I have fished wabby,wine nearby Any advice or suggestions of other nearby camps? taking my fiancee and would like to catch some fish sidewinder"
1226957,Skyraptor,2010-08-11 15:47:00,291,Are you speaking of Lost Bay Resort? Their site looks good but after 2 email inquires and no response I choose a different lodge on a nearby lake. Also read their package details. They only give you the first tank of gas and after that they charge you and who knows what price that will be at a resort.
1226961,sidewinder,2010-08-11 15:51:00,96,thanks skyraptorI believe they said 5.00 per gallonI believe the other camp is closed---also a concern to me
1226968,dcraven,2010-08-11 16:10:00,47,"I just spent a day there - last Thursday, fishing for lakers, mainly with my wife and son. Fishing was pretty good, we boated six fish up to ten pounds. The conditions were very post cold front so we only fished muskies a tiny amount. Looks good, saw no fish in that short period of time. The lake was eerily quiet. We saw two boats in the seven or so hours we were there. One was a little fourteen footer, blue, with two people in it. One was a big red camp-type boat that pulled into a building site on the west/central section of the lake, but that was it. Are the camps operating? It was that quiet...DC"
1227090,sidewinder,2010-08-12 05:53:00,96,so you caught some lakers? how did you fish for them? sidewinder
1227127,dcraven,2010-08-12 07:49:00,47,We caught our fish jigging sonars in about 65 to 90 feet of water. Lots of fish down there.DC
1227220,flntknp17,2010-08-12 12:15:00,151,"Spent a week on Cliff a couple years ago and the fishing was interesting. Very different than what I am used to on Lac Seul and similar lakes. The smallmouth bite was incredible on Cliff........but that was it for us. Few pike, even fewer wallyes, one musky and no lakers (didn't really fish hard for lakers though). The water was unbelieveably clear and this might have contributed to the lack of walleyes biting. I would certainly stop there again (and I might for a couple hours when I go to Ear Falls in three weeks) to fish the smallies, but I am not sure I'd spend a whole week there again.Matt"
1227238,JayM5209,2010-08-12 13:26:00,1050,"Sidewinder, my experience on Cliff is limited to late May or the 1st week in June, but for 32+ years I've fished at least one day, often two, during each of my trips to NW Ontario. I love the lake. Here's some of my experience...Excellent smallmouth fishery, as others have noted.We rarely catch a northern, but we don't fish for them either so count it a blessing not to see them very often!There are some nice muskies in Cliff. We frequently get one or two in a day of trolling for lakers. Each of the last three years I've caught a 44""+ musky while lake trout fishing. I hope someone who has stayed in one of the camps on Cliff and done a lot of walleye fishing responds to your questions. We've spent very little time fishing specifically for walleyes, but have caught them while looking for lakers. The ones we have gotten in Cliff have been very nice walleyes. Both my son and one of my regular boat partners have their best ever walleyes from Cliff.Lake trout are why I go to Cliff. In the early season when we go, we troll Rapalas (black/silver CDs or large Shad Raps) in shallow water, 6-30 feet. The one time I've been there later in the year was mid-August last year. There were lots of lakers on the bottom in 70-90 FOW with even more holding about half way down. The only way to get those is jigging, but unfortunately there was too much wind that day to hold the boat over them.As you probably know, lakers are Fall spawners, so at some point they start to move shallow again when they'd be vulnerable to long line trolling. Don't know if you'll be too early for that or not, probably depends on when the water temps drop enough. Also, the laker season ends Sept. 30, but you;ll be there and gone by then.I do have a camp suggestion for you. Gold Arrow Camp on Jackfish Lake is just north of Cliff, about half way between Cliff and Perrault Falls. I've been going there every year since 1977. New owners took over this year, and Todd and Renee will take good care of you. They have boats on 12 or 14 lakes in the area, so you can fish a different lake every day if you want. Gold Arrow does have boats on Cliff, so you could spend as many days as desired there. You can check them out at http://www.fishandhuntontario.com/ . There are lots of very good camps in the area that others could recommend, I just happen to know Gold Arrow, and returning for as many years as our group has says something about the quality of our experiences.Have a great trip."
1227409,Silverwiskers,2010-08-13 08:01:00,5,"Just got back from Cliff Lake , (1st week in Aug). Have fished this lake many times, have been going there from the early 90's. The smallmouth are every where, have caught northern and musky, but mainly go after the walleye. Never tryed for lakers. This year we could not find any small walleye on Cliff , the smallest was 24"". Lots of walleye , just not ones we want to kill and eat. We went up stream to Evening Lake to catch our eaters. It is a neat ride to Evening Lake and the wife enjoys the veiw going between the lakes. The new owners of Lost Bay also own Wildeyes out post and has just bought Sharps as well. He now owns all lodges on Cliff Lake. They are building a new building ay Wildeyes and John ( worker for the owners) is very busy working on the new building. The price of gas was $5 and we used $120 in the week( 2 boats ). They are trying to improve the camps , so every one is busy( maybe too busy ). Still a great place to fish where you can go after whatever you want. The rates are reasonable and the cabins are in good condition. Thier boats and motors were dry and ran well. Jan and John will take care of you. I plan on giong back next year to to a bear hunt and let the wife fish. If she is good I'll let her drag my bear out and skin it for me."
1227464,bluefin85,2010-08-13 11:33:00,31,This is what happened to us about 10 yaers ago. The owner was no help at all. He wanted his money right away and that was it no help at fishing the 3 lakes from camp. Would not even show us on a map where to fish and the skunk under the cabin well no help there at aLL. We had our kids with us and the cabins only had lanterns no power. Have never been treated that bad any where in Canada. Mybe they have new owners by now and the resort is a great place to go.
