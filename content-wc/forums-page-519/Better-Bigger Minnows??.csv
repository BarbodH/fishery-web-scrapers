1227994,Skiball,2010-08-15 18:44:00,82,"You're welcome. If you buy live, we found that using two 5 gal buckets with holes work if left in the lake. We got 6 days out of our minnows before we used them all. Otherwise, the 5 gal aerated buckets will work and they're only around $50.Happy fishing.Mike"
1228398,Hawkfan,2010-08-17 09:21:00,237,Is that the place right on the water on the left side of the road as you are driving into town?
1227401,MorganMan,2010-08-13 07:38:00,341,"We drive from Fort Frances to Sioux Lookout before flying out to our camp. We have had much better luck with minnows than with crawlers or leeches, but have found some years that the minnows are so small. Normally our outfitter has them for us when we get there, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of a bait shop along the way that may have a meatier minnow or if certain kinds of minnows are better than others?"
1227406,Jimmy Jig,2010-08-13 07:56:00,1905,"The best minnows I have found is Dace. Some have a red stripe on the sides, some have a yellow stripe. This are the hardyest ones I have seen. They are getting harder to get now days but they are out there. I get mine from the camp we stay at, Frog Rapids Camp about 6 miles South of Sioux Lookout by the bridge. I think they are about $4.00 per dozen......"
1227428,IaDave,2010-08-13 09:07:00,476,They are on the left hand side a few miles before you get to Sioux Lookout.
1227530,5richards,2010-08-13 16:09:00,131,I suggest that you preserve your own -- did it for the first time this year and they were outstanding --- probably weighed @a pound for about 18 dozen
1227603,SinOrSwim,2010-08-14 00:10:00,1528,I've always had the best luck with the Northern Red Belly Dace.
1227680,MorganMan,2010-08-14 09:42:00,341,5richards........Is there any issue at the border with bringing in your own preserved minnows? Do you preserve them with salt?
1227687,Skiball,2010-08-14 10:09:00,82,"Morgan:There is a shop on Rte.72 by Anderson's Lodge as you are coming into Sioux Lookout. J & D Bait 807-737-2980. ( Joe & Debbie )Probably the best minnows I've seen in the 18 yrs we have fished Lac Seul. The sign is small and you can drive right by it. They put the minnows in containers with air to keep them alive for an add'l 24 hrs and you can choose from small, blend or large minnows. The price is reasonable.Hope this helps.Mike"
1227848,5richards,2010-08-15 07:52:00,131,Morganman -- sent you a pm -- no problem taking salted minnows across border
1227858,Golden Eagle,2010-08-15 08:08:00,2642,I have a fresh batch of salted minnows in my freezer. Need to put some of them to use before freeze up. The rest will save until next May.
1227938,MorganMan,2010-08-15 14:56:00,341,"Thanks for the info fellas, I will check em out. I'm definitely going to try preserving my own too."
