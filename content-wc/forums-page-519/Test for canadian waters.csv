If you live in USA & are bringing a private boat, you need to take the test only if your going to be in CANADA FOR 45 DAYS. If you are using a resort boat, the resort owner should review a safety list with you and have you sign a form & carry it with you that that will qualify, so then you don't need to take the test. Happy fishing!"
