Athapap looks huge and maybe hard to fish compared to Tramping. First time not going on a fly out so I am used to numbers and not hogs. Will just be 2 of us. Is a guide needed on Athapap?"
1228035,Larry S,2010-08-15 20:51:00,666,nontypicalrack go to www.xtremesportfishing.com this is a manitoba website and you will be able to talk to anglers who fish the lakes your going to and give you all the information you will need
1228038,Bigfishhunter,2010-08-15 20:54:00,803,"no doubt about it, Tramping is the better lake for eyes. It is an eye lake first and foremost with trout in it. Athapap is a trout lake with eyes in it, and the eye fishing is a bit on the slow side. Actually that whole Grass River System has what you want. Check out Wekusko too for eyes, as they are starting to really come on again in that lake."
