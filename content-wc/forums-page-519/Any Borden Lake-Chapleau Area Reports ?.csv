1227911,jaggersr,2010-08-15 12:14:00,44,"My son and I I just got back yesterday after spending a 9 days fishing in the Chapleau area. Walleye fishing was very good as was the Northern's. However the smallmouth action was phanominal. Caught walleye on jig/twister tail tipped with crawlers and bottom bouncers and worm harnesses. Smallmouth was rapalas, thundersticks and tube jigs. Picked up walleye on the same while fishing for smallmouth. Walleye were in 13 to 20' of water. Smallmouth were the same but were in 2 to 6' in early morning or late evening. Target structure and contour changes and you should find fish. This was my second week long trip this year and my wife and I will be going back in 3 weeks for another week. You will love the area. I just wish I lived closer than 750 miles away."
1227914,Golden Eagle,2010-08-15 12:38:00,2642,"jaggersr, did you fish Windermere? I fished the Chapleau area a lot between 1959 and 1971, but have been going to NW Ontario since then. My wife and I need another trip to the area and Windermere seems to be worth a try. We'd need a trip into town to see how much it's changed in the last 40 years."
1227915,polaris-pete,2010-08-15 12:39:00,343,Jagger- good to hear you and your Wife had a great trip. Where did you stay and how were things?
1227917,Wall_Eye,2010-08-15 12:46:00,28,"Thanks jag for the report that sounds fantastic.Excitement level went up another notch.I will have to wait till next year to take the wife we are 1600 miles away.Any info on were you stayed would be appreciated.Thanks from ""The Okie"""
1227919,jaggersr,2010-08-15 12:56:00,44,"Yes, we fished Windermere at Happy Day Lodge. My June trip was my first time there. We obviously like it as I am going back for my 3rd trip this year in a few weeks. I usually fish in more primitive conditions but I will say it has been nice this year for a change. In June we stayed in thier accomidations. Last week and in Sept we are staying in our cab over truck camper in their limited camping area as they had no cabins available. The Zimmermans have a nice affordable camp on an excellent fishery. I actually will have spent less on going the 750 miles for 3 times this year than most will spend on a single fly-in for two . I would also bet I have caught as many fish as some of those high dollar fly-ins as well. I just wish I had more than 3 weeks vacation ."
