1214835,bassface44,2010-06-30 09:43:00,96,"Typically we will give a place a second chance if the fishing was less than expected only if there were some obvious extenuating circumstances, like thunderstorms prevented fishing for long portions of a trip. We primarily have taken fly-in trips so amenities are few and far between to begin with but if the camps or boats are in rough shape we move on. We will also move if the lake gets a bit boring. Some of the fly-ins we have been on have been to smaller lakes were there are only a few spots that hold fish. If we are basically doing circles around the lake to five or six spots it gets old after a while and we go somewhere else. Even if the fishing has been great."
1214839,Skiuseme,2010-06-30 09:55:00,5,"I have the same problem that Kruger has I love the place I go. As Far as service. I guess I look at the total amount of dollars spent and what the true value was for the money if it is not worth it dont go. If it is send a note that describes the items that were faulty to see if they will remedy. If not Ive got a great place to send you.Last time I went fishing in Sioux Lookout we had a great time. The resort was great but, the fishing was slow. It was an off year and you could really tell that the was at his wits end trying to put us on fish. The spring was late, and there were a few things that were working against us. He was truely giving all that he could to make sure our vacation was great!! And it was!!The monies that we spent was well worth the trip that we had. We are returning there in less than a month. I look at the whole experience and let that determine if I go back or not. Rudeness I will not tolerate but, cold soup, so so fishing and other minor things nah, Ill give it another shot."
1214844,stumcfar,2010-06-30 10:07:00,451,"We typically do not stay for full weeks, so it limits where and when we can take our annual trip. We have stayed at numerous camps over the years and for the most part have had great experiences. Most owners treat us well and appreciate that we are able to fill a partial week that otherwise would have gone unfilled. Only one camp treated us as if we had the plague, they spoke to us when we arrived to check in, had no fishing advice for us, never spoke to us the 4 days we were there and were rude when we left, needless to say they didn't need our business and we haven't been back. We stayed at another camp and the one day we were out fishing a large thunderstorm rolled in. We were able to hide behind an old cabin on an island, but when we returned to camp, a window had blown out in our cabin and part of the cabin had sticks, leaves and water on the floor. I went to the main office to report this. The person ruuning the show was sitting in a chair and when I mentioned what had happened, she went into the backroom and brought me a mop and a broom and said here you go. I was a bit suprised she didn't offer to help or even look at the mess. The next day our fridge quit working, which can happen, there was no offer to try fix it or offer an alternative for our stuff. That is the only trip where we left early and have never ventured back. The other 17 years, have been great and we have met numerous wonderful hosts that we hope to cross paths with again."
1214859,wallydave,2010-06-30 10:38:00,2151,"When we going up north to fish we plan and hope for a great week of fishing. There are things like the weather, water levels, that no resort owner can control. Operators can keep the cabins, docks and boats in good order, and we pay for those services. If your owner is not keeping up their part of the contract, then it is time to take your business to a place that will honor part of the contract. I have great fishing, and spotty fishing on Lac Seul, I like staying at Goose Bay mainly because Andrea, makes an effort to provide the best fishing for our group. I'm sure other camps and lodges do the same, some better than others. When you find a good camp, reward them with your business! They will get the message!"
1214883,Mark R,2010-06-30 12:15:00,1538,"Sometime you don't even need to go once. I recall calling and asking about a bring your own boat discount at a camp and was told, ""don't come here"" actually it was good advice cause we found Evergreen Lodge and have been going there evry year for about the last 12 years or so. Fishing is usually good but we keep coming back because of Pat & Gary and their good cabins and great boats & motors and other facilties."

1215156,fourize,2010-07-01 09:39:00,287,"My Dad and I have been going to the same lodge for the last 18 years...this september will be our 19th year. We keep going back year after year, because the lodge owners and other repeat guests, have become OUR family. It is more than a stringer full of fish. We have experianced ups...attended their sons wedding 2 years ago...and downs...owners are in the process of getting a divorce. It has become more then the fishing for us. They have become such true friends and our Canadian family. To give you an example of how these folks are, my Dad is 80 years old and on a limited income. A few years ago, he came to the conclusion that our annual trips to Lost Lake Wilderness Lodge would be coming to an end, simply because of financial reasons. It was devestating to me at first also because going on a fishing trip to Canada every year with my Dad, was the highlite of my year since we started going. I soon realized that all good things must come to an end and accepted it. Well, that spring we went to the annual sportsmans show to visit our friend Ed, to tell him the bad news that we were no longer coming. His reply emmediately was ""it would not be the same at Lost Lake if you guys did not show up' He then told us something that i'm still shocked today. ""Martin on behalf of Judy and I, you are getting a FREE pass to Lost Lake for the rest of your life"" He took a piece of paper and wrote ""free pass to Lost Lake for Martin""...LOL! He said that is for 1 week, 2 weeks a month...whatever for the rest of your life. That right there cemented a freindship that will last forever. But the sad part to the whole story is the lodge is up for sale because of the divorce, but my Dad and I will keep going back to spend time with our Canadian family until the end...whenever that may be. 64 more days!!!!!!!"
1215169,labsrus,2010-07-01 10:27:00,557,"Here are my thoughts We picked an outfitter for a flyin based on references and talking to them at one of the outdoor shows. We went in 2001 to one of the lakes they had. Good experience and everything worked fine good boats and motors. Cabin was nice. in 2004 we rebooked with same outfitter and tried a different lake. Good experence again, really nice cabin, fishing was a little tougher but we caught fish. In 2009, we went to the same lake as 2001, cabin was a mess, door would not stay closed in the wind we had a few days. Boats leaked and we had a lot of motor problems. On the transport in , they dropped us off early and promised to bring in the next load of gear soon. Problem was most of our fishing stuff was left on the dock and did nto arrive until late in the day around dinner time. We are looking to book a trip in 2010. We will talk this weekend to see if we rebook with same outfitter or look for another."
1218677,adempsey,2010-07-13 13:46:00,963,"We go for a week each year and usually go American plan. I am still searching for that perfect place, but a couple of places I won't return because:1) Owner really took advantage of the staff. They were all young teenagers and you could tell they weren't happy. They never smiled, never really joked around, nothing. I also learned that any tip given was put into a bank account (supposedly controlled by the staff and not the owner) and divided up at the end of the season. If you left early, too bad, you got nothing. This bothered me enough that I wouldn't return even though the service and everything else was pretty good. It's also $300 pp cheaper than very similar places on the lake, but I still wouldn't go back. 2) Owners were not around at all. I think I spoke with them for a total of 10 minutes (5 minutes the day we flew in, 5 minutes the day we flew out). Food was quite mediocre - especially for the price. Cottage wasn't quite ready and wasn't in the best of shape either. After we arrived I felt like ""ok, there is your cottage, there is your boat, have fun!!"" - and that was the end of it. Perhaps that's a good thing, I don't really know, but I prefer a little more interaction. Not much help with fishing information either, since most didn't really fish the lake. Again, service from the staff was great, the kids were really nice and did a good job...but, again, I just didn't enjoy myself. Regardless, for me, I think I'll have a hard to returning to anywhere since there are so many lakes I'd like to visit. I often return to the same places for day and weekend trips, but for my week long trips I truly prefer to move around. Perhaps someday I will find the perfect place and that will change."
1218760,Northpoint,2010-07-13 18:06:00,38,"Bad customer service is the kiss of death for a resort. Things like not returning phone calls and emails timely, and no curtains in bath rooms are bad. The resort that we went to had a long road full of potholes that was hard on cars. Maybe I expect too much......but when I pay good money and tip well I expect alot."

You know the cook quit, the plane broke down and the water pump works sometimes. I like my camp, I like to cook, I like the fishermen, this is a good life......but nothing is perfect. **** happens. After many years of the great customers, I see that you are very understanding and it is Attitude and Atmosphere that Count . When the dessert gets dropped on the floor, the cook has to laugh....what the heck...canned peaches tonight. Fishermen don't come north for a hassell, they want to fish, laugh and relax."
1219194,Larry Mac,2010-07-14 18:49:00,530,"Elizabeth, I am glad that you do (as an operator) read and participate on WC. It is a fantastic site with very reputable North Fishermen who are very experienced, honest and take many, many trips into the Canadian Wilderness. There are a few other very good lodge owners that also participate and listen to what is said here. Your lodge (which you were polite enough not to even mention) has a wonderful reputation. I have spoken and met with both Hugh and Enid and they have been nothing but helpful and honest. So I will mention you lodge and hope to someday fish with Viking Outposts in the very near future. Thank you for all your help and have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1219225,rangerdug,2010-07-14 20:30:00,4,"Whether I spend $15 or $1500 during my trip, I always remember the customer service. If my money means nothing to the business, it usually shows and I won't be back. Give me a smile and a thank-you (with a decent product!) and I'll be back."
1219283,Pooch,2010-07-15 06:51:00,4619,"Keeping our group happy is pretty easy, but there are a few things that will drive us away. We did leave a good lake because of the management one time only. This is what we look for.#1 We don't want to walk into a dirty cabin and spend the first morning cleaning because of the last group or owners not doing a decent clean up job. We don't expect a spit shine, but dirty floors, tables, fridge and cooking equipment doesn't cut it.#2 If it's advertised as having everything needed for house keeping then it should have everything needed. Otherwise let us know and we will bring in our own food preparation hardware. Not a big deal as long as we are aware that we need to.#3 A reliable boat and motor with seats that is fairly clean is a must and has only been a problem once in over forty trips. Give us a boat with a decent prop and at the end of the week we will give you back the same or pay you for anything we may have damaged.#4 We just want to be treated fairly. We don't need our ego's stroked or our butt to be kissed. If we are doing something the owners doesn't appreciate tell us. We probably are not aware of it. Different camps have different etiquette.#5 Most of our guys are self employed and are keenly aware of many of the problems encountered with running a camp. So everyone gets a little slack.#6 Most folks going into a camp are really nice people just looking for a week or two of peace and quiet while trying to be low maintenance and low profile while in camp. Then again there are the narcissistic jerks that we all have to deal with from time to time. Don't let them sour your attitude towards the rest of the good customers. Most of us appreciate the work it takes to run a good camp.Pooch"
1219329,v-bay gord,2010-07-15 09:10:00,3168,"Thank you Pooch for adding a bit of the perspective that we, as camp owners, must deal with. Anyone who has been in the business for a few years and survived has adapted to accepting the good people (the majority) and the bad (the minority). It's too bad though that the ""narcissistic jerks"" seem to be the most vocal. Enid makes a good point.......""nothing is perfect""......and a lot has to do with attitude and atmosphere."
1219332,stardaddyed,2010-07-15 09:14:00,20,"I am going to Canada for the first time in about three weeks. I am not a ""big time"" fisherman and have never fished for the northern species. I am going with my family and we are viewing this as a vacation that we will do some fishing on. I started planning for the trip last fall and I can tell you this was no easy process. There are thousands of lodges with millions of options; fly-in, boat-in, drive-in, American, housekeeping, modified American..... It was hard to choose. We did all the normal homework (web, All Canada Show, recommendations, references).Once you choose what kind, you have to choose a lodge. The biggest problem we had was that everyone has an opinion. We never found a lodge that didn't have someone come out of the wood work to say something bad about it. As a newbie that is daunting. We had one place that I had 10 people tell me it was the best place ever and 10 tell me it was a waste of money, and like you guys said we weren't talking about the fishing so much but about the service. There is also huge price differences. I selected three similar places and got bids. They were all hungry for our business and didn't mind getting into a competitive situation. I wasn't playing them so much as they kept saying they would bet any other offer. If finally stopped when one of them went for the nuclear option with a price that was 60% less then the others. 60%! That made me nervous and we went with the middle bidder. In the end we had to go with a gut feel. And while, based on size the gut should be great, I would have rather been able to make a decision on a little more info.Now with three weeks to go I am getting nervous that the choice was a bad one....not that there is any evidence. It is just that I am excited and want the trip to be a good one."
1221929,GOBIG,2010-07-23 19:34:00,126,"lARRYM, YOU ARE RIGHT. LET IT GO, I AM NOT GOING BACK SO THE HECK WITH IT. KEEP THE GOOD AND BAD REPORTS FLOWING IN.

1222029,Guest,2010-07-24 10:56:00,0,"For me and my family it comes down to value. Is the experience equal to the money spent...value for us...and do we feel valued by the owners/operators of the camp! Being ""valued"" by the operators is defined by clean, well kept and timely renovations of camp, cabins, boats and motors. Being and feeling welcomed by the camp operators. The operators ""being there"" for the guest...lake maps, tours, mid-week checks. Fishing??? Most of the lakes cited on this site have very similiar populations of game fish. As long as the operator assists me with hotspots, cyclical patterns and reasonable bait prices...the rest is up to us. $100.00 to one person is $1000.00 to another and $10,000.00 to a third, but value is universal."
1228176,octanehi5,2010-08-16 13:25:00,1104,"If the place you go to doesn't meet your expectations,in what ever service,cabin,boats, fishing, comfort.or all of them then its time to not go back, I have had an experiance in the north to go to a great place one of the best cabins I have ever stayed at everything worked great, the fishing sucked. We only caught enough walleye for one shore lunch in a week,Desided to go back to this lake the next yr. it was the same as it was the last yr. knowing what I know now,the first time that happens I'm outa there. If the outfitter offered me a free trip I would not waste my time. Always ask for an outfitters refurances, talk to the people that go there. ask on walleye central get someones e-mail,I would refure anyone to my outfitter I feel he has the most to offer at a good price. I hope this helps"

1228667,wallydave,2010-08-18 07:41:00,2151,"Fisherman Ted, I bet many of us have had the thought go through our minds of owning a camp that we have fished out of. After being on the guests side for so long, I'm sure the ""warm fuzzy"" ownership idea has matured. Where is the camp you are buying? It would be nice to know in planning furure trips. Good luck in following your dream!"
1221727,GOBIG,2010-07-23 05:14:00,126,"I started this thread and think it is one of the most informative as of late. I really think that a camp should give what they offer. I have been to some that offer 4 walls, stove, fridge, and hot water, I have been to some that say they offer wifi internet, luxury cabins, great food, and many other fine things. However, I am going to stick with fly in from now on, that way I am not disappointed with anything. The fishing and boat will speak for the camp in my eyes. YOU advertise big fish, tons of fish you better have it. It is all about the customer... When more than two or three customers are complaining about the same crap, there is more than likely some truth to that crap,,FIX IT. Once again I can go on and on, this is why I read WC. Honest opinions from all."
1221746,Blue Lk,2010-07-23 06:44:00,269,"GOBIG,having read all your posts,you strike me as a very negitive person.I do not own a resort or have any tourist related income,but I have lived in NWO my entire life.I have seen 1000's of American tourist over the years.Most are wonderfull people,however there are that very small percentage that are never happy,complain about everything,gas prices,exchange rates,bait prices,bad fishing etc etc.I believe you are 1 of these few.Have you never had good time in our country?This forum is full of praise from our American brothers & we are more than happy to share our wonderfull resources with them.Maybe you should consider staying home."

The camp was just plain bad. Notice, I never mentioned the camp name, nor will I. If I had been on WC long before I went I believe the good hearted folks that give true honest opinions would have saved me a very bad experience. This is a public forum, people should be able to say the truth, and be honest about experiences. I for one will never be a great fisherman, or even a good one. But what I will be is someone like most, who enjoy the finer things in life such as Canadian fishing. I will continue to go North, and will pay closer attention to detail when it comes to planning a trip with hard earned money. So, if you or anyone else feels negative vibes from my posts, please forgive me now. When something is said to be there it should, I believe most fellow anglers would agree....."
1221757,doubleheader,2010-07-23 07:19:00,2652,"GOBIG, your post was reasonable and resulted in a lot of good feedback. I certainly didn't read into it any negative vibes. We just came back from our 2 wk trip, new lodge same lake. We are very satisffied with our experience and our accomodations. Fishing was not as good as past years but that's fishing. The owners made us feel right at home. We're already booked for next year."
1221762,GOBIG,2010-07-23 07:27:00,126,"Double, your response is why i read this forum. You had a good time, tell us about it, you rebooked , great for you and the owner. I am sure they appreciate it..."
1221783,doubleheader,2010-07-23 08:39:00,2652,"GOBIG, a couple examples. first, our cottage was essentially boat acccess, although there was a 1/4 mile walk around, for moving in purposes it was boat access. The owners helped us get settled, we tipped them, but that was our choice. They carried almost everything. The water was down 2+ feet, they fixed up our dock immediately so our boats were secure, safe, and accessible. They arranged for electricity to our dock. Our cabin was spotless, our beds were reasonably comfortable (all I ask), we had a fabulous dinner at the lodge one evening, they picked up garbage daily as promised, they were always willing to take a minute to talk about whatever. I'm sensitive to their busy schedules so I didn't want to waste their time, but I could tell they enjoy getting to know their customers and making sure the customers are satisfied. One person in our party needed to make arrangements to get some unexpected meds, they were helpful getting those to him. In short they did all I could ask and they did it with a smile. Additionally we found this cabin to be well suited for us because we had our own dock and considerable space between cabins. We could let our dogs off leash without bothering anyone."
1221817,jigman 2003,2010-07-23 10:34:00,981,"Wow - I've not heard of places bidding for customers. Perhaps its a common practice, but I've never heard of it in over 15 years of Canadian fishing. My first instinct would have been to run away from anyone who does, but wtf do I know. Hope your trip is great and you go back next year."
1221843,teddi,2010-07-23 12:01:00,349,"the past couple of years bidding for cutomers[deal making] is more commen. things are tough so price cutting,bs,and out right lying are more commen now. it,s hard enough to get people up to canada without bad operators screwing around."
1221862,2746,2010-07-23 13:27:00,3206,"I would agree. GOBIG, all your posts are located in this and the Angler Kingdom thread and you are clearly inhappy about something. At some point it's better to chalk it up to experience and get on with life. Even the worst fishing trip has something positive about it!"
1221887,Stu,2010-07-23 15:59:00,472,"Bidding is certainly new to me. I'm not sure I would like it. It reminds me of trying to buy a car. I go to Ontario every other year and just completed my 8th trip. I have only had one bad experience with a camp owner and vowed never to return. After I left I discovered the camp was for sale and everything became clear. He knew he wouldn't be back and man did he show it! We gave the new owners a shot and things are great. The best news is, I can now go back every year (cause my wife said so)!"
1219346,tv4fish,2010-07-15 09:43:00,2694,"Well Ed -- I have to admit yours is/was an interesting way (getting ""bids"") of selecting a camp !!?? - Obviously, it is now probably ""too late"" to change camps, as I would assume you have paid a deposit. My advice - try to relax and enjoy the experience - IF the camp that you chose doesn't meet your expectations - I would politely remind them that you HAD choices and if they don't provide what you expected (or what they promised) - you won't be back. And -- do that immediately and not on your last day."
1219420,stardaddyed,2010-07-15 13:15:00,20,"Maybe I stated that incorrectly. We narrowed the choice down to three. They all looked good on paper, the references all checked out, the equipment and accommodations were all the same. The fishing was also a wash to the untrained eye. So I just asked three places for pricing and they all said before I choose let them know what others had priced at."
1215197,Fishing Traveler,2010-07-01 12:06:00,19,I spend a lot of time on forums and this is one of the most interesting threads in awhile.
1215242,GOBIG,2010-07-01 14:51:00,126,"I wondered how it would go over. I have recently went to a camp and was overly disappointed. When things look like a million bucks and are not it sucks. I can take a bad week of fishing, i am not at work.."
1215245,515,2010-07-01 14:56:00,254,Once for our group. If it was something beyond their control then they will for sure get another chance but something they can control and not bother doing where out.
1215253,TheDFP,2010-07-01 15:26:00,39,"I look at it this way. There are things the outfitter can control and there is things outside of their control. Cabin, boat, motor, hospitality, cleanliness..... are all within the outfitters control. Weather, fish biting, bugs, water level and other acts of nature are beyond the outfitters control. If the outfitter does not live up to things they can control, we don't go back. If the fishing is bad two years in a row, we also don't go back. There are a lot of good places out there and there are bad places out there. Spend some time and do your homework. Sites like this can help out."
1215259,micropterus,2010-07-01 15:54:00,450,............ and the wisdom to know the difference.
1215517,fourize,2010-07-02 18:33:00,287,"Exactly Larry! The same thing happened to my Dad and I. Our first year there was horrible. You can't judge the fishing at a particular place after one week of fishing, and that is what I told my Dad. We have been catching more and bigger fish consistently ever since that first year. We now know ""the spots"". We see people come up for the very first time and go though the same learning curve we went through. That is another reason why we stay at one lodge. If we decided to move to another lodge and lake, we would have to start all over again."
1218376,Walley Guide,2010-07-12 16:04:00,67,"It was a simple switch...... *When the owners cared more about my money than my family. *When the owners didn't respect any sort of quiet time in the morning...waking up to a 4 wheeler being driven up and down the cabin roads is not how I care to start the morning. *When the owners spend multiple days out fishing through out the day...makes it tough to find anyone to help out when a problem arises around the camp. *When the owners preach following ""their"" regulations on catch and release, yet they fail to follow the law themselves. *When a family atmosphere turns into a pay now, see ya later attitude. Catching better fish since the switch...guess that's worth something as well. Happy Fishin' Walley"
1218458,Rich B,2010-07-12 20:40:00,1081,"Great to read these prior posts.....going up north since the mid-80s and my vacation time is too precious to waste on a camp or lodge owner that doesn't know the meaning of ""service"". As an earlier post correctly noted, what is in the control of the camp owner and what is out of their control.....it makes all the difference in their attitude and willingness to provide service. I am in a service industry (as well as my wife) and we reward great service, and don't return when it's not delivered. I too had a great camp that I loved since they opened (Camp Kuha) though unfortunately the owners sold to private owners way too soon (for me anyway - ha) and it hasn't been the same at any other camp.

If you're looking for great cabins, excellent service, a very decent price and good fishing in that part of Canada, check out the Red Pine Lodge. Yes, the camp has gone through a few changes of ownership/managers in that period of time, but we still go back every year. We reserve the same week for the following year when we check out. Obviously, the economy has hurt tourism in that area, but this camp appreciates our business and provides great service. Oh - What does anyone else think of their new ""harmonized"" tax??? Sometimes I think Canada is ""trying"" to prevent us from going up there!!"
1218648,ek2008,2010-07-13 12:24:00,7,"Similar to previous posts - what kept us from returning to our previous camp was; 1) lodge not ready for us - not cleaned properly and 2) hosts not around/available or willing to jump at an opportunity to fix a concern. I spend $1000 for the week to cover lodging, supermarket groceries and real expensvive Canadian beer. I drag my own boat and get my own bait. Don't get me going on that HST!! Being from Ontario I can say we truly feel hosed by this one. I have family in Maine, Michigan and NY and I love visiting the states esp for cheaper gas, cheaper beer, cheaper clothes). Gas jumped up about 3 cents a litre or 10-12 cents a gallon for you guys as of July 1st. Here's a link of what has changed and not changed as of July 1st. http://hstontario.com/hst-ontario/hst-changes-list/"
1215172,Larry Mac,2010-07-01 10:43:00,530,"Hi Fourize, What a great story and I do agree sincere relationships do develop. I went to a new camp for the first time many years ago with my son and two friends. It was our second trip to Canada and we fished for a week. The fishing was awful and I swore to never go back. Well luckily I did give the camp another opportunity and thank goodness because it has become our favorite walleye destination to date. In retrospect it was not the camp, or the quality of the fishery, or even the time of year, it was the total inexperience of the fisherman (Us LOL). We did not have a clue what we were doing, no electronics, the wrong equipment, no clue on the ways of the walleye and even the wrong bait. I do agree with the above statement in the separation of fishery and owners/facilities. If you do your homework on the fishery it will take care of itself. The owners, workers and camp facilities are a different story. We have been blessed with great experiences at several different camps. Have a great season.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1214750,GOBIG,2010-06-30 05:39:00,126,"At what point do you not go back to an outfitter? Taking into account, fishing, cabins, service, and boats. Do you go one time and stop, or give a second or third chance?"
1214766,eye-hunter,2010-06-30 06:35:00,435,"When I'm spending my hard earned cash on anything in life, there are very rarely second chances if I wasn't happy the first time. Life is short, and cash is not an unlimited resource."
1214798,Fishing Traveler,2010-06-30 07:57:00,19,"For the most part, it is one time and out for me if it is an issue with the outfitter itself. If it is an issue with the fishing, I may give it a second try if my experience seems to be different than others. I know others will stick with outfitters for years regardless of the fishing. For me, there are just too many great places to check out and not enough time in life. Chris"
1214802,Obabikon,2010-06-30 08:03:00,2370,"I'm in agreement. If the experience was not what you are looking for, move on. Anytime someone takes a vacation that should be the case. You work hard all year for this experience... it should be what you're looking for."
1214808,Kruger,2010-06-30 08:24:00,259,I kind of have the opposite problem. I read about all these great places. But I can't seem to take a chance and stop going to place that is near perfect for us.
1214809,PIKEMAN330,2010-06-30 08:25:00,101,"I don't return if the fishing is poor,or if the camp is not clean.Thinking back I have found really bad fishing eight or nine times and smelly cabin once.I have left camps before the week was up a couple of times."
1214823,GOBIG,2010-06-30 09:04:00,126,"That is what I have come across a few times. Smelly cabins, no water, bad boats. The funny thing is either the camp owners are blind, or the references they give me are getting discounts. I do not go on the camp owners word anymore. Some big named places leave a lot to be desired. To top it off, when you leave a camp early should tell the owner something is wrong..."
1214825,Golden Eagle,2010-06-30 09:18:00,2642,"I've fished with some people who have a great experience every time and others who always have a less than good trip every time. To one person it's been a great week, but to another it's been terrible."
1214829,Fishing Traveler,2010-06-30 09:29:00,19,"Leaky boats are one thing that I am picky about and won't give much of a second chance over. Have not had too much problems with main lake boats, but I love fishing a camp's remote or portage lakes. Something neat about being on a small lake that few people fish. But I don't enjoy it nearly as much when I am doing as much bailing as I am fishing. I understand the challenges of keeping portage boats from not leaking due to treatment by other fishermen. But especially when the lake is not far from camp, it would be nice if the camp would keep these boats in decent shape. Chris"
1214833,doubleheader,2010-06-30 09:42:00,2652,"After many many years we moved this year down the lake a few miles to a different lodge. It was difficult, but our perception was that the owner didn't value our businesss. Just one example. For more than 2 years I had told them our matress was horrible, but it wasn't replaced. I can appreciate that camp owners have a lot to do and have limited resources, but those kinds of things along with a general feeling we got that we simply weren't valued finally forced our hand. We were good customers. We stayed 2 weeks every year, we didn't cause any commotion, we didn't complain, and we spent quite a bit of money. I thought sure they would have sent us an e-mail asking us if something was wrong, but we haven't heard a thing from them. That just reinforces our belief we made the right decision."
