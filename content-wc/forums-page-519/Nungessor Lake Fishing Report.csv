I have been fishing on this lake since 1989, my Dad since 72. We had a tremendous week of fishing catching more than 100 walleye per boat every day. We caught lots of 15-17 inch walleyes with several in the 22-27 inch range. The northerns were biting on the walleyes when we were bringing them in and we did manage to also catch some on quick strike rigs. We had 10 kids in our party so it was great that the weather and the fish were cooperating. For the past five years we have been staying at Anglers Kingdom. The camp is great with very helpful staff, equipment and food. This was one of the best trips we have had in the past several years. Nice part about this lake is that it is so loaded with walleyes that unless they have lockjaw or you a total ""pud"" fisherman it is easy to catch nice fish. In the 20 years I have been going there the fishing just seems to be getting better. Nice to have the addition of Anglers Kingdom to the lake to have a premier camp to stay at."

Kevin always marks the current fishing spots on the map. If you fish where he tells you to you will catch fish and many times lots of fish. Period. The cabins are nice and the food is excellent. Hard to find a better camp. Planning on returning again next year. Started fishing canada in 1969. Have yet to find a better walleye lake."
