1213728,Obabikon,2010-06-26 16:07:00,2370,"That's one of the perks to working out here. I try to give him his evenings off and a boat to go fishing. But, to say that he didn't brag about the fish to all the guides wouldn't be the truth."
1227020,1shooter,2010-08-11 19:35:00,1493,"Obabikon, your kind of slacking here.....no update or are all the fish gone from LOTW?"
1227816,Obabikon,2010-08-15 05:31:00,2370,"Sorry guys. The camp was struck by lightening a couple weeks ago and I lost my computer. I of course haven't been on much sense. Anyhow, walleye fishing has been crazy good. Lots of fish. The crappie are slowly starting to school back up, but no big numbers. The smallmouth and musky are going great. The only fish slacking right now is the Northerns. For the past couple weeks it's been hard to catch them... which almost never happens."
1227842,muskyman73,2010-08-15 07:36:00,402,Man that sucks Jared. Where did it strike ? We got a tons of rain down here. My basement got destroyed. 3 feet of water. I coulda stocked it with walleye and been much happier.
1227962,Obabikon,2010-08-15 16:32:00,2370,My wife was actually looking out the window when it happened... it hit the tallest tree on the island (next to Rockledge) then jumped over to the lodge's hand railing. She saw it and thought for sure she was going to get zapped. All it got was the computer though. We were even able to save the hard drive... so didn't lose all our info.
1227981,1shooter,2010-08-15 17:42:00,1493,Is Otis ok?
1228326,alanb,2010-08-16 23:28:00,56,Jared - Glad to hear that only the computer took a hit. That could have been bad with a building burning down or worse. Alanb
1210785,1shooter,2010-06-16 16:08:00,1493,Just got back from that area and my normal spots seemed about 1-1.5 low.
1210819,J-Man,2010-06-16 19:18:00,191,"LWCB notice board shows the lake in the 40th percentile this week. So 60% of the time it's higher at this time of the year. Getting very close to ""normal"" with all the moisture in the area continuing to drain into the basins. A foot or so low compared to ""normal"" is about right.Interesting phenomenon is the algae bloom showing up already. Can't find anyone that remembers it coming in this fast, but the water temps have been in the 60's for weeks now. Some shallow bays hit 70 today in the sun. We showed over 90 degrees on the thermometer in the direct sunlight during the late afternoon period."
1210833,Obabikon,2010-06-16 19:48:00,2370,"Sorry I've been bad about posting. The water level is definately coming up. We did have our first 30"" walleye boated out of the resort for the year. It'll be tough to beat the five we had last year, but they aren't as uncommon as they used to be on Lake of the Woods. The mayfly hatch changed things this week. We still had a ton of activity walleye fishing. Seems like there's a limitless supply of 15"" fish for shore lunch. The 17-18 inchers are tougher. But, I've found that when you do get them, they come in bunches. Musky opener is this weekend, and I think they've been done spawning for almost a month now. The crappies are still MIA. The past week of nasty weather probably has them scattered around. Occasionally finding the odd one walleye fishing on rock points. Pike are doing great. They always are though."
1211387,Obabikon,2010-06-18 15:25:00,2370,"Man the wind blew today. I had the pleasure of guiding for the first time in a week or so. Wind had to have been around 30mph all day. Even hidden from it... the swirls shoved the boat in circles. We managed to boat quite a few walleyes. The big one being 21.5""... lots of perch and several northerns. Not a great day, but we had an awesome lunch. After a day of being beaten by the wind... I'm worn down. It's crazy how that can just completely drain you."
1212691,Guest,2010-06-22 20:07:00,0,How is travel into Obabikon Lake with the lower water levels?
1212698,Obabikon,2010-06-22 20:22:00,2370,"With all the rain, the water levels are up to about normal. No problems getting in and out. Don't go fast, and trim the engine..."
1212731,1shooter,2010-06-22 21:48:00,1493,"Jared, you ever try and go back in that lake on horseshoe island and is there any fish in there?"
1212766,Obabikon,2010-06-23 04:20:00,2370,"Yeah... I've done that quite a few times. I've never caught anything big. 24"" northern's probably the biggest. I've caught some big smallies in the mouth. Probably not worth the effort, but if you want to do something different, it's kind of cool to fish."
1213573,Obabikon,2010-06-25 21:53:00,2370,"Last night a twelve year old caught a 30 1/4"" walleye on an inline spinner up in Obabikon Lake. Casting for musky/northern. My dock hand was with him and boated a 27 incher the very next cast."
1213607,hawks_rule,2010-06-26 05:26:00,115,"That is awesome news... you will likely have a guest for life with memories like that at 12. Congrats to the dock hand as well, I'm sure it was a well deserved break from work."
1201546,alanb,2010-05-18 11:15:00,56,Obabikon- Keep those crappie around for Thursday night! Easy fishing off the dock before supper. Alanb
1203363,Obabikon,2010-05-24 05:46:00,2370,"Well... yesterday was my first guide day. Of course we had a 3 hour long lightening storm Saturday night... The walleye were ok. Not great. We caught several 17-18 inch fish... the biggest being a 20"". Everyone in the boat caught quite a few. But, it wasn't fast a furious and it wasn't streaky. Three or four fish in every spot we went. Typically one nice fish and three dinks. We went Northern fishing in the afternoon, and caught lots of snot rockets. But, we couldn't get the big fish... So, all in all... I'd give the day a ""D+"" at best. We did catch two baby muskies that had beautiful markings. They're really cool looking when they're young."
1203418,Obabikon,2010-05-24 08:51:00,2370,"Last night a guest caught a 56"" MONSTER muskie while bass fishing."
1204514,alanb,2010-05-27 10:45:00,56,Obabikon- The crappie dock was lots of fun! I should have kept a few on second thought. Thanks for all your help (and your crew for that awesome dinner) and have a great summer. See you next year at Pheasant Run. Alanb
1205668,Obabikon,2010-05-31 16:19:00,2370,"The walleye fishing was great today. I took a group of 5 out... the big walleye of the day was 27.5""... caught half a dozen over 21... and plenty of 16-18's. Fished mostly the southern half of miles bay!"
1210379,hawks_rule,2010-06-15 15:44:00,115,Any current updates? Probably busy taking care of guests.... :-)
1210507,W.W.,2010-06-15 22:02:00,245,"Where is the water level at on LOTW (Miles Bay) this year; hi, low or normal ?I'll be headed up in a couple weeks for annual 2 week trip on Miles Bay so leave me a few to catch...... OK ? PS to hawks-rule....... Go CLONES !!!! and you can have Nebraska; guess they got tired of losing in the Big 12 .......W.W. in Iowa"
1210633,Lazy Fisherman,2010-06-16 09:29:00,276,I would be interested in hearing about the water levels also.
1210722,Shorelunch,2010-06-16 13:19:00,554,Click on Lake of the Woods under Water Levels (http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html). It's been climbing steadily all Spring.
1210772,Bill Krejca,2010-06-16 15:03:00,6107,Looks like LOW is a little less than a foot below what it was last September. The good news is that it is going up. Bill Krejca
1197546,Obabikon,2010-05-06 21:24:00,2370,"Hey guys, I'm going to try to post regular updates here for the course of the summer. My family and I came up Sunday, and we apparently chased away the beautiful spring. Today it snowed, and it's been windy and cold pretty much ever day since we arrived. With the exception of a couple hours here and there where the clouds cleared off. Looks like rain and snow tomorrow, but then warming up for the weekend. None of the much needed rain until next weekend though. Temp back up in the 70's by next Friday. The water level is a couple feet lower than the maps. Lots of those hidden rocks are dry as a bone. All of a sudden those 3-4 footers are VERY dangerous. I'm gonna try to go out Northern fishing this weekend... and I'll keep everyone posted on the crappie spawn. (the walleyes are probably finishing up already)"
1200385,Obabikon,2010-05-14 08:05:00,2370,"Well, we finally got some MUCH needed rain yesterday. It was pretty steady from 10AM until past midnight last night. That'll help the water level some. I did go fishing Wednesday night. I took my wife and two little girls up to the narrows. Casting a little bucktail, I caught two big small mouth. One was 4+ lbs. Big fat monster... pulled quite a bit of drag, and had a very good fight with him. I (of course) was the only one fishing. I did force my way through the narrows. Had to back in. First tine I've had to do that in a LONG time."
1200501,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-05-14 16:16:00,629,"Obabikon: I have followed most of your postings over the winter, with great interest, because we have a summer home on the South Shore @ the mouth of the Rainy River. I started my LOTW experiences back in '84 out of Hanson Bay. My ? of you: Do you have any feel for the ""Crappie"" bite in either your area or the Miles Bay territory? With the opener tomorrow for both US & Canada, my thoughts are leaning toward the Canadian side of the lake, because the US side will be a Zoo on the South Shore! I'm thinking that the ""Crappies"" have got to be close to showing their presents in some of their regular spots! Hope you have a comment on the subject! With the amount of time I get to spend on the water in a season, & being reasonably familiar with your area, I'll have to stop this year & introduce myself. I probably spend 50%+ of my time in Canadian water and most of it out of Hanson Bay. Haven't been in Obabikon for probably 2 seasons. Thanks & hope we all have a good season! John Hecklsmiller Ken-Mar-Ke Resort"
1200521,Obabikon,2010-05-14 18:08:00,2370,"I actually just walked in from crappie fishing... and it was just that... crappy. Caught zero off the dock and zero in a couple spawn spots I know close by. Tried a few spots yesterday too, and have yet to see one. They can be hot and cold, and one day they will just turn on. I'll keep trying until I have something good to report."
1200550,muskyman73,2010-05-14 20:00:00,402,"keep the updates coming dude. I hope the crappie hold off for us when we get there. Maybe some rain won't be all that bad too. I like my lower unit the way it is, in working condition. Save me a pork chop too"
1200621,Obabikon,2010-05-15 07:50:00,2370,It's an absolutely beatuiful day to open the season for walleyes! Good luck all you early birds!
1200825,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-05-16 07:17:00,629,"Yes, the opener for a change had nice weather ( a little windy/up to 20mph out of the SSW)! All indications out of the US ""Big Water"" area was only so-so. Most people were in the 17' to 25' water. Plenty of 15"" to 17"" eaters were caught. Lake surface temp. was 49 to 51 degrees. Jigging with a minnow was the best producer."
1201052,Rgate,2010-05-16 22:11:00,14,"The weather was perfect - very warm and light winds. I fished both sat. and sun. and we caught four 24"" a 25"" a 26"" a 27"" and had quite a few between 18"" and 22"". The crew I was guiding said we caught 100 walleyes on sunday but I didn't take my counter. Both days we caught quite a few nice smallmouth - up to 3 pounds. We caught most of our walleyes in 18' to 22' off bouldery shorelines and points. Considering the weather it was one of the best openers ever. we look forward to a busy June."
1201340,Obabikon,2010-05-17 19:00:00,2370,"The crappie are here, and they're goin crazy. About 5PM tonight, I was walking down to the boat to go walleye fishing. When I did, a swirl about 15 feet by 15 feet occured. I knew it had to be a bunch of crappies. Started flipping into them, and was catching one every cast. Must've caught 40 in half an hour. I kept 5 or 6 and had a little fish fry for dinner. Everything I caught was in 15 feet or so of water... but right on the top. Nothing in close to the shore line, and nothing on the bottom. Three or four of them were pushing two pounds."
1201402,Guest,2010-05-17 20:46:00,0,"Obabikon, thanks for all the updates! We always look forward to reading your posts."
