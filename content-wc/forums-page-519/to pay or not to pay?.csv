But what about the rest of are money for the week.Whats your opion, whats fare to the outfitter.Ps we made it to camp but didn't agree on what to do if we didn't.Fred"
1228535,SinOrSwim,2010-08-17 18:25:00,1528,I'm confused. You made it to the camp but you didn't stay? Or you didn't fly out? If you didn't go then you lose your deposit but nothing else. If you flew in a day late then in my opinion you owe full rates. It wasn't your outfitters fault you were a day late. If you didn't fly in and stayed at his lodge then I guess you would owe the weekly rate for those cabins?
1228549,Outfitter17,2010-08-17 19:04:00,127,Not sure what the question is either?
1228564,NP4ME,2010-08-17 19:38:00,378,"Outfitter, Haven't seen any reports from you lately. How has the fishing been? Still debating a trip for next year. NP"
1228574,jigman 2003,2010-08-17 20:00:00,981,"I think they made it, he just wants to know what they should have done or what would have been fair if they didn't"
1228586,v-bay gord,2010-08-17 20:20:00,3168,"If you book a trip to Mexico and don't make it to the airport on time do you expect the resort in Mexico (or your travel agent) to send you a refund? It sucks to hit a deer but the operator was not booking anyone else in that cabin because you booked it. What is fair depends on what side of the deer you are on, I guess."
1228600,jigman 2003,2010-08-17 21:07:00,981,I would expect that my money be refunded because I'd never book a trip like that without trip insurance. I do however realize that I'd still be paying the outfitter and making the claim on said insurance.
1228636,Obabikon,2010-08-18 05:58:00,2370,"The right thing to do is dependant on the owner. Just call them and tell them the situation. Tell them you're willing to pay more than just the deposit for not being able to make it. Most operators will be honest and sympathetic towards the situation. With us, if someone misses their trip, I hold the deposit for next year. (I don't refund, but it's still applicable for the following year)"
1228648,orchard frank,2010-08-18 06:53:00,1900,"I know of at least a couple instances where travel problems occurred on the road north, and the camp owner arranged for the party's transportation the rest of the way. Car problems are not an unusual thing, they've dealt with them before."
1228697,wallydave,2010-08-18 08:58:00,2151,"I have seen roadkill moose and deer along the road during my Canadian trips. Our group calls them biological speed bumps! We have never discussed the idea of how to deal with such an situation. One of the good things about boards like this is we can all share our expriences and help each other to address them. Our group has several ""regulars"" plus some new blood time to time. In our group I hope we would all pitch in to help out with the costs related to a ""Bambi"" strike. Wee tend to come together as a group to face all the ""adventure"" a trip up north can bring. Even when we have had a less than great trip, poor fishing, not great hosts, we have come together and still made the trip worthwhile! When we get together for a pre trip dinner we will talk this idea through! The bottom line is to find a solution that fits your groups ""karma"""
