I have a cabin reserved for next June, how has the fishing been? Our last trip was slightly later than we usually go, first week of June. Our last trip had high water and warm weather. Andrea, was still able to put us on th fish despite the different condiditons. How has the fishing been since then? Two years has been more than enough of a wait to get back to the Lac!"
1228261,bpetersen,2010-08-16 18:37:00,251,I have been staying at Cherob's the first week of June 2008 and 2010. I thought 2008 was better. Fish were deeper this year and scattered. We don't get into the long boat rides but heard McKenzie was doing o.k. during that same week. We fished below the dam and caught a large number of walleye but nothing over 27 inches.

Fishing was AWESOME, the best we have ever had in the 8 YEARS we have been going there. According to the resort owner they had just started to really bite on the reefs & around the islands the week before we arrived. We caught a variety of sizes below slot, in slot and above slot. Our group of 4 limited out in eater walleyes in less than 3 hours and threw many back in between. Water temps are warm 72 - 74 degrees. We used spinner rigs and jigs with minnows. Colors that worked best with spinners was purple & pink & chartreuse.....and jigs were chartreuse, gold, pink & fire tiger..... Fish were in 10-25 feet. We boated & released a 27 1/2"" & 28"" walleyes in Bay of Islands and also 32"", 33"" & 34"" northerns trolling with spinners...... Hopefully, the fishing is still hot when you go! Booked again for same week next year & can't wait!!! RBF"
