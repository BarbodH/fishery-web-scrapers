He has a great assortment and the colors and action are really great. Mike is a WC Memeber here and is a really nice guy to talk to. Very knowledgeable on his products aslo. His website is www.sirmanski.com. I had the best luck in deeper waters trolling the deep diving WALLSKI WACKER.These lures will dive to 20 feet depending on how much line you have out.The lures have a tough finish on them and even after weeeks trolling and banging bottom, they still looked great.I did lose a couple but as soon as I got home I ordered a few more. Good Luck on your trip."
1228442,wallydave,2010-08-17 11:54:00,2151,"I have ordered a couple Sirmanski lures and jigs for my next trip to Lac Seul. Shipping was fast and easy, the lures and jigs look great! By next June I hope to have plenty of wally's in the boat!"
1228675,John walleye,2010-08-18 08:02:00,5,I have read some good things about Sirmanski lures - I will be ordering some for next years trip - to late for this weekend.John
1228135,John walleye,2010-08-16 11:13:00,5,I have fished on Lac Suel for the past few years and will be heading up this weekend.I have not used any cranks - but want to try this year and need some advice.I want to toss some up along some points and around some islands. What have been some hot cranks on Lac Seul? Plus do three-way systems work in deeper water? - 10-20ft? The other guys in the boat will be using spinners - so I will be just back trolling.Any help would be great.John
1228143,wallydave,2010-08-16 12:02:00,2151,"On Lac Seul, I have had good luck with perch or Firetiger pattern wally divers. Berkley Frenzy's have produced also. You going for wally's or Pike?"
1228148,John walleye,2010-08-16 12:18:00,5,Just Walleye - but I was still thinking about using a wire leader.
1228155,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-16 12:39:00,109,We have had luck up there trolling cranks. We had really good luck and some bigger fish on a purple/metal flake crank. We found a bay that is about 15-20 ft deep and jest troll cranks in there and have managed to catch some bigger walleyes over the past few years. Just get something that dives about 10-12 ft down I would say and you should be able to find some fish. We used deep down husky jerks this week and caught a few that way. Good Luck!
1228199,wallydave,2010-08-16 14:44:00,2151,"My boat/cabin buddy loves to troll and cast with a big Johnson silver spoon rigged with a pork rind trailer. Using a leader will help when you want to change lures, as well as help land those toothy slimy, but fun to catch pike! As long as thier biting, and you have enough walleye for lunch and the trip home, catching pike is fun too!"
1228214,John walleye,2010-08-16 15:18:00,5,Really - He uses a johnson spoon and catches Walleye? Interesting.
1228229,Jigger1,2010-08-16 16:00:00,234,"Watching this thread with interest. Making my second trip this year on Saturday and we almost exclusively use jig/minnow for eyes. Have only thrown husky jerks early in the year to catch eyes in warm water bays. However will never forget one of the hardest hits I ever had on LacSeul. It was from a 24"" walleye that slammed a bucktail while throwing for pike. Swear it hit harder than almost any pike I've ever caught."
1228307,John walleye,2010-08-16 21:24:00,5,Where are you staying? We will be up in the Ear Falls area - but we mainly fish in Steamboat this time of year.
1228312,orchard frank,2010-08-16 22:00:00,1900,"My Number 1 all-time best was the Hot-N-Tot. Will cast a mile, bounce off the rocks with minimal snagging, can troll fast or slow. Killer on big eyes and pike. Gold/Pink was our best, but Gold/Orange, Gold/Black, Firetiger and a bunch of others I'm sure good also. Throw it up on reefs and points, troll on the deep outside edges. Most good cranks will work, the Tot can handle a leader, we used to just use a piece of 30-40# Flouro ahead of the snap."
1228375,wallydave,2010-08-17 07:59:00,2151,Yes! He his son and brother have had great results with the sliver spoons. His brother caught a 30 in. walleye trolling a backbay not far from the camp. When the wally's are feeding it's a good day on the water!
