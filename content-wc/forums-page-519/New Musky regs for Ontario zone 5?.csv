They were told by the camp owner that new MNR regulations prohibited boating a musky that was under the minimum size limit, that the hook must be removed while the fish was in the water, and in theory, eliminating CPR for muskys. I checked the regs book for zone 5 and could not verify this. Was the resort owner acting on his own sense of fish conservation or am I missing something in regulations. Also, if I am missing something, is this ""new regulation"" in effect on Lake of the Woods as well? Thanks in advance, Marv"
1228355,J-Man,2010-08-17 07:01:00,191,"That is the letter of the law. Unless a fish is somewhat close to the minimum size and needs to be verified by a measurement, the regs say not to bring it in the boat because as soon as you pick up that fish and have it in the boat, you are possessing it. Not many fish would be mistaken for 54 inches so that would make 99% of them have to be handled this way. However, when asked of an Ontario MNR Conservation Officer at a muskie club meeting in Winnipeg, he said ""no"" to the following question:""Have you or do you know of any incident where a fine was given for taking a quick photo of a muskie that was under the legal limit during the open muskie angling season."" The camp owner is correct on the interpretation of the law, but possibly a little over-protective. There are a great deal of anglers that have no experience handling muskies and often do a great deal of harm to a fish because of that lack of experience. In any case where the proper release tools aren't available, (large net/cradle to leave the fish in the water during dehooking, long pliers, hook cutters, jaw spreader, etc) a water release would be better for the fish and the angler. Those teeth and gill rakers are sharp and many a ""big"" walleye net has been shredded by a muskie that shouldn't have been put in it in the first place.The spirit of the law is not to put an end to CPR (catch, photograph, release) fishing for muskies. Just be prepared to handle them properly and you should never have a problem on the water."

1228358,v-bay gord,2010-08-17 07:05:00,3168,"There is no ""new"" regs for muskie fishing in zone 5. The owner is acting upon his / her own sense of what is good catch and release. In a sense he is right.......you should be unhooking the fish in the water (not laying it in your boat). It is illegal to possess a fish under the size limit.......keeping one in your live well or having extended photo shoots ""could"" be interpretated as such by a C.O. Using common sense and doing a proper release does not necessarily mean going without a quick picture, in my opinion."
