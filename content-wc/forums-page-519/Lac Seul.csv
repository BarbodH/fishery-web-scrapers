Fished mostly McKenzie Bay & Bay of Islands. Our group caught a 27 1/2 & 28 inch walleye in Bay of Islands. Also, caught 32"", 33"" & 34"" northerns in Scout Bay......Caught MANY walleye between 16-25"" and had no problem limiting out on eater walleyes our first day of fishing within 3 hours! Weather was good too, only one day too windy to venture out into big water. Fished south of Windigo Point in main basin, but found the bite to be better closer to resort in McKenzie & Bay of Islands on the reefs between 8-20 feet of water. Jigs & Spinners with a minnow worked best! I'm still on ""cloud 9"" flying high and counting down the days again to our trip next year! Border wait times both ways were the longest we have ever had at Int'l Falls..... Going into Canada ~ arrived around 11am and waited 2 hours.....coming back arrived at 12:30 and waited 3 hours!!! Back to the real world and work tomorrow. Rather-be-fishin on Lac Seul Again!"

1228157,fishingMN4eyes,2010-08-16 12:41:00,109,"Just got back last night from a trip to Chamberlain Narrows. We had luck in anywhere from about 12-30 ft of water. We caught a ton of slot fish in the 20-21"" range which were fun to catch. Lots of small fish were boated and not a ton of bigger fish. We had one 24"" boated and a 26"" as well which was caught trolling cranks. We fished minnows and crawlers to start the week and finished up using strictly crawlers (mainly because we couldn't keep the minnows alive for very long). The crawlers seemed to fish pretty even with minnows if not even outfish them when we actually used the minnows. Saturday and Sunday (for the boat ride back to the launch) were very windy. We struggled contolling the boat in the wind so we went where it was a little more protected. We still caught fish, but the other boat we were with had better fishing while they were battling the wind. Pretty good week of fishing. Heard there is going to be some nasty weather up there this week though with cool temps as well. Good luck to anyone heading up there!"
