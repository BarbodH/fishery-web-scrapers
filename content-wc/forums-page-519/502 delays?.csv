1227499,fishinnut 3446,2010-08-13 13:14:00,638,Finally leaving in 6 hrs.wanting to know is everything is complete?
1227509,badgerfowl,2010-08-13 14:47:00,40,yes
1227510,fishinnut 3446,2010-08-13 14:56:00,638,Sweet!!!!!
1227515,badgerfowl,2010-08-13 15:12:00,40,"we went through the first week in august and it was completed, except the exit ramp in dryden. We turned before then and missed most of dryden. Saved 10-15 minutes actually."
1227536,fishinnut 3446,2010-08-13 16:35:00,638,"Anyone know the name of the road at the end of 502 it runs to the left and goes to Eagle lake?,the short cut so I won't have to go in to Dryden"
1227546,lunker99,2010-08-13 17:28:00,236,I think it is 594.
1227547,Blue Lk,2010-08-13 17:29:00,269,"HWY 594,comes back out on Hwy 17 at Eagle River"
1227685,dave10,2010-08-14 09:59:00,342,"You might want to consider taking Ojibway over toward Eagle Lake as a way to avoid Dryden and save some time. It is well marked with the names of many Eagle Lake lodges, so you can't miss it. It is in quite good shape at this point (it has been pretty rough for trailering in past years). It saves about 20 minutes compared to going all the way up 502 to to 594. Dave"
1227698,ole timer,2010-08-14 11:24:00,34,I'm assuming it's gravel?
1227709,dave10,2010-08-14 12:26:00,342,"Only the first two miles or so off of 502 is gravel, by my estimation. The rest is pretty decent pavement, and there aren't potholes as there were a few years back. We made surprisingly good time, and were towing a boat. Dave"
