Because of the damper put on travel by 9/11, the province was refunding the GST tax to boost tourism, which we benefited from. Does anyone know whether that rebate policy in effect for 2004 or was that a one-time deal that is history. I suspect it is. Thanks,"

It was in reaction to the sars outbreak in toronto. It only was in effect from May - sept 30th. You can still get your gst rebate (federal sales tax). every year but only on purchases brought back to the states or just on the accomadations section of your vacation."
