These factories have never heard of the phrases ""minimum wage"", or ""union"", or ""vacation pay"", or ""health benefits"", or ""unemployment insurance"", or ""overtime pay"", etc. Wal Mart has sold out the American and Canadian workers to fatten their bottom line. How do you think the Sam Walton heirs have amassed a fortune of over $100 BILLION dollars between the 5 of them? Oh yeah, the fact that many of Wal Mart's employees' weekly hours are kept low enough so they are considered part-time and receive few benefits probably helps too."
536033,Guest,2003-12-18 09:58:00,0,"Do deez 'Toban folks look different? Do dey have a accent? I mean, like how do dey know? Dem walmart folks, I mean? Maybe dey mistakenly tink you are from Minnesota? Which could explain duh situation, don't chu-know? Yah, ya know, sure, betcha dats it! :-)"
536036,Guest,2003-12-18 14:55:00,0,"From someone who is an ""ex-tobin"" and a current lodge owner in Ontario I can honestly say that there is a stereotypical 'tobin.... usually recognizable by the whining if they can't get a deal on something. Not to say some of the high rolling tobins around LOW don't have the bucks.....they are probably a big contributor to the local economy. Most I have dealt with (I don't encourage them anymore) are either looking for cabins with ""love tubs"" but don't want to pay .....or......they want to camp. No big deal but in reality they don't seem to appreciate the area for what it has to offer....great scenery and serenity....they take it for granted way too much for my liking. I prefer the americans...they actually appreciate the area more. Having had my rant, there are exceptions and I apologize to those 'tobins who don't feel they fit my description."
536060,Guest,2003-12-19 13:00:00,0,"More important than Walmart,,,,great food ! Has the Plaza Restaurant in Kenora changed ownership. I know they were For Sale for a while, owners wanted to retire. By the way, 'the Plaza' has the best Greek food east of the Danforth !"

536077,Matches,2003-12-19 20:52:00,236,"But Wal-Mart is betting that a fair amount of the people that would have eaten at ""The Plaza"", will now eat at the McDonalds in their store. In addition to that, the profit they make from their store doesn't stay in the community as it probably would with local owners."
536078,Guest,2003-12-19 22:29:00,0,"Correction, 'the plaza'has the best Greek food west of the Danforth. You will find many who agree with you, that said and speaking specifically to the Plaza, a McDonalds customer will have no palate for great food, in this case great Greek food. Many comments on this board/topic lead to a liberal beating of this issue, fact is that we are very blessed to live in a free country and spend the hard earned $$ where we choose. Consumers vote with their pocketbooks and we as consumers should feel no civil right, duty or moral obligation whatsoever to shop at a 'local' retailer vs. Walmart, Costco, RCWC, CTC or Safeway. (By the way, Sobeys is building a store next to Walmart - Kenora.) Its no secret that Safeway and CTC and virtually every gasoline retailer in the area have been 'market pricing' for many years, it works and consumers still choose to make purchases, in some cases happily. The economic engine works, and will continue to work with the entry of Walmart, Sobeys etc. Granted, there will be shifts in economic gain and loss in the short term, but all will continue to make a rate of return. Live long and prosper !"
536016,Matches,2003-12-17 16:29:00,236,"Is this really needed or welcomed? I just read that Wal-Mart is building an 80,000 sq.ft. store that will have a pharmacy, photo development outlet, grocery sales and a McDonald's. I wonder how many small business owners this will hurt."
536017,Guest,2003-12-17 17:27:00,0,"This can be a good thing. It will now force the local retailers to actually maybe have some customer service. Speaking as a 'Toban, there has been times that I have been in a ""store"" and received rather poor service. I have never complained about poor service (which maybe I should have) I've always just (in my mind) written it off as another poor atittude towards 'Tobans. Now BEFORE you all jump me over this, understand that the ""general"" attitude towards us 'Tobans is not a very good one. As once explained to me by a local ""We have 4 months to make a 12 month living, and darn it we are going to do it"" I'm sure that not ALL people in the NW region have this feeling, but it is present. Will I shop at Walmart ? Probably not. I don't go there here in Winnipeg, so why will I in Kenora ? I'll still continue to support the local shops first, and hope that maybe now they will appreciate us 'Tobans a little more ?! Thats my personal perspective. I'm sure our friends from the south may have a different view, hopefully it's a better one ! Good Fishen Rob"

536020,Guest,2003-12-17 18:26:00,0,"Whats a ""Toban"""
536021,Guest,2003-12-17 18:39:00,0,"A 'Toban is a MANitoban. Local slang for someone from Manitoba. The LOW area is the most popular vacation/summer home destination for people from here. The economic impact 'Tobans have on the Kenora area is huge ! The area caters to the ""A-List"" or the ""Who's Who"" types. Not uncommon to see some of the more elite types of Wpg / Canada shopping etc. In other words, BIG money ! Good Fishen Rob p.s I ain't one of the BIG money ! LOL !"
536022,MK,2003-12-17 19:26:00,322,"How many small businesses will it hurt? Most of them. The main street shopping will nearly cease and most the stores will eventually close. Sooner or later, if you're lucky, some type of service business will move into the boarded up retail buildings. In the meantime, the area around Walmart will thrive with fast foods. Buy land near WM if you can. Many of the locals that worked at the small shops will start wearing blue vests and stocking shelves at WM. If you think service is bad at some local stores, wait until they close and there is no service. The small business owners that supported the town will go by the wayside and the local civic groups and charities will have to depend on the Walton family for help. Good luck to them. It's been played out a thousand times here in the states. Lower prices, that is until all of the small businesses go out and then WM will raise their prices. Classic monopoly. These are some of the reasons that so many local communities are fighting the WM superstores here in the states. You'll get lower prices at the cost of losing some of your identity. It won't be the end of the world, but in 5-10 years your town will have a different character, for better or for worse. As you can guess, I'm not a WM fan. The only thing Walmart that I buy is their stock for my retirement plan. I think they've destroyed small towns everywhere but at the way they're growing, the stock should continue to do well. And no, I'm not one of the businesses they destroyed. I just watched a lot of good local people lose their livelihoods and watched the local shoe store, clothing store, hardware, electronics shop, and many others close their doors forever. Maybe this is just the way of the future, but I don't care much for it."

We all want lower prices but can't quite see past our nose, that we are about to cut off.............to spite.....our face...as the saying goes The economical support of Walmart sends our jobs directly to China..... so when you go into Walmart feeling all ""Sam Walton Happy"" - ""Go USA"" ........JUST REMEMBER that you ARE improving the economy.......the economy of the Chinese; - THANKS FOR NOTHING !
