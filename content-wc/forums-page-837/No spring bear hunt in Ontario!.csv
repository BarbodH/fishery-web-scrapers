That sound like a win win deal to me less hunters and more money."
536091,Trailerguy,2003-12-21 10:07:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, that's very close on the price, but it takes more than one BMU to make a living. If you aren't an outfitter who was grandfathered in at the initial organization of the BMU'S, the MNR is saying 1 bear 1 BMU, (roughly 55 square Kilometers), they haven't enforced this with fines yet as far as I know. But I do know that when the BMU's are transfered they restrict the number of bears harvested to what they consider to be sustainable levels. IMHO the problem is that the bears migrate to the food supply. A recovering clear cut with a good berry supply in September can have a population like a small town in NWO. At the same time an area of old timber may be virtually empty at that time, but they return to it to overwinter. In the spring the poupulation is more evenly spread out, since they are just starting to forage, looking for anthills and other protien sources to get their stomaches restarted after hibrination. As far as the price goes, outfitters will alway charge as much as they think the public will pay. :) I beleive the statistics are in the neighborhood of 3 bears per square mile in NWO where as 1 bear per 3 square miles in N Minn."

536070,Trailerguy,2003-12-19 19:46:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If you couldn't bait bear in NWO, there wouldn't be many killed. Hunting with dogs is not a viable option. You don't have a lot of side roads to use for getting ahead of the dogs. So when they run the bear over the hill and out of sight, they get lost. Wolves of course consider dog meat to be a delicacy, :) :) so they don't last the nightout. Beyond that, how many bears have you seen while walking around the bush? Not much chance there. On the other hand hunting dump bears is a despicable practice, which is why it is illegal. PS. In my experience Bears have little or no intrest in fish guts. They far prefer any kind of cooking grease or fat to anything else."

When I lived in the states I had to worry about my house getting broke into, my car getting stoled (at gun point)or getting mugged when I walked out of the Wal Mart I,ll take the bears any day, lets face it there only around for a couple month anyway."
536082,Trailerguy,2003-12-20 12:23:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Well, having had the door rattle at 6 AM. and finding a bear standing up pulling at the screen one October morning wasn't much diferent than a stick up. LOL :)"
536083,bigfish1965,2003-12-20 20:30:00,3210,"'Cept you can probably shoot a person breaking in without much trouble, but shoot that bear trying to kill you and you're in for it!"
536084,Matches,2003-12-20 21:05:00,236,"Immigrant makes a good point. How much of a problem really are bear?? Does Ontario have a bear population problem? If there is, wouldn't they want the spring hunt?"
536085,Guest,2003-12-20 21:30:00,0,"The way I see it the MNR should monitor the outfitters that have bear manegment areas more closly. Around the town I live in 3 people have BMA's in the surounding area. One guy is a camp owner and take 2-4 hunters a year. the other guy owns a sports shop and might 1 hunter.And the 3rd a camp owner that takes 0 hunters Do you see a problem here, the BMA's were just a land grap when they came out.Alot of people have them but they are not harvesting enough bear."
536086,bigfish1965,2003-12-20 21:40:00,3210,"Whether or not there is a bear problem depends on how you interpret the stats. Certain methodologies were questionally used and the results are tainted. Stay tuned for next years report. Once a few campers in Algonquin get eaten, the tree huggers will lose their audience."

536088,Trailerguy,2003-12-21 08:03:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I have seen the paperwork that goes with a BMU. Unless the outfitter out and out lies, the MNR knows exactly how many bears are taken from which BMU, in fact they regulate how many are supose to be harvested.This is cross checked by a form signed by the hunter and sent in at the end of the hunt as well. It's hard to beleive an outfitter would be willing to pay the fee required to hold a BMU year after year if he wasn't going to profit from it. One outfitter who didn't harvest the bears lost the BMU a few years ago in the area I'm familiar with."
536045,Matches,2003-12-18 20:38:00,236,The Ontario Liberals have decided not to reinstate the spring bear hunt. How popular was bear spring hunting? Here is a link to the article I read.http://www.bowesnet.com/dailyminer/H...newsfront.html
536048,PJM,2003-12-18 22:32:00,3516,"Matches Being that you live in America Matches, when do you find time to up to Canada to go bear hunting or do you just like looking at them at the dump."
536049,Guest,2003-12-19 04:39:00,0,Bear hunting was very poular among Americans. It also employed a fair number of locals in the baiting and tourism thing especially in smaller towns. I do not like the idea of shooting bears in the spring over bait personally and would never do it but if people want to hunt like that that is their choice. The issue is larger than hunting though. Our local MPPs were against the arbitrary cancellation of it and stillare. This is another example of the south telling the North what to do. There are no bears in the south and most people who voted on this cancellation have probably never seen a real wild bear or on that matter probably have never met a small town Northern Ontario resident. It is a contentious issue with Northerners like me. There are many who feel that all the live trapped problem bears should be shipped to Toronto and released in the suburbs.

536054,Guest,2003-12-19 09:06:00,0,Anybody who likes shooting a Bear coming to a sack of fish guts would probably enjoy fishing in an aquarium. There are a lot of us who think that is not hunting and that baited hunts should be banned.
536064,Matches,2003-12-19 14:19:00,236,"LUV 2 HUNT I agree and for the record I have never hunted bear, but they are fun to go watch at the dump. At one of the sport shows, I did have a conversation with someone from the DNR (Minnesota) about the use of bait to attract bears. He said if it wasn't allowed, the harvest would be much lower and we would have even a bigger bear population problem. Here in Minnesota I know the population of bears is becoming a problem."
536065,Guest,2003-12-19 15:11:00,0,"If you use a call or a decoy, is that not also baiting the animal?"
