I have spot painted every lure and jig I have. Even made up 500 more leadheads to go with the other two boxes that my kids will inherit. Last night I studied the map of the lake we go to just in case I have missed a good spot during the last 12 years...fat chance. Guess tonight I will have to go through the fishing pictures again....CMON SPRING

However, there is nothing better than the first tug on the line in June, a tug that says there is a walleye who wants to be shore-lunch under the great Canadian sky. We spend a couple of weeks in Northern Wisconsin in the summer having fun in the sun, doing the water-sking and family fishing trip which is great, but nothing the solitude and beauty of northwest Ontario. Five months and two weeks till the Marty Boys try to sly the walleyes...IAWalleye"
