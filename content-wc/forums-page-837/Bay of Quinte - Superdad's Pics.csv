Just remember Super...I rule the other end of Lake Ontario!... :):) Did you see the 18 pounder caught end of November, McQ? There was pics of it on the OntarioFishing.net site. Massive fish. Lake Ontario will give up the next Canadian record, for sure."
536050,McQ,2003-12-19 05:24:00,615,I do know this Bigfish - Superdad is a great ambassador for the fall fishing on Quinte and Eastern Lake Ontario. His reports have stirred up a lot of buzz about next years Cabelas tournament out of Henderson Harbor in New York. That area is well known for kicking out huge fish too. I have no problem with Lake Ontario holding the next record. We are seeing many fish up to the 15# range now and get reports on even bigger ones every once and a while.
