I use a white or chartruese tail 2-3"" pink, white, chartruese head. 1/16 - 1/4 oz jig depending upon depth of water. These crappie niblets self distruct/disolve and leave a trail that you can see like milk behind them. So, I figure if fish can smell they ought to be able to smell these things.....they stink really good! I use the silver coated ones and look like I have glitter all over me when I come home from fishing. They make pink, yellow, white, green, and sliver/glitter covered varieties. I also use them to trout fish here in Mo in the winter. Good luck. ro"

536121,Guest,2003-12-23 08:49:00,0,Jig Minnows through June...Jig Leechs after July 1st.....troll crawlers on flats anytime.

536146,Guest,2003-12-25 08:16:00,0,"In 90% of the cases, crawlers pulled behind a bottom bouncer and spinner rig will out produce anything going in northwestern Ontario. However, nothing is 100%, so there will be times when minnows or leeches will work better, usually when the eyes are shallow. A bouncer guy will outfish a jigger day in and day out. The bigger and juicier a crawler, the better."
536149,River_eye,2003-12-25 11:51:00,1486,"Leaches all spring and into the summer, until minnows start working better, big walleyes like the leaches the best on LOTW, but there comes a time in mid-july where only live minnows work."
536157,Mahumba,2003-12-26 11:43:00,345,"For me it depends on the situation. Worms, leeches and minnows all work at given times or all at the same time. I always have some of each when I go out. But when it's tough out there and they ain't biting........try a live crawdad (crayfish) on a slip sinker rig. I think you may be surprised. Also wet flies (non live bait) on light line worked in shallow (less than 10 feet) work great. Use emergent patterns. Roger Mayer."

536168,Guest,2003-12-27 12:21:00,0,"crappie nibblets! crazy, but I use them here in Mo for crappie and couple years ago in Canada had jar of them (Berkley, power bait smaller than mini marshmallows) called ""Crappie Niblets"" and walleye seem to like them just as well as minnows, leeches, crawlers. I usually have them with me and use them while my guests use other live baits like minnows/leeches/crawlers. 200-300 in a tiny jar so they last along time even when you are catching alot of fish, compact, great for portage lakes, canoe trips ect.....ro"
536182,Guest,2003-12-28 06:59:00,0,"Roger, How do you rig them? Thanks"
536196,Guest,2003-12-29 08:49:00,0,Seems to me that the bait is not as important as the spot you fish and keeping the bait on the bottom. My years of fishing Canada have taught me to fish windy points and adjacent flats and keep what ever bait I use on the bottom. I perfer jig fishing and you need to learn to feel the bite and react quick. Hard to beat a Chartreuse jig tipped with a minnow or a leech.
