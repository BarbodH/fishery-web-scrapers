I would like to try some lake trout fishing, was wondering if anyone would know how to fish lake trout this time of year, I assume trolling with spoons, if someone could give me their favorite spoon types, that would help so i know what to buy. Also plan on fishing lac suel, suppose to be launch 5 miles from camp. was wondering how far from launch need to travel for walleye. Thanks, Walldawg"

No help for the trout on Vermillion, but go for smallies and muskie, great fishing around all the islands. Plus, the lake is right on the campground, so that is a plus. As for Lac Seul, there is a launch about 2 miles from C.C. (exit the camp ground, go left, look for the second (yes second) launch sign). Fishing is good within 10-20 minutes boat ride, depending on your boat. Troll perch colored cranks, rattler cranks, lindy rigs with worms. You'll kill the walleye and northern. Enjoy! >I'm heading up to country camp, on big vermillion, may 25-29. >I would like to try some lake trout fishing, was wondering if >anyone would know how to fish lake trout this time of year, I >assume trolling with spoons, if someone could give me their >favorite spoon types, that would help so i know what to buy. >Also plan on fishing lac suel, suppose to be launch 5 miles >from camp. was wondering how far from launch need to travel >for walleye. > >Thanks, Walldawg"

There are a lot of shallow reefs with sharp drop offs that we go to and they can either be on top of the reef or suspended right off the edge. Depending how warm the water is at that time of year, Smallies can be great against the shore."
