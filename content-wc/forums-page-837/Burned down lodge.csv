535884,Guest,2003-12-07 21:26:00,0,I have been kind of watching this site to see if any progress has been made regarding the arson that took place at that multimillion dollar lodge that burned a few months back. I forget the name. Anything happening with that? Just curious.
535886,Guest,2003-12-07 23:19:00,0,"The place that you are thinking of was /is the Minaki Lodge. Last I heard, arson has been ruled out as a cause. Investigators are now looking to see what the cause is/was. I have not spoken to anybody from Calgary in the past little while so the cause might be known now. Maybe Turbo could shed some light on this situation. Good Fishen Rob"
535887,Reels,2003-12-08 05:45:00,2876,"I talked to some friends up in Minaki, and they said the investigation was not over yet. They expected an anouncement about two weeks ago, but extended it again. Turbo said they ruled out an accelerant, but not arson as far as I know. That was some time ago, so maybe he has an update. <{{}}><"

BUT an independant investigation has said that HYDRO ONE is responseble for the fire and that a claim is filed against them.I'm sure that if you go ""The Suns"" website, you can read the story for yourself.
