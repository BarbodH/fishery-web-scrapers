Taxes will be assessed on seasonal trailers like other permanent structures starting in 2003,(Ontario). If the resort owner is already paying real estate taxes and taxes on any profit from running a business, how can they tax a seasonal trailer paying rent? Isn't this double taxation??? Am I missing something?? Here is a link to the article.http://www.bowesnet.com/dailyminer/H...newsfront.html"

But many places also tax the trailers, here in Iowa I beleive they have to buy a plate at the courthouse just like a car plate, even when they set in a trailer court year round. Real estate (property) taxes here are based on size and value of structures on the property, as well as value of the bare land. I think this is aimed at discouraging low rent operations and encouraging more money to be spent in Ontario, which means more taxes in general."

Ideally the extra tax should used to help the monitoring and clean up of lakes impacted by the stress of having numerous families on a small land mass and all the grey water and other accidental pollution of the waterfront. But even if the MNR would get some more funds from general revenue it would help. It further provides some teeth for the Government to slow the growth of seasonal campers or at least have it pay for some of the impacts. jake
