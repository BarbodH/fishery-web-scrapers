536031,Guest,2003-12-18 09:48:00,0,"Caught my largest pike ever last year. 44 1/2"" ... 24 lbs. on a dead bait at Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermillion Lake. I was fishing with my Father-in-law. We both had floats out when the wind picked up and his line started to drift into my line. I had only just cast it out. I didn't say anything, but I was sort of pissed because he cast so close to me. As I brought the bait in a large pike swiped at it but missed. I quickly dropped my rod tip about 3 ft. and it slammed it. It was incredible. I also caught a 41"" 21lb pike that week. By the way it was opening weekend last year. adam P.S. I will never get pissed at my Father-in-law again for bad casts."
