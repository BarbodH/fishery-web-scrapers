536092,Mahumba,2003-12-21 12:36:00,345,"I live right smack dab in the middle of bear country. I don't hunt them and used to think I would never shoot them. Out here our dump is open on Wed., Sat, and Sunday. In the mean time I store my garbage in a locked box in my garage. The bears have no problem ripping or lifting or bending garage doors to get at it. Many times I have been woked up to them breaking something. They never bother the house just where I keep the garbage, which by the way goes to the dump every available day that it is open. This happens to everyone of us out here. Yes it is an inconvience. But when my kids have to start taking the bus at early hours in the morning I will start to get worried. Me myself I am not afraid of them as they can be scared off easy. But what will they think of a 6 and four year old? This bothers me. Roger Mayer."

536095,Matches,2003-12-21 18:43:00,236,"Obviously the more comfortable bears get around people the bigger concern you should have for your kids. If I lived where you do, I guess I would grab my gun every morning and walk my kids to the bus stop! If you did that where I live, you'd be arrested real fast."
536098,Guest,2003-12-21 19:50:00,0,I live in NW Ontario and bears are a fact of life. We bear proof our garbage ect and educate our kids about bears. I have had them destroy trees (apple) and try to break into my house through a window. With that guy I took out the 30-06.... got a clear safe shot in my back yard and dropped him with one shot. My wife had been baking bread and I guess he was looking for some. I prefer to leave them alone and we get them in the yard every year. Most hang around for a day or two and them move on. The apples are a real draw and I remove as early as possible. I do not like to shoot them but will if I have to.
536109,Guest,2003-12-22 15:19:00,0,You should not have a bear problem for at least another 3-4 months. I think there a little groggy right now! But in the spring and fall i would have your kids bring a tape recorder with a bunch of dogs barking real lound that should take care of it!!
536116,McQ,2003-12-22 19:24:00,615,"Up here in my area of Ottawa/Gatineau (1,000,000 +) we have a multiple problem,the west end of Ottawa is plagued with an overpopulation of deer, the east end suffers from moose visiting in town and on my side of the river we have had an explosion in the bear population over the last few years - late summer and fall this year the animal control folks had to put down 31 nuisance bears and it's getting worse. Even with a spring hunt here in Quebec the bear situation is seriously out of control. A little further north if you decide to do a little blueberry picking in August you'd better have someone sitting guard, for sure a bear or two will be around."
536118,Guest,2003-12-23 05:23:00,0,I firmly believe that there should be firm policy on nuisance bears. The live trap thing for fear of upsetting a couple of tree huggers is out of hand. If the bear is a problem destroying it is an efficient cost effective sollution. I'd prefer to have good roads and lower taxes than a delivery system for bears that we have to pay for.
536162,Guest,2003-12-27 00:07:00,0,"Park a couple of barking hounds in your yard, that will take care of the problem."
536163,Guest,2003-12-27 06:49:00,0,"Get a couple barking hounds to ruin the peacefulness you moved away from the city for, maybe they'll attract some wolves too."
536169,Minnow Man,2003-12-27 14:05:00,85,"Had a yellow lab that barked at the bears, the bears got use to his bark and were not afaid of him. Wolves killed the lab a few years ago. I now have a life size stuffed wolf mount. Bears are a problem where I live, trapped 6 bear in one week last summer and two the same day. All live released."
