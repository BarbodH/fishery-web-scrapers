536136,Guest,2003-12-24 08:28:00,0,North American Whitetail has a nine page article about this in it this month. They also show live photos of the deer that the boys father and two uncles have taken over the past three years.
536138,Guest,2003-12-24 09:12:00,0,A little more info:http://www.startribune.com/stories/531/4284831.html
536143,Guest,2003-12-24 17:04:00,0,This is a great story . It shows how persistence and dedication can result in success. The best thing about it is that it tells the story of how the faimly that hunts together stays together. Take a youngster hunting ...the rewards are good for both of you...Deer or no Deer.
