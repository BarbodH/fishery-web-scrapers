536153,ONE TIME DAVE,2003-12-26 07:49:00,110,":) I have been advised there is a shortcut from just East of LongLac leaving Rt 11 and going North to Nakina, bypassing Geraldton. Need HELP with this route. Thanks and have a great 2004 fishing."

I don't think it'll save you much time, and if you're pulling a boat, you probably want to avoid the gravel. I don't remember the road names, it's been a few years since I've been in that area, but the road that runs east to west goes on the south side of a lake called Burrows. If you have a map of the area, you'll be able to find it. If not, let me know and, I've still got maps in my basement."
