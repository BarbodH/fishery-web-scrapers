It has plenty of walleye but you must be good at catching walleye in dark, skinny water.The river in and out of the lake was fun to explore but didn't yield many fish. George runs a good outfit and will take care of you. Chuck c c"

The last time I went there, we were catching pike on every cast and it didn`t matter what you threw at them. All in the 4 to 7 pound range. There`s also decent walleye in the river, but you have to troll for them to find them as they seem to cruise up and down the river."
