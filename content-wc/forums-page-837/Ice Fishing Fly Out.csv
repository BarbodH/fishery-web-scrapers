536081,AL,2003-12-20 10:49:00,89,Being from the South my fishing buddies and me never have the opportunity to ice fish. We go on 1-2 fly ins each year in NW Ontario. I was wondering if there are outfitters that offer ice fishing on remote lakes whether it be by ski plane or snowmobile. Anyone know of anyplace? AL
