536110,Guest,2003-12-22 15:38:00,0,"I am wondering if anyone has any recommendations on places to stay for a long weekend in,or near Morson next spring? We cannot stay for an entire week so we may be limited to a motel. I have searched the web and have not been able to find any information concerning motels in the Morson area. Any help would be appreciated!! Thanks, Renn"
