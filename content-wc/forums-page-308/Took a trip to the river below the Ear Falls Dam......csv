Most of our bait was dead.A misunderstanding as to who was doing what and our bait got neglected.I let my wife fish with the remaining live leeches and I fished with a 3 way rig with a Jointed #9 Firetiger Jointed Rapala.Surprise,surprise I out fished her 3 fish to her 1 and my fish averaged bigger.Ran out of leeches and headed in. Regrouped,got some more leeches and headed for the river below the dam.A good friend gave me a little map but I ingored it and found a couple of current seams in 10 to 12 ft of water.There were lots of walleyes laying in there.We had a ball catching fat football shaped river walleyes.Finally ran out of bait. Headed back to the cabin. When we got back to Gawley's I decided to unhook the boat from the truck so I could clean the truck up some.I dropped the tongue of the boat trailer on the top of my left foot.It doesn't look like I broke any bones. My foot doesn't hurt except when I breath or my heart beats.I tried holding a cold Kokanee on it to prevent swelling but I ended up drinking it. Got to go clean a couple walleye for Cajun Blackened Walleye for supper.Bill,who sometimes does dumb stuff"
