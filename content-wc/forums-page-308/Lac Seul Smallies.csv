3090713,MorganMan,2014-08-14 18:24:00,341,"I have searched threads about catching smallies on Lac Seul and several talk about them as trash fish and what size is a trophy. I don't fish for them at all but have caught a few over the years. I am taking one of my sons this year and he loves to fish. Not just walleyes, but he likes bass fishing. With smallies, I know there are a lot of similarities with bait etc, but am wondering on Lac Seul what I need to do as far as targeting that species for him? We won't target them for the most part, but if anyone has any information that could help us grab a few, I would appreciate the info. He is 16 and is an avid fisherman. This is the last of the boys to go. I have 3 and the oldest loved the fly in trip, middle boy loved it but not a fisherman, and youngest is an avid fisherman. Next is my daughter......who can't wait to go, but I may need to manage that trip differently??"
3090921,Pooch,2014-08-14 20:04:00,4619,"The central part of Lac Seul seems to have a good population of smallies. We fish out of Mahkwa over Labor Day and seem to catch them while fishing for walleye whether trolling spinners or jigging. Stop and cast about any rock pile and there seems to always be a few cooperative bass there.Seems to be fewer smallmouth as you go west towards McKenzie, although there must surely be a few somewhere in that area. I've not targeted them so I have little information in that part of the lake., but others on this board will.Have a good and safe trip.Pooch"
3091521,SinOrSwim,2014-08-15 06:30:00,1528,"We will be staying at Onaway south of Ear Falls so the west side. The furthest we typically venture is Manitoba point or just south. So, if there are any areas aroudn Scout Bay, Bay of Islands or even South Bay that would be helpful. Especially Scout Bay area since he could probably go out for a bit in the evenings while we are cleaning fish and cooking.The key here is so our nephew can scout some places for Hawkfan and Me!!!!! LOLAlso, any really good places to target Northern on that side?"
3092001,Aspencreek,2014-08-15 09:14:00,2911,"Smallies....rock points, and sand humps off shore, and weed lines off the rock shorelines.Casting lipped baits banging the rocks will trigger strikes, but also pitching jigs with any king of ugly plastic and bouncing it along will trigger them. Smallies is all my grandson wants to fish for too. (He took a ball to the head playing baseball a few years ago, and I think it still is affecting him, Oh well) But they are fun!Any of the areas around Onaway that fit the description will hold smallies, but if I want to go after them in particular, try any of the islands in Scout bay and out to bay of islands. Also there are several spots in South islet that fit that description, particularly at the far south end by the waterfall, hit all the islands and points all the way down (that is a full day). The fun part is that part of LS sees relatively little traffic, is gorgeous, and you will catch plenty of walleyes to boot."
3092033,Aaron-IN,2014-08-15 09:24:00,500,"If you are going yet this summer I would focus on islands. Jig spinners, tube jigs, Senkos and a few topwater baits is all you need."
3092065,Carnhzkr,2014-08-15 09:41:00,964,I picked up several smallies one morning this summer in the South Inlet. There are boulders edging almost every island in that bay. We did well pitching cranks and Mepps toward the boulders on the first island you come to.
3092633,btmbncr,2014-08-15 13:06:00,492,"Been catching them in McKenzie Bay on shallow,like 4 ft deep rock piles.Some of the walleyes I cleaned had partially digested smallies in them.Bill"
3096617,MorganMan,2014-08-17 07:07:00,341,"Thanks for the help. Do smallmouth have certain times of the day when they bite more aggressively or the opposite? I imagine going after 'eyes' in the am, stopping for shore lunch, then targeting smallmouth before the evening 'eyes'??!!"
3097105,Aspencreek,2014-08-17 10:14:00,2911,"Good plan! Have a smallie rig set up, at the ready, any rocky point can hold them. We got into a pack of them on the north side of the island opposite the waterfall on the far south end of South Islet, from one end to the other and again along the rock face on the south side of that island. Then picked up some nice walleyes at each end along the weed lines, and don't forget to hit the long hump on the east side of the burned out island (full of blueberries). It is about 100yds long and runs east/SE starting about 50yds off the rock face of the burned out island, with the higher water it should come up to about 4-5' with 20-30' on the north and south sides with weeds on top. Actually those 3 islands can hold all sorts of fish, just cruise around and see what your finder shows you. Great spot for shore lunch too. Man I wish I could go!!!"
