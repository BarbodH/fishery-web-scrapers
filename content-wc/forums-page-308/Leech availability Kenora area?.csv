3102617,lassh,2014-08-19 05:29:00,553,I'm looking for some nice Jumbo leeches to pick up anywhere between FT. Francis and Kenora. Does anyone know where they might have a supply of nice sized leeches? I'll be heading up to LOW late next week.

3105497,lassh,2014-08-19 18:15:00,553,"Yes. They are tough to get at this time of year up there at this time of year, especially jumbo leeches. I was hoping someone had a line on a supply of them. Thanks all for the help, if you happen to find someone that will have some by 8/29 please reply to post. Good fishing guys and thanks again."
