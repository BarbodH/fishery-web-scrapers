3098337,unclepaully,2014-08-17 17:34:00,112,"Another great trip and report Mike! From what I gather Parks has bought out Air Dale and will be using White River Air for the flying, is that correct?"
3098361,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 17:52:00,1554,"According to my wife 45 is the new 25, but I have my doubts."
3098385,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 17:55:00,1554,"They have purchased the Air Dale camps. At the moment they're mostly using Hawk Air in Junction and Canadian Airventures in Chapleau. We flew in with WRA but I don't think that's the norm.Hopefully they'll get their own plane at some point, I know they've been talking about it."
3095169,Mike Borger,2014-08-16 12:53:00,1554,"Hey guys I just returned from a short 4 night stay to Air Dale's John's lake outpost in the Chapleau region. I've always been a big fan of Park's Fly In Fishing and they recently purchased all of the Air Dale camps in Hawk Junction. Several of the camps are classified as deluxe and I randomly chose John's as our destination. It turned out to be a great choice!Joining me on the trip was my fish crazed 7 year old son Brendan and two close friends with their young sons and we had an absolute blast!Weather was hot and sunny the entire time and because of that there were zero bugs (a first for me). We probably averaged 50 fish per boat per day and that was fishing at a very relaxed pace. Numerous walleye were caught in the 22-25"" range with the two biggest being 271/2"" and 291/2"" (with a tail pinch it probably would have hit 30). We also caught 3 pike over 40"" with the largest being 42. 90% of our fish were caught casting jigs and plastic around mid lake humps once we found them, bait was not required! Best plastic for my son and I was once again the 31/2"" Northland Impulse paddletail minnow in the electric chicken color. For whatever reason the walleye's love them!Camp was a beauty, perched on a rocky point overlooking the lake and neat and clean as a pin. It also had hot/cold running water and a shower which was most welcome.All in all it was almost a perfect trip!If you're interested you can see a detailed write up on the trip here complete with numerous photos and video clips:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/jo...-a-ton-of-fun/Cheers, Mike"
3095457,pikeandtina,2014-08-16 15:02:00,145,"Nice report, Mike!!!"
3095745,Kwags,2014-08-16 17:41:00,48,"Another great Solopaddler report! I can't decide what I am impressed by more- you and your son's fishing skills or the pictures and writing you produce. Always a pleasure to hear about your trips PS- please quit talking about those Impulse paddle tails. If everyone knows about them, I will lose my ability to sell at outrageous prices while in the bush!"
3095777,gordy28,2014-08-16 17:46:00,437,"Great report and awesome that you went with your son, friends and their sons It's funny I bet sales in paddle tail plastics have spiked since ur report from last fall I bought 6 packs today for our trip and typically I rarely jig lol"
3095953,Mike Borger,2014-08-16 19:07:00,1554,"Thanks guys, and yeah it's been getting harder for me to find those baits locally. I'm shooting myself in the foot. Gord please let me know how you make out when you get back from your trip and say hi to Dan for me when you get up there!Hope all goes well, I know you've been anticipating it for some time now!"
3096505,gordy28,2014-08-17 06:19:00,437,Will follow up for sure Mike. Will try ny hand at a Borger style report lol One question when you say you cast jigs to humps. Are you just casting to the structure and then reeling slowly back keeping contact with the bottom? I've mainly drifted jigs over structure in the past
3096657,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 07:26:00,1554,"If there's wind I'll drift with the jig trying to keep contact with bottom.When there's little to no wind I'll fire out a long cast, let it fall to the bottom and hop it back to the boat with small lifts/drops and pulls. Always trying to keep in contact with the bottom."
3098201,new hips,2014-08-17 16:31:00,498,Another great trip report.......some nice walleyes.Thanks for sharing
3098225,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-17 16:45:00,1460,What could possibly be better than to have your own 9 yr. old son cook the old man shore lunch over an open fire.
3098289,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 17:07:00,1554,How about your own 7 year old? (Brendan's only 7 )
