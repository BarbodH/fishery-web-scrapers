3097057,plumberjoe,2014-08-17 10:00:00,54,Im heading up up for the last week of Aug. for my 9th trip to Canyon. Always catch good numbers of walleye early morning and late evening. Primarily vertical jigging deep rock bars. Im not a musky fisherman but we try and manage to catch a few. We have a good time catching trout on nearby lakes that camp owners take us to. We stay at North Country Lodge.
