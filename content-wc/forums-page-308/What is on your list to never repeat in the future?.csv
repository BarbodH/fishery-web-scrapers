3103465,turtle chain,2014-08-19 08:33:00,1398,What about shore lunch we used to keep 2 each to take home right away and another 2 last day never had a problem on the water we fished.The place we fished on lac suel we could catch our take home fish off the dock what fun
3099745,MrSimon,2014-08-18 08:40:00,922,"Keeping fish on the stringer to take pics later is stupid. We all know that now. Back to the question. Things I won't do again: 1. Take so much dang tackle and misc. gear that never gets used 2. Camp next to a generator 3. Forget to tell my credit card company I'll be in Canada for a week 4. Say the words, ""Nah, I don't need sunscreen"""
3101417,yoopertrout,2014-08-18 17:43:00,1172,Fair enough. I was probably too harsh.
3101505,MorganMan,2014-08-18 18:00:00,341,"You were harsh. LOL, but it's also passion. The guy has to have a chance to change the way he does it and that's gonna take a year probably. Definitely has to get the point by now. Unfortunately we kept fish on a stringer for years before we knew it was illegal, but only the fish we intended to eat for the day. This site has opened our eyes to rules and regulations."
3101721,Dislocated,2014-08-18 18:53:00,27,"To the original question: Drive in or fly in, 1. Quality gear or redundant crappy stuff 2. Tolerance for differing opinions, habits and medications 3. A checklist completed before leaving the driveway 4. Hook sharpener and the actual use of it 5. Bump for calling the credit card company and sunblock ignorance"
3102209,Glenman12,2014-08-18 20:59:00,762,maybe Im missing something here but since when is it illegal to keep fish on a stringer that you plan to filet and eat/or take home?
3102673,biggamefisher,2014-08-19 05:40:00,540,"You are missing something, the issue was that some fish kept on the stringer all day were later released, while it may not be illegal, immoral IMO! What is illegal is having more fish in your possession than the daily limit, which also seems to have happened here, keep them all on a stringer so you can take a pic, then release what is necessary to stay within the daily possession or slot limit, immoral and illegal!Ask any Fisheries Biologist, they will not survive, also the recommendation of not releasing fish held on a stringer is in most angling regulations, guess some folks do not know that, hopefully a lesson learned for all."
3102697,forgop,2014-08-19 05:48:00,880,"If it gets your panties in any less of a wad, it was well under 2 hours, not ""all day"", but you can keep adding more to the story and conditions if it makes yourself feel any more holier in the process."
3102849,biggamefisher,2014-08-19 06:28:00,540,"No panties on this guy, wasn't starting anything, if my assumption was wrong so be it.........that being said, I don't know too many people that go on a fly-in and only fish for well under 2 hours a day."
3103353,Mohleye,2014-08-19 08:00:00,368,"To answer Glenman's question, on some lakes (lac Seul for instance) it's illegal to keep fish on a stringer. Any fish kept must be killed."
3103425,phishfearme,2014-08-19 08:22:00,1242,this statement is what glenman is responding to - this is certainly NOT illegal. phish
3097809,v-bay gord,2014-08-17 14:09:00,3168,"I don't want to flog it but just consider the fish was probably in 45 degree water where caught, not the surface temp of 60. Pulled through the water for a few hours with a rope through the gills (or wire through the jaw). In and out of the boat a few times and then a photo op. I'm sure they swam away fine but delayed mortality can be a big issue. It's nice to be able to document a successful trip but I would suggest reconsidering this approach....and as someone else pointed out, having a stringer full of big fish probably was in violation of a regulation (only one over 18 inches in possession, for example)."
3098425,jaym,2014-08-17 18:12:00,89,"Don't forget, the procession limit is four fish per license and after you fill your take home limit you run the risk of being busted anytime you bring in fish to eat."
3098433,yoopertrout,2014-08-17 18:13:00,1172,That's our approach too. I'd rather leave them in the lake than go through a hassle for a couple meals at home.
3098481,yoopertrout,2014-08-17 18:21:00,1172,"It should be flogged. It's frigging ridiculous to string a bunch of big fish for a picture that's apparently intended to convey ""This is stringer of fish we kept."" Phony baloney at the expense of the resource. I come at this from a background of trout and musky fishing where catch and release is unquestioned. When I went to a wilderness lodge this summer, we ate three meals of walleyes because that's how many meals of fish we wanted to eat (and the owner assured us that we'd be doing no damage to the resource.) We snapped a few quick pics of the big fish before we released them. We didn't eat two meals of fish every day for six days to be sure we ""got our money's worth"" any more than we would have eaten beef 12 times in six days. I'm stunned that someone would drag a bunch of big fish around all day for a phony stringer picture. I think it's a bull**** thing to do, and if I'm flogging the issue that's fine with me. I've never understood how people can do something that's completely asinine, and then the criticism gets aimed at those who call them on it. Plus, anyone who doesn't know about delayed mortality must have been frozen in a glacier for the last 30 years."
3098553,Aspencreek,2014-08-17 18:39:00,2911,"WOW, the guy asked a simple question then gets lambasted. The OP certainly knows now that his stringer of fish idea probably wasn't the smartest thing and that should be #1 on his list for his own question!!!"
3098577,dave macpherson,2014-08-17 18:51:00,7,Why would you keep fish on a stringer for picture purposes? Stupid!!!! Swimming off means nothing. Plenty of delayed mortality I am sure. No wonder Americans have such a bad name in Canada!
3098633,yoopertrout,2014-08-17 19:02:00,1172,This is a perfect example of the kind of person I mentioned - one who is more upset at someone being blunt than at someone who did something really selfish and hard on the resource. Don't you get that risking a bunch of fish for a glory photo is worse than calling someone on risking a bunch of fish for a glory photo? Really?
3098665,Glenman12,2014-08-17 19:13:00,762,"Im no marine biologist but my concern would that those bigger fish are breeding stock, as in females.."
3098689,v-bay gord,2014-08-17 19:22:00,3168,"It's all a learning curve....what's obvious to you isn't to others that may not have the same background or experience. The poster was obviously unaware of any ramifications with his actions or he wouldn't have been so honest with what had happened....so, I think cutting some slack is in order. It's a good post in that many others can learn from this. I would prefer that people can post and get some positive feedback rather than being made to feel foolish. We've all done stupid stuff in our fishing careers, and we haven't finished learning....here's to being better next time!"
3099161,wallydave,2014-08-18 04:47:00,2151,"Gord, thanks for clearing this up and making your point that this site is to share info that protect and promote intelligent fishing practices."
3096321,forgop,2014-08-16 22:49:00,880,"I'm returning from a great trip at Anjigaming Lake from Parks. This was just my 2nd fly-in and much better results than last year. Just conducting a review of what to do differently next time around and this is what I've jotted down. We had a couple of rough days and once we got on the fish, we hauled in wallys left and right. We took several stringer pics of them mostly in the 22-26"" range and throwing back the 18"" walleyes on Thursday and returned every last one of them. Fast forward to Friday, the wind changed directions several times and our jigging hotbed turned virtually dry. Thus, we packed out with less than our limit. Next time around, I'll pack my limit early and never go to the last day fighting like **** to take home just 4 fish. After a hook in the finger incident thanks to a pike, I'm also going to start wearing gloves of some sort in the boat. From hooks, line, or teeth, my hands are hurting pretty badly. The boats we used had relatively short ropes for the anchor. It would have been nice to anchor in 20-35' of water rather than drifting and having to move back all the time. I'll also bring along some marker buoys so after landing several fish in an area, you can pretty much shut off the fish finder. It's much faster to visually go to the buoys every time than relying on that 5"" black and white screen. Line and leaders: I used 10# Power Pro braid and size 10/12 barrel swivels. I had 3 swivels cone apart at the top hook, so no more of those. I hauled in a fat 33""/10 # northern with the line/swivel without any issue. Two days later in virtually the same spot, I was jigging and something went off with my line that made the northern look like he didn't even take out any line compared to this. I was just loosening my drag just a bit more about 2 minutes into the fight when the line snapped (no swivel as I started direct tying to the jig). Either I need to go back to mono or I'm going to use something more in the 15-20# range for braid. Such a heartbreak because this fish was even bigger for sure. What other takeaways do you make sure not to repeat?"
3096377,NickDalasio,2014-08-17 04:04:00,34,"Fish anywhere near the mayfly hatch, which probably means not scheduling a trip from mid-June to mid July. I've had 2 mediocre trip to lakes that were supposed to be hot, both times had to fight hard just to have a few meals & scratch out a limit. I know you can try imitating mayflies by fishing 1/3 piece of worm on a jig, using minnow bodies with tail & head removed, or by using plastic mayfly imitations, but none of these tricks worked for me."
3096401,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 04:43:00,1554,"Duane power pro will break if it's nicked. Most likely you abraided it close to the jig dragging it over rocks. You need to check it constantly and retie often.Personally I'd never tie 10lb power pro directly to my jig. (lighter stuff yes, but not 10lb). Always use a 10-12lb fluoro leader, it's less visible and more abrasion resistant."
3096409,Mike Borger,2014-08-17 04:44:00,1554,Swivels should not be coming apart either. You must be using some pretty cheap ones.Buy some good ones and you won't have that problem again.
3096433,v-bay gord,2014-08-17 05:42:00,3168,"Not to be a smart aleck, but keeping big fish on a stringer (mid summer) just to take pics and then release would be one thing I would put on my ""do not repeat' list..."
3096441,Slushfish,2014-08-17 05:44:00,263,"It's an unwritten rule with our bunch, we take no fish home. We eat all we want while we are there. You'd be surprised how much hassle and grief it saves. Especially on years when we get a different mix of people that go.We have enough fish in the freezer, it's not worth the hassle over four more. Plus, it can be a nightmare trying to keep track of how many fish are in camp if six or eight, even a dozen people."
3096449,Slushfish,2014-08-17 05:47:00,263,"V-bay is right about stringing big fish. Not a good idea and, I believe, illegal."
3096521,Skywagon,2014-08-17 06:23:00,1106,"forgop obviously did not realize about all the fish he stressed/probably eventually died, by keeping them on a stringer for pictures (not once, but multiple times), or he would not have posted it. Hopefully he will now be aware of how bad an idea that is."
3096593,octanehi5,2014-08-17 06:51:00,1104,"The guys are right about keeping fish to take pictures,big no no.Take your pics as soon as posible,return fish to the lake.Start saving your fish for the trip home early,once you get your limit you can return them all. It takes a long time to produce fish in the 20""+ range. How you fish and the line you use is your busness, what ever works for you. Buying top quality equipment is key. Never return to a lake that did not produce fish, no matter what the outfitter says"
3097737,forgop,2014-08-17 13:35:00,880,"The fish were rarely out of water between back trolling and drifting over a period of less than 2 hours in 60 degree temps, not keeping them all day long in high temps. We kept a close eye on them and they swam off fine. I can understand the concern though."
