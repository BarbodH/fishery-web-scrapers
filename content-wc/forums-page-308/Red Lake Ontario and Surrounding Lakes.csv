Some fellow campers tried some of the portage lakes, good numbers, not many big fish though. Have you tried the search function? Good luck!"
3103081,bergsh,2014-08-19 07:18:00,183,"Hi Dave, Yeah I have done some searches. Wondering if this year is different than previous years? Always looking for what worked for others on the lake and of course hoping to hear news of a good bite. I read your groups postings of the fishing at Black Bear. Great detail and a fun read. Awesome trip it sounds like. Shawn"
3103345,wallydave,2014-08-19 08:00:00,2151,"We mostly jig and minnow fished, tried some slip bobbers and trolling cranks. windy shore lines and cloudy windy days had the best results. Mainly a morning ,evening bite. Let us know how you did!"
3103689,tjandy,2014-08-19 09:40:00,107,"Just got back from Nungesser last week. The fishing was excellent. Jigging or worm harness, could catch fish all day in 16'-21' of water and got the big fish in 24'-28' of water. Blue or red tails, tipped with a piece of crawler, worked for me."
3105409,bboehm,2014-08-19 17:15:00,7,Heading up to Red Lake on the 30th and will fish mostly East half and maybe a trip down in to Keg and Gull Rock. Will post up results when we get back. We normally go in June but some years when that doesn't work we go in early Sept. Usually best luck this time of year in about 25 to 30ft with jig n minnow. We don't like to troll around the lake unless we absolutely have to.
