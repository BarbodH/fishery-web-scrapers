3093505,wallydave,2014-08-15 19:27:00,2151,Breezy was celebrating his 50th year of Canada trips! Red Lake is part of a circle of flowage that spans most of NW Ontario. Great guy to learn from!
3093745,pjshorthorn,2014-08-15 21:10:00,5654,"Wallydave has summed up our trip pretty well, but I'll add a few comments to fill in the memories that I took away from a great week at BBL with my son and new friends.8/1: Flew from Atlanta to Winnipeg and stopped in V-bay for the evening. I had sent V-Bay Gord a message the week before that we may stop in to see his lodge since we were staying the night in V-Bay. We found the lodge and showed up unannounced..., we walked in the lodge office and introduced ourselves. The first thing Gord asked was, can I get you a beer or something else to drink . We had a nice visit and the opportunity to see a cabin and the boats that V-Bay has to offer on Eagle Lake. Very nice place and one of the lodges on my list to visit in the future.We tried to have a sit down dinner at Buster's BBQ, but it was full. They take reservations and on a Friday evening at 6 pm it was busy. Not a problem.. we placed a take out order and walked over to Bobby's Corner to get our fishing licenses while they prepared our take out order. While getting our licenses, we were able to chat with the owner of Bobby's. We had a nice time talking about my time fishing Lac Seul out of Hudson/Sioux Lookout. He grew up in Hudson and has a lot of knowledge about that area of Lac Seul. If you don't have it, he does. Tackle shop is phenomenal. If you don't need it, you'll probably buy something anyway.Dinner was great and sleep came early on the first day of our adventure to Red Lake.8/2: Rainy morning and the type of day that would call walleye fisherman out of the rack early. We headed north on the 105 towards Red Lake with just a few ideas of what we were going to experience on this trip. Once we arrived, we walked towards the lodge and there is Breezy Point and Wallydave walking up from the dock for a lunch break. With a couple of handshakes and "" how has fishing been ?"", it seemed like we already knew one another.We unpacked gear, strung rods and headed out after our camp orientation. Without knowing anything about the lake, since this was our first visit to BBL and Red Lake, we took a left out of the bay from camp and dropped minnows. The son caught a 23 1/4"" walleye in the first 10 minutes. I'm thinking, he is ruined.....nice one already. We headed in for dinner after a couple of hours and had an great spaghetti dinner. The couple of hours fishing after dinner was nice ,but the best part of the day was sitting on the front porch of the cabin getting to know Wallydave and BreezyPoint. Wallydave hooked us up with the lakefront view. And the story telling started !!!!!8/2:First full day of fishing and my fish locator is not working Oh well, Stickman ( to be explained later) and I went ""old school"" on trying to find fish.....shorelines and points...except there wasn't a whole lot of wind. We had an exploratory day. BBL is a great place to catch up with everyone in the evening at dinner to share information and get to know one another. It is a community atmosphere. At dinner, BreezyPoint mentions that he found a nice shelf that dropped off into 25 fow on his locator so I decided to go check that out after dinner as this is a favorite structure of mine when walleye fishing. We anchored up and literally on the first cast towards shore.....fish on after 15 seconds. Once I realized this wasn't just a nice walleye, I lost a lot of line on the first run. Now I'm thinking, Oh Sheet, this is a northern. Now, I've never caught many big northern, but I realized I was in for a problem. I was fishing a 5'-6"" UL rod with 8 lb test line. She took some epic runs where the wake was visible going away from the boat...quickly....... with line peeling off and I'll I could think of was backing down on the fish with the motor to gain line back. After about a 20 minute tug of war, we landed the beauty and I realized that I would probably not experience that type of battle again. 44"" and somewhere around 25 lbs. She was released for another fight in the future.When we got in, BreezyPoint asked how we did and I just said "" It was slow, we only got five fish but one was nice Another night of front porch sitt'in telling stories. By this time, I'm loving this place.8/3:At breakfast, BreezyPoint and Wallydave are pretty interested in a comment I had made when we were communicating over the winter that everyone earns a nickname on a Canadian trip. They wanted to know my son's nickname ( 19 yr old now) and he said Loonie. He won a lot of bets for first fish, biggest fish, most fish on his first trip when he was 10; all paid off in Loonies. I mentioned that his first indoctrination to a Canadian trip at 10 was to make sure the toilet on the houseboat didn't get backed up.....his great uncle took him out to find a nice sturdy stick to plunge the holding tank every day. ""Stickman"" came up a few times during the trip after that.Fishing was slow during the day, but the evening bite was good again on the same shoreline. Stickman hooked a nice fish on the same drop that we fished the night before. Before I was aware that he had a nice fish on, there was already one wrap around the anchor rope. As I'm pulling up the anchor and Stickman's rod being passed under the rope...I'm thinking this fish is gone. Second run, the fish goes around the anchor rope again while I'm still pulling up 30 ft of rope. It was a circus and the fishing gods were shining on us as we landed that fish on the same type of UL rod and 8 lb test. It was a personal best 28""+ walleye for my son.Now we are both ruined.... in the first two days. Dinner was hearty with dogs, burgers and beans. Take your choice on one of each or two of one kind.The first campfire was built and more stories told that night!!8/4:The group headed NE towards Wolf Bay and Wolf Narrows in the morning, which was new spot for everyone. With little luck in a smaller narrows early on, Breezy found a point going into Wolf Bay with good structure and suggested we fish it. He could see stuff on his locator I couldn't. We caught some nice walleyes on a slow drift. That location is now ""Breezy Point"" on my Red Lake map.In the evening, I fished the entrance to Hall Bay and surrounding shorelines. No big fish , but enough to keep us out till dusk.Second half of the trip report to follow tomorrow.PjShorthorn"
3093801,SinOrSwim,2014-08-15 21:36:00,1528,Some nice fish there and fun report to read. Looking forward to part 2
3094329,wallydave,2014-08-16 07:20:00,2151,"Pat, nice job of capturing the memories of our trip! Looking forward to the rest of the story!"
3094505,revitup,2014-08-16 08:07:00,140,Glad to hear you all had a great week of fishing and the added benefit of getting to increasing your number of friends. Shows one of the values of this website! Sounds like your choice of lodge is a winner and personally I would look at the sharing of food duties as another way of getting to know new people and adding to the enjoyment of the week. Thanks for sharing.
3095129,pjshorthorn,2014-08-16 12:21:00,5654,"Sorry for the break in the trip report. I was falling asleep while typing last night!!! 8/5:We headed back to Wolf Bay in the morning and stopped at the "" Breezy Point"" first where I picked up a nice 24"" walleye along with some really solid 17"" eaters that we kept for dinner. On Sunday morning at breakfast the entire group in camp decided to have a fish fry and tonight was the night!!!. Everyone signed up for duties and it was a true community event. The best part is that everyone helped and between cooking and cleaning up, no one invested more than 10-15 minutes of their time and had a great walleye/pike dinner. In the afternoon, Ben and I went to Trout Falls to see the waterfall coming into Trout Bay. Frank and Dave had pretty good success on Saturday so we thought that may be a good spot to fish before dinner. The spot was just beautiful and the fish were right in the turbulent pools where the falls dumped into the bay. The guys warned us that there were a ""few"" snags.......I estimate that there is enough terminal tackle and jigs at the bottom where, if a fella went scuba diving, they would never buy another jig again! We caught some nice fish under 19"". When we pulled the anchor there was about 3 or 4 lures hanging off of it!!! I believe one evening WallyDave caught a nice 22"" walleye in the same spot. As we headed back to camp for dinner, we stopped at an old mining museum the community established on the lake to memorialize the gold mining history on Red Lake. It was quite a nice log cabin with some interesting details on the history.After another great dinner, we headed back to our go to spot for the evening bite. As Dave mentioned in his post, if you went away hungry from dinner it was your own fault. Since Sunday we had been trying to talk Frank into fishing with us in the same spot we caught our personal bests. Frank REALLY didn't like the idea of invading someone else's spot, but we finally wore him down . As we were fishing, Frank called over and asked if he could troll between us and the shoreline. I said, absolutely. There is plenty of room. Frank says to me, "" No, you are supposed to say no. That isn't polite to run through someone's spot."" Frank REALLY doesn't like to be rude on the water.....a true gentlemen on and off the water. We all hooked a few more in the evening. This shoreline had a tremendous eagle's nest in a birch tree and we were visited by Bucky Beaver swimming by each evening. Stickman and I headed in around 8:30 pm to get campfire #2 started for the evening story session. Steve and Will Adamski joined us again around the fire to also contribute some of their blood to the mosquitos. Dave's stogies weren't much help in keeping them away from us, but I did notice that he wasn't swatting too much!!! The evening before we saw a very faint showing of the northern lights and it was pretty neat to see the young guys experience their first sighting. We were blessed with a better viewing this evening, but not brilliant enough to call them spectacular. Around midnight it was time to call it a night. Another great day at Red Lake in the books.8/6: After a great breakfast of bacon, eggs, english muffins, coffee and orange juice we all headed out to try our luck with pulling crank baits on the southern shoreline of Red Lake close to Muskrat Bay. We didn't have much success on cranks, but on the way I stopped to fish a couple of points and picked up a nice 32"" northern and a 24"" walleye. We saw a merganser duck family with momma leading a group of at least two dozen ducklings. I can only imagine how fast those little feet were paddling below the water. We fished our way back to camp and took our normal lunch break on the porch at the cabin. After regrouping, we headed out to islands and narrows leading to Trout Bay and/or the Bow Narrows camp area. This was an exploratory trip,but on the map it looked "" fishy"". Our boat caught one small snake and the other fellas caught maybe one small walleye. All we can say about that is.....""we explored and got humbled"" . Before dinner we all made a stop around Hall Bay and the next experience of a lifetime took place. As we were sitting in the quiet of a peaceful afternoon, you could hear the drone of a plane in the distance. I thought it was just another bush plane off in the distance heading back into Red Lake. It wasn't long after that a large yellow plane came skimming over the tree tops and then right past us. It took a minute to grab the camera and realize that this was a water bomber plane used to fight forest fires. I got a couple of pictures before it disappeared behind trees, but you could still hear it in the distance. Sure enough, it made another pass and we were ready with the camera as she passed and then dumped a load of water out in the middle of the lake. After a couple of more passes, the plane came over the trees even lower and headed directly at our boat. I realized that the pilot probably had seen us taking multiple pictures on each pass and decided to give us a better show. It wasn't until I heard the doors on the belly of the plane start to open up that the show included getting wet. Yup, they dumped the whole load of water about 30 yds from our boat. I was so dumfounded that I forgot to turn my camera on and missed the shot of the water dropping. I caught the aftermath with the whole lake looking like it was in a fog with the water spray surrounding us. It is hard to explain how surreal it was to be in a remote area and to have an enormous water bomber show up doing maneuvers and then give you a bath. As they say, "" he definitely buzzed the tower"".The aerial show was a topic of discussion at dinner as another group in camp had the same experience on a different part of the lake and Wallydave and BreezyPoint had a good view of the show as well.Dinner was "" taco night"" with all the fixings. Your choice was either a small soft taco shell or a large soft taco shell. Since fishing makes a person hungry, I opted for the large shell ( probably 12"" in diameter) stuffed with everything and it rivaled any Tex-Mex I had while living in Houston for years. I'm not sure I was hungry the next morning for breakfast.Back out to Hall Bay for the evening while Frank and Dave headed towards the narrows west of camp. They actually had pretty nice fishing in a spot where the fish were concentrated and picked up 20 or so fish up to 19-20"". Our evening was a little slower, but we explored Hall Bay on a tip from one of the other groups that had good success the night before. Unfortunately, we couldn't replicate their success. At dusk we made the 10 minute run back to camp and got campfire #3 going. The intel from Jim was that the northern lights had a good potential to be pretty bright this evening so the campfire boys set up for an evening of ribbing one another, finding out what is really said in each other's boat during the day ( thanks Dave for the good stories about Frank and his ""patience progression"" throughout the week while fishing eyes), more stories, getting to know one another better and how we all have grown into having this passion for Canada and fishing. BreezyPoint continued to try and get Stickman to bite....on anything......no success. We learned more about Steve and Will's father/son trips to remote camps. They have the coolest routine of choosing a new place every year and taking a true adventure. At 13, Will has seen more different lodges than I have in over 30 years of going to Canada. That is inspiring to see another young person is carrying the passion. We all talked about how important we felt it was to engage our youth in the outdoors and let them decide if it would be a life long interest. BreezyPoint is taking his daughter on a trip to Lac Seul in a couple of weeks for a father/daughter trip for his 3rd trip this summer. How cool is that!!!!Thanks to Frank, he inadvertently helped us see a great northern lights show by nursing his beer later into the evening. He said we can't go to bed yet, I'm not done with my beer. At one point he looked at the size of my can and said, ""Why is the size of my can so much bigger than yours?"". When I told Frank he had bought tall boys he said, "" no wonder I was feeling a little loopy last night when I had two"".......more laughter ensued. We saw a brilliant green light show that lasted at least 15 minutes. I think each of us were in awe of how this phenomena takes place and to see it again was outstanding. When the lights left it was time for another restful night at BBL.8/7:Last day of fishing for Frank and Dave as they would be leaving Friday morning to beat the border crossing rush on Saturdays. This morning was more of a classic walleye weather day. We had wind, cloud cover and the chance of rain. Finally!!!! After a week of high skies, little wind and a touch of sunburn on Stickman's ears and hands, I was ready for a change. At breakfast, Jim told us that with the SE wind there was only one place he would fish this morning and that was in a small bay on Pipestone Bay. He said we may only catch 7 or 8 fish, but they would be bigger fish. We all agreed to try a new spot and make the 30 minute run. Pipestone Bay is a pretty big body of water within the Red Lake system and has holes close to 140 ft deep. When we got to the bay, the wind was light due to high bluffs protecting the bay so a trolling motor was necessary or , in my case, kicking the camp boat motor in and out of gear.It took 30 minutes to find the fish, but once we did it was a fast bite up until around noon and then the fish just shut down. Stickman got a 25 1/2"", 23 1/2"" and a few nice eater size that were all released. WallyDave and Frank quickly filled out their conservation limits to take home for a smoked walleye dinner when they got to Breezy's place Friday evening. Somehow Frank was now comfortable with two boats fishing in a smaller space where the fish were biting. Wink Wink. It really worked out well.One note for anyone that fishes the Red Lake area; the regs are very different than other areas of Ontario. You are only allowed one fish over 18"" regardless of your license type. On many Ontario lakes there is a slot limit along with the opportunity to keep one over 21"". There is no slot limit on Red Lake just a quantity limit with 18"" being the magic number on one larger fish.We fished for a little bit on another point with only one 18"" walleye and a couple of small northern. Around 1:30 pm a storm had started to blow in so we made tracks for camp ahead of the rain and lighting. The rest of the afternoon was full of relaxing on the porch until dinner time while the storm blew over.Ah, dinner.......homemade lasagna with salad, garlic bread and fruit. The pan of lasagna reportedly weighed 20 lbs. Nice!!!!After a quick group cleanup of dinner dishes we were back on the water by 6 pm for the evening bite. We each headed back to spots where we had success and the bite was good with the weather change. Check out the blog on BBL's website and you'll see some monster perch Jim caught within sight of the camp. As Ben and I fished our honey hole, a small storm passed in the distance and we had the most brilliant rainbow before us with a faint double. Fellas reported seeing a triple at one point. The brightest rainbow I've ever seen.....another first on this trip.!!!The weather cleared, we caught more solid fish in the evening and campfire#4 was ready at dusk.8/8:Friday - the fishing portion of the trip was over for Frank and Dave with a 10 hour journey ahead of them to Breezy's place in Minnesota. We said our goodbyes after breakfast and wished them safe travels. Today was a complete goof off day for Ben and I . Fish a little, take a boat ride all the way to the back of large bays we hadn't explored, found the former camp owner's cabin across the bay from camp, nap for the young lad while I shot pictures of camp and finally solving the mystery of "" where does a bear pee?""Friday is steak night with baked potato and salad. I'm not sure I could have cooked my steak as well as they prepared it if I had been at home.With only 8 minnows left, we decided to stay right in the bay where the camp is located. No sense running around since we still had to pack up tonight for the trip tomorrow. Wouldn't you know it, we found a very small area where the bay necked down to a width of 60-70 yds. and there were the fish. Before you know it we are out of minnows and then we went to some nice Sirmanski jigs with paddletail bodies that Mike Kansas put together for us - ""Red Lake Special "" is the name we coined the ensemble of jigs he made for us. We never got to the main body of the lake and boated 30 fish with many being in the 17-19"" size. It made me take pause and wonder how many fish we ran over running out to other spots each evening. It will be a go to spot the next time we visit!!!!The rest of the evening was filled with packing up for our trip back to Winnipeg the next morning. Sniff Sniff 8/9:Two tired fishermen headed out of BBL down the 12 mile gravel logging road with a ton of memories from a wonderful week of fishing, new friendships and another true adventure. We pulled into Winnipeg, grabbed a quick shower and since the son is old enough in Canada- I took him to a casino so he could leave a few more Loonies and Toonies to bolster the Ontario economy a smidge more. We each set a limit of $100. We met after an hour and Ben is down 7 bucks playing slots and I was down $10 bucks playing blackjack. We decided to meet up again an hour later. When we met, the kid had a smirk on his face and I asked how he did. "" I'm up $75 bucks. Good, I said. I'm up $ 100 so we are outta here""!!!. Another first of leaving a casino with two people up!!! Back to the hotel for dinner and the last restful night in Canada.8/10:0330 wake up for our flight back to Atlanta via Minneapolis. Note to self.....US Customs doesn't open until 5 am at the airport....Could have slept longer!!After 9 days we made it back home safe and sound. Mission accomplished.I can't think of a better trip than I had to Canada this year. There were so many things that made it the best.- Spending a full 10 days with my son and having absolutely no distractions from normal stressors of work and life in general- Meeting so many new people at a new camp. This was the most relaxed atmosphere I've ever experienced with other fishermen in camp.- Everyone truly just wanted to help each other out whether it be at meal times, fishing spots, experiences about past trips or just talking about common interests.- Northern lights, water bomber fly-bys, personal bests on fish, campfires with new friends.- Being out fished by my son almost every day.Priceless.I can't thank WallyDave and BreezyPoint enough for coordinating the trip, doing some grocery shopping, bringing an extra cooler, picking up some hard to find spoons in the South, etc. for a couple of guys they had never met before prior to our first day in camp. Thanks for allowing Ben and I to share a wonderful week with you at BBL. I'm hopeful we will have future trips together to talk about.P.S. Frank, I'll bring the tall boys for ya. You just bring the storiesTight Lines,PjShorthorn"
3098145,BreezyPoint,2014-08-17 16:21:00,1581,"If I am not mistaken, Pat caught his big northern on one of these jigs. Pat, can you verify?Frank"
3098249,SinOrSwim,2014-08-17 16:52:00,1528,"Great, just great. Hawkfan got a bag of ""specials"" for our trip to Lac Seul. We may have to have them confiscated at the border. LOL"
3101969,pjshorthorn,2014-08-18 19:47:00,5654,"Yup. The son caught his big walleye on a standup jig in orange and I caught my big northern on a 1/4 oz bullet head. We were walleye fishing and I happened to cast in front of a very hungry northern. Wouldn't trade the experience that evening in for anything. We did lose a lot of jigs, but that is jigg'in on UL rods and lighter line. PjShorthorn"
3095569,BreezyPoint,2014-08-16 16:17:00,1581,"Ok, Dave and Pat pretty much told the entire story of the trip so I will just add a few touches. First of all, I was pretty apprehensive about taking a trip with some guys I had never met before, but after researching everyone's posts, I thought I would give it a go. I couldn't have made a better choice. Dave, Pat, and his son turned out to be great fishing partners, very upright and caring about the resource. Hopefully I will be able to fish with them again! I would recommend them as partners in a heartbeat.Kudos to Dave for his patience with me. I had to overcome my run and gun mentality I developed as a muskie fisherman and Dave managed to slow me down enough to work spots more thoroughly. This paid off in a lot more fish. He also let me try my Lake of the Woods crank bait techniques, which produced some fish, but the lake's structure is not really conducive to this. Most fish were caught on very narrow shelves with steep drops that were not very good for trolling crank baits.A little more about the camp. The hosts, Jim and Jillian were just plain awesome. They were personable and shared a great deal of information about the fishing. The American plan program they have made the trip easy without all the fuss over the food. Contrary to what I have read here before, if you go hungry, it's your own fault. The food was great with a true home cooked touch.The facilities were rustic but very reminiscent of my early days fishing in Canada. It was quite fitting for a 50th anniversary trip. The way meals were served encouraged people to talk with one another and share fishing stories and information. I thought I saw more openness and information sharing in one week than I have seen in all of my prior trips put together. This made for a truly great experience.The shared duties help keep the costs down and the overall time that took was far less than when you prepare your own food and the hassle factor was much lower. You can probably catch more fish in places like Lac Seul, but the fishing was good and the overall experience was great.I will post a few pics in a couple of days.Frank"
3097505,BreezyPoint,2014-08-17 12:29:00,1581,A couple of photos from our trip... Trout Falls Dave with a fat walleye from Trout Falls Nice rainbow
3097513,BreezyPoint,2014-08-17 12:34:00,1581,Dave was so proud of his Sirmanski (aka Mike Kansas) jigs that he even wore this hat to bed. These jigs are great and do not discriminate against any fish. Here is one of Dave's Red Lake Special walleyes. These jigs are also designed to increase revenue for Mike with their special attraction to Northern Pike!
3098113,wallydave,2014-08-17 16:06:00,2151,"For several years I have been using Sirmanski Jigs with great results! Last year Mike Kansas, owner of Sirmanski Jigs joined me at BBL. We had plenty of ""ammo"" to try on Red Lake! This year Pat contacted Mike, and he made up the now famous ""Red Lake Special"" jig assortment! As you can tell Sirmanski jigs catch the big ones!"
3088585,wallydave,2014-08-14 08:48:00,2151,"Thanks to share a seat a group of 4 met at Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake for a weeks worth of fishing, making new friends and memories! Just a year ago Mike Kansas and I explored Red Lake. This year like last year it was mostly a morning and evening bite. This year we had more wind, clouds good walleye weather plus a couple calm blue sky days! But first the group, Breezy Point aka Frank and pjshorthorn aka Pat and his son Ben signed on for this trip via share a seat. For many months we messaged and emailed back on forth to get to know each other. Frank and his wife Christi opened their home to me for a nights sleep on both ends of the trip. Their hospitality was fantastic! Frank was celebrating 50 years of fishing Ontario this year! He has so many stories to tell! If LOW ever needs to hire a publicist Frank is their man! Pat is another man with many years of fishing, both fresh and saltwater trips so even more stories were shared at breakfast or around the evening campfire! Frank and I were able to arrive on Friday afternoon thanks to the flexibility of Jim and Jillian the lodge owners. That meant Saturday morning we had the lake to ourselves! Time to explore Red Lake in Franks 16.5ft Alumacraft! We tried a long ride to Trout Falls at the west end of Trout Bay. After many years fishing the Wenasaga rapids NW end of LS, this is my comfort zone! A cloudy wet day, just what walleyes like! The action was pretty good! Plenty of 18-20 in walleyes! We quickly went through our 2 dozen minnows! The action slowed so we moved on the explore and look for pike. Pat and Ben joined us later that day. The depth finder they brought didn't work! That minor setback didn't slow them down one bit! They would end up with personal best big fish catches! Pat landed and released a fat 44in pike on an ultralite! Nor to be undone by his dad Ben put a 28.5 in walleye in their camp boat! Both fish are still swimming! A nod to Jim and Jillian they printed out nice cards for Pat and Ben with their big fish! Nice touch! Part of the charm of BBL is how the guests all help with the meals and the whole camp fish fry! A smaller number of fishermen that week meant everyone pitched in to do dishes and clean up after the meals in the lodge! I could go on about the fishing, the campfire stories, watching the Northern lights, meeting Will and Steve, 42 and his son, and the pleasure of meeting Frank Pat and Ben but I will let them fill in the blanks! BBL is a unique place on a pretty good fishery, if your ready to try rustic and a new lake give this place some thought! Thank! Dave"
3089865,Larry Mac,2014-08-14 14:19:00,530,"Hi Wallydave, Very Nice report. It looks like you and your group had another great trip at BBL. Love your reportThank youLarry Mac"
3091209,bboehm,2014-08-14 22:55:00,7,"Great report on Red Lake. Heading up there in a couple weeks. Curious if you fished at all around McKenzie Island or east of there into east bay, hoyles bay etc.."
3091289,wallydave,2014-08-15 04:46:00,2151,"BBL is on the west end of Red Lake, so we mainly fished Trout, Wolf, Pipestone bays. Where you fishing from? As noted on another thread, the fish this year were thick and healthy! Good luck!"
3091985,Mike Kansas,2014-08-15 09:04:00,1463,Great report Dave. Wish I could have been with you guys. Sounds like you all did better than we did last year. Mike Kansas
3092537,HeHooksHimself,2014-08-15 12:27:00,725,Dave great report. BBL is on our radar. Were you aware ahead of time that you would be expected to help in the kitchen/ JK Hooks
3092825,IaDave,2014-08-15 14:17:00,476,Did you get more that one hot dog? LOL
3092905,wallydave,2014-08-15 14:27:00,2151,"The dinner in question consisted of one smoked sausage, burger patty or two of either, with all the sides. If you walked away hungry, it was your own fault."
3092913,wallydave,2014-08-15 14:36:00,2151,"Hooks this was my second trip to BBL, I read a question about this camp a couple of years ago, I PM'd some guys that had been there, so I was aware of the meal plan and helping to serve and or clean up. This years trip had fewer guys in camp, so instead of signing up for KP duty, everyone just pitched in. If you are used to housekeeping packages, their plan is pretty good, the cooking time is gone, all you do is clean some dishes, pots and pans or wipe down some tables.Both my trips have been in August, so the fishing was a little slow, reports from spring trips seem to have better numbers, both in fish and fishermen. August has been a nice time to fish and having less traffic on the water. PM me anytime if you have any questions!"
3092985,lassh,2014-08-15 15:04:00,553,I'm glad you had another great trip shared with some Walleye Central brethren. You got to fish with Breezy Point? Thats awesome!
