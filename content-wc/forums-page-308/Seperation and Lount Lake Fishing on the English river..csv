3102481,hiwayman,2014-08-18 23:55:00,201,Stayed at the Marina at Grassy narrows or at a campsite on Indian for many years. Always fished up river. Did make it into fox a couple times but this year was the first trip out into Lount. Had some fantastic fishing in the south and southeast bays for both northern and walleye.
3103737,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-19 09:48:00,13,This map should help you. Are you camping on the Island just East of Lount Lake Camp because the the 400 is about one ( 2 ) miles down river from there witch flows in to Separation Lake.
3105761,Dorado,2014-08-19 19:25:00,5,What is bowling ball rock? Would love to know. Wish I could have joined you there to learn more.
3106729,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-20 06:23:00,13,"I would love to guide you there any time. I had some customers I guided every summer for over 12 years on Lount Lake. But right now I will help as much as I can this way. Bowling ball is about 3 miles E. of Lount Camp, you will pass a Island with a camp site, keep to the left after passing this going East, ""up river"" you will come to a long strait run with a large round rock jutting out by it's self, good Walleye spot. Good luck. Roy"
3109049,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-20 16:35:00,74,I believe that is on the way to wolf point ...correct?
3109369,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-20 18:29:00,13,"Not familiar with the name, or even know where Wolf point might be."
3109721,Dorado,2014-08-20 19:33:00,5,"Thanks again for the info. If I make it there, I will definitely find the rock. Your advice is greatly appreciated."
3094137,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-16 05:57:00,13,"Yes I have, from Gassy Narrows Reserve to Halley's Out Post Camp. Don't know what your fishing out of,"" we used 18 ft Lund boat 18 Mercury motor. and we all ways trowed back wards 95 % of the time, better control of boat and a slower trowel in the faster waters any way."
3095513,Dorado,2014-08-16 15:49:00,5,Nice advice. 400 hole should be an adventure worth having.
3095841,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-16 18:14:00,13,My family when we run Lount Lake Camp.
3096185,thunderatwork,2014-08-16 20:55:00,79,"MR LOUNT, would that picture be at the ""old"" lount lake camp that Bill Krylok had something to do with in the early to mid 90's ? If so i stayed there twice , '95 and '97--- fishing was always great. at that time Claude and his wife Evonette were there- both newfies, i think. great people"
3096457,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-17 05:48:00,13,"Yes your spot on, Crash Krylok as he was better known did run that camp for a few years, the owner we worked for was Bill Kozak who also owned Tetu Lodge. We ran that camp for 8 years with great success I might add."
3096681,Dorado,2014-08-17 07:46:00,5,You have to be familiar with fishing the islands on the south side of the lake. Any suggestions there?
3098369,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-17 17:52:00,13,"From the 400 in to south Lount Lake and East to the bowling ball rock holds the best Walleye fishing you could ever want. If you know the fish and it's habits ! No matter where you fish, your in moving water, it's a river !!"
3098569,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-17 18:44:00,13,The map of South Lount Lake.
3098585,Dorado,2014-08-17 18:56:00,5,Very nice of you to share the information. Sounds great. Can't wait to check it out.
3099289,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-18 06:05:00,13,"The islands of south Lount Lake are great fishing not only Walleye but Small mouth Bass also, look for weeds off the rocky tips of Islands. There is a reef I have marked the map in South Lount to fish, low water you will see it but high water it's under 10 to 12 inc. fish the East end at the drop off for nice fish, quite a few 8 and 10 lb Walleyes came from there. Good luck. Roy"
3082329,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-12 12:25:00,13,"My wife and I operated Lount Lake Camp on the English River system for many years, I also guided that river for Walleyes for over 20 years, with great success also. I do not fish it much any more; "" I'm over 80 "" but if your planning a trip there I can put you on some of my lod hot spots and will tell how to rig for those Walleyes; depending what time of year also. First 3 weeks in June is the best Walleye fishing ever there. Roy."
3087465,Guest,2014-08-13 20:05:00,0,Heading to Lount in September. Would like more info. Water looks high.
3088497,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-14 08:31:00,13,Water depth can change there over night because ot the Hydro Dam at Tetu Dam. Tell me where your staying and fishing when there and how well you know that water area; Lount camp and the 400 hole in to lower Separation. I would then be happy to send you a map of my fishing spots for Walleye and big Northern. Roy

3091033,NP4ME,2014-08-14 20:37:00,378,[QUOTE=Bakefish;3089001]Exactly!
3091441,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-15 06:02:00,74,"Roy, I've been up to your neck of the woods a few times. I'm familiar with Lount camp. I've stayed on an island for a week at a time between the camp and 400 hole. Would accept any info/map of the area you are willing to share. PM he if you wish...thanks"
3092769,Guest,2014-08-15 13:54:00,0,"Will be at Lount Lake Lodge, I think, not far from 400 hole. Thanks for your offer of info."
3093889,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-15 22:07:00,13,"The 400 is a great Walleye and big Northern spot any day of the week. In my 20 years of guiding and fishing this river I found this rig to be a great Walleye taker. A little Joe Gold Spinner behind a 3/4 oz inline sinker. tipped with a minnow or black leach. Good luck, wish I was going in there with you."
3093913,MR. LOUNT LAKE,2014-08-15 22:19:00,13,The 400 is a great spot for Walleyes and nice Northern's also. I spent 20 years guiding and fishing that river and the only rig I ever used was for Walleyes and Northern was a Little Joe Gold Spinner tipped with a Minnow or a Black Leach behind a 3/4 oz. inline chain sinker. My largest Walleye was 12 lbs. Northern. 24 lbs. Wish I could go with you !! Good luck.
3094113,Gunner_Fletch,2014-08-16 04:37:00,74,Thanks for the info Roy. I've fished that area several times. Great fishing....but current can be a challenge at times. You must have fished all over that river system before....
