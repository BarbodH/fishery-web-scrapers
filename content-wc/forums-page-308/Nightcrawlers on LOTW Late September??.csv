3088561,deadhead1,2014-08-14 08:43:00,193,I use 1/2 crawler and just hook it thru twice near one end. I find if I use a full crawler I miss more fish. Also try rubber crawlers as they work well too.
3090009,Bill Krejca,2014-08-14 14:44:00,6107,"PS, I haven't seen the beef heart referenced for quite a while. Having never tried it, I have several questions: 1. If I remember correctly, there may be a tougher skin coating, for want of a better word, that should be on the meat to facilitate the strip staying on the hook. Perhaps it is liver that I am thinking of? At any rate, I seem to remember looking for a beef organ with the tough skin still on it, was told the butchers normally remove this part. How close am I and does the meat stay on it if this skin has been removed, or is the heart tough enough on its own? 2. Is a cooler used to store the meat to keep it fresh, or does it get ""better"" during the week? 3. I'm assuming a strip is cut as bait? Thanks for the info, Bill"
3090097,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-14 15:16:00,1460,"There is a membrane on parts of the heart that is useful but not necessary to keep it hooked. I found it stayed on about the same as a leech. We brought ours up with the frozen goods and kept in the fridge so we used ours fresh. Each morning we would cut into little strips and put into our coolers in a ziplock. When I would pull one out, I took a little time and used my fillet knife to sculpt it in the form of a gullet. We caught a fair amount of fish with it and my group was sold on the concept. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=354889"
3090321,ftfarms,2014-08-14 16:18:00,444,When we use jigs and worms I like to use whistler jigs from northland tackle and use half or less of the worm. Hook it once and take the end and hook it over the barb and try leaving it so it stands straight up If bite is slow I like using phelps floater with half worm and toss it out and let it sit if no bites in a little while snap it let it sit so on so on.
3090385,jimirjr,2014-08-14 16:54:00,1149,Billy.... YOUR brain WILL be picked about this one... VERY SOON.. LOL!
3090625,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-14 17:56:00,1460,"Yeah well, I think your boat is a perfect place for us to mentally prep for your upcoming houseboat trip as your kicking my *** with the Chatfield walleye. I swear you train them."
3104193,deadhead1,2014-08-19 11:56:00,193,"I have used heart for last 20 years but on LOW I find it doesn't work as well when bite is slow. Hot bite, no problem. Nothing beats a live minnow but at the price today I can't afford them."
3104249,NathanH,2014-08-19 12:13:00,697,I use a half a crawler and find that this works best while saving you some extra money. I would buy a flat of crawlers. When I went with my father we purchased 250 I think. I would advise that you buy a small crawler container the kind that opens from both ends. Everyone sells them for around 5 dollars. We would put a good number of crawlers in the smaller container to take into the boat. This kept the others fresh back at the cabin and allowed us to access the worms with out digging up bedding all over the boat. You can get several fish out of a half a worm in most cases. We also but about 3 dozen minnows when we were up there but worms did the trick for us. The other thing we had was impulse paddle tail minnows that when the bite was on we used those caught fish just as well and lasted a long long time. I would guess twister tails or other such plastic would work well too once fish are found and are feeding.
3087577,muskybones,2014-08-13 20:37:00,24,"We will be heading to LOTW September 20-25. We usually vertical jig with minnows. Last year, we went through $240 worth of minnows in 4.5 days. Pricey. I have never used nightcrawlers in September as the water is cooling. Are nightcrawlers a viable alternative to minnows in fall? I believe it would be a cheaper alternative (even with the increase in price per flat). If you do use nightcrawlers at this time of year, how do you use them? I suppose we could use plastics too (Gulp, Trigger X, etc.). Thanks in advance for your advice and help.Bones"
3087697,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-13 21:26:00,1460,"I experimented with beef heart strips this year with good to great results. We all like to fish with minnows but at a half dollar a pop, yup, it's time to find alternatives.A flat of crawlers and a 4 dollar beef heart is what I'd go with."
3087737,ftfarms,2014-08-13 21:45:00,444,We used worms and imitation leeches last sept and did well on both.
3087953,jimirjr,2014-08-14 05:27:00,1149,"Going up the 24th out of Sioux Narrows... We have done well with crawler/jig combos... Usually cuts Our minnow usage by 50% at least... Minnows are Our ""fallback"" bait. If The bite is ""on"" You'll catch em on both... Where are You gonna be ""muskybones"" ??"
3088041,port1042,2014-08-14 06:20:00,509,We use minnows in the spring and crawlers in the fall. Usually fish early September but we have found crawlers will out fish minnows at that time of year. In the spring I can't get a walleye to look at a crawler.
3088097,Slushfish,2014-08-14 06:32:00,263,"We have changed around to using close to 75% crawlers in July/August. There are some days when they still want minnows but, like Jim said, when they are biting they'll usually take either."
3088289,muskybones,2014-08-14 07:41:00,24,"We will be staying at Buena Vista Resort. I have been going to LOTW for 22 years now (the last 6 at BVR). Used to fish muskies 95% of the time and only fish for walleye for supper. Now I fish walleye/perch 95% of the time and muskies just occasionally (more of an homage to my father who was a diehard musky fisherman).Thanks everyone for the advice and information. It will give me a lot more confidence to use something other than the ""jig/minnow"" combo.BonesPS: I hope the dock is no longer under water at BVR. Only 5.5 weeks to fish paradise."
3088321,muskybones,2014-08-14 07:49:00,24,"For those of you that fish jig/crawler, how do you put the crawler on the jig? Whole crawler, 1/2 crawler, small chunk, chunk with twister tail, thread it on the jig, wacky style, once through the nose?????Thanks again,Bones"
3088449,deadhead1,2014-08-14 08:18:00,193,"Last week or so I would say leeches, minnows or crawlers are equal. Also catching on small twister tails. Haven't tried gulp minnows yet. Beef heart should also be working---I'm going to try it friday."
3088545,SinOrSwim,2014-08-14 08:39:00,1528,I am curious on this too. I don't fish crawlers very often but we fished a couple weeks ago with a guide and he just did it wacky style. hooked it about 3 or 4 times looped around and had a tail coming off back. Full worm usually. I always thought you would thread it on there for a more natural look? We go in early September and usually fish minnows. Need to change things up more when it's slow.
