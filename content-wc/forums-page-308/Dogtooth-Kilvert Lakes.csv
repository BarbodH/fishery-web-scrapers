1986418,toomanylakes,2013-07-27 17:48:00,2,Heading up to Dogtooth lake Labor day weekend. Just wondering if anyone could kinda steer me in a direction to start looking for some good reefs. I am going to also go into Kilvert lake and see if I can find some reefs there. Any help would be great. I will be willing to email the GPS points I get when I get back from fishing there. Thanks Toomanylakes

I am headed up to Dogtooth a week after Labor Day this year, but traveling with a group who are mainly interested in Northern...so trying to find some helpful info for my boat, which will be after the walleye! Any info appreciated. Thanks!"
