3092977,lassh,2014-08-15 14:57:00,553,"I am going to try and early Sept. trip to LOW and am thinking of making a run over to Shoal. I have fished Shoal once in summer and for about half a day in the late season once. My question is what kinds of structure should I be looking for for large bass and pike? What kinds of fishing should I not waste time on? Since I will probably only be over there one time, I want to fish efficiently. Feel free to PM me or reply to this post. Also- Last fall I spent several hours fishing Ash Bay, and I didn't see a fish. I thought I might raise a musky in there in the fall but no such luck. Is that not a good area in the fall or did I just happen to hit a dead time that day? Are there still no contour maps of the lower 2/3's of Shoal Lake? Thanks for sharing any knowledge you might have."

3106681,lassh,2014-08-20 06:05:00,553,I'm leaving next week so I sent this back ttt. Any info on Shoal or LOW early Sept. tactics would be appreciated.

3106833,lassh,2014-08-20 06:48:00,553,Yes. I plan to post a report after I get back and get caught up on my work.
3112089,Larbo,2014-08-21 11:45:00,231,"I have been to Shoal many times and have caught pike and bass using 5"" paddle tail swimbaits white in color with just a plain hook no lead head. I also use a fluorocarbon leader. If you use the fluorocarbon make sure it is fluorocarbon leader material since it is more abrasive resistant than just plain floro line. Also my lakemaster chip will work on LOTW's but not shoal lake. Looking forward to your trip report.Good luck and be safe."
