3090609,MorganMan,2014-08-14 17:53:00,341,"Oh baby, has happened many time over the years for us too. I am the same as many, unhook the northern at the side of the boat. Several of our group keep some and no worries. I cannot stand the smell of them AT ALL. I'm not sure why as I hauled in some nice ones in the early years....but I just can't stomach the slime for some reason. I did have a boating partner one day catch a nice northern and he asked what he should do? I knew it was a big fish for him and we brought it in for pictures. It's what you do. It's about fishing and about memories. I'm guessing one of by brothers put northern slime into my beer or on my food? I am gagging now. BUT, if it's THAT big? **** yes, net that HAWG!!!!"
3092873,Aspencreek,2014-08-15 14:25:00,2911,"If you fish enough up there it is bound to happen, and what a sight when it does. Heart rate goes up, eyes get big, you know your alive!!! Saying's like ""we're going to need a bigger boat"" come to mind.. and it's Shark week too!"
3093737,Mike Kansas,2014-08-15 21:03:00,1463,Some crazy things happen in canada. One time i had a 20lb Pike on at the side of the boat and a Smallmouth came up and grabbed it. Had the whole thing in his mouth and he strated to swim away and pulled the boat half way back to camp before the Smallie would let go of that 20 lb Pike. This happened back when a good day on the water included a 1/5th of Bacardi with a drop of coke. Mike Kansas

3104593,port1042,2014-08-19 13:56:00,509,"I was fishing bluegills this morning and while I was watching my bobber I threw out a 1/8 ounce jig with a white twister tail. About half way into the retrieve I had a good bite. I didn't think it was a bluegill but it didn't seem to be anything special either. My partner noticed and picked up the net and moved over next to me. Just then a ghost-like monster came up out of the depths and shot right straight up in the air next to the boat with a bluegill in its mouth. When he hit the water he splashed both of us and was gone. I couldn't talk. We both just sat there with out mouths open until we started to laugh. A really nice bluegill was left for me and it was in good shape when I put it in my basket. A 7 foot ulta-light with 4 pound mono probably isn't the best choice for musky, but that's what I had. Probably a good thing he spit it out. Actually fighting it would have been a brief effort."
3104745,Fishin Fun,2014-08-19 14:53:00,218,"Our boat had that happen 3 times this year while we were there. One time a large pike was swimming across the top of the water with his head sticking out of the water like a periscope. Here he had a walleye in his mouth up to the head of the walleye. It swam by our boat and when we tried to net it, it jumped straight out of the water and shook the walleye out of its mouth and dove back in. The walleye was about 14"". Never seen that before. Otherwise 3 other times our walleyes on the hook got hit by pikes while bringing them up to the boat. All three times they let go once they saw the net."
3087313,btmbncr,2014-08-13 19:11:00,492,"Started fishing a hump in McKenzie Bay this morning.It had lots of fish on it.My wife has a fish on and needs me to net it.I thought I had just hooked a walleye but suddenly it just stopped moving.I let out a bunch of line,net my wifes fish,take it off and put it back in the water.I pick up my rod,crank up my line and it won't move.I start to back up to get""unsnagged"" and the snag starts moving.I said honey it's a fish,a big fish.The fish starts to rise up off the bottom.I'ts about 3 feet out away from the boat at midship and about 1.5 feet deep.It is a huge Northern with just the head of a walleye sticking out of it's mouth.My wife is just standing there with the net and says what should I do?I said try to net it.She puts the net in the water and the walleye comes out of the pikes mouth and the pike just swims off.She nets the walleye.It's 16 inches long and the pike had it tail first all the way up to it's eyes.The walleye looked like it was crushed.We just stared at each other and started laughing. My wife dusted a mounted 27 lb Northern for years and she said this pike was a lot bigger than that one. I have a no pike in the boat rule but I would have made an exception for this one.Bill"
3087385,1jigfish2,2014-08-13 19:32:00,110,That is one reason why we spend all day on the water. You experienced something lots of others only dream about. Congrat's to you and your wife for sharing that together.
3087569,Glenman12,2014-08-13 20:35:00,762,"we have the same rule...all pike released at the side of the boat unless its a trophy then we will accept whatever happens.. Several years ago we are fishing a bay on Cedar Lake..as we are coming out of it theres a rock reef...I catch a fish and Im reeling it in..nice fish...about 8-10 from the boat I can see its a nice smallie...my partner had the net ready and out of nowhere comes a huge musky and grabs the smallie around the head but also severed the line (mono)...scared the chit out of me..wasnt ready for that and had to sit down for a minute..lost the smallie, musky and the lure in a second...God I love fishing in Canada..."
3087705,rather-be-fishin,2014-08-13 21:27:00,429,Love it! The unknown of fishing and the excitement that it can bring! Keep the stories coming! 11 months to go and counting down to our return trip to the mighty Lac Seul! RBF
3089449,prov1800,2014-08-14 12:33:00,5010,I feel sorry for you.lol.
3089521,Bakefish,2014-08-14 12:45:00,1077,I love you guys that shun the pike. More for me.
3089657,fishron,2014-08-14 13:21:00,317,"I was about 14, that makes it 56 years ago, a member of a scout troop that frequently tent camped on a lake in New Jersey. We always did a good amount of fishing along with all the other fun things that came along from being a scout at that age. We caught pickerel, (pike family) and broad shouldered perch that would surpass a foot long. There were bass in the lake. One morning we were fishing and catching our usual fare when I hooked a fish that doubled my rod over. It was all I could do to get it close to the boat and I never could see it. The guy in the front of the boat thought he would help me out and he grabbed the line. You can fill in the rest."
3089665,bigwalleye1,2014-08-14 13:21:00,2632,"I've had 4 different pike in my boat under this scenario, one that was 45"" that wouldn't let go of the walleye on my line, one on a boat partner's line 4 years ago, aout an 8 pounder, and two this year for my Dad on the same day, one about 1/3 bigger that than the walleye he grabbed, and one about 7 pounds. Those are my ""exception"" pike, worthy of a net and a picture. I've found the bigger fish are pretty docile at boatside, willing to be handled once they've tired, but the small ones are the one that'll cut you up. Jig fishing, I'll let them have the jewelry and a new piercing and just break off rather than handle."
3089889,port1042,2014-08-14 14:26:00,509,"What triggers these strikes? I've had musky and pike hit bluegills, walleyes and bass. It seems to happen quickly after the first fish hits your bait or pretty early in the fight. The hooked fish must put out some type of distress signal (sound, vibration, ???) that triggers the predator to take advantage. Something of like a fox coming in to a distress call. Anybody have a clue of how this actually works?"
3089977,tv4fish,2014-08-14 14:37:00,2694,"I think you pretty much said it. It's the predator/prey relationship. If a bigger fish can get an easy meal by going after an injured minnow - or small walleye, in this case - that is in distress or not able to swim or move away as a ""normal"" prey would - that bigger fish is going to take advantage and go after it. We've had that scenario play out many times up on Lac Seul."
