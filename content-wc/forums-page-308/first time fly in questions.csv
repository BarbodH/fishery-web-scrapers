3098241,SinOrSwim,2014-08-17 16:51:00,1528,"Agree with this. We don't fly in anymore but we did for about 17 years. Verne is easily the best fly in outfitter we ever had. And, go to his website and read his newsletters. Very entertaining."

2344794,Jwoodward79,2014-01-12 18:27:00,2,Anyone had any experience with Northwest Flying? Looking at going to Cleftrock lake end of August
3068849,Bandit81,2014-08-07 14:53:00,8,"Hey Jwoodward, I'm headed to Cleftrock this Saturday. I'll let you know how the fishing is. We went went NW flying last year to Ajax....AWESOME trip. Lots of portages and many different species. 100 fish days for walleyes. We are hoping Cleftrock is just as good, can't find much info on the lake or fishing reports....kinda scary."
3068897,Jwoodward79,2014-08-07 15:10:00,2,"Spoke with Shane a few times and he says fishing is excellent. I would be curious on what you guys are bringing for bait. I contacted the Pro Shop in Nestor Falls and they suggested 50 doz minnow, 3 lbs of leeches, and 24 doz crawlers. We have a group of 6 guys going for 4 days Good Luck FishingJoel"
3068921,Bandit81,2014-08-07 15:18:00,8,"Joel, This will be our 3rd fly-in in 3 years. The first year everyone told us to bring the same stuff you listed above but we only brought a flat of crawlers. (6guys) We caught hundreds of walleyes, so many that I specifically targeted big northerns for 2 full days. Last year at Ajax we brought half a flat of crawlers...and used 2/3's of them I suppose. When we knew where the walleyes were, I always switched to artificials and they were killer. The BEST bait you can bring to Canada if you ask me, is Uncle Josh's meats crawlers. Put a third of a crawler on a jig and I kid you not it will last for 30 walleyes. And they love it. This year we are bringing a half a flat again, but I'm loaded up on gulp minnows, and of course Uncle Josh's crawlers. Can get them almost anywhere just google it. Most friends or anyone I've talked to said leave the minnows at home. I have never needed them and also can't imagine having to take care of them for a week. Jig color for us has never made a difference really...although gold or white are a guarantee in Canada with that stained water. I'll give you a full report when we get back! We'll be there this saturday through next saturday. Heading out in 10 minutes in fact! later!"
3081441,Ferrispata,2014-08-12 08:09:00,63,"If Quebec is an option, I would highly recommend Air Tamarac out of Clova, QC. 4 of us caught over 500 walleye this year in mid July in 5 days. Most were caught in the 20-25 ft range. It is fly-in only and the outfitter has 7 cabins on the 12 mile lake. It was a great time. Great cabins and superb boats/motors . They are a class act for sure. Plenty of reviews of their outfit on this site. Jerry"
3082633,pitbull,2014-08-12 14:05:00,45,"Try to find out when the average time for May Flies and work around that. When the hatch is on, the bite for catching is OFF! Ken"
3094833,maddogg,2014-08-16 10:37:00,178,Call Verne at Slate Falls Outposts and take anything he has available.I've fished with him since 1978 and haven't had a bad trip yet. First class all the way.
3098153,Guest,2014-08-17 16:22:00,0,"Check out Northern Wilderness Outfitters out of Ft Francis. Great people to work with, Vic and Mitzi and the crew. August is the best. Temps are good, bugs minimal, fishing very good. Just got back from our 11 year with them."
3098177,Pikeslayer8,2014-08-17 16:28:00,1460,I agree. Which lake did you go?
2326202,123chadder,2014-01-06 10:52:00,429,white river air...excellent outfitter
2331433,Hawkfan,2014-01-07 17:37:00,237,Slate Falls would be an excellent operation to go with. Verne knows his stuff. Red Pine Lodge and Outposts is another. Used to be Verne's before he downsized and Gull Lake is a phenomenal walleye fishery.
2331657,Golden Eagle,2014-01-07 18:57:00,2642,Consider going with another couple who have fished the camp successfully in the past.
2333266,mroyle,2014-01-08 12:43:00,74,"If you wanna risk lousy weather and lots of black flies and lots of walleyes then late May or early June will work. If you want better weather, no black flies, and lots of walleyes do a fly-in mid-July to mid-August. Great Lodges---Booi's Trout Lake, Ara Lake Lodge, Ghost River, Burntwood, Club Trout Lake (Quebec), Bull Moose Lodge, Twin Lakes. I have fished all of them and others during this time and caught tons of fish."
2333538,Jack77,2014-01-08 14:21:00,168,I concur. You won't go wrong with Brace Lake Outfitters
2334386,Hunts1,2014-01-08 19:42:00,123,"I have been on Fly-Ins with Bob at Wilderness a number of years ago. He runs a great outfit and you will be very happy with him and his camps. You may also want to check out Ignace Outposts. Brad Greaves and his wife karen have really nice camps as well. I went with Wilderness for a half dozen years and Ignace for about the same. We have changed to a boat-in operation that we prefer, but for a fly-in experience either one (Wilderness Air or Ignace Outposts) you can't go wrong. I have incredible memories with both of them. MikeQUOTE=NARDA 1;2323681]Check out Wilderness Air, www.great-fishing.com they run a great operation!!![/QUOTE]"
2334602,yoopertrout,2014-01-08 21:00:00,1172,"Thanks again everyone. I appreciate the ideas. We want to go in June, bugs and all. We've booked with Kabeelo. I have high hopes. On the other hand, in my life, the further I travel to fish, the more likely there will be a drought, flood, heat wave, plague of locusts, that sort of thing. But, at worst, we'll have six days in a cabin on a lake in Ontario with no phone. And, with any luck I'll catch some trout and muskies in Wisconsin and the U.P. the rest of the summer."
2334634,Hunts1,2014-01-08 21:13:00,123,"Good for you! As it is, the very first place I went on a Fly-In in Ontario was on Lake Jeanette with Kabeelo Lodge in 1990. Went to Wilderness Air and Igance among others after that. We didn't change because of our experience with Kabeelo, just a move to another state and a different fishing group. Have a great time.Mike"
2337177,yoopertrout,2014-01-09 16:07:00,1172,Thanks Mike!
2343250,micropterus,2014-01-12 07:27:00,450,"Clearly, a suicide"
2323305,yoopertrout,2014-01-05 14:46:00,1172,"Hello, My wife and I are planning our first fly-in. We are hoping for a lake with lots of walleyes and a chance for big ones. Big northerns would be nice, but not necessary. I mostly fish trout and muskies. We are decent walleye fishers, but far from pros. We would prefer a lake that is relatively easy to fish. We would also prefer to not have to fish super, deep if possible. We have looked into: 1. Slate Falls Outfitters - highly recommended by friends. Mostly booked for mid- June.2. Kabeelo - Sounds like a quality operation. We are a little concerned about what the scenery will be like after the 2011 forest fire. I suppose it might be easier to see moose etc., but I'm wondering if it's an ashy mess.3. Sioux Air - came highly recommended by friends. Mostly booked in mid-June.4. Halley's - Looks nice. Haven't reached them yet.5. Hidden Bay - Looks nice. Haven't reached them yet.6. Ushi Lodge. Talked to the owner (super nice lady) and the American plan sounds relaxing. Booked up between June 10th and 28th. Here are my questions:1. Am I foolish to be hung up on going in mid-June (which seems to be the most popular.) We went to a drive in resort in July once on the owner's recommendation, and the fishing was terrible. In a NW Ontario fly in camp, would the first week of June be risking weather so cold the fish won't bite? Would the end of June, beginning of July risk deep and scattered fish? Lodge owners are very re-assuring about early June and July, but, then, they are lodge owners. :-)2. One owner said August is fabulous. Is that likely?3. Can you recommend any of the above lodges? Other lodges. American plan is not absolutely necessary. Need a clean cabin, boats with seat backs, and good fishing. This is my first post on this site. I hope I didn't break any rules. I read old posts to get a feel for how it goes. If I did, let me know and I'll remove the post. Thanks for the help, and good fishing to all in the new year."
2323505,onetimedave,2014-01-05 16:04:00,502,If possible go early in June or late May. You might contact Brace Lake Outposts and Arctic Watershed Outposts both out of Nakina. Both good operations.
2323545,yoopertrout,2014-01-05 16:18:00,1172,"Thank you Dave, I appreciate the reply!"
2323681,NARDA 1,2014-01-05 16:49:00,636,"Check out Wilderness Air, www.great-fishing.com they run a great operation!!!"
2323697,CSH Kucinski,2014-01-05 16:50:00,1340,"Check out Air Cochrane, we are going there again in June."
2323721,MrSimon,2014-01-05 16:56:00,922,"You can catch fish from mid May through October. I caught my biggest walleye ever at high noon on a hot sunny August day. Personally, I prefer to pick the time that is most comfortable weather wise, and that is late August or early September. The weather is stable, the bugs are usually gone, and the fishing is great. I HATE bugs!!! After a nice day on the water, it sucks to get eaten alive while carrying gear up from the boats. Sitting outside enjoying a campfire and watching the stars kind of looses its appeal if you have a thousand skeeters buzzing in your ears the whole time."
2323897,Pooch,2014-01-05 17:34:00,4619,"My largest walleye came mid day, high sun in eight foot of water. Only fish caught in my boat that morning. Matter of fact the only bite I had all morning. Weird.Homemade Prescott (my version) spinner and minnow.Pooch"
2324265,Fisherman Ted,2014-01-05 19:07:00,461,"I just sent you a PM. May through mid to late July is typically better for really big walleyes. If I had ONE week to pick it would be late May. Walleye are just off the spawn and heavily feeding (and shallow), huge pike are sunning themselves and can be sight fished for, lakers are easily caught and smallies are staging for the spawn. Also you do not need to forgo creature comforts and add extra days to your trip with a fly in. There are many drive to lodges that have incredible fishing. Good luck."
2324489,yoopertrout,2014-01-05 20:01:00,1172,Thanks to all of you. I really appreciate the advise. Tom
2326050,new hips,2014-01-06 10:21:00,498,"Late August to 1-2 week in September,weeds are still green..........usually bugs are not an issue. Fish may be deeper but very predictable. Early season you can run into mayfly hatch, and changing weather by the hour. You stated a fly in lake.......fishing should be good when ever. The worst conditions are hot sun blue sky and no wind...great for boating, not so much for fishing."
