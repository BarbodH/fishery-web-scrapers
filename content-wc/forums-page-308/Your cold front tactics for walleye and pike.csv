3108905,BornToFish,2014-08-20 15:47:00,1224,"I happen to fish several weeks each year in NW Ontario. Two weeks in August and two additional weeks in September. I use a Humminbird 798 sonar unit with a color monitor. I used my Humminbird a few years ago during a severe cold front The entire camp and guides were very frustrated with a most challenging bite. I noticed on my sonar that the walleyes were still where they were before the cold front. However, the walleyes were belly to the bottom, depicted as blue smears on a red bottom (rock). I'm sure that some of the fish were laying in cracks on the rocks. I caught many fish during those few days by SLOWING WAY DOWN!!! I mean really SLOW!! I continued vertical jigging in the same places that I had been catching them before the cold front, but had to put the jig + bait right on their noses. I'm sure their strike zone was measured in fractions of an inch rather than feet or yards. Fishing in a cold front is a challenge at the very best. However, I believe the fish can still be caught if you recognize that their strike zone is greatly diminished. Slow down and put it on their nose, as they will be unwilling to chase. The cold front will pass within a day or two. It will be game on when the wind switches to the west or southwest. Until then, just slow down and make the best of it by picking off what you can. Good Fishing!!"

Trip planned a year in advance.I have been to this lake twice before.The last time was in 2011. Same thing ,first week of june and it was snowing sideways.Fishing was tough. The time before we were slaying them 5 minutes from the cabin.Nice thing about kellow is there are specs as well.Just as long as you don't mind hiking about a km thru ****'s forest. A number of years ago there was an ice storm that took down a lot of trees.They are all on their sides with spikes (dead branches) all over the place.Fall and you may be impaled! (you thought a hook in the forehead was bad) So ,do specs react negatively to a cold front?"
3110369,octanehi5,2014-08-21 04:47:00,1104,"Walleye tend to go deeper after a cold front passes.They may be as deep as 40 feet, Start jigging in deeper water and work your way shallow until you find them."
3110969,gordy28,2014-08-21 08:01:00,437,Thanks everyone - great input
3111505,speckmaster,2014-08-21 09:26:00,17,"Like others have said, slow your presentation and downsize your jig and bait."
3111513,Golden Eagle,2014-08-21 09:26:00,2642,"Fishing a cold front can sap a fisherman's confidence. Fishing experience will allow you to predict when a cold front is arriving, so keep a full limit of fish yesterday so you can eat a walleye dinner today. Soak a bag of dry beans the night before and start cooking them the morning of the cold front. Day of the cold front, sleep a little later, wash dirty clothes, trim your nails, work on fishing equipment, dry fishing tackle and shoes that may have gotten wet from yesterday's rain, do a lot of sight seeing while hitting a few deep holes & moving water, let your wounds heal, come in mid day to check the beans + take a nap............ Give the late bite a chance before turning in that night. Have fun. Relax. It's all part of a fishing trip."
