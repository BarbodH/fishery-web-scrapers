The latest fish photos on the GA Facebook page were posted just a week ago today (1st bear pics went up this morning.) Recent reports from Cedar, Perrault, and Wasbaskang would lead me to think the fishing's been pretty good on the GA lakes.Hope your question means you have a trip planned yet this year!!"
