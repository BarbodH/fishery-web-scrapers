Many of the posts reported that anglers were pleased with their results. These reports led me to give salted minnows a try two years ago. I have used salted minnows with considerable success when fishing for early season walleyes. I casted a jig with salted minnow into relatively shallow water and brought them back to the boat with a gentle and typically slow ""hop"". I recently returned from a trip to NW Ontario where my results weren't as favorable as I expected, based on my early seasons results. Crawlers, live minnows and leeches all seemed to produce better results than my salted minnows. I note that almost all of my fishing for walleyes during my recent trip involved vertical jigging rock humps/reefs, which is in marked contrast to early-season horizontal presentation. This unexpected result caused me to think about what happened. Could it be that the early season horizontal presentation results in a ""reaction strike""? The fish noticed the salted minnow going by and had to either immediately eat or watch it go away. I wonder if the vertical presentation (vertical jigging) allowed the fish to study the minnow, such that the fish had time to decide to eat or not to eat. Your thoughts?"

I do know that when walleyes are not aggressive details such as length of leader or jig head vs Lindy rig can all make the difference between catching and getting skunked. I do think there is something to your theory regarding the reaction strike and how you present the bait."

3106897,pwbmlr,2014-08-20 07:20:00,37,"I fish with salted minnows all the time. I have a boat on Erie and everytime I go perch fishing whatever live minnows I have left I salt down. I pour kosher salt in the bucket with the live minnows. The minnows will start to jump like crazy which will allow them to breath in some of that salt. This will preserve them longer. Once they all expire I pour them on a screen and drain them good. Then just pour more salt on them and let them sit for about 30 mins. Finally, grab some sandwich baggies and put a few doz in each bag. Throw them in the freezer and you are good to go. I always grab a bag and put it in the cooler when I go walleye fishing just in case the fishing is slow and we don't want to waste a trip we will just hit the perch for a bit.The way I salt my minnows never leave them mushy. I can usually fish with them for at least 2 walleye per minnow. Just make sure you wash your reels off when you are done since you will have a little salt on your hands. At the end of the year I always have around 30-40 doz minnows frozen and ready for my Fly in trip the next spring. The other nice thing about salting them at different times is that you will get different sz minnows. I now have minnows ranging from 1"" to 3"" in my freezer I can bring with me next year to Canada. It is a nice cheap way to have real bait in Canada. I just pick up a half a flat of worms on the way up to Canada and we are good. For a group of 4 guys we get all the bait we need for under $50.00."

Most of my fishing with them is done with a jig, usually pitching it or working it in current. I do minimal vertical jigging up there but when I have they seemed to work good. I normally fish with just a jig and twister tail but when the fish aren't jumping all over that presentation I add a salted minnow and usually catch fish. There may be times that a live minnow would work better but since I've given up bringing them I don't know when. I think a lot of it is the confidence factor: whether you believe your presentation will work or you believe it won't, you're probably right."
