One, that has been suggested to me is to just follow the shoreline pulling plugs at a good rate of speed. Maybe this works but I sure prefer live bait rigs to pulling plugs. Any ideas?"
522375,JN,2002-07-10 20:26:00,47,I would also troll. Depends on the time of year where and how deep I'd troll but thats what I'd do and would continue to do if it's working. If you only pick singles up go back over the spot with jigs or live bait. But in 20 years of going up I have never had anything but artifical lures on the end of my line and can't remember but a couple of days I got out fished by bait users. I also say fish with what your confedent with thou.

This is what I do; head up the new lake and look at the surrounding lay of the land. Look for structure that may extend into the lake body. Then investigate to see if there are other factors to work with. Stream entrances, sunken islands, underwater shelfs, weed edges, windy points, anything that will attract fish. Comfort, protection from predators and proximity to forage are the keys to look for. If you spot some interesting structure on the finder drop your minnow tipped jig and give it a go, or troll the area slowly. If the lake is really large, get local advice to start or you could waste a lot of time to find out what a question or two at the dock could have told you."

Trolling is a decent idea - if you wanna pull live bait rigs - fine - you just go a little slower.2. Many shield lakes have wildly varying depths, and these depths don't relate to the shoreline as we would expect. I have pulled up alongside a rocky shoreline and still was in 18' of water. Rather than troll through lots of unproductive shoreline - try trolling points (carefully) - start 50 yds or so before, troll over the hump and off the backside. Do this with each point along the way, even try going over different depths of the same hump. 3. If you happen to find some shallow flats along a shoreline, this is also a good choice, as would be the mouth of any incoming rapids.3. Be careful - when travelling, give points wider berth than you otherwise would, as their humps can extend out much farther than they look. Pay attention to your depth finder. Shield lakes can go from 100' to 0' in less time than it took me to type this sentence. I've been there. Try and find a map with at least the reefs marked on it, as you can never tell where they are otherwise until it's too late.Otherwise, best of luck.derrek.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""

This will give you the most control and cover plenty of water. It is a universal tactic and deadly as well.If the lake has ciscoes also try open water trolling with cranks, especially toward evening."
