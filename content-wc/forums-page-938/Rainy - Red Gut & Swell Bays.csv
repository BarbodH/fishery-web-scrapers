All caught on artifical baits. Water was clearest in the extreme East end of Swell. Hope this report helps those going soon!Pathfinder"
522326,Hookmaster,2002-07-09 09:53:00,206,What kind of structure were you fishing?
522327,Guest,2002-07-09 13:35:00,0,"Northerns and Walleye (these were big eyes - 23-26"") were in weeds/wood, 5'-8' deep. Smallies were logically located around rock chunk/bolder 2'-5' deep. Look for smallies around the islands mainly.Pathfinder"
522328,Guest,2002-07-09 13:43:00,0,"Hookmaster,Forgot to tell you our best color was a bait with yellow gold, either a spoon, spinner or stick bait. The gold stick bait was hot the first part of the week and the second part of the week was a Mepps Musky Killer.Pathfinder"

We stay in the same area. Is the water as high as they say?I've fished up there for several years and have only found a couple of weed beds. Is this because we haven't fished shorelines enough? We generally fish islands and humps."
522330,Guest,2002-07-12 06:45:00,0,"Hookmaster,Yes the water was 2' plus higher than normal. Watercovered the paved blacktop area around the Fisheries office/store. We had to walk through water to get to it.Owners said this was the highest they ever had seen. Yet it didn't affect fishing except pushing the fish shallowerand easier to find. If you want to find weed beds, go tothe backend of any bay and you will find. Same thing applies to creeks entering a bay.Pathfinder"
