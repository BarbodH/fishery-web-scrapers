522157,Guest,2002-07-07 12:40:00,0,"Steve,I too have fished the Morson area in the past and have heard the local lore of genetically mutated walleyes that have become so large that they could eat a man. The story goes that someone a few years back had left some very unpleasant chemicals in a weedy bay and one walleye was changed forever due to the infestation. Since then, that walleye has spawned and created this viscious walleye look alike that is known to bite off the legs of any unsuspecting human that may be cleaning their trousers in the lake. I plan to be in Morson again this year and I truly hope that no one in my party should feel the need to clean their trousers in the lake, as it could obviously be disastrous for him or her, as well as any other unsuspecting on-lookers.As far as the fishing goes, I have also that their is a particular spot near Hay Island that is known as sh*# point, and that this area is an excellent spot to pick up Northerns and an occasional Muskie.Tight lines, fish the structure,MPF"
522158,Guest,2002-07-07 13:58:00,0,Just got back for the morson area today. We spent a week up there fishing out of lodge about 14 miles west of there. Fishing was awsome. Lots of fish on cranks casting shorelines and rock piles were awsome as well. My wife and I went through 3 dozen minnows each morning on any hump that we could find. It was rare to make the minows last more than an hour. The may flys hatched last week so they will be all gone when you get up there. Check with the lodge before you leave town though as 621 into morson keeps washing out in six or seven difernt places. Water is 3 feet up and rising as well.
522160,snoop,2002-07-07 20:07:00,0,I fished your same areas in previous years as well and know of exactly the same folklore. The way it's told in our boat though (most often the junkiest one) is of an albino creature with chicken legs and saggy whities that actually spends very little time on the water! Rumor has it that this creatue is always followed by a stench of unbelievable magnitude and growls like a wildcat! Good luck and watch your back. P.S. Use Quarter ounce blue and white jigheads.
522159,EsoxProSport,2002-07-07 20:16:00,24,"I was up the last week in June fishing out of King Island. we made several trips to the morson and adjacent areas. Miles Bay was good too. With still rising water during our stay, Reefs were good producers both casting and jigging. Weeds were growing by the minute too. Made for an interesting week of fishing with mayflies, high water and rain followed by a heat wave... We fished Muskies a lot, surprisingly catching 12 in our group. We only had a few additional visible follows all week. It was interesting how we hooked up with 90% of what we saw.I plan on returning again next year, last week in June. Its two years in a row of high water and this year a late Spring. How do you guys like the Last Week of June?"
522161,Lee,2002-07-08 18:42:00,61,"Steve, My wife and I will be going to Red Wing the same week you will be there. We are staying for at least two weeks and possibly another if we can retain the cabin. I can tell you that after going to Red Wing for 12 years I have found some areas that are usually good performers. To start with I always go out at first light and hit Waldron's island just out from our bay. The west side of Waldron's is usually the best. I have caught nice walleyes, smalley's, and musky all on the west shoreline. Next go to the first bouy marker just west of Waldrons. I always do pretty well there. You can fish this reef without worry of hitting the top of it with the motor. Fish the drop off on the west and north sides of the reef at the bouy. I have trolled crankbaits (walleye divers) over this reef and have caught nice walleys on many occasions. I have numerous other areas that are pretty close to the camp and would be glad to share the locations with you. We are staying in cabin #3 (first cabin next to the lodge opposite the fish cleaning house) and if you want to stop by I'll show you a few areas you can try. I have a Lund (2001)1775 SE (Green) with a 130 Honda in case you see me out on the lake. Good luck fishing and don't forget to take a birth certificate or passport just in case they are required when crossing the border this year. See ya up there!! Lee"
522154,Lee,2002-07-08 19:06:00,61,"Steve, I'm guessing that you hired Lenny from Red Wing as your guide. He's a pretty good guide. Another guide you can try is Brian Major. He is a Canadin Mounty but guides in his spare time. He's one of the best guides around the area. If you want to try him out you'll have to tell Mike (Red Wing owner) and he will call him to find out if he has an opening for you. He is in demand as a guide and sometimes you can't get him during the time you are there because he's booked up. If you're looking to go musky hunting he's the guy for you if you decide to hire a guide. Lee"
522162,Steve,2002-07-11 18:49:00,259,"Lee,Don't know if you'll get this before you leave or not. But, great to hear from a Red Wing veteran, and thanks in advance for the help! We'll be sure to stop by and pay you a visit while we're there. Hope we all do well and have a great time.Steve"
522146,Guest,2002-07-04 05:57:00,0,"Will be fishing LOTW out of Morson 7/13-7/20 (staying at Red Wing Lodge-had a great experience there last year). We usually make the trip mid-late June and have good luck fishing the weeds. We were looking for more stable conditions (last year came in on the heels of the mayfly hatch, making thigs kind of tough) and so scheduled for July this year. Know the fish will be out on the rock piles, but can anyone give any further advice as to likely depths (20ft?) and locations around the Morson area. Also, are there any walleyes or northerns left in the 10-15ft weedbeds at this time? Thanks! I'll post a report on our return."
522147,Fuzz,2002-07-05 07:01:00,85,"Steve,I'll be going to Morson on 7/17-7/20 fishing at Reel 'em Inn Lodge which is 25 miles W/NW just North of Big Island on Alexandria Island. I make 3 trips per year, early June, July, and early September. Generally in July, if the weather has been warm and stable pressure we find the most action on the shallow rock piles, the ones that top out at 8-10' with 20-25' water surrounding. Usually the smallmouth will be on top with the walleyes on the sides or deep edges. There are a bunch of these small shallow rock piles that we fish, and we love to anchor upwind, and fish them with slip bobbers (jig and leech my favorite). This can be a blast on the small piles where the fish are concentrated. However, the deep rock piles are generally pretty good too, especially if the weather's been a little unstable. I've had better luck for bigger fish on the deeper reefs, the ones that top out at 20'. I love to use plugs on the deep big reefs this time of year. Downrigger fishing the deep reefs with plugs can be very good. (snap weights or 3-way rigs will work if you don't have downriggers. We have caught a few walleyes in weeds while fishing Northern this time of year, but most of our sucess is on the rocks in July. Good luck and let's exchange reports upon our return."
522148,Fuzz,2002-07-05 07:03:00,85,"Steve,Where is Red Wing Lodge? How far west do you fish? I'll be happy to recommend a few spots, but the farthest East we fish is the Fadden, Fish, Pony, Garden Island areas. These are all West on Painted Rock Channel.Fuzz"
522150,PJM,2002-07-05 11:23:00,3516,"steve The reefs that they fish are between Morrson or lets say Redwing and Dawson Island. Dawson Island is west, of Redwing you will see reefs on the map. Marker 12 is a good place to fish and the max depth out in the bay is 27 feet so these reef can come up in to 5 feet but what you want to do is is off the sides."
522149,Guest,2002-07-06 05:58:00,0,"Fuzz,Thanks for the reply and the advice! Red Wing is east of the painted rock channel by about 5-6 miles, directly south of Rabbit Island. Structure is very similar to your side of the channel. Sounds like you have more luck on the underwater humps vs. islands vs. shoreline (?) Last year, we never made it into the channel or west, but on a calm day it's only 15-20 min. ride over to the channel. Any further advice you wouldn't mind sharing would be great. As we all know all rock piles are not created equal. By the way, do you still get decent northerns in the weeds at this time? Thanks again and good luck to you as well. Steve."
522151,Guest,2002-07-06 06:07:00,0,"PJM,Sounds like you're pretty familiar with the area. Last year, we hired the camp guide for a day because we had'nt fished this section of LOTW. He actually took us out to marker 12. No action that day, but like I said, we came in after the mayflies and fishing was tough. Glad to know it's worth revisiting though. Do you find the other small humps in the area to be worthwhile and/or would you have any other advice? Thanks again! Steve."
522155,Guest,2002-07-06 19:26:00,0,"Steve, We fished that area last year and had varying degrees of success. Stick close to the weedlines for hot walleye action! Being close to shore allows the older members of your crew to get on shore should they have bowel problems....if you know what I mean! This year bring handy wipes for such emergencies - Good Luck!"
522152,PJM,2002-07-06 21:20:00,3516,"steve I just told you that marker becauese I have had some luck there. If you look at your map and find Dawson Island and from the middle of the island go southeast about 2 1/2 miles your will see a small island and below it there is a rock reef that will have a 10ft on it and that is worth checking out. All those reef northwest of Morson are ok you just have to try them. Also go into Miles bay and fish off the south tip of Garden Island. Stay a little to the left and come straight out and it will start to drop off in to 38feet of water but fish the structure. I have caught some big fish off there and it like fishing the reefs but it rocky, but when you get one it nice."
522153,Guest,2002-07-07 05:48:00,0,"PJM,Thanks again for the info! We'll definitey give those spots a try. The reef at Garden sure looks interesting. It helps to have a few places to get started in a new area. I'll let you know how we do. Steve."
522156,Steve,2002-07-07 05:55:00,259,"Ah-ha, I was wondering how long it would take for Stinky-P to weigh in on this issue! One concern about those weedy bays is that suddenly, without warning, large hairy creatures resembling monstrous man-like beavers are known to grab onto the sides of boats and overtake the boat with their horrible stench! I heard something like that happened to your boat last year. There was an emergency call, and then all went silent. I'm staying away from those areas!"
