522366,Guest,2002-07-14 09:30:00,0,ugh. try a different locale next time but since you're there you're there. all i know is that at one time the upper part of the french (above wolseley bay) was great for smallmouth bass in july. try launching in the bay-fish 15-20 feet (shallower at night). go up river and fish the points that show rock faces. they may have recovered since we were there but they were hammered for years by locals and the indigenents so dont expect too much. maybe the folks who've fished below wolseley can help.
