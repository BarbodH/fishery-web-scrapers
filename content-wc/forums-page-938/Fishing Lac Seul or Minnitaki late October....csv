(It's the only time-frame available to me in the fall and I'm definitely not staying here in northern Wis!) I've been privileged to travel and fish in Ontario every year since 1980 and have mainly stayed on smaller lakes in the Dryden-Ignace area, but this wonderful site has peaked my interest to look at Lac Seul! I think I've searched and read just about every posting on this site (Archives included!) and others in regards to the Lac Seul fishery! What an amazing amount of information that is available through the messages posted here!! I commend all who are so generous as to share their favorite hotspots, accommodations, etc!!! For the last 12 years I've had to use the above time-frame so it's been difficult to find camps still open or in my price range. I travel with my parents (60ish) and wife, so showers, clean cabins, etc. are a must. We're trying to stay in the range of $500/couple/wk. for a Housekeeping Package (restaurant available in main lodge? That would be nice!) Considering Pickerel Arm Decent fishing nearby? Worth traveling to Lac Seul from here? Any area better than another this late? Any Lac Seul guides available that time of year or care to respond? Thanks to all!"

522403,Walleye Wacker,2002-07-12 06:58:00,6,If you want to catch trophy Walleyes and bunchs of them try the Winnipeg River or the Red River north of Winnipeg. We have been fishing there in October for several years and 10 to 14 lb Walleyes are common that time of year. The Walleye move into both Rivers from Lake Winnipeg in the fall and the fishing is fantastic. You dont need a resort on the Red if you have a boat. You can stay at a Motel and there is plenty of access to the River. Its not hard to find fish all you need to do is find the boats and there will be plenty of them there but not to crowded. Last year four of us fished four days and caught and released 123 Walleyes over 7 lbs including 14 fish in the 12/14 lb range. We also had numerous fish smaller but still nice.
