521842,Guest,2002-07-13 10:49:00,0,I take a 50 mg B complex every day and I still get bit up.
521832,Guest,2002-06-24 19:26:00,0,"Just a quick question. I heard that there is a vitamin that if you take it a week before going to canada, the bugs (mosquitoes, black flies) will not pester you. If this is true then what is the vitamin and how does it work? I don't want to cut my fishing short due to the aweful biting bugs. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,Schmegger"
521833,bigfish1965,2002-06-24 19:42:00,3210,I have heard of it but let me give you some advise from a Canuck who used to live up in the tundra. DEET....and lots of it. Use a bug jacket in really horrible surroundings. If you smoke...smoke lots...the bugs hate it. ( big nasty stanky cigars do very well)
521834,Peekay,2002-06-24 21:39:00,7,The vitamin you heard about is vitamin B1....do a search including the archives & it should return you 3 threads where others talk about it....was taking it this year before my trip but the cold weather kept everything at home except the fishermen!!!I have heard of others eating garlic cloves each morning.PK
521835,Guest,2002-06-25 05:43:00,0,"It's vitamin B1. I'll find out soon how well it works. My son and I leave next Wednesday for LacSuel. I've been taking one B1 tablet a day for about a week, but he thinks taking vitamins to keep bugs away is stupid and won't take them. If all the mosquitos are at his end of the boat, we'll know why. I'll post the results of this little test. BTW .... B1 vitamins are cheap (100 tablets for $4) and available at Walgreens."
521836,Guest,2002-07-09 12:05:00,0,"Mostly as an experiment, I took one B1 tablet daily for about two weeks before heading to the Ear Falls area last week and continued taking them while we were there. My 18-year-old son refused, saying that taking vitamins to keep bugs away was stupid. Although he might not admit it, I think he has changed his mind.Mosquitos were never a problem in the boat because it was always hot or windy or both. However, in the evening around the cabin it seemed like my son was constantly spraying Off on himself, while I had very few mosquitos around me, rarely had one land and I don't think I was biten once. The other difference was after we'd go to bed. He'd complain about mosquitos buzzing around his head. It seems like they could find him in the dark, but not me. There are limits to its effectiveness, however. One evening we tried to take a walk into the woods. We were both immediately engulf by a swarm of mosquitos. The B1 also didn't help at all with the spiders or bed bugs or whatever it was that got into our sleeping bags every night and bit us in places that shouldn't be biten.BTW...The walleye fishing was great the first several days, but slowed down this past weekend when the lake went flat and it got really hot. Part of the problem was we couldn't keep the northerns off the line the last two days."
521837,Guest,2002-07-09 12:16:00,0,Foget the B1.....Take Viagra and you wont want to go fishing. Seriously get the highest Deet rateing you can and Sitranela candels for the cabin...
521838,Guest,2002-07-09 13:48:00,0,"The Vitamin B-1 is affective against the mosquitoes but does nothingto ward off the black flies. Go to you local Wallmart or Meijer store and get a couple spray cans of Utra-thon (made by 3M for the military), it's the best bug spray I have found.....and I've used them all. Stay away from that botanical crap, it doesn't work and the skin so soft sucks just as bad. Get the good stuff, you won't regret it."
521839,Guest,2002-07-09 16:36:00,0,Tried the B1 and garlic cloves but never any sucess. I go up in August/Sept when the little critters are pretty much gone.
521840,phidelt157,2002-07-11 15:36:00,191,"Took B1 two weeks in advance this year.....although it didn't create any kind of shield around me, I wasn't bit as much as my sidekicks were. It works for some, not for others, worth a shot though for $4."
521841,Atlanta Dave,2002-07-13 08:49:00,323,"We just got back from 2 weeks in the northwest terr. myself and my fishing partner both tried the B1 and it is of no use, the guys in this post who say it works have something else in their systenm that keeps the bugs away. I had bites on top of bites. The only thing that works is Deet. We also just had a report on one of the local stations in Atlanta and they come up with the same results Deet is the answer. Save your money on the B1 and buy Deet. Have a good trip we did.Atlanta Dave"
