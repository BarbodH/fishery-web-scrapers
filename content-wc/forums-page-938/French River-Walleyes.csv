I realize this is not the best time of year to fish but I am looking for suggestions on where to find walleyes and what to use on them. I have been reading about using jigs and harnesses but have read anything about using lures such as Rapalas, Benos, River Runts, etc. Any suggestions, tips etc. would be appreciated."
522290,Guest,2002-07-09 10:37:00,0,"Benos and river Runts? Where are you getting them,or have you had them for quite awhile? I know they have'nt made Benos in years and thought they quit making River Runts also. Please satisfy my curiosty."
522291,Guest,2002-07-09 17:35:00,0,Yes I have had these lures for awhile and really havenot been fishing with them since the 80's. I did have not searched for any new lures yet but I have seen some Heddon lures at KMart which looked similar to River Runts but I don't remember what they are calling them. Next time I'm there I'll check it out.
522292,Guest,2002-07-14 09:34:00,0,try rapalas at night-10 feet or so....put a split shot on the nose or just ahead. make sure to give it a twitch and slow troll.smallmouth bass used to be good up there but the french hasnt seen great years for awhile. bass fishing in august was a big hit at one time. 6-9 pm along the shoreline. anything that wiggles. nice structure on the french but too much pressure. have fun.
