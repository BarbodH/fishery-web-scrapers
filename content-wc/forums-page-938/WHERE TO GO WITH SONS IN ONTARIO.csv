The price was quite reasonable, the accomodations were good, the road was good and the fishing was excellent. 3 of us boated between 400 and 500 walleyes in 2 and a half days of fishing. The bugs were minimal. I highly suggest checking them out. I know we will be back next year. This was our first year and finding fish was not a problem."

This area, north of Sault Staint Marie could be the most reasonable location for you to travel. Remember to check into the Algoma Central Railway and the resorts that it serves."
521644,walleyefishboy,2002-06-20 16:17:00,260,"I'M HOPING TO TAKE MY SONS ON A CANADIAN FISHING TRIP INTO ONTARIO FROM THE U.S.. I'M INTERESTED IN WALLEYE AND PERCH. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE TO GO, WHERE TO STAY AND WHEN IS THE BEST TIME OF YEAR. I'M TRYING TO PLAN SOMETHING FOR 2003. I'M NOT REAL KEEN ON PRIMITIVE CONDITIONS. I'M RATHER FAT & LAZY & ENJOY ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME. THE FISH DON'T HAVE TO BE HOGS. I CAN CATCH THOSE HERE IN MICHIGAN. MY SONS ARE 17 & 14 & ARE FINALLY SHOWING AN INTEREST IN FISHING. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT FINDING GOOD ACTION, AS OPPOSED TO BIG FISH. ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED."
521645,Guest,2002-06-20 17:25:00,0,"Check out pine portage lodge or Kaby Lodge out of Wawa, two hours north of the Soo, and high numbers of fish"
521646,Guest,2002-06-23 23:23:00,0,Check out Pine Sunset Lodge on Dinorwic Lake. www.pinesunsetlodge.com
521647,Guest,2002-06-24 10:46:00,0,You might be interested in www.fivelakeslodge.comThis is my fourth year with my son who is now 10. They have a father son or family special. Very easy walleye fishing with many large fish.Jeff
521648,Tyee,2002-06-24 20:44:00,60,"You may wish to check out Camp Kuha, as it is only an hour andone-half out of the Soo. Good fishing for walleye, pike and SM.New log cabins with 24 hour electric, nice indoor bathrooms, woodburners, etc on Tunnel Lake.Have been up (3) times with friends and my 17 year old son (wholives to fish) and had a great time every trip.Their website is: www.campkuha.comEmail me if you'd like more info......if you're serious about gettingup to this camp next year, I'd book early as they could have triplebooked last year....good luck with your choice.Rich B."
521649,Fuzz,2002-06-26 18:47:00,85,"I recommend The Reel 'em Inn Lodge. It is on Lake of the Woods in Canada. You drive to Morson and boat 25 miles to the Lodge which is on Alexandria Island right about in the middle of the Lake. Very comfortable and reasonable, about $125 per day, per person USD which includes all food, lodging, boat/motor/gas, bait. Your 14 year old may be 1/2 price, I don't remember his age cutoff for this. Nice boats: 18' Alumamarine with new 40 hp Yamaha 4-strokes w/padded swivel seats. Depth finders and marine radios on all boats. American Plan only............they do all the work: cooking, cleaning fish, etc. I've been going there 8 years (other places for 5 years prior to that) and wouldn't consider anywhere else. I make 3 trips per year. If you want numbers of fish and not necessarily size I'd recommend July. Great fishing. However the fish are on rock reefs at this time and the fishing is great, but can be ""snaggy"". It doesn't get any better than early June IF, and I emphasize IF, the weather is stable and the fish are in normal post-spawn shallow sandy bay patterns. Late August/early Sept is best for big fish. If interested email me for more info at [email protected] or call Vic Beckel at Reel 'em Inn @ 807-488-5802."
521650,walleyefishboy,2002-07-01 15:13:00,260,"THANKS FOR ALL OF THE GREAT TIPS. ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT TIME OF YEAR TO GO? I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BLACK FLIES THAT MIGHT EVEN CARRY MY DELICATE FRAME AWAY. I KNOW MY WIFE WOULDN'T MIND, BUT I'D LIKE TO FISH A FEW MORE YEARS. IF ANYONE IS PLANNING ON FISHING SAGINAW BAY IN MICHIGAN, I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP. WE'VE BEEN KNOWN TO PRODUCE 7 TO 10 POUNDERS ON A REGULAR BASIS. THANKS AGAIN FOR ALL OF THE HELP."
521651,WillieB,2002-07-01 15:46:00,292,"We've always enjoyed the 2nd or 3rd week of August. This year we're flying in northwest of Red Lake from Aug 15th thru the 24th...6 weeks away and I can't wait! Hardly any bugs to speak of, warm days (65-77deg) and cool nights (mid 40's to 55). Northerns are turning on again in the weedbeds after sitting in mid-depths thru the heat, and the walleye are getting fatted up for the freeze.It's a great way to end the summer!Good luck and enjoy!"
521652,fishmaster,2002-07-02 16:10:00,209,Try Vemilion Bay Lodage on Eagle Lake.Jumbo perch to 15 inches lot of 12-14 inchers.www.vermilionbaylodge.comSome of the best perch fishing i have seen in Canada.
521654,Guest,2002-07-10 11:49:00,0,"There are so many nice places to go. Drive-in Housekeeping is the least expensive and you can go to town if the fishing is poor. Fly-in can be expensive but you can hold costs down by taking a short trip. Check out Atikwa Lodge. I think you fly out of Nestor Falls (could be wrong about this). Anyway they used to offer a family discount during July or August. Another choice is the boat in resort. You can get get away from the crowd at a more reasonable price. I went to Cascade Camp at the north end of Rainy Lake. $90 to boat in and $90 to boat out-up to 5 people. It has daily rates. The camp is basic and old and reasonably well kept up, clean fish house. The nice thing is that it has a daily rate (good for those with airline schedules to coordinate) And by the way, the best smallmouth bass fishing I have ever had.Another choice to rail-in. The Algoma Central Railway (out of Sault Ste. Marie) lets you (anyway they did 15 years ago) throw your gear on a rail car and will stop at your resort. You flag the train down when you want to return."
