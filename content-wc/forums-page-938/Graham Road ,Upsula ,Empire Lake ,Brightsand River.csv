I talked to a group that had and they said it is not a very good landing. I suppose if you have enough help it would work. There is a landing further up the road (50 miles from where you leave Highway 17) that is on the Brightsand river. You can fish upriver a short ways where there is a large falls that needs to be portaged. This is a 400 ft portage. You also can fish down the river (north) for a mile or two until in goes into Harmon lake. Rapids will stop you there. We used to portage into Brightsand Lake and Metonga. Lots of work but, it sure was good fishing."
