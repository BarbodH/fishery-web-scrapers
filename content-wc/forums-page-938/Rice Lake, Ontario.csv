522213,Mal,2002-07-06 18:41:00,55,Am going in 13 days to Rice Lake. Have been going for about 15 years now so am not new to the lake. What is going on now that the heat front has passed for now? Mainly going for panfish but will cast for bass (C&R) and walleye. Can anyone help help me out on some information??
522214,Guest,2002-07-07 10:43:00,0,MALI will be going up the same week also. I have the same question for anybody that has been there or just comming back. I will be staying just north of Sugar. They only help I can give you from previous years is to POP-R the weeds around the shores at sunrise and then again at sunset. Last year we did really well on the smallies also. I just hope the wind doesn't blow like it did last year. Thanks to anybody that can help us.

Best were spoons (yes, the old Johnsons) in the shallow weeds and jigs on the bottom in the deeper weeds. Muskie bite was slow, but had some big follows on bass lures. Will go back in October to fish just for Muskie."
