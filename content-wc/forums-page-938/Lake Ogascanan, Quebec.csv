As in the past, Brad & Ginny and the boys were great hosts and the cabin we had was very clean.The road in was a little worse than in the past and the rains were heavy and long. The fishing was good, 57 walleyes, 25 or so nice lake trout and many northern pike. None real large, but fun to catch.We kept only 6 walleyes for a dinner and released the rest. The weather has put things into reverse for a little while as a few of the walleyes still had some remaining milk in them from the spawning. None of them had anything in their bellies but the lakers, which when cleaned ( all but 2 were released but these 2 were too deeply hooked) had bellies full of herring in them. The scenery was beautiful,we saw moose and beavers and one morning a big bald eagle flew directly above the boat with a northern pike about 18 inches in its talons, flew to a nest where we presumed it fed its young.Next year, there are going to be all new cabins on the mainland and the outpost cabins are all in very nice condition, some also being newly built. We are hoping to get back up there this Fall or if not, defintely next Spring.Good Luck to all this Summer and if needed, e-mail me for anymore info on this lake."

Our group of 8 guys were there in Sep 2000 for 4 days but got weathered out.Glad to hear that you and your colleagues enjoyed your trip into Ogascanane and that you had success. Where did you stay? Did you stay at the main camp or at one of the outpost camps? In what part of the lake did you catch the walleyes, the lakers? And at what depths?Does Brad have any plans to change the fleet of boats that his clients use? Jay"
521512,Guest,2002-06-17 19:00:00,0,"Jay- yes we have conversed on this lake before. Funny- we were there also in Sept 2000, last week they were open.We had snow and rain and cold weather but 2 of us got 53 for the week. No big ones but average sizes. This year we were at the mainland camp, ( 1st cabin on the road on rightside)We caught all the eyes in Jawas and Fergusons bays.All in 7-12' of water.Mostly on jigs/half worm.They wouldn!t hit too many stickbaits except the new Rapala jointed Shad-Raps in Perch colors. We hauled in our friends 21' center console and we fished all week in some pretty heavy weather. Brad called it the "" Queen Mary""! It had a 200 Merc and a 9.9 4 stroke trolling motor on it. It fished 3 great. The northerns were all over in many bays in about the same water depth as the eyes were.The lakers were in 44-90' of water. I caught the largest one for the week, a 35""- 11 pounds. We released all but 2 lakers as these were too deeply hooked to survive.We talked to Brad about the boats and he said he has not had many complaints if they are used the way they should be. In fact, he just bought a few more of the same type/color. The last day we were there the lake kicked up hars and not many boats stayed out in it.I will take my own boat next time as the Queen was fiberglass and the shallow bays where the wallies were, this boats was not designed to be in with all the rocks. It took an extra hour to haul it in but that would be about the same time it would take to haul any other type of boat on a trailer in anyways.Just that fiberglass and rocks don!t make for a happy Captain.Are you planning on going again? Take care- talk to you later. Pete"
521513,retire55,2002-06-17 19:41:00,1029,"Hi again Pete:Thanks for the detailed report. My partner and I hauled in our own boat as well in 2000. Personally, I think that's the answer for Ogascanane because there are so few places to get out of the wind (and waves). I doubt if our group will return for that very reason. Everything else was great.We tried Lake Kipawa last year during the last week of Jun. We picked an outfitter based on location - where there was ample opportunity to find quiet water during inclement weather - worked out fine. Kipawa is scenic as well and offers lots of structure. It also provides opportunites to fish for pike, lake trout and of course walleyes, our primary target. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and we are returning to Lake Kipawa 6-13 Jul this year. Thanks again for sharing your information. Jay"

521515,Guest,2002-07-09 11:47:00,0,Thanks for the messages on Ogascanan. We plan on arriving there on July 20th for a week. Looking forward to it. We are staying at the main as well. couple questions. How long does it take to get up to the upper end of the lake? (I have a 16 foot with a 25 hp but how about with the camps boats as well?)Do they have picnic tables at the main? Do they have a gas grill at each cabin at the main? Is there any way to charge batteries? What size range of Walleye do you catch? Any color that is usualy hot? Thanks in advance. Ralph Email me at [email protected].
