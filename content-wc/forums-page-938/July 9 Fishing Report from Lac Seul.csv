This week, the weather has been hot and so was the walleye bite!! Walleye locations finally matched the calendar, and we found fish where we would expect them to be this time of year. Sand flats and weeds were the key to locating walleyes, these areas produced big fish and lots of them. The guide staff is made up of hard core fisherman, but they respect the fact that many of our guests are not. This week we were fortunate to again host Denis and Sue Simonette, truly hard core fishing couple who have consistently successful at chasing and catching big walleye on Lac Seul. This week Denis caught the biggest walleye to date for the season at 31.75"". Not to be outdone, Sue caught walleyes at 31,30,29, and 28.75 inches. Truly outstanding for just three days on the water.Our guide numbers for the week continued on a strong pace and I say that our guides and our guests are getting pretty well spoiled. We boated 12 walleyes over 29 inches, 29 walleyes over 28 inches, and 78 over 27 inches.With the big northerns still being in transition, our guides focused on the great walleye bite. The big northern was a solid 41 inches, with 10 others in the upper 30 inch range. However, as I said we did not give much attention northerns cause of the walleye bite. The smallmouth bass bite was good and possibly a little better than average with 10 fish over 18"", and 11 more at 17"". I think the bass bite will continue to hold for awhile. We have just seen the first wave or two of big fish moving to deeper water. There were plenty of big fish still caught in the weeds, but most were caught in 12 to 18' of water. The biggest fish are starting to pack by size and moving deeper and this is a very sure sign that summer has arrived. We have other reports on Just Fish Ontario"
