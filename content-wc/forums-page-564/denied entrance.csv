NUDITY / Nude / Consent of Attorney General. 175. CAUSING DISTURBANCE, INDECENT EXHIBITION, LOITERING, ETC. / Evidence of peace officer. 176.

Might be more of a problem now because I know that more than once I've been asked by the officer if I've ever been denied entry into Canada. And some people think that if you have anything what-so-ever on your record that may be questionable that it's not a crap shoot and that it doesn't depend on the officer you have at the crossing! Unfortunately, it sounds like your friend rolled a 7."
