1124917,Moondog,2009-07-29 21:23:00,362,sometimes the roaming charges take a while to find their way to your bill......please let all of us know if you ever get charged.
1124733,Guest,2009-07-29 08:26:00,0,Has anyone used a Verizon cell phone in the Ear Falls area this year? Did you get coverage? The last couple years I couldn't get a signal . If you did get a signal and make a call was there anything differnt you did as opposed to what you do in the states?
1124744,Moondog,2009-07-29 09:38:00,362,"We stayed at Gull Rock this June and our Verizon worked fine. Before leaving the states we had to change our plan to whatever the plan is that includes Canada. Cost $59/month. You could check with your resort owner at Ear Falls. Gull Rock had all new digital towers. If you do this, I encourage you to be SURE to do it before leaving. A number of people staying at camp, found out we had coverage and tried to switch plans from there and it was virtually impossible. Hope this helps. It was well worth the extra $20 just to be able to call home or call someone if we got in trouble on the lake."
1124772,tjsker,2009-07-29 11:18:00,301,We were up in Ear Falls the first week in July. My brother uses Verizon and did NOT have coverage.
1124789,Moondog,2009-07-29 13:46:00,362,"You have to sign up for Nationwide Plus Canada Plan BEFORE you go. You can switch back when you get home, no problem. There were a lot of people at South Bay on Gull Rock that had Verizon but did not sign up and had no coverage. Best to check with your resort owner about the signal tho."

1124802,jigfisher9,2009-07-29 14:35:00,23,I agree with joeman79. I talk on my phone 360 days a year and I look forward to the 5 days when I get to leave the phone in the truck.We have called from Vermillion Bay with no need to change our calling plan.... but we have only called to another verizon phone so that may be the reason it works. I know some of the otherguys have tried using thier phones (US Cellular and Sprint) and it charges them a high roaming charge. Last year we had a signal at the grocery store in Ear Falls but did not call out.
1124836,Guest,2009-07-29 16:35:00,0,I was in Perrault Falls two weeks ago and had coverage on my Verizon phone. Did not change plans before I left and the phone worked fine but was roaming. Have not received the bill yet to see how bad they stuck me.
1124839,skindzier,2009-07-29 16:45:00,137,"Was at Timberlane the week of July 4th. Updated cell towers (*228) before I left home and got roaming with 4 bars in Ear Falls. Worked fine - supposedly .69 per minute. Haven't got the bill yet. My folks also have Verizon and were there, but were did not have service - I think they did the update cell towers on the road, though. So I guess my take would be: you don't have to update your plan, but make sure you update cell towers before leaving home. I'm sure your mileage could vary though."
1124855,Moondog,2009-07-29 17:41:00,362,Since we were out of the country for 7 weeks it was advantageous to use our cell phone and to change our plan. Another friend of ours did what Skindzier did and updated the towers but did not change their plan. Got stuck for a huge roaming bill. Our bill did not include ANY roaming charges only the increase due to changing to Nationwide with Canada.
1124900,Glenman12,2009-07-29 20:15:00,762,"we were in Perrault Falls the week of June 12th..like you I have Verizon and it worked...the only difference was that I had to manually dial the number..it wouldnt work from my stored numbers..also I couldnt text..I was in roaming too, got my bill the other day and there were no extra charges at all and I didnt make any changes to my plan before I left either.. let me know if your bill is different due to calls from Canada..also, AT&T worked up there but Sprint wouldnt.."
