1124447,Guest,2009-07-28 11:14:00,0,"Steve of Madison is on target. We were there the same week and had pretty much the same results. Actually, Steve made us feel a lot better, since this was our first trip to Lac Seul, though not our first trip to Ontario. Thought perhaps our methods were off-target for the lake. Our experience was very similar, though we caught our biggest fish on swim baits. Crawlers seemed to work well, but didn't catch very much on Gulp or live minnows. Everyone said the lake conditions were about 2 weeks behind. Pray for some steady, warmer weather."
1124489,Steve of Madison,2009-07-28 13:12:00,230,"Last year our trip was over the 4th of July, and the lake was about 2-3 weeks behind. So this year we went a couple of weeks later......of course, this summer is much cooler and again behind schedule further than expected and we have to fish harder and try and find the answer to finding the bite! I'm beginning to think this lake is on it's own schedule, and we just have to deal with it.I apologize if I made some of you feel bad, but there is no magic bullet. I get a kick out of guys asking which color bait, what depth, which spot. Sorry guys but those answers change not only weekly, but sometimes daily and even hourly. If you happen to hit it right when all you need to do is get your bait in the water, relish those times, but remember what the conditions were when it happens. We had a group in camp that was determined that the only way to catch fish was to vertical jig over rocky points and shorelines in 30' of water, because that is what somebody had told them was the hot tip. But after a couple of days of catching only a couple a day, we convinced them to give a couple of our spinner rigs a try, and move in closer to the weedlines and softer shorelines. Next day they were all smiles and had a great day on the water, with a good days work done. Don't complain that the fish aren't biting, they are always feeding, they have to to survive. It is your job to figure out what will make them bite your offering, and where the dinner table is.Reservations made for next year, and only 50 weeks to go!"
1124498,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-28 13:56:00,298,"Steve,You are 100% right. We were there over the 4th last year also and it was totally different than it had been for the past 11 years. Storms kept us off the water at times but we still managed to catch fish. We went back the middle of August for another go at it. Eveyone in camp said you had to fish 20'-25' deep to find them. Well, I always try all depths and guess what? As we were crossing a point that runs shallow for a couple hundred yards out into the lake we had a nice double on. The day was hot with no wind and we hammered them in 4'-6'. Ended up having a great week. Was there again over the 4th this year and had to search again. Pulled into a secluded, weedy, shallow bay and started trolling. For 2 days we caught unders, slots and overs one right after another. The next few days we found them in 8'-15'. Actually ended up being one of the best trips we've had. Leaving to go back again on the 7th of Aug. Can't wait! Been studying my maps and planning for any and all conditions. After all, isn't the thrill of the chase what it is all about?"

1122201,archer66,2009-07-19 16:49:00,21,"Making my 5th trip to Lac Seul on Friday the 24th. Can't waitt to get there. It's been nice reading all the information in this thread...you guys mention a lot of spots I've fished over the years. Does anyone have a recent report? Does anyone have a water temp around Manitoba point, bay of Islands, McKenzie bay? The last time we were there was in 2005....it was the last week of July and we found most of the Walleye in 18 foot of water...the best bite was trolling spinner rigs or using jig and minnow. I'm fishing with kids in the boat so trolling usually is more trouble free....less hangups, fewer kids hooked....etc."
1123106,eyewitness,2009-07-22 18:45:00,680,"Just returned from LS and 6 days of fishing the central basin area. Surface water temps ranged from 61 deg. to 65 deg. depending on where you were and the fish are scattered all over and not heavily schooled up yet as is the typical summer venue I so much was counting on.We spent an entire day trying at least a dozen main lake spots that ranged from typical post spawn shallows, weeds, main lake points and humps, and everything in between. This was my 17th straight year on LS and fishing and weather were as tough as I have ever seen it for this time of year....We fished Vaughn lake a lot and managed 80-100 fish a day on the counter, however we had to work a lot harder than I am used to. Most fish were 8-18' deep and shoreline related. Find a wind blown point and work the current around the back side and they were there. Just not in stacked #'s so you may have to move around a bit till you find a prime spot.I guess I will now have to go back up again before year end to get my annual ""fix""....lolOn the positive side, the quality of the fish we caught was unreal. All fish were real fatties with shoulders and very fiesty. This has been undoubtedly one of the coldest summers I can remember....."
1123875,J.Iverson,2009-07-25 22:17:00,64,"Now I'm getting nervous. I head up there Monday with the wife, kids ,and 3 other families with kids. Our outings up there past years have always been great walleye action for the kids, sounds like this year we will have to work a bit more and cover some area."
1124057,Steve of Madison,2009-07-26 22:23:00,230,"Just got back from another great trip to LS and Onaway lodge. Yes conditions were tough some days but that's why it's called ""FISHING"" not ""Catching"". You need to put the pieces to the puzzle together. Let me put it this way.....the definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results. The wind changes daily, sometime 2 or 3 times a day. It rained a couple of days, it was dead flat and sunny another, so conditions changed, change with them. I found fish not in my normal spots but studied the map and looked for windy points and hit the mid-lake umps when it was calmer. Backtrolled, jigged, slip-bobbered and even casted a stick bait. The fish would be hot one minute and not the next, so we moved to find them either deeper or another spot. The fish are there, you have to get them to bite, they are feeding!!!Here's what we found, mid lake temps mid 60's, water level about normal, mayfly hatch over or real close to it, midlake weeds not at ""normal levels"" but comming up. If the sun was out the fish were moving up shallower or onto the midlake humps. Some of the fish we caught were almost white, which tells me they have been DEEP, but are moving up. But we also spend quite a bit of time in a very special place where the water temps were a bit higher, the weeds to the surface, and the the big ones hot to eat, even caught a couple 40"" + Northerns on walleye rigs. Crawlers seemed to be the bait of choice for us but others found minnows while another used leeches all week. Secret is, be flexible, stay focused, move if it's dead, fish hard, die rich!Good Luck"

Fish are even more scattered now then before. Seems if you want big walleye you have to go either really shallow, 2-10' or deep, 20-40'. Bass are hitting well shallow, on their beds with some walleye's in the mix. My buddy and fellow guide Colin Gosse hammers them with slip bobbers and leeches. 2 days ago I saw mainlake temps at 56 and back bays as high as 76."
1115975,Guest,2009-06-23 21:53:00,0,"Am going to Lac Seul to fish the weekend. Staying in town in Ear Falls. Looking for an updated fishing report and if the warmer weather has picked the bite up. Also, first time to the north end of the lake. Are groceries avalaible in Ear Falls. Bringing 13 year old son and looking to get him into some fish. Any help is great. Thanks"
1116000,Guest,2009-06-24 04:29:00,0,Check weather @ > http://www.wunderground.com/global/stations/71295.html There are 2 grocery stores. One is on HWY 105 west side opposite 4 seasons bait shop. The other is located one block west of HWY 105 kinda behind the gas station.
1116032,chock,2009-06-24 08:04:00,19,"We fished Lac Seul last week June 13th - 18th. The warmer weather seemed to get the bite going in the shallows. We had good luck with walleye anywhere from 4 - 8 feet. We didnt go a lot deeper than that but I would say to start shallow and work deeper. Some hotspots last week were sawmill, iran creek, and banatyne bay. The sanctuary opened last week and i heard of a sand bank in there that was very hot for eater sized fish. we never went in there to try it. The northerns were very hot. We caught a ton of them in a timbered/weed bay near banatyne bay. We were casting spoons in 3 fow and getting fish all day. You could cast spoons shallow along the shore just about everywhere and catch northerns. We caught a few smallmouth in the shallows as well while walleye fishing. We mostly used jig and minnow for walleye but also picked up a few casting crankbaits. Our average size was definately bigger up in McKenzie bay on the clay banks. I think it is worth the trip to head over there. We have been going for 4 years now the same week in June. We caught a lot of fish and some nice ones but I would call it below average. We definately caught more and nicer northerns than in years past but the walleye numbers were a little lower. The other boat in our group hooked a muskie somewhere up in McKenzie. They didnt land it because they got it on a jig and a minnow and it broke the line at the boat. Hope any of that information helps"

Conditions at least a week behind, and the weather has been a factor the last couple of days - big cold front, high winds, even a bit of snow yesterday morning. Fish are scattered big time. I'm getting size and numbers when I'm in the current - so Chamberlain Narrows and Birch Narrows are paying off. Very slow and vertical presentation. Our largest pike ( 36 and 40) caught in same locations on jig and minnow. Fish were agressive last evening, so I'm hoping for a ravenous bite the next three days as the weather stabilizes."
1111480,LoDo,2009-06-06 16:20:00,721,"13 days and counting.....Has anyone fished Manitou Creek area just NE of Manitoba Pt? I've heard good things, however never fished the area. We usually stay at the Scout Bay/Rat Bay resorts and 6 of 7 days we head East and fish the E side of the Big Island. The Ghost Narrows have always been kind to us.

It actually is a big sand flat, I call it cabbage flats, and that's exactly what is there. Look for water temp around 55-65. I,ve had really good luck here, 20-27 inch walleyes! Same goes for Manitoba point, cabbage weeds to the southwest and right by that big rock on the end of the point. Dont be afraid to work the north side either. Check out Big Sandy, the south side is also cabbage weeds. And if you went that far, hit little Sandy too. There is a real good dropoff on the north side of that. I hope this helps, Bruiser."

1112586,jswinter40,2009-06-10 10:01:00,127,Sounds like weather like that is needed to get the bite in full gear. Water temps still a little cold yet from what I read and a warm up will be just what the dr. ordered. Don't worry you won't get more than 2 days of calm weather let alone a full week. Fish will be in a feeding mood is you get a few days of stable warmer weather. I just hope the weather sticks around for a little while because I am there in 2 weeks. COme on warm up!!
1114922,javabjk,2009-06-19 08:54:00,3,I will be making my 20 th. trip to Lac Seul in two weeks. I have always had good luck. I will be staying at Onaway. I start at Manatoba Point and work my way past the Black Bay area. Will start out each day for eyes and switch to big pike during the heat of the day. Five pound eyes and up are very common. I will start with a Lindy Rig on the sand bars and mud flats ame move out to deeper water with jigs. I hve had great luck with minnows and leaches. About 10:30 I will start hunting big Northerns. Four years ago I had 36 over 10 pounds each. All on large spoons and buck tails. Do be carful in this area as it can get very wicked in a short period of time. I have seen 8 foot waves in some areas. I realy like a 1 to 2 foot wave to fish in. Three years ago we cought 50 plus eyes off Matoba Point in 2 to 3 foot waves over five pounds each. By far the best lake I have ever fished in Ontario and I have been on 14 different bodies of water. All Lac Seul for for the past 20 years. We will be there July 3 rd. through July 9 th. I have a blue 16 foot Lund. I will see you on the lake. Good Luck.javabjk

1111151,JDP,2009-06-05 09:28:00,1457,"I was on Lac Seul last week out of Mahkwa Lodge. The main lake was very cold 45-47 degrees. My opinion is the lake is week or two behind in warming up, weed development, etc. We found walleyes in warmer water in shallow bays, creeks,etc. Fishing shallow and slow were the key for my group. Minnows were preferred over leeches. Casting crankbaits turned a few walleyes in the afternoon. We caught walleyes to 29"", incidental northerns to 38"", smallmouth and perch. JDP"
1111152,BenBeattie,2009-06-05 09:28:00,232,"The fish are still a bit scattered after the spawn. I still caught good numbers and size in a currant area that was also good at opener... but.... there are also good numbers and size being caught out of the spawning areas. Places like big prominant points facing the main lake that are along their migration routes. Water is warming up, fish are moving around so it really pays to be versatile at this time of year. Last week I was pitching for skinny water walleye and jigging as deep as 20'. I'd be looking at mainland shorelines first. I doubt fish are holding off the islands of the main lake basin."
1111175,LoDo,2009-06-05 10:28:00,721,Any reason the fishing south of Manitoba Pt would be better then anywhere else on the lake? The only reason I can think of is the water is uncharted. I would hate to get caught out there with one of the rental boats the resorts provide.

1111222,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-05 12:59:00,298,"LoDo, Yes, it can get rough out there depending on wind direction, but really no worse than crossing McKenzie or running up Steamboat. It's just a longer rough ride when you stay up by Ear Falls like we do. There are many times I was happy to be in my own boat rather than one from the resort."
1109335,BenBeattie,2009-05-30 09:03:00,232,"Hi Dave. I've never fished 'the goon' before but I'll give you my best advice based on my observations from Lac Seul. Do you have any tips or strategies that you like to use for post spawn fish (bait, rigs, presentations, ect)?Run and Gun. If I work a spot for 10 or 15 mins with little or nothing to show for it, I'll move until I find a good bite. I'll re-check prime looking spots, or spots I have confidence in, multiple times a day. It's common to bust on a spot at one time in the day then have great fishing on the same spot a few hours later. I primarily fish a jig and minnow. They are easy to fish, especially with guests who are less experienced anglers. You can drag them under the boat or pitch to shore, which is a great tactic early in the year. I've seen big walleye caught in late May/early June in less then 2' of water. Checking different depths really pays off too, not only in the spring, but all season long. If I'm marking fish and not catching, then I'll turn to Lindy rigs. It's a great way to turn lookers into biters. The only draw back with lindy rigs is digging hooks out of fishes throats, or cutting the line and leaving a hook in. I hate to see that. Most lindy fishermen feed line to the fish after they feel the pick up... I set the hook relatively quickly (2 or 3 count). I miss a few more fish, but at the end of the day I feel better about that then letting them swallow the hook. When you say the fish are 'scattered' where do you start to look for them (what type of structure, depth, etc).If you can establish spawning locations, start your search near-by. At this time of year I'm fishing primarily in water less then 15' deep. Right now surface temp. makes a difference. If you can find a pocket of warmer water then you've upped your odds. Warming water kickstarts all the lifecycles of aquatic vegetation, bugs and other forage that the walleye feed on. Early in the season walleye will usually be concentrated close to the mainland shorelines of the lake, as opposed to the main lake basin structure (the shallows warm faster then the basin does). The wind plays a huge part in my decision making process - always fish structure that the wind is blowing into. Points and shorelines that have rock rubble to sand transitions can be great. Shallow sand/stump areas on Lac Seul are prime spots at this time of year. As spring gives way to summer the fish migrate from spawning locations towards the main lake basin and they occupy structure for varying lengths of time along their migration route. The spots I fish in early June differ greatly from the spots I fish in the middle of August. By mid-summer I'm typically fishing depths of 25 - 40'. Now, from my understanding, wabigoon is a shallower lake so I'm not certain how this affects walleyes seasonal migrations on that lake. Also, how long after the spawn do you typically see the bite to pick back up?Don't get me wrong, you can find great fishing during the post spawn period. Timing is everything. Post spawn is RIGHT NOW where I'm fishing. When I say the fish are scattered, I mean that some of them have vacated the spawning areas, while others are still hanging around. By early-mid june, when water temps near 60 deg. the fishing really gets going. June is my favourite month on Lac Seul, hands down. Hope this helps a bit. Have a great trip Dave. Ben"
1109337,IowaDave,2009-05-30 09:15:00,69,"Wow, thanks a million!!!One more quick thing on pitching jigs.....when you do that, do you tend to use a slow steady retreive with an occasional jigging action thrown in, or do you let it rest on the bottom and make short jumps along the bottom as you retreive it? Or both?And just a jig with a minnow or do you put a twister tail on as well?Thanks again! This kind of stuff is why I'm starting to love this site!!"
1109339,BenBeattie,2009-05-30 09:31:00,232,"Ah, the fine art of pitching. It is honestly one of my favourite ways to target and catch walleye in the spring. If the bite is ON and fish are aggressive, a jig and grub is all you need. Casting a minnow on a jig can burn throug the bait pretty fast. I always 'double hook' my minnows - in through the mouth, out the gills.. push the minnow's lips right up to the ball of the jig, twist the minnow, and go back through its side. The minnow will hang in a perfectly straight profile and the hook point is farther back too - meaning the walleye has to put less of the minnow in its mouth to get hooked. When I pitch, I let it sink to bottom then 'hop' it back to the boat... or short jumps as you suggested. When I jump the jig back, I raise my rod tip to pull/lift the jig up then hold my rod still in the up position while the jig falls back down to bottom. This is key... watch your line as the jig is free falling. Most of the time the hit will come just as the jig is about to hit bottom again and you're line will twitch. Quickly reel up your slack and set the hook!! Painting/dragging the bottom works too and it allows you to present your bait a little bit slower, if that's what the fish want."

1110305,Guest,2009-06-02 15:21:00,0,"Hi LoDo, In a previous thread you asked about areas south of Manitoba Point. We've been fishing Lac Seul for the past 12 years the 1st week in July and always spend at least one day fishing and exploring that area. South and southeast of Windigo Point you will see many islands on your map. We've fished around most of them and always had good luck. There is a lot of deep water in that area so a lot of big Walleyes hang out there. Around the islands there are a lot of sandbars and rock piles that produce fish. You do need to watch your map and approach some of the areas carefully as some of the rock piles are quite extensive. In general, the day we fish that area our percentage of slot and over slot Walleyes is always greater than the other days of the week. We have had problems getting eaters there some years. Good luck!

My bro-inlaw and I fished all the way to Rocky Point last year and all those islands to the south looked good. Talked to a guy from Texas 8 or 9 years ago and he had a bunch of spots marked on the map of the area you are talking about. His wife and he caught over 6 walleyes over 30 inches, did'nt beleive it untill I saw the pictures. Where do you stay at?"

We have hand held radios for communication between the two boats but they have a limited range. We have never gotten into Walleyes in the 30' range but usually catch many over the slot. We might if we sat and jigged but we like to troll with spinners and minnows. We like to keep moving and exploring new areas. Where are you staying? WP - Sioux Falls"

1108749,LoDo,2009-05-28 09:51:00,721,"Has anyone fished Lac Seul this year? I'm looking for early season fishing reports, spawning, water temps, bait, etc...ThanksLoDoDenver, CO"
1108887,BenBeattie,2009-05-28 17:45:00,232,"Fishing on eastern Lac Seul has been very good since opener. Currant areas held fish with many in the 27"" + class. Right now fish are migrating away from the currant areas towards main lake structure. However, fish are still in the currant but the numbers and size aren't as good as they were opening week. Water temps are between 45 and 50 deg."
1108927,LoDo,2009-05-28 19:43:00,721,"Excellent! I would guess spawning is taking place now, especially if the water temp is in that 45-50 degree temp. I've read that 2-3 weeks post spawn walleyes can be difficult to catch. Has anyone found this to be true? Past years we have always kept 3 walleyes under the slot and one over, however, I recently heard that several resorts are frowning on fisherman keeping one walleye over the slot. Thoughts?"
1108932,BenBeattie,2009-05-28 20:07:00,232,"I certainly encourage my guests release all fish over the slot and most have no problem with it. The last camp I worked for (Silver Water Wheel) did not allow, under any circumstances, an over slot to be harvested, and he had a full camp almost all season. The difference in meat is minimal. I always use the analogy of eating an old Bull or eating veal. Those big walleye have been in the system a long time and bioaccumulate murcury. Aside from that, they are prime spawners and put their good genetics back into the system. That's my .02 cents on the matter, but until the laws change (and I think they will - someday), it's just an opinion. From what I can tell, the spawn on this end of the lake is over (that's not to say that every population of walleyes on Lac Seul are totally finished spawning). From my observations though, no more females dropping eggs and only a few of the males are still 'holding out hope', if you know what I mean. Like I said, fish are leaving the currant/spawning areas now and are a bit scattered as they recover and hunt for food. Don't get me wrong though, there's still fish to be caught in/near spawing areas but some are transitioning already. Absolutely, post spawn walleye can be tough to catch, but if you find an active school it can be awesome fishing too. Being at the right place at the right time is everything. I'll check spots multiple times a day. You can bust at a spot early and go back 2 hrs later and it can be loaded. Also, I cleaned fish today that were LOADED with bugs. Absolutely stuffed!"
1109060,IowaDave,2009-05-29 08:39:00,69,"BenBeattie, Couple questions for you if you don't mind....Do you have any tips or strategies that you like to use for post spawn fish (bait, rigs, presentations, ect)? When you say the fish are 'scattered' where do you start to look for them (what type of structure, depth, etc). Also, how long after the spawn do you typically see the bite to pick back up?"
1109089,SBR It,2009-05-29 09:33:00,4,I'll be up next week fishing near the Hudson area of the lake. Hopefully fishing will be good. Early reports looks like the weather will at least be decent. All I know is it will be better than here at work.
1109120,LoDo,2009-05-29 11:01:00,721,"Ben,Thanks for the update!! I have to agree with you on the releasing walleyes over 18inches. I dont believe I'll keep anything over 18inches this year.I'm super excited for this years trip. Good luck everyone!!!"
1109269,fishman10,2009-05-29 23:30:00,226,"i am working on the hospital project in the sioux. ihave my boat on abram and am blessed with the fishing in the area. the fishinf so far has been descent, but a little slow as the walleye are post spawn. but getting better as the water warms up. man, i have a tough life. off work at 5 and fishing every night. this is the life!"
1109279,BenBeattie,2009-05-30 04:44:00,232,IowaDave - I have to go to work right now but I'll take the time to put together a good answer for you as soon as I can. Are you coming up to Lac Seul soon?
1109324,IowaDave,2009-05-30 08:20:00,69,"Unfortunately, no....but I'm going to Wabigoon next week. Yeah, I know I should drive another hour to go to LS, but I'm kind of at the mercy of my group that I'm going with (see my ""Wabigoon Help Please"" thread in this forum).....at least for now! As I said in that post, I'm really wanting to absorb all the info that I can, (which I have done an unbelievable amount of in the 2 weeks since I stumbled upon this site). I realize that some of the info might not be applicable from lake to lake, but I'm sure some will be too. I'll look very forward to your response!"
