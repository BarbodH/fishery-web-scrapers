1124142,jignminow,2009-07-27 09:42:00,168,Just an FYI and a HUGE THANKS to the guy staying at Barbers Resort that I talked to on Friday the 17th. We were discussing how he had done that week since it was the last day of his week and the first day of mine. He was giving me some info on what was working and the key areas to try and was showing me locations on his Lowrance. The Minaki system is not shown on the Navionics Canada map. Go figure. It actually shows up on the Western Great Lakes map which I happend to have with me since I fish Lake Michigan all the time. I popped it in and there it was. All the places that I have been going....All the waypoints that appeared on a plain white screen suddenly filled in..........Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks again. Still can't for the life of me figure out why it would be there. I would never have found that by accident. I am just glad the discovery was made on day 1 and not day 7. I would have been pi--ed!!!!

This was a plus for me as I seldom fish the Great Lakes Area but spend most of my time in Minnesota, Wisconsin and North & South Dakota. It includes all of LOW, all of the River and continues north past Minaki and north of Big Sand. I am looking foward to using it up on Big Sand next week. Bigiver"
