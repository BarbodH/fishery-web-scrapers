1125146,Guest,2009-07-30 17:27:00,0,"How's the fishing for walleyes around the Goose Bay area of Lac Suel? Can you catch fish close to Goose bay? If not, do you have to travel very far to get on fish. Thanks for any help."

1125211,Guest,2009-07-30 21:16:00,0,"Depends on the time of year. You can always catch fish around that area if you know where to look. Best time to fish that area is early and later in the season. Otherwise, it is off to Steamboat or Mckenzie Bay."
1125257,teddi,2009-07-31 06:03:00,349,"steamboat isn,t that far from goose bay. only about 10 minuites by boat. fishing in steamboat has been very good for the past couple of weeks. hope it stays good for the rest of the summer."

1125283,bushy,2009-07-31 07:35:00,17,Coming up to Gold Pines Aug. 8 -14. Usually fish in Steamboat. What has been the bait of choice? Thinking about how many crawlers to buy on the way up. Is it more of a minnow bite this year with the cool summer? Thanks
1125391,Guest,2009-07-31 13:52:00,0,"budm: I just got done talking to a friend, they were up there last week. Said the fishing was pretty good, despite all the rain. He said that Lunker Point was good, and right inside the narrows at Steam boat was really good too. Now he's just likes to anchor, so don't be afraid to do a little trolling. Leeches and 1/2 crawlers on chart jigs was his method of choice. If I were you, I would try a bottom bouncer or a Lindy rig. Back troll or use your electric if you got one. He also said the Stumps inside the Mouth of the river was also producing. Use a 4 foot lead, slow death hook, red, and a chart and orange bead. Use a #6 red hook for the leeches, same lead, same bead combo, this is my go to method. And don,t be afraid to use a little bit bigger minnow this time of year, suckers if you can find them. 3-6 inches can be good this time of year. I hope this helps you. PS If you go down to Steamboat, go all the way down and try the point, it has a real good drop off, could be good. Also, from there, go south as if you were heading to the Shanty narrows, and fish the 3rd island on the south side, look for a wind blowing in there, I,ve had good luck there too."
1125648,Hump,2009-08-01 20:04:00,578,"Just returned from the NW section of Lac Seul. weather was chilly and rain most of the week. Off and on all week. Most of the people were heading to Steamboat. we fished the santuary, goose Bay and Lunker along with other islands. We had a mayfly hatch and the walleyes were still scattered. We caught fish, but alot were small until the last day. I lost count the number of 18"" to 26"" walleyes. Unbelievable morning. Fishing pressure is down. Saw a couple of camps with 1 or 2 vehicles in camp. Our camp had 2 empty cabins and that is unusual."
1125772,Guest,2009-08-02 12:55:00,0,Thanks for the info guys I never fished Lac Seul much. I'm thinking maybe of getting back into the fishing camp business. So I'm trying to do a little leg work to see if the fishing is good around the camp.
1125795,Hump,2009-08-02 14:33:00,578,Is that camp for sale?
