572659,WallySlayer,2008-04-07 08:21:00,4,Has anyone been in to Brace. I realize it is under new ownership but feel free to share your experience there so I know what to expect. I am going in to Brace Lake Outfitters in Audust for 7 days and need some help from past visitors. I would like some information on best lure colors for walleye and large northerns as well as the best spots on the lake to fish. Thanks all and look forward to your responses.

On Meta we used jigs with twister tails and minnow type lures when trolling. For pike we used Johnson Silver Minnows with twister tails."

I was informed that the fishing was much better in Brace than it was in Meta that is why I chose Brace Lake. Also Brace lake has not had any fishing pressure for the last two years which will be even more of an asset. I have a lot of twister tails and jig heads etc which colors did you find were the most successful?.."
572689,ONE TIME DAVE,2008-04-09 06:06:00,110,Chartruse is our standby. Also have some white and black.
572735,WallySlayer,2008-04-11 01:31:00,4,Thanks a lot One Time Dave. I will be sure to restock the Chartruse in my tackle box before we head in. Do you remember if you did alot of trolling to catch your fish or just still fishing?.. I looked at the Brace Lake Outfitters website and there are some nice big fish in the pictures so I am more excited each passing day........
572736,Guest,2008-04-11 05:54:00,0,We did some trolling but mostly jigged for eyes and cast spoons for pike. What is the web site for Brace Lake Outfitters? Good luck.
572746,WallySlayer,2008-04-11 14:15:00,4,"Thanks again Dave, The website is at http://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com there is a photo section there that shows some nice catches."
572747,SSH,2008-04-11 15:13:00,526,"Wow, the photos include ones with wooden boats. Current photo's ???? Interesting !!!!"
572904,Guest,2008-04-16 04:21:00,0,Yes I think they are current photos. From what I understand there are some Cedar Strip boats and a few Aluminum boats there as well.
