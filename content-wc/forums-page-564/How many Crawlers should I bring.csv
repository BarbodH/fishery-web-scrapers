1125052,RStroner,2009-07-30 12:04:00,1,"My wife and I are going to Lac Seul (Onaway Lodge) on the 14th of Aug. and we are stopping at Cabela's in Owatonna, MN. to get our crawlers. Talked to them and they will have your crawlers ready (give them 2-3 days notice), packed in approved material for $55 a flat or $3.50 for 2 dozen ready for you to pick up."
1124037,maverick,2009-07-26 20:27:00,24,"I just got back from Lost Island Lodge today...we were up there for 5 days. We brought two flats of crawlers for 6 guys and brought back 1 1/2 flats. The fish were bting well, but jigs tipped with minnows were out performing crawlers on a jig or Lindy Rig by two to one consistently. I would bring minimal crawlers and plan on buying minnows. We went through 30 dozen in 5 days...but hey, What's another $25 per person to catch more fish...a drop in the bucket as far as I am concerned. Say Hello to Shane from Jim and Scott..."
1124053,Steve of Madison,2009-07-26 22:04:00,230,"Just got back over the weekend from LS, crawlers were out performing minnows on everything, backtrolling, jigs and slipbobering."
1124063,joeman79,2009-07-26 23:12:00,417,"Guess I will stick with plan A: Bring 80 dozen crawlers, a pound of leeches and buy minnows at Lodge. 5 Days and a wake up!!!"
1124640,Luvnwalleyes,2009-07-28 20:30:00,14,"Joe: I was at Lost Island Lodge last week and although we caught fish on both crawlers and minnows, minnows did not outfish crawlers two to one. I think your plan for a combination of bait will work well for you. Good luck."
1124706,Mike Kansas,2009-07-29 06:54:00,1463,Might want to stick a couple pieces of Dynamite in too. Sirmanski
1124743,joeman79,2009-07-29 09:35:00,417,"praying for nice weather, 3 more days. hoping the fishing stands up to the Legend of Lac Seul, but either way I will have a great time and enjoy CANADA. Sunday afternoon I will be in Heaven on earth."
1124751,Mike Kansas,2009-07-29 09:54:00,1463,Have a great one Buddy and enjoy all you do. Work that jig slow and bend that rod. Say Hi to the Lost Island gang from me. Mike Kansas
1124824,jignminow,2009-07-29 15:33:00,168,"yeah, it's always a good idea to mess with the border guys. And when you are arguing your point to them, I am willing to wager that you will be told to pull over and have your stuff searched......probably not worth it."
1124853,joeman79,2009-07-29 17:30:00,417,"Your right jigandminnow and when the Bait man was here to get my order yesterday I decided not to do it, I don't want to screw anything up. Whats another 30 bucks. I talk big, but my concience and thoughts of being turned back over rode my greediness, and thoughts of convienence. It's way easier to answer the simple questions at the border honestly. I know from past expierence those guys can read your body language and know if you are telling the truth. For What it's worth. Joe"
1124893,jignminow,2009-07-29 19:41:00,168,always always always look them square in the eye when they question you. If you look away or down while answering it raises suspicions.
1123537,joeman79,2009-07-24 10:18:00,417,"Hey all you Lac Seul freaks! I am leaving in a week for Lac Seul, Our group is gonna be either 11 or 12. Going to fish 5 days. Need to order worms by wednesday and wondering what you Lac Seul veterans would suggest for how many Crawlers I should bring. I have 80 dozen ordered right now. Thats 8 dozen a piece for the week. I suppose we will buy some minnows but at over 4.50 a dozen I have a hard time buying them. Any help would be great. Joe"
1123554,2746,2009-07-24 11:07:00,3206,"If all your going to use is crawlers then you could use another flat for 12 guys. On the other hand, I wouldn't put ""all my eggs in one basket"". If they are hitting on minnows or leeches better than crawlers then I've learned $4.50/doz doesn't seem so high."
1123558,joeman79,2009-07-24 11:17:00,417,Yeah thats what I was thinking to. One guy says he is gonna buy a pound of leeches and I suppose we will take some minnows with us everyday. Last year on Red Lake Minnows caught more and bigger fish for me. And more northerns also.
1123583,2746,2009-07-24 12:53:00,3206,Where at Lac Seul? We are going to Gullrock on the 8th and Onaway on Lac Seul on the 22nd.
1123598,fishinnut 3446,2009-07-24 14:02:00,638,"We just got back from Eagle lake,was there 11-18,took a flat of crawlers($53) with and when we crossed the border bought a pound of leeches($46),I was thinking the same way $4.50 dz,i'll take my own bait,guess what,cold front,15-30mph wind just about every day,3 1/2-4 days of rain,new Mayfly hatch!with that said they were'nt bitting on crawlers&leeches most fish was hitting the fatheads(about $125 worth!)Not the best fishing cond. but we did catch some and took my wife,2 kids&my Godson so from me its about the memories so much more peacful up north can't wait til next year!!Good luck,Jamie."
1123633,Dog Fish Dave,2009-07-24 16:04:00,8,We are going to need 8 dozen a day per person!
1123650,joeman79,2009-07-24 17:57:00,417,"Yeah and Your buyin hound dog. We are going to Lost Island Lodge. Hopefully the weather will warm up a little. LOTS of RAIN in forecast. I aint gonna jinx my luck by predicting weather or Mayfly hatch. It will be what it is and we will have a blast no matter what. I hope we can find some smallies in the morning and night to mess around with, I love the way they pull. I will bring an extra Benny for minnows. Don't forget to bring the Cheese ya Cheesehead."
1123652,hogridnfool,2009-07-24 18:07:00,349,"joeman79- are you ordering your crawlers from a Canadian bait dealer and picking them there or are you bringing them in from the States? If the latter, they cannot be in dirt or you will be forced to dispose of them at the border."
1123672,joeman79,2009-07-24 19:53:00,417,"I sell bait in the U.S. and yeah I know abut the bedding. I am gonna try something this year and will probably get caught, but I am gonna take a Case of crawlers that come from Canada already in foam containers that have from Canada Stamped on them and see what they say. IT's Canadian Dirt or Peat whatever they come in. Probably a dumb idea, but I have to try just because I want to hear the explanation why I can not take crawlers from canada that are in canada boxes (Sealed by the way) into Canada. And I will have 2 flats in bedding also. Worth a shot."
1123696,hogridnfool,2009-07-24 22:15:00,349,Keep us informed aboot taking Canadian crawlers back into Canada. I have four boxes of them that I bought back to the US this last month and if it works for you I'll try taking them back to Canada when I go back up this Sept..
