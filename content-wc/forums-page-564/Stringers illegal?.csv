1124191,Larry Mac,2009-07-27 12:17:00,530,"Hi Steve of Madison, Yes, we definitely had that happen in the past (northern going after a stringer LOL). Obabikon's example does apply to us, we fish remote and portage lakes in Canada. Most of our gear is in a ruck sack (Military back pack). We fish smaller lodge boats and travel, so room, weight and space has to be managed. Like Jig man said we too are fortunate to catch fish relatively close to lunch or dinner. We are conservation fisherman and only keep (2) fish per man under 18"" in length. We feel they taste better and it is always enough. Have a great dayThank you,Larry Mac"
1124260,elway12,2009-07-27 16:44:00,335,"Thanks everyone for all of your feedback. Here are some clarifications etc. We were in NW Ontario at Lake Savant. Which is region 4? We consider all fish on our stringer to be caught and retained for eating etc. As one perosn put it is a good/one way to keep them alive alittle longer til we get back and fillet them. We fish 3/boat so keeping an extra cooler or larger one plus gear is just more than we can most times handle. Does anyone or can anyone find the written rules for this ""no stringer"" thing if it exsists? I looked through the Ontario fishing guidllines and could not find it anywhere AND not a sniff about killing a fish when you catch it."
1124271,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-27 17:46:00,298,"I just read the regulations and did not find any specific reference to stringers or live wells. I did, however, find reference to possessing live fish on certain bodies of water, such as Lac Seul. I found it listed under ""Exceptions to Zone 4 Regulations"". It reads as follows: ""No person may possess any live fish taken by angling other than bait-fish."" I did not see it as an exception on Lake Savant, but you may want to take a closer look."
1124320,Obabikon,2009-07-27 20:56:00,2370,I wouldn't even look any farther... I can't imagine it being a legit rule.
1124347,Catman59,2009-07-28 04:46:00,345,"On the remote lakes that we hike to , we use a wet burlap gunny sack as our livewell. It works well and you can keep it cool and moist. There is no way or room to have a cooler full of ice along in a 12 ft boat. We walk a mile or so , the less to carry in and out --- the better."
1124409,Steve of Madison,2009-07-28 09:10:00,230,"Just for clarification, when we talk about a cooler with ice, it's no bigger than 20"" long and holding only enough ice to cover the bottom. (I don't keep anything over 18"", and particularly Northern) If you use more ice than that, when the ice melts you now have created a live well. I noticed this year a group in camp had a collapseable insulated fish bag, that they put ice in, and when they came back at night it still had ice and the caught fish. I'm going to look for one of these things, sure takes up less room in the boat, moldable, and it works."
1124019,elway12,2009-07-26 19:11:00,335,Just got back from NW Ontario and had a very good fishing trip. Something that was brought up that had me and my fishing buddies shaking our heads. We were out fishing and a guy from a another camp talked to us and said that the game officials had been on the upper end of the lake and had given fines out for people having stringers w/fish? We had/have never heard of this? I have read through the Ontario regs and could not find anything on it and I asked 2 of the workers at our fishing camp and they had never heard of it either BUT???
1124028,Larry Mac,2009-07-26 19:31:00,530,"Hi Elway12, I hope you had a great trip. I must say I have never heard that one before. I have heard about not culling walleyes on a stringer using the philosophy that a fish on a stringer is a dead fish. Which lake were you fishing? Have a great day.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1124035,Obabikon,2009-07-26 20:02:00,2370,"Certain lakes have different rules. But, LOTW's does allow stringers. Also, if you KILL the fish on Lac Seul, it can be on the stringer."
1124098,Guest,2009-07-27 07:30:00,0,Why drag fish along in 70 to 80 degree water all day and in and out of the boat? Use an ice coler and ice the fish down after they are caught. They are much easier to clean and will taste alot better then the ones par boiled after being on a stringer all day in high water temps.
1124103,Larry Mac,2009-07-27 07:50:00,530,"Hi Guest, I agree with your example utilizing those circumstances. I have been fishing in Canadian waters for many years and it has been very successful for us utilizing a stringer in their cool waters. We do not stringer the fish through the gills and they are very much alive when we return to camp. There is nothing like the taste of fresh walleye in the Canadian North. Have a great dayThank you,Larry Mac"
1124128,Jimmy Jig,2009-07-27 08:51:00,1905,It all depends on which lake or lakes you are fishing. LacSuel area the fish most be killed when kept. The Dryden area that is not the case. NW Ontario is a very big area. You have to know the laws in the area you are fishing. Many people never read or know the laws and thats when the trouble starts when the Warden shows up!
1124132,Steve of Madison,2009-07-27 09:05:00,230,"If you do that on Lac Seul you are in violation and will most certainly be fined. LS and other Ontario waters are must Kill lakes if you are not going to release the fish immediately. The practice of culling fish or keeping them on a stringer or in a live well during the day stresses those fish to the point that studies have shown that when released, even though they swim away apparently not harmed, most will die within a day or two. I was warned by a warden that even though I put the fish in a cooler with ice, if checked, and the fish is still alive (in the cooler) I will be fined, so I crack the neck right behind the head and then put them in the cooler.Just curious...have you ever had a big Northern or Muskie come up and grab a fish or 2 off your stringer? 2 small fish that I released have been grabbed by a big Pike right by the boat over the years, I can imagine that stringer of fish can look real tempting to a big Pike."
1124156,Jig Man,2009-07-27 10:17:00,95,We have had that happen to us on flyin's that is why now do not start keeping walleye until just before we are ready to eat. We can always find a honey hole that will guarantee fish for the stringer. From an entertainment standpoint it was exciting watching the northern attack the stringer.
1124160,Obabikon,2009-07-27 10:23:00,2370,"What if you're camping, and don't have access to ice? What if you're on a canou trip and don't have the room for a cooler? It's not always simple. While our camp always uses coolers for fish, I can see why a stringer would still come in handy. Even if the fish have to be killed."
1124188,troutaholic,2009-07-27 12:09:00,827,"Caught a nice 25""'er that I wanted to show the other boat when they came in before releasing it. Went back to the cabin and told the deckhand that when the other boat came in, to show them the 'eye and release it. Put it on a stringer and the deckhand tied it to the dock. I went to make breakfast. My friend came in about 10 minutes later and said, ""That looked like it would have been a nice-looking walleye"". I looked at him and he said that a musky or northern must have made it their breakfast. I went down to the dock, and by the time I got there, a huge snapper had come back to finish off the 'eye. The deckhands had actually caught the 60lb+ snapper!! The resort ownere did not want us to kill it for the potluck that night, so the deckhands took it out to one of the islands and released it. Yummmmm, fried turtle would have been a tasty treat....."
