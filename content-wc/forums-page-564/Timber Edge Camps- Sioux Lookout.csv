We tow our boat with our minivan, which does not ride as high as desired for such a launch, so we put our trailer on the owner's truck to launch and load up. There is no charge if you launch/load yourself, he charges $10 each time you use his truck. Our boat is 16.5 ft, I've seen boats up to 18 ft launched & loaded with no problem, maybe some wading to push it off."
