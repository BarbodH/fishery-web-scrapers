1124828,MN_Moose,2009-07-29 15:54:00,965,Not Ontario side but it's as close as you can get. Baystore Camp on Oak Islands North side. Frank and Laura are great. http://www.baystorecamp.com/
1122914,bigtimeelectric,2009-07-22 07:39:00,174,"can someone tell me which resorts or cabins for rent there is on the ontario side of nw angle.. we would like to put in at the angle and boat into a camp up north a bit... I know frolanders has a nice place there, but we would prefer to do our own cooking and do our own thing. I just can't find anywhere that tells me what is available in that specific area... our goup consists of lac seul veterans looking for a 2nd trip closer to home for walleyes and the outside possibility of catching a musky!!! or perhaps we could stay at the angle and boat up to where the fish are biting everyday?I have no idea I'm just guessing the fishing gets better the further you get from the population? maybe we could hamer em right off the dock.. anyway I'd appreciate some inside intell? thanks"

1123030,bigtimeelectric,2009-07-22 14:16:00,174,this place looks great. is there anywhere else?
1123110,aggie kolisnik,2009-07-22 18:54:00,39,Hi! We are close to where you want to be. email me at [email protected] and I'll give you more info if you are interested. thanks A.K.
1123228,Thumpr50,2009-07-23 09:19:00,139,"I have stayed at Angle Outpost for several years, in the angle but only 10-15 minutes by boat to Ontario water, Dave and Jessica are great hosts. There is also a resort in the Big Narrows area-I believe it is Big Narrows Resort-that looks nice have never been there."
1123642,alanexpup,2009-07-24 17:10:00,278,I have thought about the angle but the pictures i see are all of big boats with downriggers off the back not the little boats you normally get from a resort. also the lake right there looks like lake michigan one big body of water with no islands to break the wind. I think it better up north with all the islands and trees.
1123645,rockpt,2009-07-24 17:28:00,589,I think you're confusing the Angle with the South Shore.
1124148,Ia Walihntr,2009-07-27 10:01:00,320,"Bigtimeelectric, Here is a list of Ontario resorts near Angle Inlet:www.blackhawkislandcamp.comwww.bellislandoutpost.cawww.spruceislandcamp.comwww.frolanderresort.comwww.monumentbay.com All off these resorts are in Ontario waters and not all that far from Angle Inlet. Blackhawk Island resort is on the north side of the entrance to Angle Inlet. Spruce Island Camp is about 7 miles east of Oak Island near the entrance to Tug Channel. Bell Island Outpost is about 2 miles south of Spruce Island Camp and on the south edge of McPherson Island. Frolander Island Resort I believe is located near the Northeast end of Monument Bay. Monument Bay Lodge is located at the south entrance of Monument Bay.By the way, Bell Island Outpost is already represented in this thread. Hope this helps. Marv"
1124172,Jay Merics,2009-07-27 11:32:00,21,Monument Bay Lodge is no more. It closed a couple years ago and i believe it is now a private camp owned by Marvin Windows?
