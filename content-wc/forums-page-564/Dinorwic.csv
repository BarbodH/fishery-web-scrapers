Want to wish you the best, cause after we have been there, my wife will have caught all the good ones. She's a 2yr veteran of the lake but has more luck than one can imagine.we usually stay at brown bay camp. great people, and they run a tight ship."
1124127,jackiespank,2009-07-27 08:50:00,3,I believe it's called Pine Sunset Lodge. It appears the folks that run this one are from Wisconsin. Good luck to you.

If you're going to stay on Dinorwic, the only advice I can offer you is to get a good map and watch out for rocks. They sell a great map in Dryden that has a lot of the hidden rocks marked on it and is quite detailed. There's a website that sells them too if you're interested, I've got the web address at home, just let me know if you want it. Where ever you get it, go over it with the camp owners and have them mark any rocks/reefs that might not be already marked. Some of them are less than a foot under the water and aren't in a spot where you'd normally expect them and they'd tear stuff up if you went across them. Good luck & have fun!"
1124362,Babamel2,2009-07-28 06:05:00,414,"Pine Sunset Camp has a map of dinorwic on their web site that shows dangerous rocks. The Brown Bay Camp website has a link to the Dryden Yacht club with GPS locations of rocks less than 10 ft from the surface. Many of those present no danger to fishing boats. There is no inidication of depth, so many may well be more that 2ft down."
1125260,jackiespank,2009-07-31 06:23:00,3,"Thanks for the advice about rocks. Good stuff. yes, I will take any and all websites and suggestions for stores and/or maps."
1125656,172EYES,2009-08-01 20:37:00,22,"Do a search, I posted on this a couple of times over the years. We had to work to find fish but found them out on mid lake rocks. Lots of numbers. Everything i read now says shallow presentations in the stained water."
