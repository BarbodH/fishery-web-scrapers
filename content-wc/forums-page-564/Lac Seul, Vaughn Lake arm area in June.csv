1125066,Jig Man,2009-07-30 13:03:00,95,How did you get the hook out?
1125086,Chicago_Cheech,2009-07-30 14:08:00,3,My partner in the boat used a piece of braided line on on each barbed bend and a third line was tied to the eye of the hook. The hooks not stuck in face were cut off. I held the line tied to the eye and he yanked on the ones tied to the hooks. Popped right out.Had seen the how-to on some fishing show a long while back.
