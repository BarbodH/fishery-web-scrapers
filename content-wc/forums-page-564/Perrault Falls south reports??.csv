Then it's off to Minneapolis to pick up my son and we're north to Gold Arrow Camp just south of Perrault Falls for this year's 2nd trip. Anyone have a recent report (last two weeks or so) from the lakes to the south of Perrault - Cliff, Ord, etc.? We won't fish Cedar, but would love to hear from anyone who's been on it recently. And, just in case anyone who's stayed at Gold Arrow or Pickerel Creek Camp during July is reading this, how's the fishing on Pickerel, Caribou, Fleet, Schultz lakes?Thanks for any recent news."
