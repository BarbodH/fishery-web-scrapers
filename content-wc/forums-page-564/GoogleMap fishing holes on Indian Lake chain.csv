My initial reaction has always been ""ask your camp operator"" ... especially since people were sometimes specific about the time of year they would be there (e.g. last week in June, Labor Day, whenever). But I decided that was kind of pointless since the fish move around alot depending upon the season & weather and I wanted to fulfill their request. So I finally created a Google Maps map of the most popular holes in Forest, Whitney and Cobble lakes for such inquiries (plus a few extra points in the area such as camps/lodges) and thought I'd share them with y'all. The link to the map is below.http://www.bolen.net/html/canada/gmap-fishingholes.htm Good Fishing, 81Saluki P.S. If anyone wants to share GPS coordinates of other holes on the chain (especially in Edwards and Indian (Alexandra) Lakes, let me know and I'll add them to the map ... with an attribution ""courtesy of [your name]"" if desired."
