Was looking for Leeches when we arrived and had a difficult time finding them. Did find 1 - 1/2 pound bag at Al's for $25. Nothing anywhere else in town. The gas station on the corner of 664 & 72 did not have them and do not carry them that often. So we found J&Ds about 5 miles south of 664 & 72 on the west side of the road just before the Fireside camp enterence. This place was great! Think the lady's name who helped me was Diana. The had a great product, very fresh and active Leeches for $42/lb. I would recommend that anyone looking to purchase bait to go directly to J&D's."

Leeches on a bare, gold hook sure seemed to be the ticket for our trip. PAUL"
1125906,Skiball,2009-08-02 21:25:00,82,Thanks T-Mac. I think we'll give J&D a try. I know right where their at. Happy FishingSkiball.
1118431,Skiball,2009-07-04 15:41:00,82,We've been ging to Lac Seul for many years and we were lookin for new places to purchase minnows. We travel through Hudson and Sioux Lookout to get to Mahkwa and we needed a new spot to buy nice walleye minnows. Any help would be appreciate.Skiball
1118454,fishman10,2009-07-04 19:52:00,226,als sports has real nice dace minnows. i have been sentenced to 2 years work at the new hospital site and am forced to fish every night. and i am happy to report that i have not missed 1 day yet.
1118508,Luvnwalleyes,2009-07-05 07:16:00,14,I've bought minnows at Al's before as well and would recommend his shop too. Very friendly and the price is reasonable. Good luck.
1118534,tcasica,2009-07-05 09:35:00,14,"I also prefer Al's but we've purchased at a shop in Hudson (west of town on the right) and at the Gas Station on the corner of 664 and 72. Their is another store on 72, Ojibway I think, on the left before you get to town."
1118545,Guest,2009-07-05 10:55:00,0,You can buy wholesale bait across the road from Andersons camp south of Sioux Lookout. I think it's called Jd bait? I might be wrong. They have a small sign on the highway on the west side of the highway
1118695,Guest,2009-07-06 01:38:00,0,"Can you tell me what town Al's is in because I'm heading to lake Minnitaki, right south of Sioux Lookout and looking for some good minnows also."
1118777,T-MacMN,2009-07-06 10:53:00,8,"J&D bait about 7 miles before Sioux Lookout. They are one of the primary wholesalers in the area - good prices, generous counts good quality."
1118820,jswinter40,2009-07-06 13:25:00,127,"hey guys good topic. We have always gone to Ojibway but that is because it was the first place we stopped not because we shopped around. This place is fine but I am interested as to what Al's and this JD place is like in terms of price. Do these places actually count each minnow to get the dozen because Ojibway does and its $4.59/dozen of medium minnows (mixture of species, fatheads and dace mostly)? On Saturday the 27th of June we went to get bait at Ojibway and they were not open at 6:00am --she has always been there--(tried again closer to 7:00 and she still wasn't there). so we decided to try to look for bait in SL and Al's was the first place we came to and guess what, Closed???? so had to get crappy minnows at DJ's GAs Station in SL and they were laughable at best. SO if you would give so pricing, hours, and service details for Al's and JD's I would greatly appreciate it."
1118974,tcasica,2009-07-07 05:23:00,14,"fsh4evr, Al's is located in downtown Sioux Lookout. When driving from the south on 72 go under the railroad bridge and turn right at the intersection (front street). Al's will be on the left hand side of the street."
1120104,Guest,2009-07-10 23:57:00,0,I think I will make a little trip into Sioux Lookout someday when I get there. Let you know how the fishin' goes when I return.
