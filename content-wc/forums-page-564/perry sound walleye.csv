Well, I am trying to talk him into fishing for walleye, and he seems willing. Now all I got to do is come up with a starting strategy, so working on first time approach. As a midwest troller, was gonna rely on some of my favorite cranks to get started. Rigging is an option, so dont want to discount that. What else should I consider? Sorry thats parry sound and pickeral (walleye)."
