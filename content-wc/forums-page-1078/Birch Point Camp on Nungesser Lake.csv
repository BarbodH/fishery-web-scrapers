I want to take my family to Birch Piont Camp. I would like to hear some pro's and con's about this lodge as this will be my first time there. Can any one out there give me some honest answers about the fishing, their cabins, their food and their equipment? How are the Green's as hosts? Thank You Terrence A. Mitchell Newton, Iowa"
