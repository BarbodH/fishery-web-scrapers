In these cases, they stayin the Woman lakearea and portage into the Shab. for day trips. The lake is known for good numbers but not for huge walleye. Although I've not flown with Lac Suel Airways , I have stayed in the motel rooms the air service provides for it's fly-in clients. I consider them reliable people. Staying in the motel is handy for me on short trips to Lac Suel. Good Luck, No Fish"
