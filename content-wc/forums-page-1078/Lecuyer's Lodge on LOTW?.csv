I can say enough good about his operation & staff. Be good the lake and she will be good to you. Tight Lines Jerry Armstrong"

The owner is full of baloney to be polite and he talks a good talk but does not back it up. He gave us a guide who was 15 or 16 years old and when it came to shore lunch, he wasn't sure how to clean fish. The area is heavily fished and I have to believe there are several other choices in LOTW that would be superior. I have always had good luck at the Obabikon Bay camp. The best guide their is Bill Looney. Please, consider shopping more before settling on Lecuyers!"
