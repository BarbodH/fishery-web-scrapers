The majority of the best fishing spots are fish sanctuaries, with the exeption of erindale park which is in between hwy 5 and burnamthorpe rd. spring rainbows and browns are running as we speak but the shores are littered with city fishermen. Its just not fun to fish there right now, although, fishing when it rains can be pretty good because all the cell phone boys seem to melt in the rain."
