I realize the beauty and peacefulness is not the same as a ""great north"" lake, but the fishing is incredible.LindyRigger"
507041,masterangler,2000-03-31 09:08:00,2,Dear Rivereye: How are you fine i hope. When is the best time of the year to come up there to fish?
507042,River_eye,2000-03-31 14:50:00,1486,"I'm doing pretty good, thankyou for asking. Generally, the fishing is really good most of the time. Are you wondering about any spots/lakes in particular? The only time I'd try to avoid, is the month of July. There is usually a little gap in there where the sun is really hot, there is no wind and the walleye's don't want to bite. I mainly fish the Winnipeg river, and if I was planning a fishing trip, I'd set it for the end of may, or beginning of June. Great walleye action, plus great smallmouth action. The walleye fishing gets really good again in August, and the weather is nicer, but the smallmouths are scattered and hard to find.[font size=""4"" color=""green"" font face=""signature""]River eye[/font]"
507038,Guest,2000-04-01 15:42:00,0,"If you are really interested in a great place for trophy walleye, pike, and Smallmouth fishing you need to check out Tetu Island Lodge. I believe that they have a web site. I was on a fishing trip there last july when In-fisherman was there. They have so many walleyes that in one day between two boats they boated 97 walleyes over 22"" and 19 walleyes over 26"". I couldn't believe the great fishing. They had an article about the walleye fishing in the December issue of In-fisherman, Angling Adventures for 2000, I believe. They also caught Trophy Northern Pike and Trophy Smallies to go along with the hot Walleye action. Tetu is the Ultimate fishing vacation. They fish out of custom built 1750 crestliner fishhawks with 50hp. Yamaha four strokes. The cabins and service are unbelivable. The food is all U.S. Prime beef (New York Strip, Steak Oscar, Prime Rib, and BBQ Ribs) At this place you can fish from 7:00 am. to 8:00 pm. if you want. It's not like other places where it is 8:30 am. to 4:00 pm. I give Tetu Lodge Five Stars, this is Truly the Ultimate Fishing Vacation."
507057,Guest,2000-04-03 11:46:00,0,"I have been to Tetu Lodge three times in the past two years. I have had great fishing for all species, Walleyes and Bass in June, Northerns and Walleyes in September. The people at Tetu have the best service and food in the business. Great customer service and the meals are all USDA Prime Beef. The guides are just about the best in the business. I just recieved my confirmation letter for my two trips this year and it looks like every single guide is coming back and also half of their girls. I can't wait to fish out of their new Crestliner fish hawks."
507058,Guest,2000-04-08 18:35:00,0,"I couldn't agree more with the suggestion of Tetu island lodge. I have stayed there numerous times during the past few years and plan to stay there as much as my schedule allows from now on! I have never seen a lodge before that has so much to offer. Start with the fishing...one word... AWESOME! Huge walleyes and monster pike would definately be their specialty, but smallmouth have their days. As far as staff,equipment,and facilities go they are second to none! New boats and motors (with casting decks)and guides who are not only clean english speaking pros, but also know what they are doing at all times.Every guide there has his own lowrance or pinpoint graph and actually knows how to use them, no stupid fish id going off all day with some clown who drank too much the night before dozing off and mumbling some incoherent jibberish all day. For those of you who have had a guide like this before you know where I'm coming from. I think the other guys described the quality of the food pretty well, but no one talked about the quantity. My god talk about beefs worse enemy, I've met the demon and his name is ED. This man believes in the power of meat and proves it by serving steaks just slightly larger than a bread box, and don't worry he hasn't forgot the ""other white meat"" for breakfast he likes to kick you off with a small family of chickens and a slab of bacon so big that if you can't finish it you simply put a leash on it and walk it down to the dock with you! (Don't even get me started on the shorelunches!!!)I strongly suggest you give them a call and ask to speak to the person in charge, but if Kathi is busy Ed can probably help you to."

507046,Guest,2000-02-14 14:41:00,0,"I would suggest Hidden Island Resort on Lake of the Woods out of Morson, Ontario. Mid-summer fishing is excellent. The fish are mainly on the reefs and there are over 150 reefs within 3 miles of the dock. Avg. size W is 16 to 22 inches. There are also lots of northerns. Muskies are also cruising the area. They are located on an island and have nice accomodations. They pick you up at the dock in Morson. The owner, Don Larsen, is a great guy. He will give you marked maps of the area, or you can hire a guide. Boats (including gas), lodging, and great food for $89 per day. If you want drive up and relaxing fishing, this is it.

507047,Guest,2000-02-20 09:22:00,0,Try Lindbergh's Reindeer Lake Lodge in Saskatchewan. Went there last year and caught several pike over 20lbs. No smallmouth though.
507048,Guest,2000-02-20 10:22:00,0,Go to the All Canada show in Green Bay next week.I've been going to Canada for a long time and for the last six years to a outfitter named Ogoki Frontier out of Thunder Bay and Armstrong.Took my wife last summer for her first trip now she is mad that she isn't going we me and our sons this summer.Paul Boucher the owner treats his customers very well.Went moose hunting with him in 98 and have anothermoose trip booked for 01.His web site is www.ogokifrontier.comTell him that Dave Miller sent you
507049,Guest,2000-02-21 21:11:00,0,"Up here in Ontario, Lake Nippising is excellent with up to 12 pound walleye caught. It's located in North Bay. If you need info e-mail me."
507050,Dave,2000-03-17 03:02:00,258,I've been going to Lake of the Woods Houseboats out of Reed Narrows (Sioux Narrows area) for twelve years. The owners are U.S. citizens and treat you very good. With six in your group a 44' boat would be the perfect size. Contact them at (I hope this is correct) www.ccco/hboat/ OR search for Lake of the Woods Houseboats. One 14' or 16' Lund fishing boat (no motor) is included with the rental. With that fishing boat and one or two you trailer you will not be displeased.

507053,Guest,2000-03-21 09:01:00,0,Jerry and Ellies Cedar Lake Camp on Cedar Lake is a great spot for smallies at the time of the year you are looking at. Accomodations are great. rates are about $315 per person for a week. Includes everything except bait and food. Clean friendly camp. Muskies are just starting to get going at this time of the year and you have access to Perrault lake also. Been there and loved it. They have an e mail but I don't have it at hand. E-mail me at [email protected] and I'll get it from my address book.
507054,Ron,2000-03-23 17:56:00,387,"Got to agree with Clancy (message #7) !!!You would be hard pressed to beat Crowduck Lake for the numbers and sizes of walleye and smallmouths. Throw in the occasional pike and what a trip ! Beautiful, remote Manitoba scenery and hospitality that can't be beat. I've been there 3 times in the last 1 1/2 years and had a blast each time. Good luck where ever you choose to go !"
507055,Guest,2000-03-26 20:39:00,0,I agree that Crowduck is a good lake but one thing was not mentioned. Crowduck does have a lots of walleyes but it's all catch and release. You can keep smallmouths and trophy northerns. There are other lakes that you can portage to where you can catch and keep walleyes. Saddle lake is one of them. Good walleye lake. Have a 27-1/2 incher on the wall from there. If you go up there say Hi to Bill.
507033,Guest,2000-02-09 11:14:00,0,"I'm looking to put together a fishing trip for about 6 people to Canada for late July or early August of this year. Does anyone have any places that they go to or have been to that they would recommend? Interested in walleye, smallmouth, and northerns. Would be leaving from the Green Bay area and would prefer not having to trailer our own boats. All types considered, i.e. fly-ins, drive-ins, etc. If you could include the phone numbers and possibly the prices of the places, if available, would appreciate it. Thanks."
507034,Guest,2000-02-09 17:56:00,0,"Hello, I am a pro angler that has a GREAT suggestion for winter walleyes. Visit the Red River near Winnipeg Manitoba. At the Lockport Dam there is increadable walleye fishing. The fish are on avarage about 5-7 lbs with the odd 12 pounder! Use a 1/4 oz. jig with a Berkly 3inche PowerShad Chart. Colour. Good Luck and safe fishing!."
507035,Rick,2000-02-09 20:46:00,226,"I've always had a great time at Eagle Lake. It's a drive-up. The lake has numerous lodges which offer good value and great facilities (cabins, food, boats, etc). I have created a website which contains lots of info about the lake and travelling to Canada for fishing (rules and regs, crossing the border, etc). The website has numerous links to lodges on the lake. My brother and I will be up there the first part of Aug.Check out my website at:http://wwa.com/~rmryan/Eagle_Lake/eagle_lake.htmlRick"
507036,chrism,2000-02-10 08:57:00,429,"There are many lodges that offer what you are after in western Ontario/Manitoba. There are three that come to mind that have what you are after - all are on the Winnipeg River system (Manitoba side) - Trail end Camp, Eagle Nest Lodge< and Pine Island Lodge. The latter two have webpages (try a search). There is pretty good fishing at all three, although Pine Isle/Eaglenest are remote and offer extreme wilderness (you drive to their landig docks and are then shuttled to their respective lodges upriver by boat) and have drop-jaw scenery . All offer good boat rentals. Although it would be hard to catch huge wally's during the summer, some are there...however, both lodges offer day trips to Crowduck lake, a catch and release walleye haven that will have you absolutely sick of catching good sized fish. There is a fella who frequents these pages who goes by ""rivereye"" - he would be the one to talk to as I believe he is involved with one of the lodges and I'm sure he will be glad to give you more detail than I can. All of the above spots have northerns, smalies, and walleye.Hope this helps, e-mail me if you have any more questions - ie what to bring, wear, weather, or maps. etc!Good luck !Chris"

I guide part time at Eagle Nest Lodge, so I'm kind of biased on which lodge to pick. Eagle Nest is a little bit more upscale, nicer boats, nicer layout. But in any case, both lodges are top notch (don't tell my boss I said that). There are a billion lodges out there, and what sets this fishery apart is the diversity. You can fish fast current, weeded bays, still-water, reefs and holes. The main fish are walleye, pike and smallmouth and the fun part is, no matter what you're fishing for, the other two fish are usually always there to surprise you.Another big difference is that it's only a 2 hour drive from the Winnipeg International Airport. But still extremely secluded.Oh yeah, http://www.eaglenest.mb.ca"
