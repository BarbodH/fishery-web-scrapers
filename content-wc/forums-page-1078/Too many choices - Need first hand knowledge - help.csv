Walleye is the main attraction, but want good smallmouth and a chance at a trophy northern. Would do a resort or outpost, but wish to be at the lake less than 4 hours north of Fort Francis (Drive or Drive+Flight). I am hoping to find a real good value for the $'s. We cook our own meals (we really don't eat much or on a schedule, so American Plans seem to be overkill). I am hoping to here from those who have been to some of the places in Ontario, but if you a relaying information from a reliable source, that would be great too. Hope it doesn't seem like I am asking for the world, but the Northwest Angle has treated us very well and though we want to try something different and more remote, we have elevated expectations.Thanks,Roger"

This year we're going to Lac Seul, which is a little past your four hour limit from Int'l Falls (It's almost five hours north) Like you, we always do the basic housekeeping package and cook our own. That way we can come and go as we please and not go hungry. We're staying at Scout Lake Resort (/www.heartland.on.ca/lacseul/) where the rates are pretty good. You don't have to look to far on this board to get people's opinion of La Seul. Good luck this summer.--Nate"
507023,Guest,2000-02-17 21:58:00,0,"Roger-I have went on fly outs from Ear Falls Ontario 7 times. I used Lac Seul Airways as my outfitter. They have 10 lakes to choose from, but my favorites have always been,Lakes Jenette and Mink. From Jenette we always caught our limit on walleyes, and monster Northerns, but my favorite of the 2 is Mink. We never caught very large Northerns on Mink, but we caught Walleyes all day long. When you get to the point where you're tired of catching walleyes-THATS MINK LAKE!!!! Also, you can't beat one cabin per lake which is the case on most of their 10 lakes. JEFF"
