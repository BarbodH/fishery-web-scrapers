507223,Guest,2000-02-25 20:04:00,0,Hey I've been living in Ottawa for two years now and I want to find some lakes in and around for walleye. I've been going to Montreal to fish with brother and some friends but I really want to find some spots nearer to home
507224,Guest,2000-03-02 12:01:00,0,Where do you live? I live about half way to Montreal from Ottawa and if you are going all the way to Montreal for walleye you are going too far for nothing. Right here near my place you can catch all you could want. And nice size too. Give me an email and we could swap spots. Robert[email protected]
