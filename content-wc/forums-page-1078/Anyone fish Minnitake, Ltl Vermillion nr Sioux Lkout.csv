507232,Jeremy,2000-04-10 06:37:00,76,I haven't fished Minnitake but I have fished Ltl Vermillion many times the small mouth fishing is very good and there are some very large muskie in this lake. What time of the year are you planning on going. The only place I know you can put in is the Providence park. You have to sign in and I believe it cost $5-$10 dollars a day to put in. There is also a camp on ltl Vermillion called Fireside. There are no walleyes in this lake there are lake trout but there has been a 10 year ban on them but that should be about up.
