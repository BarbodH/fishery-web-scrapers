507502,Guest,2000-04-04 16:23:00,0,"Dear Mark, As for accomidations, I couldn't say as it is been 15 yrs. since i've fished North Spirit. Although, as far north lakes go, it has a very good population of really big walleyes.It is one of those big,deep northern lakes that grow big walleye in the absence of Lake Trout. It is comparable with Gods Lake as far as big walleye . Sorry I can't give you more up to date info as I've been busy in other places. Good Luck, No Fish"
