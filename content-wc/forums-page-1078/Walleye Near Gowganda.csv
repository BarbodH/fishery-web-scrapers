On our previous 2 trips, we've mainly concentrated on Northerns, which we've done very well. All fish released including a 20 pounder. This year we are gearing up for Walleye. Any suggestions about tackle or methods such as live bait or jigs for this time of the season? Should we troll live bait spinner rigs and crank baits or fish minnows and night crawlers with a slip bobber? I realize there are alot of different presintations, I'm just trying to narrow them down because we only have one week to fish. So any one out there who has had success in this area and this time of year, your HELP will be greatly appreciated. Anyone looking for a real nice lodge to go to, visit Ed & Judy Duncan athttp//ww.lostlakelodge.com You will not be disappointed!!! THANKS"
507552,Guest,2000-04-04 15:26:00,0,Hey - tell Ed Hi - spoke to him a few times - I'm the one that stays at Breeze Creek on Duncan from Ohio..That early - I'd rely mainly on Jigs - jigs and minnows - maybe crawlers - never been on Lost Lake - on Gowganda itself - the river coming in will be hot that early - whatever runs into Lost Lake - if anything should be hot.Worm harness might be good also - SLOW...Another thing that can be great HUGE Perch in 3-4 ft of water - if the walleye are not bitting these can be loads of fun and great eating.Was the 20 lb pike from Lost Lake - how is it for big pike.]I've got some pics at http://members.ee.net/phaskins/fish.htmand some Gowganda links at http://members.ee.net/phaskins/gowganda.htmhave fun - been going to the area 16-17 years
507553,Guest,2000-04-04 23:45:00,0,"THANKS for the info Paul. I really appreciate it. The 20 pound pike was caught in Wig Wam lake which is one portage from Lost Lake. My Dad caught that fish, which is the largest pike we have caught. We have caught many fish in the 8 to 12 pound range. Bigger pike are there for sure. Another good pike lake there is Bloom which is 2 portages from Lost Lake. It's stricktly catch & release. We are trying a fly-in for a couple of days this June. Really lookig forward to that. I will tell Ed you said hello. THANKS again & good fishing."
