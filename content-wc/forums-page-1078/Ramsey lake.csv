507560,Guest,2000-04-06 11:05:00,0,"I'm assuming you are refering to Ramsey Lake, located in Sudbury, Ontario. It is deemed an ""urban"" lake, since it is located in the heart of the city and surrounded by housing (not cottages!). Although it does contain some walleye, pike and trout, it is used mainly for sailing and pleasure boating. Most anglers avoid this lake, prefering more productive and less populated lakes in the area (Vermilion Lake, lake Nippissing).-hope that this helps!"

Resources in that area (area 19 on MNR map)-good fishing!"
