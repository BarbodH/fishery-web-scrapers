2898345,Pooch,2014-06-15 04:23:00,4619,"Shore lunch is way over rated in my opinion. We gave it up fifteen years ago. Much easier to take snacks or a sandwich in the boat then do the fish preparing and cooking back in camp.I could care less what other folks do, but we got tired of all the hassle of dragging all the fixings along in the boat, setting up, cleaning fish on a oar or rock, finding firewood, making sure the fire was really out, etc.. Years ago there was a fire near us started by shore lunch'ers. Probably pretty common in a dry year.Much easier to fix a bigger meal in the cabin then take a nap for us old geezers!Pooch"
2898353,SinOrSwim,2014-06-15 05:03:00,1528,"I couldn't disagree more. Shore lunch is one of my favorite parts of the trip. Agree, it can be a lot of work. But, we don't cook over fire. We take the propane cookers. That said, the lodge in this thread doesn't allow cooking at the cabin. I can't imagine going to canada and not eating fish? You can't re-create that at home, that's for sure."
2898377,Golden Eagle,2014-06-15 05:45:00,2642,"Because they keep fishermen off the water during pike feeding hours. I'll be throwing hardware at pike from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., taking a bite of cold walleye when moving to a new point or bay."
2899873,Nimstug,2014-06-15 14:23:00,2605,"Easy to make on your own. Kosher dog steamed, mustard, relish, tomato, onion, dill pickle slice, lettuce, poopy seed bun and celery salt. Your local store should have the celery salt with the spices. If they don't let me know. Portillos is good and most neighborhood hot dog places are equal or better. Kosher dog is an absolute must."
2899897,tooski,2014-06-15 14:42:00,393,I'll pass.... poopy seed bun
2899969,Further North,2014-06-15 15:19:00,2008,"On shore lunch - for me, anyway - I need another pile/box/bag of crap kicking around the deck like I need a hole in the head.It's cool that others like it though. I think it's a great tradition."
2900569,Larry S,2014-06-15 18:38:00,665,"I Completely agree with pooch. We have fish 4 or 5 nights during our trip. We Refuse to mess around for an extra hour to and hour and a half a day, hauling gear in and out of the boat, making a fire and cooking on shore where the insects can have a field day munching on our bodies. We are much more comfortable having a cocktail and taking our time cooking a great meal indoors before we go out fishing at night If the lodge I was staying at didn't allow cooking in the cabin I would ask them to let us cook several walleye dinners in the Lodge kitchen or ask them to cook the walleye To Each His Own, but shore lunches for my group are a thing of the past!!"
2896497,Pooch,2014-06-14 07:56:00,4619,"Hey there Golden Eagle! Don't be trash talkin' them there hot dags! Every year we take a package of hot dogs for backup. The goal for the trip is to not have to eat the hot dogs. Couple of times after getting our azz handed to us by the lake they tasted pretty darned good. That is what humility tastes like with onions, ketchup and mustard.What's happening your way? Haven't heard you harassing skywagon lately. Loosing your touch or going soft with old age?PoochPooch"
2896681,btyreprich,2014-06-14 09:03:00,1067,We too take up a package or two of hot dogs for shore lunch. Kids especially enjoy them. But Pooch - ketchup on a hot dog??
2896697,Golden Eagle,2014-06-14 09:08:00,2642,"You hit it dead center. Old age takes it's toll. Got home last Sunday from spending 7 days fishing Little Vermilion Lake. Deep fried walleyes 6 nights and cold walleyes on the lake 7 days. Best pasta sauce I've ever eaten for Wednesday's dinner, prepared by Whopper, Huber Heights, Ohio. No way to be in touch with Skywagon with all the fishing opportunities he has available. Looking at a second week back at LV next month and a week of fishing LOTW with friends on the same ride. What's happening with you? I've never thought of taking a backup to walleye country."

2896921,Pooch,2014-06-14 10:30:00,4619,"Golden Eagle, are you fishing Little V in the provincial Park south of Sioux Lookout? If so, I thought that was not a walleye lake as we fish it one afternoon each year for smallies. I thought it was all Musky, Northern and Small Mouth. I think there are a couple little Vermillion's in Ontario.Don't trust Skywagon as he is always telling me how hard he is working, but I think he is actually out fishing. I'm thinking that his poor wife does all the fire wood cutting and splitting while he fishes or goes flying. Then she probably has to clean fish when he gets home while he cools down with a good wine.Pooch"
2897017,muskyroller,2014-06-14 11:34:00,56,"The thing we've figured out on the last day, so we can take fish home and not (legally) be over limits is brats/polish for shore lunch and spaghetti for dinner. It's funny too because that's when the COs check us and they never believe we didn't have fish for lunch ) Fishing and keeping legally AND eating good!"
2897377,Golden Eagle,2014-06-14 14:30:00,2642,"Right on! Proof that a good woman can support one man. I'm fishing Little Vermilion Lake, a short flight north of Red Lake, Ontario. About an 18 mile float plane ride. Tons of small to medium walleyes and lots of huge pike. Won't go back up until next month."
2898185,Nimstug,2014-06-14 21:48:00,2605,No Pooch! Never ketchup!! What are you doing? And celery salt... please tell me you at least put celery salt on the hot dogs..
2898329,Obabikon,2014-06-15 04:09:00,2370,"Not that this has anything to do with the topic, but... shore boxes are pretty expensive. Oil, baked beans, potatoes (and boiling them first), onion, fish breading, usually a can of fruit and bread. Plus the work preparing the box, and cleaning it afterwards. Some deli meat, cheese and bread in a paper sack is about a cheap as you can get."
2898337,Pooch,2014-06-15 04:14:00,4619,"No Pooch! Never ketchup!! What are you doing? And celery salt... please tell me you at least put celery salt on the hot dogs..I know that you guys in the northern part of the state take your hot dogs seriously, but I've never heard of celery salt on a hot dog. No tomatoes available? Then a little ketchup ain't gonna hurt. Stop at Portella's (SP?) when in the area and they have a pretty decent hot dog that has sliced tomatoes on it that I really could get addicted to! Just out of curiosity, why do the purest go nuts when ketchup is even mentioned in the same breath as a hot dog? Sometimes the meat is so suspect that it needs all the disguise you can put on it!Pooch"
2893849,Jatar,2014-06-13 08:21:00,169,"I have been there as well, beware, you will probably gain a few pounds from the food ! Fishing-No comment."
2894105,lassh,2014-06-13 09:36:00,553,"I do appreciate the candid critique of the camp. It may help those who are used to high level accommodations realize that this is an economical camp, not a high service level resort. It may also help some understand before going that they can go to a good fishing area for a very reasonable price. If you are on a tight budget, and you understand the conditions and expectations, I think you could have a very good trip at Black Bear Lodge. This is for those who go for the fishing not for comfort or accommodations. I too looked at the website. They do make it clear that it is an outpost experience with some amenities- hot showers, water in fish cleaning house, meals provided. Electricity at lodge. At the price you pay for a week, I think you should expect modest but filling meals. If the one hot dog limit for dinner situation is a common occurrence, thats less than I would expect. They should mention the dishwashing expectation on the website so people are not surprised. They should also post a summary of the points from their mandatory orientation session. As for the motors, a lodge owner has the responsibility to provide reliable motors, dry boats, and good gas. All motors occasionally have issues. I don't know what the situation was with the motor the Chicago guys ran in to. If Black Bear does have a fleet of unreliable motors and can't afford to maintain a reliable inventory with backups, perhaps they need to charge a little more for the capital to fund an upgrade program. Then again, maybe it was an anomaly. Bottom line is that it appears to me that Black Bear Lodge affords a shot at some good fishing at a low price with basic accommodations."
2894857,Nimstug,2014-06-13 13:27:00,2605,Do the hot dogs come with celery salt?
2894865,Mr. Sauger,2014-06-13 13:28:00,285,Unreliable motors -> unacceptable an any priceOnly 1 hot dog for an adult's dinner -> unaccepatble at any priceCrabby operator -> unacceptable at any priceThanks for the warning.
2895169,btyreprich,2014-06-13 15:15:00,1067,"Even reading the web site for BBL does a pretty fair job informing people of how they run their camp and what the ""rules"" are. I have stayed in a remote camp north of the Artic circle so I am no stranger to staying in a cabin with no running water or electric. (Not a fan of outhouses!!) If I were to go there, I'd bring my own shore lunch kit with canned corn & potatoes. To basically limit you to one shore lunch a week is crazy. Old unreliable motors on the main lake is just unacceptable. Our group would vote to pass on this lodge."
2895265,hawgwobbler,2014-06-13 15:49:00,3,"Long-time lurker and first-time poster. Strange, my group stayed at BBL in June 2011. I don't recall seeing any of the ancient motors from the 70's on any of the boats when we were there. I also found the meals at breakfast and dinner to be satisfying and filling. This camp, as mentioned in prior posts, is a rustic camp with the intention of retaining the feel of camps of the past. The cost is a reflection of the fact that there are limitations to what is provided in the way of amenities. The KP duty was a bit of a turn off at first but for us it was one night out of the week and it cost us 30 minutes max from getting back on the water but did allow for conversation with other guests and the owners, who as a couple, run the camp by themselves. Realistically, the cost of 620.00 combined with the scenery and fishing potential make this lodge an attractive option for many who cannot afford the more upscale camps. We're going back in three weeks, and look forward to the opportunity to unwind, catch fish and enjoy another week in Canada.Note- It is my understanding the catch and release policy on lake trout is not exclusive to BBL but one that was adopted by all camps on Red Lake due to the lack of natural reproduction in the system."
2895281,BreezyPoint,2014-06-13 16:32:00,1581,"This is a regulation of the Ministry of Natural Resources, published in their rules. Anyone going to any lake should check those regs before making a decision!Frank"
2895345,hawgwobbler,2014-06-13 17:18:00,3,"Breezy Point, Thanks for the clarification concerning the lake trout regs on Red Lake. I knew from my visits to BBL and Bow Narrows Camp that it was strictly C&R for trout. Still have the Bow Narrows Camp lake map which states as much."
2895457,v-bay gord,2014-06-13 18:05:00,3168,"As an owner I would say HeHooksHimself is the type of guest you really appreciate and in the end will bend over backwards to satisfy. Why? Because his expectations mesh with what you are offering. Now, not bashing the Chicago boys, but they had expectations beyond what the camp had to offer."
2895913,Golden Eagle,2014-06-13 21:31:00,2642,"Only one hotdog, but what else was included? I wouldn't have needed a hotdog if the rest of the meal was sufficient. No hotdogs for me when walleyes are offering themselves for my cooker. For me, two hotdogs would be worse than one hotdog for a NW Ontario dinner."

2893433,Jatar,2014-06-13 06:28:00,169,"The bottom line is you get what you pay for. Our group went once, It is by far the least expensive trip that I have ever been on. I didn't drive 900 miles to do dishes either, but I dealt with it, and yes the owner can be a bit surly, but I wasn't there to make friends. Suffel was like shooting fish in a barrel, don't know about the other lakes. Spawning conditions vary from lake to lake that time of the year, so unless he is fishing everyday (which I doubt ) you would have been better served hiring a guide for a day, or check with local bait shop. We would not go back to BBL for basically the same reasons as you."
2893457,BornToFish,2014-06-13 06:37:00,1224,"It's frustrating when you spend your time and money on a vacation only to have it not deliver to your expectations. This comment is not restricted to a vacation fishing in Ontario, but to any vacation anywhere and anytime. It comes down to doing your homework and investigating prospective lodges before making a reservation. There are many great fishing lodges in NW Ontario. Unfortunately, there are some lodges that may not necessarily be described as being great. It sounds as though you may have found one that doesn't measure up. Fishing lodges are often viewed as being in the service industry. Guests vote with their feet when they are not receiving the level of service they expect or are paying for. I believe that individual lodges acquire the temperament of the lodge's owners. Lodges with poor ownership acquire a bad atmosphere. This atmosphere can be greatly compounded when guests show up with unrealistic expectations or their own bad attitudes. Don't give up on fishing in NW Ontario if you like fishing there. You may need to be more diligent in researching your future fishing lodges. Start by talking to people you trust with regards to their experiences at their fishing lodges. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2893561,stevensinks,2014-06-13 07:17:00,330,"I think if you go on up the lake about 4 miles you would find a camp you would like. Its a little more $$ but you will have new motors, good food, no dishes. My wife and I have been going there for the past 6 years and we sure enjoy it."
2893633,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-13 07:21:00,725,"Jim and I have been communicating for a few years and on my recommendation he went to our favorite place, Wine Lake Camp. Now, we are very familiar with the lakes included in Wine Lake Camp and spring fishing is outstanding, but Jim was not happy that the camp owners didn't put him on fish. IMO, part of fishing is exploring and recognizing good spots from experience, but the Chicago boys were not happy that Herb (camp owner) would not get too specific. Herb, like most lodge owners, is usually busy around camp and doesn't get to fish much, but of course he knows spots. Jim was also upset with having to portage the boat, which he knew was part of the experience. I think the bottom line is that you should make your expectations clear to the lodge owner and expect to pay premium prices for premium service. If you want to be put directly on fish, you should hire a guide. I appreciate owners like BBL who strive to offer cut rate experience for budget style service and who make it clear what you get for you money. Heck, even I knew just by reading reports on Walleye Central about BBL that you had to commit to KP for the food. I guess I am just surprised that Jim Wolf and the Chicago boys were surprised with their experience. I thought his main focus catching 50-100 walleye a day, which he apparently accomplished at BBL. We are looking forward to trying BBL because we prefer an experience that is a little more rustic. I would not eliminate BBL as an option based solely on this report. Just my 2 cents.... Hooks"
2893673,SinOrSwim,2014-06-13 07:31:00,1528,"I'm confused. Are meals included and they served you hot dogs? And, only one dog? Seems odd meals would be included in the price and then they make you do dishes? I'll have to take a look at the website too."
2893729,wallydave,2014-06-13 07:40:00,2151,"I had a good trip the BBL last year, helping with the meals, Mike Kansas and I helped with a breakfast and cleaned up after, about 30 min. total. After meals in the lodge, everybody lined up and did there own dishes, 5-10 min. tops. Jim and Jillian run a tight ship, they stay pretty busy with the lodge, the fishermen and they have two kids in camp too.Our meals were fine, good home cooking, we always had plenty to eat too.Each day we tried different spots, each day the fishing got better. This year a return trip with a group of four.I'm sorry Jim and the boys didn't have a good experiance, but my experiance was different and I'm seven weeks out from my return trip! not that I am doing a countdown! OOPPs wrong thread for that!"
2893785,Guest,2014-06-13 07:57:00,0,thanks for your input guys I appreciate your comments have not given up on Canada cedar point resort 1st week of September $575/week including evening meal hopefully better experience no guides availiable at black bear only 1 hot dog for supper just trying to warn other fishermen what they may be getting into jim wolf Chicago boys will issue report
2893801,BornToFish,2014-06-13 08:06:00,1224,"You might just have to write off your previous experience as a lesson learned, and not to be repeated. I'm glad to hear that you haven't given up on fishing in Canada. I am confident that you will enjoy your experience on Cedar Lake. You will encounter great fishing, but be advised it will be very different than fishing in the springtime. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2893817,SinOrSwim,2014-06-13 08:07:00,1528,"I looked at the website and they do a very good job of warning you this is a very rustic camp. With all the mentions of outhouses etc. I didn't see anywhere you are responsible for doing dishes. When I read meals included I would assume they cook, you eat and they clean. I would also expect newer or at the very least, reliable motors. That said, I'm not sure how meals would be money makers? At $620 per week that is $88/day including food, lodging, boat and gas???? It also seems like the owners are very strict. A 2 hour window for arrival??? ONE shore lunch and then a charge? Seems like the potatoes etc would be cheaper than the sack lunch stuff. I would have been skeptical for the price about the meals though. Plus, they lost me at no running water or toilets. Sorry to hear about your week."
