2903201,Mike Kansas,2014-06-16 12:18:00,1463,Stayed at BBL last year in August for the first time. There is no doubt that it is a rustic camp and does not have all the amenities you get at another Amercian Plan Camp. But least we forget the price that BBL charges is $620 and when you compare that to other camps that have Amercian Plan at more than twice as much BBL is a good deal. Boats are a little rough and so are motors but ours functioned well and did the job for us. This camp actually reminded me a lot of some of the camps my Dad took me to in the late 50's. BBL is not a camp for those who want to be pampered but it is a great value for those who want to experince Canada and have a limited budget or just like that type of camp. I commened the owners of BBL for putting together a very affordable option for their clients and making a piece of Canada avaliable to those who like what BBL does. Mike Kansas

First time on Red Lake and a new camp to fish out of after many trips to the NW end of Lac Seul. The meals we had were good home style cooking, and plenty of it! Like Mike mentioned, it is a rustic camp, I have had worse boats and motors to fish out of on a fly-in that cost more than twice as much!The fishing got better everyday, we found new spots to try.I have a group of 4, maybe 5 if Mike can make it happen going back in August!Rustic may not be for everyone, there are other camps that can provide the extra services, for me a new lake and camp experiance is just what the doctor ordered!"
