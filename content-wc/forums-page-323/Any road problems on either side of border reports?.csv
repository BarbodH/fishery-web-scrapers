2901657,itsme,2014-06-16 06:17:00,31,Hi Pooch On 6-12 a washout was shown on Rt 11 East of Emo and West of Fort Francis. Since you are headed to Rt 105 suggest you go East to 502 then North to 17 and 105.
2901857,Hump,2014-06-16 07:18:00,578,I understood that HWY 11 has been fixed? That was taken from an earlier post.
2901945,LOW1,2014-06-16 07:38:00,2828,"Three weeks ago: Some construction just south of Cook MN on Highway 53 - was not a big deal for us. A short construction delay in the Twin Cities at I94 - perhaps added five or ten minutes. There was a detour on Highway 63 south of Rochester MN - perhaps adds another five or ten minutes. Thankfully, the seemingly never-ending construction on I35 between the Twin Cities and Cloquet seemed to be in remission."
2902601,KM1,2014-06-16 10:02:00,374,We are going up soon as well and were wondering the same thing. Thought that washout on 11 was fixed also...wondering if they had another one with the rain this weekend??? Pooch...when are you guys leaving? Aren't you coming from the Midwest area? Where are you fishing .... LOTW...Red Lake...Laq Suel...??? Me...will be fishing LOTW...simply love that lake.

2902921,v-bay gord,2014-06-16 11:05:00,3168,My road washed out this morning. We are now a fly-in camp. Does this mean I get to raise my rates? Hoping to have a road back together this afternoon. Eagle Lake water levels have gone up what looks like 6 inches in the past 48 hours.
