Fished mostly shallow areas but heard of fish being caught in 20-22 feet of water. I would expect fish to be in the sanctuary when it opens up this week. Weather was so so and was cold most of the week which was nice as the skeeters are thick. Roads going up were in good condition. Lots of rain and water everywhere. Did get 40"" and 37"" northern off the dock. Big shout out to Machelle and Keith at Goldenhook Camp for again providing all their guests with a great week. Safe travels to those going north."

In 5 days fishing we got 275 walleye, 25pike and 15 perch. Most fish caught off point or weeds in 8 feet or less. Big walleye was 24 and biggest pike 35.5. We fished it hard the first full day and got 85 fish. The rest of the week we relaxed more and boated around 45 to 50. I thought the weather was perfect. I prefer 60's and cloudy when sitting in a boat all day. Highlight of the trip was deciding to anchor and throw out slip bobbers at our honey hole. Nonstop easy fishing fun. No other boat was within eye site. First time at the lake. Already planning on going back!!"
