2898841,dosxx,2014-06-15 08:30:00,60,"I just got back from Happy Day Lodge from a week long trip with my father in law and two friends. We got plenty of walleyes to eat, but to be honest we were having so much fun in our boat with the smallies that walleye took second fiddle and I did not work at looking for them. My buddies targeted them a few times and did well. I also saw everyone else cleaning nice eater walleyes, so I would say the fishing was good. Another problem with walleyes for me was I have been there twice in the fall, and all of my fall ""hotspots"" on the GPS were not producing for June.We managed an accidental white fish on a jig and grub, a 31 inch pike on a Senko work, and the biggest walleye was a 21 inch that was photographed and releasedWeather was fantastic but the mosquitoes were horrendous. We watched a wild fire get put out first by a Railway car with 5 gallon buckets, and then we had the Fire Helicopter hover over us for a long time, touch down, circle, etc. Very cool for a while, then it just got plain noisy. I think one of the best parts of the week was watching my one armed father in law be able to fish with the reel I got him for Christmas which allows him to cast and reel with one hand (battery operated). In the past he was pretty much stuck jigging with one hand, transferring the rod to his prosthesis, and reeling with his good hand-- he could not feel the fish fighting with his prosthetic. He would often lose the fish on the transfer. This time he could cast, set it, and reel. Pretty cool deal.We stayed at the main camp and the lodgings were fine. The Zimmermans run a nice place."
1973642,MrSimon,2013-07-23 06:29:00,922,"That's a great mapping site ... I will use that for sure! The narrows are the ones in the first link you posted .... the ones that lead to the Northern section of the lake. The bass are definitely all over the lake, but it did seem that they were more congregated in the northern part of the lake. I think the big schools move up there for the deeper, cooler water. But like Frankie said, they can be caught close to camp too."
1973690,troutwater,2013-07-23 07:02:00,299,"Where exactly is Lake Windermere? I know some lodges on Eagle send people over there to fish, but I've never known where it is. I hear it has some good sized muskie in there too."
1974074,10lbeye,2013-07-23 07:57:00,61,"Thanks--much appreciated. one final question: is a guide available for a day, for example??"
1974330,MrSimon,2013-07-23 08:55:00,922,"There are no full-time professional guides, but the lodge owner, Bob, or one of his sons will often take guests out .... depending on availability and scheduling. Just mention it when you arrive and they will try and help you out. troutwater - Windermere is just West of Chapleau, Ontario. No musky."
1974986,adempsey,2013-07-23 11:20:00,963,"That site is just for sharing PDF files. I put the maps up there. They are original MNR maps that I cleaned up and colored. PM me your email address and I can send you the B&W and color versions that are slightly better resolution if you like.Quote: Originally Posted by MrSimonThe narrows are the ones in the first link you posted .... the ones that lead to the Northern section of the lake.The bass are definitely all over the lake, but it did seem that they were more congregated in the northern part of the lake.

I am guessing it's about 3.5 miles to the narrows from camp? The area south of the camp and south of those islands looks like it might be good too. Of course, personal experience dictates that I am usually wrong, lol."
1975146,MrSimon,2013-07-23 11:55:00,922,"I think you are about right on the distance to the narrows. It took us less than 10 minutes to make the run at about 26 mph ... so that's somewhere in the 3.5 mile range. The area south of the lodge is interesting and has a different feel than the rest of the lake. Its real tight getting into that southern arm, but it does open up and there is some good water down there. And some really really deep water in one spot. A lot of the stuff down there is shallow and muddy (probably great in Spring), but there are some rocky areas too. Its worth a try just to see some different water, and its a great place to get out of the wind if its howling bad."
2374529,adempsey,2014-01-22 16:02:00,963,"Not to bring up an old thread, but I figured I should report back on my trip from last August 2013.Overall, it's a nice lake and place to be. Definitely have that secluded feeling even though you are at a drive-in camp. Didn't run into too many other boats, but some on occasion. No big deal there.Fishing was alright. We primarily looked for Walleye and managed to locate some decent spots. Most of the fish we (four of us) caught were eater sized (if I recall correctly). We caught them off of points and drop offs, but many in the weed beds. Some pike and smallmouth bass as well. Spent one day searching for Lakers, but no luck.The only thing about this place is the sheer size of the lake. It's huge and the camp is on the very east end of it! So, our boat was nice, but just too slow to really bother traveling very far. Next time, I think I would get the most deluxe boat they have so I can hit the areas that seem to be more productive for other guests at the camp. Also, to simply cover far more ground in search of those fish!Anyway, I would go back. Probably would stay at the outpost camp if possible. It's a great value."
2374633,dosxx,2014-01-22 16:42:00,60,"I also went to Happy Day with a group of four in mid September 2013. We missed the good weather by a week! It was cold (fire most every night), windy, and rainy, but hey it is Canada and we had a great time. We stayed at the outpost for a week. The fishing was good, but not great but we did not want for walleye dinners. I truly attribute the somewhat awful weather to the slower fishing. The fish were definitely in there. The ""bigger ones"" seemed to be isolated, but we got into pockets of smaller fish and caught several in a few spots. I caught one very nice pike in a most unexpected spot not too far from camp after making a gas run.The cabin was nice and the shower was a great feature at an outpost. The gas grill was out of commission, but we used the grate over the fire pit for some fantastic steaks and ribs.Our only issue was that the camp boat was really slow for such a huge body of water. We brought my 14 foot with a 30 horse and it was fine, but the 20 horse on the upgraded camp boat (it is a nicely appointed boat with bow mount motor, live well, etc.) was super slow. The trip to and from the outpost, loaded down, was long and we got a bit turned around going in. I think as the crow flies on GPS it is 10 miles and loaded down it was a couple of hours one way.One thing I would say is if you are at the outpost and you like to really move around, bring as much extra gas as you can or maybe make arrangements to have gas delivered prior to arrival. We miscalculated and ended up making two extra trips to the main camp, burning about about six gallons on each round trip. I think we burned at least a six gallon tank a day on the four stroke and my two stroke.We are looking forward to returning in 2015 (headed to another place this year). The owners are great and take good care of their clients."
2377353,MrSimon,2014-01-23 12:58:00,922,"I'm glad you guys enjoyed your trips!Good points about the boats and gas. Both times I went up there I rented the premium boats with the 50HP motors. We could make the outpost run in about 40-50 minutes empty and about an hour with all the gear. Like you mentioned, we had the lodge deliver us a bunch of gas on Wednesday.I also agree that the best spots seem to be out past the narrows (especially in the summer and fall) .... which can be quite the haul from the main lodge in a slow boat.The main lodge is pretty nice .... but the outpost is the real gem!Did either of you guys make into any of the bush lakes?EDIT: One more thing .... most camp boats are running props that are pretty beat up. So like was mentioned, you can typically expect less than normal performance out of rental boats - which is a pain on a big lake. Which is why I like this lodge so much - I can easily trailer my own boat in."
2379545,dosxx,2014-01-24 04:00:00,60,"We walked the trail to Kathleen just to check it out, and we fished in the area where the trail to Goldie is, but we decided to wait for our next trip to try out both lakes. I know the group right before us said they had a ball and caught lots of fish in Kathleen."
1969185,MrSimon,2013-07-21 17:31:00,922,"We fished Lake Windermere out of Happy Day Lodge for 5 days. It was me, my 85 year old grandfather and three other guys who have little to no fishing experience at all. Needless to say we didn't catch a lot of fish, but we sure had a lot of fun .... and I now have three new buddies who are pumped to go back to Canada. Here are some of my thoughts about the whole experience: Nice camp, nice people, good fishing. If your cabin or camp site is close to the generator, its annoying. We were 20 paces away ... I'll never do that again. Renting their ATVs for a few hours was a TON of fun. Lake Windermere is all about structure. Forget about weeds ... look for boulders, rocks, slopes, humps and points. There is so much structure in this lake its ridiculous. I had my new Humminbird with side imaging and I couldn't believe how amazing the structure is in this lake. And there are walleye EVERYWHERE! Anywhere you find the structure, you find walleye. Anywhere there isn't structure, there are no fish. There is a lot of dead water, so you better bring good electronics and know how to use them. With so much amazing structure, its hard to key in on what specific type the bigger fish are holding to. So you just start checking it all until you figure it out. Its like a puzzle, and its a blast to solve. I started in 8-12 feet of water and found almost limitless numbers of 6-12"" walleye. 14-20 feet of water had less fish, but they were a little bigger, but not huge. So I went deeper still and found nothing. So the pattern was to fish in 14-16 feet of water and look for the spot on the spot. It worked pretty well. But my biggest fish, 27"", came in 12 feet of water just outside of some boulders that only held smaller fish .... at 11:30 in the morning. That fish shouldn't have been there, but it was. Moral of the story is to just keep moving and be prepared for anything. Overall Windermere is a nice lake with a very healthy population of small to medium sized walleye ... with some bigger ones thrown in. It can be hard to fish, but its rewarding to figure it out. I'll go back."
1969601,Jaskonie,2013-07-21 20:23:00,80,"Spot on, thanks for the report."
1969625,adempsey,2013-07-21 20:47:00,963,"Thanks for the report. Heading up this Friday, hopefully we can get into some fish. These lakes often have many potentially good spots and can be hard to locate those Walleye. I am hoping to have some fun with the Smallmouth and Lakers too!"
1969865,2746,2013-07-22 05:42:00,3206,Good for him! I'm hoping I'm still willing and able to get mt butt up and going for Canada trips when I'm that age. And a grandson willing to take me. You did good.
1970025,MrSimon,2013-07-22 07:09:00,922,"Smallmouth seemed to be in the boulders. The best places where where the water was 2-10 feet deep with big huge boulders - some coming all the way out of the water. Pull your prop up and start casting! One guy in camp had decent luck with lakers by using down riggers to troll spoons just below the thermocline (I think he said 40' ish) in deep water, like 60+ feet. If you believe him, he caught a 48"" laker that got off at the boat, and a 46"" pike that also got off. He did bring a few 20"" lakers back to the cleaning hut, so I know he at least caught those. He would just troll around and around for hours on end. I would lose my mind doing that. We also found that the fishing was significantly better north of the narrows (deeper water and more rocky structure). I'm sure the close end of the lake is great in spring, but this time of year I'm not even sure its worth fishing. Just about everyone in camp was running past the narrows every time they went out. Only one or two boats every fished close to camp. Although, one evening we decided to just hit a shallow bay not 30 seconds from camp on our way in .... and I caught a nice pike and a decent walleye. Sometimes you have to forget all the ""wisdom"" and just fish."
1970105,10lbeye,2013-07-22 07:33:00,61,"Thanks Mr Simon for the report. I'm considering a trip there for next year at this time. Looking for a drive in camp that offers a good chance for decent numbers of walleye (say 15-22 inches) after years of fishing certain Canadian waters that have held more quality fish but much less quantity. In your opinion does Windermere fit this bill? Did you bring your boat or rent one there? The boats they advertise look very nice and some include electronics, so is there still a need to bring portable fishfinders??? I've heard nothing but good things about the Lodge and the folks who run it so your report is reassuring. Thanks again for posting. Cheers."
1970161,adempsey,2013-07-22 07:53:00,963,"Awesome info, thanks! You probably just save me a couple days of bad fishing. I've been pouring over my maps trying to get an idea of where to go. Big lakes like this often mean a lot of unproductive fishing for me. I think it's the seasonal migrations that get me most of the time. I seem to always fish where the fish used to be not where they are .I assume the narrows is to the west of the camp where the lake begins to open up to the north shown in this map section?http://www.scribd.com/doc/155352527/...-Map-Section03Or, do you mean south of the camp below the islands as in this map??http://www.scribd.com/doc/155352999/...-Map-Section04Also, I don't plan on trolling for hours and hours for Lakers. That would drive me crazy too! Just nice to have options midday when the Walleye aren't cooperating."
1971313,Mike Borger,2013-07-22 13:23:00,1554,"Nice report, Windermere sounds like a nice lake!Good luck on your trip Adam."
1971361,Frankie65,2013-07-22 13:31:00,9,"You pretty much nailed it MR Simon. I wasn't sure if that was you over there so never we never did say hello. Juli and I were in Cabin 3.That 27""er is a beauty! We, for the most part, actually fished the areas within 15 minutes of camp in my 14 fter with a 15 hp. Like you said, lots of small to medium sized walleye, but we also hit some really nice smallies.Stucture is key, and, rocks and points, along with beaver dams, are our go to spots.Glad you had a good time!"
1973626,MrSimon,2013-07-23 06:25:00,922,"I think it is possible to get lots of 15-22"" fish, but it is more likely to get lots of 12-16"" fish. It depends greatly on time of year, weather, and where you fish. If you can get those three variables to line up, then yes, you can catch lots of 15-22"" fish. I took my boat and we also rented one of their Premium boats. It was a nice 16' Tracker with a 50HP Mercury and a Power Drive trolling motor. It was clean, comfortable, ran well, and had a nice little Huminbird 700 series graph that worked fine. The smaller rental boats did not have trolling motors or fish finders."
