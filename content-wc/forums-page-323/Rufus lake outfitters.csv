511432,Guest,2001-03-14 10:02:00,0,"Joe, I live in southern Ontario and about 10 years ago we went up to Kap and fished Rufus Lake. Unless things have changed I would not recomend it. Plenty of Pike but not very many Walleye, the few we did catch were on the small side. No one else that week did much better either. I'm not sure if this is a different Outfitter or not but the place we stayed at was not that far off the main highway. No neeed for a 4x4 and on the weekend the locals from Kap would drive to the lake and camp there, you could hear them all night. This place is not as remote as it sounds, and, in my opinion was deffinately not worth the effort and time it took to get there. The owner at the time as I remember was nice enough, but if you are looking for quality fishing and a wilderness experience I would say this is not the place to go to."

We saw lots of wildlife and took the canoe and portaged into Little Rice Lake. The entrance to the lake is blocked by a four tier beaver dam unlike anything I have ever seen. I experienced great fishing on all my trips to the system. If you camp, take a dining shelter, the mosquitos are merciless in the early to late evening, but disappear in the day. I am making plans to return next year, and have no doubt I will enjoy my trip. Just wanted to provide another opinion. Thanks"

The camp is about 40 km from the highway, so you are isolated. The fishing on the chain of lakes(6 different lakes) is nothing short of fantastic... I'm hard pressed to think of a time when we haven't all caught our limit. I would highly recommend this area, especially in June."

The lodge is 60 km south of highway 11. I have been renting a spot from Rick since 2001 and have nothing but good to say for him and his camp. Fishing is excellent, especially walleye."

The fishing was amazing! Rick and Viv are great hosts and their place is very clean and well cared for. I think for those who hasn't had much luck fishing, I would suggest you maybe try some new technique as there are plenty enough fish for all to go home happy, satisfied and successful. Happy fishing everyone!"

Over the years we have gone thru several owners. Since Rick took over the camp, however, all cabins have been updated by converting the cabins which used to handle 2 groups under one roof to large single units. Rick has built a beautiful new shower facility with hot and cold running water, and a solar electric system for the entire camp. Fish cleaning house is maintained and cleaned daily-there are signs with fishermen writing the date and big fish they caught on the fish cleaning walls. My family and group have posted many memorable fish taken during our stays. Rick will bend over backwards to helping his guests to have a satisfying vacation. I especially like the fact Rick gases up the boats for each boat whether a rental boat or your own. Usually I tow my boat from Akron, Ohio (900+miles) just to have a windshield and top. Rick has helped me many times when my motor was acting up, if I had a trailer problem, and would bring back any item from town that I forgot to pack or needed Rick's boats do have newer 15 HP motors and 16' aluminum fishing boats. Upon occasion we have used a camp boat with zero problems. As far as fishing, for a drive-in camp, we found the fishing to be excellant. We eat walleye every day, and many times, twice, in order to not exceed our limits. There are few days, we could not limit out. Rufus Lake is a chain of lakes with rivers in-between-you must be careful to avoid hitting the rocks when going to more remote lakes-usually takes 30 minutes from camp to go to the furthest lake in the chain. (Usnac Lake) I would recommend this camp."
