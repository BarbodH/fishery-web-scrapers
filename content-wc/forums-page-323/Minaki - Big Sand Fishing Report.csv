Will be going after Walleyes, Smallies, and a Musky or two. We will be focusing primarily on walleyes though. We typically jig um with leeches and have done well but would like to know what others do for presentation and what is their bait of choice. Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

Walleyes are going on leeches exactly how you have caught them in the past. Water temps climbing rapidly until the last few days. Major cold front with lots of rain. Water is very high as well.
