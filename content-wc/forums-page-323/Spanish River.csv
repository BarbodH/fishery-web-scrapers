2902593,Fish_Heads,2014-06-16 10:01:00,154,"A group of about 6 or 7 of us went there about 25 years ago. We stayed where they had 2 cabins basically at the upper end of a lake (really just a wide spot on the river several miles long between non navigable rapids).Got there by train which stopped along a overpass over a creek where the lodge had 2 boats stored under the bridge which you took up that creek to the camp.Never caught much on the ""lake"" section, but there was a portage trail going upriver that went behind the cabins & through the woods & they had 2 more boats stashed above the rapids that we used to go up river & fish. There's a spot where a sizeable stream ""T"" s into the river & we caught walleye there by the hundreds till we ran out of bait. It had the edges of a huge weedbed & we jigged & cast along the moving water at the edge of the weeds.Some of our guys jumped in to cool off & were swimming off the front of the boat & I was still catching walleyes at the back !They were all 18"" or smaller ""eater size"" & never found them anywhere any bigger.All in all a good trip, but the guys didn't want to go back since we never got any with good size to them. We didn't find the fishing spot above the rapids till about 2 days before we had to leave, & so never got to really explore the rest of the river up there.Fish"
2902945,tooski,2014-06-16 11:08:00,393,I've stayed there. Fishing is so-so. Usually canoers coming through. Train pick-up along the tracks is always late. One year we waited almost 10 hours along the tracks to get picked up.
