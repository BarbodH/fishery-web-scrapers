2741162,Bakefish,2014-04-30 08:57:00,1077,"Make your own audio. Here's my story, it's a bit long so bear with me.Many years ago I and 8 friends were on a houseboat trip to Rainy Lake. One of the guys was a rookie and was very concerned about bears. Fishing that week was the worst I've ever seen. We were battered by rain, thunderstorms and even hail almost every night. One afternoon my boat consisting of three of us decided it was time to go to the houseboat and have a few cocktails, since the fish were nonexistent. After several drinks we came up with the idea that we were going to put a scare into our neophyte. We had a tape recorder with us, so we took to the woods to make a tape that would later be known as ""Bear Scare"".We turned on the recorder and began walking through the woods stomping, breaking branches and occasionally inserting bear ""woof"" sounds. As we were involved in our prank-to-be a dog came running through the woods at us, scaring us to high heaven. Well he proved to be quite friendly, part lab and part Mississippi leg hound. That boy was lonely. We eventually recorded him jumping into the water and swimming for a bit.That evening we informed all but one of our cast of characters of our plan.We placed the tape recorder in the woods right outside the houseboat and told the victim that the head in the houseboat was broken and any business was to be conducted outside. While playing cards I suddenly ""had the urge"" and excused myself from the table. As planned, after a few minutes one of the other members walked outside to relieve himself and said, ""Are you ready?"" I affirmed and he said in a loud voice, ""Bakefish, I heard something out there you'd better get in here."" At that point everyone broke up the card game and went to the front deck of the houseboat. I turned on the tape recorder, which had about a one minute delay at the beginning of the tape that would give everyone a chance to get assembled. I came out of the woods buckling up my pants and grumbling that nothing was private anymore. After I got back onto the boat the first branch broke on the recording. It was very still that night and the woods were very silent, so that broken branch sounded like a gunshot. The tape progressed with the rustling bushes, breaking branches and bear woofs. My dad suddenly said, turn off the lights so he can't see us. I almost wet my pants at that one, but the victim bought into it. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder and I could feel his heart trying to explode out of his chest. Suddenly the tape got to the part where the dog jumped into the water and started swimming. I yelled, ""He's coming for the houseboat, head for the small boats."" The victim, we'll call him Dave (because that's his name) turned and ran at full gallop to the back of the boat. The rest of the crew was scattered about laughing like never before. I ran behind Dave to the back of the boat, but by then he was up the ladder and on top of the houseboat, when from the dark Canadian forest came the chant....""Helllllllooooooo Dave, .... You"". The confused look on his face was priceless. He drank heavily that night."

Wait an hour, do it again. Make it appear there's the meanest gremlin in the world inside that thing, then make it appear he's disappeared. GAWD...I could milk that for a week. When they start *****ing, suggest maybe a reprogram. Be the best, most helpfulest buddy. Sure to turn suspicion away. That'll fix it until you can reprogram yours. Stop him before he rips it off and throws it overboard. Otherwise, never tell."
2743553,MorganMan,2014-04-30 18:52:00,341,Great story!!! We will definitely have to work on something.

2762225,Karloutdoors,2014-05-05 22:03:00,828,That sounds great but all of the recordings ive found sound really fake. If you have an authentic audio file would you mind e-mailing it to me?

2670297,The Donger,2014-04-12 14:28:00,48,"The old frozen hat trick. Wait until one of the guys falls asleep at night. Grab his hat, soak it good and stick it in the freezer. ""Pretend"" to find it for him in the morning by grabbing some ice cubes from the freezer. He will have choice words to say going out to fish in the morning with a rock hard hat."
2671977,Baitslinger,2014-04-12 22:51:00,93,"Back in the 1980's, there was an odd contraption called the ""Skeeter Skat"", a small electronic box about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It emitted an ultra high pitched sound that was pretty close to sounding like a mosquito itself. I have an Uncle who hates bugs more than anything, and we all shared a cabin with bedroom walls about 8 feet high. The rest of the area up to the roof was open. My teenage brothers and I would take the skeeter skat and tie it to a fishing rod, and as soon as the lights went out, we'd turn it on and lower it over the wall directly above his head. We could hear him flailing around at it for a few minutes as we'd swing it over his bed. By the third night, he took 4 bug coils into his bedroom, and was trying to figure a way to use a spare sheet rigged up as a tent over his bed. We never told him about it, as practical joke retribution would have been swift and severe!On one other trip, he caught a large pike- his biggest ever. He brought it back to camp, and tied his old chain & clip stringer to the dock just before a big T-storm arrived and chased everyone inside. My brothers and I snuck out, took the fish off the stringer, broke off the clip it was attached too, and then tied the fish to the other dock out of site, leaving the clip in its jaw. He came out, saw his empty stringer, and was almost in tears assuming his trophy fish gotten loose when the clip opened up. Later that day my youngest brother came back into camp with the fish in his boat, proudly showing off his giant northern he said he'd just caught a hundred yards from camp. when my Uncle came down to the dock, we suddenly ""discovered"" the clip still in its lower jaw. A few of us got shoved in the lake over that one!"
2674905,Glenman12,2014-04-13 19:58:00,762,"Im not a big prankster but my partners son and son in law are...and unfortunately we are always the target..Im sure most lodges use something like a gallon bleach bottle cut off at the bottom for a boat bailer..well we also use it as a pisser...one day several years ago Im using it and I look down and its dripping on my pants...what they did was take the cap and loosen it enough to stay on but also enough so it would leak...ha ha... next year we wised up..every time we would grab the bailer we would make sure the cap was on tight...so on a very hot day Im wearing shorts T shirt and sandals...grab the bailer and all of a sudden my toes are getting wet...they had taken a knife and punched a hole in the cap...ha ha.. their best one, that we even had to laugh at...loosen the transducer cable from the depthfinder just enough so it will work but then disconnect after hitting some rough water...."
2691026,SinOrSwim,2014-04-17 15:09:00,1528,If you are in a smaller boat and are in the front of the boat while back trolling wait until the driver isn't paying attention and yank his line HARD!!!! That'll wake em up!! Gets em every single time. Even when it's me driving
2720601,Powerstroke Diesel,2014-04-24 21:03:00,45,Put some holes in the bottom of the pee cantainer! Put enough holes in such that there is more coming out the bottom than going in the top.
2728761,GWC,2014-04-27 09:40:00,1021,"Wait until your fishing partner is half asleep or not paying attention, Yank his line really hard.The spider trick. Take a piece of mono, tack it to the top of a door frame, tie a piece of black or brown fuzz form a sock on the end. When done right, the fuzz should hit the person in the face when the door opens. Pinch or cut the barbs on his favorite lure (have replacements hooks on hand).Reset the drag on his reel to a really low setting so that it doesn't work.Wait until he's in the shower & turn off the hot water."
2738842,Karloutdoors,2014-04-29 16:48:00,828,"Staying at a camp near kenora where the resort owner had the sense of humor. Various topics of discussion with the owner upon our arrival included the local bear population. When he noted bears had in fact been recently seen in camp much more so than usual. After a long day on the water we return to find the front door of our cabin shredded with pieces strewn about the front of the cabin including trash from in our kitchen and some of our personal items from within the cabin. We spot this from a distance while walking to the cabin from the dock. Now were are on high alert. circling the cabin from a distance peering through every window possible to assure the bear is still not inside. Prior to entering we opted to run up the the owners unit figuring a rifle would be good to have on hand before entering the building. No one home at the owner's place. we stop by another cabin to ask if anyone had seen or heard the bear tear up our cabin. First guests queried saw/heard nothing. Nor did they seem too concerned. Nor did they know where the owner went. Off to the next cabin. Same story. Saw and heard nothing and even more indifference regarding the bear that shredded our front door. Nor have they seen the owner. Back to our cabin to further survey the scene. Finally a clue. The cabin door had hooks on the back where we had hung a few coats and sweatshirts. The door that was shredded.........had a broken window and a curtain..........WAIT A GOD **** MINUTE!!!!!! WE'VE BEEN DUPPED!!!!!! That's when yonder bush broke out in belly aching laughter. The resort owner steps out with video camera in hand and is peeing his pants laughing so hard. A SET UP!!! A COMPLETE SET UP. The other cabin guests......YES THEM TOO THOSE SONS OF B'S!!!!!!! A well played prank. The owner has one such ""Bear door"" that fit each cabin. Well played Louis. Well played."
2738978,forgop,2014-04-29 17:16:00,880,^that's some funny stuff right there. May keep that in mind in future years when we have a larger group. Me thinks I'll need to get some good bear audio to play from inside the cabin while I watch from the bushes. Sent from my SAMSUNG-SM-N900A using Tapatalk
2739322,1shooter,2014-04-29 18:30:00,1493,I plan on doing this on our June trip this year. Our group consists of 6 and we fish 2 to a boat. We all have bow mount trolling motors with Ipilots. We'll guess who just happens to have 2 remotes.....I plan to program the 2nd one to one of the other boats. Not sure what I'll do yet but it will be good.
2739466,MorganMan,2014-04-29 18:51:00,341,"I have looked for good bear audio and have had trouble finding more than just a growl or chomp. Not sure how I would play it up there? I looked into one of those wild game/predator calls and they are quite expensive and don't have much, if any, bear sounds. We have thought about this for several years and just haven't gotten anywhere. If anyone has ideas.....send them in."

2654777,MattyK,2014-04-08 18:37:00,10,A few years ago we used 30 lb spiderwire tied to a couple of door knobs to lock a couple of guys in their room since they went to bed early.....it's amazing how strong a few runs of that are...needless to say one of them had to go to the bathroom pretty bad when he got out. The following winter we told the story to a couple of new guys and they went to bed with a stock pot in their room to be safe.
2654969,Live to jig,2014-04-08 19:22:00,159,"The other boat kept telling us that there were not perch in the lake, one day we kept one alive in our minnow bucket and put it in his bucket that night after taking out the minnows he had left....He never said a word till the next year when admitted one got in his bucket and ate all his minnows one night!"
2655857,troutwater,2014-04-09 05:34:00,299,"I can think of 3 off the top of my head. The first few years someone would always have the heat turned up in their room...like all the way. Now if it was in the fall it wouldn'be be too bad, but this is July and August. We all have to look before we go to bed now. One year a member of our group was using the outhouse with the door open. Well another guy fired up the lawn mower and started cutting grass blowing the clippings into the outhouse...that was hilarious. Same year to get back at the guy who mowed the grass we put a piece of stinky cheese in his pillow...and he HATES stinky cheese. Best part is that he didn't notice for days, just thought he pillow got wet and was musty."
2656489,Fishoil,2014-04-09 08:01:00,1277,I pulled this one on a guide I know well last summer. He didn't make a big deal of it and nothing much was said about it back at camp so I figured he didn't know who had done it. We all went home and I pretty much forgot about it until I was fishing this past fall with the rod I used on that trip and noticed an end of line sticking out from my reel a few wraps down. When I saw it I knew right away what it was and busted out laughing. My fishing partner couldn't understand why I was laughing uncontrollably about having a broken line until I explained it to him. I guess the bar has been raised.
2656553,bones82,2014-04-09 08:09:00,121,"We went ice fishing one year and stayed in 4 man ice shacks. There were 12 of us. 4 in 3 shacks. Well, they had 5 gallon buckets with plastic bags to go to the bathroom in. Fishing was terrible as we had only caught 12 fish in 2 days. One cabin had relatives in the area and they went to a local smaller lake that only locals would know about and killed the fish without inviting any of the other guys. Well, they went back the next day so we took the liberty of filling their bucket while they were gone. We also cranked their heat on the way out...I'm not sure they ever got the smell out of there. We still laugh about it to this day!"
2657161,SinOrSwim,2014-04-09 10:04:00,1528,"I forgot one. We have been going up for about 20+ years now. My older brother and I were the only ones who had made every single trip. Well, my streak ended about 6 years ago. I had just started my business and could NOT find staff to fill in the whole time I was gone. I tried and tried but ended up having to stay home and work. Anyway, I have a cordless rapala knife and portable fish finder etc they still wanted to use. No problem. Absolutely. Well, I told them I would charge all the batteries and have it all ready to go. I then went and printed off pictures of men with their shirts off, a couple dudes kissing etc. I cut a picture of my brothers face out and pasted to the picture to make it look like he was kissing another guy. Plus, the other basically half naked MAN pictures. I put those pictures inside the cases under the batteries etc. They were in the middle of a fly-in lake and pulled the knife out to do shore lunch and found the pictures!!!!!! ahahhahahahahaa Randomly open something and a half naked picture of a man would fall out. Let me tell you, that was the longest week EVER for me. One, I couldn't go and two I really wanted to know how the pictures were found and if maybe they fell out when the plane was being loaded etc."
2663905,zeebee,2014-04-10 16:42:00,1144,"Had a buddy who bought a new pick-up a few years ago and wouldn't stop talkin about how great the truck was ....no better vehicle on the face of the earth and how anyone who didn't have an exact version would likely die a miserable death only to be welcomed at Satan's bon fire....you all know the type. Anyhow, I created a notice on faked Dealership letterhead informing him of a factory recall to address a defect. It was further required that the maximum highway speed, until the defect was repaired, should not exceed 35MPH. The ""dealership"" noted the letter was being hand delivered due to the high risk of damage to the vehicle and possibly personal injury should the warning not be heeded.Slipped the letter into an envelope and stuck in under the windshield wiper of his truck on a Sunday morning when we were scheduled to leave for a day of grouse hunting.For the first hour of the trip, 1/2 the cars passing us on the hwy would look over and stare at my buddy and it was really unnerving him. It was also likely the 1st hour I had spent with him in the previous month that I didn't hear him singing the virtues of the vehicle. Finally, truth was disclosed that the letter was a fake. He pulled over at the side of the road and started yelling at how stupid my sense of humor was.....it was all pretty funny actually.Guess the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.... I have two sons that accompany me on most fly-in fishing trips. A few years back one couldn't make it because of school and work commitments so it was just the eldest and me. Now, my eldest has this weird fixation with a particular posturpedic/therapeutic pillow that he lugs everywhere when hes away from home claiming he cant sleep with a regular pillow. Drives everyone nuts. My youngest son snapped a picture of himself with no clothes on with the ""sacred"" pillow placed between his crotch and a second 180 shoot where ""beloved"" was held firmly between cheeks. The pictures were placed in the bag that held the pillow and unpacked when we arrived at the cabin. I believe that was the day he had his first shot of whiskey."

2651265,forgop,2014-04-07 21:28:00,880,"So, my cousin is terribly afraid of spiders as I found out from our trip last year when we used a spare boat. Think I need to get some nice fake spiders and put in his sleeping bag and his tackle box. Will try to set up my phone to catch the reaction. Anyone make a point of livening things up with their group?"

LOL Two years ago my brothers wife put a FULL SIZE zombie head in his suitcase. hahahahaha. That zombie head then got put on the pillow of a few people an the covers pulled over it. Imagine the shock when you are tired, a little drunk and you pull down the blanket to go to bed. We have also looked into finding a recording of a Bear and play it outside some of the newbies windows. One other idea we had but decided against was having someone dress up like Big Foot and dart from behind a tree right as it is getting dark. THe costumes are expensive and we were afraid some other group in camp could potentially try to shoot at us. lol probably wouldn't happen but that would put a damper on the trip.I'll follow this thread because we are always looking for ideas."

It was his first trip north and didn't know the tradition of practical jokes. The first worked out perfect. When we pulled into camp, the owner said he had just trapped a mouse in the cabin and set out another just in case. That evening, I put the fake mouse I brought along on the bed near his pillow and covered it with the blanket. Good reaction! The guy hates snakes so of course I had the rubber snake to put in his boat. At the time he really didn't appreciate finding a snake, rubber or otherwise, in the boat. The last thing I brought was a 12"" foam smiling rainbow trout. I put a hook in the fish's mouth and tied the line to the inside latch of his livewell so when he opened the hatch the fish popped up, smiling at him. NimstugI still don't know who stole the kishka..."
