2893145,lassh,2014-06-12 22:40:00,553,What size box do y'all find will work for a flat of crawlers on a fly-in. Its about a 15 hr. drive the first day. Then a couple the next with flight should be on lake around 10:30. I keep them in styrofoam box with bedding a couple layers of newspaper and a blue ice thing on top that I change daily. The box is kept under cabin out of sun.I wondered if I would have problems keeping 2 flats of crawlers in the box I normally use for 1 flat. How do you know if you're putting too many in one container?

When you buy a flat and stick your hand into the flat the crawlers are all in one big lump. Once you start using them you will give them some elbow room. I'm sure you know not to return thecrawlers that you have used in the boat all day back into the original container as it will affect the health of that main container. Have fun."

It's only rated for 12 dozen, but I haven't had an issue with it yet. I've always refrigerated it though. Also, almost every time the flats I purchased (all at different locations) were in sealed cardboard boxes, not styrofoam containers."
2895649,lassh,2014-06-13 19:29:00,553,"Yes. I use a Habitat 2 worm box. Its about 9 1/2"" by 11 1/2"" by 5 1/2"" and it works OK for a flat. I also have an Omaha steaks styro box. Its about 11 1/2 by 12 3/4 by 4 1/2"". I think I'll bring that. I was wondering if I should cut 1 or 2 vent holes and use the inserts from the Habitat box. I duct tape the air vents closed during transit so the crawlers stay cool. I probably don't need the vents if the crawlers only need to survive for 8 days. Any experience or worm experts out there? At risk of highjacking this thread, which I don't think I can do because its my thread, I've read a couple counts of where bears have gotten into crawlers stored outside. I keep them in the cabin crawl space which is basically open to the outside. I have never had them bothered by bears but would hate to lose them. Any advise?"
2896801,lassh,2014-06-14 09:41:00,553,I spoke to the lady at B&B bait in Ottawa IL. She recommended using 2 boxes for the crawlers so I did. Why risk deteriorating your bait. I do think they would have been OK in 1 box. I suppose I could use gullet. Does anyone know definitively if its legal?...just kidding.
2900849,adempsey,2014-06-15 20:04:00,963,"I realized I made an error. I have the Habitat II, not the Habitat V. The box was at my buddies and I just got it back."
