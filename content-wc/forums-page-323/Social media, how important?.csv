2904497,kzoofisher,2014-06-16 18:11:00,5144,"Facebook is a cheap way to keep your lodge in front of customers and for others to see your lodge when one of their friends is ""tagged"" in a photo you post. It takes a few minutes to post something and you should do it at least three times a week during the season and once a week in the offseason. Save some pics from the summer to post during the winter and you'll build excitement for your customers as well as attracting new ones who like to see fresh postings. Pics can be fish but they can also be sunsets and loons and eagles and moose and all the other good stuff in Ontario. Get a video of the northern lights and you'll probably get shared all around the web. A page that sits unchanged for weeks or months is a real turn off for a lot of people. If you have non-fishing activities be sure to post those regularly, too. That can really help draw in or reassure non-fishing family members about the value of your lodge. Remember that facebook isn't just kids, it's lots and lots of adults who are all linked together by work or school or friends or church or sports teams or music or a hair salon or...... If some of your clients post a recap of their trip it will be seen by dozens if not hundreds of people at no cost to you. Post a link here when you set it up and I'll share it out on my wife's page. I don't even know what lodge you are from but the more lodges there are the better it is for me so post away."
2894585,Ferrispata,2014-06-13 11:40:00,63,I agree!
2894817,wesman40,2014-06-13 13:02:00,45,Facebook can only help. It is very easy to post pictures and status updates and keep current clients that use social media updated with current info. It would generate interest for prospective clients as well.I use social media and I like staying in touch with family and friends that way. I don't use it daily but it is a nice way to stay in touch and see info on topics that interest you.I think it could be a valuable marketing tool that would require minimal effort to get going.
2895033,Knoxabilly,2014-06-13 14:07:00,225,Camps are missing the boat by not having social medias. I'm curious year round whats going on up there. If we could check once in awhile to see fishing reports and photos I think it would please current customer and customers to be
2895097,port1042,2014-06-13 14:38:00,509,"I don't use facebook, twitter, etc. However, I do review blogs and reports on various lodge websites. For example, I fish Perrault Lake a couple of times a year. I review the website of the lodge I stay at as well as the other lodges on that lake. I even check out reports from lodges on Cedar and Wabaskang Lake (neighbors). It really drives me nuts when reports are weeks (or months) old or when questions posted are not responded too. If a lodge is going to have a ""blog"" or ""reports"" area on their website, it's important that it be maintained and updated pretty regularly (every few days max during the season). You'd be better off without than with sites you ignore. I assume that is also true with ""social sites""."
2895401,acplumber,2014-06-13 17:37:00,80,"I think a great tool is you tube I wish there were more videos online about different fly in lakes and resorts( I think I've watch em all, especially with this long winter we just got over) Getting to see the cabin is pretty cool as wells as the fishing but it's nice to see what ur home is like for the next week So if you have a Facebook page with different pics from guests and links to vids on YouTube it's a pretty good marketing tool"
2898641,boof,2014-06-15 07:38:00,115,"It depends. Facebook business pages can be great, if done correctly. I cringe when I see some pages for small businesses. Make sure you use proper grammar, stay neutral on subjects like politics, don't overpost and find something better than your cell phone to take pictures with. I do social media work for the USFWS and stuff like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Flickr are awesome tools for our public outreach. It's likely that you won't bring in too many veteran fisherman via Facebook, but I bet it would be useful when first-timers are looking for an outfitter."
2898729,muskyroller,2014-06-15 07:59:00,56,"Facebook and twitter, and even the occasional update here on WC, Muskiefirst, etc. are free. Free advertising to get the word out on your business...yes please. Now, I don't do facebook and I don't do twitter...but millions of people do."
2898849,LLewellin,2014-06-15 08:36:00,1790,The business must have a web site or I will not even look at them. If they only have Facebook then they are not a valid contender for my business. If I find the info I am looking for on their web site then I might try their Facebook. Most of the time I find the Facebook pages poorly informed and I just get frustrated and move on to the next.
2898889,campchick,2014-06-15 08:45:00,96,Thank you for your input. It's just the information I was looking for. Happy Father's Day!!
2904153,derek204,2014-06-16 16:05:00,56,"I have to say go for it when it comes to social media. Facebook, Youtube, Twitter or here! Being mindful of the time you invest into it, if it can bring you more business how can it hurt. Having your customers post some of their own picks and tagging you in it is an easy way to get your name out there. If it brings you a couple extra customers then boom! its worth it! After that its your job to keep em coming back!"
2893961,campchick,2014-06-13 09:01:00,96,Need some feedback from you folks. How important is social media to you? Do you like to read our Facebook pages? How about Twitter and others? Would you be more apt to visit a camp that has a Facebook website or does it not matter? 'Just trying to get a feel for what works in attracting new fishermen and keeping existing guests. Thanks to all that reply.
2893985,bigwalleye1,2014-06-13 09:13:00,2632,"IMO, any business that relies on one form of advertising exclusively is missing the boat. Different locales, groups and generations respond to and follow diffent social media sites, use some and don't use others. That said, since you asked, my preferences are: -Face to Face over Facebook -birds that twitter over competers and phones that do. I make my living based on personal communication, and respond better to that than the electronic version, but I'm probably old school."
2893993,muskyman73,2014-06-13 09:15:00,402,"I work for a technology company with all the latest gizmo's and gadgets. Don't get me wrong, I like it all....... to some degree. When social networking came about I saw co-workers drop like flies. Some due to constant updating and they could care less about work but more so on who's on my page and bla bla bla. Others got fired for people posting stupid things, calling out sick, winding up in Vegas ect ect. With that in mind I will not sign up to any social networking. I have seen so many peoples lives destroyed or slowly deteriorated over something that never existed 10 yrs ago - adding that we all got along just fine before it existed.And get these kids off these stupid DS's and I think the border patrol in Canada should confiscate anything of this nature from any child crossing. Instead they should be using the fishing rods in their dads boat - no batteries requried !"
2894041,SinOrSwim,2014-06-13 09:26:00,1528,I follow a couple places on facebook and I think it's awesome. We all wish we could be there more often than we are. The websites are rarely updated but a facebook page is continuously updating with the most recent pictures and information about the lodges. It is simple for people at the lodge or the owners to post updates and/or pictures of the days catch. We get to see those big fish caught all the same day they were caught vs waiting til next fall when the owners update their website with the years pictures and rates.
2894065,Carnhzkr,2014-06-13 09:29:00,964,"If I'm interested in a particular lodge, I'll read every word on their web-page. If still interested, I'll check to see if they have a Facebook page, just to see what's there (additional pics, updated fishing reports, blog on what's happening at the camp, etc.). I'm not a Twitter guy.FB / Twitter do not influence my decision to do business with the lodge. If I like what I see on their web-page, what sells me on the place is directly communicating with the owner and first-hand accounts from previous patrons, such as reports I read on WC."
2894097,Gregking,2014-06-13 09:34:00,2658,"If I'm searing for a new camp I will do this: Ask here on WC. See who is sponsors of WC Go to recommended camps websites, review prices and feedback Go to camps facebook page and review comments I will then make my decision All your data should be on your website, prices, accommodations, pictures of camp and rooms or camper lots hook ups If it was my business I would be plugged into everything you can be"
2894113,BrianinVA,2014-06-13 09:39:00,160,"Facebook is a great way to keep your regulars updated with fishing reports and photos and reengage customers of years pasted. We have a couple of greenhorns coming along this year and more than once I've shared our outfitters Facebook posts with them and it has definitely raised their interest for our upcoming trip and, who knows, maybe even helped plant the seeds for a new lifetime customer. Twenty minutes a week posting some updates and photos could pay big dividends. Don't think there is much value in Twitter as there really is no need for instantaneous updates. Plus, I think Facebook is a much better platform for delivering pictures to followers and that is what we really we want to see. My job title has ""social media"" in it so perhaps I'm a bit biased, but social media definitely would weigh into my decision of a a potential camp. You can tell a lot about a camp owner by how well they conduct themselves in the social space."
2894481,Guest,2014-06-13 11:09:00,0,"Yes, Facebook is important. I love to read at least a weekly or every few days reports from resorts I'm interested in staying with. Fish, report and cabin photos, fishing/hunting reports and unique happenings/events allow you to personalize your resort. You can also invite guests to share their experience. I wouldn't look to Twitter, personally."
2894553,Mr. Sauger,2014-06-13 11:35:00,285,"Interesting question. I think the social media is important to attract and recruit the NEXT generation of anglers. Many of us on Walleye Central are older and have not adopted social media, yet we're the ones who are still going to Canada to fish. Yes, we're taking as many younger anglers as we can recruit.Great idea, why deny a powerful emerging marketing tool. No, it won't do much for many of us (see the how old are you posts), but can be the ticket for others. Just take look at how many business with large marketing budgets are using social media  they know. Personally, I don't spend much time there."
2894569,Pezman38,2014-06-13 11:39:00,3196,"Muskman, You do realize that WC is a form of social media right? I agree with bigwalleye, you need to use different forms of advertisement to market to several generations. I enjoy several companies posts on facebook and twitter. I also look at ads from this site from time to time. I have never opened a magazine and tried to find an advertisers website."
