2902065,Lovetofish,2014-06-16 08:10:00,458,I quite often buy a case to bring home and have never had a problem.
2843257,Bigstorm,2014-05-28 20:53:00,799,"I'm wondering if anyone knows what the amount of duty free beer is that can be brought back into the US from Canada. Its not that our group doesnt drink most of what we purchase in Canada, its that we would like to buy more on the way home to bring back. When I buy Canadian beer locally (in WI) it tastes different than when purchased in Canada. Personally, when I am filleting up some walleye at home, I like to have a Canadian beer.Dont get me wrong, LaBatt Blue bought in the US will work in a pinch, but it just doesnt have the same taste as a LaBatt Blue brought back from a Canada trip."
2843457,team walleye,2014-05-28 22:04:00,336,I believe it is a case per person. Ever tried Kokanee?
2843905,bigwalleye1,2014-05-29 06:13:00,2632,"I believe team walleye is right. I usually bring one back as well, esp. Kokanee!!"
2843929,Ferrispata,2014-05-29 06:28:00,63,"If you like it enough, buy as much as you would like and just be ready to pay duty on overages."

2897529,walleyeduran,2014-06-14 16:12:00,286,"Talking about bring Canadian beer back into the US, how does the duty free store work. Do I just stop on the Canadian side and pay them, then pick it up on the US side? Being duty free, does that mean I can buy as many cases of Canadian beer as I like and do not have to pay the duty on the extra cases over one? Thanks, for any responses, Duran"
2897585,BreezyPoint,2014-06-14 16:48:00,1581,"Duty free means free of Canadian duties. Since the beer is made in Canada, it probably doesn't have any duties on it. U.S. Duties, if applicable, still apply.Frank"
2898721,fishinnut 3446,2014-06-15 07:58:00,638,The last 2 yrs. I have been bringing some back (4-5 cases) they never ask how much or check.
2901609,ftfarms,2014-06-16 06:09:00,444,I'm thinking it's one case so if you bring more; the US costoms would probly be taking the over run. :boozer
2902017,Stu,2014-06-16 07:52:00,472,"I'm with you Bigstorm, Canadian Labatt's tastes a lot better than the stuff we get here (maybe it's just the smell of the pine trees and clean air?)"
