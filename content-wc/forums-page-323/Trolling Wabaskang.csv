2821937,KevinSB,2014-05-21 19:09:00,73,"Thanks much, MM. Doing last shopping trip (Bollingbrook) tomorrow so appreciate the input. Also appreciate the great help from Lake Wisconsin. WC'ers rock!"
2842929,derek204,2014-05-28 19:44:00,56,"I'm at Kingfisher on wabby for a week, until june 9th I believe. I will definitely share what I find with ya on here. Or maybe over a cold one lol Tight lines till then"
2844705,KevinSB,2014-05-29 09:29:00,73,"I'll be arriving 6/7 at noon and hopefully starting fishing by mid-afternoon. I'd be glad to provide the beverages any evening if you have ideas to share or just want to chat. We're glad to come to you or you can find us (Kevin, Aaron, and Doug) at Tall Pines. Not yet sure which cabin we'll be in this year.Thanks and good luck!Kevin"
2889049,derek204,2014-06-11 17:33:00,56,"sorry for the late reply, I did find good a good walleye bite in the evening at the first narrows most nights, a few at the second narrows north and did quite well in Keynote. though I found the walleye a tad smaller in Keynote. I was using worms and typically found them 10ft deep. Honestly one of the hottest spots was off the dock at Kingfisher where we were staying lol"
2891905,reconssd,2014-06-12 14:51:00,147,Pick up a couple Bandit deep diver walleye lures. Red head with gold body. Hands down the best walleye trolling lure I have ever used. Pike will inhale too.
2894761,trapper_john,2014-06-13 12:49:00,83,The dock at camp has always been a hot spot for me as well. Can't have beer in the boat but I sure can when I take a chair down to the dock. When the sun starts to go behind the trees across from camp has never failed me. We will be there for the week starting the 12th of July. This will be our 7th or 8th trip. Great folks and an excellent camp. IMHO.
2904073,derek204,2014-06-16 15:53:00,56,"bang on about the sun dipping behind them trees, and the beer lol maybe catch ya before you leave I believe we are back there on the 19th for a week"
2811921,KevinSB,2014-05-19 11:25:00,73,"Hi there. I'm heading back to Wabaskang (Tall Pines Camp) on June 7 and thinking of doing a bit of trolling for something different and better finding schools of active fish. We typically find likely spots and work spinners or even vertical jig, but I recognize we're likely to find new patterns if we start by trolling to find them instead of assuming we know where they'll be.I've searched the forums (nothing on point for Wabaskang) and hoped some Wabby WC veteran would be willing to share suggested approaches and/or critique mine.We'll have three guys fishing with one out the back and planer boards on each side. We're contemplating a relatively shallow Rapala on one, maybe a spoon on leadcore on another, and probably a slightly deeper Rapala on the other. Think we'll run one along the shore especially due to late ice-out, and we'll probably explore the depth changes with all the little islands and points around the main lake. We may also troll around Doe Island due to the sharp drop to deep water.Our goal is to find some larger (24""+) eyes (catch and release) and are targeting quality over quantity. We can catch eaters doing the usual stuff but want to try some different things this year. I'm interested in trying different depths, but at the same time am not convinced there's any reason to look deep this early in the season.Even for those who don't fish Wabaskang, but especially for those who do, I'd appreciate any thoughts from the vast collective wisdom here on WC. Thanks in advance."
2812417,MuskyMaster,2014-05-19 13:24:00,79,"Never fished that particular lake but ill give ya some pointers on trolling. With 3 rods you shouldn't get tangled so i would only use the boards if you want to or if you wanna get one line deeper or shallower. The middle guy needs to let out a lot more line than the other to. We realized this last year trolling that the 2 outsides were outfishing the middle bad. Came to the conclusion that it was from the motor disturbance. Once that guy let out more line he started hooking fish, took awhile to reel in but still hooked them. Stick baits such as husky jerks and xraps are good for shallower game. June 7th the fish should be spead out a lil ways so with 3 lines your shallow may be in 6-10 middle 10-13 out 13-20. That being said i would run the shallow bait, a dt10 or shad rap will run 10-13 and a deep diver or even one that runs around 12ft. Im a firm believer in bigger baits bigger fish, so i dont use the shad raps as much any more. i prefer the 4-6"" baits."
2812625,KevinSB,2014-05-19 14:13:00,73,"MuskyMaster, thanks for the quick response! We'll run the middle line deeper and sounds like I'll be talked out of using boards. Also appreciate the depth and lure suggestions. Thanks again!"
2812673,Lake Wisconsin,2014-05-19 14:26:00,1960,"Kevin - I have fished Wabby many times, and have done the exact same thing - trolled - something unheard of running boards in Canada. We did this for 3 different reasons - 1. to locate fish, then come back with jigs, spinners, slip bobbers, etc 2. during a major may fly hatch - most people in camp were doing terrible. I went to a trigger bite mentallity and we hammered them. 3. when we wanted the ""party"" on the boat. Instead of running 2 boats, sometime we would head all 4 of us in my boat and run 4 boards. Was a hoot - more like a fire drill. Almost never had all 4 in at a time between catching walleye, pike and smallies. Rather than boring the whole WC on the details, reach out to me msg and I will help you out."
2812753,KevinSB,2014-05-19 14:47:00,73,Thanks much. I will indeed reach out!
2813921,ftfarms,2014-05-19 20:19:00,444,They run boards all the time on wabby in mid summer months Never seen anyone run them in the spring. We just troll spinner rigs with a floating worm harness with one hook when we're looking for fish. We also run one with a phelps floater and a worm or minnow. We also troll with jigs like a whistler jig Not saying its not a good ideal I'm just not a board fan. I have seen some good fish caught in August on boards on wabby. Good luck. Hope it all works for you.
2814345,KevinSB,2014-05-20 05:27:00,73,"Thanks, ftfarms. We spend most of our time pulling spinners but hope to cover ground more quickly when searching. I appreciate the comment!"
2814361,UKBDM,2014-05-20 05:31:00,178,I have had success long line trolling Wally Divers (deep version) in 10-12' of water the last week of June and really banging them off bottom or rocks on the bottom. I use a couple cheaper rods/reels spooled with 10# mono so I get lots of stretch when a bite (or snag) occurs. I have tried using mini-boards in this scenario and not done as well. Not sure why. I also use big boards to troll for pike on Wabaskang and have had great success using musky size stick baits. Try this over deep water and you will be surprised how many big walleye you catch.
2814633,KevinSB,2014-05-20 06:54:00,73,"Thanks, UKBDM. Love the idea of trying musky-sized bait for big fish. Thanks for taking the time to share!"
2820129,MuskyMaster,2014-05-21 11:07:00,79,Proven fact walleye love the walleye pattern supershad rap!! Musky and pike love it as well.
