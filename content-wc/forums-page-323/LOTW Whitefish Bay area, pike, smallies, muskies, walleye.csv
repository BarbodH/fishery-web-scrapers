2893641,nicko,2014-06-13 07:24:00,508,"Those are all great places, but they are about an hour boat ride. All 3 are in yellow girl bay. Good gps and a route are a must as the ride is filled with some very rocky areas. I'd look south and west a bit. It's worth the trip, but in a camp boat, it will be a long long day. Nick"
2893657,srk-low,2014-06-13 07:28:00,78,"You are staying in some of the best northern and musky water on the lake. Bell Island is a couple miles northwest of your camp. Bell and it's surrounding islands, especially the east side islands are very productive for large northern and musky. My family has been fishing out of our cottage in Sioux Narrows for over thirty years and have consistently caught ""the big ones"" in this area. The best walleye fishing is up in yellow girl once they have moved to the humps. An area not as utilized is Cross Inlet which is in the northwest part of Whitfish Bay. We get good northern and the occasional large walleye in Cross. It's a large lake, PM me and I will be glad to be more specific."
2895849,Further North,2014-06-13 21:13:00,2008,"Thanks Nick, I'll take a look. We're not in a camp boat, we're in a Crestliner CMV with a 140 Johnzuki. Figure double camp boat speeds...if I know the water...and I don't."
2895889,Further North,2014-06-13 21:27:00,2008,Thanks - PM Sent.
2896073,nicko,2014-06-13 23:07:00,508,"If you don't have a track up there, it can be a bit tricky. Lots of rocks and hidden shallows. In my own boat from snake bay it took almost an hour following a guide at 40mph. Unless you follow someone, it can be a long slow trip. Be careful. Just don't want to see you drop the lower unit. N"
2896761,Further North,2014-06-14 09:32:00,2008,"Me either!I err on the side of caution - Canadian water is too big and the woods to too deep to be screwing around and taking chances.I've been known to go a long, long way on my trolling motor in water I don't know the first time I'm in it."
2902249,rjstubbl,2014-06-16 08:59:00,3,I agree that cross inlet would be a great place to try for norhtern/musky. I haven't spent a lot of time in there but I have seen and heard of some big fish from there.
2874977,Further North,2014-06-07 11:22:00,2008,"We are headed up that way two weeks from today, any thoughts or advice?I'll be chasin' pike for the most part...my fishing partner's got a broader wish list.Really looking forward to the trip!"
2888969,Further North,2014-06-11 16:30:00,2008,Anyone? Anyone? Buehler?
2890073,troutwater,2014-06-12 06:10:00,299,"Wish I could help, been wanting to fish that area for years! Are you staying at Whitefish Bay Camp?"
2891041,srk-low,2014-06-12 10:04:00,78,Where are you staying and how far of a ride are you comfortable with?
2891185,jawjerker,2014-06-12 10:45:00,103,"Whitefish bay area, as you may know, has everything from large mouth Bass to Lake trout. Where are you staying? I'd suggest NOT staying at Whitefish Bay Camp however as they like to charge the U.S. price of a gallon of gas for a liter of gas. So, if the price of a gal. of gas in the states is $3.50 per gal, that's what I was charged per liter. And they wouldn't listen to me. Good luck, Jawjerker"
2891265,troutwater,2014-06-12 10:59:00,299,No way for real???
2891313,rjstubbl,2014-06-12 11:15:00,3,"I don't fish whitefish much but give Knickerbocker a try for Northern. Go out to chisholm, britannia, bath for some walleye."
2892905,Further North,2014-06-12 20:34:00,2008,We are.
2892913,Further North,2014-06-12 20:36:00,2008,Whitefish Bay Camp...we'd go quite a ways for great fishing. Boat has a 41 gallon tank and runs 30+ MPH at cruise.
2892921,Further North,2014-06-12 20:37:00,2008,Thanks - I just need to figure out where those spots are...The locals should know.
