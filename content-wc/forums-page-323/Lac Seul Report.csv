Had two days that the six of us caught over 400 Walleye and a normal day was in the 250 range. Biggest Eye was 27 1/2"" but caught a lot of 21"" to 25"" fish. Key was fishing the backs of bays that the wind had been pounding. Fish were in depths of 6' to 15' and jigs with minnows or crawlers performed equally. Water temps ranged from 51 to 60 with the warmer areas being the best producers. Mike Kansas"
