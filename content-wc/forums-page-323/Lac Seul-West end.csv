2903273,stumcfar,2014-06-16 12:32:00,451,"Stayed at Golden Eagle and fished the 5th thru the 7th. We fished mainly around Sawmill, Herb's point and Lunker Point, both on wind swept points and quiet bays and did very well. Jig and a minnow and also jig with slip bobbers. 8 dozen minnows was not enough with 3 people in the boat. Several big fish this year also. Not sure how much things will change in the two weeks, but hopefully you will have a great trip!"
