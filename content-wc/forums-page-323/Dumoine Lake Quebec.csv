While any lake around there can produce large fish, larger lakes with larger forage bases obviously produce larger numbers of big fish. Dumoine is a large lake so it has that going for it plus it has always been an ""exclusive rights"" lake (must fish thru an outfitter) so that helps control harvest. I have seen what can happen in lakes in that area if harvest isn't regulated well. Sorry to offer such generic information, but since I'm a regular in the general area thought I'd chine in"
