2900153,BGunn,2014-06-15 16:08:00,880,"Exact same thing happen right next to my house. Now they have to get permits from the Army Corps of Engineers, State DEC, Have to get county engineers to design new culvert, and on and on it goes. They say POSSIBLY could be done in 3 months. I always did want to live on a dead end road...."
2901209,Further North,2014-06-15 22:29:00,2008,"It's not getting the work done that takes time in Illinois...it's greasing all the palms that need to be greased that takes the time.Everyone, their brother, their uncle, their cousin and their best friend has to get their piece of the action."

2892889,Pooch,2014-06-12 20:28:00,4619,"Seems every few years there is one if not more washouts along that stretch of highway. Actually, in general there are a lot of this type of highway damage in Canada every year. In the states we have a better base to build on, in Canada most of the time they are building on rock and sandy soils.I'm always amazed at how fast they can repair this type of damage after the water goes down. I see a lot of beaver traps near culverts in Canada. That surely con't help matters any.Thanks for the photo.Pooch"
2893073,GNO,2014-06-12 21:41:00,153,It is a hard surfaced road.
2893697,Aaron-IN,2014-06-13 07:36:00,500,"The river road route is easy, I've done it a couple times over the years. I wouldn't change my travel plans, you will be fine pulling boats and getting around the washout."
2894089,J-Man,2014-06-13 09:34:00,191,Local resident informed me that HWY 11 has been repaired and reopened. No visual confirmation via photo yet. A quick repair is certainly possible with the gravel contractors near the area. Hope to get a photo to post soon.
2895257,Obabikon,2014-06-13 15:45:00,2370,"Very impressive how quickly they get the job done. I'm not sure about other states, but in Illinois... that would've taken weeks."
2895409,@Lunker,2014-06-13 17:41:00,835,"Just came home over that section today. It's all good, as of 4 Am this morning according to CBC. Kudos to whomever was out there busting their bums."
2895529,Pooch,2014-06-13 18:47:00,4619,"What I was saying is that the base you folks build on is usually rock and sand. I think it is amazing how fast the Canadians can resurface a road or make repairs.Here in the disfunctional state of Illinois that same washout would have taken weeks if not months as it would have to be re-engineered, endangered species studied, EPA permits applied for to be sure all the washed out asphalt is cleaned up and taken to a licensed hazardous waste landfill only by a licensed hazmat contractor, but only after the proper permits had been applied for and in hand, followed by a FEMA study as to how to prevent anything like this in the future, bids let and opened in a posted meeting by the governing authority, prevailing wage requirements met, endless forms for permits from several agencies who don't even know what a culvert is and then a sample of all materials would have to be submitted to be certain they met spec, then if the winning bid was a non union shop there would be picketers from the local hall. That would draw the local media and it would be on the evening news. Then the local politicians would want a committee appointed to study the bidding procedure insuring that all the voters were aware that they were ""on the ball"".All the while the main highway is closed, all the traffic would be going around one of the local township roads that can't possibly handle the added car traffic let alone the tractor trailers. This would cause the local township to have to apply for a grant to rebuild the bypass road and all of the above would start all over again.I've spent twenty some years on a local township board and this is the way it works or not in Illinois.Canada is far ahead of us in common sense. Keep it up!Pooch"
2895569,Skywagon,2014-06-13 18:55:00,1106,"But Pooch, you left out the extraordinarily inexpensive property taxes you pay for all those services."
2895617,zman8701,2014-06-13 19:17:00,100,"Wow that was quick, my hats off to the people who still are not afraid to work."
2897409,walleyeduran,2014-06-14 15:19:00,286,"Pooch, you just have way to many people down in Illinoise."
2891833,J-Man,2014-06-12 14:26:00,191,"Provincial HWY 11 has washed out east of the town of Emo. This could affect anyone travelling to the areas of, but not limited to, Morson, Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows, Kenora, etc. An alternate route allowing you to cross at Baudette/Rainy River may be your best bet until the highway is repaired and reopened. Please spread the word to your fellow fishing friends to help them avoid possible travel hiccups. We will update this thread when we have new/more information that is relevant and confirmed. Safe travels to all."
2891849,GNO,2014-06-12 14:30:00,153,You can bypass this on the River Road from Emo to Fort Frances
2891873,J-Man,2014-06-12 14:42:00,191,"Good to know, Lucas! For those of us not as familiar with River Rd, can you let us know where people would access it near Fort Frances to get by the washout? Thanks!"
2892001,fishingfever,2014-06-12 15:06:00,85,We plan to travel this road on Sunday. Appreciate any updates. Does anyone know of any official sites that might have information? TIA
2892129,J-Man,2014-06-12 15:46:00,191,"Got this in an email from Lucas for those looking for a bypass/detour around the washout: ""Turn left just before McDonalds by the water tower in Fort Frances and follow it. You will end up coming out by Border Land Esso in Emo. It is really easy if you just stay on the road and do not turn."""
2892257,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-06-12 16:42:00,84,Thanks for the info. We left Indiana about 2 hours ago and are headed straight that way.
2892297,GNO,2014-06-12 17:05:00,153,I believe that the River Road is HWY 602
2892593,yoopertrout,2014-06-12 18:49:00,1172,"Leaving tomorrow. Not going that way, but I appreciate you posting this. Probably saving a lot of people some hassle."
2892697,michigan walleye guy,2014-06-12 19:26:00,95,"Thanks for the updates! Headed to Nestor Falls on Saturday. Just e-mailed Dave and Michelle at Nestor Falls Outposts and asked their opinion as to whether the road will be open by Saturday, or if not, what alternative route to take. I had a feeling that I would be paying for the mid-70's, clear, calm, sunny weather we had on our Larus Lake trip last month."
2892841,Caleb,2014-06-12 20:11:00,36,Is that road gravel or blacktop?
