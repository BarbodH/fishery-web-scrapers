3754330,wingmann,2015-04-11 05:53:00,42,"I have been up to Canada for fishing trips at resorts numerous times. I have been lucky and have never had a bad trip. My brother on the other hand had one when he decided to try a different resort one year. We usually go to LOTW and fish for walleye, northern and smallmouth. Him and his buddy go to a different resort on LOTW. They hire a guide who ends up being the resort owners son. He takes them out on a nice boat and jumps to the bow starts throwing Muskie baits. They ended up fishing for muskies that day. Unfortunately, they don't really have the tackle for this nor the interest in Muskie fishing. So this day they pretty much paid to watch their guide fish. They decided not to use a guide for the rest of the trip. Just wondering what disappointing fishing trips others may have experienced whether in Canada or elsewhere. Wingmann"
3754593,Pooch,2015-04-11 06:55:00,4619,"Your brother and his buddy got snookered. They should have put up a protest or had a better understanding of what the goal for the day was supposed to be.Some ""guides"" are not. I've never hired a guide, but have watched others and most of the time I wasn't impressed. That said there are some really good guys guiding and for a short trip to a totally new lake might be money well spent. An acquaintance of mine always uses a guide as he is certainly not a fisherman and he is always catching fish on his trips north.The only disappointing trip we've had was my fault in that I took for granted what the brochures said only to find that the lake was gin clear and really just a lake trout lake. Had I done my research prior to booking I would have know that, yes there are walleye in the lake, but they are twenty or thirty miles north of the camp. Left after the second day. My fault and the fault of a little creative advertising on the camps part. Never had a bad trip since, but ask many questions here on WC before making a commitment to an unknown camp or area.Just another life's lesson learned years ago.Pooch"
3754625,btyreprich,2015-04-11 07:08:00,1067,"Went to a camp in the Red Lake area at ge suggestion of a lodge owner we had been going yo for many years. We just wanted to try something new. When we got to the ""new"" camp, we were shocked as to how small the cabins were. The lakes this camp was on seemed to have been fished out! We then tried a few portage lakes and one guy wrenched his back out carrying the outboard. On the way back to the camp that day, our outboard motor almost fell off the boat! It was never bolted onto the boat! I wonder if the motor falling off the boat would have been our fault and we'd have to pay for a new outboard motor. Left after like 3 days. Thankfully this was a very isolated experience and it's why we tend to stay at a camp once we have found it to be ""nice""."

3754993,joe h,2015-04-11 08:49:00,46,"Last 5 years, I've had one deep sea fishing trip exceed expectation, two that were alright, and two that were nothing more than $800 boat rides. The best one, we were in the Bahamas, and the captain found a school of mahi mahi and two sail fish. the worst one was in Haiti, two frozen herring and 6 plastic squids, trolling 10 mph a mile offshore. There were six of us and we raided the kids cooler to recover the losses. About an hour into it, and everyone had a disgusted look on their face. Two hours in, we realized he circled the same spot twice, which confirmed this is how we were spending the day fishing. After three hours everyone grew restless, and we told him to head back. The entire way back, he was spewing some bs about water clarity. When we returned I told my brother that was my last trip. To much risk, for little reward."

3755225,SinOrSwim,2015-04-11 10:00:00,1528,"We had a bad trip many many years ago. Before the internet. We were going to the All Canada show. We had done about 4 fly ins with the same outfitter. All good but nothing great as far as fishing. The fly in lakes with big numbers but not big size. Looking back, that could have been partially due to our inexperience also though. Anyway, went to the All Canada show and found a place that was a fly in and had everything. Big fish, all food included, beer included, the whole works. Some of the crappy trip was weather some was the outfitter. Anyway we were to fly out of fort francis airport first thing in the morning so we drove all night to get there. We were getting into I-falls about 4 or 5am. We stopped about 5 or 10 miles out of I falls at this little gas station. Some guy working and a friend or two talking to them. Guy asks where we are going. We tell them because that's what you do right. Ohhhhh, you're crossing the border? Yep. Here I have some extra border passes I'll sell ya. I don't remember but I think we paid $20 for some border passes. ......................................yeah, those weren't border passes. LOOLOLOLOLOL DOH!!!!! This was the start. So, we stop for breakfast. Beautiful clear day. Get to airport, perfect. No plane........no plane.....no plane.......I guess it was foggy has heck up at the lodge and plane couldn't make it. We waited at the airport all afternoon. Slept on the chairs and the floor there. Played catch with a football in the parking lot. Finally, left and went and got food and a hotel in Fort Francis. Try again tomorrow.Next day............beautiful. Socked in up north eh. Foggy. Finally after hours they show up but it is with like 3 small planes vs one bigger plane. So, we take off and we get to their main camp/lodge before boating the rest of the way but the rest of the group isn't there yet. I hear the owner on the radio with the pilot and he is cussing because our group is complaining about something? Not sure what but he knew we were literally right around the wall. Not cool to do that. So, they finally get there and we all boat in to the outposts. The outposts that are supposed to have EVERYTHING. All you are supposed to bring is you toothbrush. LOL Well, and clothes and sleeping bag, but you get the point. The food is crap. Partial bags of stuff. Open boxes of pancake mix. Wilted veggies like they were what wasnt' okay to serve at the main lodge. Just sort of the leftovers. And, not a ton of anything. There were I think 8 of us on this trip? When we arrived there was like 2 or 2 1/2 cases of beer there. He said they would bring more. Did I mention we were in our 20's? We went through that beer fast. We were very up front with this owner we wanted plenty of beer and ice. We would pay the extra fees. In a 5 day trip we ran out of beer 3 times. We tried the radio. They answered at first then ignored us. We ran out of bait. We basically ran out of everything.Well, it turns out the owner had sold the outpost cabins. We were the last group to go in before the new owner took over. THAT is why we got the scraps and he didn't give a crap about us. Easily the worst trip we have ever had. Promises of a 5 star experience and delivered a 1 star at best.The good news is the new owner intervened in our argument with the owner and we were impressed with him. Ended up using him as an outfitter for many years after that. One of the best.I still laugh when I drive past that gas station we got taken for the fake border passes. LOL"

To an outfitter we didn't know. 1. Plane almost didn't lift off or clear trees.2. outpost cabin: window and door screens all distroid.3. it was summer, with plenty of black fly and skeeters.4. woke up each morning with fly's leaving our faces.5. no filet house or bench or bucket for same.6. half the woods gone from landscape due to forset fire.7. Outhouse has no door, but plenty of bugs.8. Lake was ok. But not productive.9. did not meet our limit.10. My buddies two friends, well they aren't my friends. They didn't do any fileting or cooking the whole trip.Can anyone top that for what we paid?!!!!Still, its beats the office!"
3873409,jaybe,2015-05-15 11:50:00,31,"My first trip to a Canadian fishing camp was my worst - Thankfully! The owner had a bad heart, so he hired a 19-year old guy to be his general handyman and around-the-camp ""helper"" for guests. We had our first hint of his irresponsible behavior when he took the owners 4-wheeler out to supposedly check on some bear baits. When he didn't return in a reasonable time, we went looking for him. Driving down one of the bush roads, the kid on the 4-wheeler suddenly appeared over the road (as in above it) - having raced over the RR track to get some air. He was banned from using the machine after that. Since he lived in town, he volunteered to bring us some fresh minnows the next morning. We all put up some money - plus extra to cover his gas and trouble - and next morning, he brings us some very sickly minnows, half of them dead. We were all pretty sure he offered to clean them out of the tanks for the bait store owner. The kid, meanwhile, suddenly has a nice new rod and reel combo. The last night we were there, we fished until dark and each put our legal limit in the camp livewell to wait for morning to clean them and package them for travel. Next morning, 30 walleye had disappeared! Wonder where they could have gone? No sign of the young guy that day."
3876194,wisdom,2015-05-16 12:21:00,27,"Thankfully I have not encountered the problems most of you have had on your worst trips. I rely on self and take my own boat and pick-up camper into remote areas of Quebec. However I have found out every trip has the potential to be a great one. It is the people we select to bring with us that can make or break any trip. Many trips I go fishing by myself. I can not stand whiners, complainers and slackers who's focus is on self. I have taken some great fishermen North who could fill stringers full of fish but when it came time to clean them, cook them, do dishes, clean and fill the boat motor, carry fire wood ect, they were worthless. One guy all he did was fish, eat, sleep and complain about the black flies. All my trips have been good to outstanding but the worst ones was because of some of the people who went with me."

Fished 2 hrs with new boat to find drain hose for live well wasn't hooked up. Didn't sleep that night due to dads hired man snores LOUD. Go fish next day only to come back to a Forrest fire. Camp is telling us to get the f out. Dad grabbed his meds, bro grabbed the van but forgot my trailer, I filled up the boat and we went idk 25 miles north to some camp for miners or something on the river. Came back the next day to find the camp half burned up. Trailer next to mine half burned. Our cabin was fine however smoke filled the air. I got asthma and couldn't breath very well. So we packed up and left for home. We were the lucky ones. I will post pics when I get home. Aug of '95"

3780033,ziggyzag,2015-04-18 08:01:00,125,"A few years ago we flew into Kap north of Nakina we had 8 men in a 8 man cabin so room was at a minimum. Shortly after our group was in which took two flights we see a float plane approaching our camp well we thought it was our outfitter returning to help set things up around camp see the boats where still on shore without motors attached no gas in the tanks I guess due to the late ice out not that big a deal. When the plane came up to the dock the pilot and 4 gentlemen got out and the pilot says it to foggy north of here to continue his flight to drop off these gentlemen so they will need to spend the night at our camp, no big deal we would make due with the situation. The bad part was that this group was the second flight in to there lake and all there food clothing drinks and worst of all all there fishing equipment had already been flown in. Well as it turned out our guest stayed 4 days before the weather cleared enough so they could continue on there way. So this might not have been the worst trip for our crew because we slammed the walleyes and pike but for the 4 guys who where fogged in it must have sucked."
3784777,Baseline,2015-04-19 18:36:00,3207,This happened 35 years ago on my second fly in. 4 of us decided to fly into a lake trout / Pike / Musky lake. Two smaller Cesna's took us in. When we arrived we found a plywood shack that looked like a big shipping crate on blocks. There was no door only a 4 X 8 sheet of plywood to cover it. No screen on the one window and the bunks had some well used mattresses that smelled like mouse pizz. The boats and motors were in similar shape. The picture we had been shown at the Northwest Sports Show when we booked the trip was of another cabin the resort owned located at the other end of the lake. It was very nice. Fortunately when we had arrived at the base before leaving on the flight the owner was gone and we had not paid the balance of the bill. When we arrived we loaded our gear and left. We figured the $50 deposit we had each paid wasn't worth the hassle of trying to get it back. We never heard from the resort owner either. I've been to 30 or 40 other resorts and have had excellent service and nice accommodations everywhere.

3756617,MikeinMN,2015-04-11 21:29:00,190,"We flew in to a cabin that had most of the pots and pans thrown under it instead of washing them. The outhouse was very near full. Think about that for a second. Full. We used campfire ashes to somewhat control the outhouse smell. There were many places around the cabin where previous guests did not want to use the full outhouse. This was a trip with food included and we were out of most things by day 2 of 6. Things that I feel are important like fish breading, cooking oil, eggs, potatoes, onions, etc. No ice, ever, even though we requested and paid for ice. The outfitter had bought the place that year (I think from his brother) and had booked us using the previous owners name. He was only in business for that one season and we never saw him once we flew out. What can you do? I'm still going to Canada every year and will be as long as I can manage it."

3757601,last chance,2015-04-12 08:51:00,3262,I always try to make the best of any trip but have had a few that the fishing wasn't what I expected. made one trip up to wi salmon fishing and after a very long drive we were told the salmon run was over. we went ahead and fished for a few hrs and with nothing to show for our efforts we gave it up. so we had a think tank and all agreed to drive on up through the up of mi and back down to Manistee lake in mi for more salmon fishing.(it was a beautiful trip) we got to Manistee lake and it was still holding a few fish. we did catch a few fish then drove back home. I guess one of my worst trips was when we chartered out a boat on lake Cumberland for some stripers in late may. it had been raining a lot the last couple of weeks. we got to the docks and met with the captain. we got on the water and he put out 4 rods with spoons that looked a lot like salmon spoons. about that time he went on to tell us with all the rain that the water was real high and the bite hadn't been very good. that he hadn't been catching any strippers but had caught some walleyes and sm bass. well we really wasn't wanting walleye or sm bass as we could catch them without a charter. he said that he would have just reschedualed us but he knew how far we had drove to go fishing. (we were already down in Jamestown tn for our family reunion so we had only drove about 40 miles. but he thought we had come from in.) we trolled until about 1:00 pm. and then after catching 1 sm bass he says if we wanted to quit early he would refund us 100.00. I told him we were ready to quit when he told us we wasn't going to catch any stripers. so we were refunded 100.00 and drove the 40 miles back to Jamestown tn.
3762985,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-04-13 17:32:00,358,A fishing buddy and I purchased a fishing package on Table Rock Lake in Missouri. Included was a guide for the first day. He showed up late and told us to follow him in another boat. A buddy of his got in with the guide. We followed him to a cove and he informed us he was going turkey hunting. We saw him later in the afternoon and he asked what we had caught. .

3770881,north_alabama,2015-04-15 15:39:00,172,"In Canada my worst was a trip in Quetico Provincial Park in 1999 when I had an 8-day long gallbladder ""attack"" (at the time I had no idea what it was). It started the day we paddled out of BWCA over to the Canadian side and ended the day before we re-entered BWCA. Lots of rough weather on that trip, and I only felt well enough to fish about 3 times. But, I caught my personal best smallmouth during that trip on McEwen Lake, and one of the other guys who made the trip passed away within a year, and I appreciate having that last time out in the park with him.Another close call was a trip up to Lac Des Mille Lacs in 2006. I live in Alabama and drove up to Illinois where I spent a couple days with my family there before Dad and I drove up to Thunder Bay. When we got to Thunder Bay I discovered that I had left my tackle ""box"" at my Dad's house. (which had everything except a few ""spare"" crawler harnesses, 25 #2 hooks, 25 #4 hooks, and 25 yards of fluorocarbon leader) I did have my rods/reels though. Talk about a sick feeling. The next morning on the way to meet the boat to take us out to the outpost camp we stopped at Canadian Tire and I bought about $75 worth of stuff and put it in a 5""x8""x1"" flambeau tray. It was less than I'd normally take into Quetico and we had 10 days to fish. Caught plenty of fish, though, and some of the spinner baits and Rapala's I grabbed were literally falling apart by the end. I got very good mileage out of slip bobbers and learned a lot. Got my two personal best (at the time) walleyes on that tripNo such thing as a ""bad"" trip to Canada to fish. Some just more challenging than others."
3774297,KSjim,2015-04-16 14:41:00,88,"I have had only one ""bad"" fishing trip to Canada. It was with a very good outfitter on a very good lake. The problem was the weather. My Uncle and I picked what was close to the hottest 5 days in a row on record in Ontario for our trip.It was just miserably hot and humid and no place to escape. The cabin did have electricity and fans, but there was still no way to cool the cabin down because the lows were 79 or 80 degrees with the highs being 98 to 103 with very high humidity. Taking cold showers helped but the relief did not last long. Too hot to fish, eat or sleep. But the worst part was it was even to hot to drink beer!The first, and hopefully the last, time I was truly thrilled to see the float plane come in to pick us up."
3777553,SinOrSwim,2015-04-17 11:06:00,1528,"One of the last fly ins we did was in late August/early September. It was a 5 nighter. It was BRUTALLY HOT!!!!! It was not uncommon to get a hot day here and there but not hot days in the 90's with nights still in the 70's. Sun, no wind, nothing. Miserable in a boat!!!!! Most afternoons we came back to the cabin and we wore life jackets like a diaper and just floated in the lake. Late morning or early afternoon the day before we were to fly out we saw a plane land. We buzzed in real quick. We were asking if there was anyway we could be picked up early. This is a trip we have been doing for 15+ years at the time. He said there was an otter in the area and if we really wanted he could have it swing by and pick us up. But, just us and not our gear. They would have to send the plane the next day with one of us to get all the gear. We did. We packed all our stuff and left that afternoon. It wasn't like we missed any fishing. We weren't going to fish the rest of the afternoon anyway. It was so hot we spent the afternoons in the lake. Sleeping was almost impossible. No electricity so no fans. No air movement. Cabin tucked away in the tress. We were flying out the next am anyway. To get back and sit in a restaurant that night to drink beer in the AC was awesome!!!!!!!"
