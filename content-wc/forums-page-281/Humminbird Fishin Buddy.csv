After putting it together, I realize the shaft that connects the unit to the transducer is only 24 inches. The fly in we are using has standard camp style lund boats with a 9.9 or 15hp motor, like you see everywhere.My question is- will this unit work, or is the shaft too short to reach the water?"

3871001,TIGHTLINER,2015-05-14 17:57:00,223,I have the 140 and so does my boy they work very well. You will be happy with it. Being that it mounts on the boat everything is off to the side and boat. No wires to fool with.
