I was wondering if anyone has utilized these rigs while trolling? Also, if I understand the rules of Quebec, I can only have three hooks per line. If the remaining arms have anything but hooks on them, I should be within the law right?I am aware that when I get into it with a 25+ northern, it will be wearing $15 worth of jewelry."

3872721,dkrusin,2015-05-15 08:22:00,97,I tried 2 different umbrella rigs last year trolling for Northern. I actually think it scarred them away. Sold them on ebay when I got home.
