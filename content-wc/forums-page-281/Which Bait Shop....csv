3881521,KM1,2015-05-18 10:57:00,374,So I have three choices so far: 1. Nestor Falls Bait & Tackle 2. Anglers Pro Shop Nestor Falls 3. Rainy Lake Sports & Tackle Anyone have negative experiences with any of these? Called all of them...all seem to have what we need (except no one in Canada divides there leeches by size). Would like to go to the shop that has the best likelihood of larger (Jumbo) leeches in the lbs they sell...AND solid flats of Canadian Crawlers.
3881889,timpursell,2015-05-18 12:32:00,4,"Leeches have gone up so much in recent years, we gave up on using them."
3882281,NathanH,2015-05-18 13:36:00,697,Honestly I don't think leaches are worth the price. Crawlers all the way.
3882593,camp chef,2015-05-18 14:32:00,915,We quit fishing with leeches years ago as well. Crawlers are the only live bait we use. $96 a flat at Jim's Ash Trail store. Plenty for a 4 guys for a week.
3882657,NAV165,2015-05-18 14:44:00,412,"I was just quoted $74 for a flat at Rainy Lake Sports. Take off about 20 percent for the exchange rate and it seems like a great deal. Funny thing, he apologized for the high price and thought the prices would come down in a couple of weeks."
3883929,KM1,2015-05-18 19:30:00,374,"are still a BIG part of our bait selection on LOTW. All depends on what we are using. Last year we probably caught 1/2 of our walleyes, maybe more, on lindy rigs with leeches. The other half on bouncers with crawlers. Some years...jig and leech...not last year though. Can't see not having leeches in the boat. Heartier than crawlers, albeit, depending on the day, crawlers work as well. All depends. Anyway...still no negatives on any of the 3 places with regard to leeches or crawlers? Or big positives on one over the others?"
3856601,KM1,2015-05-10 10:53:00,374,"on the way through International Falls on up to Sioux Narrows area...is better between these two: 1. Nestor Falls Bait & Tackle 2. Anglers Pro Shop Nestor Falls What we are looking to buy is about 5lbs of Jumbo Cobra Leeches that are fresh, well maintained, and packaged by the lb in bags inflated with Oxygen. Also...flats of Canadian Crawlers...one...maybe two. My understanding is you cannot bring leeches over the border anymore sooooo....want to buy them after we cross on our way during that first week of July. Thoughts?"
3857265,Tonyo,2015-05-10 16:37:00,212,We normally get a flat of crawlers from Cabela's on our way by. Never really had any issues traveling with them. They are already packed in the appropriated bedding material and we stop there anyway. Just my thoughts. Not sure on your leech request.Enjoy your trip. We leave in 3 weeks. TonyO
3857321,michigan walleye guy,2015-05-10 16:59:00,95,"Hi--If you buy leeches, you won't be able to specify the size. You'll just get them by the pound at whatever grade they happen to have, which is generally a pretty good size. But forget about getting a pound of graded jumbos. Not going to happen. I've bought minnows and leeches from Angler's Pro Shop in Nestor Falls for almost 15 years now, have always been happy with the minnows."
3857585,port1042,2015-05-10 18:24:00,509,I've been buying a half flat of crawlers from Anglers Pro for both my spring and fall trips. I've been very pleased. I have not purchased leeches or minnows. I think I've used them for 5 trips over the last few years. I place my order on-line and pick it up when I arrive on Friday afternoon.
3860577,mms3rd,2015-05-11 13:16:00,148,I have always bought the nightcrawlers by the Styrofoam carton. How many in a flat? I assume they keep well if you keep them cool? I also assume it saves money? thanks.....Mike
3860673,camp chef,2015-05-11 13:35:00,915,Approximately 500 nightcrawlers in a flat
3874505,clearis,2015-05-15 18:47:00,47,You can also pickup crawlers in I-Falls at Sportsman. I usually call ahead and reserve a flat.
3875922,KM1,2015-05-16 09:03:00,374,"are not the problem. It is the Leeches you cannot transport across the border any longer. Used to get all my bait in International Falls...Leeches too...but that was in the late 90's. Now...no Leeches across the border....so don't want to make 2 stops for bait...1 is enough. Thus...want to get the best Leeches I can and get my Flat of Crawlers along with that (500 per flat). These are the only two shops that I have heard of, that are on the way, that might meet our needs. Just wondering which is BEST...or...if there are any better. Right now...looks like Angler Pro in Nestor Falls is our best bet. Anyone else?????"
3876026,Pikeslayer8,2015-05-16 10:14:00,1460,"Kurt, Go to Rainy Lake Sports in Ft Francis. They have always provided my leeches for me and I get frozen ciscos and Cuban cigars there as well."
3876290,Lazy Fisherman,2015-05-16 13:27:00,276,"I have bought crawlers at Angler's Pro Shop in Nestor Falls several times. So far, have always been happy with what they sold me."
