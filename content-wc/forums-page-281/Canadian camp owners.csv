3772249,Blades-n-Beads,2015-04-15 20:04:00,484,"There has been recent threads lately discussing when should one take his/her children to Canada fishing, looking for input from others, my question to camp owners is has your thought changed over the years due to down turn in economy about how you market your camp or advertise/shows etc, do you rely on returning fishermen and keep in contact with them or has your thought changed over the years to encourage folks to bring there children to capture the next generation. Did you change your camp or will you change things to encourage the younger kids. I have been to some places over the years I got the feeling they did not want the young ones in camp. And a few that encouraged the younger generation. For me personally I would like to see the same camps I return to leave out the Internet, tv, radio. If I needed those amenities I'd stay home. IMO ."
3772601,Fisherman Ted,2015-04-15 21:50:00,461,"The fastest way out of business is to get an increasing share of a decreasing market. The fishing industry is shrinking and has been for sometime now. The next generation(s) are not following their forefathers into the wilderness. This is fact.The groups of 8-12 guys fishing for a week in yesteryear are now 4 guys for 5 days, or even a long weekend. Those were the bread and butter for all of us. They would book a year in advance when they left. So to answer your 1st question keeping your core group is critical in this environment. That is a base that are the underpinnings of the business. But that base is eroding. They are aging and not being replaced. For this reason a lodge needs to find new guests and be flexible and creative. In my opinion those that cannot or will not adapt to this reality will fade away in the next 10 years. There are many ways of course to attract new clients with hundreds of variations based on your existing business model, current offerings and potential to be creative. But to answer your second question, yes getting that next generation is key to the long turn survival of the industry. But that next generation has other needs, desires and wants. They need to be catered to. One cannot assume that prior success will guarantee future returns by remaining stagnant. ONE market is families. Just one. There are other markets. Many actually and again it depends on one's business model if that market is the right one to pursue. I would argue that in many cases it should be but with other market segments to target and finite resources a lodge owner has to pick their spots and tread accordingly. That being said those that do want to see families and younger ones come up need to change their practices and offer things that entice or cater to everyone. When McDonalds introduced salads it wasn't for the kids, but the moms. Keep mom happy and she will give the trip a thumbs up. Same with a lodge. Keep mom and the kids entertained and all of a sudden it is a family trip that has something for everyone. So change is inevitable. What constitutes keeping them happy? Clean accommodations usually. If there is food served then the better the better. Something for the kids to do during a rainy day. Whether that be wi-fi (and ALL guests look for some access to the out-side world, its just a fact of life), movies, game rooms, kayaks, zip-lines. I could go on and on.Sure, we will get the hard-core family that wants to fish all day long, but that is not the norm. So to attract more business you need to meet the needs of a broader population. How you define that market and how you compete with the other lodge owners that are targeting the same slice defines, or will define your success in this business. I spent a week at one of the most famous lodges in the boundary waters a few weeks ago, one that has been around for a century, Gunflint Lodge. Run by the same family. You want to hear firsthand about how the business has changed talk to Bruce Kerfoot, a legend in the industry. What his lodge started out as (outfitting fishermen in the wilderness) and what it currently has become and is are light years apart. Yes, you can still be out-fitted for trips into the bush. But you can also zip-line, dog-sled, cross country ski, have a gourmet meal, take quilting classes, be led by a naturalist on guided tours, honeymoon packages, the list goes on and on. I was blown away at how he had taken a concept and turned it into an entire vacation package for literally dozens of market segments. Did he do this because he wanted to? No, he did this in order to be successful.Times are changing. If we don't adapt we will be run over. -FT"

3772993,v-bay gord,2015-04-16 06:27:00,3168,"In our case we have always encouraged families. It probably helps when ones wife is part of making the business decisions. The days of large groups of men being the main clientele is over, but smaller groups, novice anglers, family groups, wilderness seekers, couples, etc are all still important parts of the mix. I think it is important to honor the tradition of the ""Up north Canada trip"". Solitude, wilderness, expanse of lakes, clean water, great fishing, wildlife, and reconnecting with a simpler time. Kids can still enjoy what kids enjoyed 40 years ago.......swimming, fishing, campfires etc. I won't be catering to folk who need t.v.'s in their cabins, an internet game room, jet skis or waterslides. You can find those in Wisconsin. There is a market for getting back to the basics."

3773297,Obabikon,2015-04-16 08:21:00,2370,"We have also always been a family owned and operated resort. So, we naturally encouraged families to come. The age of children drastically depends on the child. I've fished with 6 year olds who can fish all day, and still want more. I've fished with 13 year olds that 20 minutes in were ready to quit. As far as amenities go. I agree, I don't like WIFI being available. However, the fact remains that it is getting increasingly harder for people to ""unplug"". Most working class can't take an entire week off, and not be able to be contacted. Cell phones are ringing, and work emails are responded to. Also, from a business stand point, most people would rather send emails than call to discuss a trip. So, I have to constantly check the camp's account. The world is changing, and the simple days of being out of contact is disappearing."
3775113,Blades-n-Beads,2015-04-16 18:08:00,484,"My kids were over tonight for dinner so as long as they were all here I had ask for there opinions. Here are the age groups 4 of them (husband and wife's) ages 24-30. 2 more (both 19). My question to them was: if you were in charge of finding a Canadian camp for a week of vacation for fishing, what would you look for before you booked with them. Now keep in mind 3 of them ( being my kids) were all brought up with summer fishing and a yearly Canada trip. The two wife's not so much but are troppers and will try anything. Without any hesitation all 6 of them said an Internet connection was a must, tv-no, didn't matter, radio-no didn't matter, jet skis- absolutely not, water skiing-they were split on this one. Meal plan- women said yes, guys said didn't matter. ( go figure right). Drive to camp or boat in- didn't matter, large camp or small- didn't matter as long as there was privacy between cabins. Full cabin bathroom with hot water- women said absolutely, guys-didn't matter. I could have plugged them for more questions but they had to get going so we stopped there. Take your own pole with your own kids and post there list of what they would have to have and things they can do without. I'm interested in hearing others findings."
3775985,Aspencreek,2015-04-16 22:41:00,2911,"Very interesting thread, building a successful camp in todays world has to be challenging. But if you are stuck in the past the world is passing you by. It is becoming more and more evident that an internet connection is of high demand, and if they do have it they better advertise it. Marketing via a GOOD informative website is also critical. The ""All Canada"" show and others like it, are not cost effective and will also soon be a thing of the past. (Others will disagree, but sometimes facing the truth is hard).A few years ago while fishing on Lac Seul, off Manitoba Pt, my cell phone started ringing, believe me I was as surprised as anyone. Cell service is available out there. Cell service and internet is quickly rising to the top of the ""required"" list of many people (as sad as that may be) and if you are going to try and attract the younger generation it is top of the list. Television is not needed if they can text and tweet."

My grandfather used to give my dad a hard time for bringing a propane stove on fishing trips .... he said it detracted from the experience. My great grandfather used to give my grandfather a hard time for bringing an outboard motor on fishing trips .... he said it detracted from the experience.

3779985,Tonyo,2015-04-18 07:46:00,212,"I have spent the past few days reading the updates as they are posted and reflecting on my own experiences over the past 10-12 years. First off I want to say thanks to the core group we go with every year. There are 8 of us who have been going for 10-12 years. Fathers and sons, who all started our boys as young as 9 year olds. We have added another great father, 2 sons and grandson to our group that makes us 12 strong each year. We have been able to stay at the same lodge and cabin over this period of time and have watched our camp owner change with the times. First it was nicer boats and motors, next it was improved cabin interiors, next it was WiFi and the last addition was a camp social cabin with couches, tv etc. not every guest takes advantage of all of the upgrades but I know that when we are finished fishing for the day and my son, now 15 and has been with us since he was 9, enjoys his down time catching up with friends and so do the other teens and twenty year olds that are with us. Our camp owner gets the new era he is in and has changed to keep ALL guest happy. I enjoy the improvement and use them sparingly throughout the week. TonyO"
3780585,kzoofisher,2015-04-18 12:33:00,5144,"My preference is for a more rustic experience, battery lights and well at the most. I want to see very few (if any) other people, don't want to stay at the lodge at all, even if it doesn't have power. Totally understand the people who want power, meals, wifi etc. too, just a different way of doing it. I do need to know that the lodge can be reached and that they can reach me if there is an emergency back home but that's about it. I feel really bad for the people who have to check into work during vacation. The way I see it if you are the owner and your business can't run a week without you, the business is poorly run. What if you get hit by lightning? Is your business going to go under? Will your family be left in the lurch because you made poor choices with employees and they can't be trusted with the place? For the employee who is so ""indispensable"" that he has to check in, you are underpaid. By a lot. If the place can't last a few days without you then you should be the highest paid person there, higher even than the owner. At the very least you should get double time if you are on paid vacation and time and a half if you are on unpaid. I know this is a bit of a rant but people gave up their lives so that we could have time off, I hate to see that being eroded by greedy, self-centered people."

Laugh and relax!On the subject of attracting new fisherman (ie the young)- I wonder how much of a role youth sports plays in the reduced numbers. For instance, I have two friends that each have a son playing high school football. My friends would love to make the trip w their sons but the summer workout schedule is very tight. They may have enough time for a family get-away, but not for both. I do favor wifi availability. Because I know I'm not irreplaceable, I want to be there for my clients in the event they really need help. As for my two sons- thankfully they have no problem leaving the gadgets behind as they enjoy the Canadian experience as much as I do."
3797521,tv4fish,2015-04-22 10:48:00,2694,"emma: You make 2 excellent points. 1) Everybody does need to lighten up a bit and not be so easily ""offended"" - GEEZ - life is too short to be just looking for ways to complain. 2) I also think that the sports ""involvement"" with our young kids is getting too carried away. Not all of our kids are going to become professional athletes (despite what some parents think). When the kids are young, just let them learn to play ""the game"" - there should be no need to have the sport tie up that much of their life - If a kid likes a sport and really wants to pursue a sports career, he has a lot of years to do that a little later."

3798297,Draco1206,2015-04-22 13:59:00,175,"I also agree with Emma on both points. I don't agree with your 2nd point, and I don't think that is what Emma was trying to say. I took ten years off from going on our fly-in fishing trip because both of my kids were involved in sports, school and travel teams. My son was a 3 sport athlete and my daughter played 2 sports. With all of the practices, games, tournaments, etc. I just didn't have the time to go to Canada every year. Those ten years were some of the best years of my life. Following my kids around and watching them compete and learn valuable lessons like teamwork, sacrifice, losing, winning, and sportsmanship was priceless, and I wouldn't have given it up for anything in the world. I bonded with my kids during those years and it brought us closer together. I got them outdoors and ""up north"" as much as I could to keep them grounded during those years, but not as much as I would have liked. You have to do what your kids like, whether it's cheer leading, band, or sports. Not what you want them to do. One thing I always told my kids is that there will be a time when you can't play team sports like football, basketball, baseball, softball, so do it now while you can and when that time comes that you can't play those sports anymore there will be plenty of time left to go hunting and fishing."
3875930,wisdom,2015-05-16 09:03:00,27,"My two cents. Personally I go to northern Quebec because I like the wilderness adventure, the pristine beauty of the land, water and sunsetsand the ability to catch and release all the fish you want. It is a place to search your soul with out the distractions of wyfi, cell phones and TV. As a fisherman and lover of the simple things in life I want to teach my sons and grand sons to appreciate them. So yes I say take your wife and kids fishing. May they see your passion and love for the wilderness and perhaps the cell phones, wyfi and TV wont be as important as catching and cleaning fish for supper and giving thanks for a great day watching the sun set and hearing a loons lonely call. God I miss that place"

And for years my work had me strapped down thinking no one can run them as good as me so I have to be here to do that. One day an older gentleman asked me to go fishing and I said I would love to but I am to busy. He patiently listened as I gave him a grocery list of all my responsibilities and reasons I could not go fishing. I will never forget his reply. He said if you die today tomorrow another will step up and fill your shoes and if not what will it matter. For years I pondered his words and at 50 I knew what he was talking about. Now I work to live not live to work. I'm spending my kids inheritance.

It is more about respect for the people I work with. We don't all do the same things. Or, what if the day I leave a new prospective customer inquires? As the owner I am the one that deals with those things. I don't want them being ignored for 7 or 8 days. I work with my staff to open the dialogue with that customer to find out what they are looking for. Point being, everyone is different. What works for one may not work for the other and vice versa.

There is absolutely no doubt that the resort owners are going to have to ""get with the times"" and at least offer modern amenities to keep the interest of families. The electronic age is here for all of us, but especially for our kids. They are ""growing up"" using these devices. If most of them think that they are going to be ""without"" the use of their Iphone/Ipad or what-have-you for a week, they are not going to want to go to your resort. They will either insist that Dad/Mom find one that DOES or the kid(s) will insist on staying home. While we adults may want to ""get away"" from our electronic devices by escaping for a week of solitude in Canada, I don't think our kids think/feel the same way."

What has brought me more business than everything else combined is having a full service website (book and pay on-line etc) and the ability to instantly respond to emails. With text alerts, I respond to all electronic inquiries within 30 minutes or less, 24 hours a day 7 days a week. I've had numerous guests tell me they chose my cabin simply because I responded first. I never even speak with the vast majority of guests prior to their visit. It's all emails. As a business owner, I'd be a fool not to use the internet and social media to the fullest extent for marketing and communications. When it comes to what amenities are offered on-site to the guests ..... each camp owner has to decide what kind of experience they want to offer. Just about anything can be successful ... as long as you can find a target market and market your services effectively. This is just my opinion, but regardless of what type of camp you have, offering wifi (if possible) can only be good for business."

Having this ability enables us to STAY LONGER and feel safer then we did when we couldn't communicate anyone while out on the lake or with relatives back home. Wifi is a plus for all those that still work when even on vacation. And they can STAY LONGER. So all this said our kids are now coming to Canada and if there wasn't wifi/cell phones/and TV.....they wouldn't come. Thats just the way it is. This generation will not be separated from there technology so if a camp owner can't roll with it.......then you will suffer. As for TV..........I think it is catching on!"
3774425,michigan walleye guy,2015-04-16 15:14:00,95,"Gunflint Lodge, referred to in the original reply to this thread, was my first destination when I decided I wanted to explore the boundary waters area. They offered a 3-day guided fishing package plus meals and lodging for under $500 back in 2000, when I first went up there. I started taking my wife and kids shortly thereafter, and they fell in love with the place, to the point where the first week after the 4th of July is reserved for our family vacation. There is something for everybody: the kids get to horseback ride, there is a nice beach, there are countless naturalist activities for the kids to sign up for, and the food is incredible. And I get to fish the 8-5 shift (at least 3 of the 7 days) for the huge walleyes and numerous lake trout that reside in Gunflint and North Lake, using the lodge boats and gas. Pricey, yes. Definitely so. But I would rather go to Gunflint for a week than to Wisconsin Dells or even Disneyworld anyday. And so would my kids, who are all now teenagers, but look forward to this week the same way they did when they were around 5 years old. Bruce and Sue have gone out of their way to change with the times. I know they do have a ""rainbow"" weekend, marketed towards people of alternative lifestyles. Don't know how successful that was.

But yes the younger generation should all have the opportunity at least once to exsperiance a great Canadian fishing trip, after that let them decide if they want to return. And I'm betting the majority would go on a drop of a hat. Thanks guys"

To the OP: I guess I don't understand the need to eliminate the TV, internet or radio? Just because it is available doesn't mean you have to utilize it. Just don't bring your devices. If YOU like it old school, so be it. But, remember not everyone does. I would also venture to guess you pick and choose what parts of old school you stick to? Do you use nice rods and reels? Electronics? GPS? Indoor toilets? The ONLY difference is where an individual chooses to draw the line. Some look at technology and the woods as a negative. Last year I took my 9 year old on his first trip to Hawk Lake. As soon as we booked we watched their facebook page and every time he saw those fish pictures posted he got more and more excited. Those pictures never got posted to regular websites with any regularity. They do with facebook because it is a much easier process. Whether it be Ted or his staff or his guests posting. I took along an ipad and a nintendo DS for my son last year because I had no idea how he would react to his first trip. Tons of DVDs in the truck. The whole trip up and back he probably watched 2 movies total. He used his ipad once or twice while we were there. I pretty much had to pull him off the dock to go to bed or he would have been casting off that dock all night long. Point being, just because it is there doesn't mean it is a crutch and that is all that people use. Everything is a balance. So, if using his ipad and texting his Mom or calling home, facebooking pictures from our trip while we are there gets him hooked on fishing Canada..............so be it. That is fine with me. That trip and the upcoming trip has been great incentive to do well in school this past year too."

But parents are using electronics, including everything from GPS to sonar to radar to cell phones and everything else, so it's not just the kids. I suspect that the lodge business has been evolving ever since it started. Some of the first lodges, those started by the railroads, were more of a luxury resort destination than they were a fishing camp, so in some sense camps are going back to where they started. Perhaps the biggest challenge is to have a place which is affordable but also provides nonfishing activities and more than the most spartan accomadations. And being able to have activities and a season longer than May to September would be helpful."

It has to be in a certain area for it to work. So, typically call and check in every few days. My brothers high school age son was with us and he was on his phone quite often. Well, my wife went on twitter and tweeted him to let him know I needed to call home because my 4 year old was in the hospital. As soon as my boat pulled into the dock they ran down and grabbed my stuff so I could run up and make the call. Without phones, internet or wifi I'm not sure I would have found out. Especially back in the day when we flew in."
