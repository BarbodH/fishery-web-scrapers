3881833,Blackmacs,2015-05-18 12:16:00,2121,"Be ready for construction on US 53 north of Orr to International Falls. The road is tore up in spots and in pretty bad shape. When it says bump it means BUMP! And 3"" of rain in the last week doesn't help."
3881841,dutchboy,2015-05-18 12:23:00,5717,Thanks for the heads up. Is this resurfacing or making it 4 lane?
3881985,Blackmacs,2015-05-18 12:43:00,2121,"Mainly resurfacing, turn lanes and culvert replacement. They are also going to try and fix that slide area near Ash Lake for the 1000th time. Some of the areas they have removed the asphalt down to the road bed. It's very rough. Enough to shake the your fillings out."
3883505,P&y only,2015-05-18 18:33:00,133,would 169 be a better choice then? MapQuest says an extra 20 minutes. But if you gotta slow down a lot that might pay off. Any suggestions?
3883537,dutchboy,2015-05-18 18:35:00,5717,Where you going? 169 flares east just north of Hibbing towards Ely. The construction won't effect that trip at all.
3883649,P&y only,2015-05-18 18:52:00,133,from Minneapolis to international falls. MapQuest says its one more mile and 20 more minutes. But if 53 is all messed up that might be a better way.
3884009,dutchboy,2015-05-18 19:45:00,5717,Nope 53 is very good until the construction which is far North of where 169 comes in. Take 35 north to cloquet and take 33 to 53 and go.
3884577,P&y only,2015-05-19 04:58:00,133,Thanks! That's my normal route to the border. I'll just stay on it and slow down for the bumps.
