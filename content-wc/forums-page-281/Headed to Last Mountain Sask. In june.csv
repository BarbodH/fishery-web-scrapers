He told me for walleye at that time to use the same shallow running crank baits we will be using for pike. Husky jerks in silver, gold, perch, and firetiger. He also suggested spinner rigs behind 1-1 1/2 oz bottom bouncers. The other suggestion he had is slip bobbering. The walleye will be in shallow water. The marina just opened up today so it should be easier to get a hold of them on the phone. Hope this helps, Chris"
