3858585,canyon,2015-05-11 05:59:00,37,I see nothing but cloud over Gouin on May 10 imagery. I am sure the ice is gone but I don't see how you can tell. ( Of course I have no clue where Lake Herbert is...lol. I know it is not part of the reservoir system.)
3858785,octanehi5,2015-05-11 07:02:00,1104,"Hebert is visable in one of the pics., I stay in contact with my outfitter about the gouin its ice out. Hebert is 40 miles northwest of the Gouin. Those who booked opening week will be able to go. My crew is 40 days out of flyin to Hebert Prime time."
3858817,Freytown,2015-05-11 07:10:00,770,"Hi Ron, I asked for link because all I see is clouds too. But you're right the ice is gone. About 28 days for me...torture time, lol. FT"

3834249,tackleman,2015-05-03 10:33:00,444,ice went out yesterday on south bay of gullrock
3836033,octanehi5,2015-05-04 05:07:00,1104,"Ice out is progressing very quickly now, My prediction of on or before the 10th is spot on"
3837921,Freytown,2015-05-04 15:59:00,770,"Ron, I hope you're right...the early birds are going to find a light walleye bite but the pike should be good. I do know that this year the ice was thicker. I'm trying to find out about the Gouin water levels also, some pics looks like a low level. Back in 2003 spring, the Gouin was down 20ft in the spring. Heavy electric use due to a very cold winter that year was the culprit. Low water does shorten the search area...as long as you can reach all the locations. FT"

3832185,pjshorthorn,2015-05-02 08:34:00,5654,"With your luck I would plan ahead.. Cabelas has their camp commode chair on sale. Just set it up inside the cabin.

3832529,canyon,2015-05-02 12:31:00,37,I think you are spot on with your prediction. Looking at the sat pics today there is open water near the dam for sure and looks like possible open areas else where. I was way off by saying closer to the 20th.
3832537,v-bay gord,2015-05-02 12:33:00,3168,You're only renting the cabin....why do you need a bucket?
3832649,wallydave,2015-05-02 15:20:00,2151,You might need the bucket for the boat!
3832769,bkw67,2015-05-02 16:24:00,70,Just got a report that the ice is moving out on Eva lake.
3833625,pjshorthorn,2015-05-03 07:23:00,5654,"To your point,since the ice is out you won't mind if I borrow an ice auger with an extension would you? Drill a hole through the cabin floor, set up chair, presto..........problem solved and probable crisis averted. PjShorthorn."

3825289,Guest,2015-04-29 16:36:00,0,I have been using the Hidden Bay Lodge site for a couple years of to watch the ice melt away. They post pictures of Lakes in Sioux Lookout and LOW.http://www.hiddenbay.com/icewatch.html
3829345,v-bay gord,2015-05-01 06:47:00,3168,"Congratulations to PJ Shorthorn for being the ""Ice Out Winner"" for the coveted Vermilion Bay championship! Ice has officially departed the scene as of May 1, 2015. http://www.electricbeaver.ca/fishing...-are-outraged/"
3829377,larry0418,2015-05-01 07:04:00,16,"In case no one has posted this site, for you guys that like to watch for the ice out, go to this website. It will show you areas as far as just north of Sturgeon Lake and as of today, Sturgeon and Nipigon are still ice covered. If you zoom in you can pick out many more lakes. Its cool info.http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/ Im heading to Nungesser 5/29 and I think its still ice covered."

3805257,canyon,2015-04-24 06:04:00,37,Hopefully you boat in but last year around our outfitter the ice didn't come out until around May 20th. Hoping this year with less snow you will be good. We head up on the 23rd.
3807041,octanehi5,2015-04-24 14:47:00,1104,it will be ice out on the gouin by the opener
3807241,Freytown,2015-04-24 16:00:00,770,Ice gone by the May15th will be iffy this spring. I'd be more concerned with a good walleye bite on the Gouin for the opener. All spawning areas are off limits until May30th. Good luck anyway.
3807665,port1042,2015-04-24 18:51:00,509,"Any information on the ice conditions/predictions for the Perrault Falls area? I'll be heading that way on May 23rd and I'm sure it will be gone, just wondering how soon. Thanks!"
3808617,canyon,2015-04-25 07:50:00,37,I'm with Freytown. May 15th is going to be close. I am leaning more towards the same as last year (around the 20-22). If you look at the forecasted temps compared to last year they are lower and the amount of snow still on the ground in southern Quebec still leads me to think it will be later. I know LOTW is almost ice free now but that is about 650 miles as the crow flies to the west. To offer some perspective I am about 500 miles east of Gouin and we are going to be at least a month behind on ice out. Of course we go through this every year and no one really knows. Just hope everyone's trip is the best they have had to date!
3810225,octanehi5,2015-04-25 17:59:00,1104,"With the next 14 day outlook at temps in Quebec, I'm going to stick my neck out and say the ice will be gone on the gouin by or before the 10th of May, 10 days before last yr."
3821457,octanehi5,2015-04-28 15:03:00,1104,"almost all the snow pac is gone, I stick to my prediction no ice on the gouin by the 10th, its going to be close"
3821529,octanehi5,2015-04-28 15:17:00,1104,"if you check satelite pics from a week ago ,compared to today. not such a bright white any more"

3768473,Freytown,2015-04-15 06:25:00,770,"I wish you are right Ron, but I think this year may be later than last year. The locals on the Gouin are esti May 15 (earliest) but May 20 more likely. Not a good year for the early birds in the Clova area."

I like using the True Color Terra which is an actual photo and also the 3-6-7 Terra as the red in the photo is the ice cover on the bodies of water (both 250m). I use this to look at the Gouin but if you want to look at other areas click on the "" Return to Aeronet"" title and look for the area you want( warning this map is very busy with lots of areas to view so some patience is required to find your area). Hope this helps!"

Last year on May 5 we still had 20"" with no water so I would say we are well ahead of last year. Last years ice out on Cordingley was May 19."
3771401,ftfarms,2015-04-15 17:40:00,444,Just looked at the web cam at red wing lodge in morson Ontario and there's a lot of open water showing up. Won't be long on lake of the woods in that area.
