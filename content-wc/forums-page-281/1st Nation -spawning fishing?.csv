3869305,MrSimon,2015-05-14 09:01:00,922,"I don't live up there so I don't know the details like a lot of you. But this is how I see it. If a native family is living off the land in order to feed themselves (subsistence living) then I don't have a problem with them being outside the laws. If they are selling their catch or using it for anything other than feeding themselves and their direct family, then I'd consider that commercial fishing and they should abide by all the related laws."
3869489,deadhead1,2015-05-14 10:08:00,193,"I know of a situation in Manitoba a few years back where they came right into a small rural town and set nets across the river using a local park for access to the river. Why would they go out in the bush when the white man was so nice as to clear a nice spot for camping and a nice parking lot to park their 4 wheel drive trucks. That went on for a few years but If I remember correctly, The DNR found a way to stop it."
3871193,pale ryder,2015-05-14 18:56:00,1937,Nothing good can come from having different laws for people based on race or how long ago your ancestors moved there.
3871281,Rock Lobstar1,2015-05-14 19:14:00,134,"This happened on a town I used to live in, in B.C. Except not right in town, just outside. The CO's couldn't do anything about it and weren't happy about it so they went a few kilometres upstream and accidentally threw some hay bales into the river. Never saw nets across the river there again."
3865881,Freytown,2015-05-13 05:20:00,770,"http://translate.google.com/translat...xD8Xe77EvqgovgView in ""Parlor - Fishing Under High Voltage For Aboriginals"" This link is too an issue in Quebec. As a non-resident I can only watch but I believe all residents should be on the same page. Quotas/limits exists to protect the resource but now in 2015 the 1st nations get a pass over all the other native born residents. I don't get it."
3866097,bigwillies,2015-05-13 06:39:00,515,"it is the same in ontario too.a freind of mine seen some natives in a sanctuary that flowed into eagle lake doing the same thing this year.he took a couple pics and posted them on facebook saying what a bunch of b.s. it was.lets just say he got quite a few replies(along with a few threats).they said the same thing ""we live of the land"".i guess if living off the land includes walmart and kfc they sure are."
3866321,youngknight,2015-05-13 07:59:00,228,"As someone who works in Ontario in the resource industry, I can tell you that these issues are complex and Joe Q. Public sportsman has no say or influence in the matter...not even that much a political issue...these types of things have been challenged at the Supreme Court level and 98% of the time the courts side with the natives...end of story. However, many First Nation communities want to be more conservation minded yet their self government, self enforcement of community wishes seldom follows through to stop the individuals from doing things counter to good conservation. Simply put , community leaders need to take a firm stance against such practices. There are of course communities that have no objection to these things. On one hand these people want all the luxuries of the modern world...TV, health care, movies, atvs, automobiles, electricity, .etc etc but they dont want to accept that the modern world benefits come at a cost...such as natural resources cannot handle practices that WERE sustainable 200 years ago."
3866401,Freytown,2015-05-13 08:20:00,770,What would the 1st Nations think if the DNR let everyone fish during the spawn and no seasons and no quotas. ?????
3866441,Obabikon,2015-05-13 08:34:00,2370,"This is a very interesting topic, and one that I understand both sides. I would like to see First Nations come together and agree to not fish during spawning. Since they are not hampered by limits, they could catch some extra fish prior to the spawn, and save enough to last a month or so. However, is there a difference in pulling a fish out right before the spawn and pulling one out during the spawn? Same result... no baby fish. However, often the ice is just coming off the lake, and timing could affect that. I personally don't think it should be the Government's position to prevent anyone from living off the land, especially natives. It should be the Government's job to prevent waste or damage to the industry. Anyhow... its a good topic, and it isn't (in my opinion) one that is black and white."
3866801,hunter651,2015-05-13 10:46:00,28,"Pretty sad the canadian gov still let this BS happen, there is a reason the season is shut down for a month, let the fish do there thing, nets all winter snarring in the spring, and trust me it more the just ont it's all over sask to, never mind the hunting..... Wake up Can gov and do something"
3867457,Curryale,2015-05-13 15:19:00,50,I understand that a high proportion of fish harvested via net or spear on a lake like Nippising are consumed in the general local area. One way to discourage this kind of behaviour would be for the public to refuse to purchase walleye and restaurants or supermarkets. If nobody is buying it then it is likely not worth netting.
3867529,dutchboy,2015-05-13 16:38:00,5717,"As a Minnesotan we have our hands full with Mille Lacs and many other tribal waters being abused. Good luck with the first nations, I'm sure they aren't any different then the Fond-Du-Lac and others south of the border."
3867721,youngknight,2015-05-13 18:15:00,228,"Hunter, again...not really a Cdn gov problem...instead it is a Supreme Court issue. The comment about pre spawn vs spawn ""fishing""...true, no baby fish...the difference would be the congregations or lack thereof between the two so the number of fish taken."
3869121,fishman10,2015-05-14 08:41:00,226,"I live in northwestern ontario and see the carnage first hand. I agree that natives have the right to live off the land, and be able to feed themselves as they have for generations. But I do not agree with them decimating a fishery or resource. They have no right to do this. They never had the tools or equipment to do this in the past. The would take enough to eat in the past. Now they have trucks, boats motors, nts etc. all the tools to decimate a fishery. Instead of taking enough to eat, now it's a truck load of walleye. And they love to shove it in whiteys faces. I personally know natives who will tell me that they are over the top now. They are no longer keepers of the land."
