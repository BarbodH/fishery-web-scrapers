Now i will have to see if there are openings.If anyone else has a suggestion, I would love to hear them. I will start with cedar lake since a few suggestions were to go to that lake, I've driven by cedar for years and heard good things about it. Thanks again,Scot"
3868481,Baseline,2015-05-14 05:32:00,3207,Try (Ed) Taylors Cove located on Rainy. Its 25 miles east of Fort Francis. Located on Bear Passage it is located between Swell and Red Gut Bays. This is a prime time for walleye and pike fishing in the Red Gut area. Smallmouth will be all over especially in Swell. Crappies are also available. Lots of other accessible water to keep you busy for a week. Cabins are very nice and resort is very private. Taylor's should have a cabin or two because the resort doesn't get busy until June when the smallmouth season gets rolling. A real plus is that it saves a lot of driving. Canadian Rainy is a regular stop for me over the Memorial Day weekend.
3874481,clearis,2015-05-15 18:44:00,47,"I was thinking of Rainy and Red Gut. Great fishing and goods and services nearby. The smallies might be in shallow end of May if weather is warm next two weeks. A week ago, Rainy was down about three feet."
3865425,Scot,2015-05-12 19:44:00,8,"My girlfriend and I are looking to go up to Canada through International Falls to go on her first canada fishing trip May31st. She is quite a fisherwoman, loves to cast, and not afriad to put in the hours. I was looking for a camp that is near a town(for bad weather days), that offers good action for walleye, pike, and maybe small mouth bass. I dont feel like dragging my boat up this time. I'd like a clean camp,nice boats, on a lake that isnt too tough to figure out. Probably a stained water lake so daytime fishing is a little easier.I have been on Eagle Lake (to big), Nungesser (too far, too remote and pricy) Gull Rock(a little too far), Canyon lake(not going back). Please help with some suggestions please,Scot"

3866129,prov1800,2015-05-13 06:50:00,5010,I could suggest a lot of places.but your best bet might be cedar lake.small enough and easier to fish.lots of places to hide depending on wind and good fishing that time of year.check out clarks northern lights resort.good boats and free bait.cant go wrong.
3866169,wallydave,2015-05-13 07:10:00,2151,"You might have a difficult time finding any openings this late in the game. Most places fill up early, still the number of fishermen and women has declined in recent years. Good luck!"
3866385,prov1800,2015-05-13 08:13:00,5010,Try clarkes northern lights resort on cedar lake.good fishing most of the time and small enough (17 mi) to get out of any bad weather.good 17 ft boats and all the bait you need.cant go wrong.
3866425,Redline,2015-05-13 08:24:00,73,"Try Sioux Narrows. We always stay at White Birch Lodge. Been going for 25 years and the new owners have done a great job updating it. They don't have rental boats though, you'd have to go with one of their guides if you don't bring your own boat. Just down the road is Tomahawk. I haven't stayed there, but I have rented boats from them. They have awesome boats. You could give them a call as well. I know White Birch does a $95/night plan that includes breakfast and dinner, plus lodging. You could do that then rent a boat from Tomahawk. Just a suggestion."
3866529,clippertripper,2015-05-13 09:01:00,2,Check out Sleepydogcabins in Perrault Falls and the nearby WhiskeyJack Restaurant for dining and entertainment.
3866857,larry0418,2015-05-13 10:56:00,16,"Route Lake Lodge is a nice place with some excellent portage lakes Glen takes you into. Route lake has good walleyes and northern plus lakers if interested, and the cabins are really nice. Great privacy between cabins, a nice lodge and grounds, but you need to be picked up and boated up to the resort. Its about a 20 minute boat ride. its located about 30 minutes north of Dryden. I cant say enough about the resort facilities. We stayed a few years ago, but always go to a different place each year. Glen and Shirley will always be ranked high on our list. Good luck."
3866929,bigwalleye1,2015-05-13 11:32:00,2632,"Could try Frog Rapids Camp. Between Pelican and Abrams lakes, boats and motors available for rent, Sioux Lookout is a couple miles up the road. Clean cabins with all amenities. I've been going there for 15 plus years."
3867073,ftfarms,2015-05-13 12:12:00,444,I would agree with Pro v 1800. Cedar lake is one of my favorite smaller lakes. We stay at cedar point resort. It's right in the middle of the lake. Good luck and god bless.
