3875177,Kartman35,2015-05-16 00:55:00,245,"Kinda depends on what you're pulling, how fast you're going and how deep you're fishing...I use whatever gives me a bit more than a 45 degree angle (slightly steeper). Not much help I guess..."

Once you have located them in lets say 14' of water you may cut back on the weights. Its like drifting and jigging, need to stay in contact with the bottom. Back trolling works well on Hebert ,giving they have 20 hp mercs can be a little fast for reg trolling"
