3871657,ftfarms,2015-05-14 20:51:00,444,Does anyone know if there's a grocery store from crossing at Baudett Mn heading to morson Ontario Might need to get some eggs and chicken breasts. And maybe a bait shop to get some leeches? Thanks for any help.
3871713,johnboat,2015-05-14 21:25:00,2014,You're good. There's one about 200 yards south of the border. Nice one too. I have never been able to get out of there without one of their fresh made pizzas. :/
3871793,johnboat,2015-05-14 22:22:00,2014,"But for eggs and chicken, last I heard there was a food store recently built on the way into Morson. Plus I'm sure Mylie's would have them."
3871801,ftfarms,2015-05-14 22:34:00,444,We where up there last june there was talk about a store going up Just hadn't heard if it went up or not. Thanks.
3872001,gowrlop,2015-05-15 05:36:00,109,There's a grocery store on the east side of Rainy River. Last Oct the store in Morson wasn't open yet.
3872017,Obabikon,2015-05-15 05:50:00,2370,You can't buy eggs in Baudette and cross. You need to stop at Beaver Mills in Rainy River. They'll have chicken and eggs... but no leeches! It'll be on your right hand side as you are about to leave the town. (maybe 1-2 miles from the border) The store in Morson is not open yet.
3872241,ftfarms,2015-05-15 06:22:00,444,Thanks Jared. Just didn't want to go threw Fort Francis for eggs and chicken. I was hoping to get it in rainy river but couldn't remember if there was a store there. I do remember the beer store though.
3872745,Obabikon,2015-05-15 08:32:00,2370,"Beaver Mills is a little pricey, but in the big scheme of things... who cares. The store in Morson (I heard) will be opening in the next few days. We'll see... I'll update everyone win I see the OPEN sign and people inside!"
