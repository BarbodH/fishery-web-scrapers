Been there and have achieved everything I need as far as maps, info, etc. I just thought it would be interesting who was returning this year.Many of the post on Pringle are dated but I still got responses. It'll be fun to compare notes and dates for 2015 before the day of the fly in approaches us.Take care Jeff"

3872977,Curryale,2015-05-15 09:38:00,50,This was the first lake we ever flew into. At that time twin lakes had it and we flew in with Bill Pocock who was from my hometown in southern Ontario. I think it was 1986 or 1987 that we flew in. Fishing was outstanding!
