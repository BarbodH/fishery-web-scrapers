That place was great! The owners Anna & Zenon are great hosts! We will be staying at Mystic Isle instead. I've heard and read good things about it. Our best meal ever in Wawa was at Kinniwabi Pines. It was definelty not what we expected to find on the out-skirts of Wawa. If I remember right we had Chicken curry, Rouladen, and a stir fry. Also a nice wine selection from the Niagra region. Service is extremely slow but we were in no rush. Like others have mentioned the Embassy has a good breakfast."
3864921,Old Timer,2015-05-12 16:40:00,255,"I'm a two-daughter dad too. I've taken them to Canada quite a few times and one thing I learned over many years is to stay flexible and do what they want to do. Besides good dining, sightseeing and fishing, I make sure they get their fill of the gift and trinket stores along the way. They may not buy, but they like to look and sniff around. I haven't met a girl yet that doesn't like a little shopping here and there."
3865441,mistersixx,2015-05-12 19:50:00,9,I'm from the soo and have been to wawa countless numbers of times so if you're have any questions about the soo and surrounding areas your welcome to shoot me a pm and I'll try to help the best I can.
3867769,pitbull,2015-05-13 19:03:00,45,"I can recommend the Parkway Motel approximately 2 mi. south of Wawa, we have stayed there numerous times, Super Clean, Comfortable, Price is right, the Owners are very nice, sets back off of highway so is quite. Plan on staying there again in Aug."
3868153,youngknight,2015-05-13 21:38:00,228,"In the Soo (not), there is the bush plane museum which is very well done and perhaps would be a primer to mount excitement for the fly in....girls would probably love it too.lol. Just south of wayward a few minutes on west side of hwy there is a short hiking trail to waterfalls...never been there myself but plan on it with my son on way to our trip this summer. On the drive from the Soo to wayward you drive through Lake Superior provincial park...one of my most favourite places in Ontario...short hikes up beside river Rapids, gorgeous views over Batchawana Bay and pull over spots on the shore with millions of smooth different coloured rocks...perfect for kids to search through and many to skip. Lastly, you will of course have to stop for the obligatory picture taking beside the wayward giant goose. Have fun with your girls."
3868161,youngknight,2015-05-13 21:39:00,228,..Soo (Ontario)...typo on the (not)
3868169,youngknight,2015-05-13 21:41:00,228,Darn autocorrect...Wawa not wayward...argh
3868233,forgop,2015-05-13 22:49:00,880,"Also have a son, but not sure he'll ever be going with me. He has autism and needs far more structure and such, so it's probably just best to have him stay home with wifey. They have far too much clutter as it is, so I don't need any more of it in the house. I figure we'll fish as much as they want to be in the boat and if they want a break, I'll take them back, let them watch a movie on their iPad or whatever, and they can always call me on the 2 way radio when they want to go back out. LOL"
3868297,forgop,2015-05-13 23:12:00,880,"I thought about the museum, but think I'll pass on it. I'd rather get on the road a bit earlier and spend a couple extra hours checking out the sites at the Lake Superior Provincial Park. Definitely will be on my list for another time though. They'll each get a chance to sit in the front seat when we go on the flight. As far as the goose goes, I'd rather shoot them. We've proven with all of the retention ponds on how to make those rats with wings thrive."
3862609,forgop,2015-05-12 02:20:00,880,"I'm taking both of my daughters to a fly-in trip to Dave Lake through Air Dale/Parks/ontariowilderness.com. Our week is June 13-20 and the girls are 10 and 12 years old. They both love fishing in the pond behind our house for largemouth, so they're in for a shock when they actually get to fish in a boat for the first time. Anyway, my plan was to go up a couple of days early and hit some sites. I'm planning on leaving June 10th and making ~ 10 hour drive and getting a hotel near Paradise, MI so we can hit up Tahquamenon Falls State Park for the day Thursday. We'll make the drive across the border to stay the night in Sault Ste Marie and leave in the morning to hit up the Lake Superior Provincial Park. I plan to hit up the trails for a few hours and then plan on being in Wawa by 4pm to check in to our room there. Reviews for Best Northern Restaurant make it sound like a good place for dinner but I'm certain to get a pizza from AJ's located in the Lakeview Motel to take to the cabin with us. Either that pizza is outstanding in the first place or the taste was that much better after our week out last year. It seems as though Brown's is pretty popular for fish for a meal when we get to town, but does anyone have any must-haves for food or whatever between Indy and Wawa via Sault Ste Marie? Just trying to find some cool sites for the girls to see and do before we fly out Saturday."
3862625,Mike Borger,2015-05-12 03:40:00,1554,"You guys will have a blast Duane! I've stayed in Wawa many times. In town the best food is at Tim Hortons and Subway. For dinner the Kinniwabi Pines on 17 a mile or 2 south of town is the place to eat, trust me on that. They're known for their schnitzel, but the menu is pretty extensive. Make sure you make time to check out Young's general store in Wawa. It's a bit of a tourist trap but pretty cool nonetheless."
3862633,Mike Borger,2015-05-12 03:44:00,1554,"It's also worth mentioning, the best motel by far in my experience is the Mystic Isle also right on 17 about a mile south of town. Really nice rooms. Most of the motels in town are gross. The Wawa Motor Inn isn't bad, especially the log chalets they rent out, but that's only really an option for large groups."
3862641,forgop,2015-05-12 03:46:00,880,I'm pretty meh on Hortons. I recommend you try AJ's for pizza before you head out one of your trips this year. Jenn highly recommended it at the Hawk Air base and it hit the spot on our way home. We stopped at Youngs last year. Picked up our licenses and a flat of worms I reserved for $70 there.Will look at kinniwabi pines for sure.
3862745,Bstar,2015-05-12 05:28:00,564,My wife and I flew into Esnagami Wilderness Lodge a couple of years ago and we spent a night in Wawa. I highly recommend High Falls Motel. Very clean with modern bathrooms and kitchenettes. Very reasonably priced too. Anna the owner is very accomadating. Check out their Tripadvisor reviews. www.highfallsmotel.com. We ate the Great Northern restaurant and I have to say it was average at best. The Embassy restaurant in town has a very good breakfast. You should consider taking 31 along Lake Michigan and spending a little time in the Sleeping Bear Dunes area. We spent a night in Suttons Bay just north of Traverse City. It's a great area with a lot to see and do. We drove up to Wawa the next day taking 31 along the East arm of Traverse bay. Beautiful scenery and not that long of a drive to Wawa.
3862753,buckeyedan,2015-05-12 05:32:00,44,"We did the Soo Locks boat tour a couple years ago, and I thought it was very well done and very interesting. If you think your daughters would be at all interested in the history and engineering aspects of the locks, you might consider taking a couple hours and doing that. If not the boat tour, then just stopping by the observation deck at the locks could be fun if there is a laker locking through. We've eaten at ""The Antlers"" in SSM. Food is nothing spectacular, but the decor is unique and fun. Young's general store in Wawa is where we get our bait and licenses, so we stop there every year. It's a fun place to browse around and maybe grab a couple souvenirs. It sounds like you've made the drive before, so you know how gorgeous HWY 17 is between SSM and Wawa. When I was a kid we always used to stop at the Sand river turnout and stretch our legs. There is a beautiful waterfall on one side of the road and a very nice sandy beach on the lake side. Nothing particularly special about it, but just a fun memory I have from my childhood. Old Woman Bay just south of Wawa is awesome as well. Hope you have a great trip!"
3863169,MrSimon,2015-05-12 07:15:00,922,"Stopping at that Subway is a tradition for us. Also a tradition is somebody forgetting where they are and ordering their sandwich with American cheese .... we never learn. Anyway, the food is always fine. And I agree, stopping at the General Store is always fun - but getting your license there can sometimes mean waiting in line for a LONG time. We lost hours there once year."
3863233,SinOrSwim,2015-05-12 07:20:00,1528,Hopefully none of them have multiple detentions..........ore they might get denied. Kidding.
3864289,Krisco,2015-05-12 12:10:00,12,"I will 2nd the Embassy for breakfast in the morning, you know its a good place when the OPP's finest are filling their bellies, great owner as well who loves to talk fishing. We have stayed in the chalets at the Wawa Motor Inn for years, great place for a group, lots of socializing at the picnic tables in the evening with other groups as we all talk about what camps we are headed in to. Just a great way to spend the last night before the much anticipated trip!"
3864521,Lovetofish,2015-05-12 13:38:00,458,"You'll have a great time and your girls will not forget the trip. We too have a pizza tradition on our family trip. We stop in Grand Marais on our way home for Sven & Ole's. Some years we stay the night in town and other years get take out and continue on home. After a week of eating fish, pizza hits the spot. Have a good trip."
