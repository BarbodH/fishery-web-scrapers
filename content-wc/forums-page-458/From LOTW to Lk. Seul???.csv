1371869,KTroller,2011-12-09 12:22:00,237,"Definitely can fish it with that boat - assuming it's aluminum it will be close to, if not ideal. It will make any long jaunts much easier than with a smaller rig. KT"
1372172,Rgate,2011-12-10 19:02:00,14,"I'll stick up for Lake of the Woods - but you should be in Morson - only 7.5 miles to Miles Bay, 9 miles to Dawson, 12 miles to Rubber Island, 8 miles to Obabikon, 10 miles to the west side of Painted Rock and 14 miles to Pony Island and only 3.5 to Rabbit Point. I've had 100 walleye days and the muskie fishing isn't too shabby either."
1372201,v-bay gord,2011-12-10 21:42:00,3168,"Seems to me the bigger the boat you have, the further you ""need"" to go to catch fish. Human nature I suppose, but very true."
1372338,Ia Walihntr,2011-12-11 15:25:00,320,I agree with Richard on the Morson area. That part of Lake of the Woods has some of the most fertile water of the lake. With the right conditions (west wind) some of the windswept shorelines close to Richards' home easily produce 100 fish days.
1372364,Slushfish,2011-12-11 18:12:00,263,"I really appreciate the input guys. There's no doubt, we love everything about LOTW,but I need to find more or bigger fish to justify going back. We have really good fishing alot closer to us. I believe that there is some super fishing there that we haven't tapped into. I think we're gonna have to give it at least one more year. slushfish"
1371066,Slushfish,2011-12-06 19:13:00,263,"I know there are pages and pages and pages on Seul but here's the deal. Been taking the family(wife & two young boys) to LOW for three years. We always catch fish, but its got to the point that we almost do more musky than eye fishing now. Last yr we stayed 14 days and by the end of the trip we were boating 25-30 mi. one way to get eyes. Love the place we stay but, I want the best fishing we can get. Without getting too indepth, where would you go??? Looking for some seasoned input. Thanks everyone, slushfish"
1371084,Ia Walihntr,2011-12-06 20:12:00,320,Do you stay on Whitefish Bay and boat up to Yellowgirl Bay for your walleyes?
1371093,Steve of Madison,2011-12-06 20:39:00,230,you have a private message
1371175,wallydave,2011-12-07 07:49:00,2151,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I have only fished the NW section of Lac Seul, so I can not speak of the other sections. I have been to LS since the late 90's, the fishing has been good to great each trip! We have a favorite spots, but we also try new areas for fishing. From what I have read here, if you still want muskie, the NW section mightnot be your best bet, LS is a walleye heaven, you can't go wrong on this body of water. From the web trolling I have done, it seems the NW end is kinder to your wallet, and the SW section offers more in amenities. Try the search function on this board, google Lac Seul, and plan for a great trip your family will enoy!"
1371271,Guest,2011-12-07 11:57:00,0,"There are lots of right answers cause Lac Seul has lots of great fishing. You will find that most resorts are on the northwestern portion of Lac Seul, along Hwy 502. The resorts are usually tucked away in a bay, a 10 minute boat ride to the rest of the lake. Yes, you can catch fish 10 minutes from the dock. We usually invest a 20-30 minute trip each morning to hit our favorite hot spots. 100 fish days are common. As mentioned earlier, lots of hot spots so most any resort location is just fine. Similar to LOW, when it gets windy the lake can get rough. Be careful not to get stuck across open water. We've stayed a few resorts in our 7 trips. I will return to Fisherman's Cove for my next trip (nice clean cabins, attractive grounds, good dock, fuel service, bait, and everything just works as you expect. Dan and Keith & staff run a great operation). There are a lot of postings onLac Seul resorts in the archives."
1371303,BenBeattie,2011-12-07 14:03:00,232,"If you still want the option of getting some muskie fishing in, the SE or NE part of LS is your only bet. There's lots of places to stay around Sioux Lookout (SE LS). It's a big lake, yes you can boat 5 mins or an hour and 5 mins to fish... totally up to you."
1371364,Slushfish,2011-12-07 17:31:00,263,"The case is,we were staying in Nestor Falls. Grt place,Grt people, lots of traffic close to town. We finally took to musky to fill in when the eyes were slow. We wound going to Miles Bay and the fish were more consistent. I don't have any problem with that for 100 fish day, but that's a long way to go for 20-30 average fish. Is it worth the switch? Bottom line is I'm looking for those hundred fish days and haven't found them yet. If we will find those days at LS, its time to run n gun. Slushfish"
1371625,KTroller,2011-12-08 13:34:00,237,"Slushfish, You can get 100 fish days on NW Lac Seul fishing out of the Ear Falls area. Depending on the time of year you may want to travel some (20-25 Miles) on the water to get into the fastest fishing, but you also may find them close and biting fast. To get 20-30 per day you usually won't need to travel any more than you want to as there are a ton of spots to fish.KT"
1371672,Slushfish,2011-12-08 16:12:00,263,"Thanks KT. That's the kind of info I'm looking for. My next question is, is the lake fishable with a 20ft. deep V with a 175horse? Thanks, Slushfish"
1371773,teddi,2011-12-09 05:50:00,349,"it,s highway 105 or 601[goldpines road] not 502"
