1200137,Hot N Tot,2010-05-13 13:17:00,5,Headed to Half-Moon/Marmette Bay the third week of June. Have been going to East Bay with Cargair for the last six years but decided to try something different this year and go where we could drive to. Just wondering if anyone out there has ever been...looking for lures and colors that worked best as we mainly like to troll.Thank you for your help!

It's a separate, smaller lake with a handful of cabin outposts and a guardian camp and individual that services the camps and fisherman guests as part of the Marmette outfitter staff.Any first-hand info is appreciated.Spoke with the outfitter, and claims the eye fishing is very good... will see."
