Marie, drove to Hawk Junction and boarded the Algoma Central Railway. I believe it was late July or early August. Fishing was fair, especially at the south end of the lake off an island. Can you imagine a hot bluebird day and catching Walleyes with twister tails at midday. I imagine the resort has changed much over the years. Our cabin had the flush toilet, and mosquitos through the screen or down the chimmney. We took a 6 HP Johnson outboard, bait, clothes and food in with us. When it was time to leave, you flag down the train and get off at Hawk Junction (you could depart and return from Sault Ste. Marie ) The owners were very nice. I remember they had a teenage daughter. I wonder if she helps run the resort now."

He dropped us off at the dock. Camped on an island for several days. One year, the train conductor let me ride from Wawa to mile 210 in the cab of the engine - how cool."
1370179,TIGHTLINER,2011-12-04 03:50:00,223,I believe at one time the owners of this camp were from around the Toledo area however I could be mistaken. I picked up some info at the Cleveland sport show probably 20 years ago however I never contacted them any further. I notice you are from Berlin Hts I am from the Duck town PM if if you want some info on other places you might be interested in.
