I'm looking at Pakwas Lake, and looking to stay at maybe Snake Falls. This would be my first time ever on this lake and the lastest I have been to Canada fishing. Looking for any info this lake as well as any other resorts that might be good. Thanks"
1368794,REG,2011-11-29 16:00:00,445,We spend at least one week a year on Pakwash and at Snake Falls. Great folks and great cabins/equipment. We think it's a very good lake system and you shouldn't have any problems finding fish. I just fished there in August year before last for the first time (we usually do first week of June) and there were plenty of fish to be caught and much less traffic on the lake and in the camps.
