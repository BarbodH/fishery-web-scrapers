1358763,tly,2011-10-18 07:55:00,1900,"We were camped on Taylor's Island (guess how long ago that was that we could do that!) and a plane dropped out of the sky. They backed it right up against the beach. A precision operation had begun. Two officers hopped out. One examined our camp while the other covered the perimeter of the island looking for stashed fish. The pilot got out, took off his shirt and climbed up on the wing and worked on his tan. We were clean and all told had a good experience with them. Flashing ahead, I was out alone early one morning at the mouth of the river leading to Scaler Lake when a Super Cub landed and taxied over to me. I had my license out and ready to get inspected. It turned out to be two old guys who were lost and trying to find Sioux Lookout. I pointed them in the general direction and also suggested they could wait a couple hours and follow home bound charters. They chose to go on their own. Over the years we have been examined a bunch of times and on the whole were good experiences, the exception being at Wabby where the officer was looking only for beer and convinced that all visitors must have beer stashed in the boat somewhere. There are generally good reasons for regulations and we are certainly not above them."
1358909,Mich_Fisherman,2011-10-18 15:58:00,292,"We had the MNR use quads and boat in to the lake we were on (Nagagami). They (MNR & OPP) came flying up to us (in their boat) checking us out. First thing they asked was if we had beer in the boat. They proceeded to check others as they came into camp. Come to find out I didn't have my Outdoors card (but had my license). He gave me an opportunity to produce it, but I didn't have it and they couldn't find it at home. The retailer didn't keep very good records and the ministry didn't have it on the database (even though I had bought it 3 months earlier). I got a ticket for $125..he could have written the ticket for fishing without a license and charged me for the fish also as I had fish in possession (2 walleyes), but he didn't. When I got home I was able to talk to the ministry in Cochrane, produce the outdoors card and they lowered it to $25. I was able to purchase a 7 day license from another outfitter on the lake and fish the balance of the week. The same MNR CO was on a road check as we drove out of the area. I remembered him, he remembered me. Funny thing is, he didn't ask from my license while checking the take home fish."
1359381,Jig Man,2011-10-20 08:56:00,95,"We were up at our Fly-In outpost in the Wabakimi Provincial Park August of 2010. It was a ugly morning weather wise. Low clouds and no planes were flying. Around 1pm we decided to head back to the cabin since it was raining and have a burger for lunch and go back out. On the way in I decided to have a beer for the 20 min drive back. We had just got back when we herd the unmistakeable sound of a Tubo Otter. They did a low fly-by over the cabin and then circled around to land. There was boat tied to the end of the dock that did not allow them direct access to the dock so they had to wait for one of us to stroll down to the dock to move it. Out of the plane popped 2 MNR officers, 1 OPP lady and 1 other person that may have just been the pilot. They imediatly oppened the coolers down by the boats. Then they proceeded up to the cabin to check those coolers and the fridge/freezer. Thay asked for our licenses to determine the fish limits. We checked out ok since we only keep one fish per person a day. Then on the way out I was asked if that was my boat down there. Then I was lectured because I left the one empty beer can in the boat. He said in a very stern voice ""The only place you can have a beer is in your cabin"". I asked him about having one at shore lunch and he got really testy and asked me were I heard that from. And then the big lecture about only at the cabin. Very unfriendly guys. I bet they were just p-o'd because they did not find anything else wrong and the were unable to write tickets to help cover the cost of flying. 1st visit in 12+ ontario trips. In the 2 trips to Maniotoba, checked both times for barbless hooks but that is a whole other story."
1359393,LOW1,2011-10-20 09:28:00,2828,"Interesting thread. Out of curiousity, what is the amount of authority Canadian officials have to search? Absent a search warrant or some sort of unusual circumstances, an American officer would seem to need probable cause and a warrant to search, for example, an American hotel room. Anyone have any info on this? I certainly think that rigorous enforcement of fish and game laws is necessary, but what's the limit re searches?"
1359396,tv4fish,2011-10-20 09:31:00,2694,"Jig man: That point is what gets me bent out of shape. In our 26 years of going ""up there"" -- we have NEVER had any MNR or OPP ""officers"" approach us with a friendly demeanor - I understand that their job is to enforce the law - but their ""strong arm"" tactics just don't cut it and it is unnecessary. We always cooperate and treat them respectfully, but I'm not about to say that they reciprocate. I agree -- it's just like they get p-o'd when they can't find anything wrong. Ya' know -- it's not like getting pulled by a highway patrol officer when you HAVE already done somerthing wrong."
1359457,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-20 12:38:00,1460,"We got checked in June on Wabakimi for the first time ever for any of us. I've already told the story on Wab. thread, so bear with me as I tell it again.We were having shore lunch at our spot at the West End. A place sacred to our group(we had the memorial service for my dad there just 3 years ago on this very place). Little yellow plane dropped in on us out of nowhere. I'm sure he saw the smoke from our fire we just put out. This shore lunch rock is in a tiny bay. Was hard for the pilot to maneuver in to park especially with our 4 boats and 15-20mph winds. Well the co-pilot hops out and sort of straddles the plane's pontoon and my boat to approach the shore. He steps off the plane just when a big gust of wind catches the plane and sort of whipped sideways barely missing this MNR guy by inches. I was the closest and I swear it was no more than 4"" from shredding this guy in half. Gulls were already circling. First thing he does is check our coolers. Proceded then to check for license, boat safety kit, life jackets. He then lectured us about ""party fishing"" or keeping fish on anothers license. He then alluded to having to haul out drunk American fisherman from these outpost camps. I tried to take his picture. He didn't like that either. This whole thing was kind of a novelty to me as wern't doing nothing wrong.My nephew who was there is a DEA agent, I mean a real bad asse. Been through Quantico couple time. His observation to paraphrase was he thought the MNR officer was fresh out of training and an assehole.Now I know this is not the ""popular"" or ""politically correct"" stand. But I feel that harrassing the American fly-in guy is doing nothing but antagonize a fragile industry. The fly-in business is tough enough what with all the red tape and hoops the Canadian government puts them through. This experience would certainly not deter me, but maybe others. And as far as the fishery, 2 fish slot limits and today's conservation minded fellow fisherman. That's what makes our fishery's solid. Lets face it, attitudes have changed since the days of 6 fish per.,lets see if we can fill our limit with 22"" walleyes or better."

1359997,vteye,2011-10-23 18:19:00,812,My wife and I were cutting across a big bay in VT last May(Champlain) and coast guard pulled us over. They were stupid showing off the machine guns with lots of bravado. They ordered me to close my pocket knife while doing an inspection. Pocket knife (middle aged couple) vs 5 young 20-30 yr olds with machine guns? I understand they are doing they job an protecting us from terrorists but really?
1360026,Guest,2011-10-23 20:50:00,0,Beer is not the priority for our wardens (at least it shouldn't be) and checking anglers on the way home is often fruitless. Those who poach are way more likely to take over their limit while in a remote location where they are unlikely to be checked. For that reason I totally disagree with your comment
1360030,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-23 21:19:00,1460,"Oh, I forgot to mention that mine and my boys' licenses and sportsmans cards were left in my wallet 22 miles away in camp.(will be the last time I do that) Warden didn't bat an eye. That did not interest him at all. He was only looking for alcohol violations.5thsuit is right. Having wardens check us at the outfitters dock is the way to go. When we take too many fish we like to swim the Rainy on the way back."
1360325,trapperbob,2011-10-24 21:24:00,45,"We were fishing in Quebec, Lake berthelot a few years ago. We were about 15 miles from camp when we lost all forward gears on the outboard. We still had reverse but we were unable to make much headway against the waves with water coming over the stern. It was about 1 hour before dark so the 3 of us pulled up to an island to weigh our options. we couldn`t row all the way back. We did not have a satellite phone. Out of the blue a warden showed up in a small outboard on his way to his camp in the opposite direction. we had never seen a warden there before. He called back to the lodge for us and they brought out a new motor. He saved our *** from spending the night on an island. We have never encountered another warden again while fishing. We also never fish in one boat again or go to an outpost without renting a satellite phone for the week."

1360578,Minnow Man,2011-10-25 20:23:00,85,"My Brother & I were checked by the local Game warden out of Red Lake on Joyce Lake in Northwestern Ontario. We were on a daily fly in trip, the Otter dropped out of the sky totally unexpectedly, didn't hear or see them them come in, they just landed beside our boat. We were checked, only had three walleye, both of us had left our fishing licenses at camp. We had a 5 gal plastic pail in our boat to put our take home fish in, had a jacket in the pail, Game warden asked what was in the pail, I told him we had 4 bottles of beer on ice. Told him that was the only beer we had and we were drinking a can of coke at the time of inspection. O.P.P. was the pilot, he looked at the warden and he gave the warden a wave ""forget it"". We told the warden we did have licenses and simply didn't bring them along, explaining that had we known we would be checked we would have brought them, yes we got a lecture as to always having them along, but I guess he believed us, he took our names & told us when we got back to Red Lake to go to the O.P.P. station and show our fishing licenses, with a warning if we were lying he would add extra charges. We deserved the dressing down for being forgetful, we complied with their order to show proof of a fishing licenses. I thought we got off real lucky & caught them on a good day. Now I always carry my fishing license, don't want to push my luck."

1360654,nitrodude,2011-10-26 08:17:00,60,"Sounds strange, but a few years ago my buddy and I were checked 3 times in about 12 hours. In the previous years we've had license checks every 3 or four years by one or all in our yearly group, but we were amazed when we had the same two game wardens check my buddy and I each of the three occasions in one trip, all in the same day. Stop #1 - We were heading out from camp after breakfast and knew our gas tank was low and planned on swapping tanks when we burn the low tank out. Well, it just so happens to run dry out in front of the town ramp below the RR bridge at Sioux Lookout. While I was changing tanks the MNR wardens pulled up to see if we were okay. (Their courtesy and concern for us as guests/fishermen was NEVER in question at any time.) After seeing us switch tanks and fire back up they checked our licenses to ""get it out of the way"" so we can say they did their job. These guys were very nice, polite, friendly and concerned that we weren't stranded or adrift, most notably.Stop #2 - After a glorious morning and afternoon on the water, we headed back to camp for dinner. On the way we stopped at the RR bridge community hole to finish off the minnows left in our buckets. Within five minutes of anchoring on the SW upstream side a MNR boat putted around the NE downstream side where several other boats were doing the same as us. It was the same fellas and sure enough, they started laughing as we were when they pulled aside and asked again. They said, and I agreed, that with all the other boats around, mostly locals, it wouldn't look right for them to come aside laughing and carrying on with us like they knew us and not check licenses. We said no problem and went through it again for all eyes to see their equal treatment of us. We told them we were glad to ""get it out of the way...AGAIN!"" and laughed some more as they wished us good luck and headed for the ramp. We finished off our minnows and went back to camp.Stop #3 - Back at camp, my buddy went to the cabin to start prepping for dinner and I took our four walleye to the ice house. (I get a full license each year, so in retrospect I was even legally carrying our catch to our cooler.) When I walked into the ice house where other guests were cleaning and/or putting fish away, you'll never guess who was there checking coolers. Yep, one of the same two guys from the earlier visits. I almost fell over laughing with the officer wondering about the odds of this happening! I had been checked on the water up there only twice before in 15 or so years, so it was comical for us both to say the least. He checked our empty bin and ""recognized"" the fish I was carrying then thanked me for my patience and consideration for him doing his job, in our case quite thoroughly. As I walked out of the fish house I waved at the other officer getting into their truck as I headed back to my cabin. Standing on the deck of the cabin was my buddy still laughing and enjoying an evening highball. I asked what was so funny, when he told me, ""You'll never guess who just came by checking licenses and cabin freezers?"" I started laughing again and said the other one caught me at the cooler with some other guests to go through the same motions. That's when my buddy says, ""Aren't you glad we got that out of the way!!"""

1368285,nitrox,2011-11-27 20:25:00,21,"After a day of fishing on lake near Ivanhoe, two MNR officers out of Chapleau, stopped my fishing buddy and I as we were heading home with boat in motor in toe. We checked out fine within our limits, but asked where we were staying. They immediately shot to the home/lodge of our friend that is American. My wife answered the door and was given the third degree, she then went and found our host. These two MNR officers wanted permission to inspect the premises. Friend abliged. They checked everywhere for illegal fish. The only thing they found was an old pike in the freezer that didn't have a patch of skin on it. Fined my friend 125.00 bucks. The rest of the story! Same two MNR guys went back to the lake we were fishing on and found some Canadians from Timmins that were fishing and camping. Checked there licenses and then left. Went to Timmins to check these guys home freezers. Wife and kids were the only ones at home. Turns out these guys that they were heckling were OPP officers. The war was on, mnr guys were stopped and ticketed numerous times. It took the MNR chief from Chapleau to pay a visit to the OPP chief in Timmins to end dispute and settle the boys down."

1363023,campchick,2011-11-05 11:00:00,96,I just read the post from Jatar about his experiences buying beer and liquor and using a cab to take it to the houseboat he and his buddies had rented for the week. It seems to me that the reason the OPP officer didn't fine him was the distinction between a houseboat and a boat. Because the houseboat had a bathroom on board it is classified as a residence and therefore it was perfectly legal to have liquor and beer on board. Not so with a boat/skiff.
1363230,riverrat47,2011-11-06 15:03:00,3,"OK, what about boat in cabins?"
1363232,bigwalleye1,2011-11-06 15:11:00,2632,Should be the same thing. It's the idea that you're legal to transport to that place where you're spending the night. Catching you in the bush fishing with beer open or empty cans in the boat would be a no-no.
1363315,Guest,2011-11-07 06:29:00,0,"From what I understand, the houseboat has to be anchored in order for you to legally be allowed to drink on it. Welcome to Ontario"
1363322,fishincrazy,2011-11-07 07:18:00,1282,"So here's a question can you even have unopened beer can's on your boat?What about shore lunch?I have in the past always had a couple of beer's at shore lunch.Haven't been in a like 5-6 years going this year and want to abide by the law,no matter how misguided it is.FC"
1363356,FrankLeigh,2011-11-07 09:50:00,80,"In Ontario, you may transport unopened beer, liquor from the place of purchase to your residence. The method of transport can be a car, truck, taxi, boat, plane or whatever. That residence can be your own permanent home or your cabin or a temporary rental property, such as motel or hotel.It can be a campsite or a boat. If it is a campsite, you must have permission from the land owner to camp there. Some Provincial Parks do not allow alcohol. If it is a boat, it must have a head (toilet) and a berth (sleeping quarters) and must be at anchor. A bucket and a sleeping bag in a 16 foot boat does not qualify, even if you are anchored.Any consumption of alcohol outside of your residence or a licensed establishment is considered ""drinking out of residence"", and can result in charges. If you are an Ontario resident, having alcohol in your boat is considered the same as having alcohol in your car and can result in the loss of your drivers licence.In Ontario, it so politcally correct now, to catch someone with a couple of beers in a boat, that the OPP have acquired a lot of boats and snowmobiles, for just that purpose. I have heard first hand tales of police hauling boats into remote lakes to check on a dozen fishermen. A friend of mine, has a house trailer on a private lake. Each Friday, the people who own pontoon boats would meet at the far end of the lake, have a couple of glasses of wine and a swim. This summer, the OPP came upriver into the lake and gave everyone a warning and sent them back to their docks. Last winter, while ice fishing on Lake Simcoe, we were checked daily by a group of three OPP and MNR, all driving new Yamahas.I don't know if that answers your questions or not, but that is the current state of affairs in Big Brother Ontario.If you happen to be on the Great Lakes or Lake Simcoe, you may find yourself being stopped by a large OPP vessel, with a berth and a head......."
1363495,fishincrazy,2011-11-07 19:33:00,1282,"AHHH so if we get on their boat we can drink beer??? Thanks for the info,I guess I will limit my drinking to the island I'm staying on or I guess just in the cabin.Man talk about ball busters.just sayin.....FC"
1363530,FrankLeigh,2011-11-07 21:40:00,80,"Yeah, more resources devoted to drinking offences than anything else. The drinking out of residence law has always been there, but it has become much more aggressively enforced in recent years.The Ontario government is in a very deep financial hole, and any fines, charges that will bring in money are being very aggressively pursued. Roadside seat belt checks, speed traps and RIDE programs are all on the increase, while only 30% of real crimes are even being reported, beause the average guy knows that he is wasting his time. To report theft or break ins now, you have to go to a Community Policing Centre, where your report is taken, not by a police officer, but a volunteer.As a result, the government reports that crime is down and therefore they are devoting resources to making our roads and waterways safer. Until we get rid of our current Provincial Government, the situation will not change."
1361358,Guest,2011-10-28 21:21:00,0,"Pikeslayer: I don't think you understood what I was saying. Most anglers are legal by the time they hit the outfitters dock in downtown Red Lake/Sioux Lookout/wherever. It's the getting a limit for lunch and another for supper and snacks that can play havoc on the smaller lakes. A lot of anglers do this unfortunately and, unless the wardens have a presence in the bush at the out post camp level, it will not stop. Realistically, it will never stop completely but fear of being checked tends to make poachers less likely to be blatant about it."
1361364,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-28 23:08:00,1460,"I'm sorry for my tone. Probably a bit out of line and you are right, I did not understand fully what you meant.When I was little I remember a few times getting checked by presumably MNR when we flew back to our outfitters dock at Ft. Francis. Looking back now it just seems like an efficient way for complience checking. I tend to think in monetary terms, and of course the flight is the expensive part of a fly-in trip. Just thinking of the resourses being spent on fuel and salary(which is considerable) dosn't make sense to me on a return on investment basis. Of course, it's not my taxdollar, but would not the vast resourses be better off used in other ways? Invasive species control comes to mind off the top. I understand gobies have infiltrated many bodies of water in Ontario. Pollution control would be another nobel effort. The Great Lakes, Simcoe are polluted but hey, lets catch an American havin a beer.I think we can all agree that any poacher weather local or tourist is the lowest form of pond scum and should be procecuted to the fullest.To any poachers who may read this: Sportsmans Service sells awesome walleye fillets. Save yourself a big headache. Do the right thing."
1361398,Guest,2011-10-29 07:42:00,0,"I totally agree that training officers in fish and wildlife enforcement and then using them to charge people drinking is a complete waste of our tax dollars. However, fly-in enforcement of our fish and game laws is a necessary deterrent in my opinion. As an aside, Canadian Wildlife magazine in it's Sept/Oct issue had a short article on the round gobie. Apparently sport fish in the Great Lakes love eating them and this has resulted in more stable populations of bass, walleye and trout. Gobies are also one of the few predators on zebra mussels. Go figure!"
1361856,Jatar,2011-10-31 16:59:00,169,"My story goes back about 30 years ago. The encounter did not take place in the Bush, but at the Kenora public dock. We arrived late on a Saturday afternoon, and the Houseboat operator told us our boat was ready to go, we had no grocerys, beer, etc. We told him that we would leave after shopping, I noticed him looking at his watch and then saying "" The Beer store is closed"" I replied, ""We will get it at the grocery store"", He replied "" you can only get it at the Beer store"", I replied ""OK, we will get it tomorrow"", His reply ""Closed on Sundays"" Well S%^$, He loaned us a couple of cases and off we went. Fwd to Monday.My buddy and I fished our way back to Kenora, we docked at the public pier, he waited and I walked to the Beer store. I ordered the usual- 17 cases of various brews and asked them to call me a cab, got a strange look but they were very helpful. Cab driver asked ""where to "", I replied ""The liquor store"", got a few bottles of various spirits and we were off to the pier. Cab driver was a great guy, he helped us load the boat, gave him a nice tip and we were ready to go .I started to untie the boat when a voice said: Whats going on here ?,I looked up to see an OPP Officer. I didn't give it much thought, and said "" We picked up some beer"" OPP- I can see that.OPP- Where are you going ?Me- FishingOPP-I cant see any poles because of all the beer stacked up in the boatMe- Oh, I will show youOPP-Don't botherOPP-Where are you staying at ?

1362075,Mike Kansas,2011-11-01 14:06:00,1463,A friend of mine went to Canada with a group about 30 years ago. They had hired guides for the entire week. The first day they caught a ton of fish and decided to cancel the guides for the rest of the week. Needless to say the guides were upset. That night there was a knock at the fishermans cabin door and when they opened it there stood the Game Warden. He asked what their boat numbers were and when they told him he marched them to the lake. Each of their boats had a large stringer of Walleye tied to them and it was well over their limit. They were all fined and to this day my friend believes that the Guides got paid via the Game Warden. My friend thought they deserved what they got.
1362181,Glenman12,2011-11-01 21:16:00,762,"My first trip to Canada was in 1981..fished out of Cedar Lake Lodge in Perrault Falls...to have the full Canadian experiecne we decided to do a one day fly out, I beleive it was Vaughn Lake..fished that morning and caught enough walleye for a shore lunch..went in to where the plane had dropped us off and ate to our bellys content..went back out caught some more and we were happy.. One guy in our group, when re-affixing the stringer to the boat put it too far back and what we had on the stringer got chopped up..this turned out to be a blessing in diguise..we discarded a few walleye and a northern..caught a several more after that and suddenly we had a boat approaching us..the sole occupant was an Indian, with long hair and wearing a red flannel shirt..he had an MNR ID..he checked our licenses and looked at what we had on the stringer..we knew we were within the limit.( back then you could have 6 walleyes) then he asked us if we had shore lunch and where..we pointed out the spot and he said to stay here...he motrered over to where we had eaten and then came back...Said we were fine and he left.. We were newbies..didnt know that the fish we had eaten would count against our limit.. If that one guy hadnt let our stringer get into the prop we would have probably been screwed."

I do know he has worked that area for years and have talked to him before, one time when moose hunting and checking outpost cabins for a friend.

I think the OPP guys were looking for alcohol, the CO recognised me, asked for our liscense's, (which were at the cabin), but did not seemed concerned. They were going to hit White Otter and who knows where else before returning to Ignace. I was a nice day for a ride."
1359591,MorganMan,2011-10-20 22:31:00,341,"Dang, we have been doing fly ins for almost 20 years and have never been checked! I know from the border crossings that these people who do these jobs have no sense of humor. In Canada, you are treated sometimes like a criminal until proven otherwise. We obey fishing laws to the hilt as we fully agree with conservation laws and the core group of us who go make sure of that. We don't keep more than our limits each day and we take none home with our conservation licenses. The part that eats me about some of these stories is they spend money in gas and wages to fly people around the province or country to check a license? Or too many fish? Or beer? Do they really get a return on ticket money? The states should hire these people for immigration and to catch real criminals. Think of the money they spend to accomplish mostly nothing??Some of these stories are ridiculous and I hope we never run into this situation."
1359608,ohiojmj,2011-10-21 05:52:00,1262,"I've been checked in Ontario 3 times in the last decade, twice on the lake and once at the road block type check. All were quick, polite, professional, perhaps partly because I carry good attitude and believe in following rules and strict enforcement, although beer on the lake, well, that's a tough one, but we use cups when we down just a few swills on a hot day."
1359639,v-bay gord,2011-10-21 08:14:00,3168,"I'ld like to hear the other side of the story from those who intentionally go out to break the rules and get caught. Unfortunately there are many of them, resident and nonresident alike. There are also some outfitters who are willing to break or bend the rules to their advantage. I think enforcing the fish and game act is a pretty thankless job.......it's hard to do it properly and be someone's buddy at the same time. That said, there is no excuse for not doing it in a professional manner, and there are a few officers out there with the ""short man syndrome"".....but for the most part I think they are doing a fine job. I wish we had a few more of them. The guide from Vermilion Bay who was caught ice fishing with too many rods, and over the limit in lake trout, last winter might disagree........now what was his name???"
1359655,5thsuit,2011-10-21 09:21:00,54,Checking Outpost camps is a total waste of money. Wait until they return to basecamp and do a license and fish check as soon as they land. If someone has a beer in a boat on a isolated flyin lake BFD!
1359810,northernbite,2011-10-22 08:31:00,1186,"It is real simple guys, know the laws and limits, follow them and tell the truth so when you do have an encounter no problems. Even when they are not that friendly you should answer what they ask and provide what papers they ask for, you should be fine. We had an inspection once where a local had turned us in(found out later who it was) and we where check. Our camp was in complience and no problems.As I tell all my guys you are in a different country.Safe travels,Paul"
1359873,cody123,2011-10-22 20:36:00,16,"A dozen years ago-we took our boats to another lake cause the lake we fished was still froze over. We crossed a sanctuary sign saying closed until May 1st. We went fishing & had fish in the boat. After we were stopped & told we were under Federal arrest we found out as a joke someone scraped off the 1 for May 31st. It was a OPP & MNR that stopped us, they were very professinal said they under stood but gave us each a $100 fine.They said we could make up the difference by not taking our wives out for dinner when we got home. On the lighter side, when we went in the next day the lady we payed our fine to called her son & he told us the best spots to go fishing. A few years later we were fishing opening week for northerns in the creeks using dead chubs. A MNR boated up to us to check us out. We found out the hard way that you can only use a bait hook with 4 points (we were using 2 trebles) He kept asking if we made these or baught them.( I said we made them) cost us $175. Funny thing was all the Bait shops in town sells the quick strike rigs in town using 2 trebles. Plus when I got home I sent a US postel money order to Kenora to pay the fine--- they sent the money order back saying non negotiabe in Canada. But yet they took my check instead."
1359895,F250,2011-10-23 05:06:00,75,"Interesting thread. I have just completed a 35 year career as a Game Warden in the States. 95 % of the sportsmen I met in the field were some of the best folks you could ever want to share a coffee with in camp. However, we encounter the worst of the worst on a regular basis. I have been assulted with fists, shot at, held at gun point, assulted with knives, assualted with a beer bottle, assulted with an ice chisel, had my boat shot (and hit) with me in it, and had my truck rammed by a poacher in his truck. Verbal assualts happen way too often. Some days it is tough to keep that smile on your face. Most Wardens strive to treat sportsmen as they themselves would want to be treated. Some of my closest friends are Wardens in Canada. I have fished for walleyes in many of the locations discussed on this site."
1359907,NE IA Angler,2011-10-23 06:51:00,18,"Several years ago while fishing near Dinorwic, my friends and I were setting up a shore lunch and a very young officer motored up to our lunch site. Very politely checked our fish and licenses. Everything was fine. We invited him to stay for lunch, he declined. He said there were others on the lake that he wanted to check. We knew that we were the only ones on the lake. So he motored around the point. In a few minutes we saw him watching us with binocs. We finished our shore lunch, put out the fire, cleaned up the site and went back to finish the day getting the last of our limit. In a few minutes the young officer returned and checked us again. We were a little puzzled, he acted like he'd never met us before. Then he motored off. In a hour or two he returned to check us again. This time when he was done checking us out he asked for directions back to the landing, it appeared that he had been lost on the lake for hours and had been motoring around and getting VERY low on gas. We were almost done fishing so we took him back to the landing with us. We all had a good laugh, even he thought it was funny. Our group often wonders how long he'd been lost if he hadn't found us. I wonder if he ever told his fellow officers that he'd been rescued by some Iowa fishermen? I have found the officers who checked us our group over the years to be very courteous, professional and they enjoy doing a difficult and thankless job."
1359922,NP4ME,2011-10-23 08:27:00,378,"I give them kudos for doing a mostly thankless job. In the few experiences I have had with them, they have been nothing but polite and easy to deal with. I wish there were more out there to help protect the fisheries."
1359930,bigwalleye1,2011-10-23 09:13:00,2632,"We were checked on Lac Seul in July this year just north of Manitou Rapids. Pretty windy where we were fishing when the warden came up, I asked if we could move to calmer water since he was alone and it was just I and my 70 something dad in the boat. He obliged. He asked how fishing was, asked for licenses, outdoor cards, life jackets. Never asked to enter the boat to check anything, just said he was doing license compliance checks. Was very friendly, declined a cold water, and motored away. One of the nicest checks I've ever had, either side of the border. Also, a couple times MNR officers have stopped by camp, and were also very cordial to us. Some other folks in camp, though, not so much. I believe, in part, you get what you give."
1359521,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-20 16:33:00,1460,"My point, Canadian guest is fly-in outfitters deal mainly with US clientele. Sure, Canadians as well fly, just a much smaller %.Canadian locals should get checked as well. Wonder who violates fishery's more, the guy who spends a week a year up there or Canadian locals? Of course, this is not about protecting fisherys anyway. Its about how many 100$ tickets for alcohol they can write.Like I said, I enjoyed being ckecked by MNR. Another thing to add to the memories."
1359530,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-20 17:36:00,235,"In one of our fly in warden visits, the warden asked us what lake we were on. I wasn't sure if he was asking because he honestly didn't know, or if he was trying to get us to trip up (like maybe we didn't have rights to be on the lake). Just thought that was interesting."
1357861,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-14 19:02:00,235,"Anyone ever have a warden fly in and check you at an outpost cabin. I've experienced it two times. The first time was interesting. We were on Wakeman Lake and had the only outpost cabin on the lake. The plane landed by the boat I was in (with my dad and brother). As soon as we saw it was the fuzz, we radioed the other boats in our group just to give them a heads up. A friend of ours in another boat realized his license was back at the cabin. He immediately motored back to the cabinl The MNR plane came to a stop right by our boat and they motioned us to pull up to their pontoon and proceeded to checking us for licenses, fish etc. From a distance, the wardens saw our buddy dock up and rush into the cabin. They immediately got suspicious (I'm sure they thought we were hiding extra fish, which we weren't). They had us radio in all the other boats back to camp where they proceeded to check everything and everyone. They asked our friend why he was running into the cabin, and he made up a lie that he was worried about his son who wasn't feeling well (his son was a bit hungover and was simply sleeping in). He then offered the wardens some cheese and crackers, which they declined, and it was really awkward - you could hear a pin drop! One of the wardens then spent 10 minutes foraging in the woods behind our cabin. He was so certain we were covering something up, and I honestly don't blame him. They eventually left, and they had a look and tone of frustration as if they were so close to making a bust but couldn't get a break. I got my first taste of how no-nonsense some of those guys can be. The one warden did all the talking, and the other didn't say more than three words the whole time, but he was a big, strong-looking dude and that made him all the more intimidating. Anyone else run into the law out in the bush?"
1357865,mrwalleye5,2011-10-14 19:23:00,1922,"In northern Saskatechewan I've had a plane come in and land with ski's on the ice. Up in the middle of no where. CO's were great, had a nice chat on a beautiful march day."
1357869,Skywagon,2011-10-14 19:47:00,1106,"Yes, got checked twice just this past winter on two different remote lakes by different CO's, one from Dryden, one from Ignace. Nice guys doing their job, glad they are out there keeping everyone honest."
1357890,ManitouBass,2011-10-14 22:42:00,201,"If I was a CO, I woulda treated you in a similar manner. What your buddy did is like pulling a u-turn at a ride program. Sounds very shady, and looks just as bad. Good on you though for obeying the laws"

1357905,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-15 06:17:00,725,"We got stopped in a road check in 2010. We were quite confident because we absolutely knew we were within limits. The four of us had 16 walleye and 8 bass (It was in June). We usually don't keep northerns. Anyway they opened our cooler and we were having our final Canada cigar. I notice that he was taking an inordinate amount of time counting when he looks at me and says, ""I keep coming up with 17 walleye."" At this the other three guys begin inspecting dandelions on the road side and so i am the one that responds to his request to count them with him. Sure enough there is an extra walleye. Apparentlly two bags were frozen togeter so solidly we counted it as one. The officer believed me when I told him that this was a surprise to me as well. Unfortunately, someone had to admit that was there fish and since the dandelions were VERY interesting by now I said it must be me. He took four walleye and gave me a ticket which cost me $240. He said it was like a speeding ticket but that nothing was cheap in Ontario. I was the one expected to get the tax refund from camp which was supposed to be about $200 so everyone thought it would be even when I got the refund. Of course, that year the Canadian govt. decided that our refund was only $60, so i got hosed. This past year we made sure that the filet bags were not frozen together! Stuff happens."
1358107,@Lunker,2011-10-15 20:13:00,835,Nice of your buddies to man up and stick together. I'd dump the guys.
1358116,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-15 20:55:00,725,One of them was my son and one is my BIL and I just love the other guy. I wouldn't dump lifelong friendships for that. I'll get 'em back one way or another. It has become just one of the stories of our Canadian fishing adventures.
1358144,tv4fish,2011-10-16 05:43:00,2694,"Sounds like a VERY good plan to me. As you said -- ""STUFF happens""."
1358582,Kmanster,2011-10-17 13:23:00,26,"Yeah, one of our guys was checked this summer up at Otatakan. All was in order. The whole ordeal lated about 20 mins. We saw the plane but because we were in the river, they decided to hit those on the lake. I'm all for them keeping things straight. Until next year...."
