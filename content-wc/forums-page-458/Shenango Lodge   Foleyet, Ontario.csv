1307079,labsrus,2011-05-15 10:29:00,557,Our group was at Rush Lake in September 2001. It was hard to beleive when George came in a day early. Half of our group was planning on coming in on Wednesday and when George told us what happened we could not believe it. He was able to bring in the other guys on Thursday that week and we found out what was going one. We have a trip to Rush Lake scheduled for July this year.

It is a decent resort Kevin and Leslie will treat you like royality! not to mention the cooking is fantastic as well! We also do a yearly G2G on The West Arm... this was the only year in recent memory I could not attend (Still bummed out about it) But I was on the south shores of the Lake with family.. hard to go wrong with Nipissing! As for Ivanhoe, I have also spent time there as well, infact I will be there in 2 weeks! however we stay @ the Provincial Park (Beautiful!) fishing has always so so.. some monster Pike cruise that lake!

Link:http://www.nugget.ca/ArticleDisplay....=Brandi+Cramer Copy/Paste: 'Phenomenal' fishing; Anglers, bait dealers counting down to walleye season Posted By Brandi Cramer Posted 1 hour ago Tammie Pecore's shopping list Tuesday included worms. Pecore says she's ""hardcore"" when it comes to angling - her wedding ring has fish engraved on it - and was buying bait to entice splake. ""#### right I am looking forward to a weekend of fishing,"" she said. ""It's relaxing, it's freedom and peace of mind and you get outdoors."" The good news for Pecore is if the Ministry of Natural Resources is right, this fishing season could be one to remember. Walleye season is set to open Saturday at 12:01 a.m. and Mike Regis, district enforcement supervisor with the ministry, predicts it will be ""phenomenal."" ""There were a lot of 12- to 15-inchers last year,"" he said. ""They will have grown and will be great in the frying pan this year."" Richard Rowe's analysis of data for the past two years shows the same thing. A biologist with Nipissing First Nation's natural resources department, Rowe said there will be a lot of ""catchable fish."" ""Walleye fishing goes up and down based on strong year classes,"" he said. A strong year class occurs when conditions are perfect during the spawning season. ""It takes three years to grow a perfect frying pan-size fish,"" Rowe said. In 2005, conditions were perfect with high water levels, a warm and stable spring, and a long growing season. Advertisement ""We had a good summer that year. That means there is lots for walleye to eat and once they get by the first winter, survival rates are very high,"" Rowe said. Bob Esch, owner of Trout Lake Bait and Canoe, expects Lake Nipissing will be ""super busy"" this weekend judging by how much his phone has been ringing. ""I am definitely not going fishing,"" he said, but he will ensure ""hundreds if not thousands"" have the right tools. His business is kept viable by catering to different species including splake and rainbow trout. But the start of walleye season Saturday will open the flood gates. ""We will start getting extra busy Thursday morning,"" Esch said, adding his store hours are long - ""sun up to sun down."" He is ready with a healthy supply of shiners, chubs, dace, worms and leeches, as well as tackle. And for those uncertain of what to put on their lines, Esch is more than willing to offer guidance. ""If it's a cold spring and the water stays cold, a minnow is the best way to go. If it warms up - worms and leeches,"" he said. Rowe also had tips for anglers planning to catch and release. ""Play the fish quickly, handle it quickly and in the water,"" he said. Regis reminds eager anglers to measure catches carefully to avoid violating any regulations. And if you planned on having a few cold ones - do it on shore. ""Booze and boating don't mix,"" Regis said. ""If you have (alcohol) in the boat we have the authority to charge you. ""The key message is be safe and have fun.""[email protected] know the rules Things you should know: - Lake Nipissing slot size for walleye is 40 to 60 centimetres, while on Trout Lake the slot size is 43 to 60 centimetres. - Lake Nipissing does not have a sturgeon season. - Lake trout and salmon is open on Trout Lake June 21 to 27 - Muskie season on Lake Nipissing opens June 21 to Dec. 15 Bass species is open throughout Fishing Management Zone 11 June 28 to Dec. 31 - Walleye is open on the Ottawa River May 16 to Dec. 31 - a week later than usual. - On the Ottawa River and Lake Timiskaming from May 16 to June 15, all walleye must be less than 40 centimetres.

Never fished Bonar...would like to one day...I have been to McConnell, Fourarm, Paul, Little Lemoine, and repeated some of those lakes. Also flew with his brother John 1 year and went to Sahler. Going to Katagi Lake this year, be up there on the 22nd of August..can't wait. Tight Lines. Jason"
1071239,lnagy,2009-01-02 17:32:00,16,"I have fished this lodge 4 times, 3 with the current owner. Always have had a great time for the money.This has been a father son trip ( the 4 boy's are now 12-14).We've had good weather,bad weather. Great fishing, bad fishing. Always good food,good equipment and good times.Can't be beat for the cost. We're booked for 2nd week of June, 11 of us, 5 of them young fishermen.Pass it on!!! Take a kid fishing!"
1073659,Guest,2009-01-14 08:39:00,0,"had agreat time caught 30 a day and a few pike over 35"" . Its a typical fishing place. not to fancy but just fine. food was great, train ride was suprisingly quick and easy. i would recomend it. will be going next year (cant go this year, changed jobs no vacation)"
1075255,gmooneyham,2009-01-22 08:46:00,2,"We have been going to Shenango for years now, 3 times with the current owner. We love it. We took our kids and grandkids one year, there were so many of us we had the whole camp for our family. It was great. We are going again this summer. The fishing can't be beat, the food is good and Jack (the owner) does everything he can to make us feel welcome. I understand from some guys who go up there to hunt, that is good too. I highly recomend this place."
1082998,elby1,2009-02-23 08:01:00,1,"I have been going to Shanango for about 20 years now. I don't go primarily for the walleye as I fish Lake Erie for walleye. That being said I can tell you the trip to Shenango is well worth my time. The typical walleye is about 20-22"" with a good assortment of bigger and smaller fish. The food is good and Jack does a much better job of running the place than the previous 2 owners did. I make it an annual trip and have never been disappointed."
1087390,Guest,2009-03-12 08:56:00,0,I booked a bear hunt for my son and I in September and wife and daughter are going with us. They'll fish and boat around while we're hunting. I'll re-post after the trip
1107108,gmooneyham,2009-05-22 06:54:00,2,"Do try Shenango Lodge. We go there nearly every year, catch walleye and pike every day and are treated great. I can't say enough. We have taken our grandchildren and they have had a wonderful experience.Great fishing. This year we are going in August along with Son-in-Law and grandsons for fishing, Son going up later to bear hunt, and brother-in-law and nephew that might come. When we took our 15 year old grandson one year, he did not want to leave!!!."
1305061,jlesak,2011-05-10 09:16:00,1,Sorry I'm late in but i found this site while looking for jacks website. I've been here and going again in june. This place is GREAT! We caught more fish than i had time in the day. I was worn out! Multiple lakes. I netted a 5.5 pound walleye for my nephew that almost dragged him off the boat! Jack took a picture and recorded it. We do a father and son trip every year and we love this place. Jack took it over from a guy who let it go to waste and he has been rebuilding it. We always go in June and never have a problem catching fish. My Dad has been fishing for over 50 years with trips to Canada and multiple locations and he loved this place. Unless something has changed since i was last there i would recommend it.
575470,Seanik,2008-06-25 10:35:00,218,"Hi Everyone, I wasn't going to do a Canada fishing trip this year for many of the reasons discussed on this board. However the fever has overtaken me and now I want to go. Most of the lodges I contacted have openings even on short notice. The outfitter on the top of my short list is Shenango Lodge near Foleyet, Ontario. The lodge can only be accessed by train or air. They have a website but it doesn't have a lot of information on it. I would appreciate any comments or information about this place. I don't want to drive much more than 400 miles from Toronto, any other recommended lodges is welcome here."
575475,deputy dog,2008-06-25 13:29:00,305,not sure about the distance but try www.lodge-at-parent-lake.com great 'eye fishing and decent northerns too. father in law has been goin for 25 or so years. how far does 400 miles put you north?
575483,Guest,2008-06-25 16:39:00,0,"a group of 4 of us went there about 17-18 years ago. 4 walleyes caught in the entire camp all week. believe it was in july. son and i worked hard to boat about 10 hammer handles per day. think the biggest caught for the week was 29"". went to a remote drive out lake a few miles away for a guided half day and caught lots of small walleye. 16-17 inch was the largest. needless to say, haven't been back. lots could change in that timeframe. like i said, it was quite a while ago. things could have gotten better, or worse. accomodations at that time were sparse."
575504,Seanik,2008-06-26 08:57:00,218,"LCW, your reply along with the lack of good info from the lodge has taken them off the short list. Another possibility is the Twin Bears Resort on the Montreal river near Kenabeek, Ontario, any feedback on this place is welcome. If I don't select a lodge between now and mid July, I may just load the Honda CRV with gear and my grandson and head North across the border about 400 miles and take a chance. Thanks again to all that reply and view,"
575507,Guest,2008-06-26 11:29:00,0,"If you were considering Foleyet, if you don't mind driving another 10 mins, you can hit Air Ivanhoe. They have boat in cabins, fly-in outposts or you can drive to the lodge and fish the Ivanhoe River. I have been going to them for the last 10+ years (all fly-outs) and have always had good fishing and George (owner) has always been great. Here is there web site. Airivanhoe.com Tight Lines Jason"
575519,Guest,2008-06-27 07:17:00,0,Have you ever heard much about the fishing in the river. We're heading up there to do a boat in on the river. Just wondering what to expect.
575522,Guest,2008-06-27 08:26:00,0,"Seanik, I see you're from Erie PA. I'm in Warren. Tomorrow morning early I'm heading out on our annual trip to the west arm of Lake Nipissing. Many folks will tell you there aren't a lot of walleyes there, but over the last number of years they have been on the rebound. Last year we boated nearly 400 between the 4 of us over 2 weeks, with many over the slot. Now I know many would say that's not that good, but we were with our wives and we didn't fish for walleyes every day and never after dinner; point being it could have been a much higher total. Anyhow we stay at Lakair Lodge. You might also want to look at Memquisit Lodge, and there are a few others in the area if you do a search I'm sure you'll see them. Good luck"
575528,Guest,2008-06-27 10:22:00,0,"If your looking for a place to stay and are willing to go a little further north there is Grey Owl on Biscotasing Lake north of Sudbury. I'm from Corry and been fishing that area for 20 years in July, alway tent in differant lakes but that area would fill your itch. The nice part is you can drive right to the lodge and I'm sure all lodges are looking for somebody to fill openings. I'll be in that area from mid-July till end of month. I'm in the book if you would want to call. Paul Kubich"
575530,Guest,2008-06-27 10:41:00,0,Haven't fished the river to much...but did fish it a couple of years ago and did well with the pike..they were small but a ton of fun. Only fished the afternoon that day. I would talk to George and he'll stir you in the right direction. Tight Lines Jason B
575533,Guest,2008-06-27 11:29:00,0,"Thanks. Ya, we'll touch base with George. We've only used Air Ivanhoe once before. We wend to Bonar lake. Weather was bad and fishing wasn't the greatest. Oh yeah, it was also the week of September 11th 2001. We had no idea what happened until George picked us up. We thought he was bs'ing us...."
