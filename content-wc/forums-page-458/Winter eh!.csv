1367275,Skywagon,2011-11-22 21:28:00,1106,"Limeyangler, be careful out there. My neighbor called this morning and said he saw a buck deer go through the ice yesterday afternoon as it was crossing over to the mainland from an island. This was in front of his place on Dinorwic."
1367317,v-bay gord,2011-11-23 07:11:00,3168,"41 degrees today, 46 tomorrow.....and no freezing in site till Sunday. Vermilion Bay is open water. I don't think ice fishing would be a good call for this weekend. I will be pheasant hunting around Beloit Kansas this weekend.....sounds like perfect weather for that!"
1367400,Steve Ediger,2011-11-23 11:00:00,97,V-Bay Gord - Welcome to Kansas. My wife is a teacher in Beloit and we live near there in Jamestown. Good luck with the Pheasants. I hope you enjoy Kansas half as much as I enjoy Ontario.
1367475,lcwhit,2011-11-23 16:00:00,104,"i must have walked a million miles chasing those birds about 50 miles south of beloit. hunted the ellsworth lincoln area in the 80-90s. great quail hunting too. those were the days. man i loved that, almost as much as chasing walleye. whit"
1367655,tlars,2011-11-24 18:52:00,137,Mid 60's in N. Central Iowa today. November? Or April?
1368006,Gibson,2011-11-26 14:47:00,17,9 celcius two days ago in Winnipeg. Makes for tough sledding....
1368029,Limeyangler,2011-11-26 16:41:00,563,Yeah....this weather sucks if you like icefishing. Been plus temps all week since the lake froze. To compound my misery...lol...its dumped close to a foot of snow today which should insulate a perfectly horrible thin crust of crappy ice!I predicted i'd be fishing today....lol...WRONG! Should have kept my mouth shut!
1368073,ManitouBass,2011-11-26 20:26:00,201,"It's been real warm here too Limey. We got hit with some good snow today, roads were pretty rough. I drove up to Great Bear to see what they had on sale for rods/reels, conditions were horrible, to say the least. I'm heading out tomorrow, possibly the last time until ice. Hows things on your end? Any safe ice yet?"
1368178,Limeyangler,2011-11-27 11:26:00,563,"Its horrible down here Rick. Warm with lots of snow. It started off awesome 10 days ago...all it had to do was stay below freezing and i would have drilled holes by now. But i dont think i,ll be out there even next week. The lake i'm on has open water again in the main partYou are lucky if you are still fishing, no place to shore fish here really, and ice is not good enough to walk on...I have been out on the snowmachine with Jack a lot...only bonus really!"
1370148,Limeyangler,2011-12-03 20:38:00,563,"Finally made it out!Managed to get on the ice for an hour and a half today. 6"" of good ice.Got a limit of walleye!LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL! http://www.youtube.com/my_videoshttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_5349.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_5351.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_5355.jpgFish were in 19' FOW, pink jig was the hot one, jigs tipped with a good size dace minnow. Bite lasted about half an hour just before sunset."
1366691,wallydave,2011-11-20 15:33:00,2151,http://www.redwinglodge.net/webcam/image.jpgLooks like winter has arrived up North
1366702,GWC,2011-11-20 15:58:00,1021,I'm headed south about 200 miles from Kansas City. The lakes never freeze over down there. Yea it gets cold & there is some snow but not like Canada. Maybe get in some winter fishing before heading to Canada next year.
1366713,Skywagon,2011-11-20 16:41:00,1106,"I am still stuck in Illinois, but just talked to my wife on the phone, she said our lake froze completely over last night and there is some snow on the ground."
1366743,Golden Eagle,2011-11-20 19:38:00,2642,Guess she'll have to shoot her own moose this time.
1366764,Limeyangler,2011-11-20 21:10:00,563,"similar situation here, when i went to bed last night the lake was liquid........when i woke up this morning and looked out the window........it looked like this............................http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIn4kGLUJtsNext weekend should see my first holes drilled :thumbsup_anim: :thumbsup_anim: :thumbsup_anim:LOVE ICE FISHING......MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR!"
1366818,tlars,2011-11-21 09:04:00,137,We went to bed in north central Iowa last night and woke up with hard water. Guess I'll have to chip the minnow bucket out of the ice!
1366857,rebs,2011-11-21 11:38:00,7587,"you have a fantastic view from your window, you must live in God's country"
1366963,Skywagon,2011-11-21 19:23:00,1106,"Gee Limey angler, make me homesick why don't you. If I had a camera down here I could send a picture of mud. Tell me you are not thinking about fishing Do-- Lake when the ice gets thick. I am with you, winter is the best time of the year, but the other seasons are not bad either.Connie, at this rate I think you are right, E. will have to shoot the moose."
1366987,Golden Eagle,2011-11-21 20:46:00,2642,I know exactly what you guys are feeling. We should have stayed up there for Thanksgiving.
1367018,Limeyangler,2011-11-22 06:07:00,563,LOL....'D' Lake is where i'm gonna head on Saturday hopefully....just a 15 minute skip down the 502.
