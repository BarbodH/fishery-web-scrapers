Turkey, fixins and football, are part of the picture for some, for others it may be gathering together with friends and families. Still others a day to plan for Black Friday shopping! So what does Thanksgiving mean? For me, I am thankful for my wife, son, family and all of the big and little blessings I enjoy! I have a very fulfilling career, I am able to take trips to Ontario, and B@B's and vineyards.So what are you Thankful for?"

A bit more demanding than shuffleboard, more skills & team effort but fun. Back in the mid 60's we had some world championship rinks from Appleton WI club. Right along with the Pack!"
