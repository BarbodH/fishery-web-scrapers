1368999,JDP,2011-11-30 10:01:00,1457,"I agree with everything Pooch has said about Mahkwa Lodge. Although I don't know anything about the ""laws"" he has referenced nor has Mahkwa staff mentioned anything maybe Pooch can elaborate. Due to its location on Lac Seul you have many many options for fishing. Which is a key consideration to my group.Been going to Mahkwa since 2005."

1369256,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-12-01 07:59:00,100,"Pooch, This place is has undergone a major facelift in recent years, very affordable, and is 5 minutes from Hudson Launch, and right on Big Vermilion - check it out....http://www.riveredgeoutfitters.ca/"
1369268,orchard frank,2011-12-01 08:32:00,1900,"I'm sure that many of the lodges mentioned are great operations. After 2 decades of going all over Ontario (and a couple to Quebec), we went to Lost Island Lodge in 1992 (maybe 1993), never went anywhere else for the next 13 years or so, often 2 trips a summer. Now our travel budget takes us to Florida to see our family and grandchild, or we would still be going there (plus we live in BaydeNoc area, great local fishing). Staff will make or break a trip, theirs is just the best. Accomodations, boats, docks, etc. all top notch. They care, period. Can fish far or near, on one 2 week trip, we decided to stay close the whole first week, often in sight of the island, and just did outstanding. Great opportunities to travel in protected water to the whole eastern half of the lake. Have a good trip, enjoy."
1369301,Mike Kansas,2011-12-01 10:25:00,1463,I have to agree with Orchard Frank. Lost Island Lodge is top notch and a great value. We have been going there for 6 years and I will never leave it until my ticker stops. We have been to 6 other Lodges on Lac Seul and Lost Island is #1 without a doubt. Mike Kansas
1369362,joeman79,2011-12-01 13:48:00,417,"Pooch, Lost Island Lodge is about 2 miles from the Hudson Launch. Shane runs a good camp. 30-40 minute boat ride to The Bear Narrows area and about the same to Grassy and Canoe. Cabins are not fancy but clean and well equipped. We are going back the first full week in Aug. Joe"
1370559,Pooch,2011-12-05 11:47:00,4619,"I emailed Lost Island, but never got a reply back. I had asked them about taking just two people and that I didn't understand what the rate sheet said about ""private Dockage - $18.00"". Does that mean they charge $18 a day to park a private boat at their dock?Where do you park your truck and trailer while in camp?Pooch"
1370690,BenBeattie,2011-12-05 19:11:00,232,"You park truck/trailer at the municipal boat launch near Hudson. It's really close to Lost Island. YOu would need a weekly parking pass for the launch, I think that's about 20 bucks and is available and several outlets in and around Sioux Lookout."
1370750,Skywagon,2011-12-06 05:56:00,1106,"Ben,Nice article by you in Ontario Out of Doors in the last addition. We need to get Pooch up here in the winter to try out those technique's, he would not need to worry about the boat, or which lodge to go to, just trade in the Lund for a Skidoo."

I didn't know you finished the hanger.Are you making holes in the ground or holes in the ice?We've been staying at Mahkwa on Lac Seul, but would like to see what else is available on Lac Seul itself. Trying to stay right on the lake and somewhere in that same area. Doesn't appear to be many options on LS itself. Really don't want to trailer in everyday. Nice to tie up for the night and walk up to the cabin.Have a great Thanksgiving, everyone.Pooch"

1368446,swany_jd,2011-11-28 14:25:00,9,"Pooch (or anyone else reading this particular chain), our group is contemplating staying at Mahkwa for our next trip. We've been staying farther south on the Lac Seul system on Pelican Lake (Frog Rapids Camp and Moosehorn) for the last 5 years. We found ourselves trailoring to the Hudson or Deception landings at least 4 or 5 of the 6 days however, so we're looking to stay a bit farther north. Any pros/cons you can provide about Mahkwa Lodge? Most things I've read (that are posted within the last few years) are pretty positive. Also wondering if anyone knows how far Mahkwa Lodge is from Bear Narrows. Finding Mahkwa's exact location on Google Maps doesn't seem trivial and the satellite images of the part of the lake are pretty poor. Any help is greatly appreciated! Swany"
1368466,BenBeattie,2011-11-28 15:10:00,232,Mahkwa is located just N of the narrows/entrance to Vaughn Bay (aka Whitefish Bay).
1368552,rdbalmer,2011-11-28 19:23:00,279,I've stayed at Deer Path Lodge a number of times and was very satisfied with the accomodations and the owners. You will have to trailer to the landing on Lost Lake but it is only about four or five miles from the camp. You are correct that there are not many camps in that area of Lac Seul. As far as the distance from Bear Narrows to Mahkwa Resort I don't know exactly but I would guess approximately 15 or 20 miles and it is extremely rock infested water between the two. We have had very good fishing in the area less than 10 miles from the Lost Lake landing and almost quit making the long run up north to the Bear Narrows area and west. It is a fun trip but the fishing really wasn't any better for us. Good Luck Rob
1368785,Pooch,2011-11-29 15:25:00,4619,"Mahkwa is a fishing camp. No more no less. Nothing fancy, just a fishing camp. At times it seems to be run by committee. That said, most everyone I've spoken to is pleasant and just regular folks like us.Last summer they were re-siding some of the cabins, but in general the cabins are at best average. Some have no heat or even a wood burner for the cooler weather or cold snaps in the summer. All have showers and stools in them along with electric stoves and refrigerators. The larger cabins have a freezer and an extra fridge on the porch. Which is a big plus for a larger group. The camp is quite adequate for most guys (like our group) that go there to fish, but maybe not for the occasional fishermen or most guys and their wives.It's a fairly long haul from the main highway to get to Mahkwa and sometimes the road is pretty rough. In the end I think it's worth some inconvenience as the camp is in a good part of the lake with few other camps anywhere in that area. I think most who fish out of that camp would agree.Like I said, ""It's a fishing camp"".I try to support the camp by purchasing my boat fuel from the camp and it's the same price as back on the highway. They ask that you not have gas cans setting around camp which only makes sense. Some choose to ignore that rule as it's not enforced.They also have minnows for sale, but are quite pricey. Again, it's convenient.The camp seems to be full most of the time. For larger groups they don't seem to put much thought into keeping groups needing multiple cabins close together. Last year we were scattered thru out the camp while cabins next to us sat empty. Which made cooking and eating together a pain for no reason. That's the only beef I've ever had with them. That refers back to my earlier statement that the camp seems to be run by ""committee"".The ""perfect"" camp is pretty illusive. Give these folks a try. You are on tribal grounds so will also be subject to their laws. Never been a problem.Long time till next summer!!Pooch"
1368954,wallydave,2011-11-30 07:17:00,2151,"Sounds like a place to add to the ""wish list"" Several questions come to mind, what are the tribal laws that you mention. Which leads to the question of how are they different from provincial or Canadian laws? Next would be how and who inforces the laws and how do we (US citizens) follow them at camp?"
