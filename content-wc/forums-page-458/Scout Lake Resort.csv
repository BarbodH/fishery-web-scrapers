I just find it interesting how all >of you are suddenly such nice guys that are willing to be >wonderful ""guests"" when you've been treated poorly and not >received what you contracted for. It seems that people have taken offense to your complaining about a resort and it's owner. This may well be because the majority of us have developed a GREAT relationship and a true friendship with a Resort owner over the years. Your demonstrated attitude offends those of us who can't imagine that their Resort owner could or would do anything on purpose to cause them a problem. I think that your problem with Scout is deeper than ""heat off"". I hope where ever you go now you can enjoy yourself and learn to accept that the world is not perfect and neither are the people in it."

572861,Guest,2008-04-14 20:07:00,0,"I have stayed at probably 50 resorts in my life. 6 on Lac Seul. My rankings follows. 1. Fisherman's Cove 1A. Evergreen 3 Lac Seul Lodge 4 Gold Pines 5 Scout Lake 6 Timberlane (or something like that) I have never stayed at SWW but would probably rank it high based on what I have heard about it. A good resort is one that offers the beauty of the outdoors, hospitality, as well as supplying you with a cabin and a boat. My top 4 I would go back to in a heartbeat. The bottom two were missing something. I do agree that Scout Lake needs to plant a little grass and take out the dead trees. Clean things up a little. No negative comments about the owner, but some constructive critism. Go to Scout, and then down the road to Fish Cove and you will see a green difference. I will also agree though that Lizzie is nice on the eyes. Small things, like sitting on a porch and looking at the water, mean a lot. Timberlane needed a complete overhaul. I think it now has a new owner. Hope he updates it."
572862,skindzier,2008-04-14 20:29:00,137,Stayed at Timberlane last year - Wendy & Vance have done a nice job since taking it over. There's 3 or 4 new large cabins that are great & they have nice boats as well. They're definitely willing to do everything they can to make your stay more enjoyable. We're going back again this year & can't wait!

Your the first guys that do your ugly american act at the border and just keep going for 300 miles. My job as a customer is not to endear myself to the resort owener its to get the most for my money. I'm sure most of you do endear yourselves. In Missouri we call that sucking up or brown nosing. I'm sure your the sames guys that say don't eat the fish just take a picture. I'd tell you where I go now and pay considerable less and get much much more but i'm afraid you tree huggers would show up and ruin it to with all your sucking noises.

572717,Mohleye,2008-04-10 07:35:00,368,"Well, in the spirit of this being a public forum, I would just say that expecting a campowner to heat an empty cabin all day is a little ridiculous. The cabins I've stayed in, and I've stayed in plenty, would hardly qualify for any energy efficiency awards. With all the comments and concerns people seem to have on this forum about trip costs and rate increases, I'm sure campowners are trying to watch their expenses. Next time why don't you try sending one boat in early to start supper and turn on the heat, or ask the campowner to turn the heat on an hour before you expect to come in?"
572727,jokerjim,2008-04-10 14:06:00,473,"If the resort owner turns the heat down when you leave, I don't think it would be out of line to expect him(her) to turn it back up before you return. To go a little further, why not turn the hot water heater down and maybe the refrigerator up !!!!"

572436,Guest,2008-03-26 04:11:00,0,Well digjig Lizzy is the one that turned off our heat each day and Lizzy was the one running the resort for the last two years we were there. The fishing on Scout Lake is good I just don't share your warm and fuzzy stories about the owner.

Well- I am sorry to hear that. We have been in business since 1984 & have a high amount of regulars that love the accommodations, service, & fishing on the Lake. For the few groups that were dissatisfied with my Father Rollie over the years there is always plenty of groups that found him very honourable, friendly & courteous. You can't please all of the people all of the time. Here is to my 10th year Owning the Resort!!!! Thank-you to all that continuing enjoying the hospitality that I offer. Here is to many more Years of Fishing!! P.S. My father has been retired for the past two years, but I am very greatful for all his help since 1998 ( when I bought the Resort from him). Just Remember Everyone: People can post anything when they do not get what they want. Look forward to seeing all my regulars & new clients for this up-coming Season. Your Truly-Lizzy Walsten"

572682,Guest,2008-04-08 16:37:00,0,"Lizzie may have owned the resort on the books since 1998, but her dad was the only one we saw. Lizzie was never there. I stand by my story that there was some dishonesty x( with the gas expenses. The cabin was spacious, the boats worked and we caught a ton of fish. I would not recommend the resort though based on the other issue."
572687,Guest,2008-04-08 20:28:00,0,"We have stayed at Scout Lake the last four years. This resort is ideally located and the walleye fishing is easy. The big secret is you do not have to go far to catch all the eyes you want. I know you won't believe me but all you have to do is go to the Bay of Islands and fish reefs and points off islands. Yes, you can go to the sand banks and points further but it is not necessary. The dock fishing at Scout Lake Resort can be very good. The water depth at the end of their dock is usually about fourteen feet, and what you want to do is slip bobber with leeches. My two sons enjoyed the dock fishing as much as the main lake fishing. Some evenings we would catch 30-40 walleyes. Largest was 28.5 inches. Lizzie is very friendly and helpful and gave us everything we needed. I agree Rollie could be a bit gruff at times, however I really liked him and he was the one that told me about the dock fishing, which I thank him for. Remember, you do not need to run 10, 20, 30 miles to catch eyes."
572344,longbear112,2008-03-21 18:45:00,4,We are trying Scout Lake Resort this year - we had been staying at the north end of the lake. We found that fishing was better in Mckenzie bay however it is a very dangerous boat ride. Does anyone have any feedback on the resort and good areas to try fishing. We are not real familair with this part of the lake. Thanks!
572349,Guest,2008-03-21 21:43:00,0,"I liked that area of the lake but did not like your resort owner. He nickel and dimed us, and then tried to charge us for extra gas on a boat that we did not use for days, and could not in any way be over with the gas. Watch out for him. I will never go back. As far as fishing, you generally will have to be about 45 minutes to an hour from the resort to find the main fishing areas like the sandbanks, big island or some of the other main points we fished. When fishing that area of lac seul, there is no going out for a half day, coming in and relaxing at lunch, and going back out. When you leave in the morning, you are gone all day. We did find that Scout lake had a lot of fish, and at night we trolled the weed edges and caught a bunch of fish. Good pike and walleyes in the weeds. From this area you will get to Broad and Sunlight, which are fun numbers lakes. Not a lot of big, but we had a few 100 ++ days in that area. If you do not have money down yet, call Fisherman's Cove."
572366,longbear112,2008-03-22 19:38:00,4,Thanks for the info Dave - Other than the gas was there somthing else that I should be concerned about? We are bringing our own boatso we should not have that issue. We spend most of the day on the water so we will not be at the resort much other than to sleep. Is getting out to the lake tricky? We boated from Timerlane Lodge to the sandbanks in Mckenzie bay and that was a 60 min boat ride with a 250 Optimax. Is it really 45 min from the camp to the main fishing areas? We moved south on the lake to reduce the boat ride - and a dangerous one at that! Thanks!
572367,Guest,2008-03-22 21:30:00,0,"I had a 60 hp and the other boats were camp boats so it took a while to get out there. You will still go 25 miles out to get to the back of McKenzie. You will cut that quite a bit with a 250. it is not too hard to navigate. Depending on the water level, you might not get your boat into Broad/Sunlight without having to tiller up your motor. Cabins were spacious. Owner a jerk. Just my opinion."
572379,Guest,2008-03-23 19:46:00,0,"Curious as to the comments about the resort owner being a jerk; especially calling the owner ""he""....we have stayed at Scout Lake Resort since 2005 and the owner is Lizzy Walsten-definitely not a ""he""!! have found her to be very accomodating. As for the fishing, we go first week of August and in my boat (1850 Fishhawk w/150 Yamaha)the trip back to McKenzie is about 35 minutes or so cruising on agood day, can take longer with a brisk east or west wind. If the wind makes a trip to McKenzie too rough, the Bay Of Islands, Shanty Narrows, Poplar Narrows, South Bay and Cedar Islands offer good fishing. We've also spent more time right in Scout Lake and you can find fish there as well, in the evening you can catch them right off the dock."
572380,Guest,2008-03-23 20:03:00,0,"I have not been there in about 5 years, but even back then, Lizzie would go to the sports shows to draw guys to the resort. Her dad Rollie (not positive but i believe that was his name) is the actual owner of the resort. We never saw Lizzie when we were there. We had two guys get horribly sunburned and went home days early. One of our 4 boats did not get used at all for 2 days, and another was only used at night for some trolling around Scout lake for maybe 45 minutes. We were going far, and with 6 guys left, we chose to fish three per boat in the outfitters rather then bring three boats out there. No way in %$%^ we went over on gas. It was a big argument and he was lying on the breakdown of how much gas per boat we used each day. Two days he had us using 13 or 14 gallons on two boats that did not leave the docks. It was not an honest mistake. He was trying to rip us, and he would not back down. We told him to call the police....we would love to share our story with the OPP."
572384,CDNWalleyehunter,2008-03-23 22:18:00,17,"Hi, I live in the Dryden area and fish lac seul often. I launch in Scout bay, with my boat. But my favorite spot is Williams Bay. Consitant walleye fishing with the 30""+ walleye that migrate in there from July to freezeup with late september producing consistant 25-30"" walleyes. Its hard to find Walleyes that time of the year that are under 18"" but 100+ days are always common. The only thing is its a rough road in there so I take one of my older boats. If I am looking at taking a nicer boat, I go to Scout bay and launch there. I have done well in that area, There is Big Island where there is a shallow long hump that comes up marked with boeys that produces some nice fish. I caught a 32"" walleye and a some nice 26"" walleyes off of there. Macintire bay is another favorite, you just got to remeber that Lac Seul has a good current to it that runs to the west. Look for narrows and points on where the current comes through, the walleye will be there. I never stayed at any of the resorts, but its good to bring your own boat, then you know you have what you want. Hey I have found some nice walleyes 10ilbs + when fishing structure and moving out 50 to 100 yards out from the dropoffs suspended, Look on you fishfinder for suspended fish, troll using a taildancer or shadrap. Take note of the colour of the baitfish that are swimming in the lake, with a darker coulour of a tint on the fish you might want to try yellow or gold coulours for lure selection. Good luck this year. You can't go wrong fishing Lac Seul."
572388,Guest,2008-03-24 05:59:00,0,Rolle is Lizzy's father. She is just as bad as he was. We stayed there for many years and it got worse every year. The final year was a very cold and rainy August. We would leave the heat in the cabin at 60 so it wouldn't be so cold when we got back. They would go in every day after we left and turned the heat off so it would take hours to warm up when we got home. Your right about the gas they find creative ways to get ya. Two days the final year we were without bait and had to go to town and buy our own. Never again. We now stay at Lac Seul Lodge and love it.
572421,Guest,2008-03-25 14:10:00,0,"I agree Rollie was rough around the edges and NOT customer savvy in the least. However, I think there are alot of ""colored"" opinions from when Rollie was running the show. Lizzie has always been the consumate owner/operator since taking over. I've seen her put 110% in everyday I've been there since she's been running the show. I've seen kids pull 26"" eyes from under the dock. Lots of eyes and pike in Scout. It is about a 10 - 20 minute ride to the main lake depending on your top end. Plenty of places to fish between Scout and the main lake if the weather on the main lake gets too ""big"" for camp boats. I will be back to SLR."
