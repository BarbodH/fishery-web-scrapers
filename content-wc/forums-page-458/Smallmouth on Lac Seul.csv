Last year we caught a lot of Smallies in the 18"" to19"" range and a bunch of 16""/17"" Smallies. We primarly fish for Walleye and take a shot at Smallies early in the morning or after supper during the last couple hours of sunlight. The Smallie has been a great bonus fish for us and It's only going to get better. Thank You Lac Seul Mike Kansas"

IMO the smallies outcompete walleye for habitat, especially early in the year when both fish are in shallower water. Smallies are very prolific and their population is certainly going up on lac seul. I hope in 20 years we're not saying 'Lac Seul used to be a good walleye lake'..... remember, smallies are not a native species up here."
1370935,Mike Kansas,2011-12-06 13:20:00,1463,"Good point Ben. To date the Smallie population hasn't affeted our Walleye fishing in a negative manner. In fact we have done better catching Walleye the last five years than we did the first 20 years on Lac Seul and those years have been the times that the Smallie fishing has become so good. I have noticed that the Pike population has seemed to diminish a little althought we do catch several 40""+++ Pike every year while fishing Walleye with a Jig. Lac Seul is a great fishery with many great Lodges. It is truly a gift from Mother Nature Mike Kansas"
