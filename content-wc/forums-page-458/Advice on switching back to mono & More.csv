1371581,Lonnie King,2011-12-08 11:46:00,17,"In terms of fishing spots, if you love walleye and big pike, I recommend Kesagami Wilderness Lodge out of Cochrane. If 15 lb powerpro isn't working for you, try going down to 10lb test, and try one of the newer braids. Sufix 832 is very smooth.cheers,LK"
1368435,Seanik,2011-11-28 13:49:00,218,"I'm asking for recommendations of mono line on a Shimano spirex. I have been using 15# power pro and it just doesn't come off the reel smoothly,especially when using 1/4 oz jigs in shallow water. I like the sensitivity and 0 strech of power pro. What mono line duplicates the characteristics of power pro and runs smoothly when cast? I know it's early to be thinking about fishing gear but I just sent in a deposit for our annual fishing trip, Kay-Vee lodge on Lake Nagagami a fly in out of Hornepayne, Ontario, July 14-21. We are now planning a 2nd Aug. 2012 trip and the list is getting pared down to the following: Flindt Landing Lodge, Niemos on the Gouin in Quebec, Cameron Lake lodge near Oba, Ontario and lower Twin Lake Lodge near Nakina, Ontario(per Solopaddlers Recommendation) Comments Welcomed! Seanik"
1368448,Mike Borger,2011-11-28 14:30:00,1554,"Depends on your budget, for the August trip.If finances are tight and you use Lower Twin as a base to fish some of the surrounding lakes, I think you'd do well.John and Karen are great hosts.(You'll have a great time at Nagagami)"
1368453,Golden Eagle,2011-11-28 14:47:00,2642,Give PP a chance by treating line and rod guides with Blakemore Real Magic. It works for me.I have a container in both my home and away tackle bags.
1368463,BenBeattie,2011-11-28 15:05:00,232,I always thought that P-line was 'in between' regular mono and braid. Less stretch then mono & very high strength.
1368480,Moondog,2011-11-28 15:38:00,362,If you are jigging with 1/4 oz jigs I would use only 8# Power Pro. 15 is kinda overkill and maybe the extra diameter is bogging down your Spirex. Use backer line of something cheaper. I have had no problem with 8# and have friends that use even the 5#.
1368493,lrpetp,2011-11-28 16:52:00,37,I have been using spirex reels for years and prefer copolymer
1368578,geareng,2011-11-28 20:44:00,335,"I don't use the braids because of the same reason you have mentioned, whether for casting jigs or live bait rigs, I agree it just does not come off the reel nice and smooth. I use 6# P-Line CXX and have been very happy with the results."
1368643,Fishoil,2011-11-29 07:53:00,1277,Ditto on the P-line. Here's a link to it if you're interested:http://www.basspro.com/PLine-CXX-Xtr...ct/30719/96464
1371315,Bitinlight,2011-12-07 14:50:00,95,"I use strictly the Shimano Stradic which is a more expensive reel than the Spirex. Use to jig 1/4 and 3/8 oz with 8# Fireline. Got tired of not being able to break off from snags easily, and Fireline does fray after awhile. Plus, Fireline did not allow for a smooth cast. Switched to 8# Northland Bionic Wallleye Mono and just love it. A soft line that casts easily and manages to boat all size walleyes. Plus, it is quite a bit cheaper than Fireline. Just watch for knicks when fishing rocks and timber like you would with any other line."
1371395,Larry Mac,2011-12-07 19:20:00,530,"Hi Seanik, I also fish Shimano Stradic Reels 1000 size and use Power Pro, Fireline and Berkley 8lb XT mono all with no problems. I also believe it might be your line diameter. Have a great year and enjoy your trips.Thank you,Larry Mac"
