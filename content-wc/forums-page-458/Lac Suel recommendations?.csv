1370216,SinOrSwim,2011-12-04 08:04:00,1528,???? I saw the highest price listed as $1200.00 per person for 7 days. How is that 30K?
1370241,jcd,2011-12-04 09:15:00,185,"Silver Water Wheel Lodge Rates 2012 5 Days: 6 Nights - 2 Angler/boat: $2,920 Is that per person or for 2???"
1370265,JDP,2011-12-04 10:05:00,1457,"Per person.If you look at the SWW rates, the rate for 2 people per boat is higher than the rate for 3 people per boat.Remember that SWW rates include (per SWW site): ""Accommodations in modern, spacious cabins with daily maid service, all meals from the afternoon you arrive, a choice of 3 different shorelunch menus, guide, boat with new motor, all gas and live bait, and a complimentary conservation fishing license.""I have never stayed at SWW but I know from observing on the lake they have excellent boat, motor equipment with guides that work very hard to help guests catch fish."
1370734,Steve of Madison,2011-12-05 21:51:00,230,"HOLY $$$$$$ I understand that the guides are great, the equip is great, everything is great! But really...at those prices it had better be!Thank goodness our group can cook, clean up after themselves, sleep in an unmade bed, bait our own hook and find our own fish. For those of you who can't do that, go to SWW and spend the $$$$$. My biggest difficulty with American plan is simple, if the bite is ""on"", I'm sure as blazes NOT going to go in just because dinner is being served. Don't get me wrong, I love my dinner as much as the next guy, but I don't go to Canada to eat and drink, I go to fish!BTW.......my entire cost for last years trip to Onaway, including license, extra bait (leeches & Nightcrawlers) groceries, fuel for transportation, the obligatory night at the Super 8 before going into camp and BEER was $1023.00 for 7 nights using the camp boats."

Bobbie is one of the best cooks (gourmet chef is probably better description) you'll ever find. If you don't put on 10# eating her food, check yourself for a pulse. They have American Plan, houseboats, housekeeping cabins, etc."
527340,Guest,2003-03-04 10:16:00,0,"Bill, Do a search for Mahkwa Lodge on this site. Been there 6 years in a row , on American Plan . Good Luck , Fred"
527343,alan ex pup,2003-03-06 01:38:00,126,"soolkut. We have been housekeping on lac saul for 20 years. now for a week with a boat and motor for 2 will be around after you add up all the taxes and licenses will be close to $800.00 for the 2 of you for 7 days, If you get a reasonable place. American plan is at least $1200 a person for 7 days. Doing your own cooking is not that bad and if need be you can always go out for dinner once."
527344,Guest,2003-03-06 23:13:00,0,"Lots of a camps on Lac seul allow camping. Depends on which end of the lake you want to camp on. White wing, Golden fawn, Lac seul evergreen , Gold pines are located on the NW secton of the lakeGood luck on your search."
1369458,Allen D,2011-12-01 18:55:00,2,"Just wanted to reply as we found out about silver water wheel lodge from a recommendation on this thread. We were at the resort in August, 2011 and it was everything recommended. Excellent resort, excellent fishing, excellent staff and management, we will go back next year and every year after that as long as we are able."
1369559,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-12-02 07:14:00,629,"Had a very enjoyable stay during the month of June in 2009. The ""American Plan"" meals by Wendy were exceptional! Reasonably priced & not obligated to a minimun time frame stay. They have a website under the ""Timberlake Lodge"" title. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1369587,Mike Kansas,2011-12-02 08:18:00,1463,"We have been fishing Lac Seul for 25 years. Have been to Silver Water Wheel 4 times and it is awesome. The last six years been going to Lost Island Lodge it also is awesome. Great food, fishing, service and friendly people. My wife loves the place and wouldnt let me take her anyplace else. PM me if you want to. be happy to talk. Mike Kansas"
1369605,Hump,2011-12-02 09:17:00,578,"Just curious, For that price, do they blow your nose for you too?"
1369663,tlars,2011-12-02 11:39:00,137,No tissues allowed. It's just a great value for what you pay.
1369698,dkrusin,2011-12-02 13:25:00,97,"WOW!!!! It would cost our group of 8 over $30,000 for 7 days at SWW. Why not drive a little farther North to Lake St Joe. Much less boat traffic, less cost and much better fishing. If you stay at the Oldpost the cabins, food, guides and boats are 2nd to none."
527331,Guest,2003-02-05 05:02:00,0,"Looking for an American Plan lodge to take my wife fishing on Lac Seul. We've looked at a few different places on LOTW, but she wants to go further north and try a new lake. We are probably only getting away for 4 nights, so we don't want to worry about bringing groceries and cooking I did find one place that looks nice: Silver Wheel Water Lodge. Are there any other places up there like that? Any other recommendations? Please include web addresses if possible.Also, having never been to Lac Seul, is there a big difference in what part of the lake you go to? When the wind blows can you get out or is it too big? Is there a part of the lake that's better for avoiding big winds? We want to fish walleyes and northern/muskie, and will be going the second week in July.Thanks,Bill"
527332,Jigger1,2003-02-05 07:43:00,234,"Bill,Silver Water Wheel Lodge is excellent! While I have not visited any other resorts on Lac Seul I can tell you that Mike runs a first rate lodge and guide team. I can also tell you that the likelyhood of you catching any muskies on this part of the lake are probably about as slim as your chances of getting into the lodge. I've seen some huge pike but our group spends 95% of the time chasing trophy walleyes. I don't know that I even picked up my pike rod last year as the walleye fishing was so hot and furious. Mike has a pretty good waiting list but I wouldn't let this stop you, give him a call and see if he can squeeze you in ... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!Jigger1"
527333,Mike KS,2003-02-05 08:13:00,18,Ditto...Silver Water Wheel is 1st class. That section of the Lake is a Walleye Dream.
527334,Guest,2003-02-05 09:35:00,0,does any one know there web site ? thanks Rick
527335,Mike KS,2003-02-05 10:23:00,18,Just type Silver Water Wheel Lodge into your search engine.
527336,Guest,2003-02-05 10:34:00,0,"For the best answers to your question, type in ""Lac Seul"" into this sites search engine and you'll get 1000 different responses. Seems like good ole Lac Seul gets alot of attention on this board. It's a fantastic fishery, but let me say, there are many, many similar lakes that don't get as much attention as Seul, but can even outperform it on certain days."

527337,Guest,2003-02-05 11:08:00,0,Could you elaborate on specific lakes that you might be refering to??
527339,Guest,2003-02-05 21:23:00,0,"Well, consider WW restrictions let me give you another choice that is excellent for couples.Andersons Lodge on Lake Minnitaki (souther portion of LS) is a first class operations with a great Amewrican Plan. Perfect for couples. You can fish their area or they run portages everyday up to LS with hugh boats and motors for their clients to fish."
527341,Soolkyut,2003-03-03 15:32:00,60,"Is it legal to camp out on those lakes (I mean ones with lodges), I don't exactly have hundreds or thousands of dollars to spend on a fishing trip and I really enjoy wilderness treks to catch nice fish"
