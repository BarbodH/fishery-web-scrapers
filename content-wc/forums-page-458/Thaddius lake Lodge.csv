1367100,JDP,2011-11-22 11:02:00,1457,"People will probably reply, but what you can do (if you haven't already) is to search this forum for ""Thaddeus"". There are 25 threads out there that may give you some information."
1367686,Skywagon,2011-11-25 04:25:00,1106,"I have been to the camp three times, but only to monitor the construction of the new owners quarters that were being erected 6-7 years ago and have not fished the lake. I don't remember much about the look of the lake, but they are all rocky, just some are more so than others. To look at the camp, it appears to be the typical cabins you nomally see (not new). I noted the drone of a diesel generator, so that is their power source, not solar. The condition of the roads in will vary at any given time. The main logging road's condition will be dependant on if they are logging up that way or not, it is a main road, so it may not be great, but it is all gravel and will be passable. If you are going in with a boat, drive whatever speed is appropriate and you will be fine, consider it part of your adventure and enjoy the scenery."
1367702,Stu,2011-11-25 07:04:00,472,"I fished there 4 years ago. Thaddeus is a kidney-shaped lake. No alot of structure, but easy to fish. We caught a lot of eyes off of a reef right in front of the camp. The cabins are simple and clean and are heated by wood burning stoves. There is a large culvert that leads to Moose and Ord lakes. We spent most of our time in Ord because it has lots of structure w/ numerous bays and points. We fished in June and had no problems going thru the culvert, but I have heard that it becomes impassible when the water is low. Thaddeus also has a good musky population. We were there before the season, but I say lots of them in the channel that leads to Ord. Rocky is a one of the best host's I've ever met and will do whatever it takes to put you on fish. Good luck - Stu"
1367864,Limeyangler,2011-11-25 19:19:00,563,"Good advice so far from all replies. I have caught walleye, bass and pike while fishing for musky...never got a musky all day, but there are some good ones in there, I have included some video clips of that trip including the trip through the culvert from Thadeus to Ord and a couple of pics from a buddy's successful trip for musky on Thaddeus and Ord below.I would be interested to know why or what is tweeking your interest in this camp given all the other camps up here, maybe with that info we could tell ya if the camp ticks all your boxes so to speak.http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/PB070009.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/PB070012.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/PB070011.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...h_MVI_4261.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...h_MVI_4262.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...h_MVI_4263.jpghttp://i263.photobucket.com/albums/i...h_MVI_4271.jpg"
1367906,Blue Lk,2011-11-26 06:56:00,269,"My buddy has a cabin on Thadeus LK,we were up there mid summer & water levels were low & make the culvert passage from Thadeus to Ord difficult for boats of any size.Water levels have dropped since & unless we get lots of snow & a wet spring I don't think the culvert will be passable next summer.My experience has been that the fishing is better in Ord & Moose lks.I am also wonder why you would choose this lake when there are lots of places with better fishing & easier access.Imho"
1367928,Hump,2011-11-26 08:39:00,578,"I haven't chosen this lake. a friend came back from there and was told that the walleye population is better than Lac Seul. I plan on going back to lac Seul, but was just curious to hear what other fisherman have experienced. I also thought it might be a good second trip, or third or..."
1367984,Limeyangler,2011-11-26 12:54:00,563,"Erm....i think that would be a statistic a camp owner on Thaddeus might want to be true...but i doubt it. No doubt there are good numbers of walleye in there, the one i got while musky fishing there was a nice size too. I would recommend it as a primary and secondary destination, great spot for day trip lake for sure. Another challenging but fun lake in that area would be Route Lake (has Lakers)."
