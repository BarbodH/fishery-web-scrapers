509509,Guest,2000-08-11 07:30:00,0,"We fished several lakes in the area of Lynn Lake. WoW! It was a fishing trip of a lifetime! Caught several hundred eyes from 19"" to 24"" Never thought it would happen to me but I got sore arms from hauling them in! Road was a bit rough up there, and boy was it a long way! But it was worth every bump and every penny it took to get there! We also caught trophy Pike. One 43"",one 42"" and another close at 41 plus. As far as pike, we could have filled the boat daily if we wanted to really fish them hard. Eyes were in 6 to 10 ' of water and really schoolin`. So when we found them, we called it happy hour cause thats what it seemed like! The fish up there are the most beautiful color we`ve ever seen. They`re a dark reddish gold, must be from the peat boggs around the lakes. We never saw another boat on most lakes and the fishery showed it. Again......WOW!!! Steelrider"

509512,Guest,2000-08-14 15:32:00,0,Where is Lynn Lake located in Manitoba? Heading on a hunting and fishing trip to Manitoba in September.Husker Walleye
509513,Guest,2000-08-17 07:17:00,0,"Sorry it took so long to reply.... We fished several different lakes. They`re names were Cockram, Ralph, Little Brightsand, Zed,and Vanderkerchove. Had our best luck in Little brightsand lake. For pike cockram was by far the best for numbers. We caught pike in all the lakes but Cockram is a flat bottom lake and lots of weed beds. Our best walleye fishing was on the Rat river Lake. It`s a man made lake 52 mi. long and thousands of islands. It took alot of tackel to fish it as there are lots of snags due to flooded trees. But boy when you found the schools of eyes LOOK OUT! Steelrider"
509514,Guest,2000-08-17 07:22:00,0,Oh and we camped the whole trip. We stayed at zed lake ....the campground was nice. Most lakes we could just drive to from there. Kind of a home base. Rest of lakes didn`t have much for camping. Lynn lake is straight north of Winnepeg as far as you can drive. We were 23 mi from Reindeer lake which is huge! steelrider
509515,Guest,2000-08-20 08:47:00,0,Was woundering what Wolverine Lodge charged you to fish. Was also woundering where you fished on Vandekerckhove Lake.
509516,Guest,2000-08-22 17:39:00,0,"Wolverine Lodge charged us $25 per vehicle, we had 2 pickups and 2 boats, so it cost us $50 altogather. The price was well worth it! They gave us a map of the lake which has the best places marked on it. Most of the islands on the lake had large numbers on them so we had no trouble finding our way around. Steelrider"
509517,Guest,2000-08-23 00:28:00,0,It's defenetly worth it been 10 different places in Manitoba and realy no compition. I can't wait tell I get back up there. J Nau
