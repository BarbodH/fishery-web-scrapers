509684,manitobawalleye,2000-09-02 22:34:00,885,have never stayed at the camp but it looks ok... nothing overly fancy... you would be about 6 miles from medical attention... the fishing is good in this area and I like it because you are never subjected to really rough water... lots of walleyes here... some bass but then I dont fish bass..... chance for musky if you know musky....the walleyes are always biting somewhere here within 4-5 mile boat ride... bouncers and spinners... jigs... cranks all produce... fair chance for 8lber.......even after severe storms u can always scrape up enough for a canadian shore lunch.... more info [email protected]
