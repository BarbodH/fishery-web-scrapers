Begining in 35' /50' and moving as shallow as 6' in darkness. Didn't catch many over 18"" but the 16"" - 17"" Walleyes were very fat and putting on the feed bag. Water temp. was 70. Clairity good with a resemblemce of algae bloom begining. Water level was normal to about 1' high. Pike fishing was average. Not as good as expected. A couple of 14 pounders released."

509581,Moose,2000-08-21 15:00:00,248,"We stay at Sunnyside camp next to bridge on Hwy 17. WWW.Sunnysidecamp.comWe used almost exclusevly Lindy rigs. Most consistent was slip sinker and plain hook. Also productive was spinner rigs with very small blades. 3/8"" dia. Green blades, orange hatchet, Northland fire tiger, hammered gold.1) Leeches2) crawlersWe do not troll with crank baits. I did catch a couple nice Walleyes on 1/8 pink jigs when they came into shallow water. It was easiest to drift with spinner rigs."

We caught several walleyes from 15 to 23 inches fishing for them was real slow.We had a storm come thru Sunday and Monday wasn't till Friday that things picked up. Heard of some bigger ones being picked up up in bigsand by trappers cabin. We fished over by pickeral Island mostly. Biggest northern was 36in with a few big follow ups. We stayed at Barbers and were did up well with a four bedroom cabin for the four of us! Gas was 80 some cents a lit. Candian and the best place to get it was by the tressle for the 45% exchange best to use a credit card then get the full 47% on it. Perch and smallmouth were wormy so let them go to be bigems.
509583,scooter,2000-08-27 10:00:00,226,I am getting ready to leave for Big Sand Sept 8th. We stay at Sunset Lodge. Sounds like fishin has been pretty good. Has anybody tried any night fishing along rock reefs with cranks? What depths during the day worked best?
