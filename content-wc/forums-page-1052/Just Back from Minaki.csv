509450,Guest,2000-08-11 09:08:00,0,We'll be in Minaki Sept 9-16. I hope the fishing I've been hearing about holds up. How much was gas up there? I heard it's cheaper at the little place by the bridge as compared to the marina. Has anyone stayed at his cabins and if so how much were they? For years we've stayed at Sunset cabins. Beautiful accomoditions and location but also a few more dollars a night. We've heard more than a few stories about equipment being stolen from boats at the Paradise Cove docks and have never had a problem at Sunset. We would reconsider our lodging but are uneasy about our boats and gear. Input on any of these would be appreciated
509452,Moose,2000-08-11 12:40:00,248,Pete and I will be going to Winnipeg river just south of Minaki Aug. 14-18. I'll send a report upon return.FYI we'll be at Sunnyside camp Keewatin. Alumacraft Trophy 185 w/Honda
509453,Guest,2000-08-12 13:26:00,0,"I stay at big north or barbers. they both are very nice places. I was just woundering were did you troll the cranks, were you in big sand?? The bottom bouncing fish is great, it seems that you don't get any little fish. I am leaving on the 25 th for a week and them I go back on the 16 of sept, I will post how we do on both trips. thanks bill p.s. do you have the g.p.s numbers for the spots???"
509451,Guest,2000-08-12 20:51:00,0,"Hairy Minnow-I bought gas at both the marina and the little place by the bridge, I honestly didn't pay attention to which one was more- Also, I have stayed at paradise cove 6 times since last september and have not had any problems or heard of any problems with stuff being stolen out boats.Now, that being said, the next time I am there I will probably lose everything.Rngrguy"
509454,IaCraig,2000-08-13 19:17:00,434,"We have always stayed at paridise cove1 resort, the cabins are nothing special but I like Duane. And I have never had anything stollen except one year a mink was taking minows from minowbuckets left out at night. Yes we trolled in Big Sand, but I doubt that what worked the end of July will be the same in September. However, lots a luckIaCraig"
509455,BobEaton1,2000-09-05 23:50:00,106,"WE leave on the 7th of sept and stay in Stienbaugh over night than off to minaki and arrive about 10am on the 8th of sept. I've been going to Paradise Cove for 16 years this year and have never even heard of anything missing from and boats or anyone having any problems at all. Last year caught a 11.6 lb Walleye and loads of smaller. Northern fishing was great tons of 10-22 lb fish and 5 muskies biggest 26 lbs. There will be 14 of us this year. Staying in House #1 north of Jacks Bait Shop with the Nebraska Husker white with big red N on it. We monitor channel 61 on marine radio. I run a Traga 2000 walleye boat, red, white and black- give me a shout like to talk to you. Great Fishing To All Bob Eaton Omaha,Ne"
509440,IaCraig,2000-08-07 17:37:00,434,"4 of us just returned from Minaki. We were there Sat 7/29 through Sat 8/5. We caught and released more 18 - 21 inch fish than any year I can remember. We did not catch anything real large, (biggest was 24 3/4 inches, 2 over 23 inches and a couple over 21). We did have a bigger one get away next to the boat with a reef runner due to a faulty drag on a line-counter reel. (my guess is 28 inch.) We fished leeches with bottom bouncers anywhere from 15 to 45 foot, and one night had the long-lining heyday of a lifetime on Big Sand in 200' of water. We were getting doubles and triples often, most fish were 18 1/2 to 20 1/2 inches. We honestly couldn't even let out 100' of line because we had fish on before we could let that much line out! We have been there many times so we have a good idea how & where to fish, but many days most boats were doing quite well. We had a hot calm day, as my brother in-law said it felt like we would melt into a pile of grease.I think the size and quantities were very good this year, as was the Labatts Blue. Happy fishingIaCraig"

Craig, at the risk of sounding ignorant, could you explain long-lining? Were you just trolling crankbaits or is this something else?"
509442,Guest,2000-08-08 19:53:00,0,"I was there thursday thru saturday- I can also saywe got into the crankbait bite-It was unbelievable, lots of doubles and triples. Just curious, were you staying at paradise cove on the front row, next to cabin #3?"
509443,IaCraig,2000-08-08 20:22:00,434,"Yes, my definition of long-lining is just trolling crankbaits between 2.5 & 3.5 mph with 100 feet or so of line out. I don't know where I got the term, but I hear it alot especially when in canada. RNGRGUY, Yes I was at Paradise Cove 1, but I was not in a lakeside cabin, I was back in #8. We were the maroon crestliner phantom with 4 guys in the boat. (a little crowded but we made it work). I'm 40 and usually run around camp unshaven with an austrailian camo bush hat & sunglasses. However Dale G. and his family in cabins 4 & 5 in the front were kind of with us. They are from Fonda,Ia with a bright yellow 16' boat. (Dale's son was with me) Dale reads Walleye central and probably will reply to this posting eventually. I've read some of your postings rngrguy, too bad we didn't connect while we were there.I have my reservations for Cabin #3 next year the week of August 4th, maybe we'll meet then!Good fish'n wishes to you allIaCraig"
509444,Guest,2000-08-09 10:56:00,0,"IACRAIG,We actually were staying at paradise cove II. We probably crossed paths a few times last weekend- There were 2 ranger boats in our group.All I can say is ""What a good time"" We have been there 3 times this summer and have a couple more trips planned this fall for the Lunkers. Keep in touch, maybe we'll hook up next year. Tight lines!"

509446,Guest,2000-08-09 17:45:00,0,"RngrGuy and IaCraig,Hi guys. We had 4 guys up there 7-29 to 8-5. We were staying in cabin 1 at Paradise II. This year seemed to be the best for numbers of fish. Last year we got alot bigger fish. Just like you said doubles were numerous. It was hard to get fish under 18"" to have supper, LOL. The muskies didn't cooperate quite as well though, but saw a 60 pounder.It is nice to put a screen name to a person on the water. I remember seeing that Yellow boat running around up there. I also remember seeing the two Rangers up there also, pretty sure we saw each other filling for gas. We were in a green 1775 Pro-V with a Yamaha. See ya next year,Eye' Hound"
509447,Guest,2000-08-09 20:14:00,0,"Eyehound-I think I remember seeing you at the marina one day, at least it was a green lund witha yamaha motor. One thing I have to say is minakisure seems to ""Lund country"" We felt alittle outnumbered. I can't wait to go in september!!"
509448,Tyee,2000-08-10 18:29:00,60,"Sounds like all you guys had a great week.Where is Minaki, and how far from Cleveland ?What are the best lodges on this lake ?"
509449,Guest,2000-08-10 20:54:00,0,"Minaki is located in ontario, north of lake of the woods and Kenora about 35-40 miles. I would recomend Paradise cove resort. $25.00 a night per person (american) for pretty nice cabins. Gas, bait, everything you need is right there."
