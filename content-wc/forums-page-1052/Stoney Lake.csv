509486,Guest,2000-08-28 18:49:00,0,"Hello, you deserve a response for spelling Stoneycorrectly. Although people have been arguing overthe spelling for 50 years. Did you know it wasonce called Salmon Trout Lake along with 4-5 otherindian names.The Walleye fishing success (mine) has dropped offsomewhat in August. I'm a diehard bucktail guy. Ifish weedbeeds in the 8 to 15 depths. I typicallydo not us live bait. Big walleyes in Stoney likebucktails. On Saturday night I caught a 26"" on ablack bucktail. It's only the 4th walleye I've caught from Stoney that size in 18 years. Bigones are 3-5 lbs.During holidays in the second week of August Ibroke down and used live bait. I had talked toa number of locals. I did what they did. Ifished 2-3 inch chubbs and shiners at the 45-50foot mark near mid lake shoals in the main basinof Upper Stoney lake across from Crowes Landing.I caught fish but they were all about 1-1 1/2 lb.Send me a note and ask specific questions on thelake if you can. It's hard to talk locations overa computer keyboard.Just a word of caution, on Sept 23-24 weekend there is a rather large Bass/Walleye Tournament.If you book that weekend or the next, you shouldexpect the fishing to be tougher because of thefishing pressure from the 130-150 extra boats onthe lake.Talk to you later about the excellent Smallmouthand Musky fishing. Good luck,BATMAN"
