It is a fly in lake on the Cat River system serviced by Slate River Outfitters out of Sioux Lookout, ON. Our group has fished a number of lakes on this river system but not this one. Does anyone have any experience with this lake that could give me some insight as to what to expect, depth of lake, presentations, locations, etc. thanks!Mike"
509207,Karl,2000-07-23 19:39:00,63,"Unless things haved changed, expect bullets overhead. Last year a boat from Faucett mistakenly ventured into Zion Lake and got fired on by crazed natives who figure it was their lake only. Ask your outfitter for details (and precautions)."
509208,Guest,2000-08-16 07:22:00,0,"Hey Karl could you please elaborate on this a little more. I'll be heading up to North Gull on Aug 18 and am wondering if I should pack a flak vest. I've been into that lake a few times over the years and never had a problem with the ""locals"". I know that Slate Falls Outfitters has a new camp up on the north end and from what I recall Vern has a pretty good standing with the ""locals"". They used to have ""keep out"" sign at the north end of the Gull/Zionz river and we had talked to a few of the locals without any problems. Hopefully this is an isolated incident and wont cause any disconcern.ThanksBob"

509210,Mick,2000-09-05 18:47:00,26,Our group just returned from our trip to this lake.(I wrote first inquiry on this thread.) Had a great trip with great accomodations. Outfitter(Slate Falls Outposts) built the cabin in '98 a year after the incident occurred that is reported in the story cited by karl-k. Outfitter has an agreement with the native family that has trapping rights to the lake. Native family has some summer cabins on the lake and every encounter we had with them was friendly. The outfitter is also their only air transportation back and forth to Sioux Lookout so they depend on him for transportation. We are already booked again for next year.
