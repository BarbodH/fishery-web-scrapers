Lots of fish caught (my boat had over 300 for 4 days, for me, that's good fishing!). Several over 5, some 6's and four over 7 for our group. Mosquitos and flies were almost non-existent. Fish were caught in 12 to 35 feet with most of the larger fish coming from deep water. Lindy rigs were the most productive followed by spinners and then jigs. Crawlers and leeches were bait of choice but minnows caught a few also. The leeches we got in Canada were terrible! I even caught a few on the power leech the last day after we ran out of live bait.Road construction was bad on 11 out of Fort Frances but there was none on 502 to Dryden."
509654,Guest,2000-08-28 21:12:00,0,sounds like a great trip. haven`t been up north for a couple of years maybe next year or the year after that--- maybe. Did you try to catch leeches yourself while you where there and would you happen to know if its legal. there are some beautiful leeches in those waters almost pumpkin-seed in appearance and with long shelf life. hardy critters indeed. thanks

Before it was terrible...thanks...also was your resort a nice place, reasonable,etc...our group is looking at new places up there. Thanks Terry"

Complete kitchenwith coffee maker and microwave. One cabin didn't have a bathroom but there is a nice building right next door with 2 separate bathrooms (with showers) and a sauna. The lodge and cabins are actually on an island about 5-10 minutes across the lake from the landing. They have bait, gas (mixed or staight), etc. at the lodge. I believe the rates were $50 per person per night. They have a web site but I have to dig it up if you are interested."
