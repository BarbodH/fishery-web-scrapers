509643,Guest,2000-08-24 09:55:00,0,Planning to head up to the Pine Falls and/or Selkirk area this fall. Which is better and what are the best times for each? Any tips on the how's and where's to fish these areas? Does anyone know where I can get good maps for these rivers? How about lodging? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

""the fishing hole"" ph. 1 204 5868021 is a good source of info. they are a local fishing store. they have some maps. my buddy don mabb owner of D&R tackle 1 204 3385209 is a good guy who might be able to help you out with a little advice and few deals on tackle. what works? 3/8 oz or larger.jigs with large minnows and stinger hooks. red/black or orange whistlers and crome or gold fireballs.big walleye bite very lightly.move your jig up and down about 1/2 inch very slowly to make it easier to feel someting just a little bit differant. that something is usually a big fish that can very easily go undetected.a slow bite needs a little slower hook set. set hard they have a jaw like an anvil try to rip his head off but only after you feel the hook start to grab his thick jaw and it feels like you are setting the hook into a sunken log. a big walleye bite sometimes feels like your jig has fallen into a cup of thick oil or mollasses.rattles help in dirty water. stiff rod 8- 10 lb xt or other low stretch line. #9 shad raps or deep down rattling shad raps. bigger is better. for pulling cranks use 14lb fireline. it's strong/no stretch and and keeps the shad raps at the right depth most of the time. boris, owner of ""pro/am tackle"" might be helpful 1 204 6683245 . there are fall tournaments on both rivers. all tackle stores are in winnipeg."
