509658,Guest,2000-08-28 20:36:00,0,Hello!If you decide to come up the next month and a half the fishing should be great. I haven't been there for a while but the fall used to be great. If Frank reads this he'll let you in on the specifics.Roger Mayer.

I do not fish Bass too much but there are some good catches I have seen. The Walleye in the fall run larger and are very aggressive. I fish mornings early here as I find it is better than the evening. Last sunday 30+ Walleye in a little over an hour,biggest 3#. I would go late June or late August. Bass I cannot help you out on.
