I fish the middle portion of the lake in the Riverhurst area and have had the best success pulling spinner rigs with crawlers, behind a bottom bouncer. It's typical of a reservoir in that the hot spot today, can change tomorrow if the water levels are fluctuating.There's no shortage of rocky points and almost as many flats. They all hold 'Eyes at some time or another. Use your electronics and start working the points between 10 and 18 ft. This should produce good at this time of year, although in mid August, I've often had good luck on the flats in water as deep as 35 ft. Good luck!"
