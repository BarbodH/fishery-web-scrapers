509673,Guest,2000-08-31 12:23:00,0,The lodge I go to in Canada buy all new 25hp Merc motors each year. Does anyone know what they do with the old ones and can someone buy those reasonable. They may have some kind of deal work out with their supplier. Thanks and keep the bobber bobbing and bait on the hook.
