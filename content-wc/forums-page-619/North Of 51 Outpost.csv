572624,Guest,2008-04-04 09:02:00,0,"Phish,Thanks for the reply, sounds like you do very well at Bow lake, however I was considering going to Nanos lake, have you ever fished that lake or have you ever talked to anyone when you were up there that has fished that lake. Thanks CB"
572639,phishfearme,2008-04-04 18:06:00,1242,"CB - we considered nanos - lots of water upstream and downstream - except that we considered the cabin to be too small for four - when a cabin is advertised as setup for four, it'll be great for two. (bow lake cabin is set for eight and handles four wonderfully - and even better now with the additions.) this is especially important for us since we like to do 10 day trips (we have a long drive from PA) - and getting weather bound in a puny crowded cabin does not make for a good vacation. although i have no personal knowledge of nanos (ask dwight or the previous owner jerrel for references) i can vouch for dwight and karen - dwight just loves to fly his own plane and will visit you almost whenever you need something - each cabin has a radio phone monitored closely by them. we've used many outfitters and he's among the very best. phish"
