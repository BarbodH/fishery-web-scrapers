572427,lobo1,2008-03-25 16:01:00,734,I thought I still had my Eagle but I now remember selling it on eBay when the ducer cable frayed. Was a great little unit for fly-ins etc My Garmin Fishfinder120 is just like it - you will like his new Garmin - very similar to the Eagle

572417,Mohleye,2008-03-25 08:19:00,368,"The math is too much for me, too. But all this discussion got me thinking about the original question, and also got me wondering what would be available for a replacement when the day comes. I looked at a couple websites, and was amazed to see how many had rechargeable 12V batteries, and their description read, ""Perfect for fly-in fishing trips"". I know there are some fly-in's with 24 hour generators, but many either don't have electricity, or turn the generator off after bedtime. At an outpost, would you really want to listen to the generator all night to recharge a stupid battery instead of hearing the loons you get to hear one week a year? The point of this rant is: does anyone know whether Eagle or anyone else still makes one that runs off of D batteries? Because all this is making me feel like I need to find one. My Eagle is getting old."
572418,Glenman12,2008-03-25 08:30:00,762,Mohleye My suggestion would be to buy a depthfinder with the rechargable 12volt battery and for $19.99 more you can get an extra back up battery that you can keep in your boat..as long as you brought both up fully charged you wouldnt have to work about recharging
572419,Pooch,2008-03-25 08:44:00,4619,Some outboards have an alternator on them even if they are pull start. I know Honda 15's do. If you know your camp's motors have this plug you could get the appropriate plug and connect your $20 rechargable to the motor and keep it up for the entire trip. Pooch

MOHLEYE - Check out the Garmin line - I have a ""fishfinder 120"" which runs for a week off od 8 D cells. The 120 is not in production any longer but still can be found. They now offer the 140 in a portable pkg as well as the 160C - I think both run off ""D"" cells come in qa travel box and have the suction cup ducer. here's one link I found:http://garmn.factoryoutletstore.com/...ID=13388298522"
572361,idapaul,2008-03-22 10:50:00,82,hey elmo; thats a pretty good idea. i like the hard case that humminbird has and bought a factory second off of the humminbird web site.also has enough room to tuck in my garmin etrex.
572363,lobo1,2008-03-22 16:08:00,734,"Same experience here too. I come home from a week of fishing and then use the D cells in a big flashlight. I am in the process of building a portable box that I will mount a 12v Lowrance color unit to - I think it's a 102C (it's on the bow of my boat and sees little use). I can easily put it back on the boat. There is a post here on WC describing the box that holds the little 12v battery etc. pretty slick. once this is built - the ""D"" cell unit will go to eBay >I have the same experience with my Eagle.

572369,dirt,2008-03-23 01:08:00,144,I always had good luck taking my ice fishing rig. I used a Vexilar FL-8 with a portable transducer bracket. Never had a problem with it running out of batteries as those things take very little juice.
572373,Pooch,2008-03-23 08:09:00,4619,"You folks get much more run time out of batteries than I can get. This is what I've learned and don't completely understand. Eagle 500C (820ma rating) running off of a fully charged 12v 3.3ah battery runs for four hours then shuts off when the battery voltage drops below 10 volts. If I divide 3.3ah by 820ma that equals 4.02. Are my assumptions correct? (3300/820=4.02 hours) If my math is correct then my results were exactly as one should expect with this battery and this Eagle unit. What I don't understand is this. Are batteries Amp-hour ratings figured by drawing the battery down completely to zero volts? If they are and my above assumptions are correct, why are they correct when the Eagle unit shuts off at 10 volts? Guys in our group all use fresh Duracell batteries and rarely get through a week on one set. Most use Eagle or Hummingbird's smaller units for our trips. If they are not religious about conserving they will suck up a set of batteries by mid-week. The older I get the more I realize I don't understand! Pooch"
572374,jerry bark,2008-03-23 08:11:00,822,"i would suspect that the power useage qouted is the maximum and only occurs when the backlight is used. I have a fish easy 2 portable and have used two sets of bateries in 7 years, to include two trips to canada and use as a bowmount finder on my small boat at home. if you turn on the backlight then you will not get it to run all week. take two sets of batteries and you will be fine for a week with minimal backlight use. cheers jerry"
572377,retire55,2008-03-23 11:39:00,1029,"Pooch: Here are current drains for selected sonar units according to info received from Lowrance: Sonar unit----Current drain with lights on----Current drain with lights off FE500C-----820 ma----520 ma FE480------430 ma----330 ma FE 2--------700 ma----500 ma X-85-------700 ma----400 ma LCX110C---1.7 a-----1.1 a Regarding your math, I think you're correct. Differences in duration times experienced could easily be explained by differences in the actual capacity at full charge. The only way to achieve real accuracy would be to measure actual current draw of your own sonar unit. According to an article I downloaded from the East Penn site, the % charge versus actual volts on a 12 volt Gel battery is: 100 %-----12.85 75 %------12.65 50 %------12.35 25 %------12.00 0 %-------11.80 I've been running a Lowrance X-85 for 7 years. Most of my walleye fishing is done at remote fishing camps where I don't usually have access to recharging facilities. Consequently, my sonar battery must last for the duration of my trip. In the worst case scenario (back light on for 10 hours per day) the X-85 would use 7000 milliamps/day. Since I typically only have the backlight on 25% of the time, I purchased a 33 amp-hr AGM deep cycle battery (weighs 25 pounds) to provide power to my sonar unit for 6 ten hour days. So far, I have never run out of power."

572387,Catman59,2008-03-24 05:21:00,345,"I still take my old Bottom Line Fishin Buddy. Its been to Canada as often as I have and still gets the job done. The only downfall is you have to pull it out of the water when traveling very fast. We use it for the bush lakes in camp boats , but it is a very good finder."
572389,thunderatwork,2008-03-24 07:48:00,79,"I also don't get near the battery life talked about here. about one and half to two days off the gel battery or one and quarter to one and half days of the ""D"" pack. I have a color 500C eagle. I usually have to run the backlite to see the screen."

Make sure you turn it off when not using and one set of batteries should make it. I just bought a Fishin Buddy on close out from Cabela's. $50. It runs on ""AA"" cells. 2 6 volts are a little heavy, I'm hoping the Fishin Buddy is adequate."

572347,Pooch,2008-03-21 20:40:00,4619,"Eagle 320 is a good to above average locater for flyin trips. Hopefully you have access to power for recharging at night or boats have electric start and can use their batteries to power unit. If using 6v or ""D"" cells take more than you think you need, two sets minimum for seven day trip. The ultimate battery conserver is an older Zercom flasher unit. Hard to find anymore. I can run two weeks on one charge with an average size rechargable wet cell. Truly wish they would start making them again. This is what they look like.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=104366 Avoid the ""Fishin' buddies"". They may be ok for a canoe, but don't work out all that well on a regular boat. Pooch"
572348,retire55,2008-03-21 20:50:00,1029,"IMHO, there are other more important questions you need to ask first. How many days will your typical fly-in fishing trip last? How many hours per day will you run your sonar unit? Will you have access to recharging facilities? Armed with answers to the above questions, the current draw per hour of prospective sonar units and any weight restrictions on battery size, you'll be in a better position to select the proper sonar unit and its power supply, whether its called a portable unit or not."

572354,idapaul,2008-03-22 07:07:00,82,i have a left over humminbird that i bought for 89 dollars and then went to humminbird and bought a portable hard case for 40. uses 2 6v cells and i get a full week out of them. always bring 1 extra battery just in case. finder is on from 6 am till about 9 pm every day.i prefer the hard case so the screen doesn't get scratched up.
572356,retire55,2008-03-22 08:36:00,1029,"I'm somewhat puzzled by the battery duration you posted. According to a fact sheet I received from Lowrance/Eagle, the FishEasy 2 sonar unit draws 500 milliamps per hour with the backlight off. In an 8 hour day, that unit would require 4000 milliamps of power. Eight D Cell batteries connected in series, to provide the required 12 volts, have a capacity of 20,500 milliamps (see http://data.energizer.com/SearchResult.aspx). Theoretically then, one set of 8 D Cell batteries could power a FishEasy 2 sonar unit for slightly more than 5 eight hour days."
572358,Mohleye,2008-03-22 08:57:00,368,"I have the same experience with my Eagle. I use it all day, every day. After a week trip, I've put the 8 ""D"" cells in the fridge when I got home, and used them again the next year. I always have a spare set, and I usually have to change them mid-week the second year. I have a small boat now, so I use the portable throughout the year, so it's a little harder to keep track, but I never had any problem getting a full week out of a new set of D cells. I do turn the unit off when travelling under power and at shore lunch."
572359,Guest,2008-03-22 09:01:00,0,I took my old Humming Bird finder and bolted the swivel in the inside top of a small child tackle box. Took the try out and now the finder rest on foam rubber when I transport the finder. 2 6-volt batts in the bottom of the box tied together and you are ready to go.
572360,retire55,2008-03-22 10:01:00,1029,Thanks for your response Mohleye. So much for theory. Actual practical data is hard to beat.
