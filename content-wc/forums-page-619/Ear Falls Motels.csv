572713,lazy eye,2008-04-09 19:39:00,3,The problem with hotels in Ear Falls (and Pat can attest to this) is that it is hard to get a room. They are/were working on the hydro plant and they are full of construction workers.
572715,Guest,2008-04-09 22:55:00,0,Best place to stay in Ear Falls is HWY 105 Motel It is far cleaner and much better run I have stayed there the last two years The owner Doug is a really great host
572732,Guest,2008-04-10 18:51:00,0,Merc How is the Travelers to stay at? Do they have a restaurant and how far is it from Red Lake Road? Scott
572734,Guest,2008-04-10 20:40:00,0,Yes they have a resturant and there is another one across the street. The Red lake road( Hy 105) is also across the street from Travelers. It is about 55-60 miles to Ear Falls.
