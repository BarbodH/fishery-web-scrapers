572714,Rich B,2008-04-09 20:43:00,1081,"Have been up to this lake a number of times over the years - got to love the ride in :) If you are going up in the Spring/early summer, get directions up to the falls. If you are going up later summer/fall, get directions to ""4 corners"" and fish the hump....as well, go up the river there about 1/4 mile and watch your graph...some times you can't believe the large fish stacked in that run ! When I was up there with my Dad, I pulled a nice 7+ blue walleye off that hump, as well as nice pike and small mouth bass. That was a good day. Also, when you're up there always check out in front of the red cabin (down towards the narrows on the left from Island 10) - years ago 4 guys each pulled a 10+ lb from in front of this cabin in one day - I never did :) Have a great time....Island 10 is a nice camp.
