Registration is going pretty good, and we're looking for more teams. There will definitely be a bigger field this year then last (only 29 teams in 2007). The official rules and information is available at www.fishminaki.com Entry fee is $400.00 per team and the tournament has a 100% payout after expenses. The rules for this year are basically the same as last year except for the penalty for a stressed fish. If anyone has any questions or comments, please post. J.P."

In fact, kids 12 and under can participate in our kid's derby off the docks free of charge with prizes for all."
