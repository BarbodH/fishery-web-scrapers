572712,Guest,2008-04-09 18:18:00,0,As a local business operator in the Red Lake area I can say that all business men talk. And what Ive heard and seen was that some of Nungesser Lake Lodges equiptment has been repoed. And the fact that they have an outstanding bill at my place and can not be contacted since last october makes it all that more real.
572810,Guest,2008-04-13 09:52:00,0,I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE DONE BASHING NUNGESSER LAKE LODGE. WHY DONT YOU JUST CALL AND FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT IS GOING ON.I DID!

572565,Guest,2008-04-01 16:05:00,0,Yep Equipment being reposessed today So if your booked try contacting Chad or Tanya quick
572567,Guest,2008-04-01 17:23:00,0,I recall about 5 years ago a lodge near Ear Falls burnt to the ground in early spring. Many people were booked for the season. The lodge owner never told any of his clients and they traveled from the states not even knowing the cabin they had booked was burnt. The lodge owner had his cliants stay at other camps throughout the Ear falls area. Many were dissatisfied and wre not given their money back. Hope this does not happen to you>
572568,moparlover,2008-04-01 18:55:00,2,"think i'll try birch point, looks like a nice camp from the water"
572569,moparlover,2008-04-01 18:59:00,2,"check this out boys, www.birchpointcamp.com"
572571,Guest,2008-04-01 20:09:00,0,Hi folks I have no knowledge one way or the other about Nungesser Lake Lodge. Chad and Tanya seem like nice folks and I hope all is well. I noticed this thread started out talking about Angler's Kingdom and some confusion about Angler's Kingdom perhaps not opening. I just want to make sure that everyone understands that Angler's Kingdom is DEFINITELY OPEN FOR BUSINESS IN 2008. (AND BEYOND).
572475,SSH,2008-03-27 14:38:00,526,Check out the Map Office. The Nungesser map is $9.95 + shipping. Here's the url for their website: http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/canada-maps/ I have used them for maps of other NW Ontario lakes.
572485,Guest,2008-03-27 22:03:00,0,I have heard recently that nungesser lake lodge may not be open this year
572486,Guest,2008-03-27 22:05:00,0,Does anyone know if this is true or have heard from the owners??
572500,Guest,2008-03-28 11:50:00,0,Haven't been able to get a hold of Nungesser Lake Lodge for over two months. What a horrible way to run a business - unbelievable that they wouldn't return our calls. We couldn't wait anymore..called Birch Point yesterday and booked our group there. They didn't have too many openings left - glad we called when we did. See ya on the lake Aug 2-9. Cannot wait!!
572501,Guest,2008-03-28 12:07:00,0,"Chad and Tonya are wonderful people, and they love that camp. I don't want to say anything about their situation. As personal things should not be part of a community web site. I only hope that others understand if they have not responded there must be a good reason. And leave this topic at that. I will be praying for them."
572525,Guest,2008-03-29 15:27:00,0,"Still no responce from Chad or Tanya at Nungesser Lake Lodge Finally gave up Called Birch Point this morning and got a spot on July 5 no luck in June How is fishing in July Owner said he would take us out to get us started, seemed sincere and very helpful in his suggestions Said they have been there for over 35 years Any comments on camp or fishing very helpful thanks"
572528,pike50plus,2008-03-30 07:31:00,584,"If this place is for sale I'm interested, anyone know for sure?"
572529,Guest,2008-03-30 07:36:00,0,"I HOPE THIS RUMOR IS NOT TRUE, I'M BOOKED WITH THEM FOR THE FIRST WEEK IN JUNE AND THAT JUST SUCKS.KIND OF LATE TO BOOK A NEW TRIP FOR THE SAME TIME,IF ANYONE CAN COMFIRM THIS PLEASE LET ME KNOW.WOULD HATE TO DRIVE ALL THAT WAY FOR NOTHING. THANK'S PIKE PRO"

572535,King Canada,2008-03-30 10:26:00,27,You guys need to be careful...it sounds like some of you are confusing Anglers Kingdom and Nungesser Lake Lodge.

However - I do think that a regular map would be much preferred for navigation. If you know exactly where you are going the ""hard copy"" map is available and the cost compared to the trip is marginal. lobo1"
572437,Guest,2008-03-26 05:50:00,0,"were going up 2nd week in july. I may have a map that we got from them. nice colored one, will see if i can find it. there may be a down loadable copy on there web site. nungesser lake lodge."

FISHED HERE LAST YEAR WITH LIMITED ACTION.ANY HELP WOULD BE GREAT,I WILL BE FISHING HERE IN EARLY JUNE. SO IF ANYONE HAS ANY TIPS THAT COULD HELP ME OUT ON THIS BODY OF WATER LET ME KNOW. PIKE PRO"
572177,pike50plus,2008-03-16 12:42:00,584,"Did you fish at this camp?http://www.anglerskingdom.com/why.html If not he probably is one of the best and most knowledgable aroung there. The Ontario fishing records show goos numbers of big pike coming out of that lake. It's on my ""get to list"""
572179,5richards,2008-03-16 14:13:00,131,My group fished there two seasons ago in July -- weather was warm --and water was low -- We stayed at Anglers Kingdom and I agree with pike 50 plus --Kevin Geary is the guy to see about big pike -- he has several articles on this subject and is a wealth of knowledge. If you get a map and look at the eastern end of the lake there is a small bay[Pike alley] which is just south of Big Bay--- we had good success in that area for pike -- also the middle narrows.
572203,Guest,2008-03-17 11:33:00,0,We caught big Pike and big Walleyes with Kevin last September. We definately plan on going back.The whole lake has marvelous structure.

572240,Guest,2008-03-17 18:10:00,0,"Last year our biggest was a 40"" pike. Biggest walleye was about 25 1/2. Lots of great structure and easy to fish. One of the other cabins had a 46 and a 50. I did not see them but the dock guys saw the pics on the digital camera. We stayed at Nungessor Lake Lodge. People that run the camp were nice. Have stayed at nicer cabins but they were clean. Boats ran great. Most cabins were catching a lot of fish. There was one cabin with guys who did not know a lot and were having a hard time finding anything to tug on their line. The owners were not at camp for a few days, and their longtime employee was running the camp. The guy had a head bigger then any Grizzley bear out there. He jumped in the boat with the guys having a hard time and put them on fish real fast. He did not do this for any extra pay as a guide. he did it to be a nice guy. Class act. My group is not crossing the border this year, but I would go back to Nungessor in a minute."

572401,Guest,2008-03-24 14:21:00,0,Same here have been trying to get them to e-mail back and haven't heard anything. About two years ago Eddie was the guy who ran the place when they weren't there for the year but he did not return the next year. wondered what happened to him. was a good host and would do anything for you. Last time had this problem the camp was in the mists of being sold. cant wait to go.always catch lots of fish.
572405,Mohleye,2008-03-24 15:18:00,368,Four Seasons in Ear Falls has a nice collection of maps. Not sure if they have Nungesser. You could try sending them an email at [email protected]. That address worked last year for me.
572425,Guest,2008-03-25 15:11:00,0,"605, WHEN ARE YOU HEADING TO NUNGESSER? I'LL BE THERE 1ST WEEK OF JUNE CANT WAIT.I TO HAVE SENT E-MAILS AND PHONE CALLS BUT STILL NO GO.THE TRIP IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY AND WE NEED TO FINALIZE A COUPLE OF THINGS WITH THEM.
