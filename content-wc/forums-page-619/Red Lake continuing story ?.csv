572216,AllenW,2008-03-17 06:27:00,11482,"Just wanted to say thanks for all the help, unfortunately it looks like this spring trip isn't going to happen. Buddy isn't going to be able to go with the added cost, and so far the quest for a replacement is coming up blank, getting vacation time or the extra $1000-1200 for the trip seems to be the biggest problem. Several have said a fall trip would be doable, so it looks like a trip will happen, just not this spring. At least we have several choices of a place to stay. :) Once again, thanks. Al"

Prob is the later in the year it gets, the harder for me to get vacation time off, but we'll see, maybe something will work out. hard to find someone who wants to go that far for a week, long drive to go for 3 or 4 days, cost is a factor too.

They have nice rooms and a place to park your boat with electrical hook-ups for charging batteries. It's not on the water, but the landing is less than a mile away. If I remember right the price was around $100.00 per night for two people. Each room has two beds, living room, complete kitchen, and a full bath, and a storage shed outside. We have stayed there several times and have never been disappointed. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Good luck."

Although Procyks on Gullrock gets good reviews. Now to find a body..:) Al"
572073,Goldeneagle,2008-03-11 20:45:00,78,"Al, I hope the body you find is a nice one and that she has her own money for the trip. Christmas in May/June for you."
