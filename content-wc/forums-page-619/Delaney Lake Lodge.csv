English River is an awesome walleye fishery, very hard to not catch fish. Try fishing below the fast water or below Maynard Falls. One way I found my spoys was to drive into a bay until I came upon the first sign of weed and fished them. Alls I can say is you will not be dissapointed if you get a good guide."
