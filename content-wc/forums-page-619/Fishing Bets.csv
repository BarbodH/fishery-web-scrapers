572644,Hawker,2008-04-05 10:46:00,3967,"After fishing the first, biggest, most bet for years, I got introduced to a new one last year that I didn't think I was going to like but turned into lots of laughs and fun. Have only used this bet Walleye fishing but I'm sure it could be used for other species as well depending. Was fishing with the lodge owner and his top guide on evening after supper and before we headed out they introduced this bet. Walleye (no matter the size) 1-point Yellow perch -1-point Pike 2-points Everyone antes $10 into a coffee can and off ya go. My first question was of course why, since we are fishing for Walleye are we giving more points for the Pike than the eyes. Their answer was we are not allowed to use steel or any other leader, therefore if you manage to catch and land the pike he ought to be worth more points. Didn't take long for the three of us to be on the minus side of -0- and it took a -4 points to win. Was fun, look forward to doing it again this year."
572695,Behr,2008-04-09 11:16:00,1240,"Try this... Pick a few key words to *not say* when you're out on the boat. 'Beer', 'Fish', Limit' are a few suggestions (or any variation of those words). Each time someone slips up and says one of the words, he owes the pot. (we do a buck) Obviously, you must have at least two to a boat to catch the slip-ups. By the end of the day, you'll have a nice pot going. Winner of the pot is the guy who catches the biggest Walleye. You can do this daily or per trip (per trip ends up having a realy nice sized pot) It's alot of laughs, try it! -Behr"

572566,kickback,2008-04-01 16:43:00,64,"When I was in grade school we started the bet,a quarter on the first walleye,a quarter on the biggest walleye and a quarter on the most walleyes.It hasn't changed to this day.I still have a couple of quarters in my fishing photo album from trips in 1961 and 1962."
572570,Rat,2008-04-01 19:46:00,102,The bets are great fun. My wife and I have a standing bet of 25 cents on the first fish of the day and first fish of the afternoon after lunch. The number of quarters near your fishing station entitles you to braging rights. First in the boat has started some loud conversations at times. The entire lodge knows the discussion and checks status with us daily. Rat

572578,Guest,2008-04-02 11:21:00,0,"We used this one several times. It was the idea of my brother-in-law's father who has since passed away, but I'm pretty sure he wouldn't mind. It's called dime an inch. Each person keeps track of the total inches of the fish he or she catches. The leader gets paid a dime an inch for the difference of the other totals. We did this on morning totals and afternoon totals for people with poor memories. I don't think anyone was ever paid what they should have won. It usually was carried over to the evening's card games. We eventually stopped using this because most all of the guys are from Minnesota and the totals they were used to were quite a bit smaller than what we caught on Lac Seul."
572584,Guest,2008-04-02 14:00:00,0,One of the games we play for a morning is called south of the border.We limit fishing to a part of the lake none of us has fished before. It requires us to search out new structure and fishable water.Standard $10 per man. We usually fish as a team in the boats

With gas prices going up, I doubt they continue it... but, I thought it was a funny way to do things. They said, if you got the pleasure of catching the big fish, you should pay more for the trip! They had all sorts of fun with it... big fish ""getting off at the boat"". They only lived in the Minneapolis area, so it's not too far of a drive."

572458,Guest,2008-03-27 19:43:00,0,"My buddy Gary had a group of friends that had a ""first guy to get up from the poker table to take a leak buys all of the beer for the trip"" contest. Guys started to wear Depends and all had to stay even drinking. I like a good Biggest fish contest, but i do not plan on wearing Depends for about...well...2 or three more years. One of my old bosses used to go the Athabasca, and they used to have a ""Home-Made lure Contest"". They had some on video of the guys throwing rubber batman dolls with hooks attached, the tail of a racoon hat, and the winner for biggest fish...a simple tablespoon with a split-ring attaching a treble hook. Simple and it caught a lot of fish."

572489,Frankm,2008-03-28 08:11:00,154,We bought a couple cheap fishing trophies. One for Walleye and one for Pike. Whoever catches the biggest gets the trophy for the year.
572508,Guest,2008-03-28 13:44:00,0,"Once in a while fishing gets a little slow. Somebody then ususlly call out ""buck on next fish"" to help get things going. That bet has evolved into the next fish hustle. To work the scam, first get a fish on, then let the line get a little slack and lay down the next fish bet."
572514,rpieske,2008-03-28 18:42:00,1276,"It's a buck for the first fish each day, a buck for the largest fish each day and a buck for the largest of each species each day. We post the dollars on the mantle of the fireplace and adjust each day of the trip. There is also a $5 bet on the largest fish of the trip overall."
572519,pike50plus,2008-03-29 07:32:00,584,"We usually bet $1, 5 or 10 on the most, biggest and somtimes first of what ever we fish for that day or mutiple days and have to sign the bills with a caption dictated by the winner on each bill. My most favorite are the ones I got from the late Eddie Johnson who played for the Cleveland Browns."
572526,lobo1,2008-03-29 17:35:00,734,We used to have contests on how many fish on consecutive casts could be caught and landed. We also had contests on how many different lures that fish could be caught on. Never bet much - dish duty - or fish cleaning/dumping of guts. Had some close ones. I know I lost one of the contests with 16 or 17 fish on consecutive casts....that was a big school of smaller male eyes!! no problem with dinner that day lobo1

572449,Guest,2008-03-27 12:10:00,0,If you catch the big fish for a day in our group the others have to wait on you hand and foot that evening. They must make sure your glass is never empty and after serving you they must bow to you and ask if they can get anything else for the greatest fisherman in camp. The bowing part really makes my back sore!!!!

They were in the construction trades and could tell a 24 inch from a 241/2 fish fish without a tape. Things will CHANGE this year"
