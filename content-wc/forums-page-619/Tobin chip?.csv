They do it in their off time. I think there's big money to be made with detailed contour data on the lakes in Sask. Tons of people would buy that chip. The problem is, it's costly, and VERY time consuming to do a proper survey of the lakes to be able to produce detailed maps. Hopefully some day we'll have them... Waxy"
572546,KidWalleye,2008-03-31 05:41:00,557,I have a the canada navi chip and tobin is on it. but after useing it i kinda wish i wouldnt have bought it. as i only fished the river and it is not on it. on the chip the lake starts down past Eagles nest and gave you a pretty good idea of the channel but was not very accurate. Gary
572553,uzzi,2008-03-31 11:58:00,349,"Yeah, that sucks, esp with no details on the river too, which is often more popular to fish than the big lake, esp for those fall hawgs! With Tobin being so popular, I really hope like the others have said that Navionics gets some detailed mapping on the lake sometime. I'd be first in line to buy a chip! Maybe that guy that posts from Navionics (Jeff@Navionics) should be alerted about this post/request. And like someone said, I'm sure its costly to detail a lake, no doubt, but I'm sure the market exists to recover costs......."
572556,Guest,2008-03-31 20:03:00,0,I was really fired-up to buy the chip but I might hold off now. I thought it would be great to find some new spots to try when I'm there. I know of some great spots but I'm sure there's alot that have never been touched.
572341,Guest,2008-03-21 16:02:00,0,Anyone have the Canada chip from Navionics with Tobin Lake on it? If you do does it have much detail on it?
572415,Guest,2008-03-24 21:15:00,0,I'm from Sask. and I'm pretty sure there is NO chip for any of our lakes. There are maps available but they are junk as the countour lines are measured in metres not feet. The best bet is to get a map from the town of Nipawin's website. It has a list of hotspots on it. Good luck
572428,Guest,2008-03-25 16:59:00,0,"I have fished Tobin a number of times so I do know where to fish. I was on the Navionics website and under the Canada chip it lists Tobin, I would guess it is Tobin lake by Nipawin. I just thought that if there is a chip for that lake it would be nice to have if it has decent detail on it."

572446,Waxy,2008-03-27 09:10:00,2938,"To the best of my knowledge, none of the lakes in Saskatchewan have had any type of a quality bathymetry map produced. I do know of a couple people that are working on it for the more popular lakes in the southern half of the province. I haven't seen the maps you're talking about, but my guess is that at best you'll get a rough shoreline map, the surrounding roads/ammenities, and some contour data on the surrounding land taken from gov't surveys. That being said, Tobin is a reservoir, so there might be some contour data that predates the flooding of the valley that could be used to provide a rough bathymetric map. Waxy"

572451,uzzi,2008-03-27 13:16:00,349,"I had emailed Navionics and they had sent me some screenshots too, didnt really impress me with the detail. I have a FreedomMaps chip I'm using and in my opinion it provides basically the same level of detail, basically just an outline of the lake/river, no contour lines, no structue, depths, etc, but it does show the above water islands, and none of the sunken islands. And the Freedom maps chip was quite a bit cheaper than the Navionics chip as well. I wonder if anyone from Navionics will look at this thread, as I'm sure it would be very beneficial to come up with some higher detail on Tobin, as its a very popular destination for many people across Canada as well as our American friends...........I know I'd buy a chip if it had higer Tobin details, I fish that system from May until the end of October"
