572648,fourize,2008-04-06 05:35:00,287,"Originally, there were 4 of us heading up in July...my Dad, my nephew and his buddy. My Dad and I are going for 2 weeks, and my nephew and his friend were going for 1. Now my nephew's friend has backed out, and he can't get anyone else to replace him. He can only go for 1 week because he is low man at work...he drives a Budweiser truck! So we are thinking, the 3 of us head up together, and my nephew can just come back to the states in a rental car. Is there anyone that has done this in the past...post 9/11...and was there any problems crossing the border in the rental car? Or can anyone steer me in the direction, where I may find out about crossing in a rental? Thanks in advance...Dave"
572649,phishfearme,2008-04-06 08:14:00,1242,"dave - only experience we have is renting for a round trip and the only issue was with the rental car companies - some restrict rentals to domestic only and charge more or have limits (milage, insurance, etc) for taking a car into canada. i would imagine rental car companies in canada would be similar but checking with them would be best. i'd bet that one-way drop off fees could be high. as a alternative, ask your outfitter if there is anybody around who would drive your buddy for a fee. may be a better option. phish"
572652,King Canada,2008-04-06 08:52:00,27,I crossed last August at International Falls in a rented Toyota due to a Head-on crash just North of Ear Falls. We did our Fly-in north of Red Lake and then had to get all the way back to Dryden for the rental. Insurance paid for it or it would have been way too expensive to consider. Dave and Margaret at Howey Bay really went out of their way for us. Crossing back was not an issue once I explained why we were in a rental.
572655,Skylane,2008-04-06 17:01:00,101,"Fourize, I have rented a car out of Dryden a couple of times and will be again as soon as it dries up and is fit to farm in Illinois. Both times I took a one way rental to International Falls and then picked up a one way rental there back to Illinois. The rental company I work with in Dryden will not do a one way from Canada to Illinois and would only let me go into the US as far as International Falls to their sister company. The problem with this was that the cost of the one way from Dryden to International falls, which is only about 120 miles, is nearly as much as the rental back from International Falls to my place in Illinois, which is about another 800 miles. I suppose part of the high cost in Canada is the price of gas here, which is always high, currently it is $1.17 per liter (3.8 liters per US gallon and the dollar is about on par right now). When is your trip, what area-lake are you fishing and what state are you coming from?"
572657,Guest,2008-04-07 08:01:00,0,"I've crossed over and back in a rental car many times, no problem."
572662,Mohleye,2008-04-07 08:45:00,368,"Aaron, Do you mind telling me which rental company you use? I may need to take a rental this year, and wondered whether rental companies allow travel into Canada."
572663,Guest,2008-04-07 12:07:00,0,We have crossed the border a few times using rentals plus hauling a small rental trailer. We were never questioned. We used Enterprise just because they had a large SUV for the 8 of us.
572667,ONE TIME DAVE,2008-04-07 14:41:00,110,"We have used a rental van for our trip the past 8/9 years without a bit of trouble. Never a question at the border, Canadian or US."
572675,Guest,2008-04-08 10:21:00,0,I have used both National and Avis out of the International Falls airport.
