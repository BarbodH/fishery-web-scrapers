Never having gone to Red Lake or NWO this early just wondering typical depths and structures Walleyes and Pike will be using. Excited because I know the Northern fishing should be way better than it is IN Late July and Aug. Any info on Lake and/ or Camp would be appreciated and welcome. Wasn't gonna make a trip this year but Charlie talked me into it. Had to twist and twist my arm. Thanks, Joe"

We've had some luck casting standard Raps in the Chkuni river also. We find lures that run 2-4 foot deep and natural colors like smelt work well for us. Try not to get the wanderlust, there's enough water there that you can spend lots of time going from spot to spot, and there's enough structure in that lake you don't need to. If you start to snag on the bottom, try and keep the jig a few inches off the bottom and every 10-15 seconds bounce it off the bottom to make sure where you are. Not much help, but we fish late fall and usually in 30-35 foot of water, not sure if that works in June or not. Al"
