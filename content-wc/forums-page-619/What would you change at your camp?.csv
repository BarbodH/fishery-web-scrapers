572555,Guest,2008-03-31 14:52:00,0,"I love the fish cleaning idea!! I hate coming in just before dark unloading your gear & starving knowing that you have the dirty work left to do. I would pay for that service, If they get the Y bones out also while cleaning I wouldn't hesitate paying extra. It's not being lazy it a vacation, you are saposed to be relaxing right? You can't tell me that there wouldn't be someone around the camp that wouldn't want to clean fish if they got all money for every fish they cleaned. Even if it was a dollar a fish?? the low end would be $50 a day at a well established camp. I love the camp we go to super clean and top notch people."
572558,Guest,2008-03-31 20:55:00,0,"The camp we are going to cleans all the fish for us Clean everything we want to eat, and package the take homers Would be nice to have a nice bar on the lake to go to at night Thats about all I can think of"

Taking that idea a step further... have big fish weeks... ohh also I'd like to catch the same number of fish but in addition I'd like to catch (and release) several ""trophy's"" a day. If a camp was able to pull all of this together, no mosquitoes and guaranteed trophy fish, I'd gladly pay and extra $25.00 - $50.00 per week. If I was a lodge owner Id already have a plan like this in place :-)"
572303,515,2008-03-20 09:57:00,254,"I'd like to see our camp owner putting a bit on money back into his camps. Been going there for 8 yrs and not seeing any improvements in the camps or docks. They just seem to be happy taking the money and not doing anything to improve the atmosphere for the fishermen. This will be our last year there, we will be switching to a new camp next year."

We have asked for several years about campfires,our Christmas newsletter said they were going to have some portable fire grills.So it pays to ask...."

Terry that's probably as important as anything else listed, where i go they have that attitude. for example the year they picked up all our groceries for us and had them put away in the kitchen when we got there, no charge beyond the grocery store receipt to make good. they also loaned one of our group a boat to use the day his was in the shop with an electrical problem. NO CHARGE, that was way above the call of duty there. maybe being a repeat customer who is friendly and pays fair prices without complaining has its benefits. cheers jerry"
572440,Guest,2008-03-26 12:52:00,0,I love our camp. The hosts are really good people and I've been going to this place since the owner and I were both young boys so it's been over 40 years. That said there are a couple improvements I'd like to see. Electricity at the docks: I don't like running extention cords New matresses. I asked for this when we checked out last year. I sure hope they have followed thru because it might influence future plans. Two weeks on those beds and my back is a mess. While our cabin is basic it is always spotless.

572285,Guest,2008-03-19 17:50:00,0,"The camp I go to has a gazebo, a public gathering place. It has a popcorn machine - free, make your own anytime. What I think would go over really well though is to have a pizza oven. The lodge (a separate building) is open until about 10 at night. I really think being able to buy a frozen pizza (pick it up in the lodge and just put it on your tab) and cooking it up on those cool nights would be a nice treat to go with after-fishing beers later at night."

My camp does not really need any changes, but some of the good things are: ice and bait coolers are outside so that you can get your own if you leave to fish early. pre-ordering of flats of crawlers for a really good price (new this year) was great, nice quality minnows, ice cream bars for sale in the store, fairly priced gas for boats. Oh there is one thing: good firewood seems non-exsistent up where i go, birch and pine just don;t cut it for me. jerry"

572291,DanL,2008-03-19 21:03:00,262,The resort we go to is great. The one problem we run into is not enough electrical outlets for our onboard chargers. It just seems like every boat has onboard chargers now. Every year it is the same problem. I also would not mind a bar at the resort to meet up with everyone and have a couple berrs and an appitizer.

572276,Bill Krejca,2008-03-19 12:46:00,6107,"I agree to the assigned docking spot. The other side of it that I have heard is that then the owner/manager has to settle disputes,or at least inforce the rule, and that is more work for them, another thing to do. At least one guy said he'd rather have the guests fight it out rather than getting ""involved"" himself!? The ""Ring of Fire"" is also a good idea."

572281,jokerjim,2008-03-19 16:32:00,473,Assigned dock space is a must for me because I bring my own ropes and bumpers to keep my boat from getting dinged up.Also having electricty at or near the dock for battery charging is nice. I think most resort owners do not pay enough attention to docks. After a couple of trips down south with their covered docks with power and lights you get spoiled.
572282,Obabikon,2008-03-19 16:48:00,2370,"It comes down to how many gallons of hot water they have... this is a fixable problem. Adding additional tanks, or a larger tank..."

572284,Guest,2008-03-19 17:46:00,0,"The camp I go to did exactly that up until this year. However, the economy and exchange rate forced them to stop. I can't fault them one single bit.

If all camps in the region did this, think of the affect it could have. People would have a choice of taking home two walleyes, or taking home 4 (2 more) for an extra 45 dollars. Everyone would end up with the conservation license."

Not having to deal with taking one in is nice. I have used an outfitter in the past who didn't provide them, mainly due to how they were used. Idiots would use them on the deck; sometimes right outside the front door, which then leaves oily residue all over. The deck gets ugly and slippery. The outfitter stopped providing them due to that fact. I certainly understood their reasoning. It's tough to ""legislate"" common sense."
