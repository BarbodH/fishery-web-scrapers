572512,Guest,2008-03-28 14:44:00,0,"Aaron I heard something about that from my brother. He like to go to the lake and bring work. He likes to drive the 3 hours and doesn't like to fish, never swims, nor hunt & almost never drinks, but he likes his paper work. He wants the access And Aaron we had some awsome big pike fishing there a couple days ago. For the kids i made a quick strike rig with a froozen sardine and about 100' of line tied to a javax jug.Set the line off the bottom and strech the line tight across the ice. When the pike picks it up it drags the jug across the ice. The closer the kids get to the jug the faster the pike takes off. No real real big pike ( too soon , better later in spring ) but when the kids have a 36"" pike on it was a lot of fun. With the 10 jugs we had out at time up to 3 of them would be getting pulled accross the ice You'll have to make time to be there in winter. It's so perfect"

572527,Skylane,2008-03-30 06:40:00,101,"Aaron, We moved to N-W Ontario full time this last fall. Like you, we just got wireless and between that, FAX and the phone, most business can be conducted long distance. I will have to go back for a while in the early spring and fall, but that is a small price to pay to be able to be have all this in my back yard. Don't discount cold weather either, there are activites here all year, they don't hole up like we do in the States."
572540,Goldeneagle,2008-03-30 18:49:00,78,Congratulations Skylane. You made it. ci
572545,ranger123,2008-03-30 19:54:00,19,Aron u going to fish the minaki walleye classic at the end of June.
572547,Skylane,2008-03-31 05:51:00,101,"Hi Goldeneagle, I have not had time to fish much this winter, as we have been working on the new house every day, trying to get it done, so we can move in before I have to head south for planting. Did fly in with a friend to a couple of remote lakes on Good Friday and caught some walleye and lake trout. Pulled the trigger and ordered floats for the plane, so this summer (in between landscaping) the options will be many. Stop in and see us."
572548,Goldeneagle,2008-03-31 06:28:00,78,"Thanks, but I'm coming through late May 15 or early May 16 and you'll be probably be putting seeds in the ground. July or August might be better possibilities."
572549,Guest,2008-03-31 06:43:00,0,"Ranger, nope..I'm not a competition fisherman and not a very good walleye fisherman at that. I fish mostly for smallmouth and muskie."
572491,Guest,2008-03-28 08:46:00,0,"Well, it's taken several years but I now will have a phone and high speed internet at my camp in NW Ontario. I have the pleasure of being able to work from home with nothing but a phone and broadband connection needed. Now instead of only being able to spend 1 week a summer up on the Winnipeg River system I will now be able to spend the whole summer. Don't you all just feel bad for me? :)"
572494,Guest,2008-03-28 09:57:00,0,"I read your sad story, but have one even worse. Been spending the summers on the system for the last 8 years. Don't need phone or computer, only have one for convenience, and sometimes I wish I didn't have it then. Most important things I need for the summer is my boat, my dog and my wife, in that order. Stay at least 3-1/2 months and would be terribly disappointed if we coudn't."
572495,Guest,2008-03-28 09:59:00,0,"Sweet, I'm probably younger than you though. :)"
572496,Roger Benoit,2008-03-28 10:05:00,93,"I work with a lodge on the Winnipeg River, on the Manitoba side. We had Satellite Internet hooked up last year, and it makes a huge difference. Probably a 50% reduction in fax traffic, and when you consider that its costing about $2.00 in airtime to fax or call, thats a huge savings. Now instead of calling out for stuff, we can use IM, email, etc etc. Have fun with it"
572497,Guest,2008-03-28 10:35:00,0,Maybe. But we were lucky and was able to do our first year there in our middle 40's.
572498,Guest,2008-03-28 10:52:00,0,>Maybe. But we were lucky and was able to do our first year >there in our middle 40's. Awesome! I have been lucky enough to have a Father who retired early and bought a place up there several years ago so I have been going since I was a kid. It's just been impossible to leave work for more than a week in the past but times are a changing!
572503,rpieske,2008-03-28 12:40:00,1276,"I have been retired for 8 years, and lived on LOTW for 4 months each year. Family, car, Boat, computer, friends, that's what it takes to make life a joy every day. Oh yes.....and muskies."
572505,Guest,2008-03-28 12:54:00,0,"We've only allowed sat tv at the lake last year, but it's only for football, and to baby sit the kids at night Internet hook up is still no were the future, unless as you have said it meant more time at the lake."
572506,Flip Silverlake,2008-03-28 13:26:00,645,I spend the summer on LOTW without having to work do to being retired! MORE TIME TO FISH!
572507,Guest,2008-03-28 13:35:00,0,"Brian, Canada Bell ran a line out to Harbour island (phone and DSL) and I have heard that wi-fi was available towards Minaki via a new tower that was built."
