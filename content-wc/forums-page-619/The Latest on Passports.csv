572488,Guest,2008-03-28 07:49:00,0,"If I don't get one, will I have to stay in Canada and keep fishing?"
572490,Guest,2008-03-28 08:42:00,0,"LOL, wouldn't that be a tragedy. Maybe I will leave mine at home this year. :)"
572516,Nimstug,2008-03-28 21:26:00,2605,"Yeah, it would be too bad if you ""forgot"" to bring the passport. Reminds me of a trip to the Boundary Waters a few years ago. My son was worried we'd get lost, to which I replied, ""What's the downside?"" :exactly: Nimstug"
572550,Guest,2008-03-31 08:14:00,0,Canadian customs might have to require a passport to get in. Or they may end up having to keep to many of us.
572551,Hammer Tyme,2008-03-31 09:36:00,293,It took me only 2 1/2 weeks to get my passport. Wow
572653,Guest,2008-04-06 10:00:00,0,">It took me only 2 1/2 weeks to get my passport. Wow HammerTime, when did you apply? Took my nephew about 3 months!"
572654,Guest,2008-04-06 10:13:00,0,"Wife and Kids applied 4 weeks ago and had them back in 12 days. Got mine last year took over 6 months. Don't know how they do it so fast now, maybe just way fewer apps. Either way no woriies for 10 yrs. 64 days and counting"
572660,Guest,2008-04-07 08:22:00,0,My daughter just got hers and it came in less than 2 weeks. We didn't pay the rush fee either. We did all of this throught the U.S. Post Office. Very nice service.
572672,Hammer Tyme,2008-04-08 07:20:00,293,I applied in the middle of March. I was told it would take quite a bit longer (official word)but thay also said you could expect it in 3 weeks. Looks like an error in my favor. I suspect that next year it will be much longer as it gets to crunch time.
