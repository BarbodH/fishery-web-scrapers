572729,Guest,2008-04-10 15:54:00,0,My brother has been to Miles Bay twice this week and caught a bunch of crappies both times through the ice....won't be able to do this many more times though....
572716,Fishoil,2008-04-10 07:13:00,1277,I've been invited to Lake of the Woods for a late May walleye trip and noticed that muskie doesn't open until June 21. Is it legal to fish for them on a catch and release basis before the opener or is that a big no-no?
572718,Bill Krejca,2008-04-10 08:01:00,6107,"I don't know whether it is legal or not, but folks who target ""a little early"" may not be real popular either with the camp owner or the folks staying there/those met on the water. Some people may look at this in the same category as eating 10 pound walleyes from LOW."
572719,Fishoil,2008-04-10 08:09:00,1277,"I guess what I'm really asking is if there is a catch and release season prior to the opener where it becomes legal to ""harvest"" a proper sized fish. Here in Wisconsin we have these seasons on a couple of species. I'm perfectly content to fish walleyes the whole trip, but if muskie fishing is an option I want to make sure to bring the right equipment. I'm not interested in doing anything illegal or trying to ""get around"" any laws."
572720,v-bay gord,2008-04-10 08:43:00,3168,"In Ontario it is illegal to fish for a species during the closed season. It is also stressful for the fish who are going through their spawning process. Unlike much of the musky fisheries in the U.S. which are stocked, Ontario musky populations rely on natural reproduction. In other words just stick to the walleye while you are there in May."
572721,Guest,2008-04-10 08:47:00,0,"If you fish for anything on LOTW you will more than likely catch a Muskie that time of year, especially if you fish for Pike. Just put them back like everyone else does and you will be fine."
572722,rpieske,2008-04-10 09:15:00,1276,"If you are throwing big baits with a heavy duty muskie rod and the MNR officers see you, expect to be stopped and perhaps get a ticket. If you are fishing bass type gear and small lures no one will question you about catching a muskie. If you fish smallies or walleyes that time of year, you have a very good chance of picking up incidental muskies. Try to release them without taking them out of the water. With a 54"" size limit during the season, it is almost entirely a catch and release fishery. Therefore.....no catch and release prior to the season. It wouldn't make any sense at all."
572723,Fishoil,2008-04-10 09:54:00,1277,Thanks for the info. I guess I'll leave the muskie gear at home and have to suffer through catching lots of walleyes. :rock-on:
572724,Guest,2008-04-10 10:23:00,0,I agree with all the above posts about targeting muskie before the season. Leave all the big muskey gear at home but you can go out and try to cast for northerns with mid size gear. Just make sure you do not handle the fish to much and even let them go at the side of the boat if possible. Canada does have a great fishery and I have had nothing but great fun up there so do not put yourself in a bad situation. Sounds like you are a true fisherman and would not want to over stretch the rules. Later
572725,Fishoil,2008-04-10 10:51:00,1277,"I probably won't even try for northerns. The week before I go I'll be at another camp further north and will catch all the northerns I want. Walleye on LOW is good enough for me, if I want to try something else maybe I'll look for some crappies."
