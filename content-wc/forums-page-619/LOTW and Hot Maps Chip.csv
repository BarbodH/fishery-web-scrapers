572484,Guest,2008-03-27 21:08:00,0,"O.K I know this has been beat around but please help me clarify. 2007 premium chip (north zone) has Canada side of LOTW correct?? Looking specifically for Sabaskong Bay area. I have the old black and white chip for the north zone and it has LOTW on it. I also have a black and white chip the is just a LOTW chip. Is there a difference between these two old chips? I need to get a new color chip and want to make sure I get the right thing. Don't know if I need the 2008 chip or not, I need Iowa so the LOTW + 2K does me no good. Please help me, I am confused?"

It has Iowa, Minnesota etc and Lake of the Woods. I fish out of Sabaskong bay area annually and the chip covers that area, and the rest of Woods. I'am not familar with updates to the 2007 or 2008 chip. Bob"
572557,Guest,2008-03-31 20:13:00,0,Thanks for the post. Would you happen to know if that is the same information for LOTW that the older black and white chips had? Also is there a difference between the black and white LOTW chip and the old hot maps black and white?
