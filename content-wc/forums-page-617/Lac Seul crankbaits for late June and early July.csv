573242,Guest,2008-04-29 13:19:00,0,"We are on LS every year about the second week of June. 90+% of our walleyes come from jigs, but the remainder is split between spinners and cranks. That split (or even the overall %) depends on the year as it varies a bit. As to cranks, I have had success when the walleyes are in shallow tossing a Rap X, Shad, or Husky Jerk to the shoreline. I don't get the volume that somebody does pitching jigs, but the fish I catch I usually a bit bigger in general. Plus, I will catch more bass and northerns (which I enjoy for variety). In 10 years, our second biggest LS walleye (30.25"") came this way by pitching a crank into skinny water. I don't troll in the evening and perhaps I should, but I am using a camp boat and just don't want to damage a lower unit and cause a problem for myself ($) or for the camp owner (putting a boat out of a commission). I might want to rethink that this June on a couple of bays where I have a good understanding of the shoreline. I will toss a crank at times to simply break up the day. I like catching walleyes, but jigging for 9 hours gets long. So, a few casts here and there even during the day breaks it up and adds a new dimension. What a problem to have, getting bored fishing and catching fish. Thank God for Canada so we have such a problem. Steve, I grew up in Madison, went to UW and now live in Iowa. I have enjoyed your comments in the past, keep them coming. Madison, great city---Go Badgers!....IA Walleye"

573082,mwal,2008-04-24 11:19:00,151,I have mainly used shad raps and x-raps during that time period. Late June and early July jigs and spinners with crawlers or live minnows out fished the the cranks. I just cast cranks for a change of pace and to pickup a smallie or gator. I will be there 7/3 thru 7/7 MWal
573132,kickback,2008-04-26 12:17:00,64,Nobody contour trolls crankbaits on Lac Seul in June or early July?Just curious
573164,Mike Kansas,2008-04-27 21:23:00,1463,"kickback, Our group has always dragged crank baits on Lac Seul in June and July. It has been the most successful technique for big eyes that we use. We have caught more 29"" to 32"" eyes dragging cranks than any other method. Don't get me wrong we catch nice eyes jigging and bottom bouncing but our bigger fish have come dragging cranks. You need to be ready for all three ways to fish. email me if I can be of any further help.[email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
573165,orchard frank,2008-04-27 21:34:00,1900,"We have had good luck with Hot N Tots. Casting and trolling. They catch everything in the lake, and work good for bouncing off cover. The Gold/pink color worked real well for us, but any bright colors seem to be okay. Also used Shad Raps, Husky Jerks. Agree with Mike, cranks will put some big fish in the boat, plus trolling is easy on those nasty days. We even have caught them suspended over deep water, but never worked at it much. I'm just guessing there are a ton of them out over the basins."
573175,kickback,2008-04-28 11:44:00,64,"Mike and Frank Thanks.I got ""bite"" by the crankbait bug last summer.It seemed we caught more fish some days cranking and bigger average size than live bait fishing.This wasn't in Canada though."
573176,worthsr,2008-04-28 12:04:00,52,"I fish Lac Seul the last week of June every year. Some years you can't beat trolling a spinner rig in six feet of water. Other years you need to get the crank baits down in 18 feet of water. Last year I had really good luck trolling a Reef Runner Rip Shad, the color is called bare naked. I bought mine at Bass Pro but I've seen them at Cabela's too. Our group has caught bigger fish on crankbaits the last few years. Good luck. Scott"
573177,Guest,2008-04-28 12:09:00,0,"This will be my 10th trip to LS, and I must be doing something wrong when it comes to dragging cranks. All I seem to catch is snags, Northern (which I refuse to allow in the boat), and a sore arm. If wanted to cast that much I would hunt for Muskies. I realize the pattern changes from year to year and sometimes a couple of times during the week but are you guys using suspending or deep diving and bouncing the bottom along weed edges and drops? I would like to try this method but all I get is frustrated and go back to what has worked for me."

Steve, I don't cast the cranks I troll them behind the boat as close to the bottom as I can. In fact I like it when the cranks bill hits the bottom occasionaly that way I know I'm in the strike zone. I troll just fast enough that whatever crank I have on causes a vibration at the end of the rod that assures me of good action. You can add action by moving the rod forward and than dropping it back which causes an erratic action that can trigger strikes I like to work flats, points and bays and have had my best luck in 8 to 12 feet of water in May/June and down to 20' in July/August It's also a great way to find active fish that you can stop and jig. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
573183,Guest,2008-04-28 13:37:00,0,"I have the same bad Lac Seul luck with cranks as Steve. I try shad raps, rougues, husky jerks, thundersticks, original rapalas, wally divers, etc. every year. When my buddies are still pullin em in with spinners and the cranks have no runs, no hits and no errors I loose faith and go back to what is producing."
