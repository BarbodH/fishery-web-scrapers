573170,Guest,2008-04-28 05:42:00,0,The next week has only highs of 8C and nights well below freezing. I think the big guy upstairs flipped the month on the calendar the wrong way. However it has the makings of big post spawn walleye. Can't wait for the season to open. Good luck.
573193,Glenman12,2008-04-28 18:21:00,762,"Rose I just talked to our resort owner on Cedar..he said the area got 12-18"" of snow and they have drifts of 2-3ft"

573310,Guest,2008-04-30 18:52:00,0,In talking to a lot of people/businesses in the area of Cedar Lake best guess on ice out would be May 10th - 12th on Cedar Lake. That's my plan as far as arriving and getting everything up an running what looks to be great spring for walleye etc. Days are not that warm arround 50 with nights still dropping below freezing. Not to worry Spring will come!!!!!!!!!!!!!
573327,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-01 07:24:00,116,I just spoke to Ellie on Cedar Lake about 10 minutes ago and the ice is black. It has been in the 50's for 2 days and will be in the 50's again today. The snow is melting and some grass can be seen.
573372,Guest,2008-05-01 20:02:00,0,Here is an ice out photo of Lake of the Woods at Morson - looking west over Brule Island The link - http://www.flickr.com/photos/26041299@N00/2455958368/
573394,Guest,2008-05-02 09:14:00,0,"I went to town this morning for coffee and the talk around the tables didn't sound encouraging. The owner of a local air service said the ice has been known to stay in Howey Bay until May 26 and he expects it to be similar this year. Of course it all depends on the amount of sun and rain we get. This morning I was on my front porch at 7am having a smoke and I could here the lake cracking, making ice, it was really depressing."
573396,Obabikon,2008-05-02 09:32:00,2370,Beautiful picture! I was told it'd probably still be a few days before it was completely out on LOTW.
573399,Guest,2008-05-02 09:54:00,0,"Anyone know the conditions in the southern part of Whitefish Bay? Thinking of paddling in at Camp Bay or Snake Bay on Sunday, and all I need are decent openings at the shore and between islands, etc. Maybe I'm nuts not to wait until the 10th? I dunno."

573095,GNO,2008-04-25 06:34:00,153,The ice is now gone on Off Lake (Clearwater/Pipestone Lake area). We are located an hour from Fort Frances towards Nestor Falls. The wind and rain did it's magic yesterday!
573098,Glenman12,2008-04-25 08:42:00,762,Thats good to hear..would like to hear some reports from the Perrault Falls/Ear Falls areas
573101,Guest,2008-04-25 09:40:00,0,"The sequence of weather the past 5 days is perfect for breaking up ice....we had sunny, warm temperatures, followed by a heavy rain, followed by a driving wind. If we can get another sequence like that, it could/should remove most of the ice from NWO lakes. NWO Fishing Bum"
573130,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-04-26 11:32:00,116,"My husband just got back to the states Thur. morning from our camp. Cliff is still frozen and so is Cedar. Jerry from Cedar called this morning and said they are having a blizzard and the roads are closed. I also got an e-mail from the previous owner, she's in Red Lake, and they already have more than 10 inches of snow. FYI"
573134,Glenman12,2008-04-26 12:29:00,762,Thanks for the update Rose...not good to hear
573135,GNO,2008-04-26 12:35:00,153,"We have got 8"" of snow already and it is still coming down. It is supposed to quit this afternoon/early evening and be just above freezing tommorrow."
573151,Guest,2008-04-27 13:59:00,0,Here in Morson on Lake of the Woods there is still ice in the bay in front of the Resort. There is open water around our docks and I would guess the lake should be open by May 7th.
573157,Guest,2008-04-27 19:23:00,0,"There is still enough ice on Lake of the Woods in Sioux Narrows to run a snowmachine across lake, I don't recommend stopping or making it a joy ride, but I watched our nieghbour run back and forth this morning. We received 12 inches of snow since Friday night, so ice melting has been put a side for a few days till all this snow is gone. Tomahawk Resort has been posting ice condition photo's around the Sioux Narrows area as well as few snow storm conditions, check there bulletin board, it's well done up."
573158,Guest,2008-04-27 19:23:00,0,"Any thoughts on when the ice will be out in the Red Lake area (specifiically Trout Lake) are appreciated. We're headed up for opening week and it feels like there will still be plenty of ice this year. I think 3 of the last 8 years we've had ice on some part of the lake for opening week and this year is behind all of them so far. Thanks!

573163,rpieske,2008-04-27 20:49:00,1276,I got pictures from friends showing the snow in Nestor Falls. That should slow things down a bit.
