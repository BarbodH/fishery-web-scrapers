572923,JDP,2008-04-17 07:39:00,1457,"Thanks Gary...altough there is a lot of great information on message boards, there is also some very bad information. It looks like everything is on course for a great spawn and season if the weather cooperates ---- water level should not be a problem. From the LWCB site on April 14th: The level of Lac Seul is 355.08 m (1164.9 ft), an 80th percentile level for this time of year. The lake level declined 3 cm (1 in) over the past week and is expected to decline 1 to 3 cm (about 1 in) over the next week. Lac Seul outflow will be reduced from 260 to 190 mÂ³/s on Tuesday, April 15th. JDP :cheers:"

572925,Guest,2008-04-17 09:17:00,0,"Thanks Gary....this is good news, all of those spots I found in '02 I would prefer to remain a mystery, not to mention the close calls with the lower units."
572926,Guest,2008-04-17 09:25:00,0,"thanks Gary, I will surely take a resort owners' word as their livelyhood depends on it. If you hear anything else I think we all would like to know. thanks again"
572929,Guest,2008-04-17 10:20:00,0,"I just got off the phone with the Public Affairs Advisor with the Northwest Plant Group of Ontario Power Generation. She said that she just talked to the Project Supervisor for the new Ear Falls generator and was told that they did not expect water levels to be affected by their construction. At any rate, the water level of Lac Seul is controlled by the Lake of the Woods Control Board. You can monitor Lac Seul and other lake water levels here http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Have a great fishing season. Ken Burton, owner Williams Lake Lodge"
572930,Guest,2008-04-17 12:38:00,0,"I called the LWCB and they are aware of the construction and the overall impact as they see it would be minimal. Based on the buildup from the spring-early summer rains in '07 and as posted by a few others, the lake level as it sits now is in good shape. This is the only response I got from several inquiries. Best of luck in '08 guys and be safe! Mike"
572931,Guest,2008-04-17 14:15:00,0,Thanks Gary! People should verify their info before putting it out there. Camp Owners are the most relable source for information. After all the Lake is their business. Thanks again!!!!! See ya soon.

572883,Guest,2008-04-15 11:14:00,0,"I read on aniother site that Hydro One will be dropping the level of Lac Seul 12 ft this summer in order to complete construction of the dam at Ear Falls. I looked at the Hydro One website, but couldn't find any info. Supposedly the LS First Nation has been contacted to warn of the low lake levels and treacherous navigation this summer. Has anyone heard about this?? Thanks, Mike"
572889,Guest,2008-04-15 13:30:00,0,I believe last year before the monsoons started the lake was around 6 feet low. I can't imagine what it would be like at 12 feet lower than norm. There aren't enough lower units and props in NW Ontario to allow this to happen. Could you give us the name of the authority that is putting out this information?
572891,Guest,2008-04-15 18:52:00,0,"Saw this at the Musky Hunter website. I have a call into a few of the Sioux Lookout based resorts, but haven't heard anything back yet.http://www.muskyhunter.com/forums/ge...rum/13088.html"
572900,Guest,2008-04-15 21:02:00,0,"The current and past lake levels can be tracked on this websitehttp://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html The over all Lake levels have been maintained pretty consistant with the exception of ""02, I think that was the Low year. Last year the level started very low but came up rapidly due to the spring monsoon season. If the lake level is lowered 12' below ""normal levels"" there will be several camps that will simply be left high and dry. I know from traveling around in the low year on LS it was an adventure, Rocks, Humps, normally sunken islands were sticking out of the water, nightmare stuff. But, I also looked at it as a way of discovering spots for normal years that everyone else motors right on by. That low year also turned out to be one of my best overall in terms of size and quantity."
572901,Guest,2008-04-15 21:12:00,0,Better yet would be to see the notice sent to First Nations! Know anybody there?
572906,Guest,2008-04-16 07:10:00,0,Here's a link to the First Nation website and contact numbers. I believe the Frenchman's Head location is the main office. I'll see if I can get some info from them today.http://lacseul.firstnation.ca/index....0Office&meid=7
572910,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-04-16 10:20:00,32,"Hi Mike, hope your winter went well. A friend of mine(lac seul band) emailed me yesterday and told me of this water drop notice. I have seen the lake close to this low, and it is a totally different world. Cabbage beds will be few and far between. Everyone will now see the rocks that they have been running over for years! Will you even be able to launch from Deception? I sure hope that hydro one has even common sense to let ALL species of fish SPAWN before they do this! On the positive side, the entire fish population will be concentrated, and that just makes the action even faster!"
572912,Guest,2008-04-16 12:47:00,0,"WHen this is confirmed for sure can someone post. We will need to know if we can land at Deception or have to land at Hudson public landing. Have 3 trips planned and this would change things some, for sure. thanks"
572914,Guest,2008-04-16 17:49:00,0,Guess the public boat ramp by Fishermans cove will be out of the question and getting into Broad/Sunlight lake areas. It was REAL scarry back in 02. Add another 2-4' to that and think I'll rent a camp boat!
572922,Guest,2008-04-17 07:28:00,0,I think there is a lot of baloney going on by someone with the water level info. Look at the water control board web site posted on one of the responces and you will find no such info. Talked to a neighbor on the board and there is no planed draw down . Lake is actually above normal for this time of year and the first ice flows started down the English river in front of camp 2 days ago; great sign that ice out should be about normal as we have great warm weather now with warm nights and rain yesterday.
