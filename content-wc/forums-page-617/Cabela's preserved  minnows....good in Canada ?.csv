573322,Boots,2008-05-01 00:10:00,19,Took minnows mixed with salt and boraxo soap. No comparison to live minnows.
573324,phishfearme,2008-05-01 05:43:00,1242,doesn't freezing the fatheads cause their bellies to burst open when being used? i did my own salting (with borax) some years ago and the fatheads would last about a minute before they burst open. phish
573325,jigman 2003,2008-05-01 06:21:00,981,"I've had about the same luck with home made salted minnows as I did with Cabela's preserved minnows. They are much messier however. If I have to have ""meat"" on the hook, I guess I'll go with livebait."
573340,SSH,2008-05-01 10:19:00,526,"The salt and sugar formula does not cause the bellies to burst. The mixture tends to get syrup-y, so we drain off the excess as the ziplock bags get less full."
573351,Lovetofish,2008-05-01 13:54:00,458,I use borax and pickeling salt. A little more salt than borax. But I don't freeze the bait. Just keep them cool. They work just fine. I'll try one bag with your sugar this year.
573360,Guest,2008-05-01 15:32:00,0,Have used salted minnows that I purchased at the bait shop. Using on a jig have had some success but not like the real thing. I have had much better success using them on a spinner rigs. Never ever had a problem with the bellies busting open. Pretty inexpensive adventure to try with the cost of everything else going up. Works best when the bite is so good when you can't keep bait on the hooks.
573375,Guest,2008-05-01 20:43:00,0,"I used them last year.They worked good,don't have to drag a minnow bucket around just put 2 dozen your pocket and your good to go.I'm buying a bunch this year.They are stiff but so is a rapala.Try them they are cheaper and they might work for you."
573435,Guest,2008-05-03 04:29:00,0,We tried them on lac seul last year. We caught fish but not like live bait... Try cutting your minnos in half saves money and works just as well as a full minnow... Jay
573225,Guest,2008-04-29 10:58:00,0,"Thinking of ordering some shiner preserved minnows from Cabelas. Has anyone tried them, especially in Canada ? Thanks"
573226,Guest,2008-04-29 11:05:00,0,"Can't help you but I was thinking the same thing this year. At around a $1 a dozen, they are worth a try"
573236,wiggle,2008-04-29 12:53:00,400,"I tried some for the first time last year on Lake of the Woods and Lac Suel. They didn't seem to work to well. They are real stiff and don't smell like a minnow. A regular twister tail or Gulp grub worked better. Go ahead and give them a try, just don't buy a bunch of them, I don't think you'll go thru many of them. Brad"
573238,phishfearme,2008-04-29 12:59:00,1242,"i agree with wiggle - using stiff minnows-in-a-bag-or-jar just doesn't cut it. every year i bring some, every year i try them and every year i tell myself these are a waste. stick with twisters and use crawlers to kick things into high gear if twisters strike out. phish"
573246,jigman 2003,2008-04-29 14:01:00,981,"Have had zero luck with them. Go ahead and give them a shot if you want, but don't be a dope like I was and buy them in bulk the first time."
573279,mwal,2008-04-30 08:13:00,151,I have used the Cabela's minnows twice on Lac Suel. The 1st year they worked fine and we didn't try live minnows etc. Last year the bite was tougher and they didn't do anything for us. Power baits out fished them badly pulling spinners or jigs. Live minnows out fished the powerbaits and crawler's regardless of the presentation. SO this year we are not bothering with the Cabela's minnows. Will buy live minnows at lodge and bring crawler's. Plus the border guard almost didn't let them in since they were not frozen and salted. He had to go back into the building with them for 10 minutes then gave them back and sent us on our way. Mwal
573283,Guest,2008-04-30 09:22:00,0,"I have taken them several times before.. I was always thinking that when we hit that major flurry and the minnows were gone that they would really be the ticket... Problem is, fish just dont seem to hit them. I have had much better luck with twister tails, worms, even dead minnows that are laying around in the bottom of the boat seem to work better than these and I cannot say why...:-)"
573295,Lovetofish,2008-04-30 12:39:00,458,Thanks for the input everyone. I've often wondered how well they work. Guess I'll continue salting fatheads. I know they work.
573298,SSH,2008-04-30 12:57:00,526,"I purchase fatheads by the half or full gallon from Vados Bait in the Twin Cities and use the following formula. Have been using this for over 10 years. I don't use them unless a plain jig/twister tail is not producing. But others in our group don't have any confidence with no meat on the jig: I make my own salted minnows. Find a bait shop that sells fatheads by the gallon. Then, put 1/3 cup of salt and 1/3 cups of sugar in a one quart zip lock freezer bag. Shake the bag to mix the salt and sugar. Then, add 1 1/2 to 2 cups of minnows to each quart freezer zip lock bag. Shake the bag to get the salt and sugar to coat the minnows. Flatten the bags and put all the bags in the freezer in large zip lock bag. Then, each day of fishing, take 1-2 bags with you in a cooler for the day's fishing. I have been using this for several years and they work great. The sugar really makes the salt less caustic on the hands and the salt acts as the preservative."
