572956,onemorecast,2008-04-18 19:13:00,23,"I visted LS Outposts last year for the first time. We had a cross up on dates, they had my group booked for a day longer than I had planned to stay. It could have been a dispute but Brenda handled it politely and provided a detailed itemized bill. It could have been a hastle but was not. Dan handled our dock, ice and other requests well and timely. I found it to be a nice place and we had solid but not great fishing (weather not location was the cause). I found it to be a good place and will return this year."

573159,Guest,2008-04-27 19:31:00,0,>Been to Lac Seul Outposts. Had terrible experience with rip >off owner. Fishing good / service terrible I went to Lac Seul Outposts in '96. Camp was really nice and the people working there were great. Had a problem with our bill and we got into a heated discussion with Ken and Brenda. We were told to never come back. We have taken houseboats out the last ten years. Stay between the Anderson Camp and LSO. It is a great area.
572918,Guest,2008-04-16 20:08:00,0,Can anyone give me the names of the top 3 resorts on this end of the lake. Would like to experience the fishing I hear about. Thanks for any help.
572919,IMWalleye,2008-04-16 20:59:00,35,"Here is where I've been going for many, many years. Great place, great owners. Close to a lot of fish !http://www.lacseuloutposts.com/ You boat in - approx 1 hr 15 min by boat from Sioux Lookout."
572927,Guest,2008-04-17 09:38:00,0,"My favorite topic: #1- what IMWALLEYE just posted - - Lac Seul Outposts/Ojibway outfitters. I have not stayed with them but have dealt with the owners and their bait shop in Sioux Lookout. I have heard nothing but great things and they are located by awesome fishing (world class walleye and musky waters) #2 - Sioux Lookout and Lac Seul Floating Lodges - houseboats in Hudson, ON. Both have very nice owners and will show you where to go. #3 - Lost Island Lodge- Again I have never been in there facilities but hear great things and i have been by their island many times and it looks like a great place (clean, nice docks, great resort boats, fun place) We have been on houseboats several times but always say we're gonna try Lac Seul Outposts. We normally stay in hotels and boat up the lake. cheaper and can make more than 1 trip a year but definitely more hassel."
572933,Guest,2008-04-18 07:00:00,0,Have been going to an outpost with Anderson's Lodge for many years. This is a first class operation and highly recommended. I'm sure their price is comparable to any of the others. They have two cabins near Bear Narrows and Chamberlain Narrows with fishing second to none.

572938,IMWalleye,2008-04-18 11:01:00,35,"Hey, Don't Go, Wow, that really surprises me. I've been going to Lac Seul Outposts every year since Ken and Brenda have owned it (20+ yrs.), and even before they owned it. My experiences have ONLY been terrific. Great flexible owners, great staff, great equipment and really great fishing. The camp is spotless and on a beautiful setting at Chamberlain Narrows. I've recommended Lac Seul Outposts to many people over the years, and I know they have become regulars."
572940,Guest,2008-04-18 11:48:00,0,I would agree Anderson's outposts are great too. My father-in-law has been with them and they are top-notch also. We have never had any problems with the folks at Lac Seul Outposts. Some people have bad days sometimes. Just sucks when that day is when you are there. good luck

Glad to hear you enjoy Lac Seul Outposts. We got ripped off by the owner on our charges and would never go back if it was the last place in Canada. Also didn't like hearing the owner refer to his customers as ""Here come some more Suckers"""

572948,Guest,2008-04-18 13:43:00,0,"Anderson's, Lac Suel Outposts and Lost Island Lodge are drive to places where you can bring your own boat. They are ""boat to"" outposts not flying."
