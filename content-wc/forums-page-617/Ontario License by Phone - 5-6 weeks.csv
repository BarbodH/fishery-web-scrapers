572947,phishfearme,2008-04-18 13:21:00,1242,i just ordered my licence via the phone (1 800 667 1940) and the agent said it'll take 5-6 weeks to arrive. take this into account if you want to get your license this way. phish
572978,Glenman12,2008-04-20 07:24:00,762,Did the agent say it would be 5-6 weeks because of the high demand?..I ordered mine in Feb and I believe they told me the same thing and I got it in 12 days..a couple of guys in our group ordered them late last month and got them in 10 days..lets see how long yours takes
572983,phishfearme,2008-04-20 08:53:00,1242,"a good point - maybe it's just the ""company line"" to say that it'll take 5-6 weeks. i'll post when i receive mine. it's not taken 5-6 weeks in the past - 2 weeks is more like it. phish"
573015,Glenman12,2008-04-21 10:11:00,762,"My fishing partner just called to order his...during the conversation the lady said 4-6 weeks...but the last thing she said was ""this will go out in the mail in about 2 days"""
573184,phishfearme,2008-04-28 14:08:00,1242,i received my ontario license by mail today - 10 calendar days (6 working days) after i placed the order. the 5-6 weeks statement is much more of a CYA than a reality. it's never taken more than 2 weeks. phish
573187,Glenman12,2008-04-28 14:56:00,762,thats good to hear because a couple of guys in our group of 12 were a little tardy in ordering theres..
573188,Guest,2008-04-28 15:01:00,0,i agree with glenn man pretty fast about 12 and that was by mail ! ss
573192,Glenman12,2008-04-28 18:19:00,762,2 of our guys who ordered last Monday got them today
