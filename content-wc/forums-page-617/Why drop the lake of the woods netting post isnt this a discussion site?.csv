573312,Guest,2008-04-30 19:45:00,0,That would be a question to ask the MNR. If you have a concern about things like this it's best to ask them. If a private guy is selling fish he is breaking the law. The guy buying it and reselling it is also breaking the law. If the Commercial fisherman happens to be native with a quota it's a different story. Being native in this case is a moot point. If you ask the MNR post a response...conjecture is not good in race relations.
573318,AllenW,2008-04-30 20:30:00,11482,"If those whinning about net abuse have them plainly marked and legal, they have a gripe, most the ones I snagged had no markers and after a few I used my knife to remove the lures, right after almost falling overboard trying to untangle one lure. What kind of insanity is it to start talking about shooting anybody or how ""bad and great marksmans they are""??? Sounds like somebody's ego is ruffled. Any post dealing with shooting anybody like this ought to be deleted, act like adults and we'll have no problems... Al"
573405,driftersifter,2008-05-02 12:36:00,109,"I have no problems with the native netting as long as they use the technology available to them at the time of the treaty, i think that would eliminate nylon netting and outboard motors. I kind of believe that would do a better job of protecting the resource. Driftersifter"
573408,jigman 2003,2008-05-02 12:58:00,981,"Should non-natives then have to fish with willow whips, carved bone hooks,line made of horsetail, canoes, no electronics, etc.? Why can non-natives benefit from advancements in technology but natives cannot? I'm not a huge fan of netting or spearing, but the annual threads on this site and others saying they can do it, ""...but they should use birch bark canoes and torches"" sure sound of sour grapes to me. They have treaty rights to do these things. I think it's time we deal with it."

573447,Guest,2008-05-03 10:34:00,0,Settling the U.S.A and Canada was the biggest act of terrorism in the history of the world. Yeah it really bothers me that those awful native americans or canadians have any rights or priviledges above and beyond you and me. GEEEZOO PEEEZO guys Get a life! They ought to give them LOTW and any other lake they want. A not so proud American and Canadian fisherman
573262,GNO,2008-04-29 19:00:00,153,"The netting is a reality and the Canadian goverment is behind them. Many feel they have the right and many don't. Whether it is right or not is a different story and a touchy subject with all, no matter what side you are on. It is a shame that the netting can hurt alot of the businesses on LOW, I know of a few camps on other lakes that buy their walleyes for guests and shore lunches from LOW."
573266,Guest,2008-04-29 20:31:00,0,I agree. I am good friends with a status native who takes up to 8 Moose a year. He is a skilled marksman. These animals are all spoken for. There are elders who because of disability and families who do not have a hunter. He looks after them. The same goes for fishing. He takes what he needs. This is the way it was intended. This man is also extremly knowledgeable in conservation. He is also generous of his time and friendship.
573267,v-bay gord,2008-04-29 20:50:00,3168,"About the only thing I would agree with is the fact that commercial fishing is very hard work, and to put out a consistent, quality product is even harder. I'ld be surprised to see more than a handful of people (native or non-native) that actually have the gumption to make it work. This whole thread is just here to stir the pot for reasons most of us don't care about. I think it should be locked unless someone actually has some factual information. Tourism is a hard enough business without this bullsh*t!"
573270,rembrandt100,2008-04-29 22:59:00,3,"I did not see the thread, but I have a question. After reading the above posts I am not sure what we are talking about. One post says it is a Native Canadian feeding his family and elders. Then another uses the word commercial netting. If it is a man trying to feed his family and elders, then more power to him. Dave"
573272,Guest,2008-04-30 05:54:00,0,I am familiar with the lakes around the Thunder bay area. There is some netting for uses as I spoke about earlier.It is for personnel use only. I have witnessed the native netters in the fall. They go when the sports fishery had slowed down. They have also had a lot of vandalism on their nets. As it is fall a lot of the boys carry a high power in the boat for moose. OMNR conservation officers are also aware of who is fishing in a lot of cases and why. The other issue is the age of the netters. Most of the fishers are older than 50 with few young starting out. I commend any native who follows this path. It is a lot healthier than others.
573273,phishfearme,2008-04-30 06:15:00,1242,"canadian guy - i'm at a loss to understand why you need nets to provide fish for ""personal use"" ie; your family. it seems you could provide all the fish you need with rods/reels which are much cheaper than expensive netting and rods/reels are also much much easier to maintain. i would even venture to state that rods/reels would be faster than netting - especially during certain times of year and at certain spots on the lake. maybe there's hugh family's involved or netting is just plain ""tradition"" but i kinda suspect there more commercial aspects involved than just the ""romantic"" subsistence justification. i agree though that the government's postion that the natives have a right to subsistence fishing/hunting - but shouldn't commercial levels be regulated? for the benefit of the resource? but it does seems enforcement would be near impossible. phish"
573288,Guest,2008-04-30 11:41:00,0,"Tourism is a hard >enough business without this bullsh*t! I guess we know what line of business your in. When you go up there fishing for your yearly trip, and you go to your favorite spot and guess what, there is a huge net across the best spots. I kinda leaves a bad taste in your mouth. After that, you can't catch a fish in that area the rest of the week. It's not hard to figure out that the more nets the harder it is to catch fish. I would think that the Tourism owners would get something done about this, because they are the ones that are going to go broke."
573292,Guest,2008-04-30 12:02:00,0,I have a cottage on that lake and im glad if theres even a notion that this is happening it is great we know so we can do what ever is possible.Unless u can put your gaurantte its not.Can you?
573299,Guest,2008-04-30 13:10:00,0,"Looking after ones elders and family with fish and game is not commercial fishing. They have this right. I know it's inconvenient for some and it does bring out some emotions in many. There are some native canadians that only use the rod and reel, others use the net. In the end it is the same. They provide food for their family. It is also their choice on the methods that they use. My friend is proud of his heritage and the path that he has taken."
573309,Guest,2008-04-30 18:05:00,0,Campfire Island on Rainy lake buys fish from natives that net on Lake of the Woods to feed their guests for shorelunch and Sportsmans service in I. Falls buys walleye from LOW from Natives and resells thems in the store. I thought they were only doing this for themselves and elders - why are these two places buying them if they are only for private use?
573178,Guest,2008-04-28 12:17:00,0,Seems weird jules
573189,Guest,2008-04-28 15:14:00,0,Maybe it was the mention of the use of a 30-06 to take care of netters. I agree with Juls.
573190,Guest,2008-04-28 16:26:00,0,ooops didnt read that not good.I agree if that was said thanx
573191,rpieske,2008-04-28 17:35:00,1276,Is it possible to drop just the offending post and not the whole topic?
573195,Guest,2008-04-28 19:06:00,0,"I believe Jules stated why she did it. It was an unsubstantiated rumor that could really hurt a lot of people. She told the poster to prove it with a newspaper article, magazine article, or some firm evidence. Apparently there was none. If that is the case, she did the right thing in getting rid of that post."

573235,Flip Silverlake,2008-04-29 12:27:00,645,Talked to a number for friends in Kenora right after this post hit the board. NONE of the people I talked to had heard anything about the plant or plans to go big time netting. The guy I talked to is very up on what's happening on the lake. I also have not seen it in the Kenora Miner.
573257,Guest,2008-04-29 17:29:00,0,"I didn't see the original posts with the gun thing in it. I can however assure you that netting is hard cold work and those boys are also hunters. They are very tough. They work hard to provide for their families and their relatives and elders. They are also not ""push-overs"".They also have the full weight of the Canadian Law behind them. They are no different than you or I. They are just trying to make a living and get by."
