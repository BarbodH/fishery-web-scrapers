573371,OHIOPILOT,2008-05-01 19:48:00,19,"Started to head up to Pakwash (Trout River lodge then...now we stay at Brownlees)) when I was 6 with Dad, that was 29 years ago. Back then the groups were bigger 15 or so every year and used to go spring and fall, now its just the spring. With the exception of a few years in MN and a few miles up the road at Gullrock been at Pakwash/Bruce all the time. Had to miss last year cuz of a new job but looking forward to this year again. Dad hasn't missed a year since I was 6 and they were headed up there well before I was. Vague memories of watching the clouds rise from the mine and waiting several seconds to hear the explosion while fishing on Bruce lake. ...not 100% sure but met 2 guys a few years back Warren? and Al? from Wisconsin??? Did you guys ever get out to Vegas to make it official?"

Higher gas prices may have my trips lessened in numbers, but my length of stay will likely be extended. Love it there, no plans to stop heading North..Eh.

573403,Guest,2008-05-02 12:02:00,0,I have been going for about 35 years now and also have always gone to Pakwash/Bruce Lake. My dad has gone for many years previous to that. I always remember hearing those explosions at the mine on Bruce Lake and trying to figure out if there was a thunder storm approaching or if it was just an explosion at the mine.. How was your fall fishing at Pakwash? I have always been in the spring/early summer; but have always wanted to go up in the summer/fall periods. Are the bugs better or worse? What about the weather??
573425,Guest,2008-05-02 18:33:00,0,20 trips out of the last 23 years.Our last time up was '05.

I am now on a string of 6 years in a row, now going twice a year. On this last string I have always brought my son. He was 9 when we started it. I envy all you guys that have put 20+ straight years together. But when I am up in the great walleye lake in the sky and hear my son talking to his son about all the great Canada fishing trips he had with me..........well, let's say that's all that will matter. I hope everyone keeps their streaks going for years and years! JohnB.O.A.T."

Uncle Larry went with us every year until this one. He is the best dam guide you can ask for...and did I mention he is my brother! This year ole' Pete and I will be on our first adventure w/out Uncle Lar. Sucks to be Uncle Lar! Remember the ""Ice Cream"" joke! (Nhey Buddy!)"

Buddy went through a divorce and set him behind. I am looking forward to the next trip up, might have to find a new partner,lol. We have always stayed at the campground over the years, the fishing has always been good and meeting up with some of the same people that go year after year........its a long haul up to Reed Lake.

573021,Obabikon,2008-04-21 12:33:00,2370,Wingmann... was that with George and Janet? (at Pine Island) He's a riot!
573032,Guest,2008-04-21 18:49:00,0,"Yep, we actually grew up in the same town but didn't know George until we went to his resort. Had some really great times at his place. George and Janet ran a great camp. Only wished we could have fished with George a little more. The last year we were up there he made a habit of taking his guests out at least one evening. Can't say enough good things about him. He really made our trips fun. Even got him and a couple of the girls to sit in on a card game one time. We got lucky and saw him at the Schaumburg show. It was really great talking to him. Haven't seen him for over 10 years. I think he called your camp the Holiday Inn (back in the eighties Holiday Inn was considered top of the line) and he said his camp was more like Howard Johnsons or motel 6. Take care and I hope you get your camp to where your father had it back in the eighties. Wingmann17"
573042,fourize,2008-04-22 04:26:00,287,"This year will be the 15th straight year that my Dad and I have gone to Canada, and the same camp. Dad is 77 and slowing down, but we will keep going as long as he is able. We have made alot of cherished memories, with more to come...that's what it's all about."

572824,Guest,2008-04-13 22:40:00,0,"Made my first trip up to Lake of the Woods with my Grandfather back in 1969 Boy have things ever changed since that trip We had a 18 foot wooden boat and a hunk of junk, 1965 18 hp motor And stayed in a shack that had no water, no dock, plank beds with 1 inch foam,cooked on the wood stove and coal oil lights Probably the best trip I ever had, because then, I was not expecting all the things that I now expect"
572825,esgrams,2008-04-13 23:59:00,92,"Reminds me of a story about Bob--Dad, being a farmer was a pretty decent mechanic, and he would always tune our rented boat motor so it would idle down nice to troll...So, Bob discovers this and kept giving us different motors all week and Dad would get them out in the morning,,talk to himself about the blanking blank motor and get it tuned up again--After three days of this, Dad-finally mentions something to Bob, that he needed to maybe give his motors some attention. Bob's response was--I have been all week, the other guests were complaining about their motors and I've been giving them to you to see if they were actually bad or the guest didn't know what they were talking about.. The look on my father's face was priceless...We still bring that up every year, especially now that we all have our own boats and his was the one to break down last year..Good memories..Eric"
572826,walleyeranae,2008-04-14 00:48:00,2,"i was born in july of 1982, my first fishing trip was in august :-) my dad (walleyesam - passed away 1/1/08) took me at least once a year until i graduated from high school - i skipped a few years but was lucky enough to go last september on what would be my dad's final trip. i'm carrying on the legacy by taking my husband on his second trip this coming september. it will be somewhere around my 20th trip - i'll be 26 in july"

572843,Guest,2008-04-14 11:58:00,0,"I got married in 75 and the first trip was in 77 or 78. The Mrs. and I slept in the back of the truck in sleeping bags for a week. We missed a few years after that and had a couple kids. When they hit eight and six, we started going again and have only missed one year since. I fell off a house the summer we missed. I would have rather been fishing. I'm not much for math, but I think that comes up to about 22 years including this year God willing. Still got the same Mrs. too. Good things don't change much."

I'll pass on the story about Bob and your Dad. I know everyone will get a good chuckle out of that one. Sounds like something Bob would do. Free tune-ups for his motors. He had that sense of humor."
572782,Guest,2008-04-12 12:27:00,0,"Hi. I started as a kid also, about 6 I would guess. my father made straps to keep us from throwing the rod and reel into the water when we were learning to cast. I was always winding up the reel the wrong direction. I am 61 now so that would be about 1953. No expressways from chicago then. we would stay at places like red deer lodge and rainy river camp. red deer lodge is there but I dont know about rainy river lodge. the boats were all wood and my big brother would be the trolling motor with oars. then we moved up to the big time, we would get a 2 or 3 HP jhonson motor with the gas tank in the motor and reverse was swinging the motor 180 degrees around. a big improvement from rowing. when i had kids we started going up for ever again. Now we are out in henderson nevada. I miss going to canada. time marches on though. have fun while you can."
572783,Mike Kansas,2008-04-12 12:59:00,1463,"My first trip was when I was 10 years old (1955). So that means that when I set foot in Canada this June it will be 53 years. Every trip I have made has been an awesome experience. I have had the great fortune of meeting many just plain good people who share having fishing in their blood like I do. Many hours have been spent on the water and around the campfire with friends and family developing stories and friendships and love that I will take with me to eternity. Outside of my family Canada and it's bountiful gifts are #1 for me. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
572785,AllenW,2008-04-12 13:23:00,11482,"About 1966 or so was first trip, did the trip for a few years then missed until about 1980, and made it just about every year till last year, missed then and will this year, hope to find someone to keep the tradition going by next year, used to be 4 to 5 boats in the ""good old days"" but people have died off, moved, got married or just lost interest till there were just the two of us, and now just me. Al"
572789,rpieske,2008-04-12 14:24:00,1276,"This will be my 56th year going to Lake of the Woods. I started at Arrowhead Resort in Nestor Falls, ON and now live 4 months of the year in a cottage on the lake. Still love the muskies, smallies, pike and walleye. I, too, was fortunate to have a father who took me up there in 1953 and got me started. Now my son has been going up since 1978. Even my grandkids come up now. Life is good."
572792,Bill Krejca,2008-04-12 15:12:00,6107,"First trip was in 1939, but I was a little young to really enjoy it. Dad's first trip to Canada was in 1929, after a few years to northern Minnesota. His last LOW trip was in 1997 when he was 92, we camped out on an island for a week."
572795,Guest,2008-04-12 17:03:00,0,Started going up around 1980 to Andy Meyers Lodge on Eagle Lake. That was all it took for us to get the bug and be hooked. Went to Pine Island Camp for about 15 yrs out of Morson. Once the owner sold we moved on to Witchbay Camp. Our group of about 10 continues to go with new people coming when others drop out or can't make it that year. I hope to get my daughter interested in going pretty soon. Right now she likes to fish but only for 2-3 hours at a time. Wingmann17
572799,Guest,2008-04-12 18:32:00,0,am 51. started fishing at 44 years old. first trip to canada was at age 45. now go 2-3 times per year. I am hooked. Have taken the family and different kids at times but works better with the guys. Going first and last week of june this year. maybe in the fall? 13 trips so far. each one different but fun. I really enjoy the trip plans and logistics. it makes the winter tolerable to spend some time each day with your canada list. eric macdonald
572806,Guest,2008-04-13 09:06:00,0,"I lost count many years ago. I was young when we listened to all the old geezers in camp seated around the camp fire talk about fishing. We fished a whole lot of years around LOTW, then we moved to Sioux Lookout, then we moved to Red Lake, then we moved to Ear Falls, now we're wherever we feel like and I'm old and grey and its my turn to be the old geezer."
572809,Pooch,2008-04-13 09:38:00,4619,"Bill, You make me feel young when you talk about those long ago years. I'm sixty and fished from the time I could sneak away and used a hand line in the creek catching suckers and turtles. Then after the military fishing fell to the wayside until a buddy asked me to fill in for a dropout on their first Canada trip in the early 1990's. My passion was reborn. Been going back twice a year for a week or two each trip since. Several years made three trips. If I ever get to retire I think I'll just spend my summers up there. Not sure what the wife's plans are though! Oh well, a person can have goals anyway..... Looking forward to your book. Keep us here at WC posted when your ready for orders. Others will surely want a copy too. Pooch"
572814,esgrams,2008-04-13 19:16:00,92,"Let's see--Started when I was 4 with Dad in 71' going to Red deer lodge in Nestor Falls and have only missed a few years with marriage, kids and career changes,--that makes approx 48 trips (several in the late teen years)--Sure have seen a lot of new owners over the years but my favorite is still the Cottam Family--So far--havn't met the new owners yet...48 DAYS TO GO!!!!!!!!

572760,Guest,2008-04-11 20:41:00,0,This question came up last season with several of us comparing stories by the camp fire.My dad made his first fishing trip from the states up to the Ear Falls area in the 50's.I got to tag along in the 70's.The ol'man has passed on.I've been going ever since my first trip.So how long have some of you been going?Sounds like a travel beuro question...but just curious.
572762,rockpt,2008-04-11 22:40:00,589,Good post. I started in the late 80s when I was in college and made 20 trips to Nipissing before I switched to LOTW in 1999. This year will be my 39th and 40th trips to Canada. Usually twice/year and 10 days each trip. Some great memories. Hope to hit 100 before I'm gone.
572767,woods,2008-04-12 08:47:00,646,"I made my first trip in 1974, and I think I may have missed one or two years since then, but haven't missed any for the last 25 years."
572768,Guest,2008-04-12 08:49:00,0,"I am 36 and started going when I was seven. Dad went forever, grandpa took him. Grandpa drove up in model t's on dirt roads the whole way from illinois. Long trip that way. He was 92 and just passed away--he was still going when he was 90!! My dad passed away at 59--way to dang early. Spread his ashes in canada and makes my canada trips even more special cause i get to think about them more than I usually do. canada is way for than just fishin boys!!!!"
572769,Guest,2008-04-12 08:54:00,0,We've spread the ashes of a good friend where he used to fish per his request.Instructions are for mine be spread on Canadian waters as well.
572770,Guest,2008-04-12 08:59:00,0,"First trip, 1973. The guy with me had an uncle who was a guide up there. We rented a boat, borrowed the uncle's 5 hp motor and fished bays on LOW -- I couldn't even tell you where anymore. Not far from Fort Francis, though. Then I got tied up with my job, family, etc., and didn't fish until 1991. One trip to the eastern Ontario area in 1991 to a fly-in camp my brother had gone to for 10 years. One trip to the Nestor Falls area in 1992 to fish LOW on a fly-in. First trip to Witch Bay Camp (drive-to) on LOW in 1993. Since then I have added an additional 24 trips to that camp and go there at least twice a year and sometimes 3 (I am retired now and I can fish as much as I want -- in fact, now that I think about it, my wife encourages me to go ... should I be worried???? :-) )."

572774,Glenman12,2008-04-12 10:31:00,762,My first trip was in 1980 to Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls..It was reccomended by my friends dad..Then we joined a fishing club and started going to Rainy Lake to a place called Mudges Camp out of Mine Centre..after 5 years of going there a few of us decided we wanted a change..I still had the brochure from the lodge we had gone to on Cedar Lake..I called up there and find out there was a new owner..He had an opening for 4 people for the 1st week of June so we took it..we've been going there ever since..so this will be my 29th trip to Canada
572779,IMWalleye,2008-04-12 10:40:00,35,"I started fishing in Eastern Ontario when I was 6 - 51 yrs. ago. Started fishing NW Ontario (Lac Seul) in early 80's. Haven't missed a year since 1957. I live in St of WA - the ""commute"" is getting difficult, but I will find a way to spend more and more time in NW Ontario now that I have retired."
