The speed limit is 80km per hour and there are a few corners that will only allow you to do about 60 km, especially when towing a boat. You'll probably want to stop and wet a line in every lake that lines the highway. Just roll down the windows, smell the pines and throw your watch away for the week, you're on vacation! There are a couple of restaurants about 1/2 hr from Ear Falls (near Perrault Falls), but their hours seem to vary. Enjoy the drive. Ear Falls has 2 hotels. The Trillium and the Highway 105 (formerly; The Northland Hotel""--good food)"

For those that are metrically impaired like me that translates to 50mph. After a $62.50 education I won't forget! We were driving near 70 mph and I was told by the folks at 4 seasons in Ear Falls that, had I been Canadian, that fine would have been over $300. Actually the Mountie told us he was letting us off easy and could not have been more polite. Slow down and enjoy the scenery!"
