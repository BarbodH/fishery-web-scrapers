MNR is well aware but say there is nothing they can do about it. The word on the street is that they're going to commence netting in a big way ""as soon as the ice is off the lake"". Stay tuned ............"
573083,Guest,2008-04-24 11:25:00,0,"Beautiful, netting was a major contributor to the demise of the walleye fishing on Shoal Lake/Clytie Bay."
573085,Guest,2008-04-24 12:50:00,0,if there is nothing that can be done there is no use crying about it.
573104,Guest,2008-04-25 12:04:00,0,"thats right. they will net them all out then complain about the sportmen fishing the lake dry. then the government will tell all the visitors that the lake is fish and release only, no eating anything. I guess the canadian government is not any bette than the US government."
573119,Guest,2008-04-26 00:07:00,0,"This is a rumour which is not true!!! There has been no talks of this happening in the Kenora, Sioux Narrows, Clearwater Bay area of Lake of the Woods. For those of you who have heard this rumour, please check for true facts before spreading a rumour. There is no commercial licences on Lake of the Woods anymore, and the indians can only harvest fish for there own comsumption - not for resale."
573120,Guest,2008-04-26 06:24:00,0,No commercial netting would be great. I have watched and seen severals nets from the Indians in Lobstick & Long bay areas. I did watch a young kid set one late one night and check it the next morning. I'm sure there are hundreds of subsistance?? nets out there. Dennis
573121,Matches,2008-04-26 08:06:00,236,Flying Carrottop Do you really believe they don't sell the fish?
573128,rpieske,2008-04-26 11:16:00,1276,"Treaty rights allow the Reserves to net fish for their own use and for sale. I believe this has been confirmed by the courts. While there may not be any commercial licenses on LOTW, the Reserves are not governed by the commercial licensing program to the best of my knowledge. What has limited their netting is the absence of a commercial processing plant since the closing of the one in Kenora. Time will tell whether the plans of the Big Grassy, Northwest Angle, Rat Portage and perhaps other Reserves to purchase the closed plant and resume netting ever comes to fruition. However, speculation and rumor serve no purpose at this point. It might be best to take a wait and see attitude. In the final analysis there is little anyone can do to stop it."
