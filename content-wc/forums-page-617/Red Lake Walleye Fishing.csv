573136,Guest,2008-04-26 12:46:00,0,"25-50 would be a low number if you are in the right spot, you could get considerably more than that."
573138,joeman79,2008-04-26 13:10:00,417,That's the answer I wanted to here!
573141,Guest,2008-04-26 14:27:00,0,25-50 would be a below normal day on the Red Lake system. Weather will dictate the pattern.
573315,joeman79,2008-04-30 20:10:00,417,Charlie and I agreed. We will be happy if we catch that many a day. But we all want to catch a Northern as long as our leg. And think we have a good shot at doing that. 36 days and my smile gets bigger every day. YEHAW!!! Praying for some warm weather in NWO. Cold spring here in Kansas also.

Bouncing jigs and monnows off the bottom or casting raps that are black and gold or black and white have always been go to baits for me. Have fun, its a big lake with lots of structure, use a planed attack versus just running from spot to spot as you can waste a lot of time just driving on that lake. If you know where your satying, some may have a few spots near they could suggest. Al"

We have been studying maps and discussing strategy (sp) already. Hope my BIG LONG A BOMBERS work like they used to. Can't wait, any Tips or techniques would be appreciated. Thanks, Joe"
