573131,Guest,2008-04-26 12:07:00,0,"The Canadian beer is more expensive, but it's also a #### of a lot better than a lot of our US beers. Canadian beer is all apart of a true Canadian fishing trip."
573133,Matches,2008-04-26 12:26:00,236,"Mark1, I don't understand your math. If you did buy 10 cases at the duty free store it would be about $190.00 for real Canadian Beer. (about $19.00 per case, maybe less) Then at the border going into Canada, you would pay about $9.25 per case for duty for 5 cases (if you had 5 guys). Total for 10 cases including Duty would be about $235.00. Not $400."
573137,Guest,2008-04-26 13:10:00,0,"Matches, I meant that if you bought it at the beer store it would be about $40 a case and that would be $400. At the I falls duty free we purchased 10 cases for $150, there was a 5 for $75 special so we bought 2 specials. 5 blue and 5 blue light, it tastes about the same to us - the money savings is well worth the stop."
573139,dutchboy,2008-04-26 13:18:00,5717,"I think the last time we went in we were allowed to bring 25 gallons in addition to what the boat held. Please don't take my word for this call Canadian customs to verify. Simple solution is have your wife get another job to help finance the kids ""educations."""
573140,Guest,2008-04-26 13:24:00,0,You are right...the beer at the duty free is CANADIAN beer:)
573145,Guest,2008-04-26 16:22:00,0,"I'm sold. It shall be beer at Duty Free, hope for 5 for $75 deal (or 15 for $225), and pay the duty. I'm still stopping at The Beer Store for the more exlusive variants (Molson Dry, Labatt Genuine Draft, Brodeur, etc.)! FWIW, we've done blind taste tests with both Michigan- and Ontario-purchased Blue, and there is an unequivocal difference. Perhaps the Canadian version is fresher, or it's never gotten warm in transit. I'll ponder the question again while enjoying one in a few weeks. For the record, we also invest in the local bait shops and restaurants on our way up to camp, for multiple reasons. Frankly I don't feel the same obligation or feel the same endearment for the corporate gas stations. The same bait shops and restaurants every year are part of the pilgrimmage. Anyone know of any cigar shops in Sault Ste. Marie?"

573229,Frankm,2008-04-29 11:22:00,154,I think the risk of traveling with containers of gas out weighs the cost. In my opinion it is waayyy to dangerous. A couple years ago the guys in the cabin next to us had about 10 cans of gas sitting under the porch of the cabin. The owner wasn't very happy. Either was I being right next door. Thats alot of a gas and an accident waiting to happen. I don't have an issue with saving a few bucks. Personally I look at things a little different. I go once a year and its my vacation. I put money aside throughout the year. For me part of being on vacation is not worrying about the cost of every little thing. Same reason I eat steak and eggs for breakfast on the road. I know a bowl of oatmeal is cheaper but I want to live a little Sure a case of Kokanee cost $40. I can't get it here in the states. Every group has there own idea and way to plan a trip.
573232,AllenW,2008-04-29 11:42:00,11482,""""""""""""""""" I think the risk of traveling with containers of gas out weighs the cost """""""" I'd second that, one spark, one small leak and all you'd save goes up in smoke. I see not many, but enough fires along side the road to know that $hit does happen, we used to drag gas up there years back as we got it free (drag racing sponsor who liked to fish) but we stopped one time to eat and had gas running out the boat drain, seems one of the plastic containers ruptured. That was the last time for that. Take 10mph off your towing speed, that will help gas economy and help pay for gas in Canada. I try and spend most my money in Canada, but understand you wanting to save a buck or two, I'd just fine a better/safer way to do that. We do top all the tanks off at the border. Al"
573109,schick,2008-04-25 15:55:00,35,Canada gas prices are between $4.50 and $5.00 per gallon. Does anyone know if I can transport 5 5 gallon containers of gasoline across the border to supplement my boat gas needs for fishing at Lac Seul? NEPiker
573110,Guest,2008-04-25 16:53:00,0,"And you wonder why Canadians think the American fisherman is cheap. Spend the extra $25 and help their economy, help the other people sharing the highways with you by not carrying a bomb in your boat! Besides, I think it's illegal to transport more than what is in your boat tanks."
573111,schick,2008-04-25 17:14:00,35,"Beano 5 X 5 X 5 = $125 the last time checked. I am not going to haul it in my boat. It would be in my truck, but thanks for answering the question. I will fill up my truck at least 2 probably 3 times in Canada. NECheapPiker"
573112,Guest,2008-04-25 17:58:00,0,Isn't one of the questions at the border 'do you have extra fuel'? I believe you would have to pay a duty on it at the border. Crestliner Fritz
573114,Oldschool,2008-04-25 18:07:00,163,">5 X 5 X 5 = $125 the last time checked. The last time I checked, you would be spending $100 for gas in the states anyway, so the amount spent in Canada would be $25...or just what he said."
573115,schick,2008-04-25 19:15:00,35,"Okay, you guys got me, I admit I am cheap, but you know I am paying for myself and 2 sons at $140 per night plus tax each at the lodge, gas has gone to $5 per gallon in Canada and we get no reimbursement for any taxes coming back into the states, so my wife is really pressing me on how I can justify these trips. So, yes, I am trying every way possible to keep the cost from escalating. So, it was dumb question, so no more answers are necessary. Thanks NEWhinerPiker"
573122,Matches,2008-04-26 08:11:00,236,"It wasn't a dumb question. Your savings on gas, buy the beer at the duty free store, bring in crawlers, it all adds up in todays global economy. Funny how when things are good it's a global economy, when economy is bad, we start pointing fingers."
573123,Guest,2008-04-26 08:58:00,0,"We usually take 4 or 5 cans up with each boat. Crossing at the Soo out of Michigan we've been asked several times how much gas we have, but have never had to pay a duty. Even when we've had to pull over for a cursory search they haven't raised an issue with it. For us it's just as much a question of convenience as cost. Once we pack everything up and roll out we don't want to have to deal with filling cans on the way. For a similar reason, I much prefer buying our beer at the Beer Store once we're through. It takes less time to buy it there than to stop at the border and pay the duty (while we get searched), and there was never much of a cost benefit anyway. Now the math is different with the exchange rate where it is, but the Beer Store stop has become a tradition that we're not gong to change to save a few bucks per case. Besides, I love seeing all the Labatt and Molson options that aren't available in Michigan."
573125,Guest,2008-04-26 09:33:00,0,"You should think twice about (only saving a few bucks on beer). Our group buys 10 cases and you get 5 for $75, so its $150 for the beer and about $6 duty on the extra 5 cases, because there are 5 of us and the first 5 are duty free. The total cost with duty is only about $180. Now if you buy it at the duty free and pay about $40 that same 10 cases would be $400! With no exchange or the exchange the wrong way a couple of percent it could be more. The 5 minute stop and a little repacking is worth saving the $220, I would rather use the extra money for gas, I guess I don't mind a little inconvience if 5 minutes saves me that kinda of money."
573126,Guest,2008-04-26 10:25:00,0,What kind of beer can you get for $15 a case? One of the highlights of our trips to canada is the Canadian Beer. It is not the same as the (Canadian) beer sold in the states.
