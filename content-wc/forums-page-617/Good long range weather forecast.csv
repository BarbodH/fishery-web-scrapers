573336,Guest,2008-05-01 09:47:00,0,"The Weather Network provides a 14-day outlook.http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/CAON0315 You can read the regional, seasonal reports by searching your area of interest through Environment Canada.www.ec.gc.ca The outlook throughout most of NWO from now until walleye opener is mainly sunny, but consistently below-seasonal temperatures. We will need some more wind, rain and warmer temperatures to get rid of the ice before walleye opener (May 17). Even if that happens, things for this spring are still a little worrisome. Many fish may get 'temporally confused' and may not spawn, and/or at the very least will less likely be in their typical post-spawn opener locations."
573338,back357,2008-05-01 10:05:00,106,"Hmmm. You bring up a very good point that I really had not been considering. What does this late spawn do to the strategies I normally use for early June? This will be my 8th year up there and just the way the calendar works, I will be up there the earliest I have ever been (June 8 - 14). Normally, I am in the post spawn period and fish around the 8-12 foot range off of points and weed beds. Do I need to readjust my technique significantly this year?"

573365,Guest,2008-05-01 16:09:00,0,"BAK Way too early to tell what will be the magic depth between now and June 8. I suspect that the fish will be at or a little behind normal, but again, way to early. Plus, it matters the type of lack your on (tannic-stained or clear-water lake; flowage vs lake, etc). Lots of variables to consider. I would recommend two things to help you get a handle on what will be best before your on the lake talking to people fishing it: (a) keep watching this site for the reports as they filter back (keeping in mind that some of the stuff said here are typical internet BS); and (b) several of the NWO resorts post weekly updates on their websites as to what is happening. Of course some of those are filled with the usually ""wow, the fishing is great"" BS. However, if you review the fishing updates for a period of time (looking at the previous posts) you can figure out which of the sites post honest assessments (no place has outstanding fishing every day all year long) Have a great trip and enjoy...IA Walleye"
