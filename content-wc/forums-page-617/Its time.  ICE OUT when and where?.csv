572579,Guest,2008-04-02 11:27:00,0,"I don't want in on any bet, but I would say ice out will be closer to May 17ish or later."
572582,2746,2008-04-02 12:04:00,3206,Have been going up on opening week for 10 plus years now and have never encountered ice. With the opening on the 17th this year it might be a first.....let's hope not! With the ice out being later this year and the season opening early does anyone have tips on where the walley will be? It's possible they will still be spawning or possibly even in pre spawn. Could be interesting.
572583,meese,2008-04-02 12:49:00,6,hmm... I guestimate ice out by May 10th here in the Greenstone area of Northern Ontario.
572585,Guest,2008-04-02 15:01:00,0,my son was out beside my house last weekend. I live on Gullrock Lake south of Red Lake and he told me there was still 40 inches of ice. the weather has been in the minus digits every night and they are calling for -10 this weekend at night. the good news is it is getting into + digits during the day.
572643,Guest,2008-04-04 19:52:00,0,I am not sure but I bet the air temperature will have something to do with it
572731,Guest,2008-04-10 17:14:00,0,Out at Lac des Mille Lacs on the weekend. Did well. 30in good hard ice. 10in new snow on Sunday. Another 5in coming tonight and tomorrow. Cold nights for the next week. Got all the makings of ice out into the second week of May. Should be real good fishing on the opener.

572371,Tonyo,2008-03-23 07:41:00,212,Anyone out there with a guess on Gullrock Lake or a prediction on the Red Lake area?
572372,Guest,2008-03-23 08:09:00,0,"Ice fishing on a regular basis 3-4 times per week, right now on a small bush lake we have 12-18"" of snow plus lots of slush on ice and about 30+"" of ice. On a trout lake mid week last week we were looking at 2' of snow and 40"" of ice; just able to get auger through. Weather nice, just at freezing for a day or so and then a cold snap. Full moon brought night temps of -20C and better. Bottom line, after 16 years here, ice out a bit late this year. Gary"
572383,CDNWalleyehunter,2008-03-23 21:59:00,17,"I live in the Dryden area, The ice was around 40"" yesterday, the fishing was great but with the snow still on the lakes and the nights staying cold, my guess is going to be a late breakup. Might be 1st week of may, unless temperatures raise with mild nights. Can't wait to get my boat out."
572433,Guest,2008-03-25 20:59:00,0,ttt
572518,Guest,2008-03-29 02:21:00,0,"I figure the ice will be late going out this year. Still 2 feet of snow on the ground here and forecast says 10 to 15cm and possibly 20cm coming Saturday night. 2 week forecast shows high temps of only a couple degrees above freezing, and still getting well below freezing at night. My guess there will still be ice for the opener on some lakes. Oh well, get to fish with 2 lines."
572520,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-03-29 08:38:00,32,"I expect late ice out as well, and it will be a struggle for a lot of outfitters to get their lodge ready on time. This has been a classic canadian winter. My guess is May 3rd at 3:13pm on Lac Seul."
572524,Goldeneagle,2008-03-29 13:08:00,78,How deep is Lac Seul? Give me your answer and we might work up a beer bet on your prediction.
572573,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-04-01 22:49:00,32,">How deep is Lac Seul? Give me your answer and we might work >up a beer bet on your prediction. Lac seul is around 100ft at the deepest, and I'm always up for a beer bet!"
572574,Goldeneagle,2008-04-02 02:58:00,78,"I'll take after May 3 for a beer. Gotta be broken up enough for a plane to land safely just about anywhere on the lake. Next, how do we settle the bet? I'll be coming through Ear Falls May 15 or 16. We may never settle up, but can talk about it forever."
572575,Guest,2008-04-02 07:07:00,0,Talked to owner at Birch point on Nungesser Lake He said probably between the 1st of May and the 10th Should be no problem for opener and should be high water this spring
572325,Guest,2008-03-20 19:32:00,0,OK guys get out your ouji boards. When will the ice be out? dates or early usual or late. Let me know your prognostications please.
572326,Obabikon,2008-03-20 20:09:00,2370,I'm going to go with April 17th on LOTW... I think that's about right (maybe a little early) Wishful thinking!
572333,Guest,2008-03-21 09:36:00,0,"Obabikon, How about your thoughts as well on the lake level projections for LOTW in 2008? Did you get a lot of snow? thx,Max"
572334,Guest,2008-03-21 11:13:00,0,Northwestern Ontario I'm going for the first week of May or into the second week. Lots of ice and snow in the bush. We're having a winter cold snap for the next week as well.
572335,Guest,2008-03-21 12:56:00,0,bring your ice augers to Red Lake for the opening day! according to the weather forcast it is supposed to be -25 at night for Sunday.
572336,rpieske,2008-03-21 13:34:00,1276,I think the date for LOTW will be April 29th. Water levels will be in the normal range this year.
572342,Goldeneagle,2008-03-21 18:09:00,78,"I want it broken up enough to land on Little Vermilion Lake, May 16 for my 16 days of constant change. Change for the better, every day. I hope."
572343,Guest,2008-03-21 18:12:00,0,So it sounds as if ice out will be a little later this year?
572355,Obabikon,2008-03-22 08:27:00,2370,"Max... I was told that we did get plenty of snow. More than the past two years. More snow/rain never hurts, as we all know. I'm guessing it'll be a little low, but nowhere near as low as it was last May."
572362,Guest,2008-03-22 14:08:00,0,We had a wet fall as well. Bring lots of bug dope. It's got the makings of a perfect storm
