1777897,iman63,2013-05-15 17:24:00,91,Any more news on ice?
1778017,Ia Walihntr,2013-05-15 18:29:00,320,Todays satellite image still shows a lot of ice.http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/...esolution=250m Move bottom slide to the right to show Sturgeon Lake.
1778025,plumberjoe,2013-05-15 18:34:00,54,Talked to camp owner today bay in front of his place open but still lots of white ice out on main lake. He figured it would be gone before 2nd week. Best fishing we ever had there was still some ice chunks floating around when we got there.
1779313,JJJMN,2013-05-16 07:27:00,153,I spoke with camp owner at trappers point on the 15th. He said he could make it 1/2 way to Rusty Myers from Trappers point. Hasn't been near main lake but sure it's frozen over. Not good news for trout guy's but the legal part of Trappers Point bay is fishable on Saturday so all is good. Walleyes are still spawning in the creek by the road north of trappers point. Since we mainly fish trappers point out to 1/2 mile rock and then run out to Canoe and Steam Boat channels later on we should be good for the opener. Lot's of food and drink for the down time. Were hoping for another great trip to the frozen north. Now if we could just be there when there isn't any No-Sea-M's biting us it would be perfect.
1797066,lawson2343,2013-05-22 09:08:00,459,Heading up June 1 - hoping I don't need to take ice fishing gear! Thanks in advance.
1798922,plumberjoe,2013-05-22 18:35:00,54,Ice went out Tuesday night.
1813066,JJJMN,2013-05-28 07:15:00,153,"Just back from Sturgeon. Maybe the best Walleye trip weve had in 25 years. Trappers point was Ice free and never had to run out to main lake the fishing was that good. Got to camp late on Saturday May 18th. Road from Minnestota to Sturgeon were in great condition. A couple one way bridges being repaired but that was about it for road work. Water was still about 46 to 47deg. Walleye had just moved off of spawning beds and the big females were hungry. Leeches, Minneows, Gulp.... all worked. Sunday we were catching 24 - 29 inch fish left and right with several doubles in each boat. Caught enough 16-18 for shore lunch. Lots of rain on Monday, but still got in 3-4 hours. Overall the week was the best fishing weve had in many many years. Hope you all have a great trip, ours was."
1813810,Lovetofish,2013-05-28 10:10:00,458,How was the water level?
1814690,JJJMN,2013-05-28 14:00:00,153,Water level was higher than last year. Maybe 5 to 6 inches higher.
1815578,iman63,2013-05-28 18:45:00,91,We were able to reschedule trip for June 20th -27th. Hated to miss the first weekend sounds like some great fishing was had. Main lake open on Tuesday would of been a bummer if we went up as we fish mainly in northeast arm of lake. Hopefully bugs aren't super terrible week of June 20th. Thanks for adding to this thread.
1727657,iman63,2013-04-30 08:57:00,91,Anyone have an idea of ice still on this lake? Weather up until openner?
1728497,plumberjoe,2013-04-30 12:40:00,54,Talked to our camp last week and at that time there was 30 plus inches ice and alot of snow. It has been warm since then and steady thawing temps in forcast. We were scheduled to go for the opener but have switched to 2nd week at the advice of our camp. He said it is going to be close for the opener and twice the ice has gone out the day before we got there. We decided not to risk it since we could switch our vacations and they had openings.
1749873,Catman59,2013-05-06 14:25:00,345,Well here is the view down the lake from the beach at White Sands at 9am today May 6th !!!
1750417,iman63,2013-05-06 18:13:00,91,Doesn't look good for May 18th at all. Have to find another place closer to home this year I guess.
1763737,Catman59,2013-05-10 14:38:00,345,And here is Sturgeon today .............. still looking pretty icey
1763833,JJJMN,2013-05-10 15:17:00,153,Were still heading up on the 18th. Just hope the Trapper Point area and bay will let us float a boat. If not we'll travel the area for moving water. Had good luck a few years ago when we had the same situation. Several channels (rivers) between lakes just driving north of Rusy Myers Outpost that had some good fishing.
1766489,iman63,2013-05-11 16:06:00,91,Our resort owner (Whiskey Jack Lodge) called today and said forget the opener. He thinks sometime during 2nd week of season... maybe. Still 24+ inches on our bay. He says normally our bay is one of the first to go.
1767529,Catman59,2013-05-12 06:48:00,345,And they had a blizzard up there yesterday too .............
1770945,plumberjoe,2013-05-13 12:47:00,54,Water in front of trappers point is open almost to rusty myers float plane camp as of Sat afternoon you should be able to fish that area on opener main lake will be froze.
1771281,JJJMN,2013-05-13 14:40:00,153,Thats great news. We had hoped as much since that bay is fairly shallow with a little current from the small river. Walleye's should be stacked up in there. We will find out on Saturday.
