1807338,Pooch,2013-05-25 18:35:00,4619,Making our first ever trip to this camp this summer. Booked cabin four for a week. Anyone have pictures of that cabin or anything around camp. Any tips on the camp? Docks? Power on the docks? Security for gear in boats at night?This will be my fiftieth trip to Canada and I don't need any more surprises if I can avoid them ahead of time.Pooch
