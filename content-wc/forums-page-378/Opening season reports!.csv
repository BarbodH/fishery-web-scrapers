1805386,BreezyPoint,2013-05-24 21:03:00,1581,That is somewhat strange. Pike normally spawn well before walleyes...are the two reversed here?
1805394,Glenman12,2013-05-24 21:07:00,762,"it was my understanding, but this could be wrong..if it was their time, pike will spawn under the ice."
1808250,wallydave,2013-05-26 06:40:00,2151,"Well another week has come to an end. For some their trip has ended, for the rest of us we are anxiously waiting for our chance to chase the tasty walleye around our favorite lake! How was last weeks fishing? Thanks"
1808954,tadler53033,2013-05-26 11:59:00,6,"Walleye in prespawn to spawn, most northern already spawned out. A lot of walleye males milking and females spewing eggs. Fishing was excellent but had to be in the right areas. Took me until Wednesday to catch a walleye under 18"", largest 26.5 female. Best year we've had on Wabaskang and by far the best accomodations at Sleepy Dog Cabins."
1784609,wallydave,2013-05-18 04:23:00,2151,"Good luck to all who started the walleye season! For the rest of us still waiting, shopping , packing and dreaming of our trips, lets hear the reports on the fishing, weather and any road conditions that you have experianced!Thanks!"
1784697,skinny5382,2013-05-18 06:27:00,62,"We have fished NW Pennsylvania since ice out every weekend, about 6 or 7 weeks. Been a slow bite. Spring is much colder than last year and I think that has slowed them down. I took all last week off work and fished every day. Last couple days has improved a little but still slow."
1784705,dogrodder,2013-05-18 06:30:00,400,Water temp 49 degrees in the bays along shorelines and 44 degrees in the middle. Ice out last Tuesday. Casted the weeds for Pike last night with no luck. We'll fish super slow and look for warmer water. Current 10.9C headed for 17C wind calm high overcast skys. Bright baits and clearer water day.Not much to report. Fishing real slow. Found a few in south facing bays 50 degree water. Open water still 42 degrees.
1785825,Davis Viehbeck,2013-05-18 18:19:00,48,Walleye in the Thunder Bay area of Northwestern Ontario are in full pre-spawn to spawn mode. Weather is wet and cold for the next four or five days. The rain will get rid of remaining ice. This is a cold opener and late ice off compared to recent years.
1787289,freespoolin,2013-05-19 09:35:00,472,We fished the Perch Bay area on the Winnipeg River north of Kenora on May 18. Water temp was 42.8F and walleyes are still pre-spawn.
1787441,Gunner_Fletch,2013-05-19 10:53:00,74,Same holds true for LOTW.....
1789057,wallydave,2013-05-20 01:23:00,2151,How are the roads in Ontario? Any construction in Minnesota or Wisconsin?
1789457,fishguide1800,2013-05-20 07:41:00,84,Fished walleye on sat.north of vetmilion bay.caught some but very slow bite.had to barely move the jig.2-4 ft of watet.54 degree water by feeder creeks and back bays.pike were very active.which were probably spooking the walleye also. Fished for laker on sun.very windy 30-40km.wanted to jig for them but to windy .ended up trolling for them and caugjt a few but not fast either but some nice ones.only fished till 1 oclock.about what i was suspecting.might have done better soaking for them.today more rain(need it)and a couple of more days of rain coming.will be headed again thurs for 3 days.will see if anything changes.
1790794,wallydave,2013-05-20 14:46:00,2151,"Andrea at Goose Bay Camp, says the walleyes are post spawn, the ice is all gone now, rainy and cold!Pike are prespawn for now!"
1791338,Walleye_Guru,2013-05-20 17:15:00,62,"Lake Nipigon area - all inland lakes ice off as of Saturday night. Major tributaries to Nipigon full of post spawn walleye  water temps are 45 and rising. Saturday was a VERY active bite in the evening, slower during the day. Depending on the water body, active fish were found in 28  18fow  most in the 25ft range.Primary logging roads are in VERY rough shape from the frost and major run off. The beavers are messing up their fair share as well LNipigon River very slow trout bite, no action on any other species"
