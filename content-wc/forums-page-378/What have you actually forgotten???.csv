1796922,Mondo,2013-05-22 08:28:00,61,"I forgot a deck of cards on a remote fly-in. Everyone was giving me a bunch of SH!@$ for it. To solve this problem ~ we had plenty of paper plates so we cut them up into pizza slices, labeled them from Ace - Duece across all 4 suits. That was our deck of cards. I still lost money... Mondo"
1797434,Narda3,2013-05-22 10:47:00,3,One of our group forgot his passport as we left for the trip. Remembered20 moles down the road. Went back for it. Another in our group forgot his med's. Diabetes and so on. Did not realize until we arrived. Would not let us over night them in. Not a good week. Also debit card issues the first time. Company turned it off after a few purchases to protect us. Came time to settle up at the end of the week......card denied!!!! We always let them know in advance when we leave now.
1800962,rms0528,2013-05-23 11:35:00,18,"The only year I've ever forgotten the papers for the dog, Canadian Custom's asked for them. At Ryden's the wife asked me if I had the papers. I said ""no, you usually pack them."" Turned out neigther one of us did. Ended up driving all the way back home to the northern suburbs of Minneapolis and back to the pigeon river crossing. Cost us one day of fishing and $250 in gas, but we laugh about it now."
1801954,muskyroller,2013-05-23 17:51:00,56,"I can honestly say, in 25 years of going up I haven't forgotten anything that has ruined the trip...One year forgot my glasses. Had to wear my contacts from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed...my eyes were shot by the second day. That wasn't awful though.Forgot papertowels for the cabin one year...oh well. I've never forgotten the fishing equipment (knock on wood - watch it'll happen in a month)...That's way too important and the first thing in the truck!Steve"
1806842,LundDriver,2013-05-25 14:10:00,30,"A few years ago on LOTW. The evening before we were going over the lake map looking for new spots to try. Found an area to try so headed out the next morning. 45 min. travel time, shut down, deploy bowmount, open rod locker..............#%@#&* rods were back in the cabin!!! Oh well, is was a beautiful morning for a boat ride."
1810970,Guest,2013-05-27 12:30:00,0,I forgot my tackle box with most of my tackle and lures and didn't noice til we were at the fly in cabin alone for a week. Basically just trolled worms with a few spinner rigs I had tied up that I had in another bag. Still caught hundreds of walleye and some pike.
1811162,Ogoki,2013-05-27 14:04:00,291,"When my wife and I go together ,she packs our clothes. One trip she did not pack me undershorts . Yukkk. I did rinse them out prior to going to bed a couple times and they were dry enough to wear the next morning . That trick reminds me of a story I read in one of the books about Fred Bear ( for those of you who don't know who he is , he was the pioneer of modern day archery). He said about the third or forth day of being in the wilderness , his hunting partners were starting to smell ripe. Since they were spike camping ,they did not have a change of clothes . He looked at the guys and said ok guys its time to change underwear . He looked at the group and pointed at one guy and said you change underwear with him and you change with him and I will change with whoever is left . They did not really, but makes for a good laugh."

1783305,Pikeslayer8,2013-05-17 13:18:00,1460,"Funny thread Sin. One year my hand held GPS was left in the floor of the front seat of our vehicle. As we left the hotel in the morning, my brother takes shotgun to the outfitters and with the rush to load the plane...got left behind. Man was I pissed. Just a couple trips ago, we went in without the sleeping bags the outfitter planned on sending with us. I decided to make a run over to Rusty Myers camp to see if there were any extras but the camp was empty. Found plenty of bags and wrote the note saying we borrowed their bags and will bring them back. Funny thing was that Rusty's pilot saw the note and told Angie and Angie told Vic, my outfitter, and we had our sleeping bags on our dock the next day."
1783401,Lovetofish,2013-05-17 13:51:00,458,"My uncle left his wife at a rest area one trip. He drove all night and stopped somewhere to take a nap. When he woke up he went in to use the rest room. Came back and started his van and took off. About 15 miles down the road his cell phone rings. His wife had to use the rest room too, only uncle did see her get out of the van. We still laugh about that one."
1784049,RapShad,2013-05-17 18:59:00,76,Last year I left the top of the spool to my brand new Shimano reel at home. Luckily we have plenty of older reels.
1784289,ch1488,2013-05-17 20:28:00,6,"Many years ago eight of us were flown into a remote lake for a week of fishing. While setting up the cook shack it was discover that the spatulas were not in the cooking kit. With pancakes or eggs on the menu for mornings and many fish to fry we had a problem. One of the guys walked down the beach and came back with a 4"" diameter piece of beaver wood. A little work with the swede saw and three hours of whittling he fashioned a usable utensil. It was kept in the kit and made many more trips north."
1784441,kbucknuts,2013-05-17 20:55:00,2,Before the whole passport thing we had a guy forget his ID on his dresser at home.
1791058,Guest,2013-05-20 15:45:00,0,two years ago I forgot 2 gal. of milk in the back seat of the car for five days. on a hot day you can still smell the rotten milk
1791258,mickr,2013-05-20 16:47:00,74,i had a buddy forget his fishing rods and not catch on til we arrived at our outfitter.
1796138,roscoe33,2013-05-21 22:39:00,653,"Family has been crossing the border since the 50's, so many many trips. I've only gone about 20 times. Last year I forgot to call the credit card company to tell them I would be using it in Canada. First purchase, grocery store, accepted. 2nd purchase, licenses at Canadian Tire, accepted. Third purchase, $250 worth of gas, rejected. Had enough cash to cover the trip, but no extra souvenirs.Mom has always been a great list maker and I can't remember her ever forgetting to pack anything, ever. Dad, not so good. He let her take over the packing 50 years ago. But she does forget where she packed things. But at 78 years old, I let it slide. Mom has taught me well. If something isn't in the boat or truck, I just know it is missing.For every trip, I have 3 lists, things to do, things to buy, things to pack.Now, I suppose I will forget something when we leave on Friday."
1796530,CaptainNewbie,2013-05-22 06:49:00,16,the plug for the boat. Nothing more needs to be said...
1781977,Hawker,2013-05-17 05:46:00,3967,I see a GREAT practical joke in the making here!!
1781993,wallydave,2013-05-17 05:54:00,2151,"Last year I forgot to pack my tooth brush! We had travelled just a couple of months before the fishing trip! Not to be, we stopped at the Safeway in Dryden for a few supplies, got to the checkout line only to go back for the tooth brush! Must have had walleye on my mind!"
1782057,micropterus,2013-05-17 06:25:00,450,"Lots of practical joke material here, but messin' with a man's Loomis is not on the list!! It would be worse if it was a Legend Elite."
1782153,rsiminski,2013-05-17 07:10:00,53,I go on a walleye trip every year to the Bay of Quinte the weekend before Thanksgiving. One year we were getting ready to leave the capatains house and I realized I never brought my ice armor suit. Probablly the worst moment I have ever had. It was freezing with snow in the forecast. I was fortunate enough to have a great relationship with the charter captain and he let me use his extra gear. 7 hours of trolling for walleye in snow and freezing rain with a fleece jacket would have sucked!!!!
1782185,10point,2013-05-17 07:25:00,102,My friend left something very important at our camp last year. His passport! I thought I was going to have to leave him in Canada. He explained to the border crossing agent what happened and we got through no problems.
1782345,Lovetofish,2013-05-17 08:21:00,458,"Two falls ago we were a half hour from camp which takes 15 hours to drive to. My friend says he thinks he left the sandwich meat on his kitchen counter. Sure as heck, he did. It was the fancy sliced stuff from the deli too. We rode him all week about it."
1782401,MrSimon,2013-05-17 08:39:00,922,I forgot my sleeping bag once and my pillow a couple times. Being cold or uncomfortable at night is the WORST.
1782777,jambi,2013-05-17 10:35:00,504,My partner forgot his Reese's Pieces. Couldn't find any in Kenora. Had a fun time anyway.
1782897,SinOrSwim,2013-05-17 10:51:00,1528,"I can't even imagine forgetting rain gear or a sleeping bag. I made an excel spreadsheet/chart with all my gear listed. I have a column for have, need and packed. I try to gather everything in one area but pack at the last moment so I see it go in and check it off and not too much time passes so I wonder in my head if I brought it. Not perfect, but better.We had one year we flew in. Our outfitter never charged us for over weight gear. He would fly it in later that day or the next on check flights etc. We just would take our basic gear out and leave over flow stuff. Extra bags, beer, soda, etc. My brothers rain gear was in one of his over flow bags so it didn't go in with us that morning. No big deal.....it was sunny and warm. LOLOLOLOL Til later that day it got cold and started RAINING BUCKETS!!!! We headed back to the cabin but he was sitting in the front shivering and soaked. It was pretty funny for me as the driver."
1783113,tsquared,2013-05-17 12:07:00,57,"We were about an hour or two into last years 16 hour drive, when a rookie started counting the rod cases and kept coming up one short. Turns out we left my buddies rods, which he had sent to me from texas (we were picking him up in Minnesota) in my garage. We were driving two vehicles so we told the one to keep going and that they would stop for the beer, pick him up, etc. and we would catch up. The rods were sitting right there in the case in the middle of the garage....now for the practical joke....we were meeting at my house the year before and UNCLEJOE pulled up in his pickup, we quickly threw his rod case in my vehicle, he started to unload his truck and said, oh #%$, my rods fell out, I have to go back. The guy who had grabbed the rod case felt so bad, he didnt even let it go for a few seconds..."
1781209,SinOrSwim,2013-05-16 19:28:00,1528,"The thread about what not to forget was interesting. But, what have you actually forgotten on a trip?I forgot a pillow one year. Remembered it on the way up so was able to stop at Walmart and buy another. We then stayed at the fly-in outfitters main resort the night before we flew in. YEP, forgot the **** pillow in the bunkhouse. Didn't have a pillow the whole week. Used a couple nasty ones from one of the couches. Ugh!"
1781225,Bill Krejca,2013-05-16 19:34:00,6107,"I didn't bring the container with all the spices last year. Luckily borrowed from camp. Another year, when we camped, I left half the groceries at home, remembered that I forgot before we reached the island, and re-bought. Bill"
1781305,Glenman12,2013-05-16 19:44:00,762,Luckily over the years nothing major has been left behind...a few years back the guy that did the grocery shopping forgot the lunch meat in his fridge..we hadn't left yet so he just had to drive about 10 miles back to his house...several years ago my fishing partner forgot his shave kit..all easy to replace on the way up..of course he blamed his wife..theres probably more but Ill have to think about it..
1781393,cabin6,2013-05-16 20:11:00,47,Forgot the bread one year. Camp manager's wife baked us a fresh loaf. Forgot the eggs one year- traded crawlers for 6 eggs. Went with a guy who packed 2 weeks early only to forget his underwear- everybody else donated one pair to him.
1781401,stjoeguy,2013-05-16 20:13:00,979,"We used to stop in Dryden and buy all the groceries at Safeway. Everyone would grab a cart and run up and down the aisles checking back every once in a while with the guy that had the list. Then we would meet at the checkout. Partway through the week, after missing several items, we realized that we left a cart of groceries in the store."
1781473,2746,2013-05-16 20:41:00,3206,"One guy forgot rain gear. I have an extra in the boat 2 sizes to big but the pants had suspenders. On fella left his rods/reels and tackle box sitting by the house we left from. left an 8 # prime rib in the fridge one year. I don't drink but left the beer one year.....discovered as we unloaded at camp and one of the guys immediately made the 20 mile trip to town. Cooking oil, eggs, socks, towels, shampoo, soap (both shower and dish) ear plugs etc. etc. After 50 plus trips we've probably forgotten everything at least once."
1781713,Pooch,2013-05-17 03:07:00,4619,"Very first trip to Canada. One of our guys forgot and left his sleeping bag in the truck. I had two light blankets and a sheet with me. So I gave him one blanket and we both shivered all night for a week. Turned out to be a cold and wet week on a fly in. When I got home I told my wife ""Never again""! That was over fifty trips ago.Every year we forget something, even when working off a list.My recurring dream is that I get to camp and don't have either rods, reels or tackle box. Open the rod tube and it's empty! Weird.... Now I'm paranoid and when packing keep going over my ""stuff"" thinking that I've forgotten something.Pooch"
1781777,Tonyo,2013-05-17 04:24:00,212,"I have left my VHF antenna at home, borrowed one from a local Red Lake marina for the week. Forgot my bath towels once, borrowed from the guys for the week. We ran out of alcohol, one time mistake, because it was an expensive run to town to get more. We have run out of cigarettes, ditto the previous comment. Forgot my bath soap. The list goes on and on but the good thing is we are not too far from Red Lake and we can remedy our mistake for a few $$$ at the local stores. I am sure we will make the run to town again in 2 weeks when we figure out what it is we forgot this year. TonyO"
1781945,northernbite,2013-05-17 05:41:00,1186,"We had a guy, about 6 years ago, forget his sleeping bag. I always carry a bag plus a good blanket and sheet but after all those years of not using blanket I for go carring blanket. We drive into a remote lake and travel 15 miles by boat and set up tent camp. 100 miles to a place to buy something. Also this guy is cheap, frugal or what ever. So that night it was nippie and he had all his jackets, space blanket and blue tarp over him. I offered to take him out to truck and pick him up at the end of day but no he was all right. Well it turned out that became one of those years that a sheet was all you need so all went well.I load all my stuff in boat before I leave house so it seems, I've been lucky. Taking grandson this year pack for 2, after writing this I'm sure we will forget something.But not the sleeping bag,Paul"
1781961,revitup,2013-05-17 05:44:00,140,This hasn't happened but I have had bad dreams of it happening. My brother is flying in to Minneapolis to meet us. He bought a new loomis rod and had it sent to me so he wouldn't have to worry about packing it. I fear forgetting it and seeing his look if I give him my spare rod worth $30 to fish with all week.
