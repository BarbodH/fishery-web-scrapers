1821169,nicko,2013-05-30 09:29:00,508,"To go along with Knutson21 ....call it what you want. I fish from 6am till 10-11pm.....I take a break for lunch (Eating shore lunch every day) and I break for dinner. Then I head back out till 10-11 (Dark)...I do that for 6 days straight. I can drink at home. At the end of my trip, my back is sore and I have tendinitis in the elbow. I get maximum fishing time in one of the best spots on Earth and I enjoy every minute in the Great North. Do I need a beer to do that? No...I don't. I'll have a drink at the lodge for dinner if i need one to ease the back pain. Otherwise...totally clean all week. If you need beer to enjoy your trip, you may want to evaluate your priorities. My head and my liver thank me..... Knutson21 and I will be fishing long after you're all gone....."
1821961,misanthrope,2013-05-30 13:29:00,43,"To each his own... Personally, I fish from a couple of hours before dawn 'til a couple of hours after dusk, catch walleye with my teeth, wrestle grizzlies, drink like a fish, smoke like a train engine, and out cuss Chesty Puller. I'm saltier than Davey Jones' locker and I claim Northwest Ontario as my personal playground. I ain't never seen 'em, but my common sense tells me the Andes is foothills, and the Alps is for children to climb! Keep good care of your hair! These here is God's finest scupturings! And there ain't no laws for the brave ones! And there ain't no asylums for the crazy ones! And there ain't no churches, except for this right here! And there ain't no priests excepting the birds. By God, I are a mountain man, and I'll live 'til an arrow or a bullet finds me. And then I'll leave my bones on this great map of the magnificent... And I've been known to tell a fish tale or two....."

1818153,freespoolin,2013-05-29 13:20:00,472,would you like some cheese with your whine? We pay those outrageous beer prices every day.
1818185,nicko,2013-05-29 13:25:00,508,Thats still a nice new St. Croix rod.......
1818217,tooski,2013-05-29 13:29:00,393,It cost to haul anything up 599 or to other remote locations. Take Mondo's suggestion or pay the price of having it available at the end of your trip. You probably pay more per beer at your favorite pub and the setting is nowhere near as great.
1818393,misanthrope,2013-05-29 14:30:00,43,"Is an outpost camp without Canuckian beer physically possible? I believe such would be an abomination, a sin in the eyes of Jah and man. The beer tab will be split amongst three middle-aged, overweight, balding pilgrims on the Walleye Haj. I'm also assuming, based on many years of past experience, that the Goose, the Maker, and a bottle of the devil's own rum will appear in the Ontario outer lands.. And, Freespoolin, that would be lovely... The wine and cheese that is... I'm partial to full-bodied, heavy bottomed reds. Cab, Zin, even the occasional Merlot... I'll be more than willing to take delivery at TJ's in Red Lake at O'Dark early on the 6th... Teetotaling wall-eye fisherman? Who'da thunk it?"

1819473,beer slayer,2013-05-29 19:12:00,33,"The beer prices are extremely high in Canada, but the beer is dang good! Worth every nickel to swallow a few down around the campfire. And as John Molson once said ""An honest brew makes it's own friends"" even at 60 bucks a case!........hahhahahah"
1820001,Knutson21,2013-05-29 21:03:00,348,"I agree with nicko I can drink on my couch. We go to Canada to fish, not drink And at that price I don't see the point. In fact I have been on trips were no beer is in camp. Yea I know most of you probably think that is a sin."
1820489,jigman 2003,2013-05-30 06:12:00,981,"Sitting in a bar and drinking is far more expensive than $60 a case. Even here in Bugtussel, central MN you're looking at $3 to $3.50 for a Busch Light (blech). 24 x $3 = $72 Its both cheaper to drink and a far better experience than sitting in a bar. Plus, its actually real beer in Canada"
1813698,misanthrope,2013-05-28 09:45:00,43,"I need to place the beer order for our trip next week. Anybody know the going rate for ""two-fours"" with wings?"
1814338,octanehi5,2013-05-28 12:36:00,1104,I know on our flyin trip a sixpack costs $15 on the lake and 24 cans will run you $60
1814402,misanthrope,2013-05-28 12:49:00,43,Yikes and thanks... That could mean a $700.00 beer tab....
1814418,Aaron-IN,2013-05-28 12:49:00,500,Just put an order in for 17 cases for a total of $765
1814586,LoDo,2013-05-28 13:25:00,721,its incredible how much beer is in Canada. A few years ago we made a beer run into Ear Falls and it was $60 for a case of Bud heavy. ouch!They get ya comin and get ya going! Get you while you are there too!
1814666,campchick,2013-05-28 13:54:00,96,Look at this website: www.thebeerstore.ca Ontario prices for beer are listed. Sales come out on Monday morning and there is a link for that (on the left). Good luck and good fishing!!
1816921,Mondo,2013-05-29 07:15:00,61,"I'm not sure of your travel plans, but we fish Red Lake every year. Instead of buying beer at the Beer Store in Red Lake, we buy our alcohol at the Duty Free America Store when crossing the border.http://www.dutyfreeamericas.com/loca...&search_type=1 For example, a case of Labatt's blue sells for $15.75 at the Duty Free store compared to $48 at the Beer Store. Same beer, same great taste! If more that 1 case is bought, you'll have to pay an extra duty $7 or $9 a case (can't remember for sure) when crossing the border. Most you'll have to pay is $24.75 which is half of the Beer Store price. Something to consider. Mondo"
1817001,misanthrope,2013-05-29 07:30:00,43,"Mondo,Thanks for the info, but the problem is weight and timing. The outfitter will fly beer in advance without applying it towards the weight limits.We also usually clear Ft Frances/Int'l Falls at approx 2300, long after all respectable duty free hustlers have called it a day.MisanthropeYour liver is evil, it must be punished."
1817601,nicko,2013-05-29 10:18:00,508,or you guys could just go up and FISH.....and drink at home......I'd rather spend $700 on another trip somewhere than deposit it back in the lake 30 minutes later....
1817857,Aaron-IN,2013-05-29 11:39:00,500,"That $700 is split 6 ways so I'd rather drink and fish all week, not many places I could go for $116, LOL"
