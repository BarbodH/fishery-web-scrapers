1766361,Mike Willems,2013-05-11 14:54:00,4,"I am looking at the south shore of Lac Seul from my office window. Today is the first day that we are starting to see any movement around the lake edge. In a few spots the ice has pulled away from shore by a few feet, but the area of Route Bay that I can see is almost all white and tight to the shore.We may have some open water by opener, but there is very little chance we will cross the main lake to the North shore by this weekend.Confirmation of Ben's information. Lac Seul is just above the 50% normal mark for this time of year. Check out the lwcb.ca website for verification. Also contrary to an earlier post, the lake level is rising rapidly and will continue to do so regardless of rainfall. The thaw is not complete and it takes weeks for the runoff to fully enter the system.For a satellite view of the lake and the area:http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-todaySelect map USA 3 and zoom into 250 meters. You have to look for a clear day, but this satellite image will show you how much of the lake is still covered with ice.In conclusion, it is a big lake with variable conditions. For detailed information, call your outfitter.Mike WillemsSilver Water Wheel Lodge"
1766393,Jigger1,2013-05-11 15:21:00,234,"Unfortunately Looking at MODIS it shows a little different. The last good look at LacSuel was Thursday, May 9th it looks solid from satellite imagery. Certainly to Ben's point, the central basin and west look pretty white and solid. Nipigon is froze solid, there's even ice in the northern bays of Lake Superior, on LOW's big basin there's only a little spot on the southern edge that appears to be giving and even the big lakes in Minnesota are still iced over include Mille Lacs which is just unbelievable. You can now see smaller shallower lakes opening up or at least going black which is a good sign. Hopefully forecasted rain and warmer weather on Tuesday makes a dent. Sure want to see everyone get kicked off and going. Wishing you all the best and good luck! I'm 46 days out today and counting the minutes. http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/...esolution=250m"
1780561,Jigger1,2013-05-16 13:52:00,234,"How's it looking Mike, hopefully some good progress this week. Looks like north of LL the main lake still has a good amount of ice but can you get to the falls or the channel? When you look at MODIS and click on false color it really pops the ice. Wishing you all a great year at SWWL - see you in six weeks!"
1819593,Guest,2013-05-29 19:39:00,0,"If you check the graph at www.lwcb.ca and then click on basin data, then click on Lac Seul, you'll see that the last week of April and the first week of May there must have been plenty of rainfall as indicated by the inflow. Water level should be looking good."
1745337,schick,2013-05-05 07:01:00,35,Does anyone know the prognosis for lake levels by late May? I am hoping for higher water levels than last two years. Is ice out expected to be early or late for the Hudson area of Lac Seul? We always stay at Mahkwa Lodge. We will be arriving May 28th.
1746025,Pooch,2013-05-05 11:06:00,4619,"Hey schick, contact me via walleye central. Let's visit about Mahkwa and that part of LS. We make the trip in the fall to Mahkwa every year. Going twice this year.Pooch"
1746105,fishguide1800,2013-05-05 11:42:00,84,"Water levels are very low right now.going to have a hard time floating a boat at the doc k on abram.minnitaki,lac seul.very low as well."
1746769,Pooch,2013-05-05 16:35:00,4619,Why the low water? I thought you folks had good snow.Pooch
1746833,Guest,2013-05-05 17:05:00,0,"According to the water level graph for Lac Seul at www.lwcb.ca, it shows that the water level is beginning to rise and will continue to do so as the snow cover melts. Remember, if the UP of Michigan still have at least a foot of snow on the ground, Ontario will take even longer to thaw out."
1747089,fishguide1800,2013-05-05 18:54:00,84,We have no more snow.gone.no snow on the the lakes either.just ice .2 ft thick.water levels are going to be low.was at eagle yesterday and it looks like its 3 ft low at the dock at camp.going to need some major rains.as there is no more run off.going ice fishing tues.ill let u know how the ice is
1747289,Limeyangler,2013-05-05 20:05:00,563,water is low on Wabigoon....about 3 feet extra of shore line showing.
1747873,wallydave,2013-05-06 04:39:00,2151,"Lac Seul will have high and low levels. Last year with the early ice out and three of four weeks of rain during the start of walleye season left the levels as high as I have ever seen. Time will tell on the levels, if they get some rain, things will be close to average. Sounds like everybody is ready to hit the road North!! Opening day is less than two weeks away!"
1765873,Guest,2013-05-11 11:11:00,0,"Lots of miss information and speculation going on about Lac Seul and the ice conditions here in the Ear Falls area. Just returned yesterday evening from the DR in Winnipeg. Vertually all ice is out north to Perrault Falls; here on Lac Seul we are ice free and ready in the Ear Falls area with wind, current, rain and warm weather cutting the little ice that is left real fast. On my last trip to view lake there is plenty of open water for fishing right now and with a week of warm temps, we'll have a ball of fun on the opener. My best advice is to take it easy on the big girls as we will still be in the late part of spawn and the fishing will be like 'ducks in a barrel'. I Know some are nervice about some of the BS and speculation that has been posted, but there will be great fishing available on opener. Water is low as usual in spring but lots coming into lake as run off from the bush makes it's way down stream."
1766273,BenBeattie,2013-05-11 14:25:00,232,"Water levels are higher on lac seul right now then they were at the same time last year. Levels are NORMAL for this time of year. It's always low at ice out! As for ice, it's very surprising to hear Gary's report from the west end. It's tight and white in the central basin and only current areas are open here on the east end. Even by opener I doubt launching in Hudson or deception will get you very far. Definitely not to the north shore. No chance."
