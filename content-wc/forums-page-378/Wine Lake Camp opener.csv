A little rain Sunday and Monday, but it was not too bad.Walleyes were hot as usual. Minnows worked but so did twisters and walleye assassins. We literally caught hundreds of big mamas keeping a few at 18"" and below so we ate walleye all week. We estimated 350-400 walleyes from 18-24 and probably 25-30 over 24"" with the biggest at 27 1/2.Trout were very shallow and our typical trolling methods did not work like we are used to. Doc caught the largest at 34"" in literally 3 foot of water in a lake we have never seen a trout. Our trout catch was one at each of these lengths: 25, 25 1/4, 26, 27 1/2, 32, and 34. These fish are so fun to catch and make several runs as they approach the boat.Smallies are now part of the WLC experience as we caught a few in places we had never seen them, i. e. Beaver Lake and Turnaround Lake. The biggest was 16 3/4.We weren't targeting Pike, but caught a few big ones fishing for walleyes. Sizes were: 40 1/2, 3 x 36, 35, 33 and several between 30 and 33.We also caught some whitefish four boated with the largest at 22 1/2.No fall trip for us this year as life gets in the way, so my countdown for next year starts today! Tight lines everyone,Fish On!Hooks"
1809906,wallydave,2013-05-26 21:15:00,2151,Hooks sounds like you had a pretty good trip! Glad to hear it! The tough part now will be waiting for the next trip while reading everybodies trip reports! Hang in there!
1810394,Pikeslayer8,2013-05-27 08:00:00,1460,"Hey Hooks, Really a tough break losing out a day on the front end of your trip, but sounds like you guys just tore it up anyway. Man, 400 walleyes from 18-24 is some serious numbers. Luckily for you, you had your Brother in Law catch most of em. It's looking like no fall trip for me either. Both my nephews are getting married, but next fall is a must. Fellas, with all the fine reports starting to roll in, appears to me that, with the late spring and ice out, the walleye are extra hungry and willing!"
1810794,ILScott,2013-05-27 11:20:00,139,"Hooks, It seems like another successful trip for you. This is my year off from going to Wine but love seeing the reports. Just curious what lake you caught the laker in. I have caught smallies in Beaver before but not turn around. Ann and Herb run a great camp and with their camp size limits have made this fishery better since I started going in 2000."
1810906,Ogoki,2013-05-27 12:14:00,291,"Did you catch as many with twister tails as you catch with minnows? I normally take minnows in with me to find fish , then switch to twisters . I am debating with myself if I am taking in 10 dozen when I fly in or not . For years I did well with just twisters and then I got into the habit of taking them . The one system we fish has 54 species of bait fish ,according to the outfitter . Seems like there we did better with minnows . Was on the lake where we are going last August and did extra well on walleye with various colors of twister tails. I am fishing that same lake in a couple weeks and have never used minnows there. I guess I am being cheap now . LOL After spending so much in gas , motel and flying in another hundred bucks for bait is nothing in comparison. Thanks for your input ."
