The last time we were there (maybe 2-3 years ago), the camp was beginning to show some wear. I know the proprietors had the camp for sale, and the web page has not been updated for a while. Is the camp still in operation? Any news would be appreciated."

Last year when we were up, drove down to Golden Fawn camp and it did not look to be in operation. Docks and boats were still on shore, trees across the access road, and not a light on in the place. Don't know if the status has changed this year."
1811538,LoDo,2013-05-27 16:18:00,721,Any chance the camp is for sale?
1811562,WalleyeWally28,2013-05-27 16:33:00,298,Heard last summer it was for sale but don't know the current status.
