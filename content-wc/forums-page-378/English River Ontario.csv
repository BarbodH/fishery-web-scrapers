I will be in the 16 foot red lund rebel, if you see me pull over and say hey! good luck up there!"
1794954,Guest,2013-05-21 15:53:00,0,The Outfitter is Canadian Outfitters www.canadaoutfitters.com. Is is a fly in at about $1300 for the week for four guys. It is our first time on this body of water so any insight you have would be appreciated.

1796706,jambi,2013-05-22 07:29:00,504,"I fished with this outfitter in 2010, at their Gordie Lake outpost, incredible cabin, new boats and motors, great fishing. Mainly pike lake but that was what we are after. Greg and Kim were first class. http://www.canadaoutfitters.com/ my partner has the big pike on their front picture scroll (hoodie/sunglasses)"

I think the only complaint you might have would be if you thought you were going to be alone as that won't happen. You will have many visitors. Watch out for the bears down @ the cabin. In years past the owner of Naughty Pines said he actually shot a problem bear at the cabin across the kitchen table. Later, Jay"
