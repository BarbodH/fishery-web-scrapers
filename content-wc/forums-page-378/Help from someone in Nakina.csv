1816530,beer slayer,2013-05-29 03:26:00,33,"I have a trip booked with 7 lakes wilderness camps in little more then 2 weeks. I am not having any luck contacting my outfitter either by phone or e-mail, he has called me a few times and left messages saying his computer/ voicemail is down? If any of you fine folks are up there in Nakina or heading up there, or just know how to get in touch with Brad from 7 lakes please tell him Kenny from New Jersey has been trying to get a hold of him Thank you"
1816721,deputy dog,2013-05-29 06:23:00,305,"maybe give nakina air a call, 807-329-5341 or 807-329-5752....they do all the flights out of nakina and have to deal with your outfitter. good luck!"
1817281,tooski,2013-05-29 08:34:00,393,"Dog, I talked to Nakina Air yesterday and they basically said talk to your outfitter. I would hope they could help Beer Slayer (just because of his name) but wouldn't count on it."
1818401,beer slayer,2013-05-29 14:32:00,33,"I called Nakina air today and they explained my outfitter is in the bush with all his staff prepping cabins. Feel foolish now, but I am really excited for this trip! Thanks for the replies"
1818689,tooski,2013-05-29 15:35:00,393,Which outpost are you headed to?
1819401,beer slayer,2013-05-29 18:54:00,33,"tooski - Teabeau lake on the Albany river. Besides walleye, I am hoping on some catch & release brook trout. Already started packing!"
1820481,tooski,2013-05-30 06:03:00,393,"Great- we looked at Teabeau last year but opted for Dusey with that outfitter. Would love to hear how you make out, either PM me or post a report. Thanks...."
