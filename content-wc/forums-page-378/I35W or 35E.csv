1821801,dogrodder,2013-05-30 12:24:00,400,E going north was fine last I checked. E going south was blocked. I'd plan on E going up and W coming home.
1814922,dkrusin,2013-05-28 15:07:00,97,Leaving on 5/31 from Iowa taking I35. We always take 35E but understand there is construction. Would we be better off to take 35W. Thanks
1814986,dutchboy,2013-05-28 15:18:00,5717,I would do W but then I don't drive through the cities any more then I absolutely have to. I guess some of it depends on the time going through. Rush hour will be bad no matter which way you go but W might be easier.
1814994,Hawki,2013-05-28 15:19:00,7,"We are leaving from DSM on 5/30, will let you know"
1815074,LoDo,2013-05-28 15:44:00,721,"Please let us know. We fly into Minneapolis 6/6 and make the drive north. We have always taken 35E and stopped at the Gander Mtn, however I don't think we'll need to stop this year. If it makes more sense to take 35E we will.Thanks!"
1815082,dutchboy,2013-05-28 15:46:00,5717,From the airport I would ALWAYS jump on E.
1815722,drew59,2013-05-28 19:11:00,87,My wife and I are leaving in the morning (from Iowa) for Caribou Lake near Armstrong. I usually take E but this year I'm taking W because of construction. I looked up info on the MN Pass lanes. As long as you have two or more in the car it is free. That being the case it's probably the way I should have been going every year. Get in the left lane and keep up with car ahead of you!
1816018,LoDo,2013-05-28 20:44:00,721,I figured. 35E makes the most sense coming out of the airport. Depending on day and time would 694 ever make sense?
1816705,dutchboy,2013-05-29 06:18:00,5717,"Between 8 pm & 5 am it might be OK. Traffic going over the bridge can be a real B. Lots of commuters coming out of Woodbury & Wisconsin use 694 to 494 to get to Bloomington.I would head East towards St. Paul coming out of the airport, I THINK it's hiway 5. That will take you directly to 35E heading North. Once you past Hwy 36 exit start to move to the LEFT, it's a left exit now to get onto 35E North."
1821625,Hawki,2013-05-30 11:33:00,7,"We're on I35E heading N - hit some construction at mm 117, went to 1 lane for 2 miles, no stoppage. Otherwise we are moving at the speed limit +."
1821793,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2013-05-30 12:19:00,5533,"There are some lane closures on 35E SOUTH BOUND at hwy 42. Not sure about elsewhere. W or E, either way your screwed traviling through the Twin Schities."
