High water levels, lots of floating logs in the lake (be careful everyone) Fishing was really good. Fishing with slow presentation, slip bobber fishing, or jigging has been the best. Fish were between 4-16 feet of water. Minnows are working the best. Number 5,7,9 Rapalas trolling 1.2 miles an hour also works well. The big bass (females) are moving into the shallows. The Walleye (males) are still in the moving water and are very concentrated. The pike are up shallow and easily caught. The whitefish and lake trout are being caught along with the pike, bass, and walleye. This was by far one of the best opening weeks for fishing we have had in 11 years. Our fishermen caught quantity and quality fish. Overall a really good week. I hope this helps everyone out in planning for their trip and gets y'all excited."

Maybe one of those post spawn pike will put some bend to your fly rod sometime soon.Wondering how you're into using ""y'all"". Maybe you're chasing some southern gal who has all the skills for making a fish camp operation successful.Have a great year!"
1809138,green&orange,2013-05-26 14:17:00,28,Thanks and keep 'em coming. I will be in that area on a DIY trip in late June. Especially concerned with the bug situation. Thanks!
1809178,Golden Eagle,2013-05-26 14:32:00,2642,You'll run across plenty of bugs and plenty of fish.
1810050,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-05-26 23:00:00,358,Do not be concerned with the bugs. They will be there.
1810170,green&orange,2013-05-27 05:50:00,28,Fully understand about the bugs. Just hoping the black flies won't be out in full force. I can deal with the rest.
1810322,Golden Eagle,2013-05-27 07:20:00,2642,Hope for a good dragonfly hatch. They love eating black flies.
