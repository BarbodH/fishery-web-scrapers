1817249,rnnonmt,2013-05-29 08:30:00,992,I saw last week there was a sink hole/washout on the 502 near 11 I think but saw that it had already been repaired in another post. Havent heard of any others.
1817441,LoDo,2013-05-29 09:25:00,721,The 502 is open and the construction was completed. There shouldn't be any problems with the 502.
