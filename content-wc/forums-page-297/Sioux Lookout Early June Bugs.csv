3443394,Micah Driskell,2015-01-13 21:17:00,29,We will be taking our first Canada trip this Early June -- 6th-11th. Wondering if anyone could tell me what to expect for Mosquitos and Black flies around this time. We will be in the Sioux Lookout area.Thanks
3443714,kzoofisher,2015-01-14 04:15:00,5144,I would be prepared for bad bugs anywhere between ice out and the end of July. Bug suits and repellant weigh a lot less than a box of jigs so I always pack them. If I don't have bugs? Whooppeee! If I do? I'm prepared.
3443730,Pooch,2015-01-14 04:25:00,4619,"There's always bugs in Canada, but I don't think they are as bad as I've seen in MN. Good friend lives on Boy Lake and sometimes mosquitoes are just nearly overwhelming. Can't even talk outside sometimes. He says ""that's protein"".Black flies and ankle biters are a pita many times. Need to tape/cover ankles or wear high top boots when they are thick. Long sleeve shirt or sweat shirt helps. They still bite right through most shirt weight fabrics.Deet sprayed on clothes and hat helps for a while. Just be really careful as Deet destroys plastics. As in depth finder screens! Watch the fine over spray, it goes everywhere you don't want it to. Especially if there is any breeze at all.I carry a head net in a small ziplock, but have never used it. Don't let others scare you off with their tales! If you survive in MN then you'll survive in Canada.I thought you guys from MN were immune to bugs?Pooch"
3444074,Golden Eagle,2015-01-14 06:42:00,2642,"Bugs are on nature's calendar, not the calendar on the wall. I always have a head net, rain suit and bug spray, but very seldom use them. Wind is your friend and will keep bugs away most of the day. As black flies come along, look for yellow butterflies, then dragonflies that will chomp down on every black fly the run across. This is the time to look for a shiner spawn. Fish the spawn bed and be rewarded with plenty of pike and walleye catching. Usually when bugs are active, so are fish. It's all part of the whole deal and it's good."
3444090,bigwalleye1,2015-01-14 06:44:00,2632,"Pooch, we are!! I think the OP was asking what to bring in the event he found some crazy Illini lost and bewildered on an island, and what to drop for him until a rescue party arrives.... Seriously, Micah, the skeeters really are no worse than MN, a little breeze is your friend, and beware the grass in the evening. The black flies are the killers, and Pooch is right, DEET and keep your legs covered when not in the cabin. Seems like if we're fishing near shore, the little buggers will travel over water for food, so I like the zip-off leg pants. Use em if you need em, take 'em off if the weather and wind allow."
3444114,Algoma Guy,2015-01-14 06:52:00,48,"As stated in previous post.......there are ALWAYS bugs in Canada. The time you are going is right around the peak of black fly season in most areas of northern ontario. They will crawl in any little opening they can find and attack. Deet, head net, and bug jacket will be your friends......just don't forget to take the head net off when you spit or eat. I have seen guests do both over the years. Really had not to laugh when you see that! The mosquitoes will be around at dawn and dusk especially near the water. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Usually when you are on the water the bugs will be non existent. A good rule of thumb if the bugs are biting so are the fish! Good luck this year and remember no Canada trip is complete without taking home a few souvenir bug bites!"
3444138,Bakefish,2015-01-14 06:56:00,1077,Don't forget the coppertone sun block. Best repellent for black flies ever.
3444514,Shotgun,2015-01-14 08:22:00,759,"Only the female mosquito bites and uses the blood to produce her eggs. The male mosquito feeds on flower nectar. Now, gentlemen be kind!!!"
3445050,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-01-14 11:56:00,358,Mosquito coils in the cabin work great. We light a few and extinguish them before going to bed.
3445210,Bill Krejca,2015-01-14 12:49:00,6107,"Here's a very short ""I remember when"" tale: We stopped for an overnight-er at Overflowing River, Manitoba, on the way up to Mirond Lake, Sask. It was early June and the weather was warm. Unfortunately we camped in tents. The mosquitoes were horrible. After setting up the tents, I got inside, zipped the door screen together, and the screen became so covered with mosquitoes, I videotaped their landing zone. I had never ever seen that many of the buggers sitting on such a small area. Occasionally , I still show the film to friends who weren't along. The mosquitoes-on-the-tent-screen portion always gets a gasp or two from any new viewers. Some 20 year later, one of my friends who accompanied me still refers to the campsite as ""Overflowing Mosquitoes"". We drove straight through on the way home. Bill"
