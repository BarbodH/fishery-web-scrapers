The fishing is great with trophy smallies, plentiful walleyes and a good chance for a monster pike. Make sure you try the back lake- you won't regret it! Bring a small motor and rent a boat from Ronda Camp, or push your boat up the river. Barry and Marilyn are great hosts and very accommodating. Barry spent a half day fixing our motor when we forgot the gas line!"

1450409,10point,2012-06-17 17:34:00,102,Got back yesterday. We had a great time. We fished mostly for smallies as they were being the most cooperative. Fished the lake that Ronda camp is on 3 times. Got some really nice bass using senkos and a few small pike. Wanted to go past the bay north of the camp but that area was closed until yesterday. Never went north of Ronda camp.
1451038,Guest,2012-06-19 03:38:00,0,Glad to hear you did well. Smallies are a lot of fun. Hard to get tired of hooking up with those. Thanks for the report. Any particular size/colors work better than others?
1451065,10point,2012-06-19 05:53:00,102,I actually use the bass pro brand called sticko's. I only use 4 1/4 inch and mostly watermelon red flake.
1451166,10point,2012-06-19 09:25:00,102,By the way those bass up there taste very good also!
1451502,Guest,2012-06-19 21:04:00,0,"Thanks for the info, 10 point! I do have a few packs of plastic in that color. I'm sure they're quite tasty when eating them freshly caught! We plan to have a few for lunch every day."
1457097,Guest,2012-07-03 09:57:00,0,"Just got back from my week long stay at Ronda Camp on Sunday. It was a very nice experience. We had fun catching lots of pike and smallies all week. Fresh fish lunch and dinners were awesome. Walleyes were less common to our boat, though we caught a few, but we were mainly targeting the pike and smallies. Three of the guys that were with our group have been going up there each year for something like 20 years straight. Our hosts, Barry and Marilyn, were great! We had a little cookout with them, and they hospitable the rest of the time. Barry even showed me how to fillet pike better. I want to clarify that pricing up at Ronda is flexible and meant to save you money by giving you options. There is no nickel and diming you to death. If you can supply something yourself, that's one less thing to pay for, as opposed to a place that has one price that includes all. Hopefully that helps those that are considering staying there. Overall, it was a great experience!"

1460023,10point,2012-07-10 14:47:00,102,Glad you had a good time. Were the bass still close to shore? Would you be willing to share where you caught pike? We plan to go back next year and hope to catch more pike. We only caught about 6 with the biggest being about 24 inches. Is there an email address I could contact you at?

1434750,Guest,2012-05-13 11:26:00,0,"Have been there 8 or 9 times. Fishing is good but insist on getting onto the back lake. Owners are nice but are difficult to get rid of when you just want to rest.(booze) Night time is very quiet so bring your own entertainment. Propane lights are minimal so good lanterns are essential for adequate light in cabins. They will nickel and dime you if you let them. In the town of Shining Tree there is a camp called Bay Wolf Lodge which is where I go now. Fishing is just as good, everything is included in price(boat, gas, bait, cabin, net, minnow pail, etc.) $450.00 per week/per person. Best of luck with Barry! YOU'LL SEE!"
1435009,10point,2012-05-14 07:01:00,102,Haven't been but I am going to Shining Tree Camp the week of June 9th and plan to fish the lake Ronda Camp is on some. Let us know how it goes. LW Pork - it says you are not registered and you show as a guest. I was hoping to send you a PM to ask some questions about the area.
1440056,Guest,2012-05-24 12:11:00,0,"Hey 10point, I'll be in Rhonda for the first time last week of June. I would love to hear about your experiences. Thanks!"
1440062,10point,2012-05-24 12:16:00,102,"Sure, I just hope we get to go. There is a big fire north in the Timmons area that continues to grow and there is a 100 km perimiter that they are not allowing people into."
1440284,north560,2012-05-24 19:24:00,53,"Check with the camp operator as to the fire border. I don't think it includes that area, Highway closed north of 144 and 560."
1443808,Guest,2012-06-02 07:16:00,0,Did you get to go? How was the fishing? Do you know if the fire is under control now? I'm heading up in 3 weeks now...
1443880,10point,2012-06-02 11:11:00,102,"Haven't gone yet. Leaving next Saturday. Fire hasn't grown since the 26th but is about 100,000 acres. It is fine up there right now."
1443883,10point,2012-06-02 11:17:00,102,Fire updates are here. Timmons 9 is now being help instead of not under control http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...ge/268862.html
