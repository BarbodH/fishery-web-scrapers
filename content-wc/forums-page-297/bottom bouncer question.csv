3452289,5richards,2015-01-17 10:46:00,131,"I am interested in everyone's opinion on this method of Walleye fishing. I understand that it can be a very effective way to fish. I have purchased the requisite equipment and have only dabbled with it. It just seems like a lot of hardware to reel in with a walleye. I don't mean to step on any toes, for I know that this is a preferred method for many successful fishermen. Please chime in and help me see the light! I will try it again in the future."
3452377,v-bay gord,2015-01-17 11:23:00,3168,"It is a very effective way to cover some water and catch fish. That said I'm in agreement with you in that it can be a lot of hardware on the end of your line. I tend to scale back on the weight size...........I can effectively fish most depths with just a one ounce weight........but I also tend to fish slower, mostly back trolling or drifting if the wind is up. The straight wire weights are also less complicated that the bent or angled ones that have snaps or clips on them."
3452385,Carnhzkr,2015-01-17 11:25:00,964,"Bottom bouncing is one of my least favorite ways to fish. That said, if you ever see me fishing for walleye, chances are I'm pulling a BB and a spinner. I know that doesn't make sense, so I'll explain.I hate the idea of having a heavy lead anchor between me and my presentation. I think you loose a lot of feel, as opposed to a jig which is tied directly to your line and you can feel a walleye breathe on the minnow. BBs are the tangliest things. I'm usually fishing with 3 or 4 in the boat and it's inevitable that at least once a day we're going to have a major tangle. So why do I keep using them? I've never found a better way to put more walleye in the boat. I admit I'm not a very good jig fisherman, but BBs work, pure and simple. BBs allow you to fish a lot of water that would be very difficult to fish jigging. I've fished the English River many, many times. I've seen it over and over - we'll be fishing fast water above or below the rapids and catching fish like crazy. A guide boat pulls in and they drop down 3/8 oz jigs and after a few minutes of frustration and watching us easily outfish them, they pull away empty. It's a pretty cool feeling.You can certainly cover a lot of water pulling spinners. Some people use this technique to help locate schooling fish, then vertical jig once they find them.If you read about BBing, you'll see that most people have a rule of thumb about how much weight to use. It's generally 1 oz per 10 feet of depth - something like that. To each his own, but I think that's way too heavy. I always use the least amount of weight I can get away with and still feel the bottom. Generally, that's 3/4 oz. No more than 1 oz. unless I'm in current or fishing deep. If I'm in lake water (ie. no current), I'm often using 1/2. I'll tell you one secret I discovered a couple years ago (shhh, don't tell any one else this, it's just between you and me). My favorite presentation to pull behind a BB is a floating jig head with about a 4 foot flouro leader. I lip hook a minnow and pull it slowly to let the minnow provide most of the motion. I discovered this while fishing Lac Seul. Being a reservoir, LS has a lot of submerged stumps and logs. I was pulling spinners around one particular point and catching fish, but kept loosing spinners in the stumps. I put on a floating jig and that kept my minnow just above the stumps and no more snags. The walleye loved it. Trouble was, the northerns also loved it and I lost all of my floaters to snip offs.Now that's all I have to say about that (sorry, I just watched Forrest Gump last night)."
3452449,CKM,2015-01-17 12:54:00,3836,70% of my fishing is done with bottom bouncers (90 deg. arm type) and lindy rigs or spinners. The success with them has been great. I've tried many other ways and always have more success with bouncers. Only time I don't use them is right after ice out where I'll use jigs and minnows or late fall with jigs and minnows. I basically pull cranks when I'm not pulling bottom bouncers.
3452505,JayM5209,2015-01-17 13:24:00,1050,"x2 on everything the previous responders said! I'd emphasize two things: 1) Go as light as possible. I don't own any BBs over 1 oz. and almost all of my use is 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 oz. Occasionally in deep water I'll go to 3/4 oz. 2) I find the BBs with the 90 degree arm to be a royal pain in the neck, especially when storing or leaving on a rod in the boat. I've snipped the arm off all I own and rig the straight wire with weight as a slip weight ahead of the small swivel to which I attach my spinner rig or leader.The BB with floating jig head can be a walleye killer. I like it when moving very, very slowly, including when drifting with a light breeze. In addition to BBs with minnow or crawler rigs, they can be very effective when coupled with a floating stick bait.My favorite of all time is the Gapen Bait Walker. I don't use them much now because they've gotten too expensive to buy at local outlets, even though they're readily available. So much less tangle and hassle than the standard right angle arm BB.P.S. I told a lie above. I do own 2 or 3 3 oz. BBs that I picked up solely for lake trout fishing. I think I've used one two times. If the lakers are deep enough for that, I'm jigging."
3452553,pjshorthorn,2015-01-17 13:47:00,5654,"I've never fished a true BB by definition. I've have fished a similar rig that I guess could be considered a modified version. As Carnhskr and Jay have mentioned in their messages, I'm also a big fan of floating jigheads and have used them for many years with great sucess. The main difference in my rig vs. a BB is that I'll use an egg sinker above a barrel swivel with a floater on about 2 ft. of leader. The egg sinker acts in a similar manner as a BB.......constant contact with bottom. I will submit that it probably is not as snagless as a BB. Additionally, over the course of a few days even with a swivel in line, I do have to run out line to get rid of those dreaded line twists as I like to drift , backtroll and kick the motor in and out of gear in order to stay in constant contact. I probably need to branch out this year and try a BB, but I've been reluctant due to the tangling issues already mentioned. Then again, my Dad is fishing with us this year and he is good for at least 3-4 motor muskies during the week regardless of how we are fishing so I may as well give it a whirl. PjShorthorn"
3452569,v-bay gord,2015-01-17 14:04:00,3168,"I've found this type of weight works well, and can be used as a slip weight with the quick release clip. http://www.hagensfish.com/index.php?...&products=1032"
3452673,man164,2015-01-17 14:46:00,693,"Bottom bouncers are how we fish for walleyes 90% of the time. I disagree with going as light as possible, but I do tend to use a 1 or 1 1/2 ounce most of the time. I fish anywhere from 10 to 25 feet of water with that weight. I like the Cabelas brand best - you can buy a 6 pack relatively cheap and I like to be able to attach it with a swivel. One key to using 3 or more bb in a boat is to alwas use heavier bouncers in the front of the boat. I have successfully fished 4 people out of my boat by using a 1 ounce in the back of the boat and a 1 1/2 or 2 ounce bottom bouncer in the front of the boat. It is a lot to get used to reeling in at first. It also seems like a whole lot more on a rod not meant to use for bottom bouncers. I recommend a rod specifically designed for bottom bouncers. Bass Pro sells a Walleye Angler series rod for around $80 St Croix makes a couple different ones and they start at $120. I would also use a good reel for the rod..... I really like the Tekota that I put on my rod after I destroyed a couple of cheaper reels."
3462242,oilguy,2015-01-20 20:54:00,257,"Gord, I definitely agree that a person can get away with lighter weights in certain situations, but it would be VERY difficult for a person just learning how to bottom bounce to get away with something like you suggested. Without someone in the boat who could show a person a few little tricks, I'd still stick to the suggestions I gave earlier. It's just a lot easier to learn with more wieght than less weight and the fish don't care if you are using 1 oz or 2.5 ozs. If I had to carry only one weight of BB, it would be 2.5 oz. The standard idea of bottom bouncing is pulling a blade at around 1 to 1.4 mph. If that is what a guy is going to do, a 1 oz bouncer in over 15 FOW is pretty difficult to keep it where you want it. A person ends up fishing too high off the bottom, or dragging the whole rig without even realizing they are doing it."
3462386,castnblast,2015-01-20 22:04:00,111,"We BB as much as we jig. And regularly fish 20+ feet with an ounce. If wind picks up a heavier rig helps. I found that kids fish bouncers easier than jigs. It is as simple as it gets and super effective. The only thing I would tell my kids or thier friends when they were just starting was: 1. Don't ever try to cast a bouncer, and 2. Open the bail and palm the line as it drops so the rig doesn't free fall to the bottom. When a fish grabs, you know it."
3462402,castnblast,2015-01-20 22:12:00,111,"Oh ya, also worth mentioning is: There are a bigger few rivers I fish that have narrows with big current. We hold in the current and fish 10- 12' deep slots with 2.5 / 3 oz bouncers that get down fast and kill walleye we could never touch with jigs."
3462410,Lmbkiller,2015-01-20 22:13:00,639,"How come everyone here it seems is using live bait on their rig? I guess I don't see a need for it when moving at a relatively fast speed (1.0-1.4mph). Why not use gulp? No mess, doesn't wriggle and writhe when putting it on, catches more than 1 fish before u need a new one, no significant difference in catch rate compared to live crawlers, in fact, I would argue u catch more fish with it because of it being more ""efficient"" when fish are really biting. Plus, it's more gobie proof (if they are present), little nippers like perch and 2yr old walleye seem to leave it alone better too.....your guys thoughts?"
3462562,Pooch,2015-01-21 06:02:00,4619,"Pulling plastic is one of my favorites for spinners behind BB. Love leeches, but if you get a hit you usually reel in to see if there is any bait left on the hook. Not so with plastic. Just keep going and see if the fish will come back.After a plastic worm gets hammered (worn and stretched enough times) it has a tendency to ""slip"" down the hook or the fish pull it down. Makes kind of a sloppy ""C"" shape and might tend to roll as you move.Sometimes I thread the plastic worm on up the line a little to get the hook nearer to the twisted tail.It's a good way to fish for active fish, BUT leeches will out fish plastic when the bite gets a little tougher. Usually slow down a little and go to live bait (leeches or worms) when that happens. Minnows don't seem to do well trolled. Too fragile. Salted minnow? Maybe better.Gulp? Still not a fan of that product. Have much better luck with Culprit and other plastics.BB weights? The one ounce per ten foot rule is still a good place to start, but with the thinner super braid lines you can shrink that a little depending on WHAT you are pulling. Small spinner blade can get by with smaller BB. Bigger blades, bigger weights.If you have to keep letting out line to try to stay on the bottom you are going too fast for the size weight you are using and need to either slow down or go to heavier bouncer. The more line you let out the more bow you have in your line and the more it floats the bouncer off the bottom.Most of the time you don't want to drag a bouncer on the bottom. Rocks will cure you of that.Pooch"
3462922,Algoma Guy,2015-01-21 07:33:00,48,"Lots of good stuff guys......a little overwhelming for the beginner but a lot of good info. I agree plastics can work on a rig but in my experience NOTHING beats live bait. If there are alot of panfish present or you run out of bait then plastics may be a good choice. If I were to put a number on it I would say live bait out fishes plastics 80% of the time. As far as worms, minnows or leaches any of them can be effective every body of water is different. At home it's almost exclusively worms up north it's mainly minnows and leaches. Bottom line is whatever works for you stick with it and get good at it."
3463034,adempsey,2015-01-21 08:03:00,963,"I like bottom bouncing, especially on flats, but being a lazy guy, I also really enjoy drifting a Lindy or slip-weight Rig. I suggest checking that technique out as well."
3463298,retire55,2015-01-21 09:13:00,1029,"Even though I consider myself a seasoned bottom bouncer, I have enjoyed reading all the various points of view. It's never too late to learn something. Just like to add that I typically bottom bounce by back trolling between 0.6 and 0.9 mph (according to my GPS). I use my drift sock as required to stay within that speed range. I only increase my back trolling speed if my normal speed isn't getting any action. As others have posted, I use leeches, crawlers and plastics on my worm harnesses (I let the walleye tell me what's working at any time of the day). I fish shield lakes in north western Quebec."
3459442,Blue walleye,2015-01-19 19:58:00,29,"I only use bottom bouncers when I am structure fishing or trying to keep my presentation right on the bottom. I mostly use the snap weight 50/50 method, put your harness out 50ft attach snap weight and let out 50 more feet of line then attach to planner board. When you get fish on take off planner board reel up to snap weight take that off and then play the fish and the fish only. That's my favorite way to fish harnesses in open water trolling."
3459690,Lmbkiller,2015-01-19 21:45:00,639,"It's Canada though....fish are more concentrated, water is smaller (I'm assuming your fishing bay de noc) and the biggest difference is an angler only gets 1 line in Canada. Even if u could fish multiple lines in ontario, I don't see how it would be efficient, you would never get all the boards out before u got bit. A big spread just isn't necessary up there, not legal, and would hinder boating fish rather than help IMO"
3459882,oilguy,2015-01-20 04:33:00,257,"Well, it looks like you've got some people chiming in to help you ""see the light"". The problem is, I see more conflicting info that would confuse you more than help you. I do a lot of BB fishing and will try and help you out as much as possible.....here goes1. Stick with the rule of thumb of 1 oz for every 10 FOW until YOU get a feel for how much weight YOU like. The idea of keeping the BB light and trying to fish deep is not a good one! The reason is you have to let out a massive amount of line to get your spinner rig to the bottom and lose the ability to reel in or let out a couple of feet of line to adjust to the different depths you may be trolling through. For someone just starting out, I'd suggest staying heavier than lighter for your bottom bouncer. The biggest thing you NEED to do is know you are ticking bottom and not dragging bottom. A heavy bouncer helps a novice know a lot easier when it touches bottom. The more vertical you are, the easier it is to lift or drop your bouncer to adjust to depth changes or snaggy areas. The people who mentioned they like using light bouncers and then complained about snags and tangles bring it on themselves. Light BB's are NOT good in snaggy areas and are NOT good with 4-5 lines because the angler has to let out too much line to get the spinner to the fish. Trust me when I stress to you that light is NOT the way to go for a novice (or experienced) angler. Especially when you are pulling spinners at 1+ mph .2. Get your speed right for the rig you are fishing.You don't need a fancy boat to learn how to BB fish. The best way for a novice to understand the proper speed is to get the boat going at the speed you think you should be going and then drop the BB into the water and see how your spinner is spinning. Adjust your boat speed until the spinner is rolling at the rate you like. Make sure to check the spinner when you turn and troll the other direction too. Especially in wind! 3. Test different depths until you find fishThe nicest thing about using a bottom bouncer is you can cover water and all depths with the same rig. Take advantage of that until you find active fish. Don't get fooled into fishing a certain area or depth because a pack of boats has formed. The nice thing about walleyes is not all of them follow the same habits in the same lake. I think fishermen like to form in bigger schools than walleye do! LOLYou can virtually get away with any kind of rod for bottom bouncing, but if you have the right equipment, it is just a lot easier. Here's my suggestions for a rod and line to give you the best feel. Use a rod with a solid back bone. Whippy is not your friend. I don't like to say medium or medium/heavy because every rod manufacturer has a different idea of what that is. Basically, if your rod is doubled over by merely trolling your BB, get a stiffer rod. You should feel that distinct thud when your BB touches bottom while you are slowly feeding line out or dropping your rod tip back to check for bottom. Braided line is also a HUGE plus to help you feel the BB making contact with the bottom. If you are in a snaggy area, make sure to keep the BB as vertical as possible and slightly suspended off bottom. When you let the BB down, do not let it free fall to the bottom. Make sure to let the line out at a controlled rate. If you let the BB free fall to the bottom the chance of your harness getting wrapped around your bouncer is high. You won't even know it happened and will waste a lot of time trolling a rig that is all wrapped up. If you follow the above suggestions, it will be easy for you to get good with a BB. Find some less snaggy areas to get the feel for it first. It also helps if your main line is a higher test than your spinner rigs. If you do get snagged and have to break it off, you only lose your spinner instead of your bouncer too. There's no point going more in depth than I just did. This will get you on your way. Until you can understand what your bouncer is doing down there and how your spinner is spinning, there's no point going any further. You can experiment with bait, blade size, snell lengths, speed, hook sizes, etc, etc, but it won't do you any good until you understand how to troll the bouncer and spinner at the right depth and speed. It sounds simple and is simple, but it takes a bit of practice. Stick with a standard spinner harness and then branch out from there. Slow death works, but wait until you master trolling a normal spinner harness. Hook sets should be a sweeping motion (like others have mentioned) but there's no point putting the cart before the horse.Good luck"
3460354,TinCann,2015-01-20 08:27:00,8,Your right on oil guy - We try to fish right under boat I see many struggle with BB's by letting out way to much line. Slow down and feel the bottom !
3460426,CKM,2015-01-20 09:04:00,3836,oilguy-perfect post.
3460474,5richards,2015-01-20 09:27:00,131,thanks oilguy -- great response!
3461154,5richards,2015-01-20 14:42:00,131,Actually --- thanks to all responders!!!
3461346,oilguy,2015-01-20 16:11:00,257,"Thanks for the positive comments. I had to teach myself how to properly bottom bounce because the internet wasn't what it is today. Trust me when I tell you that I gave you a good starting point that will save you a lot of trial and error I had to endure to get it refined. It was actually a good thing because I now know first hand what happens when you use too light of bouncers or troll at improper speeds. You will still catch fish, but you won't be as efficient. Throw in a tub of minnows and some nightcrawlers and you should be set. For most lakes I fish, we find minnows in spring and fall and crawlers in summer and fall but every area is different so do your own experimenting."
3461482,v-bay gord,2015-01-20 17:09:00,3168,"Oilguy....not to be difficult, and I do agree with all your suggestions, especially for someone starting out......but....from my experience I find I can effectively use crawler harnesses and one ounce bb weights in 25 feet of water with no problem. I think though what I'm doing is probably somewhere between jigging and true bb trolling. I back troll slow, just enough to keep moving but in contact with the bottom. This works if you know the general location of where the fish are.....not so good for searching them out. That is where the 3 ounce weight and more speed has it's place. Just wanted to bring this up as there are always variation on any technique depending on circumstance and personal preference. By the way, I do have an arsenal of 2 and 3 ounce weights, and do use them when necessary."
3461770,Blue walleye,2015-01-20 18:33:00,29,"I understand that you can only use one line in Canada. But my partner and I plan to use planer board each and try to troll suspended walleyes at the thermocline. It might work and it might not,,,but worth a try"
3453954,retire55,2015-01-18 09:42:00,1029,"I also use bottom bouncing to search for walleye and similar to Gord, I always back troll unless conditions dictate otherwise. While it may be just what I got used to, I prefer to use a 2 oz bottom bouncer in depths up to 30 feet because I prefer my line angle to be closer to vertical than to 45 degrees."
3454282,FloridaRigger,2015-01-18 11:16:00,335,sounds just like a carolina rig for bass
3454682,CKM,2015-01-18 13:27:00,3836,I use fast action rods bouncing but that probably isn't going to be the rod of choice for everybody.
3456466,Algoma Guy,2015-01-18 21:42:00,48,Imo bottom bouncers and spinner rigs are the second BEST presentation for walleyes........the first being lead head jigs. When water temps are low (opener to mid summer) I almost exclusively use jigs. When the water warms (mid summer to mid sept) it's time to drag bb's and rigs around. Use whatever size wieght you can feel the bottom with. To be honest there is a learning curve associated with bottom bouncing.......don't give up because they are one of the best methods bar none.
3457250,TheDFP,2015-01-19 08:51:00,39,"We fly in so I don't take a variety. Keeps my snags down and puts fish in the boat. I use the 1/2 oz ones from Cabelas that bend at a 90 degree angle. If I need to go deeper, I add an egg sinker up the bottom of the wire and kink it. Can always add more if needed."
3457434,Knoxabilly,2015-01-19 09:39:00,225,"I've never used true bb, I do have good luck using a lindy rigs. I put a bullet weight on before I tie the Lindy to my line, kinda like a carolina rig. I've had great success at Lac Seul trolling this or casting it and working it back to the boat if we've found them! I've also used the floating jigheads and they seem to work just as good at times"
3457498,LLewellin,2015-01-19 10:03:00,1790,Hate fishing with BB'ers but love catching fish with BB'ers! I use 3/4 to 2.5oz depending on the depth. I pull them from .75 to 2.5 with spinners or slow death. Try to keep them at the 45 degree angle. I like a rod with a little give since I fish braid super lines. I have much better hook ups since I move to a little lighter rod. IMHO pulling them too slowly like drifting the BB will just lay on its side on the bottom. Then I might as well be pulling a lindy rig.
3458090,KraTToR,2015-01-19 13:20:00,681,Theres another post on the general discussion board about this. Check it out!
3458122,MrSimon,2015-01-19 13:41:00,922,"BBing can certainly be a hassle .... heavy weights, long leaders, messy worms etc. But I absolutely LOVE trolling along a shoreline watching my electronics and waiting to feel that bump. It's easy, effective and relaxing. Plus its a great way to cover water and tour the lake. I prefer heavier weights and like to keep my line as close to vertical as possible. I like to pick the weight up and down, ticking the bottom. I seem to get most hits right after I set the weight back down and the worm will ""settle"" for a second or two."
3458418,Pooch,2015-01-19 15:24:00,4619,"BB's are a contraption, but they really do catch fish most of the time. Our group BB's probably 70% of the time. Jig the rest.Like mrsimon mentioned, it's fun to be back trolling and on the depth finder see a pod of fish off the bottom and count 3-2-1- ""fish on"" as your spinner comes into the fish you just saw on the screen! As my fishing partner (Bobo) says ""like watching a video game sometimes"".Jigs are a more ""pure"" form of fishing, but it's hard to beat pulling a BB when the fish are scattered and hungry. There's seldom a need for a big hookset on your part. Fish hit spinners just like they do a crank bait. Usually it's pretty obvious. Then again there are times when you have to drop back on a tap and give them another chance.Pooch"
3452753,CKM,2015-01-17 15:38:00,3836,yea weight is the big misnomer with bottom bouncers. they are designed to be fished as vertical as possible and that takes weight. And most people don't have any idea how to set the hook with a bottom bouncer on. at the first tap you give the rod tip. then slowly lift the weight until the weight is in-line with the hook. then sweep. If you just try to set the hook without straightening the bouncer you miss the majority of the fish.
3453257,zeebee,2015-01-17 22:04:00,1144,"Agreed. If Im BB its in +15' of water and rarely do I go under 2 ozs. Dont know where that 45 deg rule of thumb came from but I believe it to be misleading. I use a medium, moderate action rod and have most success with slow death setups. If you have the proper rod, the extra weight is a non issue and provides for better bottom contact/feel and hooksets. The key is the moderate action. Fast tips are best left for jigging."
