3455938,CKM,2015-01-18 18:50:00,3836,I have fished tobin in the fall. That is my plan to run up this summer to try it then. I was just wondering if there was anything further north that was even more remote that would be as good. there probably isn't.

Spring you can catch 40""+ northerns all day long and in the fall the lake trout spawn is awesome and it is normal to catch 100 trout in a day."
