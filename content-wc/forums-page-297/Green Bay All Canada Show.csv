I was there with my daughter Sunday morning and figured (wrongly) it would be empty with the Packer game in the afternoon. It was nice to put a face with the name for you and a couple of other operators I wanted to meet.I haven't been to an All Canada show in about 15 years, it's good to see that it still draws a lot of fishermen and hunters. You can learn a lot with the internet these days but nothing beats a face to face conversation to get a feel for how good a fit a camp is."
