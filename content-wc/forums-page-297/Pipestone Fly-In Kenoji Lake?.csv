3460418,ogokiman,2015-01-20 09:03:00,2,After years of using 2 different outfitters out of Armstrong we have decided to try some new water. We booked with Pipestone and are heading to Kenoji Lake opening week. Has anyone been to this lake or used this outfitter that would be willing to share some info?
3461450,Skyraptor,2015-01-20 16:54:00,291,"Our group went to Kenoji Lake through Pipestone Outfitters for 3 trips spaced out 2 years apart in the 90's. It really depends on what time of year that you go if you want to catch big pike. If you go early in the season (late May to early June) the pike are located in the main lake of Kenoji but as the water warms up the pike seem to move out of the main body and go into the river systems that Kenoji is made up of. We went up there usually in late June-early July and found it hard to find pike in the main lake but the walleye fishing was great. We even caught a few ""blue"" walleyes that are known to be in the lake. We did manage to boat a few 40""+ pike on each trip but had to work for them and that involved running at least an hour up the river system and doing a rapids portage and then a main portage switching to other boats to get to a place that held big pike. Mike Henry the owner goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and provides everything you need to make you trip a success. The cabin is the only cabin on the lake and the only people you might see during your stay will be people canoeing down the river but they are far and few between. The cabin back then is just that, a cabin with solar lights, wood heat and a solar water heater and frig/freezer. During our stay we did have a problem keeping the food cold due to the solar power and cloudy days. If I recall correctly he has a locked A-frame near the cabin that houses the beer and when the pilot drops you off he counts the cases of beer left and when he picks you up he counts again and you are charged for the usage. He use to lock it but found out guys ran out of beer and broke the lock all the time. We have since then gone to a different outfitter since we could not get a good booking date due to repeats always booking the early dates when the pike are in the shallows in the main lake. But it is well worth the one-time trip to experience it. Good luck and let us know how you did."
3461898,Camoclad,2015-01-20 18:56:00,628,Send you a PM. We fished this lake the end of May this summer and had a great trip. Beautiful lake with great fishing. Mike is very easy to work with on the trip planning and he takes good care of his camps and groups while you are there.
3463634,Pikeslayer8,2015-01-21 11:03:00,1460,I know that Mike Henry/ Pipestone has a well run camp on Wabakimi. I also believe that he completely rebuilt the Kenoji camp to be better than first class.
3464186,gordy28,2015-01-21 14:36:00,437,Kenoji is on our radar for 2016 as wellDoes Pipestone fly out of Emo or Armstrong?If Emo - how long is the flight to Kenoji (I see 223 miles but not sure what that translates into fly time)ThanksGordy
3465050,Camoclad,2015-01-21 17:35:00,628,PFO flys from Emo. I believe the flight was about 2 1/2hrs. We flew out at daylight on the trip to the lake and we were picked up around 10am on the return day. Of course it all depends on the weather. We have had delays for fog and rain in the past.
