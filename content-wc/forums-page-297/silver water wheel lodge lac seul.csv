2994674,Mike Kansas,2014-07-14 13:33:00,1463,If you ever have any trouble with a SWWL boat or guide you let Mike Willems know about it and he will address it with his people. SWWL is a first class operation and they do catch fish. Mike is a straight shooter and he wants his entire operation to be 1st class. Mike Kansas
2995594,Skywagon,2014-07-14 17:46:00,1106,"Silver Water Wheel is a first class operation. I would consider that post by a ""guest"" with a grain of salt."
2996562,tlars,2014-07-14 21:37:00,137,I'll second that.
2998618,davenathe,2014-07-15 12:57:00,113,"that is a third, have never fished SWWL, but Mike is always willing to share info and help a person. First Class."
2998858,mr ducks,2014-07-15 13:57:00,1459,"Operation is very well run, service and attention is second to none! I have been there when a guide got mouthy and he was GONE immediately! Mike and Missy run a first class operation. My only regret is that I gave up my standing reservation and now I can't get back in!!"
2999378,windriderhog,2014-07-15 16:09:00,61,I'm not here to stir the pot and I do believe Silver Water Wheel is a good operation but have had the guides pull in rather close considering when we are on a drift or working a point with the bow mount and they are right in the middle of where I've been fishing. It is a big lake with tons of spots to go. Just my experience.
2999442,Aspencreek,2014-07-15 16:32:00,2911,"I have had the SWW boats pull in pretty close to where I was too....but, I kind of took it as a back handed compliment. I got there before them but that told me that I was in the right spot. Besides, I have done some ""following"" and marking spots on my map to hit another day from them, so I figure turn-about is only fair. And I used to watch the SWW fishing reports for some real good info on what to expect when I'm up there."
3447234,IL John,2015-01-15 09:06:00,45,can u bring your own boat to swwl main camp. Were planning a trip this summer and were looking for a new lake to try( never been to lac suel) Not really interested in the western side of Lac cuel looking for something more off the beaten path. Any help would be appreciated
3447274,tlars,2015-01-15 09:23:00,137,"I've been fortunate to fish out of SWWL 11 times - 2 in May and 9 in September. It is indeed a first class operation. I'm a boat owner. I would be very reluctant to pull my boat into SWWL. The first 20 miles or so are maintained logging roads. The closer you get to camp, the less the maintenance. I've been there once when another guest towed in his own boat. He said the trip from Dryden took 2 hrs. plus. The 35 mile drive in takes a little over an hour in a truck/SUV. The road conditions aren't a knock on Mike W., it's just the way it is. Have fun fishing the central basin of Lac Seul. It's a great time."

1520663,MikeMcC,2013-01-07 13:19:00,72,"I would give Mike a call regarding your plans. He will give you the straight scoop for sure. By mid September SWWL might be closing up the outpost. I think you would probably want to concentrate your efforts outside of Vaughan Bay and fish out in the main lake deeper structures. Vaughan is known as more of an early season location. You can be sure that all the equipment and facilities will be in good condition. I know it costs more, but I would strongly consider staying at SWWL main lodge. It's a good value when you factor everything in and that time of year you may get a little deal."
1520675,Mike Kansas,2013-01-07 13:53:00,1463,SWWL is top notch. Never stayed at their outpost but their main camp is as good as it gets on Lac Seul. Call Mike Willems with questions...he is a straight shooter. Mike Kansas
1520676,Guest,2013-01-07 13:53:00,0,"Wolf, Looks like you are from Chicago ? I know Mike will be at The All Canada Show this weekend at Pheasant Run St Charles. Thats a Great Time to see what his operation is all about. Good Luck Fred K"

2874273,Guest,2014-06-06 22:13:00,0,"We have been going to the outpost since 1980. This will be our 35th year the second week in June. Although under new ownership-we are anticipating the same awesome fishing we have had for the last 34 years. Great fishing, service just an outstanding experience. Winoga Lodge is the new owner--fishing should be as good as always. They even remodeled the cabin and added a shower, electricity and running water. We no longer have to run to the lake! It's a wonderful place. You can't go wrong at the outpost."
2874961,btyreprich,2014-06-07 11:19:00,1067,"I have not been to this lodge but am familiar with lac seul as are many posters. Excellent lake - our group would not be eager to check out another lake as we have been going to lac seul for the past 20+ years. Reason for staying with the lake is that we always seem to do well enough even on slower trip to have a good time. With regards to Mike Willems the lodge owner of silver water wheel, I first met him when he was a guide on Lake St. Joseph. I was thoroughly impressed with this young man as to how seriously he took his job as a guide. I think he guided me twice in the few years we went to that lake. Even back then he shared with me his goal of owning a nice lodge with great fishing. I am convinced that if you decide to go to this lodge, you will be treated very well and catch great numbers of fish."

2994530,Guest,2014-07-14 12:56:00,0,"I about got ran over by one of their boats on Lac Seul last year. They think they own the lake. You'd think they would take their name off their boats if they're going to drive the way they do. Didn't exactly add anything positive to my experience there last year. We were also fishing a spot with another boat last year and they came in between us and started fishing. When you have a lake that big, you'd think they could find a better spot than between 2 boats 200 yards apart."
