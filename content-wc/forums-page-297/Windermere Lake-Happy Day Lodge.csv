3423026,Blue walleye,2015-01-05 22:28:00,29,I will be going up to Windermere Lake and staying at Happy Day Lodge for the week of Aug 8th. From all threads I looked at here it looks like the fishing can be pretty good. I will be fishing mainly walleye but want to make an effort to fish lake trout. I was hoping to get a little info from someone who fished there before. I never fished there and I know its big water to cover. From the threads I seen it looks like I should head through the narrows and fish up towards the Nicholson bay for better fishing. Any info that I can get would be great to help cut down the chase.

Many bass were caught over the 15"" limit as well as many walleye over 18"". We caught hundreds of fish in dreadful cold rainy weather last year the 1st week of August. Walleye and bass hang out in typical areas. We trolled, casted, and jigged and caught fish all three ways. The camp hosts are great and it is an easy lake to fish. We never targeted Pike nor Lake Trout, maybe this year. A good fish finder is necessary. No electronic lake maps exist. Buy laminated maps prior to going or reserve a full size laminated map from the Camp. I would recommend buying both the full size map at the Camp as well as the 4 part lake maps from here: http://www.fishingmapsplus.com/ontario/sudburydist.htmBe forewarned, the 4 part lake map contains 2 that are printed upside down so you will have to match them up end to end yourself. The lodge will give you a free 8.5 X 11 map as well. Great place, great hosts, and good fishing. Good luck!FYI we caught and released several blue phase walleye. Very pretty fish!"

It provides plenty of information, especially when you're on the spot or are tracking contours. Reusing your own tracks are especially useful and you just can't do that accurately without GPS. It's also extremely beneficial when marking schooling fish with weigh points. GPS is very valuable at Windermer or any other place for that matte, regardless if you have a map."
3452705,Blue walleye,2015-01-17 15:18:00,29,"Thanks guys, I just ordered a map from Sondra and she is sending it to me, and I will also order the 4 part map,,,thanks for the link. As for gps on lakes with no contour chip I use my handheld gps with Canadian topo maps. They are very accurate in showing islands and bays, where creeks and rivers come in ect. By using the map I ordered from Sondra I will use it to find the higher percentage spots like points around islands and narrows between them or certain bays. I will then go to my topo map on the gps and mark the areas in. That should save me some time finding spots out there. I know when you get out on big water with lots of bays, islands and inlets it can be overwhelming and windermere is pretty big water. Its nice having piece of mind, noing where you are on a body of water like that."
3452929,kzoofisher,2015-01-17 17:09:00,5144,"Agree that GPS can be vary valuable there. One of the best things we used it for was laying tracks to run from one area to another. Saved a lot of time once we had safe paths between islands etc. Sondra will mark up a map for you that will provide some good starting points, too. A piece of advice I got from MrSimon on this site was to search for fish and carefully note the details of where they were. Tons of structure and not all of it is equal. Sure, you caught fish on a drop from 14'-18', but there were big boulders near shore and in the spots with no boulders, no fish. Now that you know that you can repeat the pattern all over. Mark the spots where you get fish so you can return to them. Some defy explanation, at least by me. We had one spot, a hump to 14' out of 30' that always produced fish. Not 200 yards away was another that seemed identical except that it didn't hold fish. And a half mile away was a third that held fish but only early and late. With waypoints on those spots and the patterns of the types of shorelines and points that were producing we were able to consistently get into fish, even though it was our first time on the lake. Good luck!"
3453554,quickster2,2015-01-18 06:53:00,41,"Next time I'll word my post more carefully. Of course a GPS is useful. The point I was trying to make was that during a full week between 2 boats we only saved 1 waypoint and that was for the lodge. The fish were consistently 14 to 22 feet except early and late and tied to structure. We caught fish everywhere we tried just by looking at the lake map for likely spots. Unlike Erie, Saginaw Bay, St. Clair, etc., where we have many waypoints saved. Thanks for all of the feedback. Again, I would never recommend going out on lake without GPS if available."
3456538,adempsey,2015-01-18 22:30:00,963,"I have a map if you want it. Contour lines are in metres (3.28 ft = 1 metre)http://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section01.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section02.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section03.pdfhttp://lineonfishing.com/images/Wind...-Section04.pdfWe fished for Lakers for a few hours one afternoon. Trolling three-way rigs through the deeper areas on map 3, which as only about 70 FOW. No luck. The deepest part of the lake would have been quite a trek for us so we never managed to get there.My suggestion to you is, if you're renting a boat, get the one with largest horse motor they offer."
3458162,MrSimon,2015-01-19 14:02:00,922,"It's an absolutely gorgeous lake with endless numbers of small to medium sized walleye, with a few trophies thrown in.Small to medium walleye will be all over the place, relating to typical structureLarger walleye will hold to the absolute best spots - usually close to areas where you found other fish.Having and properly using good electronics can make a big difference. The second time I went to Windermere I took my own boat with down and side imaging. I literally caught ten times the number of walleye because I was able to make subtle changes in location to target structure.In my experience, by late summer the far end of the lake has much better fishing (there are always exceptions)Don't forget the bass!!!! There are ridiculous amounts of them and they get big. When hunting walleye gets tedious, tie on a topwater bait and blast away at some rocky shorelines. You'll be grinning from ear to ear.We had a ball some days shutting off the electronics, putting the map away, and just running and gunning with in-line spinners.The bush lakes (especially Goldie) are really something special. It's an adventure you'll never forget. Not to mention the bass fishing on Goldie is the best I've ever seen. Ever. Take a look at the attached picture. On Goldie, we caught fish like that one all day long."
3459250,Blue walleye,2015-01-19 19:04:00,29,"Mr simon how big was that bass, looks to be over 20"". My nephew who is going with me loves to fish smallmouth bass. I knew that windermere had bass but it looks and sounds like it has lots of big bass. As for the other post about getting the biggest horsepower motor, I will be bringing my own boat powered with a 115 so I should be ok. I just hope to not hit any rocks out there."
3460330,MrSimon,2015-01-20 08:11:00,922,"Thinking about past trips made me go back through my pics from a few years ago on Windermere. I may have posted these before, but oh well. PS - If you have a good GPS, don't be afraid to stay out after dark - even far from the lodge. We found the fishing in August to really turn on as the sun got low. Just bring bug spray!!"
3460338,MrSimon,2015-01-20 08:15:00,922,"And just for fun, here are some pics from Goldie Lake."
3461738,Blue walleye,2015-01-20 18:23:00,29,"Thanks for sharing the pics, looks like you guys had fun. I just got my map today and been looking it over,,lots of places to fish."
3460282,MrSimon,2015-01-20 08:02:00,922,"I don't think it was 20 .... but not too far behind. We only broke the 20 mark a couple times ... they are pretty rare. But we caught tons and tons of 14-17's and plenty of 17-19s. For us, the bass were noticeably larger and more aggressive on Goldie. We think it's because there is next to no fishing pressure there, but it could have just been weather or luck. Who knows. Windermere is so BIG with so much great looking structure that not all of it holds fish. Sometimes picture perfect spots are totally empty. You have to keep looking. Move around a lot until you figure it out. Since you will have a fast boat, I HIGHLY recommend spending a lot of time at the west end of the lake. There is so much beautiful water to explore out there .... and you'll have the place to yourselves. Not that you can't catch fish five minutes from the lodge, you can ... but there is something special about packing a lunch and making a long run to areas where humans don't normally go."
