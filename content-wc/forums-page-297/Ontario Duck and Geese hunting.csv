3443442,Micah Driskell,2015-01-13 21:28:00,29,Looking for any reports on Duck and Geese hunting in Ontario. How is it and where are good places to go etc.Thanks
3446530,alberta bum,2015-01-14 22:07:00,312,Manitoba or Saskatchewan if you want incredible hunting
3446761,zeebee,2015-01-15 06:05:00,1144,James Bay as good as it gets. Lots of guide services.http://www.gwnlodges.com/Kaska_Goose...ose_Lodge.htmlAs posted above Manitoba or Sask is also world class
3447226,Micah Driskell,2015-01-15 09:04:00,29,Thanks for the link. That is out of my price range but looks like a great place. I am looking for something more affordable like finding cheaper lodging then hunting on our own or something like that. An outfitter would be great but not at that price range for me.Thanks for the info!
3447258,Carnhzkr,2015-01-15 09:15:00,964,"I've fished at Camp Narrows on Rainey Lake, but never hunted. Tom Pearson, the owner, brags about the duck / goose hunting they have in the back bays near his camp. I'm sure he could set you up with a great trip in the fall, or maybe make it a hunting / fishing combo. It's very easy to get to - drive about an hour from Ft. Francis, then boat in seven miles to his camp.http://www.campnarrows.com/"
3447266,Micah Driskell,2015-01-15 09:16:00,29,I will do that...Thanks for the advice
