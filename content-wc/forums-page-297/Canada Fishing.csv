3427042,Micah Driskell,2015-01-07 14:44:00,29,Thanks again to everyone for the help...very excited. Also considering Ghost River Lodge? Or Kabeelo flyin? Lots of options for sure.
3427050,Micah Driskell,2015-01-07 14:46:00,29,Pasha Lake Cabins also looks good.?
3427154,pale ryder,2015-01-07 15:35:00,1937,"I highly recommend Clark's Northern lights on Cedar lake. Great fishing, nice cabins, nice rental boats, and good rates. Clarks also own resorts on the Indian chain, also great fishing. And they have fly in outposts.http://clarksresorts.com"
3427194,SinOrSwim,2015-01-07 15:51:00,1528,"If you do a fly-in, make sure to search this site. There is a ton of great information about what to take, things we have all learned etc about going on a fly-in. I miss our fly-ins. I don't miss the boats but I miss the other aspects of it."
3427282,Micah Driskell,2015-01-07 16:39:00,29,What site was it you suggested looking at?
3427482,P&y only,2015-01-07 17:51:00,133,pm sent
3427922,wallydave,2015-01-07 21:22:00,2151,The guys I went to Red Lake last year are fishing with Gord next July! I doubt you could go wrong going there!
3429098,walleye22,2015-01-08 10:34:00,59,Red Lake/Gullrock area!! HANDS DOWN!! not even close in fishing quality with the cedar/Perrault/indian chains lake area. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Have fished them all for over 30 years. If you want walleye fishing then go to red lake and gullrock area. PERIOD!
3429106,SinOrSwim,2015-01-08 10:37:00,1528,"Search Walleye Central. Look in the Canada section and do a search. It is toward the right at the top. You will find a ton of information on how to decrease weight, what works etc."
3425498,Micah Driskell,2015-01-06 23:12:00,29,"We will be taking our first Canadian fishing trip this spring and trying to decide on either... Cedar Lake, Red Lake, Gullrock, or Eagle lake for me and my two kids... 14 & 15. Looking for Northern, Walleye, and even Smallies and Muskie would be nice."
3425810,Mike Kansas,2015-01-07 07:15:00,1463,Check your private messages at the top right of page. Mike Kansas
3425962,wallydave,2015-01-07 08:13:00,2151,"If your looking for a spring trip, you better hurry! The early season can be some great fishing and that's why it maybe tough to find an open cabin. Taking your sons might mean a mid-June trip after school lets out. Like Mike mentions check your PMs!"
3426242,NARDA 1,2015-01-07 09:43:00,636,"Check out www.birchdalelodge.com they are on Eagle Lake. You can fish for walleye, northern pike, lake trout, smallmouth, musky, perch and whitefish. Owners name is Marcel, lodge number is 807-227-5262."
3426282,tackleman,2015-01-07 09:55:00,444,"if you want fish, the red lake area is the way to go, one thing to remember, the camps fill up early in the spring. but if that is the only time you can get away, contact them right away. or if there is a sportshow in your area, go and talk to the people manning the booths. most times they can tell you when they have openings and their rates."
3426498,ftfarms,2015-01-07 11:22:00,444,I would say cedar lake is your best choice. It's has everything your looking for and you can get out and fish in any kind of weather. The next choice would be eagle lake. Fishing for every thing your looking for is there but it can get rough in a hurry. I like cedar point resort on cedar lake. (centrally located).
3426738,Duflebag,2015-01-07 12:38:00,218,"Micah, all of the recommendations given are great choices, you will have a trip of a lifetime at any of them. I would strongly suggest that you hire a guide for at least one day at whatever resort you ultimately decide to go to. These lakes can be intimidating at first due to the size and number of what could be good fishing spots. Also, the Canadian shield lakes have a lot of hidden dangers just below the surface. Lots of rocks and shallow areas you can't see and aren't always marked. A guide will give you a good start on where and how to fish. The investment is a wise one and often makes a great trip an exceptional one."
3426754,BornToFish,2015-01-07 12:52:00,1224,"Micah, There is some great information above. Like TackleMan, I also strongly encourage you to spend time talking to your prospective lodge owners. Be wary of blind recommendations along the lines of ""I've been going to such and such lodge for x number of years and always catch lots of big fish. The owners really know how to take care of their guests"". What is perfect for someone else might be a disaster for you and your group. It's your time and money, be certain that you will feel good about both at the end of the week of vacation. If you are pleased, you will almost certainly be hooked for life. Consider attending an All Canada type show if there is one in your area. The folks that you talk to at the booth are almost always the people behind the websites. Wherever you settle on for a destination, strongly consider hiring a guide for the first day or two. They will show you some spots to fish and more importantly, proven fishing techniques for the time of the season when you are there. I've seen many people fish on Shield lakes the way they fish back home. These folks often do not do very well. Understanding the differences between the Shield lake they are fishing and their lakes back home, and what to do about these differences, are important keys to fishing success. Tight lines and good fishing!! Memories are there to be made. Go make them!"
3426842,v-bay gord,2015-01-07 13:26:00,3168,"I think those who suggested hiring a guide have a good point considering it's your first Canadian fishing trip, and you have two youngsters who are also going to need some coaching. Rather than pile all the pressure on yourself taking a guide would probably make for a more enjoyable and relaxing trip for you and the kids.....plus you will learn techniques that you can use on your own. If fishing the Eagle Lake area I would recommend Greg at Eagle Eye Guiding www.eagleeyeguiding.com. All the lakes you list would be good in my opinion. Just remember, a big part of a Canadian fishing trip has nothing to do with the fishing.....have fun!"
3426866,jambi,2015-01-07 13:32:00,504,This is great advice. I struggled my first year. Still caught enough to have a wonderful trip but it was tougher than it should have been.
