I have never written one before, however I'm compelled to comment about this resort. I have been coming to Canada since 1976, coming once or twice annually. I had been going to another resort - wonderful people and fair fishing. I have been coming here for the last 5 or 6 years and can say it is absolutely the best walleye fishing I've ever experienced anywhere. I now come 3 times per year. Spring, summer and with a group for bear hunting the first week on September. The fishing in the spring is mostly in one bay - loaded with fish, walleye and northern. Summer is excellent reef fishing with some excellent lake trout spots. Fall we found excellent walleye fishing with aggressive full bodied fish on reefs. My wife, son and his family love this place. A summer vacation spent here was spent with water sports and excellent fishing. The grandchildren even forgot about their electronic devices. I have a nephew who is paralyzed; however is an excellent hunter. He has hunted bear in Manitoba and Minnesota - bagging to small bears. Last fall he came bear hunting with 3 others. We had a total of 14 in camp, 4 bear hunters and 10 fishermen. We ate walleyes every day until they came out our ears! My nephew bagged a 400 lb. plus bear with his bow. He was a very happy man and his uncle (me) looked really good having invited him. He told me it was the best camp he has ever been to. Now all this may not be for everyone. There is no electrical, no TV and Dennis has a no take home of fish rule and a harvest limit of 18Â” on walleye. But do you know what? I'm 69 and my son is 43 and both of us agree the rules that protect the fishery here are well worth it. We live in Iowa, travel to Lake Erie in the spring, catch and freeze our summer supply of walleye. Don't really like to fish Lake Erie, too rough. Thanks you so much Debbie, Dennis and family for caring for your resources.Lee Crook1/15/15"

Sounds like my kind of place.Just a thought - if the website is lacking in recent testimonials, maybe you should write one to the lodge owners."
3448602,38bill,2015-01-15 21:33:00,331,Must be a good place if in the period of 24 hours three brand new members make their very first forum post about how great it is. Hmmmm....

3449169,SinOrSwim,2015-01-16 07:53:00,1528,"LOL I noticed the same thing. Now there are more and they all read like a website. Naming the owners, the boats, the ""quality"" depth finders for a great experience.LOLOL Maybe they are real, but they all read so similarly. Cracks me up.Does look like a nice place though."
3449265,Bakefish,2015-01-16 08:14:00,1077,"4 first time posters recommending the lodge. That must be quite the place to have 4 people actually register on this site and post the glories of the place. Either that, or a transparent way to get free advertising out to their target audience. I'm guessing they're legit testimonials."
3450193,lCrook,2015-01-16 13:43:00,2,"I was the first one to post. I now wish I had not posted, because my family and I have been enjoying the camp apparently with little outside notice. I'm glad I have my three weeks booked. I won't loose those.Lee Crook"
