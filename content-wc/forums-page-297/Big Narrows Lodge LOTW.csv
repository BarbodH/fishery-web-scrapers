3440994,kayakmatt,2015-01-13 06:33:00,105,"I had asked about this lodge in another post but thought I would start a dedicated post.I would like this area because it is on the western side of the lake, and I want to fly into Winnipeg. It's a protected area of the lake also. I have other folks that cannot seem to commit to going with my wife and I until we can give full detailed trip planning info! Ash Rapids Lodge is booked up for when I want to go in June. Shoal lake lodge has marginal boats with no trolling motors, so I wrote them off! Crow Rock Lodge doesn't have trolling motors either, but the owner has offered me his personal camp boat...and last cabin for 2 (guess my friends would not be going). I've used the search feature for these forums, but it appears few WC folks have been to Big Narrows lodge. Should this concern me? Their website is horrible! The owner admits it!Yes, I know I should go to Which Bay, Young's, and all the other WC highly rated places near Morson and Sioux Narrows...but then it makes no sense to fly to much less expensive Winnipeg. I leave Tennessee in the morning and am fishing after dinner! INL cost a fortune to fly into.I've talked to the owner of Big Narrows, and he seems like a nice guy. Has room to spare right now. Says he does his due diligence to work the phone to fill the camp by spring time?!Anybody know anything about the place? I sure do prefer recommendations before I choose a place,"
3442634,wingmann,2015-01-13 17:22:00,42,"Checked out their website. The owner is right that it is pretty bad. I would ask him to send you pictures of the boats and cabins plus the lodge. Was surprised that they are hitting you for gas for the boat, license and transportation to the lodge. Plus lunch is not included in their American plan. You will need to figure all costs into the trip so if you compare other places that there are no hidden costs you might be missing. Good luck."
3445858,zeebee,2015-01-14 17:31:00,1144,"Lunch is a shore lunch under the AP or a bagged lunch if you prefer as per their website. Most lodges charge separately for in-out transportation if required as many guests have their own boats.Paying for gas and license is becoming the norm not exception. Why would I want to pay for someones gas built into my rate if the yahoo is running 15 gallons of gas a day and Im running 4.From what I read, Big Narrows includes far more in their Plan than most other lodges and their rates are competitive.Modern cabin with screened porch or private deck, bathroom with hot and cold running water and shower, wet bar, towels, blankets and linensFull service breakfast and dinner in lodgeUnlimited iceFish filleting and processingLifejackets, landing nets, depth finders, stringersQuality 17 1/2 ft Lund outfitter boats with fifty hp four stroke motorsFull dock serviceHot tubFree laundry service if neededDirectTV in Lodge for sports and moviesUse of paddle boat, kayak and canoeHiking trails for nature walksSandy Beach for swimming, sunning and evening campfireElectric outlets available on the docks"
3446138,wingmann,2015-01-14 19:27:00,42,"Not sure which lodges you are looking at Zeebee but the below LOTW lodges include lunch, all boat gas, license, transportation to and from island where applicable. Duck Bay Lodge Youngs Wilderness Resort Witchbay Camp - license extra Hanson's King Island Lodge - license extra Indian Head Lodge - license extra White Birch Lodge - license extra Clintons Ash Rapids Lodge - license extra (5 gal of gas) Crow Rock Lodge - license extra"
3446841,kayakmatt,2015-01-15 07:19:00,105,"Since it seems no one from WC has been, I will likely test Big Narrows for everyone and report back next June! When I talked to the owner last month,(a retired MD from St, Cloud), he assured me that guest were pleasantly surprised when they see the resort. It's rather large with 12 cabins spread over a fairly big area (unfortunately, lots of walking and some hills). Nice high views from the decks of all the cabins The ala carte pricing, if added up, would still be equal or less others resorts mentioned above for 5 day/6night, as I am seeing close to $1700 pp for the same elsewhere. I never burn more than 5 gallons of gas a day x 5 days=25 gallons @ maybe $4/gal? =$100. Another new expense is they now charge $8/day for parking at the Kenora Rec Center (formerly free).So the big question will be what's the condition of the resorts, boats, how's the food and the service. They are going to send me pictures (hopefully recent) of the cabins.Maybe it all comes down to just a horrible web presence, and website!I searched the entire web and found some pictures on flikr.com. I have no idea who these people are...just wanted to see the lodge! Looks pretty nice with a big view."
