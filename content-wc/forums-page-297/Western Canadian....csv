Saskatchewan offers some off the finest walleye fishing in the north and features a number of lakes and reservoirs that host tournament action with some fairly large prizes offered. When planning to visit out west, think about Delaronde Lake at Big River and the first stop on the tour that continues through the month of June in north-central Alberta with events at Pinehurst Lake, Lesser Slave Lake and Moose Lake in Bonnyville. Hot on the heels of that tour starts the Saskatchewan Walleye Trail with lakes near Regina SK then into southern Alberta for the SWAT. Give Saskatchewan some thought. Contact me for more information on the 6th annual Walleye Classic in Big River this spring. I can set you up with an application and so on. Hope to see you there!"

3425970,Dave Si,2015-01-07 08:14:00,27,The Saskatchewan River is the home of the Vanity Cup in October as well as the Premier's Cup in August. The Angler's Cup in at Slave Lake Alberta in June. Huge prize money and long waiting lists but a worthy fishery for sure.The Sask. River is the result of the North Sask. River joining the South Sask. River then flowing into Tobin. Those big girls we see and read about (I have two 10.5 pounders caught on a #10 Lindy rig) are trapped downstream of the Codette Dam so they co-exist with some giant Northern Pike in the lake. Bucket list quality.

3457906,alanexpup,2015-01-19 12:06:00,278,"HI. we moved to Henderson nv from Chicago and looked for a place that should be good. we decided on tobin and what a big disappointment. caught one little walleye in 5 days. we stayed at a place on the lake so any wind whatever turned the lake into a dangerous place. a guy there at the same time we were had a 21 foot lund and it was too rough for him. if you go hope for no wind or stay near the river to the west. good luck. the pictures of the resort in no way show what it really looks like. we thought we were in sort of isolated resort, no it like a small town."
3460594,Dave Si,2015-01-20 10:31:00,27,It was announced yesterday that owing to a lack of interest from both volunteers and participants (only 50 boats per year for 5 years) and sponsor money drying up that this event is cancelled for the 2015 season. Sad day in this angler's life.
3460602,Dave Si,2015-01-20 10:36:00,27,Bad weather can spoil any fishing trip in a hurry. Seems to happen when we've travelled far and had high expectations. Don't let one bad experience spoil your perception; next time stick to the river in the fall and get your name on the waiting list for the Vanity Cup.
3461202,mrwalleye5,2015-01-20 15:04:00,1922,Sounds like you may have been at Tobin Lake Resort. The wife and I looked at purchasing that resort about 20 years ago but unfortunately we could not agree with the sellers terms. Guessing you were fishing on the lake so it can be tricky. The river is more consistent and easier to fish.
