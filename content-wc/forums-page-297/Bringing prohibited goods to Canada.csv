3448761,btyreprich,2015-01-16 04:13:00,1067,"I buy most all of our groceries in Canada for these reasons: We cross the border when the grocery store in Ft Frances is closed There are many items we like to eat that are just not available outside of our home town Prices - the few items we do buy at the Walmart in Dryden are much, much higher than I pay back home"
3451921,Manitou,2015-01-17 08:30:00,125,Given our falling dollar you should maybe bring money instead of stuff.
3452121,3M TA3,2015-01-17 09:40:00,2846,I've been crossing for over 50 years into Ontario multiple times per year and not once was affected by a Potato ban. What was the first year of the potato ban? Guessing you're way older than I.
3433730,port1042,2015-01-10 11:32:00,509,"There are currently no restrictions on basic groceries (including potatoes) going into Canada so no one is going to make you get rid of them. There were, at one time, restrictions on some items (potatoes) so it is a good idea to check for current information prior to your trip. For the past several years there have been no surprises (at least not going into Ontario). For up to date information check this link: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-vo...-qatf-eng.html You are limited to how much beer/booze, and tobacco products you can take. You also are restricted on live bait (nightcrawlers in bedding are ok -- but not in dirt). No other live bait (minnows, leeches, etc.) are allowed. Salted minnows are ok."
3433754,Andre (wallyandre),2015-01-10 11:50:00,2274,"Much more complicated going in the US with food then going to Canada. I cross the border at least 50 times a year and I also do my grocery shopping in the us before coming back home, and the only thing they care with are: arms,alcool & tobacco and total value of purchases."
3433938,Shellback,2015-01-10 13:14:00,8083,"Okay, Forget I mentioned food. Let's say left handed monkey wrenches are banned in Canada. I arrive at the border, remember I had one in my tool box and told the customs agent I had one. Does he say hand it over right now, or do I have the choice to turn around, return to the states and keep my wrench? How about the states, what option does a Canadian have if he finds he's got something verbotten in the US as he's crossing?"
3434002,v-bay gord,2015-01-10 13:47:00,3168,"I think as long as you are not concealing the prohibited item and you tell them you have it, then you should be able to turn around. I once arrived at the Canadian border after pheasant hunting in Kansas. Wasn't able to bring cleaned pheasants with the feet attached.....had to turn around and go back through US customs. Once in the US I cut the feet off at a gas station and retraced my steps. Another example (perhaps a bit off topic) was after winning a shot gun at a sport show in Green Bay (thank you Ducks Unlimited!) I could not bring it back into Canada until I registered it. Long story short, was able to leave it with the border people in Fort Francis and pick it up after later after mailing in the paper work etc."
3437354,P&y only,2015-01-11 19:01:00,133,I've never had anything confiscated. Pretty easy to read the rules. I've seen a lot of people dumping potatoes into that dumpster. But boy did it make me laugh when we got to the grocery store and bought genuine Idaho potatoes....................Oh well. rules are rules.
3439098,Pymbet,2015-01-12 13:22:00,42,"First year of the potato ban, not knowing, we crossed with a five pound bag. We reported this and were directed to the inspection spot. With the border personnel watching we proceeded to search feverishly in every likely location for the bag of spuds. After 15 minutes with no luck, the border guard gave us a somewhat disgusted look and told us to move on our way. I thought I forgot to pack them and we said no big deal we had plenty of food. Got to camp and unpacked my dry bag with my sleeping bag and there were the potatoes. I guess there wasn't room in the food boxes and I forgot I stowed them there."
3441090,Bigstorm,2015-01-13 06:53:00,799,A few years ago we were crossing at I Falls with some dead/salted bait. We had salted fatheads and salted leeches. They would not allow the leeches to cross and made us take them back to the MN side of the border to dispose of. The salted fatheads were fine.later found out that the salted leeches were legal to bring in but we're not going to sit there and argue with the Canadian Customs when we're on our way into their country.
3441906,FuzzzyIL,2015-01-13 11:43:00,2326,I'm with Polaris-Pete1. Find out what you cannot bring over the border (Canadian Customs site).2. Don't buy those items and pack them for your trip.3. Make time to stop in Canada at a grocery store to buy those items.4. Don't make the mistake to think you can 'trick' the customs officers or that they will 'allow your group'.
3442330,Bakefish,2015-01-13 15:29:00,1077,And that is why pheasant hunting is poor in Canada. What self respecting pheasant would live there without feet.
3448050,KraTToR,2015-01-15 16:50:00,681,"Gents,Being a resident of Canada my entire life and having to deal with customs on both sides of the border, I've given up trying to make sense of their rules and inconsistencies. The definition of prohibited is pretty clear that it means its not allowed. Also remember that if you're caught trying to smuggle in prohibited goods you'll end up on a list which means you may get searched every time you cross.Why not just buy your groceries in Canada? And BTW, there's no problem with our potatoes...LOL"
3433002,Shellback,2015-01-10 05:10:00,8083,"Just curious as to the options when you arrive at the border and find out you can't bring certain goods into Canada. Say you arrive at the border with $200 worth of fresh meat and vegetables for a fishing & camping trip. At customs you are informed that you can't bring them into Canada. What happens, do they automatically confiscate the goods, or give you the option to take them back to the states, then return without them for your trip. The reason I ask, is I doubt that the Canadian or US customs could donate food products confiscated. I'd hate to see a couple hundred dollars of groceries dumped when you could go back across the border and donate them."
3433202,packpro,2015-01-10 07:13:00,695,"Back in the fresh potato banned days, they had a refuse barrel next to the inspection stations. We were told to throw them away."
3433210,Fishoil,2015-01-10 07:13:00,1277,"I don't know what they do with the confiscated stuff but back when they weren't allowing potatoes they had a dumpster sitting there for people to throw them into. We ""donated"" a 50 lb bag and the dumpster was already half full. We bought potatoes in Canada on the way to camp that year and they were almost inedible . We ended up tossing them too after we found out how bad they tasted."
3433234,Fish Finder,2015-01-10 07:18:00,13,"We brought some groceries they did not like and were forced to through them in a garbage bin. We asked they possibly be donated, customs said they were forced to distroy any and all illegal substance."
3433314,Shellback,2015-01-10 07:39:00,8083,"I guess I need to clarify my question some. I more concerned about a couple hundred dollars worth of food or other goods. Do they give you a chance to just return to the states with them, or are they just confiscated. No big deal tossing a 5 pound bag of potatoes, but what if you had $200.00 worth of steaks? I sure wouldn't toss them. I'd spend the time to go back to the US and give them a local church or other organization that could get them to the needy."
3433338,polaris-pete,2015-01-10 08:04:00,343,In my 35 years of fishing in Ontario have found that the EASIEST way of not taking the chance of having anything confiscated at the Border is- do your research BEFORE you go. You can easily go on the Border website and see a list of stuff not allowed. In the Years past many things were not allowed but times have changed and the rules have relaxed somewhat. DEFINITELY do not try and bring any kind of firearms across with you.Good luck fishing.
3433346,btyreprich,2015-01-10 08:07:00,1067,"In all the years we have been going to Canada - I have been the group shopper and cook. Never once did we have a problem with Canadaian customs with regards to groceries. The boarder guards are far more interested in how much alcohol and tobacco each person has. To play it safe, I keep receipts for any and all groceries purchased. I also have a printed menu planner for our daily meals to show - if ever requested - why we have so much meat products. Again, never been challenged on our groceries. Sites I have seen on what is allowed into Canada just mention a ""reasonable amount"" of food. We have two younger teens on the trip and can they eat! I'll just tell the border guard that. Bottom line - I would not be concerned about this issue. Just my two cents worth."
3433354,3M TA3,2015-01-10 08:07:00,2846,"Over the course of the last 50+ years I have averaged probably 7 or 8 trips a year through the Sault , Windsor, Buffalo, or Cornwall, as well as Yarmouth and in that time never have I thrown away or had any food stuffs confiscated. Never. 5 and 10 pounds bags of potatoes, never. Meat of any kind, never. I did however have a friend in another vehicle with our party get sent back because he had ""Canadian Crawlers"" in dirt. Had to take those back. Folks at US Customs rolled their eyes and the folks at the toll booth sent him back to Canada without a second toll charge on the bridge."
3433586,Manitou,2015-01-10 10:45:00,125,"Never mind food, leave yer guns at home. They will take them, especially handguns.Never ever say you are not carrying when you are."
3433634,Seanik,2015-01-10 11:03:00,218,"Blanket statement not entirely true! Long guns( hunting rifles) with proper permits signed at border are permitted to be brought into Canada for hunting purposes or other activities such as shooting competitions. Absolutely NO handguns for the average person but competition shoots for handguns, not sure of the import procedure. Seanik"
