Perhaps your inquiry fell through the cracks? Things happen. I would CALL them directly. I used to be on your end and yes, it's like herding cats. Good luck with your trip. Going to be a great summer -Fisherman Ted"
3438082,Obabikon,2015-01-12 07:26:00,2370,"While I agree that timely responses are very important... the above part of your comment was not accurate. Many remote resorts have radio or satellite phones, and dial-up does not work."
3438162,SinOrSwim,2015-01-12 07:42:00,1528,I do like the fact many of the good lodges have facebook pages. Being able to see real time pictures as guests are there is way better than waiting for someone to update the summer full of pictures at the end of the year.
3438234,adempsey,2015-01-12 07:54:00,963,"Yes, that's the best route to do it as well. Have a brochure style website and a Facebook page (or something similar) with reasonably regular updates. Anyone can figure out how to use Facebook."
3438290,v-bay gord,2015-01-12 08:19:00,3168,"Every lodge has it's own personality, with owners that span the entire range.....from eccentric to ""strictly business"". While I agree with most of the sentiments expressed about websites and marketing, the bottom line is that lodges do not fall under a management umbrella. They are not Holiday Inns that need to meet a guideline. Part of the charm for many guests is that where they go is different.....and has an atmosphere they enjoy. That may include the fact it is not on the cutting edge.....the owner is not website savvy and a bit of a throw-back to the past. A great website is not a guarantee of a great trip. Perhaps we need to embrace and enjoy the eccentric nature of lodges. Soon enough they will all be booking on line and being run by bean counters.... Isn't half the fun of travelling trying to decide where to go?"
3438394,SinOrSwim,2015-01-12 08:40:00,1528,"I agree with this. But there is also a difference with sending an e-mail asking questions about dates etc and one place will typically answer back the same day and another will answer back up to a week later. We had a fly-in place that changed hands a few years ago. We inquired about filling some gaps he may have a summer or two ago. It was like 2 or 3 weeks later he responded. We obviously didn't go.I have to imagine scheduling is a difficult portion of running a lodge. But, it is also difficult on our side. If we have 4 to 10 guys that typically go on a trip, finding a time that is agreeable to everyone is not as easy as it may seem. Work commitments, family stuff etc. So, by getting back to us in a timely manner allows us to nail down a date that works for everyone. I would also venture to guess the lodge owners that participate on this site are not the people we are referring to when it comes to poor communication and lame websites."
3438482,Pooch,2015-01-12 09:41:00,4619,"If camps were cookie cutters in personality, charm, amenities, etc. it would be boring. Each camp is independently owned and reflects the personality of the owners. Some are younger and tech savvy while others are (like me) a dinosaur or throwback to simpler times. Some camps we book via email back and forth while others never return emails or phone calls. All are good camps with good people, just different and we know how to work around each.Here I agree:Emails for booking need to be answered promptly. Like the others have said, holding a group together and getting dates that work for everyone is like herding cats.Phone calls need to be returned in some timely matter for the above reasons.Websites need to be kept up to date as far as rates and cabin availabilities. Cabin pictures of ALL cabins inside and outside are great. Don't show me only your newest cabin when we will be in an older cabin. NO surprises please. We don't care if we are in an older cabin, but would like to know it before hand.A simple map of the camp itself for ""new to the camp"" folks is nice. Showing cabin location, etc..Though not necessary, a web based weekly fishing report is fantastic, if it is kept current. If not, get rid of it.Current camp information, if essential to incoming guests and is very helpful. Minnow / leech shortage is important to our group. If I know something unusual is going on, we can work around it. Don't let me get into camp to find out if I could have brought in bait or supplies. NO surprises!!What's new or has been replaced around camp since last year is a nice touch. Shows the owners care and are working at maintaining the camp.I was seriously thinking about buying a camp several years ago. Glad I didn't! Way too much work and I'd probably never get to go fishing plus I'd have to smile and be nice to people who sometimes don't deserve it.Sounds like everyone in this conversation want the same thing.Pooch"
3438506,LOW1,2015-01-12 09:52:00,2828,"I agree with all those who posted about the great appeal of avoiding franchises and uniformity. That applies to not just resorts but also to restaurants, etc. At the same time, I worry about whether the next generation of visitors will even consider going to a place that does not have a current and vibrant website. I wish it were otherwise."
3449321,zeebee,2015-01-16 08:27:00,1144,"While it doesnt take too much surfing to agree that websites could use more attention, be careful what you ask for. I could spend a day with a camera and another at the keyboard and make a silk purse outta a sows ear. Having said that if I owned a lodge I would put more effort into websites than most do. Approach a fishing trip by first selecting the body of water you want to fish...after all thats what its about for most of us. Make sure boats are in good shape. I like to hear motors are replaced regularly.....every year is good. Most important.....adjust your expectation accordingly. Ive been on tent trips and Ive stayed at cabins with leather furniture and dishwashers. In the end its the fishing that I remember. Talk with the owner over the phone and get specific answers to whats important to you. Start being influenced by websites and you will likely be disappointed. Lodge owners generally dont have much to worry about booking into early July....they are almost all full regardless of websites.If you havent made money by mid July as a lodge owner.....you aint gonna make it. After that period they've come to realize word of mouth and repeat business are the influential factors."
3458234,MrSimon,2015-01-19 14:32:00,922,"Ding. Ding. Ding. A very large portion of current trip-takers are folks in their 50's or older. They aren't getting any younger. Lodges could really benefit from marketing strategies designed to reach people/families in their 30s. The web and social media are the only way to go. As an aside .... most people I know aren't interested in fishing trips when I bring it up. But, if I can convince them to go, I can't get them off my back asking when the next trip is."
3467026,OffCourse,2015-01-22 09:31:00,17,"We are having an issue with this now. We have a large group. Usually 10 to 14 people going to the same place for 4 or 5 years now. It has been about a week since their last response to us regarding our booking. In addition, they changed the pricing structure on us. It has always been 4 days fishing but this year is per night. So, not only did they increase their rates a little bit (nothing crazy by any means) they are charging us one extra day compared to what we have been charged in the past. Same exact trip. But, each person cost increased by about $200 with the daily increase on top of the extra day of charges. But, not responding to our emails is extremely frustrating. Getting 12 guys schedules together is not easy. It sure doesn't seem like they really care whether we come back or not. Very frustrating.We have been looking at other lodges but finding a place that can accommodate our group in one cabin is difficult. Plus, their facilities are extremely nice. But, it is horribly frustrating to have owners who don't seem to care whether we come to their property or not. I have to imagine at the end of the year a group like us is almost all profit. Just cabin/boat rental fees would be over 7K in revenue. We are very close to pulling the plug and going somewhere else though."
3435986,Mike Borger,2015-01-11 10:12:00,1554,"Agreed! Communication (or lack thereof) is right up there with web presence as the two single most important aspects in generating new business.A prompt response is expected, and often that's not the case.I mostly do fly in trips so when I'm researching potential new venues this is what I like to see:-A clear, concise breakdown of each lake with photos of both the inside and outside of the camp. -Videos are an enormous bonus.-A map of each lake-a non confusing, non cluttered format with up to date photos.While I have yet to use Nestor Falls I do believe they have an excellent website! This is precisely what I like to see:http://nestorfalls.com/outposts/"
3436002,kzoofisher,2015-01-11 10:18:00,5144,"If they have a phone they can have dial-up. Talking on the phone is going the way of the telegraph, with email and especially texting taking its place. Resorts that have trouble communicating by email during the season need to partner with someone who has a good connection if they want to still be in business ten years from now. If dial-up is too slow for uploading pics and such there are other options. Heck, how many resorts make a run into town weekly for supplies? I'll bet they could find a wifi hot spot to use and update their sites every time. Many owners seem almost to object to digital marketing and I've noticed this with sporting goods stores as well. They get started with a bang and stop updating after a while. Wish I had a nickel for every time I checked a fishing report only to find it is a month old. Or a resorts site or FB page whose last update is June of last year. One of the biggest things for me is water temps in the spring and fall, the bait shop that posts it is the one that will get my business when I head in their direction. For pities sake folks, send a kid down to the dock every day with a digital camera and get enough pictures to update two or three times a week in the off season. Offer guests a coupon for couple dozen minnows if you use one of their pictures on your site. Ask them if they ever shoot any video and welcome them to put it on your FB page or website. It's free for you to ask so any return is a win."
3436018,kzoofisher,2015-01-11 10:32:00,5144,"I don't know what it costs to have a professional overhaul a site but I'm on the board of a conservation group that has a website with weekly fishing report updates, lots of pics each week, news, links to other sites and ""greatest hits"" archives of past years. Costs a couple hundred a year to maintain."
3436410,adempsey,2015-01-11 13:16:00,963,"It's a big commitment to constantly update a website. Especially if you want daily or weekly updates on what's happening.If it were me and my business, sure, I would try my best. However, I can understand why it doesn't happen. I'd settle for a good layout, informative content and recent photos. Media is so important these days. Of course, I am sure some of these places would turn away people if they had photos to look at, lol!I assume another problem is the cost. The companies that do website design often vastly overcharge customers. I think that's been a big deterrent for many of the outfitters. So, sure, it's minimal cost to pay your host and for your domain name, but if you're not doing it yourself it can be cost prohibitive.Maybe it's time to start the ""website for a trip"" exchange program =)"
3436442,port1042,2015-01-11 13:36:00,509,"If you show a link for ""fishing reports"" then keep them up to date. If your not going to update the site -- don't say you will. By late July I often find the report link leads to 6 week reports."
3436450,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-11 13:37:00,461,"Wow, you have touched on something I have preached to my fellow lodge brethren. How can someone run any business and not respond to an inquiry in ANY fashion, let alone a timely one. Every summer I book at least TWO trips for the only reason that I called a fisherman back in a timely fashion. I didn't do some fancy add, post on Facebook or hook up through networking. Last year one fisherman (6 guys) called 3 places and waited a week. A week. Nothing. So he called me. All I did was call him back. I can't make this stuff up."
3436482,dutchboy,2015-01-11 13:59:00,5717,"I'm old school. If I have a phone number I will call it. ONCE. If I leave a message and don't get a response I will not call again. It doesn't matter if I'm booking a trip, buying a boat or ordering a pizza. You get one shot to get my money, please don't blow it."
3437114,kzoofisher,2015-01-11 17:35:00,5144,"This isn't website related but is part of the lodge owner communication thing. Was just going through yesterdays mail and got my winter newsletter from Happy Day Lodge. Aside from the usual reminders about check ins, licenses and contest winners they included a chart of the MNR's findings after seven years of conservation regulations. Numbers of big fish are up! Good stuff to get in the dead of winter!"
3437778,bob888,2015-01-12 04:38:00,244,"I wish that GPS coordinates would be provided. Google Earth, Bing Maps can provide useful information of exactly where the resort is, surrounding areas and also show shallow water areas that I find useful in scouting for small mouth bass."
3438018,kayakmatt,2015-01-12 07:02:00,105,"Mike Borger has likely provided the lodges he visits with more target marketing by using his trip report website that the lodges own website! I know I am very interested in some of the places he has blogged on!A website is not that difficult and inexpensive if one gets a template design and adds the context and pictures and videos themselves. There are hosted ones all over the internet...just got to take the time to learn it and do it. If an owner skipped a show or two...they would have time. Yes, if you get an outside source to build your site, and you have to have them add every update for you, yes, its going to cost a fortune to maintain."
3434954,kayakmatt,2015-01-10 22:01:00,105,"I realize that camp owners may not be the best website developers, but as a guy that spends countless hours seeking new places to go on my Canadian trips, I get aggravated about these poor websites. Thanks to Walleye Central, we can ask for recommendations.I tell lodge owners that a great website may easily take the place of doing couple travel/boat shows. (to be honest, I have no idea!) When browsing lodges, I want to have info on the boats (engines, 2 stroke or 4, depthfinder/gps, trolling motors), cabins (bedrooms-privacy if wife comes, full size fridge, kitchen, sink), the lodge (meals), hidden costs (parking, ice, bait, transportation).Is there anything else I am missing?In the internet era, online booking, Trip Advisor ratings, and every other website and internet means sure would help a surfer like myself make travel decisions. Seems like a no brainer to me. Sure would beat living in hotels all winter doing boat shows."
3435042,adempsey,2015-01-10 23:45:00,963,"There are some really great sites, but you are correct, many are horrible. Some look like they are from 1995!! Nothing is worse than having photos that are obviously from the 70's or 80's. Obviously cost is the primary factor, but I think a lot have migrated to Facebook as well.Of course, from a business perspective, you have to really understand where your clients are coming from. I have a feeling the internet isn't necessarily the most important source."
3435122,Mike Borger,2015-01-11 05:18:00,1554,"You're right and it drives me crazy too. Nowadays customers do almost all of their research online, if you don't have a good website it's a huge negative."
3435338,JAY221,2015-01-11 07:10:00,877,"I'm sure some are from 1995 or older! Many are not kept up very well,but,I have had very good response when I have contacted the camp with questions that the website doesn't clearly answer. Later, Jay"
3435466,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-11 07:54:00,461,"Matt, I couldn't agree with you more. In my opinion your internet presence is the most important marketing tool of a lodge, bar none. Years ago it was shows. Not anymore. And I know I will ruffle the feathers of some of the old guard here but shows are a thing of the past. Fun to go to, yes. Explore and talk to lodge owners. But to book a trip? Usually not. I can look at a 100 lodges from the comfort of my couch, whittle them down and then reach out to a lodge owner personally. Matt, to prove (and agree with) your point I have never done a sport show in the 6 years I have owned my lodge. Not one. My marketing dollars are best used elsewhere.But when you want to go anywhere or buy anything what is the first thing 99% of people do? Hit the internet. Looking for reviews, comments, pictures etc. And a lodge owner's web-site is the most important piece of that. It has to be up to date and more importantly engaging. One must be able to easily navigate the site and have quick answers to all questions as described above. And since SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is so essential your web-site builds right into that (along with lots of other tools, back-links etc.). Without SEO and a great web-site people won't even begin to find you. For the cost of doing one show (which for the uninformed isn't cheap when you add in travel, fees, hotel, food and labor) your entire site could be re-vamped.I had a lodge owner tell me once (and this is a very high-end place in Montana at like $1,000 a night) that when someone calls up and asks for a brochure he essentially writes off that customer as a potential new client. His web-site has far more information (and can and is current) than any brochure. A great web-site will get guests to the next step which is a call/email. A bad one will push them off to your competitor.-FT"

3435602,kzoofisher,2015-01-11 08:31:00,5144,"Some do have terrible sites, hard to navigate and not particularly informative when you do find your way around. Others are very good, makes you wonder if the bad sites check out the competition or if they have no idea what can be done. I doubt that developing a really good website costs as much as attending one or two shows so the investment seems well worth it. Also, younger people are far more likely to do their research online. Having a bad or hard to find website costs more customers every year. Things that are important to me in a website: 1. A clear menu that lists the options for fishing, hunting, accommodations, boat rental, bait, guiding, etc. and directions from various cities and border crossings. 2. Straight forward costs. The lodge is ___, each cabin is __, boats come in __ varieties at __ prices. Bait was approx this much for minnows last year, this much for leeches and this much for worms. Gas averaged_____. 3. Brief yet detailed descriptions of the accommodations. Bedrooms have doors or they don't, I shouldn't have to guess. Indoor and outdoor cooking facilities. Private baths or common. Power, wifi etc. Pictures are a must. 4. Same for boats including electronics, motors, seating, livewells etc. 5. Typical menus for the American plan. 6. The best map of the lake available. If they have to splash a big copyright across it that's OK, I want to get an idea of structure within 1,2,5 miles of the place. 7. Docking with pics. 8. Regulations for that body of water and any portages. I would especially like to be able to print them if they differ from the general regs. 9. Testimonials are nice and all but give me a link to websites like this one where I can get a variety of opinions. If you've got the guts to do that I'll assume the vast majority of your customers leave happy. 10. A calendar of bookings would be awesome. Maybe I've only got a few possibilities and you're already booked for those dates. Now we both know and won't waste each others time. I'll also know that if I want to come to your place I'll need to plan further ahead and that you probably have a lot of repeat customers. What do you guys like to see?"
3435690,Ogoki,2015-01-11 08:53:00,291,"I hate to sound so negative here, but my biggest complaint , both with hunting, fishing and my work related web searching, is the lack of a return email on an inquiry. If a business has a website with an email address , then an inquiry should be answered. If you call a business you expect an answer. If I send an email I expect an answer. I do know many businesses who follow thru in a timely fashion . If I send two emails and no response, I wrote them off. I have ran across a couple who stated please call , do not email . Some fishing camps , in remote areas do not have good internet service or none at all. Understandable ."
3435914,onetimedave,2015-01-11 09:44:00,502,It is time for these lodges/outfitters to update and get in the real world.

Some have a ok site but they do not update them often enough, just looked at one and the site was good but photos were 2009, a lot changes in that amount of time. I'm not Internet savvy by no means just didn't grow up in that era but believe me if I can learn any can. Does any one know what the cost is for an average web site to be updated annually ?"
