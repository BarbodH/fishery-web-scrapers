I am able to get on the site that you are talking about without any problems. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...hp?showforum=2"

3440802,Juls,2015-01-13 04:41:00,13414,"""You are not allowed to visit this community"".....Sounds like maybe you were banned from the site. Is that a possibility?"
3440834,pwbmlr,2015-01-13 05:16:00,37,I highly doubt that since I never post on that website. I only go to view articles that are cross posted via this website.
