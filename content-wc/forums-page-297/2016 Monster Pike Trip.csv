3444098,prov1800,2015-01-14 06:50:00,5010,Check out clarkes northern lights camp on cedar lake.they have outposts up north also as another option.
3444178,prov1800,2015-01-14 07:01:00,5010,Haha.fish dont always follow the rules.my first guide trip on eagle last year found us dodging ice flows on the main lake.we travelled to osborne bay from temple bay lodge and had 70 degree water in the back bays also.walleyes were there as well as the northerns.they do need to go where the food is.they will hunt in those areas but retreat to cooler water.smallmouth were still very deep then and caught pike on mid lake humps as the were targeting the smallmouths.those were large pike.still have to play the game.
3445666,jWN,2015-01-14 16:44:00,62,Your group can most likely can drive to Great Slave lake in less than a 36hr drive. You will not find much better opportunity to catch trophy fish of a life time. With gas prices going down it maybe something to research.
3445746,Mike Borger,2015-01-14 17:05:00,1554,"There's lots of very good drive-to destinations for trophy pike but I probably wouldn't choose driving to Yellowknife. Even if you do trailer a boat large enough to handle the lake most of the truly great world class pike fishing is too far from Yellowknife to be safe. You can drive to Hay River and park/launch but it's not a great idea as there's a great chance your vehicle will be trashed.Nipigon has already been mentioned and yes it's amazing. Without a doubt world class trophy pike as well as lake trout and brook trout. You do need a large boat and be willing to camp though.One drive-to destination I've always wanted to try is Reindeer Lake in northern Saskatchewan. You can drive to Southend Saskatchewan (at the south end of Reindeer ), park and launch and away you go. The lake is something like 120 miles long and is renowned as having some of the best trophy pike fishing in the world.If you don't want to trailer a boat or camp there's some very inexpensive lodges at the south end that are worth looking at, Nordic Lodge being one:http://www.reindeerlake.com/The original poster asked for destinations within Ontario, but if you're considering broadening your horizons shoot me a pm, I have lots and lots of great info.Cheers"
3446793,jWN,2015-01-15 07:06:00,62,"Yes Reindeer Lake is a drive to lake. I have made the trip to Southend. It is not a bad drive but if I wanted to fish the lake again I would go through Lynn lake and get further up the lake and a similar drive. 1st time on Reindeer it came to the end of the trip but could not make the trip out due to a strong south wind that blew for 2 days straight. That lake can get nasty! Unfourtently we did not fish for much other than walleye, we meet a local guy on the water that directed us to a small lake that feed into reindeer that was the most remarkable walleye fishing I have ever dreamed of for numbers size was 3 to 5lbs nearly every cast."
3438970,dhottle,2015-01-12 12:32:00,163,Lakers unlimited on lake Athabasca is were I caught my trophy pike. I have also fished Lac La Martre & the Talston river off great slave. All three will give you an excellent shot at a trophy.
3439122,pike50plus,2015-01-12 13:34:00,584,"North Caribou Camp, EddiesNorth (or the other outfitter further NE of Eddies, same river chain) and Sportmans Lodge on Little Vermilon.For the price talston is tops for pike, but probably not big eyes unless you go early season."
3439162,jWN,2015-01-12 13:51:00,62,If money isn't an issue look at Northern SK lodges or NT lodges.
3439194,BornToFish,2015-01-12 14:03:00,1224,"My best trophy class pike fishing has been very early season and very late season. These trophy fish tend to be concentrated at these times of the season. I catch nice pike during the middle months of the open water season, but not in the numbers of the early/late season. Regardless of place, weather sure can make or break such early or late fishing trips. Being at your place of choice a week too early in the spring could be a disaster in terms of not having open water. The flip side can happen in late season. I mention the above such that readers have their eyes wide open when making their decisions for a fishing trip. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3440026,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-12 18:24:00,484,"Thanks a bundle guys, some great places you have recommended. Some mabe a bit out of the range in air miles for 2 in the party. North caribou and a couple others are on the short list so far. Some great places out there and some it looks like can be a logistics night mare to get there."
3440394,prov1800,2015-01-12 20:20:00,5010,Big pike in ontario is all about timing.if you want a shot at some big fish you need to book your trip earlieras big pike do not like warm water.by the time the surface temp reaches 55-60 degress the will already be going deeper.you wait any longer and your out of luck catching them by casting.they can be caught deeper by other means.you didnt mention when you where thinking of coming up.so just keep that in mind.the further north later in the year the better.thats why those 1000 dollar a day camps way up north catch larger fish through out there season.i have some good camps to suggest you go to bt let me knowcwhen you want to be here.message me if you like.
3440458,Mike Borger,2015-01-12 20:49:00,1554,In general I agree with you however we caught a lot of big pike the last week of June last year on North Caribou and the water temps in the back bays where I caught them was 70 degrees by midday. Was very surprised! I fully expect to catch many more though this year earlier in June.
3440826,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-13 05:12:00,484,"Prov1800, I know time of year is important, in the past we have fished LOW, LacSeul Wabbigoon, all with good results but nothing better than 38"" and not many of them, other than the hammer handles in abundance, although we haven't really targeted them as walleye was the game plan. I personally would like a mid June trip. Early June is a bigger gamble I think. This year LacSeul is our first trip mid June and I will be trying some trolling with bigger baits for Pike. I've been gearing up with some trolling gear this winter, after reading other threads here on WC on trolling. Never been on a fly in so that part sounds fun. A remote rough camp is ok if that's what it is. If its modern with comforts of home that's ok too. Pretty easy going group of guys open to just about anything and actually all can fix/repair/build just about anything you could think of, ages from late 40's to late 50's so all have been around the block a few times. Lol. Mike, I'll be looking for your report on North Carabou on your return. A couple places mentioned really stand out in the value area and deserve a second look."
3441674,walleye IA,2015-01-13 10:03:00,129,"Interesting Lake Nipigon has not been mentioned as it's often referred to as a big Pike hot spot. I haven't had the opportunity to fish these waters, but I hope to someday soon. I know many folks on this site have traveled to Nipigon and based on there comments it's definitely a hot bed for massive pike.I realize there isn't a fly in option on the lake which you are looking for, but perhaps camping on secluded a island may somehow interest you. I have done many fly in's and I still love something about roughing it.Good luck with your search. Can you really go wrong....I think not."
3441746,doc,2015-01-13 10:26:00,143,I second what hottle says about Athabasca. We have both been there enough times to know it is very consistent in size and numbers. Generally June would be the time to go but I was there in August one year and caught a few high teens and lots of over tens. The lake is so cold all it takes in a wind to blow into a bay and it cools off with pike moving in.
3437178,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-11 18:07:00,484,My self and a couple avid fishing buddies are thinking on booking a fly in trip in Ontario 2016 for some Monster pike/walleye fishing. Small group of maybe 6. What would your first choice of lake and outfitter to go with. There's a ton of outfitters and lakes to choose from. A first class fly in has been on my bucket list for many years and I would really like to have a week of arm blistering tangles with some monster pike. Cost is not really a huge factor for that special place. Any help in some recommendations would be great.
3437226,dutchboy,2015-01-11 18:22:00,5717,If you got the coin............Wollaston Lake Lodge I think the name is.
3437362,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2015-01-11 19:02:00,629,"Blades-n-Beads:#1. I understand that your initial question was for Ontario locations. However, you were also very positive that you wanted ""Big Time 'Northern Pike'"" action. #2. I would recommend that you look into the following facility:www.talstonbaypike.com out of Fort Resolution, NWT. I had the privilege to spend 8 days @ this camp on the South Shore of the ""Great Slave Lake"" @ the mouth of the ""Talston River"", in the Fall of 2000. We picked-up our float plane flight to the camp out of Yellowknife, NWT.#3. There were 7 of us who made the trip, & as a group we caught between 1200 & 1300 N. Pike. Our tally of pike over 40"" , was in the neighborhood of 350+ & several were @ 50 inches. 100's of 36""+ Pike & only minutes away from camp. For that trip, (early Sept.) the ""Whitefish were staging @ the mouth of the Talson River for their spawn. The N. Pike werethere for a feast! By far, the greatest fishing trip of my lifetime!#4. Getting there will not be cheap, but if your looking for a ""Bucketlist"" type of adventure, give this a serious look & consideration. During the Fall of 2000, I remember the overall total cost of the trip from Cedar Rapids, Ia. to be in the neighborhood of $6,000-$7,000. #5. It won't cost anything to @ least take a look @ the website, & who knows, it maybe just the ""Buckelist"" type of trip you could be looking for!!Set the Hook, CRJohnP.S. Feel free to PM me if you have further interest.P.S.P.S.-- #1. Go to the ""Search"" feature here on WC & look-up the original post: ""Great Slave Lake, NW Territories"", & look for the Thread:""Fishing trip of a lifetime"", & my post #19."
3437426,phishfearme,2015-01-11 19:16:00,1242,you should consider Way North Lodge out of Red Lake - fly way north to fish Favourable Lake and also some of their other lakes - like Setting Net Lake. phish
3437458,Mike Borger,2015-01-11 19:25:00,1554,"Looking strictly within Ontario North Caribou Camp on North Caribou Lake is hard to beat.-Big water = big fish, and the lake is massive.-Very light fishing pressure, there's no lodge on the lake.-Accomodations, boats and motors are top notch.-They fly out of Thunder Bay now which is way more convenient than Pickle Lake.I fished it the last week of June last year and had an amazing trip. Here's the report:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/no...-pike-walleye/In my opinion it has fishing equal to what you might find in northern Manitoba or Saskatchewan.I'm headed back myself the second week of June this year and can't wait."
3437498,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-11 19:39:00,484,"Dutchboy, I took a quick look at Wollaston and your right on needing the coin. Some monster fish on that water. Big turn off for me is they won't let you land or handle and release any fish, I guess I may see there reasons here I just don't think I'd be to pleased to land a 50"" pike and not even hold it for a photo or two, **** I'd probably kiss that size a fish. But that kind of pike are what we are looking for. I will check out every recommendation as this is going to be a special trip."
3437850,Fish Finder,2015-01-12 05:54:00,13,"Always had good luck on Lac Suel, known for its trophy walleye and northern pike. Have been staying at Whitewing Resort for a few years now with never any problems. Dave and Bobbie run a clean resort, cabins are great and modern (wifi and satellite tv), good equipment and always a lot of fish! Would be my suggestion to you, check them out!www.whitewingresort.com"
3438538,Mike Kansas,2015-01-12 10:13:00,1463,Not in Ontario but if you really want to catch monsters every day check out Lac La Matre Nothwest Terriority
3438730,spoonchucker,2015-01-12 11:13:00,82,I have done fly-ins in various provinces for over 30 years. The most incredible pike trip I ever had was Edmund lake Manitoba - the outpost for Elk Island Lodge. Take a commercial flight to Winnipeg and then you are set. I would be going back this year except he raised prices and that priced some of my group out and we did not want to abandon some of the guys in our group. Here is the website that details our trip as reported in the magazine article.http://www.onthewater.com/canadian-d...-pike-fishing/
