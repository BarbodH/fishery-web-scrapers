2985729,MrSimon,2014-07-11 08:33:00,922,"Excellent point about being prepared!!!!! A few weeks ago a guy in my boat landed a medium sized 35"" musky. It was the first one we've ever landed, so it was unbelievably exciting. I'll admit, we were not prepared to properly net, un-hook, and release the fish, and it had a bass-sized rattle trap deep in its throat. Our regular pliers were too short to reach the bait. The un-hooking process didn't go smoothly, but fortunately we were able to get her back quickly and un-harmed. If it had been a big musky, our lack of tools would most likely have resulted in the fish's death. After some quick shopping (about $135), we now have a large net, very long double jointed pliers, jaw spreader, hook cutter, and landing glove. I keep all the tools in a box that can be accessed easily. Now if we could just catch another one to practice with the new tools"

3451905,Manitou,2015-01-17 08:26:00,125,"""allow fish to be wasted"" is a vague term that allows some latitude by the officers. There is also a law against leaving fish remains anywhere.It's ironic, as a son of a commercial fisherman we used to throw hundreds of pounds of cull up on the shores at various locations around our licence.None of it went to waste, and it was all gone the next day.We also used to dress fish as we ran, throwing guts out for the seagulls. It was quite a party.Nature has it's own way of taking care of these things even if the law doesn't explicitly recognize that."
3452393,LOW1,2015-01-17 11:31:00,2828,"What is the legal thing to do? What is the ethical thing to do? These questions may have different answers. If the catch is legal, you have the legal and moral obligation to avoid wasting the dead fish. This is the responsibility of the angler. The obligation to avoid waste cannot be rationalized away by saying that nature will take care of the carcass. If the catch is not legal, you cannot profit or benefit from it by keeping it without approval of the authorities . You do not have the legal obligation to report the situation to the authorities. But that is the moral thing to do, and to abide by their instructions. (They may be puzzled by why you contacted them, and they may tell you to simply eat the thing, but making contact with the authority is nevertheless the best solution to the problem) An analagous situation would be if a trapper unintentionally caught a protected furbearer - he can't ethically or legally sell, waste or keep the fur."
3452897,Obabikon,2015-01-17 16:51:00,2370,"LOW1 is right. There actually isn't much (if any) latitude in the law. The officer might show some, and he might not. The law is simple... If the fish is legal you MUST KEEP IT (end of story) If the fish is not legal you CAN NOT KEEP IT. If you do, you're subject to a fine. Now, any given officer MIGHT or might not say that you were morally doing the right thing. However, that doesn't mean that you didn't break the law. I like the way LOW1 stated it... the moral thing and the legal thing aren't always the same choice."

I've never been able to NOT fish for pike. ""I will not waste other game fish that I catch by chance.

""Well, what if those ""three trophy pike"" were three trophy walleye or three trophy muskie, or bass or salmon or lake trout, or whatever?"" - why would the species make any difference? I have no idea what your attempted point is. ""Would you kill three trophy deer and then ""release"" two of them? If you think that there is a difference between those two scenarios, please help me to understand"" - once you kill a legal deer and one is your limit, that's the end of your deer hunting. if you intentionally kill another one it's illegal. does someone really have to explain to you the difference between fishing and hunting? I have no idea what your attempted point is. ""I have never been to a camp where there is not one person who would not help you clean a pike, if that is your hang-up."" - what makes you think this is my ""hangup""?? maybe you should re-read (or read) the original post.

2981945,phishfearme,2014-07-10 06:23:00,1242,"ok, I think we've beat this up enough. this is not a black and white issue. from a practical point of view, if you keep an illegal, accidentally killed fish, you have no recourse - you are guilty of violating the law and the evidence is right there. if you release it though and it doesn't survive then your guilt is much less obvious. and one other important point - just because you release it and it swims off - that does NOT mean it will survive. from what I've read, exhausted fish may swim off but their chances of survival are not good. and large pike tend to exhaust themselves MUCH more than large walleye. I have been fortunate in my many trips to Canada to have caught numerous large pike - it's an experience that every fisherman should have. at this stage though I will not specifically target pike - how many does one need to catch during a trip or during a lifetime? catching large pike is dangerous to both the pike and to the fisherman. I have scares to prove it and I'll bet most of you do too. but you just can't NOT catch pike while fishing for walleye - so then I think we need to fall back on what many of you have said - do your best to release it with as little damage as possible. phish"
2982153,Guest,2014-07-10 07:41:00,0,"I am assuming from the context of your question that the walleye that you were referring to was in some way illegal. Otherwise, its butter and flour time! The answer, if the fish is illegal (out of season, under or over size, over limit, illegal gear, etc.) is that the fish must be immediately returned to the water. By regulation, this must be done in a manner which causes the least amount of harm to the fish. Even if the fish were dead, it must be returned. DON'T YOU PEOPLE GET IT!!!!!...if you kill a fish and its legal, keep it, if not throw it back."

Rather than basting the angler who accidently kills a pike, my wrath is reserved for those who catch and release deep water walleyes....knowing full well there is a high mortality rate. But heck, they swim away right? They use the excuse that ""the eagles have to eat too""...... Perhaps the law pertaining to ""waste of fish"" should be applied to those anglers.........."

I think this also applies to summer time lake trout ""catch and release"" fishing. bringing these sensitive fish up from great depths - and large temperature changes - cannot in anyway be good for their future. to me both of these are only justified if you plan on using each one you catch for food. phish"
2983769,Guest,2014-07-10 14:26:00,0,"Oh I get it. They are referring to fish you are culling from your livewell. Officer, I kept this slot fish because I was sure it was going to die. Good luck with that. Just saying."
2984201,Obabikon,2014-07-10 17:29:00,2370,"Phish, Post 11 is not in the correct context. If the fish can be legally kept, it must be kept. If the fish is illegal for any reason, it must be released. That's as black and white as it can be. It is not a judgement issue in the eyes of the MNR. Its actually very simple. For the fisherman, it is a little more complex... wasting a beautiful fish or breaking the law. Each individual will make that decision on their own."
2984241,v-bay gord,2014-07-10 17:56:00,3168,"It is black and white. The bigger issue is we all have to be better at what we do. How many people buy musky baits....3 trebles....with no idea how to get that bait out of a fish if they catch one. No release tools, just no concept. One might say clued out. That's why topics such as this are very relevant and should be educational....not confrontational. Thanks to the original poster for pointing out what most of us will have to deal with if we continue to fish. Be prepared....it's as simple as that."

I will not fish for species that I don't want and I will not waste other game fish that I catch by chance. I don't want to seem ""holier than thou"", but people need to be responsible for their actions.My original reply was about the legality of disposing of unwanted game fish ""in the weeds"". And not just any game fish, but to use the OP's own words, ""three trophy pike"". The OP seems to feel that having ""three trophy pike"" hit his lures and then die on him was a little inconvenient. What else could he do?Well,what if those ""three trophy pike"" were three trophy walleye or three trophy muskie, or bass or salmon or lake trout, or whatever? If you are fishing for pike, or any other species, for that matter, but don't want to keep them, or take responsibility for the ones that don't survive, perhaps you should take up a different sport. Catch and release is legal but you can't ""release"" a dead fish. You own it. Would you kill three trophy deer and then ""release"" two of them? If you think that there is a difference between those two scenarios, please help me to understand.Also, in 50 years, I have never been to a camp where there is not one person who would not help you clean a pike, if that is your hang-up. Many camp owners and others take pride in showing how to extract the maximum meat from a pike.Also, I have to wonder,if you fished with the OP and had a medical emergency, would that be inconvenient as well?

In a nut shell, leaving an accidentally killed, non-legal (for whatever reason) fish in the water/weeds is not a waste. It is also a LOT better than illegally keeping it and risking harsh consequences. If the dead fish IS legal, then try to find someone who will eat it. If you can't, leaving it for wildlife to consume is a perfectly fine alternative. Putting it in the garbage IS a waste. Above it all though, we should all do our best to catch and release fish in a way that does the least amount of damage."

I think the comparision to Deer hunting or bird hunting is quite valid...... in this case you chose the sport of fishing and that involves eating fish, if you chose the sport of fishing only for catch and release and not eating , that is fine too, but then you will have to get way better at techniques to catch and release under all circumstances. in a dilgent as possible manner.

2981673,Jesse-WI,2014-07-10 00:28:00,534,"This cover the fish is not legal and will not survive situation: Go to question #124, http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html If the fish is legal and will not survive situation: GENERAL PROHIBITIONS  IT IS ILLEGAL TO: Abandon fish or permit the flesh to spoil, if the fish is suitable for human consumption. Releasing a fish that will not survive and allowing the flesh of that fish to be wasted is an offence. Any fish not live-released are part of your catch limit and your possession limit. Feeding the eagles, gulls, etc is a no-no."
2981777,Obabikon,2014-07-10 05:04:00,2370,"I'm sorry, but it is illegal to keep a fish that is not in the slot size. I have asked multiple MNR officers. Even if the fish will not make it, you can not keep it.Reasoning... people could keep fish out of the water until they can't be revived. Or, they can start ""gut"" hooking big northerns or musky. Or, just throw them in the cooler and say they wouldn't revive. Anything other than leaving the fish in the water, and hoping it revives on its own would be subject to fines. It is NOT an offense to leave it. Since the fish is ""illegal"" to keep, they do not consider it ""suitable for human consumption"". That is the letter of the law... and that is what MNR officers will respond to. So... it can be argued until we are blue in the face. However, the facts are, you can't legally keep illegally sized fish (never, never, never, never... under any circumstances).If you are concerned about a fine, then don't keep it. If you're willing to accept the fine to do what you feel is the right thing... then by all means. We all know that speeding is against the law, and is subject to fines. Most of us are willing to drive too fast if the situation warrants it."

2976609,v-bay gord,2014-07-08 15:36:00,3168,"Just because a fish dies doesn't mean you can legally keep it. It may be in a slot size. It may be a trophy size that has restrictions. You may already have your limit. It may be out of season (ie refer to musky comment). Saying you kept it illegally because it died will not fly in front of a judge either. Too many people would be filling their freezers with those ""accidentally"" killed fish. Bottom line is let common sense prevail. It's good to have this discussion before such things actually happen. Brush up on release techniques, have the proper tools, and modify lures to simplify release.......that's about all you can do."

The next time it happens to me I should pretend to revive the fish and let it slip into the deep blue only to have it surface belly up. I understand that better catch and release measures are needed BUT it is going to happen from time to time no matter what you do. If common sense, logic, and trying to do the right thing is not a good enough defense then we are all doomed to just ""throw the thing in the weeds"". Pretty sad commentary! And lets answer your question with a final thought, ""who's job is it""? That would be the guy doing the ""Hard Job"". I have an explanation, it's reasonable, I didn't want to keep the fish but it left me with the choice of ""throwing it in the weeds"" or taking it home and consuming it. But to drill anyone of us with a big ticket when it is not that difficult to see that it was gill hooked (See the blood everywhere) and we do not have any other violations, MY reaction would be let it go! The DNR, MNR, and conservation officers everywhere could use some GOOD pub, do you not agree! They do have a tough job, but don't make it tougher by being cast in stone, rule abiding, ticket writers when you don't really have to be. Spreading some good will goes much further than that ticket.

Should the C.O. feel you had the right intentions and lets you off, so much the better, but it can't be a surprise if he follows the letter of the law. So am I saying don't follow your gut instinct...not really. We can all make that call when it happens.......and it happens to all of us. As far as CO's needing to spread good will, I'm sure it happens but none of them want an unprofessional reputation, so the ""spreading of good will"" will never be advertised."

The siwash always seem to set in the corner of the mouth with the added benefit that the line is less likely to get bit. Some of these spoons do double duty for lakers and the ease of hook removal coupled with significantly less damage to the fish make it a good choice. It is a win win all around. When replacing the hook on the split O ring, make sure the hook point is directionally down...ie the contour of the hook follows the contour of the spoon and you are good to go. You know its right when the hook point is down as the spoon swims."

Besides if you can't filet one, I must ask the question why you are trying to catch one?Deep frying is always one way, But try this:After cleaning, chunk the filets in 3-4 in pieces and let stand in a small amount of salted water (cold) while getting the rest of the ingredients ready. Start your grill. Cut up slices of potatoes, lots of onion, butter or similar and a large sheet of aluminum foil. On the foil place your fish, and vegies and liberal amounts of butter and lots of black pepper. Add any additional spices as you see fit. Fold over the aluminum foil to create a large pouch that will hold what you have. Once the grill is hot place the pouch on it and have a beer, flip the pouch over about 5 min per side or when you can start to see steam coming out and hear it bubbling inside. Take it off the heat and let it rest for another 5 min to let it continue to cook inside the pouch. POACHED NORTHERN!!!The best thing is, IF there are any left overs you can take the fish, crumble it and combine it with VERY thinly sliced onions (so thin you can see thu them) mayonnaise and more black pepper, and make a spread. Place it in the fridge overnight and you have a spread on crackers or even sandwiches. Guys in my group look forward to the crackers, cheese, and fish pate plate before dinner just as much as dinner itself.Like I said, its happened to all of us, make the most of it."

We try to only kill a fish to eat it. Tossing it into the weeds is a big waste. There are always situations where fish is wasted, but we try to avoid them."
2973153,new hips,2014-07-07 17:12:00,498,"Single barbless hooks on all my spoons, I've been doing this for years. I had a big one die on me while targeting walleye, tried to revive for over 45 min. had to let it float away..........not worth the fine in my opinion. We were on Lac Seul and were checked most every year we went."

Learn to work through the gill plate (rather than the mouth) when removing the hook.......a 'hook out"" tool or similar device is handy. Another suggestion might be to switch to baits that can have the back hooks removed if this is a reoccurring problem. Other than that, try and use the fish to the best of your ability and within the game laws. Worse case scenario something in the wild will be well fed that day."
