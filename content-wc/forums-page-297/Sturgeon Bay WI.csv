3444778,Thompmd,2015-01-14 09:49:00,320,My wife/I are going there for the 1st time next year in Mid-June to try and catch some smallmouth. We will likely fish for some other fish as well depending on what is biting. We will have our own boat and wondered if anyone has spent any time there in Door County.Thanks in Advance

We don't waste our time with smb anymore, we go salmon and walleye. If catching smb is your cup of tea, great, u will catch about as many as u can handle"

Look online and you will find a lot of videos of guys fishing smallies there showing some good techniques. Jig fishing them with wackey worms, tubes and Flukes is common. May of the fishing shows do trips there. In Depth Outdoors, Gillespie, etc."

3449697,Lunkerhead,2015-01-16 10:16:00,65,many guides to choose from as well. Dale Strosheim (Wacky Walleyes) who is the one always fishing with Gillespie and Brett Alexander to name two well known ones
