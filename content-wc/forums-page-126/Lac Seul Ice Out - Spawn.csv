6320958,JaysBucs,2019-05-13 10:40:00,4,Hi All. We are heading to Fisherman's Cove on Lac Seul June 1-8 and are curious if anyone knows when the ice went out and how the water temps are or if the spawn has started. We are really looking forward to a spring trip. It has been a long time since going in June....have had several fall trips lately so looking forward to getting back to try early season. Thanks!

6321310,prov1800,2019-05-14 11:35:00,5010,"Most everywhere is ice free.was still ice on saturday on some lakes,might be a few ice cubes floating.I fished cliff lake and it's all gone and was reading 42 f water temp.usually they will be spawning in the sanctuaries and other places,bays and some shorelines where water temps are warmer.usually the east shorelines on lac suel is where warmer water comes from other sources.thats where the best fishing will if you want to the trip.slower fishing near fisherman's cove as the water temps on that side are always colder.most guys seem to fish the far end of Mackenzie bay or head into broad and sunlight lakes."

6322028,lazermule,2019-05-16 14:57:00,86,"Hey Prov, How does the water level on LS look at the moment? I was there October 1st and it looked to be down 2-3 feet. Thanks, LM"
6322184,prov1800,2019-05-17 05:20:00,5010,Talked to Blair from onaway and he said it's up

6322248,David Anderson,2019-05-17 08:11:00,2073,"Yes, Looking at the site as compared to last year it looks like the water level is about 12 - 18 inches higher, enough that we'll probably go through the Rags next Tuesday on our way to Chamberlain Narrows."
