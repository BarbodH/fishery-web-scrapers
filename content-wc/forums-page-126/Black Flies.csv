6317876,BornToFish,2019-05-04 13:30:00,1224,"Greetings, There was a similar post on this forum a few years ago. Someone offered the following comment: ""Nothing seems to work as well as September"". More true words have never been spoken (or typed). Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6318422,Chrispy,2019-05-06 12:33:00,2,Head over to Bass Pro....they have a product called Repel 100....100% DEET
6318480,The tank,2019-05-06 14:25:00,340,A couple of years ago the mosquitos and black flies was at there worst. We had every thing in the boat. Copper tone -100 % deet-some thing I cant remember. All work for a hour on mosquitos but not black flies. I had a spray bottle of Buggins and a squirt bottle of white mountain insect repellent and a squirt bottle of bug soother. All worked real well. I would suggest Bug Soother it smells good the other 2 not so much. Anouther draw back on the other 2 is they have oil in them. Last year I burnt my feet real bad in the sun after applying the one with oil in them. Bug soother is made in Columbus junction Ia.
6318584,Golden Eagle,2019-05-06 18:44:00,2642,I associate black flies with great fishing. Dragonflies come along and eat plenty of black flies. Little yellow butterflies are coming along indicating the beginning of a shiner spawn. Locate a shiner spawn and fish it hard a couple of times every day. Try not to draw a crowd. Spawn lasts only about 3 days.
6318672,tv4fish,2019-05-07 05:34:00,2694,Another vote for the Coppertone 50 - it DOES seem to work. We also use a Thermacell --- but out in the boat (with any wind) -it is not very effective Sitting still and playing cards - works well............
6318782,johnboat,2019-05-07 09:36:00,2014,"Without a question Coppertone Sport. I don't know why, but I don't care. Just make sure it's the SPORT. I use a thermacell as well for skeeters."
6318820,hoppy63,2019-05-07 10:31:00,367,"Have not had issues with black flies while on the water. Last year was the worst for me in my limited number of trips up north. (6-7) The walk through the wood from boats to cabin.....you didn't mess around! At cabin sitting on porch, if there was no wind the thermacell worked great. If there was a breeze, the black flies were not an issue. We keep covered up (comfortably) in LIGHT colored clothes, and dab on repellent with deet and seemed to be fine. Also surgical gloves can be helpful to protect hands from bugs (as well as keeping fuel off hands when filling gas tanks, and keeping repellent stink off hands) I really like the September idea....."
6318892,Lake Of The Woods,2019-05-07 14:05:00,124,"I have spent countless hours in the bush while working for the Forestry and Firefighting Departments at the MNR in Kenora. Tried many approaches to battle black flies, deer flies and mosquitoes. Here's what I found worked for me,... duct tape around my ankles wrists to keep the buggers from getting under my clothing,... a mesh/screen hat with shirt collar up around the base then,... yes, duct taped. Also drank lots of lemon citrus water along with a good supply of lemons to cut in half and rib over my face hands and any other exposed skin.Took daily doses of oregano oil with water. Also a few times a week we would take Wormwood tincture with water as a precaution against getting Malaria from mosquitoes. Wormwood is the most bitter beverage you will EVER taste,... but it works.Stay away from that toxic DEET,... it'll kill ya."
6319070,rather-be-fishin,2019-05-07 22:18:00,429,BUGGINS Extreme Fly Repellant worked good for us last year. Also have used White Mountain Insect Repellant & it works but is oily.

6317742,Speedy,2019-05-04 05:50:00,619,I'm looking for recommendations for a repellent that would work on black flies thanks in advance
6317748,Freytown,2019-05-04 06:17:00,770,Well it's like ice cream...everyone has a favorite. Mine is Repel Insect Repellent Sportsmen Max Formula Spray Pump 40% DEET.FThttps://www.walmart.com/ip/Repel-Ins...d9&athena=true
6317754,camp chef,2019-05-04 06:33:00,915,Coppertone Sport 50 sunscreen.....BEST blackfly repellent ever. I wouldn't go to Canada without it.

6317758,Freytown,2019-05-04 06:39:00,770,I got a BIG head....just sayin' FT
6317774,madnomad,2019-05-04 07:00:00,34,i love my thermacell!
6317786,That Minnesota guy,2019-05-04 07:23:00,8293,They are amazing.
6317790,big popi,2019-05-04 07:30:00,635,X2 - it is the only thing I found that would work
6317800,fsz,2019-05-04 08:06:00,144,95-100% deet has been the stand by for years. The only real question is what is second best if you can't stand high percentage Deet.
6317874,jburns,2019-05-04 13:19:00,31,"When we go up in June the black flies can be beyond terrible, especially in the evenings. I've given up on most products and have found different clothing items work best. I use the following; an old pair of sweats with the the elastic at the bottom, thick long socks tucked over top the pants, long sleeve shirts with built in hood and face mask, sun protection gloves, then just a hat and dab on a little off around the few exposed parts of my face. I'm not winning any fashion awards but can enjoy the top water bite for smallies at the end of the day while others are constantly spraying and going crazy trying to keep those things off them. Also, I don't smoke but lighting up a cigar or those plastic tip black and milds will somehow clear those things out in seconds. I usually bring a pack or two and use them if tired of wearing a face mask, keep puffing just enough to keep them cleared out."
