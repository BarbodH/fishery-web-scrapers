6320956,JaysBucs,2019-05-13 10:35:00,4,Thanks everyone for the net info. Always good to hear experiences of others.
6314990,JOE WALLEYE,2019-04-25 05:15:00,753,"Ketty, I would recommend you check out ranger nets. https://www.sportsmans.com/fishing/f...SABEgKi9PD_BwE I know it is $20 more than your stated budget but is a very high quality product made in the USA. They also offer this one which does not have the telescopic handle right at your price point https://www.sportsmans.com/fishing/f...yABEgIqIPD_BwE"
6315082,kettyspanky,2019-04-25 09:20:00,271,Thank you. They both look pretty good. I don't care if they are telescoping or not. I'm going to see how much shipping is and maybe order the $40 dollar one yet today.
6315474,Aspencreek,2019-04-26 08:05:00,2911,"If you have an old net with a good frame, just buy the replacement net, they are available just about anywhere and save yourself $$$$$. I recycled an old northern net, measured the diameter and got a replacement rubber net to fit, 2 small screws and I was in business....$20."
6315528,kettyspanky,2019-04-26 10:22:00,271,"Aspencreek, you are also on the right track. I thought about doing that also. The rubber one on ebay is $21 which has shipping included. I might just do that. I'm thinking it would be nice to have 2 nets in the boat. I'll have to think it over. Thanks for the suggestions."
6315628,Aspencreek,2019-04-26 15:19:00,2911,"I don't worry about having a Northern/Musky net in the boat because they are not allowed in the boat, boatside release only!!"
6315644,Yellow Fever,2019-04-26 16:33:00,1809,"Another vote for the RS net, bought 2 last spring ( I got the Kellys Island) and put one of the yellow Painter/sander handles on for the extension and the other i left without the extension. I can get a 3 hook crank out in 30 seconds and my old rubber coated net at times i had to cut the mesh. I would like to see the net a little deeper as I use it for Salmon and Lakers. Big fan of a quality product"
6315710,tv4fish,2019-04-27 05:38:00,2694,"But, But --- When you catch a nice one of those that are ""picture worthy"" --- they just don't show up very well down in the water.................."
6315738,TitanD,2019-04-27 07:10:00,43,"Waste of money, space and a complete hinderance most of the time. A cradle fo land large Pike or Musky maybe. Our group realized long ago if u lose a fish at the boat so what. We got sick of getting tangled in them, the fish getting tangled in them and having the fish thrash about in the met catching hooks in them which required surgery to remove.They generally are hard on fish too. We just figure we will catch another if we lose one at the boat......no big deal! Learn to properly hand land fish. Its easy, quick and efficient.Good luck"
6315786,Aspencreek,2019-04-27 09:20:00,2911,"A picture is worth a thousand words....well maybe, but handling those things is NOT worth the slime, the flopping around, the hook removal, the possible surgery to remove the hooks that will eventually get embedded from the flopping, and the black flies and other insects attracted from a 1/2 mile radius by the residue from the catch. No...boatside release, besides nobody needs to see my picture. The same way we don't need to see the picture of those folks who are falling into the Grand Canyon, good grief."
6317752,Freytown,2019-05-04 06:25:00,770,"Ditto, I just finished replacing all my nets to rubber. I used the frames I had and bought replacement rubber nets at a fraction of the cost. FThttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.tridentflyfishing.com/fi...ubber-net.html"
6313664,JaysBucs,2019-04-21 16:19:00,4,I'm looking to upgrade my net before LacSeul in June and am looking at 2 as of now: RS Kelly's Island net Ego S2 Guide net Looking to see if anyone has good or bad experiences with either. Is there another net that is better? Thanks!
6313666,That Minnesota guy,2019-04-21 16:24:00,8293,"I don't know about better but I like my RS net, although it is a bit heavier then others. Could be attributed to the heavier construction."
6313744,Aspencreek,2019-04-21 20:47:00,2911,"Since I switched to my rubber net, my life has been so much happier. No tangles, no hooks in the net, the fish seem happier with no flopping around to hurt themselves and much faster release back into the water with no net cuts in the fins or slime removal."
6313758,WallyWarrior,2019-04-21 21:46:00,2488,"Either of those are fine choices. Of the two, I like the slider, with exception to how the net screws on. Have also had a couple get stuck in open position. I wouldn't go rubber because the drag in the water sucks. Coated netting seems best. I personally switched to the new frabill pro this season, but the jury is still out. I love the handle, but hate the part of the net that says frabill and is filled netting. The drag sucks from this single, unnecessary feature. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6313762,Juls,2019-04-22 01:45:00,13414,"I've never used the Ego, so I can't compare them. But, as for the RS Net...I would go with the Green Bay model over the Kelly's Island, just because of the size. The Kelly's island net is very big, and I find the Green Bay to be sufficient even with the big walleye here in Lake Erie. The little smaller size is easier to handle too."
6313776,Jeler,2019-04-22 05:13:00,92,Picked this one up 4 years ago and really like it's size and strength!Quite easy to pack up for a fly-in also.https://www.norsemenoutdoors.com/pro...t-bass-net-80/
6313788,tv4fish,2019-04-22 05:57:00,2694,"I will ""echo"" Aspencreek's comments. I have a rubber net for walleyes and a larger/sturdier ""regular"" net for northerns. Great combination."
6313836,Aspencreek,2019-04-22 08:00:00,2911,"A rubber net will have more drag thru the water...but I don't chase fish thru the water with the net, they come to me, scoop and score. And I don't know why, but the fish seem to ""settle"" into the net and don't flop, release is SOOO much easier with less stress and slime removal. I also devised a forearm cup which allows me to use it one handed."
6314720,GWC,2019-04-24 09:44:00,1021,I carry a couple of these in my boat. I saw them one one of the walleye fishing shows. https://www.amazon.com/Entsport-Grip...-2-spons&psc=1
6314982,kettyspanky,2019-04-25 04:28:00,271,I'm looking at a new net as well. I am looking at rubber nets. I looked on line and at fleet farm and Walmart. I don't want to spend over $40. I know its not much but I wouldn't use it more than 2 weeks a year and can't justify spending $100 on a net. Let me know what you all think. Thanks
