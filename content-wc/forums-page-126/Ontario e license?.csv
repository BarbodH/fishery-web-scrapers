6321926,BreezyPoint,2019-05-16 08:39:00,1581,You must have both with you...page 6 states this (page numbers is on the bottom left corner of each page of the document):https://files.ontario.ca/on-con-188/...summary-v2.pdfFrank
6321938,Knutson21,2019-05-16 09:02:00,348,"I opened the link and went to page 6 like you mentioned. You do not need to carry both. The last sentence in the paragraph I copied and pasted states ""The Box Printed on the back of your Outdoors Card indicating a 3 or 1 year fishing licence is also Valid"" I read it effective this year your outdoor card is all you need, as long as it has the Licence indicated on it. If purchased after November 25, 2018: ¬ï Licence Summary: A document that lists all valid fishing and hunting licences. The Licence Summary can be either a printed copy or saved as a digital format. The box printed on the back of your Outdoors Card indicating a 3- or 1-year fishing licence is also valid."
6321946,BreezyPoint,2019-05-16 09:58:00,1581,"Yes, you are correct... I meant to say you must have your outdoors card at all times and a printed copy of your license unless it is printed on the back of your outdoors card. You always need the outdoors card.Frank"
6322136,pjshorthorn,2019-05-16 19:55:00,5654,"Yup, I'm the cheap prick in the crowd. You'll find out soon enough when I'm sitting in the fish cleaning house drinking all your beer. ü§£üòùü§£ PjShorthorn"
6322430,v-bay gord,2019-05-17 15:33:00,3168,As long as we can drink Breezy Point under the table......
6322444,BreezyPoint,2019-05-17 17:29:00,1581,I surrender ... I just go sit under the table right away.Frank
6322496,pjshorthorn,2019-05-17 22:25:00,5654,"Be careful what you are suggesting. If I remember correctly, the last picture Breezy took of you ended up looking like this as an amazing advertisement.........and you were sober at the time. No telling what would happen if you went on a bender. PjShorthorn"
6321124,pjshorthorn,2019-05-13 19:31:00,5654,"Wait, what ?????? A 1934 model still has to pay for a license ???? How disrespectful can the Canadian govt. be ? PjShorthorn"

6321576,Rondogpike,2019-05-15 07:07:00,24,Went through the process. I have Chrome on my computer. Verified all info was correct and this is the message (in red): We were unable to complete your purchase for the following reason(s): We cannot complete your transaction. Please try again later.
6321674,kona77,2019-05-15 11:54:00,236,I usually order 1-2 days before we leave but when I saw this thread I thought I should just get it done today.. Agree that it is not the best overall design but I was able to get my license completed and printed.. The only issue I had was completing the check-out and getting to the receipt page.. I had good credit card data and I checked the privacy box but the site returned back to the Home page after my first two attempts.. Still not sure what I was doing wrong or maybe there was some other issue?? Main thing is I have my license. (Outdoor card is good thru 2020).
6321840,pjshorthorn,2019-05-16 05:26:00,5654,"Received my new outdoors card yesterday with my annual license printed on the back. It pizzes me off that you no longer receive a copy online that can be printed and signed with a date. I have every Canadian fishing license since the mid 1980's all signed and dated with them all framed in two large picture frames. Now you get a stinkin summary receipt....geeeezzzzzzzz So now, my outdoors card is new and good for three years and I have a one year fishing license printed on the back. What happens when I buy a new license next year? Are they going to issue a new copy of the outdoors card with a copy of my 2020 license printed on the back? I doubt it....PjShorthorn"
6321842,Overwatchmike,2019-05-16 05:40:00,201,"To answer that question.... NO, you will not receive a new Outdoors card next year when you buy another license. This is why I said in a previous post on this thread that your outdoors card is not your license and you are to carry both the outdoors card and your summary receipt with you at all times while you are out fishing. My outdoors card was purchased in 2017 and will expire at the end of this year. On the back it states that I have a fishing license for the year of 2017 and only 2017.

6321852,Rondogpike,2019-05-16 06:10:00,24,Tried 10X to complete this transaction yesterday. Late in the day it all worked (who knows why). I printed my license (as stated no signature this year). My new Outdoors card will arrive via snail mail.
6321858,v-bay gord,2019-05-16 06:26:00,3168,"Well, if you weren't so cheap and had bought the 3 year fishing license you wouldn't have this issue."
6321902,Jwendt15,2019-05-16 08:19:00,72,"Can anyone confirm the ruling requiring your license AND your outdoors card to be on hand at all times when fishing? I have seen conflicting reports on the outdoors card requirement. I have licenses purchased for everyone, but a handful of the guys can't locate their outdoors card. I just had their login info so was able to buy the license online without it. The cards have not yet expired and we'll have printed licenses on hand. Could we run into issues for those that don't have an outdoors card on hand as well while fishing?"
6321918,Overwatchmike,2019-05-16 08:32:00,201,"I was stopped 3 years ago and was asked for both which I had.... The lady and guy both told me that you were required to carry both on your person.....

6320734,TitanD,2019-05-12 19:19:00,43,Thanks for info on Browser. Never had an issue with browser at work in the past. You would think it would be compatible but maybe not. Will give it a go with my Chrome browser at home. I created an account and already have an Ontario Outdoor Card so maybe that will be the ticket!!Thanks
6320794,spw2350,2019-05-13 05:01:00,26,Mine states on it that I also have a valid fishing license
6320872,Shellback,2019-05-13 08:07:00,8083,"When purchasing or renewing your outdoor card, you have the option of buying a license at the same time. If you choose to do so, the license with be stated on the card."
6320894,BreezyPoint,2019-05-13 08:50:00,1581,I think the license is only printed on the card if you buy a three year license. This can be a good deal if you go every year.Frank
6320920,Golden Eagle,2019-05-13 09:51:00,2642,I bought a new card last season. Card is good for 3 years. License is on back for the 1 year I paid for. 3 year license purchase might be a stretch for this 1934 model.
6320936,fishin10,2019-05-13 10:06:00,2315,"Ha!..when we had lunch week before last, I would bet that you would be good for at least 3 years!"
6321100,Guest,2019-05-13 18:04:00,0,Well not entirely true. My 3 year outdoor card has my 3 year fishing license printed on it.
6321106,Overwatchmike,2019-05-13 18:14:00,201,Okay. My outdoors card is 2 and a half years old so my license does not show on my outdoors card.Just for everyone's clarification.... You HAVE to carry the paper print out copy of your license or the file saved on your cell phone. You cannot just carry your outdoors card with you and expect it to pass as your fishing license.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6321108,CI_Guy,2019-05-13 18:22:00,2118,I've been checked twice with my 3 year outdoors card that was bought at the same time as my 3 year license with no paper copy of my license and have had no problems with the CO's.
6319264,Shellback,2019-05-08 09:09:00,8083,"When I bought my previous licenses, you would print out a license to sign. This year a "" license summary"" printed out, with no place to sign. Is the summary considered your license? Been on hold 20 miutes or more waiting for an answer from Ontario"
6319266,Overwatchmike,2019-05-08 09:10:00,201,Yep. That's your license Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

Only time I ever received an error was when the information I was inputting was incorrect. As long as I had the right info from everyone, each license went through without issue. Sure beats waiting in line at the bait shop across the border!"
6320192,Mrpike59,2019-05-10 12:43:00,11,What does the error say? I did for a couple of friend with no Issues
6320230,coldtuna,2019-05-10 15:07:00,25,"I spent a few hours trying to buy a license earlier this week. I sat on hold for the 800 line for 45 minutes but finally got through. They told me the problem might be my browser. I use Safari, but my apple computer is a few years old. I went to my newer apple notebook with a newer version of Safari and bought my license in about 5 minutes -- different browser seemed to solve the problem. They suggested Chrome but I don't have that. One thing you have to do is make sure you set up a new account on the new Ontario website. Here is the message I got via email about this process (which I followed and it worked) before I used the newer version of Safari to buy my license. I hope this helps. *** Thank you for your email.
