6320402,1100 Remington Man,2019-05-11 09:42:00,73,"I have fished there several times at Minor Bay Lodge and It is the home of the Monster Pike. I liked the Cabins and the Dinners were great. I even caught a 44 inch Northern Pike off the dock waiting for the guide in the morning as the boats go out at 8am and return at 5pm or shortly after. For what it is worth Boats from Wollaston Lodge would be seen down around Minor Bay fishing and that is a much farther boat ride. It had the most consistent Northern Pike Fishing that I have seen in Canada with a lot of them over 40 inches. The group I was with was 8 Men and we had a pool every night who would catch the biggest of the Day and my 47 inch Pike did not win as some one had a larger one. I fished with a ST Croix Bass Legend Rod MH 6'9Â” with Shimano Curado spooled with 17lbs Berkley XL line and 9inch 30 lbs. leader is the rod I used the most. I never have broke off on a fish and I check my line after every fish and feel for nicks and retie if needed. I like mono for the stretch at the boat when the fish surges. Northern Pike are not Muskies and large baits are not required or as successful as smaller baits from what I have seen there and yes I saw some Customers throwing big Bulldogs. While I tried several types of baits and styles and colors a Mepp's #5 single blade or the double blade is the winner there. Color choice Blade-Dressing all in Mepp's #5 1. Red & White with silver back or Brass if you can't find silver - White 2. Silver Blade - White 3. Firetiger - Firetiger 3. Black Yellow Dots - Grey Yellow. Called Black Fury 4. Brass blade - Yellow My theory on Pike colors to use as Pike strike from below up at Whitefish and Suckers have white belly and when they turn you see there red gills, Walleyes have a yellow belly. These colors have worked for me for the past 40 plus years. Have a Great trip and take a small bag for your rain gear as you will use it often, before you go sharpen your hooks and pinch the barbs down it will save you time to be fishing instead."
