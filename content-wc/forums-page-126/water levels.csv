I realize the ice is beginning to come out of some of our northern lakes and when it does its always along the shorelines 1st. Im wondering abt the Nakina area particularly Abamasagi, osullivans, Meta, etc and the water levels. Im guessing with high snow amounts and all the rain that the levels must be high? Any info if anyone can tell yet? Thanks"

My outfitter called me for another reason today regarding our pre-order fly in but said he had to cancel the two groups he had going in this coming weekend due to ice at the Nakina Air Base located on Cordingly lake. We don't fly until 6/15 so we will be fine but for others heading that way this week may want to check with outfitters flying out of that area this weekend. Good luck.
