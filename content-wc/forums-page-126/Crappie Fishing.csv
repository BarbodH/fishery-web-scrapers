6319358,billy weaver,2019-05-08 13:15:00,470,A year or so ago a Cedar Lake regular was complaining about the crappie taking over. A place a crappie fisherman might want to go.
6319420,prov1800,2019-05-08 15:55:00,5010,"Might of been me.cedar has good crappies as does wabigoon and dinorwic and a bunch of smaller lakes.very Easy to catch when there spawning but shortly after that you have to go looking for them.getting some 15""specimens which from what my guests have said that seems to be a good fish.spawning time on cedar has become very busy.theres hardly anybody walleye fishing which is fine with me.amazing."
6319426,billy weaver,2019-05-08 16:16:00,470,"Where I live a 15"" crappie is like a 26""plus walleye. A 15"" crappie is worth a picture around here. Lots of 12"" to 13"" inch fish with 14"" being the big fish barrier. I would guess that a guest with a bunch of 14' to 15"" would be coming back for a second visit."

6321066,prov1800,2019-05-13 17:15:00,5010,Can be tough.big lake and they can hide pretty good.takes some searching.
