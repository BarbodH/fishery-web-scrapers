6321546,RichA$1970,2019-05-15 05:49:00,1159,I’m also looking on a solo trip late September
6321554,MrSimon,2019-05-15 06:17:00,922,"Are you looking to fly out of Wawa, or stay at a drive-to camp in the area?"
6321574,TitanD,2019-05-15 07:06:00,43,"Late May/Early June would be my preference as Pike are generally in the shallows and a bit more accessible! Walleyes are also shallow and usually easy to catch. I have been up in September before and fishing was much tougher for us. Still caught fish but just not as good for us. Cold front hung over us the entire week which mo doubt impacted that. Can’t really go wrong with any trip, any time to the North!!! Have been going for over 25 years.We usually go to Red Lake/Ear Falls area and fly in. Have also driven in several times. We are flying from Nakina next month and can hardly stand the wait!!!Good Luck"
6321614,Lamp40,2019-05-15 09:35:00,30,"We are looking for a drive in, I’ve been looking at Windermere lake, Prairie Bee lake, Dog lake for starters. Taking my wife and son and his wife. Not concerned about keeping fish, we would just like to catch some numbers. Weather is a consideration also."
6321628,Lamp40,2019-05-15 10:03:00,30,"Weather is not a huge factor, just don’t think the wife would like 50 and raining all week. lol"
6321670,MrSimon,2019-05-15 11:15:00,922,"Windermere and Prairie Bee are great options. If you are a decent structure fisherman you can catch good numbers of medium sized walleye and tons of smallmouth bass. Pike are there, but harder to find. You have a legit shot at a trophy in either lake. I've been to both and have nothing but good things to say. For an easy drive-to lodge, they are top notch. Dog Lake does not have the best reputation, but I haven't personally been there."
6321680,Lamp40,2019-05-15 12:02:00,30,"I appreciate the input, I haven’t been fishing in Canada in 30 years, really looking forward to getting back. Any ideas for decent pike lakes in the vicinity?"
