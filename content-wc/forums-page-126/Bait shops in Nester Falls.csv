My searches only bring up Nester Falls Bait n Tackle. It was right on the Hiway 71 and it was next to a grocery store and a small bakery. Does any know if its still in business? I am trying to find a place that will sell minnows in bulk, we usually get around 70 dozen. If anybody has some insight I'd be grateful. 2 weeks and we will be on the road for first return to Canada in 4 years."
