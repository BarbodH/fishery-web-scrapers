6319866,Habitual Eyer,2019-05-09 14:58:00,144,Anyone ever stay at Sleepy Bear Cabins on Lac Seul? Looks like 3 cabins right next to Mahkwa Lodge. Just wondered if anyone had any info about these cabins.
6320110,Pooch,2019-05-10 08:10:00,4618,"Are you talking about the cabins just east of the Mahkwa camp? Each cabin has it's own dock? I had assumed they were private cabins, maybe not?Pooch"
6320122,Habitual Eyer,2019-05-10 08:48:00,144,"They are the three cabins East of Mahkwa. There's a website to rent them under ""Sleepy Bear Cabins"". Just wondered if anyone had stayed there...what you would do for gas/bait, and any other info. Great area to fish in the second half of the summer but Mahkwa wont rent for just two people (or even three). Cabin minimums are 4 and you pay that rate whether you have two or three."
6320138,Pooch,2019-05-10 09:53:00,4618,"""Cabin minimums are 4 and you pay that rate whether you have two or three.""My wife and I have ran into that at many camps in Canada.Especially at drive in camps where they are heavily booked most all summer. Most camps have a minimum cabin rate.We are making two trips to Mahkwa this summer, but have four and six guys each trip. We have booked a larger cabin for the six man trip just for more elbow room. Cost difference was minimal for six guys in a nine man cabin. Our group felt it was worth it.Good luck.Pooch"
6320210,Slim03,2019-05-10 13:36:00,159,I exchanged some emails with Sleep Bear Cabins. They told me that you would launch at Mahkwa Camp and then use them for bait and fuel as well. I like the location but everything seemed a little odd to me.
6320316,Habitual Eyer,2019-05-10 20:50:00,144,"I got some e-mails also and there was an oddness to it all. Stayed at Mahkwa a few years ago and it looked like many where using ramp (some not from the camp ??). I guess if one called Mahkwa and they confirmed they would sell gas/bait, then the cabins might be worth a try."
6320370,Pooch,2019-05-11 06:29:00,4618,"I think Mahkwa's service center is open to all that need fuel or bait. Pay in cash. I don't think the launch is open to ""outsiders"", but might also be used by Sleepy Bear.Call Mahkwa and ask to know for sure. I can't imagine Sleepy Bear would steer you wrong.Pooch"
