1969737,VMS,2013-07-21 21:52:00,1103,"Hi Everyone, Our group first went to bell island outpost last year and we had a great time!! Met both Aggie and Randy at the camp when we arrived (both this year and last). They do a fabulous job of making sure you have everything you need to make your stay as good as possible. The cabins are clean and well maintained, a hot tub if you so desire to use it, fish cleaning station outside of the big cabin, and great docking facilities. Dishes, pots and pans are all there for you as well. If you find Poplar island, go north into the little channel to sabaskosing bay. The first island (has a small U-shape to it) as you work up the channel around MacPherson island is where the outpost is located. Roughly 25 miles from Morson, and 30 miles from Kenora. Just got back Yesterday from there and had another great trip and cannot wait to get back there again in another 51 weeks. Steve Vaerst Hastings, MN"

1774505,pikeandtina,2013-05-14 15:31:00,145,"AK, How many does the outpost sleep? Thanks in advance, John"
1776481,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-15 08:11:00,39,Here are the coordinates for the place. We sleep10-12 comfortably over 2 cabins. N 49.19.832 w94.38.891. A.k.
1777233,DD73,2013-05-15 12:31:00,131,"Does the attached image look correct? That's what Google Maps has at that address. Just wanted to make sure I understand where it is, I thought it was further NW."
1777337,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-15 13:30:00,39,"No that doesn't look right to me. We are farther northwest. Right in saboshkoshing bay . Just past the opening. Not the old McPherson camp, but across the bay from it. I will ask randy for the GPS again, but that's what was given to me. I'll get back to you tomorrow."
1777449,rwl,2013-05-15 14:29:00,1655,"49* 19'52.61 N X 94* 38' 52.11 W Right off my GPS I think this is the right one, they are just waypoint numbers on my GPS but I think this is right."
1777577,DD73,2013-05-15 14:55:00,131,"Thanks - I think I was guessing you were located halfway between Spruce Island Camp and Poplar Island, but that was just a guess."
1777801,Ia Walihntr,2013-05-15 16:15:00,320,"DD73 Spruce Island Camp and Bell Island Outpost are only about a mile apart. Go straight south from Spruce to a small opening in the shoreline. When water is higher, you can get through to the bay that is the south entrance to Boggy Bay and where McPherson Island Camp used to be. The outpost is across the small bay from the old McPherson Camp, to the northeastern shore, maybe a hundred yards."
1780105,rwl,2013-05-16 10:58:00,1655,"The cut through is actually from what I know as Garbage Bay (behind girl scout islands, or south of twin islands) to the small bay on the backside of Bell Island, Boggy Bay is a ways to the east and from Spruce you go through treaty narrows and can enter from one of two ways. It's been pretty hairy cutting through there, I did it two years ago in a 17' Lund, wouldn't try it last year with bigger boat. Some of the names are what we call them, or others told us they were and it stuck, but poplar boggy spruce etc. are all on the maps. Bell is about 2 miles by the crow, or 5 miles from spruce either around the west or east side of the McPhearson island. Poplar is 49.28859 94.692106 boggy bay 49.338015 94.579411 cut 49.3420601 94.656937 Don't ask me why my gps notebook is in my desk drawer, but these are all spots marked in 20+ some years of going up there. Usually twice a year, yep I love it there."
1781665,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-16 22:58:00,39,The lake of the woods is open and almost all free of ice. Just a few back bays.
1804402,homerdog,2013-05-24 13:20:00,1,I will be staying at B I O for the first time this late July. I would really like to catch a muskie and a big northern and appreciate any info. I am super excited to join Barry and his group this year as they go each year. This will be my second trip into Canada as i went to Woman Lake in 2007. Can't wait. Mike
1770513,Guk,2013-05-13 09:46:00,39,"has anyone stayed at Bell Island Outpost or fished the area? Thinking of going there in 2014, we have always been north near Shore Island on a houseboat...Looks to be close to McPhearson Island also. Any information on the area would be great! Thanks"
1772849,Ia Walihntr,2013-05-14 06:36:00,320,"Guk, You have a PM Marv"
1773457,rwl,2013-05-14 08:59:00,1655,and another.
1773497,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-14 09:08:00,39,Has anyone stayed with us that could comment on the area and our place? Anyone ever been in the area and met us at the camp or had a tour around the place? Thanks A k
1773545,rwl,2013-05-14 09:32:00,1655,"AK, I would love to check it out, I stay nearby twice a year. As for the area, it is my slice of heaven on earth, I musky fish, but catch walleye at will for meals. It is usually never hard to get a few for dinner, 5-10 minutes and your done. I had a tough time last year in July, 4-5 days of 90's and no wind, so I didn't get a walleye dinnner one night. I cast the shorelines in front of Bell Island, and the place looks great, I would love to have the pricing and info for July and Last week of October. Wouldn't mind going on a ride on the plane that sits there once in a while either! The area is awesome. Always a place to fish regardless of wind. Lots of protected bays, lots of water. We boat in from Morson and Angle Inlet (no more, the road was so bad). It's a 25 mile ride from Morson. Like I said I mostly Musky fish and they are there along with nice pike, my PB pike 45"", ski 50"" actually just down the shore from Bell Island."
1773729,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-14 10:25:00,39,"Please come visit sometime. We are there usually every sat morning getting things ready for the next arrivals. If our Lund with the grey top or the plane is there, so would randy and I. We love the area for the tranquility.....and the fishing. We will keep an eye out for you."
1773937,Ia Walihntr,2013-05-14 11:47:00,320,"Aggie, What Rwl said!!! Musky fishing is great. Walleye fishing is great. Northern fishing is great. Largemouth and Smallmouth fishing is great. Also plenty of Crappies. Obviously fishing for all species is very good just as it is anywhere on LOTW. There are some great areas to fish from your location. Tug Channel, Rice Bay, Johnson Passage, French Portage, Sabaskosing Bay, Boggy Bay, Gull Bay, Deepwater Bay, Plus all the islands and reefs in Little Traverse Bay. Here is Bell Island's website. http://www.bellislandoutpost.ca/"
1774097,aggie kolisnik,2013-05-14 12:52:00,39,Thanks .we hope to see folks if they are in the area and we are there. This weekend we plan to try and get there for cleanup and opening. Randy will try a fly around on Thursday to see how the lake has opened up. See you on the water!
1774281,rwl,2013-05-14 13:48:00,1655,"Cool, let us know how conditions are up there. I've been watching oak island cam."
1774473,DD73,2013-05-14 14:54:00,131,Anyone have GPS coordinates for the outpost? Trying to place it on a map and I guessed.
