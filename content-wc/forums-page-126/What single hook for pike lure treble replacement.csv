6320702,1100 Remington Man,2019-05-12 18:17:00,73,Some thing I have done to my Daredevil red and white ones is buy a large saltwater fly tied with white feather dressing with a single hook. Just have some scissors to trim a little off till the action is correct.
6320706,RichA$1970,2019-05-12 18:32:00,1159,Great reads but does it really matter on a treble or single? If you do swap on a single which way do you point it- painted surface or metal surface side?
6264434,Esoxmike,2018-11-30 09:07:00,114,"I'm definitely all for trebles,I always use jaw spreaders and the pike are back in before they know what happened.but I'm going to a camp that requires single hooks so I gotta convert enough to get through a week long pike rodeo hopefully!much appreciation for all the recommendations from u fellas"
6264436,BreezyPoint,2018-11-30 09:14:00,1581,I have never paid any attention to which way the hook is positioned. I am guessing I have a mix and it doesn't make any difference.Frank
6264440,BreezyPoint,2018-11-30 09:21:00,1581,"A couple of comments...First, I tried putting on grubs and it did seem to reduce the wobble of the lures. This included doctor spoons, but maybe not as much as other spoons, as you suggested. I do put grubs on all of my bucktails, which also have even bigger single siwash hooks.As to hooking percentage, my experience is the single siwash hooks have a better hooking percentage, especially for bigger fish and muskies. I rarely miss a fish with these hooks. I use an aggressive hookset. The hooks have to slide in the mouth to set and I think these slide better than trebles.Frank"
6264502,Bill Krejca,2018-11-30 11:08:00,6107,"Re: point up or down - I position the hook point so that it is up(opposite the convex side of the spoon. I have not noticed any difference in hooking, one hook vs 3, except I get less snags(weeds, rocks, wood, etc) with a single hook. Also I use single hooks on most Mepps type spinners, no hooking difference noted. In my mind, after results noted, my opinion is that treble just looks more deadly than single, perhaps a confidence booster for the angler, or differing success rate with a single hook could be a resultant of how the lure is fished (not necessarily wrong, just maybe different) by the individual angler. Bill"
6264526,BornToFish,2018-11-30 12:14:00,1224,"Greetings, Many thanks to you folks that just mentioned using single hooks on Mepps style in-line bucktails. I've used single hooks on spoons for years now, but don't recall ever trying single hooks on bucktails. It's getting to be that time of the year when I start pondering lure-making projects for the long winter nights. I will stop by my local sporting goods store and pick up a package of Gamakatsu Siwash style hooks in 6/0 or 7/0. I will put together a few bucktails with these hooks and give them a try next summer. Thanks for the suggestion! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6264552,bthomas3333,2018-11-30 13:05:00,465,"One other suggestion. As you change out the trebles, take out a stickie pad and write which treble went with which lure and stick it on the treble. I changed out about 20-30 trebles and couldn't figure out which treble went with which lure. I didn't want to guess which treble went with which lure after the fact. I guess I now have a decent box of single hooked lures for the next trip to a single hook location. But, I also had to rebuy a bunch of stuff.I'm with Mike. The hook up percentage falls a lot with a single hook. I am not saying I catch 30% less fish because most fish aggressive to hit it once hit again and again and eventually many did get caught on the single hook.BTW most of the single hook mandatory locations are so fantastic it is worth it to be forced into single hooks! Have a fantastic trip!Brett"
6264594,Mike Borger,2018-11-30 15:14:00,1554,"For sure they lose their wobble, but some like the Doctor Spoon as mentioned aren't as bad.I like running an oversized grub on a siwash when there's weeds, but not thick enough to require a weedless spoon.The bit of added bulk from the grub slows the sink rate a bit when you're fishing on top of deep cabbage.The spoon loses a little bit of action, but gains bulk and color which mostly offsets the negatives.I still run a spoon clean though whenever I can."
6265084,Esoxmike,2018-12-02 08:19:00,114,"thanks man,I'm not too worried about hook up percentage cuz lately my son and my go-to has been ripple shads and Magombo twisters on kalins swimbait jig heads,freaking deadly if fished right!i think between them and the recommended single hooks on the others we should be having an old fashioned beat down on them toothy suckers!"
6320626,emma17,2019-05-12 11:51:00,436,"Hello, I'm reviving this thread as my family will be fishing a single hook, barbless lake in early June and I have a couple questions. First, let me say Happy Mother's Day to all your mothers and a big thank you that they chose life. I'm especially thankful because I do my best to read the posts of all of you on this thread, it's the best way I can learn the sport and fool my kids into thinking I actually know something about fishing. I took a look at the Gamakatsu website and they are promoting their new Barbless Big River Bait hook. I see it's not an ""in-line"" hook. Do you feel an in-line hook would be better? Also, when replacing trebles on a Rapala styled lure with the three trebles, do you leave the front and middle rings empty when putting a single hook at the back or do you put three single hooks on each ring of the lure? I'm not sure if that would be a violation and I also wonder how it effects the action of the lure. Thanks very much."
6320628,adempsey2.0,2019-05-12 11:58:00,611,"Remember, single hook also means one treble. At least, here in Ontario unless the exceptions note otherwise (not even sure there are any exceptions to this rule though). Pinching barbs down is very easy to do on trebles using a pair of pliers with a flat surface."
6264146,Esoxmike,2018-11-29 10:42:00,114,"Just seeing what single hooks u guys are replacing trebles with on your pike lures-spoons,bucktail spinners etc on trophy lakes that require them.what brand,size and style?open eye or adding splitting when required?"
6264154,BreezyPoint,2018-11-29 11:01:00,1581,I have done this with almost all of my pike spoons. I use a single siwash 5/0 hook and bend down the barbs as well. Makes it extremely easy to release fish and I have had great success. My hook up rate is as good or better than the trebles they replaced.Frank
6264162,bthomas3333,2018-11-29 12:10:00,465,The 5/0 Siwash is what I use too. I like the Gimakaksu brand. You have to close the loop after you slide it on the ring but I prefer that to using pliers to remove the treble and again to add the single hook.This year I changed out a bunch of stuff. I liked the 5/0 on spoons and spinners under 1 or 2 oz. I think the bigger spoons aka Husky Junior+ and larger muskie sized spinners might be better with a 6/0-8/0.Brett
6264170,BreezyPoint,2018-11-29 12:33:00,1581,I actually buy the hooks with fully closed rings and use split rings to attach them.Frank
6264178,bthomas3333,2018-11-29 12:55:00,465,"Hey Frank - I use the delivered ring too, but I struggle with the detail work of opening the split ring with the special pliers. I'd rather just open the ring once to remove the treble and then slide the hook on and use brute force to close the hook. I can see your point that it is possible I don't get the loop on the hook all the way closed:-)Toma'to To'mato...When are we going to chase some pike!Brett"
6264188,Bill Krejca,2018-11-29 13:48:00,6107,"Many times I just slide the single hook onto the split rind gap created as I am moving the old one off. Call me lazy, I guess. Bill"
6264194,bthomas3333,2018-11-29 14:01:00,465,I was doing double switch out of both hooks originally and then I looked at the ring afterwards and it looked pretty bent up. Probably just me.B-
6264206,Golden Eagle,2018-11-29 15:03:00,2642,And you're hooking much less cabbage with your single hook. Do you have hook point up or down in relation to the pretty side of your spoon?
6264212,Mike Borger,2018-11-29 15:47:00,1554,"Have used 6/0 and 7/0 open eye Owner siwash hooks on some of my pike spoons. There are certain instances where it's an advantage. Mainly when fishing in heavy vegetation, or when I want to tip the spoon with an oversized grub.But for me at least the hooking percentage isn't even close to a treble. When I use a barbless siwash I lose even more fish.I use trebles 80% of the time."
6264390,BornToFish,2018-11-30 06:32:00,1224,"Greetings, Mike: your post on this thread is interesting to me. My experience with single versus treble hooks on spoons is pretty much the same as what you report. I have a few of my spoons switched over to single hooks (Gamakatsu Siwash in size 5/0 or 6/0) for use when I suspect the fish are in the slop. Even then, I often still use a treble hook as I can adjust the speed of my retrieve to stay above the weeds or just rip the lure through the weeds to free the hooks. I find that it's almost always no more difficult to remove a treble hook from a fish than it is to remove a single hook. For me, the choice of treble hook versus single hook on a spoon is splitting hairs. I normally go with the treble hook for better hooking percentage. I sometimes add a rubber twister-tail type body to my spoons. I noticed when doing this that some spoons (e.g. Doctor spoons) generally retain their wobble/action with a rubber body on the hook. In contrast, it seems as though most spoons lose their wobble when a rubber body is attached to either the treble or single hook. Have you noticed the same phenomenon? Good fishing and tight lines!!"
