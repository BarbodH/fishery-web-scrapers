6321096,pikeandtina,2019-05-13 17:59:00,145,"KevinSB, Agree w/Billy Weaver...we had a guy w/his 15 or 16 year old kid who jumped out and couldn't handle the water surge...could have ended badly w/ a damaged boat or person. I gunned our boat to the shore and the guy w/me jumped out and helped wrangle the boat to the rollers. Big weedbed right as you go into wine. We would run right up to it and then drift out away from it fishing it the whole way. Caught so many pike and walleye that way that my boat partner and I never fished anywhere else on the lake, lol! Drift way out, weed bed runs out pretty deep and we caught a couple of heavy mid-to-high 30"" pike doing that along w/a large walleye. Good luck, great area to fish...both lakes. Cheers, John"
6321136,jsmyers,2019-05-13 20:45:00,198,"I understand why Nick is making the change. I went to Wine Lake camp near the end of his inaugural season and had a blast. (I probably owe some of you a proper trip report--work got crazy right after I got back and next thing you know it is a year + later. Here are some videos my cousin took on the trip: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis...u1cIo813PCaGBl) I'm hoping to get back next year.Making that portage was never too tough, but always a tiny bit stressful. I remember doing it as a kid a number of times. I realize that one of the differences between ca. 1990 and now is that we used to have to haul a bunch of extra gas if we were making the portage. I imagine the old 2-strokes weren't as economic as the current batch of 4s.This year I'll be at Sleepy Dog (6 weeks!) for a few more creature comforts with my wife and kids. I hope to be able to make a trip up there to explore and maybe stop in a say Hi to Nick. I'll have to ask Tom if that is still possible, especially with his larger boats.That weedbed at the outfall of Wine can be a great spot!"

Chill out Billy, I never said Wine Lake was private and I have already exhausted this issue a few years ago. I was just commenting on the current situation. The fact is that Wine as a portage for the Wabby camps may become more difficult. The Saturday motoring is simply going through Wabby to get to Wine, not to anchor on top of people fishing, which has actually happened to me by a red boat. But hey, there is great fishing all over the system and I am familiar with many great spots so if you manage the portage we will say hi as you motor by and wish you luck. If you anchor next to me I just might grumble, but I will move on. Best wishes for a great year! Fish On! Hooks"
6321204,KevinSB,2019-05-14 06:24:00,73,Thanks again to all for the helpful replies. We love Wabby and have had great luck there over the years. We'll spend most of our time there but I thought it would be lots of fun to slip into Wine for a day for something different. Thanks again to my WC family! Kevin
6321790,ILScott,2019-05-15 19:12:00,139,"Kevin, I will be going into Wine on June 1 and staying and Kingfisher the night before. That will be a long day if you go down to Wine. The thing is the portage down can be tricky if you have never done it. What size of motor on the boat? if it is to big it will be a lot of back weight when pulling up. Unless you are like the old owner and the water was high enough he would run all the boats up the portage. Pretty impressive to see."
6321806,billy weaver,2019-05-15 20:03:00,470,We have ran the portage coming back never tried it going down. When the water is on the high side it is not to bad if you know where the cut is. It runs from the east shore diagonally to the west. You have to start out almost against the east bank. I was always afraid of hitting the bank going down. We stopped doing it when the camp operator told us not to it. The owner of the Wine Lake Camp showed us how. (Years ago)
6321978,KevinSB,2019-05-16 12:06:00,73,"Thanks, ILScott and Billy. We have an upgraded camp boat, which is great for most purposes but not for portage. It's a 17' boat with a 40HP motor. Does anybody have a sense as to current water levels on Wabaskang and Wine? And no doubt it would be a long run but if possible would be fun to do for a day. We go from Tall Pines all over the lake, including way down to Keynote. Don't mind a long run one day for a chance to try something new. I suspect we'll try the portage early in the week to see if it will work. We certainly have plenty of normal spots and techniques to find fish. Again, I was just trying to think of something new to try one day. Thanks for the continued input! Kevin"
6322030,billy weaver,2019-05-16 15:03:00,470,"I wouldn't attempt to portage 17' boat with a 40hp. I use a 17' boat with a 60hp on Wabaskang but the camp operator lets use a 14' boat with a 15 hp. for the portage. As a group 3 boats and 6 guys, we do portage a 16ft. boat with a 20 hp. The 16' is a Alumacraft with a flat floor. Its heavy and about all the group can handle (5 guys). I don't think you should try with 17' boat with a 40hp. Bringing the boat back would be just too much."
6320994,KevinSB,2019-05-13 11:59:00,73,"Would somebody be willing to explain whether it's possible to reach Wine Lake from from Wabaskang and, if yes, how? We've been to Wabby a number of times but never to Wine. I think I understand it may be reachable via Williams/Hobson Falls in the NW part of the Wabby lake system but am unsure. We stay at Tall Pines Camp and will be up starting June 1 (and glad to say hi to any other WCs up there that week). Thanks in advance for any help! Kevin"
6321002,bearfvr13,2019-05-13 12:24:00,174,"I believe that you can, this is where guests meet in the morning to be taken in to Wine Lake. And it passes your camp. But I do believe that you have to drag your boat across the portage (approximately 50ft?) Hope this helped. Chuck"
6321004,bearfvr13,2019-05-13 12:27:00,174,"Sorry, picture is very crappy, but the Wine Lake guests meet south of Tall Pines, then they are picked up by boat to go to Wine Lake. Chuck"
6321006,KevinSB,2019-05-13 12:44:00,73,"Thanks for the quick reply, Chuck. We use 17"" camp boat and are reasonably strong guys. Wonder if we can get it across? Thanks again! Kevin"

6321032,billy weaver,2019-05-13 14:00:00,470,"It's a easy portage for 3 or more guys, it would take 2 really stout guys to make it alone. We usually team up and have two boats with 4 or 5 guys. It's worth the effort."
6321072,HeHooksHimself,2019-05-13 17:23:00,725,"I am a Wine Lake Camp veteran and have accomplished this portage many times. The video was taken when the water was rather high. It is much more difficult when the water is lower. This year, for the first time, we that stay at Wine Lake Camp will be taken to the portage by a larger boat. Our camp boats will be in the Cedar River and we will not be taking our boats over the ramps. Therefore, I am not sure but it is entirely possible that the ramps, which I am quite sure have been placed and maintained by Wine Lake Camp, may not remain at the falls. Great for us so we that enjoy WLC will have the system to ourselves and the weekly invasion from the multiple camps on Wabby may be reduced, but not so great for the patrons of the Wabby camps that are looking for different water. Either way, I will be up there this weekend! Best wishes for a great trip! Fish On! Hooks PS check this video from 2012 to get a taste of Wine Lake Camphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY9EtnpYNIo"
6321084,bearfvr13,2019-05-13 17:36:00,174,"I tried to watch it, I'm just not a fan of the music video. Not knocking it, just prefer actual videos. Glad you mentioned that the water was high in that other video, cuz I've seen pictures of it being low and it looked much harder to get boats across!! Hope you have a great trip at WLC. (Hooks) Chuck"
6321090,billy weaver,2019-05-13 17:49:00,470,I don't know the arrangement for maintenance of the ramps but I do know that Peffley worked on building a extension to the ramp last year (2018) because of the low water and installed it.
