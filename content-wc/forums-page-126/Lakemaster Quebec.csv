I was super excited because the first body of water they mention was the ""Gouin Reservior."" Either Humminbird uses an algorithm that knows what I look at online, or they view the Gouin as a hot spot in Quebec. None the less, I did a little more digging just because I don't trust marketing, and low and behold its mapped, but in Standard Definition(5 ft) intervals, not the High Def (1' intervals). Now why ""highlight"" a body of water in a marketing campaign if it does not have the best feature available. I am glad I have a ZLC and ACLive so that I can make my own maps. Maybe when V2 comes out I will buy the Lakemaster chip..."
