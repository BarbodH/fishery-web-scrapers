6320372,Eagle1,2019-05-11 06:43:00,28,"I’ve been to Atikwa 4 times in the past, though it’s been ten years since I’ve been there. Walleyes were very hard to find in the main lake, but can be found in the portage lakes. We did well on northern and lakers, especially early in the season when lakers are near the surface."
6320518,LoDo,2019-05-11 21:31:00,721,"I was told today private outpost owners on Atikwa are not allowed to leave a portage boat in the portage lakes? I'd love some more info on this. Seems odd Atikwa Lodge is the only camp/outpost allowed to leave a portage boat in / around the portage lakes. In other words, if you a cabin owner on this lake you are not allowed to leave portage boats in/around portage lakes. You'd have to actually portage your main lake boat to the portage lakes in/out daily. Seems odd."
6320536,Skywagon,2019-05-12 05:40:00,1106,"We have an old existing boat cache permit on one of the portage lakes you are refering to, they were not exclusive to Atikwa Lodge.You have always needed to have a boat cache permit to leave a boat unattended on any lake in the area you are asking about. They are no longer issuing any new cache permits, so if you do not have an existing permit you are out of luck. The reason for the permits was to limit easy access to a lake, the number of permits issued for any lake was supposedly based on the fishing pressure that particular lake could tolerate."
6320560,v-bay gord,2019-05-12 06:55:00,3168,Skywagon is likely correct. Not sure if a nonresident who might own a cabin would be eligible for a permit.
6320564,LoDo,2019-05-12 07:12:00,721,"Thanks guys! Certainly unfortunate for the very few owners on this lake that do not have cache permits. You'd think these remote fly-in massive lakes would be a bit more liberal with these permits, but apparently not. If anything, make the portage lakes catch n release or minimize the limits within these lakes. Atikwa isn't much of a walleye lake and the portage lakes apparently hold walleyes camp owners should be allowed a cache permit. Oh well.... Thanks for the clarification!"
6320584,prov1800,2019-05-12 08:16:00,5010,Residents of Ontario are allowed to put boats on any lake for 21 days and also camp on crown land for 21 days.this rule might of changed but think it's still in effect.
6315622,LoDo,2019-04-26 15:00:00,721,"Anyone been to Atikwa to walleye fish? Looking for a new destination this year. The reports for lakers and northern are easy to find. I'd love to hear a report or experience from you'll on the walleye fishing. Best,"
6316258,prov1800,2019-04-29 08:37:00,5010,"Had coffee the other day with a old owner of Atikwa.He said walleyes are tough to find in main lake but there are good portage lakes with walleye.might want to check out clarks Anishinabi Lake Lodge.trout,bass and pike in main lake and a number of portage lakes for fast action walleye and pike and trout.www.clarksresorts.com"
6316436,Obabikon,2019-04-29 21:18:00,2370,"Highly suggest Atikwa. Todd told me at the NW Sportshow that walleye fishing on the main lake has gotten much better the past few years. Lots of variety, and great owners!"
6316540,v-bay gord,2019-04-30 08:00:00,3168,"I've only fished Atikwa a few times in the winter for trout, but it's a beautiful lake with a bunch of portage lakes connected.....I'm sure it would be an adventure. Not sure why folk need to insert adverts for other places when the original post didn't ask for that advice."
6316572,prov1800,2019-04-30 09:15:00,5010,Did say they were looking for something new.Just making a suggestion about something I know.Kinda what this site is about isn't it.
6316952,v-bay gord,2019-05-01 09:15:00,3168,Maybe the site doesn't mention second party advertising https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=169159 but is it good advice when it is?
6317034,Skywagon,2019-05-01 11:34:00,1106,"I have only fished Atikwa in the winter for trout, so cannot add any valueable information for the OP.Gord brings up a good point about free advertising on this site. Walleye Central is a great-well run site and unlike some, it does not ask for contributions from the users, the money comes from advertisers. Most of the camp owners and guides that post in the Canada section do a good job of keeping it informational and do not (blantantly) try to sell their camp or service. In my mind it is one thing for a fisherman to tout the camp that they go to every year and completely another for a camp owner, a camp owner posing as a user (yes that does happen), or someone that derives some of their income from tourism, to advertise in the forum. It is not fair to those paying their way, or users of this site. I am guessing the person in question had not looked at it from that prospective before and may have found some food for thought."
6317068,LoDo,2019-05-01 13:06:00,721,"Thanks for the feedback. For as many ppl that surf this site, its amazing there isnt more experiences on this lake. I know its fly-in and only one lodge, but you'd still think there would be more feedback. The past few days I spoke to ppl living around Nestor that say the portage lakes along the Canal hold walleyes. A few guys said the canal itself has walleyes. Apparently the trout fishing is incredible on this lake and no down riggers are needed. Jig n minnow gets it done. I found this interesting."
6317112,v-bay gord,2019-05-01 14:55:00,3168,Many trout lakes do have walleye but they are usually not large populations. On the other hand they are often large trophy fish when you do find them. Clear trout water also adds to the difficulty in targeting them....but I'm sure it can be done. Long-lining crank baits is a method I would consider. Good luck.
6317544,Canadian fisher,2019-05-03 08:44:00,97,How is the Lake trout size in Atikwa? Really hoping to get in there one winter. This winter I was only 4 miles from it up the Maybrun rd when I had to turn around as the sled was low on fuel. Cheers
