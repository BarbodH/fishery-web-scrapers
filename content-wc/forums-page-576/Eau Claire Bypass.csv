Somewhere on the edge of town we caught the bypass and it cut 15 minutes off. Is there a different exit or a better way to catch the bypass? Thanks for the help."

""Exit 70"" this basically follows its original path until just before Clairemont Ave ""hwy 12"" at that point you begin to skirt the city on the east side. Your time savings of approx 15 mins is consistent unless you tried coming down business 53 thru Eau Claire and Hallie at 4pm on a Friday then you would likely save yourself 30 - 45 mins. Once you exit 94 all you need to do is stay on the bypass and you are good. good luck GF"
