The year I was there, we had absolutely terrible weather, so the fishing probably wasn't up to the standard most would report.A guy I fished with there had been going for many years. He had caught some big walleyes there (over 12#) and did well with all the standard techniques. We caught some nice fish, but nothing spectacular. Biggest pike was around 38"". We also had an afternoon of good lake trout fishing, which was a lot of fun for me since I had never done it before.Back then, the cabins were very rustic, but functional. The only negative experience was at departure when the owner(s) wanted to renegotiate the price we had agreed to months earlier. It left a sour taste in my mouth and is something I'll probably remember for a lifetime. Since I was in college then and wasn't the one handling negotiations, I left it alone, but it was a headache and something I certainly wouldn't want to experience again anywhere. However, it taught me a valuable lesson on negotiating and how to work with lodge owners in the future. Since then, I've not encountered a single issue.Enjoy your trip.Steve"

How'd you fish te lake trout? Leaving Michigan at 11:00 so probably won't receive an answer. Will let you know my experiences. Rick"
