Am I fishing in post spawn or in pre-summer? We usually target Walleye around 8-12 feet either by jigging or trolling. Some years we kill them and others it is a struggle. Last year was really rough with a late ice out and horrible weather. This year looks to be a bit more stable although higher water. My question is if I am in post spawn, do I need to be fishing deeper? Or, if I am in pre-summer, do I continue to fish the 8-12 range? I'm really just looking to prepare a bit so I don't waste too much time on the first few days."

I still catch walleye in less then 8' of water in early june by pitching jigs to wind blown shorelines. Be versatile, if what you're doing isn't working, switch it up... don't beat a dead horse. Trolling is a great way to cover water and search for fish. Pay close attention to your electronics and look for hooks close to bottom. If you find an area that has some fish concentrated on bottom, throw a marker (or waypoint) and jig around it."
