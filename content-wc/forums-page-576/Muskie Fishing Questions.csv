I know they are more commonly caught in late summer, but why do we not catch a few in the spring? We use big spoons for pike. Below are the questions I have about muskies. Where on Lac Seul would be our best bet to catch a few muskie? When is the best time to catch them? If we focus on muskies at the right time of the year then how many per day would the average fisherman catch at Lac Seul? What kind of water should we focus on for muskies, i.e. shallow bays? What are the best baits for muskies? Thanks NEPiker"

[/QUOTE] The average would be a big fat zero on any muskie lake with a trophy status such as L.S, Eagle, Low, etc. That's a fact of life with muskie fishing. Doesn't mean you won't have action....follows, blow-ups, screw-ups........and sometimes you even catch them! How many per day.....it's just not a realistic attitude to start out with. Just my opinion after spending 30 years chasing after them........"

The season doesn't open until the 3rd saturday in June, so there's a start as to when to fish for them. Weeds/stumps/sand bars are a good starting point. Throw top waters and buck/boo in-line spinners in the summer. Troll big (10"" +) plugs in the fall. LIke Gord said, with muskie fishing trophy waters it's not a numbers game. Good luck."
