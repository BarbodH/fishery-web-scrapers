1109208,Gary from Iowa,2009-05-29 16:35:00,74,"The name of the train in or flyin resort that I didn't mention earlier is Allanwater, www.allanwater.com I believe it is in the same general area of Ontario and www.flindtlandingcamp.com If you do a search of resorts allong the Algoma Central Railway, you will find a number of resorts. I saw a listing for www.tatnall.com , about 4.5 hours north of Sault Ste. Marie. This is also either a train in or fly in.Gary"
1109264,Rayburn36,2009-05-29 21:56:00,17,"Try www.tno.on.ca they are one hour from the border in international falls and you can stay at the camp and take ""day trips"" out. Or they have outposts to your liking.have a great stay"
1109270,Guest,2009-05-29 23:32:00,0,Check out Andy Meyers Lodge on Eagle Lake.An easy drive to location with great fishing and lots of options.Take a look at the package plan that includes a one day fly in and a overland wilderness trip to a remote lake.The kids will really enjoy it.Good Luck.
1109352,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-30 10:18:00,138,"I use to do the ""fly-in"" gig every year. I got tired of working all day long to get a limit of fish. My back hurt from fishing in a 16' boat with a 9.9hp. For the last ten years I've been hauling my Lund up to Sioux Lookout. I've taken some of my fly-in buddies and they are amazed. 100 fish a day is possible. We fish Minnitaki, Abrams, Pelican, Big V, and Lac Suel. Monster walleye, pike, smallmouth, muskie and lake trout. For the price of a fly-in trip you can stay at Moosehorn Lodge. Great boats with 50hp 4 strokes, docks are well mantained, nice cabin, wonderful food, and the best guides in the area (IMHO). If you are on a tight budget you can stay at Northumbrian Resort for about $40 a night. Not as plush but has everything you need."
1109423,eyemike,2009-05-30 18:23:00,233,"Check out Sportsman's Lodge north of Red Lake on Little Vermillion Lake. Been there several times and Bret, his wife, and family run a top notch lodge for a fair price. I think it runs about 900.00 for a seven day fly-in. Fishing is spectacular with loads of eyes. The pike in there are just huge with the odds of one over 20 very good. The lake is about 12000 acres, shallow with lots of islands, bays, creeks, and weeds. Everything about this resort is top notch. The website is trophypikecanada.com. Mike"
1109445,Glenman12,2009-05-30 20:14:00,762,Just a suggestion but why dont you go to a drive to lodge and do a one day flyout..I did that with our group along with my son..that would probably keep you within your budget
1109518,NemegosendaRiver,2009-05-31 09:08:00,66,"Not a great reference since we have been going to the same place since 1978 but we fly into Gosenda Lodge (Chutes Outpost) through Air Ivanhoe out of Red Pine Lodge (Foleyet). Richard used to run his own flight service but I think it became more cost effective for him to use Air Ivanhoe.There are a lot of Walleye and unlimited pike. I honestly believe if you tried you could catch 150-200 pike in a day, would be a lot of fun for the boys.Air Ivanhoe has several fly-in outposts as well so you may want to check them out."
1108957,10 Pound,2009-05-28 21:33:00,356,"I really want to take my 12 & 13 year old up on a flyin. I can't spend thousands. Is there such thing for $1000-$1500 range with good fishing not more than 4 hours from the MN border. I know, I'm asking a lot."
1108959,Golden Eagle,2009-05-28 21:44:00,2642,Outfitters are paying $8.50 a mile for a Beaver. Operating costs are pretty hefty.
1108963,Steve of Madison,2009-05-28 21:59:00,230,"Why fly in? There are some wonderful camps that you can drive right up to your cabin, set up housekeeping, have a 17' Lund outfitter with a 50hp engine, electronics, minnows, gas and on the best walleye lake in North America 3 hrs from Int Falls. All for about $750 pp. I know some guys want the fly-in, rough it, all alone on the lake experience. Been there, done that. For my money, and I don't have alot, why should you pay extra for it? I get a kick out of guys that spend way more than I do to fly off of the best walleye water in Ontario, to some remote lake that has less quality fishing, row boats with 15hp smoke belching motors, and cabins that are... Don't misunderstand me, I'm sure there are some wonderful fly-in spots, with great cabins boats and motors. I just haven't found them at the price I pay for what I get."
1108969,Guest,2009-05-28 22:24:00,0,try tang of the north ....sweet place cheap
1109054,IowaDave,2009-05-29 08:27:00,69,Just curious as to which lake you consider to be the best walleye lake in North America. Lac Seul I assume?
1109066,deputy dog,2009-05-29 08:49:00,305,check out mattice lake outfitters www.walleye.ca not sure about the distance though
1109088,Larry Mac,2009-05-29 09:32:00,530,"Hi 10 pound, Great to hear you are taking your 12 and 13 yr old boys up to the great Canadian Wilderness. I have been taking my kids and others north for years. I have two trips planned for this year already. My 13 year old has been North with me 9 times. You will be making memories that will last a lifetime. There are many great threads on this website addressing Canada and children. I am your average Joe so cost is definitely a factor. I do agree with Steve of Madison when he states that there is great fishing destinations without the added expense of flying. Please do not misunderstand me I believe a Fly in outpost is a very unique experience. We have experienced it. Without flying my kids have experienced many 100 fish days, Moose, Bears, Eagles, Wolf, Beavers, Martin, shore lunches, Northerns grabbing walleyes at the boat, remoteness, along catching fish right off the dock. It usually cost under $1,500.00 for the three of us.Where ever you and the kids decide to go have a wonderful trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1109097,Gary from Iowa,2009-05-29 10:09:00,74,"The best boat and accomodations at the most reasonable price is a drive in resort. I have boated in and taken a train to resorts with good fishing results as well as flying in and driving in. The drive in allows you to get off the lake and do something else if the fish arn't biting or if boredom sets in.About 20+ years ago I went to Sonny-Bob resort on Oba Lake via the Algoma Central Railway, starting at Hawk Junction and ending at milepost 210 (I think) a good experience. About 9 years ago my brothers and then 9 year old nephew boated into Cascade Camp next to Devil's Cascade (trip in and out part of the package) on the north end of the northern arm of Rainy Lake Canada. The accomodations were basic-and may not be for ""nice"" -but functional-hot and cold running water, showers, flush toilets.(Bring in grocceries, nightcrawlers, leeches.) The smallmouth bass fishing outstanding. (You need to know if the summer tournament rules restrict use of light bait when you plan to be there)We did most of the fishing off of the dock! Fish on consecutive casts were the order of the day. Daily rates were available. This would sure be cheaper than a flyin.Last year we went to Route Lake Lodge-about 25 miles from Dryden. This was a 2 mile boat in. The fishing was slow on the main lake but some big fish were caught. The fishing on lakes on logging roads was very good for northern pike and smallmouth bass.We are going to try Bow Narrows Lodge on Red Lake this year, about a 20 mile trip.You could take a drive to trip and then tack on a one day flyout. Lots of possibilities.Gary"
1109121,Steve of Madison,2009-05-29 11:09:00,230,"Lac Suel, LOW, Rainey, take your pick. I took a guy that had been on flyins every year, until he went with us to LS. His words ""what in the HE double hockey sticks am I doing that when I catch more, and bigger fish, better accomodations, and don't have to fight the wind and weather in a row boat with no electronics, and pay twice the price. Plus we can make a beer run when supplies get low! No Brainer!"""
1109124,jigman 2003,2009-05-29 11:16:00,981,"While I wouldn't put in MLO in the ""cheap"" category I will attest to quality of fishing, service, and accomodations. Personally, I'd be a little leery of any week long fly in for must under $700 a person (actually I'd be leery of any under $1000 a person, but I imagine there's some out there). I'd agree with some of the others, for a budget conscious angler a boat in or drive in is your best option."
