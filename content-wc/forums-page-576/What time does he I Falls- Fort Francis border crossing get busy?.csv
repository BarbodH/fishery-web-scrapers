1109361,ILScott,2009-05-30 12:01:00,139,"Glenman,We enjoy the trip up 502 and take extra time driving it. We get our license and any last things in Dryden, mainly beer. We then get to our hotel for the night and sit and enjoy ourselves by consuming some canadian beer, checking tackle, playing cards, and talking about old trips. A lot less stressfull. The next morning we have a 40 minute ride."
1109444,rather-be-fishin,2009-05-30 20:13:00,429,Int'l Falls is about a 4 1/2 to 5 hour drive from Mpls/St. Paul.
1109465,JayM5209,2009-05-30 23:11:00,1050,"Last Saturday, 5/23, I crossed thru Intl. Falls/Ft. Francis at 4:00 AM and there was not another vehicle within six blocks of me on either side. A one minute crossing! This morning, 5/30, we crossed southbound at 10:15 AM and had about 7 or 8 vehicles ahead of us on the bridge. Total crossing time was less than 15 minutes.All those travelling 502 between Ft. Francis and Dryden, please drive with care and caution. The road has been improved over the years, but this year we saw two serious accidents northbound and two southbound. Three of them involved fisher men towing large boats. In two cases boat and trailer were totally demolished with major tow vehicle damage. In the third, the boat was a total loss. Stay awake, stay alert, take your time, and give 502 the respect it deserves......and enjoy the fishing despite the cold weather!"

1109148,joeman79,2009-05-29 12:12:00,417,We are going to be going thru Int'l falls probably about 7 p.m. on a saturday or early Sunday morning. what kinda times do you think a person would have to wait on a Sunday morning? Trying to decide where to stop for the night. Wondering whether it would be faster saturday evening or Sunday Morning? I have reservations at LaPlace Rendevzous for sat. now just hope we can drive 15 hours in one day.
1109191,Mark R,2009-05-29 15:14:00,1538,We have stayed at the Rainbow Motel in Ft Francis. It's no Super 8 but it was Ok for spending a short nights stay. It's on the west side of town right on the highway. I think I recall a beer store fairly close by. Good Luck
1109207,Guest,2009-05-29 16:29:00,0,"You won't have any problems other than a Saturday morning on the way up, and a Friday on the way back."
1109215,BB3,2009-05-29 17:29:00,48,I've been in line past the cemetary on Sunday's and Mondays coming out. That usually happens on a holiday weekend tho.
1109246,ILScott,2009-05-29 19:45:00,139,Where are you going fishing at? We always cross on Friday morning and no wait. We go to Vermillion Bay and stay there before we go in on Saturday. But like I asked earlier where are you going and people on this board might be able to help you better.Scott
1109260,Guest,2009-05-29 21:20:00,0,"We are leaving from St. Paul and staying at Rainbow Point on Perrault Lake. Looking forward to it. My son (9) brings his tacke box up every day after school to re-inventory his jig selection. Honestly, I don't care if I get a line wet. I just want the kids to have fun hooking into some Canadian walleye & pike."
1109301,JAY221,2009-05-30 06:50:00,877,The wife & I leave Des Moines about 6:00 on a Friday morning & drive to Dryden & spend the night. We get there when it is still light out & don't have to drive 502 when all the critters are moving about. Then it is a short drive on up to your destination. We have been to Kingfisher right across from where you are going a coupple of times. Have fun. Jay
1109304,Glenman12,2009-05-30 06:59:00,762,"just curious, but if you cross on a Friday morning, what do you do all day in Vermillion Bay? for several years we had been leaving on Friday morning at 6:00AM..we didnt push it and we would get to the border about 5:00/6:00PM..we would cross and spend the night in Fort Frances at either the Red Dog Inn, the Super 8 or the Emo Inn..last year we tried something different..we left at 4:30AM and only stopped for gas and drive thru food..we got to the border at 3:00PM and got across in 10 minutes..we continued on and got to our lodge in Perrault Falls by 6:30PM (we stopped in Vermillion Bay for a sit down dinner)..of course other resort owners would have to allow others to arrive on Friday evening..what this accomplished was getting us out fishing on Sat morning instead of about 1:30-2:00 on Saturday afternoon"
1108950,Guest,2009-05-28 21:20:00,0,We are bringing the kids up to Ontario fishing for the first time in June. Staying in I Falls Friday night. Just wondering what time the I Falls border crossing gets busy on Saturday mornings. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you
1108964,Nimstug,2009-05-28 22:01:00,2605,"Guest,This is not the answer you are looking for but I would suggest you cross the border Friday evening and stay in Fort Frances. No worries about lines, you can get your fishing license if needed. Stuff you forgot can be purchased at the Safeway. Le Rendezvous (sp?) on the east end of F.F. has a good breakfast.It's what I've always done and have never had a problem.From what I've read here, anything after 10:00 am could be an issue. Hope you have a fun and safe trip. The kids will remember it forever.Nimstug"
1108971,Steve of Madison,2009-05-28 22:30:00,230,"Second that!!!!! Cross on Friday night, I stay at the Super 8. Very nice, clean, pool, hot tub, and choose between McD's, Pizza Hut, KFC all within a short walk. Free breakfast in the morning. The line starts to build at 6am and by 10am it can be a mile long or better depending on the weekend. Just can't figure why so many guys just don't cross the night before."
1108986,chevtow,2009-05-29 05:05:00,691,We always stay in Int. Falls ( tradition I guess) and go over sat. morn. usually between 8 and 9am about 10-20 minutes wait. The last couple years have seen shorter lines--maybe economy?
1109026,MNRambler,2009-05-29 07:36:00,5,"Leaving next Friday for my first Canada trip in awhile. Will be leaving the Twin Cities sometime in the afternoon. Assuming normal traffic, how long to I falls? Also are hotels in that area booked on Friday nights? I don't have a reservatio as I don't know how far I'll make it. I've pretty much been counting on a substantial wait at the boarder on Sat a,m."
1109029,Guest,2009-05-29 07:41:00,0,"I've been going to Canada for over 20 years and it's always trip back across the border that gets long. if you are coming back on a Saturday you may as well expect a few hour wait. The line generally moves slow enough that your passengers can get out and walk around and not get left behind. i've had some long and slow lines on the way into Canada as well, but the last several years have gone quite quick. we generally will spend a night in Int Falls, have breakfast the next morning, and go across. i don't think the wait has been much more than 20 minutes or so. And that's on a Saturday."
1109030,Guest,2009-05-29 07:41:00,0,"In all seriousness, if you are staying in I-Falls on Friday night and crossing on Saturday, you need to be in line to cross no later than 5:30 AM or you will have quite a wait. Crossing at 5:00 AM will get you a 10 - 15 minute wait most years. We used to always cross about midnight and then we thought we would break up the trip by staying on Friday night . . . the first year we did that we got up at 7:30, only to drive two miles out of town to get in line (three hour wait) - never did that again. The advice to cross Friday night and stay in Canada is good, otherwise just get up early and cross and go out for breakfast somewhere to your destination."
1109036,rnnonmt,2009-05-29 07:50:00,992,Cross at night for sure if you want to have 0 wait time. Last year we crossed at night and even had to check firearms and even with having to go inside to declare the weapons we were in and out in 15 minutes. There were no other cars in line.Rnnonmt
1109115,Guest,2009-05-29 10:54:00,0,"Thanks for all the input. My preferences was to cross Friday night. However, everything I called on is full. Any decent places to stay in Fort Fancis besides Place La Rendevous and the Super 8 ?"
1109122,Steve of Madison,2009-05-29 11:15:00,230,"Those full, not surprising this close to departure, but if you do a web search of hotels you may be able to find something. Remember too, Emo Ont. has a couple of motels if you are headed up to LOW. Ft Francis is not that big, so either side of town is not a long drive if you are traveling either direction."
