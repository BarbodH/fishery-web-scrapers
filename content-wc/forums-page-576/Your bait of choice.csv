1109322,fishman10,2009-05-30 08:12:00,226,i too have a hard time buying minnows at 5$ a doz. i pick my own worms and trap my own minnows. try buying leeches by the pound or worms by the flat.
1109350,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-30 09:59:00,138,Are you a Canadian citizen? It is illegal for us foreigners to catch our own minnows.
1109355,back357,2009-05-30 10:30:00,106,"I agree about minnows being the best all around. I do bring Gulp in various presentations and find that the minnow grub in 2 or 3"" work pretty well. I have also had success with the turtle back worm. And, I too have had my share of waterskiing minnows. That sucks."
1109356,Lazy Fisherman,2009-05-30 10:37:00,276,Been using crawlers on a crawler harness.
1109415,v-bay gord,2009-05-30 17:53:00,3168,"We have great success using Rapala Taildancers. I'm not sure what makes them different from other Rapala designs but they are a very good trolling bait........walleye, pike, lake trout, etc. The various sizes ( I believe there are 4 sizes) can cover depths up to 25 feet. Live minnows on Lindy rigs are what are working right now for walleye. Taildancers are catching lakers and pike.....plus the odd walleye."

But this is what I use 98% of the time."
1109509,Seanik,2009-05-31 08:36:00,218,"We fish in Northern Quebec, regs. do not allow live minnows. The best bait for us has been leeches on a slip sinker crawling around on the bottom. Crawlers are almost as good, fished over the side or on a harness. Some guys use frozen minnows, haven't had a lot of success with them."
1108175,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-26 11:47:00,138,"We are heading up to Sioux Lookout on the 12th of June for our yearly trip. We fish Minnitaki, Big V, and Lac Suel using jig and minnows for walleye. Last year we had OK success with Gulp. With minnows at $5 a dozen it get cost prohibitive. What is your bait of choice?"
1108178,BenBeattie,2009-05-26 11:54:00,232,"Aside from minnows, crawlers or gulp would be my next choice. I only thow cranks early in the season when the walleye are in shallow water."
1108183,REG,2009-05-26 12:05:00,445,"It's really tough to beat live bait and we like minnows. But I will always try jigs with 3"" twister tails in various colors first. If the bite is on and they're relatively shallow (as they should be in early June) - the jigs will save you some money and they're convenient. In our experience - Gulp or plain twisters get about the same results."
1108283,joeman79,2009-05-26 18:26:00,417,"I like a half a crawler. Used to always use a whole one till i started fishing with Stevensink. I now catch more and miss less. I love using minnows but they are a pain, and i always forget to pull minnow bucket back into boat before I take off."
1108318,Larry Mac,2009-05-26 20:06:00,530,"We have fished the Sioux Lookout area for many years and IMHO nothing catches walleye for us like a live minnow. We double hook them and try to get the walleye in the boat before he shakes his head and throws the minnow. We realize they are expensive. We budget 2 dozen per man per day. @ $4.50/doz $8.00 per day for 7 days is $56.00 for the week per man. We have many 100 fish per boat days and everyone seems to have enough bait. We feel the results are worth the expense.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1108322,Glenman12,2009-05-26 20:16:00,762,"and i always forget to pull minnow bucket back into boat before I take off. "" been there done that more times than I would like to remember"
1108352,Jahloaf,2009-05-26 21:22:00,74,"We usually keep one of our first 4-9 lb walleyes that we catch and cut the cheek meat out and use that, works great."
1108438,Jahloaf,2009-05-27 08:52:00,74,"Im disappointed, couldn't get a reply out of anybody on this one. I guess all the people with a sense of humor are out fishing this week"
1108440,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-27 08:59:00,138,You should have given it a little more time. I'm sure the wrath of the sanctimonious would have smited you.
1108442,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-27 09:06:00,138,We have blast throwing shad raps in the English River. Bounce them across the rocks and bam. I think the record for our group is 21 fish in 21 casts. Last year there were still some nice fish in the river when it opened.
