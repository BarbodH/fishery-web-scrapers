1109706,Tonyo,2009-06-01 06:20:00,212,This card is kind of crazy when they could have just raised the price of a license by 3 dollars a year but it really is not that big a deal. We are in Canada now and just purchased licenses and cards on Saturday. It took us maybe an extra 30 minutes for the 12 of us to get the cards and licenses but it really was not that big a deal. I didn't want to pay the extra money or wait the extra time but what do you do. I am not staying home over a 9 dollar card. TonyO
