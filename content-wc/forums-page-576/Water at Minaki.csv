""The Winnipeg River immediately below Kenora is currently 240 cm (94 in) above normal while the river level at Minaki is 103 cm (41 in) above normal. River levels in Ontario are expected to change very little over the next week but will continue to rise very slowly as Lake of the Woods level rises, pushing more water through the dams."" I know Don and his party was thinking of trying Rough Rock rapids and area near the dam, for some smallie action. You guys may want to re-think that, with that much water moving through it could be nasty. The last time I looked the dam outflow was 90%, and it sounds like it will be going higher. Chuck"
