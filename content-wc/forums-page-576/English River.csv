1109726,Glenman12,2009-06-01 07:26:00,762,Thanks Chuck..Ive seen that..I just dont know what the normal level is to be able to determine how high it is..or maybe I just dont know how to read it
1109740,PRD1,2009-06-01 08:14:00,458,We just got back from the English River on the far west end. Caribou Falls and White Dog dams are moving a lot of water through them. Lake levels on Umfreville (behind Caribou Falls) are at the high end of the normal range.
