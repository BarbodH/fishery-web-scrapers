1108922,the_bronco,2009-05-28 19:21:00,86,"Moondog, talk to your ""resort"" owner he will contact Lee WHO WILL NOT PUT UP WITH THAT CRAP. The owners all talk to each other and do a good job policeing the lake. Lee, on more then one occasion, has stopped at our cabin and ask if we witnessed ""this or that"" after he has talked to other owners. He has kicked out more then one south end of a north bound horse!!!! (and all camps get them) and I know he has given other camp owners their names and addresses. Do us all a favor and do this. Hope this doesn't ruin your week! Jim"
1108953,Moondog,2009-05-28 21:26:00,362,"As soon as I got back to camp, I went to my resort owner who called Lee. He even called back for more info to confirm who the offenders were. It was a pretty sad deal, flipping large fish over their heads into the bottom of the boat while they were fishing with their second pole. Fish stayed flipping around in their boat until they had time, using 2 poles, to throw the fish over their shoulder into the water behind them. My problem was that I was so mad when I logged on right after that ...that I neglected to give the pertinent info regarding what Lee did and how concerned he was. It seemed so unfair that this boat and 2 others with Wrights Wilderness Adventures painted on the side was such bad advertisement for Lee. About 18 other boats observed all of this BS and did nothing. Approaching these bozos in the river was just not going to happen. So........done deal. They will probably all be gone Saturday morning. I know Lee is an honorable man and did take care of these jerks."
1108979,the_bronco,2009-05-29 04:03:00,86,""" flipping large fish over their heads into the bottom of the boat while they were fishing with their second pole"" ""using 2 poles, to throw the fish over their shoulder into the water behind them"" @@@holes!!! now you got me pissed- no wonder you were fired up, hopefully they go back where they came from and get a couple DUI's along the way!! Thanks Moondog, hope the rest of the week was good for you and have a safe trip home- you can fish in my boat anytime!"
1109039,Guest,2009-05-29 07:57:00,0,"I totally understand your disgust and frustration. I too would have felt the same way. I am glad you worked with the camp owners, it sounds like it turned out OK. I know I certainly don't want to ""get into it"" on the water with other fishermen, so working through it with the camp owners is the way to go. I do know that they work together, and I agree with Bronco that there have been several occasions where we have been asked if we saw certain things on the water. Even though most of us are visiting when we fish up there, we owe to the lake, each other, and the fish to be conservationalists . . . most have and that is why the resource is so good. I live in Minnesota where the fishing used to be like it is in Canada, and it is still good, but all too often I see the junk you were talking about. We all owe it to each other to be level headed and take care of business while visiting a little piece of ""heaven"" for a week. Good luck to all!"
1106400,Moondog,2009-05-19 21:46:00,362,So how was the opener on Gull Rock? We are now here and it is as cold as ****. Anyone having any early season luck? With ice out so late I think the fish are still frozen. I am. I think all the fish are up north on the spawn. Any ideas?/?
1106495,Blue Fin,2009-05-20 09:42:00,47,Glad you started the new thread Moondog. I am heading up there on the 29th and was wondering the same thing. Saw they got 9 inches of snow earlier this week. That is messed up. Great pics on the Golden Hook site. Let me know if you hear anything from the locals.
1108433,Blue Fin,2009-05-27 08:44:00,47,"So does the lack of response from people mean that the fishing has been really poor? I know that the weather has not been too cooperative so far, but things seem to be warming up a little. We leave in 2 days and it would be nice to get some feedback from someone."
1108648,Moondog,2009-05-27 21:47:00,362,"Seems that most of the ""resorts"" here are either unpopulated or have some huge #ss holes. The Flotilla continues on the Chukuni with many fish caught. There is a group staying at Wrights that think they can use 2 poles each and chuk fish (large fish) into the bottom of the boat and then continue fishing and drinking and running their boats where ever they want, over others lines and making wakes etc. NO regard for the care of the fish that entertain us and feed us. I am surprised that Lee has such ugly clientele. I digress...the water is warming up and you can catch fish where ever the bait fish are. That varies by which direction the wind comes from. It is my personal belief that the spawn is over and the great fishing is to come. Just don't get stuck over with the spuds on the Chukuni. Hope you are not staying at Wrights."
1108738,Guest,2009-05-28 09:14:00,0,"Moondog, You are pretty hard on Lee Wright. I do stay at Wright's and they are first class people. The clients that stay there the week we are always there is a good group of people. If you have an issue with some people on the lake, and you know that they are staying there, if you contact Lee he would deal with it. There are bad apples in every bushel. Lee meets with every group (as I am sure most camp owners do) - he talks about ethics, conservation, etc. I am not sure if you have an issue with him, but your shots at him on this thread are below the belt in my opinion - do you have a personal agenda regarding him? It does trouble me to see things that mention when fishing, but rather then attacking a camp owner because someone staying there is a jerk, why not handle the issue either directly with the guilty parties (although arguing on the water ruins everyone's outing), or indirectly with the camp owner? Also, if people are fishing with two lines, call the MNR."
1108760,Blue Fin,2009-05-28 10:17:00,47,"Thanks for info Moondog. This is our groups first time going to Gull Rock and we are staying at Golden Hook. We know Lee from when he was over at Snake Falls on Pakwash and he doesn't seem like the type that would continue to have guys like that back. So maybe this is their first year up there as well. We will pay attention to the wind much like Pakwash. Do you find that if the wind is blowing to the east side of the lake on Monday, that the fishing is good there right away that day, or does it lag behind a little and the fishing is good there on Tuesday?I certainly hope that we hit it right this year. It seems like most years we go up we just miss it or a front moves in and turns the lake over.Can't wait. Thanks again for the feedback."
1108773,Guest,2009-05-28 11:28:00,0,"It may take a couple of hours, but usually the wind will create a bite the same day. The next morning it should still be going if it was a steady wind."
1108783,Blue Fin,2009-05-28 12:25:00,47,That is usually how we handle it. It is when the wind changes after a few hours that I will doubt myself. Thanks for the feedback.
1108914,Moondog,2009-05-28 19:02:00,362,"I have absolutely no personal agenda regarding Lee Wright. I COMPLETELY agree he runs a first class camp and I have spoken to him on the phone in the past and find him to be a terrific guy. Sorry if you thought this was a personal attack. I was just so pissed off after seeing these people abusing this wonderful fishery and being identified with Lee's name on the boat. There were a total of 3 boats acting like fools and all were advertising badly for Lee. Yes, he was called and yes, he was upset and said he would take care of the issue as he had a pretty good idea who it was. Please accept my humble apology as I was truly PO'ed and have zero grievances against Lee or his great facility. I am sure he spoke to at least one boat-full of these guys as he was NOT happy with their bad behavior. I should have mentioned that. mea culpa"
1108918,Moondog,2009-05-28 19:14:00,362,"And........regarding to my statement about people being A## holes..........there has been a lot of that going around this past week. Fishing has been tough because of the cold weather/wind and the mouth of Sterrat Canal has been hot, not to mention out of the wind and an easy place to fish, so there is a lot of jostling around for the hot bite with little regard for others. I understand this mentality especially if you consider that most only have one week to fish. Understanding and liking it, however, are not the same. I will temper my posts in the future and LEE WRIGHT.......IF YOU READ THIS......you have a terrific place, a terrific reputation and I know that you have done your best to handle this difficult situation. I do not envy your position. I encourage anyone that is looking for a premiere place to stay and catch quality fish to give Lee a call."
