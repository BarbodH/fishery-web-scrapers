With all the weather changes over the past couple of weeks, I was wondering what to expect as far as fishing goes. Can't do anything about the weather but you can adjust your presentation to fit the pattern. We are headed up Saturday morning so any information would be greatly appreciated. Will post when we get back."

1108703,lonewolf73,2009-05-28 07:22:00,17,Nitroman & Glenman...Thanks for the info guys. With only a day to go before I leave I have really got the itch to catch some walleyes.
1108946,nitroman,2009-05-28 21:04:00,368,"ok Glenman let's say the weather holds out and we get mid 60's and light wind, girls are out of post spawn. Where do I look for them on your side of the lake? New week for me my normal week is 40's-50's and raining with high winds. There is a bay just south of Cedar Lake lodge on the east side of the lake, big bay with a feeder creek in the back we have had some luck there until you drift into the south end then the nords seems to take over. Other than that bay I have never really fished that side of the lake. You don't have to give up your ""good"" spots but just point me in the right direction. Bringing my boat up this year so I will have the ability to see more of the lake,with camp boats you really need to pick the leg of the lake you want and hit it I never liked the hour travel time from the east leg to the west leg so I always fished the east leg because I was comfortable there. Thanks Nitro....."
