Just arrived today, one of the slowest days I've had on this lake and I've been coming since 96'. I figure they are shallow and the bite is slow, but I actually fell asleep in the boat today! I think tomorrow I will try the creeks that run into Sawmill bay. Anything would be appreciated thanks!"

Its a bit of a boat ride but we have always had good luck.Also, there are two small islands directly north of Manitoba Pt that are usually good early season spots. Between the islands the water is between 5-15ft. I have been everywhere North of Manitoba Pt, however, I have never been south. Has anyone been south of Manitoba Pt? If so, where are some good spots? Thats some big water to the south of Manitoba pt and I've heard some unbelievable muskies are there????Thanks,"

And also there are some real good bays and islands to the bottom side of south bay near the waterfall.past the far east side of big island are some tree stumps good during the mid summer hot days.Heading to Fishermans Cove May 30 thru June 5th hoping the post spawn is over... Good Luck fishing guys.!!"
1108176,BenBeattie,2009-05-26 11:51:00,232,"Hi Lodo,Yes, the stretch of water south of Manitba point is a huge section of water, with a lot of areas to catch fish. You can also head east along the north shore for more areas that are quite good. If you like to explore and try new stuff, by all means, there are walleye to be caught everywhere in this lake. As always, be versatile in the types of structure you are fishing and always cover different depths to find fish. June is one of my favourite months for catching walleye. As for muskies... I haven't heard of too many from that area. You'll have to head way east towards Sioux Lookout /Chamberlain narrows to find the fishable muskie population on Lac Seul."
1108744,LoDo,2009-05-28 09:34:00,721,"This will be my 4th year in a row at Lac Seul. I stayed in the Ear Falls area the first year and we found ourselves boating to McKenzie Bay area to hunt big walleyes, which is a long boat ride. The last two years we have stayed south of Ear Falls at Lac Seul Lodge because the boat ride from Lac Seul Lodge to McKenzie is much closer. This year will be our first at Fishermans Cove. I can hardly wait.I would like to see some more chatter on this thread.....Someone needs to send a fishing report? Water temps, spawning, bait, etc....?Happy Fishing!!LoDo"
