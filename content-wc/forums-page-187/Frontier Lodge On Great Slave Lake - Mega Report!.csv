5641601,kona77,2017-07-01 15:22:00,236,Wow and Wow.. Have only experienced catching 4-8lb lakers on some trips to Manitoba years ago and I know how hard those fish fought. Need to get up to a place like Great Slave to get real lake trout action..Thanks for sharing..
5642281,Rich B,2017-07-01 22:28:00,1081,"Another great write-up with outstanding photos to ""tell the story"". Passing on links to your article as well as to this lodge to several friends. Keep on ""keeping on""....you are an inspiration to many of us Rich B"

5080641,Larry S,2016-08-24 18:11:00,665,Great report Mike. I went to Misaw Lake in Saskatchewan in 1988 and had a ball with Lake trout from small to 25 lbs also got many large pike up to 45inches. Got my biggest grayling there too

Pretty much anywhere in northern Saskatchewan is amazing I think. I'm still feeling your pain over not being able to go this year. I'll bet next year can't come soon enough eh?

Just returned from Evans last night and it was pretty okay - if you like catching scads of giant pike. Story will be done in less than a week.Quote: Originally Posted by BrianEThanks Mike, great job writing that one and again thanks a million for sharing.

5074482,Mike Borger,2016-08-22 07:33:00,1554,"It's difficult for me to express just how amazing this trip really was. Scads of trophy sized lake trout, giant sized pike and arctic grayling on the fly. Literally jaw dropping scenery, dancing northern lights, muskox grazing along the shoreline - it was something very, very special!Last winter we held a contest for one lucky angler to join me on the trip and it turned out to be Greg Knapp from Grand Rapids Michigan, truly a great guy and one heck of a good angler!The full story is pretty epic, as always loaded with lots of photos and video.

5075906,yoopertrout,2016-08-22 16:03:00,1172,"Wow is right! Huge trout, pike and grayling, and getting to see a muskox. Very cool."
5076082,adempsey2.0,2016-08-22 17:16:00,612,"Fantastic report Mike. You'd think you were catching walleye in those videos with that amount of action! Looks like an incredible place, definitely bucket list material."
5076186,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-22 17:46:00,8293,"Well done, although I must say you must have a cast iron a$$ to ride those camp boats week after week, month after month. Where does the next adventure take you?"
5076218,Mike Borger,2016-08-22 18:07:00,1554,"Largest was 25lb's on the scale. TONS of 15-20 pound fish. No super tanker sized fish but I'm not complaining, it was amazing!Quote: Originally Posted by yoopertroutWow is right! Huge trout, pike and grayling, and getting to see a muskox. Very cool.Maybe my most memorable trip to date. Quote: Originally Posted by adempsey2.0Fantastic report Mike. You'd think you were catching walleye in those videos with that amount of action! Looks like an incredible place, definitely bucket list material.It was exactly like jigging for alleye, just on a grander scale. Deeper water, bigger structure, bigger fish... Was so much fun!!Quote: Originally Posted by That Minnesota guyWell done, although I must say you must have a cast iron a$$ to ride those camp boats week after week, month after month. Where does the next adventure take you?Nah, I'm at home in a tinny. I leave this Thursday for Lac Evans in Quebec with my son. Hoping to put the kid onto a few big pike."
