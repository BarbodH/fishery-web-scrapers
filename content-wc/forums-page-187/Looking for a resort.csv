5635202,Moosebunk,2017-06-27 20:37:00,211,"Again for Lake Of The Woods... partly because, this area of the lake is a little more protected from the big lake when it gets ugly and, a friend just bought it. The new owner has experience managing Slippery Winds and, has guided on Kasba Lake for lake trout as well as hunts in B.C. and Manitoba. Doing great this first summer at the lodge. Has you covered for the meals, boats and fish you're after. Easy to get to from where you live.http://lakeofthewoodslodge.com/"

5643425,Hawker,2017-07-03 06:22:00,3967,"Young's Wilderness Camp on Lake of the Woods fits your requests and needs PERFECTLY!! Been going there every year for the past 26 years straight and can't recommend them highly enough!! 1 1/2 hr drive north from International Falls, just north of Nestor Falls.(http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com/)"
5621594,wingmann,2017-06-20 17:36:00,42,"Putting a group of 5-8 guys together for a trip to Canada and looking for a resort that has an American Plan. Want to find a lake within a 3 hour drive of Baudette or International Falls that has walleye, northerns, smallmouth and perch. Looking for more action than trophies. Fishing experience of everyone is average. Some a little better than others.Trying to find a place on a smaller lake than LOTW. Guys are older and like the boats with the electric start, floors, livewell and good seats. Nice and clean cabins with good meals.Would like to find a place that won't break the bank but understand we will pay for all we are requesting. Guessing we will need a guide for one or two days depending on the place.Please let me know any places you recommend that might fit our needs. Thank you in advance."
5621650,hoppy63,2017-06-20 18:59:00,367,"I know it does not fit all your requests, and I have not been here but know someone who has been and really enjoyed it but you might try Manotak lodge."

5621666,Guest,2017-06-20 19:01:00,0,"Wingman, Don't know where your located but Temple Bay has American Plan,coach bus service from Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota or you can drive up. They are located on Eagle Lake, big lake but lots of small bays and fingers you can fish and feel like your on a smaller lake. Boats all have depth finders, live wells, etc. Upgrade to a bigger boat is available for reasonable price. Lodge is 3 hrs North of International Fall/Fort Francis. Great food, nice cabins, nice bar lounge over looking lake, great service. I have been going on the bus for 12 years and many of those I go with over 23 years. Lots of fish- big & small. Nice jumbo perch, big walleyes, over 4 30"" were caught in my boat the last 4 years. Many slot and plenty of Shore lunchers. Small mouth are the size of footballs. I don't fish northern but we catch a lot while fishing the humps for walleyes. There is a big waterproof EagleLake Map you can purchase that has many of the spots marked. Guides are available and Jeff the manager at Temple Bay will help put you on fish. Unknown if he has any openings this year. The trip from Central Wisconsin is a 5 night 4 days fishing trip. Leave 6:00 am from Wautoma on bus, stop in Duluth for lunch then TB provides a Subway Sandwich at Int Falls and a cooler full of beverages all the way on the bus. Depending on traffic, border crossing and construction usually arrive at about 7:00pm. Cabin assignments upon arrival, put gear in cabin then the safety meeting, boat assignments and updates on fishing patterns at the main lodge. The Central Wisconsin Plan has in the past included one day of guide service, unsure if this will be in the future though. All transportation included to Lodge, unlimited gas for boat, all meals, dock hands clean & freeze your fish and a nice clean cabin and if needed air conditioned cabins. 2 dozen free minnows per fisherman per day. You can check their website for cost. But don't forget to add in Canadian tax, boat insurance and tips. I am usually around $1000 for my cost for all. TB has bus trips for full weeks if that's what your thing if doing. Any other questions let me know and I will try to help. I leave next week Tuesday for my annual trip."
5623970,wingmann,2017-06-21 19:28:00,42,Thank you for the recommendations. I have checked all resorts listed so far and they look pretty good. Never thought about taking the bus but I'm sure some of our group would like not having to drive the 14 hours.Still looking for more options. Please keep the recommendations coming.Thanks!
5624194,Bill Krejca,2017-06-21 20:25:00,6107,"Check out Obabikon. It is on LOW, but you get picked up from near Morson and stay out on the lake, lots of places to fish around camp which does not get the big blows. Bill"
5633842,narly12,2017-06-27 09:50:00,13,"try Lost Island Lodge web site. been going there for 13 years and guides, food fishing knowledge is excellent. A little further that 3 hours, but worth the trip."
5633994,Big Louie,2017-06-27 10:47:00,22,"Check out Lost Island Lodge, I know they have an open cabin July 14-19. It is on Lac Seul near Hudson and while Lac Seul is a gig lake, the area around Lost Island Lodge us like fishing numerous small, interconnected lakes. Email Shane at [email protected] or check out their website at lostislandlodge.com. You can call Shane at 807-582-3366"
5634050,Guest,2017-06-27 11:03:00,0,Fits all your needs. I have been there a couple of times and they offered free guide service for a day. It is on LOW but on a bay.
