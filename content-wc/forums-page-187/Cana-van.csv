We were able to pick one up pretty cheap, and I have to say with the Captain's Chairs in the back it makes for a much more comfortable ride to the border. Being 6'6"", leg room is much desired, and this rig really allows folks to stretch out. Would be curious to see if anybody else has a rig designated for their trips North. Our trip is one month out."

Loved the height, ride, and the fact that the kids all got their own seats. Didn't like the mileage, But this is not a bad idea at all if you have a 4 man group, take out the rear seat, for storage, Put a receiver hitch on for the cargo rack and roof racks and you are good to go. Nice!"
5639289,Bstar,2017-06-30 03:28:00,564,"I currently have a 2003 Ford E150 conversion van that we use for our trips. It has 85,000 miles on it and is in excellent condition. We usually haul all of the gear and four people in it. It gets around 17 mpg on the highway. Originally bought it to haul my two Labs around to obedience trials. No longer involved in that so it sits in the driveway most of the time. It's a comfortable way to travel."
5639529,packpro,2017-06-30 07:36:00,695,"Picked up this mini bus from a local church. Sort of looks like a hotel or rental car van. They used it to pick up their senior members on Sunday morning and for an occasional church outing. Had 77K miles on it. Paid $4,400.00 split between three guys. Originally had all the seats running under the windows facing each other. Tore those out. Went to office max and bought gas elevate and tilt office chairs. Put in three rows of three. Bed for overnight driver installed behind the last row. TV/DVD Installed up front on the ceiling between the driver and passenger seats. Holds 12, and pulls a trailer with the gear. If you look at the group picture you will see four spots on top of the cab. Two pointed left/right and two pointed straight forward. Good for about one mile of vision. That was specifically for 502 and 17 when we would travel overnight. Looked like a freight train. Passenger had to control the toggle for on coming traffic. Also a great tailgating vehicle. Charge the fellas and extra $100 the first year for the upgrades, and extra $50 for licenses and maintenance of the vehicle and trailer after that. No complaints. Lots of laughs with the whole group together on the trip."
5639593,kcguy68,2017-06-30 08:03:00,51,That's fantastic! Thanks for sharing.
5639721,Rich B,2017-06-30 09:05:00,1081,"Packpro, That's one great traveling van you have rigged up....comfortable inside and with safety roof lighting for those northern roads after dark. Like the idea of the driver's sleeper bed in the van, and those comfortable chairs....looks like you eat good food on the road as well (ha). Rich B"
5639849,Bstar,2017-06-30 10:54:00,564,"Packpro, That is one cool Canavan! Just wondering about the safety factor with those office chairs in the event of an accident? Btw did the Hooters girl come with the van?"
5640121,turkeyriver,2017-06-30 13:51:00,80,"Last Nov. I found a 1999 Ford conversion with 55,000 miles that was stored winters. So clean its a shame to fill it with fishermen! Six of us in the van pulling a 5X8 enclosed Featherlight trailer. First trip up next week. Hope she holds together."
5640489,packpro,2017-06-30 19:45:00,695,I was just very lucky to be a part owner. One of the other owners was a semi retired McGyver type. He had the time and the skill set to pull it all together over a winter. The lights on top came from a near (very)miss on 502 with a huge bull moose prior to the bus. Our yearly fishing trip was one his life's passions so he pulled the rig together to make it nice for our group. Lots of laughs and lots of great stories told in that bus.
5640889,btyreprich,2017-07-01 07:20:00,1067,"Very cool stories here - thanks for sharing guys. Makes sense to do this IF you have a group to share costs and fill up the truck / van. Keeps mileage off a personal car. With just my buddy and I, I doubt we'd buy such a vehicle. Just the same I'm impressed with what some groups do to travel safely & in comfort. Guess the key is to find a gently used vehicle."
