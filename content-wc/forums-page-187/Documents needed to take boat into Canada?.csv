Heard a story several years ago about a guy in the town I live in hit something and his insurance company supposedly didn't cover since it was out of the country? Don't know who the company was but I did check with mine. Fortunately never needed. I take my boat every year and have never been asked for anything regarding the boat/trailer .

Wardens checked us on the water last year, but were only interested in seeing fishing licenses, life jackets, and inside the livewell."
5643897,billy weaver,2017-07-03 11:05:00,470,I call my insurance agent and he provides me a card verifying that I have liability insurance when in Canada. That is to show I am covered in the case of a accident while in the boat.

5627514,BornToFish,2017-06-23 12:15:00,1224,"Greetings,I don't trailer my rig to Canada, so I don't worry about your question. I simply rent a boat from the fishing lodge.However, I travel with a group of guys that pull snowmobiles to Canada each winter. I know that they bring proof of ownership for their snowmobiles and trailers. This is beyond proof of registration. They told me that they do this for good reason.It's well known that thieves steal snowmobiles, boats and trailers and take them to Canada to sell for cash. If the Border Services people happen to be looking for a stolen boat that happens to look like your boat, you could be in for a very long day.I'm not suggesting that you take the original Title for your boat and/or trailer, but at least a copy might work if you are asked to prove ownership.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5627730,swank,2017-06-23 13:47:00,44,I have never been asked when crossing but always have registration and proof of insurance with me.
5628450,Baseline,2017-06-23 21:46:00,3207,I been hauling a boat across the border 6 to 10 times a year for 36 years and have never been asked a question about the ownership of my boat or trailer. Both are properly licensed and I carry the registration cards in my wallet.
5628458,bowtech840,2017-06-23 22:30:00,111,I've been asked who owns the vehicle and then who owns the boat? They've never checked papers tho.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk

5628770,Jesse-WI,2017-06-24 07:58:00,534,I have had the boat registration checked once in 20 years and that was on the water in Lac Seul.
