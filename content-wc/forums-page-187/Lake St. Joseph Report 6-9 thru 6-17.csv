5619090,ziggyzag,2017-06-19 15:03:00,125,"First a little back ground of how myself and cousin became a part of the group which headed to L.S.J for the week. I responded to a post here on W.C. looking to fill a couple of spots for there trip from June 10th thru June 17th so after contacting ""Paul"" the arrangements where set for us to join there group to L.S.J a lake I have always wanted to fish and was high on my bucket list. L.S.J. is a large body of water so it was nice to be going with a group of guys who have fished it several times and new the lake fairly well around the cabin. Let me also say that the group of gentlemen we joined up with turned out to be not only great fisherman but all around nice people and we all became friends. So a Big Thank You to ""Paul, Pat, Jim, Tom, Bill, Dave"" for letting myself ""Jeff"" and Robert my cousin for letting us tag along and sharing this great adventure with all of you. Now for the Fishing: Sat: Windy and Rainy this would turn out to be the weather for the week. Robert and I started out trolling from camp as we looked for a likely spot to jig fish for walleye's and picked up 15 fish on our way which turned out to be only half mile from camp we found a little mid lake island with the wind blowing on to it and started to fish or should I say catch, we landed 45 nice walleye's in less than 3 hours before being chased from the lake due to thunder storms. Not a bad start for fishing around 6 hours. 60 fish boated Sun: Windy and Rainy we started out at the little mid lake island we fished the day before and again the catching was great. Wanting to move on we jumped to the next larger island and started to troll up the shore line and again boated fish after fish until we spied a small rock island out in the lake with the wind blowing across we sat up and started to jig fish and once again the fishing was more like catching and we ended the day with 103 fish boated. Mon: Windy but not so much rain we headed out to explore a bay we saw on the map with a very nice point which looked like it would be holding fish with the wind direction we had, as prior days we trolled are way there picking up fish at a consistent pace until we reached our destination. Here again the choice was spot on and the catching commenced we boated fish after fish with most walleye's being 19 to 20 inches and very healthy. 85 fish boated Tue: Windy with some rain again we being the adventurist type headed to another large bay north of camp and as prior days we trolled on the way up and into the bay and one again we pick up fish everywhere along the way we did find a nice neck down spot up in the bay and started jig fish and again the fishing was easy. 90 fish boated Wen: Windy and rainy this day we followed the group to a in flowing river system where we all caught plenty of fish. We moved out from there to fish another small rock island out in the middle of the lake and yes one again the fishing was easy. 102 fish boated Thru: Windy and rainy again Robert and I headed out to a large island point with the wind sweeping across and yes you guessed it the place was loaded with both pike and walleye's and we boated another 100 fish day this spot was such a great jig fishing spot we named it ""Franks point"" after my father. Fri: Windy and rainy again for our last day Robert and I decided to troll the shore line headed to Frank's point this island shore line is about 3/4 miles long and by the time we made it to ""Franks Point we had boated 34 fish seeing that the bite was so good trolling #9 Count Downs in the Clown Version we continued to troll all day and yes even trolling we boated 106 fish now I must say I have never experienced such fishing in my 30 + trips to Canada Summary: Best avg. size walleye's I have experienced best walleye for us was 23 1/2 but the best for the group was 25 1/2 (6) pike over 34 inches by us with the best being 38 1/2 all of them big and fat Accommodations thru Winoga Lodge where top notch Cabin very nice to say the least, the boats and motors great 16 ft with 20hp 4 stroke motors. And to all the guys in the group remember to take your CUFF-LINKS next year. LAKE ST. JOSEPH IS INDEED A FISH FACTORY. Thing to note we never all week pulled up to a spot to fish and did not catch some fish this lake is polluted with fish. One for the Bucket List indeed."
5619698,Bstar,2017-06-19 20:14:00,564,Sounds like you had a great trip even with the less than ideal weather. Those are some impressive numbers.
5619770,stjoeguy,2017-06-19 20:52:00,979,"Wow, Jeff. Good report. I was just writing one but you beat me to it. This year's trip was 5 returning guys and 3 newcomers that responded to my Walleye Central post. It turned out to be a very good group that worked well together. I know the newcomers were wondering what they were getting themselves into, joining a group sight unseen, but it worked out very good. Their response to fishing Lake St. Joseph for the first time tended to be along the lines of: This is an awesome lake. It definitely lives up to it's reputation. On the drive up we saw 5 bears and 6 moose, a record for us. During the week we saw two moose at Pembina River and saw another one from the cabin deck while it was swimming between two islands across the bay from us. The week started with a slight hitch. I lost Dave on the way out. Dave launched his boat first. Then the camp barge was launched and took off for the 25 mile ride to the cabin. It took a while launching my boat but eventually we made the 45 minute ride down the lake. First thing Jim & I noticed when we got to the cabin was the barge and no Dave. I thought he had followed the barge. So we turned around and starting going back to the landing to find him. About 15 minutes into the return trip I saw Dave coming out from behind an island across the lake. If I had left a minute earlier the island would have been between us and I would have missed him. He was off-course but had done a pretty good job getting as far as he had. It turns out Jim and I had roared past Dave near the landing and even waved at him, not recognizing him but thinking he was just another fishing boat from the nearby camps. He had followed us for a while and then followed a couple other boats through Boulder City and was about ready to turn around and head back to the landing when we found him. The week was cool, wet, and windy. Very windy. The wind determined where we could fish but just about every spot produced fish. Our best spots were Sandy island, Brodribb Bay, the shoreline opposite the opening to the cabin bay and Pembina River. We fished the river several days because once you got there it was protected and easy to fish. We saw two more moose up there. As Jeff said, fishing was great. There were no huge fish this year, with the largest being a 25.5 walleye and 38.5 northern. What struck us, though, was the overall size of the walleyes with 18-21 being the most common range. We tried jigging with minnows, but plastic worked just as well and I've sworn off minnows again. They're costly and just too much work. We came in with good weather and left with good weather, which is great for the 25 mile boat ride. The trip out wasn't without incident, however. Two years ago, Dave hit rocks twice on the first day and his boat spent the rest of the week at the dock. This year, other than losing him on the way in, he followed me closely and all went well until the trip out. About 20 miles into the return trip we looked back and Dave had stopped. He thought he had hit a rock but it was 60' deep there. His lower unit had blown up and ripped open two holes, so we towed him the last 5-6 miles. If anyone wants a slightly used E-TEC I know where one is probably for sale, cheap. The cuff-links Jeff mentioned was one of the biggest laughs of the trip. Jim was telling a story about how I come into the room at night and turn on the light looking for my carpal tunnel wrist braces. But he struggled with coming up with wrist brace and it came out as cuff-links. From then on I was wearing cuff-links to bed. Another great trip is in the books. Thanks to Walleye Central for helping me find 3 guys to round out the group. Weather could have been better, but the bugs were OK and the fishing was great."

5620554,wmd,2017-06-20 09:22:00,388,"I was one of the three that responded to Stjoeguy's post. It was a very good decision on my part as the guys on the trip were great and the fishing was beyond good. The best lake in Canada that I had been on until now was Birch Lake. Lake St. Joseph is a step above that. The first day on the lake my boat partner and I caught 100 walleyes in about six hours of fishing and abut 60 of those were over 20 inches. We had 2 25 inches that day as well. We did not have a day like that again as far as the 20 inch go but the numbers were there and 20 inch plus fish were very common. I would guess that I caught 115-125 20 inch fish personally that week. It was a great trip on a massive body of water that at first glance can be a little intimidating. Fish were every where and I believe that we caught fish at every spot we fished, that is great fishing. I look forward to going back to St Joe again and again. wmd"
5621210,btyreprich,2017-06-20 14:55:00,1067,Fished this lake several times - just love it. It's a good 2 1/2 hours more of a drive than to where we now go on Lac Seul - also good fishing. Will definitely make it back to Lake St Joe in a few years after I retire. Perhaps there'll be an open seat for me on one of these group trips with guys that know the lake. The lake is FULL OF reefs - lower unit hazard!
5645201,fldoc1,2017-07-04 08:58:00,69,"Wow! Congrats on a fun, successful trip. Even if the weather was so-so it sounds like everyone had a good time. It is nice when you add new fisherman and it works out well. A great fishing report. Caught lots of fish everywhere. I sure want to fish that area of the lake someday. I have a good friend that fishes down there with the guides and always has a good report. We will need to put a return to St Joe on our bucket list.It seems like your change of dates worked well as there was no mention of Mayflies.Wendy and I did our annual husband-wife fishing trip and went to LOW the week before and had beautiful weather. This is our third year and we are learning more and more about the lake. Wendy likes fishing with bottom bouncers with worms vs. say jigging. We ended up fishing earlier and later in the day and moved to some reefs in more open water. She caught five nice walleyes 28, 26, 24,24,20 (10-20) and I caught less. I did better when I moved to the back of the boat so the bottom bouncer was not directly under the boat. It seemed like her Ugly stick was setting the hook much better than my graphite rod. I now have 2 Ugly sticks. We stay at Mylies Place in Morson and again booked the 5th -10th of 2018. I was hoping to adjust the dates so we can join you sometime in the future but no luck yet. When Spring comes I will see if I can move the dates. We have been trying to get another couple with their own boat to join us but no luck yet. We would need a bigger cabin so may have to move the dates. It just seems like our current dates are in a sweet spot matching weather and fishing. The guys fishing trip will be in early September to LOW for the first time so curious as to how the fishing will be. We will be staying with friends at a private lodge, great location, 12 miles west of Morson.Originally I thought we would join you this year but when you moved your dates up it did not work out for me. I encouraged my brother and his Memphis friend to join you without me but apparently they like fishing with me. I do have a nice boat so that may be the real reason.Randy from Duluth"
