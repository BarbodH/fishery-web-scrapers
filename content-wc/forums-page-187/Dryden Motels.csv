5486826,jigger47,2017-04-19 17:57:00,39,I've stayed at the Hide Away inn its east of town years ago. It gets good ratings on trip advisor.

We usually have a group of 8 and rent a cabin for the night. Much more economical and the Boats are in a private setting. One year a boat was cleaned out in a hotel parking lot. Plus, they serve some mighty fine meals."

5484474,btyreprich,2017-04-18 21:41:00,1067,Next to the McDonalds is a Comfort Inn I believe. Have not stayed there as we overnight in International Falls. However this hotel looks nice from the outside. Might I suggest you check out Traveladvisor on the web for hotel reviews in Dryden. I use this site to find my hotels when traveling for business.
5484746,Skywagon,2017-04-19 05:46:00,1106,"There is also a Best Western and Holiday Inn Express in town. I would think any of the three would be nice enough to stay in and would be of similar price. There are other smaller motels in town, but the three mentioned would be my pick. I would suggest getting your reservation in now, motels in town get busy when walleye season opens."
5484770,pjshorthorn,2017-04-19 05:51:00,5654,I stayed at the Holiday Inn Express back in 2013 when it was brand new. The only issue I had was having to watch for a resident bear when I was walking to and from the car when it was dark out. Nice place....no clue on what they are asking for in terms of room rates. I did become a better walleye angler for having stayed there.... PjShorthorn
5485162,Lovetofish,2017-04-19 07:26:00,458,I have stayed in all three mentioned. I prefer the Best Western. They have a bar/restaurant on location. If you're pulling a boat the Comfort Inn does not have the best parking. But all three were fine as far as rooms. $120 might be a little short though.
5485362,prov1800,2017-04-19 08:27:00,5010,there are also two motels in vermilion bay.pine grove as you drive in from east and the northside in the middle of town.both comfy.
5485394,Limeyangler,2017-04-19 08:34:00,563,"I have a tent by the lake, plenty of room for the boat, fishing right there....$50."
5485466,Lovetofish,2017-04-19 08:50:00,458,CAD or US dollars?
5485666,johnboat,2017-04-19 09:41:00,2014,At this late stage of the game you might have to settle on what is open. Unless you are not staying on a weekend. I have been at them all. No real big issues. Parking does vary but is doable.
5485914,cuamb,2017-04-19 11:06:00,203,"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Express with my wife and it is nice. May be a little more than you want to spend. When we go with just the guys we stay at the Chalet Inn. It is walking distance to the Best Western where we go to eat. We pay $80 per night. Rooms are clean but the place is a bit rustic.They do have new owners as of Jan. 15th 2017. So, past performance does not guarantee future results."
