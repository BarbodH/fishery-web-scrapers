Definitely wouldn't recommend having loose cans in the back of a boat during transit though. More problematic than price is availability. Nothing worse than wanting to go out fishing and the outfitter is out of gas, or sales only certain times. If you want to go fishing at 6 am and need to gas up, but you can't buy it until 9, well thats a problem. Yea, I know get it the night before, but if you happen to be fishing and gas sales end at 5pm your out of luck again."
5641585,Pooch,2017-07-01 15:04:00,4618,"I've never been to any camp that didn't have someone on the docks by seven, most are earlier.Carrying fuel in the back of a truck is common in farm country, but it is in an approved metal container and pump and usually diesel. Any kind of gasoline in any container in the back of a truck is a problem looking for a place to happen. If one is fishing a remote location then the fuel has to be transported in something. I understand this as well as anyone. It's the containers that guys choose and how they store them that is the problem.Couple years ago in camp that prohibits gasoline being brought in, one bright young man brings in a half dozen plastic containers and hides them in the weeds. Then someone backs over them not knowing they are there. Real nice move DA. Could have been a disaster for all involved and also those not involved.It's just not a good idea IMO. That's all.Pooch"

5642089,pjshorthorn,2017-07-01 19:22:00,5654,Point the fireworks out over the lake tonight. We wouldn't want any singed flamingo wings or specialty toilet paper going up in flames. PjShorthorn
5644345,Huntindave,2017-07-03 16:53:00,2194,"Last year at camp, a group was refueling their boat from 5 gal cans. Spilling a LOT and I mean a LOT of gasoline in the process. As my boat partner and I came in to the dock from the lake, the stench of gasoline was overwhelming. Gasoline floated across the water surrounding the docks and boats tied up to them.What a disaster waiting to happen!"
5644441,DaBirdman,2017-07-03 17:50:00,164,"Some interesting stories being shared! Some years ago I was on a real tight budget with low pay and no paid vacation. So it cost money to go, and then i lost money by going. Back in those days I brought a couple full cans with. But for the past number of trips I just fill the boat tank full before leaving home and whenever I need gas, just hook up the trailer, load the boat on, drive up to the pump and get it re-filled. Then just go launch again. Only takes about 15 - 20 minutes and is way easier (and cleaner) than filling up 5gal cans and trying to gas up at the dock. Easier on the back too!"
5645681,BreezyPoint,2017-07-04 14:27:00,1581,"I really think Pooch has it right. Calculate the amount you save. It is a small amount,especially after being divided between three or four guys. In addition, the resort owner pays for the infrastructure to have that gas available to you so they should be entitled to a profit on the sale. If you can't get gas at 6:30 am, you can always plan ahead and fill the night before.When I go to Canada, I often see guys carrying 30-40 gallons on a hitch rack. It is a disaster waiting to happen.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
5640145,DaBirdman,2017-06-30 14:04:00,164,Just curious what people are seeing for gas prices at the resorts you've been to? It's been a couple years since I've been to the resort and im not sure what to expect?
5640321,Multispecies Guy,2017-06-30 16:25:00,447,During the first week of June I paid $7.50 per Imperial gallon (1.2 US gal) at a boat-to camp.
5640465,1K1MOA,2017-06-30 19:16:00,90,"First week of June was $1.50 per liter,"
5640529,martinbns,2017-06-30 20:15:00,1520,$1.50/litre
5640545,drlee,2017-06-30 20:26:00,409,"$6 a gallon. In a week, with my Yamaha 50HP 4 stroke, I go through about 20 gallons I buy in the US and another 10-15 in Canada at the camps. Some of the guys bring up their own gas from the US. But, even though our camps are ok with that, I pass up the hassle and spend a few extra bucks. Just my choice, not a recommendation."
5640569,DaBirdman,2017-06-30 21:12:00,164,"Thanks for the replies! I used to fill up 5 gallon cans and haul them up across the border, but haven't done that for a while now. This year I plan to do some traveling in the boat and fish new waters. So it's nice to have a general idea of gas prices in order to budget for the added miles I'll put on."
5640777,Pooch,2017-07-01 05:57:00,4618,"^^^ Exactly right on IMO.Carrying a bunch of gas to Canada is a disaster waiting to happen. I see guys in some groups bring in plastic five gallon containers because they are too cheap to spend a few extra dollars on the trip and buy gas in camp.What price for safety?? Yourself and innocent bystanders?? Get your boat rear ended on the highway and you have cheap plastic full gas cans in it? Good grief what are you guys thinking?Sorry for the mini rant, but after a life in the fire service and seeing things like this happen it just trips my hammer. Handle a burnt dead body a few times and I assure you will change your thinking.Pooch"
5640809,Obabikon,2017-07-01 06:07:00,2370,"We're a boat in camp, and it is running just over $6 per US gallon. (in US dollars)"
5640881,btyreprich,2017-07-01 07:14:00,1067,"We used to bring a few gas jugs with us not for the boat but to fill our truck for the return trip home. Even if we'd fill up the truck on our arrival in camp, the odor of the empty gas cans by the cabin was too obnoxious to deal with. Most lodges prohibit guests bringing gas into the camp of insurance reasons. Cannot believe we were that cheap / silly. Now we fill up at the border and put in a half tank at Ear Falls for the return trip home. Have had many lodge owners tell me that the prices they charge for gas is based on their purchase price in early spring - often times before the lodge opens. Some of these lodge owners say that fuel is not a product center for them. It's better to just budget for the fule costs accordingly and just travel smart like Pooch said."
5640985,Lazy Fisherman,2017-07-01 08:32:00,276,"What ""Pooch"" said. It is just an accident waiting to happen."
