5640937,FrankLeigh,2017-07-01 08:14:00,80,"Just returned from 6 days of fishing the Bay of Quinte (mostly Hay Bay). The results were a little disappointing. Although we were catching walleye, they were small, with average size being in the 12 to 14 inch range, nothing over 16. We tried a variety of techniques, with the most successful being a bottom bouncer, trailing a spinner blade with a worm. These were drifted or trolled along weed edges and depth changes. A few were caught on Erie Dearies, as well as CC Shads. Lots of small perch, a few smallmouth, a couple of small pike and a couple of very large sheephead, 15 to 20 lbs. It was very windy (40 km) and wet. Surface temp was 71 to 73 deg, F. FrankLeigh"
