The extra money doesn't bother me with a better place and better fishing in the NW region. We are coming from Cincinnati, Ohio and usually go up through the Soo to the White River/Hornepayne area. We will be going with Slate Falls Outposts to Minniss West, August 19-26 and from all accounts, the outfit appears to be great with an exceptional lake. I'm sure it will be great but if anyone has any tips, spots or marked maps please share lol. We have been on about 8 fly ins with a couple drive ins. Almost went to St. Joes and Lac Seul Outposts but settled with Verne on Minnis, thanks."

You will likely sleep on a better mattress in camp than your hotel stay on your trip there or back. Stayed at Maskara last year and wish i could have gone back this year. Will definitely go back in the future. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk"

Now only if I could get one or two of them to go to BC with me. I was there last September in the Kispiox area for a hunt and fished the Skeena River for steelhead and coho's. It was the most beautiful place I've ever been/seen. Bstar, got the message and I will be replying."
