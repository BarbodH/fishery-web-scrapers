We have traditionally shot them off on July 1 every year. Kids always loved it when they were younger. I never needed them myself but have responded twice to people who needed help. Nothing serious just ended up towing them in.

5637802,Baseline,2017-06-29 05:52:00,3207,"In the past I've been asked if I had a flare gun when crossing the border. The answer was ""no"" so we moved on to the next question. I've never checked on the law, but there has to be a reason they are asking."

5643449,PatSea,2017-07-03 06:31:00,112,My understanding is flare guns are now allowed as long as the flare shell is not loaded into the gun. So in other words it's legal to carry the common flare gun kit with the flare shells in the kit but not actually loaded into the gun chamber.
