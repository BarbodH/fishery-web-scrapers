5644777,DaBirdman,2017-07-03 20:46:00,164,"Sometimes people make bad decisions and wind up breaking a law. They pay their dues (whether it be jail time or financial) and for the remainder of their lives are good, maybe excellent citizens of their home country. They go on to lead good honest lives, contribute to society, possibly do a lot of free public service work, charity work, etc. they raise good families and maybe become a voice for (or against) whatever law they broke. Should these people, regardless of country, be shunned, labeled and rejected from traveling and exploring other parts of the world? I guess I feel people should be given second chances, especially if they've demonstrated over time that what they did won't happen again. At times it seems people are too eager to draw & quarter those who have broken a law....like they want them burned in effigy or some other archaic ritual. Good people make bad decisions. Always been like that and always will be. Give them the opportunity to redeem (or rehabilitate) themselves and if they do so, allow them to experience what your country has to offer. Just my two cents. And for what it's worth, my comments pertain to the subject matter at hand."
5644801,Ver88,2017-07-03 21:24:00,114,"While I understand what you are saying, I don't really agree with it. People who break this law should know the consequences before they break the law. In this case the choice to break this law has consequences beyond what the USA has to offer. Part of someone paying their dues, in this case, is the decreased ability to visit certain countries. So, while they may have paid their dues in the USA, canada has decided they still owe a little more. People should be given second chances and I think Canada does let dui recipients into their country after a certain amount of time has past. Someone correct me if I am wrong on that."
5643649,Guest,2017-07-03 09:08:00,0,"The DUI issue for crossing into Canada is puzzling to me. While it is a serious offense, I don't believe it should prevent you from entering. It has hurt their tourism. Our resort owner suggests that the DUI person should not be allowed to operate a boat or car while in Canada. It sounds reasonable to me. In Wisconsin fishermen have just opted to go to North or South Dakota instead of all the hassle. Comments!!"
5643745,btyreprich,2017-07-03 10:08:00,1067,"The Canadian government is sending a message that they take DUI offenses seriously and have a zero tolerance on this policy. Will it keep some people out of the country - yes of course.But to the Canadian government it's worth it.I make it a point to not drive if I've had more than 2 beers.Policemen I know tell me that a DUI - even if it's your first offense and there was no damage or injuries- might cost you close to $5,000.That alone is enough reason for me.Like previous posters have said, it's Canada's decision no as guests in their country, we have to abid by their decision.Wish the USA was as restrictive as to who they let in!"
5643833,Ver88,2017-07-03 10:35:00,114,"I think the Canadian government is right with this one. I wish the US government would have much more severe penalties for dui. It is a serious crime and should be treated as such. People often refer to old dui's as a ""mistake"" they made in the past. It is not a mistake, it is a crime that someone chose to commit and it could result in death or injury to others. I choose not to drink and drive and I have no sympathy for those that do."
5643849,martinbns,2017-07-03 10:50:00,1520,"It's a criminal offense that has evolved over the years from one that was essentially traffic based to be Criminal.We have enough idiots that we can't get rid of who have DUI's on their record we don't need more of them up here on vacation. Stats show a huge percentage of those convicted of DUI keep doing it, a 1995 US study was 33%, varied by state but Minnesota was one of the highest at 46%. A 2011 Canadian study showed an 18% repeat rate.I am of the opinion that it should extend more, personally anyone with a Criminal record or a Fish & Game violation either here or in the US shouldn't be allowed in.Years ago we crossed over from Brockville On, to Ogdensburg NY. the driver of the boat called in. We were playing pool when two Border Guards showed up at the bar to question him. When he was a teenager, he had been pulled over with three friends in his car and the cops found a joint. They couldn't determine who's it was so Bob got charged with simple possession. He can't enter the US. Your friends DUI is way more harmful potentially than the single joint found in the back seat of a 16 years car.The impact of not letting previous drunk drivers into Canada on our overall Tourism economy is so small it wouldn't be a factor at all."
5643921,U D,2017-07-03 11:09:00,249,"Their country. Their laws. That simple. Like it or not. I don't think they care what others think. Nor should they. Alcohol consumption causes poor decisions and can lead to terrible ""accidents"". Why even bother?"
5643953,Obabikon,2017-07-03 11:51:00,2370,"Just so everyone understands... the law wasn't established to keep out tourism. That is a side effect. 1. Felons are not allowed in the country. It has been true both ways for a long time. International travel is one of many ways felons are punished for their transactions. 2. Canada has two classes of ""impaired driving"". A. Summary conviction - would classify as a misdemeanor in the US B. Indictment - this is a full on felony. Prosecutors, depending on the blood alcohol content, criminal record, and other circumstances can determine which charge they want to pursue. This is not true in the US. There is no room for judgement. If the US went to a law that had two different classifications... one being a felony and one being a misdemeanor, Canada could incorporate it. However, as it is... all DUI's are felonies. Felons have travel restrictions in most countries. There should be more ways around it. Surrendering your license, ensuring the the felon does not drive while visiting. Make the penalties stiff if you break the law. BUT... do keep in mind this is slowly being addressed. If you have had 1 DUI... the odds are VERY high that you can get into Canada."

5644033,kzoofisher,2017-07-03 12:37:00,5144,"I would guess that most Americans entering Canada aren't going fishing. Many from the Detroit Metro area drive to Windsor for fun and that fun usually involves a lot of alcohol and hopefully a designated driver. I'm sure the same is true all along the border. And as Martin pointed out, repeat offenses for drunk drivers are quite common. I doubt that someone who is willing to drive drunk is going to choose not to because he promised a border guard he wouldn't. So the bad apples ruin it for everyone. Isn't that the way it always is?"
5644329,Huntindave,2017-07-03 16:32:00,2194,"Good observation; we as fisherman who cross the border once or twice a year, are a small minority."

Let's hope you never make a simple mistake as then you would have to abide by your wishes!"
