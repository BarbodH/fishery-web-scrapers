Onepine is one of Dave and Michelle's outposts, and I have the opportunity to fish it next June. I would really appreciate any/all info. on the lake in general, and any fishing reports. Thanks a million in advance to anyone who can share general info. on this lake!! I will be doing more specific searches later this year, but, like I said, any general info. would be much appreciated."
