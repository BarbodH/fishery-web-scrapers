5643473,MoWalleyeguy,2017-07-03 06:42:00,409,"Several years ago while crossing (FF) we got picked for a random search so we were at the border close to an hour and I witnessed 2 people get turned back. Both ended up getting left by there groups to find there way back home and the groups headed north. Canada looks at some offenses that happen in the USA as a lot more serious in their country... some misdemeanors here are considered felonies in Canada and you won't be crossing if they see anything felony related. Just be prepare if you or someone in your group has ""issues"". When I take people up I warn them that if they have any problems crossing then they will be on there own getting back home. Deposits were paid and time off work is few so its just how it is!"
5618674,mickr,2017-06-19 12:03:00,74,try that the other way around and you'll be banned for life from entering the USof course they know....there are these things called computers...that are connected to networks that are connected to databases
5618722,walleye22,2017-06-19 12:14:00,59,it will be up to the person doing the questions at the border. as i stated earlier....my buddy always got in and had an assault charge from like 20 years ago...was in toronto for a week..got in with no problems...2 months later was turned away at FF. You just never know.
5618818,bowtech840,2017-06-19 12:54:00,111,"What??? Sure you can say ""your country your rules"". LolI've never had a problem getting into Canada. I had a **** of a time getting back into the U.S. once. Does that count? I'm glad it's just as difficult to get into the states with a DUI. Seems fair to me. Hopefully the states don't have such a grey area for the topic in question."
5618842,LOW1,2017-06-19 13:14:00,2828,If it was just one DUI that long ago I'd say his chances were really good. But two? That puts a different wrinkle on it.
5638857,reconssd,2017-06-29 17:30:00,147,"My nephew has begun the process of getting all the necessary documentation to submit to the Canadian government. Review and approval/denial can take as long as 1 year. I will provide an update both when he submits his packet for review, and when a decision has been rendered."
5639305,fisher_i_am,2017-06-30 03:54:00,498,Are there the same restrictions if one is flying into Canada? Hard to believe there would be .... If not why is there such a difference.
5639353,Skyraptor,2017-06-30 04:43:00,291,"Our group has a person that is in the same boat. 2 years ago he had a misdemeanor from an entry into a locked coin box. It is not a DWI or any serious crime. The amount was under $250. We want to plan a trip in 2018 but are not sure if he will be turned around at the border. If he is then our whole group will have to turn around. Since it is under the 5 year period we are not sure how the border agent will look at it. This is the only thing on his record. He is not sure what to do, does he risk it or just not go?"
5639377,Obabikon,2017-06-30 05:45:00,2370,"If it isn't a felony, he should be good to go. You can always call the immigration office where you're crossing and ask though."
5639385,The tank,2017-06-30 05:59:00,340,I wouldn't worry about it if it's only a misdemeanor but like Jared said call and talk to the immigration office where your crossing. You shouldn't have any problems.
5642977,triggerx,2017-07-02 12:36:00,1,"Why don't they just say that a person with a DUI can't drive a car or boat in Canada. They are driving away a lot of tourism. If one person in a group can't cross, the whole group will maybe stay home. In Wisconsin fishermen have chosen to go to North or South Dakota instead."
5615529,rickn,2017-06-17 12:02:00,993,"When looking at the time since last conviction, it starts at the end of the sentence, ie,when probation ended. My sil is going through this. He recently flew from Madison Wi, to a lodge on the eagle river. He didn't have any problem. He's been dry for 14 yrs.We're leaving in a week for Clearwater lake, meeting him at baudette. I hope he can cross!"
5615665,walleye22,2017-06-17 14:19:00,59,"that is another issue...the border people pick and choose when they want to enforce these laws. he had 2 dui's with nothing attached to them. he did paper work, money, all the above and they wouldnt let him in. he hasnt tried in about 5 years though now so maybe they are more relaxed now. However, another guy that use to go with us had an assualt from like 20 years ago...he went to canada fishing 2 times a year for many many years with it...one year...they decided to not let him in because of it...dont know why, 2 months before that he was in toronto with no problems, try t cross at FF...nope....wouldnt let him. we are also overly polite at the border...dialed in and ready to answer all questions. We also never bring anything with us..we buy all food and beer up there. Seems they pick and choose when they want to enforce the ""rules"""
5616337,Obabikon,2017-06-18 07:17:00,2370,"When the Patriot Act went into affect... the Canadians got a ton of extra information about your criminal past. With an assault charge/conviction, he is inadmissible. However, they didn't have the entire criminal record readily at hand. That changed in the mid/late 2000's. Same time as the US started demanding passports."
5616449,kzoofisher,2017-06-18 08:28:00,5144,"If I see a guy who got dui's more than a decade apart I'm wondering how many times in between he should have and didn't. Cold be the same thought process for the BP. The kid who got two quick and has been clean since can hopefully prove he's clean. I've never gotten one but if I had I would get the records of the random drug tests I've had to do for the last fifteen years and take them with me to show I'm clean. Bottom line? You have to pay for your mistakes. Lots of folks carry records for minor crap they did when they were young. At my kids school anyone who gets in a fight goes for a juvenile intake and can end up with a record. No judgement call by the administration, just a zero tolerance policy. At least the BP has some room for judgment. If the worst thing that happens after you drive drunk often enough to get two dui's is not fishing, consider yourself lucky."
5616673,bowtech840,2017-06-18 10:59:00,111,"From my experience and others in our group if it's been that long ago I don't think it should be a problem as long as you don't get the superman border agent. Numerous ppl in our group throughout the years have gotten thru with DUIs, serious assault causing bodily injury, ect... No problems as long as it's been at least five years since the conviction. Kind of sucks tho that it's basically at the officers discretion. You just never know. If I ever got denied I would give up going. Plenty of good fishing in the U.S.. Still blows my mind that they are so strict on drinking in Canada but there's drunk natives walking around town all hours of the day. Their country, their rules.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5616681,Obabikon,2017-06-18 11:12:00,2370,"They aren't strict on drinking... they're strict on drinking and driving. A man stumbling down a sidewalk is only going to hurt himself if he passes out. In my opinion, the US was behind the curve on cracking down on drinking and driving. Canada might be a little extreme, but they're trying."
5616753,Fisher-man,2017-06-18 12:54:00,422,"In my experience the Fort Frances crossing is the most difficult to deal with. They tune away more Americans than the crossing by Windsor which has about ten time the traffic. I may not have the numbers right, but it is an extreme difference in those turned away compared to the number of people dealt with. It seems to me that whole office has a chip on their shoulder."
5616913,DaBirdman,2017-06-18 15:33:00,164,"Curious....has anybody ever been denied at FF, then went west down the highway and got let thru at Baudette?"
5617073,CI_Guy,2017-06-18 17:11:00,2118,"My nephew was refused entry at Grand Portage, drove to FF to cross and the computer system knew he had been turned away at Grand Portage."
5618666,mickr,2017-06-19 12:02:00,74,"What an uninformed statement. Your American.....so I gather you do not understand what it is like attempting to enter the US if you are not an American citizen. Just to be clear, the US border has been far stricter for non Americans crossing it and has been for years. At least 30 that I know of. A DUI is a criminal charge...one cannot enter the US with such a charge on your record. That's simply the way it works. So can I say your country your rules?"
5614561,reconssd,2017-06-16 19:17:00,147,"Hi Everyone - I have a question for those of you who have had to go through the process of receiving Granted Rehabilitation from the Canadian Government. I'm planning a trip with my nephew, which will be his first into Canada. With being young at the time, he made a couple mistakes and got back to back DUI's in 2006. No problems or issues since 2006. Next year (2018) is when we are planning our trip to Canada. It will be twelve (12) years since his conviction. We have the time to get all the necessary paperwork in order to get everything processed, and hopefully approved. If you have gone through this process, I would really like to hear from you. What was your experience like, any recommendations, etc? Thanks in advance for your replies. Tight lines and have great times on the water this year."
5614673,The tank,2017-06-16 20:53:00,340,So he has 2 dui''s on his record?
5614881,reconssd,2017-06-17 05:39:00,147,correct
5614937,BornToFish,2017-06-17 06:09:00,1224,"Greetings,Your desire to take your nephew to Canada is noble. It happens.I will offer some suggestions. But be forewarned, there is no guarantee of a successful outcome. It will likely take time and likely cost some money.You might get the process started by chatting with the Canada Border Service Agency via the internet (http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-engl.html) or the likely port of entry (e.g. Fort Frances, Ontario 807-274-3655 and ask for Immigration). Another option is to contact the Canada Consulate in Minneapolis, MN (612-332-7486). Yet another option is to contact your prospective lodge owner.Discussion with these sources of information should establish the facts of your nephew's unique situation and what options might exist. At the end of the day, it might come down to the Border Services Officer when you and your nephew arrive at the border crossing. Be sure that your nephew is presentable and having a very good day.There are attorneys in Canada that specialize in handling applications for rehabilitation. I would start with one or more of the options above before I would hire an attorney, as the options listed above cost your nephew time. Hiring the attorney will cost money and may not enhance his chances of being granted rehabilitation.I wish you and your nephew the best. Regards....."
5614953,Obabikon,2017-06-17 06:11:00,2370,Here is a consultant who can help answer any questions. He would be the first person I called.[email protected]phone: (204)488-6350website: www.bordercrossing.ca
5614985,The tank,2017-06-17 06:29:00,340,Let us know (if you would) what they have for advice. I've got kind of the same situation. Never tried to bring him cause of having two on his record.
5615017,Guest,2017-06-17 06:38:00,0,"Couple friends did the same thing when they were young, amazingly money fixed it."
5615209,reconssd,2017-06-17 08:39:00,147,Thanks for the information. There's no doubt that money will need to be spent and the appropriate documentation will need to be provided to the Canadian government. I've told my nephew that it will be worth it because there is nothing like fishing in Canada.
5615313,walleye22,2017-06-17 09:25:00,59,"his chances off getting are slim to none in my opinion. My buddy who was going up with us for 20 years...got a dui in 1991 and then a second in 2005.....they have never let him back in. he just stopped trying. he went through all the paper work, paid money...nope....they told he will never get back in the last time we tried."
5615473,Obabikon,2017-06-17 11:17:00,2370,"I have several guests with multiple DUI's that have been deemed admissible. Many of the rules were relaxed about 3 years ago. That said... if there is anything attached to the DUI's (fleeing the scene, resisting arrest, assault, etc.) or any other incident, especially if one could be viewed as violent (bar fights), it will be difficult."
