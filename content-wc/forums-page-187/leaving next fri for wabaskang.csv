5640089,Rayiii,2017-06-30 13:43:00,40,I'm leaving for wabaskang next fri. I have never been there before. I'm staying at grawleys parkview camp across from parralt lake. can anyone give me and my daughter a direction to start. We are after walleye and perch. I know this is a large lake but i'm not afraid to cover some water to find a good bite. Is the fishing mainly a jig and minnow bite or more of pulling spinners and crawlers bite. Thanks for any info I will post when I return You can PM me if you wish Thanks
