5638329,fsz,2017-06-29 11:46:00,144,Looking for any reports from the last 5 years. Thinking about trying it for smallmouth. We would be camping and not getting a cabin. Tried the search function everything on this lake is pretty dated. PM if you feel more comfortable with that. Info is sparse so even if your info is second hand thats OK. Thanks

We caught hundreds in the 4 lbs range. We were also there in early June and they were still on their nests, every 10 feet you could see another big fish guarding the nest as the water was very clear, this went on for hundreds of yards of shoreline. We caught a bit of everything but not many Pike of good size which was our primary target. Not sure what the latest reports are like."

5641081,East coast,2017-07-01 10:04:00,32,"We were there just post spawn so the usual spinner baits were not as affective as they normally are but we still caught a few on spinners. Jigs and grubs were the ticket for us. This time of year you should clean up with spinnerbaits (pike like em too). With clear water search out the rocky shores with smaller size rocks. The back bays with weeds/logs seemed to hold more pike than bass. That's my recollection anyway from almost 10 years ago. Try googling Bob Izumi and Beachene, an iconic Canadian fishing TV host, he had a number of shows from Beauchene and their famous smallies. Good luck and enjoy!"

I agree with East coast that the smallmouth fishing is very strong. It is all catch and release on smallies. There are plenty of excellent places to locate fish and one of my better places was in and around the channel between the two ends. Use the online Navionics app to scout out the lake before you leave. You can catch them on almost any good smallie lure (no live bait allowed). I used small spinner baits and rigged weedless 5"" finesse worms. Will you have access to go into any of the satellite lakes? There are a few with so many smallmouth that it is hard to cast out without catching another a little smallmouth. One of the most successful anglers I met there is Lonnie King and he swears by fishing at night for big smallies in the coves near the lodge. One of the coolest unique features I used to run into on Beauchene was schooling smallies chasing bait to the surface. It could happen anywhere anytime of day and I used to be within casting distance three or four times a day. Keep something rigged and ready that is small and heavy like a 2 inch Hopkins spoon so you can grab it and fire it out to the swirls. I caught some good smallmouth and walleye that way."

My schedule will only permit one day trip, we are staying at another lake in the area (family camp) this would be a side trip. If we like it we might make it an annual part of our trip or add on a few days and camp there We have success with tube jigs on the great lakes, we plan on trolling to locate fish then using tube jigs or round head jigs with power bait grubs. Thanks for the tip on bait chasing fish. I have an arsenal of little cleos that will work for that."
