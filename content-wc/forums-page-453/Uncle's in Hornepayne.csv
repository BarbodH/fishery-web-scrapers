I was there July of 2011 and the cabins were very nice with a good hot shower and comodes. The restaurant opened at 6:00Am and served a great breakfeast, we also had supper there and that was good. We have reserved 3 cabins for July 2012. I suggust you either call or email for reservations since there are only 5 cabins and they fill up quickly. There are 2 airbases (depending on which lodge you are going too) at the end of Government road about a 15 minute drive from Uncle's, if you overnight in White River add at least another hour to the drive time. Hope this info helps, Seanik"
