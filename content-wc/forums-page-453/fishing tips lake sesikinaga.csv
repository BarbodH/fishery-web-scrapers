As you are unloading and helping the party leaving camp to load their gear, find their honcho and grill him for information. Usually, they are happy to share what worked for them, where they fished on the lake, what colors were hot. Find out what the lake leval is compared to normal. Any lake hazards that you need to be aware of.As you are milking this guy for info., make sure the camp is fully funtional. If there is anything out of place now is the time to address it while the bush pilot is in camp. Don't forget to tip the bush pilot at this point as it may not be the same pilot who brings you out.I don't have much experience of Sept. fishing and have never been on Sessi, but I would guess that you would find em in about 25-35 fow. On that lake, a gps is a must with all those islands. Bring debthfinder, crawlers/leaches. If this is your first trip with ""Northern Wilderness Outfitters"", you will be amazed at the service. Vic Davis is like family to me and my group. The pilots are top notch and have been with NWO for many many years. I would recommend getting a sat. phone from the airbase, 100$ deposit.Good luck and please post on your trip as this board does not have much on Sessi."
