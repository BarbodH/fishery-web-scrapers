1385722,Hawker,2012-01-25 05:31:00,3967,"Gotta give Young's Wilderness Camp a resounding ""check them out""! They have two very very nice housekeeping cabins. One will sleep up to 6, the other 8 and both cabins are virtually brand new! We are always there at the end of May, first of June and almost always at least one is in use for housekeeping! Excellent boats, excellent separate big dock for housekeeping, excellent fishing!!"

1385456,Steve Ediger,2012-01-24 11:14:00,97,"You might give Lac Seul Lodge a look. The cabins are very nice. Good boats and motors and very good fishing within sight of the lodge or you can go exploring for miles and miles. The lodge is close to Ear Falls if you need groceries, beer, bait, or feel like going out to dinner. I have been going for over ten years and can't wait til June gets here so I can go again. We started going when my son was four years old. He will start college next Fall so who knows what his schedule will allow in the future but we are going up at least twice this summer. I think you would enjoy the experience."
1385484,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-24 12:11:00,1460,We don't wanna forget Obabikon - http://www.obabikon.com/ or maybe he's booked up.
1385491,wallydave,2012-01-24 12:17:00,2151,"try www.lacseul.comAndrea has smaller cabins, and boat-upgrades available. Ear Falls is just a few miles away if you need some shopping. Better hurry, this time of year things can fill up fast!"
