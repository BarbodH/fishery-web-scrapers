Cabela's expects to open the Saskatoon store in spring of 2012. The 50,000-square-foot store will be located in the Preston Crossing shopping area at the intersection of Circle Drive and Preston Avenue in northeast Saskatoon, near the University of Saskatchewan main campus. This will be the third Cabela's store in Canada, joining locations in Winnipeg, Manitoba, a former S.I.R. Warehouse Sports Store acquired and converted in 2008, and Edmonton, Alberta, which opened August 4th 2011."

1388384,mrwalleye5,2012-02-01 09:17:00,1922,"Math skills excellent, geography skills,well, not so good, LOL... Winnipeg resides in the the province of Manitoba, Saskatoon in Saskatchewan and Edmonton in Alberta. ...and yes it is good news for Canada. I'm 20 miles from the Winnipeg Cabelas and shop it regularly."
1388389,Pezman38,2012-02-01 09:33:00,3196,LOL That is what I get for not google mapping each place first.

1388539,Highplainsfisher,2012-02-01 15:36:00,5,Hopefully this Cabela's is better than the one in Winnipeg for customer service and selection.
1388586,mrwalleye5,2012-02-01 17:53:00,1922,It's steadily getting better.
