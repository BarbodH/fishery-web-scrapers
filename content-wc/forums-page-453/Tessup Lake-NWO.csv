1389120,Guest,2012-02-02 21:31:00,0,Looking for some fishing information on Tessup Lake maintained by Northern Wilderness Outfitters. Fishing spots for walleyes and northerns. How were the cabins? Looking at a trip in June with son.

From my understanding, the fishing there is relatively easy with nice numbers with pretty good size to them. Going in June will be spectacular fishing, you will not have any trouble finding them. If it were me, I would start at the creek that leads to Peninsula Lake and fish both sides looking for water debths between 8' and 15'. Fish the eddy breaks, pitching jigs with twister tails or the like. I realize this isn't much, but hey, thats part of the fun going to a new lake.As far as the cabins go, NWO has high quality outpost camps with the finest pilots anywhere. The service is tremendous and Vic and his crew will do everything in their power to ensure you and your son have a successful trip.Are you staying in the north or south cabin? How old is your boy? What day do you fly out of Ft Francis? We sure would like to hear how your trip turns out as their is not much on this lake on this board."
