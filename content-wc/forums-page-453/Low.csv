We have never been to LOW and any info on the two lodges would be greatly appreciated.... proximity to fishing spots, pros vs cons of the lodges, and any other useful info...Thanks"
1387594,wallydave,2012-01-30 07:19:00,2151,"You will find that quite a few WC members fish LOW. Try the search function at the top of the page, that will help you in finding the feedback you are looking for! Have a good trip and let us know how the fishing was!"
1387600,Ia Walihntr,2012-01-30 07:35:00,320,"Madison, Have not stayed at either resort but have fished both areas and been to both resorts and know people who have been to both. The fishing in both areas are top notch and are both are in multispiecies areas. (no Lakers without going through the portage to Whitfish Bay) The resorts are clean and well kept and are both operated by very capeable and sucessfull owners. The grounds of both are well maintained and both have top notch equiptment for rentals. Obabikon is American Plan and Youngs is American and Housekeeping Plans. Would recomend both without hesitation. You couldn't go wrong with either choice. Marv"
1387780,PJM,2012-01-30 16:17:00,3516,Madison88 I am more familiar with the Obabikon resort and its location because in the fall you can crappie fish in the Obabikon Lake and also fish pike and muskies . The resort is nicely located between a lot of great fishing areas of the lake and is sheltered from the wind. Fall fishing on Lake of the Wood is great no matter what resort you go.
1387908,Hawker,2012-01-30 20:41:00,3967,"Cannot speak for Obabikon as I've never stayed there, but I've heard nothing but good about them! My wife & I have been going to Young's for the past 20 years straight because we have not ever been disappointed with any aspect. Fishing in either area and ""everywhere"" in between the two is nothing short of fabulous so I don't think you'd go wrong with either choice!! Your going to love fishing LOTW, especially that area!!"
1387991,madison88,2012-01-31 07:43:00,9,Thanks for everyones input....Obabikon it will be.
1388074,Guest,2012-01-31 10:31:00,0,Madison88 If you like crappie fishing they are in the midle of all the action. I have never stayed at ob camp but I have driven past many times and it's a really cool sight. Pretty hard to miss. As mentioned the fishing for all species is good in the area. just remeber to look for areas with current in the fall. The walleyes should be moving into those areas in sept. Have fun on your trip and make sure you post pics for us in oct. JT
