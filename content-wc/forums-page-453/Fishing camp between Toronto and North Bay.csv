1388915,Guest,2012-02-02 13:02:00,0,"Looking for a productive pickerel lake between Toronto and North Bay. I have been fishing in Quebec east of Mattawa for years and am looking for a cabin for the last week in July that is less of a drive. Planning on bringing my own rig so it needs to be a drive in site. My lady and I prefer something that is not busy with boats==prefer the solitude and the peacefulness of Canada. Simcoe and Nippising are not what I'm looking for--too much water and too public. I have been fishing the ""brown waters "" for years and do find fish--just looking for a new spot to want to return too. Have looked at Deluxe Camp on Nippising and like what they have to offer--just not sure of the ""huge"" lake is what I'm looking for. Please send me some ideas and links. I live in Ohio so it is 4 hours to the border to get to Canada and driving 14hrs is not my idea of a way to start a vacation--03 back surgery seems to limit the driving time if you know what I mean. I may even be interested in Michigan fishing for the eyes but always favored Canada Respectfully, Walleyedave"

Probably the most secluded area I've experience south of North Bay is on the French River in the provincial park. I've only been there in the fall though, so maybe it's busier in the summer months. I also don't have a clue how the walleye fishing is as I target pike/musky when I go.There are many places on both the Upper and Lower French river you can look into. The camps located on islands within the park are probably the most ideal."
1389048,Mike Borger,2012-02-02 17:37:00,1554,"IMO the best camp south of either Sudbury or North Bay is Georgian Bay Fishing Camp, although it is almost all the way to Sudbury. Follow the Key River down to Georgian Bay then across the bay to the camp. They'll guide you from the landing to the lodge, the area is an absolute maze of islands and shoals. Outstanding multi species fishing including a good crack at trophy fish. Beautiful remote setting as well.http://www.georgianbayfishing.com/"
1389110,ohiojmj,2012-02-02 20:08:00,1262,"You might also consider Key Harbour Lodge at mouth of Key River at georgian Bay. It's modestly priced with plenty of bays and water with no one around. Nice camp owner. You take 69 along G Bay and launch boat for 7 mile easy trip to the lodge. From there you have plenty of beautiful water to explore long bays and around 1000's of islands so that you don't feel like being on the great lakes. Lotsa walleye,chance for big pike, smallie's too. Another option is Red Cedar Lake about 1/2 hour or so above Northbay. check it out. I've been to a couple camps there if interested. There are some camps, but plenty of bays to yourself. Decent pike/walleye."
1389153,doubleheader,2012-02-03 05:55:00,2652,"Have you fished the west arm of Nipissing? Considerably smaller water, fewer boats, some real nice water, and decent fishing- depending on the year it can be outstanding. PM me if interested in a lodging recommendation or more info. We've been going that direction for 50 years."
1389323,FrankLeigh,2012-02-03 11:41:00,80,"Hey, SoloWe used to fish that area until about eight years ago, or so. Have you been there more recently? I checked the camp's website and it does not seem to have been updated for a couple of years."
1389362,Mike Borger,2012-02-03 12:59:00,1554,"When I say it's the best camp that's based on having fished the area for years. I've never actually stayed at the camp. We launch at Hartley Bay and run down the western channel of the French into the delta area (Bad River) and camp. I've toured over in that direction many times. Phenominal fishing pretty much everywhere. My take on the camp from what I've seen is it's pretty rustic and purely a fishing camp. Off the top of my head I've done that trip at least a couple dozen times over the years, most recently 3 seasons ago. Have no reason to think anything's changed."
1389995,515,2012-02-05 06:51:00,254,We used Georgian Bay Camps a few years back and theres a huge amount of water and some amazing fishing there. The camps nothing fancy but we had dry cabins and great meals.
