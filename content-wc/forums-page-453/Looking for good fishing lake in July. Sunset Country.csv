They are on Eagle lake which is a big lake but has plenty of sheltered areas to fish out of the weather if need be. The lodge is about 150 miles from International Falls. They also have a grill your own steak house at the lodge so you can take your wife for a nice dinner if you like."
1388963,MikeMcC,2012-02-02 15:15:00,72,Take a look at Press Lake. Never been their but have heard good things about it.
1388984,Guest,2012-02-02 15:42:00,0,"I'd check out Discovery Lake. You can stay at the main camp (two BEAUTIFUL cabins), or stay at his Dominion or Zarn outpost for the same price. Bring your own food and drinks, everything else is provided. You'll have no problem catching fish."
1389315,Steve Ediger,2012-02-03 11:13:00,97,"Lac Seul Lodge would be an option I think you would enjoy. My wife and I have been going every year for the last 12 - 13 years and love it. Nice cabins, boats, and plenty of protected areas to fish if the wind happens to come up. Good fishing for walleye, pike, and smallies."
