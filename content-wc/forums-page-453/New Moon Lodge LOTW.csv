By my scale, I believe they are a 4 to 5 star operation, plus located in some premier fishing waters. The camp has been very well maintained over the years, & their ""American Plan"" package is exceptional. If you do have your own boat, they have in the past charged a docking fee per day. I'm not a big fan of that charge! Otherwise, it is a resort on an Island that deserves your consideration. Set the hook, CRJohn"
