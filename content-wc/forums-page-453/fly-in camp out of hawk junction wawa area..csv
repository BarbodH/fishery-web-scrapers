516598,Guest,2002-01-27 01:54:00,0,"I don't have a specific camp to recommend in that area but I do receive many pieces of mail from outfitters that fly out of Wawa and Hawk's (Hawk Air etc). I have noticed that many of the camps give the lake sizes in acres as opposed to miles or kilometers and are very small. Depending on how long you stay this will probably be an issue. I'm sure there are some good sized lakes there somewhere but the last flier I rec'd didn't have a lake on it over 1400 acres.Don't know where you are coming from but there was a post recently that I checked into a little and it was out of Sudbury, which isn't too much further - looked good. Others to look at that are not too far are Armstrong, Nakina, and Chapleau.We opt to drive ""a bit further"" as Sean stated. But be aware that ""a bit"" further to Red Lake from Wawa is a BIG bit - but we don't mind. We fished at Waynorth last year and the fishing was very good but it's a 20 hr drive from mid-michigan - FYI.lobo"
516599,outdoor fanatic,2002-01-27 09:14:00,90,"I use the hawk junction to fly into Lake Kabinakigami which is a lake about 25 miles long and is comprised of 30,000 acres. I've never used a guide and have had success every season. The place that I use is www.eversonslodge.com. I do know that there are 2 other lodges on the lake that provide a guide service but not sure what there name is. I am by no means a veteran, but even in my unlearned ways, I am able to boat numerous walleye and pike on this lake. I do think that Everson's lodge is relatively unexpensive ($615 US plus tax) for a week and I always leave the camp happy with the whole experience. Any more questions, you can e-mail me at [email protected]."
516600,Guest,2002-01-27 11:43:00,0,"There are two fly in outfitters out of Hawk Junction. One is Hawk Air, the other is Air-Dale. I can't speak for Hawk Air, but my kid brother is a dock boy for Air-Dale. Judging from the tips he gets, I'd have to say the guests are very happy. They have 3 or 4 planes, so there are a great deal of lakes they cover, depending on the species. I can't tell you much more than that, but I can't get info if your interested.[email protected]"

Tell them Tom from North Carolina sent you. Opt for Ribes Lake Incredible walleye and pike fishing. Best I have ever done and always my first choice. Questions, just ask[email protected]"
