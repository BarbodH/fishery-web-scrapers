1387247,BennieS,2012-01-28 22:59:00,108,Can anyone tell me if they've stayed here and comment on the fishing on Jackfish Lake. Can you get through to Perrault lake through the stream that appears to connect the two?
1388337,Kevin R,2012-02-01 04:42:00,305,Never fished it because the creek is not passable by boat from Perrault lake. The creek is loaded with rocks & it is shallow rapids.
1389847,KSauers,2012-02-04 17:07:00,385,I stayed there many many years ago. The lake itself wasn't much but the owner had boats on many nearby lakes and we did very well on some of those for walleyes and northerns. One lake i remember had a big reef in the middle of it that was loaded with walleyes . Another lake had weed beds that were crawling with northerns but nothing huge.
