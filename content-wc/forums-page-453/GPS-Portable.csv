1385464,Magician Fishin,2012-01-24 11:39:00,2,"Looking for some feedback on GPS units that are relatively inexpensive. I am going to a Lake I am quite familiar with and don't necessarily need all the bells and whistles. Simply need unit to show outline of lake and my approximate position. I understand there may be maps and such to be purchased and loaded for further details, but that is really not what I am looking for. For the record I am going to North Star Lodge on Clay lake in 122 days, but who's counting? Any suggestions on a very easy to use GPS?"
1385473,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-24 11:56:00,1460,I've got a Magellen. My brother has a Garmin. Get a Garmin. No question about it.
1386536,new hips,2012-01-27 06:02:00,498,"When I go to Canada, I bring my Garmin etrex H. Last year Bass Pro had them on sale for $79. It won't show lake details, but will get you back to the dock. It runs on 2 AA batteries which will last most of the week. It's a accurate unit with not a lot of extras to confuse you."
1386819,SinOrSwim,2012-01-27 17:53:00,1528,"I have a Humminbird 595C that I converted to portable. I have a Navionics chip but unless you are on a big lake like Lac Seul the number of lakes they have mapped electronically in Canada are minimal from my research. It does have an outline of the lake we go to but it doesn't really matter. I can still mark way points etc to get back to the exact spots I want. Also mark way points by the cabin so I can get back there as well. Our cabin is in a bay and there is a small area you can cut the corner on the way out but you have to stay in between some hidden rocks unless you go all the way around. I was able to mark a bunch of way points as I went through there slowly the first time and then was able to buzz through at full speed basically after that.I will say what I have isn't the best option for a fly in as the battery life is not that good. I did rig up a flexible solar panel that I connect to it and it works well. I will say having the fish finder/GPS combo is nice as it is right there and ready so if we hook into something that seemingly has size, it is very easy to reach down and press the way point button."
1386822,eyeslayin,2012-01-27 17:58:00,37,I'm using a Delorme PN40 right now with a navionics chip in it and it works great! Had a Garmin but had bad luck with it so I switched.
1386964,Seanik,2012-01-28 08:28:00,218,A question for those that have the Navronics Canada chip. Most combo units come with a USA base Map. Will the Navronics chip improve land definition better than the base map on remote lakes in Canada not electronically mapped by Navronics? Seanik

1387061,SinOrSwim,2012-01-28 11:38:00,1528,"I have the Navionics North chip as it includes the big lakes like Lac Seul in Canada. I don't remember the land areas being very detailed. Then, again since mine is in my fish finder I never really looked very closely."
1387117,fishinnut 3446,2012-01-28 14:01:00,638,"1st time going to Canada did not go to far from the lodge because I used their boats and had no idea where we were going,just about every island looked the same.Next year got me a handheld Lowrance ifinder h2o c,Oh my we have lake contours and I can go farther than Strawberry Island!(Eagle Lake)Now we take are own boat,LCX 111 & Hum.898 si di.Still use the ifinder for ice fishing and the wife just downloaded the Navionics to my smart phone,my want to check that out,for a $10 app. lots detail for some of the lakes I fish."
