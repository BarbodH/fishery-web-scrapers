He put them on a salteen cracker, under the broiler for too dang long and man did our camp ever stink"".One year we saw a kid catch a nice pike, 33 in, while fishing for walleye with Gummy worms!If you get hungry on the Lac, you can snack on your bait! Better stay away from snacking on the salted baits, since we can't have beer in the boat!"
1386026,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 18:14:00,1460,"I find Berkley powerbaits a bit chewy. I did get my nephews into a contest of swallowing live minnows though. Their dad was none too happy with me. What are uncles for, eh?"
1386030,SoulFulCry,2012-01-25 18:22:00,158,"trigger x n gulp alive grubs n minnows work fantastic with out live bait period, i also use the 3 n 4 inch minnows in both products also i use the sprays from gulp alive in the minnow n crawler form also the walleye spray in triggwer x these products work as well if not better than live bait n alot cheaper hope this helps have agreat canadian experience"
1386033,camp chef,2012-01-25 18:25:00,915,We have always used the large Shiners......but am tempted to try some of the others
1386074,djarz929,2012-01-25 20:00:00,40,"Have always used a twister tail tipped with 1/3 or 1/4 crawler. Caught as many or more than the guys with with minnows. Seems the color of tail sometimes is more important though, white, orange, chartruse, black, bring a good variety. Some springs they will just hit on the plain tail, but adding a ""piece of meat"" always helps. We bring up a flat but remember to have them in worm bedding, not dirt, as they'll nail you at the border with dirt."
1386175,Fishoil,2012-01-26 07:13:00,1277,"Last trip up I preserved my own minnows and they worked fine. It's been 5 months and the ones I have leftover in the refrigerator still look good. All I used was salt and borax, about a 3:1 ratio. I put a bunch of live minnows in a plastic bag, dumped in the salt/borax, and shook them up. I put the bag in the fridge for about 24 hours, then rinsed them off and put them in a container. I think the 2 most important things are to have as little moisture as possible left after you rinse them off and to use live minnows so that the mix gets inside them well. I kept them in a cooler until needed, then put a handful in a can with some water. They stayed on the jig good and the walleyes sure seemed to like them."
1386193,5richards,2012-01-26 07:53:00,131,"Pikeslayer -- here is an old post that I looked up by golden eagle -- I buy three pounds of large shiners. Drain them. Put them in a mixture of coarse salt, 20 Mule Team Borax and garlic powder. About 5 - 1 salt to Borax and just enough garlic powder to give the mixture some extra stink and flavor. Borax is a preservative. Separate the minnows so they touch salt instead of each other. Let them sit in a container for a few hours. Then spread them out on a towel outside in the sun. When they're dry, put about 5 dozen in a small ziploc bag with a zipper. Keep them in the freezer until you're ready to travel. I store mine in the freezer in camp and they aren't a bit messy. Yep, usually one minnow for one walleye. Have never tried live minnows in Canada, but I'm sure they'd be deadly. Have never needed live minnows. Last edited by Golden Eagle; 02-27-2009 at 04:14 AM. I did about 4 pounds of minnows - It was fun and real easy!!! We found that the minnows lasted for a couple of fish!"
1386199,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-26 08:07:00,1460,"Thanks man, I've never heard of this technique before. Very cool. I guess I'm one that likes to tinker with recipes. I wonder if anise extract with the combination of salt and borax and maybe granulated garlic would work. My homemade brine has the salt, garlic and anise. Walleyes love the black licorise. Hmmm"
1386241,81Saluki,2012-01-26 09:30:00,97,"One year we had a problem with over-night minnow mortality and switched to crawlers mid week and caught as many fish on the crawlers as we did on minnows. From then on, we've used jigs/tails/crawlers almost exclusively. Has saved us a BUNCH of money. The general setup is a jig/tail tipped with half a crawler. We'll change jig/tail colors until we find a good combo. If the bite is really bad, we'll buy some leeches before trying live minnows again.After reading the posts on preserved (Magic) minnows, I may buy some this spring and see if they provide an early edge (e.g. me with Magic minnows -vs- an unsuspecting Dad still using crawlers). :-) If it works, I'm sure we'll try the 5richards/pikslayer8 recipes for our late-season trip!"
1387382,515,2012-01-29 14:01:00,254,"Jigs, twisters and a worm tip pretty must all our group ever uses anymore. It's simple and always produces. We used to haul in tons of baits but always fond ourselves using the jigs so now it saves on weight and space on plane with smaller tackle boxes."
1385869,jambi,2012-01-25 12:41:00,504,The previous camp guests left a bag of Magic Products preserved emerald shiners. We tipped our twister tails w/ these baits and did great. I was out catching my buddy by 3 to 1 (he was twister tail only). Didn't take him long for him to start adding the preserved minnows. I'll be bringing a bag or two of these next year. They lasted all week and easy to carry around.
1385877,camp chef,2012-01-25 13:01:00,915,We have replaced live minnows with the Magic preserved minnows for the past 4 or 5 years. they do work great and they are so easy to take care of. They also stay on the hook longer. Kinda like minnow jerky.
1385898,NathanH,2012-01-25 13:32:00,697,Intresting to see that folks had luck with preserved minnows you dont hear many good things about them. I might need to check out the magic brand.
1385906,Mohleye,2012-01-25 13:46:00,368,"We use jig, twister and piece of crawler or a leech almost exclusively with great results. However our trips are summer, not spring. This has also worked well on spring trips, but I've also had spring trips where the water was still cold, and it was very difficult to catch fish without minnows. Gulp or other minnow alternatives may have worked if we had them to try, but there are times when nothing works like a jig and minnow."

Recipe?

1385955,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 15:42:00,1460,"I agree, I've been somewhat aloof about this subject, but with the price and hassle of live minnows, I'm open to change."
1385962,camp chef,2012-01-25 15:56:00,915,we probaly average 3 to 4 fish per minnow...sometimes more depending how they are biting
1385971,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 16:28:00,1460,"Looking at their products, do you use fat heads, shiners or lg or sm minnows. Do you have a preference, Camp Chef?"
1385982,Bigstorm,2012-01-25 16:55:00,799,"I always salt about 30doz fatheads and take them up, usually about 15doz per pound of salt, should fit in a 1qt size freezer bag. I freeze them ahead and use them with great success. I would say they work jsut as well as a live minnow but last 4 or 5 times longer on the hook"
1386017,wallydave,2012-01-25 17:53:00,2151,"I surf different websites, during the loonngg wait till June. Some camps, mostly fly-in, boat-ins do not recommend or allow live bait. Gulp and salted seem the way to go! What are the prices for salted baits? Our usual camp includes minnows, but some can be pretty pricey!"
1385799,NathanH,2012-01-25 10:22:00,697,Going to Canada this Spring and due to minnow cost wanted to have some other options to minnows. Does anyone use tails and then tip the hook with crawler? Wanting to know if folks have had any luck or failure with this.
1385806,bergsh,2012-01-25 10:40:00,183,"I have always had good luck with just using twister tails by themselves. I find I do need to keep a variety of different colors because you never know what they want that day. Last year orange was hot, the year before has chart. Never tried tipping them with a worm"
1385809,TIGHTLINER,2012-01-25 10:46:00,223,We have always taken worms with us however we never saw much of a change if we used them or just the tails by themselves. Chart white black have worked in the past.
1385816,Steve Ediger,2012-01-25 11:00:00,97,We do it all the time. A worm seems to last longer on the hook and isn't as easy for the perch to steal. I also think you get fewer pike strikes but can't prove it.
1385818,Jaskonie,2012-01-25 11:04:00,80,"We have had tremendous results with gulp minnows the past two trips. Usually 3"" smelt on a 1/4 or 1/8 oz jig rigged in tradional fashion. Sometimes I will switch up and use a twister and tip the jig with a 2.5 inch gulp minnow hooked through the eyes only. I use one pack of 2.5 inch and 2 or 3 packs of 3"" in a week depending on the bite. As far as crawlers I use 3/4 or all the crawler without a twister. Only when anchored and I drag it slowly across the bottom. My son fishes the crawler under the boat on a jig and catches more than all of us."
1385827,cuamb,2012-01-25 11:29:00,203,We use the twister tails with a 1/3 of a crawler. Works great. Some guys wanted minnows last year but they did no better than anyone else. We are on Lac Suel so I can't say how they work on other lakes. We buy flats of crawlers and bring them with. Keep them cool and they last a long time.
1385829,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 11:32:00,1460,X2 and I also tip twisters with leaches.
1385832,HeHooksHimself,2012-01-25 11:33:00,725,"I usually use twister tails when the minnows run out. white or chartreuse work well. However, Walleye assassins work almost as good as minnows. When I use crawlers i usually use them directly on the jig head. We went to a flyin once (McKinley Lake with Thunderhook) where crawlers were required. We bought a flat and the last day, we caught 3-4 walleye for each crawler using bits and pieces. Minnows are the natural bait for fish so it is hard to beat what fish feed on naturally. I usually dip them in beer. Wait, that was a joke, we never have beer in the boat."
1385841,tsquared,2012-01-25 11:43:00,57,"Jig, with twister tail. If slow, add a little meat (1/3 nightcrawler) and they are deadly. We go in August and this seems to outperform minnows for us. We refuse to bring minnows any more."
