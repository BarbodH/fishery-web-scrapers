1387656,Guest,2012-01-30 10:18:00,0,How is the fishing that time of year- I know alot depends on ice out and weather just looking for a general idea and how far you have to travel. I searched already but most of the reports were for late June and July. Thanks in advance

If you're lucky, you can also catch the crappie spawn... not sure about the crappie fishing around Witch Bay, but I'd guess you can find some. Depending on the spring weather/temp, you can troll shorelines and beaches or be jigging. Muskies are closed Small Mouth are limited Northern fishing is very good"

Success will be heavily dependent on weather progression. As you might expect, the weather is extremely variable that time of year. It can be spectacular but you wont miss anything by waiting a bit either."

We are talking 100 fish days within Witch Bay itself.If you time the weather wrong, it will rank with the worst you ever had. I have had one trip of each plus an early June trip that was pretty good.July to the middle of August is more predictable and steady. That is when I go there. Great place!! Great owners! Great staff! I am on trips number 31 & 32 there this year."
