I was wondering if anyone has been or can give me some more information on these camps. I checked out their website FishBuckLake.com and it looks like a great place, their pricing seems awesome for a fly-in. Any information would be helpful."

We have been going there for the last 35 years. Last years group was 20 of us. It's a great experience from the time I fly to Michigan from California, the drive from Michigan to Hornpayne, to the flight in in on Buck Lake. If your looking for the fishing experience of a life time this is the one. You will build memories that will last a lifetime. I hope your able to make it happen and begin your Buck Lake annual tradition. Happy Fishing. The Happy Hooker"

That being said, I have not found a lot of information regarding the fishing and would be really interested to hear what people have to say. What sort of numbers would an average day of walleye fishing produce? Is it worth targeting perch? Successful patterns/colors/lures. Anyone catch any big pike etc. Thanks in advance."

When we stayed there it was one of the best perch fishing lakes I've ever been to. We would catch close to a hundred 13"" perch per boat in a day. It was weird, almost every one would be a monster 12"" - 13"". Bring a couple of ultralites and you will have a ball. Lots of walleye and pike mixed in also."

When we were fishing with six of us it wasn't unusual to catch and release upwards of 100 Walleye each for the week. Hard to believe but some years were closer to a couple hundred each during the week. Great Walleye fishing. If your having problems locating them don't be shy, the staff loves to see their guest catch fish. Just ask..."

I have been to many fishing camps but I have never seen more productive fishing and one of the best amenities are their flat bottom boats. You can fit 3 comfortably in a boat which also includes 3-4 enclosed storage spaces and a live well. Even with the bigger boat (which has a bigger motor) getting across the lake is quick. Definitely ask for advice where to fish and get a map, its a huge lake. We caught everything from Perch, Walleye, Pike, sizes and quantity were both great. Already planning this years trip. This will definitely be the start of a great new family tradition. So sit back, relax, and enjoy some great times."

In any case the lake is Obakamiga.I've been curious about their operation for a long time, it's definitely on my list of places to try.Actually inquired last year but even though their rates are great with 2 young kids it was just a bit out of my price range."
