We will be around Perrault Falls, so I assume that we'd go to Dryden for any emergency. Does anyone have any experience with dealing with healthcare in Canada while being a U.S citizen?"

1387533,Hammerhead Herb,2012-01-29 20:59:00,259,"If he is only covered by medicare, he won't be covered."
1387538,Golden Eagle,2012-01-29 21:21:00,2642,"Medicare Supplement F covers outside United States w/$500 deductible. $50,000 coverage. $50,000 should cover a fisherman until he can be moved back into the U.S.We can buy a lot of medical care for $500 in Canada. $50,000 would do much more unless the lines and waiting periods are too long."
1387579,Skywagon,2012-01-30 06:38:00,1106,"elkman 99,Before immigrating to Canada I had an incident while at our cottage and needed medical care. I slipped while mowing the steep grade down to the lake; my foot went under the mower and cut off part of two toes. An ambulance picked me up and I was transported the 25 miles to Dryden. I was put at the head of the line and two doctors worked on me right away. The doctors did an excellent job and that was echoed by the US plastic surgeon that did the follow up. The real kicker on this, was the hospital bill (including the ambulance), was in the $160.00 range, I could not believe it. I had a $5000 deductible health plan at that time, so did not turn the claim in.With that said, I want to go on record as saying, I do not promote free health care and believe it is a flawed system, but this is not the place for that discussion. The point I would like to get across is that most medical emergencies can be taken care of locally. This area has a small population and 100% of the health services that are taken for granted in the US are not available here, but the air ambulance is often utilized and is the great equalizer.Bottom line, have your uncle check into his insurance, if he needs care it is available. Hope he has a great trip."

1388141,3M TA3,2012-01-31 13:27:00,2846,Who said this guy had Medicare?
1388149,LOW1,2012-01-31 13:47:00,2828,I checked with my BCBS insurance and was told that the Kenora hospital had a provider number and would bill my insurance directly. I have never had to find out if this is the way it really works.
1388601,elkman99,2012-02-01 18:25:00,180,"I should have clarified, but he is on Medicare. He has taken out a ryder so that he is covered while out of the country. thanks for all the input."
