1386554,wallydave,2012-01-27 07:16:00,2151,"Fish, you must have has better luck that some members of our group dealing with our Border guards! A few of former members of our fishermen, no longer go to Canada because of the border hassles coming home, and those were before 9-11! To be honest, they like to argue with authority, always a good way to find trouble!!Our new group goes out of the way to keep a low profile at both borders, we just want to get to our camp, fish and return home when safely!"
1386584,Pooch,2012-01-27 08:09:00,4619,"If you're traveling in a pickup truck why not just buy a portable tank and be safe? (And maybe ""more legal""??)Portable gas cans when traveling scare the bejeebers out of me.Buddies brought extra boat fuel into camp two years ago and someone backed over a full can. Could have been very ugly and taught everyone a lesson.http://www.northerntool.com/shop/too...transfer-tanksPooch"
1387143,retire55,2012-01-28 15:10:00,1029,"We used to carry gas (6 X 5 gallon containers) for remote fishing trips in north western Quebec. We soon tired of the bother and made arrangements to have the outfitter deliver our gas requirements to our location. Sure we pay more per gallon, but it's safer and a lot less trouble. If you don't have access to an outfitter, perhaps a local would deliver and cache the gas for your group."
1387182,lenray,2012-01-28 17:27:00,467,no locals up there.
1387207,Further North,2012-01-28 19:18:00,2008,"Whatever you settle on...keep that gas as far from your main camp, boat and vehicles as you can.Fire is a nasty critter when you have no way to put it out...and you probably don't have any way to put out a fire in 100 gallons of gas...."
1387225,hommer23,2012-01-28 20:40:00,523,Look into the ATV gas cans. I carry 2 15 Gal tanks on my ATV when we go out west hunting. They fit on the front and rear racks about 3X2X1. you can tie them down easy and 2 guys can transfer the fuel into a storage area until needed. I think I paid about $60.00 each in 2005. If you are using to fuel your boats you will need to get a hand pump so you don't spill any fuel in the water or on the ground.
1387228,falkopat,2012-01-28 20:45:00,44,"my dad got some very nice fuel cans about 4 years ago from a estate sale. the guy had an air plane and hanger. The fuel cans are metal maybe 6 gallons but are tall and rectangle they stand up great next to eachother and have a build in handle and a great nozel that clamps on to each can individually. They do not leak at all.the matal cap with o ring is a solid fit. he can easily fit 7 across the floor in the back of the boat. also we use to burn a ton of fuel on lac suel. now driving at 3500 rpm/32-36 mph can fish for 2-3 days without filling up 40 gallon tank. use to fill up every day sometimes, when you got a new faster boat you always wanted to drive wide open."
1386225,Bill Krejca,2012-01-26 09:01:00,6107,"In my opinion, this seems like the wisest approach, and one that I have used in the past. There can be a number of unknowns associated with containers that originally had been used/were created for other purposes. As noted, there are usually laws in place regarding suitability of explosive containers. Re: other containers: Murphy's Law in the regard of unforeseen problems should be taken into consideration. Some problems that come into mind : rust in barrels, chemical deterioration, just plain leakage, loose fitting caps, tipping, movability, removal of the gas, etc. Go with the number of gas intended containers, and have a good trip. It sounds like you will be going to a fun place, give us a report when you get back. Don't forget a funnel. Bill Krejca"
1386228,lenray,2012-01-26 09:05:00,467,Fill them all up at Grand Portage.
1386301,Fishoil,2012-01-26 11:44:00,1277,"We will be hauling the fuel in a pickup box with a cap, then transporting it 10 or more miles to camp by boat. Most likely we will be buying the fuel stateside for the cost savings, even if we bought it up there we'd have to transport it 100 miles on the worst roads of the entire trip. In the past I've used 5-6 gallon plastic gas cans but invariably one or more leaks fumes or fuel out of the cap and the truck and it's contents end up smelling like gas, not to mention the safety concerns. The plastic barrels would seal up good but my 2 concerns would be any residual soap and whether they would even be legal to use being that they are white and not designed for fuel transportation."
1386305,Guest,2012-01-26 12:12:00,0,I don't know if this applies but you might want to check out this link.http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/bulletin...gas2_2003.html
1386313,LOW1,2012-01-26 12:22:00,2828,I would buy the tall rectangular Jerry style gas cans. Tie them together into a cube and they will be stable. And if you buy the good ones they won't leak but they will be expensive. I have to believe that wrestling with a 30 or 50 gallon barrel would be difficult at best.I think you should declare the gas at the border as it may be more than technically you are permitted to bring in duty free.I would stay far away from any container not approved for carrying gas. The border folks may also deny entry for the same.
1386319,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-26 12:45:00,1460,"I still think the 55 gallon drum may be the only way to go. Get yourself a clean can, cum-a-long binder and a hand pump along with a couple 5 gal gas cans. Fill up at the border and seal barrel. It should not be a major problem to offload it out of a pickup with topper. Just lay it on its side and roll it off using a ramp(4x6's). Pump out 10 gallons, reseal drum and then put her in one of the boats. As the gas is about 7.5 lbs per gallon with about 40 gallons, that's about 300 lbs, certainly transportable by boat. I am afraid that if you tried the other routes, you will run into legality problems. I have no idea what's legal in Ontario, but you do have to transport in type 1 storage can(5 gal) up till 4/vehicle depending on the state and has to be an approved container thus elimating the soap barrels."
1386358,Skywagon,2012-01-26 14:23:00,1106,"Just for the fun of it, I called Customs at Fort Frances asking the gas question. Their answer was: as long is it is a reasonable amount of gas for use in a pleasurecraft for the duration of your stay. To my surprise, they had no problem with a 55 gallon barrel."
1386368,wallydave,2012-01-26 14:51:00,2151,"Skywagon, thanks for making the call, don't most camps state they do not clients bringing extra gas in? It seems to me most of them have a statement concerning gas for safety reasons? If I was to bring gas across the Border, I would like to have something offical in writing! The next question is, how would the US border staff feel about the tank of gas?"
1386471,Fish_Heads,2012-01-26 19:43:00,154,You don't deal with the US border staff till you return to the US & by then you won't have any gas left to worry about.
1386533,northernbite,2012-01-27 05:57:00,1186,"As I to have transported gas to Canada here is what I was able to do. I have 5 6 1/2 gal gas cans that you would use on a Mercury motors, with vents and ment to use in boats, I also have a 12 gal. that is left in boat until needed and a supply line is available to hook this tank up. I found these tanks at garage and lawn sales. I now have the ability to transport 48 gals. of gas. But I now have a bigger boat with 40 gal. tank so don't need so much but we have replaced some of the old ""gas cans"" with these. You could buy 4 12 gal. boat tanks and have them the rest of you and your buddies lives. I also went to Tractor Supply and bought flat metal loops to run tie down straps to. Just a thought,Paul"
1386068,Fishoil,2012-01-25 19:45:00,1277,I'm looking for ideas for transporting gas to a remote destination. We have a couple of boats going and need to bring at least 50 gallons. In the past I've just brought 5 gallon jugs but we needed much less. I'd like to have a better way to transport it that takes up less room than all those jugs. Taking less isn't an option since we will be over 100 miles from the nearest place to purchase gas. Any ideas?
1386099,FrankLeigh,2012-01-25 21:26:00,80,"You can buy 50 gal marine bladders, but they are not cheap, probably $700 or more. Talk to a marine supply dealer or military surplus or check e-bay, or just google marine fuel bladders. You would still need a way to dispense the gas. Whatever you do, be careful to follow all safe practices for handling and storing fuel.A couple of years ago a group came into camp after losing their boat and a lot of their equipment, when their extra containers caught fire. They were lucky to get the boat disconnected from truck."
1386103,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-25 21:44:00,1460,So would a 55 gal drum with a hand pump not work?
1386135,Guest,2012-01-26 05:49:00,0,"If you could handle it, it would exceed 400lbs"
1386138,ohiojmj,2012-01-26 05:58:00,1262,"Ten 5 gallon plastic gas cans for $10/ea might be a good option. They always come in handy for such trips and don't require pump or tube, etc. Strap them in wherever they are stowed for transport."
1386155,LLewellin,2012-01-26 06:34:00,1790,I think you would need two 55 gal drums. Full one on shore pump into the empty one in boat. Then when you get to your destination reverse the process. Is there such a thing as a 10 gal or 8 gal plastic gas cans that are taller or that will cube out better than the typical 5 gal can? I think the individual 5 or 6gal plastic jugs are what I would use.
1386169,Fishoil,2012-01-26 07:02:00,1277,I can get some 15 or 30 gallon plastic drums that held car wash soap. If I rinsed these out well do you think they would be safe to use?
1386191,Pikeslayer8,2012-01-26 07:42:00,1460,"Fishoil, (man I love your handle) First, how will you plan on hauling it? Pickup, SUV, trailer? When you get to your destination, how far is the area where you will store the fuel? Is it your plan to haul the barrel(s) up empty and fill them at the last possible opportunity?Give us a little more info and we""ll pick it apart for ya. Handling this much gas safely is paramount.As far as the soap barrels go, it sounds like a good option to me, but make sure you have fuel stabilizer on hand. I would worry about the soap residue. Nothing worse than fighting the bad fuel battle."
1386212,ohiojmj,2012-01-26 08:40:00,1262,"It might be illegal and dangerous to transport gas in unapproved containers. If crossing border, check with customs on rules for safety and duty."
1386218,Lovetofish,2012-01-26 08:51:00,458,"Maybe use a smaller motor, like my 8 hp. You can fish all day on 3 gallons of gas."
