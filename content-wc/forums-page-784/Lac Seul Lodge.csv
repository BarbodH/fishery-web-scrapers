543613,Guest,2004-10-03 11:13:00,0,For the last 9 years we have been going to Scout Lake Resort in August. The last couple of years we haven't been happy with the conditions at the resort. Wondering if anyone has experience with Lac Seul Lodge? I hate to learn all the new places to fish but need to make a change. Thanks
543622,Guest,2004-10-03 19:33:00,0,"Mike, I have been to both resorts and Lac Seul Lodgeis a much nicer place and is overall run a lot better. Our group usually stays at Lac Seul Lodge but had to change dates last minute and couldn't get in last year, ended up a Scout Lake. The proximity of the fishing was nice but the place was a little run down (docks at a 45 degree angle), they were not too helpful or overtly friendly, Etc. It wasn't bad but for about the same amount of money there are a couple fo palces in the area that will take care of you better. Dan McDonld @ Lac Seul Lodge runs a first class operation and does a nice job, we have always been happy. Another option you may want to look into is fishermans cover resort, we are booked there next year since Dan was booked for the week we wanted once again. A friend of mine has a trailer there and it came highly reccommended. Price is about the same. I drove through the resort and it looks well maintained and to be well run. The owner was friendly and accomodating. The bonus for you would be that the fishing is in very much the same area as scout lake resort, I believe (my names my be screwed up and someone will hopefully correct me)that the resort is actually in scout bay and basically you enter Lac Seul at the same point that you would from scout lake. Hope this helps -Joe"

543671,Guest,2004-10-06 23:58:00,0,we stayed there a number of years ago when dan was still married. It was very nice with nice boats and motors. the fish cleaning house was really nice. caught a lot of northerns right accross the water on the opposwite shore. good luck.

Now just because I use to own it, just because I use to be married to Dan doesn't make me biased. (haha) But all kidding aside, besides it being a clean, well run resort, the best part is if the weather gets lousy (wind) there are the 3 bays and Otter lake to fish without being beat to death and the fishing is very good close to camp. Fish On! Rhonda"
