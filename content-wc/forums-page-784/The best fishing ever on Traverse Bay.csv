Our boat of 3 guys caught 13 fish over 10lbs, not to mention all the ones that went 4-8lbs. I cant rememebr how many we caught over 5lbs. All I know is this is the best Walleye fishing I have ever had. The old days are back!! Everything worked for us trolling and jigging, pink and yellow were the best colors, and troling the flats(pearl,chartruese, and firetiger) Had a few days when we didnt get to the bay, but still picked up a few decent ones in the river. But if you can make it to the bay you will have a good time. If you dont get that master greenback, at least you'll be pulling in 5lbs. Have fun guys, cause it doesnt get any better."

First master I have caught up there in 3-4 years. Unfortunately the weather pushed us off to the Red on Saturday and we drove home saturday night. Our best day was on Friday where we caught several good fish. My best was back in 94-98...I caught more masters then I can count, even quit taking pictures of them all! It is close, let's hope the water stays high for next year!"
543948,Guest,2004-10-26 16:30:00,0,"I wouldnt say the old days are back, but is a alot better than it has been in the last few years, I wouldn't believe that you caught that many, but I heard from some friends that were up there. They claim to have had some of there best fishing ever. They told me that in 4 days fishing they caught 10 that went over 8lbs, they said they lost at least that many big ones too! So It sounds like it is at its prime right now. Its sad when ever some one says they did really good, everyone has to jump on them and call them out on it. If this keeps up, no one will report a good week, and soon no one will know how the fishing is. Great Week, and what a great catch."

One went 13.5. Also picked up a couple nice gators in the 7-8 pound class. All went back. On Sunday went to the same area, fished the same way (7 Shad) and couldnt get any over 5 pounds??? So thats fishing. Have totally blanked there too on some trips."
