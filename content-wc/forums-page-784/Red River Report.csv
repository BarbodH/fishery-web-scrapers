543921,Guest,2004-10-25 12:38:00,0,"ED ON THE RED Pine Falls was good to me on Saturday. Did a 15.1, 32.5 true hog. Weather was as bad as I have fished. Was worth every bit of it. Lots of small fish and some 22"" - 25"" stuff. Would have been fun to touch base. Went through Lockport Friday night, had a berger in Sielkerk, stayed at Papertown. Later..... JIMJOHN"
543930,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-25 16:17:00,3871,"WOW! 15.1 I got the picture you sent me Jim...UF-DA! I uploaded it and here is a link so you can share it Jim.http://www.myfishingpictures.com/img/037786.jpg Ya...You Da-Man Jimmy John..You Da Man! Now your 2 up on me for Sumo Greenbacks. Shanon dropped his so I will be darn sure and show him your photo...I am sure it will ease the sting he is feeling. :D Man I wish we knew you were there. We stayed at the Dearwood Friday through Sunday. We wanted to run up but the weather spooked us. Rough going I am sure but man..that is a sow. Ata Boy Jim! You have paid your due's and I am darn happy to see you got your #15. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
543931,Guest,2004-10-25 16:55:00,0,"Nice Fish Jim. Saw it on the BE post. Your really rubbing it in too. At 2:30 Sat AM I was outside my place, rain, wind and cold. I decided to go back to bed since it was soooo bad."
543936,Guest,2004-10-26 07:27:00,0,"We didnt make it to the Red this year and its great to hear that the fishing has been good. One of the guys in our party always caught his fair share of Bullheads while we waited for the Greenbacks to bite. For his sake could somebody tell me how the Bullhead run is...if its good it will really upset ""Bullhead Jimmy""."
543937,Guest,2004-10-26 07:53:00,0,"Bullhead lover, Been there done that. Too early...... Dont believe you could buy a bullhead now... Have a plan so when you hear the flow is good, weather is nasty, greenbacks are there and so should you be there... GOODLUCK,, JIMJOHN"
543938,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-26 08:09:00,3871,"Ol Jimmy is Purdy dangerous on them big cats too Eh. I have a few nice pics of him with some giants off the Red. We fished the ""Cats Classic"" together once upon a time. As a novice catman he pulled his weight in a big way putting us on the big board fairly high. Been a while since I talked him into cat'n though. I think he liked the thrill of the cat'n..that is just as long as the frogs were fresh that is. Jim ain't too keen on ""Funky Frogs""...nope. :D LOL! Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
543951,Guest,2004-10-27 07:32:00,0,Four of us just got back from the Red. we fished for five days and it was without a doubt the best we have done since 1999. Caught many nice 3 to 5lb Greenbacks and caught several fish everyday in the 10lb range. Its great to see the Red have a better year. CATCH AND RELEASE
543880,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-21 06:25:00,3871,"Cornhusker if your interested I have a recommendation for a guy to do replicas and skin mounts for Greenbacks? I have seen a bunch of Greenbacks come back from the shop looking like...well...just looking like any other walleye. Most seldom get the iridescent coloration correct that so sets a Greenback apart from any other walleye. If you have ever stayed at ""Cats on the Red"" you may have seen this guys work? Stu has a few monster Greenbacks in his lodges, like the one in lodge #7...that is a sumo sow Greenback Eh! In my opinion Starodub does the best job I have seen on Greenbacks to get the coloration and configuration of a true Greenback perfect. I have not mounted a Greenback yet, I got plenty of Walleye mounts..just not that certain sumo Greenback I have been waiting for. But when I do, he will be the guy to do it for sure. Here is his info if your interested. Starodub Freeze-Dry Taxidermy 48 Avalon Rd., Winnipeg, MB Canada R2M 2L3 1-204-254-1393 Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
543882,Guest,2004-10-21 08:06:00,0,Thanks husker - I appreciate the tip very much - good fishin' -

543885,Guest,2004-10-21 10:25:00,0,"The red is fishing good. Yesterday got a 29.25"" and some other nice ones. Salties and jigs in Miracle Mile. Boat launches are A-1..."
543886,Guest,2004-10-21 10:28:00,0,e-mail me maybe we can work something out. Always went to Pine Falls but gave the Red a shot this year and it was good...[email protected]
543902,Guest,2004-10-22 17:57:00,0,So far lots of rain up here on the Red. We boated a bunch of smaller Greenbacks and a few nice fish. We lost one very heavy fish late afternoon...a very nice fish. :( For a half day in mostly steady cool rain it was not too bad. We have a good idea were to start in the morning anyway. No sumo's in the boat....yet. We will see what Sat does for out luck? Ed
543905,Hawgeye,2004-10-24 00:43:00,1355,"Eddy, What color and type of boat were you in on Saturday? We fished all up and down the river for several miles from the park launchon Saturday. Caught a bunch of saugers with only a 20""er to account for that was of any size. Hope you had some luck! Hawgeye"
543911,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-24 19:33:00,3871,"We were in a 2004 Red/Grey Lund Pro-V all weekend...in the rain..and more rain...and wind...and more cold rain. The report for us for the weekend was lots of little fish both walleye and sauger, a mix of 22"" to 26"" walleye and the one true hog up to the boat but not in the boat. That one will give Big Shanon some nightmares and fits for a long time I think? They all hit very light so you never know what it may be tell you set the hook and feel the weight. A tiny sauger hit just as lightly as a hog...ya just never know? Me..I never set the hook into anything ""big"" this trip. I'll be back, she is waiting for me...I know it. We did our best slow slipping 1/2-3/4 oz Char or Pink jigs with the aid of the bow mount electric and zig-zagging over the shallow flats on the miracle mile. Six feet and often five feet was the best areas. If we found a hump that produced a few fish per pass we anchored on it and vertical jigged tell we got bored..then we slipped and jigged again. The last two hours before dusk seen our better fish and the one hog Shanon had on. A little flurry at dawn, then search the mid day away looking for strays. With that massive cold front sliding through and the never ending cold rain I think we did what we could? We fished from dawn to dusk every day so we gave it a hard go. Spoke with some anglers who said the Pine Falls bite was truly incredible. They caught 40 over #10 last Thursday in one boat alone...that is enough to get a guys atention...it sure did mine anyhow. Yet with the steady rain and the word was it would only rain more..plus more winds from the W.. so we chickened out on pulling up off the Red and heading to fish Travers Bay Sunday. Might regret that decision for a while? We had all the wet we could handle and the thought of 5-6' rollers and even more wet didn't sound all that much fun even if the bite was hot. We seen a few #9 plus fish caught on the Red but it was just not our turn this trip. Had fun even with the challenging weather and touchy bite...I'll be back.

543914,Guest,2004-10-24 21:28:00,0,Light biting ?? Last time I was out the greenbacks were hitting so hard we had to hold onto the rod with both hands lol..I do believe there is a knack on how to get them to bite hard.Maybe sometime Ill show you how Eddy ..Until then fish on
543916,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-25 07:51:00,3871,"Ya I would agree Concerned Angler. I would have to see or be shown what would trigger that kinda aggressiveness on that bite last weekend on the Red. We tried a wide range of presentations and a super light pick up was common to all of them on this trip. A correction as upon rereading my last post I now see I misspoke (a soggy Brain-fart I think). The super bite rumor from the Falls was 40 fish over #8...not over #10. Still that is a heap of greenbacks on one trip by anyones standards. Rise and Shine...Sunshine here this morning...something I have not seen since last Thursday so I think I will need to relocate my sunglass's. Ya..go figure it's Monday...and poof..there be the sun..Eh. ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""ED on the RED"" ><,sUMo,>"
543866,Cornhusker,2004-10-19 23:35:00,104,"Fished from Oct 11-16. 4 of us caught 14 fish over 10 pounds. Biggest was a 32 1/2 inch 13 pounder. Caught a nice smattering of 5-9 pounders as well, and the usual eating size greenbacks, altho we throw everything back. (Altho this year 2 fish were kept for the week) If someone could tell me how to post pics on this site, I would.

543870,Guest,2004-10-20 07:15:00,0,What a report. We plan on going up this weekend. Did you have your best luck north or south of the landing. Is the current Strong? How big of a jig did you use? Any information would be appreciated.
543871,Cornhusker,2004-10-20 07:54:00,104,"We used pink or Charteuse jigs mainly. Heavy ones (1 ounce) I like to keep my link veritcal, and at times the current was a little strong. Always went south from selkirk. I heard of one big one caught at sugar that week, but otherwise didnt hear as much north.

We were thinking about going way north (around End of Main camp) Were you fishing way down river or in the vicinity of Selkirk? (i.e. power lines, Doc's or Sugar Island). Any help is appreciated. Thanks Pete"
543879,Cornhusker,2004-10-20 21:22:00,104,"We fished the power line area. And another spot south of there a couple miles that I call ""DMS"". I call it this because there is an old billboard along the river there that has those letters on it. We fished in 7-9 ft there.
