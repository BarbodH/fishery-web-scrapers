Send me your email and I will send you a copy of the fire report - arson was ruled out!!!
544000,Guest,2004-10-31 12:10:00,0,"Turbo, Arson was not ruled out, it was inconclusive due to the heat of the fire. Yes, it was at night, the day after the sprinklers were drained. Like Turbo said, it was hashed out a lot last year."
544002,Guest,2004-10-31 14:24:00,0,"Skunk is entirely right, the OPP still hasn't closed their investigation. Just Archer's group says that arson was ruled out, and now they get what they want, splitting the profitable parts away from the pink elephant. The lead spin doctor is Rod of course, he likes to use Walleye Central for free advertisement. They had a site their own, but can't attract enough hits to spread the manure."
544005,rtmg,2004-10-31 18:03:00,34,"hey, give it a rest. this subject has been debated/rehashed/argued to death. bottom line, NOBODY really has any idea how it happened etc. It was over a year ago, so let's move forward !

Minaki Lodge, which burned to the ground a year ago this Thanksgiving, was a big chunk of the property announced for sale last Thursday by bankruptcy trustee Ernst and Young. By Janet Gibson Miner and News It's now called an asset. Minaki Lodge, which burned to the ground a year ago this Thanksgiving, was a big chunk of the property announced for sale last Thursday by bankruptcy trustee Ernst and Young. To locals, the old log lodge was the centrepiece of the town, the place that made Minaki famous. No matter who buys the property, they said, without the lodge it will never be the same. The trustee appraised the property, officially called Minaki Lodge Resort 2002 Inc., and is selling it as two separate lots. Lot 1 has land, buildings and equipment. Sprawling across 61.5 acres, it includes 118 motel units, nine cottages, a restaurant/bar/docks and a nine-hole executive golf course. Lot 2, 28 acres of land in the northwest corner of town, is being sold as 44 separate lots. Former owner Phil Archer bought the land from the Minaki foundation. According to some residents, he'd planned to use it for a trailer park or an expansion of the golf course. The trustee will accept separate offers on the lots until Nov. 19, but may sell them sooner. We'll wait and see what happens, said Tim Watson, an employee of Minaki Marina and captain of Minaki United Firefighters. We're world famous for Minaki Lodge, Watson said. Everybody's got a memory. Sage McBride was working at Minaki Lodge day care in late August 2003 when the staff were told the lodge would be under new management in two weeks. When the two weeks were up, they were told their jobs were finished. McBride, whose mother and father met while working at the lodge, cried when it burned down. When we were kids, we'd go there to swim and play, she said. It can never be the same without the main lodge there. Her friend Dave Pundyk said he looked forward to seeing the golf course and Dockside Restaurant revived, a restaurant and bar that were popular with the townspeople. Pundyk, whose father used to guide for the lodge, said the building had served as a landmark when he was boating on Sand Lake. Driving in round the corner, it was always nice to see the lights. Minaki Marina owner Malcolm Reid said he didn't think anyone had expressed an interest in the property, adding, That it's for sale is nothing new. In the last 10 years, the lodge had three owners. Archer bought it in 2002 from Texas businessman Sadrudin Kassan, who bought it in 1998 from Wabaseemoong (Whitedog) First Nation. It'd be nice to have somebody do something with it, Reid said. Brothers Mark and Mike Fuchs, who arrived at Minaki Marina Sunday en route to their family cabin on Sand Lake, said the lodge was etched in their childhood memories. Every time you'd go by, you'd slow down, said Mike, who lives in California. He couldn't believe it when he heard the lodge had burned. I'm still sad, he said."
543908,Guest,2004-10-24 09:48:00,0,"Have heard much about the lodge. Anyone know who the buyers for the 2 lots that were put up for sale? At present, are there any facility, such as resorts, golf course or fishing, operating at all?"
543909,Guest,2004-10-24 19:12:00,0,"The sale officially closes Nov 19, 2004 - At present we are not operating anything as per the orders from the Receiver. We will be making a formal announcement shortly as to the status of the property."

543915,Guest,2004-10-25 03:17:00,0,Quite the opposite....I have lllleeeefffttttt the past - too bad you haven't!!!! Cheers!!!! Stay tuned for an announcement regarding the property shortly...
543918,Guest,2004-10-25 10:30:00,0,"Great! Turbo1, can you provide update on the new ownerships and their plans for the wonderful lodge once available? Am looking forward to the new opening of the resort! Cheers."
543934,Guest,2004-10-26 01:37:00,0,Can't officially announce anything until after the creditors have been dealt with - everyone will be impressed with the way things are going to pan out. Are you looking for work? Or just curious as to what has been happening with the property? We have spent along time pondering the property and deciding which route in which we should take - and we are really close to telling the world what the plan is. I'll keep updating this post on a regular basis.... Cheers!! Rod
543972,Guest,2004-10-29 01:11:00,0,">Are you looking for work? Nah, have heard much about the lodge from friends...beautiful fishing grounds and great 9-hole course. Have also read on some other articles that there may be some time-share resorts up for sale after the rebuilding. So am interested to find out how true is that plan. Cheers Rod for the info. Looking forward to more updates. Vincent"
