543962,JohnAB,2004-10-28 08:06:00,49,I see under the Silver Water Wheel thread you mention you fly out to Kawaweogama with Rusty Myers. I was curious as to what he charges for the flight including return if you wouldn't mind posting it. I also assume the flight is in his twin engine Beech and if so is there any weight restriction? Thanks for the info.

I checked their website and they do have a weight limit, but we've never scared them with our gear. We took up 9 cases the one year for eight guys. John, the manager of this outpost, said ""Oh we got some big drinkers, eh!"" He was being just a tad facetious because the week before this, four guys took 24 cases for a six day trip...and they didn't bring any back. We usually put 2-3 guys in the Beaver with some of the gear, then put the other 5-6 of us in the Beech (shark face). We weigh out just over 900 pounds of stuff. Like I said, they don't flinch at it. Most of our weight is in the provisions. Our trip coordinator takes enough equipment to rig have our group, and he is probably our heaviest traveler. It's funny, but he annually supplies his brother with a backup rod or two for various mishaps (dropped to the bottom, snapped, lost...). They have the greatest note plaques in these planes. They say ""Tipping your pilot helps him remember where he left you"" ... enough said."
