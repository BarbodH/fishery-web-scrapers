543912,Guest,2004-10-24 19:45:00,0,"I think the record walleye came out of Greer's Ferry lake in Ark. They have a longer growing season,the southern states have big walleye,but not the numbers.Please correct me if I am wrong as I live in Chicago, and have not fished southern waters but I have read the articles in mags.Also I have never seen a fishing show about them either.Bass, crappie, catfish, bluegill, but no walleye."
543913,jcass,2004-10-24 20:18:00,255,The PWT is having a tournament at Cumberland (TN) next June. THere must be some walleye there. I think you may have posted on the wrong board. THis is the Canada board.
543966,Guest,2004-10-28 18:58:00,0,"Lake Cumberland does have a fine walleye population, however, the previous viewer is correct. The numbers are not there, but, 5 lb. walleye are not unusual trolling or casting a crankbait. I am sure the pros can do better. The lake did have a large fishkill this summer, especially in the lower end of the reservoir. Most walleye perished. We had a huge rainfall (7"" to 8"" in a day). Cumberland is a rocky highland reservoir with no vegetation or wood cover in the upper 30'. The lake jumped about 20' in two or three days. The muddy water apparently depleted the oxygen in the deeper water (30' to 70') and the walleye did not move up quick enough. They said other species were not affected. Walleye up to 30"" long were observed. I am not sure how seriously this effected the population. If you are interested in a trip, I would call the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife to investigate. Lake Cumberland is normally fishable all year. A thin layer of ice only forms on the lake in the coldest of winters. Winter water temperatures are normally in the 40 deg range. Usually winter lows will be in the 20's and high in the 40's."

543977,Guest,2004-10-29 14:44:00,0,"considering the fact that there might be 10 posts per day on the canada board this time of year, i hardly think it will hurt."
543986,Guest,2004-10-30 10:55:00,0,"LOL! Yep.. all the guys with ""expertise"" on southern locations will be cruising the Canadian boards, prolly. I love the Canada board! It always struck me the most humorous and still does. Keep up the good work guys."
