I am thinking of renting it next year for a week with some friends. Thanks in advance for your input. Drift Sock"

The harbor is fairly well protected and a sand bottem so, if you want to swim it is nice. We enjoyed it. The folks at Buena Vista are very nice. What time of year are you going? The cabin rents out fast so you will need to get your reservasion in soon. Keep Yuor Rod Bent !!! FishingGeek"
