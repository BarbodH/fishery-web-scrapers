They serve breakfast and supper and supply either sandwiches or shore lunch kits. All you need are knife and fish. We were happy with the food and accomadations and are returning over the 4th of July again. The fishing was great and close to the camp. We had best luck with bottom bouncer with salted minnow or crawlers, for some reason jigs were not as effective. Mwal"
