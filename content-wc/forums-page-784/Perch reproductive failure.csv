543894,north_alabama,2004-10-22 04:20:00,172,"I've read from a couple sources, including a post on this site IIRC where folks believe the unusual cold weather last summer may have resulted in a widespread failure of perch reproduction in NW Ontario. Assuming that is the case, I was wondering what anyone might think the affect will be on next summer's fishing for walleyes in a perch-based forage environment?"
