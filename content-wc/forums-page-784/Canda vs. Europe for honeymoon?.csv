543984,WalleyeWidow,2004-10-29 22:59:00,1,"Dear Gentlemen, I have learned to appreciate, or at least accept, fishing because my husband is an avid fisherman. We have been to Canada twice for fly in trips, and I've enjoyed the trips because of the wildlife and amazingness of it, I haven't loved the fishing part. I think it's mean to fish. My question, though, is this: He wants to take our honeymoon (a year after the wedding) to Canada for a fly in trip. I want to go to Europe. He would be funding the trip, wherever we went. (I have a job, but do have debt and we both are paying it off.) So, I feel obligated to go to Canada and won't (well, I may a smidge) whine about it. But if YOU had wives who went to Canada with you as opposed to some European vacation, would you feel wildly appreciative and have lots of sex with her as a result? Or would you think, ""Heck yeah - I'm paying for it so shut your pie hole?"" I want him to love his trip, but am I being a dormat? Thanks for any insight you might have! Best, Emma"

When we went to Europe, I was in hot water all the time. Those gals aren't what you call modest. It was hard to pay attention to her when some young hottie in a mini or less was strutting her stuff. And the beaches........topless is not only legal but common....By the end of the week I thought my eyes were permanetly squinted from trying to catch the action on one side and trying not to get caught(again) by the wife."
543989,Shellback,2004-10-30 16:19:00,8083,"For a honeymoon, I think you two need to do something that you both will enjoy. My wife loves to fish, so she would like the fly in, but if you don't like to fish, I don't see how a fly in trip can justify as a honeymoon, no matter who's buying. I'd bag Europe, there's just too much to see and do in North America before heading overseas."
543992,Dano,2004-10-30 18:16:00,83,"Not to be a traitor to my gender or anything, but if you have already been on a couple of fly-ins with him, then I think you deserve a shot at Europe, no matter who is footing the bill. Fair is fair. Have fun! Bonjour"
543993,Guest,2004-10-30 19:02:00,0,I say you and my wife go to Europe and me and your old man will go fishing to Canada...sex is not as good as Walleye Fishing....but its a close second.

World class hotels and casino's (you won't recognise the city if you haven't been in a few years). There are five star hotels,shops and restaraunts everyhwere. Also some of the finest fishing around. Musky,salmon,trout,bass, and yes WALLEYE!"
543998,Guest,2004-10-31 09:24:00,0,"i say go to the caribean and spend the week face down in the water snorkeling. it will be just like being married, getting to see all the fish and knowing you'll never get to touch them. he might even get so frustrated he'll resort to sex as a substitute"
543999,Guest,2004-10-31 10:32:00,0,"Agree with the posters who say flyin trip is not for the honeymoon. You might try a different tack. Get a Cabela catalog, and a Victoria Secret one. Let him see you making lists, one of baggy clothes to buy for cold Canada, insect repellant, long underwear, and like stuff. Then look at ""other"" stuff you would get for a European or Caribbean vacation. Visit some web sites of European beaches and the wildlife you can see there. Tell him you that would be too hard on his eyes, and a fishing shack is much better! If he does not get the hint, he is pretty dense. Been there, done all three, and slept a lot less on the European and Caribean trips!"
544010,Guest,2004-11-01 07:55:00,0,My wife and I went Walleye Fishing on our Honeymoon and she insists on going back every year. I may have created a Monster since she buys more fishing equipment than I do. How can you beat the great outdoors and the romantic sound of a Loon as you cuddle up after a awesome day of Walleye Fishing?????
