My understanding is that it is a clear water lake of 20,000 acres. We have fished this area of Ontario the last few years, but primarily flowages, with outstanding success so leaving where we are is a bit concerning. Any experiences you have I would love to hear. Thanks"
544007,phishfearme,2004-10-31 18:59:00,1242,"wisconeye - regrettably, i can't give you first hand experience details on kag (although we've considered it in the past) i'd like to throw in my 2 cents worth on the main issue you pose - ""flowage"" lakes (river systems) versus clear, deep lakes (which we call ""top-end"" lakes with minimal or no flowage). when we started doing trips to northern over 25 years ago, it was very attractive to us to have walleye, pike AND lakers available. the laker issue automatically implied clear top-end lakes and our experience has been that these lakes are just to infertile to maintain the type of pike and walleye population that we've experienced on flowage lakes. don't get me wrong - we've caught walleye and pike on top-end lakes but it's totally a different type of fishing (deep!!) and it's just plain tough - and not all that enjoyable. my feeling - if you want good numbers and size walleyes (and pike) got to flowage lakes (the more flow the better) and if you want lakers, go to top end lakes. i think the exception to the above is that if the top-end lake is large enough where it has a significant amount of ""flats"" or shallows where water can warm, numerous types of bait fish can grow and weeds can develope. some top end lakes just don't have this - examples that we've been to include conifer lake with excellent adventures out of ear falls and north and south trout lake with way north. one that we've been to recently that had a hugh, deep, clear area seperated from the main flowage area was springpole lake using canadian fly-in fishing out of ear falls. just my nickel's worth. i think another interesting point of discussion along these lines is comparing ""canadian schield lakes versus ""james bay lowland lakes"" like kesagami - but that's for another posting. phish"
544008,Crede,2004-10-31 20:07:00,134,"Fished Kag in late May, 2003. Fished only for walleye - not pike or lake trout. Fished mostly where current entered south end of the lake and where small river entered from the east. Caught at least 50 per person per day. Used nothing but a jig and tail - sometimes with a minnow or piece of worm. All sizes, up to 28 inches. On day 4 of 7, my father turned to me and said, ""If catching good-sized walleye could ever become boring, we've about reached that point."" This from a man who has been walleye fishing in Ontario for the past 60 years. Not sure how this would translate to the middle of June. Would expect the walleye to be somewhat dispersed by then. The lake has a ton of structure - more reefs and points than you could hope to fish in a month. Not sure if this would be good or bad for locating them. By reputation Kag is a good walleye lake throughout the year. Our group has added it to our regular rotation. Any specific questions I can help with, let me know."
544023,Guest,2004-11-01 19:37:00,0,"I fished it for a week in July a few years back, booking the trip largely because of the great reputation Kag has as a primo walleye lake. Fishing was good, not great by my standards. Mid lake humps, points and island saddles all produced fish consistently. Without killing ourselves my wife and I averaged about 60 fish a day. It's a beautiful lake and one you'll definitely not get bored fishing. The only real negative for me was the abundance of other boats. In addition to the lodge there's at least 4 other outfitters on the lake. For me that was a new experience as all of my other fly-ins have been to ""single cabin"" lakes where you're the only party there. BTW, for what it's worth the Opichuan River has some brook trout if you're willing to walk a bit, and the lake does have catchable numbers of lake trout, although when I was there only the camp caretaker with riggers on his boat caught any. I vertical jigged 'till my arms fell off with no luck."
