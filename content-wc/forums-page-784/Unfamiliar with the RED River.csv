The first mile or so downstream from there has been fairly consistent. Shallow inside bends on flats with reduced flow and harder bottom have seen the most fish and therefore the pressure. Most of these flats are on the East side (your left) as your facing upstream. Humps in the rivers near the stream plant can be good too. Areas associated with the islands downstream from the Selkirk Park launch see some fish too. Ya know...I REALLY hate to say this...but look for the boats anchored up as they tend to congregate on historically productive spots. That is a pretty good strategy for your first outing on the lower Red in the fall. The bite has been shallow, 10' or less. We did our best on 7' and often as shallow as 5'. Hot pink/glow, green/glow, chartreuse and bright yellow jigs are a good bet. We had good luck with the Northland Thumper with the tiny blade flasher on the bottom side...not the Whistler but the one shaped like a shad head...bright yellow worked well on that. I used a lot of Glow two tone Fireball jigs in 1/2 and 3/4 oz rigged with a short stinger and I spooled up with 4/15 Power Pro line...I felt the sneaky bites better that way. Be sure to keep the drag set light so you do not roll over a sow on the hook-set, that is the easiest way to loose a big fish on a barbless jig in shallow water! Been there done that way too many times. Add a salted shiner or two and a section of a twister tail to help hold the bait on the barbless jig and your all set to go. It is easy to go through 2-3 tubs of shiners a day due to picky sauger and they tend to fall off easily...so bring plenty. Most of the C-stores have them in the freezer. The C-store next to Tim Burton's restaurant had good sized shiners and frozen minnows on our last trip. Tim Burton's has great coffee and snaks..we load up there in the morning on eats. I highly recommend you bring stingers too! Don't forget to pinch the barbs back on anything tied to a fishing rod. When you jig...Beat the bottom and lift and hold......beat the bottom and lift and hold. Experiment with how aggressive you need to be. It has been the less aggressive the better. Hope this helps.

543970,Backwater Eddy,2004-10-28 20:20:00,3871,"Just a heads up folks, the Red is rising quickly and darkening. Expect a good shot of water and color soon. More heavy rains to the South today so odds are very good it will jump up even more in the next 3-4 days. If I were headed North this weekend I would seriously consider headed straight to Pine Falls. The Red is darkening and picking up some speed. By this weekend it is very likely to be considerably darker and faster producing a slower bite. Certainly something to watch and keep in mind if your headed to the lower Red anytime soon. Anyhow, more rain...lots of dirty water headed North.

543971,Guest,2004-10-28 21:11:00,0,"Thx for the report Eddy... good advice to head to Pine Falls. Fished the Red today water already very turbid and current up, no greenbacks today. Perused a report that was much better from Pine Falls. Friends up there for next 2 days, had to work... will update when I hear from them."
