550867,Guest,2005-07-30 14:15:00,0,"Hi - Is this Scott and Abra or the brother (sorry I forgot the name) Yes this is Jon, Kim and Bruce from WI in cabin #1. Jon's been checking things on the computer. We are so excited to go. Ann and Al are coming with the bean bag toss again. They are also bringing a young couple who are both teachers. Should be fun. I hope the kids from the Curves VAn are there. WE met them at McDonalds on the way home and were so glad to see us. They were going to see if they could change their week to ours. Bring your washer game. It was fun. See you next Saturday."
550904,Renn,2005-08-01 08:24:00,87,"Jonnya83, This is Scott's brother. I will call him this week and make sure they pack the washer game. Sounds like it is going to be all of the ""regulars"" in camp next week. It should be fun. Hope this week goes fast!! I am not sure how much more sleep I can lose with out passing out!! :-) See you Saturday, Renn"

550221,MJ,2005-07-08 22:25:00,11,Where is Stephenson's Point? I don't recognize that.
550225,grt1,2005-07-09 11:30:00,259,"the hatch has started, my neighbour was on the lake this morning and said the surface was coated with them."
550226,grt1,2005-07-09 11:32:00,259,depends on which map you use as to what it is called. It is the Point on the south side across from the sunken Island by the Clay banks. there used to be a tourist camp on that point but it was burned out in the 1980 fire.

550059,bevy8,2005-07-05 09:32:00,8,"Since we are on the topic of GullRock, MJ and IAJigger I am interested on what kind of presentations you were using to catch the fish you caught? I have been going to GullRock for 5 years now but it has always been in late September with a group that has been going now for 25 years this fall. I got the walleye itch a little early this year so I'm heading up in a week and have never fished the lake during the summer months. What does anyone suggest, is jigging better than trolling, leeches vs. minnows, nightcrawlers...etc.? In the fall we also hit the Rock and Fisherman's really hard..is this true for the summer? Thanks... Bevy"

550061,Guest,2005-07-05 10:16:00,0,I fill jigging with a minnow is the most prductive way to fish Gullrock. There are times when I have to go to a spinner. I find a school of fish and sit on top of them.

550099,grt1,2005-07-05 15:35:00,259,10 fish in an hour this morning using a hammered silver spinner while those jigging in the same area got 2 spinners are more productive in the time of the may fly hatch on this lake.
550103,MJ,2005-07-05 16:45:00,11,"The mayfly hatch was just starting when we left last Wednesday and, as some one mentioned, several days of lightening etc had really turned the fish off. We felt we did pretty darned good considering the conditions. Not as good as last year but better than many other places we have fished for large walleye. We jigged with a 1/4oz slip singer, swivel, 24 inch leader and either a leech/minnow on a 1/0 bait hook or a floating jig. As for trolling, we never do it so no comment."

550194,grt1,2005-07-08 07:37:00,259,"yesterday I watched 3 boats anchored at Stepensons point in 22 feet of water, one boat caught in 30 minutes, 6 fish over 20 inches, the largest was 29, they were using bobbers and minnows."
550203,Guest,2005-07-08 09:48:00,0,"Where is Stevenson's point, I am not familiar with that spot? Thanks Jeff"
550217,Guest,2005-07-08 19:00:00,0,Has the mayfly hatch started? to those who have been there recently?
549752,Guest,2005-06-26 14:07:00,0,I am going to Gullrock Aug. 13. I have fished the lake several times in June but never in Aug. Was hoping someone could possibly offer some advice on what to expect as far as numbers of fish and maybe size compared to fishing in June. Also any help with location or techniques would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
549769,grt1,2005-06-26 21:31:00,259,"the fish were in 5 feet last week with temps in the 80s but have moved deeper now, today i got them in 16 feet. only fished one point and caught 2 over 23 inches and 8 in the eater range in 2 hours. oh yes, i only kept 3 for dinner and the big ones went back in the lake."
549849,Renn,2005-06-28 12:00:00,87,"atm1, I have fished Gullrock for quite a few years, 27 to be exact, and the majority of my trips are during either the 1st or 2nd weeks of August. I have fished Gullrock in June as well, but would have to say it has been my experience that we did better in August than in June. We have had excellent luck with catching both numbers and size in August. I think your chance of catching a 30""+ fish is going to be better in the spring but the over all size is going to be a little better in August. I asked our camp owner's son the exact same question and his response was August was better for numbers but the spring and fall had a better chance for a trophy. We are going to be on Gullrock from Aug. 6 - 13 and this year I get the opportunity to go in Sept. A first for me. Where are you staying? Renn"
549874,Guest,2005-06-28 17:59:00,0,"Renn, I will be staying at Wrights Wilderness Camp, formerly Weavers. Will be there Aug. 13 through Aug. 20. I have stayed at Weavers 13 times since 1984, one time in may and all the rest of my trips were around the middle of June. Have not been up to gullrock for six years now. Can hardly wait to get there. Would like to know what camp you stay at and if you have a favorite technique for August. We usually did a lot of verticle jigging or drifting with bottom bouncers and spinner rigs in June."
549892,Renn,2005-06-29 11:12:00,87,"atm1, We stay at Poplar Point. We use to stay at Weaver's and before that when it was Retsky's. But that was a long time ago when I was a kid before flush toilets, hot and cold running water, and non-diesel generated electricity in the cabins!!! Boy those were the days!! :-) We mostly fish live bait rigs. We have found that the less ""stuff"" we have near the hook the better. We have tried spinner rigs and jigging but keep coming back to rigging. We fish with minnows, leeches and crawlers. All are usually effective. Sometimes minnows out produce the others and vice versa. In August we mainly fish main lake humps. Although, many people fish the shoreline structure we like to stay away from the crowds as much as we can. You probably know this about Gullrock but if you put out a marker be ready to have 3 or 4 boats fishing within arms length of your marker! That is usually when we start casting with spoons. They make a nice sound when they make contact with Aluminum!! :-) Have a great trip....881 hours until we leave!!! Renn"
550006,nipper7272,2005-07-01 17:30:00,23,"While I was just there for the first time, I must say it curtainly did not live up to the hipe we caught some fish but nothing like I expected or was told to expect. I was and my party was very disapointed. I could have done better on lake of the woods. Good luck maybe things will change in Augest for you.I don't think I will be back."
550012,MJ,2005-07-01 22:22:00,11,We just spent 2 weeks up there and killed them!!! Sometimes you have to learn how to fish a lake to appreciate its beauty. On our last day we boated 32 fish in 4 hours and 7 were over 20. Bon appetit!!!
550013,Guest,2005-07-01 23:50:00,0,thought you said you killed them.....those are awful small numbers and size.
550014,Guest,2005-07-02 06:46:00,0,"One man's trash is an other man's treasure, that many fish in that time may not be great to one person but to someone who has poor or no fishing in his area those numbers are impressive.\ I was out the other morning and got 10 in an hour, everything from 6inches to 24 inches , so the lake is producing and now the fishing seems to be reverting back to it's normal fishing locations."
550023,Guest,2005-07-02 19:25:00,0,"Hey nipper, before you condemn a lake that you never fished before on this site how about giving the guys the rest of the story of last week. Mayfly hatches everyday, strong winds out of the southeast and east, thunder and lighting 2 nites and rain just about everyday (moving front). I'm sure the fish react different on other lakes you fished with those codictions.I was there last week and we had a great week 31in. was our biggest."
