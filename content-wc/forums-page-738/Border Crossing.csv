Will a passport make it easier entering, I heard somthing about them being required next year. I also will be taking my younger brother who will be 17. Are there any special accommodations that I need to make for him to get over easily?"
550975,jerry bark,2005-08-02 20:38:00,822,"hi guy, one of the guys on my trip last year took his passport and the canadian side agent refused it, she wanted his drivers license first. i'm guessing that they have a computer system that can trace your DL to some extent but not your passport #. she also asked for my plate number which she could not read from her camera due to my travel trailer she made sure it matched my DL though. i have never been asked for more than my DL on the return, but i think that will change soon enough. have a great trip jerry"
550979,Guest,2005-08-02 23:18:00,0,i have always made it with a drivers license. 2007 is what they have been saying about making passports in addition to drivers licenses mandatory. Minors need a drivers license and preferably a birth certificate. my minor do not drive yet so birth certificate is mandatory. if both legal guardians are not going with the minor across the border then a notarized letter from the one not in tow must be produced with approval that the single guardian can take the minor accross. best bet is if you have questions to call ahead. 10 mins here could make up for lost hours there or even getting turned away.
550985,Gary_IA,2005-08-03 05:44:00,144,"They can demand proof of citizenship from both minors and adults. A certified copy of the birth certificate and passport proves citizenship. A driver's license qualifies as a photo id and course your right to drive. A passport is both proof of citizenship and photo id. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that they check the driver's license for OWI convictions which could preclude entry into Canada. In the case of minors going to Canada I agree that a notarized letter of permission to travel to Canada with named person for a specified time from stay at home parent(s) or guardian(s)is necessary. By the way, if you have a minor with a certified copy of birth certificate and no driver's license, consider bringing a photo id from his or her school. The fact that one is not checked for proof of citizenship (certified copy of birth certificate or passport)only means that it wasn't checked at that particuliar crossing. The next people through may be checked or different people or different crossings may check the documentation more closely. Take the documentation and expect to have it all checked."
551004,walley250,2005-08-03 09:27:00,161,What is a notarized letter? Can this simply be hand written or is this a legal document?
551008,Gary_IA,2005-08-03 10:22:00,144,"The letter may be in the form of an affidavit.
