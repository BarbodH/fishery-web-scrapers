Here's another question - I have read a number of posts on Lac Seul where it seems people travel 20, 30 or even 40 miles daily by boat to get to ""the spot."" Is that a regular requirement? From experience, I know that on Eagle, we would sometimes have to travel from the main basin (ie. Dead Man's area) to the east (Lone Pine area) to get to the bite, due to the shallower stained water in the East and the resulting earlier mayfly hatch. However, that was only 10 miles or so. Thanks as always for all of the helpful responses."

A lot of people that have ""spots"" are simply returning to an area that they may have caught a couple of big fish from last year. You can travel as little or as far as you want on Lac Seul and still have success. If you get a good map of your area you should be just fine. Regards and have fun!"
550923,Guest,2005-08-01 13:51:00,0,Most resorts have a good fish population close to their dock. In fact the last place I stayed at a guy caught 22 Walleye off the dock before we took our boat out after breakfast. You read about guys who travel to Broad and Sunlight blakes on Lac Seul because they hold a lot of post spawn fish and its easier fishing at that location than working the lake. Pick a good Lodge and they will put you on good fishing.

550965,Guest,2005-08-02 12:15:00,0,"I fish Lac Suel in June and September. In June we travel further because the walleyes are not as dispersed. We'll go to Ghost Narrows (14 miles), South Bay (10 miles), McKenzie Bay (15+ miles), Broad and Sunlight lakes (30 miles). In September we'll catch walleyes in Scout Bay right in front of Onaway Lodge, but, we also do great in the Bay of Islands and Manitou Point. Late in the year, you can't hardly NOT find walleyes. It's almost to easy. Ron"
