On day we went out and caught between 40 and 50 walleyes on Cedar Lake. Most in the 12 to 17 inch range. a few smaller. They were all pulled from the same area. Let all but 6 go. The biggest wallleye i caught there was an 18"" 2.25lb and my uncle got a 20"". He also brought in a 33"" Northern on ultralight. I cant wait to go back next year."
