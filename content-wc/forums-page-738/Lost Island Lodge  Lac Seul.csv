550903,Guest,2005-08-01 08:10:00,0,Thinking of booking a trip to Lost Island Lodge in 2006. Would love to hear from anybody who has been there and what they think of it.

The place looks great, it's always full of docked boats, its on an island and right on the water which is pretty cool. I have caught decent northern/walleye within minutes from that place. As for fishing in that area, I'd say go for it. But, for hospitality and more camp questions, you'll have to hope other people answer your question. Good luck!"
551002,Guest,2005-08-03 08:46:00,0,We have been to Lost Island twice and I would go back. The fishing is great and I would recommend getting one of the Guides for a couple days to help you learn some spots. They will be happy to give you a marked map and that should put you on fish. The people that run the camp do a great job and you should have a great trip.

An occasional smallie or pike. We didn't travel over 15 minutes to catch fish. Nothing real big - up to 26"". Facility is OK. Maybe were spoiled but we'd like real beds, not bunk beds. She was not really tuned in to leaving the cabin to go to the biffy. However, it was spotless. Fun location on a little island. We did have ""Chamber of Commerce"" weather the whole time we were there. Some people could get antsy if the weather kept them off the lake for a couple of days."
