542847,Guest,2004-08-23 12:44:00,0,"One update on the aftershocks from my trip to the Gouin. At one point, as we proceeded down the many miles of gravel road, I crested a hill with my '97 Ford Taurus Station Wagon. The road had been good for a long stretch of miles, I was probably cruisin at 35 MPH or so, anxious to arrive. As I crested the hill, there, in the middle of my lane, rested a loose rock, probably the size of a pair of workboots. Too late to swerve, my decision was to stay on the road and hope to clear the rock. I didn't, that sucker rolled and bumped the length of the vehicle....in fact , my son in the back seat said he could feel his feet move from the impact. No damage done at the time, everything was fine till this weekend. I noticed a gas smell coming from the old Ford, and took a peek underneath......you guessed it, a leak in the gas tank. Estimate for replacement $300-$400. Could've flown there for that additional $$$. !%$#&*!"
542926,Seanik,2004-08-25 08:16:00,218,"Baxter, Sorry to hear about your misfortune on the gravel road to the Gouin Reservoir. We also came upon a large stone in the middle of the road at the crest of a small hill. The higher clearance of the Ford van went over the rock without any problems. On the way from St. Michael to Parent we saw a Black Bear dead in the ditch, looked like it got hit by a vehicle. We will be going back next year, I believe a truck, van or SUV type vehicle is the safe way to travel this road."
542941,Guest,2004-08-25 12:23:00,0,"Seanick: As they say, S!@#$!T happens. It does not dampen my enthusiasm one bit to go again next time. I'd go tomorrow if I could. Hopefully I'll have some new (higher)wheels next time. I'm still experiencing ""Vacation Withdrawal"" more than a month after our return, work just hasn't been the same since returning from the Gouin....I've been waiting to regain my stride workwise, but it hasn't happened yet. Time will do it I guess, but you've gotta wonder what's wrong with our way of life....is it fair to work 50 weeks in return for two weeks of walleye fishing?"
542952,Alces,2004-08-25 20:01:00,35,"Like you guys said....two weeks vacation is a bummer..think about it, I have to be there for 50 weeks uh!"
542960,Atlanta Dave,2004-08-26 07:22:00,323,Alces You have to do something to earn the big bucks. How have you been? I miss not having a fishing trip to look forward to. Although Dwight and I are going to fish Erie in Oct for a week. Dwight had a blow out of a trailer tire on the way home and tore up a fender on his trailer. Dont know if bad tire or from the gravel. Dont work too hard. Atlanta Dave
550919,Guest,2005-08-01 11:50:00,0,Please provide detail of the drive.
550924,Atlanta Dave,2005-08-01 14:23:00,323,My opinion it is a long time on gravel rough on vehicles . We did not experience fishing that warranted tearing up a truck and boat. Atlanta Dave
542184,Bean,2004-07-29 08:13:00,20,"Would you be willing to take a fairly new truck in to these outfitters? I don't know how much ""stone damage"" might occur during the trip in and out. Also, would good mud flaps help prevent most problems on these roads?"
542186,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-29 08:42:00,323,Bean I dont think the 2 vehicles we took up got any damage from the gravel you will hear it hiting the wheel wells occasionally. It was the boat trailer that got beat but most of that happened on the wrong road we took going in. The ony thing I would be concerned about with the constant bumps is what it does as far as rattles in the vehicle in the future. Atlanta Dave
542187,McQ,2004-07-29 08:43:00,615,"A dependable vehicle is a must. We use our trucks some new, all within 3 model years without mishap. Good flaps help keep the stones down (make sure they clear the road surface by a couple of inches - you don't want them dragging) but if you're towing a boat then either fit it with a good bra or wrap the nose back to the fenders with a tarp. We have never had a problem over the last 20 years but have seen many who entered the road unprepared have their share. I did sand blast a boat a few years back travelling thru a construction zone on the paved highway. It doesn't take much at times to hurt a painted surface. You're also wise to use galvanized trailers too."
542196,Guest,2004-07-29 11:03:00,0,A bit of advice from last weeks trip - Be sure to knock the dust & dirt out of your air filter in your vechicle or better yet get a new one after that 4 hour trip on those dirt roads into and out of Gouin.
542658,Guest,2004-08-17 06:11:00,0,Thanks for that exciting report from your Gouin trip. It sure sounds like something I would love to do with friends & family.Thats the way fishing should be.Your boys will never forget it.We've been catching a few on the Sac reservoir this summer. Some of the guys have been doing real well there. A week ago me & a friend caught 10 (6 keepers & 4 shorts). That was better than the whole week in Canada in early July.Trolling with worm harnesses still seems to be the best. any how we love our week at Camp's bay & I know you do to.We're looking forward to taking our 2 yr old granddaughter up there soon.I agree with you on the work ethics. It seems like I need more time to do the things I enjoy- like fishing. Work is overrated. Enjoy the rest of your summer.Two more years & I will be out of this concrete& steel box. Jack
542659,Peekay,2004-08-17 06:58:00,7,"Bean, I did the trip thru Parent last year in a brand new Xterra....zero damage using good mud flaps....couldn't arrange it this year but would do it again in a heartbeat.....as McQ says, the road is well tended, but it is a dirt road and the region is very sandy so be wary when cornering....saw a pickup truck overturned in the ditch on our way out last year....also, stay right on the corners....those logging trucks don't slow down for anyone. PK"
542664,Seanik,2004-08-17 09:05:00,218,"Hi Everyone, Report on Gouin Reservoir Fishing trip Aug.7-14. I am an old geezer and in 30+ Canadian fishing trips including fly-ins this was absolutely the BEST one ever. The quantity and size along with ease of fishing, great outfitter assured a return trip by our group. We did a lot of research before selecting an outfitter and finally settled on Walleye Point (La Pointe aux Dores)with the help of regular posters on this board. Roger,the owner said they only get about 5 American groups each year, he and his wife Pauline were extremely helpful and the food served at the lodge was outstanding. The boats and 10hp motors were first rate and we never had to travel more than 20 mins. to get to great fishing spots, most of the time it was 10 mins or less from the boat landing. We didn't keep a fish count but the morning period from 7.00 to 10:30 am usually was about 20-30 c&r Walleye per man, didn't really target Pike,largest was 38"" caught on the only afternoon we fished. Largest Walleye was 24"" with the average being 15""-17"" and many 18""-20"". Leeches with a 1/2 oz slip sinker seemed to produce the best but at times a half nightcrawler on a single hook outfished everything. Overall a simple hook with bait outfished all the jigs and fancy lures we had in our tackle boxes. We rented a brand new out of the box 2004 Ford E-150 travel van from a local dealer with only 10 miles on it and as I saw it and thought about the 180 miles of gravel road through Parent I immediately bought additional insurance. The Parent road was better than expected we did the 180 miles in 3 hrs 40 mins with just a few minor stone nicks in the fender well areas, the van was just as quiet and rattle free after the gravel road as before it. Alces one of the frequent contributors to this board and a Gouin enforcement officer stopped by for a visit mid week and put us on a reef that really produced after a cold front slow down, many thanks Claude, you are a valuable asset to the Gouin watershed. The fingers are starting to cramp,time to quit. I would be more than willing to answer any questions about this outstanding fishery. Seanik"
542670,McQ,2004-08-17 10:03:00,615,"It's good to hear you had a great trip Seanik, the Gouin certainly is one of the best walleye spots in North America. Your observations on the road conditions should be a confidence builder for others thinking about making the trip. Claude is a definite asset to the fishery management, his knowledge and perspective relative to ""Gouin fishing"" present and future can be counted on as a source of reliable information. The Walleye Club (La Pointe aux Dore) is one of many Quebec outfitters who list their services here on Walleye Central in the Business Directory, for those of you haven't taken a look at this valuable information source - now is the time. https://www.walleyecentral.com/phpyellow/"
542677,Bean,2004-08-17 12:27:00,20,"McQ, Did you go on the trip to Oasis du Gouin or wasn't there enough people? I thought that was this month sometime."
542686,McQ,2004-08-17 17:41:00,615,"Actually Bean, it was supposed to be last week but I cancelled it earlier due to lack of response which is too bad because the group that was in a week earlier had a great time. Maybe I was being too agressive trying to attract 24 people. I'll be making another one for next year but will lower the numbers."
542083,Guest,2004-07-27 06:03:00,0,"Finally getting settled back in after a week in Paradise, up at the Gouin Reservoir. What a place! We've been to many other locations/outfitters....the water there is simply overwhelming...though we spent a solid week there we may have seen 1/10,000th of the reservoir. You really have to be on your toes and pay attention to where you've been and where you're going, the Gouin truely is a maze of bays, islands, and water. Looking for fishing structure? I defy anyone to miss locating whatever fishing situation they might want to try, it's all there. We booked with Martin Outfitters at their remote camp, located 10 miles or so north of their main lodge. Decent boats, motors, the camp was a camp, not the Ritz, but it served it's purpose well, no complaints here. We went as a father and son trip, and our boys (and us) had a memorable trip. The fishing was simply great! We had 2 seasoned 'Eye fishin adults, 3 teenage boys with some experience, and three virtual rookies. Everybody caught walleye. Many walleye in the 3#, 17"" to 19"" range.....big one for the trip a 24"" 5#er.....fat, sassy walleye. The Northern pike fishing was good, everybody caught some of them too, although we didn't really target them much, we were there for the walleye. Biggest Nord was 34"", weighing in somehere between 10# and 20#s.....thick, deep, fat 'ol Nord. All in all we boated 175 walleye in the 5 days there, losing most of one day due to heavy rain, thunder and lightning. Nord total for the week an even 40. We only kept enough walleye to eat while we were there, most went back in the water for the next time. Methods? Everything seemed to work. Crawler harnesses produced well, Dixie Spinners and Macs Smile Blades. Jigs produced well, particullarly Chartruse Twister tails tipped -w- half a crawler. Cranks produced well, Little Rippers (Reef Runner) and Rapalla Shad Raps, both deep divers and the Jointed ones, silvery minnow patterns. Spoons also produced, Daredevils in a variety of colors. The walleye , for the most part, were located in the shallow water within 30 yards of shore. Caught many drifting the shoreline, casting Cranks to the edge of the weedbeds on a slow retrieve. I will say that the drive there is challenging. We left home here in Northern NY, 40 minutes from the Ogdensburg/Prescott Border Crossing at 4 am and arrived at the Outfitters at 3:30 pm.....the last 3 hours travelling Gravel Road that got narrower and rougher the closer we got to Martins....don't attempt it with an unsound vehicle, when you hit the dirt road it's a LOOOOONG way in . But I'd do it again tomorrow if i could. My boys have been to heaven! Be glad to answer any questions....."
542088,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-27 07:00:00,323,"Baxter We also just got back. We felt the #s were less than we expected.I would guess our group of 6 got about 250 eyes but most were very small about 12 inches.Our biggest was 4 lbs with a few in the 3 # range. The rainy day you speak of was the best day of fishing we had with probably 150 or so of our eyes being caught. We did spend the first 3 days of our trip fishing deep with plugs and botom bouncers to very little success , per the advise of the camp owner. On wed afternoon we switched to jigs in shallow in bays and started catching fish. As you know it got real cold with a north wind on fri and really shut down whatever bite we had going. Agree with you on the drive . Took us about 9 hours from Ottawa to camp. Atlanta Dave"
542090,Guest,2004-07-27 07:29:00,0,"AD: We cruised through deeper waters a time or two and came up empty, hoping maybe to connect -w- some lunker eyes....so we stuck with what was working, and that was shallow presentations. I've picked up walleye occasionally in shallow water, but never before this trip have I found them concentrated in less than 10' of water. By the time the cold front rolled in (38 degrees that morning after going to bed with it humid and warm), we were in total catch and release mode, so we hung tight in camp and taught the boys the mysteries of Camp Poker. The bite was tougher that night when we finally hit the water. Which section of the Gouin were you fishing in? We were in the Lac du Male, southwest corner of the Gouin."
542113,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-27 14:12:00,323,"Baxter We were at Oasis Du Gouin which is in the southeast sector of the lake. We fished hard all day fri and i ;think th e6 of us had 4 walleyes, not a productive day. I understand Fri being bad with the major change in the temps. Atlanta Dave"
542138,Guest,2004-07-28 09:13:00,0,"Hi Baxter and Atlanta Dave, Our group of 4 will be traveling to the Gouin Reservoir Aug.6-14. We will be at the La Pointe aux Dores (Walleye Point outfitter), I believe they are Southwest of the Oasis Du Gouin. My concern is are the Various outfitters direction signs along the gravel road visable and easy to follow, specifically did you see or remember any for the Walleye Point outfitter. Getting lost or unable to find ones destination on that road isn't a pleasant thought! Any Information will be greatly appreciated. Seanik"
542141,Guest,2004-07-28 12:14:00,0,"Seanik II: Not sure if you'll be on the same road in that we took to our destination....we left the pavement at Senneterre. Once you hit the gravel roads, it's a LOOOONG ways between signs and turn-offs for various outfitters....I was worried a time or two when we went for 45 minutes or more without a sign, but you'll see one eventually. Our outfitter had signs at all the crucial junctions, but some were red, some blue.....so we slowed down and took a close look at every possible turn. Do not remember seeing signs for Walleye Point, but our focus was on Martin Outfitter signs and little else. Don't worry, there's no mistaking the main gravel road, the turn-offs are all narrower and rougher, and marked with signs to the various outfitters. 3 hours on gravel roads for us after an 8 hour trek to get to the end of the pavement. A long, hard ride coming and going. Hope you guys have a great trip!"
542143,Guest,2004-07-28 12:54:00,0,"Baxter, Thanks for the quick reply, We will be going through Parent, I have been on the gravel road out of Senneterre last year on my way to Berthelot Lake. I believe the Parent route is straighter and smoother from past posts. Atlanta Dave or Mcq, Whats your thoughts on the Parent route and are there enough outfitter direction signs? Seanik"
542155,McQ,2004-07-28 17:36:00,615,"Seanik, the roads are fine through Parent and the lodges all have great signage. You'll see multiple posts at all the critical intersections. Just FWIW the access road from Senneterre services the western end of the Gouin only - Martin, L'Hibou etc. The central section is accessed through Parent and the far eastern end at the dam through La Toque."
542176,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-29 07:28:00,323,Make sure you take the long route to Gouin from parent not the shorter route. We had a new Lund and had to go thru several washouts almost 5 foot deep not real pretty. If you take the proper road it is fine abet it is gravel and will shake your teeth loose. We had enough sign age to find our way but look for it carefully. Atlanta Dave
542181,McQ,2004-07-29 07:51:00,615,"Dave, I made that same mistake a few years back thinking I'd save some time. As you have indicated it was a horror show and in my estimation all reference to that route should be removed. It certainly is the road less travelled.To access the central area of the Gouin the best route is to follow the Clova extension and then make the turn to the north at the T, if I remember correctly it's about 30 Km / 20 miles west of Parent, just follow the signs for your lodge depending upon the area you are accessing. There is major logging going on and the main routes are well tended but it's still gravel so make sure you're in ""good to go"" shape for the trip."
