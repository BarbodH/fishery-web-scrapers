550760,Guest,2005-07-27 12:57:00,0,"There are two grocery stores, and a Wal-Mart in Dryden.http://www.cityofdryden.on.ca"
550761,Guest,2005-07-27 14:10:00,0,"There is also a Comfort Inn which I stayed at a few years ago and it was nice. I believe there are 3 supermarkets. The Safeway which is nice and the store on the east end of town across from Wal-mart and then another which is close to the Canadian Tire store on the north side of Highway 17. All three seemed pretty nice. We bought milk eggs and produce. Did buy any meat or deli products. Deli products seemed expensive to me.., If you shop Safeway and buy stuff on sale they will get you a Safeway Club card at the checkout which could save you a couple bucks. Nice folks at all three places."

If you come in past the wood mill (before you get to route 17)there is also a gas station at the first stop light which has bait, but the tackle selection is a little more limited. BABAMEL:I am flying to the cottage saturday, will be there for a week or so, if you are going to be in the area at that time e-mail me."
