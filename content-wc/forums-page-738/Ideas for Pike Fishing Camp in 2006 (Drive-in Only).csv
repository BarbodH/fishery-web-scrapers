It is a great lake for pike in the 6-10lb range and we always get a decent number of eyes in the 2-4lb range. We fish with a gang of eight the second week of July. We fished Press Lake, Ignace, Ontario for the first time this past June. I was not impressed with the size of the pike (2-6lbs). The eyes were plentiful but nothing over the slot. I would appreciate your ideas for a second lake/camp/resort to fish in Ontario that is reachable by car. I own a 20' Lund Alaskan with a F75 Yamaha. I prefer to use my rig versus a camp boat. My 12yr old son loves to catch northerns. I would like to get him into pike in the 12-20lb range. Any recommendations for May, June or August 2006? Thanks, DAVID, Cedarburg, WI, USA"
