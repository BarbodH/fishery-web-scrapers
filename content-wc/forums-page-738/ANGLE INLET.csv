550778,Guest,2005-07-28 12:46:00,0,I am staying at the northwest angle resort this sept. and have never been there before.My ? is how far does one have to travel by boat to get to some walleye fishing.It looks like on the map that the angle inlet is very shallow. Do they have any markers to help get to the lake? Thanks
