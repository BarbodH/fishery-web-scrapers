550302,Guest,2005-07-13 06:16:00,0,Glad to here you did well during the latter part of your trip. We left Wed morning and so missed the better weather and better fishing (figures!). Interesting you mentioned the last three hours of tuesday. We fished a good part of that day and got nothing except one good pike out near Birch Narrows. The first half of the evening was slow but around 7:00 or so we started getting a few.
550525,Guest,2005-07-19 23:47:00,0,"Our gang of seven fished the week of July 11, 2005. The air temp was in the mid-90s until WED then broke into the low 80s. We limited out by THU morning on both pike and eyes in the SE corner of LDML near the Five Sister Islands. Top water temp was 77-81 degrees F. All of the eyes were caught on worm harnesses in 10-12 FOW. The pike hit Blue/Blue #5 Mepps Aglias with White hair bucktail in 12-25 FOW. The best pike was caught by my 12yr old son NW of the Birch Narrows. It was 38"" and 10lbs. The best eye was only 5lbs. The trip was great for mid-July. Tightlines, Pfg1"
550780,Guest,2005-07-28 15:23:00,0,"hey guys we were up there the first full week in june and despite the awful weather the fishing was quite good numbers wise. we had no problem catching fish and even tho i cant say GULP outfished live bait, we did catch quite a few 'eyes on it and northerns too. norhterns bit like crazy while fishing for 'eyes. the berkeley powerbait in pumpkinseed color also worked. we have never fished the baril bay area but reserve is quite a good spot for 'eyes. i caught a 30"" there two years ago. it might be quite a boat ride from open bay or anywhere from that side of the lake but there always seems to be fish there. hook island is usually fairly good as well as bolton bay. any spots on the west side of the lake that are good besides baril and grassy? we never seem to get over there."
551017,Guest,2005-08-03 13:04:00,0,"Just checking to see if anyone has a recent report. I'm going to be up at pine point next week and wanted to confirm some reports I've been hearing. I was up there in june and the fish were shallow, thats what I continue to hear. Any Info is appreciated."

548449,CA_Fishead,2005-05-26 19:35:00,17,"Getting ready for the annual trip to LDML. Anyone been there this season yet? Water level up from the wet spring? Spawners out of flowing waters? Any info on the bite helps. ""Skeeters as big as birds yet? Thanks."
548464,Guest,2005-05-27 07:02:00,0,"I haven't been there yet, but I talked two days ago to the caretaker where I'll be staying. Said he's been catching them on slip floats in fairly shallow water (< 10 ft), minnows and crawlers. Didn't ask him about the water level. I'll be going up to LDML for the first time towards the end of June, so if you have any words of wisdom for a ""newbie"" on the lake, they would be most appreciated."
549281,Guest,2005-06-15 06:24:00,0,"We got back 6-4-05 and fishing was good then.Lots of small ones,biggest walleye 22 inches and northern 39 inches.Will be back 7-1-05.Are the big walleyes active yet?"
549285,Guest,2005-06-15 06:45:00,0,"I talked to my host this past weekend, mostly about logistics, but he did mention the walleye fishing had been relatively slow, ddn't say anything about size. He concentrates on the SW corner of the lake, so I don't know about other areas. I'll be up there from 6/25 to 7/6, so I won't be able to post a firsthand report before you leave, but I'll be talking to him middle of next week and will post any updates he has. What part(s) of the lake do you fish?"
549301,Guest,2005-06-15 08:30:00,0,We fish the broad point and bull island areas on this trip.
549334,Guest,2005-06-15 15:38:00,0,"Okay, I'll ask him what he's heard about those areas and post something around the middle of next week. I'll be mostly due south of there in Baril Bay and out towards Birch Narrows, but we might wander up that way once or twice just to see what it is like."
549599,Guest,2005-06-22 04:34:00,0,"I talked to my host last night. He said the walleye bite has picked up considerably in the last 2-3 days. The hot bait is jig/leech. This is a suprise to him because in his experience leeches have not performed well in the areas he/his guests fish on LDML. I didn't ask him about size of the fish, but he said they are starting to pick up few fish in and around ""summer"" spots. He hadn't heard anything specific about how folks are doing in the Broad Point/Bull Island areas. Hope you trip goes well."
549722,Guest,2005-06-25 09:50:00,0,I have fished baril and birch areas once and that day we caught alot of bass and northerns fishing for walleyes.Is the walleye fishing good in that area.We come out from Open Bay so we go by that area every day.
550169,Guest,2005-07-07 10:14:00,0,"Not from personal experience, but from what I gather from people that fish the area is that it is within Baril Bay there is some very good walleye fishing. I just got back from 10 days fishing there and the walleye fishing was quite poor, both in our direct experience and according to several regulars including two guys that guide on the lake on a part time basis. I believe the biggest problem was the weather. I don't think we got even one entire day of consistent weather. We had a nice west wind for 1/2 of one day, the rest of the time it gusted from the north and/or east, and from the south a couple times. I think we got under a strong, stationary low pressure front that just sucked in air from wherever the nearest high happened to be. At times it was nearly impossible to fish anywhere but sheltered areas. When we got there the surface temp was about 70, within 3-4 days it was 75, three days after that it was 66, and finished around 69 Typically guys head out two hours before they want to eat and expect to limit out in time for supper (unless they can't find any fish under 18"", which I understand is a problem sometimes) - that wasn't happening . In our camp (average about 15 guys fishing per day) I believe less than 5 fish were caught on jigs, 2-3 on crankbaits (rat'l traps). Most came on nightcrawler harnesses or variants of lindy rigs with crawlers. Only one guy had consistent success and he literally grew up in the camp (his dad is the former half-owner). He parked his boat every day at a certain time in a single 10 sq foot area and fished with crawlers and a split shot. For our part, all our fish except two came on crawler harnesses (one on lindy rig/crawler, and one on a red/white daredevil knockoff). The dominant color was chartreuse, with a couple fish coming on each of orange, purple, and white. In general the key was to locate traditional structure (points humps reefs, etc) and then find somewhere else to fish. Our biggest few fish, ~4 lb :o(, were caught suspended over 30 ft of water, 10-15 feet off the bottom. Most of the rest came on open flats at about 15 feet depth (tons of those in the Bay). A few came from the backs of smaller bays (again about 15 feet) Larger fish were often marked on the bottom at 20-25 feet and were completely inactive, even when live bait was literally dropped right in front of them (I watched it on my sonar). BTW, our last evening I had great fun with my sonar. I marked a small group of fish in 15 feet of water and dropped a lindy rig straight under the boat and could watch the fish swim up to the crawler(I could distinguish the crawler from the sinker). I lost more than I caught because I was working more on sonar data than paying attention to my line. Anyway, the pike fishing was good, and even though we didn't spend much time fishing for them on purpose, we caught a lot on the chartruese crawler harnesses, with a few in the 35"" class. At least one 40+ fish was caught by a guy in the camp. We did get a few smallies in the bay, which was a suprise because we'd heard there were no smallies in the lake. Maybe they got wildcatted and are starting to establish themselves. Despite my recent experience I believe Baril Bay is a good walleye area, but I don't know how it compares to the rest of the lake. From what I understand focus on the various narrows in the Bay and around the islands, especially in the stretch between Birch Narrows and Grassy Narrows. Also, points at the mouths of smaller bays produce a lot of the fish. There are a lot of reefs not shown on the various topo maps too. Don't overlook the flats, however - more than half our walleyes came when we trolled between ""spots"". We didn't actually use bouncers, but we let our weights tick bottom infrequently - the fish were in no mood to come up to an offering more than a couple feet above them. In the Bay most, if not all, of the boating hazards are marked which is a big bonus for a tourist like me. Some other lessons learned: 1. On this trip, Gulp! did NOT outfish live bait. Zero walleyes on Gulp! (Pike don't seem to mind it). 2. Do not use a surgeon's loop with Vanish, tie a swivel to the end of your rigs. Other than that, I did okay using vanish. 3. Do not use uni knots with knot-accepting steel leader material, use a palomar and knot the tag and/or glue it. 4. Walleyes don't seem to care if your spinner snells are tied with wire, and you'll have a lot less biteoffs from pike. I got that advice from someone on this board. I can't remember who - but thanks. Don't know if a half dozen fish's worth of pike slobber deters the walleyes, maybe it would be better to just let them bite off, but I got real tired of going through a dozen rigs per day. Not enough time to reload that many after supper. 5. A jaw spreader was worth the $2 investment. 6. A package of Wet Ones or the equivalent are real handy in the boat."
550245,Guest,2005-07-11 06:56:00,0,"The first three days of our fishing trip was like you explained,bad weather and not to many fish.On tuesday we caught walleyes for the last three hours of the day.The rest of the week was good fishing."
