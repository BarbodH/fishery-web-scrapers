Lac Seul is a factory, and the slot limit works great. Get a guide a few days when you are fishing it for the first time, and make sure that the guide takes you to different places each day. You will wave at Eagle Lake as you make the turn North onto 105 from now on!"

550814,Guest,2005-07-29 16:54:00,0,"Dave10 I have fished a number of lakes in NW Ontario, about 15 years ago did a week at Eagle for 3 years straight. Then moved to a different resort for about 5 years before going to Lac Seul for the last 6 years. First of all, in my opinion every Canadian experience is a great one. Just got back from a week in Northern WI, and while the fishing is fine, nothing compares to virtually any NW Ontario lake for quality, numbers and ability to get away from the folks that love personal watercraft and water skiing. I am sure every lake in NW Ontario has it fans, we switch from Eagle because while we could catch 30 - 40 walleyes a day per person, 90% of them would be no better than a really good cigar. The bass fishing was always the savior and the Pike were always plentiful and nice size (nothing huge) just nice. However, its the walleyes that we go for. Since my first trip to Lac Seul, we have been hooked. We go to a great place in the middle section of the lake and while we will not catch any muskies (that is what Wisconsin is for), the walleye fishing is nothing short of special. I know the stories of 100+ fish per day, and yes that can happen, but the reality is most days it does not, but an truly normal day where we go is 50 fish, half of which are slot or better. Every week we have been there we do hit one or more of those days when 100 fish happens. Don't expect it each day and you will be happy. While I personally don't find the pike as plentiful as Eagle, I find they are bigger (perhaps because where we are there are no muskie). The bass fishing is not as good as parts of Eagle, but again, they seem to be bigger. I go with one of my kids (son that is 13 or daughter that is 9) and its a great lake for kids because they get hooked on fishing because the action is steady and enough really good fish to shake the wrist and arm a bit. If you go, I do recommend a resort with guides for either the whole trip or the first couple of days. Lac Seul is lake know for eating props if you don't know where your going, and while everywhere looks fishy, remember 10% of the water holds 90% of the fish. Lac Suel has something that Eagle (at least where we fished) does not, huge sandbars and hold tons of fish, especially in the summer, and it does help to have guide to put you on fish. If you get a guide, make sure its one that is on the water every day because my experience has been the patterns change pretty quickly up there and you have to keep moving until you find the schools if you want one of those 100+ fish days. Best of luck with your decision. If you have any questions or want more info, fire away. Eagle is a great lake too, and I am sure many people find it terrific. IA Walleye"

550863,Guest,2005-07-30 11:22:00,0,"here is a topic worth talking about unlike never ending topics like people fishing on top of one another. I have fished both lakes and there is no question that both are beautiful pieces of water. I had a good time on Eagle 2 years ago and we found that it really depended on the time of day that you fished. We do not mind getting up with the sun if it means you can catch fish, but I go with myin-laws and we go to bed when the sun sets and don't drink as heavily as if I would go with old college buddies. These low light times were the only times we could catch any numbers of fish and the biggest ones were around 21"". Now on Lac Suel you will find many more fish (walleyes) in many more spots and more concentrated in those spots. also there are many more quality walleyes to be caught. Hands down in my opinion Lac Seul is clearly superior for walleyes. 100 fish days, I don't really know what peolpe mean by that (boat or person). Every time we've been up there (twice a year for the last 3 years)our boat gets over 100 walleyes per day (2-4 people). Some days we get close or over 100 person but only when we are really working for them. But never have we not caught 30 or less per person a day. Now when it comes to Muskies I think Eagle probably has a quality in numbers advantage but I have not tried really hard for muskies on Lac seul. have caught a 46"" muskie on Lac Seul and seen pictures of over 50"" fish. All smallies we have caught have been pigs on Lac Suel. We have never caught one less then 14"". And the northerns are of very good size and fairly good numbers. Now I don't know about resort quality. I know Eagle has some very posh outfits and if this is what you're after than Eagle is the place. But we go to fish and that's it and so Lac Seul is nothing short of spectacular every time we go. We're going in 2 weeks on a houseboat out of Hudson and this is the side of LS we fish. To be exact but general we boat up the lake about 35-40 miles each day to spots we would normally fish out of the houseboat on. Great times, can't wait until we go back."

550800,Guest,2005-07-29 11:37:00,0,"Would be hard pressed to find a lake in NW Ontario that I would call a trash-heap...especially one as beautiful as Eagle (the only lake in NW ontario with verifiable muskies caught over 60#'s....also very rare for a lake to have all 5 major species in one water body). To each his own I suppose. You may be referring to some of those lakes south of the 49th parallel in the ""trash heap"" category. Lac Suel would appear to be a great destination if you are looking for more #'s of walleye...can't comment on the other aspects of what makes a good trip..."

550803,Guest,2005-07-29 13:26:00,0,"Thanks much for everyone's replies - please keep 'em coming. In response to Ben, I hear you on the multiple species. However, I guess the bottom line is that when you spend significant time and dollars on a 12-14 hour drive for a week's fishing once a year, you'd like decent numbers of decent fish. I actually feel like one of the lucky ones on Eagle, when I hear people at the lodge describing the fact that they caught ""a couple of northerns and bass"" for the day, and that's it. I'm all for a challenge, but when you put in an honest 11 or 12 hours of fishing in a day among three guys, you expect lots of fish in the boat, and 40 to 50 seems low - it seems more like what I could get with the equivalent amount of work here in SE Wisconsin. Thanks again, everybody."

550809,Guest,2005-07-29 14:47:00,0,"I've fished both. My first Canadian trip was to Eagle lake. On Eagle we cought a fair amount of fish 50+ eyes (mostly in the 13"" to 18"" range) per boat with three guys, I had fun although I was a little disapointed, seems your hopes are always bigger than reality. A year or 2 later we decided to go to Lac Suel first we went to Sioux Lookout and the last couple of years we've been going to Ear Falls. Before going to Lac Suel I read all the stories about billion fish days. I can honestly tell you tha my personal expectation when I go now is a minimum of 50 fish (myself) per day, most days no problem while others its tough. It's hard to compare really, weather and time of year play such a role. I have some friends that would never think of fishing anything but Eagle, of course thats the first Canadian lake they tried and never changed. They like the fishing and they love the resort (Temple) my thoughts"

550790,Guest,2005-07-29 09:29:00,0,"Help!! My two sons and I have gone to Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle for the last five years. We love the service, food, and accomodations. However, our daily catch numbers seem to go down each year, despite the fact that we now know the lake well. We always go the third week of July. We never average more than one or two slot walleyes a day, and maybe one over for each trip. The past two years, we've averaged less than fifty fish in the boat per day (walleye, northern and bass). Those numbers seem low. I've heard all sorts of wild stories of the 150-plus fish days on Lac Seul, and of course I'm interested. Anyone have any thoughts for us on whether to make the change and, if so, where to go on Lac Seul? Maybe the LS stories are exaggerated, and maybe we're doing par for the course on Eagle? I just need some guidance. Thanks!!"

550792,Guest,2005-07-29 09:39:00,0,I have not fished eagle lake for a number of years. I have been to lac seul for the last 42 years. You may not hit 150 a day but if you are a decent fisherman you will certainly outfish eagle easily. You will get many in the slot and probable quite a few over slot. 28+ are a little more difficult but they are sure there. You are very close to Ear Falls area from eagle lake. Plenty of Lodges to choose from. good luck.

550793,Guest,2005-07-29 09:41:00,0,The Tales of hundreds of fish per day on Lac Seul are verifiable. If you stay on top of the patterns of the fish you could easily have an entire week of days with over 100 fish per boat. If you are cathing 50 per day on a Trash Heap of a lake like Eagle i think you would do really well on Seul. Give it a go and you will never return Eagle! D
