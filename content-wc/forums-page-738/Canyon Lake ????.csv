Looking at going somewhhere on sept.16th for a muskie trip but would like to fish walleyes and smallmouth also, and personally my experience on Eagle that same week was not very good. Yeah, the muskies were hot but nothing else. We are also looking at doing a little grouse hunting. Thank You to all who reply. Brown"
