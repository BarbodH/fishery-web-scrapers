550701,Guest,2005-07-25 15:28:00,0,We have fished there three different times and besides the fishing being awesome ( lots and big) and the service being great the thing I like the best is......boat traffic is limited to Ojibway boats because they are so far away from all other lodges. It is like being on a fly in without the airplane. Another plus is it is the best part of Lac Seul to catch a Muskie in and some big Walleye and Pike. The west shore of Lac Seul is good fishing but a lot of boat traffic and thats not my cup of tea.
550744,Guest,2005-07-27 07:27:00,0,I have heard a lot of great things about fishing Chamberlain Narrows. There are several websites that say it is the best place to catch a Muskie on Lac Seul. Do you guys who have been there agree with that and if so what kind of luck have you had fishing for Muskie there?
550752,Guest,2005-07-27 09:41:00,0,I have been there at least 6 times and agree that the boat traffic is little and the fishing is amazing. Unfortunately $130.00 a night U.S. for a bunk with no bedding and free ice is pretty expensive. I don't know if they have docking now or not but it used to be beach docking.
550764,Guest,2005-07-27 15:03:00,0,Been there myself.....and the Fishing Is AWESOME. Best I have ever seen in Ontario.
550870,Guest,2005-07-30 15:09:00,0,"Mike- What did they charge for a gallon of gas up at their resort? Just curious, as we are heading up there next week. Thanks."
550873,Mike Kansas,2005-07-30 16:23:00,1463,"I dont know for sure. I think it is around $5 US. I expected to pay more for the extras than we did since they have to transport everything so far. If this is your first time there you will really enjoy it. It is a very scenic setting and the Owners and employees bend over backwards to make sure your stay is awesome. Ask about fishing Scaler Lake . We did very well there, it is easy to get to and if you run all the way up to the end and fish the fast water there are some nice fish to be caught. My wife and I caught many Walleye over the slot in and below the fast water on Minnow/Jig and Leech/Jig."
550874,Guest,2005-07-30 16:34:00,0,"Can the owners of the camp get into their resort from logging roads? On a satalite map, it looks like a road goes right up to the resort."
550875,Mike Kansas,2005-07-30 16:42:00,1463,Dont believe they can. Everything I saw them bring in was by boat. Never saw a vehicle that would be used for transporting any goods.
550674,Mike Kansas,2005-07-24 20:12:00,1463,Just returned from Ojibway Outfitters at Chamberlain Narrows on Lac Seul. This was our first time at this resort and we had a very enjoyable stay. The cabins and the service are great and the owners and their employees all work hard to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The Resort is very isolated and the boat traffic is limited only to people at the camp. Fishing for Walleye and Pike was excellent and it did not require us to travel very far to catch all the fish we wanted. This was important to us since our group of four included our wives. My wife and both of the people in the other couple caught personal records for size of fish in both the Walleye species and Northren Pike. I have been fishing Canada since 1955 and fishing Lac Seul since 1985 and would highly recommend Ojibway to anybody who wants to have a great time fishing and relaxing in a beautiful setting.

550678,Mike Kansas,2005-07-24 22:11:00,1463,Im getting used to it. My excuse lies in the fact that in her mind I'm the World's Greatest Guide!!!!
550685,Hump,2005-07-25 08:19:00,578,Do they have a website?

550687,Big Fish,2005-07-25 08:48:00,138,You say she caught one bigger than the one at Evergreen? SWEEEEET. cw
550688,Guest,2005-07-25 09:21:00,0,How much did they charge you a night to stay there?
550690,Guest,2005-07-25 09:58:00,0,"They are expensive compared to other Lac Seul housekeeping resorts. It will run you about $1000 for a week if you use their boats, and about $800 if you use your own boat. With that $1000, you do not get any gas package or minnows. Everything is extra. That being said, I tried to book them this year, and they were booked all summer. Their only opening was in May or Last week of August. They stay booked up because of repeat business, so they must be worth it. I will try them again next year."
550691,Mike Kansas,2005-07-25 10:10:00,1463,"Bigfish, She caught a Walleye that was 32"" which is 1/2"" bigger than the one she caught at Evergreen last year. She also caught a 39"" Pike on a jig/leech combo. Going to be another long winter listening to her subtle comments about her superiority. Caught the Walleye in 27' of water on a jig/minnow .....it was a beauty. Caught several other nice Walleye deep but had best luck with numbers of Walleye in 15' to 20' of water. Hope you are having a great fishing summer and stay safe on the big water."
550692,Mike Kansas,2005-07-25 10:24:00,1463,They are are little more expensive than other house keeping Resorts but they are so remote that they have a higher operating cost due to obtaining supplys. I felt the prices were very fair and we are planning on going back next year in June if we can clear our schedule.
