Since it was apparent the carriers were immune, there was no way to tell if they were infected or not. Please obey all laws when you visit our country or stay home. Wouldn't you expect the same from us when we visit Florida? I've never been outfished by anyone using leeches anyway."
550902,Guest,2005-08-01 07:49:00,0,"I'd take the risk. If they ask you be sure and say"" no sir no live bait with me"" then if they search and find your leaches blame it on the other guys. The custom guys love a good joke."
550908,multispecies,2005-08-01 09:11:00,29,"Keep your leeches at home....it's the law of the land.....no different than me taking oranges over the border.. as for border lakes .....well, we share them, and we will share the difficulties."
550936,dutchboy,2005-08-01 17:50:00,5717,Bring all the leeches and pot you can carry. If and when customs gets you we won't need to worry about you for quite some time. Don't worry about your family the welfare system in this country is great. If by some chance you do get across the border catch and keep all the fish possible. Be sure to complain about how long a border crossing takes and why do they ask these stupid questions. Any other intellegent questions?

550876,Guest,2005-07-31 05:17:00,0,have a place in ohio about 17$$ a pound for jumbos schould i take a chance or pay 30 a pound in canada and wont be jumbos jake
550878,Guest,2005-07-31 06:12:00,0,I wouldn't take the chance. If you're going to Canada to relax & unwind why take the chance of a border crossing conflict when you can easily avoid it? I think you should abide by their country's laws while in their country. Enjoy your trip!!:)
550879,Hawker,2005-07-31 06:37:00,3967,"Ohhhhhhhhh,,,the laws and rules were written and put in place for all the ""other"" folks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,right?? Sure, it's worth the risk as long as you got lots of time to spend at the border trying to explain you didn't know the law blah blah blah and hopefully you'd get fined a big chunk of change to boot!! What would you tell your own kids if they asked you about taking something to school they were not supposed to????? Hope ya get caught!!!!!!!!!!"
550882,Jimmy Jig,2005-07-31 08:22:00,1905,"Last year when I was stop by the warden, he wanted to see the receipt for the leeches! Well I had it at the cabin with some other receipt, etc. He told me to carry with my lience from now on to prove that I purchased in Canada."
550883,Guest,2005-07-31 09:13:00,0,"About five years ago, some friends of mine were crossing the border in an RV. They had 6 guys and were over something like 10 cases of beer. They told the guy they were not over, and upon being searched, were busted for the overage. They confiscated the beer, and issued citations for every case over. It cost around $35 per case. The also had their RV confiscated. The RV never moved. They just told him it was confiscated. They then had to pay over $100 to get it un-confiscated. All of the tickets were issued to the owner of the RV, who was asleep when they hit the border. All told, it cost them hours at the border, plus hundreds of dollars. And they had to buy beer to replace beer. I would assume that leeches would cost you about the same. Don't be cheap. You may get away with it, but at some point you will get caught."
550885,515,2005-07-31 10:06:00,254,"Leave them home. The reason we have the rules is to keep the new species from being introduced the lakes up here and possibly upsetting the balance of a good thing. Have you not heard of Zebra Mussels or Gobies and the damage they are doing to our lakes. The rules are in place for a reason. I'm not trying to be hard on you for this, but we have a good thing going and want to protect it. Thanks Mike"
550886,Hump,2005-07-31 10:19:00,578,"Right after Ontario put this law into effect I saw Minnesota delivery trucks at Ontario bait shops. Is this still the case? If so, shoots disease out of the water and goes to the almighty buck. I would hope for the disease control as i haven't seen any trucks the past two years."
550887,Guest,2005-07-31 11:49:00,0,"I question the disease aspect of the law because on Basswood Lake or Rainy Lake if you stay on the Minnesota side of the imaginery ""border"" which divides the U.S. from Canada you can use ""American leeches"" but on the Canadian side of the SAME LAKE they are illegal. Somehow if somebody tips a leech container into the water I doubt the leeches know which side of the lake to stay on:). I still wouldn't bring leeches across the border, the risk of ruining a trip just isn't worth it."
550889,Guest,2005-07-31 12:53:00,0,"This has to be one of the least intelligent questions posted on this board. I would hope you can answer your own question, or stay home."
