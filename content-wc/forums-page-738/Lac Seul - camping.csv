551035,Guest,2005-08-03 21:06:00,0,"Moose, Read Wildcat's post a little closer, he said he charges for the use of his cabin. That is illegal. If he were letting his buddy use it for nothing, no big deal. But renting it our 8 weeks a year? Wildcat, are you charging GST and PST on your rental? I think I can answer that one for you, no. So it is definately illegal."

550959,wooglin,2005-08-02 10:10:00,371,My group is entertaining new areas of Lac Seul. We want to camp. We have our own boats and gear. Just a place to set up camp. Water/Elec. would be nice. Any suggestions? Resorts are fine. Campgrounds are fine. Anywhere on the water on the Lac Seul system is preferred. Thanks!
550964,Guest,2005-08-02 11:23:00,0,Have camped at GooseBay Camp for the last 5 years. It is located up by Ear Falls. Have sites with e/w/s and a bath house for showers and bathroom. You can dock your boat for a fee which includes elect for your battery charger.
550967,MN_Moose,2005-08-02 16:03:00,965,I've never camped up there but I've considered it. 1) www.freemap.ca (800) 465-7101 get free map of resorts in area 2) Timber Edge camp 800-768-8588 3) Country Camping & Cabins 800-946-8244 These are all near Sioux Lookout
550982,Guest,2005-08-02 23:33:00,0,"i have rented our cabin out to folks of the same likes in years past. we are about 5 mins east of hudson on 664. i fish lac suel out of lost lake from the hudson boat ramp or deception bay on the other side of sioux lookout. give me a shout directly if that is what you are looking for. if not, i know quite a few of the lodges around here and can set you up if you are looking for something a little more catered.[email protected]"
550983,Guest,2005-08-03 04:54:00,0,"If you are looking at the Ear Falls area there are several camps offering full service campgrounds. Call the chamber of comerce or check out several travel associations that have great references. Sunset country out of Kenora, Patricia Regional Tourist council out of Dryden. Good luck on your search and welcome to Canada. I hope you do not look at a boot leg operaton as mentioned above."

550989,Guest,2005-08-03 07:13:00,0,"He is refering to Wildcat's post. It is probably illegal, unlikely he has a Tourist Outfitters License."
550994,wooglin,2005-08-03 08:01:00,371,"Is this illegal, say, if he were to let a friend use his cabin for a fee?"
550999,Guest,2005-08-03 08:20:00,0,"Illegal? I do not run a camp or have a license but I do live in Indiana and have a cabin outside of souix lookout that we have had many good years at. a few years back a fella at the boat ramp asked to rent it because he had is own boat, wanted to do things his own way and since they just raised our taxes on the place 7 fold the year before i said sure. i called a few guys who ran adds in minnesota and wisconsin outdoor magizines on what to offer and what to charge and now i rent the place about 8 weeks a year to others of the same likes. Works for me because it keeps the locals from breaking in so much as the place set vacant for periods of time in past and almost covers costs to keep it open and the improvments i made to it as suggested by those who have rented it. everybody is entitled to their opinion though and if you think that i should not help a fishing buddy out by telling him what lures and the spots to fish them up here, or letting him borrow my boat to get there, or setting him up with a place of his own to do so, then i guess i wont."
551000,Guest,2005-08-03 08:27:00,0,"One other thing you might take into consideration as well, call it fate or call it what you will but the year before we got the place from an old lady whose husband died next door to one of our fishing buddies, we stayed at a licensed camp and had an incredibly bad experience that we paid top dollar for. lodge would not fly in food, gas, minnows or beer. we caught just enough pike to live on. i have had dozens incredible experiences to make up for it and some of my closest freinds up there now are lodge owners. my guests and i rent boats from them, buy souveniers from them and enjoy life together with them. so i would say i support your comments in being informed about what you sign up for."
