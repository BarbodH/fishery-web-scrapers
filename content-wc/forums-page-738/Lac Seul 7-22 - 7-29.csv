550912,NateW,2005-08-01 10:18:00,96,"Just got back from Lac Seul on Friday (7/29). It was a pretty frustrating week. A cold front moved in, scattered the fish and the weather played havoc on us all week. We never really had one day when we really hammered the fish. We'd hit a spot, catch two or three fish, then the spot would go dry. Move to another, catch a quick two or three, then nothing. Granted, if we had been catching this amount of fish in Iowa or even MN or WI we would have been pretty happy, but our expectations from previous trips had us believing we ""should"" have caught more. We spent most of the week in long pants, sweatshirts, and rain gear. The lake was rough and we seemed to get beat to death each day boating to and from camp. Even though we got off the lake Thursday evening I was still battling with ""sea legs"" as late as Saturday afternoon. Most everyone in camp seemed to have about the same luck as us or better. We seemed to be hitting all the good spots a day later than we should have. The weather was the big thing. We actually wore stocking caps a couple days and on the morning we left the thermometer on the Yukon said 34 degrees--and it wasn't reading in Celsius! South Bay, South Inlet, Broad Lake, Sunlight Lake, McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands they all were marginal producers for us. Nothing like we'd done in the past. Our best day was drifting jigs over Manitoba point. We were in 18  20 feet of water and the fish were suspended at about 10  12 feet. The best colors were pink and a Chartreuse/lime jig head with a white twister tail and tipped with a minnow. This worked well one day, but next day the wind had switched pretty drastically and we could never really find a good school after that. Like everyplace else it was hit and miss after that. We tried dragging spinners, pulling crankswe even plopped some slip-bobbers next to some weedbeds, the results were always the same, a couple quick fish, then nothing. I was somewhat surprised but the subtlety of the bite as well. Not at what was normal for LS. You really had to pay attention or you would miss fish. This was our first year staying at Onaway Lodge. Blair and Kathy are great hosts. Blair gave us more information about the lake that we'd ever received before. The cabins are fins, the equipment is in great shape. The dock and fish cleaning facilities are the nicest I have seenand they are still making improvements. We're more than content to keep coming back to this camp again and again. Looks like the weather started getting nicer as soon as we left, but if your trip is coming up, throw some long underwear and a stocking cap in your duffel just in case. Despite having to work harder for fish than we're used to, we still had an awesome time. Our group has a saying, ""We're not exactly here for the fishing "" and this year was no exception. (Awesome prank on this year's new guybut that's a whole new thread!) Already looking forward to 2006. Only 348 more days to go .."

Last year during a cold slam like you mentioned, out of desperation we tried pulling boards that just happened to be on the boat from fishing LBDN. We did real well by following the shoreline contour, but out in 20-40'. The ""Glass Minnow"" husky jerk was HOT. It is white, shows up good in the stained water. Fish were anywhere from 5-15' deep. We used both shallow and deep versions. Bites were not slams, just a slow drop back. Didn't get up there this year, but I'll bet there is an untouched population of suspended fish. The fish we caught were large. Good Luck"

We started with coats and long underwear, ended with temps in the 90's. As far as caughting 100 walleyes a day I never have. But once someone posts 100, no one wants to omit they cann't equal that. I never have seem a post about 80 or 86 or 93?, its always 100. Its possible on a given day, but i doubt it happens ever day."
