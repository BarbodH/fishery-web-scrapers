I noticed the water was down better then a foot in most areas and was wondering if you think the drought had affected the fishing? I have been fishing the area for many years around the end of July and this is the first time I can ever remember being there with a drought going on this bad. I had good luck fishing but it did seem much slower then normal. The walleye action was real slow and the Northerns were not as hot and heavy as normal. Any one been up and noticed this? Oh yeah No open fires so take a cook stove for shore lunch Good luck to all going up! Tom"

Fishing has been good, this week has been one of the better weeks of fishing for walleye with good sized fish being taken. Have a group this week that has caught 28-27-26-26-26-24-22, with a good number of eaters thrown in. With the warm weather, the big pike action has been limited, they are hunkered down deep. But it should bode well for a dynamite fall, for pike. All the best, Agate"

Logging has been stopped for weeks now and if any heat lightning in area it will be major fire problems. The fish seem much more scattered, and close lipped. But amount of minnows and crayfish seen seems to be up, so perhaps they have all the food they want with the conditions keeping bait happy. Come on Rain !!!!! jake"
