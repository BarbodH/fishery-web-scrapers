We will be staying at Cedar Lake Lodge. Will the cold spring push things back? We will mainly be fishing for Walleye, Bass, Crappie, and Perch and welcome any advice on techniques or baits on Cedar. I plan on taking him up into Perrault Lake for a day or two and wondered if both lakes fish pretty much the same?"

I know it is a bit of money but to ensure a great trip for you and your son it would be a good investment. If you go it on your own you run the risk of losing very valuable vacation days figuring out the pattern and spots. My two cents... Brett"

6178825,nitroman,2018-05-07 20:16:00,368,Talk to Al about whats working and what the patterns are when you get there! He has been there for years and will want to help get you on fish asap. Lodge owners are a great asset as they gleen info from guests thru the week to help other guests catch fish. If they are doing it right they will be able to help you out! We will be there that week as well but we stay at Cedar Point Resort. If you want we can meet up early in the week and give you some help as well. Been fishing the lake for a lot of years and have a few spots that we like. Prefer not to disclose here in public as it tends to go viral and soon our good spots are everyones good spots eh! Definitely talk to Al though!
6178833,valley366,2018-05-07 20:31:00,193,"We were there 2 years ago, dates were about 9-16 June. We did not hire a guide and we struggled for the first few days. I recommend you hire one. If he allows you take your GPS and mark waypoints in the area that you are successful.The word we learned after a couple of days is the East half of the lake is where the fish are early in the season. Attached are pictures with areas that we were the most successful. We were fishing with kids so we were looking for more action then size. The little bays on the south portion of the East Basin produced fish for us regularly. A lot of 12 to 16 inch fish but we were catching them regularly so did not change up. If I remember correctly those bays are only 9-11 feet deep.They like light jigs on that lake. 1/8 ounce was the size of choice. I think we ran through a bunch of the parrot color but white was another popular choice. Only time we went bigger was the time we spent out in the deeper water.Good luck."
6180210,BornToFish,2018-05-08 15:45:00,1224,"Greetings,I am very familiar with Perrault Lake. The average ice out for the last twenty years is about 08 May. Even though it seems like a cold spring, things are about on track to hit the average. The weather during the next several weeks will determine how the fishing will be for the original poster. I concur that the original poster might be wise to consider hiring a guide for the first day or two to learn a few spots to fish during his week on the lake, but more importantly to learn effective techniques - HOW to fish.I learned many years ago that weight of jig often trumps color of jig on Perrault and Cedar Lakes. Fishing with too heavy of a jig often leads to too heavy of rod/line in order to feel the jig, the bite and the bottom of the lake. If so, bites will be missed.I do not encourage the original poster to take a day to fish on Perrault Lake. Perrault Lake is considerably deeper and colder than Cedar Lake, thus the lakes fish somewhat differently. I believe that Cedar Lake is the more straightforward lake to fish. Perrault Lake can be difficult for a newcomer to learn, even though it's an outstanding fishery. Walleyes in Perrault Lake are normally in transition from shoreline to rock humps near shore during early to mid June. Knowing the location of these structures is important to fishing success. The walleye bite in Perrault Lake is normally an early morning and just-before dark affair. Thus, it will be difficult to travel from Cedar Lake to Perrault Lake to fish during prime time.Traveling from Cedar Lake to Perrault Lake is a very nice boat ride and might well be worth the scenery. Be cautious when passing near the burnt bridge for unmarked hazards.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

It was close to the middle of the passage, an unexpected place, sort of, to be. Just to be aware, it looked pretty solid. Bill"
6182778,sgeisz,2018-05-09 16:06:00,15,I have been fishing Cedar Lake for last 6 years and we stay at Darren and merris Cedar lake camp and our first year we did get a guide. Very inexpensive and all 7 of us went and he only charged $200.00 and 20 for each extra boat and is was well worth it. Our enormous success year to year was because that guide showed us where to fish and then marked our maps so we would have it year to year. We will be going over in two weeks over Memorial day weekend. The guide was charlie but he is not doing it anymore but your resort owner will have a contact as I believe they work back and forth between the resorts on Cedar. Good luck

We have been going to Cedar lake for several years now and have our favorite spots, but always interested to hear of how fishing is and where they are biting."
