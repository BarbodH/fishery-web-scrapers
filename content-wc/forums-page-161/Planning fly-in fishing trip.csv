6197944,[email protected],2018-05-21 17:32:00,3,We are planning a fly in fishing trip with Wesley Outpost out of Pickle Lake. Does anyone have experience with Wesley and can you give me any feedback?

6198132,phishfearme,2018-05-22 05:43:00,1242,agree with larryS - mediocre - at best - fishing on kech but we did have extremely hot weather (not a real excuse though - the fish only feel water temp - not air temp) and extremely high water - kech is a minor widening where three major rivers combine. you may want to try yates lake upstream of kech. Charles is a very nice guy and the cabin at kech is excellent - but the lake is not all that good for a flyin lake - we found many nets at major pinch points but that was at least 10 years ago and I would think that the fish population should have recovered by now. if you go - please post a report. phish
6198256,[email protected],2018-05-22 08:59:00,3,Thanks for the info. Yates was one of the options has anyone fished their? I have gone to Zig Zag lake with Wilderness North 6 times and wanted to try some place new. Has anyone been there more recently and know if they are still doing a lot of netting? Thanks
6198350,phishfearme,2018-05-22 12:09:00,1242,"as a post script, the nets we did see there were hanging in old dilapidated cabins at two major narrows where walleye run/spawn in the spring. they were quite old and heavily worn - but that doesn't mean new ones aren't carried in and out each year. maybe ask Charles how the fish netting has been and evaluate his response. the yates/kech area is the region given to Charles as an adult male member of his Ojibwa tribe. he has all hunting, trapping and fishing rights there and has opted to do a bit of ""entrepreneurship"" by building and renting cabins for fishing and hunting. I met him at a pheasant run all Canada show and it was a pleasure to talk with him and his enthusiasm in starting in the outfitter business made me decide to book a trip with him. netting though conflicts with sport fishing. I hope you go with Charles and please report back. phish"

6199842,lenray,2018-05-25 06:02:00,467,"Received a call from the stolen boat owner. I shared info. of where I was told the boat was stashed. He was grateful, but said it may be too expensive to get the boat back up into Ketch-Yates if they can find it on Horseshoe Lake. He said they pull them up there with snowmobiles..............."
