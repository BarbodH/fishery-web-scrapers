6200300,Mojo-NC,2018-05-26 09:15:00,1929,I remember reading a post last week where it was mentioned that a specific sunscreen also worked as a good insect repellent. For the life of me I can't remember what brand it was and I can't seem to find where it was posted. A little help please. Does anyone recall what it was? We leave for Canada next Friday and I was hoping to get some before we go.
6200306,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-26 09:23:00,608,We have found two products that work reasonably well 1. Repel Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent 2. Coppertone Sport in the spray can.
