I use a Garmin combo unit as a fish finder but it does not accept Navionics cards. But, I am told an app exists for Apple products (IPhones and I Pads) where specific lakes can be downloaded and used when at that lake. I have both an I pad and I Phone but am not overly tech savy. Can someone tell me about this technology? Its 15.00 to download the app. Does one then have to but regions or specific lakes? What would be the approx. cost to obtain a series of Canadian lakes? I'm told these units work off GPS so cell service in not needed. I have a few months before we leave and I'd like to obtain this information and understand how to use it prior to leaving. I wrote the website but have not received an answer. There is a U tube video which peaked my curiosity but did not answer my basic questions. Thanks in advance."

6129274,MikeG1,2018-04-12 16:14:00,433,"Thanks Will. I was able to obtain good information and the program. So everyone knows: 1. Navionics programs can be used on any Apple device. 2. If you want the ability to locate yourself on the screen you need a device with cellular capability. 3. You can use a non- cellular device but it will only give you the map, not locate you on the map. 4. Naturally all cell phones have cellular capabilities, my IPad does not. 5. You do not need cell service. Units with cellular capabilities have a GPS that is used. 6. There are 3 programs to download, more if You out want international waters. 7. One program is free, but does not give sonar charts. 8. The 2 other programs are US for 9.99 or US and Canada for 14.99. 9. I downloaded the US Canada program and my lake shows up on my phone clear and crisp. I'm looking to use this information to fish interesting areas I never knew existed. My next challenge will be battery life, but I have some ideas. Again, thanks to all who responded. Feel free to contact me if you have questions."
6198872,farmnfish,2018-05-23 09:39:00,130,"just saw this older thread so i thought I'd offer my experience with navionics apps.I've been using navionics US&Canada for about 5 years now on an Android device. I doubt its greatly different from the apple version. You can locate yourself on a map with no cell service. You can down load maps of where you're fishing while you have internet access then use them where you don't. Drop way points, track your whole days fishing for later reference, works great and a low cost solution.The only reasonI can think of that you wouldn't be able to locate yourself with out cell service is if the device itself did not have on board gps."
6199062,martinbns,2018-05-23 14:37:00,1520,"All the Apple products have built in GPS. My wife has it and plays around with it, works well although we don't really use it as up here your only real options for mapping is Navionics."
6199270,youngknight,2018-05-23 21:56:00,228,All iPhones have built in gps...only iPhones with cellular capability do...most iPads do not. Can be paired with an external gps device thru Bluetooth though.
6199272,youngknight,2018-05-23 21:57:00,228,"Meant to say,,,only IPADS with cellular capability as of course all iPhones do have cellular capability."
6199648,valley366,2018-05-24 15:17:00,193,I believe you are all correct on the GPS capability of the Apple products. They require cell service to locate your position. Look at the manufacturer website and specs to see if it GPS is listed. I know I have tried my wife's non cell capable IPAD and it has not worked.Android tablets on the other hand have built in GPS antenna's. I have a Samsung tablet that I love and gets great GPS location no matter where I am at.Came across the below article on a quick google search. Don't know if it helps you or not.https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3950259
