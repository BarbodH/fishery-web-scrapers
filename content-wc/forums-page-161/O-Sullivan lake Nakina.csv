We are 100% jigging with plastic Guys. Hoping to get a little bit of in-tell on color and style of plastic for this lake. Man if anyone can help us out it would be a great help as I,m looking to place some orders for jigs and plastics. Our second boat of guys will be bottom bouncing all week. So any suggestions here would be a great help getting set up. Feel free to E-mail me. We have good in-tell that this is a fantastic walleye fisherie and will be our second trip to nakina in a 3 week period. Been doing Nakina fly-ins for the last 8 years and its a fantastic area. Thank you in advance....Halfmoon Linden Michigan"
