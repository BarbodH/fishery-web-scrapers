6199610,SteveZ,2018-05-24 14:00:00,271,Please disregard last post. I didn't think it was possible but I found a place available for 9 guys same dates. Sorry.
6194225,RRK285,2018-05-15 10:31:00,44,"Just called to confirm our rooms for Friday 6/15 at AmericInn and they dont have our reservation. Stayed here for the last 7 years, wtf ? Anyone have any extra for 6/15 ? Anywhere?"
6194361,prov1900,2018-05-15 12:05:00,544,"Curious, did you reserve on line or through 1-800 number? Or reserve direct with hotel? I always call the 218 number and have never had issues. I'm a little surprised they are booked. We are there next Thursday."
6194508,RRK285,2018-05-15 13:14:00,44,"We always book when we check out, year after year"
6194602,Bakefish,2018-05-15 15:36:00,1077,"That happened to me one year, only I found out while I was trying to check in. I just called to confirm mine for the 1st. Thanks for the reminder. Sorry for your problems."
6194680,btyreprich,2018-05-15 18:11:00,1067,"This happened to us one year - my buddy and I each thought the other guy made the room reservations for Friday night. We ended up staying in Virginia at a Holiday Inn Express. Rey nice room but a bit expensive and not as close to the border as we would have liked. However it wa all we could find on such short notice. I'm thinking that your chances will be better th closer you stay near Duluth or Superior. For Friday night reservations, look on the internet for hotels and call the front desk direct. Take what you can at this point. Good luck on this."
6194760,nitroman,2018-05-15 20:37:00,368,Sioux Narrows Motel?
6194764,ElectricSlide19,2018-05-15 20:48:00,147,"Try Budget Host Inn, International Falls. Not the Ritz, but it might help a out. Its right across from the Super One right off 71. This is the phone number online (218) 283-2577. For some reason it keeps popping up as Knights Inn but thats not the name of it. Otherwise try the Copper River Inn across the border, thats the only other place I have stayed at."
6194786,Jesse-WI,2018-05-15 22:30:00,534,The Makabi Inn shows availability but not much is left.
6194920,rockape,2018-05-16 07:13:00,215,"I used to stay at the Tee Pee in IF, but they are closed now. I did book at the Northern Lights Motel at IF for 6/15. I had to change my dates and cancelled my reservation for 2 rooms on the 15th. Google them and give them a call. I cancelled last week."
6199556,SteveZ,2018-05-24 12:31:00,271,Did you find rooms? My trip just got cancelled and I have 4 rooms reserved at the Hilltop in International Falls.
