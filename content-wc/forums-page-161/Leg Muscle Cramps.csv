If I wake up with one I get out of bed get a glass of tonic water and go back to bed when able. Vitamins, bananas, hydration, and stretching might work for some but not for me."

When I wake up with leg cramps, I just eat a cpl heaping teaspoons of mustard. Within minutes you will feel your leg muscles relax. A friend at work told me this, she said she carried a few packets from mcdonalds in her purse all the time... I asked my doc, he claimed it was the mustard seed oil that is present in the mustard? Not sure why, but it does work."
6198198,Rock Hound,2018-05-22 07:43:00,51,"I coached football and wrestling for 30 years. I always took pride in my teams being in superior conditioning and we trained very hard to win in the 4th quarter / overtime if necessary.Near the end of my career, I had some kids (always the same kids) cramping during games (never in practice). After much questioning with those kids and their parents, I found out that they were all taking 5 Hour Energy before games! I worked with the kids and parents to put an end to that, and believe it or not, the leg cramps ended!Not sure if you deal with cramping on a normal basis, if so, I would recommend drinking tonic water (Canada Dry tonic water has quinine in it and that helps with cramps . . . Ginger Ale does not, but I saw that advised on a previous post). I have also heard wrestling coaches swear by the pickle juice, but wrestling cramps are almost always a result from dehydration from cutting weight.If you are only experiencing the cramping on your trip, I would take a real look at what you are drinking / eating. Are you drinking more caffeine than normal? Are you drinking energy drinks or a lot more alcohol than normal? - It really might be as simple as that.Once you cramp, you can cramp on and off for days and that could really dampen your trip.I do NOT recommend fishing less, but I do recommend preventing the cramps more than treating them by looking at what you might be eating or drinking that you normally don't.Stay hydrated, use sun screen, and be sensible about what you are eating and drinking.Good luck, and tight lines!"

That is just so very sad. I don't gamble at all - except for a $2.00 lottery ticket each week - so forgive me for asking this question. are the slot players that particular about a certain machine that they are afraid of loosing their seat? Pretty sure all slots are set to be in the houses favor.

Once the cramps start, it is much more difficult to ""catch up"". So particularly when headed up for a week fishing, or a golf tourny, or any other outdoor activity, I make sure I get my good fluid levels up AHEAD of time. Other wise it makes for a bad nights sleep. Gatorade, water, and bananas ( but no bananas in the boat) throughout the day and I am fine. Along with a bunch of toe touches.Oddly, the knee I had replaced a few years ago no longer gives me cramps."

I spent the last 40 plus years standing on concrete to work. Varicose veins run in my family , both sides. My doctor suggested vein ablation , so I had it done on both legs. Amazing , no night cramps. No burning in legs while walking either. I hunt some big hills and was amazed how much better I can walk. Simple procedure, as doctor runs a probe up vein from ankle . Worked the next day and had second leg done 2 weeks later. In between procedures and after second procedure, they did an ultrasound to check for blood clots. Surgeon said I would be much better off too , in my later years of life. He said the blood would go back to heart thru good veins and the blood that had no oxygen ,was just pooling in my bad veins . Like I said I am sure everyone is different. Just my situation."

I specifically referenced Gatorade but I really intended to mean any electrolyte replacement beverage. We gave our children Pedialyte when they were little and would get sick to make sure they didn't get dehydrated. I'm sure that would work just as well as anything as long as whatever you take contains the necessary electrolytes to replace what you've depleted. I hope from this discussion that we are able to keep someone from having to go through the cramping experience.

Anyway, I experienced one this past weekend from hiking in the mountains, playing yard games, and celebrating my son's college graduation. It reminded me to take precautions while in Canada, which is coming up in just a few weeks. I've found that drinking a Gatorade before bed every night virtually eliminates the problem.
