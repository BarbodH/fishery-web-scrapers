6199550,valley366,2018-05-24 12:26:00,193,Thanks for all the replies. After looking at the various vendors coverage maps I decided on a Verizon pay as you go phone. Picked Verizon as it appeared to have the best coverage for the drive up and possibly in camp.$90 got me a smart phone and a $50 card. If I remember I will post back on how well it did.
6199642,NARDA 1,2018-05-24 14:54:00,636,Did you check to make sure that there won't be any extra fees or roaming charges while in Canada? Those fees can really add up.
6199710,valley366,2018-05-24 18:51:00,193,My goal is to have it off and in the glove box. Only use it if something comes up. Maybe shoot a text to the wife to let her know we got to hotel and to the lodge. Other than then maybe sending an email to the wife with a couple pictures of the kids during the week that I do on my tablet with wifi.
6200118,JAY221,2018-05-25 15:56:00,877,"My verizon plan includes Canada as of about 2 months ago as standard. Pretty easy to check on their Verizonwireless.com web page. Later,Jay"
6198824,valley366,2018-05-23 08:54:00,193,"Going up in a couple weeks. Only carry a work cell phone and cannot bring it along. Looking for people that have purchased a burner phone for the trip and had it work once get across the border.We go to Ft. Frances up through Dryden, Vermilion Bay and end up on Gull Rock.I know from previous trips that coverage is hit and miss up there but would like to have something along just in case.Thanks,"
6198892,Mojo-NC,2018-05-23 09:54:00,1929,"I think it depends more on which carrier you are using. Verizon seems to have pretty good coverage up there north of Dryden, but other carriers have historically had spotty coverage at best. The others may have improved now, but my whole group now uses Verizon so nobody has to borrow my phone to get coverage any more. You may still have to go to specific places on the nearby road or lake where you have a better signal though."
6198982,x4flatfish,2018-05-23 12:13:00,319,"Do you have vehicle with on star? A few years ago 1 of our guys was sitting in his truck talking away. I thought he had lost it. Turns out he was talking to his wife via on Star. Not sure how that works, but may be an option. We also use Skype in camp as they have internet access."
6199032,big dog1,2018-05-23 13:18:00,4,Unfortunately ATT works well north of Ear Falls as well. I have had Sprint in the past and zero coverage with them. My brother uses Verizon and has solid coverage as well. I would be doubtful that a non name brand carrier like you would get with a burner phone would work out as you are on a Canadian carrier network. But I have not tried it.
6199060,martinbns,2018-05-23 14:34:00,1520,"If you are going north of Ear Falls, get whichever US carrier is aligned to Rogers up here."
6199078,Shellback,2018-05-23 15:04:00,8083,"Yes, if you have OnStar you can buy a cell phone plan. It works off any tower, US or Canadian. I used it in Chapleau last year and it worked like a charm. Bought some more minutes for this year."
6199148,muskyman73,2018-05-23 17:34:00,401,"Get AT&T, it works very well up there."
6199150,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-23 17:35:00,608,"Here is a composite NWO coverage map from opensignal.com for all carriers to provide a general sense of where coverage has been reported by users. Looks like most of the ""major"" roads have some form of coverage with the exception of 502. The map can be customized to specific carriers and/or access technologies 2G/3G/4G etc. for reports on specific areas based on your needs."
6199446,NARDA 1,2018-05-24 09:03:00,636,"I have used my T-Moble phone with a Canada package while staying on Eaqle Lake with good success. There is no coverage on the 502 between Fort Frances and Dryden, however if you take the 71 up from Fort Frances you will have some coverage. You can check out www.tbaytel.net for plans etc."
6199542,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-24 12:13:00,608,"I have TMobile as well and have the Simple Choice North America Plan: Unlimited Talk + Text which includes free roaming into Canada and Mexico. Roaming also includes the data packages associated with the account. It has been nice the last several years not having to worry about the cost of accidental data usage in Canada while having full talk, text and data capabilities in Canada where coverage permits."
