6198518,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-22 17:27:00,608,No info on this years prices however last year a flat of crawlers was $87 CDN and one pound of large leeches $67 CDN.
6198582,DaBirdman,2018-05-22 19:53:00,164,"Getting ours thru the outpost/outfitter.....that way it's not included as part of our weight limit. Steve's in Baudette is nice too. Otherwise, for crawlers we always buy them locally when going on our family drive-to resort on Rainy."
6197754,Pooch,2018-05-21 11:12:00,4618,"How is boat parking at this bait shop? I've never stopped there, but might if there is plenty of places to park.Pooch"
6197764,Bstar,2018-05-21 11:26:00,564,Their parking lot is not very big but it's on a side street that has plenty of parking across the street for boat rigs. You can check it out on Google Maps with the street view.
6197770,IaDave14,2018-05-21 11:37:00,99,"If you need beer it is basically right across the street from the Beer Store,"
6197774,Bstar,2018-05-21 11:44:00,564,I forgot about that! One stop shopping! Lol
6197790,Stringbean,2018-05-21 13:00:00,279,"So, what's the going rate for a pound of leeches?"
6197840,Aspencreek,2018-05-21 14:58:00,2911,I get my leeches at Rainy Lake sports in Fort Francis and my 1/2 flat of crawlers from a bait shop locally that packs them for CA.
6197864,Carnhzkr,2018-05-21 15:38:00,964,"There are lots of options for bait between International Falls and Dryden. You can call around, but they're all going to be within $5 of each other for a flat of crawlers. I've never purchased leeches. If you buy south of the border, crawlers will need to be packed in commercial bedding, so that adds a few dollars. I've used Sportsmans in IF as well as the big gas station on the south side of town (forgot the name, but you can't miss it). But for the past 5 or 6 years, I've been buying my crawlers in Ontario. I've bought from Rainy Lake Sports, as others have mentioned, and several times from The Great Bear, which is about 10 miles E of Fort Frances. No complaints for any of those places. As others have stated, call a week in advance to be sure they have a flat waiting for you. Lately, I buy from Dutchies, at Perrault Falls, but that's not on your way. I just like to give a plug for Dutchies because it's owned by an Iowa family and it's a nice little store."
6197898,GGustaf,2018-05-21 16:42:00,8,"http://www.fishlakebaitharris.com/FishLake Bait in Harris,Mn (45 mins north of St.Paul on I35) has great crawlers and salted minnows if you are headed to Canada.We have been buying there for 10+ years..... remember to call ahead and it will be ready for you."
6198156,prov1800,2018-05-22 06:19:00,5010,If your driving north on hwy 105 pull into Clarke's northern lights on the camp Robinson rd.best bait you can get as they supply most camps in the area.
6198282,billy weaver,2018-05-22 09:54:00,470,"I call Cabelas on I-35, Owatonna, Minn. a week before I go and order a flat of nightcrawlers (500) for Canada. I tell them when I will pick them up and they have always been ready. They will be packed in a Styrofoam box and chilled, ready for transport. I have not called them this year I hope they still run a bait shop since Bass Pro. Billy"
6197458,Guest,2018-05-20 22:09:00,0,So where is everyone buying their bait from this year? We have always taken up salted minnows but this year are going to bring up a flat of crawlers. Started looking online and there are several places to choose from. Any that are particularly good or any to avoid? Thanks
6197518,BornToFish,2018-05-21 06:13:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been very pleased with Queen Street Laundry in Dryden, Ontario. It's a combination of laundry and bait/tackle - really! They have been reliable for me and with quality bait at fair prices.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6197526,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-21 06:27:00,8293,If you want to do the US side give Val a call at Cold Spring Bait. 218-757-3191 they are located about 30 miles south of International Falls on Hwy 53. They supply most of the bait up there. I don't know what they can do for Canadian tourists but it might be worth a call.
6197560,Pooch,2018-05-21 07:04:00,4618,Which way are you going?Pooch
6197572,Eyetimes,2018-05-21 07:18:00,193,Skip the live bait and use plastics.
6197624,Camoclad,2018-05-21 07:56:00,628,We order ours through the outfitter.
6197692,Bstar,2018-05-21 09:35:00,564,X2 on QSL if you are going through Dryden. You can email or call them and pre-order. They have a well stocked bait and tackle store attached to a laundromat. Rainy Lake Sports is a good option in Fort Frances. This year we are flying out of Nakina so we will pick up bait at Young’s in Wawa.
6197704,The tank,2018-05-21 09:47:00,340,if we get bait it will be at steves lucky bait outside of Baudette mn.
6197722,Guest,2018-05-21 10:20:00,0,Will be coming up I35 through Minnesota heading to Dryden. Never heard of QSL in Dryden. Anyone know what a flat costs? Has anyone tried Speedy worm?
6197736,Bstar,2018-05-21 10:35:00,564,http://www.qsltackle.ca/ I don't know what a flat costs because we got leeches there. I would definitely get my bait there again.
