6198538,KevinSB,2018-05-22 18:05:00,73,"Jay, no answer here but interested in the responses: I'm heading up June 2. At the risk of taking this off-topic, where have any found low water levels to impede access? We had issues with Mud Lake years ago, back when it wasn't a protected spawning sanctuary until mid-June. We had a huge storm one night right before Mud opened and we were able to (barely) get in the next day using a trolling motor at its highest and with oars to help. I think we were the first boat in legally that year and a buddy caught a 39"" northern within 5 minutes. Other than that, no trouble for us accessing any parts of the lake. But I'm very interested to learn what others have to say about water level in Wabby this year and how that may affect fishing. Tight lines! Kevin"

With that comes thunderstorm possibilities. Keynote might be tricky getting into later in the summer along with Mud. I was there in 2002 and extremely low water levels, dock availability was tight at some camps. Have seen years in the 1970’s and 80’s where lodge owners have had to have track hoe dig out around docks. Most of these “low water” years have still been good fishing for us."
