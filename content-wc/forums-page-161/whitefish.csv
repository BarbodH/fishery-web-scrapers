I often catch whitefish in shallow water during the spring and again in the autumn. I catch these whitefish while fishing for walleyes with a jig and minnow. However, during the warm months of summer, these fish are normally found suspended in the main lake basin. This is the time of the year when electronics are important to success. During the summer, the whitefish will often be suspended in 40-100 fow. They often move shallower in the water column during the afternoon and into the evening - presumably following the movement of micro-organisms that are the food source for whitefish. I suggest that the original poster simply travels around in deep water and watch for marks on the sonar unit indicating the possible presence of whitefish. The sonar marks might be whitefish, ciscoes or lake trout. These fish might be down 40+ feet in the water column.Then, try jigging a small to medium size silver/white spoon (e.g. a Swedish Pimple) tipped with a piece of minnow. Position your lure just above the sonar marks - again watch your sonar unit! The bite can be very subtle - remember that the mouth is positioned somewhat downward. Or, the bite can be quite aggressive.Whitefish have a mouth that is ""tender"" - sort of like a crappie. Thus, don't play the fish too aggressively, or you will tear the fish's mouth and lose the fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6198946,1K1MOA,2018-05-23 11:28:00,90,"I like using small willow spoons with single hook, split shot (size depending on wind) and a minnow. My best success is usually in 30 - 60' of water. It is very common to be in 60' of water and catch them suspending in 30 to 40, so don't just work the bottom. It you mark suspending fish, check them out. They typically pick it up on the fall if you know what I mean. They also like it fairly slow, I pull up a foot or two, and let it flutter back down. White with red eyes on the willow spoons is by far my best producer for whitefish. I have enjoyed a few whitefish shore lunches on lakes around Nakina. Fantastic eating fish fresh out of the lake."
