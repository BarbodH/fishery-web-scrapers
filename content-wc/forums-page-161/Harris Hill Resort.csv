This year we need to shorten the drive time and will be trying the SW portion of LOTW in August. Specifically we are looking at Harris Hill Resort. Anyone had experience with this resort or this portion of the lake?"
6183010,LOWrider,2018-05-09 18:37:00,40,"I assume you mean SE side of LOW as that is where Harris Hill is. Can't speak to the resort itself as even though it is only a few miles from our cottage it is one resort I haven't made it to. Met several other resort owners in the area and they are all very good hard working people. I do know some people that have worked at Harris Hill and they liked working there, but maybe someone else can give you a first hand recommendation. As far as that part of the lake; Since you've been on LacSeul I'll save the obligatory 'big water' comments and assume you are rigged for big water. H.H. is right on the edge of Big Traverse, and the interesting part of this area is it is basically right at the point where Prairie meets Canadian Shield. To the Southwest the big expanse of the Traverse with it's miles of open water and endless opportunities for big water fishing - whether pulling cranks, bottom bouncing, jigging etc. To the North and Northwest it starts to evolve into the islands and structure that the Canadian side of LOW is known for. Fishing there becomes more vertical and typical for those that fish further North. I can't say where H.H. guests typically fish, but often enough I see their boats heading Northwest towards Big Island and beyond. So basically really a great part of a great lake with a huge variety of fishing opportunities. Only thing I'd say is if your vision is dropping a 14' camp boat in and fishing a protected hump a half mile from the resort, might not be an area that is best for you. Maybe give them a call at H.H. to see what they have to say. Pretty easy to get there for sure. Good Luck!"
6183050,Calico5888,2018-05-09 19:06:00,9,"Thank you LOWrider. First your correct, SE side. We have an 18' Lund impact with a 150 so the big water is not an issue and traveling some for fish isn't a problem. Knowing nothing about LOTW I didn't want to find ourselves in an area void of walleye. We are a couple of grandpas taking some college age grandsons who have limited time off, thus the shorter trip for us. H H has been good to visit with and all we really need is a cabin and access to water that holds fish. Sounds like we might not be making a mistake choosing this area of the lake. All previous trips have been through I Falls so going through Baudette will give us a chance to see new country and new water. Thanks again!"
6186265,LOWrider,2018-05-11 08:29:00,40,"No problem glad to help. I'll be up most of the summer, so if you get there and are struggling, message me on W.C. and I'll try to give you a heads up on what we've been seeing. I remember what it was like when we first started on this lake, it is massive and at times can be some work to dial in the active fish. Regards."
6198484,ret-ro,2018-05-22 16:07:00,41,"Harris hill is a great little resort, been going out there for the last handful of years. They have nice well equipped cabins, fish cleaning shack, and a solid concrete boat ramp. The beauty of their location has them well protected from the prevailing north and west winds which will allow you to get out and fish where the guys near baudette will be enjoying a blow day or being stuck in rainy river. Make sure you have a lakemaster or late model lowrance map chip to show you all the reef available to fish. Have a great time and enjoy your trip. Hoping to make it back up there in mid to late july again this year."
6198510,Calico5888,2018-05-22 16:59:00,9,Thank you for the response ret-ro. Good to hear positive reviews.....always wonder when one is trying a new place. We are booked for mid August.
6199172,PhilTickelson,2018-05-23 18:19:00,84,"I haven't fished that exact part of the lake, but I have fished the central portion(near Arnesen's) of big traverse many times. It looks like Harris Hill is in a bit of a sheltered part of the lake there should there be west winds. However, if you plan on making a run up to those islands to the N or NE and it's a strong west wind, you will need to be careful(I would suggest just not even considering it). There have been many days on big traverse that my buddy's 20' glass warrior is nowhere near big enough to get out and fish comfortably/safely. You poke your head north of snake island with a west wind there and you're looking at ~30 miles of open water for those waves to build. If that wind is 10-15mph+ you will be putting yourself at risk IMO. It looks like you'll still have sheltered areas to fish even in that situation though, so I wouldn't worry about it too much, just wanted to mention it cause it can get ROUGH out there. All that said, LOTW is awesome in the summer! If you end up fishing big traverse, walleye should be spread out in the mud at that time(it's amazing how flat and featureless a lot of big traverse is). Vertical jigging won't be your best bet, pulling cranks/spinners is probably your best option to cover a lot of water in big traverse. Start catching a few in one area, drop a waypoint and troll over it a few times until it seems like you aren't getting any anymore and then keep moving. If it's a light to moderate breeze, we like to troll with the wind/waves for a ways and then reset, easy to keep the boat moving straight and keep lines from getting fouled if you have a lot of them out. Can't speak for anything outside of big traverse. It may not be the classic 'sit in one spot jigging up walleyes' you might be used to, but you can put a lot of fish in the boat. Slow days in the middle of summer for us seem to be in the 20-40 fish range for 2-3 guys. Good days can get you closer to 100 / day. If you want more of the 'canadian fishing experience', I'd try to get up in those islands."
6199348,Calico5888,2018-05-24 06:32:00,9,THAnk you Phil. We'll be careful. We haven't done a whole lot of crank bait fishing but sounds like we better take some along.
