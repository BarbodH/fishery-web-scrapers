6198160,HeHooksHimself,2018-05-22 06:25:00,725,"Just to chime in and follow up on BStar's post, Woman River Camp is a nice option. Paul and Deb and their crew are awesome. There is a lot of water so every day could be a different experience. Good fishing early in the year close to camp, but make sure you make it up to Big Woman sometime during the week. Lots of portage options at no extra charge. Paul does not nickle and dime you. The price is the price Whatever your choice, you might want to bring boat seat cushions, that saves our back and butts every year. FYI, the road out of Ear Falls is a 30 mile ride on a gravel road. It is usually in pretty good shape, but it usually depends on recent weather. Whatever your choice, I hope it is fantastic! I bet it will be! Fish On! Hooks"

6198534,PhilTickelson,2018-05-22 18:00:00,84,"This looks like an awesome area of LOTW. I reached out and it seems like they mainly cater to American Plan guests, I forgot to mention earlier that we prefer a housekeeping plan(sorry I didn't specify that, I thought I had everything down there!) I reached out to Obabikon, and unfortunately they don't have openings, but that place is on my bucket list now, it looks awesome and their owner was so fast to get back to me. Right now I have a good lead on a place on Gullrock lake, which looks like a fun lake to fish!"

6200748,PhilTickelson,2018-05-27 20:46:00,84,Thanks everyone for all the suggestions! I ended up booking at five lakes lodge on GullRock lake June 30th - July 7th. I'll be sure to write up a nice report when I get back. I'll probably post another thread leading up to the trip to see if anyone has a fishing report .
6197776,PhilTickelson,2018-05-21 11:50:00,84,"Hey guys and gals, I had planned a trip up to Canada with my wife but our first choice of lodges I just found out has had some upkeep issues lately. I’m looking for recommendations, here’s our list : - drive to, 8-9 hours from St. Paul is fine. - her first time to Canada, want her to catch a lot of fish. - primarily fishing for walleye and northern, but smallmouth are a bonus(not necessary though) - good boats, my wife broke her tailbone when she had our last son, hope to have a nice flat floor boat with padded seats. - not looking for BIG water, but I know lakes like lac Saul have ares that aren’t quite as big. - would prefer not to be crammed on a lake by a bunch of other resorts. - we will probably be going early - mid July, we like vertical jigging if we can get away with it. I’ve been reading through dozens and dozens of old threads. A couple places that look interesting are :Gullrock lake Umfreville lake (Halley’s) Anyone ave any opinions on those locations?"

6197824,Figure-8,2018-05-21 14:28:00,111,"Tomahawk Resort on LOTW in Sioux Narrows. Great place to stay, great rental boats, decent fishing close but the better walleye fishing is a ways away."
6197826,Bstar,2018-05-21 14:34:00,564,I have not been there myself but a camp that looks interesting to me is Woman River Camp. Decent rates with upgrade boats and they have a family rate and some portage lakes which could make the trip more interesting. Just a suggestion.
6197828,PhilTickelson,2018-05-21 14:36:00,84,"Thanks guys! Johnboat, I sent you a message back. I know there are a lot of LOTW resorts, I've fished the MN side of the lake dozens of times(which is a much different lake). Are there any LOTW lodges that are more remote than others? I don't want to run into too many other boats while we are up there. Not that there's any shortage of places to fish up there though! Do they have any luck for crappies early July up on the Canadian side? That would be a nice bonus!"
6197838,Aspencreek,2018-05-21 14:56:00,2911,"Just an FYI Are you looking at heading up this year, or next? If it is this year your choices are and should be very limited by now. All the better places are booked already or have a very limited space availability. The camp I normally go to is booked out for this year! So my only hope in getting in is IF someone gives up their week Next year. Good luck."

6198084,gullrockguy,2018-05-21 21:41:00,44,"try gullrock lake, there are a few lodges on the lake but the july 4th week is usually slow because for some reason the US visitors want to stay home to celebrate. (go figure) gullrock is not a big lake but the fishing will not disappoint you. just look at facebook for five lakes lodge and you will see what kind of fish are in the water. the camps all have decent boats to rent and are well maintained. hope you have a great canadian experience. P.S. I am not involved in any camp on the lake, just a guy who lives on it."
