Our cabin was a duplex with 2 full bathrooms, an upstairs lounging area, 2 outside decks, and a dishwasher to name just a few amenities. The Boois and their staff were first rate and very professional. Booi's has a group guiding system at no extra fee. the guides take the groups from camp to areas of the lake and put them on fish. They have a big shore lunch. at a designated place and time. My wife and I chose to go our own direction every day so we didn't partake in the shore lunches. I found the lake very easy to fish despite it's enormous size. A good handheld GPS is a great item to have on this lake. The fishing was fabulous! We were averaging 60 fish days and the walleyes are big and healthy! We didn't lake trout fish, but they were being caught in big numbers by groups in camp. We didn't catch big numbers of pike, but the ones that we caught were good sized. I caught my personal best at that time of 45 inches. Booi's has an outstanding website www.boois.com. I would recommend This Lodge and this lake to anyone looking for a high quality trip. Mike."
