6116802,Namegosikaa,2018-04-07 12:40:00,61,Within an 8 hour window I would consider the French river/ nippising area.
6117130,adempsey2.0,2018-04-07 16:17:00,612,You might want to drive up through MI and cross over at Sault Ste. Marie and go from there. North to Wawa or Chapleau area. Unless you really want to fish for Musky. Plenty of places east of Sault as well.
6117250,Paul H,2018-04-07 17:36:00,1232,"Through Buffalo/Ft Erie go North of North Bay, depending on how you drive and traffic 8 hrs is into some decent areas, the farther North the better. Or Through the Sault as mentioned, though I think you won't get as far North, done both from Zanesville - prefer West of New Liskeard, personally. From Temagami area to New Liskeard has a ton of camps as well."

We do fly in trips, but we drive up through Michigan and the UP and cross of at Saunt St. Marie and go a few hours north to Wawa. There is a lot of great fishing up in the Wawa area. 67 days till we start our trek up north! Good luck!"

Not bad if you have at least two drivers to switch off while one sleeps. Great walleye fishing, small mouth bass, pike,trout and jumbo perch. If you have a four wheel drive truck all the better to get to the more remote lakes."
