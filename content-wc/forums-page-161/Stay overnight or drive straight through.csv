6196198,SteveZ,2018-05-18 08:58:00,271,We come from Central Iowa and it is about 16 hours to Ear Falls. We used to leave at 8pm on a Friday and drive all night. Too old for that crap anymore. We stop in International Falls and spend the night on Friday. Get into camp at about 10am on Saturday. We do drive straight through on the way home though. Multiple drivers.
6196504,Wallyeyes,2018-05-18 22:23:00,50,"Uffda! Back in the 80's when I worked at Alcoa and was limited to July shutdown vacations my Dad and I would go to Ontario. One time we spent the night in a tent in a park in Orr. That was great. 4th of July weekend and we had to listen to fireworks all night long, never mind sleeping on rough ground because we got there after dark and couldn't see where we put the tent. That was some bad planning. Prior to that time we drove straight through depending on where we were going. We went to Sioux Narrows a few years in a row and that was too much. After the Orr incident we always found a room and broke up the drive and after that being refreshed on arrival at camp was so much better we never did go back to driving all the way in one shot. I feel kind of spoiled now. We moved to Grand Rapids, MN in 08. Outside of a beer run to Canada in 03 we hadn't been on a fishing trip since 99. Last year was our first fishing trip since then and we went to the Indian Chain in Vermilion Bay. Granted, there isn't a real good straight shot from GR to the border but we were still there in about 5-hours. If we plan on going to some of the other places we have been in the past or even if we check out new water in the future most of where I would want to go now is easily within a 6 or 7-hour drive max."
6196506,edgepa,2018-05-18 22:51:00,6,"It has been great reading about everyone's thoughts about the ideal drive to Canada. As we approach summer and making that annual trip, we are debating the overnight drive. Coming from the West Coast, we have been leaving on Wednesday after work and driving through the night to stay in North Dakota 24 hours later. From there, it's just a quick 12+ hour jaunt to Northwest Ontario so we are at the cabin by early evening- all in daylight hours. I guess I should point out you are lucky to be so close to Paradise. This year we are considering abandoning the overnight drive. Instead we would start super early Thursday and try to get to International Falls by Friday night. Then we would have a quick drive on Saturday hopefully there by early afternoon. Either way, it's a 2+ week vacation so we have a time to catch up. The trip back is always slower so we return refreshed.That said, I can't wait until I retire and spend a month driving up north."
6197952,Rock Hound,2018-05-21 17:51:00,51,"I feel exactly the same way! Take the extra day and spend the night before rather than driving straight through. The trip is good either way (have done both), but I think you are a bit more alive with a little more rest at the beginning of your trip! Merry Christmas!"
6198904,Twins_dad,2018-05-23 10:13:00,38,"Our group starts our travel day very early in North Carolina. We fly to MSP, then Int. Falls, then overnight in Dryden. I have to say that when we all get together, some of our best stories are from the trip there and back. Like the one time one guy, not paying attention, ended up sitting on the throne in the women's restroom in MSP airport. Claims he was sober but that is still in question. Or one car (the one I was in) depending on GPS for a short cut and put us on a logging road...and about 2 hours behind the rest of our group. Great stories of loading up the pick-up with groceries and duty free beer in Int Falls. Dodging wildlife on the way to Dryden. Enjoying the first walleye dinner of the trip in Dryden. Multiple ""pulp stops"" along the way to pee. So if your schedule allows it (and I know sometimes you just need to get there...and then back home), just enjoy the journey there and back."

Too tired to fish much the first day. Now at least we leave early enough to stay overnight in Dryden and get a good nights sleep before flying out. We drive home straight through though, about 16 hours plus pit stops..."

6188561,LoDo,2018-05-12 14:53:00,721,"If coming from MSP and Ear Falls or Red Lake is your destination, stay in Int Falls, Fort Frances or push it to Dryden. IMO, the drive from Dryden to Red Lake is the most dangerous and full of wildlife, best to drive in daylight.We go through Winnipeg anymore and use Amik outfitters to our fly in destination. Our longest commute is from Denver, CO home to Denver airport. Super convenient, however I do miss the excitement of the trip driving through northern MN, stopping at taverns on the way up for a beer and seeing the canadian shield landscape. The little things like the smell of the paper mills, crossing the border, large bridge over Lake of Woods / Rainy area, short cuts around dryden, cigars, produce shopping, etc... I don't miss any of the commute home. Happy fishing all!!"
6188953,btyreprich,2018-05-12 18:46:00,1067,"When we first started to go to Canada - starting in 1977 - Highway 53 in Wisconsin north of Eau Claire would take you though many small towns. In fact you'd be driving down the manu street of these towns so you'd have to watch your speed even late at night. Would look forward to seeing all the small bars and supper clubs. Our group always tLked about stopping for a cold one, but most times we were in too big of a hurry. Told my best friend that when do retire dnd are not on a tight time schedule, we WILL take or time and visit a few bars and perhaps even a supper club. Half the fun of the trip was the drive up and looking at the scenery."

Solon Spings was a must stop town back in the day according to them. I'll have to find my journal and post those places for you to consider if they still exist today. PjShorthorn"
6189177,Baseline,2018-05-12 20:56:00,3207,"Unfortunately many of these small towns north of Eau Claire have hit the skids and many of the bars and supper clubs have closed since the four lane on Hwy 53 was completed all the way to Superior, WI About all Solon Springs has to offer is a Dairy Queen, a small town restaurant and a hotel. The new road bypassed these towns and now people heading north and south whiz by at 65 MPH."
6189193,btyreprich,2018-05-12 21:10:00,1067,"Not much progress for those small town business owners. I remember well caravans of fisherman heading north going through those towns late, late at night. Now nothing for them,"
6189257,Aspencreek,2018-05-12 23:57:00,2911,"Oh, those towns still have a bar or 2, the locals need a place to cure the worlds problems. You just need to get off the Hiway to find them. Before 53 was completed it used to take 7 hrs from Madison to Superior, now I do it in 5 without 1 stoplight. The northwoods bars and Supper clubs are actually making a comeback. Some of the old ones are reopening or remodeling (the fish and deer mounts will still be there). A good stiff Brandy Old Fashion, a waitress named Ruth that calls you darlin or sweety, bread sticks and a cheese plate along with a relish tray, Prime Rib, T-Bone or Broasted chicken with the salad bar and a big slice of chocolate cake just to complete the food coma........."
6190889,Walleye2242,2018-05-14 06:23:00,263,wow..love this post and the track it took. First...take your time driving up..take an extra day and enjoy. We use to drive it through when we were young. We are older now..we take an extra day even. we come from central IL. Drive to eau claire for day 1...stay there..cook out...next day..drive slow...make stops...and stay in the falls...next day drive to red lake area. Yeah...long trip up but so worth it now. We actually stop at those small towns. I started going up in 1979...i remember all those small towns as a kid. I use always wonder what the people in those towns did for a living and i always wanted to stop and eat at one of those supper clubs. I remeber a place we would eat driving through a small town and it had a sign of a Bull out front..dont know the name but as a kid i was like...man..if there is a bull on the sign it must be really good...ha!!! for me the drive up is a huge part of the experience and is there a better feeling waking up that sat. morning to finish off the drive as you know you will be pulling into camp??? 30 years later and i am still like a little kid waking up that sat. morning.

6185777,Ogoki,2018-05-11 05:41:00,291,"What is so unique about this thread ,is that so many of us drive long distances to enjoy what Canada has to offer. I have friends say, I won't go up there , can't bring much back. The people on here like me , aren't after the fish we can bring back. Eat some fresh walleye. Listen to the loons and white throated sparrows. See a moose or bear. Breathe in the smell of the pines . Solitude !! Many of us here , have been doing this for years and keep getting drawn back to it.I don't have to say it but enjoy , EVERY part of your trips. I am not flying in my next trip but bear hunting . When we arrived last year , no leaves on trees , cool nights . By time we left trees had leaves and was warming up. Just sitting in the woods and taking it all in , running baits , being away from the crowds of people . Have been on 40 fly in trips , numerous canoe trips , over a dozen bear hunts . Money spent that a nursing home WON'T GET !!!!!!"
6185889,Habitual Eyer,2018-05-11 06:41:00,144,"Been making the drive up that way from Valpo for a few decades now. Always pulling a boat. Not sure I would go with the 14 hr estimate from MapQuest. Even though you are a little closer than I....decent effort puts you there more like 16 in my experience. We always leave Friday morn. Have stayed overnight in Virginia, Fort Frances, Dryden. Drove the remainder in Saturday morn. Way better that way instead of driving all Friday night. Way home we sometimes haul straight through.... but way up is a no brainer in my book .....SAY OVERNIGHT IF YOU CAN>>>>MAKES THAT FIRST SATURDAY SOOOO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE AND EASIER."

We also left for Ear Falls from west Chicago so you're driving through WI and MN in the middle of the night. Besides the numerous close calls with deer over the years, the fatigue was killing us. We'd be smoked for the first two days from losing that night of sleep. Last year, we decided to leave around noon Thursday and cut the trip in half staying somewhere in Duluth. Checked into the hotel by 9pm, made it to the lodge in time for check-in the next day. We were fully rested and never once encountered a deer. All 8 in the group unanimously agreed we were done with the overnight trips. Half of them are in their mid-late 20's too so it's not just the old guys!"

6186353,rockape,2018-05-11 08:48:00,215,"2 years ago, myself and two friends endured the serious drive from **** from Perrault Falls to Indianapolis. Left Clark's on Cedar maybe around 5pm. Easy border cross. Still light. I get south of I-Falls and get a **** speeding ticket. Cop took forever to write it up. Get back on the road. Dark in northern Wisconsin at 1:30am. Everyone is awake and alert. We watch for deer like hawks. Well, this one came out of nowhere. 70mph dead center of the grill, smashed the windshield, ran it over with the rear, airbags, freaking disaster. Can I say 1:30am around Spooner on 53 700 miles from home. $@!%. Took forever to get help. Skeeters biting the crap out of us (bug spray buried in the gear), and the air bag stench in the truck was terrible too. Picked the skeeter bites. Sheriff drives us 50 miles back to Duluth because that was the closest rental car hub. Drops us off in a hotel in Superior, WI at 3:30am. Couldn't sleep at all. Eat breakfast and try to Uber to Enterprise Rent a Car. Whoops! No Uber there yet! Cab... All the rental place has is a white mini-van. Nice. We then drive to the junkyard where my truck was with $10k in fishing gear in the back. Everyone said it was totaled, so I had to clear out all of my possessions. Back on the road... Find the deer at mile marker 191 on 53 South. Kicked the SOB in the head a few times, and got back on the road to Indy at like 11. Got home at 11pm. Freaking 29-30 hour trek with many obstacles and no sleep. And then I had to fly one way to Minneapolis a month later after they fixed my rig. And then another 10 hour solo trip back to Indy. What I do to fish in Canada!!!! It can't much more challenging than that unless the good Lord dials up my number on another 1100 mile drive to Sioux Lookout!"

I don't do the bear hunting and such but I love the fishing to the point that I have my reservation for next year in the lodges book already and I will be back until I can't get there or have someone get me there. Later, Jay"
6187305,pjshorthorn,2018-05-11 15:52:00,5654,"I have driven the 502 at night quite a number of times. There was always someone in more of a hurry than myself and would end up passing me. I enjoyed having a rabbit in front of me to spot the moose and bear before I did. Hang back, watch for the brake lights and slow down. Kept me awake and more alert too. If I drive the 502 again, it will be for nostalgia reasons and not at night. I want to see all the lakes and landscape it presents. Last year we took the North Shore around Lake Superior to Vermilion Bay. Ironically, we never saw any wildlife in the early morning ( dark to sunrise). We saw 4 bears, one of which almost became a hood ornament, numerous deer and a moose all in broad daylight at different hours of the day. PjShorthorn"
6187393,pjshorthorn,2018-05-11 16:22:00,5654,"Yeah, I can feel your pain to a lesser degree. On the way back from Sioux Lookout to where my uncle lives in Elroy,WI. We stopped and switched drivers right before dusk. I got the the last leg of the trip so my 10 year old son could ride shotgun as the official deer spotter while the uncle caught some zzzzz in the back seat of his truck. I don't recall where we were at the the time, but it was on a divided highway and ........yep........out of nowhere comes a deer out of the ditch on the right side of the vehicle. I drilled it with the right front corner of the hood/bumper and then it spun around and did some pretty good damage down the side of the passenger doors. Of course both the son and my uncle had fallen asleep after dark and when I hit the deer, the son woke up and my uncle let out the worst scream I've ever heard. He was on a mine sweeping boat in Nam for his tour of duty and they only worked at night. I can only imagine that he had an immediate flashback due to the noise of the impact. We got to a gas station, checked the truck which was ok to drive and then reported the accident to the DNR and Sheriff's office. We made a very slow drive the rest of the way with all of us fully alert. No one would have prevented this incident regardless of being awake or not,but it sure did make me not want to drive straight through anymore on the front end or back end of a trip. We got lucky. PjShorthorn"
6187665,Joek3,2018-05-11 19:54:00,244,We have 2 simple rules. 1-no driving at night due to deer/tired. 2-We do not change our normal sleep/wake routines. Meaning no leaving at 2 or 3 AM. I want to arrive at the lodge refreshed and in my daily routine.
6184833,big dog1,2018-05-10 13:46:00,4,"We have always driven straight thru. It is about 750 miles for us. In the old days we would stop for a nap in Bobbies parking lot for about 2 hours and then head the remainder of the way up. Usually in the drive of our camp way too early.. But full of anticipation. Not sure if it is the smartest idea to drive thru the night, Moose, deer, bear and plenty of twisting and turning roads, but the anticipation and desire to get fishing has generally gotten the best of us."
6184905,Mr. Sauger,2018-05-10 14:32:00,285,"Stick with your tried and true plan of driving the 10.5 hours in the daytime and then have dinner and hotel stay in FF. In our younger days we would leave Chicagoland around 8:00 PM to miss the rush hour on 90 - Cross the boarder by 6:00AM to beat the crowd, bfast in Dryden and arrive at Lac Seul or other destination noonish. Too old for that now. Besides feeling like crap for a day or two, we realized it was harder to do and less safe. Taking turns driving doesn't work as well as it sounds, cause we all got tired around the same time.If you drive through and arrive friday night, you may be too tired to launch the boat, unpack, yadda yadda. How much fishing time are you really saving?Stay fresh and enjoy every day of the vacation you waited all year for."

Typically nobody on bridge to speak of. Used to make the 17 hour drive from Ear Falls to Kansas City coming back until dad dozed off in Iowa and hit a weigh station exit perfectly at 75 MPH. I looked over and saw him completely asleep. Took the wheel, yelled and told him to hit the brakes. Stopped in the middle of the weigh station about 100 ft. from an 18 wheeler. Can't explain how lucky we were, an absolute miracle that truck stop exit was there. Hence, we will NEVER try driving that stretch in one day again. Good luck, stay safe and have a great season this year everyone."

6185577,hoppy63,2018-05-10 21:40:00,367,"Not even question. Whatever the drive is from where you live, get to camp or where you fly out of day ahead of time. No sense being totally spent on day one, and trying to catch up on day two and three. My opinion."
6185601,Aspencreek,2018-05-10 22:01:00,2911,"When we first started it was all about the drive straight thru mainly because we didn't want to spend the $$$ on a motel or take an extra day off work. But then it happened, my brother dozed off and was woke up by the rubble strips and gravel shoulder. In that brief instance we both decided that would be the last trip driving straight thru. Now the camp we go to is a friday to friday, so we start about 8am on thursday, make the easy drive to FF and the Super 8. Have a good dinner and a good nights sleep. Get up between 7-8, have breakfast at the motel, pick up the groceries we need at the grocery in FF, pick up our bait and licenses at Rainy Lake and head up to camp on LS. We are fishing by 3pm, and no ""long drive hangover"". I would not even consider driving straight thru on the way up, on the way back, no problem, for us it's 12 hrs driveway to driveway."

Now trying to get my buddy to leave early - before 5 am. I like taking a leisurely drive up to IF as it saves on gas, is safer, and frankly there's no reason to rush. I also don't like driving at night what with wildlife along the roadside. We used to drive late at night on 502 and the number of moose we'd say long side of the road while driving 55 mph +, well I look back at it now and think that was a real dumb move."
6185745,tv4fish,2018-05-11 05:29:00,2694,Based on our 30 some years of experience - I offer this: We will never drive from I-Falls to Sioux Lookout during the night - There is a reason they have signs that say Night Danger with a picture of a moose on them. The time that you cross the border from the US into Canada is something to consider - they get mighty busy on a Saturday.

6184209,Guest,2018-05-10 09:37:00,0,"First 7 trips: leave between 10am-noon, drove 9-10 hours (including fuel/food stops), slept in the truck at the Anchor Lake rest area for about 6 hours, got up at 4am to hit the border by 6. Stop for licenses in Ear Falls and then finish the trek to Red Lake. Arrive in pretty good shape, excited to get on the water. Last year, needed to do a ""quick"" brake job on the truck. Shouldn't take long at all, so figured I'd knock it out in the morning and the usual plan would be just fine. Naturally, it turned into a nightmare brake job, by the time we actually got going, only slept about an hour at Anchor Lake so that we could still hit the border at 6. Was exhausted pretty much the whole week! Took a few naps, but just never ""caught up"" on rest. While it was still a great trip (they always are, aren't they?), it was definitely NOT something I would do again. Granted, it wasn't a straight-through drive, but it was close enough for me to say: spend the extra night and arrive well-rested! Conversely, I do drive straight through on the way home (16-17 hours). Not because I'm eager to get away from camp, but because by the time I'm getting really tired, I'm only an hour or two from home and it feels silly to stop when I'm that close. Next year, my son will be old enough to take some of the drive time, so plans could change...but we have a ""tradition"" now, so probably not. -42"

Last year we stopped in Superior and grabbed a Subway and ate at the park by the bay. We usually get to the border around 3:30-4:00. We spend the night at the Rendezvous on Rainy Lake. Bar, restaurant, bar, sleep. Wake up refreshed and ready to go on Sat. morning. We've only done the drive through the night thing a couple of times. It's not for me. You are wiped out the next day. 10-12 hours on the road is enough for me."
6184281,Ricky Spanish,2018-05-10 10:15:00,1298,"Ours is usually a 12hr drive, but it can be done in about 10.5 if we stopped less often. We are in our upper 40's now, but the wife and I still drive all night. I stop about every 3hrs to stretch my legs and get a coffee. I usually drive until about Virginia, MN. She is usually asleep before we hit Eau Claire. She takes the leg to I-Falls, while I nap. I grab more coffee and some gas, then up 502 to Eagle River. We get to the lodge 6-7AM on Sat, unpack, launch the boat, say hi to everyone, grab a bite to eat, then go fishing or take a nap until dinner."

When I was younger we would leave right after I got off from work and drive into the night, usually stop in either Virginia or Orr and catch a few ZZs. Now that I am older (and allegedly wiser) we drive to the Falls, stay over and make the last leg the next day. So much more refreshed than the overnight trips."
6184441,johnboat,2018-05-10 11:12:00,2014,"My drive is 17 hours. I've done it both ways. Straight through on the way up only out of necessity. It's doable but much prefer spending the extra 100 bucks, getting a good sleep and arriving at camp good and rested, not tired and strung out. Especially if you arrive at check in time.Straight through on the way home doesn't bother me tho."

6184569,kcguy68,2018-05-10 11:48:00,51,"My crew recently made the decision to stay in Fort Frances the night before hitting camp. The first day of fishing is much better when you are not suffering from road fatigue from the trip up. The last couple years we drove straight through that first day on the water turned into a comedy of errors. We realized that because we were tired that initial day of fishing had become a wasted day. La Place Rendez Vous is a great place to get some decent rest, and charge those batteries after a long day on the road."
6184657,Guest,2018-05-10 12:15:00,0,"Our drive is roughly 18 hours. We will leave around 5:00 AM and arrive at our hotel between 9-10. This puts us about 1 1/2 hour drive the next morning, which we are usually up by 6:30 and then on the water by 9. Now, there will be 2-4 drivers in the vehicle so we all swap out driving and try to get a nap in on the way. We are all in our mid to upper 30's as well. On the way home, we drive it straight through and usually roll in around midnight. The trip there is a big day, but we do get a decent night's sleep in the hotel so never really too tired the day we get there. Also, we probably don't fish as long the first day compared to the rest of the week as we can't check into our cabins until the afternoon so we try to come back in the early evening to get everything settled in."
6184673,emma17,2018-05-10 12:24:00,436,"Like most, we stopped the overnight driving for reasons mentioned. We leave Thursday around 4 p.m. and drive to Virginia, MN. Wake up mostly refreshed and finish the drive Friday morning, usually arriving at camp in time for lunch and the afternoon fishing. We still drive straight through coming home as we leave in the morning. I do love the Friday morning wake up and drive into Canada. Funny, my trailer tire blew before reaching IF last year, but the ahhh of Canada had already set in, keeping me level headed for a challenging tire change. Somehow the blown tire hit the wheel fender supports with such force it bent them in toward the hub so much that the replacement tire wouldn't fit between them. I'll bring a small sledgehammer this year."
6184681,valley366,2018-05-10 12:30:00,193,Our travel makes us look weak compared to some of you. We usually try to leave Minneapolis at noon on Friday. Do the trek to International Falls in time for dinner. After eating gas up and jump across the border to stay in Fort Frances for the night.The place we are going this year allows a 2pm arrival. We will be up and on the road at the crack of 8 heading north. Quick stop in Dryden to top off the fresh groceries and by my calculations arrive at camp right around 2pm.On the way home we drive it straight through.
6183754,Bill Krejca,2018-05-10 06:39:00,6107,"Used to work all day, leave in the evening, drive all night, load up boats and island camp, maybe catch that evening's meal. As time goes on, staying overnight and continuing the next day makes for a more refreshing trip. Sometimes still drive all the way in the way home, tho. Bill"
6183762,MrSimon,2018-05-10 06:43:00,922,"From eastern PA, our drives are always 16-22 hours. We go non-stop. Age obviously plays a role, but we're in our early 40s. We want maximum time at camp. Hotels waste fishing time. BIG COMFY VEHICLES are key. And lots of drivers. We have 5 drivers that switch every few hours, and someone is usually sound asleep in the third row at all times. It's works great. I don't think we'd do it in pick-ups or anything smaller than a Suburban or Excursion. Heck, I'm thinking to buy a used RV just for these kinds of trips. Imagine how fun the road trip would be if you had couches, a fridge, and a full bedroom in the back for sleeping."
6183441,prov1900,2018-05-10 06:56:00,544,"Like about everyone else here, we used to be younger and drive straight through. We hit the border at about the crack of dawn, completely out of it, and do the 502. The mind plays a lot of tricks on you when you are exhausted and as most of us know, the 502 has a lot of pitfalls that you don't want to run into...or off of. One year we saw a group of guys standing off to the right of the road. On the left was a new truck and new Lund upside down in the rocky ditch. After we stopped to make sure everyone was ok, we woke up a little there. Now it's just me and my two young boys and I don't take chances. We stay in I-Falls, meet up with the rest of the crew, have a great meal and get the needed rest. Heck, it's 9 hours to I-Falls for me and I'm about wasted when I get there. But that good nights sleep makes the rest of the week way more pleasurable. We also leave a day earlier than we used to. Our camp is good with coming in early too, as long as they have the cabin space. We are always there for their opening week, so we pretty much have it to ourselves anyway."
6183449,RRK285,2018-05-10 06:56:00,44,"btyreprich - I live in Naperville and we used to go to Ear Falls Lac Seul every year. We would leave 3-4am and drive to Dryden spend the night and then drive up early the next day. Now I go to Minnitaki and stay the night in InterFalls. 4 members of our group fell asleep at the wheel driving straight through about 8 years ago, all survived but some with plates and screws in them now... Be Safe avoid the most dangerous part of the trip is my philosophy."
6183905,SterlingArcher,2018-05-10 07:46:00,92,"It's about 400 miles from my front door to the float plane, but an extra five hours for the part of the crew that comes from southern MN. We have taken to staying overnight in Dryden every year - very nice to have a good meal, a comfortable bed, a sauna and hot tub, and just a couple hours to drive the next morning. I get tired enough when I am on the water 16 hours a day...as I age I really enjoy that little bit of extra rest on the front end!"
6183921,tparker,2018-05-10 07:49:00,100,"Coming from Northwest Indiana up to Ear falls, we have pretty much the same drive you do. We cross the border on Friday, and stay overnight in Fort Frances. Easy drive Sat. morning. Trying the Copper River Inn this year. Have stayed at the Super 8 in past years."
6183937,KevinSB,2018-05-10 07:53:00,73,"We drive from Central Illinois and make the trip to Wabaskang in two days. We leave early (5:30ish) on a Friday morning and arrive in International Falls in the evening. Have dinner and crash, crossing the border a little before 7:00 the next morning. We bring many of our groceries but stop in Dryden for perishables before arriving at camp when it opens at noon. 22 days until we do it again! Kevin"
6184089,wmd,2018-05-10 08:44:00,388,"When I first started going ton Canada we fished in the Flin Flon area and left from NE SD. We were in our 30's and would drive all night, 14-15 hours, then fish all day. It would take at least 2 days to recover and get rested up. Young and dumb. Now I go on 2 trips to the Sioux Lookout area and we drive to Sioux 10-12 hours spend the night and boat in the next day. The first trip is a 3 hour drive from Sioux to the lake and the second is 30 minutes. It is much better spending the night and going in refreshed and ready for a full day of fishing. I am 65 and a lot younger than Stjoeguy and most of the others on the first trip so handle it well, we leave in 29 days. wmd"
6184121,UKBDM,2018-05-10 08:55:00,178,"I leave @ 7:00am from northside (Noblesville) and meet BIL on 74 near Crawfordsville @ 8:00am. We take 74 to 39 to miss Chicago. Arrive in Iron Mountain around 7:00pm. Have nice meal, sleep 8 hours and cross at IF around 9:00am. Stop in FF or Dryden for perishable groceries and arrive at Jim and Julies about 1:30pm. I forgot ... we usually stop at Dutchies for last minute tackle needs and canadian beer. Return trip we leave at 7:00am Sat and drive straight thru arriving in Indy about 2:00am."
6184185,Ogoki,2018-05-10 09:19:00,291,"In my earlier years we would do the 21 hour drive straight thru to Armstrong. Many times driving thru northern Ontario during the night . Arrive at float plane base , pay and load plane. Feel like crap for day or so. Saw too many moose and moose collisions . Now at 62 we drive to our cabin in northern Michigan. Arrive there early afternoon, mow yard. Get good meal and to bed early . Up at 4 am and arrive at the Soo at breakfast time. Enjoy the ride around Lake Superior. Stop for lunch at roadside park at Rossport. Our Labs enjoy the lake and arrive at Armstrong well before dark. Bear hunt in two weeks. Last year saw over 30 years in the 155 miles up Rt 527."

6183386,MN_Moose,2018-05-10 04:26:00,964,We used to do the drive through the night leaving after work and arriving at dawn. Found that we were tired for two days. Recently we have traveled a couple ways. Stay at one guys cabin in northern Minnesota and leave early Saturday. The second option if the camp cabin is open on a Friday is to leave at dawn Friday and get up to camp at 5:00 or 6:00 unload and get settled in. We don't fish on the Friday. Driving in daytime is much better and everyone is fresh on Saturday
6183418,onetimedave,2018-05-10 05:12:00,502,"We have a 20+ hour drive from Eastern Ohio to Nakina. We used to drive straight through but now stay on the North edge of the ""SOO"". Good motel with a lot of restaurants nearby. This leaves us with a 8 hour plus drive the next day. Much better than driving straight through. Won't drive straight through again."
6183434,fsz,2018-05-10 05:17:00,144,"I'm 50 I go with guys in their 70's that are tough. Until about 10 years ago we drove 12 hours through the night, arrived at a trailhead at 9 AM and hand portaged all our stuff (not too far, maybe 200m) to a boat cache. We now leave at 5 AM get up there 12 hours later and the former trail has been expanded and is drivable most years. Not driving through the night is the biggest improvement."
6183490,btyreprich,2018-05-10 05:37:00,1067,"Interesting to see how other people handle their drives up. In our younger days, we'd leave after work and drive straight through to the lodge. Often times sleep an hour or two at one of those roadside pulp check stops. No way am I doing that again! Then again we were I. Our late 20s and early 30s when we did that. I'm 61 in July and agree that it takes a while for an older person to recover from a 14+ hour drive. Funny that I have no problem at all driving in the early morning and I rather enjoy it. That is after. Good nights sleep and minimal if any beers the night before!"
6183506,Baseline,2018-05-10 05:39:00,3207,"What I would do is leave a day earlier, do an overnight, check in and have a full extra day of fishing without the trip lag."
6183530,packpro,2018-05-10 05:44:00,695,"Our group is a big fan of the overnight hotel. We have had two instances in the last 10 years that required driving through the night on Friday, launching the boat and starting to fish Saturday without any sleep. It worked, but it was a long day and not very enjoyable. At the end of supper the first day, everyone crashed. Missed out on evening fishing or just sitting around the gazebo and solving the worlds problems. When we were 20 years younger it was no big deal to drive all night, catch a few hours of sleep in the car at Wilderness Air, then be good to go the next day. Now our group is age ranges from 60-75. We leave Chicago area at 8AM. Arrive in Dryden at 8PM. Our group does not travel together as we are all leaving different areas of Chicago. That night at the Hotel is a good chance to catch up, laugh, strategize, and relax. The unpacking the boat and packing the cabin gets a little chaotic the first day, but a good nights rest certainly makes that first day more enjoyable. We only have a 45 minute drive the next morning to launch. it must be popular. If we don't make the reservation in January for our June trip it can be hard to find a room. Well worth the extra $70-$80 per man."
6183546,port1042,2018-05-10 05:52:00,509,"We overnight on Friday on the way up, generally in Nestor Falls, but this spring we're staying Emo. We'll get there about 5:00 after driving about 10 hours. Saturday morning is on to Perrault Falls another 3.5 hours. Coming home we're out of camp on Saturday morning before 7:00 and home about 8:00. Overnight drives are many years behind me. I do remember taking my brother to school in Portland, OR one year. We left Wisconsin on a Friday and I flew home from Portland on Sunday afternoon."
6183586,pjshorthorn,2018-05-10 06:03:00,5654,"Regardless of where I have gone on trips, it has always been a trek getting to our destination in Canada due to where I have lived. Probably the longest day I have had ( from wake up to sleep time that night) is 19 hours. The routine would start with a wake up at 3-4 am, drive to the airport an hour, fly to Minneapolis or other transfer points, get picked up by family or friends, drive another 9+ hours, stop for dinner somewhere along the way, check into the Lamplighter hotel in Sioux Lookout, meet the rest of the group there, drink a few beers to catch up with everyone, realize that it was an hour earlier than home, get to bed about 11 pm CST and sleep really well. I would much rather overnight and finish the remaining portion of travel early the next morning. I feel more anticipation about the trip watching the sunrise come up while heading towards our fishing destination. I always hated the long overnight drives especially when everyone else was asleep even though there was supposed to be a co-pilot awake at all times PjShorthorn"
6183690,rockape,2018-05-10 06:24:00,215,"We used to drive straight through up and back from Indianapolis. BRUTAL isn't the word. My friend used to own a cabin so we didn't have an afternoon check-in time. I'd take a nap in the boat with my jig one crank above the bottom and wake to reel in a walleye. My friend sold his cabin, so we had a 3pm check-in for the past few years. We started cribbing up in IF, and it is nice to be fresh. Now we still drive straight through going home. A couple of times, we left Sioux Lookout/Perrault Falls at like 10pm. The next year the lodge owner told us we were on a suicide mission to hit a moose. We now make sure we hit the border by 10pm if we do it. 17-20 hours for me and friends, but we trade off and always have a co-pilot awake with the driver. We get home earlier, and can get a good sleep before heading back to work."
6182874,btyreprich,2018-05-09 17:26:00,1067,"We live in the greater Chicago area and fish out of Ear Falls / Lac Seul. 14 hour drive according to Mapquest. For the past several years, we have overnighted in International Falls and finished the last 4 hours driving on Saturday morning. We now have the option of checking into the lodge early evening on Friday. Now we'd have a hotel room charge and a nicer meal that same evening but I'm worried about being so very tired the next day. To get up to the lodge at a decent hour, I'm think8ng we have to leave at like 4 am or so. Just wondering how your group handles the drive to the lodge you stay at."
6182890,camp chef,2018-05-09 17:34:00,915,The older we get the less likely we are to drive more than 8 or 9 hours in a day. We spend an extra day going up and sometimes coming home. A nice evening or two in a hotel with good food drink and friends is part of our Canadian fishing itinerary.
6182945,123chadder,2018-05-09 17:43:00,429,"we have a 13 hour drive and leave at 2am to be at camp for 3-4pm(i get 4-5 hours sleep on the drive up)....organize our gear,get settled in,have a few hour fish,fish fry back at camp and a few drinks,in bed by 10....and get a good nights sleep to be fresh for the morning.....its a looong day,but worth it....i want to spend as much time in camp as possible"
6183002,Pooch,2018-05-09 18:32:00,4618,Going into camp the next day refreshed instead of setting up camp after a long drive and being dog tired the first couple days? I'd rather spend the extra dollars and time over nighting and hit the water running and awake the first day. Then again I'm seventy and been doing this a while so the new is worn off for me. I don't want to make it a rat race or a job. I want to enjoy everything about our trips.We drive fourteen hours the first day to IF then six the next morning as the camp does not want new guests in camp until after two PM Saturday on a Saturday to Saturday trip.Pooch
6183026,martinbns,2018-05-09 18:51:00,1520,"Personally, I would vote for the 14 hour drive, however I would be travelling with my wife who holds two votes on issues such as this so I would lose the vote 2-1."
6183034,drew59,2018-05-09 18:58:00,87,Yep. The night in Fort Frances or Grand Marais is a huge part of the fun. It's the time we wind down and talk about things to come the following week. A 4-5 hour the next day is a pleasure.
6183042,DaBirdman,2018-05-09 19:02:00,164,"On our family trip with wives & kids, we do an 8hr drive to IF, stay overnight in IF, then up around 7 and cross for breakfast & finish any shopping. Can't check in until 1:00, so we take it easy and it all works out nicely. Nobody is tired and after checking in & settling in, there's still a few hours left in the day to fish for those that want to. On our guys fly-in trip, we'll be driving the 12 hours to camp, and are staying overnight in a cabin before flying out the next morning. I'm sure we will be excited, but will be rested as well. Given a choice, I would always opt for an overnight stay the day prior to checking in!"
6183106,bigdaddyguns,2018-05-09 19:29:00,608,"I vote for the overnight and shorter drive in the morning. We get to camp refreshed and ready to go the next day. I go with my boys and it gives us a night out to catch up, have a few beverages, a meal and kick back for the evening/night. Last year we stayed at the LA PLACE RENDEZ-VOUS on Rainy Lake and enjoyed it sitting on the patio overlooking the lake. Crossing the day before was also a plus that I would like to make part of our routine."
6183210,BornToFish,2018-05-09 20:53:00,1224,"Greetings,I clearly vote for staying overnight near the border. It may be a fourteen hour drive according to mapquest, but you need to add in the time for fuel stops, meals and time at the border. The trip will likely come in closer to seventeen hours than fourteen hours. To me it's worth the extra night/dollars to arrive at my destination feeling fresh.I've been on trips where we pushed very long days. We drank a lot of coffee and ate venison jerky. It wasn't pretty!Driving the distance in one day will get the original poster an extra night at the lodge and morning on lake, but may cost two or three days of feeling lousy. That's not a good trade for me any more.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6183250,h8go4s,2018-05-09 21:13:00,1673,"Even switching drivers, those long hauls get tough. Even sleeping in the back seat, when it's your turn to drive, you're not as alert as you should be. I feel lucky we've never had even a close call over the years. It's better for everyone on the road if all drivers are well rested."
