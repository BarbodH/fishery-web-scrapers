1912274,camp chef,2013-07-01 10:45:00,915,We keep our 1/2 flat in bedding in two paper bags (one inside the other) in the refrigerator. They keep great and can be shaped to fit because of the paper bags. No plastic as they cannot breathe. Once you take the crawlers out do not put the back.
1902314,bus33,2013-06-27 09:44:00,289,"We are heading to Lac Seul for a week in late July. We have always gone up for the opener so no need for crawlers then. For this late trip I am going to purchase a flat of crawlers from Vados but I really have no idea how many to purchase for a week in Canada.What do you guys usually figure on for enough crawlers to last you a week?Thanks,"
1902426,cuamb,2013-06-27 10:20:00,203,We have 8 guys and go up the 2nd or 3rd week of June. We get 2 flats and have never run out. We change ice on them everyday to keep them cool and they last the week.
1902962,Mohleye,2013-06-27 13:30:00,368,"Agree if you had a flat of 500 for each 4-5 guys you'd be fine. 1/2 or even 1/3 of a crawler is all you need, depending on how big they are."
1904122,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-27 21:18:00,25,"Cuamb,Do you put the ice right on the crawlers? When we have gone, we have not been successful at preserving the crawlers and by the end of the week P.U.!Any discussion on how to preserve the crawlers would be appreciated.Freak"
1904250,JayM5209,2013-06-27 21:39:00,1050,"We take two flats of crawlers for six guys for our annual May trips. Need to cut back to one flat because we usually just finish one and really don't need two. Give the crawlers more space than the small boxes you usually get them in. A cheap styrofoam cooler is ideal. Add some additional bedding. Cover the bedding and crawlers with 5 or 6 layers of newspaper and put the ice on top of the newspaper. One of those blue ice packs works for the day, or just freeze plastic soda bottles of water. We have no problem keeping crawlers fresh and healthy for the week.Several things are critical for keeping the crawlers fresh:1. Do not forget to put a fresh ice pack in every day.2. Do not use loose ice. It will melt and the water will make a terrible mess of the bedding and eventually kill the crawlers.3. At the end of the day, never, never,never, never put crawlers you've had in the boat back into the bedding holding your supply. Just one crawler that has gotten warm and started to die will end up killing off the whole flat.4. Do not store the styrofoam cooler with your flat of crawlers under the cabin where a skunk or raccoon can find it!With just a little care you'll have no problem keeping crawlers healthy for the week."
1905002,last chance,2013-06-28 08:34:00,3262,if you have room for it the best way to keep that many worms cool and healthy for long periods of time is to buy a small dorm size fridge. or even better I bought a 12 volt cooler that has a metal grate on the inside for cooling. you cant use one that has the little fan on the inside. I think mine is like 29 quarts and I use it for 500 worms when I make a 2 week trip to erie and it keeps the worms cool and alive. I bought a cooler adaptor so I can plug the cooler into a house plug. so I can use 12 volt for the trip then plug up to 120 volt ac at the campgrounds. it is alittle of an investment to start with but you can use it for many years. I bought mine off ebay for around 75.00 including shipping.
1905482,cuamb,2013-06-28 10:53:00,203,"WWF, I do pretty much the same thing as Jay. I have an old metal cooler that I drilled a few holes in the top. I put in extra bedding and newspaper over that. I then put (2) 1/2 gallon milk jugs of ice on top. We monitor the ice and as soon as it is liquid we put in new jugs of ice. It helps to pull the dead crawlers out every day ifthere are any.I also through some corn meal in (not sure if they eat it or not). Crawlers were still healthy when we returned. I didn't pay as much attention to them when I got home and they only lasted another week."
1905674,Freytown,2013-06-28 12:11:00,770,"The ""Blue Ice Paks"" are worth the effort too. Don't risk the water-logged problem if the ice melts. I bring a good supply to bring back frozen vacuumed seal filets. A lay of blue ice on the bottom, then filets and a lay of blue ice top...like a rock when I get home."
1910586,btmbncr,2013-06-30 13:35:00,492,I made the mistake of using a regular cooler last year not styrofoam.The bedding got too wet and started a die off.I have a crawler crib for this year.I take a flat for 2 people for 2 weeks.
1911474,northernbite,2013-07-01 06:08:00,1186,"If you are in the bush as we are or where you have access I've done this if the bedding got to wet; I rake up dead pine needles and mix with the bedding. It dries it out and ""fluffs"" up the bedding. I had assigned the job of watching the crawlers to one of our fellows and he did just that, he was watching them die and didn't know it. We saved most of them with this method.Paul"
