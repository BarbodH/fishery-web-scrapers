1895386,rather-be-fishin,2013-06-24 22:40:00,429,"Going into Canada A few years ago when asked about alcohol, I too made the mistake of saying ""5 beers"".... & the border agent said 5 cases? I said no, 5 bottles of beer.... Which triggered a red flag & he immediately took out a piece of paper & started writing things down & handed me the paper & said pull over & see the agent ahead. Then they told the 4 of us to get out of the truck, uncover the boat & roll back tonneau cover & go stand in front of the truck (we felt like we were in front of a firing squad) while they proceeded to go through the cab & bed of the truck & looked in the boat. We were perfectly legal. To this day I still blame my friend who brought only 5 beers for causing us to get searched. LOL"
1895466,Catman59,2013-06-25 04:14:00,345,"We cross at Pigeon River when we go up , sometimes twice or more a year. Last year on our March trip the Canadian asked me if I knew how many times Id been through his check point. I guessed correctly"

They are still in a Watergate discovery frame of mind sometimes trying to trip you up so they can serch and find any contriband. I carry no tobacco, alcohol or firearms or seldom even a small gift. When I tell either side this info they look at me like I must be really abnormal. Maybe I am but I told them I swear sometimes they smile and send me on my way. Have not kept a fish even to eat since 1976. I like fish just would rather catch them than clean 'em,!! Have a great and safe fishing season on the water. Jimmie"

1912378,CSH Kucinski,2013-07-01 11:33:00,1340,"We just crossed to and from Canada last week at the Lewiston/Queenston bridge, up on a Tuesday evening and back on a Sunday evening. No issues or delays on either side. Both officers were very professional and friendly."
1913562,drlee,2013-07-01 18:09:00,409,"We have only crossed at Pigeon River the past few years and have always been treated in a calm, professional manner by our Canadian friends. Now, a couple of the guys are actually starting to recognize us and mention that we always come through about the same time and have been going to the same places(s) over the past few years. This time, one of the young guys brought ""strawberrita"" (or something like that) in and the border guy laughed and said, ""what the heck is that?"" When it was all over (we had to pay some duty) he said, ""And guys, don't bring any of that stuff across next year."" We all had a good laugh. Same thing on the American side...professional, courteous, always a ""welcome home"" comment. One weird thing: I have an auto rear window on my 4-runner. Knowing what I know, I had it rolled down ahead of time since the other vehicles were being given a cursory look in the back of their SUV's. The border person walked around to the back of our vehicle, looked in the window and came back to me and said (grumpy tone) ""Why is your back window down? Is the glass broken or missing?"" I rolled it up with no comment. End of story. Like I said...weird."
1913978,Wawajake,2013-07-01 19:58:00,413,"On a side note , I notice a few people lately (ussually younger crowd) use the plural ""beers"" instead of using ""beer"". I always thougt it funny that us outdoorsmen would never say ""did you see the three deers"" ...instead we say ""three deer"". I could be wrong but when did we start saying ""beers"" it just sounds wrong...... maybe it confused the border patrol, or maybe he frowned on having open cases being transported. In earlier years it was unlawful to drive with an open case of beer. So maybe that put up red flag."
1892817,Sportdog,2013-06-24 07:54:00,6735,"Before my bud and I left for our Canadian fishing trip we thought it would be fun to have a friendly wager on which customs agent would be the most amiable, Canada or USA. He bet on Canada and I bet on USA. I won. On the way into Canada when I was asked about alcohol I stated that I had ""nine beers"". His monotone voice changed and he said ""nine cases?"". I stated ""no, just nine beers"". He looked confused. I then said ""I have in my cooler nine individual bottles of beer"". He sat there a minute and with a scowl told us to go ahead. I guess nobody just brings that small amount of beer into Canada. Return trip the USA customs agent asked if we had anything to declare? I stated ""four fish that we caught."" His response was a smile and a cheerful ""Welcome Home"". Now before anyone from our northern border gets upset I realize that on the way in we are going in to another country and coming home we are just coming home. The bet was in good fun and both crossings went fine. My lesson learned......Don't declare alcohol with individual beer, do it with cases! LOL Note: We had a great time, caught a lot of fish and everyone we ran into from Canada was nice and friendly. If they will have us, we'll be back again as soon as funds allow. Thanks Canada for a dream fishing trip!"
1892977,ftfarms,2013-06-24 08:38:00,444,That's funny cause in may we had the same thing. I told them we had 10 beers and he said ten cases? I said nope ten beers he said that that wasn't enough to get us to perruilt falls and have a good week. Easiet I've ever seen it getting though the boarder both ways. I'll see how it is in July and in sept
1893001,tsquared,2013-06-24 08:45:00,57,"Just got back Sunday Morning. We had no problems going in or coming back. In fact, coming back we may have made it in under 30 seconds (including the line). It was amazing. However, we did get the scowl from US border agent, so Canada won....."
1893193,SinOrSwim,2013-06-24 10:08:00,1528,"Our last couple trips the Canada side was more friendly than the US side. It might have been a couple years ago the guy from the US kept asking me the same question in a different manner. Or, would say things like how many fish are you bringing. answer: NONE. he said ok. Then would say, okay so you just have the 4 guys in the truck and the fish you caught? NO, I DO NOT HAVE FISH!!!! He just had that smug smirk on his face. That one where they are being a Richard because they can."
1893233,LOW1,2013-06-24 10:37:00,2828,"Coming back from our trip three weeks ago we were told by the US folks that we were chosen for a random search. Took about ten minutes. We were told to wait inside the building and my kids were strongly instructed not to use cell phones. Hood was opened as was the cooler. Truck cab was briefly inspected. I don't know if luggage or anything else was searched. Supervisor kept our passports during the process.It was no big deal and everyone was professional, but not what I would call friendly.So I vote for the Canucks on the public relations front. We will be up again next week and in August and September so we'll see if there is a trend."
1893417,wallydave,2013-06-24 12:05:00,2151,"This year I would have to call it a tie!! The Canadian side,on a Friday night, was more conversational, more question and answer, ""how far do you live from Pana Il?"" Very nice guy, just some different questions. The US side, a Thursday morning, was less friendly, more professional, and still welcomed us back to the States! We'll see how the August trip goes!"
1894001,Larry S,2013-06-24 14:54:00,665,"Having done 60 plus trips to Canada since 1977,in 99% of the times the Canadian Customs Agents have been the most Professional, and far more courteous as compared to the American Customs Agents. Several times have brought extra beer, one time 3 cases another time 4 cases and been let through to Canada without being charged customs fees One time back in 1981 the American customs Agent tore my car apart looking for illegal items, they were very Rude and upon finishing the search remarked in a wise-*** tone ""Have fun putting all your crap back in your car"" Several other times the American customs kept asking if we were bringing back any Cuban cigars, we told them No, but they kept asking us in a rude way over & over again if we were sure that we didn't have any with us."
1894217,Lovetofish,2013-06-24 16:00:00,458,Never had many troubles going up and only asked to open my vecile twice coming back. But had a cranky one last summer who thought I must have been trying to smuggle fresh fruit home. He asked me if I wanted to put $300 on it?? Told me it's a $300 fine to not declare something. He pulled me over and looked through my coolers. In 25 trips up and back he was the only jerk I've ran into.
1894993,mudpusher,2013-06-24 19:52:00,248,"About five or six years ago the American side opened all the coolers, counted fish and looked at licenses. What right does our government have enforcing a Quebec license ?"
1895362,Baitslinger,2013-06-24 22:24:00,93,"Crossed at Int Falls / F-FRancis today about 4pm. Total time from paying the bridge toll to leaving the Canadian kiosk was about 3 minutes. Very fast, very professional, and just a bit of a smile when I told him we had 9 bottles of beer and two bottles of hard cider. I guess we are lightweights when it comes to partying on our fishing trips."
