1899162,Mike Kansas,2013-06-26 10:12:00,1463,"Leaving Thursday and going back to Lac Seul for our second annual trip. I'm really excited about this trip because the trip at Lac Seul two weeks ago we were on was the best fishing I have seen in 70+ trips to Lac Seul. I think this years awesome fishing is due mainly to a great Class Year of Walleye. This seems to happen every 6 to 7 years. The Walleye born in one year have great growing conditions and ample forage base and they prosper better than other years conditions allow. The reports I'm seeing from Lac Seul support this theory with many fisherman having awesome days on the water of not only lots of fish but more than their fair share of Big Girls. We are staying next week at Lost Island Lodge on the south shore close to Hudson Ontario. This will be our 8th year there and the people who run Lost Island are as good as it gets. Great service, cabins, boats and they are truly interested in their customers having an enjoyable and succesful time. This is the trip that three of us take our wives on and we fish with Basil who is a Guide out of Lost Island. Basil knows this lake as well as anybody and better than most and he loves seeing his guests have great days on the water. We spend the majority of our time in areas like Bear Narrows, Banana Island, Grassy, and Canoe Bay. We fish a lot on mid lake humps and sunken islands and I can honestly tell you that in the past the 6 of us have had many 400 to 500 fish days. I'm expecting that and maybe better this year and I know we will catch some Big Girls, maybe even beat our best that was caught by my wife a 31 1/2"" beauty caught on her favorite jig a Char Master Glitter Jig. Got to finish packing now. Best of luck to all of you and be safe on the water. Mike Kansas"
1899210,IaDave,2013-06-26 10:31:00,476,Make sure you bring some of Basil's favorite-Obama jigs and keep the snot rockets out of his boat. I fished with him for 3 days and it was great. Quite a guy and oh yeah his wife makes the best desserts I think I have had.
1899234,Mike Kansas,2013-06-26 10:42:00,1463,"He does love Obama jigs and I will make sure I bring him some. I think she makes better desserts than the job Basil does with a landing net on a SnotRocket. It's always funny how he helps the wives land a Snot Rocket and takes their pictures and tells them ""Great Job' but when I hook up a Snot Rocket he trys to cut my line. Mike Kansas"
1899442,bigwalleye1,2013-06-26 12:06:00,2632,"OK, I'll bite... What's an ""Obama jig""? I have my thoughts, but can't believe they cast a jig in that shape, so I had to ask....."
1899498,Mike Kansas,2013-06-26 12:12:00,1463,That is excatly why we use them...They Get Bites. It is simply a reference from a person who is not an Obama fan. However I like your thoughts on the design.
1899914,cuamb,2013-06-26 15:19:00,203,"Mike, We will have our spouses there in 2 weeks (Houseboat around Taylor). Does Basil guide for people not staying at Lost Island. I contacted Colin and Ben, they are both booked that week.Thanks"
1900298,KC Walleye,2013-06-26 18:14:00,274,"Good luck Mike, hope your trip is as good as your first one this year. Thanks for the help earlier this spring via PM. I head to Onaway on the 5th. Can't wait"
1900338,Mike Kansas,2013-06-26 18:29:00,1463,Basil only guides out of Lost Island. He is a fulltime employee of the lodge. Good luck on your trip and catch a bunch of fish. Be safe Mike Kansas
1900346,Mike Kansas,2013-06-26 18:32:00,1463,"Thanks for the good luck, it always helps. You have the best of luck on your trip and be safe. Let me know how you do. Mike Kansas"
1900658,orchard frank,2013-06-26 20:13:00,1900,"Please give our best to Basil and Vivian, as well as Shane and Chris and everyone. I had a great phone conversation with Jim Hayes just last night, and rekindled all the great memories of the most wonderful place in Ontario. We think of all of them often, some of the best times of our lives. Frank and Esther Schultz"
