Last time I used heavy bullet-head hair jigs - let them drop to the bottom and reeled up. Caught a couple smaller ones this way. I'd love to hear the best way to fish them this time of year, what type of structures and depths, and types of lures. Thanks!"
1899338,zeebee,2013-06-26 11:30:00,1144,Best LT fishing Ive come across In LOTW is the area around Three Sister Islands. Ive caught many downrigging a LenThompson firetiger spoon (larger size) 50-70 ft down. That spoon outfished four charter boats combined last time I was out there.....enjoyed watching the expressions on their customers as I was in a 16' Lund and they were all on costly charters. Suppose you could jig too but never tried.

1900026,Ver88,2013-06-26 16:10:00,114,"I am not an expert, but I have had good luck jigging near the bottom in 90 to 120 feet or water, along steep drop offs. I like to use a 1 oz jig with a 6 inch white kalin grub. I have caught a lot of nice lakers using this technique."
1900834,downriverbob,2013-06-26 20:35:00,880,"Most of the lake trout I have caught have been trolling and not as deep as others have talked about. Using deep diving cranks that get down to 27 -35"" and catching suspended fish. I have also caught them on spoons trolling deep with downriggers. This past winter my wife and I fished Whitefish Bay for lake trout through the ice, tube jigs were supposed to be the ""best"" lure. We had our best luck on jigging spoons. It was a blast catching them jigging so I am going to try jigging this summer. We will try a combination of tube jigs, jigging spoons, and I am going to try a blade bait that I have used for walleye.

1902770,LOW1,2013-06-27 12:08:00,2828,"There is a group of islands in Whitefish Bay of LOTW referred to as the Three Sisters. They are northeast of Bell Island and west of Russell Island. This is west and south of Sioux Narrows. The deepest portions of Whitefish Bay are nearby, so it is near prime lake trout area. I haven't seen charter boats there, but many guide boats are in the area. But from my view (I could easily be wrong on this) few guides frequently target trout on Whitefish Bay.If my memory from 40+ years ago is correct, my family took a charter boat (much larger than a typical guides boat) from Baudette MN and fished near what was also called Three Sisters. This would be quite a few miles south of the Three Sisters in Whitefish Bay."
1914266,Bill Krejca,2013-07-01 20:58:00,6107,Re: 3 sisters - Just south of Hay Island in Sabaskong are islands referred to as same. It also seems a number of other larger lakes have a spot with that popular name. Bill
