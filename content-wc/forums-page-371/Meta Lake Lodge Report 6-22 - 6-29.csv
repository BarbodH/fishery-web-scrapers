1912514,tparker,2013-07-01 12:09:00,100,"Just back from a week at Meta Lake Lodge. Short flight out of Nakina went as planned, and we were fishing by mid-morning on Sat. This was my second trip to Meta, the other being in 2011. We found most of our fish in 12-14 fow. Jig and a minnow most of the time for walleye, and the fishing was great. Two okay days, and five very good days of fishing. We didn't count fish, but our boat caught hundreds of fat, healthy walleye during the week, that averaged 18-19 inches. Nothing bigger than 23"" but numerous 20-22's each day. Whoever said walleyes don't fight much, has never been into fish like this before. We made the run over to Ara Lake a couple of days, with the same result, if not better. The one morning we tried to keep count was incredible. Got to Ara about 10:15, very windy, but it was blowing the right way for a perfect drift from a real shallow rock pile to deeper water. Watch the depthfinder, when it hit 11 ft., jigs in the water, when it hit 12 ft., set the hook. Fish every time. Run back up, and drift down again. Only caught 3 eaters, the rest were all overs. Fat, 19"" average. When our count hit 27, my buddy changed to a spoon to try for pike or larger walleye. It didn't work for him, but I caught another 15, so we headed over to the shorelunch spot at 12:30 with our number at 42. It was a great two plus hours of fishing. During the week we found 3 or 4 other spots that produced similar results. Biggest pike our group caught was 39 3/8"", with another 39, and a 36.5"" that was the fattest fish I've ever seen. 4 others that hit 34"", and again very fat healthy fish. Most of the bigger pike were caught trolling jointed crankbaits. Caught quite a few walleye in Ara trolling this way also. Our accomodations were fine, and John and his staff did a great job for us, including making sure we could watch the Blackhawks on Sat. and Mon. night. our group of 13 had a great time watching the Hawks win the Cup up in the lodge, thanks to John. All in all, a great trip, with the best fishing i have ever had on a trip. This was my 5th Canada trip in the last 6 years, and it couldn't have gone better."
