We're staying at the cabin in Root Bay.Anyone have experience in that part of the lake? I've fished for Walleye some, but being from KS we typically chase the whisker fish so fishing the great north will certainly be a new experience for me.Any info on general areas ( or fishing reports for that matter) would be greatly appreciated!"
1845977,Lovetofish,2013-06-07 09:18:00,458,Your going to have a good time. I haven't fished there but know some who have. Go to Slate Falls website and he has a list of what to bring. Have a good rain suit and boots along.

Also, if you are a customer his annual newsletters about the season always make for a good laugh.One thing you can guarantee is everything will be in great shape when you are at his cabins. http://www.slatefallsoutposts.com/Do..._of_Wisdom.pdf"

Really looking forward to it.I spent a summer in Sask and fished Last Mountain Lake with limited success, mainly on pike but that was all from shore for the most part.Plan is to find structure find fish just like any other body of water or species of fish."
1846305,stjoeguy,2013-06-07 11:17:00,979,"I've never been on that part of St. Joe. We'll be 1/2 way down the lake, east of you, near Carling Island, 6/22 - 6/29. On that part of the lake, we fish wind-swept points and shorelines and any rock reefs we can find, with mainly 3/8 ounce jigs and Gulp or twister tails. We pitch jigs and plastic, while other groups troll and use live bait. I've been emailing other St. Joe guys and trading hotspots. Pretty much any structure spot will be holding fish and anything you throw at them will catch fish. I haven't fished any river current areas, but i'm sure Verne will have good advice. PM me if you want to talk about Lake St. Joseph. Give us a report when you return and have a great time!"

Any color, any bait, every spot we tried produced fish, and all great quality size. Average fish for us was around 19-21"", no big hogs though, biggest was a 24"". Biggest pike was 34"", and we lost several very nice pike close to the boat when they would bite off our walleye rigs.Hoping to make a return trip next summer with SFO, it was a great experience and wishing we were still there."
