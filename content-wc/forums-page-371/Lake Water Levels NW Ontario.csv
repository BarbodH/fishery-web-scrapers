1907802,Andyeye,2013-06-29 08:10:00,179,Our group is heading up the 2nd of August. We stay at Cygnet Lake west of Minaki and fish there and some of the other lakes in the area. Last year water levels were very low and we were unable to fish in the Swan Lake Resevoir and some of the small lakes in the area because of this. I was hoping someone could give me some water level information. The falls running out of Cygnet into Swan Lake was barely a trickle last year. Thanks for any information.
