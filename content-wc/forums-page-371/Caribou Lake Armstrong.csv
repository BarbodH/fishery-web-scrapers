1911626,bode,2013-07-01 07:28:00,39,Wondering if anyone has fished this lake recently for walleye. Will be going the end of the month and guessing the typical patterns won't work due to late ice and am guessing current water temps are below normal.Typically we target fish in 25-35 feet of water around islands or underwater humps.Any tips on current conditions would be greatly appreciated.Thanks
