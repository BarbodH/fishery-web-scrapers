A lot of my research for choosing this spot came from his valuable posts on this forum & OFC. Thanks Mike! Brad says hi! He had a big grin when I said that you were asking for him. So with that said let's start with the outfitter. Very nice folks! Really happy with 7 lakes wilderness camps. Myself & my wife drove 24 hrs. (2 days) to Nakina from New Jersey.....It was worth it! Keep in mind I am no walleye specialist, very few around my area. Flew in Sat. June 15, Flew out June 23. River was a little bit high, went down everyday as we had almost no rain. Weather was fantastic cool at night, warm days. Fishing was pretty good in my book, we averaged 20 walleye a day and 10 pike a day. Guys we did not get up to early, our usual day was 10am to 3pm then back out around 6 pm till almost 11 at night. We ate dinner after midnight! We found some hotspots right away and I saved those for the evening bite. We spent the morning's searching for new spots, trolling for the big pike, trying to reach the trout fishing, moose sightings & checking out 2 old abandoned camps. On our last morning we found proably the best spot of the trip, 3 walleye's on 3 casts. We drifted it for many more. Tried everything worms, live minnows, plugs, twister tails/jigs, for us metal worked the best. But they all caught some. These are some nice fish big & fat. Largest 25"" . Plenty of pike lots in the high 20's I lost a monster at the boat. Fellows I swear he was darn near 4 foot long! I am a trout fisherman all my life, and was really hoping for some action. I did manage a respectable 16"", access was very hard, upstream & down and really did not get to fish the fast water. Quite frankly the rapids scared the heck out of my wife, and there were no trails our portages to be found except one upstream. I did do some bushwacking, man it's hard work. If I was with another man & had a pruning saw & looping shears we very well would have been able to reach some quality spots. Definetly need waders here! Oh & the bugs they were horrible we went through a lot of Ben's 98. Cabin was fine, boats good, it was a really wonderful trip. Hoping to get back that way again sooner then later. I always appreciate all the information I have gained from the forum, glad I could give some back! Tight lines Kenny ( beer slayer)"

That's a spot I'd love to fish one day.Cheers"
1909290,beer slayer,2013-06-29 22:21:00,33,"Hey Mike - Brad just added on to the cabin last year. I would call it rustic, good stove, smaller fridge (worked fine) He had a small generator to run lights & the shower. I never turned it on, I am a coleman lantern man from way back The shower was not working properly, we just jumped in the lake with bio-degradable soap a little cold at first. standard outhouse way in the back, gas grill did most of the cooking on. Plenty of propane. It sits on a small hill with a nice view. The dock is kinda so-so, 4 guys would be tight here for sure. It is a beautiful section of river, not real deep. Some really nice pools downstream, but how the heck do you get there? Gotta be some nice trout down there! While our fishing was pretty slow in the mornings, we had a ball. I think our late starts did not help.We did pretty good in the evenings, an experienced fisherman like yourself would outfish us quite a bit. Mike if you decide to try this spot, be glad to have you call me, e-mail etc. and I will give you as much info as I can. Good fishing , Kenny"
