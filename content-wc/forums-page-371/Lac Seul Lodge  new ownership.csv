1911666,cruiseforever,2013-07-01 07:38:00,177,I have not been to Lac Seul Lodge since Dan sold it. Has there been many changes to the place? Thinking I would like to go back next year.

Rod was a guest at the Lodge every year since 2006 and he has a good idea of what the people like. He has expanded the parking area for boats and the vehicles driven in by the outpost folks. Dan installed a new septic system prior to leaving so there are no problems in that respect. The cabins are still well maintained and very clean. Rod also continues to upgrade the boat fleet with new boats and motors. I just got back a week ago from a two week stay with my wife and Son and am headed back at the end of July for another week with the guys. If you liked the Lodge while Dan ran it I think you will enjoy a stay with Rod and Lorita. By the way, don't be surprised if Dan drops by while you are there. Steve"
1913234,cruiseforever,2013-07-01 15:45:00,177,Thanks for the reply Steve. It's been 7-8 years since I have been there. It is time to go back. It is one of the most relaxing places I have been to.
