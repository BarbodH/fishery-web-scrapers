1892913,Jack77,2013-06-24 08:25:00,168,We have two memebers of our group that have had DUI's. One was more than five years ago but less than 10 and the other was less than 5 years ago. I am looking for people's experiences since the new rules went into affect in March of 2012? The information at the links below seem pretty straight forward. I am looking for actual experience with this and how it went. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqQIqKbV8H4http://noto.ca/bordercrossingThanks in advance for your help

Uncle had a DUI 6 or 7 years ago, got his paperwork a few months ago, and he was across the border in 5 minutes. I know a couple that tried to get approval at the border ( husband and wife had dui over 5 years ago). This let the ""discretion of the agent"" come into play. They were turned back."
1898522,Jack77,2013-06-26 07:06:00,168,Thanks Roscoe. This what I was looking for. The website and youtube video make it sound so easy. One of the them can apply for reabhilation and the other I think should just probably wait a few years.
