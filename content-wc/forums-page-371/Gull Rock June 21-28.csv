While there were no 30's we had several 27 to 28 inch eyes as the largest of the trip. My son landed a 41 inch pike to top of the week. We were primarily tolling crawler rigs in 7 to 12 feet of water early in the week followed by 17 to 22 feet later. Many of the 20 to 25 inch fish were caught around boot island. The larger and perhaps the best spot for numbers was the boot. Ranger bay produced a lot of eaters in 4 ft of water. It was fun to throw Salmo Hornets on ultra lights!houndog

Fished some of the windblown main lake points hot spot in one area was 2-5FOW, then we found them in the 10-15fow range on another spot.As the week went fishing was still good but we noticed mayflys and the fishing was starting to slow a lil and found fish stacked on the side of an island from 13-22fow.Can't wait untill September!"
