I've been spending most of my time on Botsford and Minnitaki in the past five years and I still don't feel like I know either lake. There's more places on the lakes that I haven't checked out than those I have. Last month I made my first trip to Lac Seul and had such a banner day I feel like I'm being pulled in three ways at once now. (I know, ) I average over 50 days fishing a year and its not enough. (I'm beginning to think I have a problem!)"
