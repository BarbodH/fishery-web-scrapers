1122045,5 of Diamonds,2009-07-18 19:47:00,151,"I'm working on a trip to the Gouin Reservoir through Caesar's Lodge. I'm particularly interested in the Caesar's Lodge outpost camp called Gouin 4. Anything any one could add on this camp or the water itself would be extremely helpful (for that matter any of their outpost camps). Primary pursuit is Walleye, both quality and quantity. No interest in Pike. I know there is another Gouin thread but I'm trying to focus on this outfitters' camps and water. Thanks for the help."
1122187,Indiana Lou,2009-07-19 15:36:00,194,"Five of Diamonds, we were there last June 3-10th 2008. I'm not sure which outpost we were at but I think it was the one on Lake Simard(sp?). It was about 30-40 minute ride by float plane from the main lodge area. The boats were adequate but the lodging was no Holiday Inn! It does have inside plumbing and everything runs off of propane (lights, fridge, stove,etc). There's no communication with the outside world unless you have a satellite phone. As for the fishing, we caught plenty of walleye nothing bigger than 25"" and also a number of pike between 25-40"". The only other fish we caught were white fish. There didn't seem to be any bass or panfish. Also we were able to portage to other lakes where there were boats/gas waiting for us. Hope this helps. Feel free to e-mail if you have additional questions or make another post. Lou By the way, we drove up from western Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh) approximately 15 hours."
1123036,5 of Diamonds,2009-07-22 14:36:00,151,"Hey Lou:Thanks for taking the time to respond and the info. I know what that drive is like as we are from the Gettysburg PA area. As I get older, there just is something about these remote fly-in trips that become a part of who you are. I love everything about them. I'm going to do 2 trips next year. Best."
1123218,NYBowHunter,2009-07-23 09:00:00,35,"Hi 5... If I were you I would consider using a different outfitter. My family and I used this outfit from 1985 - 1995. The boats, refrigerators and especially the motors were always in bad shape - we once had to row for hours. The last straw came in '95 when they flew us in on a Saturday and flew our beer in the following Wednesday!! We even went to Obedjiwan, the native american reservation there but of course no alcohol! You don't mess with our beer!! Big nono. Anyway, this outfitter was originally good but was take over by the owner's son, Oliver who was the SOB in this case. I do understand that he has been forced out of the company and is being run by another family member so it may be better now but I'll never take the chance again. We've been using Air Melacon ever since and they are a top notch outfitter. Unfortunately they just sold the Baie du Nord cabins they own so I don't know what outfitter we'll use in the future - maybe Nemio. Hope this helps."
1124792,Guest,2009-07-29 14:03:00,0,The lodge was a dump. I was shocked at the condition of the main lodge. the photos on the web site are at least ten year s old. People were falling though the dock at the main lodge. The owner was very disorganized and did not have much time for guests. The planes were late and hours late in getting you to the lakes and back. It seems like things have changed at Ceasars.
1128859,Guest,2009-08-14 17:20:00,0,"Hi five of diamonds ,a little late but ceasars is a dump . Who ever said Oliver is a SOB is being nice. We now use Air Tamarac who is top notch"
1128950,cnydave,2009-08-15 06:24:00,33,"Hi five.....I have not fished the gouin in several years but when i did i used an outfitter called Cargair , he is out of St. michele desaints , (sp?). We flew into an area they call the east bay camps , and we stayed in camp #8...I never caught so many walleyes in my life as we did there.The outfitter was very professional , and also had a great time with the area camp care taker....We did not catch any large pike, up to 38"" but we caught a lot of very nice wallaeys. I have been thinking about taking my granson up there maybe next yr. I can tell ya that there are a lot of bears there, we had one get into the camp, that was a real ball cleaning up that mess...Take care.cnydave."
1133512,Guest,2009-09-02 22:49:00,0,"Hi guys. Have been going to ceasars for thirteen years. This was the last time. The bussiness was sold by oliver sob to his cousin george. Oliver is not well liked now by his family because all he did was take the money and not put anything back into the camps. He knew he was going to get rid of it so he ran it into the ground. George is trying to get it back in shape but he,s got one **** of a mountain to climb. All the camps are shot,the boats all leak, the fridges only work halve the time etc. It,s going to take a ton of cash to get it back to where it was. We had a lot of great trips but this last time sucked! Went to Benny,s private camp. Not my idea of a wilderness experiance. Thinking about Tamarac next year. George lost his pilots license for a year for fudging his flight log, or so I was told. He used air mount lauriare and it,s costing him a bundle. Aprox $600 an hour. He won,t be in bussiness long paying that kind of money out to fly his customers. Unless he gets some financial backing from benny and his father crazy george, I wouldn,t be surprized if ceasars goes belly up like a dead fish. Best of luck to all."
1134437,Esox Angler,2009-09-08 07:45:00,102,"Guys, You really have to take it easy on the bashing. 1. Yes Olivier was a jerk, but he's gone.2. George Jr is trying to return the place to it's former glory.3. I go every other year since 2000. I have never had these ""horrible"" experiences and stayed in a ""Dump"". What the heck do you expect up there? A Hyatt hotel? This isn't Athabasca, Ganglers, or Wollaston. It's a pretty inexpensive way to catch some serious fish. Maybe my Fiancee, my friends, and myself are cut from some tougher material than most of those who whine about the conditions, but I doubt it, we just adapt and overcome. Leaky boats? Rubber bands around the plugs cured most of those, some Gorilla glue fixed the rest. Never had an issue with the generators other than water in the fuel (we filtered it). Motors wont start? Try changing out the fuel or clearing the filter. Fridge issues? Check the pilot light! I mean, seriously, you're up in the F'n nothwoods baby! Have some fun with it. I had Some issues with Nancy lake, too darn clear, caught most of our fish at night using lindy rigs in 8-12 feet of water, caught some on original rapala #11 in perch pattern including a northern over 25#( it maxed out the 25# scale I had at the time). Hammered the eyes in the 18-26"" range. Bob lake...ahhh Bob. We caught Eyes to 8#, lost some boomers surely over 10#. (No more florocarbon, fireline crystal only) Northerns to 23#. I have a graphite replica of my 20# 47 3/4"" trophy. Main Lodge is always a party, with a fun walk to choquette 45 minutes away you can catch monsters and numbers all day. Fly outs to day lakes were fun also, my fiancee had a 36"" northern jump INTO the boat while she was fighting it. Great times... So maybe I got my feet muddy & wet, maybe the loggers ruined the trail to south lake, maybe mice ate my powerbars in the night, maybe the planes were late on occaision, maybe we didn't have contact with the outside world, maybe the road in was in poor shape, maybe I didn't catch a trophy every other cast, maybe it wasn't a storybook vacation, maybe we saw wild moose for the first time, maybe we saw pine martens for the first time, maybe we heard wild wolves howl for the first time, maybe we hand fed red squirrels popcorn...Oh yeah, it was the Northwoods of Quebec and WE loved every minute of it and can't wait to go back Next Year!!!EA"
1392567,5 of Diamonds,2012-02-10 17:38:00,151,"Spoken like a true professional. I've known Olivier for more than 20 years. I've fished @ several of his camps (Hanotaux, Little Benny, Mattawa & Simard) multiple times. I've not, nor has anyone in any of the groups I've been with, had any negative experience w/ either him, Benny or Anita. Olivier, for lack of a better term, was 'bred' for this, that being an Outfitter. He grew up around the business and knows how to run a business and most importantly, he knows how to treat his customers.I can only hope that those who know how to post here also know how to read. Take him @ his word w/ confidence and bring closure to the perpetual speculation and rumors about him and his business.Good Luck to Caesar's North Camps and all of your customers.Terry"

Weather got crappy the last 3 days and fishing really slowed down. 400 walleye and 100 pike for the week. The largest pike was 45"" and alot in the 30""-40"" range. Boats and cabin were great and we had no issues with anything. A group that flew into Super caught 2,230 fish for the week!!!!!! But they have gone there for 12 straight years and know the lake really well, but its still one awesome week of fishing."

1247882,Guest,2010-11-09 10:05:00,0,"I have been going to Caesar's since Benny owned it back in the 80th,s...He was a hustler but always had a great time...When Oliver, is son, took over he brought it to another level...the service increase and he start building shower everywhere...One thing is sure ! you can trust his word...when he sold it to is cousin things started to go down but fortunally we heard Oliver was back and decided to go back again this year! We were at Gouins 3 this year ( same as last year) and you can see the changes...new dock ,service A-1, new second fridge, overload same day etc... I never had any problem with Oliver and he has always make sure he kept is promisses to us...never any extra cost and a great welcome and service... We are going back again in 2011 ( we will try to beat our 543 fish caught this year) and we are happy he is back in the business and after is 3 years out he seems full of energy! I highly recommand it! The Haush brothers!"

The boats leaked and one of the motors needed constant work to keep it running.The cabin was full of mice and the screens were worthless. Mattresses were old. But the fishing was great. LOTS of walleye and pike. Last year we went with Air Tamarac to the goiun about 2 miles away. We went to cabin # 41. Would highly recommend that outfitter. We had gone over to gouin 2 Caesars and it looked deserted with the dock not even in the water. I guess they must have fixed it up this past spring. We are looking for another outfitter this year to try somewhere new. Thinking of O`Sullivan lake lodge."

1392419,Olivier Brossard,2012-02-10 12:55:00,2,"I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of the history of these two outfits. My parents Benny and Anita Brossard started Caesar's Lodge over 40 years ago and built it into one of the nicest and most efficient outfitters in Quebec.When they wanted to retire in 1993, I, Olivier Brossard bought the outfit and kept the name Caesar's Lodge. I ran it successfully for 13 years. During this time I got married, had 2 children and decided to spend more time with them, so I sold Caesar's Lodge to my cousin George Brossard, Jr. and retired.George has owned the business since 2007, I was not involved, nor did I have any business connections with him after the change of ownership (we had a falling out). At the end of the 2009 season, George was having touble taking care of this huge enterprise and meeting his financial obligations so I got the 2 float planes back in lieu of final payment and decided to come out of retirement and bought all the trophy fishing lakes from him: Hanotaux, Nancy Lake, Bob lake, Little Gouin, Super, Impossible, Little Benny, Larouche, Simard, Gouin 1,2,3 & 4, but only these lakes.So I started a new business in 2010 with my friend and long time employee and pilot Jean-Lou Simard and we called it Caesar's North Camps & ETA Aviation Inc. (I kind of kept the Caesar's part of the name in memory of all the great years I had in the past .) Our new business offers fly-in trophy fishing trips for Walleye and Northern Pike as well as bear and moose hunting, but European plan only (no meals or guides).Since I cam back the satisfaction of our clientele at Caesar's North Camps is 100% and we spare no effort to make every client's vacation with us everthing they could wish for...Jean Lou and I would like to say we are very sorry for your troubles if you booked a trip with George and Caesar's Lodge in 2011. We as part of Quebec's Outfitters, know that something like this is terrible for all of our businesses as well as the reputation of our province. I don't know what is happening with George, nor do I know if he had a heart attack this past spring and I can not reach him on any phone lines either, which as you probably know have all been cut. What I do know is that Caesar's Lodge is officially closed down, due to management problems on his part and will not re-open in the future.If you had a deposit with George for the season 2011 and you wish to book with us, we will be happy to discuss arrangements including the possibility of a better price for you. We are doing this because we really believe that what happened to you is not right nor fair and it saddens me greatly that the name Caesar's Lodge which my parent's and I worked so hard on, has been turned into something that is giving people bad memories instead of great ones...I hope to have the chance to serve you soon and show you a really great fishing or hunting vacation in Quebec, Canada.Sincerely Yours,Olivier BrossardOwner of Caesar's North Camps & ETA Aviation Inc."
1224711,Guest,2010-08-03 09:05:00,0,"I'm going know with Caesar's North camps where ""bull****"" do not exist...What ever Oliver tells you, it's the truth! Georges and is father our both big bull****ers they will make you believe that Oliver is the big reason why all the operation is falling but the reality of all it's them who tryied to destroyed Oliver and is family. You can't imagine how those people are capable of...there like evil. And remember...they will make you believe every thing that they want! The only reason why Georges doesn't fly is because he has no insurance and is ******g dangerous has a pilot...Please, for your safety...don't fly with him. And for the fishing.....he sold all the best locations to Oliver. He will probably try to convince you that is lakes are as good as the north but...again it's a lie. He's liying like is breeding...just like is father! For those who is ""*****ing"" againts Oliver you are probably not good inform or you've been believing all they told you!"
1224810,NYBowHunter,2010-08-03 15:52:00,35,^ Hi Oliver - how's the fishing?
1224843,octanehi5,2010-08-03 17:45:00,1104,"You have to remember one thing when you book any outfitter up north, If he delivers the fishing trip that he sold you,to your expectations of your booking with him, then he did his part of the bargan. I always ask myself a few ?s one ,after a week of staying and fishing would I go back the nexted yr. two did he improve his camps (up grade) Docks, fish house, Bachousa (**** house), new frige, motors ,boats. cabins. three Did I get my moneys worth. most of the outfitters in the great nord are pretty good they would not be in busness very long if they were not. I have a favorate, not the best cabins, but the best boats,the lac is the best fishing that me and my crew have ever fished and we are 58 yrs old been around a while, fishing up in Quebec over 25 yrs, Air Tamarac , Lac Hebert hands down. very good people to do busness with. just my two cents worth Ron"
1230505,bloom08,2010-08-25 10:37:00,13,"Went to Caesars North Camp the end of July. Haven't been there the past 2 years since the plane crash. We went to Bob Lake for the week. We had great weather all week with a bit of rain every once in a while. For the week with just two people we caught 305 fish. Most of the days we were on the water at about 7 to 730 am. On the south lake we were catching a alot of blue walleye and lots of pike. On the main lake most of the fish were walleyes with some pike. We jigged most of our trip. No big pike but a few in the 35-39 inch range. Lots of walleye 2 to 4 pounds with two big walleye being caught for the week. 26 inches 7 pounds 10 oz. and a 28 inch 8 pound 13 oz walleye. We drove in to clova which was about a 3hr 30min drive. First time on the road so we took it slow because wasn't sure how this road compared to the old dirt road in. Road was in great shape. When we got there oliver wasn't there but Jean Lou was. First thing he offered us was a cold beer from the fridge. Then we got down to paying the rest of our balance. The price was the same that he had given us during the year with the taxes and all. We stayed right across from there wooden lodge in a hotel, think we paid 34 bucks for the night. Worked out good and recommend going in day before and staying night and flying out next morning. Olivier picked us up at the end of our stay. When we talked to him he said he made it a point to get us since he didn't fly us and or meet us on the 1st day. He said with his operation which is smaller than when he ran the main camp it allows him an opportunity to see every client that comes and makes it a point to see them. Our camp was in great condition and he said he is still updating other north camps still. Every meeting i've had with Olivier has been great. Never charged me more than what he said and has always been a pleasure to deal with."
1230580,octanehi5,2010-08-25 15:37:00,1104,"It will take a few yrs to get his cabins and equipment in tip top shape, I know for a fact that there little benny lac (petete Herbert) is a great place to fish, the fish from both lacs spawn in the same river.For yrs. they took out all the money they made at there camps. now it will take some time to get them back to there hayday state. the lacs like the gouin and north of that will always be good as long as they are not over fished. The fishing at lac hebert has a slot limit , take and eat the fish from 14"" - 20 "" only take 4 per person to eat until you eat them,then 4 more. only take 4 fish home walleyes. anything over or under that size has to go back in the lac. we have noticed the average size of the walleyes caught has been increasing every yr for three yrs now. We are to the point that the fishing is so good that if its not 19-20""s it goes back in the lac. 8 walleyes makes one **** of a shore lunch for 4 guys"
1230629,Guest,2010-08-25 19:18:00,0,I just returned from caesars yesterday and it was a great trip less the 5 days of rain. All equipment worked well motors apeared to be newer boats did leak a touch but nothing you cant take care of with a coffee can. Oliver is back on the scene as he bought back all control of the outpost camps from his cousin george who now runs the main lodge. Oliver was great and a pleasure to deal with as well as his partner john. I guess his 3 years of retirement with his family has made him turn a new leaf. As for the camps i know he has just rebuilt a few and im sure it will take some time to do all. But i felt the camp was more than adequate and quit comfortable they are however deer camp style and probably not for the wives. But arent we there to fish anyway. And for the fishing that was excellent. A return trip is in the works. Enjoy.
1230691,octanehi5,2010-08-26 06:07:00,1104,"Its good to hear that things are turning around at caesars. they own the rights to some very nice lacs. There are alot of fishermen to fill all the outfitters camps. As I said before if they live up to your expectations of the trip, It was a good trip"
1231136,vteye,2010-08-27 21:28:00,812,"Look up Barrage du Gouin an stay at the outpost camps. Owners are great, caretake is very helpful, top shelf cabins, 20 hp yami 4 strokes and fishing is good.

We heard this lake was closed this year? Does any one have any info/experience with this lake or any of the other southern camps. Fish expectations etc. DM
1232435,saradog1994,2010-09-01 19:22:00,5,"Went to Caesars North Camps first week of August. Had a great time. Stayed at the Gouin 2 outpost. Cabin was great. New mattresses, two good refrigerators and a real stovetop. Toilets and shower were at a smaller cabin on the site, convenient and easy to get to. The resovoir was very low but did not affect the fishing. There were only 2 of us but we got nearly 200 fish, about 50 were pike, about 10 big suckers. Biggest walleye a bit over 5 pounds, pike nice but nothing huge. Great place to fish. This was my second trip this year and I will no doubt be back. By the way, on the way up a tire on the car began to leak. While we were gone Oliver had it fixed right there in town."

1210403,saradog1994,2010-06-15 16:54:00,5,"The boat was fine. Great for 2 adults, would be OK for 3 provided no one is a 300 pounder. The boat did not leak at all, in fact I had to add water so the fish finder would work better. The motor was a new 4hp Mercury. The lake is about 3 miles by 1 mile so you don't need any bigger. This was my 4th trip to this lake since 1993. A little less fish than some of the other trips, but the wind was a problem for about half the trip. about 60 decent walleye and a dozen or so pike, most pike caught on top water plugs. Nothing terribly large. A few 3 lb walleye and a couple of 8 -10 lb walleye. Threw all back except a dozen or so walleyes for dinner. A couple of suckers too. no bugs to speak of but by now they have to be on the prowl."

1214884,Guest,2010-06-30 12:33:00,0,"just got back from a trip with caesars north camps (12th year in a row). once again another awesome trip. our group caught just under 1700 fish (pike & walleyes) for the week. just like esox angler and saradog1994 stated sure it's not a plush hotel - but who wants that in the canadian wilderness. sure sometimes the plane is late or your beer is late but this is wilderness time - no clocks - mother nature dictates when the planes can fly. sometimes the mice visit at night, sometimes your feet get wet, sometimes a motor wont start, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes - oh well. I go there to escape the modern conveniences( although the running water,hot showers and toilets in the cabins is nice). the whole caesars crew has always done a great job at providing exactly what I signed up for - a week of fishing in canada. we go there to fish and fish we do. cant think of a better way to spend a week with friends and family. only 51 more weeks til next year - cant wait!!!!!!"

Things should go a lot smoother now.We never had a problem, except when the Brand New Mercury motors were the first ones made in China. Did spend a lot of time fixing those Chinese excuses for boat motors, but that was not Caesars fault.I always found they did everything within their power to meet any expectations or special needs we had.Going back this month."" Last time i was there, George Jr crashed the plane on Bob Lake and we had to pull them from the water.""Gulp! We nearly met.Our schedules lined up for booking either Bob or Simard. We flipped a coin and chose Simard, or that would have been us.It is the bush. It's not Vegas.Something I learned a long time ago: if pizza delivery is available, the fishing is bad.Something else I learned a long time ago: outfitters that wipe a@@s play to the lowest common denominator concerning fishing because they do not like wiping."

1221238,Ghurd,2010-07-21 11:24:00,2,"We (only my wife and myself) got back a few days ago from Caesar's North Camps. Little Gouin.Everything was perfect.Cabin was great and well maintained (all level and air tight), boats were fine, etc.Was a bit disappointed to see 4HP 4-stroke Mercury at first, but it is far more than adequate for that lake (lots and lots... and lots more... rocks, and that's all I will say about that). Flew out of Clova on time. Flew out of Little Gouin a few minutes before the scheduled 2 hour window.Man was it hot! No bugs except horse/deer flies.Walleye fishing was amazing. Almost jumping in the boat.Pike fishing was decent most days. 2 great days. Quite a few big ones. Average size must have been near 28"". Couple 40"" class, and one far larger.Only one slow fishing day.Saw 2 moose. One a nice bull.I'd suggest allowing more time on the gravel roads, especially Parent to Clova which was not so good. We got a late start, took a wrong turn in Ottawa... Parent to Clova in the dark took considerably over 2 hours.Get gas in Parent. It is available in Clova, but $50 doesn't get much gas at $1.30/L.Truck tire went flat when we were gone. I knew it had a slow leak and took a 12V micro-compressor.They saw it was dead flat and repaired it. 2 plugs. No charge. Can give the guy who did it a tip if we want. We did.Not sure how they did it without setting off the alarm, but the alarm was not tripped.That is good service, IMHO.Olivier and Jean-Lou directly asked questions about improvements, suggestions, etc.I expect any issues of the previous couple years will not be repeated.G-"
1222768,octanehi5,2010-07-27 10:02:00,1104,"All of the lakes up there are very good,it depends on witch outfitter you like. And what you expect to find at the camps, I have found though may yrs. of fishing in northern quebec,that air melancon has by far the best camps that I have come across,there fishing I would place at 3rd best,Caesers has some very nice fishing,I rate at 2nd,there places to stay are not that good,But like someone said your not going to vegas. Air tamarac I rate 2nd in camps ,but by far the best fishing at lac hebert.Lac lacroiux has a good lake to fish,good camps but I an my friends do not like his plane lands on land,and only allow you 60 lbs each. Its hard enough to make the 100lbs on a beaver.I know that caesers has a lac called little bennie (petite lac hebert) thats just off of lac hebert that is very good fishing. Any were you pick you will have a great time they are all very good ways to spend a fishing vacation. remember this quote WORK WAS MADE FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T FISH Ron"

1176152,wyncote fisherman,2010-03-09 13:49:00,2,"This lodge was a true nightmare. Not nearly enough staff or pilots. The main lodge area was just falling apart.The biggist complaint I had was the ""bait and switch"" sales tactics I fell for to sreer me to thier camp. Just one lie after another.At least they can make a go of it selling used cars."
1176364,4Paulie7,2010-03-10 04:14:00,30,"There are plenty of high quality outfitters in Quebec and, considering the current state of the economy, anglers who spend thousands of dollars on dream trips shouldn't have to risk inferior service. Do some research, correspond with reliable references and don't settle for a trip that will sour you on traveling to Canada. I have been traveling to the same camp for 30 years. During that time the ownership has changed but the fishing has actually improved over time. We've experience unbelevable walleye fishing some years and a few bum years. We always return, however, because the accommodations and service are outstanding and despite all the things over which we have no control, the experience has alwys be well worth the substantial annual investment."
1176582,wyncote fisherman,2010-03-10 13:14:00,2,"Yes I was to blame also for not enough in depth research on the dynamics and conditions of this lodge.I have not soured on Quebec though and enjoyed meeting many people from Quebec and Ontario during the time at the main lodge. The fishing at Lak Broussard was good also, just wished Lak Caesar had pike and walleye too !I will be referencing this site in the future for my next trek to Quebec, but it is back to Maine agin this summer for smallies and salmon."
1181716,Guest,2010-03-24 22:17:00,0,went with caesrs twice bad and worse have roughed it in alaska montana canadian rockies so I can handle some problems but no friges spent time fixing motors (lots of time ) asked for price and contract and was still hit with extra charges after we were dropped off paid for beer we never got and the place was a mess from the previuos tennants who were still sleeping there when we arrived stayed with baie du nord las tyear also looked at nemio's facility both awesome would NEVER GO WITH CEASARS AGAIN dont mind rough ing it but tell me the truth and dont hit me with extra charges when i'm already there
1199428,saradog1994,2010-05-11 21:57:00,5,"I found this site by accident and was very surprised to see some of the comments about Caesar's. First let me say I am a customer not an employee or relative, etc. But I made my first trip to Caesars in 1993. I have missed only one year since. This year will be the third year I have made two trips in the same year. I have always found Oliver, George and their families to be curteous and helpful. Other than the first trip in 1993, I have never had a problem with a leaky boat. I have never had a problem with the motors and there has always been a spare at the cabin. When I made my first trip the outpost cabins were very rustic to say the least. They had no running water or toilets. Since then running water and toilets have been installed at every outpost. Several have been completely rebuilt. They fishing has always been good, sometimes spectacular. I have fished at Goiun 1, Goiun 4, Little Goiun (3x), Little Benny (3x) Nancy's Lake (2x) Lake Larouche, Chubb Lake, Bob Lake (3x), Choquette Lake and Lake Caesar. If you want to fish this is the place. If you want plush accomodations fly to Manitoba and pay $5000 to stay in a Lodge where they cook your food, make your bed and wipe your ***. Me I want to catch walleye and pike and drink Canadian beer. So I go to Caesars"
1206757,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-03 19:35:00,151,Does anyone have any experience w/ Caesar's Lodge yet this year? How's the 'new' management? How's the fishing? I used to go there regularly years ago. I hope things are working out better for them and their clients this year.
1206846,teddi,2010-06-04 05:44:00,349,"you have to stay in canada to drink canadian beer. i didn,t think quebec was part of canada."
1206867,bloom08,2010-06-04 07:13:00,13,"I have been to Caesars 6 time. Haven't been there the past two years though because haven't had the money. Last time i was there, George Jr crashed the plane on Bob Lake and we had to pull them from the water. Going back this year though to Bob Lake through Olivier with Caesars North Camps. I havent had any problems with either George Jr, or Olivier, they have treated us great. Fishing has been great at times and ok at times depending on the weather and cold fronts that have come thru. Been to Bob Lake 3 times. Lake Nancy 1, 1# Gouin 1, and Mattawa 1. Dont think they go to Mattawa anymore though, don't see it on the web. Will be going back to Bob Lake this year in July."
1209602,saradog1994,2010-06-12 22:47:00,5,Just got back from a trip to Oliver's Caesars North Camps. The road to Parent and then to Clova is mostly unpaved but very decent. It takes about 3 and a half hours. Did it in a Subaru sedan. No problems. Spent 5 days at Little Gouin just off the main resovoir. Fishing was OK and would have geen excellent if not for 3 very windy days. Newly rebuilt cabin was great. Service good as usual. BGoing back in August.
1134766,Guest,2009-09-09 10:06:00,0,How did everyone's trip turn out this summer. Please let me know how the conditions were.
1134821,Guest,2009-09-09 13:07:00,0,"I been going there for years and my group been well taken care of every year. They do their best to please everyone, but I guess you can't please them all. Planes are late everywhere you go, but no matter where you are you can still fish until they get there. We do some serious moose hunting there and have been very successfull every year. We not that great of fishermen, but even novice fishermen like us can bring home the pictures and look like hero to our friends. Just remenber, your on vacation and doing what you love, be patient and these little things won't matter."
1134830,Guest,2009-09-09 13:47:00,0,"hay tough, could yo e mail me I would like to talk to you about moose hunting at caesars[email protected]"
1134837,Guest,2009-09-09 14:01:00,0,"heatmizer, We have been going to Caesars for a few years now for moose. We will be going again this year. Our lake is approx. 32km (20 miles) from Lawton lake so we would be roughly in the same area. There are moose in this area. I read somewhere that all of Quebec holds about 120,000 moose. We don't use guides so I can't really speak to that subject. As Esox Angler has said, you won't be staying at the Hyatt so don't expect the maid to put a couple of mints on your pillow. It's a fishing/hunting camp in the middle of a wilderness and as Tough said, don't sweat the small stuff and you'll have a good time."

1140741,Backwoods,2009-10-07 17:35:00,1,"Hey EsoxNew today to the board, your post caught my attention. My father and myself are going to Bob lake in may 2010. If you dont mind drop me an e mail and I can ask you a couple questions on the lake. Dont worry I'm not looking for the Ritz, we have been on a bunch of fly in all around ontario and know what to expect.Thanks a million[email protected]"
1152469,Guest,2009-12-06 10:22:00,0,"I too have had a bad experience by Oliver at Caesars. I'll never go back. Been with Air Tamarac for 10 years now and will never use anyone else. Jean does an excellent job. Camps are top notch. And most of all, he treats you right. No lies, no 'sales job', just an honest straight up deal. Kevin"
1163230,Guest,2010-01-25 18:04:00,0,First time long time caller.. Anyone ever fish Lac Gilbert up at Caesars? It's what they call a local fly in.. but I think you may be able to 4x4 in there now.. It may be where they pick you up by seaplane if you can't make it in the last 80k or so.. Any information would be greatly appreciated.. Take care and be safe..
1171877,5 of Diamonds,2010-02-24 21:53:00,151,"I heard today that Oliver is back in the picture and has the $'s to spend getting Caesars back to where it once was. Supposedly, he bought more than half of the camps back. Any one else heard anything about this?"
1172034,NYBowHunter,2010-02-25 12:12:00,35,Yes and there is another brief thread on this as well: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=160432I would really look elsewhere for a good fishing trip if I were you!
1134764,Guest,2009-09-09 10:00:00,0,"I know this is a fishing site, But Im planning a moose hunt to Caesars in 3 weeks and was wondering if i should be afraid of not getting what i was offered. What I want is a good honest moose hunt where the guides work hard to get you a moose. the cabin does not have to be great its hunting and a little fishing. I would like the lights and fridge to work. were looking at lawton lake. any info would be great."
