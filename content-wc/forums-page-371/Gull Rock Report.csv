Some good sized northerns caught also 2-42"" and I believe a 43 was caught also!We had no issue at all gettin our keepers to take home or eat. We did not keep a fish under 17"" for our take home fish. Fishing started out GREAT. Alot of fish caught, most were 14-18"" with your overs. Found them anywhere in water column. Shallow was 2fow clear down to 25fow+.Shiners were up shallow early/middle of week then as Thursday/Friday came along looked like some mayflys were popping up in spots!Will be back in September!"
