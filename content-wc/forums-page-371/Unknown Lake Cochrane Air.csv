We have fished this lake before, but it was years ago... Anyone have any recent updates from this lake?? We are headed out June 22 to June 29 My 12 year old son is going. First year for him... I cannot wait!"
1449064,CSH Kucinski,2012-06-13 21:20:00,1340,"We fished Unknown last year. Water was cool, weather was cool and had rain, fishing was very slow but would expect that you'll do just fine based on the time of year you're going. Caught more Northern than walleye."
1451066,beerman69,2012-06-19 05:53:00,15,"Well, 3 more days and we will be catching walleye and pike at cochrane air.. Unknown Lake it is..... Time sure flies!"
1466012,CSH Kucinski,2012-07-25 08:23:00,1340,"beerman69,How was your trip? I am anxious to hear how you guys did and if anything was said about the plane crash."
1912154,CSH Kucinski,2013-07-01 09:54:00,1340,"Well we just got back from our trip to Air Cochrane and it was the best ever, our 7th year in a row. We fished Floodwood Lake and had a blast. Weather was great but the bugs were terrible, the worse they have ever been. Already booked for next year, same Lake and same time of the year (June 18 - 22)."
1913906,beerman69,2013-07-01 19:40:00,15,Nice! Did you guys rip them up? We are headed to Yesterday Lake next year! Thats our favorite lake!!
1915034,CSH Kucinski,2013-07-02 08:19:00,1340,Yes we did well and on one day it was slow because the weather was so warm and the water was as flat as a table top.
