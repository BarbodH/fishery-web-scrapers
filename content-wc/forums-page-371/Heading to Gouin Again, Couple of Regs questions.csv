1904562,smallcal,2013-06-28 06:10:00,119,"All - First off, thank you all for being so open on how to catch walleye, using the search function I have been able to find lots of great information.I'm headed to the Gouin in two weeks from today!!! Second year for me, the other five in the crew has been going for a long time (Air Melancon/Baie du Nord). Trying to get evertything in order now to pass the time...This year wanted make sure I know the regs rather than rely on someone else (not that it has ever been a problem, just want to be double sure):Reading the QC regulations site, is there a slot size for Gouin Walleye (from what I saw it looked like you can only keep 32-47 cm)?Is it permissable to throw out a couple of leech traps overnight to catch leeches once we are there?Guess those are the main two questions on regs.Other question would be, with all the fish, what are my chances of catching some leeches for fishing? We always take lots of crawlers and lures, just want to introduce another option if possible.Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.Ken"
1904642,Freytown,2013-06-28 06:34:00,770,"Ken, on the Gouin any eyes over 32cm can be harvested. Leeches are OK as bait but I'm not sure if you can catch them...just ask your outfitter.I was checked by the Gouin wardens when I was there in 1st of June, they are patrolling the area frequently. Have a good trip.PS: From the regs: Communal Wildlife Area of Gouin reservoir (Zone 14). You may keep walleye and sauger measuring 32 cm or more. Walleye and sauger may be whole or in fillets of 20 cm or more. The skin must adhere to the fillets over their entire lengthIn zones where bait-fish is permitted, a sportfishing licence holder is allowed to use to capture bait-fish, one dip-net or up to three bait-traps, except in Zone 17 and 22 to 24 where such gear is prohibited for fishing. Bait-traps left unattended must be identified with the name, address and licence number of their owners. When one or more persons fish under the licence of another person, the number of tackle used by the group must not exceed that authorized for the licence-holder. Moreover, leeches, whether dead or alive, are permitted everywhere."

Saw that in the regs but was not sure where the communal area was, turns out there are quite a few of them based on the lat/long's given on the website.Thanks for the heads-up on the enforcement, we keep everything above board. To be honest, we were stopped last year and one of our crew did not have their license in the boat. Since everyone else did and all gave honest answers, we only received a warning. They were very polite and quite helpful.Thanks again."
1905826,Freytown,2013-06-28 12:36:00,770,"Ken, the entire Gouin is in the Communal Wildlife Area. The lat/lon areas in the book are the spawning areas that can't be fished early in the season. Have a great trip."
1906986,mr-fish,2013-06-28 19:15:00,58,My guess is if you have a rental boat that the outfitter will have a ruler chart stuck on the inside of the boat showing size requirments. This is how the chart on our boat with another outfitter read. If it's less than 32cm HAVE to release...32 to 47 KEEPER ...OVER 47 VOLUNTARY RELEASE. We also were also asked to fill out a form on the number and type fish caught.
1911506,smallcal,2013-07-01 06:34:00,119,"Thank you for the information. We generally only catch fish in that range anyway, but wanted to make sure what was legal and not. For the resource, good to release the big ones, though not always the easiest thing to do..."
