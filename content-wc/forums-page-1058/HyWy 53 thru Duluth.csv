509174,Guest,2000-07-19 19:35:00,0,Does anybody know a better way thru or around Duluth other than taking 53? Thanks and Good Luck Fishing.
509175,Pooch,2000-07-19 20:44:00,4619,"53 thru Duluth isn't that bad at all. After crossing the Bay bridge the road splits with 53 going to the left and through what appear to be side streets. Really no big deal. Plus there are plenty of places to make ""pit stops"". Pooch"
509176,Xplorer,2000-07-20 11:11:00,244,"If you are going thru Superior, there is no other/better way. There is currently construction going on thru Duluth, and you may have to detour ( I know semi's are definitly being detoured) so watch for signs. If your coming up I-35, exit at Hwy 33 north in Cloquet and it takes you directly to Hwy 53 North of Duluth. Xplorer"
509177,Karl,2000-07-20 11:39:00,63,It also saves time.
509178,Guest,2000-07-20 12:45:00,0,"HWY 53 North through Duluth is detoured from DT to the top of the hill. This detour is not causing serious delays. Alternative route--If you are coming from Wisconsin take the I 35 north exit at the end of the bridge. Follow i-35 about a mile and exit onto Mesaba Avenue. Follow Mesaba Avenue up the hill to Central Entrance and make a left. Central Entrance will hook up with HWY 53 about 3 miles down the road by the Duluth Mall. All of these roads are four lane and in excellent condition. This route only adds about mile to the trip, but I think the grade up the hill is much better. TGG"
509179,BD,2000-07-20 15:11:00,739,Hwy 53 is a pain! Take Hwy 2 in Superior. You will cross the other bridge into Minnesota. Hwy 2 will take you around the south side of Duluth. It's an easier way through if you're going west or north. If you're going towards Thunder Bay good luck with the construction in Duluth.
