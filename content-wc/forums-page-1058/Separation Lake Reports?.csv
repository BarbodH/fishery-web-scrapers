509008,Odie,2000-07-18 20:07:00,23,"Just returned last Friday from Separation. Stayed at the campgrounds. Hmmmm...where to begin.The laws have changed. You are only allowed two walleyes on the river. 4 on the lake. If you are staying in the camp, Barb will fill you in. Tell her Bob, Kevin, Kurt, John and gang said hi. Fishing was as hard as I've seen it this year. They've had a lot of rain, and water is up 4 1/2 feet. They're were six foot swells at the Kettle. To keep the water going, they had the ##### open at Lac Seul at Ear Falls making sure Lac Seul didn't flood the resorts up there. That kept the water high at Separation. Storm Bay was a bust. Maybe by August they'll have moved in. Water was too fast to fish the river, but we did pick up some in the slower water. Some walleyes were being picked up at Fiord Bay by the falls, but not many.Try Walleye Pass. Actually, go through walleye pass and bear left. We picked some up by the 1st island. Try Moose Narrows and Moose Bay. We hit there right after the mayfly hatch, plus the high water. Made for tough location. They seemed really spotty and found no concentration of walleyes anywhere. It was pick up a couple here, pick up a couple there, move again. And nothing of any size this year. 4# 4 was the largest we could get this year. It should be 4# 5oz by the time you get there. She's still swimming.I'm guessing by the time you get there, the locations may have changed. If the water is down, hit the river. If not, stay on the lake. Best of luck to you. If Gary, (Barbs Uncle) is going out, ask him where they're at. He'll help you out."
509009,Eyesore,2000-07-18 22:09:00,455,"Odie, thanks for all that! I'm glad I have'nt booked yet. Up 4 and half feet? Jeeesiss. What did you mean about 2 walleye ""in the river"" but not in the lake. To me, if you boated 10 miles, you would go through some river, then a lake, then some river, then a lake etc...Only 2 fish? What the...! Oh well, hope you got drunk anyway. ""On land of course"". With water like that, I bet you could just hammer through the rapids,aye? I'm curious, was the campground full? Also, and I know this is a long shot, but would you happen to have barbs phone #? Thanks- 10-4"
509010,Odie,2000-07-20 17:20:00,23,"Eyesore, The number for Separation is (807) 224-4537. Not sure if this reaches the cabins or the campsite. The campsite wasn't full. In fact there were only two parties, which included us. The rapids was a nit wild. Yeehaw! We didn't even try to get through the lower Kettles, although the MNR went through. They started to go through, came back out, put on their life vests, and then went through. Tell you anything? It was rolling!The new law this year......East of Separation Bridge, (the river), you are allowed a limit of two walleyes. This includes what is at camp in the freezer and out on the water. West of the bridge, (the lake) you are allowed 4 walleyes. But the total possession limit is 4 each. If you have two from the river, you can have two from the lake. Or non from the river and four from the lake. And camp rules, (Jim) does not allow anything over 18 inches this year in possession.Keep your eye out on Lac Seul water levels. If Lac Seul is ok, they'll shut the dam, and this will lower the water at Separation. It did come down about 4 to 6 inches while we were there.Good luck if you're heading up there.Odie"
509011,Guest,2000-07-20 19:32:00,0,Odie what are the regulations for smallmouth at this time
509013,Eyesore,2000-07-21 13:58:00,455,"Odie, thanks for the comeback. 10-4"
509012,Odie,2000-07-21 18:35:00,23,Spincast.....This is a camp rule set by Jim.....No Smallies. Catch and Release only.
509014,Larry,2000-07-24 09:33:00,357,"So let me get this straight..... Only 2 walleye in the River.. or... 4 from the lake... no walleye over 18"" and catch and release smallmouth only? Why don't they make it a catch and release only and save a lot of confusion! Sure hope the fishing is good, sounds like a lot of rules to me!Larry"
509015,Ray,2000-07-24 09:37:00,96,Is there any new reports on Separation Lake. Heading up in two weeks and would appreciate any info.
509016,Eyesore,2000-07-24 16:26:00,455,"Larry, the part about no walleye over 18 inches is a rule that the lodge owner made. Of course the lodge owner does'nt own the water, It is just his policy. The MNR says it is legal to keep one fish over 18 inches. Both the owner and the MNR have great policy's/laws, but yeah, in the near future you will need a better recource than walleye central to interpret the laws. Mabie a lawer?"
508998,deehawk,2000-07-11 21:02:00,178,Heading there in August and wondered how the fishing has been. Thanks!Brian
508999,Eyesore,2000-07-13 00:00:00,455,"I am assuming you would like a recent report. If its your first time up, and want to know how the fishing has been historicaly, let me know. In a nutshell, it is superb! I have'nt been there this year though. Are you staying at the campground or the lodge?"
509000,deehawk,2000-07-13 06:19:00,178,"Eyesore, thanks for the response. We were there for the first time last year in late August. It was in the 90s all four days we were there. We stayed at the campgorunds. Because of the heat fishing was tougher than normal according to the ""veterans"". We spent two days learning the system. Caught most of our fish in the river. In fact, he last day we caught most of the fish on the trip right in the rapids by the campground. I would be interested where you have your best fishing success and what tactics you use. I can use all the help I can get! If you get a chance sometime drop me an email. [email protected] Thanks!Brian"
509002,Eyesore,2000-07-14 00:30:00,455,"Deehawk, I can't really help you on 90 degree heat august walleye patterning. Last time I was there it was mid june of '99. We had success catching eye's most everywhere but especialy in storm bay, along the steep rock wall to the left, after you enter. Another prime spot for us was the narrows between Fiord Bay, and the waterfall. Again, this was mid june. I can't help you with debths as my new GARMIN locater craped out on the 2'nd day I was there. Amazingly, I did not hit one single rock! The map they sell is a must! 10 or 11 bucks I think, and it's laminated. By the way, all I did was unhook pike, constantly. Post a report when you get back. I'm thinking of going up late august or late sept. By the way, we stayed at the campground also. Good fishing! 10-4!"
509001,Guest,2000-07-14 18:16:00,0,Hi Brian Tried to e-mail you but it wouldn't go through.Drop me a e-mail.Were heading up august 14.Nick
509003,deehawk,2000-07-15 04:55:00,178,"Eyesore, thanks for the info! Gives us some more spots to check out. Will post a report for you on August 24th. Hoping we don't hit the same kind of heat and calm water we had last year!Brian"
509004,Guest,2000-07-15 08:30:00,0,I'm going to the campground the week of August 5-12 and was also looking for any reports and any pointers. I will give a report when we get back. This is our first trip to this lake
509005,deehawk,2000-07-16 09:43:00,178,Will look for your report Spincast. Good luck. You will like it. Great country!Brian

509007,Guest,2000-07-17 21:51:00,0,"Whoever you are, please don't use my name. People will get confused. As far as whitefish in Wawa, I can't help you, as I've never been in that area."
