509161,Guest,2000-07-19 06:27:00,0,"Just got back from the best fishing trip I have ever had. I fished out of Sioux Narows from July 1st through July 14th. We caught more fish than we could count. 60 or more walleye each trip out, A.M. and or P.M. Most of the fish were on the small side, no trouble finding slot fish for shore lunch, but we did manage to find a few larger ones. This was my first trip to LOTW, you can be sure I will be back. A oldtimer up there told me that it was the best walleye fishing he has seen in 28 years! Most fish were taken on live bait/Lindy rigs that we tied with coloured hooks and tipped with a leech. We primarily fished off of the west end of Chisolm Is in 20'-35',m usually at 24', and smoked 'em. This was my first trip where we could go out for a few hours and have boat totals of over 100 fish caught for two or three guys, incredible! We caught fish in other areas as well, some farther out like Mousse Is(HOT), and some closer like in Whitfish Narrows. The run from Sioux Narrows to Chisolm, going about 30mph, blew my prop up, took us about 30-35 min. If anyone is interested in any of the other fishing areas, just let me know.Hodge"
509162,Tom,2000-07-21 06:31:00,1063,I think this has been a normal summer fishing here on LOTW. I have spent the whole summer here for 15 years and it is a typical year. Other years you have to look for them but they are there. You have been fishing deep I have been fishing shallow...2 ft. To much work to bring them out of 30'Warden's check you for having shore lunch and than catching more?How about if they drop the limit to 1 next year. Darned near went through this year.. They did it on Rainy.Adios from Whitefish Bay
