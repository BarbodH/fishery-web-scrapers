509117,miksup,2000-07-18 07:07:00,297,What's the price range of fuel these days in and around the Fort Frances area? Coming up in 2 weeks and would rather buy the non-alcohol gas in Canada even if it costs a little more. Please specify if in US or Canadian dollars. Thanks in advance guys. Mike.
509118,Hunter,2000-07-18 07:12:00,346,"I was up there the last week of June and Priceswere about .74 to .78 cents per liter canadian.After converting to gallons and US, it is stillmore expensive."
509119,Guest,2000-07-18 11:12:00,0,"BUT, DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE EXCHANGE RATE!!!!!!!!!!"
509120,Hunter,2000-07-18 11:26:00,346,After the exchange rate it is still about 10 cents more expensive per US gallon.
509121,miksup,2000-07-18 19:34:00,297,"Thanks to all who replied. The way I figure, 75 cents Canadian a liter comes to about $1.60 an American gallon in US dollars. I burn nothing but non-oxy gas in my Optimax and I have to buy 91 octane to get it for about the same price. Would rather pay $1.60 for non-oxy Canadian gas that's 87-88 octane. Looks like a wash to me so again, thanks for the input guys. Mike."
509122,Guest,2000-07-19 08:04:00,0,"Just got back and paid anywhere from 75 cents to 82 Canadian cents per liter - and more for Premium where they had it.80 Canadian cents per liter is about US$2/gallon. The conversion is pretty easy - just take the Canadian price per liter and multiply it by 2-1/2 (2.5).Also, use your credit card to get the best exchange rates. If you pay Uhmurrican dollars they'll usually take it but give you a godawful exchange rate."
509123,docIN,2000-07-19 08:37:00,120,Becareful using that plastic. Alot of times the Canadian retailer with tack on another 2-5 percent to the purchase for using that good'ole visa/mc.
509124,Karl,2000-07-19 13:01:00,63,"It's your bank tacking on the extra fee, not the retailer. There was a segment on the news recently. Some banks do that whenever you use the card out-of-country."
509125,docIN,2000-07-19 14:53:00,120,"Last year I purchased gas in Canada and when I went to go pay, the lady tacked on 5 percent to the purchase for using visa. She called it a processing/handling fee.No matter, my point is, sometimes there are hidden charges and visa might not always be the best way to go. I think I might have a good solution this year though. I went to my AAA and purchased Canadian travelers checks at the current rate without any fees. I hope it all works out."
509126,Guest,2000-07-20 10:00:00,0,whats the rule on bringing gas into Canada?Can I bring in extra gas tanks duty free?
