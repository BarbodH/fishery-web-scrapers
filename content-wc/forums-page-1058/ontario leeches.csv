509184,srj,2000-07-20 12:08:00,971,are there any decent sized leeches to be had in Fort Francis or Nestor Falls? Last year they were all small (but lively).

I payed $30/lb at Nestor Falls Pro Fishing, the last fishing store on the right as you leave N.F. heading to Sioux Narrows. I found the cheapest leeches were $22/lb at Pinacle Sports in Sioux Narrows, same size and count. Everyone else seemed to be in between with there pricing.Hodge"
