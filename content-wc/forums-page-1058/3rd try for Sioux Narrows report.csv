I'm heading to Sioux Narrows with my wife and daugther on thursday.I'm hoping to get some advice on where to fish for walleye,smallies,northern and maybe muskies.I fished sioux narrows last year during the last week of july and it was tough. The only fish that cooperated were the northerns. We fished all the way out to Yellow Girl and a little bit past the happy face. I talked to some guides and resort owners at the All Canada Show this past winter and they said it was tough all last summer out of Sioux Narrows.They said everything that could hatch did hatch and there was to much feed in the water. Was wondering if anyone else had the same experience? So if the server is working I'd sure appreciate a report. We're camping out of LOTW houseboats. I'll post a report on my return. Thanks Bob"
