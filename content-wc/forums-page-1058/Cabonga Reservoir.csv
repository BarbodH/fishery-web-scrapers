508960,Guest,2000-07-06 11:06:00,0,Looking for some information on the Cabonga Reservoir in the La Verendrye Wildlife Reserve. I'm planning a trip and would like to know where you've stayed and how the fishing was.thanks in advance for any posts!Louiethelooper
508961,Guest,2000-07-11 16:25:00,0,Fished there 5 years ago and had a hard time finding big fish. Biggest pike was 10 #'s. Biggest eye was 6.25 #'s. I fish the Gouin Res. in Quebec and find big fish with no problem. Pike to 26 #'s and eyes to 11 #'s. Been going there for years and would fish there instead of Cabonga. Stay at a place called Barrage Gouin. Find them at... www.barragegouin.qc.ca.....A friend just came back from there and caught pike to 18 #'s in the last week of June. I usually go Memorial week. Have fun and enjoy the trip. Hope this helps a little. JJ

Over the years the fishing has degraded, in my opinion, due to the low water levels over the past 4 years during the summer. The problem with low water is that it concentrates the bait fish and the game fish usually have a feast. Biggest Pike have been in the 10 to 12 # range and Walleye, 4 #s.Cabonga is starting to get expensive because you also have to pay the stupid park fee at $10 per person, per day (atleast that's what it was last year).Mark"
