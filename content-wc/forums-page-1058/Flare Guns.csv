509213,Guest,2000-07-23 15:05:00,0,Is it legal to take a flare gun into Canada from the U.S.? My friends dad has one and we're wondering if we want to take it along. Thanks! Fred
509214,Guest,2000-07-23 18:10:00,0,The of ohio has put out warning against it. In Canada flar guns are classified as hand gun. If you are seen with one you would be arrested. for carring a hand gun. I think ohio publist this in the fishing laws or the boating reg.
509215,Guest,2000-07-24 09:28:00,0,You can go to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources site and look for your answer. If you can't find it - click on Fishing Questions and send them an Email. Their site is at #####://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing Good Luck...RocFish
509216,RANGER,2000-07-24 11:07:00,4341,I learned earlier this Spring that they ARE legal. It was posted on this Board by someone who lives in Ontario. The gentleman had said that they (the flare guns) are sold in Ontario stores. I went up this past June and saw them in Barrie stores. I had mine in my boat while I was there.For what it is worth.RANGER
509217,Frank from TBay,2000-07-24 17:38:00,312,"Ranger: Flare guns that fire flares only are legal. The plastic guns that fire the 12 ga flares are very common and can be bought anywhere. If you have a flare gun that can fire other rounds other than flares or a modified metal gun, they are against the law. Good fishing: Frank"
509218,RANGER,2000-07-25 06:44:00,4341,"Frank,Thanks. I did have that understanding, my gun is strickly a flare gun made by ORION.I was happy to find this out before I went to Canada this past June. I personally think that a flare gun is far more effective in getting attention than any amount of handheld flares. Besides, every time I cross into Canada (at the Peace or Rainbow bridges) I get reminded of Canadas' gun laws by Customs because I have NRA window stickers. I don't need to have them tear my truck or boat apart. The flare gun is in the passenger compartment of the SUV, should they ask.RANGER""KEEP YOUR LINES WET, YOUR POWDER DRY and THE BEER COLD""!"
