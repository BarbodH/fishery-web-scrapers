509136,Guest,2000-07-20 09:08:00,0,"The daytime walleye bite was tough because of the clear water and bright days we had. We did manage a few big fish during the day in 30-40 feet of water on jigs with a twister and a leech or crawler. We had much better luck in the evening. We usually started in about 25 feet of water and slowly moved up until we found the fish. It varied each nite but we did find them as shallow as 8 feet using live bait rigs with about 2-3 foot snells and a plain hook or floating jig. The walleye averaged about 22 inches, we actually had trouble finding the 'eaters'. The best spot was below the second rapids (but you can't keep the fish there) (we also caught bonus smallmouth up to 4lbs in the same spot). We also had some good luck on Squaw lake. We eventually found smaller fish during the day in shallow water, from 12 feet right up to shore where there was a good mix of boulders and cabbage (the northwest shore of the lake).If your considering a guide or renting a boat let me know. I have some more information to share about that....good luck"

Third Labyrinth has some good spots on the south shore 2/3 of the way back. We got into a mess of crappie back there one year and had a blast! If your into sightseeing go to the back (East) end of First Labyrinth and see the waterfall comming out of Fox Lake. Fox lake has some decent northerns in it.For Lake trout try Cul de Sac Lake For Muskies try Shoal Lake Narrows"
