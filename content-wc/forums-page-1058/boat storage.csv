Unfortunately, my garage is not large enough to accomodate the ~20 feet total length of the boat and trailer and I will need to store it outside in the summer and possibly the winter. Does anybody do this for their boats? Any problems with engines getting stolen? Winter damage (if stored outdoors)?Thanks,Truong"

508976,Guest,2000-07-19 21:42:00,0,"Your motor will be okay as long as you follow the manual's instructions for winterizing plus any helpful advice from fellow boaters. I don't know where you live but if you know somebody that has a barn, tarp the boat and park it. Keep looking and keep asking questions."

508978,Guest,2000-07-21 09:09:00,0,"Shame on you!!!! Its way to early to be thinking about storage, a lot of guys are just getting their rigs on the water. But seriously, I store my boat outside all winter with a 15 dollar tarp with no problem, just every once in awhile I brush the snow off. The main thing is to have a reputable marine/mechanic WINTERIZE it properly to get all the water out, so it does not freeze. As long as you winterize it properly, it can sit outside in Anartica. Good Luck"
508979,Guest,2000-07-21 11:23:00,0,"I concure..mine out all winter also.Aslong as properly winterized and covered. Some people have them ""shrink wrapped"" for storage but I have heard that is not so good because of condensation in the interior,so you should probably not consider that.As far as theft,no one could predict.Make sure you are insured. Have fun with your new boat!"
508980,Guest,2000-07-21 12:16:00,0,You may want to consider another boat rather than a tracker - that's the real issue here dude
