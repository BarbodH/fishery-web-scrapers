509180,Guest,2000-07-19 20:50:00,0,I am wanting to try replacing the treble hooks on some of my crankbaits with single hooks before heading north end of August. Anyone have some advice of size and style of hook to use and any experiences/tips on doing this?Use a lot of Mann's Stretch 20s and Thundersticks. Thanks.Mike
509181,Guest,2000-07-21 08:03:00,0,"My boat partner experimented with this last year. He did it to his pike spoons to help keep them weedless and to ease release. The verdict...more than twice as many missed hookups for him. There is just too much opportunity for the hook to slide through the mouth parallel to the jawbone and not hook up. He even tried two single point hooks on the same spoon...each facing the opposite direction. Didn't matter.Much better to mash down the barbs. I did this and missed 4 out of 20 pike, that could happen even on barbed hooks. Now body baits might be a different story. I would make sure that the point of the hook, when hanging free, is wider than the body of the bait though.Hope this helps..."

This really hasn't effected my hook up's. If my lure has 2 trebles I'll cut the belly one first and if I'm hanging up on the back treble I'll cut that one too. I have noticed that silver hooks preform better for me vs bronze hooks. Noticed this on lures that I had to replace a treble due to damage from pike, the pike would be hooked on the silver treble and not the bronze. Have used single hook lures and have missed plenty of fish to the point that I've put on a trailer the reduce the misses.Your choice..."
