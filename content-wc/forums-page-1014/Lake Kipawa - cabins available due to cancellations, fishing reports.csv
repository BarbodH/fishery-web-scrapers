As far a four seasons which is Georges son in law and the other they should be well run if George had an influence. Also if you have been there you have had the privelige of meeting Big Mike in Laniel. Great motel, , just keep out the Black Flys. How has your fishing been the last few years. Major areas we fish from smith Bay are, Smith Bay ,Moose and Billy Bar. Good fishing Atlanta Dave <"")))))><"
513084,Guest,2001-06-07 03:17:00,0,"I'm not going to get too commercial here, but I was speaking with the owners of the highly-rated camp we stay at on Lake Kipawa and they mentioned that they have had a very high rate of no-shows and cancellations. This comes after an exceptionally godd show circuit booking rate where the cabins were getting filled earlier than usual. Not sure if it's gas prices, the economy, or both, but the bottom line is there are a number of openings in June and July now. If any of you were among the dozens of groups trying to book a week and couldn't, email me and I can hook you up with them.Early fishing reports indicate the cooler weather has indeed prolonged spring a little, with the June feeding frenzy just getting underway. Last four evenings worth of jigging on points in shallow bays have seen catches of 26, 41, 28, and 42 fish among two people. This is great for our group since we will be there in a couple weeks and we will probably be able to take advantage of the delayed warm weather!The original Kip"
513085,Guest,2001-06-07 06:31:00,0,"Mike, is that you?That's good news on the walleye front. I officially leave for Lake Kipawa in approximately 24 hours and will arrive on Saturday. I can't wait and anticipate good fishing. I've often heard there is a ""peak"" feeding frenzy for walleye about this time of year and it may appear that we may hit it. I hope so.Send me an email if you get a chance to confirm your parent's success and techniques / locations to date. Thanks. T. Ross"

513087,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-08 10:30:00,323,What camp on lake Kip I have fished there for years but have not been up this year.
513088,Guest,2001-06-09 07:31:00,0,"What is the best, most comfortable camp on the lake? Also, do you guys think the south end is better or the north end? I might take a trip up there and any info would be appreciated."
513089,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-09 12:33:00,323,All the years I have fished Kip we have stayed at smith bay lodge. George Trudel Owns the camp and does a wonderfull job. Cabins and all equipment are always in top notch condition..You would be hard pressed to find a nicer camp on the lake. George can be contacted at 819-627-9858.
513091,GP-NJ,2001-06-09 15:05:00,156,"The camp Kip#1 was referring to is Taggart Bay Camps. I fished with his parents there 5/26-6/02 this year. They have fished this lake for decades and I know first hand, they will help you with locating the bite and fishing patterns. Hope this helps. The web address for camp is:http://www.taggartbay.com/"
513092,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-10 18:31:00,323,"TAggert Bay is where we get picked up for the Boat ride to Smith Bay about 15 mins. This puts you on the north end of the lake not a lot of boat traffic most time only your group.Last year one of our group had an 11 lber . Beautiful walleye biggest our group has had out of Kip. Good Fishing Atlanta Dave <"")))))))><"
513093,Guest,2001-06-11 04:11:00,0,"Boy - I hadn't checked this thread in a few days and look what I missed...Best and most comfortable might mean different things to different people. Camp upkeep - solid cabins, solid boats/motors, etc. is usually very important. As you know, camp owners seem to fall into 2 groups - those that take care of stuff and those that don't. Most take good care of their stuff - but I can think of a couple exceptions.Some folks like to have meals provided for them and some don't. Some camps offer this service. Our group is always on the lake so we don't look for that kind of comfort. Taggart Bay Lodge does offer meals and they have a nice big dining hall.Re. north vs. south, I haven't spent much time in the southern end so I'm a lousy judge of that. In the '70s we used to ride a boat from the town of Kipawa all the way up the bloomin' lake (3 hours+) to get to the north/northwestern end of the lake. Now, a short dirt road ride in from Laniel is all it takes. I do know that the lake has a different look and feel to it as you travel to different corners - some of you know what I mean. Even the very northern end around Chemagan Bay has a different feel to it than the Taggart Bay and Loon Bay area. Very big lake, lotsa fun to explore. The southern end, being closer to the town of Kipawa, is older and more established. I prefer the more tranquil northern end."
513090,Guest,2001-06-11 04:27:00,0,"Smith Bay Lodge def'ly falls into the category of well-run camp/lodge. I have never stayed there but have fished nearby and did a brief walk-around one time years ago. The way George's boats just purr as they transport customers to and fro says a lot.Three Seasons Camp is also nice - they have a good repeat business. Jerry, who runs the place, is the older brother of Yves Bouthillette who runs Taggart Bay Lodge. Oops, I better mention they co-run their camps along with their wives - or Lise may set me straight!I've heard people say good things about Corbeau Lodge as well - they are more in the middle of the lake - maybe closer to the town of Kipawa than the middle. I've never been there - long ride! There are alot of absolutely decent camps on the lake."
