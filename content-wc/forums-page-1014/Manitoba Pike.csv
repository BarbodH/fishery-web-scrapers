We quit in about '87 because the one lodge on the lake went strictly to American Plan (it's just not our style)."
513158,Guest,2001-06-12 18:00:00,0,"All the lodges cater to the Americans here in Manitoba thats where the money is.Its to bad.As for Cormorant lake for Walleye's i heard it was good.Recently i don't know.I imagine it still is good as there is not alot of fishing pressure.Will fish it one day.My partner used to and he always did well.If your into big walleye's give Tramping a try,its close to Snow lake.I will be going back there this summer.FISH ON."
