513119,Guest,2001-06-08 10:20:00,0,"Just got back, worst I've ever seen. Fishing was getting worse each day as the hatch got bigger. Will probably peek in about two weeks, I'd say by July fishing should be back to normal. Black flies and mosquitos were almost as bad, I'd think about goin' south instead. Maybe bass in Georgia, or tarpon in florida."
513120,Guest,2001-06-10 12:27:00,0,thanks eyecatcher--you are real tool. my friends just got back from there--thye had no flies--appreciate you trying to ##### up my trip for us---what a great guy you are---screwing with another man's fishin. we do not need people like you on this board.
513121,Beaver,2001-06-12 16:40:00,65,"Dude,Relax... even if there are one million flies, your still gonna go, have a good time, and catch fish. What if its cold? what if it rains? what if a bear sh*ts in the cabin? Just go with the flow, and carry paper towels...."
513122,Guest,2001-06-12 16:49:00,0,If you had friends going up why did you ask?
513123,Guest,2001-06-13 03:35:00,0,"I must admit that my goal was simple, to waste your (Mr. Fly Guy) time as you had wasted mine. When you first posted this silly question and did not get a reply I kind of figured you'd figure out the general consensus on this matter. But you did not, instead posting ""look at this Post"" implying some form of emergency. Perhaps I should ask a much more basic question: what does it matter about the flies? Would you cancel your trip? Would you change your destination? Now if you answered ""yes"" to either of those than possibly that information should have been included in your original post. Because when you omit crucial details it appears as if you are asking a quaetion with the same relevance as ""will it be cold"", ""will the wind blow"", ""are there alot of mosquitos"", etc. This ain't rocket science or brain surgery (thankfully I might add)."
513124,Guest,2001-06-13 03:49:00,0,"To all others, sorry for wasting YOUR time, but I just couldn't resist a story about flies."
513125,Kaz,2001-06-13 12:51:00,643,"I too was up last week and the bugs were very bad. Plus the Army worms have been stripping the trees from about Red Lake to the Canadian border and up. At the Northwest Angle the bugs were so bad my antenna turned black from running into them. Fishing was OK, but with all the little critters, we headed back to the south end of the lake. Most of the guides were not willing to go past Garden Island. I noticed above the trees up there, it looked like smoke rising, but it was masses of bugs sworming. It should clear up in about two to three weeks though. The river is up about 3' and rising as the dam in International Falls is being released to stop flooding at the paper mill. Whole trees and a lot of dead heads are comming down the Rainy River, watch out for them they raise ##### with the boat and prop. Good luck FISHING.....Kaz"
