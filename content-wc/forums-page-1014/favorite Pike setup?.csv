513159,Guest,2001-06-10 19:58:00,0,What are your favorite pike set ups for going to canada. Bass tackle? musky tackle? Best line?Thanks for any info.
513160,Guest,2001-06-11 04:37:00,0,"Seems every lake has a different hot set-up. If you have both musky and bass outfits you could bring both, but lean toward the musky stuff if you have limited space. On lake Kipawa in Quebec I use long-handled spinning and casting outfits spooled with Fireline or Spider Fusion (mostly to uproot sunken trees!). The rods are medium heavy and the lines are in that +/- 20 lb. category. I like longer rods - nothing under 6-1/2' for this duty. We throw a lot of big spinnerbaits - yellow/chart. - but we also throw/troll Magnum Rapalas in silver/chart. back. Spoons have their place as well, especially in less-travelled back lakes."
513162,Fred_G,2001-06-11 10:45:00,908,"For rod/reel I like a 6 1/2 - 7 foot med heavy casting rod with a low profile reel with 30 lbs superline.In spoons, I've had great success with the Willaims Wabler, hammered gold/silver in lg and xl. These are a Canadian bait and are available at Cabela's. They also catch a lot of big Walleyes. Eppingers 5 of Diamonds in yellow/red or lime/chartreuse is also excellent.My other favorite is a bass style buzz bait. Sometimes the hit is very soft and you just see the bait go under the surface, but most times they absolutely hammer it. Makes your heart jump. You might only get to use the bait for one fish, but the hit is worth it.Fred"
513163,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-11 11:01:00,323,"Ed My favorite pike rod is a med weight 6 1/2 'spinning rod coupled with a 2000 shamano reel spooled with 12lb test. I will also step up to a baitcaster with 14lb for some lures. I use 1 oz daredevil clickers or some 1 1/4 oz spoons I purchased from Cabelas which I redo with Witch crafters Tape. We fish far north alberta and fight some huge pike many in the highteens and twentys and very few fish are ever lost if any. I feel using heavy rods takes the fight out of the 10 pounders and such to be ready for the one huge fish which can be landed on lighter tackle if cAre is taken The reply post recomending spinner baits is a good one . One member of our group swears by them.. Best to buy titanium which will last through many fish. I leave on thurs for my Pike haven I wish you luck on your trip. Atlanta Dave <"")))))))))><dave"

513166,Guest,2001-06-11 12:30:00,0,"Like most others I like a 6 1/2 foot or 7 foot medium heavy bait caster. I use the 5500/5600 series Ambasadeurs (5500Cs/ProMax/Morrum etc.) and have recently moved to Berkeley Whiplash line. I usually throw 1 oz sliver minnows, larger spinner baits (3/4 to 1 oz) and find the heavier super lines are more durable with the heavier lures. The best lure by far when we were up last week was the larger Husky Jerk in silver or gold. Good Luck."
513167,Atlanta Dave,2001-06-11 14:23:00,323,"Ed Sorry my last post went in 3 times I didn't think it had worked. The other lure to use on lighter tackle is the 5/8 oz vibrax spinner in the fire tiger pattern. We used it at Great Slave lake and at Monroe lake in northern Manitoba and had super success. The ones with none of the hair on them were the best for us. Please give some of these smaller baits a chance as we have caught many great sized Pike with them. Tight lines.

513161,Guest,2001-06-11 17:53:00,0,Kip #! How big a pike are you catching on Kip?Our best was about 15 lbs this year. Last year my son got a 12 + pike in moose and I Know it was the biggest we had caught in almost 20 years. If you guys are doing better we would love to Know. E mail me at [email protected] If you ae catching more. Atlanta Dave <%)))))))))><
513168,Guest,2001-06-13 08:32:00,0,"Like the others, I prefer the longer, fast acion, heavy duty rod for pike. My reel of choice is the Ambassadeur 6500C4 with the 6.3 : 1 gear ratio. In July the pike prefer the faster, erratic retrieves. 20 lb. test Trilene XL is my personal preference for line. Lure #1 is the 3/4 oz Johnson Silver Minnow, dressed with an Uncle Josh Bass Strip. Pitch it to the shore, into fallen timber and into weed beds. Retrieve with a stop and go motion. Be sure to have a hook remover handy. Next, try a 4 1/2"" Husky Jerk, gold or Blue/Silver on deep water points, rockpiles, sunken islands or trolled. The same stop & go motion works great. Another presentation technique is to pitch a Bomber or Thunderstick into likely spots, let it sit and then work it back like a surface lure, letting it sit motionless for long durations between jerks. Other, noisy surface presentations are also worth a try. Two other presentations I like to experiment with are big spinnerbaits and big jigs dressed with plastic or pork. I've caught pike on all of them and my best advice is to use the system that you're most comfortable with. Use it a lot and you'll get real good at it and, as a result, you'll have some great pictures to show the guys back at the office."
