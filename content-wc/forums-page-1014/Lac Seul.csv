Caught all the Northern we wanted to while fishing for wallies. Our best bet was a jig and either minnow or twister tail in bright colors. The water is high but the fishing is great. Not sure where in the NW portion you are going, but should be good. Probably us a different tactic in July, maybe leeches and crawler rigs.eyesnatcher"
