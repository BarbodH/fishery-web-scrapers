513220,Guest,2001-06-13 02:23:00,0,Tomorrow I leave for Nestor Falls. There was a post about bait shops after crossing the border which I can't seem to find. It seems there was mention about a shop by the Canadian Tire Store? Any info would be appreciated. Thanks

513222,Guest,2001-06-13 09:51:00,0,"If you're not looking for live bait. There are also a couple of good bait shops in Int'l Falls. I just broused them on my way back from Dogtooth lake- Prices varied but seemed to be less than Gander Mountain. One is behind a gas station on the left ""Outdoors Sports"" or someting like that, the other is just up the road toward the border also on the left side as you're headed to the border- Tackle on the Canadian side can be pricey. Most resort's have minnows, leeches and crawlers.Catch'em & Let'em Go!Have fun ;-)><))))*>"
