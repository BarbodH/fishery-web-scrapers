513081,JN,2001-06-06 20:28:00,47,Been there 4 times my dad's been there 15 the fishing is good we were after Eyes but always hooked several good pike 12 to 15 lbs. But if I were going after big pike I'd head up past Lynn Lake. And if you want a resonable lodge I'd sugest Wolverine went there for my honeymoon last year out of 20 people 33 master angler pike were caught and relesed!
513082,Guest,2001-06-09 07:41:00,0,I dont know about reed lake but ghost river lodge is the place to go for pike. I was there a couple weeks ago and caught hundreds of pike. There are some walleye in there to. Very easy to catch supper. My biggest eye was 25 inches. If you like toallmouth theres some in there. The biggest smallmouth was 19 inches. There were 5 or 6 pike in our group over 35 inches. Its by far the best place i've been to yet.
513083,Guest,2001-06-11 10:33:00,0,"Just got back from Reed. We fish Ontario alot and catch lots of pike. This was our first time up there. As the above says the Trout fishing was good lots of ten to fifteen pound fish. As for the Northerns I would not go back to the lake. We caught enough fish, but was not much better than where we fish in Ontario which is only a 7 hour drive. It is 16 hours to Reed from the Twin Cities. The average Pike was about 29 inches or 8 pounds. Nearly every fish is between 28 inches and 33 inches that we caught. We tried everything, bays rocky points, jigging deep water, troling and on and on. The biggest we caught was 39 inches. Not a bad fish but not to great for 7 days of fishing. Everybody up there seemed to think that this was a good bite for this lake and I was not impressed. Now lake trout is another story. This is the best Lake Trout fishing I have ever seen. When I was looking for a good Pike lake it was tough to find any information. The eye fishing was also slow when we were up there although we did not fish for them much. We still managed to land a 29.5 incher. Any other questions about the lake or Campground or Lodges in the area, or if you find any really good pike lakes email me at [email protected]."
