512991,Darrll T. Milender,2001-06-09 17:18:00,9,Thanks for your report.I'll try it and let you know. Have you tried brook trout fishing there and if so how did you do?
512992,Guest,2001-06-10 16:42:00,0,"Have only tried for lakers as we go in July . Have had good luck for lake trout , last years largest was just short of 37# .Fish is now being mounted of course . If you want to book accomodations at Pasha Lake you need to do so early as they are busy and fill up early in the year . One of the guys I work with is there now for brookies on the northern end of the lake ."
512993,Darrll T. Milender,2001-06-10 17:13:00,9,I was wondering if there are any motels in the Nipigon or jellico area and would they be pretty well filled up?
512994,Guest,2001-06-11 14:43:00,0,The town of Nipigon has several but I'm sorry I don't remember any of their names . Also there are a couple in Beardmore .
