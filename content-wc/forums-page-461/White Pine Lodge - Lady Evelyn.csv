1355930,villain189,2011-10-07 08:51:00,33,Anyone been here or have any feedback?Sounds like it's actually on the montreal river right near the dam and you would have to drive your boat a ways to get into Evelyn?On their website they say it's only a 1 minute boat ride to White Pine from the dam.
1355956,micropterus,2011-10-07 09:53:00,450,It is on the river below the water retaining structure or ****. You cannot drive your boat to Lady E. It's a boat haul.
1355958,villain189,2011-10-07 10:02:00,33,"Ahhh..thanks for the info. We'll scratch that from our list then. Do you know anything about the current shape of either of these two housekeeping camps on Evelyn? Found them listed on the Tri-Town chamber pdf. -Lady Evelyn Camp -Offers 9 cottages on Lady Evelyn Lake, access by boat or plane- Mitchell's Lady Evelyn CampWe used to go to Mitchell's about 25 years ago...at that time no running water and just a generator that kicked on from dusk till about 10pm for lights."

If I recall correctly, still looked like it was operating a couple of years ago when I boated passed it.I also believe you can pay $10 to have your/a boat trailered up to Evelyn from the Montreal river. I remember asking the owner of White Pine a while back at a sports show, because I wondered the same thing as you did. The dam is next to White pine, so it is probably about a 1 minute boat ride to the docking area below the dam like they sayI don't own a boat, so don't know how much effort it would be to trailer your boat and get it hauled up to the top of the dam (about a 2 minute walk up a hill) and relaunch into Evelyn. Doesn't seem too bad to me, but I rarely saw anyone on that lake that wasn't from the lodges if that means anything.Anyway, White Pine looked like a decent place to me. Looked relatively busy as well. Considered staying there a couple of times, but just never worked out."
1356122,FrankLeigh,2011-10-07 20:54:00,80,"Stayed at White Pine 5 years ago. We fished the river above and below the camp for a few miles and found a few fish but they were very deep,50 ft or more (early Sept). We only went up to Lady Evelyn one day. You just drive your boat on to the guy's trailer and he hauls you up to the top of the dam.Our cabin was more like a lodge, beautiful old timber place with a big fireplace, big screened porch, 4 bedrooms. Nice people."
