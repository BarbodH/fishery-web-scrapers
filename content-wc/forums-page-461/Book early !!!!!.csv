1355806,Jiggy06,2011-10-06 18:17:00,7,"Just made our yearly deposite at Cobham River Lodge in Manitoba, Another great year of fishing to look forward to. This year they even gave us 10% off our normal rate for booking before November 30th. Didnt expect to hear that in the coversation! Can't wait!!!Jiggy"
1356044,GWC,2011-10-07 14:06:00,1021,We have had our reservations since June for 2012. We'll be at Poplar Point Resort in early June for a week. Too bad we can't stay longer.
1356354,Seanik,2011-10-09 08:25:00,218,"We are booked July 14-21 at Lake Nagagami a fly in out of Hornepayne, Ontario. This is our 3rd year there, a fantastic Walleye lake with great fall pike fishing. Looking at several places for a possible 2nd trip. Seanik"
1356650,NathanH,2011-10-10 14:39:00,697,Always good advice. I look forward to booking my trip in the near future as well. That being said given the economy I doubt that we will see a big rush to Canada in 2012. but who knows.
1356924,gmattbruin,2011-10-11 18:28:00,174,you should have a great trip. fished hebner couple times several years ago when TwinLakes had it. Not huge walleye but numbers are unreal. they are clones of each other. We fished a real heavy mayfly hatch one year a nd I think we caught more than normal. very shallow lake
1356937,Rich B,2011-10-11 19:08:00,1081,"The boys are sending me their deposits for our cabin, and we have our week booked up at Cedar Lake for the 2012 Opener.....looking at adding a few new faces this year, and hoping all the ones from the past years will be able to join us. A lot of great memories from our prior Spring trips, and hoping to make many more in 2012. Rich B"

1355218,onetimedave,2011-10-04 17:36:00,502,"In talking with our outfitter they are telling me that 2012 deposits are coming in and some of the best dates are filling up. It is not to early to make your plans. Hebner Lake in 2012, a new experience."
1355250,JayM5209,2011-10-04 19:11:00,1050,Thanks for the heads up. Yesterday I mailed a check for my son and me to do our 1st fly-in . . . . Abbey Lake the week of June 16. Now I need to start kicking some behinds to get my Memorial Day week crew of six to make up their minds. After 32 years at the same place I'm trying hard to get them to try something new. Then there's the late season 2012 solo trip I want to do. Sure would be nice to get back to Eagle Lake for a 2nd time.Dang! It's going to be a long winter.
1355283,Mike Borger,2011-10-04 20:40:00,1554,"If that's Abbey Lake with Park's out of Hawk Junction I was just there in August and had a great trip.If it is I'm more than happy to help with locations.Cheers, Mike"
1355292,JayM5209,2011-10-04 21:35:00,1050,"Mike, that's it. I saw your report of the August trip to Abbey and sent my son a link to it. It really cranked him up, and we booked a week with Park's. After a dozen or so trips over the years with my early season group, my son's teaching job has prevented him from going the last ten yrs. So, when I retired five years ago he and I started doing a trip together later in the summer. One of his friends and the friend's 15 year old son are going with us to Abbey.We're primarily walleye fishers, jigs/plastic tails and spinner/crawler rigs with some trolling with ShadRaps, Taildancers, etc. Any suggestions on gear, the lake, etc., will be greatly appreciated - either here or by PM.Thanks..........Jay"
1355306,Mike Borger,2011-10-05 03:35:00,1554,"That's great Jay, check your pm's."
1355308,TIGHTLINER,2011-10-05 04:04:00,223,BACK TO MELCHETT LAKE FOR MY GROUP SON IS GATHERING DEPOSITS AT PRESENT AND WILL MAIL THEM EARLY NEXT WEEK. GOING TO BE A LONG WINTER FOR ME BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TOO. THANKS TO ONETIMEDAVE FOR GETTING ME THERE. LET US KNOW HOW HEBNERLAKE GOES.
1355324,NARDA 1,2011-10-05 06:32:00,636,Good advice. We booked for our annual September trip before we left the lodge this year. Only 336 days to go!!!!
1355407,UKBDM,2011-10-05 10:46:00,178,Already reserved the 8 man cabin @ Jim And Julie's on Wabaskang Lake for the last week in June. Don't know who is going with me but I plan on making this trip for the next 30 years or so.
1355512,nitrodude,2011-10-05 16:22:00,60,I made my cabin deposit 16 yrs. ago for my first trip and just roll it over year after year. Our group has three cabins now and if we didn't roll our deposits over we would not have had them these many years. My FIL started going to the same place we all go to every year in 1966. We count the days until the third week of June starting in July when we check out of the lodge. Lac Seul is truly one of God's gifts to us fishermen!
1355618,1shooter,2011-10-05 22:26:00,1493,I am booked for our spring trip for the next 9 years..
