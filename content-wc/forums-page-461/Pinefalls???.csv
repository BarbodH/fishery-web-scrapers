1358873,Campcountry,2011-10-18 14:22:00,164,A good observation - I would tend to agree with you.
1358929,Burr,2011-10-18 17:10:00,8612,"I just got back from 10 days at PF. Water temps were mostly 57-58, until the last couple days when it cooled off to 54.Bite was tough, but we found scatterred fish each day, but really hard finding concentrations, that all changed last Thursday when the wind finally came out of the NW. The bite turned on all over for a day before it got muddy from the wind. It seemed like the **** may have been opened up just a bit more at the same time.With the mud on the lake, Friday, Saturday, Sunday I could only catch fish in the river. I'm not that good in the river, I was able to catch some, but the locals do better there. Actually I spent a great deal of time on the bay just because my head is hard and I had to continue to prove the fish won't bite in dirty water.Plenty of water to shoot the rapids and fish by the ****. Sauger mania.Low flow year, I don't expect it to get really hot. Lot's of jumbo perch in the system early in the week. Once the greenbacks move in maybe the perch numbers will fall a bit."

1359082,Tony Shirley,2011-10-19 08:19:00,211,It will be on fire this weekend
1354063,Guest,2011-09-30 07:35:00,0,"Ya, I agree. No way do miles and miles of nets choking off the rivers and the flats outside the river mouths do anything to the fishery. It's not like they take millions upon millions of pounds of greenbacks out. Heck, I watched a guy with a 100' net fill up his 16' Lund to the gunnels between a couple of seats one night at sunset in front of his cabin. I'm sure this removal of fish helps grow more fish, bigger fish, and improves the catch rate. Sometimes all the fish even get cleaned and processed. Amazingly, the quota's are never filled either because the net fishing is so bad."
1354140,Tony Shirley,2011-09-30 11:27:00,211,"Its sounds like a great excuse why some ppl dont catch fish lol,I hammered walleyes beside a a net ,watched him pull up his nets and he had seven walleyes lol.Make sure u tip the jig with a shiner"
1354166,mrwalleye5,2011-09-30 13:33:00,1922,Dang that's what I'm doing wrong!! LOL
1354636,Burr,2011-10-02 19:49:00,8612,Did fishing improve at all this weekend? What's the water temp?
1354717,mrwalleye5,2011-10-03 06:26:00,1922,"Water temp 57 F. For this time of the year it's slow. Squeezed out 4 greenbacks in 4.5 hours in the bay. Largest 27"". Lots of perch, bunch of drum. As long as no one drags me up there,lol, I won't be going for a couple weeks. Hopefully they will move in a bit better."
1354895,yurtman,2011-10-03 16:07:00,46,was out for 4 hours mid to late afternoon Sunday. water temp 58.5F. fishing really slooowwww. everyone we talked to said the same. catching a lot of drum and the odd white bass. no walleye. marked a lot of big fish in a 36 foot deep trough close to the bay - catfish? nothing was actively biting though.
1354976,Guest,2011-10-03 21:16:00,0,Man it just plain old sucks Its a DESERT! The fish seemed to have bypassed and went to the Red
1355015,mrwalleye5,2011-10-04 06:21:00,1922,The Red is producing far better then Pine Falls. Red had good to high water flow all year and that seems to be what is making the difference. I may have to breakdown and fish the Red as much as I dislike the mass of boats.
1355160,Guest,2011-10-04 14:39:00,0,I'd rather have to hunt for fish at PF than fish the Red Can't take the Circus Act that performs there
1358706,Blackwatercats,2011-10-17 23:27:00,23,"It seems to me that a combination of current and cleaner water is the key to the greenback migrations. current alone does not seem to matter if it is dirty water, This year Pine Falls has almost no current and the bite sucks. The red has current but the water has also cleared up and the greenbacks are in thick. last year the Red had really heavy current but very dirty water and the bite sucked while pine falls had lots of current, cleaner water and the fishing was incredible. Found pretty much the same thing on the Big lake all winter I don't think temperature makes as big of a deal as people might think, if the are catching them in numbers in mid summer on traverse bay?"
1350205,Dipstick,2011-09-16 14:28:00,101,"Anyone have any recent information on PF? Laurent, when do you expect it to pick up? Thanks"
1350406,Guest,2011-09-17 11:24:00,0,"I was going out today but plans changed, should have a report from others today or tomorrow. What I do know it that we have finally been getting some cold weather at night. There is bait in the system because our local bait guy did very well later in the year. All indications are that water levels will remain very low for the fall fish. There is little to no current, they make power at the dam during peek power demands, this creates some current. Will it be a river bite i think so but only time will tell. Fishing was really good all summer out there we fished in 4 8ft of water trolling spinners and pulling shallow cranks along the shore line. The numbers of fish this summer was incredible at times.....where will they be this fall who knows."
1350472,Dipstick,2011-09-17 18:48:00,101,Thanks Laurent. It would be great if you could add an update after this weekend. Looking forward to being up there.
1350776,Hawgeye,2011-09-18 22:24:00,1355,Coming up for our annual early pine falls run in less than two weeks. Look forward to catching some fish. See you then Laurant!
1350829,Guest,2011-09-19 08:11:00,0,Hold off as long as you can still pretty sloooooow!!!
1351139,Guest,2011-09-20 06:13:00,0,Most people i speak to report that there are still alot of Drum in the system. Some people have done well although most people I have spoken to have had limited success. Water temp is 64 as of Monday.
1352652,mrwalleye5,2011-09-25 07:10:00,1922,"Was out on yesterday. Never had it so poor this time of the year. 3 drum, 10 perch, 3 walleye that would all fit in my pocket.."
1352677,Guest,2011-09-25 08:25:00,0,"the bite is slow this year, it was a really hot summer and the water temperature is still 59 degs. we tried everything from bottom bouncing to jigging, crawlers and minnows and trolled with cranks. the bite is just not there yet."
1352746,Guest,2011-09-25 12:02:00,0,"fishing in pine falls right now is brutal, too much netting. all i seen was net after net...the only was to get walleye i guess is to go steal them off nets...mmmm tasty!"
1353812,Tony Shirley,2011-09-29 09:18:00,211,"Nets dont make a difference up there , fish just arent there yet"
