Looked to me that this camp is completey Handicapped Accesible. The boats for upgrade are crazy. I saw a pontoon for wheelchair access. 3 Lund 1625 Rebel SS 40 hp. I like the concept.

The new boats are great and Darcy will put you on the fishing holes. They both work like crazy and are always making improvements to the camp. Our cabin has always been spotless when we have arrived. My dad caught a great walleye this year. 31"", 8 pound 7oz. We plan on going back."
1355744,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-06 12:00:00,1460,"Jarbear,How fast do those boats go? 40mph? Bet they fly across open water.Big congrats on that 31. Canp is handicapped accesable? Pontoon?"
1356126,Bearfangary,2011-10-07 21:03:00,22,"Been to BearPaw twice; Fall of 2010 and spring 2011, going back for a thiird shot next June. We've had both good and poor fishing. The poor was our own fault because we didn't listen to the tips Darcy gave is.Both Darcy and Joy are working maniacs and are always improving the camp. Solar power, handicapped cabin pontoon accessable and they're putting in an elevator for easier access for those who need the help. My dad is 86 and can't handle the stairs, so he got a golf cart to help him get around.Cabins have instant use water heaters and also dishwashers for easy clean up. The hill to 2 cabins was a steep climb for some so they did some landscaping for better access. Darcy always has a keg tapped with cold beer.All this on a great fishing lake, for a reasonable price. Two thumbs up. - BFG"

The pontoon boat looks nice and is set up with everything one would need. Looks like it has wide doors for easy access, and the boat deck is level to the dock. All the boats are clean and well maintained. Nice place for sure."
