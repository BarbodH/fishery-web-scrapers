1356649,Hntnfsh4evr,2011-10-10 14:38:00,5,"Man I wish you would have found my green coat instead. Flew out of the boat right in that area...camera, watch, fishing license all history. Now nobody believes me that we had some 13"" perch and caught a 22"" smallmouth."
1356784,Mike Kansas,2011-10-11 08:43:00,1463,"Yes I did. It had about $6,000 in it and a Lund Tyree. I will pick it up at your house tomorrow. Thanks"
1356862,Babamel2,2011-10-11 14:26:00,414,It is so good to see this post. The world needs more people like this who are willing to find the owner. More of this kind of action would help make the world safer.
1356864,wallydave,2011-10-11 14:34:00,2151,It is good to know that people are looking to do the right thing!
1356865,wallydave,2011-10-11 14:35:00,2151,A little fun is a good thing too!
1356916,Fishin Fun,2011-10-11 18:10:00,218,I would have given up a duffle bag full of valuables if I could have been fishing there last weekend. Ha!
1357025,oly67,2011-10-12 06:29:00,241,"I was scared to mention the Lund, figured nobody would claim it and I would be stuck with it.( I am a Ranger owner) 6000 bucks!!?? I don't remember any 6000 bucks!!???"
1357058,Mike Kansas,2011-10-12 08:27:00,1463,Well if you are going to be that way just keep the Lund in case your Ranger ever leaks. Unless you just want to split the $6000.
