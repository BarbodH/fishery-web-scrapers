1355235,Reels,2011-10-04 18:26:00,2876,"We do it all the time. I toss out the walleye, eagle comes to get it while we send Steve up to the nest to get an egg for breakfast."
1355243,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-04 19:00:00,725,you had to go there!
1355820,bigwalleye1,2011-10-06 19:18:00,2632,"Where's Mushmouth when you need him. 3 pages in and only one Gestapo reference, a couple US citizen wanton waste slams... How about this: Dang Canadians! Whining about giving up a few walleyes to secure the future of our national bird. You'd think there was a limit on walleyes or something. We eat all we catch, limits are for suckers, big fish taste better and draw eagles from further away. Eagles gotta eat, too, and besides, it's not like there's limited food up there like there was in the concentration camps, When the Gestapo was running them, besides, it brings them in closer for a shot. They taste a little like loon, something like osprey, but a little gamier, and besides, with the elimination of DDT (BY THE US, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW) they've been increasing in population for yeaqrs. Who says we're not conservation minded? Besides, us not wanting to get out on the islands for shore lunch, since fires are so much work, putting them out is a chore, and who the heck do they think they are up there, trying to charge people for the cost of fighting those pesky fires? I'll feed and eat eagles and osprey in the good ole USA, thank you very much, and even if I have to pay a fine here, it's in American Dollars to American fish cops, and they won't be plantin' evidence in my car or cabin while I'm gone fishing. There. THAT'S the way to complain Mushmouth style."
1355934,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-07 09:02:00,725,You are the master. That was well thought out and stated as well as it could be.
1358445,Enid Elizabeth,2011-10-17 08:04:00,59,"Yup those eagles are born and bred in Canada and, like us, they like fish!"
1354428,Guest,2011-10-01 19:53:00,0,"I am appalled that you would consider feeding a Rock bass to an eagle. A walleye OK. A pike OK. Eagles are a beautiful and voracious bird and they have to eat. In places on our lake they more or less insist and exist on handouts. But The King of Fishes? Never! Rock Bass are highly revered in my drinking group and their beauty is undisputed by anyone with taste. Eagles do not have taste, just unquenchable appetites"
1354450,alanexpup,2011-10-02 02:26:00,278,"the question would be, does that walleye count towards you limit??? I would think that if you count that in your limit you can do what you want within reason , and feeding an eagle is within reason. end of story."
1354542,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-02 13:52:00,235,"I should add that had the eagle not gone for the fish, the fish would have been collected and put on the stringer and counted towards our legal possession limit. I don't see any moral issue with what was done, but not sure on the legal."
1354828,Guest,2011-10-03 12:21:00,0,"Not sure if it is illegal, but I question the ethics of the eagle. Was this a community fishing hole or was the eagle moving in on ""your"" spot."
1354862,joeman79,2011-10-03 14:05:00,417,"If the Gestapo (C.O.) had you under surveillance and on video, you would probably be reading this from a Canadian Concentration Camp. Wanton Waste is what they would call it here in Kansas. I imagine it is illegal but I know ALOT of guys do it. I have seen people having shorelunch use their cleaned fish at shore lunch on top of a stick or stump and they come pluck it off."
1354864,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-03 14:06:00,725,"and furthermore, why the heck is Canada concerned about the welfare of our national bird. They should get their own flippin' national bird! Eagles must like fishing in Canada as much as we do since I see a lot more eagles in Canada compared to the US! But they don't really live there, they are just visiting."
1354875,tv4fish,2011-10-03 15:01:00,2694,"Who else was aware of this little fact:Quote: The loon has been Ontario's official bird since 1994. The loon is associated with wilderness and solitude. It is a water bird found all over Ontario and is well known for its diving I didn't know that Minnesota ""shared"" our State bird. (I guess they just can't tell when they cross the State line)"
1354881,Hot Runr Guy,2011-10-03 15:24:00,16061,"Who else was aware of this little fact: Quote: The loon has been Ontario's official bird since 1994.

1354889,v-bay gord,2011-10-03 15:37:00,3168,"Since citizenship is usually established by country of birth, I would dispute the claim that most bald eagles are just ""visiting"" Canada. In fact many of those supposed ""American"" bald eagles are born in Canada and are therefor illegal immigrants to your country. Attatched is a great picture of a young of the year bald eagle, born and bred in NW Ontario.....a proud Canadian!! A similar case could also be made about the loon as well, but there is no need to be greedy, we are happy to share our iconic animals. Anybody want a few beavers??"
1354975,Steve of Madison,2011-10-03 21:16:00,230,"I agree, and I have made ""special friends"" of a nesting pair every year. First perch from the area near the nest gets sacrificed to the ""fishing gods"" and they smile upon my boat every year."
1354336,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-01 10:00:00,235,"A couple years ago, two guys in our Canada group were out fishing and noticed an eagle in a tree on the shoreline. They caught a smaller walleye (13 or 14 inches), whacked it on the head to stun it, and then they tossed it in the water as far they could get it from the boat. The eagle then swooped down and grabbed the fish and brought it back to its nest for a meal. The whole moment was caught on video and it was pretty cool. My question is - is this legal?"
1354339,castnblast,2011-10-01 10:37:00,111,i would have to guess...not legal on that one.
1354355,Golden Eagle,2011-10-01 12:46:00,2642,"In case it's not legal, do you suppose a fishcop would accept your written confession on Walleye Central?"
1354366,Obabikon,2011-10-01 14:08:00,2370,"It isn't legal... but, your friends aren't the only people to do it."
1354367,Golden Eagle,2011-10-01 14:20:00,2642,Do they pitch the walleye down wind so the eagle has to fly toward the boat to make a pick up?
1354374,SteveJ715,2011-10-01 15:11:00,59,I believe it's only illegal if the fish would put the eagle over his limit for the day.
1354376,Bill Krejca,2011-10-01 15:26:00,6107,"It probably falls into the category of wasting a resource.....at least until the eagle swoops it up. The fisherman gets a fine, and the eagle goes off scott free. Bill"
1354385,Golden Eagle,2011-10-01 16:47:00,2642,"A few of us should be posting as ""guest""."
1354404,1shooter,2011-10-01 18:25:00,1493,I can see doing this but dont waste the walleyes. How about a rock bass or a small perch?
1354413,Obabikon,2011-10-01 18:48:00,2370,a rockbass? These eagles deserve better than that! (not that I would ever do something like this)
