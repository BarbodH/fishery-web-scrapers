1353966,elkman99,2011-09-29 17:47:00,180,"Can anyone help me out with some musky fishing info for Dogpaw? I know this is a walleye board, but this is by far the best one out there for canadian lake info. I know its trout water but was wondering how big it is, the trophy potential, and access. Is it better to stay on Caviar and boat to it? How far of a boat ride is it from the camps on caviar? Thanks for any help, Tony"
1353972,MN_Moose,2011-09-29 18:21:00,964,"It's been a few years since I've been up there and at that time I wasn't much of a musky fisherman. As to the type of water it's not as deep as say Whitefish Bay LOTW. You have reefs and humps. Points and bays. Current through the narrows leading to Caviar. The ""narrows"" are much of a narrows. Easy to boat through wide open. Boating bewteen Caviar and Dogpaw is not a problem, not very far either. If you didn't stay at Jim's or the other camp on Caviar (not sure if that one is still operating) I don't know where you'd stay. No resorts on Dogpaw. Could stay in Sioux Narrows and trailer each day but that would be a pain. Can't boat from Whitefish Bay to Dogpaw as there is a dam. The boys at Jim's run out to Dogpaw pretty much every evening for a few hours. I'd consider staying there. The water isn't ""big"" more of a bay on LOTW. It has trophy potential up to 50"""
1354021,elkman99,2011-09-29 21:20:00,180,thanks Moose. So does Caviar have musky in it too? It sounds like Dogpaw could have some trophy musky in it. Does anyone else have any musky info for the lake?
