1358758,tv4fish,2011-10-18 07:34:00,2694,Guss: Just a thought here - Are you going to the same resort both times? (Probably not?) Otherwise - when I've made 2 trips to the same resort - the resort owner allowed me to store the boat at the resort 'til the 2nd trip. Even if you're NOT going back to the same resort - it wouldn't cost anything to ask one of the resorts if you COULD store the boat until the second trip. ???
