How many days do they fish it before they decide if they want to lease land on it and build a cabin? Surely it would be risky to base your decision off of just fishing the place a few hours. Slow or hot fishing can be a fluke sometimes. And how do I get the job of ""test fisherman""? I'll work for free if they just fly me in. I can assure you that if I can catch fish there, any of their customers can, too."

Like Ten horse mentioned they fly-in to a lake and scout it, then the long process of going through MNR! I wish I could remeber the outfitter, by that was too many searches ago, but he had to supply MNR with several reports on how many, what size and which species were caught. It does not sound like an easy process, but MNR has the job of protecting the fisheries we like so much! Perhaps others will have more info!"
1357761,jambi,2011-10-14 12:45:00,504,We've wondered the same thing. I would guess like wallydave said the MNR process is pretty lengthy. Lots to consider before allowing an outpost. When the fires were being fought this summer I saw a snapshot of the MNRs mapping system that showed all outposts and boat caches. Pretty awesome mapping they had put together.
1359107,Jig Man,2011-10-19 09:33:00,95,I think I remember reading the story you refrenced and I belive it might have been Shearstone Lake w/Amik Outposts.
