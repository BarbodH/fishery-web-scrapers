1357071,northernbite,2011-10-12 08:56:00,1186,We go up in the area that Lenray travels but have pop up truck camper. That is as modern as it gets. Went to a fish camp once and there was to many people. In July I spend 10 days tenting it up in Canada on an island and really enjoy that. No people around and that is fine.Paul

1357138,wallydave,2011-10-12 12:30:00,2151,Sounds like a skit from Possum Lodge with Edgar Montrose! KAABOOOMM!!
1357574,Jiggin the Point,2011-10-13 19:27:00,24,"WOW many memories here, My father used to pack us 3 boys in his Chrysler, hook on the old Starcraft and drive a straight 22 hrs north of Cleveland to the Waswanipi area of Quebec. we would go 10 mile down the lake to a little island hidden, in a back cove. There would be a sleeping tent and a big screen tent ...""remember boys, the sleeping tent is for sleeping only!"" on cold years (1st week of June) there would be clear plastic around the outside to keep it a little warmer. We lived on fish, hot dogs, soup, eggs, canned bacon cooked on that good old Coleman Stove. we fished a bunch and those Zebco 202's sure could catch some fish. Never forget the 56 degree mid week baths or having to break camp in the rain... that was over 40 years ago and I recently took my nephew on the same trip a couple of years ago, man it seemed a lot tougher and I only had one kid with me, my dad took 3 of us every year, starting when we were only 8 years old."
1357830,Larry Mac,2011-10-14 16:51:00,530,"Hi Jiggin the Point, Thank you for sharing that wonderful memory. Your dad sounds like a very special man. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1357856,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-14 18:46:00,235,"I've done the Boundary Waters and the Sylvania Wilderness, and that's as ""roughing it"" as I can handle. It has its charms, but paddling, portaging and a lack of refrigeration gets old. My ideal would situation is an outpost cabin, fly in or boat in (have never done the latter). I like the seclusion but with amenities. I wish they had Internet up there - not to check my email, but to check weather radars and forecasts. I actually wouldn't mind a TV and DVD player too - I'd bring some movies to watch if the weather got bad. This past year, my friends dad brought his laptop with all our past years Canada trip videos digitized. We had fun watching videos from years past - it made me sentimental for my youth (I say this as 34 year old). We had a flush toilet in the cabin this year, but it was a ""piss only"" policy per the outfitter."
1358641,NARDA 1,2011-10-17 16:05:00,636,I like roughing it too. So the lodge gave me a golf cart to use to go back and forth from the cabin to the bar!!!! They even put a license plate on it!!!
1358953,trapper_john,2011-10-18 18:12:00,83,"I would think that 14 days in Boundary Watershaters would qualify for roughing it. Only two nights in the same place. The bread that we managed to hord went moldy, the last two eggs that we saved were bad and we were outta there. Bathing in ice cold water, portages always seemed to be up hill, skeeters and black flys. Oh yea, don't forget the rain. It was an awesome trip. Too old now so all I have are pictures and great memories. Oh yes, that was way before they started to tell you where you had to camp. In the two weeks we only saw three other canoe campers. I feel sorry for my grand kids."
1356191,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-08 08:32:00,1460,"Before the advent of solor power, fishing camps were very rustic. Lighting propane mantles for light and hauling water up from the lake were staples of the times. Navigating by map or by seat of your pants. Rain gear sucked. Washing your face and brushing your teeth at the dock. Old time fisherman were not molly-coddled. A tip of my hat goes to you.Today, outfitters and camps feel a need to provide different comforts for their guests to stay competitive. Pool tables, microwaves and dishwasher, TV and Wifi are at their disposal now. Using indoor toilet at Forrest Lodge was a new one for me. I kind of liked that. Sat. phone is also a comfort I like, just for the peace of mind. Enclosed fish house is a comfort I miss, but everybody needs to clean it up and haul off guts so the bear doesn't destroy it. Me, I cringe at the thought of cell towers up there. If I would ever catch the kid texting up there, I would throw the phone in the lake. Me, just dreamin about a boat/motor upgrade.What kind of comforts do you look for?"
1356202,jimirjr,2011-10-08 10:01:00,1149,"yeah, we've all become a bunch of wimps in our old age......"
1356225,lenray,2011-10-08 12:45:00,467,Where I fish with my good friends the most modern thing we have is that we knock the crap out of the bottom of a lawn chair and tape a crapper lid to the chair and let the crap fly. We are pork and fish and beaners.
1356418,micropterus,2011-10-09 14:23:00,450,"Back in olden times we heated water on a propane stove. Bathing was up as far as possible, down as far as possible and then you washed possible."
1356628,Lovetofish,2011-10-10 13:26:00,458,I remember the days with propane lights and chopped lake ice from the ice shed. Also remember how cheap a trip was too. Not so anymore.
1356655,wallydave,2011-10-10 14:52:00,2151,"I like ""just enough"" of the idea of roughing it. Small cabins with a kitchen running water, indoor plumbing and lights is all I need. Part of the trip is ""getting away"" from all the things that make us soft and too comfortable. Part of my dna has a link to the ""hunter gather"" mode of operation. Part of the satifaction of a trip North is overcoming/dealing with things in the ""bush"". When I return home, I feel gratitude for the creature comforts because I have been able to satisfy my need for a simpler life. I do like the boat upgrades that Goose Bay Camp offers, and the cabins are just what I need, besides I could stay near home in a cabin, it is the fishing that draws me North at first, now it is the whole package that I like/need!"
1356658,Bill Krejca,2011-10-10 15:07:00,6107,"After thinking about all the creature comforts now available, my most appreciated is maybe not having to cook in the wind and rain. At 30 degrees F. Bill"
1356692,davis,2011-10-10 17:57:00,18,"Roughing it was not rough. My earliest roughing it memories are at Wabaskang camping on a small island in a tent with no walls or screen. It was a fabulous time for a kid. When a cabin was built on the island, nearly 50 years ago, we began our trips up 599 to Fitchie, Miinchin and then Hamilton Lake but we had graduated to tents with screens and floor. Eventually pickup campers. The only rough times were several days of rain and if we touched the sides of the tent, it would draw water. This year was the first in a cabin. It was ok, but not the same, at all."
1356720,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-10 19:54:00,725,"Time to chime in here. I spent a lot of time backpacking and camping when I lived in Colorado and I loved it a lot. But that was 30 years and 60 lbs. ago. These days I enjoy the level of roughing it I now experience. On our trips to Wine lake Camp we have to unload and portage a 16' lund and 25 hp motor over a small falls on a ramp and then load it back again. That is my limit these days- and the women think it is too rustic, so they stay home. When we get to camp, they still use outhouses and the trip up the hill to them gets me plenty out of breath (of course, as the week goes on there could be a large amount of cigar smoke that could be a factor). Tent camping and cooking on an open fire is for young people, I will enjoy being Amish for a week."
1356972,mrwalleye5,2011-10-11 20:56:00,1922,"12 -15 years ago I was lucky enough to live and work in a Skandinavian community in Saskatchewan that really liked to ice fish. I got to know a group of fellows that knew some engineers in Saskatoon that had a remote cabin in Northern Saskatchewan. We would go in by snowmobile to this cabin and generally the only payment that was taken was that we haul in supplies 12 miles that the camp needed during the summer. I was into that camp a number of times during the winters. The cabin was a bit rustic but had solar lighting, heating fuel stove, wood stove and other niceties. The outhouse was your normal wooden shanty a few paces from the cabin. Digging a whole was impossible because the entire camp was on solid rock. In the January to March the mornings were pretty fresh, so you tended to do your business and didn't dilly dally. On one of the trips the outhouse needed to be repositioned as the ""refuse"" was building up through the hole in the freezing temps. We left that to the camp owners. When we came back the next year, in the winter of course, here is the outhouse sitting on two giant I beams.Pieces of toilet paper hanging from the spruce trees. Remember at the start I said the camp was owned by a group of ""engineers"". Well what happened was these guys decided to dynamite a hole in the rock to sit the outhouse on. They probably did a couple things wrong. They over estimated the charge and they placed the charge to near to the original location of the outhouse. When it blew there was dung and toilet paper flying everywhere. What resulted was a massive hole twenty feet round and four feet deep. So they dragged a couple of I beams across the hole set the outhouse on it and that was it. Now when you went to do your business it was like sitting in a wind tunnel. Now that was roughing it."
