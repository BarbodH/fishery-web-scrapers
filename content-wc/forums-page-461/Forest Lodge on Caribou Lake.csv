1346729,drew59,2011-09-04 11:38:00,87,Great report! Thanks! Sorry to hear about your wife's knee though. We're there walleyes biting at Mary Jo's island?My wife and I hit camp on Friday. Lost my Dad on Wedneday. He loved fishing in Canada as much as I do. Looking forward to a Caribou Lake therapy session.
1347209,rms0528,2011-09-06 10:48:00,18,"I personally didn't fish that spot, but there were a few in camp who did and caught fish. I was going to fish there; I stopped on my way out of the first day and marked fish on the finder, but never went back.Sorry to hear about your Dad. You'll definitely enjoy a Caribou Lake Therapy session. I lost mine 21 years ago and I still get a pang in the chest thinking about all the hunting and fishing we did together, knowing there will be no more memmories. I was actually thinking about him last week and wishing we had the chance to share a trip to Caribou together."
1347231,Pikeslayer8,2011-09-06 12:06:00,1460,"Well done Rick. Terribly sorry to hear of your wife's injury. Keep us updated on her progress. Any blue walleye? What were your best fish? Any pics?Drew, you have a tough act to follow. My condolences. I've fished with my dad in Ontario for many years. My 1st trip after he died was powerful. His presense will be there. My fondest memory from that trip(also posted on most memorable moments thread) in which we had a memorial service on shore lunch rock. That night was my turn to say the blessing. And as my custom to have a moment of silence to reflect on the dear departed fisherman in our group. Men like Ralph, Bob, Len and Jack and now I had to include Buck. Very emotional, to lighten the mood I asked my dad for a big fish. Said we've been talkin awhile about a big fish. You got any pull on that from the big guy? It's the middle of the trip. How about it? The next morning within a half hour of fishing I catch a 42"" pike. Another half hour later my brother catches a 42"" pike at a diferent part of the lake. Coincidence, I don't think so. Have a safe and prosporous trip. Take some pics.Ole Timer, my wife and I are anxious to meet on the 27th and hear firsthand of your exploits. I plan on making my ""bleu cheese linguine with buffalo walleye"" for the camp in conjuntion with Scott's fish fry if possible. Don't know what day that is yet.Took my family to Lake Mcconaughy for labor day. Kinda miserable trip. My wife's old boss of some 30 years ago set up his pop trailer at a prime spot early in the week. When we get there the area is overflowing with Hobie Cat sailors having a regatta. Sorry, not my kind of people.(Make sail not fish). Saturday was too windy to rent a fishing boat or sail and I was stuck in camp. Ouch. Sunday we finally got out for a few hours. Man do I ever hate jet skies! Caught a few small bass and bluegill and got a good reminder of why I fish Ontario."
1347986,rms0528,2011-09-08 17:56:00,18,"No blue walleye, but plenty with a beautiful green tint. The biggest walleye for the week were a couple of 21.5 inches, which was a little unusual, but the numbers were still fun. I only fished for pike for about an hour, the biggest was 26. There were a couple guys in camp who fished for pike every other day. They set a personal record of 42 pike in one day during the week and had several in the upper 30's and a few in the 40's. I didn't measure the lake trout, most were in the 4-5 pound range. I had one that was in the 10-12 pound range. An update on the wife's knee...She had an MRI yesterday and we got the results today. Turns out the knee is fine, she actually broke her tibia just below the knee. So, no ACL injury, just a broken leg."
1353113,drew59,2011-09-26 18:16:00,87,"Slayer, Rick, and Old Timer,Did you guys get the PM I sent? I sent one out when I got back a couple of weeks ago."
1354306,bode,2011-10-01 07:02:00,39,"Well, you guys have sparked an interest in Caribou Lake that I never could. Been going there the last 8-10 years after doing fly-ins since 1974. It is a great lake--most people don't believe you get that quality of fishing for the price. We stay at Caribou Lake Lodge--not fancy but for the price and fishing who cares?I would challenge anyone to come up with that kind of fishing for less than $400 for six days. (and we don't take our own boats as we have to travel 1100 miles one way) Next year Kerry is going back to 7 days and I doubt the price changes much unless fuel doubles.We only walleye fish and spend most of our time around Green, Beaver, Fred's Point, Shawn, Witch Islands and sometimes near Finger Bay. Always go the end of July, jig 20-30 feet down and never disappointed.Good to hear that other people enjoy Caribou's great fishery."
1354543,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-02 13:54:00,1460,"Drew, did not get a pm. Did you recieve mine? Hi Bode. You are absolutely correct in that Caribou Lake is a great value. How do you get to Caribou Lake Lodge? Are you boated in from the public boat launch by FLL?Just got back late last night."
1354830,rms0528,2011-10-03 12:19:00,18,"Drew,I just looked and got your PM. I haven't logged in for a couple weeks. It's been busy around here being the only one in the house with 2 good legs. First time I've done laundry, cleaned bathrooms, vacuumed, etc. all at the same time in quite a while. Lisa's broken leg is healing. We see the doctor again on Thursday and we're hoping weightbearing is autorized. She's been walking on it around the house quite a bit lately even though she's not supposed to. Glad to hear you had a good trip. Rick"
1354925,drew59,2011-10-03 18:33:00,87,I wondered about the PM's. When I didn't hear from any of you I figured there was a problem. Hopefully Slayer and Old Timer did well.
1355225,drew59,2011-10-04 17:54:00,87,"Slayer,I feel terrible that you guys didn't get my PM. We did have two poor days of fishing but overall we had a decent trip. We eventually figured things out and I PM'd the details to you, Rick and OT. If you ever want more info or have any questions let me know."
1355294,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-04 21:45:00,1460,"Drew,The fishing was so secondary to me on this trip. I will always remember this trip fondly. We really did have a wonderful time. The wife and I needed this time for ourselves. I'm sure that you understand what I mean what with you going with your wife all these years. Relationships are more important but it does take work. Mine is goodI'm much more interested in how you got along. Did you get my pm to you?"
1355392,bode,2011-10-05 10:01:00,39,"Pikeslayer,Haven't been on the computer for a few days so I didn't get to respond to your question about boating over to Caribou Lake Lodge.The owner has part ownership of the small cabin and dock on the left before you get to Forrest Lodge. You may have noticed some vehicles parked near the drive to the small cabin. That is where we get the boat to go to the camp. We generally call when we get into Armstrong to let him know that we have arrived.Didn't catch any monster walleye this year (largest was 25 1/2 inch). The great thing to me is that we always catch several year classes of fish. Should always be a great fishery."
1355528,drew59,2011-10-05 16:59:00,87,"Hi Slayer,You and I sound like kindred spirits. I know exactly what you mean. I gave up worrying about how many fish we catch a long time ago. It's amazing to be able to spend a week with your wife and love being together every minute. We're lucky I guess.I did NOT get a PM from you. Is that feature of the site not working?"
1354988,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-03 22:20:00,1460,"Arrived at Forrest lodge Tues afternoon. Set up and was on the water by 2:00. Did not have any trouble finding ""Ole Timer"" on the lake. He told me where he would be. Awesome man this ""Ole Timer"". Tom also. They shared what they knew with me as conditions then were warm and still. Water temp @ 59. Water level down about 3'. I decided to go fish Smoothrock falls for the rest of the day, fished in 15-25 ft. of water and caught nothing. 2 brutal bite-offs.Wed, I was first on the lake and decided to drag crawler harness w bttm. bouncer at spot marked by Scott and verified by OT. Pretty much open water fishing @40-60' Wasn't long before other boats moved in on me but keeping a respectable distance. I moved on hoping to find my own spot, ended up at the far end of the lake past Keller Island near ""Little America"". Caught 1 walleye using 3/8 oz jig w pink thumper tail. Getting back to camp, I discovered the other group in camp(that moved in on me) did well not too long after I left. Oh well. They were a great bunch of guys even though they were Badgers. (Go Hawks). One guy named Buzz even showed me a picture of a 16.5"" blue walleye he caught. Brilliant blue color. One thing sticking in my craw abit was that Scott was there hearing this report and all he said was ""You must be doing something wrong"". Thank you Mr. Obvious. Kind of embarrassed me. He does tell me at checkout that bottom bouncers don't seem to work very well in this lake.On Thursday the weather changed with the start of a nasty cold front moving in. Temps fell, winds brought white caps (wife did not like). Went to the narrows to find some sheltered water albiet dead. Went back to Smoothrock Falls and Roxann finally catches a small pike. I had a biggun on for a short time just long enough to know it was over 35"". Tough day with the winds and rain.Friday we woke to 40 temps, very windy with temps dropping, by 8:30 was 35 and snowing. Since I was scheduled to leave on Sat anyway, we pulled the plug a day early. No redemption for me. I come back a humble Slayer. Caribou Lake is a deep, clear lake with little or no current. One small outlet trickles into Smoothrock with no major inlets. You wouldn't know it by me but I do believe it is a very nice fishery. Fishing pressure is much more than what I'm accoustomed to. In addition to Forrest Lodge and Caribou Lake Lodge their is Bear Paw Lodge and the ""Little America"" Indian camp. With a public launch, lots of boats.Proprietors, Scott and Mary Jo are very nice people and run a tight camp. You know guys, this is an awesome place to go on a spur. One of the great values out there. RV and even tent camping is availiable. I set my late trip with less than a months notice.Personally, I probably wouldn't go back as I have my June trips set and fall is where I want to experience other places in this slice of heaven we know as NW Ontario."
1343393,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-24 14:27:00,1460,"I noticed that Scott made a new post. Apparently the noise we are making on Walleye Central is starting to hit home. Word of mouth through this venue is very powerful. I would not be making this trip if I hadn't learned of this camp through Drew59 on Walleye Central. Oh, how the times they are a changing.Real happy to hear the fire is out and the smoke won't be an issue. Rick,Have a safe and prosperous trip. I definately want to here about your new personal bests. I think the bar is set at 32"" 12lbs for this years best walleye on Caribou.Drew and Ole Timer,Our time is coming soon, real soon."
1343453,drew59,2011-08-24 18:45:00,87,"Hi Slayer,I saw Scott's new post. We leave two weeks from tomorrow. Getting excited (obviously).For the others who are reading this, I am not a Pimp for Forrest Lodge. My wife and and I have been going to various places in Ontario for 30 years. We have done both drive-to and fly-in camps. We love the sollitude of fly-ins but the convenience of driving in (electricity, flush toilets and showers in the cabin). We feel Forrest Lodge is the best combo of the two. There is enough water to get away from everyone if that's your thing. The cabins, boats, and docks are top notch. Scott and May Jo are first class owners. The fishing has been great too. We LOVE the option of Lake Trout. Simply put, we wouldn't keep going back if we thought we could do better.I am more than willing to share detailed info with anyone who is interested. Just post here or send me a PM."
1343483,rms0528,2011-08-24 20:10:00,18,"One more day, one more day, one more day....of work. Leaving Friday to stay in Grand Marais before arriving in camp on Saturday. Both my wife and I are extremely excited. Scott signs his blog with ""Think Walleye""; I'm dreaming walleye in my sleep the last couple nights. Last minute order from Cabelas arrived today. The boat, rain gear, jackets and most dry goods are packed and ready to go. All that's left is refrigerator food, clothes and toiletries. Can't wait to start catching fish and eating fresh Canadian walleye for dinner. I'll definitely post an update when we get back. To echo Drew, I've also been to camps on LOTW, Clearwater, Gull Rock a few times, and Lac Seul several times all the months of June, July, August, and September the last 12 years. The walleye fishing on Caribou has been better than anywhere else I've been. I've had some great and good days on Lac Seul, but have always had a day or two during a week where the fishing was slow. The last time there even had two days where we didn't catch enough for dinner, and we weren't the only ones in camp who didn't. It was very unusual. It was the first time it happened in several trips, and it happened twice. I realize a normal slow day on Lac Seul is still better than a good day on most lakes in Minnesota where I'm from. I grew up with a cabin on Vermilion and was in my 30s before I fished walleye on a different lake. I've been to Caribou twice; this will be my third trip. The two previous weeks my slow days on Caribou were equal to a good day on Lac Seul. Great days on Caribou are unbelievable if not experienced first hand. Never been anywhere else where I've taken turns catching fish for a few hours with my wife, and it's happened more than once. Drew is accurate in the lake is large enough to get away and not see another boat all day if that's your desire. There's only three camps on the lake all on the southern end. It's also small enough that it can be done without burning a ton of gas every day. I also love the Lake Trout option. I used to have an RV and was Scott and MJ's first experiment with a RV in camp; now they advertise space for them. Sold the RV last year, and have a cabin rented this year. Although I've never stayed in one personally, we had friends who came with us the first time who stayed in one, and we spent a lot of time with them in theirs. I've toured all of them. They are all very nice and spaced to give privacy. For anyone who's wondering, I've been to other lakes with the RV and stayed in cabins on all the lakes listed. I always have brought my own boat. Although I have never used their boats, I know they take good care of theirs and the guest I've spoken to have liked them. I trust Drew's assessment of them. Scott and MJ are great people. To sum it all up. Great fishing, people, and accommodations. Solitude when you want it. Just a wonderful getaway from everyday work life. Disclaimer....no relation and not paid to write my opinion."
1343489,drew59,2011-08-24 20:50:00,87,"Have a great trip! We love the Gunflint Tavern for dinner in GM. Kind of funky but really good. The Bluewater has great breakfast. If you haven't tried it, hike Gooseberry or the Temperance River on the way up. Easy hikes. Well worth it. I'll look forward to your report."
1343813,ole timer,2011-08-25 17:40:00,34,I've noticed in pictures I've seen of walleyes from Caribou Lake that they are very dark color. Is Caribou a dark stained lake?
1343819,drew59,2011-08-25 18:31:00,87,"Hi ole timer,It is slightly stained but still pretty clear. I'd say the vis is at least six feet. It might be more. I haven't really paid that much attention. As you say, the walleyes are a nice dark color."
1344058,ole timer,2011-08-26 13:54:00,34,"Drew59,I'll be using a camp boat. Should I bring an electric?ot"
1344159,drew59,2011-08-26 20:15:00,87,I like having mine. The 30 hp 4 strokes are great but when it comes to vertical jigging the electric makes it much easier.
1346667,rms0528,2011-09-04 08:14:00,18,"Hey All, We made it back from a fantastic week of fishing. The bite was definitely on; some days better than others, but still good every day. We used white jigs with red hooks tipped with a minnow and slayed them every day. There were a few others in camp last week who were using Lindy rigs with leaches. They didn't do as well, but they still caught fish. There was a new group in camp and I took them to a couple of spots up the lake. While we were fishing in the same spot, we were catching 3-4 to their one. They had lots of bites and were loosing leaches, but we were catching them like crazy. There was a father and son team from Indiana who showed me how to fillet a pike and take the Y bones out. They came up to my boat while I was fishing a spot, and as usual I was pulling in a fish. The father laughed and said, I don't know how you do it, but every time we see you out on the lake your catching a walleye. LOL I also had my first experience of reeling in a walleye and having a pike latch on for the ride. He let go at the surface, but it was a fun fight while it lasted. The weather was warm and the walleye were mostly deep, 30-38 fow, and the trick was to bring them up slow. Since I learned how to fillet Pike we caught a few of them to bring home too. Lake Trout were fairly easy to catch as well using a silver and blue spoon and a portable down rigger set to approximately 55-60' fishing off the west on the other side of boo boo from camp. The wife became a real fisher person during the week. She learned to bait her own hook with minnows and remove fish from the hook, because I told her she had to stop fishing for awhile so I could catch a few. LOL. Everything was going great right up until Tuesday morning she fell while trying to get into the boat and messed up her knee. We came home a day early and stopped at urgent care in Duluth. It looks like she messed up her ACL and meniscus tendons in her right knee. We hope to have her looked at by a Orthopedic physician next week, possibly schedule surgery. All in all it was a great week of fishing, but not so great because of her knee. It was her first trip and luckily for me, she loved it and wants to go back. While we are dealing with her knee right now, we are also looking forward to next year and updating our list for what we forgot and what we didn't use."
1346717,ole timer,2011-09-04 10:32:00,34,Thanks for the report. We'll be going in 2 weeks. Hope your wife gets along ok.ot
1339924,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-13 09:17:00,1460,"Drew,Is Smoothock channel inflow or outflow? I know that Wabakimi flows into Smoothrock from Lower Wabakimi about 15 miles straight west at what Smoothrock calls Wabakimi Falls. I believe that flow comes into Caribou.OK, twist my arm. These lakers fight you say. I'm in.Do any of you guys know if the bed and breakfast in Armstrong is still open?Is there a camp fish fry? How does that work?Just got email confirmation of my dates this morning. I am officially in!Ole Timer,I hope to meet you at camp on the 27th to get your report firsthand. I would really like to have a cold one with you and yours. Who are you going with? It will just be me and my wife."
1339999,ole timer,2011-08-13 16:14:00,34,"Pikeslayer,I'm new to the lake trout game as well, but I understand they should be shallow that time of year. I'm sure Scott will fill us in. At any rate, I'll have a fishing report and a cold one waiting for you when you get to camp. Just be me and my fishing buddy of 40 years. As far as I know, we'll be in the Wolfs Den cabin.ot"
1340232,drew59,2011-08-14 14:01:00,87,"Caribou flows into Smoothrock. Scott and Mary Jo do a camp fry during the summer months, but it's not our thing so I don't know the details. I'm guessing that as late as you are going it might be iffy, but who knows.Bear in mind that I am a trout novice, not an expert. But the lakers should be shallower when you are there. Long line trolling will be worth trying. I've had some luck with Krocidile spoons which are heavy for their size. The 3/4 oz will go to about 25ft for me.I LOVE talking about this stuff so let me know if you have anymore questions."
1340476,rms0528,2011-08-15 10:00:00,18,"I love to talk about this too, and will be glad to answer questions. It sounds as if Drew and Ole Timer have more experience in during the time you'll be up there, so I'll let them answer more of the specifics. If there's a camp fish fry...Scott and MJ supply the side dishes and do all the cooking. Guests show up with their fish and drinks , sit down either outside on the deck or in the lodge and relax. I personally love this evening during the week. Drew...You've had success long lining to 25' deep? What time of year did you have succes trolling at that depth? You're going to be there a couple weeks after us correct? We're there 8/27-9/3. I'm so new to this trout fishing thing, I hardly feel qualified to suggest anything, but if I may...It might be worth a few dollars to pick up something similar to a dipsy diver to help get your crocodile spoons a little deeper. Depending on the size of the dypsie diver type item, it could help you reach depths closer to 50'. Did anyone notice Scott's new blog posting? Sounds as if there are fires in the area; based on the Ontario government website, nothing extremely close. Just close enough to have smoke if the wind is right maybe. This morning as we were getting ready for work, out of the blue the wife says, ""Guess what. We leave for Canada next week!"". Granted, it's the end of next week so technically she's not wrong. She's never been there, but she's just as excited as I am. LOL."

All this talk of fishin the outlet and now it's on the verge of burning. Weather shows good rains coming.Lets hope this fire gets put out! Scotts' post was interesting. I am completely fired up to here of the famed ""Blue Walleye"" being in this lake. They don't get that big but are very beautiful. Steurgeon are also a plus. Snag on to one of those behemeths and you got your afternoon planned.Scott spoke of named spots on the lake: Beave Green Island, Mary lo's Island, Beer Can, Cactus/Tractor, Narrows in the evening, Whitefish Bay, The Boot, Brockway Creek and Campbell. Got a lot to learn."
1340594,rms0528,2011-08-15 14:51:00,18,"LOL...I'm still learning.Here is what I know so far...Mary Jo's Island is one of the two Islands just out from the camp in the main part of the lake. The Narrows, is the narrows at the north end of the main bay on the way up towards Cove Island. I don't know this for sure, but I think the boot is on the right as you enter the bay on the way up to Smoothrock. Looks like one on the map. Going northeast past ""The Boot"" away from Smoothrock is Brockway Lake and probably Brockway Creek.Never heard of Beave Green Island. Beaver Island is on Google, just northeast of Cove Island. There is a small island off the far tip of Beaver that has fish between the two. I don't remember the others, but I'll find out."

1340657,drew59,2011-08-15 18:25:00,87,"Hey guys,I have to admit the fires have me a little concerned. I'm not interested in fishing in smoke. Been there done that. Hopefully the rain/wind will cooperate. Check this out for a map of the fires. http://forest.lrc.gov.on.ca/AFFM/fir...ap_English.htmI tried the Dipsy Divers a long time ago. I decided that I am going to keep it simple. Jigs and spoons are all I take. If those don't work too bad for me. Last year the trout we caught were still in 50' in mid September, but I'm sure there were fish shallower than that. The trout I have caught trolling have been in June. As far as I know Scott sticks to jigs and long-lining all year so that's good enough for me.I think the small island off Beaver is called Emerald Island. It drops sharply into deep water all along the south side. Last year our best walleye fishing was along the drop in 30-33' anchored and jigging. The narrows are a spring location. No walleyes in the fall. Small pike and that's it."

1339432,rms0528,2011-08-11 13:00:00,18,"Are you looking for a Review or a fishing report?I'll be there 8/27- 9/3, but I'm confident the fishing will be great. This will be my third trip to Forrest Lodge during the week before Labor Day. My first time up we arrived mid afternoon and asked Scott to mark the map to give me few ideas to go catch dinner. (Sandwiches were a backup) We pulled up to the first spot; the wife had three fish in the boat, and I never did get a minnow on my line. I guide for her which means I tie her line, bait her hook, net the fish, take the fish off and rebait. I basically do everything but reel it in, and I've done that when she's been tired of fighting one. I ended up putting a fourth minnow on her rod and told her it was my turn. We took turns catching 50+ 15""-22"" walleyes for the next two hours. Scott and MaryJo are good people. The cabins are nice, very clean. I bring my own boat, but their boats look nice enough. They have power at the dock for battery charging. A GPS comes in handy for following your track back to the main part of the lake. Before I wen the first time I was skeptical about some of the claims I heard about the fishing on the lake in August. After the first week, I was sold on the place, and my second trip up at the same time of year was just as good. The biggest walleye I've caught on the lake was 25, most in the 15-22 range. I've also done well fishing for Lake Trout when taking a break from Walleye fishing. Scott does an excellent job of smoking them while you're there. I've never targeted northern pike, but have caught plenty while fishing for Walleye. Each time I've been up there, I've either witnessed or heard about someone in camp hooking a walleye and having a large northern clamp on for the fight up to the boat. Each time the walleye was in the 15-20 inch range. Hope that helps.Rick"
1339451,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-11 13:55:00,1460,"Thanks Rick, I usually fish 2 lakes over(Wabakimi) in June. Caribou is as close as I can get without a canoe way to lazy for that.I'm looking at last week of Sept up to Oct.1 I'm about ready to set the hook on exact dates yetHow deep were the lakers at labor day? I've never caught one.And despite my name Pikeslayer, I'm mainly a serious walleye guy. I go with the old saying ""You catch more and bigger northerns in the walleye hole!"" I'd just as soon fight um with an ultralight.How far can you go to Smoothrock? Best spots? Keller Island? I can't wait to hear a report of excellent fishing for you and your wife.

1339527,drew59,2011-08-11 19:43:00,87,"Howdy Slayer and RMS,My wife and I are going in 9/9 this year. We were there a week later last year. Bad weather but caught plenty of fish. Forrest Lodge is a FANTASTIC drive-in fishing destination. Scott and Mary Jo know how to run a camp. Just don't try to book ""our"" cabin when we are there. : ) I'll be happy to give you reports. Last year the walleyes were DEEP (30' plus). We're going to go for lakers too.If you are interested, Grand Marais is a great place to stay on the way. You can leave there about 8:00 central time and get to camp about 2:30 eastern time. The Gunflint Tavern is tough to beat. Let me know if you want more info."

The first year I used dipsy divers and caught fish; the second year I bought a portable downrigger for $50, and trolled with both. Based on recommendations from references I spoke to before going the first time, I bought dypsy divers and blue/silver, silver, and blue/red spoons. I'd never fished for lakers before my first trip. Some guys jig for them. The first year I was there one of the guys in camp caught a 25lb trout jigging in 100 fow. Lakers for me are something to do when I want to relax on the water and have a break from walleye fishing. I typically just troll around the big body of water out from the lodge in the afternoon for an hour or two. I love smoked fish and Scott and MaryJo have a great recipe and will smoke them at camp when there is enough fish to fill the smoker. Walleyes were in 26-35 fow the first year I was there and 22-30 fow the second year. White jigs with red hooks tipped with a minnow are the secret for me on this lake. We've used other colors and caught fish, but the white/red has always done the best. My first year up, MaryJo commented that most people struggle a little to find fish their first time on the lake and that I did unusually well for my first time. I give all the credit to the people I spoke to who had been there before and following their advice. I started fishing in 30 fow the first place I went, which I would never normally do. I've typically fished spots around Cove, Beaver, and Saturday Islands. I've gone a few miles past Beaver on the back side of Keller a couple times. The bay accross from Beaver has a few spots too. I'm still learning the lake and looking for new spots each time I go. Scott won't steer you wrong on where to start. Never been to Smoothrock; I'm not even sure it's possible with a boat. I might have to check it out this year if it is. I will definitely give you a report when we get back."
1339617,rms0528,2011-08-12 08:02:00,18,"Oh yea, I almost forgot.Grand Marais is a good destination on the way, or Grand Portage if you can get a room at the casino. We're staying at the Aspen Inn, formerly Super 8, mostly because of price, but there are plenty of other hotels in town. Love to eat dinner at the Angry Trout and/or have a piece of pie at the pie shop at the top of the hill on the way into town."
1339755,Pikeslayer8,2011-08-12 14:20:00,1460,"Hi Drew, Rick and Ole Timer Looks to me on google that Smoothrock is the only substantial inlet to this lake and no outlet. Now, I know you probably can't get all the way into SR but I plan on going as far as I can. I would think later in the fall the walleyes would seek the current of an only inflow into this lake Thanks Rick and Drew for the great info. I really hope your trips are spectacular. Grand Marais and Grand Portage, will look into, thanks.I'm not sure if I will mess with the lakers much. Just thinkin about prying myself off a school of big walleye. No thanks, not unless they are shallow enough.White jigs are a staple in my box. Like a blakemore roadrunner white/white and pink tipped with leech. I found thumper tails were wicked in June.Ole Timer, when are you coming out? I'm arriving 9-27 till 10-1Lets go fishin"
1339812,ole timer,2011-08-12 19:07:00,34,"Pikeslayer8I'll be in from Sept 21-28. Take a closer look on google. It looks to me like the current goes into SR from Caribou. In late fall, that should be even better. Fish right above the rapids. Just my 2 cents.ot"
1339894,drew59,2011-08-13 07:56:00,87,"Hi all,My wife and I walked the portage to Smoothrock in June. The falls are impressive. NO WAY you are getting a boat through there. You could take a canoe.I highly recommend trying for trout. Get some 1 oz jigs and 4-6"" plastics. Find some quiet deep water and watch the depth finder. It's very simple and relaxing and when you hook up look out! Man they fight! Drop your jig to the bottom and then work it up. Trout will chase it higher than you might think. It's not fast action but well worth it my opinion. Also, consider using a no-stretch superline for this type of fishing.I'll be glad to give a full report regarding our trip."
