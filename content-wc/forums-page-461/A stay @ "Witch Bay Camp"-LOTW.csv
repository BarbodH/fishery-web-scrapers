1356541,2Labs,2011-10-10 06:41:00,685,"You hit the nail on the head, Rich B. I'm not an easy mark, either. I expect service and product for my money. The fact that my 33rd and 34th trip to WBC are scheduled for next year speaks for itself. So does the fact that the other camps I went to prior to 1993 did not get my return business.I feel pretty lucky to have found WBC."
1356712,Guest,2011-10-10 19:19:00,0,I looked at WBC but the price was much higher than several resorts on Lac Seul although we've never went American Plan. We make our own meals and save a lot of $$$ while eating VERY WELL. I'm surprised that the resort is staying busy as our last 2 trips the resorts were 1/2 capacity at best because of the economy. Maybe when I retire I can spend more freely and try WBC and see the difference. Thanks for the report.
1351355,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-09-20 16:37:00,629,"Just a short report on what was my 1st stay @ ""Witch Bay Camp""/(9/5 to 8/2011) onwhat I consider the NE corner of LOTW about 23 miles SE of Kenora.The camp is owned by Gail & Steve Hockett. The camp is located @ the extreme end of Andrews & Witch Bay. This was my 1st trip that far North on LOTW. I found the water to be quite different in structure than what I have become very familiar with around the US South Shore & the Miles Bay & Nongashing areas of the lake. In my opinion there is an unlimited # of submerged reefs in that particular area that lend themselves to ""Jigging & Bottom Bouncing with Spinners"" for Walleyes, Perch & Smallmouth Bass. Since ""Longlining/Rapalas"" along shorelines & islands was not an easy task for me because of the extreme changes in depths along mostareas I chose. Both the reefs & ""Longlining"" produced good catches for the 3 days of exploring. The camp supports professional guideswho were not reluctant to share info. with the guests! The food was terrific & was an ""American Plan"" camp. I found the owners to be really friendly & caring about their guests. The camp can hold around 80 people when full. I would guess that there was approx. 40 guests from all over the map. (New York & Texas were the furthest.) Of the 40, I would estimate there were 25 + ""Musky"" hunters in camp.An enjoyable 1st trip & I would recommend it as a consideration for others & I will return in the future. Thank you, Steve & Gail, John Hecklsmiller/Cedar Rapids, Ia. & Baudette, Mn."

1351627,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-09-21 13:18:00,629,"Mn_Moose:I don't understand your post. The entire ""Walleye Central"" site is littered with reports & personnal questions about fishing & resorts."
1355476,reconssd,2011-10-05 14:28:00,147,"Glad to hear that Witch Bay Camp has turned things around. I was there back in 1986, and it was the worst experience I have ever had in Canada. The staff was rude, food average at best, and the boats/motor were below average. I vowed to never go back, and never have. Glad you had a positive experience."
1355506,Bill Krejca,2011-10-05 16:13:00,6107,"Wow, I have never seen a bad report on WB, looks like it has really improved in the 25 years since the above mentioned visit. Thanks for the up-to-date report, John, I wondered if you were still up there. Bill Krejca"
1355761,joeman79,2011-10-06 13:23:00,417,"I have friends who have fished the Witch Bay Camp starting in the mid 80's from Columbia, Mo and they always raved about the service and facilities and boats. They kept going there till the late 90's and age and illness stopped them. But one of the guys that used to go with them goes with our group now and he says Witch Bay is as good or better than anywhere we have gone. I have talked to Gail a few times about booking and she was excellent to work with and very cordial. But its like any business you can't please everyone."
1356262,Hunter4,2011-10-08 16:45:00,65,This camp was and is the best resort I've fished out of on LOTW's. For what I was looking for walleye and musky it was run top notch. I would have no hesitation in sending someone there.
1356360,2Labs,2011-10-09 09:02:00,685,"My wife and I have been going to Witch Bay Camp since 1993. This year I made my 31st and 32nd trip there. While I was still working I could only go once a year, and at first it was just for a week. But we both liked it so much and regretted coming to the end of the week-long stay that in 1997 we expanded each trip to 2 weeks. After I retired I started going there a second trip each year -- 2 weeks each trip ... and after she retired (she is a little younger than me) she joined me on the second trip as well.Been to a couple of places in Canada before we found WBC. After we found it, we never went anyplace else.Like the original poster said ... great fishing, great food, great staff, great owners, and loyal customers. My wife and I have made what are now very close friends there with the owners and customers. There are so many repeat customers that our trips each year become ""annual reunions"". We get weekly e-mails from customers who have been going there longer than we have.I can't say enough good about the camp. We have had engine problems twice with one of our boats during separate trips up -- what a nightmare that engine was!! Each time Steve took our boat into Kenora for us, got us to the head of the line for mechanic's time, got it fixed, brought it back, and gave us a free loaner for the day. One trip up we caught a stone with our windshield (brand new truck -- 2 weeks old ... OUCH!) and it took a divot out of the glass. Steve took my truck into town, got the windshield fixed, and brought it back so we didn't have to miss a day on the water. On another trip up, the brake line on our trailer broke. Gail had one of the dock hands (a former ""Mr. Goodwrench"") fix the problem permanently during his slow time at the docks so we didn't have to miss any fishing. We leave our boat in camp on the trailer loaded with both fishing and cabin gear between our 2 trips. The dock hands have the boat in the water with the battery chargers plugged in, the hull huggers & bumpers all in place, and the cabin gear stowed in the cabin when we roll into camp.We are already booked for 2 trips again for 2012."
1356386,Rich B,2011-10-09 10:15:00,1081,"2 Labs, Thanks for the details on your stays up at WBC.......that is the type of information that is very helpful......sounds like a wonderful camp with great owners that know how to take care of their guests and provide excellent service. Rich B"
1356473,bellbuoy,2011-10-09 18:39:00,490,He means no one posts fishing reports on the Witch Bay website like was done in previous years.
