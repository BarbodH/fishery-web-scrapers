Fishing reports, good or bad, from fellow fisher persons are my favorites...have met a number of really fun people on this website through posts like yours! Sincerely, Doc Lee"
1357009,lund03,2011-10-12 05:42:00,12,"Thanks, Doc Lee, for your words. I, too, really enjoy the posts about a trip just completed. It gives me info for my own use and is valuable information for planning trips. I also enjoyed reliving our trip when I wrote my post."
1357376,wallydave,2011-10-13 07:53:00,2151,"Lund 03, glad to hear that the tips from this site helped in making for a good trip! That is a big part of why this site exists! I'm glad Andrea at Goose Bay was part of your trip, she has been a great person to work with for so many of my trips North, all but one! When her daughter was just an infant, she would put her in a wagon and go for a walk around the camp. One day we were visiting and a member of her staff needed Andrea's help in dealing with a guest. Andrea handed me her infant daughter, like I was just another member of the family! Things like that remind me that I am more than just another source of income, but a person that is trusted! This year about ten years latter, the daughter even went out fishing with our group one evening! Yea we are almost family! No wonder why we keep going back!"
1344770,lund03,2011-08-29 05:53:00,12,A friend and I are leaving for the Perault Falls area next week. We are pulling our own boat and are planning to be gone for 3 weeks. (our trip of a lifetime!). We want to stay mobile and fish anywhere we feel like going. Does anyone know from experience if drive-to camps are full this time of year and if they will work with you on 2 to 4 day stays? We really don't want to lock in a weeks stay in the event that we would like to move on. Any thoughts on this would be helpful.
1344773,NARDA 1,2011-08-29 06:23:00,636,"Take a look at birchdalelodge.com or call Cheryl and Marcel @ 807-227-5262. I am pretty sure they have a cabin available. My group will be there 9/10 - 9/17 and would be happy to show you around. Stays of less than a week shouldn't be a problem, but I think you'll wanr to stay longer!!!!"
1344829,jiggster,2011-08-29 08:15:00,183,Try Anderson's lodge on the English River by Ear Falls. Call Mike Anderson at 866-404-4484. Fantastic fishing.
1344845,JDP,2011-08-29 08:46:00,1457,"Fisherman's Cove has ""Short Stays"" for American and Housekeeping Plans.Ther are on Lac Seul about 5 miles north of Perrault Falls, 13 miles south of Ear Falls.Sounds like a GREAT TRIP!!!!! http://www.lacseulfishermanscove.com/rates.html"
1344914,Steve Ediger,2011-08-29 11:10:00,97,"You might give Lac Seul Lodge a shot. I don't know if Dan has any openings, but if he does I'm sure you would enjoy the stay. You would be easy trailering distance from Perault, Wabaskang, Pakwash, Gullrock, Lakes and the English River. That should be plenty of fishing to last three weeks. Dan's # is (807)222-2102. Wherever you decide to go, Good Luck & enjoy. I wish I were with you. Steve"

1345301,Robert Cardenas,2011-08-30 15:47:00,138,"Check out Bonny Bay Resort. They would probably have a spot for you. They have very nice accomodations. www.bonnybayresort.com on Lake Wabigoon. Awesome fishery-Muskie, Northern, walleye, perch, small mouth bass and even crappie."
1356156,lund03,2011-10-08 06:03:00,12,"Hello everyone, Got home from our ""Trip of a Lifetime"" on Oct 2. It was everything we hoped it would be. We left home on Sept. 7 and arrived at our first destination at Birchdale Lodge on Eagle Lake east of Dryden. We were very impressed with the facilities that Marcel and Cheryl have. They were very helpful each day and showed us numerous spots to fish, all of which yeilded fish. We caught many walleye, lots of northerns of average size, and several 3-4 lb smallmouth. We are not musky fisherman but many people there fished them. It was nice to meet Narda 1 and his group while we were there. Thanks for the rye whisky, Narda, I had a few more after you guys left. After the heat the first 3 days, we had a day of high wind and cold front conditions. We used that day to drive up to Perrault Falls. We visited 3 different camps, and chose Wabaskang Lake Camp run by Jim and Julie. We moved up there on Saturday the 17th. Another great camp. Not many plush accomodations, but it is a fish camp, not a lodge. Facilities were just what we wanted. Great docks and fish cleaning house. Jim was very helpful and had everything needed. We liked Wabaskang because it is a smaller lake, but still large enough that you couldn't fish it all in a week. We soon discovered that It was impossible to fish 2-3 days and move on because of the vast amounts of water. It made more sense to stay in one place longer to learn the best spots. We caught our biggest northern of the trip here at 34"". Again, we caught lots of walleye and several nice smallmouth. Again mid-week had a windy, rainy day and drove up to Ear Falls at Lac suel. Visited several camps and chose Goose Bay Camp south of Ear Falls. Andrea was very helpful, and made us a very good deal on our stay. We were the only ones in camp for the first 5 days until some moose hunters came in. What a fishery Lac suel is! All the posts we read here before our trip were right. Andrea marked lots of spots on her map for us and absolutely every one held fish. The highlight of the trip was a big island point that Andrea said was a pike spot. The second day we went there, only a mile from camp, and decided to troll Buecher Depth Raiders, about 8-9 inches long that were jointed. Caught about 4 average size northerns in 16' of water and were feeling the lure hit the rocks at this depth. Suddenly I had a big fish strike and landed a 25 inch walleye. For the next 3 days we were able to go to this spot and catch 4-6 walleye on this presentation from 21-28 inches each time. Each day we tried jigging for these fish and were not able to get a single bite. Switch back to the depth raider and there they were. Quite an experience. We saw moose, beaver, black bear, otters, and tons of eagles on the trip. We left Goose Bay on Sat. Oct 1 and headed home. A point to be taken, the moose sign stating night danger are to be taken seriously. About 60 miles nort of Fort Francis at 6 AM we saw a huge bull moose on the shoulder. We pulled up right beside him at 10'! We had to look up at his head from the truck. He walked around the front of the truck in the head lights and off into the bush. We got home at 2 PM on Sunday back in southwest Michigan. 2760 total miles driven and many great memories. No flat tires, truck or boat problems the whole trip. If we return, Lac suel will be our water of choice, because of the tremendous amount of water and textbook walleye habitat. A bit of advice, We had a Lowrance HD with the canada chip, and it was worth every penny of the $150. 10 ft contour lines, but was right on with each map we were given plus more. GPS is essential, don't leave home without it! I know this is rather lenghty, but what can I say, It's hard to be brief after a trip like this."
