1355146,wallydave,2011-10-04 14:00:00,2151,"Pikeslayer8, according to thier website, they have been in business since 1958. It is past the AdvetureInn on Kingshwy west. A small quiet place to try to sleep when your dreaming of facing down the tasty walleye! Our room last year had been renovated last winter, very nice and clean, and for the two of us, about $35 per person. We did head down to the AdventureInn for a ""few"" beers, just to relax so we could sleep!? http://www.rainbowmotel.ca/Last June we had a 10 min wait at the border on Friday night, most of the lodging in I Falls looked full of boats and trucks waiting to cross Saturday no thanks! We stopped for dinner in I Falls, but we'll pass on the Saturday wait!"
