Derek and Cassy Becker were their usual self, a blast, and we enjoy them as much as the stay. Made a couple of trips to some Bush lakes and asassinated the frick'n fish!! Had my wife and brother in my little Nadan and released 4 fish over 26in. ,in 4hrs. of fish'n!!! does it get any better than that, Idon't think so!!! Thank you Cassy and Derek for a great time as per usual, Thank You Lord for good friends, good fish'n, and good rye whisky, it's always a PLEASURE!!!!!!"
