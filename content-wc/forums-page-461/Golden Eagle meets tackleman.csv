It was my second trip to Sportsman's that year (was there 3 weeks in May) and I met another group of friends the next morning as we headed to Cobham River Outpost for a week. The bear was bigger than most in the bush and he was still around in early October when I returned. We did everything we could think of to run him off, but he was intent on breaking into our cabin and eating something/somebody. After checking with Don Maw we put him down.I was in cabin #7 and I believe you were in #5. It was pretty late as I was walking to the Lodge and surprised Bruno when rounding the corner of your cabin. I did everything right. Held out my arms and yelled, trying to appear huge and unafraid. Then I talked with you through the window screen of your cabin. You invited me in and I headed, quickly, back to the cabin door. There was Mr. Bear defending his territory in an aggressive manner. My next move was to hit the path, at my top speed, back to #7. It's good to hear from you. This season I spent 15 days at Sportsman's in May, then 9 days on LOTW in early August and back to Sportsman's for 10 1/2 days this fall. Would love being there right now."

WOW that is expensive. thinking about going back this coming summer- Woman River Camp... about half the cost of Sportsman's.... i love Sportsman's but i am financiallly embarrassed. you are kind of a legend there...LOL i have heard a lot of stories about ""the guy from Tennessee who stays for 3 - 4 weeks at a time"" i hope our paths cross sometime soon... but without bears involved. Bob"
1356413,Golden Eagle,2011-10-09 13:23:00,2642,"Norma and I were to leave Sportsman's Lodge early on the 11th day of our stay, but heavy fog held up our flight by about 4 hours. Jim Booi made it from Trout Lake to Little Vermilion in his Cessna 185 for our scenic ride to Red Lake. We left the airways at Chukuni River Bridge, headed down Red Lake Road, crossed Bug River and took the first left onto a dirt road until arriving at a settlement of a few houses on Gull Rock Lake. I was looking for grt1, but saw nobody stirring. Making a cold call, I knocked at the front door of the second house in the neighborhood, expecting to find where grt1 lived. Bill answered the door. We finally met, after exchanging pleasantries on OFC the past few years. Norma talked us into holding still long enough for a quick photo before we headed on down the road to Grand Marais, MN and finally to our home of Cookeville, TN. Bill is wearing his lucky fishing cap and I'm the one with the wind blown hair. Sorry, but I struggled with posting a photo.

1356414,jkwildhunting,2011-10-09 13:36:00,361,Glad to see you got to meet up with the Famous Tackleman!
1356425,Guest,2011-10-09 14:53:00,0,Looks like u did OK with the photo
1356490,Rich B,2011-10-09 19:16:00,1081,"Sounds like you and Norma had a great trip, and topped it off by meeting Tackleman ! Nice of Norma to grab the photo of you guys - good idea to post it on Walleye Central. Rich B"
1356491,Golden Eagle,2011-10-09 19:20:00,2642,Maybe one of these years we'll be back to Dennison and make it up to Dover and say hello to you.
1356719,Skywagon,2011-10-10 19:49:00,1106,"Sounds like you were finally riding in a class unit there Connie, got out of those old Beavers, huh. Did you take the scenic route home (Gran Marais)? You guys are looking good in that picture (hope I never get that old). May will be here again before you know it and you'll be back. Think opener. Still doing my thing in the southlands, 3 days past 9A moose season opener and counting, the goal is to get home before the snow gets too deep. Have a great winter."
1356736,Golden Eagle,2011-10-10 21:21:00,2642,"Yeah Steve, the 185 gave us a beautiful ride to Red Lake. Grand Marais was a let down after our view from 800 feet on the flight back to Red Lake. Unfortunately my camera was stashed in the tail with the light stuff. A lot of corn and beans were being harvested as we came through Illinois Thursday. Pretty dusty. 2 bulls taken by bow hunters on Little Vermilion and 4 more from outpost camps up north by gun hunters. Wind at 20 mph, with gusts to 30 mph probably kept moose safe on Little Vermilion for today's non-resident opener. I miss the place a bunch. We came within a week of staying another few days. I'm at home up there.Having breakfast with Herman Cain Saturday morning."
1356940,Rich B,2011-10-11 19:13:00,1081,"Connie - should you find your way north to Dennison, I'd meet you at the ""Dennison Yard"".....it's one of the best Italian restaurants in this area, and a fun place to enjoy a great meal and cold beverage or two. Rich B"
1356980,Golden Eagle,2011-10-11 21:40:00,2642,"I checked their menu online and it surely sounds inviting, as well as the reviews. Now to start looking for an excuse to head up there."
1357630,Guest,2011-10-14 06:42:00,0,i have been to Sportsman's several times... did you by chance run into our cabin when a bear was in camp... it would have been 5-7 years ago ... i was up with my wife and another couple...
