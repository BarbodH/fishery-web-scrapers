1485361,MidWestFishman,2012-09-11 10:57:00,44,just returned 2 days ago from the last week of fishing this year at Hawk Lake. A couple days of rainy weather but the rest of time was really nice The lodge was full and fishing was great with some particularly good fishing on the portage lakes. The small mouth were incredibly fat and many trophies caught. It seemed everyone was getting numbers and quality. As usual Ted and his staff went overboard to take care of everyone and the food was out of this world! The new boats with 50 hp motors were really nice. I would recommend Hawk Lake to anyone who loves small mouth fishing.
