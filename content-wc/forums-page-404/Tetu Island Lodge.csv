1484024,FDL rad,2012-09-07 07:42:00,1,We are planning a special trip for June 2013. Does anyone have any experience with Tetu Island Lodge in Ontario? We have been to Halley's Kettle Falls nearby. Any comments would be most helpful. Price is steep and don't mind paying it if the experience is extra special.
