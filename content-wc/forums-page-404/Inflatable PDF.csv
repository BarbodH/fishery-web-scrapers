1482895,Campcountry,2012-09-04 16:20:00,164,You can't bring the CO2 on a commercial airliner because of the risk of it exploding. I don't know about on float planes.

1482090,JayM5209,2012-09-02 08:43:00,1050,Here's the info from Transport Canada re: inflatable PFDs. Scroll down the page about 2/3 of the way to find the discussion of inflatables.http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...ing_appliances
1482214,lcwhit,2012-09-02 14:11:00,104,"you can only bring them in packed in paper, no wait a minute. that's something else. sorry, i had a clint eastwood moment there. i love that guy."
1482281,dmb130,2012-09-02 19:39:00,21,"One thing to remember is that you must be wearing the inflatable for it to count as a PFD unlike a life jacket that you just have to have in the boat. If you aren't wearing it, it dosen't count."
1482289,Guest,2012-09-02 20:10:00,0,So what are you saying?It's a good thing that there is more than one jerk hangin around WC;-)
1482290,Guest,2012-09-02 20:11:00,0,That's a really good point. Are you able to share a reference for that line of thinking?
1482310,JayM5209,2012-09-02 21:07:00,1050,"From the info at the link referenced earlier - - - ""You can also buy inflatable PFDs, but you must understand how to use and care for them if they are to work properly. You must also understand which activities and conditions they are approved for. Above all, remember that you have to be wearing an inflatable PFD for it to be approved on an open boat. If the boat is not open then you only need to wear it while you're on deck or in the cockpit. Inflatable PFDs are NOT approved for: anyone under 16 years old;anyone who weighs less than 36.3 kg (80 lbs);on a personal watercraft; orfor white-water paddling activities. Inflatable PFDs come in the following two styles: vest types that can be inflated orally, manually (with a CO2 system) or automatically; andpouch types that can be orally inflated or manually inflated by pulling a toggle to activate a CO2 inflation system. Although these PFDs inflate quickly, for weak swimmers it can seem like it takes forever. All Canadian-approved inflatable PFDs have an oral inflation tube in case the CO2 inflation system fails. This tube could be hard to use when you are trying to keep your head above water. An emergency is no time to try out a new device. Inflatable PFDs should come with an owner's manual. Look for it and read it carefully. Try the PFD on under supervision and before heading out to make sure you know how to use it.""From Transport Canada."
1482337,dmb130,2012-09-03 05:24:00,21,"This is the reference from the T.C. regulations listed above "" Above all, remember that you have to be wearing an inflatable PFD for it to be approved on an open boat.

1482388,fishincrazy,2012-09-03 08:22:00,1282,"Yes That is exactly what I was saying,at least I am man enough to post under my handle and not hide behind the guest handle.If you think my post was jerk like then slap me and call me names but do it like a man from your real handle.That I would respect this not so much.FC"
1482725,NathanH,2012-09-04 07:59:00,697,I know some auto inflates can be turned to manuel IE you need to pull the string. Issue with having an auto on all the time is your in a heavy rain the sensor gets wet and guess what... Pop it inflates pretty funny if you see it happen to somone. That being said most days it would be a good idea I would guess if you fell out of a boat and couldnt make it back you might have hit your head ect and somone who is not awake annot pull the tab to inflate.
1481396,stevensinks,2012-08-30 20:48:00,330,We just lost a guy here this week who fell out of the boat with out a PDF. I have decided that it is time to get a Pdf that will be on me rather than me sitting on it. Can I use Inflatable PDF's in Canada. It seems that I read on here someplace that we could not take CO2 into Canada. But if I did I cant find it now. So I wanted to check. I also wanted to ask which ones you think are best.
1481435,Catman59,2012-08-31 04:27:00,345,"Ive used inflatable PDFs in Canada for as many years as I can remember . Never heard of a rule about not bringing C02. I bring spare re-arms along in the boat too. i have this model from Bass Pro http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shop...SELL_THUMBNAIL I also have a couple inflatable belts that we take to portage lakes that I just wear on the hike , like these http://www.basspro.com/Onyx-Manual-I...duct/10207499/ . I have tested the belt and it supports my 250lb body just fineand its very comfortable. Just my >$.02"
1481456,MorganMan,2012-08-31 06:17:00,341,"Wow, it's something we all know COULD happen, but never think it will. We have had fellas fall out of boat too, but never with those consequences. Very sorry to hear about loss. We are in the middle of that same conversation about pfd's right now as we get ready to leave. One of us has the inflatable, but have been told he shouldn't be bringing it too?? We will follow this post if he hasn't found out for sure already. Hawkfan, what do you know?"
1481484,zeebee,2012-08-31 07:14:00,1144,"""It seems that I read on here someplace that we could not take CO2 into Canada. But if I did I cant find it now. So I wanted to check.

1481725,Hawkfan,2012-08-31 18:49:00,237,"Lol...that's funny stuff. I never heard it wasn't legal to bring, just that it may not satisfy the requirement for life vest in the boat per MNR regulations."
1481831,Jimmy Jig,2012-09-01 07:54:00,1905,Game wardens in Canada wear inflatables all the time in the boat................
1481864,stevensinks,2012-09-01 10:18:00,330,"OK Thanks for the info. I think Im going to order 2 this weekend. The ones that I was going to get Bass Pro has on sale but when I tried to order them they were out. Do you think that the ""Auto Inflate"" is worth the extra money?"
1481899,waterwick,2012-09-01 12:31:00,32,"I use the HIT auto inflate models. They will only inflate when covered with 4"" or more of water. Other models have inflated when heavy spray hits you or in a good downpour causing you to use your recharge kit.....which costs a fair bit. If you happen to hit your head when falling out of the boat or are incapacitated in some way and cant pull the cord auto inflate will save you.Last weekend at Lac Des Mille Lacs while taking the wife to shore for a pee she fell off the bow while trying to balance on a rock. She was in so much of a hurry that she didnt notice her foot was caught on the anchor rope and lost her balance and fell into 8"" of water back first. She was up and on her feet very fast and the vest did not inflate. She was only wet on the backside and fortunately didnt bang her head on a rock. Some funny things do happen in the wilderness.If you do fall out of a boat in deeper water and happen to gulp some water and cant breath and then panic if will definately go off automatically.Worth the extra money............I think so."
1481932,fishincrazy,2012-09-01 16:20:00,1282,Don't mean to be a jerk but isn't it a PFD??????A PDF is a computer file.On another note I know a ton of guy's who wear these especially the jetty fisherman I know.You fall off a jetty and hit your head the auto inflate saves your life.FC
1481966,epiepenburg,2012-09-01 18:42:00,365,I wanted to say the same thing....
