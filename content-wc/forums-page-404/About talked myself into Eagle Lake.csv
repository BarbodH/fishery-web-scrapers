1484411,NARDA 1,2012-09-08 07:40:00,636,A guide is not needed on Eagle but it can sure cut down on time searching for HOT spots especially if you are only going for a few days. +1 for Greg as a guide www.eagleeyeguiding.com
1484426,farmnfish,2012-09-08 08:34:00,130,Thanks for the responses.
1484086,farmnfish,2012-09-07 10:14:00,130,"For a trip next year. It looks like a good compromise of fishing, driving time and having some other stuff for the kids and wives to do with town not to far away. I've read many of the threads here with raves about the different lodges and the great fishing, especially all the different species. But then I come across post of people complaining about it having terrible fishing, if you've never fished there you'll need a guide.Been to numerous lakes in Ontario, though not as big as Eagle, and have never needed a guide. A new lake can take a few days to figure out where the fish are sure, that is expected and part of the fun, but I'm not sure if I tell the guys I want to go to a lake where they'll need a guide to catch anything it will go over very well. Hope this doesn't come off sounding negative in anyway, but what is the real deal on eagle, can a group of experienced anglers that are not afraid to ask allot of questions expect to catch fish on Eagle or will they need a guide to find the buggers? Thanks for your time."
1484097,Aaron-IN,2012-09-07 10:50:00,500,I know this reply is useless to you but if I needed a guide in order to catch fish in Ontario I'd probably just stay home.
1484136,Fonzie,2012-09-07 11:45:00,85,"I've only fished the lake twice in my life, so my opinion is just that...The first time we were there, a huge storm system hovered over us the whole trip with winds that were howling most of the time {usually from the East}. We could barely leave the mouth of Eagle River. We still scratched out enough fish to keep us happy.The second trip worked out much better in terms of the weather and fishing.No real trophy sized fish, but we had our ""chances""...I'm more of an ""enjoy nature and hope the fish are biting"" kind of guy. Consistant action is more important to me than size.There is so much structure in the lake that there is no reason that you cant catch fish. {I get the feeling you know what you're doing, probably more so than me lol}.Now if you wanted that trophy musky, I would definately hire a guide for a day.I'm leaving for Eagle Lake in a week or so and have never fished the lake this late in the year. I plan on using some midwestern bass tactics up there. Hopefully by using techniques that the fish don't see every day, I'll catch more fish. I don't want to throw the same ol' same ol' lures that the fish see every day..http://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h192/2Chanita/008.jpghttp://i64.photobucket.com/albums/h192/2Chanita/004.jpg."
1484148,v-bay gord,2012-09-07 12:05:00,3168,"Guides can be helpful but are not necessary.....in fact, many times they (some, not all) overlook the closer spots that can be just as productive. Some sections of Eagle have navigational hazards (reefs) that may warrant the help of a guide. Some folk enjoy a trip more with a guide everyday, but it's a choice based on preference, available cash, and fishing experience.....not so much a neccessity."
1484193,island troller,2012-09-07 14:05:00,1,"A group of 4 of us, all experience fisherman went last year for the first time. With all the humps, weedbeds and islands we found it very enjoyable searching out good fishing spots on our own. Being an experience fisherman I would not hesitate to go on your own on Eagle Lake if you enjoy that more. We did a lot of Musky fishing but were very surprise at all the Musky fishing pressure at Eagle Lake. It was rare to not see a boat casting at Musky Point each day. We joked that you needed make a reservation in order to fish there. Its a beautiful lake and I would go back again."
1484198,Steve of Madison,2012-09-07 14:10:00,230,"MAN! Do you want to catch the ire of those guides trolling this site!!!Besides, if the guy wants to hire a guide, it's good for the local economy, and goodness knows we need that.But hiring a guide also informs the observant guideee about travel routes, techniques, boating and often at least 1 good shore lunch for the group."
1484218,v-bay gord,2012-09-07 14:51:00,3168,If you are staying in the Vermilion Bay area of Eagle Lake and needed to hire a guide I can highly recommend Greg at Eagle Eye Guiding.... www.eagleeyeguiding.com His boat is nice and his rates are very reasonable....and of course he is a good guide.......also not afraid to show you spots close to where you might be staying.
1484296,tackleman,2012-09-07 17:43:00,444,"i've fished eagle for 20 years and i'm still not to proud to ask someone for new spots to go and try.thanks vbay gord, i did get fish on those spots you marked"
1484298,v-bay gord,2012-09-07 17:57:00,3168,Your welcome Tackleman.....keep those under your hat.
1484314,Skywagon,2012-09-07 19:00:00,1106,"I live on a large lake system in the area, but fished Eagle on the opener this year, if that tells you anything. I don't fish it a lot, but consider it to be one of the top choices of the larger lakes in the area, up there with Lac Seul and the Red Lake area. Guide or not is up to the individual, not necessary, but for a first timer you would be bound to pick up a good pointer or two, maybe saving a few of those vacation days catching fish rather than trying to figure out where they may be at the time (I would feel that way about any large lake, not just Eagle if time was a consideration). What ever you decide, Eagle is a beautiful lake, the town of Vermillion Bay and Dryden are not too far away and there are a few places for the family to visit if they choose. Have a good time."
