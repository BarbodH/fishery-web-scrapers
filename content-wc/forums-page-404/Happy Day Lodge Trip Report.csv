It truly gave us a fly-in experience without the cost and hassle of a plane. The scenery and solitude were top notch and the fishing was solid. Windermere is a beautiful lake with lots and lots of healthy walleye. Catching them though can be tricky. There is a ton of fantastic walleye habitat in the lake, but finding it and staying on it requires excellent boat control, a good map, good electronics, and good technical fishing skills. If you can combine all that, catching 50 walleye a day shouldn't be a problem. Most of them will be schooling fish of medium size. Finding the trophy fish will be harder. I'm sure they are in there, but its like finding a needle in a haystack. They won't be in the big schools, which means you'll have to fish areas that feel dead and hope a big one is lurking around somewhere. However, we aren't walleye fishermen, and barely wet a jig. We like to cast lures and troll, which worked just fine for catching smallies, pike, and a decent amount of walleye. A lot of people say that in late summer you have to fish deep main lake structure. Well, apparently the fish don't know that. We caught most of our fish out of 10 feet of water or less. Bays, weed beds, sunken boulders, shorelines, islands all produced fish. We also spent a few days hiking back into the bush lakes. That was a really fun experience and those lakes also have good fishing. If you are planning a trip to Happy Day, shoot me a PM and I'd be happy to answer any questions."
1483159,adempsey,2012-09-05 08:17:00,963,Nice Smallies! Thanks for the report. How were the accommodations at the outpost? Haven't read any first hand accounts about it.
1483181,MrSimon,2012-09-05 08:42:00,922,"The outpost was very nice. It has a propane stove and fridge that are older, but work fine. There are three or four light bulbs that run off batteries charged via a small solar panel. The lights do a fine job of lighting the cabin after dark. There is a small shower house with an elevated tank and propane hot water heater. Not a lot of water pressure, but a hot shower is always nice.No running water. There is a well out front with a hand pump that pumps clean cold water. We drank it with no problems.Outhouse is clean and not to far from the cabin.Nice docks to tie up your boats. Nice fire ring and picnic table. Plenty of benches and chairs to sit on.There are two bunk areas separated from the rest of the cabin by curtains. There is a total of four sets of bunks allowing for 8 adults. There is an old couch and chair in the cabin as well as a big picnic table to eat at. There is a decent selection of pots, pans, plates, silverware, etc. Definitely not fancy, but its about as nice as an outpost can be."

I'm the guy that met you as you were leaving (there with my family in cabin 4) was wondering if I might see a report pop up somewhere from your bunch.I notice you guys didn't include ""the underwear shot""For our area of the lake we did much better on the walleye than pike or bass, however, I did get a nice 17"" smallmouth."

1483400,MrSimon,2012-09-05 14:46:00,922,What? You don't have fishing pants with an open fly? It allows you to take a leak one-handed so you can keep jigging.
1483560,Rich B,2012-09-05 20:36:00,1081,"Thanks for posting on your trip up to the ""Outpost"" at Happy Day Lodge. I've been up to the camp on 3 occasions and had a great week every time, though the last trip I took my rig up to the outpost to check it out on the last day. You're correct in that there are a lot of good size fish in that lake, though tough to trigger most days (perhaps there's a good night bite - that's what I suspect). The bays down by the Outpost held good size fish, though we couldn't trigger any that day we ran down to check it out. Glad you had a good week.....and I'm sure you'll be back to give those big girls another go round ! Rich"
