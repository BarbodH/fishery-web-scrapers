I will admit by the end of the week a smell can be created, but not overpowering that ruins a trip. We always toss in the stuff they have on the shelf in the bathroom, it helps. We have never over flowed. The boat is designed to hold 12 guys, so the holding tank should not be a problem."
1482753,joeman79,2012-09-04 10:21:00,417,Group decided that they wanted a change of scenery in 2013 so we are looking at a HouseBoat on LOTW out of Sioux Narrows. Any tips or comments on the area or HouseBoat trips on LOTW would be appreciated. We will be going the first week in August. Some of the guys are Muskie Nutz in the group so they are excited. Thanks and good luck to all you guys taking Fall Trips. We started Dove Hunting on the first and its been great. Keeps our minds off Canada as you can see.

I would HIGHLY reccomend ""Tomahawk"".. great resort, great owners, great prices, better than great equipment. Oh, yeah, really good fishing!"
1482855,chevtow,2012-09-04 14:34:00,691,"We always stay at Laughing waters campground / LOTW Houseboats. Always enjoy it, never used the houseboats but have seen them. They have about 7-8 of them, and a few different sizes. www.lowhouseboats.com Dan and Noreen run the place, tell em Russ Tilot sent you."
1483021,joeman79,2012-09-04 21:09:00,417,Went with Sioux Narrows Floating Lodges they have a boat big enough for our group of 12. Can't wait till next summer.
1483088,downriverbob,2012-09-05 06:18:00,880,"When talking to the people renting the houseboats ask if the have some mapping/GPS feature on their boats. If you go out into Whitefish Bay or any other of the bays in the area you will find literally tons of reefs and reef stuctures. These reefs sometimes are coming out of very deep water and out of areas that you don't expect. A map of the area would be good but will not show you where you are in relation to the reefs. The area is very beautiful and great fishing, but can be tricky to navigate a fishing boat let alone a large house boat. BOB"

1483144,wallydave,2012-09-05 07:58:00,2151,I like their webcam! Its cool to be able to watch the seasonal changes! Gives a report of your trip! Have a good one!
1483153,joeman79,2012-09-05 08:10:00,417,"All boats are equipped with GPS they said and have the safe routes to many different anchorages. I think we will have a blast, might be awfully close quarters for 12 guys but its a double decker so should be ok. We got the idea of trying a houseboat from fishing Lac Seul and seeing those boats tied up 5 minutes from the good fishing, while we had just spent 45 minutes to an hour getting there from camp. All the time thinking how much more fishing time we could have along with a fuel savings from running boats 30 miles one way every day for a week. IT WILL BE INTERESTING!!!"
1483190,Knutson21,2012-09-05 08:53:00,348,"Our group has been renting the 60' House Boat from Floating Lodges for the last 20 years. Its is a great boat and fits 12 guys with no problem. There are (12) Full Size Beds plus (2) Futons on the boat. I highly recommend the trip to a group of guys that get along and are willing to pitch in. The trip is awesome, but you do have to work as a team. Between parking a boat that size and coordinating tying up 6 boats behind to tow it is work. We usually designate guys to different chores. Cooks, cleaners, fish cleaners, etc. It works out great. With 12 guys the cost comes out to $850 Each up from $650.00 Each the first year I went in 1994. This does not include trasportation to and from Canada. We have guys come from many different locations, so we leave that out of the cost and each guy is on their own. I think a $10 average increase per year is not bad. Most of that increase has been due to gas prices."
1483274,jimirjr,2012-09-05 10:58:00,1149,"How many bathrooms were there? How big was the holding tank? 12 Guys is quite a load... or loads, if you catch my drift.."
