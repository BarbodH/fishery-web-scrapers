This was our second consecutive year on Lake Windermere, and, it definitely pays to build on what you learn in the lake. We found fish in many more spots this year, by using patterns that were successful last year.The Zimmerman's are great hosts, and, are very passionate about the lake. With the relatively new keeper slots they have implemented the trophy potential of these waters will hopefully be realised. In the meantime there are plenty of decent fish to keep you busy while searching for those lunkers.Below is a link to my report on another boardhttp://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...pic=65243&st=0Cheers,Frank"
1483280,Golden Eagle,2012-09-05 11:04:00,2642,"Yep, I read it. Nice report."
1483298,MrSimon,2012-09-05 11:32:00,922,"I want to echo what Frankie said about the size limits. You can't keep ANY pike over 26"", walleye over 18"" or bass over 15"". Those are some pretty strict limits, but the results over the next few years will be fantastic. I couldn't be happier to see a lodge implement these kinds of restrictions. We never really targeted walleye, but still caught maybe half a dozen over 18""."
1483357,BornToFish,2012-09-05 13:19:00,1224,"The lodge that I fish at implemented ""slots"" about ten years ago. For example, walleyes over 18 inches were to be returned to the lake unharmed, unless they went to the taxidermist. I readily admit that it hurt the first year or two to return ""slot"" walleyes as we had to fish mighty hard to catch them. Now, my wife and I just return these ""slot"" fish to the lake and promptly focus on catching another one. The quality and quantity of the fish in this lake has improved steadily since the lodges on this lake put the ""slot"" rules into effect. Some first-time guests complain when they learn about the ""slot"", but they seem to get over it when they think about it for a little while. We are absolutely content with under-the-slot walleyes for our meals and take-home. Returning in-the-slot fish to the lake makes sense to us and feels mightly fine."
1483369,Frankie65,2012-09-05 13:34:00,9,"Good to hear!!!!!! We have no interest in keeping the larger fish, so, the mandatory release of larger fish doesn't bother us at all. The best eaters, for when you do want a meal, are the 14-17""ers anyways."
1483486,RickOnt,2012-09-05 18:12:00,217,"Great report, Frankie, Your 'Boys' will remember these trips forever!Some fantastic memories.Thanks for taking the time to postRick"
1483556,Rich B,2012-09-05 20:32:00,1081,"Frankie, I was up at Happy Day Lodge on 3 different occasions, and enjoyed each trip. The road back to the lodge wasn't the best but going slow was OK (I towed in my rig). It's a beautiful lake, and you basically have it to yourself most days. Glad you and your family had a great week.......thanks for sharing with us. Rich"
1483619,Frankie65,2012-09-06 05:47:00,9,"Thanks, Rich! We also tow our boat in when we go there. I found the road slightly more rough this year, but, not too bad for towing my little 14 fter.It truly is a beautiful lake. We are making two trips up next year, the first in mid July (just Juli and myself) the second in that last week of August, again, with the kids. I almost had a fly in booked for myself and Juli next year, but, it would have meant scrapping the family trip. This way for about the same price we can do both. Hopefully the budget allows the fly in, plus a family getaway at Happy Day, option in the near future."
