1467201,Mike Borger,2012-07-27 21:03:00,1554,"HAHA! When it comes to northern ON rivers with brookies in them I've fished a lot.Forgot to mention, another obvious choice you may want to check out is Esnagami lodge just north of Nakina.Great lodge on a big lake with very good walleye and pike fishing.Brook trout fishing in the Esnagami river flowing out of the lake can be quite good, but you'll require a guide for the day."
1467449,Gulper,2012-07-28 15:18:00,6,"Leuenberger's Kag lake, Washi lake, or Kellow lake. Some have been mentioned already. Have done well at all of these. Brook trout are a blast to catch. Well worth any effort."
1468355,rocko0305,2012-07-30 21:44:00,138,"Thanks everyone for the good info. We are looking pretty seriously into Dusey Lake or Teabeau Lake at this time, depending on how many guys from our current group going to Beteau in May 2013 want to commit. Dusey can accommodate 10, while Teabeau only 8. Anyone here been to Teabeau and would like to share your experience? Also considering Kellow and Kayedon out of Leuenberger's as well. I have seen several people post that brook trout can be found downriver at Kayedon, however I am told by the outfitter this is not the case. Can anyone confirm trout being found in the river exiting the lake at Kayedon?Also, a separate question, what would be the best time of year to target trout? Our group won't have a problem finding the walleye or pike."
1468387,Mike Borger,2012-07-31 03:54:00,1554,Time-wise on those rivers late May to mid June is prime time. Can't remember now if I'd mentioned Washi upstream from Teabeau.A friend fished this camp in late May and did great with the brookies.There's a lot of water to cover there.
1485148,pike50plus,2012-09-10 18:57:00,584,A Plethora of quality fishing information!
1467040,rocko0305,2012-07-27 12:47:00,138,"I know a little about Dusey Lake from some postings on WC and OFC, but what other outposts are options in Northern Ontario for chances to catch walleye, big pike and brook trout? Here are our group's qualifications for a place:Preferably fly out of Nakina, but not an absolute necessityPrefer to be the only outpost on the lake/river, although 1 other outpost would be okayMust be able to accommodate at least 8 guysPrice needs to be under $1,500 for a 7 day tripCan't wait to hear the suggestions from you guys. Thanks."
1467044,phishfearme,2012-07-27 12:56:00,1242,i haven't been there but i looked seriously into keezik lake with northern outposts out of nakina a number of years ago. it has almost exactly what you're looking for including price. take a look. phish
1467057,tooski,2012-07-27 13:15:00,393,I don't think Northern Outposts flies out of Nakina. Armstrong maybe? Have heard Keezhik is very good either way.
1467088,phishfearme,2012-07-27 14:16:00,1242,joe's right - they're out of armstrong not nakina - a bit longer drive from michigan but shorter from minn.. that's the second time joe's properly corrected me. i gonna have to read his posts more closely to try to even things up! northern outposts used to have a half dozen outpost camps but not they only have keezik. maybe they're phasing out of the business. ryan and kathy are good outfitters - i hope they stay in the business. phish
1467096,mb386,2012-07-27 14:32:00,14,Excuse my ignorance but what is OFC?
1467099,tooski,2012-07-27 14:39:00,393,"Well Bob I was wrong once with you and I had to wear a Steelers Jersey for 24 hours in Canada. My skin still itches. I think they sold a couple of their outposts to Eddie, right? Windsor was one. I'd be surprised if they stayed in business with just one fly-in. Possibly they are looking to pick up a couple lakes in NW Ontario? Hopefully... I always hate to see a good outfitter close up. Heading to Larus Lake in 10 days Phish. Maybe I'll take my Polywogamalu jersey with me...."

1467134,Mike Borger,2012-07-27 16:49:00,1554,"I've fished most of those.I paddled up Keezhik creek from the Albany river when I was paddling it. Definitely good speck fishing, but I really don't know how you'd fish it successfully staying at an outpost on Keezhik lake.I have also fished the small creek that runs out of Shabuskwia...don't waster your time.I have also fished the Attwood river that runs through Peninsular, in fact I've paddled the entire thing. Decent brookies, but tons of effort required. You're not going to do that well fishing upstream and down from peninsular. If you do push the boundaries you'll be doing some serious bushwhacking.Troutfly again is quite good, but exactly how you'd fish it from an outpost on troutfly lake I don't know. Again I ascended this river when I paddled the Albany.Kaganagiami has okay brookie fishing in the Opichuan river...but again you're looking at some serious effort and bushwhacking involved to reach it from the lodge.Dusey I can vouch for, it has easily accessable trout fishing both upstream and down from camp.Some of the camps on the Albany are good, although mainly in late May and early June. Once the water starts to warm they head to spring holes and can be difficult to find.The Washi lake outpost run by Leuenbergers is good.Also good is the Teabeau lake outpost run by 7 Lakes out of Nakina (same operation that has the Dusey camp). It's just above Kagiani falls which is a very good spot.Cheers"
