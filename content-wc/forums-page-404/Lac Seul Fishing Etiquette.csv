1482815,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-04 12:47:00,9,"I have been guiding american clients on Lac Seul and other bodies of water in NW Ontario for 20 years. It ceases to amaze me how much water there is out there to fish and how when you start catching fish how fast other boats move in on you. Yes there have been times where i have voiced my displeasure with the culprits, but for the most part I tell my guests that we are moving. I realize that I don't own the lake, but come on. The respect factor that everyone is talking about is indeed non existant. People come up to Canada to get away from the crowds and enjoy a peaceful day on the water without having to compete for a fishing spot with 10 other boats. There are so many fishing spots that have not even been dicovered. I can go down the lake on any given day and tell you where all the boats are going to be fishing. Just don't get it. Happy hooking"
1482824,Mike Kansas,2012-09-04 13:05:00,1463,Where do you Guide out of.
1482843,MOOSEMEAT,2012-09-04 14:06:00,9,Evergreen Lodge out of Ear Falls.
1482994,Hawkfan,2012-09-04 20:11:00,237,I also can't say I speak from experience as you have. This year will be only my second on Lac Seul. Previous years were all outpost fishing where you wouldn't see another boat all week. And last year we were late enough in the year we barely saw anyone on LS. I'm sure it would be frustrating though. Hope we don't have to find out...leaving in two days!
1483018,Shotgun,2012-09-04 21:04:00,759,"Hawkfan, this was my first year fishing Lac Seul. However, 30+ years fishing numerous Canadian and US lakes/rivers/reservoirs. Just never experienced this type of poor fishing etiquette as LS produced. Not that we can't handle it, just don't need the frustration when we're out to enjoy ourselves. And as mentioned on multiple previous posts by others, I go to Canada to get away from others and see the outback not be hassled by others. Good luck on LS.PS. have a daughter that lives in Urbandale. Does anyone fish Saylorville for Walleye?"
1483066,teddi,2012-09-05 03:37:00,349,"I didn,t think Evergreen had a regular guide."
1483581,Hawkfan,2012-09-05 21:34:00,237,Not a whole lot of boats for walleye on Saylorville. I think more people get out on Big Creek which is on the NW side of Polk City.
1483917,Guest,2012-09-06 20:25:00,0,"It is apparent that you and I disagree as well as the possibility that you would shoot at a passing boat that you ""deemed"" to be to close.

Park in the middle of the road and figure you WILL be bothered by other boats. Like many other posts have stated that slower speeds kick up a larger wake. My boat @ slow speeds WILL kick up a larger wake. Slowing to idle is only a option if there isn't safe passage distance by other boats. Can only recall of 1-2 times that Steamboat was clogged with boats and had to idle by. Really are those spots that great for catching fish? the 4-5 times I've stopped and Shanty or Steamboat Narrows the fishing is poor at best. There are much better locations out of the way than those spots. It's sad people can't locate better locations to catch fish than in the main boating lane! Maybe you could recommend other SAFE boating routes around you and your boat?"

1482092,wallydave,2012-09-02 08:44:00,2151,"I guess I should have included that knowing its illegal to block the channel, I won't drop my anchor there anymore. Lac Seul is a big lake with plenty of places to fish. The NW section does see plenty of traffic quite a few boats trying to fish the same spots. The speed used in passing other boats will depend on the channel and space available. The high traffic rate is just one more reason why I am looking for other options in Ontario!"
1482131,Skiball,2012-09-02 10:37:00,82,"We've been going up since the mid 90's and we stay on the SE end and the traffic is not as bad as you all have described but the etiquette of the fisherman is just as bad. We've even had problems with the guides. They will do anything it takes. When we drift a bridge and see boats passing through, we use the troller to move off to the side and let them pass and sometimes they just try and pull into our spot or race through under the bridge at 20-25.Just another day at the office. Lac Seul is big enough for veryone.......find your own spots and enjoy the experience as we have done.Good Fishing."
1482162,Shotgun,2012-09-02 12:14:00,759,"I started this thread seven pages ago. I believe this illustrates how fishing etiquette impacts our sport. With all of us promoting improvements, illustrating the common courtesy approach which includes the lodge owners/guides and walking the talk, just maybe we can impact the situation somewhat. It's sad that in my life time I have definately seen a move toward this is a ""me world"" and the he** with you. You even see this same approach and attitude by individuals when driving. Just by reading this thread we have different thoughts, i.e., passing a setting boat up on plane to create a smaller wake vs. slowing down. Please keep this thought in mind. A danger forseen is half avoided."
1482174,AllenW,2012-09-02 12:49:00,11482,"Might be some vagueness on what size channel we're dealing with maybe? Small enough that your anchoring in it blocks traffic, no good. 100 yard river and you go by someone on plane and keep a decent distance, there should be no problem, you buzz them and they can see the color of your eyes, not good. The common sense thing should work, unfortunately not everyone has the same thoughts on that. Al"
1482326,Jesse-WI,2012-09-02 23:35:00,534,"I once had a more experienced boater describe etiquette this way to me. While there are certainly well defined rules of the road on water in some situations, the rules are a bit a bit vague in some areas. The key is every boater is responsible for their actions and two wrongs NEVER equal a right. The concept of etiquette is regardless of what someone else is doing you should never do anything that puts anyone else at risk. The speed you can pass varies based on the space available, the boats involved, how well the other boats can handle your wake, etc. You add in the factor that most drownings (90%) come on clear calm sunny days, you must remember the element of water adds always adds additional danger."
1482342,v-bay gord,2012-09-03 05:51:00,3168,"Very well said. Slowing down to travel through an area (with no wake) seems really inconvenient, but really no one should be in that much of a rush. Take the time to be safe........."
1482373,Hawkfan,2012-09-03 07:58:00,237,"Another thing I take away from this thread is that, just like about everything else in life, not everyone has the same opinion on what is the best way to do something. Depending on how far away you are traveling from another boat, whether it is best to stay full throtle and stay on plane, or slow way down have no wake at all, seems to get a different response depending on who you ask. Maybe what we need to remember is that 99% of the boats out there are the same as you and are just trying to do what they think best. And as far as fishing in close proximity, obviously a person that comes and fishes close to your boat doesn't have a problem sharing a spot, maybe they don't think you do either. I guess I would do what some others would do if they were too close and just work my way out of there. But it seems like there are a lot of grumpy fisherpeople out there that think everyone else is out to ruin their day. My guess is each boat out there is full of people all trying to enjoy the outdoors and we should give them the benefit of the doubt in these situations."
1482470,SinOrSwim,2012-09-03 11:07:00,1528,"Also, there may be rules but sometimes common sense should trump the rules. For instance, I have a 58' houseboat. When I am on the lake I will defer to a sailboat even if I have the right away because they are using the wind and it is much more difficult to change direction. The same as ""most"" smaller boats defer to me, especially when in close quarters inside the marina, because they obviously have more control than I do. The wind etc does not affect them like it does me.Point being, even if the rules state 50 or 100 ft, sometimes it's better to slow down until you get past someone and then go on. Not like an extra couple minutes is going to change the outcome of your day."
1482475,Skiball,2012-09-03 11:22:00,82,"Let's be totally frank...............Lac Seul is apporx 500,000 acres of water and countless islands and over 220 miles of shoreline. If you can't stake your own claim and find the walleye, then you should be fishing your pond at home and not in NW Ontario where the big boys play and the walleye are plentiful.........................DONT INVADE ANOTHER BOATS SPACE.....................................FIND YOUR OWN WATER."
1482653,Hawkfan,2012-09-03 20:53:00,237,"LOL. Have to assume that is a response to me. My only response is go grab a Xanax. I never suggested it is ok to pull up next to someone, just that maybe we shouldn't assume our fellow fishermen have bad intentions. Simmer down big boy."
1481733,wallydave,2012-08-31 19:16:00,2151,"This is an interesting thread! As one who has fished the NW section of LS I confess to fishing the Rapids and the mouth of the Wenasaga River. We usually have a family boat in our group, so fast and seemingly careless boaters, that would be the full throttle gang, tend to pixx us off! We slow down when boating by folks in congested areas. We expect the same! When we see a boat that has blasted by us, guess what we forget to slow down. Manyhave posted about less wake at full speed, I can see that, but not everyone sees it that way. Sorry, but it seems like your saying I'm more important, heck with you! If you were anchored with your kids what would you think!? Its a difficult thing, lets think about the newbies! They will help keep the camps and outfitters in business and display some manners!"
1481744,Obabikon,2012-08-31 20:05:00,2370,"Dave, I've never fished that area, so I was speaking more in general, as every lake has what we call ""highways"". I can definately see both sides of the coin, and will NEVER say that careless boating is acceptable. But, in my opinion, boats should not fish in the middle of high traffic areas. You don't play in the middle of the street... but, if you do, when a car comes you move. I'm not saying that carelessness is acceptable. But, I can't imagine that on an amazing fishing lake like Lac Seul anyone would need to fish in the middle of high traffic areas. The boat that buzzes right by you is being rude... without a doubt. The boat fishing in the middle of the narrows is being rude too. But, both have the legal right to behave the way that they see fit... as long as they don't put the other boat in danger."
1481774,wallydave,2012-08-31 21:36:00,2151,"It's not any easy thing for sure!! No doubt about that! If I could speak for our group and perhaps others, it's a matter of perspective. If your new to an area, a busy one for example, and folks blast past you and your family, you will not be happy! It's very true that certain area's get plenty of traffic, if your new to Canadian fishing, and you want nothing more than a safe family trip, the fast ""drive by"" will leave a bad taste in your mouth! Is that what we really want to do for folks trying Ontario for the first time?!"
1481778,v-bay gord,2012-08-31 21:56:00,3168,"Here's an excerpt from a boating safety article. It may not apply totally to this conversation but for what its worth........ ""Fishing Vessel Right-of-Way All vessels which are fishing with nets, lines or trawls are considered to be ""fishing vessels"" under the International Rules. Vessels with trolling lines are not considered fishing vessels. Fishing vessels have the right-of-way regardless of position. Fishing vessels cannot, however, impede the passage of other vessels in narrow channels."" I assume by impeding passage they may refer to blocking a deep channel and forcing a vessel into water where it is unsafe? There seems to be no mention of speed in any of this. A bit of common sense on both sides is probably the correct answer."
1481819,AllenW,2012-09-01 06:55:00,11482,That would be my guess too.Al
1482004,Jesse-WI,2012-09-01 23:00:00,534,Interesting thread I have also been watching. Some need to go read the laws of Canada and their International counterpart. It is against the law to anchor in the middle of a navigable narrow channel. http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...art-b-2821.htm
1482007,Jesse-WI,2012-09-01 23:26:00,534,"Actually it does apply and the definition for narrow channels is fairly open. If you are anchored or fishing in a narrow channel and impede my passage you have broken the law. If I choose to not be safe and blow by you causing unsafe conditions then I have broken the law. I know in my case the wake my boat throws is much smaller than those considered unsafe for small craft when on plane at full speed. I also know that that if you want me to throw a smaller wake, then I would be driving less than 5 mph. So who is causing the etiquette issue? So while I will not buzz you, I am not likely to slow down much."
1482017,castnblast,2012-09-02 00:50:00,111,...others need to spend more time on the water in NWO in order to truly understand lake etiquette. V Bay said it best....common sense from both sides.
1482048,wallydave,2012-09-02 06:57:00,2151,"Thanks for posting the regulations! Now we have the information to make safe and legal boating choices. I admit that I hadn't taken the time to look up, much less read the regs. Part of the reason this site is so valueable is learning lakes, methods and now the rules that can help for better safer trips!"
1482078,v-bay gord,2012-09-02 08:15:00,3168,"I think the situations we are talking about are not resolved by these rules. They seem to apply to actually blocking a navigable channel and forcing a boat to take an unsafe or alternate route. That is clear....you shouldn't be there if blocking the channel......but in most cases these boats are not blocking, but are in the way, or in close proximity. The question then becomes how fast do you travel through an area conjested with fishermen? If it's safe to swing away from the boat and still maintain plane, then perhaps that is acceptable. In some cases it may be best to go through at a slow speed.....ie no wake. Showing some consideration is important, as would the safety factor. Put some alchohol into the mix and of course any logical thought goes out the window."
1481553,FuzzzyIL,2012-08-31 09:22:00,2326,"Figured I'd pile on with my contribution.Ten Horse - I agree with you. Fly-ins do not have crowding issues that drive-ins do. But I have a story. My new bride and I were on our honeymoon on a fly-in. (How bout that guys?, she's a keeper). Anyway, we'd fished this lake before and had our 'milk run' down. There is one other cabin on the far side of the lake. We never saw anyone in it previously, but day one of our trip we see three boats coming thru the narrows from that cabin. The see us and stop. The move right in and circled the wagons on us. Fortunatly that spot was not a hot spot. We continue on fishing as we are used to heavy river pressure fishing anyway. All three boats start casting bass cranks, spinner baits, one guy threw a buzzbait. I catch a 17 incher and through it back. And these guys stop fishing and just stare. Then the bride tosses back one. Me another. Then I realize these guys aren't rude they are frickin CLUELESS! We start a chattin and things warm up. They are family from Tennessee who won the trip through some radio show down there. They only fish crappie and bass. Not one jig in 6 tackle boxes. They had been there 3 days and only caught one hammer handle slimer. I was amazed and felt bad for these guys. So I gave each boat a dozen home made jigs with assorted twister tail colors. Showed them how to back troll and 'hover' over rock humps and reefs etc. Over the next two days they caught their limit to take home and had a fish fry as well. They stopped by our cabin the night before they flew out and gave us a case of beer in thanks."
1481562,castnblast,2012-08-31 09:55:00,111,"I disagree with this attitude. Boating lanes or not...if someone decides to drop anchor or drift through a narrow - it is their right to do so, unless the location is posted otherwise. Anyone in such a rush, or so crazed to blow through on step without regard for another watercraft really ought to re-think the very reason you are on the lake in the first place. Slowing down to a reasonable speed so that idle boat (who was there first) realizes the passing craft is ""aware of"" - and ""acknowledges their presence"" is the proper way to proceed in this situation. We call it ""courtesy"" ps ...watch out for AllenW..."
1481565,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-31 09:58:00,235,"Great story! I'm glad they met you - they would have otherwise come home to TN and told everyone that the fishing sucks in Canada. We asked our fly-in outfitter once if anyone has ever gotten skunked on his lakes, and he said the closest thing is when guys come up from the south who are completely bass fishing oriented and just pitch bass lures into very shallow cover...they leave with only a couple small pike to their name."
1481567,v-bay gord,2012-08-31 10:12:00,3168,"I agree with castnblast. While it is often inconvenient to have people fishing in narrows, or other ""travel routes"", the proper thing is to show some respect and ere on the side of safety. Last I heard they haven't perfected the braking systems on boats. If the area is wide enough then squeezing over and maintaining the boat on plane may be appropriate, but the attitude that they deserve whatever 'cause they're in the way is wrong."
1481577,Obabikon,2012-08-31 10:45:00,2370,"Two rudes don't make a right, and I agree it is their right to fish a location. It is also another boat's right to go full speed unless it's posted otherwise. I also want to point out that if you slow down, slow all the way down. The 1/3rd throttle makes by far the largest wake. I'd actually prefer people to go full speed by me when I'm guiding."
1481620,FuzzzyIL,2012-08-31 12:18:00,2326,"That is excatly what happened. The first thing the oldest brother said was 'This lake sucks!!!!' We kept popping fish while we were talking to them boat to boat. I always wondered this - ok you win a trip to Canada - you know nothing about it right? So read a book! Read walleye magazines! Ask someone! I mean that is a long drive up from TN.Another year that cabin had yahoos again. They asked how to catch pike because the son wanted a trophy pike on the wall. So told em and sd the standard trophy is 40 inches, release anything smaller. The brat killed a 36 the first day, a 38 the next day, another 38, then a 40 - they kept them all. Jagaloons!Oh btw - the Mrs pulled a 46 one year and a 13 walleye - both replicas now. Mr BoatControl man got no credit."
1481622,AllenW,2012-08-31 12:23:00,11482,"I'd better mention I'm not completely insane and I don't wrist rocket people normally for stuff like that. I did shoot a water skier once many years ago, when after buzzing the wife and I and getting to about 15 foot of the boat they came around for another pass, this time the idiot was going to go on the other side of the boat and raise his ski line to go over us.I got him center mass with a .32 cal steelie.And the boat several times while they picked him up.I go out of my way not to endager others, I expect at least the attempt in return, just seems like common sense to me.Al"

1481637,Coyoteman,2012-08-31 12:55:00,209,"A wrist rocket is not the way to go. A paintball gun is a better way to go.Really, whenever we get moved in on we just move on, usually at a high rate of speed. There is always another place to find the fish."
1481649,Wall-i-Lama,2012-08-31 13:34:00,1524,"I figure that most times boats pull up on you, either because they were watching at a distance and saw you catch something, or they just don't have big boy pants yet and need my help locating fish. I think that many of these same boats couldn't catch the fish, even if you gave them the GPS coordinates. What I do is leave the spot and come back later. I've already shown them where to fish, not about to show them how to fish. I know this is easier to do on a large lake or large river. Now, on some small rivers or lakes, the fish are concentrated and the spots are numbered, so I think bumper boat rules then apply. Nobody should be surprised by this as the only options are to fish or not fish. I fish on the Illinois river some and have actually met some nice folks while shuffling spots for sauger."
1481079,Limeyangler,2012-08-29 21:37:00,563,"This is not just a LS thing...and is not restricted to any one individual or group...it happens all over by all sorts.I just move...pisses me off, but i'll find fish somewhere else, even if i dont i'll have fun trying."
1481121,WalleyeWally28,2012-08-30 06:37:00,298,Same thing happened to me the same week. I asked our camp owner what was proper in this instance. His reply was to pass on the right and not slow down (as the wake would be worse at a slower speed) and you shouldn't be expected to slow to a troll in a major passage such as Steamboat Narrows.
1481151,mdsn,2012-08-30 07:53:00,121,I am heading to Goose Bay next week....now I will know where the big fish are by to watch for the 6 boats all vying for that hot spot!! lol
1481174,SinOrSwim,2012-08-30 08:56:00,1528,"lol More of a wild goose chase half the time. It's only our second year fishing LS and we only fished 3 days last year so we still have a LOT to learn. But, if you see boats from Onaway Lodge, give us a wave. Morganman, Hawkfan and I will all be there. Also IAJOE will be at Onaway as well but I think he might have his own boat?Can't wait. I am ready to get away for awhile."
1481178,AllenW,2012-08-30 09:05:00,11482,"40 years ago I'd have called him names and flipped him off maybe, now I just troll down and maybe mention that it's not a very safe place to anchor.Maybe it's getting old enough to decide it ain't worth getting all wound up over and ruin a good day.Al"
1481415,Guest,2012-08-30 21:48:00,0,"Anyone that fishes in the main boating route should EXPECT to have boats blow past them. If you find that to be an annoyance then move to another spot. Steamboat, shanty, scout lake or scout bay narrows are MAIN boating lanes and really are not alternate routes around them. There are many other GOOD spots that you don't have to clog the main boat routes. The only time I'll slow down is if the route is Clogged with boats and there isn't safe passage thru. I'll slow down and throw a BIG wake to help the jigging action!"

We are in one of the big cabins, cabin 3. There will be 12 of us, several who have never been up there. 3 of the guys are coming from Arizona too. Should be a hoot!

1481480,AllenW,2012-08-31 07:03:00,11482,Which reminds me I need new rubbers for my wrist rocket.There is no reason to boat unsafely and blowing by people at high speed and to close is unsafe.Al
1481486,Pezman38,2012-08-31 07:18:00,3196,"I fish Gull Rock and the boats this year were much higher than years past. I love it when the wind blows because people don't venture out and we have the lake to ourselves. I have witnessed the following: Group came in on our marker and caught it! We were fishing a main lake point and a camp boat come right up beside us and tossed out an anchor. My dad almost blew a gasket on that one. We made trolling passes down one set of islands and other boats would just follow us through like we were best friends. Last year I fished a main lake point again and had a boat come within 10 foot at WOT, plenty of room not to do that just plain stupidity. This year we were using spot lot on an area and I look up and two personal boats and 7 camp boats were headed straight for us. The camp boats went to an area a couple hundred yards away, that is fine, the personal boats started far enough away trolling toward us. The one maintained a safe distance and I had no problem with that, the other witnessed a 24"" fish come in our boat and he whipped around so fast to fish by us he caught two lines in the prop. Bass fishing a shoreline, nothing is worse than a boat flying up and starting to fish 10 yards in front of you."
1480648,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-28 19:46:00,235,"This is one advantage to a fly in versus a lake with dozens of resorts on it. Although, all the threads I see about this problem seem to hinge on Lac Seul."
1480675,Steve of Madison,2012-08-28 21:22:00,230,"You may seem to think it does, but it happens all over, LS, Eagle, Rainy, LOW it happens on them all. It really comes down to what YOU do when it happens. I will usually go about my business until it becomes either uncomfortable for me or for the other boat. Then I will pick up and leave, (then write a thread about it on WC, LOL). It happend to us this trip but we had just had the best morning of fishing in at least 5 yrs, so I'm not going to complain. And I'm sure others have thought I snaked in on a spot they were working too. But some spots, as others have stated, are large, hold alot of fish, and also will attract a crowd, i.e. Manitoba Pt, McKenzie sand banks etc. They can handle a few more boats and you shouldn't expect to have those kinds of places to yourself.An earlier post had it right, everybody else is way more important than you, just ask 'em!"

1480700,Skiball,2012-08-28 22:34:00,82,"Been fishing south end for 20 yrs and we've had some of the same experiences. Especially trolling and drifitng bridges with boats not even slowing up or rushing the spot. Each year it doesn't surprise me and we're starting to see it from the guides. They will do whatever it takes to get fish for their clients, even if that means trying to push you off a spot. Things are changing..........unfortunately not for the better.Good Fishing!"
1480792,Shotgun,2012-08-29 09:11:00,759,"I started this thread to see if others were having the same experiences as me. And yes it appears we all fight this issue. Just maybe we can start turning the tide by trying to influence it in a positive way. If enough of us discuss this issue in open forums, at the minimum it may be on some fisherman's minds and they might respond in a positive way. Nothing is going to be accomplished if we set back and complain vs. taking a proactive approach. A hand out or sticker for boats with some fishing etiquette outlined would be a simple start. We could call it ""How to eliminate lake rage"". LOL"
1480793,SinOrSwim,2012-08-29 09:12:00,1528,"We have 6 boats in our group this year, leaving next week for Lac Seul. I'm pretty sure we will infringe upon each other and steal spots. I know I will folllow MorganMan's wake and try to steal a big one out from under him!!! If you guys will give me exact coordinates of you favorite fishing spots on Lac Seul, I ""promise"" to stay away from them. But, I can't unless I know where they are?????"
1480798,tv4fish,2012-08-29 09:16:00,2694,I sure hope the other 5 boat operators see this post...............
1480824,AllenW,2012-08-29 10:19:00,11482,"Not so sure about the high speed no wake thing, once had a Bass boat come by me at about 60 mph and wasn't more than 30-40 foot away, had I gotten to my wrist rocket a bit sooner I'd have explained to him why you don't do that.Slight error/part breakage and you'll take the chance of killing somebody doing that.There is nowhere I need to be in such a hurry that I need to put somebody else in harms way.I think you'll find morons anywhere, had two old timers back troll into us while we were anchored on Gullrock a ways back.LS does seem to get more than it's fair share of nimrods though..Al"
1480877,wallydave,2012-08-29 12:05:00,2151,"This year I was visiting with a camp operator, I mentioned a near by camp that seemed to have quite a few guests that blast past boats with little or no slowing down. I was told that one of ""those"" boat swamped a guests boat in early spring!! When someones actions put another person at risk, that is wrong! Be safe you never know when someting could happen to you!"
1481071,bigtimeelectric,2012-08-29 20:56:00,174,"I agree with what you guys are saying, but how about this scenerio when I was up there in August there was a boat anchored right in the middle of the channel in steamboat narrows fishing in 30 some feet deep just to the east side of the marker. Well the steamboat narrows to me is like the halfway point to mckenzie bay and I do not slow down of plane there I admit that and see plenty of boats zoom through there as well, anyway this guy gives me a dirty look and lifts his arms in the air in disgust well what does he expect is going to happen there every boat should come off plane and slowly troll around the outside of him then back up on plane? I don't think so. What do you guys do through there? good luck to all you lucky guys that are heading up there this fall I am jealous."
1480390,zeebee,2012-08-28 07:05:00,1144,yeah guides are a funny lot.....they think nothing of crawlin up your boats butt. You move in on them however and they unleash what be some sorta northern moose profanity. I remember once a few years back on LOW witnessing a guide fastball a beer bottle at a boat he thought was encroaching on his territory.
1480391,HighTech,2012-08-28 07:08:00,75,"I always have a problem when I'm on step and running through a ""narrow channel on a main traveled route.."" and I see a boat fishing or trolling there. My rule is if the boat seems to be about the same size as mine, it is best for me to stay on step and pass by high speed. This provides them with the least amount of wake and I'm out of their way in seconds. If the other boat is very small or if it has a load of kids or it's a canoe I slow right down and troll past them. I think a high speed pass by in a narrow (100 ft) chanel is safe and appropriate. In a chanel that is narrower than that on a main traveled route, I would not suggest fishing in it."
1480398,tv4fish,2012-08-28 07:22:00,2694,"Just my take: Let's not ""blame"" the body of water for this - let's put the blame right where it belongs - on some guides that REALLY should know better (in this regard - do what I did - if the guide boat has a camp name on it - call the camp and let them know date, time, place and tell them to talk to their guide). If it's a private boat - like they say - ""you can't fix stupid"". The marker decoy works, but a person should NOT have to do stuff like that. Casting a large ""jerk"" bait in their direction kinda sends a message, also."
1480428,Campcountry,2012-08-28 08:03:00,164,Right on! Anyone who chooses to fish in a narrow high traffic area is inconveniencing everyone else just by being there and if they think other boaters should pass them at 5 mph - well they are nuts. Full speed makes the smallest wake.
1480434,camp chef,2012-08-28 08:16:00,915,"Full speed does make the smallest wake.I fish alot on rver system here in Wisconsin and it is quite narrow in spots. Many times inexperienced boaters will try to do the right thing by slowing down to 1/4 throttle thinking that they are being nice, when in reality it is the worst thing that they can do. As exasperating as it is it is hard to get mad at someone who is trying."
1480438,greg2648,2012-08-28 08:36:00,80,"I guess that our group has been lucky. We have fished the NW arm including Scout Bay, Makenzie, South Inlet, Broad, Sunlight, Manitoba and Bay of Islands with little to no interference from other boats."
1480445,dutchboy,2012-08-28 08:56:00,5717,"As someone who fishes Kabatogama & Namakin in Minnesota I can say it's not entirely guides. People are inconsiderate, arrogent, and just plain a pain in the a_ _.It seems that people have lost respect or have no respect for other folks, regardless of if they are fishing, driving, or whatever. I get ""strange"" looks if I come off plane and idle by folks. It's like it's something they have never seen before.Something to remember these days..........A) Everybody's time is more important then yours.B) Everybody is more important then you are.C) It is ALWAYS your fault, no matter what it pertains to.D) You should know better, you can't expect common sense out of anybody else.E) You are sitting on the only spot on that 200,000 acre lake that contains fish."
1480447,Aaron-IN,2012-08-28 09:08:00,500,"This happens all over NW Ontario. I mostly bass fish ( I know, I know) and my rule of thumb is if I'm working a shoreline and some jackwagon pulls right in front of me, if his boat is close enough it's going to get my lure either upside his head or it will bounce off the side of his $30,000 boat."
1480452,farmnfish,2012-08-28 09:24:00,130,"I'm curious what people think is proper etiquette when a certain structure draws allot of fish and is greatly different than the rest of the lake. People tend to flock to just that spot. Like whitefish falls on Missinabie, Does the first person there get to sit there all day? A location can only take so many, how long do you stay before giving others a chance?"
1480487,JayM5209,2012-08-28 11:03:00,1050,"We've all had our bad experiences with jerks moving in on us or flying by at too high a speed, but I always just scratch my head when this kind of thread comes up. If I experience this kind of problem during one of my Canadian fishing weeks, I'm simply fishing the wrong water! It doesn't matter how good the catching is reported to be, it's not the experience I go to Canada for. In a typical week long trip I'll have three or four days on the water when I do not see another boat, and the other days I may see three or four. On one larger lake that always gets a day of laker fishing I may see other boats 10 or 12 times during the day, but over thirty years I can count on one hand the number of times one has gotten closer than 1/4 mile. I can get all of the too close aggravation I want within five miles of home, ain't goin' to the bush for that kind of nonsense.Of course, all the above is just my opinion . . . . . . . . . ."
1480166,Shotgun,2012-08-27 16:47:00,759,"Just returned from a seven day fishing trip on Lac Seul. We fished the Northwest side. Caught some very nice fish-biggest walleye 28.5"" & biggest pike 38"". Dozens of fish in the slot. Walleye-fifteen to twenty foot of water almost all on minnows with bottom bouncers. Pike-casting into the bank with spoons. Overall some nice fishing.This was my first time fishing Lac Seul. However, I have fished other Canadian lakes for 14 years. This was the worst lake I have ever fished for what I call proper fishing etiquette. We had numerous boats come right in on us as we were working an area, which had to be very obvious what we were doing. They just didn't seem to care. We even had a few go by us within a hundred feet 30+mph while we were trolling. Has anyone else noticed this more on this fishery than other areas?"
1480173,rdbalmer,2012-08-27 17:00:00,279,I have been fishing Lac Seul for about 25 years now an unfortunately I must agree with you on the lack of respect for others. It is a huge body of water and I really can't see how any one can justify the crowding and 30 mph. fly bys. I know some of it is from those of us from the U.S. but a couple of the most memorable ones were by some of the canadian guides. Apparently if you aren't paying them to show you how and where to fish you are not very welcome there. I know I go up there to relax and get away from that type of behavior and the last thing I want is someone doing that stuff to me or one of our group. I don't know if there is an easy answer but it is sure frustrating when it happens. Rob
1480178,wallydave,2012-08-27 17:14:00,2151,"I have noticed the same problem in the NW end. I mentioned this to the camp owner, was one of the other near camps a problem in this type of behavior? The answer was yes! Your right the size of LS and the number of places to catch walleye should lead to less of this problem, sadly it seems the problem is only getting worse! Respect or the lack of it, is part of the problem! If we bring this problem into the light, hopefully things will slowly change!? I sure hope so!"
1480186,jimirjr,2012-08-27 17:28:00,1149,"This has happened to Me on Lake of the Woods... BUT, It was a supposed ""professional guide"" type that did it. I guess I beat them to one of thier spots. Oh well, caught fish, anyway.... so no biggie."
1480213,MorganMan,2012-08-27 18:32:00,341,"So what is the etiquette/rule if it's obvious you are trolling a shoreline or a certain structure? I would never infringe on someone in a spot, but have heard many stories here about others dropping by. If you are trolling, what are the expectations? I'm not so sure I would be as understanding. Just wondering."
1480248,mdsn,2012-08-27 19:48:00,121,Once the camp owners realize that this kind of behaivor and bad press is hurting them in the pocketbook they might begin to police themselves (guides) and educate their customers.When it gets bad enough that posts like this are circulating you know it has an impact. ( and this is not the first post or only place I have seen this talk)Maybe they are only losing one or two bookings a year or maybe more but why lose any just because of some rude ignorant jerks!?The camp owners work way to hard to have customers encouraged to go elsewhere.
1480294,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-27 21:05:00,429,"We fished Lac Seul this year July 28 - Aug. 4th mostly Bay of Island, McKenzie Bay, bay between Popular Narrows and Manitoba Point and South Inlet and Scout Bay... Happy to say this year we had NO problems with any boats moving in on us in any areas that our group of 3 boats were fishing. Had a few boats approach us on some spots, slow down and then went on their way. Maybe all the stare down dirty looks we gave them kept them moving??? LOL Only lack of courtsey was when we were fishing a narrow channel on a main travel route and also the entrance to Scout Bay, we had some boats come close and blowing by at full speed waving as they go by. Compared to fishing Lakes here in Northern MN......Lac Seul fishing etiquette was WAY BETTER than Northern MN! Counting down the days to our return trip of our 10th year of fishing awesome Lac Seul! RBF"
1480297,Shotgun,2012-08-27 21:08:00,759,"Fishing etiquette is common sense and common courtesy. You may of spent 20 to 30 minutes marking fish and setting up your approach just to have someone blast up to intrude. -If someone is in your favorite spot, so be it you may of been in their spot an hour earlier. Find another spot. -Observe what others are doing and if they are trolling don't cross their lines they have out or interfere with their swings. -Don't pass boats so fast that you rock them with your wake. It's unsafe and scares fish away. Approach or pass others at a speed that doesn't distrub the fish or fisherman."
1480318,Steve of Madison,2012-08-27 21:38:00,230,"Well said ShotgunAlso, if you are interested in having a little fun some day when the fishing is slow, OR you want to keep the interloppers at bay you can always ""plant"" a marker bouy and see how many fisherman you can catch.Simply throw it out, well off your spot but within eyeball range, and see how many unsuspecting boats will cruise up and try out your spot. Our group has done it several times, and the reaction when we pick up the bouy and tell them they are on candid camera is priceless."
1480334,Golden Eagle,2012-08-27 22:42:00,2642,Throwing out a marker without a weight will work.
