1485282,NARDA 1,2012-09-11 07:54:00,636,Just picked some up yesterday at the co-op in Vermillion Bay for our lunches....YUM.
1483718,frozen fish,2012-09-06 09:49:00,92,"OK, I'm biased but Winnipeg has the best rye bread. My preference in order isNatural BakeryKubCity BreadSome of these brands are available in NW Ontario."
1483723,johnboat,2012-09-06 10:11:00,2014,"Does anyone know if this would be the same bread that is sold at Buena Vista in Morson? If so, yes, buy a few loaves. Very good. Lil spendy, but what isn't anymore."
1483804,zeebee,2012-09-06 14:27:00,1144,Really..... you guys like that stuff. I live in Winnipeg.....home town to those bakeries and I dont buy the stuff even tho it sells for $1.50/loaf. To me its not much different than Wonder Bread in quality.
1483920,v-bay gord,2012-09-06 20:38:00,3168,"Natural Bakery Rye bread @ $1.50 a loaf? Unlikely......but good try at getting some reaction. If you consider Wonder Bread similar, you probably prefer Pabst Blue Ribbon over an Old Vienna."
1483936,zeebee,2012-09-06 21:00:00,1144,"One a month $1.50 across the street @ Food Fare...would take Sleemans over OV any day. I was brought up on European style breads....whole grain with substance and hearth. Cant understand the attraction to light rye or the white stuff...all made with cheap ingredients. Native Italians refer to us as ""mangelecakes' (somethin like that)...means cake eaters in reference to our bread preferences. Not sure why you felt the need for a personal attack over rye bread."
1483946,Glenman12,2012-09-06 21:22:00,762,maybe Im missing something..is there a big difference between US rye and Canadian rye??????
1484013,v-bay gord,2012-09-07 07:23:00,3168,"You might want to check out the Natural Bakery store on Henry Ave in Winnipeg. They offer all types of bread, none of which I would slander by a reference to Wonder Bread (I agree that the white stuff hardly qualifies as bread). Never saw it for $1.50 a loaf but I stand corrected if it is so. Personal attack........I was thinking the same......""insult my bread, you insult me""....... (not really)"
1484910,LOW1,2012-09-10 08:21:00,2828,I certainly miss my Canadian Rye bread but the real crises is that my local Hy-Vee grocery store no longer had Red River Cereal on its shelves. (There's four of them in town and one of the them carried it) And the supermarket in Cook MN where I stop also did not have it. I am down to my last box. It could be a long winter. I may have to make an October trip up north to restock.
1485146,Bill Krejca,2012-09-10 18:55:00,6107,"Buena Vista carries what they call ""Red River"" bread. It is my understanding they bake this dark loaf right there. Several of my friends stock up on it, even order it ahead of time. Bill Krejca"
1485243,stillangling,2012-09-11 05:59:00,149,"This string seems a little weird but what the heck, might as well dive in. IMO the best rye bread available in NW Ontario is from BOWNESS BAKERY in Calgary. It is called Whole Grain Rye. Comes in an orange and yellow bag. Not the spongy white stuff. Pretty ugly in the price dept, around $5 a bag but breakfast isn't the same unless I have a toasted piece of this stuff on my plate. Not sure if it is carried in stores east of Kenora though."
1426097,Catman59,2012-04-25 04:27:00,345,"City Bread Rye is awesome. I bring 10 loaves home and they keep in the freezer very well. I have delivery service 3 or 4 times a year that brings it down for me too , so I have it year around . It is very good bread."
1426210,LOW1,2012-04-25 08:29:00,2828,"I do not remember the brand name, but there is also a thick cut/texas toast variety of bread sold in the Lake of the Woods area which can be used to make incredible french toast."
1426465,rpieske,2012-04-25 15:17:00,1276,The name of the store in Emo is the Cloverleaf. Dalseg's is a good choice and from what I hear the bakery is again open next to Dalseg's.
1426957,bigwalleye1,2012-04-26 18:12:00,2632,"BREAD????? With Canadian RYE????? Sounds like a long shot. Don't think it'll ever catch on so long as someone is still using it for it's God-intended purpose---Makin' fine Canadian Rye Whiskey. In some circles, that's bordering on sacreligeous.... What'll they think of next???? There oughtta be a law......"
1458616,Sidge61,2012-07-06 20:11:00,59,What is the name of the supermarket that is in Sioux Lookout?
1458664,RapShad,2012-07-07 03:52:00,76,Johnny's
1465206,Catman59,2012-07-23 13:44:00,345,Brought home a few loaves for the freezer Saturday ........ Border guy laughed and decided he had better buy some as he had heard it was good stuff !!!!
1465231,cuamb,2012-07-23 14:46:00,203,I brought some home Friday. Border guy gave me a hard time. Asked if I bought anything and I said no. He could see the bread in the bake. I said I forgot and he grilled me on lots of stuff.
1466133,Gibson,2012-07-25 12:34:00,17,"Pretty much any of the big chains, ie. Safeway, etc. carry these commercial rye breads. There's also another Winnipeg company called Kubs that has a great asst. of ryes. Check out the Multigrain some time...."
1483606,SNOPRO,2012-09-06 00:36:00,108,Found that the Walmart in Fort Francis carries it and has alot in stock. $4.67 per loaf
1425588,SNOPRO,2012-04-24 07:25:00,108,Is there a store near Nestor Falls that carries Canadian Rye Bread?
1425619,camp chef,2012-04-24 08:06:00,915,Dalseg's in Nestor Falls has it. We pick up our bread and salad fixings there. Nice store also has beer and liquor.
1425636,LOW1,2012-04-24 08:32:00,2828,The Trading Post in Sioux Narrows (25 mile north of Nestor Falls)also has it.
1425652,Rivratz,2012-04-24 08:52:00,105,There is a grocery store that has a good bakery in Emo on the way up. Can't think of the name of it. I'm sure Ft. Frances has a good bakery hidden in that town. Don't forget the Corned Beef!
1425693,Bill Krejca,2012-04-24 09:53:00,6107,"The large grocery store, coming into Emo, from FF has a good selection of breads. I have started stopping there on my way up, even though I am coming from Baudette, thanks to a tip from several WC contributors. Last year, I asked about purchasing just a few red potatoes, as all the reds were in prepacked bags. The guy at that department ( I think he was the owner) said to just break open a bag and take out what I wanted, they'll weigh them. The folks there are very accomodating! Bill Krejca"
1425719,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-04-24 10:25:00,138,I know it is not close to Nestor Falls just a FYI. The supermarket in Sioux Lookout carries it. Our first stop when we get to town and the last to pickup some for home.
1425787,Fishoil,2012-04-24 12:25:00,1277,Is there something special about it? We always buy Beefsteak Rye and take it with us. Am I'm missing out on something??
1425898,Bill Krejca,2012-04-24 16:03:00,6107,"Most Canadian bread is better, in my opinion, to the US bread found in grocery stores. I always buy my bread in Canada, except for an occasional Panera sourdough loaf. Think beer. Bill"
1425915,TIGHTLINER,2012-04-24 16:38:00,223,GUYS TRY THIS MAKE YOUR OWN BREAD IN CAMP VERY EASY.3 CUPS OF SELF RISING FLOUR1/2 CUP SUGAR 1 CAN OF BEER ( WARM )STIR THIS TOGETHER PUT A BREAD PAN AND BAKE AT 350 FOR ABOUT 45 TO 50 MIN. GREAT AS TOAST GARLIC BREAD OR JUST BUTTERED WITH FISH.
1425925,v-bay gord,2012-04-24 17:04:00,3168,I have a bunch of American guests who like to buy the Natural Bakery Canadian Rye bread here at the Co-op in Vermilion Bay. There is also the City Bread Rye bread as well. Both are made in Winnipeg and are very popular.
