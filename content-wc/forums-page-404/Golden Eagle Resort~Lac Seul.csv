1325484,Guest,2011-07-03 09:29:00,0,"We stayed there for a week and we all got charged over for minnows and gas, we then had to pay $75 for a new prop. We also had a $1300 bill for a new lower unit because they dont offer boat insurance. I would recommend not staying there."
1325682,stumcfar,2011-07-03 22:49:00,451,"Have stayed at Golden Eagle 4 years. The boats are tremendous, the cabins have been clean and in good shape and the owners have been nothing but friendly and helpful. We also broke a prop and shaft this year and yes, we had to pay for it, because like other resorts, you are responsible for what you break. If you have good home owners insurance, it will pay 100% of the bill. I am hoping to go back again this August with my family and the guys will be back for sure next year."
1325905,jignminow,2011-07-04 19:03:00,168,"This was the first resort that we ever stayed at in Canada. We were booked at Evergreen and upon our arrival, we were moved to this one because of overbooking. We were initially put into a nice cabin but after we had completely unpacked, were asked to move to another with no offer of help. The owners were new. I believe that they had just bought the place, 10 years ago? The cabins were on such huge angles. It was just not a good time. We have never gone back."
1482734,Guest,2012-09-04 08:39:00,0,"Stayed there in July 2012 place is getting cleaned up but we were the only one's there. All of the other camps were full hmmmm. I would reccommend staying at Evergreen lodge. I tore the scag off the lower unit and he charged me a ton to get it repaired, their response was you're in Canada. Alot of camps in this area to treat customers that way. Did I mention my sons baseball glove just disappeared no where to be found if that tells you anything. I know they overcharged for gas and minnows they say you start with six dozen? The fishing is always good in this area of Lac Suel too bad. Not going back!"
1485348,Guest,2012-09-11 10:32:00,0,"i was on this trip and fond the camp very clean the other camps were not busy. Ever green did not have any customers, you have to stay off of the wingdams or you will damage the moter. Ther are bears up there that like ball gloves that are not taken in the cabin at night . We found the prices very fair as we caught our limit every day on the aloted minnows some people just cant fish. See you next year. Avery happy customer."
1485524,Nona,2012-09-11 17:34:00,3,"Have nothing but GOOD things to say about Scot and Alma at Golden Eagle. They are super hosts, cabins are very clean and equipment is well maintained. What more can you ask for!!!!!! As far as if you break something, it has to be repaired no matter what it costs. You are responsible for these repairs when you use something that belongs to someone else, are you not?????? In this area, it is sometimes difficult to get parts for motors and damages repaired, due to the remoteness. Obviously, things are also MORE expensive to fix there. I still do not see the reasoning behind persons who ""bad mouth"" a camp because of the cost of repairs to a motor that THEY damaged. None of the camp owners are ""out to make a buck"" from this. They just want to have their equipment fixed. And by the way, scags, bottom ends, prop damages etc. definitely take alot of the life out of a motor!!!!!!"
1485590,Skywagon,2012-09-11 20:12:00,1106,"You broke it, you fix it, simple concept. Everything is higher priced in Canada, just a fact of life here."
1485657,Nona,2012-09-12 06:54:00,3,"You said it in a ""nutshell"" Skywagon!!!!!!!!"
1485660,Nona,2012-09-12 06:59:00,3,"No camps offer boating insurance anymore! Simply because people will figure ""Oh they have insurance. I don't have to be as careful""!!!!!!! When no insurance is offered, people will be quite a bit less apt to be reckless!"
1485669,btmbncr,2012-09-12 07:36:00,492,I've been around Scott and Alma at least a half a dozen times.Never been anything but super nice.Scott has a twisted sense of humor like me.Bill
551678,Guest,2005-08-22 11:49:00,0,"Some friends I know went up there and stayed at the campground this spring. They ended up breaking their fishing net and left it up there for garbage. A couple of weeks, the one guy's older brother also went to Golden Eagle, but had to rent a boat with fishing equipment. Turns out the fishing net was in their boat (verified by pictures) - and it broke again! The owner had apparently tried to fix/rig the net and pass it off with his rental equipment. He also had the balls to charge him $10 for breaking the net! This may say something about the integrity of the operation/owner."
551682,Guest,2005-08-22 13:34:00,0,">I STAYED AT THAT RESORT ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO AND IT SUCKS. THE >OWNERS WERE RUDE,CABINS DIRTY,PILLOWS SMELLED LIKE SOMEONE >PULLED THEM FROM THE LAKE. my response has nothing to do with this lodge, but as a reply to this message... I always bring my own pillow and sleeping bag. The thought of bedding that maybe hasn't been cleaned properly gives me the heebie jeebies. Again this has nothing to do w/ the lodge in question."
551684,2 DOGS,2005-08-22 14:21:00,361,"Integrity is someone with ""balls"" to sign their name or register. When you don't know something first hand, and don't provide proof positive, save the potshots for somewhere else. I think your friend got off pretty cheap for $10. If you knew anything about fishing you'd know nets are more expensive than that. My friend's brother said so! I am at this resort for 3 months every summer and have been in all of the cabins when friends are staying there. I will guarantee it is one of the cleanest anywhere. Equipment is top notch. My name is Larry Mead, I own the 5th wheel trailer that sits in that campground. I would gladly answer any questions anyone might have, and no, I have no interest in this resort other than setting the record straight after comments from people who like to remain anonymous."
551691,jerry bark,2005-08-22 16:45:00,822,"thanks larry, if i drive over to lac seul anytime soon (i normally go north of the sault) i'll pull my 5'er in beside you and buy you a beer or three... cheers jerry"
551706,Guest,2005-08-23 10:42:00,0,2 dogs sorry about that My phone service was messed up this summer. Alot of people left messages which we didn't get. And I lost a alot of summer business.I use Canada Bell for my answering service. Keep in touch
551716,Guest,2005-08-23 15:00:00,0,"No need to be a jerk Larry. I'm just sharing a story based on factual information, and I never said your precious resort wasn't clean. As long as someone like you goes there, I plan on staying away."
551722,2 DOGS,2005-08-23 17:21:00,361,"I won't stoop to the name calling however, I note you still haven't registered or signed your name. The point of cleanliness applied to an earlier post, good equipment to yours. Did you ever consider the owner may have invested money in repairing the original broken net? Perhaps he's figuring additional costs to repair it again. I'm sure sorry you won't be planning a visit as long as I still go there, that will certainly be cause for me to lose sleep tonight! Should you still feel the need for name calling or cheap shots you can have at it with me and I'll even help. My trailer is a SnowBird, I drive a Dodge truck, I own a Triton boat w/Mercury motors, and there are days my wife outfishes me. Now you are just loaded with factual information for ammunition. Larry Mead (aka jerk)"
551723,Reels,2005-08-23 17:56:00,2876,"Hey two dogs, I emailed you a few weeks ago regarding this place. If you have a chance, shoot me an e-mail and let me know what you like about the place, and why you keep going back? Thanks, reels64 at yahoo dot com <{{}}><"
551733,2 DOGS,2005-08-24 06:51:00,361,REELS: You've got mail!
551766,johnR,2005-08-25 10:44:00,41,"Jerry Where do you go north of the Sault. I am interested going up there. What species do you go for? I have been in the Algoma district for brookies, but not any other species. thanks for any info"
550907,Reels,2005-08-01 09:02:00,2876,"Looking for some feedback from people who have stayed at Golden Eagle in Lac Seul. I have read some good things here, but then I talked to someone this morning who was there 5 years ago, and hated it. (Cabins not level, crabby owner, etc.) If you stayed there, please post, or you can send a private e-mail. [email protected]. If you have a better suggestion, I would like that too. Thanks~ <{{}}><"
550911,Guest,2005-08-01 10:06:00,0,Check out this one. it looks great and I have heard nothing but GOOD about it.www.lostislandlodge.com

551184,Guest,2005-08-06 20:18:00,0,never stayed there. have heard nothing but good things about the camp.
551613,Guest,2005-08-18 19:20:00,0,"I spend 2-3 months there every summer and will guarantee it is one of the cleanest bunch of cabins you'll find. Boats are clean and in good shape. Cabins aren't new, but definately in decent shape and they don't charge new cabin prices. Wanttofishnow is way out in left field on this one. I'd welcome any questions you might have on the resort and no, I don't have any interest in it other than it's my choice of a place to stay. Owners are good hosts also."
551615,Guest,2005-08-18 20:29:00,0,"I've stayed there twice, 06/03 and 06/04. I found the cabins very comfortable and the fishing to be outstanding. One of my buddies is heading there again in Sept. The guy with the negative comments is an idiot, probably expects mints on his pillow. Have a good one."
551622,Guest,2005-08-19 09:38:00,0,"I met the owners at a sportshow and they seem like good people and I never heard a bad thing about them from anybody else. Hey 2 dogs I thought we were going to do some fishing this summer, whats up couldn't you get that boat going this year. You need uncle Ernie to put a Yamaha on the back of it."
551624,Guest,2005-08-19 10:01:00,0,Back to calling people names I see. How do you know this other fellow is an idiot? The post was if anybody had info on the place and he must have had a bad week there so he gave his opinion so climb off. He said his 2 cents and that is no reason for you to start calling him names.
551635,2 DOGS,2005-08-19 18:51:00,361,"Hey Bud, are you so booked up you don't even check your phone messages? I left 2 and gave up. I had that boat going and was ready for you to give me a lesson on Gull Rock walleye. Well, there's always next year. Uncle Ernie just grins when I tell him maybe I need different motors."
551673,Guest,2005-08-22 10:30:00,0,"I was there in June of 04 and am going back in three weeks. I think the owners are relatively new - within 3-4 years. The fish house is extremely clean, supplies are plentiful and the hosts were plenty attentive. The cabins are fine, not the Hilton but comfortable, dry and clean. I'm not sure what you would expect for $4-$500 / week. I take my own boat but the lodge boats are as good as I have seen in Canada. BTW, fishing is freakin' dynamite. If you are looking for a hot tub, massage and room service you ought to go to Florida.. The hosts get a little ornery when 28"" walleye are being filleted. His point is a good one - Fish that big dont taste that great, carry most of the eggs and are probably full of toxins anyway. If you want a trophy, take a picture and have it replicated. Let the big ones go and sustain the resource. We dont seem to understand that in our country - hence we have to go to Canada. I have the ""catch and release"" pin I recieved from the Golden Eagle proudly displyed on my favorite fishing hat. They also get a little edgy when fat guys from Superior, WI are doing hole starts off his dock - dont blame him."
