Also ended up with several walleye in the 20-22 inch range, a 24, 25, 27, and the biggest 29.5 with a 16.5 inch girth= 10.58 lbs. All were caught off the same lure. New lake for me and I must say I was impressed. Anyone else ever fish there?"

Is the Wenasaga Lodge the only camp on this lake ? Their website showed photos of the cabins and lodge/area, and it looked like a very nice camp and a good fishery. Nice photos by the way. Rich"
1485749,Walleyegolfer,2012-09-12 12:39:00,18,Thanks Rich. That is the only resort on the lake however there are quite a few cabins on the lake as well. My father's friend bought one on the north end where the river dumps into the lake so we got to stay there for free. Otherwise the last 20 years we stayed on Cedar Lake as well at what is now Northern Lights Resort. Never fished Cedar much though...we mainly hauled our little boats to Ord or Evening lakes.
1485768,wallydave,2012-09-12 13:48:00,2151,Nice days fishing! Our group has always had good to great fishing on the Wenasaga River as it flows into the NW end of Lac Seul.Thanks for the report! Its only nine more months before I head North again!!
