1482358,1jigfish2,2012-09-03 07:05:00,110,"I am heading up to this lake about 20 miles north of Vermillion Bay in the middle of September. We have not fished Canada this late in about 15 years Has anyone fished this lake later in the season? This summer has been hot, and I do not believe it has cooled down too much. I would guess that the walleyes will be deep. Any help would be appreciated. We may try for perch and a few muskies also."
1482425,Rich B,2012-09-03 09:24:00,1081,"Friends of mine fished Cedar Lake two Septembers ago and I was slated to go as well, though I ruptured my left quad 10 days before we were to leave for the trip. My surgeon didn't think it was in my best interest to travel 22 hours each way and fish for a week before the surgery, so I stayed back in Ohio and had the surgery when my brother and good friends fished Cedar. That said, they had very tough fishing conditions (cold fronts with high wind and rain every day); though they were able to catch eaters deep at the base of points and wind blown shores with a light jig and minnow. Your camp owners should give you the latest bite info from the guys in camp the week before you arrive - there are a number of rocky shoals that drop into deep water on the southern end of Cedar (near Cedar Lake Lodge) that can be productive. I'm sure others will give you some tips as well. Good luck and have fun.....Cedar is a beautiful chain of lakes and you should pick up some bonus SM Bass as well as have a shot a nice crappies and perhaps a Musky or two (and nice Pike). Guess you can tell I'd love to be back up on Cedar along with you in a week or so (ha) ! Rich"

1482688,ftfarms,2012-09-04 06:04:00,444,"We fished cedar last week and it was tough to say the least. Now it was the first time for us at cedar but we fished Canada in that area for 22years. Just saying we now how to fish. We fished anywhere from 5ft to 25fow. Leaches produced the most walleyes and smallmouths but we caught a few on worms and minnows. Had one over 40"" musky on lost it by the boat one jumped at top water but missed it Couldnt get a pike to hit anything."
1483470,1jigfish2,2012-09-05 17:53:00,110,"Thanks for the help guys. I called the lodge, Northern Lights, guys are getting fish in about 25'-30'. Some are getting some on windy days in 7' on weed edges. I will report back when we return. We leave in 9 days."

1485021,wallydave,2012-09-10 12:04:00,2151,"Hey Hooks, have a great trip! I hope you get on the fish!! Tell us how the trip went when you get back!"
1485121,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-10 17:25:00,725,"You Know it!! Thanks, Dave. I'll be thinking about you....NOT."
1485214,wallydave,2012-09-10 22:11:00,2151,Hooks at least have a beverage of your choice for me with that fresh fillet?! Maybe?!
1485244,HeHooksHimself,2012-09-11 06:03:00,725,"When I sip some of my favorite American microbrew while slipping a bite of delicious walleye down the gullet, a little shout out to WallyDave will be in order. Fish On!"
