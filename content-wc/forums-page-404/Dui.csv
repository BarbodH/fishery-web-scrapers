1475790,schandm,2012-08-17 05:36:00,18,We are booked at Beteau in 2013 and 1 of our group has a DUI from 3 years ago. What are the current laws for admittance into Ontario with a DUI? ThanksDave
1475798,TIGHTLINER,2012-08-17 06:04:00,223,There have many posts on this subject do a search on wc for the same. I would also check with the border patrol several times before going because it seems like it is a changing thing and it depends on where you cross. I am sure you will get lots of posts on this subject.

Even if you have entered Canada before, new screening procedures may lead to you being turned back. Many jurisdictions distinguish between more and less serious offences. The US, for example, classifies crimes as either felonies or misdemeanours. Canada makes a similar distinction with indictable and summary offences, with indictable offences being the more serious. However, quite a number of offences can be treated as either indictable or summary in Canada, depending on the specific circumstances. This is important to know, since determination of admissibility is based on how the offence would be treated in Canada, not its status in the visitor's home state. Impaired Driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, may be a misdemeanour in a visitor's home state, but in Canada it can be an indictable offence. There are three basic procedures available that can allow you to legally enter Canada if you have a criminal record.Granted Rehabilitation You can apply through a Canadian Consulate or certain border crossings to have your record examined by immigration officials. There is a non-refundable administration fee that is usually $200 Canadian but may be higher for very serious offenses. If the application is successful, you will receive a letter stating that you have been Granted Rehabilitation, and you will now be allowed to enter Canada freely any time. We suggest that guests who are considering making an application for Granted Rehabilitation contact the NOTO office so that we can explain the process in more detail and direct them to the best point of contact.Deemed Rehabilitation Under some circumstances, you can be Deemed Rehabilitated without having to apply for Granted Rehabilitation. This procedure applies if you committed a single indictable offence that would be punished by a term of imprisonment of less than ten years (based on how the offence would be classified in Canada) and have not committed any offences since. Ten years must have passed since the completion of the sentence, including any probation. You can also be Deemed Rehabilitated if you have committed two or more summary offences and five years have passed since the sentences were served and no subsequent offences have been committed. Deemed Rehabilitation is generally determined by an immigration officer at the border crossing, although it may be possible to have a determination made in advance. There is no fee for Deemed Rehabilitation; however, the information is not necessarily entered into the database, so you could be denied entry on a subsequent visit. It is possible to obtain a preliminary determination of whether you are admissible under the Deemed Rehabilitated provisions in several ways. Guests can also apply in person for a Remote Area Border Crossing Permit through the Fort Frances Canada Border Services Office or by mail to Canada Border Services Agency 201 North May Street, Thunder Bay ON P7C 3P4. This permit is intended primarily for guests who intend to enter Canada by water in areas where there is no customs and immigration facility. However, since it requires a background check, the permit will demonstrate to customs and immigration officials that a determination of admissibility has been made. There is a $30 Cdn. fee for the permit, and the application is available at http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publicati...bsf386-eng.pdfTemporary Resident Permit At their discretion immigration officials may admit someone who does not qualify for Deemed Rehabilitation through a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP). It is normally issued for a single visit, although it is sometimes issued for longer duration or multiple visits. There is a $200 Cdn administrative fee for issuing a TRP. A guest who arrives at the border and does not qualify for Deemed Rehabilitation but appears to qualify for Granted Rehabilitation may be offered the option of a Temporary Resident Permit in order to complete their trip, since the Granted Rehabilitation process takes a number of weeks to complete. It is expected that guests who plan on returning to Canada will then complete the Granted Rehabilitation Process before any subsequent trips.Welcome to Canada These procedures make it possible to enter Canada, even if you have a criminal record. In most cases, it is better to apply in advance to determine your admissibility, and which procedure is best for you to follow. You should also be prepared with additional information on the offence to help the officer in arriving at a determination. Remember, the determination will be based on the information in the database. If there are any errors, like a charge that was dropped, you need to get those corrected in your home jurisdiction. Despite the troubled times we live in, Canada is still the same friendly place to visit it has always been. The vast majority of guests still enter Canada with absolutely no problem. For those whose backgrounds may pose some difficulty, these procedures may allow them to come and enjoy what Canada has to offer."

1476156,schandm,2012-08-18 04:02:00,18,"Sounds like we better find someone else rather than take a chance on being denied entry. Thanks for the info. GOBIG, we will save plenty of fish for you. This place is unbelievable when it comes to catching fish."
