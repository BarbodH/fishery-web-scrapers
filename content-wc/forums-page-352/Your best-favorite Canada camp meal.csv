It turned out to be THE BIGGEST HIT of our dinner time meals! Now, when We shop...everyone says ""don't forget that bread dough""We adapt it and make cinnamon rolls, pizza, stuffed dough with hamburger and kraut inside.. or just plain with gobs of butter... And, Man, does it make that HB SMELL wonderful!"

2138145,johnboat,2013-09-30 14:50:00,2014,"I smoke a whole pork loin (or two) before we head up. I pull it off a little early. Wrap in it aluminum foil with a little butter, vacuum seal it, then freeze it. At the cabin, I pull it out of the freezer the day before and pop it on the grill or in the oven to get it to temp. Serve with fixens and...........................GONE!! Do the same with backstraps."
2138585,BreezyPoint,2013-09-30 17:47:00,1581,"Try hickory smoked pork tenderloin.Soak chips for one hour.Put chips in a smoker basket on grill.Start grill and wait to you smells the hickory. At the same time, set the pork put until it reaches room temperature.Use a meat thermometer and cook the pork indirect until the temperature reaches 140 degrees. Take the pork off and let it sit for twenty minutes.The temperature of the pork will increase during this period.Note: the USDA has changed their recommendations for temperatures of pork to 140 degrees.I challenge anyone to tell me they have ever had pork better than this. It will be juicy, cooked throughout and taste great.I also cook walleye with hickory chips. I make a small foil pan and smother the fish in butter and cook indirect with hickory chips. The key is to have an open container for the walleye so it can get the smoky flavor. Unbelievable."
2144713,johnboat,2013-10-03 14:32:00,2014,"I pull mine a tad sooner. Usually 130 then wrap it in a towel to let it finish itself off, if I plan on eating that day. 125 if I plan to freeze it and warm it later. It's surprising how much more tender and juicy they are this way."
2144953,BreezyPoint,2013-10-03 16:38:00,1581,"In truth, I pull mine sooner too, but to be honest, I thought no one would try if I said 130 so I went with the USDA number!"

We rotate what we bring so it is more of a potluck amongst us but this year we had, fresh sweet corn, stuffed mushrooms, deep fried pickles (prepared on the shore, Havarti cheese, etc) we cook bacon for the walleye sandwiches then we use the bacon greese along with some peanut oil to fry the fish in. Home made tartar sauce, chocolate turtles from the candy store in Crookston, MN along with chocolate covered potato chips. Stuffed pork chops and grilled pheasant were popular this year also. And how could I forget fresh spicy Caesars to drink. Dinner takes us 2-2.5 hours."

Blue Cheese Linguine with Buffalo Walleye is a very impressive dish for in the bush. As far as ""out of the park home run meals"", BigWalleye, I've been thinking about trying this recipe if it's raining or somthing and you can't grill. This is about as hoidy toidy as it gets.6 filet mignon, cut 2 1/4 inches thickKosher salt2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper3 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil3/4 cup chopped shallots (3 to 4 shallots)1 cup canned beef broth1/2 cup good Cognac or brandyPlace the filets on a board and pat them dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the filets with salt and then press the black pepper evenly on both sides. Allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter and the oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until the butter almost smokes. Place the steaks in the pan and lower the heat to medium. Saute the steaks for 4 minutes on 1 side and then for 3 minutes on the other side, for medium rare. Remove the steaks to a serving platter and cover tightly with aluminum foil.Meanwhile, pour all but 1 tablespoon of fat from the saute pan. Add the shallots and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes. Add the beef broth and cook over high heat for 4 to 6 minutes, until reduced by half, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the Cognac and cook for 2 more minutes. Off the heat, swirl in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Serve the steaks hot with the sauce poured on top."

2120394,ILScott,2013-09-22 18:50:00,139,I like the jambalaya I make with that takes about 5 hours to make on a rainy day then vacuum seal for Canada. Nice hearty meal goes well with fried fish. I also like the backstrap for a meal. My group usually cooks every meal in the states and then vacuum seal it to take with us. Saves time on cooking and less mess.
2120817,Guest,2013-09-23 01:30:00,0,"For a change in flavour, try marinating walleye fillets over night in Manadarin Orange dressing(kraft)! Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes at 350. Take them out & grate fresh parmesean cheese on the fillets & put them back in the oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is bubbling! Enjoy"
2126866,Bakefish,2013-09-25 08:32:00,1077,"My party consists of just two of us and we started doing this a couple of years ago.Save the leftover fried potatoes from the fish fry.Save the leftover fried mushrooms from the steak dinner.Save some Krakus ham from the lunch meat.Bacon.Save some of the pepperjack cheese.Bring a bag of shredded mexican cheese.Get a large bowl and crack about 8 eggs or so and throw them in there, whip the eggs as though you are going to scramble them. Bust up all of the above ingredients into smaller pieces and throw them in with the eggs and mix. Put them in a pan with some hot butter and scramble all of the ingredients together. It may clog an artery or two, but you can't get much finer eating."
2114418,Pikeslayer8,2013-09-19 18:59:00,1460,"There are several things you could throw into a smoker either in the morning or at midday and it would be ready when you get back to camp. That would be optimal use of time.Of course, bringing up pre-smoked goods, like you do, Forgop,(good form, by the way) makes the most sense if you don't have a smoker in camp. I definitely like the idea of fishing a mile or so from camp and smellin dinner hanging over the water."
2115322,bigwalleye1,2013-09-20 07:19:00,2632,"I should clarify. The smoker is at home. I vac seal the ribs and pulled pork and reheat indirectly on the grill at the fish camp, with the pulled pork in a covered foil pan to which I've added the saved drippings from the pulled pork mixed with a little water. I do several of the longer prep meals at home ahead of time, and cook several from raw while we're there. We do have shore lunch a bunch of different ways, along with shore brunch (eggs/spuds/bacon scrambled, a walleye fillet, and a muskmelon) on the last day, and 10 oz marinated prime filet and giant shrimp on the last night in camp."

We make it in a big pot, and save the leftovers for a quicky lunch (along with smoked fish and cheese and crackers).Grilled steak with sautéed mushrooms Shrimp and grits, usually served with fresh tomatoes.We mostly eat sandwiches/soup to get back out there quick; when we do cook it is almost always fish."

2116002,SinOrSwim,2013-09-20 12:11:00,1528,"We go relatively extravagant when we are there. We do the baja tacos for shore lunch and even our guide this year was in love with them. Dinner my favorites are in order:1. Walleye (seafood) Chimichangas.2. Cajun walleye/seafood pasta3. Steak night with a horseradish mushroom sauce.I don't do the cooking for those as I usually cook the fish. We have fish with every meal as well. But, you could probably google a seafood chimi recipe. The chimis have chunks or walleye, shrimp, scallpops in a cheesy sauce. Roll them up in a tortilla and fry. Serve over shredded lettuce with a white cheese sauce on top. Ohhh babyThe pasta is relatively simple. Granted there are things like onion and spices that I am not getting into but if you do something similar with the walleye (put in at the end) shrimp, scallops, crab etc and use a jarred alfredo sauce. Add in a jar of cajun sauce (McCormicks makes one) to about 2 jars of alfredo. Put this over pasta with garlic bread. Steak: We don't do your typical steak. Instead of prime rib we use a strip loin. Same cut that you get NY strip from but it's whole. We put that on the grill and it comes out like a big prime rib or roast beef but with a better taste and texture. We serve this with a horseradish mushroom sauce. That has mushrooms, sour cream, prepared horseradish, bacon, grated onion, heavy cream, worsteshire, thyme and some of the juice from the meat. It is heavenly."

While I haven't had too many abject failures in the meals I cook, I'm looking for some ""out of the park home run meals"" you've had in Canada. Shore lunch I've got nailed, but I'm looking for dinner suggestions. I have done smoked ribs, smoked pulled pork, steak and shrimp or lobster tails, Walleye parmensan, spaghetti. I'm wanting to avoid the normal burgers/polish/dogs fare. We have a full kitchen, so there's little to no limit there. What are your most memorable meals, and what about them made them ""hit the mark"" for you?"

However, one of our favorites year after year...and the one most requested is (and it's nothing unique): two fresh walleye fillets (per person)...place in aluminum foil with a little olive oil or coat generously with melted butter and a bit of lemon juice. Top with sliced green, red, orange, and yellow peppers. Top again with sliced onion. Top again with sautéed mushrooms. If you have some cherry tomatoes to add...that is good too. Sliced zucchini also adds nicely. Season with your favorite seasoning...we like Tony's, Lowry's, or Old Bay (I suggest seasoning the fillets first). Wrap tight in Aluminum foil. Place on hot grill for 15 minutes. Serve with rice. It's not steak and Lobster...but it ain't too shabby. What makes this ""hit the mark""? I would have to say fresh caught walleye in Canada, that has been taken care of, cleaned with care, and prepared with care....it's tough to present anything much better! There is something about the freshness... the purity, the ultra clean flavor, the texture.....it will always ""hit the high mark"" with us!Just in case you're wondering....we fry it almost every day too!"
