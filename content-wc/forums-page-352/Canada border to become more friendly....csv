So then we have to ask ourseves why so many would perceive the ""interview"" as being true! Over the years, my experiences with these officials have generally been about 99% on the professional side, they have a job to do. Crossing over at Rainy River a few weeks ago, the lady was not only professional, but extremely attractive. I think the guys in the car ahead of me turned around just so they could go through again! (Just kidding!) (About the turn around part.) Bill"

2174857,steve.a,2013-10-19 15:01:00,274,"I have been going for several years in june and september and I will say that they seem a lot more friendly but still very serious. I would say that they can see quickly of our past comings and goings on the computer and that helps. I would think that they deal with a lot of a-holes and to be the next person in line you might get a officer that is less than sweet. This goes on both sides of the border. We should be glad that they do there job the same as a fireman, policeman, or military personel."

It's not a real discussion about the border.

2174881,Shellback,2013-10-19 15:18:00,8083,"This was a joke, right? As a US resident traveling to Canada, I've never felt a Canadian border guard was rude. Some more friendly than others, but no one was ever rude. Now coming back to the states, I've had some down right rude US border guards."
2175289,2746,2013-10-19 20:10:00,3206,In over 50 crossings that has been our experience as well. If we hear rude or arrogant it's always been the US boys and I've never been able to figure that out.
