2165329,jaleonard,2013-10-14 13:10:00,29,"I've been to Canadian Fly-In over the years. I think it is in your budget, fish and miles. Do not confuse it with another Canadian Fly In that tries to trick you using their name. These guys are the originals who started the fly-in business.http://www.canadianflyinfishing.net/ I've been there 5 times, sometimes the same lake, other times other lakes. I've made friends over the years that have been with this outfitter for over 30 years, sometimes going twice a year - wish I could."
2178049,Hurkaman,2013-10-21 15:03:00,6,"Check out Esnagami Lodge. I've never been there myself, but I have people I know go up there every year. They do a modified all inclusive, breakfast, box lunch. They do all their own suppers since they don't want to be tied to the dinner bell if they're on top of fish. I've talked to the owner many times, and if you give him your food/drink order, he will fly it up a day in advance, for only $100 and the cost of the food. The website is www.esnagami.com, and there's all kinds of pics of various prize winners. They used to give a free trip back for the largest catch and release walleye and pike, not sure if they still do. The all inclusive is in the $1500 price range."

2125866,phishfearme,2013-09-24 18:36:00,1242,I'm planning for a retaliatory avatar but for some reason my system won't let me. it's probably a plot by someone in or near the mistake on the lake. phish
2125898,deputy dog,2013-09-24 18:42:00,305,"I did mine so long ago I forget how I did it....listening to buccos rite now. Made the playoffs for 1st time in 21 yrs.....LETS GO BUCS!!!! Btw, leaning toward pym island with Hearst air, no American plan but looks like monster pike and in our price range. Anyone been?"
2128050,phishfearme,2013-09-25 16:18:00,1242,"they fixed my access and now I have an avatar - kinda too small to see clearly - may have to use a different one - but this one is sooooo emblematic of a Canadian fishing trip, in spite of the subjects."
2129313,Jack77,2013-09-26 08:36:00,168,Check out Brace Lake Outfitters. Big Pike fishing and great walleye fishing. I have been there and I don't think you will be disappointed. Should be in your price range also. I have been with Air Ivanhoe and would pick Brace Lake over them every time for both fishing and accomadations.http://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com/index.html
2153610,deputy dog,2013-10-07 17:59:00,305,Unfortunately pym island fell through. Appreciate all the input so far and all suggestions look good..... Still looking tho so keep them coming!!
2153906,adempsey,2013-10-07 19:39:00,963,"Here's a few places I think that would be worth getting some info/feedback on for trophy pike fishing:Air Ivanhoe - Rush LakeHearst Air - McLeister LakeIgnace Outposts - Flindt Lake, Metionga Lake, Seseganaga LakeMattice Lake Outfitters - Whitewater Lake, Weese LakeCanada Outfitters - Unexpected LakeTrue North Outfitters - Musk LakePipestone Fly-Ins - Kenoji Lake, Smoothrock Lake, Wabakimi LakeShowalters Fly-Ins - Irwin LakeGateway North Outfitters - Grant Lake"
2154226,John N,2013-10-08 02:45:00,362,"www.oldpost.com - very comfortable, might hit all your requirements. Been there with groups over many years, excellent fishery and camp. John"
2154346,deputy dog,2013-10-08 06:45:00,305,"thanks for the replies!! old post looks great but too far of a drive for our group. been going to nakina which is a 17 hour drive and about our limit. thanks adempsey for the choices, some of the outfitters weight limits are 100lbs which is hard for our group to hit usually because of ""beverages"" so i'm still looking. eddienorth flew our beer in early which was a huge help and nakina air was at 150 lbs per person. keep em comin!!!!!"
2157906,allbright,2013-10-09 16:59:00,35,"Our family enjoys Halley's Camps, www.halleyscamps.com The Halley family are wonderful people, the lodges are great and they have many outposts including some specific for pike. Can't recommend them enough."
2114538,deputy dog,2013-09-19 19:37:00,305,"hoping to tap into all that knowledge out there. my group of 6 is looking to possibly change things up next year. ideal trip would be 16 hours from Cleveland in either northwestern/northeastern Ontario or quebec. fly-in or boat in. trophy pike a must with enough 'eyes to eat and pass the time. prefer American plan and only lodge on lake. price range of $1500. wanting to try all inclusive while dad and uncle have a few trips left in them. as always, most important thing is valid chance at 40""+ pike. fire away boys, looking forward to looking into all suggestions. 2 I have come across so far is air Ivanhoe and granite hill lodge. as always thanks in advance!!!!!!"
2116234,adempsey,2013-09-20 14:09:00,963,"The one place I can think of that meets most of your requirements would be Kesagami Wilderness Lodge. Problem is though, it's outside your budget by quite a bit.My guess is you might have to give up something - spend more, drive further, no AP and/or outpost instead of lodge. However, your best bet would be to book your trip after ice out or in Sept/Oct for a better chance at a trophy. I think that might open up more options that meet your requirements."
2116274,onetimedave,2013-09-20 14:18:00,502,"We have traveled to this outfitter for the past 17+ years. Great people, cabins, boats, motors and most of all, fishing. Many pike over 40 with the largest being 46"". A pic is in the gallery. We live 30 minutes South of Canton and total trip is about 21 hours. Already booked for Melchett Lake for 2014. Any questions email to [email protected]. Give me a phone number and I will call your answers. Have many personal marked maps of most of their lakes."
2116794,phishfearme,2013-09-20 18:55:00,1242,"if you like to experience the best in bush comfort, privacy and true trophy pike/walleye - and you're willing to do your own cooking (and enjoy fresh walleye) you may want to consider kearns lake with thousand lake outfitters - it may be just a bit out side of the 16 hour drive spec but this place is really special. see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=kearns phish"
2117162,deputy dog,2013-09-20 21:32:00,305,"Train in is also doable.....nemogodsenda(sp) also looked interesting. Anyone experience this outfitter. Time of year not important but prefer late June early July for stable water levels. Will check those out when I get home. Am in Michigan, which hurts being a buckeye fan, doin rusty Wallace driving experience at the speedway this weekend. Been watching some Ricky bobby vids to get ready:-) Wish me luck!!"
2117722,tooski,2013-09-21 11:00:00,393,Buckeye fan that roots for the Squealers... you must be bi-polar....
2117762,deputy dog,2013-09-21 11:35:00,305,"40 mins west of the burgh......easy on ""squealer"" thing....gonna b loooong season!!!"
2117882,tooski,2013-09-21 12:45:00,393,You're talking to a Browns fan. Loooong seasons are the norm. Looong decades actually. Doesn't Phish look nice in his Browns gear in my avatar?
2119306,phishfearme,2013-09-22 08:27:00,1242,"although the Steelers are off to a poor start, us hard-cores don't quit! although it has really been fun watching the Pirates. pure parking chaos tonight in the 'burg - Steelers and Pirates play in town with only a short time offset between the games. by the way, how are you guys able to select a custom avatar? I used to have one and it's still my profile photo but my ""edit avatar"" section doesn't allow selecting a custom photo??? wtf? phish"
2123185,octanehi5,2013-09-23 18:49:00,1104,"May I suggest, Air Tamarac in Quebec,You have a choice of going to the Gouin,lac Hebert, lac Charolet, The gouin has lots of walleye and about as big a pike as you will find anywhere 50"" 40s"" no problem, Lac Hebert Is one of Quebec's walleye factories, pike to 46"" have been caught by our group.Lac Charolet lots of big Walleye and Pike, with only one camp on the lac. Look them up on the net. You need to bring and cook your own food at the $1500 price range.I have been going to Hebert for the last 10 seasons, this last july our group of 6 guys caught,2250 walleye's and 150 pike. I set a personal best this yr at just over 900 in 7 days of fishing. these are all fly in lakes.no drive to ,never crowded. You would be hard pressed to find a better place.new cabins 16'lunds with20 hp, hot and cold running water."
