1225068,Guest,2010-08-04 12:30:00,0,"Just got back from the chapleau lodge. Fishing report is a bunch of contradictions. We did not pull in very many and we fished hard early and late (13 hr days). A few people on the water we spoke also did not get that many. However the people running chapleau lodge were talking solid numbers but we did not see them. So for what its worth from assessing the fishing cleaning table and our experience .. there was good numbers of small mouth bass 7-10 off rocky points you can hit 20-30/hr during the day night crawlers float headed jigs but you can do that in the USA. Walleye and northern pikes a lot tougher. During the day the fishing was generally really quiet other than the small mouth bass. We did hit some good size Walleye 22-25"" off rocky points 20-30 feet water around cabin island. But it was otherwise a bust. Early morning (5am) and late evening at the grass lands which is at the other end of the lake is probably the only real spot at the moment to guarantee a catch. Trawling and also drifting across grass beds we hit walleye and northern pike on night crawlers and minnows. We had much better success with minnows walleye were 15-19 and northern pike ~24. There was a lot of talk by the chapleau lodge of big northerns but they must have taken vacation during our visit. So if your looking for 8-12 small mouth you can do ok during the day. but if your looking for bigger walleye and northern pike in numbers it will be a real challenge.. only real chance in late evening on the grassbeds. Scenery and location is sensational. Important point: The boats at Chapleau Lodge do not have a fish or depth finder. Make sure you bring one to enable you to find all the rocky outcrops. This may have contributed to our low numbers."

1225150,jow,2010-08-04 17:47:00,20,"Take a little side trip to Lake Sample,Lake Tenor. I think Tenor only has pike,my son boated a 41"" last summer there. Sample is a really good walleye lake.Especially if there is a NW wind blowing the bait fish to the south end of the lake.We bow mount trolled one afternoon with these conditions and caught fish after fish. Shoot me a pm if ya need any info.Lures used for NorthernsWilliams spoons (the one painted like a frog for pike)Big money swim baitsDouble tail Mr.twister tails WhiteWalleyeLive Target smeltLive target perchLive target herringAny silver worm rigged wacky worked good when sunny choppy.We stayed at moosehorn lodge and the accommodations where great."
1225171,Wall_Eye,2010-08-04 18:57:00,28,Thanks jowI checked out there web site looks fan tastic I will check out the lakes you mentioned if possiable while we are there.
1225260,jow,2010-08-05 06:13:00,20,"No probIn the pics of last year the guy holding the big pike is me,jr didnt wanna hold it for a pic. But in other pics he's holding a few stringers of walleye.Casting a jig and minnow also worked great btw."
1231892,Wall_Eye,2010-08-30 21:59:00,28,"I just got back from my first Candaian fishing experiance.We were on Borden Lake staying at Chapleau Lodge.Being my first time on a trip like this I dont have any thing to compare to but I could not have asked for much more.The cabin was great they made sure our boat was always full of gas,that we always had enough night crawlers on hand,they personaly took us to spots on the lake and showed us how they catch fish.They let me use there phone on there dime to keep a check on my business at home.Between 3 of us we caught 100's of small mouth bass with the largest being 19"" alot of 15 to 17 inchers and a lot of 10 to 14 inchers,on walleye we kept count and caught 240 for the week with the largest being 26"" not to many over 20"" but most were 15 to 19 inchers.We did not catch any pike on Borden but realy did not target them there,my nephew knew of a remote pike lake near there and the lodge let us take on of there extra boats and a small out board(at no extra charge) and we caught 20 pike with the largest being 38 inches and all over 25 inches. So to sum it up the lodge bent over backwards to make sure we had what we wanted and needed,we caught a lot of fish had a lot of good times,if there was anything that didn't live up to what I expected it would be that we did not catch any realy big fish but every thing else I feel made up for that.I want to thank every on on this thread for your help in giving me a trip of a life time"

If all possible, bring your own fishing equipment. Have a great trip and enjoy a camp fire, or even a steam in the sonia!"
1228247,Guest,2010-08-16 17:19:00,0,"Just got back from Chapleau this past Friday. First time there. Beautiful scenery and wildlife(saw some eagles, beavers, and loons; Borden is aka Loon Lake) The weather was unseasonably warm according to lodge locals. (upper 80's and sunny, no humidity, only one day that could be called overcast). First, the boring stuff: cabins were clean, full kitchens, nothing fancy, plenty of hot water. Two bedroom cabin sleeps six. Each bedroom has a single bed and set of bunkbeds. Bring your own towels, washcloths, and paper products. Pretty satisfied with the accomodations (you're there to fish). Note: the lodge sits back in the woods about 2 miles off route 129. The signs guiding you are small blue arrows with ""Chapleau Lodge"" written on them and they are tacked on to trees. If you arrive late in the day it may be hard to see them. The boats are aluminum with swivel seats and ten horse motors. The motors are well taken care of (1st pull starts every time) but a little under powered on a lake this size. Many of prime spots are opposite end of lake and take 20-30min to reach. It's good that you're taking a depth finder, you'll need it, especially if you want to catch walleye. Now, the interesting stuff: average depth of the lake is 20+ feet, with 1 or 2 spots reaching 100+, and several shallow rock flats that stick out of the water(marked by bleach bottle ""buoys""). The lake is very clear(when the sun is high, you can see the bottom of much of the lake). The lake has many islands ranging in size from a golf green to over a football field. The lodge provides a laminated map of the lake with prime areas marked. My fishing partner and I did not have a depth finder, but still managed to catch good numbers of smallmouth (50+/day) in the 10-12in range but only a handfull of any over 14in. We targeted shallow, rocky shorelines with steep dropoffs into deeper water. Even better when it occurred between two islands creating a channel with moving water(the lake was very calm in the a.m. but when the sun got up and the wind got moving, then you'd get some water moving). We threw mainly lead jigs with powerbait grubs (color didn't seem to matter as we experimented with several) Only managed a couple on crankbaits and this occured only after a hooked one brought in followers. Otherwise, they would follow the crank all the wat to the boat and then leave. Didn't even get any on nightcrawler/bobber but then didn't fish it a lot. We managed a few walleye and two pike(small) while fishing for smallies. Would have liked to fish more for pike but not the right time of year according to lodge. Not much grass/weeds/vegetation in the grassy areas marked on lodge map for pike. Walleye fishing during our trip seemed to be concentrated in large bay off the main lake. Water depth here was in 50-60ft range with fish gathering on humps in 19-20ft range. They were caught in our group vertical jigging lead head jig tipped with nightcrawler on these 19ft humps (partner and I didn't fish this because we didn't have depthfinder and aren't much interested in walleye fishing) Other fishermen at the lodge had success with this as well as trolling. Greatest success was just before dark (lodge boats don't have lights) Those at lodge with their own boats caught fish after dark but not sure if anyone stayed out late. All in all, happy with the numbers caught. Would have liked some bigger fish. And some pike. According to lodge, the high pressure system that week was big factor in numbers as well as size. Can't do anything about the weather. Also, not much to do during the day if not fishing. Some in our group went into town and said there are no bars and alcohol at the store very expensive. Was there to fish so didn't care. Only reason I wouldn't go back is the long drive. Hope this helps."
1228282,Wall_Eye,2010-08-16 20:07:00,28,"Thanks 1st timer for the exceptional detail in your report,it is going to be very helpful for us 1st timers. The accomodations sound like what we are expecting,not looking a 5 star hotel.Sounds like you had a great time although not the quality of smallmouth you were looking for.We will be mainly targeting walleye but will fish for SM and Pike during off peak walleye times.Looking foward to a great week of fishing thanks again."
