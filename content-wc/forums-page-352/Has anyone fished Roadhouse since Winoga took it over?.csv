I know his daughter Kim now has the cabin. Wondering what kind of shape the cabin is in now that it is almost 20 years old? How is the fishing? We used to get good numbers, but the fish were in the 14-17 inch range. Rarely would we get a walleye over 21"". We are thinking of going back in the summer of 2014 but would like some reports."

2165305,PhilTickelson,2013-10-14 13:01:00,84,"I have fished Winoga a few times but it was probably 6 years ago now. Customer service was good, but not over the top. We were able to stay at one of their Abram's Lake cabins the night before in Sioux Lookout and then fly the next morning(would probably depend on availability). I've fished both Carling and Raggedwood, both lakes are loaded with walleye, average size was probably a little bigger on Carling. Biggest walleyes were 25"" on both lakes(that we caught), we caught bigger pike at Carling as well(biggest was a fat 13#s while jigging for walleye). A seemingly unlimited number of 16-18"" walleye at both locations though. I didn't count total fish but in our 4 days of fishing my buddy and I had 85 doubles! That's not an exaggeration, there were 85 times in 4 days where we were both reeling in fish. I wouldn't say go to either of these lakes if you are looking for a trophy, but if you are looking for numbers then you'd do well here. If you are up for the journey on Carling, the boat ride to Mask(Masque?) Lake was well worth it, ridiculous numbers of walleye in that small lake. Carling also has lake trout, we caught a few, none were super big but it's fun to catch something besides a walleye after awhile . The cabins were simple, nothing fancy. I've heard they made improvements to Raggedwood recently though. At the time they both had outdoor outhouses. LOTS of mosquitos at both locations made outdoor bathrooming less than comfortable at times. They didn't run check flights or anything when we were up there, but they did have a satelite phone you could rent. Both times it was 'see you at the end of the week, if you have trouble put a white bedsheet out on the dock and if another float plane pilot sees it he will let us know/stop down'."
2165945,Walleye-Piker,2013-10-14 19:10:00,3,"I have been fishing Roadhouse for 30 years. Even though it is not owned by Knobby's, things have not changed with the fishing aspect. Walleyes are plentiful and Northerns are big! Last year was an average year for my group of 10 guys. We caught 2500 Walleyes and 300 Northerns in 5 days. Largest Walley was 25 1/2"" and largest Northern was 45"".As to the the cabins since Winoga Lodge took over there has been numerous upgrades. Some of the examples are....2 refridges, on demand hot water, new 15 horse motors, new fishing cleaning shack with running water, screened in porch, boat ramps with winches, new large deep freeze and many more upgrades. Winoga Lodge also uses Slate Falls Airways and utilize the Turbo Otters for most trips.There is a reason why my group of ten continue to return to Roadhouse for the fabulous fishing, accomadations and customer service."
2177257,Roddy,2013-10-21 07:41:00,488,This is good to know. We were always impressed with the service when Knobby's ran the outpost. I believe Knobby's daughter Kim and her husband run the outpost now. I just wanted to make sure the cabin was still in good shape and that winoga still provided good service. thanks
