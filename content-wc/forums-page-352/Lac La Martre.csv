2170626,Mike Kansas,2013-10-17 07:15:00,1463,"I have been looking at Lac La Martre for years. It looks like one of those ""Bucket List"" destinations that a fisherman should experience. I have talked to several who have been there in the past and they all spoke highly of the results they had. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

Long day of travel from where you will start, you will overnight in Yellowknife. Nice lodge nothing special, good food, no issues there! Boats are large, 50 horse, casting platform i the front! You are there for the fishing, the lake is large, about 55 miles long/round and rather shallow, being deepest around 30 feet. It depends on what you are after, it has either lake trout or Pike. You will normally fish an eight hour day, if you want to fish after dinner, it is extra and you must be guided at all times. If you want Pike, the lake is cystral clear and if you go early in the season you can sight flsh with flyrod or cast. You look first, then decide if that one is large enough to try for. Trophy fish can be had at any time. Lake trout is a trolling game, use the largest believer, 15 to 20 lbs very normal! You can go after numbers or trophies, or choice. Weather does play a factor, because the lake is open, if high winds occur, you may loose a day of fishing"

2174297,phishfearme,2013-10-19 08:13:00,1242,"after what you wrote, I don't need to go to ""not think about Ontario the same way again"" - i'd only appreciate Ontario even more!! ""long day(s) of EXPENSIVE travel"" ""no walleye"" ""lodge is nothing special"" ""must be guided at all times"" ""evening fishing is extra"" ""high winds - loose a day (or more?) of fishing"" and i'm sure the price would cover MANY Ontario trips thanks for the truthful report. phish"
