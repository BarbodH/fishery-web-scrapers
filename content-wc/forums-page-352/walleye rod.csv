2182842,elkman99,2013-10-24 06:19:00,180,"Thanks for all the great info guys. I think I'm leaning towards a 6'6"" ML fast action rod. It seems to be a pretty popular choice on here for what I'll be using it for. I'm kinda partial to plueger reels, so I'll probably pair it with one of those. Not sure what model yet, but keep the suggestion coming. this is great stuff!"
2182930,port1042,2013-10-24 07:17:00,509,"I went with a St. Croix Premier 6'6"" Light (PS66LF2). I use the 2-piece because it's much easier to travel with. I matched it with a Pflueger Purist (1325X). I also have a couple of Pflueger Presidents which I also like, but I got a great deal on the Purist and it's a wonderful reel. Here's the trick. A couple of times a year Gander Mountain offers a rebate on St. Croix rods. Last year it was $30.00 off the Premier. Then I found a really good deal at Sheels on the Purist -- $30.00 off on that. That brought the total cost of whole package to less that $140.00 and shipping was free when ordered on-line. I spooled this outfit with #6 Trilene XL. The fancy lines just seem to be too fussy (and expensive) for me. I caught a lot of nice fish in two trips to Canada last year. I never felt I lost one because of line choice and I'm not looking back. While walleye fishing I landed a 37"" northern on this set-up. #6 Trilene and no leader. I always said I'd rather be lucky than good!"
2183066,kzoofisher,2013-10-24 07:56:00,5144,"Line choice is a personal preference, if you don't jig a lot the extra sensitivity might be a help and the no stretch does get you harder hook sets. Is it worth the extra cost for occaisional fishing? Your call. It throws farther but that's meaningless for vertical jigging. It's not a life and death decision so I'd just pick a line and replace it with something else the next year if you don't like it."
2176033,ftfarms,2013-10-20 11:05:00,444,No on the braided line on my walleye reels. I went though that phase won't go back. It has great feel but I like mono. I have it on my musky reels also. I think it's more of a personal thing when it comes to line.
2176233,wallydave,2013-10-20 13:26:00,2151,"On Lac Seul braid has worked well jigging for walleyes in the spring. In August on Red Lake braid just didn't seem to work at all. Switched rigs with Mike Kansas using his wife's St Croix med with fast tip and mono made all the difference in the world! I had been moving to braid, now I will be bringing both along!"
2176345,JayM5209,2013-10-20 15:35:00,1050,"For 1% of your fishing time one time per year . . . save some dollars to buy additional musky baits. Get yourself a 6'6"" ML Fenwick, a Pflueger President (the 2500 size), and a spool of 6# or 8# Trilene XL. You'll never miss the St. Croix and you'll catch all the walleyes you need for the skillet.Just my $.02 worth, but then my ML Fenwicks are the only rods I use for 'eye jigging.P.S. If you haven't already done so, watch a couple of the videos Limeyangler has posted on this sight. I'm pretty sure that's not a St. Croix rod that brings him all his walleye fishing success on Lac Seul!"
2176425,elkman99,2013-10-20 16:39:00,180,"Thanks Jay, I'll be sure to give them a look. We can never have too many musky baits!! LOL"
2177265,BornToFish,2013-10-21 07:54:00,1224,"If I were to ask one hundred knowledgeable walleye anglers at my preferred fishing lodge in Canada as to which rod they preferred to use, about fifty would say a Medium Lite power rod. The other fifty anglers would say a Lite power rod. A sizeable majority of these anglers would say St. Croix.I believe the ML and L fishing rods are great choices for walleye fishing rods. It comes down to a trade-off in my opinion. The Lite power rod has fantastic sensitivity for feeling bottom and the bite in deeper water. The ML offers better control over bigger fish.I exclusively use a St. Croix LES70LF. I use Shimano spinning reels - Saros, Stradics and Sustain models. All of these reels have six pound monofilament as the main line, with a eighteen fLuorocarbon leader tied to a small ball bearing or barrel swivel to minimize line twist. I favor monofilament over braid for two reasons. One is the stretch of the line when I encounter a really heavy fish. The other is that the fish can feel me when using braid just as well as me feeling the fish.When it's all said and done, it comers down to personal preference. If your brain is happy, you will most likely catch fish."
2178473,kzoofisher,2013-10-21 18:11:00,5144,"Very true. I generally prefer lighter rods because the waters I fish most often are very clear, visibility to 20' and deeper, so I need to make long casts. I use braid with a floro leader for casting and mono with heavier rods for trolling. Not a very surprising mix of gear, I'm sure. Rods are Fenwick's, Shimano's and St. Croix's, reels are Penn's, Pflueger's, Quantum's and Shimano's."
2179322,BornToFish,2013-10-22 07:36:00,1224,"I posted some thoughts above about walleye rods. I summarize that posting as take your pick between Medium Lite versus Lite power rods for ""in-hand"" fishing of walleyes. Each power rod has its unique advantages. I've found that UltraLite power rods lack in ""spine"" to reliably set the hook into the roof of a walleye's mouth. I've found that Medium power and heavier rods lack in sensitivity to feel the lake's bottom and the bite.I've noticed many ""threads"" on chatrooms that speak to brand of fishing reel for use when fishing walleyes. The proverbial ""pros"" and ""cons"" of various brands and their pricepoints. I want to introduce a different point for others to consider and comment: the size of the reel's frame.I've noticed over the years that the reel's frame size (e.g. 750, 1000, 1500, 2500, .... series) can make a difference in the performance of the fishing rod that I use to fish walleyes. I've found that too large a frame reel changes the way the fishing rod behaves in my hand - sort of turning the rod/reel combination into a club. In other words, an angler can mount a too large top-of-the-line fishing reel on a top-of-the-line fishing rod and turn the combo into something much less than he/she expects.For me, a reel is properly matched to my fishing rod when the rod/reel feels as though it disappears in my hand - the weight of the reel offsets the weight of the rod when my hand is the pivot point. The rod and reel are perfectly balanced with one another such that I have peak sensitivity to feel the lake's bottom and the walleye's bite. I learned to recognize this feeling of the rod and reel disappearing in my hand by fishing with many rod and reel combinations that weren't properly balanced with one another - sort of trial and error in the beginning.I commented in my previous post on this ""thread"" that I use a variety of Shimano fishing reels (Symetre, Saros, Stardic and Sustain) fishing reels with my St. Croix LES70LF fishing rods. All of the fishing reels have 1000 series frames. The size and weight of these reels optimally balance on my fishing rods. I'm confident that my rod and reel combinations are delivering peak performance for me.I conclude by saying that whatever fishing rod and reel an angler uses, he or she will catch fish if his/her brain is happy. I simply offer a point to ponder when selecting a fishing rod or reel to purchase.Good fishing!!"
2179866,Shorelunch,2013-10-22 14:03:00,554,"I'd personally go with a 6' 6"" Fenwick HMG or HMX medium or ML rod with a Shimano Symetre. Nice set up and is versatile to boot. I like Suffix 832 or Fireline with a 6' flouro leader."

Good fishing!![/QUOTE] I agree that the balance of the rod/reel is one of the most important to me.I like a combo that balances on your trigger finger with out any other grip on the the rod.If it is front/tip heavy ,I tape lead on the butt of the rod until I find that balance that I want.Sometimes when fish are just holding bait,lure in their mouth,you can detect the slight movement by balancing your rod on 1 finger.You can detect the slightest movement.Sometimes I balance the rod and just barely raise and lower the rod with my arm.If the tip stays down chances are there is a fish just ""holding"" the bait.The slight move usually won`t cause the fish to drop the bait."

2169641,elkman99,2013-10-16 15:24:00,180,"I am in the market for a new walleye rod to use on my annual canadian fishing trip next year. We musky fish 99% of time, but occassionally like to wet a line for walleye. Normally we simply jig fish. I am looking at a Legend Tournament St. Croix ML 7' Fast action rod to get for next year. Any other suggestions for a good jigging rod would be great, plus any suggestions on a good solid reel to go with it would be a big help. thanks!"
2170466,zeebee,2013-10-17 05:52:00,1144,"When it comes to jigging the priority for tackle lies firstly with line (6-8 lbs braid), secondly with rod ..I like a 6' to 6'6"" fast taper quality carbon set-up, and lastly with a light spinning reel like a mid range Shimano or Pflueger. Given that you don't spend a lotta time chasing eyes why go overboard on expensive tackle just to put some meat on the pan."
2170834,elkman99,2013-10-17 09:13:00,180,"Thanks zeebee. I have always used 6lb vanish on my walleye rod,but have always considered puting braid on it. The only reason I will probably get a legend rod is because I have access to get a great deal on one, otherwise I'd prolly go with a lesser model. However, I am always kind of the mindset that spending money on a good setup once will keep me from having to buy lots of crappy ones. (thats what I tell my wife anyways LOL)"
2171338,milfish,2013-10-17 12:42:00,249,"Elkman,The St Croix you just mentioned is exactly the rod I purchased after my lac Seul trip in 2012. A bit pricey but well worth it. I also purchased the $20 St Croix reel offered when purchasing the rod at the factory store in Park Falls Wi. What a great combo!! Spooled it with 8# Sufix 832 and loved it. I caught 475 walleyes on the trip this year with 90% on this combo. I'm going to buy another one for sure. Also the replacement guarantee is well worth the extra money. A buddy broke his St Croix in Canada 2012, stepped on it, and that's why we went to the factory store to get it replaced. I believe it was about 5 years old and they gave him 70% off the purchase price of a new rod to cover the replacement. I guess that's a pro-rated warranty but still really good in my opinion. The rods are super sensitive, have 10 eyelets and very light. You can feel the most subtle bites, and even be able to feel the different type of bottom easily with this rod.Milfish"
2174785,Jigger1,2013-10-19 14:22:00,234,"Bought the LegendXtreme 6’3”, paired it with a Pfleuger Patriarch and love this combo.
