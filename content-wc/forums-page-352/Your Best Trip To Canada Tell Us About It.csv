Besides the fishing being great year after year and the cabin and service being awesome the best thing is the guys I go with. This will be I think our 30th year and it is so nice to see all the guys there. It is about the only time we see each other every year because we are from all over the country. The stories are unending and there is plenty of joking and laughing at each other and ourselves. We have all watched each others familys grow up and celebrated the good times and prayed for each other during bad times. True friendship shared is an awesome gift and I truly feel blessed to be a part of it with them. Mike Kansas

Caught more fish than average - esp Walleyes including a 28"" - even got into some Whitefish and Smallmouths. The Pike seemed to be everywhere with a lot of aggressive slot fish. The weather was perfect - not a drop of rain the entire week. And to top it off, we got to see one of the most impressive displays of the Northern Lights we had ever seen.Add in some cold beer, some crispy fried Walleye, friends and family - doesn't get any better!"

Northern......Eddies Beteau Lake, full of trophies, had my first 40in in under 3hrs on the lake. Our best trip was a houseboat on Lac Seul with 6 guys........what a blast."

No gas , bug infested dirty cabin etc. Sad part is I see myself going less . Spending almost $1000 for gas and motel to get there is getting harder to swollow . Add in $3300 for the outfitter for my self and my wife ,makes for exprnsive trip. Bought a cabin in northern Michigan along with 44 acres ,will be most of my future vacations . For the cost of the fly in ,I can spend numerous weeks at the cabin,paying for my gas to get there and back along with , the property taxes ,insurance and electric bill.. At this point in life the time away at the cabin vs a week long fly in will fill my needs . I will still do a fly in but not 2 and 3 a year. My friends quit going with me ,when the prices went up. They now bow hunt more at home and go to Boundry Waters."

2172785,packpro,2013-10-18 09:01:00,695,"This will be my 15th year. The best trip was the one that my Dad and brother made. My dad taught me how to fish and enjoy the outdoors. He had the best fishing experience of his life. He told all of his friends about the trip. That trip is a topic of conversation every time I visit. The weather was perfect that week. All the flashback memories of previous days on the water made that trip special. As for my brother, it was also his best fishing experience. At various times during that week we laughed so hard our sides would hurt. They both caught their personal best walleye, and we had great numbers everyday. The fishing was great, but the experience was priceless."
2177881,Whopper,2013-10-21 12:43:00,340,"How was your early trip this year? The same group I went with last year where you met me on the dock were very happy with the catching this year, lot's of big fish caught. They did however have some trouble with a bear in camp."
2178697,Blades-n-Beads,2013-10-21 19:51:00,484,"Love to read others stories!! Have to throw mine in there. I have fished for eyes many years and have never layed a 10+ lb eye in the bottom of my boat, came close many times but just never happened. This past year I took my wife of 29 years and my daughter age 16 to lake of the woods north end for there very first Canada fishing trip at a very nice resort. Fishing was great, weather was warm, and my wife netted my first 10.5 lb walleye. She netted it like a 30 year pro. Still can't believe it happened. By far my most memorable trip with 2 very special people in my life. Neither my wife or daughter wanted that trip to end. I have to agree. Special places like Canada and there people make special moments to remember forever . Note: a return trip next summer,same place, same time, same loved ones is in the works."
2179610,vteye,2013-10-22 11:10:00,812,"Right out of college my cousin and I chartered a flight Rochester NY to Pangnirtung via Sept iles PQ, Fort Chimo and then on to Pangnirtung. At Pang we hiked, camped, did 2 drop off char trips and still retelling story of getting caught in sea ice while jigging. Summer extent of sea ice is now 800 miles north of this trip in 1984. A couple of times we saw beluga whales in shallow chasing char and thought at a distance we had incomingpolar bear. Char ran to 10 pounds with average 3-5 pounds."
2179858,Carnhzkr,2013-10-22 13:40:00,964,"Like many others on this site, I started going on Canadian fishing trips with my parents, as a young boy. Since that time, there have been very few years when I didn't cross the US/Canada border at least once. I've taken my family of four the past eight years, and still make one trip with my parents, who are now in their 80s. Every time I get back home for a visit, the conversation always returns to the various adventures we've experienced on these numerous fishing trips. What's funny is that the best memories are not from what you might consider ""the best"" trips. The stories that tend to get told over and over most likely seemed disastrous at the time, but those are the memories that stand out. Highlights from some of our most popular memories include:The time when the water pump went out on our pickup in northern Manitoba, 35 miles from the nearest town. A passing trucker gave my dad a lift into Grand Rapids, then back to our truck, then back into GR, and again back to our truck after they realized they had the wrong water pump.The time when a plank sticking up in the road tore open the fuel tank in our car. My dad fashioned the 5 gal outboard tank in the trunk and we used that to make the 800 mile trip home. I still remember the look on the face of the service station attendants when we stopped for fuel every 80 miles.The time, many years ago, when camping on an island near Kettle Falls, Ontario, when wind came up and waves soaked our outboard. After several days being stranded, Mr. Halley, of Halley's Camps rescued us by giving us a tow back to their lodge.The stories go on and on. None of those were ""the best"" trip at the time, but looking back now, they sure do make the best memories."
