It was a lodge that offered a one day fly in package for dinner. They fly you in and out on the same day.Can't remember the name of the lodge, but I believe it is on a fairly large lake, and it's a lake that I believe I have seen featured on Midwest Outdoors TV in the past. Good walleye lake IIRC.Does this lake / lodge ring a bell with anybody??? Any info you could provide would be appreciated. I know I will recognize the name of the lake / lodge when I hear it.Thanks in advance for any insight!""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
2178593,BreezyPoint,2013-10-21 19:10:00,1581,I am guessing this is Excellent Adventures out of Ear Falls. I think I saw that same ad...fly to Trout Lake for dinner.
2180322,jackpotjohnny48,2013-10-22 18:40:00,153,"Thanks, Breezypoint. Yes, that's it. Cat Island Lodge on Trout Lake. Thinking about maybe doing that next year, and would appreciate feedback from anyone who has done that before.""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
2180585,BreezyPoint,2013-10-22 22:14:00,1581,"About a month ago, I filled out Excellent Adventures contact form about a fly-in trip for next year and they never responded to me. As a result, I am looking elsewhere as they don't seem to need the business. If you contact them, I would be interested to know what your experience is."

2180802,Rlcrouse,2013-10-23 06:07:00,286,Been using them for twelve years and can't complain. Joyce and Faron are good people and will take care of you. Always did the outposts and can't comment on Cat Island Lodge. The outposts are pretty nice so I imagine the lodge will be even better.
