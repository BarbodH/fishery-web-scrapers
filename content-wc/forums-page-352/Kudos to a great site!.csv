I go to Canada for 10 days every year and almost exclusively musky fish, but usually wet a line for walleye for an hour or two every trip (it's almost a sin to go to canada and not walleye fish a little right?!). As much as I love musky fishing, I still find it really neat to get that tug on the line from a Canadian walleye. Anyways, this is by far my favorite fishing website. Nearly 99% of the time people are very curtious, informative, and helpful. I find it very refreshing to come to a site and not have the administrator/owner of it shove sponsors down your throat, or be condescending (unlike a very popular musky site). Unfortunately some of my musky brethren act as pompous, elitest as well. When I was 12 years old, my neighbors were nice enough to take me to Canada 3 times on vacation with them. The first Canadian Lakes I fished were Florence, Lac Seul, and Wabaskang and they were all packed with walleye, and made for some great memories. I have loved the Great North ever since! Anyways, to all of those who run this site and participate in it, Kudos to you!!"

Lot's of great people participate here......Scott started and ran an outstanding site for years (of course with help from others) which many of us have benefited from for knowledge and laughs (not necessarily in that order - especially in the dead of winter). Faith, Family, Friends....and Fishing. Rich B"

It is too bad it is the best musky forum. I'm surprised it doesn't lose popularity simply because of him. This is a great site that others could learn from."
