Personally I have never been there but i have read some good reviews. Just wondering if anyone has been there recently and have any recommendations for us. Hoping to catch lots of walleye and some giant Pike. Anyone have some good spots or lures that worked for them over there? Thanks in advance!!"

Normally all spawning waters are closed for the season opener but I think by 6/1 you should be OK...Jean can tell you that.That area is very good in the spring and all the areas out to the larger baie opening should be excellent. I have fished there around that time and always did good. I haven't stayed at that cabin as I came in from baie Adolphe-Poisson. Have fun.PS: You should ask the admin here to move your post to the ""Canada forum"" as this will get buried real fast here in the ""general""."
