2101378,roscoe33,2013-09-13 13:52:00,653,"http://www.casa.com/p/knipex-8-lever...la&cagpspn=pla A true bolt cutter design. Also available with angled head. Only 8"" long Easily cuts 3/16 steel. Cost $45-$70 depending on where you shop."
2101610,v-bay gord,2013-09-13 16:21:00,3168,"The only disadvantage to the bolt cutter design (vs the Felco brand I linked to) is you need two hands to operate. If you have ever been alone and hooked yourself (I have), you suddenly appreciate being able to use a tool that only requires one hand."
2101738,GWC,2013-09-13 17:59:00,1021,"I hate to admit it but it happened on my first trip to Canada in 2008. It was on the first day out, I hooked a small northern & when I went to land it, yep, it did a flip flop & set the hook in my hand. Not knowing this trick, I pushed the hook through, cut the hook & pull it back through my hand. This looks a whole lot less painful. I'm not going to tell you that it happened again on day 2 & day 3. Same lure, just bigger & stronger hooks & walleye instead of northern. Hasn't happened since & I don't need the practice taking hooks out of people, esp. me. I wasn't alone but I had to do the extraction anyway. I wish I had seen this method before that trip."
2116466,roscoe33,2013-09-20 15:28:00,653,"I have average size hands, and can operate it with just one hand."
2175577,roscoe33,2013-10-19 22:48:00,653,"My apologies v-bay cord. I do see your point in using a cable cutter, as the 2 hook like tips of the jaws trap the hook, and do indeed make it easier to use."
2175729,v-bay gord,2013-10-20 07:47:00,3168,No apology needed Roscoe....everyone has their own preferences. Good of you though to test it out and report back. I do like the cable cutters for the reason you mention.
2094818,tv4fish,2013-09-10 12:17:00,2694,"I was thinking the same thing -- Once -- maybe OK, but TWICEGord: We saw a very bad one once at a fly-in camp-- a guy was tossing a huge ""jerk bait"" and his buddy ""got in the way"" --- that was not A PRETTY sight. When we got to the dock, the guy was standing there waiting for the plane to show up to take him to the hospital - they had his entire head wrapped in a gauze bandage."
2095002,HeHooksHimself,2013-09-10 14:42:00,725,"Perhaps you can tell by my handle that I may have a little experience with the subject of this thread. In my 15 years or so of Canadian adventure, we have had three people hooked. I was the first and hence, was given the ""indian"" (no pc responses please) of He Hooks Himself. If you go to Wine Lake Camp, they have a board with lures all over it with little plaques below each one. Mine says, ""In May of 2005 a 23"" pike hooked 250 lb. J______ W______ with this lure."" By the way, I drank the whiskey."
2095074,JAY221,2013-09-10 15:04:00,877,"Vbay Gord, Would you happen to have a model # of the Knipex that you would reccomend? Thanks, Jay"
2095266,115 optimax,2013-09-10 17:23:00,650,"I drive chip trucks up and down the 105 daily,and I wonder how many of you guys I see making your way to and from your lodges in the EarFalls and Redlake area! Feel free to wave at a chip truck."
2095338,rnnonmt,2013-09-10 18:20:00,992,Yikes! Those people were unlucky to have the barb stuck in passed the skin. My Dad took one in the tricep last year from a 1 oz daredevil. Luckily for him it had actually went in and poked through the other side of the skin about a 1/4 inch away. Snip the hook with the side cutters and pulled it through. The hardest part was that it went through his sweatshirt he was wearing so we couldnt see how bad the damage was before surgery. LOL. He was lucky.
2095434,v-bay gord,2013-09-10 19:09:00,3168,"Hi Jay....my mistake...the cutters I use are Felco brand (Swiss made). This looks like the model I use. http://www.felco.com/felco/pages/pro...ame=FELCO%20C7 I like the small head....it's easy to get it into tight spaces. I highly recommend these. I bought them at Bobby's, a number of years ago........I don't see them there anymore."
2095626,keek,2013-09-10 20:16:00,1003,"A trick I use when removing a hook with the string pull method when its in the hand or arm:I get the lure removed from the embedded hook and the power pro wrapped around the hook and just before I press down on the hook eye and jerk the hook out I pause. I then suggest that they put their sun glasses on for safety (I also wear them for safety during the process). As they are putting the glasses on they are momentarily distracted and I quickly pull out the hook. The ordeal of having a hook in you (been there myself) and then the suspense building process of preparing the removal usually has people on edge and they tense up or pull away from you as they anticipate the ""ripping"" out of the hook. With a little distraction it seems to go easier. By the time they have lowered their hand from putting on their sun glasses the hook is already out."
2095698,JayM5209,2013-09-10 20:50:00,1050,"Jay, the 8"" Knipex mini bolt cutter I carry is Model 71 01 200. They're readily available on line and Sears sells them for about $36. You can see them here - http://www.knipex.com/index.php?id=1...7&groupID=1473Jay"
2095826,Jerryv,2013-09-10 21:44:00,1222,"Hawker has it right. It is important to push the hook to open the puncture and give the barb room to back out. Also if it is in a finger, have them hold the finger with the other hand to help immobilize it. This is a better video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSGAso5vpII recently had to take a Rapala hook out of a friends ring finger while in the BWCA. No big deal as long as everyone stays calm.Jerry"
2096161,NathanH,2013-09-11 06:38:00,697,I need to study up on this hook removal process! I cannot recall the last time I saw somone hooked but things happen. Gord you need to keep the lures as the fee for removal and start a collection. A doctor in our area Where a lot of Musky fishing happens includes keeping that bait in his charges. A friend who had to go in said he had an amazing collection hanging round the room.
2094450,v-bay gord,2013-09-10 08:42:00,3168,"Here's a reason to consider going barbless. For those that do fly-ins or are in remote areas I think it is worth considering. Someone in the group should also be familiar with removing hooks. Here's a link to a method that I am often called upon to use (the whiskey is optional). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCA5Q_Lflr4 By the way, this was my first ""cheek removal"".....went well, but the cheek is a very elastic part of the body....it took two attempts."
2094498,Opie,2013-09-10 09:18:00,129,"Gord, you know me, the whiskey would NOT be optional. Saw that on your blog. That one looked more painful than the other one. Dean Thorn"
2094522,grizzley,2013-09-10 09:24:00,2518,"Good post on something that can happen to anyone. I've seen this happen three times, (once was me), and know quite a few others that have had hooks in them.Yrs. ago a guy I was fishing with buried the hooks from a flatfish in both hands. The Doc. at the hospital made a remark that it was the most effective pair of handcuffs he had ever seen!"
2094530,NathanH,2013-09-10 09:25:00,697,The joys of running a fishing camp. I bet you have seen some wild things! This is pretty crazy to the face! Did a buddy get him or did he do it himself.
2094546,v-bay gord,2013-09-10 09:39:00,3168,"His son hooked him. Interestingly, an hour before the son hooked himself in the hand with a similar lure. Here's his photo.... Maybe I should hang out a shingle ""Hooks Removed Painlessly Here!"" But seriously, it is a bad position to be in especially if you have no options to get it out. ...by the way, contrary to the method shown in the U-tube video, I always cut the hook off of the lure with a very nice pair of hook cutters (Knipex). Usually something musky anglers would carry, but I would suggest asking Santa Claus for a pair this winter."
2094698,bigwalleye1,2013-09-10 10:49:00,2632,Perhaps this is one kid that SHOULD take up video gaming.... or at the very least get a bright orange shirt that says something about not approaching within 20 feet due to flying objects. Just sayin'.
2094706,Larry Mac,2013-09-10 10:52:00,530,"Hi V-Bay gord, coincidentally our group ran into him and his son at Bobby's Corner on our way up to Red lake. They showed us the pics and video on his sons phone. They said they were having a great time at your camp. It is a small world. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
2094754,Hawker,2013-09-10 11:11:00,3967,"An excellent method for removing hooks Gord!! Have been called upon myself numerous times for hook removal with this method, three in the cheek as was shown in your pic. I too cut the two remaining hooks off the treble hook as well as the split ring so that I'm only working with the imbedded hook and the hook shank. I've seen numerous videos of the same procedure where the hook is ""pulled"" out, but in practice have found that a good quick yank (like your trying to start a chainsaw or ice auger) works the best. I always tell'em, gonna go at the count of three, then pull it on two or before I get to two, that way they don't tense up as bad. The key factor in utilizing this method is to push down as far and hard on the eye of the hook as possible, forcing the hook to back itself out of the opening with the barb away from the skin/meat/muscle!"
2094762,JayM5209,2013-09-10 11:13:00,1050,"x 2 on the Knipex. I won't push away from the dock unless a pair is in the boat. Well worth the cost. Cutting the embedded hook from the lure prior to hook removal, as Gord does, is especially important if the lure has an additional treble hook or two. Without cutting off the lure you're at risk of removing one hook and embedding a different one."
2094770,v-bay gord,2013-09-10 11:15:00,3168,Exactly! It's best to surprise them when you finally pull it out. It's amazing how pasty and wobbly people get with a hook embedded in them. The relief on their faces afterwards is pretty funny..... .....and Larry Mac...that is a coincidence. Funny how many people on here actually pass through Vermilion Bay.
