2170642,Guest,2013-10-17 07:24:00,0,There is a gravel/large rock/massive pothole/boulder/bedrock road off of 71 to the west side of Dryberry.

1387205,Guest,2012-01-28 19:12:00,0,Looking for any info about Dryberry lake near Kenora.
1387256,Skywagon,2012-01-29 05:12:00,1106,"I took a boat in there 7 years ago to look at a guys float plane hanger (for ideas). It is a 53000 acre lake, very deep, with lake trout but no walleye. The road we took in was 4wd access only at that time and as I recall was located near the north-west side of the lake. There may be better access somewhere on the south end of the lake, but as that is out of my usual range of travel, I do not know. The place I visited was for sale a couple of years ago (may have sold by now), google Eagle Island cabin on Dryberry and watch the video, tells some about the lake and about the fabulous place thses people have. Want to own a piece of Canada, this would be it."

Then, portage to Dryberry......water so pure that you could drink from the lake - which we did. Brute smallies...............monster Muskies......awesome Lakers........if a person could buy some land..............."
1387588,Guest,2012-01-30 06:49:00,0,Is it a numbers lake for lake trout or do you have a chance for some big trout?
1388128,troutaholic,2012-01-31 13:01:00,827,I would not be surprised if the next world record comes from this lake.
1388283,Guest,2012-01-31 18:59:00,0,"Man that means I definitly will have to go there. There are so many lakes, so little time."
1388352,stillangling,2012-02-01 06:43:00,149,"Gents,I try to fish Dryberry at least twice per year. I would describe the fishing for lake trout as good but I highly doubt that the next record will come from Dryberry. Most of the fish range between 4-8lbs. My biggest so far is around 11 pounds and that is after more than 20 trips to the lake. Biggest I have seen a picture of is 18 lbs. Are there big fish there? Probably but it is not what I would describe as a trophy lake trout destination. If you are truly interested in trophy trout in the Kenora area I would suggest Clearwater Bay (open water only, catch and release) or Whitefish Bay. Both are on LOW and either one will give you a realistic chance at a 20 lb fish. If you want to travel a little farther, Lake Nipigon is hands down your best chance in NW Ontario at a real trophy. Another option would be Minitaki in Sioux Lookout."
1389142,troutaholic,2012-02-03 04:51:00,827,We just have to agree to disagree......largest our group had was 24 pounds.......I had one on that was much bigger than that......before braided line.........
2170281,Guest,2013-10-16 21:05:00,0,"Made the trip to Dryberry and had the time of my life catching lakers. Biggest was about 12 pounds. Only saw two other boats in 4 days. What a great lake and great fishing. The road to the lake is 3.8 miles and I think they test drive tanks on it. The ugliest road I have ever seen, made it ok but had to drive very slow, took an hour to drive the 3.8 miles. Once you get to the landing you will find the best boat ramp I have seen in Ontario. Hopwever to get there you must use the worst road I have seen. That being said I will be going back."
2170602,wiggle,2013-10-17 07:05:00,400,"redcedarguy.....how do you get to Dryberry lake? I checked out google earth and could not see any ""road"" that goes to the lake! You can reply by private, if you wish! Thanks, Brad"
