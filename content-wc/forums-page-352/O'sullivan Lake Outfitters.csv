2148785,tooski,2013-10-05 07:40:00,393,OK- guess I should start looking at my gas. We just pour it from the red 5 gallon cans direct to the tanks. If there is a gen on site they always have the cans identified. Thanks.
2152066,Mohleye,2013-10-07 08:08:00,368,"I hate to jump to conclusions, but if an outfitter isn't paying attention to something as critical as mixing gas, it's no surprise they don't take care of anything else either. They were lucky you caught it. And so were you, because it probably would have turned into a hassle."
2161978,corvette1,2013-10-12 09:30:00,243,i booked with howard and elsie again going abamasagi lake last year we were going to go in by boat . water was low so we flew in same price midweek check up on us and to bring in more gas cabin was clean no leaks boats ran awesome fishing was great what more do you want.
2170802,chris.brock,2013-10-17 09:07:00,112,"we went with Big Howard to Abamasagi this June, a couple things, if anyone is interested- we went in by boat, we thought for the extra cost the plane might be a better option because it's easier to get to Nakina to catch the plane instead of Howard's camp and then the river, load the boats, dicey rapids etc.-we didn't get picked up to come out until 2pm, this put us behind schedule and had to sleep over in Cochrane (extra time and cost there), planes usually get you out (and to Nakina) early in the morningwe did get some attitude from Howard for a mix up, long story though"
2170810,chris.brock,2013-10-17 09:10:00,112,"Hi Curryale, I would be interested in knowing what outpost you were atyou could PM me if you feel more comfortable with that, thanks"
2120602,iltgh,2013-09-22 20:35:00,2,"before you book with O'sullivan Lake Outfitters you better look into it. We stayed for a week, the fishing was good the lake was good the place is a dump. We had no running water for the 1st 3 days, (all the water is pumped from the river) Nothing in the cabin worked. The people are very rude. There is no one there to help you. They will not tell you where to find fish even though they promise you the world they absolutely do NOTHING! Then to top it off they told us one price then when we got there we paid almost double! Just be cautious We definetely will NEVER stay there again and if you dont want to get ripped off there are plenty of other places. Just an FYI"
2123417,oleJoe,2013-09-23 20:32:00,114,"Thank you, I have never stayed there but finally nice to read a negative report. I knew that all these places were not a fisher mans dream. Take care"
2125490,hawks_rule,2013-09-24 15:26:00,115,If you like the lake but not the outfitter check out O'Sullivan Rainbow lodge. Great place and really awesome owners.http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/
2128418,fishinnut 3446,2013-09-25 19:11:00,638,"Those Moose and Bear prices don't look bad at all, Anyone hunted with them?And to the OP was the guy's name Howard that owned the lodge ?I Moose hunted with this guy in 07 but belive we stayed on a river off Ogokie(sp) lake."
2131665,hawks_rule,2013-09-27 08:29:00,115,I have not personally hunted O'Sullivans but know a pair of guys that have and they were happy with the results. I think one has done multiple hunts. Give them a call and they will provide references if that's what you are looking for.
2138785,chris.brock,2013-09-30 19:21:00,112,"interesting,were you at their main camp on O'Sull. Lake or an outpost? When did you go?thanks"
2141105,trapperbob,2013-10-01 21:49:00,45,There are two O'sullivan lakes. One is in Quebec the other is in Ontario. The camp in Quebec is the one I assume you are talking about since I had an unpleasant trip there 2 years ago. Look up an older thread there and you can read see other comments. Don't confuse with the Ontario outfitter.
2142169,unclepaully,2013-10-02 13:46:00,112,I'm quite sure he was posting about O'sullivan Lake Outfitter in Ontario. There is another thread where guys were talking about that lake and he chimed in with the same comments.
2147641,Curryale,2013-10-04 14:39:00,50,I have been to O'Sullivans Raonbow on 3 occasions and had excellent accomodations and service.I have also been to an outpost camp with the other outfitter on the lake. I though long and hard about posting something after the trip three years ago and decided not to. But now someone has brought it up I might as well share our experience. Although we had a great time fishing and the price was very reasonable the accomodations and service were very poor. A few examples: 1. They were to take us into the lake on an ATV and Trailer. The Trail to the lake was far too small for the Trailer. They had clearly never taken the trailer down there before. We carried in all of our gear into the lake about a km or so. No big deal for me but not as enjoyable for people in their late 60s who had trouble walking back and forth over the distance. 2. We fished our first night there and in the morning went to fill the motor up with gas. They had forgotten to mix oil into the fuel so we spent over half the second day travelling back to base camp to get oil to mix with the fuel.3. There was no generator at camp as advertised and promised.4. At the mid-week check they again promised a generator and more ice but forgot again to bring any.5. There were about 3 forks in the outpost cabin. 6. The cabin did not leak but had not been cleaned that year. I personally would never go back again nor would the people in my group. Which is a shame because the lake we fished was excellent. To me there are many outfitters in the area that one wouldnt run into the same problems with so why would you ever go back.
2147881,tooski,2013-10-04 16:22:00,393,How did you know there was no oil in the fuel?
