2161386,LeeMB,2013-10-11 19:56:00,83,"fishing is starting to heat up here. Quite a lot of bait in the system and good numbers of nice fish. A few over 30"" showing up."
2161538,Guest,2013-10-11 21:24:00,0,Ive been hearing from groups up there that the mile was pretty hot today. The guy I talked to caught a lot of nice fish in the 20s and had 2 over 10lbs also. they said they saw a number of pigs landed too up there. jigging for the most part
2161826,black white face,2013-10-12 07:38:00,1072,I am hoping for a great week up there !Thanks for the updates as well. Always exciting reading reports like this before a trip
2161874,LeeMB,2013-10-12 08:14:00,83,"Cranks are working well along with jigging. Both up and down stream. Cranks will work well with the warmer water temps we have now. Water should cool off with the current weather though. Water temp on the 11th was 51* in most areas.Lots of good fish being caught both on the Red and at Pine Falls. If your coming up for a few days I would be prepared to fish both, depending on the bite and the weather."
2161882,black white face,2013-10-12 08:16:00,1072,Thanks Lee. We will be well prepared 51 deg is perfect and hope it sustains
2180338,black white face,2013-10-22 18:52:00,1072,"Water temps were 47 ish Muddy water. Clarity was 4"" The bite was really slow. Really slow. Many locals said they have only caught 3 green backs in 3 weeks of fishing Tried plugs and jigging (anchored up) Largest was 27. Very few fish caught allot of saugers Temps were in the upper twenties to mid thirties , Sunday was nasty at 28 and 30 mph winds Fished the cut to the dam , best luck at miracle mile"
2181906,mallard_24,2013-10-23 16:14:00,11,"Well first trip to the Red is in the books. Fished Friday - Sunday. Put in at Selkirk on Friday and worked south of the ramp. Caught several small fish jigging, got frustrated and started cranking. Ended up with a 29.5"" that went 10 lbs 12 oz. about an hour before dark. Good way to start off the weekend! Saturday went up to the cut and caught again several smaller walleyes, biggest 22"". Struggled jigging and pulling. Kept a few for the dinner plate.Sunday went back to the same area, didn't have a fish at noon. Put on some reef runners and ended up with another 29.5"" that went 9 lbs 7 oz, a 28"" that we did not weigh, and several more in the 24-26"" class. Our best fishing came off of plugs, which is the opposite of what everyone suggested. Guess a guy has to go with what works for him and what he's confident with. Overall a great trip and one that I will do again in the future. Water temp was 47-49 degrees and yes very dirty. I'm sure the fishing will be good for a few weeks yet. Thank you to those of you who offered advice."
2181938,jhoeke,2013-10-23 16:20:00,23,"I was up there from the 9th through the 15th and had moderate success, fishing improved everyday we were there. This was the earliest I have ever been up there. I prefer to drop a jig and a saltie. Sometimes you just have to grind it out and be patient, let the saltie do the work. The water is dirty so the smell of the saltie draws them in. The fish come through in schools so it will be slow and then turn on for a bit and then go slow again until the next school comes through. Run and gun is not a good tactic up there, unless it is between just 2 or 3 spots. Early is better for trolling the later you get the better the jig bite is. I am headed up again on Halloween which is my normal time and have never had a bad trip this late. My only advice this late is dress warm and make sure you take a boat with a windshield so you can get out of the wind for a bit."

2157498,mallard_24,2013-10-09 13:46:00,11,"Headed to Selkirk and fishing the Red next week. First timer here and I have to say I'm pumped. Sounds like a variety of techniques work this time of year. Sounds like some do well with jigs, spoons, and others prefer pulling plugs. Just looking for a little advice from those of you that have been there done that. What kind of plugs work well, reef runners, shad raps, etc? Speeds? Preferred live bait techniques? Just looking for a little advice before I make the 8 hour drive. Thanks, eh."
2157818,freespoolin,2013-10-09 16:24:00,472,"Either dead still, anchored with a jig and minnow-frozen salted shiner with a bulked up jig(water is dirty) or trolling shad raps. And good luck, it's been slow so far this year."
2157882,Burr,2013-10-09 16:53:00,8612,"Keep in mind they typically open the gates on October 15 each year, and that flushes the fish out of the Red for a week or two.If you're there when that happens, the trip is not lost, just head for the Winnipeg river in Papertown and fish the where the winnipeg river dumps into Lake Winnipeg.Actually, imo I'd head to Papertown and just run over to the Red if it gets too windy to fish the bay. It's only 30-40 miles.But yes, bring a big chene type anchor, bigger jigs than you would anticipate, get some frozen and live minnows, fish what works. Don't worry about using half ounce jigs, the big fish your after will inhale a big jig just fine to set the hook. If the fish can't inhale a half ounce jig, it's not the fish you were looking to catch in the first place.MNR is notorious for setting up at the Red park entrance/exit, cuz they can be there and not be seen until you are on top of them. Just be sure to not get lazy when pulling out of the park at the end of the day and be ready. Sometimes people think they will finish getting ready back at the motel - that's too late.All kinds of cranks work, shad raps, flicker shads, RR, Hornets, Fat Free, just change it up and zero in on them. Don't waste time on small fish, there are big ones to be caught.Lot's of shore fisherman on the Red during the weekend. Try not to have flash backs from Viet Nam."
2158538,zeebee,2013-10-09 22:34:00,1144,"......""Lot's of shore fisherman on the Red during the weekend. Try not to have flash backs from Viet Nam.""Better yet why don't you, your boat and your racist comments stay on your side of the border. Those shore fisherman are largely Canadian citizens now and you are taking a pretty cheap shot."
2158578,Burr,2013-10-10 00:35:00,8612,"I never said anything derogatory toward any race. I only said what I said. Has no bearing on who is shore fishing, only that there is an incredible number of shore fisherman on the red. Chill."
2158730,black white face,2013-10-10 06:27:00,1072,I will be there as well- Thurs through Mon-
2158986,mallard_24,2013-10-10 08:41:00,11,Thanks for the replies fellas. Hopefully our timing is OK. Do they always open the gates on Oct 15 or does it depend on temperatures/water levels? Does fishing slow down during this time or does it shut completely off?
2159282,skeeter60,2013-10-10 11:30:00,23,"I am going to disagree with the information that Burr is giving you in this string of messages. The tall tail has always been ""when the drawdown happens on the Red River the fish shut off or get flushed out of the system"". We used to plan our trip up North around this every year until we were forced one year to fish during the drawdown. For the last 5-7 years we have fished every year during the drawdown and have had fantastic luck, catching both numbers and big fish. Dont be afraid to fish the Red during this time, just use your head on where you want to fish the river based on the increased flow rate(find a crease or slack water). We are headed up on Sunday and I anticipate our timing is going to be right on with the run. Good luck to everyone headed North!"
2159578,sept61,2013-10-10 14:51:00,91,exactly
2159626,mallard_24,2013-10-10 15:17:00,11,"Makes more sense. Looks like the weather is going to cool down pretty good next week, which I would think is a good thing. Good luck to you guys as well!"
