2081969,troutwater,2013-09-04 10:45:00,299,Thanks Matt. I looked on the website a few days ago and didn't see it on there yet. When will the new outpost cabin be going up?
2158346,Guest,2013-10-09 20:06:00,0,"Good Luck Steve We attended the All Canada Shows as exhibitors for close to 20 years, it was from the sport shows most of our guests started from. Then they brought their friends. We enjoyed meeting both new & old guests at the shows & it was great to talk with other resort owners & pick up on new ideas. Sorry to hear Jennifer ran into problems, I have worked with you in the past & know you'll put on a great show, will be watching for your the show reviews. We are enjoying being retired & are spending more time fishing. Again Good Luck with the new business. Ex Resort Owner, Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake."

2162802,Sportdog,2013-10-12 22:05:00,6735,Do you know the dates of this event? Thanks.
2163034,Glenman12,2013-10-13 06:58:00,762,looks like its Jan 9-12 according to the website..
2164170,Sportdog,2013-10-13 21:31:00,6735,Thank you. That's right outside Chicago isn't it? What is the web site?

2175585,roscoe33,2013-10-19 23:08:00,653,"The fact of the matter is that a single purpose Canada show/event is getting harder to run successfully.This is due to many factors, including the poor economy of the past 7 years, huge TV advertising costs, the loss of newspaper circulation, multi-purpose sporting event competition, loss of venues, customers not willing to travel long distances, and a general drop in the number of people interested in going to Canada.Multi sport multi interest shows have the ability to draw visitor with many outdoor interests, and can be run regionally at smaller venues.West Bend, Madison, La Crosse, Eau Claire, Green Bay, Minneapolis, and Duluth all put on nice shows, and there are often less than a dozen Canadian resorts being represented, so there is less competition per resort."
2064034,riverrat47,2013-08-27 22:26:00,3,"I'm with pikeman, nothing like face to face contact. However, I've been hoodwinked by face to face contact, too."
2065762,phishfearme,2013-08-28 15:15:00,1242,"I think this is right on the money - every outfitter I've used who participated in the all canadas said it's way too time consuming and way too expensive when you consider what they achieved at the shows. when I first started going to them, the internet was no where near what it is now. outfitter web sites contain all you need to know - although there are a few excellent outfitter that operate outside of the internet ""under the radar"" and work solely on word of mouth. even keeping the web site up to date is time consuming and costly. phish"
2065810,lcwhit,2013-08-28 15:39:00,104,"phish, I built my web site for less that $1000. when I update it, it costs about $50/ hour. I have a small section for announcements, specials, etc. even I can do this without any help. its not that expensive, if you shop around. helluva lot cheaper than going to one show, I would guess."
2067226,Obabikon,2013-08-29 08:06:00,2370,"Everyone's different, but I find that shows are still great tools to grow your business. I'm a good face to face salesman, and always seem to get new guests (and book old ones) at the shows. I don't get 100 new bookings at a show, there's no doubt that those days are gone. However, if you provide a good service, and keep the guests you have, all you need to do is land a few NEW guests at each show. I'm not going to criticize All-Canada, because I don't know the books. But, there should be enough booths at $1000 per booth to make it profitable. Anyhow, I hope the new company does well with the Chicago show and adds a few more."
2068162,phishfearme,2013-08-29 12:56:00,1242,"from the perspective of some outfitters who do not use the internet frequently (if at all), they feel they're looking at a mountain of front end learning and training that I don't think they want to do - it is lots of hours and lets face it, casual users can get so frustrated that they just give up. they also see their friends getting new computers all too frequently due to things like obsolescence or infections. and once you get a web site (i think you got a deal for what you describe) how do you advertise it? don't depend on search engines unless you want to pay them to list you first when someone does a search on ""Canada fishing"" or something like that. and monthly ISP fees, slow connections in the bush as well as unwelcome connection down times ..... I could go on but I fully understand why some outfitters use the phone and a pencil and paper calendar - they're cheap and they work - and word of mouth works for many of them. i live on my computer but i really understand where they're coming from. phish"
2068330,new hips,2013-08-29 13:39:00,498,"Walleye Central is the best place to go for information, I've never been steered wrong with any Lake or lodge. A great group of well informed fisherman & women. Invaluable information given on this website. ""Ask & You Shall Receive"" People looking for new paces will search the internet. Thanks to all that make this site what it is."
2071898,pikeman14,2013-08-31 07:52:00,144,Well said
2080266,troutwater,2013-09-03 16:53:00,299,Are the dates known yet for the all Canada show at Pheasant Run next year?
2081329,Glenman12,2013-09-04 06:33:00,762,As of right now their website doesn't show any dates for 2014..
2081769,Outfitter17,2013-09-04 09:57:00,127,"All-Canada Show Exhibitor:Thank you for all the great feedback and strong support that we have received, we encourage this in our future relationship.

2058634,Glenman12,2013-08-26 10:27:00,762,Got an email from our lodge owner and he says the All Canada Show has declared bankruptcy and the only show they are doing this year is the Chicago one...anybody else hear about this?..I went on their website and they don't have any dates listed at all for 2014..
2058794,v-bay gord,2013-08-26 11:03:00,3168,That information is true.
2059234,Jig Man,2013-08-26 12:26:00,95,2nd that confirmation- Bankrupt and out of business unless someone comes along and buys the rights.
2059314,v-bay gord,2013-08-26 12:41:00,3168,I believe they already have ...with one show (Pheasant Run) planned for 2014....and expansion in following years.
2059370,SinOrSwim,2013-08-26 12:52:00,1528,"Always enjoyed those shows but haven't been to one in several years. That was how we booked our very first trip almost 20 years ago. However, I imagine doing that show was/is a grind for the lodge owners that utilized it. A lot of travel and expense. With the internet, that money can be used for a very good website and it probably drives more customers. Sites like this etc are much better sources of information than what I remember getting at the All Canada Show."
2059754,lassh,2013-08-26 14:52:00,553,I still go to the All Canada shows even though I'm usually booked for trips that year. I do go to the Pheasant Run show. I enjoy seeing and BSing with old friends and meeting new ones. I have in the past wanted to see quality tackle for sale at the show. Perhaps this could boost the interest and income from the show.
2060690,Glenman12,2013-08-26 19:35:00,762,yeah...he said the guy that sets up and owns the booths was trying to buy the name..
2061737,pikeman14,2013-08-27 08:15:00,144,That's a shame. It has been our tradition for years to visit the show. There is nothing like talking face to face with the lodges.
2062673,teddi,2013-08-27 13:49:00,349,I guess Jennifer just could not be like her dad dave. Every thing was out dated and not much new from year to year. I guess all the outfitters have to find some place new for next year.
2063201,lcwhit,2013-08-27 16:25:00,104,technology and the internet strikes again. not a bad thing I guess. web sites probably drive much more traffic at a much lower price than shows. they can get really expensive.
