560654,Guest,2006-08-26 06:47:00,0,"I spoke with someone who claims to be ""in the know"" who told me that the resorts on that system have created such a stink regarding the slot limit and catch limits that the MNR is considering dropping the restrictions for 07. For the sake of everyone who fishes that system I hope this isn't true. Do these dopes (resort owners complaining) honestly believe that people have stopped going up there because they can only keep two fish a day instead of four? Talk about cutting your nose off to spite your face. If these numbskulls (resort owners )had any sense at all they would be promoting catch and release (like the Rough Rock lodge is doing). People stopped going up there because the walleye fishing sucked not because they could only keep two fish a day. These resort owners should have been the ones fighting for tighter restrictions in order to protect the fishery and bring it back to what it once was. I'll get off my soapbox now but would appreciate any comments from others who might know something."
560659,woods,2006-08-26 09:34:00,646,"I would certainly agree that it isn't the two fish limit that would keep me from going back there, but the lack of fish! Our group is still going back next year though. There's more to Minaki than just catching fish!"
560664,Danny61,2006-08-26 12:54:00,42,"Its just more than the resort owners fault its everybody's fault that overfished that resourse. There was a day when you would need over 20lbs of fish per day just to be in the running at the tourney's and it wasn't uncommon to see guys with stringers of fish that included two 10pounders. The tourney's killed fish back in the day the fisherman from both Canada and U.S. were relentless in there harvest of larger(21-30inch) reproducing female and male fish. Look, the MNR will never move backward when it comes to restrictions, those are there to stay.In 5 years the fishery will be very strong again not that its not now I have yet to have a poor day of fishing at Minaki or for that matter there's no such thing as a bad day of fishing."
560676,Guest,2006-08-27 09:52:00,0,"Danny, I hope your right. And just for the record, I never said it was the resort owners fault for the poor fishing up there. I just fault them for putting pressure on the MNR to take the restrictions off premature for what would clearly only be a short term gain for them and a longer term problem for that fishery."
560712,lazyk,2006-08-28 23:33:00,26,"I fished the Winnepeg over the past few years and noticed a decline in the walleye fishery as well. I also noted that the 2 fish limit is for non canadians as they say most of the fish caught on the system and kept were by American fishermen. I wouldn`t mind it so much if the rules were uniform and covered Canadians as well. After talking to a Canadian friend(who has nine children), he mentioned that he could take a limit of 4 fish for himself and 4 fish for each of his children(40 fish if you`re counting). He also said he was stopped and checked by the warden and he checked out OK. I checked the regs and it doesn`t matter if you are from Ontario or Manitoba, the bag limit rules are the same. As for the kids, I know they count are part of the adults limit in Wisconsin. I didn`t find anything specific on this in the Ontario rules. Does anyone know for sure? Fortunately this friend is not that good of a fisherman. But if people can do this legally, that is alot of fish. I`m all for the slot limit, reduced bag limit where appropriate, and practicing catch and release. But make the rules uniform. Lazyk"
560713,Danny61,2006-08-29 00:41:00,42,"Manitoba residents purchase a Ontario permit to fish in Ontario.Two different liscence one conservation(2walleye), one regular liscence (4walleye)so me being a winnipeger I have a manitoba permit and a Ontario permit and yes if my seven year old daughter(we only ever keep 3 fish per outing) wants to keep four fish she's allowed.I'm actully heading up for the Sept long weekend. hopefully fishingwill be good."
560720,Guest,2006-08-29 10:37:00,0,I spent a few hours yesterday and this morning trying to find out through Ontario natural resources on 2007 proposed fishing limits on the winnipeg river. Needless to say when dealing with any gov't you get the run around and transfers. Plus I wasn't able to obtain any info. I personally cannot see any changes for 2007. As far as natural spawning fish go I cannot remember any cases where they have lowered the limit . and then raise the limit. One would logically think that fishing quality would be more important then limit of fish ??? As far as the slot size goes all you have to do is see what's happened in manitoba on the winnipeg river. In many cases the walleye fishing nearly collapsed. But with strick slot sizes once again it's becoming a excellent fishing location.
560725,lazyk,2006-08-29 13:01:00,26,"Danny, I don`t mind as much when the kids actually fish and catch something to take home. My friend had some 1,2 and 3 year olds so there wasn`t much fishing going on there. I agree that the fishery would be very strong if the limits stayed in place for the next five years but if they are applied equally(canadian and american). I`m sure there would be an uproar around here if the Illinois crowd could keep one fish to two for wisconsin residents. Lazyk"
