560486,walleyeduran,2006-08-20 09:28:00,286,"Good luck scar, I have tried calling them a half dozen times and the only person I am able to talk to is one of their wives. I have left messages to contact me about location, prices, boat in or not, accomadations, etc... I hope you have better luck than I have had. Pat at evergreen, you are correct, they have been a little pushy with that telephone number."
560488,Guest,2006-08-20 10:31:00,0,"Lac Seul adventures is apparently run by two members of the Ojibway Tribe, and is located on the reservation. It seems that if you belong to the tribe, you can build cabins where ever you choose. This is a boat in cabin, located by the small Indian village between the entrance to Vaughn Lake and the rags before Mahkwa Lodge. Mahkwa Lodge is located just around the point from there. It is a new four man cabin, with it's own dock and A/C and costs $300.00/night, which is more expensive than Mahkwa housekeeping or other comparable privately owned cabins in the area. If you want isolation or some privacy, this is probably not the place for you. In fact, that whole area is becoming overun with fishermen, so don't expect a ""wilderness"" experience. Lac Seul Adventures say that more cabins are on there way for next year, but that remains to be seen. This information on their pricing and facilities was obtained from Lac Seul Adventures themselves, and observation on the way to Mahkwa. Take it for what it's worth."
560495,Guest,2006-08-20 12:57:00,0,"That is exactly right!! I have been trying to get them to state that on here themselves, but they are always reluctant to give details. As I eluded to in another post, ONLY on the reserve could a new resort open in the central part of Lac Seul. Anywhere else, and the MNR would tell you not a chance, but because reserves (politically) are under federal jurisdiction, they can almost create a resort overnight. It is basically around the corner from Mahkwa, and more or less in the central part of the western section of the reserve. Now, as we live in a capitalist society, and there is obviously some demand for fishing Seul, so be it. But how many people would like to come in with hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars and build a premier 4 or 5 star resort on Seul, and can't. (And don't get me wrong, I certainly don't want such a thing) But in this instance, they can erect a cabin, give it a name, and apparently they're in business. I've heard from Brian and/or Jack on here several times for several months now . . . has anybody come across a website yet. If you have, it's been put up recently. Believe me, this venture certainly has received periodic attention in the local LS fishing circles. I think most people are waiting to get some first-hand reports from visitors before passing money over to Lac Seul Adventures. Hopefully they run it right, as there has been a long-running history (almost tradition) of business ventures associated with reserves going bust, often due to mismanagement and/or simple lack of effort. That is unfortunate, but true. NWO Fishing Bum p.s., Brian and Jack, if you are going to promote on here, may I suggest proof-reading your posts. Image is important! As I've said for years . . . when your fishing NWO with American guests, you are selling PERCEPTION, not REALITY."

560507,Jimmy Jig,2006-08-20 20:02:00,1905,Most camps require some amount for a down-payment. I don't think I'd be real quick to send this outfit any money for 2007. If they have one cabin and its available for last week in June business isn't too good!!
