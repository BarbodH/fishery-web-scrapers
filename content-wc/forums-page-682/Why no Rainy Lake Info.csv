I think people make judgements on lakes that they might fish on for a few days and do that good or have a inexperienced guide. I believe everyone has bad days on the water. Rainy Lake has really come back in my eyes, just as good here in June as any other places. Summer time they come more easier to find and more concentrated, actually summer and early fall best time to fish for big fish if you know what to look for. This year so far I have fished Rainy Lake probably 30 days and most days we caught lots of fish and big ones over 28 inches, biggest one I seen this year is a 32inch walleye."
560595,Guest,2006-08-23 18:59:00,0,"You probably do not here much on the lake because it is mostly known for its smallmouth bass fishing. It has been rated in the top 5 in north america for smallies in many magazines. The walleye fishing has come back like crazy. Most of the fisherman I see on the lake are still smallie fishing. There is lots of info on Rainy. Most do not realize that 75% or so of Rainy is in Ontario waters. Just do a search about rainy along with ontario. The walleye limit for non-residents on Rainy is 1 fish/day on the canadian side. This along with the slot size, smelt introduction and sancturaries have turned Rainy into one of the best walleye lakes for large fish in NW ontario. The thickness of the fish, walleye, pike or smallmouth has changed since the smelts arrived. But like the rest said, just keep on driving by."
560597,Guest,2006-08-23 19:31:00,0,"I think one of the reasons Rainy isn't brought up much is the 1 fish per day limit which causes people to think the fishery is in trouble or that they can't even have a shorelunch because of the 1 per day limit. I know when I fished Rainy this past June the resort guests were certainly wondering why such strict rules?(By that time I've had a few crappie/bluegill fish dinners so the limit didn't bother me) I agree that the lake is a tremendous smallmouth lake and the walleye fishing, especially for average size, is very good. Lots of people are driving right past a ""gem"" of a lake."
560598,Guest,2006-08-23 20:26:00,0,"The one limit was put in, to curb the amount of fisherman on the US side of Rainy Lake, fishing in Ontario waters. The Ontario gov't passed legislation halting the huge number of fisherman staying on the US side, but wanting to fish in Canada. Theygave the US side 2 yrs to slow down on development, drop limits etc. They did not. They actually increased the # of fisherman crossing the border. The ONtario gov't then acted by passing legislation stating that if you are staying on the MN side, you can still fish in Ontario, but you cannot take resources. The us based operators challenged the Ontario gov't with Nafta. Having fears that Washington could be telling the Ontario biologist what will happen in Ontario waters of Rainy Lake, the original legislation was dropped. With that, resort owners, the biologists, cabin owners, etc, had meetings and dropped the limit to One. Hoping this would keep the US daytripping down to a minimum. So If you think 1 fish is to little, thank our friends south of the border. The lake pressure on the Ontario side has been cut by 75%. We fisherman will not change the limit. We do not want to go back to those days of exploitation. The lake has come back, and we are happy. If Ontario was Texas it would not have happened."
560599,voyaguer,2006-08-23 22:01:00,54,"I was ready to buy in to all of your rehtoric until the end. Then I realize your agenda is purely political. I realize that part of what you write is political in nature having to do with resources, limits etc. and most of what you start with is logically based, in my opinion. You conclude with what I have found from several north of the border, that the issue may be more that of a capitalistic society vs that of a socialistic society. Perhaps fishing in Iran may be more satisfying. I don't recall 3000 + civilians being killed north of the border. Last time I looked, the border ran thru the lake. Its ok, none of us in the so-called civilized nations (including both sides) will survive in the long run - so fish when and where you can. If you profit from it, you will be despised by many. But of course, those with your money in their pockets or have been protected by your might, will not be there to support you when it counts."
560613,Bill Krejca,2006-08-24 09:21:00,6107,"Ever since I can remember, (1940's) the lake was heavily exploited by commercial fishing, and it seemed that the tourist industry really never took off to the extent that it did in LOW. I remember going into the Sportsmans shop in the Falls in the 40's and 50's, and 60's, and there would always be several folks cleaning fish for the commercial market. After the fishing finally reached about as low as it could go, the commercial fishing eased off, and now apparently the walleyes are again starting to make their presence know, which is great. As it continues to return, I expect more folks will be referring to it as the place to go. A lake can stand a lot of pressure, with reasonable limits, but it doesn't take long to do harm which takes years to correct when the fishery is abused. I wish it the best."
560614,Guest,2006-08-24 10:16:00,0,"MY intentions were not really to get it political. Some one talked about the one limit. I just wanted to state the reason why it is one walleye/day. Sorry about the texas remark. IF you lived on the south arm of the lake all your life and saw what I have seen, you would feel the same. Anyways the problems are pretty well over. Rainy is a beautiful lake and really not that developed. There are huge areas that have very little development. Things have ""changed"" in the last 15 years. The US side have dropped limits and the regs are getting closer together. It is a nice thing to see, the US side finally coming on board. The biologists and locals on both sides are working closer together to turn Rainy into one of the best fisheries in N America. Speaking about the commercial fisherman. Most were bought out way before the recovery of the walleye population started. It certainly wasn't a bad thing, but, the major kick start for the recovery of walleye on Rainy, was the cut in pressure by 75% of it's recreational fishery on 75% of the lake. A few good year classes in the 90's. Protected by a 13 3/4"" - 17 3/4"" keep slot. And one fish a day for the major users, introduction of smelt, how can it not become one of the better walleye lakes. It is not a lake to fill coolers. It is a lake to fill camera film, althought you can still have a walleye fillet here and there."
560662,Guest,2006-08-26 12:12:00,0,"Thanks for all your info. My family has been fishing Rainy for the past seven years (mostly in the Red Gut area). We fish for Northern, smallies and eyes, and it has always been great. What are the predictions for the September? We'll be at the Fisheries September 9 thru the 16. Thanks"
560324,Guest,2006-08-15 10:02:00,0,"It's hard to believe no one posts info on Rainy Lake. Why? It's a great fishery for walleye, pike and smallmouth."
560338,Mohleye,2006-08-15 14:07:00,368,I'd love to hear more about Rainy.
560339,Guest,2006-08-15 14:52:00,0,Maybe most of the fisherman drive right by Rainy on their way to the lakes they fish. I know I have for 35 years.
560340,Blackmacs,2006-08-15 14:54:00,2121,"Info on Rainy is few and far between on this site. The regulars here and guests don't seem to fish the lake. At least there aren't many talking about it. It isn't that it's not a good walleye lake, because it is but you didn't hear that from me. ;-) Check Fishing Minnesota, one word, it has a good Rainy thread."
560342,Guest,2006-08-15 15:04:00,0,I fished Rainy years back and did OK for Walleye. Now I fish Lac Seul and in my opinion it is a much better Walleye Lake than Rainy. I also believe that most of us out of the USA that go to Canada would rather drive another 200 miles into waters that are more productive on a consistant basis.
560346,Lund 2025,2006-08-15 15:57:00,130,"We just got back from Rainy. You guys just keep driving by and going farther north. That's ok with me. Seriously, though, the fishing was very good. We caught alot of walleyes with many over 20"" and our biggest being a fat 26"" girl. Also, although we didn't fish them per se, the smallmouth were a nice bonus. Several 17+"" fish and one monster that snapped my line after a huge jump out the water. Rainy is much better than alot of the lakes I have fished farther north."
560360,Guest,2006-08-15 18:52:00,0,"Hugh, Glad to hear that you had a great time and caught nice fish. That is what it is all about, being where you want to and having a fun trip. I will wave when I go by to my favorite spot. Have Fun OYA"
560376,Guest,2006-08-16 07:49:00,0,"Other than the negative effects on local business, I wish more people drove right past Rainy. ;)"
560420,dutchboy,2006-08-17 20:14:00,5717,"Oh Yeah Again, keep driving by, the fish in Rainy are stunted and seldom reach more then 28"". Being this is the Canadian forum Rainy gets the amount of attention it should. :-) as stated earlier check the mentioned web site for Rainy info."
560421,Guest,2006-08-17 20:43:00,0,"dutchboy, I'm sure Rainy is a great Lake and fufills many fishermans dreams. I have been going to Lac Seul for the last 35 years and have some great friends in that area and we always catch our fair share of nice fish. Like I said earlier I fished Rainy years ago with my Dad and I too have many fond memories of Rainy but know its North for me. Enjoy, OYA"
