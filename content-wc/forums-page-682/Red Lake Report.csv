Went down West and spent a little time in the mountains. Bigger bears and no walleye over there... After a week over there all I could think about was slamming walleyes but my wife kept telling me to look at mountains.. Yeah o.k... Well I'm back and first thing Saturday Morning I picked up a couple buddies and headed to Slate Bay behind McKenzie Island... Slam fest, within the hour it was catch and release. MMMmmm where they ever tasty.. Caught two 20 lbs Northerns, one was chewing on the little walleye I had caught... Yepp the hogs were hungry early in the morn. We caught smaller ones as the day went on... I'm gettting ready for our Fall Classic on September Long. Gonna be fishing the West end pretty soon... For Info on Red Lake you can contact me:[email protected] Hope to hear from you. Mista W"

Looking at the amount of water there is to cover, a little advice on where to fish would go a long way. The fishing around here has been good for ""eater eyes"" and we would be looking for some ""quality"" fish to add to the photo album. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

Best advice is to fish the points and shorelines that the wind has been or is blowing on. Minnows were better than leeches. The water was cooler in the west end of the lake and the fishing better. A 28"" and 30"" walleye were caught in Wolf Narrows"
560379,Guest,2006-08-16 08:45:00,0,"Well I went out again yesterday with the Family. We all caught our limits within two hours in the middle of the afternoon. If you want Quality fish I'd go early Morn and evening fishing. The big ones tend to move in from the deep. Fisher Islands, Slate Bay area, Wolf Narrows. Behind MacKenzie Island is doing well this time of year. I've been fishing 22-35 feet off the reefs, points. I've also spotted them at 45 feet but I won't fish that deep. Minnows the best. But my tourney buddies would disagree, they enjoy there leeches. I like using those sucker minnows for the big ones but you do lose fish unless you use stingers. Happy Hunting. Mista W"

560698,Guest,2006-08-28 16:41:00,0,Are you able to use stingers in your up coming tournament!?!
560704,Guest,2006-08-28 19:40:00,0,"Yeppers, We are allowed to use stingers but I don't like using them. I'd rather pull up a half minnow then have the chance of pulling up a stressed fish. Sometimes they'll swallow the stingers if the fish is big enough. Not a pretty sight. To answer the question of banana Reef, my buddy took out his bottom end at 50 miles an hour on that baby...$10 000 Ouch... Enter Keg by the river from Red Lake, head left towards the Island and you'll definately hit it... It's not marked ... Mista W"
