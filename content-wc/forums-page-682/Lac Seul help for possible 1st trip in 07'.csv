560516,Guest,2006-08-21 11:51:00,0,Just got back a couple of days ago. Been going to Lac Seul Lodge resort for years. Never a bad experience. Dan McDonald takes care of everything.
560525,Mike Kansas,2006-08-21 19:08:00,1463,Been fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge for 17 years. Dan is a first class Lodge owner and does what is needed to make sure your stay at Lac Seul Lodge is enjoyable. We stay at his Black Bay outpost camp and I have stayed at his main Lodge. Both are great. Lac Seul is blessed with many fine resort owners and Dan is one of the best.
560545,Guest,2006-08-22 12:57:00,0,"Sounds like a great idea, that is, to create some memories with your family. There are some really good lodges on LS that will provide you with what you want. My personal favorite is Onaway Lodge,888-662-9291, located about 15 miles south of Ear Falls, just north of Perrault Falls. Great owners in Blair and Kathy Campell, great facilities etc. But like a previous post said, call soon to make your reservation. Most all of the LS camps provide a right of first refusal to this years guests for the following year. Call them directly during the eves, during the day camp owners are guiding, building, repairing etc. Many camp owners do a poor job of marketing, but then again they don't have too. Word of mouth is the best advertisement. And we provide that service."
560554,Guest,2006-08-22 16:13:00,0,"If you want to stay at a first class resort with the best rental boats on the lake, stay at Evergreen. They are the nicest resort owners I have met. Great fish house. Clean cabins. All around great place."
560586,Guest,2006-08-23 09:32:00,0,"All, Thanks you for the help. I emailed several(3-4)places on L/S 4-5 days ago and have not heard back from any of them yet? I assume they are busy running their respective lodges. I plan to call them and try and speak to them to see what they have to offer and what time(S) they have available. I did not call L/S/A who left their phone. I would not be comfortable on a 1st trip going to a place that I could not view online or see a brochure. Too many risks involved. They may be a great place/may not but we aren't willing to try that. From what research we have do so far there appears to be many fine places to stay it is just a matter of finding one that fits ours/lodges needs. I have also emailed a couple of individuals who have been fantastic in helping us find a place, Thanks You."
560458,Guest,2006-08-19 05:58:00,0,"All: I have never been to L/S and thought this would be a great place to get some information. I just started reading a few posts and it sounds like a great walleye lake. I am wanting to take my father and young(11) grandson somewhere and was thinking L/S may be the place for us. We like to catch about everything(smallmouth,northern,walleye crappie/perch) and was wondering about the above species. From what little I have read it sounds like a great walleye lake but I also wondered about the other species? We have been to LOTW a couple of times and it seems like ""you"" like L/S better? Could you also recommend a lodge(s) that offer housekeeping cabins and we typically bring our own boat. Also, we like to stay on the mainland nd not an island. We would also like suggestions for your thoughts on time of year to go as we are flexible but want to go during a great time(even though that means the weather may not be the best). Oh, we do not mind trailering our boat to another lake for a day if that means ""x"" lake has great bass fishing or great crappie fishing,etc. Thanks guys."
560462,Guest,2006-08-19 11:54:00,0,Right at the mouth of Vaughn Lake would mean right in the dead centre of the reserve. Is that correct?
560473,Guest,2006-08-19 18:01:00,0,"hello about ur question, we are not exactly in the middle of the ""reserve"" call for more details, you;ll see our number here sumwhere..."
560481,Guest,2006-08-19 23:25:00,0,"Hoosier, If I were you I would go to an established Resort on Lac Suel. By that I mean one that has been in business for years and has an established reputation. There are many fine Resorts on Lac Seul and a look on this site will tell you about many of them. Call ASAP as the good ones have a lot of repeat business and the faster you confirm reservations the better chance you have of having a great trip with a good outfitter."
560484,Guest,2006-08-20 08:04:00,0,No Thanks...Thanks I did a search and found 3-4 results mentioned and asked them the same questions and also asked them for literature. That was a couple days ago and I have not had an email response yet but I'm sure they're busy running their camps so I would expect to hear something this week. I also remember reading a thread about someone saying the smallmouth fishing on L/S was getting better every year. There seem to be a LOT of activity on L/S here on W/C and I am simply looking to try and find a nice place that has excellent fishing to take my father next year(07') and grandson(probably in 08'). Can you recommend and resorts and what is your opinion(s) about the fishing? Thanks.
560492,Guest,2006-08-20 11:28:00,0,"Hoosier....Check out the ""Lost Island Lac Seul"" post on this WC Canada site. There is good info about several Lac Seul Lodges. I have only been fishing Lac Seul for 5 years and we stay at a friends house close to the lake. The others who post are more knowledgable thn I."
560501,KSauers,2006-08-20 19:06:00,385,"according to, no thanks, noboby should ever open a new lodge because you should only go to established ones. I guess that means that if you are the first to open a lodge on a lake you should have that lake all to yourself because you are the only establiushed lodge there, but wait if you just opened up the first lodge on a lake you aren't established either. I guess there should be no lodges on any lake then. I would bet he either has something against the new lodge owners or he's a competitor that's afraid of compitition."
560508,dutchboy,2006-08-20 20:36:00,5717,"Or he could be like me. I prefer to have people pay to advertise on this site. This site provides a great service for all of us, without the advertising dollars I don't think it would continue to exist. Besides, how would you like to be one of the guy's who did write a check to advertise here? Just my opinion."
560511,KSauers,2006-08-20 21:05:00,385,"If that's his point,why not just say it like you did."
560512,Guest,2006-08-20 22:07:00,0,"KSauers, Sorry if I offended you but I do believe that a first timer to a lake will have a better opportunity to enjoy himself and catch more fish at an established resort. I also believe that Lac Seul Adventures is doing their best to take advantage of WC with its attempts to advertise their existence on this site. That indiscretion alone should tell us something about how they will run their lodge. Why dont you go there next year and tell us all about their quality of service."
