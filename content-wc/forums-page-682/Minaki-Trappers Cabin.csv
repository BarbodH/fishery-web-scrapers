560529,NW IA Mark,2006-08-21 22:16:00,17,"Trappers Cabin is at the north end or Big Sand, just west of the sand beach. Pick up any lake map and it should reference its location. I am heading towards Minaki tomorrow and so it was easy to put my hands on the map! Mark"
560530,Danny61,2006-08-21 22:28:00,42,"The spot that most people talk about and say ""trappers"" is a spot in the north east of Big Sand Lake the island your talking about is the entrance to Little Sand lake. When you leave the town of Minaki(not an actual lake)your exiting Gun Lake for the Winnipeg River System the island I think your referring to is the entrance to Little Sand, which will lead you to Big Sand and then depending on the size of your boat 15minutes later your in Big Sand. Travel to the North East corner till you see a beautiful beach(called the beach)also a great fishing area then head due north you'll see two rocky pionts this is what is called trappers. You can fish either point if you wish and the rock piles not far away. But be careful cause if the wind picks up your in for a bumpy ride back and if you (heaven forbid) have engine failure theres no one to come get you cause Big Sand is empty this year."

560562,Hammer_74,2006-08-22 17:38:00,18,"I'd like to thank you all for your unput. Danny61, you hit it right on the head as to what i was after Thank you all again. I'm hoping the big walleyes are still in big sand as apparently by mid september they are usually dispersed. Does anyone know if there is any campgrounds(tenting) situated on the lake or any islands that have good spots for camping? Looking foreward to your input"
560584,Guest,2006-08-23 08:38:00,0,"It's been many many many years since I camped up there so I'm not sure what the regs are now. You would probably just need a camping permit if anything. There are a few good islands up towards Big Sand that you could camp on. Sorry I can't be more specific, I don't have a map handy and what I call the islands would be different than what would be on the map."
560602,Danny61,2006-08-24 01:32:00,42,"The camps are so empty right now you really shouldn't have to camp try sunset resort and ask Ken what he has for you 807 224-1092. If you set on camping try the east side of Big Sand. go past Green Island and head west you'll see a great beach watch for rocks but you should be able to go right to shore then its sand beach luxury all the way baby.Just a word to the wise the bears have nothing to eat this year to dry no berries, so camp smart(take a dog or a 30odd30) cause no food makes them aggressive, unlees your planning on having a new rug in your living room. Have fun and look for a Alumacraft 175 pro tourney with a 115 merc and say hello its either me or my fishing buddy who has a cottage out there."
560607,Guest,2006-08-24 08:07:00,0,If it were me I wouldn't camp on the beach......too many bears and bugs.
560619,Guest,2006-08-24 11:48:00,0,"I'd be a bit wary of camping at the beach too simply because it attracked garbage bears. To often people clean there fish close by or throw there lunch in the bush. Plus there is not much wind shelter there. As far as I know there is no need for camping permits, and before you pack a rifle on a camping trip read the reg very closely. A co can tell very easly if it was self defence or just a scared camper. In all my years of camping I've never needed a rifle for bear defence. We've had one case at the cottage ,but in reality it was our fault that we have food out on the counter when the bear came through the open screened window. Before bed drink a lot of beer. You'll sleep right through any bear wondering in your camp . Works for me Lots of good camping island along away to big sand, sorry without my map I can't really give pin point places . I can just suggest go along the shore line and you'll see where others have set up before"
560621,Guest,2006-08-24 11:55:00,0,"Hammer....I just remembered a really good camping spot up there. It's a small island in Hidden Lake (the only island). It's a good place to camp out of the wind and away from bears with a nice spot to pull the boat in. It's conveniant to Big Sand as well. The entrance to Hidden lake (I've always called it lost lake) is on the SE side of Big Sand, look on the map you can't miss it."
