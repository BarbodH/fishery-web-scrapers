I just wish pepole would get there facts stright before they shoot there mouth off Paradise Cove is not closed for the season The bar is closed due to very slow traffic but he has 31 of the 45 cabins open for his guests. As for raping the resources maybe people should talk to the man and listen to what he has to say and some of the things he preaches to his guests about releasing all oversize fish to keep the fishing great for years to come. Or how he feels about only droping the limit for non Canadians and still allowing us canadians to rape the fishery by taking double the limit that us fishermen can. I as a Canadian feel ashamed that we would blame some one else for trying to ruin a fishery then allow our citizens to continue to take more fish than we need just because we can. There now that I've had my little rant I would like to say that the fishing this year has being the best that it has being in 10 years maybe not in large fish but in numbers, but with the new size limits the large fish will return very soon. Then we will all be able to go to Minaki and catch those hogs all day long,"
560653,Danny61,2006-08-26 01:16:00,42,I'll see you at the co-ed not fishing the red lake to far and no room. I usually fish with J.L.Dungay the frenchman or better yet we fish a alumacraft tourney pro. Then I'll be fishing Pine Falls just have to ask JL if he wants to do it. Do you know if anyone fished noname during the roach cause thats what I would have done if I could have found a ride out to Minaki for the tourney. Good luck out a Red all the chat is talking about fishinf wolf narrows
560657,Guest,2006-08-26 09:23:00,0,"Noname held a lot of big fish but not a lot of slot fish.I know u now Dan Toth.Could have got u a ride up to minaki,could have taken u out for the day.Do u know or have Rene Baccunis phone number?I will see u on the red river Danny"

560617,Guest,2006-08-24 11:17:00,0,"Tons, how did the clasic work now that Americans can only catch 2 walleyes, and resident 4 walleyes. I heard in a previous tourny this year they didn't allow any fish over the 17 3/4"" size. It was the boat with the limit of fish that had the most of slot size fish. Obviously this one you were allowed one over. Also what was the big fish in the clasic ? PLus I would have to agree that fishing has been the best in years. Lots of slot fish , big fish and all kinds of below slot. As for the rough rock narrows I haven't fished there for about a month now. But now as the water starts to cool, that becomes more of a place I start to focus on. From past the first marker up about a 1/2 mile is where I spend the bulk of my time. Without my map here it's hard to give exact pin point places, but if you have a good detail map of yourself there are obvious starting places. Over the years we have caught a lot of big fish in there. Plus not that I fish musky's but we've had a lot of big musky's grab our fish prier to landing in that stretch."

560620,Guest,2006-08-24 11:52:00,0,We were allowed to have 4 fish.2 each in the boat.No big fish allowed in either tournament.
560642,Danny61,2006-08-25 12:23:00,42,Toney good to see you out fishing the Roach in that sleek red ranger to bad in the classic you let Kesler slip by you on day two.No quality fish in roughrock or under the bridge? did gary fish big sand both days or did he fish in the river? he's also got that little spot opposite Muncers point. See you at Pine Falls keep up the great fishing
560643,Guest,2006-08-25 13:06:00,0,"Hi danny not sure which danny u are.I had the whole reef to myself sat till ten oclock ,reef quarter mile from the rock pile.Roach came up and fished there both days,amateurs told me he caught all his fish there after the tourney.It was no problem he came up.Made me feel good Roach came to fish my spot lol.First day what i threw out i could have won it dam.Second day caight lots up there on my spot just were all just a little over.As for Alex that lucky bugger actually he is very good not lucky.Going to red lake tuesday, then red river coed, then my fav two pinefalls.40 more sleeps lol.Do i fish the tourneys"
560485,NW IA Mark,2006-08-20 08:11:00,17,"We are heading up to Minaki in two days, wondering if anyone is just returning? Looking for the basics - water level, availability of bait, how was the walleye bite. We stay at Barbers and spend our time fishing Big Sand (Rock Pile, Green Island, Pine Island, & Trappers). Any areas to try other than Big Sand? Someone had a post earlier about fishing current - I assume Roughrock? Any detail on where to target walleye on Roughrock, we would give a try. Thanks, Mark"
560487,Danny61,2006-08-20 10:31:00,42,"Haven't been up to Minaki for 2 weeks but I can tell you the late night trolling bite has been great Reef Runners(grey ghost) and #9 Pearl shads beening the best cranks probably 125 to 150 ft back. In Rough Rock go to the lodge and fish the narrows right in front you'll find a ton of walleye using any kind of bait.Dont forget to try noname in the morning but watch out for that big musky that hangs on that hump cause she'll turn off the walleye in a hurry.In general the walleye, pike, smallies and musky fishing has all been fair to good with the odd big girls being caught in every catagory.Enjoy yourself and dont be surprised if you have the hole lake to yourself cause the Gary Roach Pro Am just finished and there's no one fishing out there right now."
560489,NW IA Mark,2006-08-20 10:53:00,17,"Thanks for the update. I have seen other posts that made mention of 'noname' is this an island? Where is it located? I can't wait for that 1st boat ride up to the north end of Big Sand! Thanks again, Mark"
560493,IaCraig,2006-08-20 12:35:00,434,"No name is what we always call the reef about 1/8th mile off the NE corner of burnt island. (my directions might be messed up, if Green is NW of Burnt, this reef is NE)."
560588,Guest,2006-08-23 11:30:00,0,"Fished a tournament ther last weekend,all i can say is the fishin was awsome,best its ever been in years.We caught 200 walleyes a day and 9 fish in two day between 26 and 29 inches.Where did all those walleye come from in one year.All in big sand"
560589,Guest,2006-08-23 11:32:00,0,LOL
560590,Guest,2006-08-23 12:04:00,0,u dont believe?
560600,Guest,2006-08-24 00:09:00,0,who did you fish with? were you a pro or Amateur? hope you were in the money cause 26-29 inchers give you nothing. Herd Gary Roach won his own tourney hope he was fishing big sand cause that's were all the big slots are this time of year probably using worms as well. Anyway give up some info as I'll be out in a couple of weeks guideing and dont have much time to scout around
560608,Guest,2006-08-24 08:10:00,0,"Hey tons, are you the same guy that wrote the sign on Paradise Cove's door explaining why you were closed for the season already? Heard you could only get 24 boats for a 50 boat tournament. Face it, the fishing has gone down hill and its your fault. Time to find a new system and rape the resource there."
560609,Guest,2006-08-24 08:36:00,0,Paradise closed early?
