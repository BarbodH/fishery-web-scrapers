560027,Guest,2006-08-05 21:24:00,0,"Chimo is great for walleye. A few nice portage lakes, and great outposts. At a couple of the northern ones its tough to catch anything under 21"". We went there for 30 years. Give it a shot."
560269,bugsy,2006-08-12 07:33:00,49,Which Chimo lakes in particular were tough to catch <21 inchers.
