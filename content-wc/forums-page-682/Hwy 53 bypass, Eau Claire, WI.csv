560645,Guest,2006-08-25 13:27:00,0,Did it open up? How is it around Duluth?
560648,wiggle,2006-08-25 18:14:00,400,"The bypass is all open now. Not sure when you went thru Duluth last, but, they were reconstructing highway 53 that went up the hill past the mall. They are almost done. It is open going up the hill, but once you get to the top, they are still working on making it 4 lanes. The highway is open thru the construction. It is much better than it used to be. Brad"

The part of the hill that was redone is perfect. Nice wide lanes, no lights, the weird 6 way intersection is gone. Nice job guys."
560680,Sutsgold,2006-08-27 20:24:00,219,Anyone have a guestimate of how much time we will save using the new 53 bipass as compared to going through town?
560682,Guest,2006-08-28 01:36:00,0,It took me 7 minutes on the bypass the other day compared to 20 or more going the old route.
