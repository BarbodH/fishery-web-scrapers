Trailer Guy, I am interested in what you have to say about bait, location, depth, etc. Also, I know that you have highly recommended the owner of Sleepy Dog as a good source for fishing info. All I really care about is having enough walleyes to eat while we are there...we rarely, if ever, take anything home. I get a conservation license, use barbless hooks, use a quick hook set and a rapid landing with a rubber net. I only keep 16"" fish and smaller to eat. All northern pike are released. Also, I am going to visit a couple of camps on Lac Seul during our stay at Sleepy Dog. This is a prep for next summer with three long time fishing buddies. We will be fishing walleyes, same rules as we will use on Wabaskang. Any recommendations will be welcomed; we would like to not have to travel too far, but I have a 50 hp four stroke on a 17.5 foot boat so am not too contrained. Thanks for the help! Dr. Lee"

Most likely the fish will be on humps and rock points in 20' or so depending on water temp. But don't discount weed lines either, the edges up at the second narrows work most evenings by then. I like evening fishing especially shady areas that get less light penatration. The big lake or Keynote would be good starting points. But Tommy will know where people have been catching fish. If they get a good lighting storm the walleye tend to get their eyes dazzled and they lay on the bottum with lock jaw, like they did the 1st of July. But you can still find fish. Pike should be along the weed beds, use large artificals and cast for them. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

We CPR all except enough for a few shore lunches. I will have my two boys 9 and 11 along so hope to keep their interest in gamefish but will switch to perch if required. Thanks"

560672,Trailerguy,2006-08-26 20:41:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I haven't been there since July, but there hasn't been much rain, so It's likely on the low side of things. The temperatures have moderated lately so you'd think the fish should be biting OK, but mostly in deeper spots. The posts on canadafeverdotcom indicate they are as well.
