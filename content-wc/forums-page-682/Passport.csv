Once you get them you'll be glad you did - makes things a heck of a lot easier. The instructions and forms are now all available on line, and the Post Office even takes your passport photos right there (at least our local Post Office does), which makes everything pretty simple.

The airline insisted I have a PASSPORT to enter the plane going to Canada and once arrived, it was expected that I provide a passport at immigrations into Canada. When I drove in last year thru Int. Falls, all I needed was a drivers license or birth certificate, but I had a passport anyway because it is easier and safer. I understood that you will not need passports for DRIVING until 2007."
560634,Guest,2006-08-25 05:23:00,0,Passports are NOT required until 08. Some AIRLINES require them. Went to Mexico for wedding and our airline would not allow us on without them even for 1 and 3 year old grandchildren. The US has set these requirements.
560639,voyaguer,2006-08-25 12:09:00,54,"This pretty much stacks up with what I experienced. When the immigrations person in Winnipeg asked for a passport, I decided not to argue since I had one, but perhaps I could have ""here's my drivers license"" and see what happens (Not !!) . FYI, if you have ever had a DUI in the states, always use a passport, not your drivers license, to avoid potential problems. There is a whole lot of info on this site and others regarding this so I won't go further except to offer that advice."
