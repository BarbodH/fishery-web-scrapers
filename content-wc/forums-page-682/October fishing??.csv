Not sure what to expect; how's the fishing, weather, wind conditions, where to fish(still on humps and points), etc. Can anyone help????"

Be prepared for Indian summer with mild temps in the 70s or consecutive days with wind and snow when daytime temp doesn't get above 40 degrees. Generally though, in early Oct. you can expect daytime temps in mid-50s and nights in the 30s. Fall fishing can be outstanding. Good chance for big numbers and a trophy. And you'll have the lake mostly to yourself. It's beautiful time of year, too. Fall colors, moose and deer in the rut, ducks and geese moving through, and always a fire in the stove."
