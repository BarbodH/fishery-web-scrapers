559872,Guest,2006-07-31 16:15:00,0,"Try ""Shelias"" on the east side of the road at the north end of town. Shelia has it all and you can have a great time doing it. Tell Shelia that Smokey sent you."

559912,Guest,2006-08-01 17:41:00,0,no lie here guys but two buddies and i were up at the snake pit in may and met 4 of the best looking girls i've seen in there we went and talked to the and they were home for the summer from college. we sat and drabk a few drinks with tthem and the next day hit up red lake golf course. These gals were all 20 years old and us guys were 23 besides fishing that was the best time we had up there. oh and we went back up to meet them at norseman days last week........ nowhere to be found im starting to think that all those drinks were making us imagine things.

560594,Guest,2006-08-23 17:53:00,0,from what I recall - you want to stay clear of the snakepit -- there are no hotties and only trouble there!
