We usually try to go off of Robinson's Rock.(Big rock pile sticking out of water about 2 miles into the bay) Just go to the rock pile and go east. You will be in 10-12 feet of water, depending on water level. About 500 yards out, you will see it dropping off on your depth finder to 22 feet. Sit on the edge and anchor up and jig. Keep moving on the edges until you find the fish. If that is slow, put some plugs on and troll the flats of the bay."
