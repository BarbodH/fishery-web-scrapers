Everything is clean and well kept. And the staff is friendly and helpful. The fishing was a little more challenging than the last time I was there. We still caught a lot of fish and good sized fish, we just had to try a little harder.We got Walleyes on the weed edges in ~7 to 11 feet deep, but we got more on rocky points in 12 to 24 feet deep. Between the two of us we caught at least 20 walleye between 23"" and 27.5"", and at least 200 between 12"" and 22"" with most of them in the 16"" to 20"" range. We could have caught more but finding them is part of the fun, so after catching a few we move on to look for new schools.We got Walleye trolling, casting and jigging, but by far most of the fish were caught on Lindy rigs with a 1/2 oz weight and a gumdrop floating jig with either a minnow or a leech. Some days the leeches worked better and some days the minnows worked better and small minnows ( 1.5""-2"" ) worked better than larger minnows.We also caught a 42"" and a 36"" Tiger Musky and missed 1 more and had 20+ follows. All in the weeds, but some of the other guests said they were doing better on rocks.We met WC member prov1800, AKA John, talked for about an hour. He's a heck of a nice guy and seems to really know how to fish the area. I would call him first if I wanted to hire a guide in the Eagle, Cedar, Lac Seul area."

4064506,Skywagon,2015-07-21 05:00:00,1106,"Heard (but cannot confirm) yesterday that Wayne Clark put his Cub down in the bush while flying out of one of his minnow ponds, no serious injuries, but supposedly totaled the Cub. I was told he called for help on his Sat phone and walked to a nearby lake to be picked up. A tough guy."
