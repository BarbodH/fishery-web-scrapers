Getting to the check-out, was informed they longer take Visa. As Cabela's card is Visa, we will probably go back to picking up the extra needed stuff at Thunder Bay, like we used to a few years ago. The reason given was that Visa charges the firm more than Mastercharge, etc. Poor management decision, in my opinion, but maybe no big deal to ""No-Frills"". Bill"
4077098,adempsey,2015-07-26 10:51:00,963,"Interesting. ""No Frills"" is part of the largest grocery store chain in Canada. However, the No Frills stores might be franchised stores so they make their own rules? I don't know. I agree with you though, not accepting Visa because of fees is an antiquated decision for large businesses.edit: Looks like none of them accept Visa or AmEx. Didn't know that. They do have a bank as well and only offer Mastercard, so that probably has something to do with it as well."

4077290,Guest,2015-07-26 13:01:00,0,Sams Club doesn't take Visa also. At least in the U.S. Not sure about Canada.
4077378,Hawkfan,2015-07-26 14:05:00,237,"Sam's Club will take Visa debit, just not Visa credit. Their store brand card is also MC so it may have something to do with it, but I would guess it has to do with fees."
