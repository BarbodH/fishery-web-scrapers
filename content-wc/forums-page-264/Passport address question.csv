4045425,Obabikon,2015-07-14 05:52:00,2370,You're correct there too. They won't ask for both ID's at the border.
4045473,pjshorthorn,2015-07-14 06:01:00,5654,"Your passport should have the personal data and emergency contact information updated each time a person moves. A person's address and their emergency contact's address is written in on this page, typically page 4 of the passport.This should be written in pencil so it can be changed at any time over the 10 year period a passport is valid. Remember to also have your signature on page 3. I've stood behind many a passenger checking in for flights who have forgotten to sign their passport upon receiving it. You don't need that headache at the border....you'll end up possibly having to produce additional documentation trying to validate the passport actually belongs to you beyond just the photo.

4047049,38bill,2015-07-14 12:00:00,331,Used to be you needed a DL or a passport. Since the passport is required now you don't need the DL.
4047153,Lovetofish,2015-07-14 12:20:00,458,I just came back Friday through Pigeon River. The agent asked for both Passport and Drivers License. Now our son is now in the working world living on his own and has a new address. He updated his Driver's Licenses is all. We had no trouble getting through.
4051706,Ferrispata,2015-07-16 06:14:00,63,"You should still bring your DL if you are driving your vehicle around Canada though. But as others have said, you wouldn't need it at the border."
4051858,sloughboy,2015-07-16 06:54:00,13,"This year about 45 minutes from Baudette, I realized I had forgotten my passport, sick feeling 8 hours from home. I did a quick search and found the numbers for the boarder agents on both sides. Both sides were extremely understanding. They both said a drivers license would get you in and out. Now I wouldn't want to count on this on a continual basis, as I have my passport already packed for the August trip. I cant say how well this was problem was handled by both sides, no lectures, just smiles and laughter."
4053514,youngknight,2015-07-16 16:51:00,228,"WOW. I'm a Canadian and highly doubt that if the situation had been reversed that I would be allowed into the US with just a DL and a phone call. My experience entering the US is no smiles or laughter, mirth, sense of humor...or any humor at all."
4072498,alanexpup,2015-07-24 00:11:00,278,"HI. this was the first time we went to Canada in 10 years. the last time we crossed all we needed for Canada was our drivers license, to get back in the states the passport was needed. this year we gave the Canadian person our DL and she gave them back saying passports only please. what a surprise, lucky we had them handy. I never saw anything anywhere that this was the new process. oh well live and learn."
4072754,bigwalleye1,2015-07-24 06:18:00,2632,"I had the same thing happen earlier this month. got to the crossing with my Dad, heading north, asked for my passport from the glovebox where it was since the last trip in June. Dad hands it to me, along with his. I gave em a quick look before I gave them to the CDN agent and realized I HAVE MY BRO IN LAWS passport. Guess where mine was...at his house. She was very nice, asked when I was trhere last, looked at my DL, and let us pass. We're on the way home and I kind of dreaded the crossing back to the states. Gave the agent in MN the same story, he asked for the DL, reviewed it, asked when I was there last, who I was with, what date I crossed last, if we had anything to declare, and sent us on our way. I apologized for the error, and he suggested next time I look before I leave home, and commented that, absent the beard, my BIL looks kinda like me and laughed."
4041913,Fishin Fun,2015-07-13 07:27:00,218,One of the guys in our group moved in the past year and now the address on his passport doesn't match his driver's license. We are leaving in about 2 1/2 weeks for Lac Seul. Any ideas if he'll have any border issues?
4042017,CI_Guy,2015-07-13 07:47:00,2118,"I've never had an address listed anywhere on my passport. There is only Nationality with United States of America listed and place of birth with Minnesota, U.S.A. listed."
4042057,ftfarms,2015-07-13 07:59:00,444,He will be fine. We gave them our DL with our passports one year and the boarder patrol gave our license back and said he did need them.
4042089,Fishin Fun,2015-07-13 08:09:00,218,Thanks for the input guys. I told him I didn't think it should be a problem.
4042121,Bowtech84,2015-07-13 08:14:00,572,Just crossed on the 5th of July and crossed back in to the states on Saturday. My address is different on my DL than what's on my passport and I had no issues. They said they didn't need to see our DL.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
4043929,Shellback,2015-07-13 16:20:00,8083,"I've never had to show my D/L, just the passport. Just be sure when they ask him where he lives, to use the town on the passport."
4044409,erino,2015-07-13 18:26:00,399,"When dealing with border agents I have found out that you should only give them what they ask for, nothing more, nothing less. I have never had one ask for a DL."
4044929,Obabikon,2015-07-13 20:50:00,2370,"I've seen a TON of US passports, and I've never seen one with an address on it. Strange. Either way... they won't care."
4045025,LoDo,2015-07-13 21:10:00,721,Leave the DL at home. It isn't needed.
4045345,Shellback,2015-07-14 05:11:00,8083,"Just looked at mine, you are correct. Quite often I am asked where I live, I imagine they are looking at my address on a computer screen and want to confirm it."
