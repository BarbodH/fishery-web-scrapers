Note to forum members: I heard from Mike exactly 1 minute after he posted this report and he was leaving at 3:00 a.m., earlier today, on his next fishing venture. After posting his report all Mike had to do was pack, sleep fast and head out at 3:00 a.m. Hope he had help driving so he could figure out a way to sleep on the way."

The color looks good for the tannin colored water on Upper Goose. I probable won't have room for it in my tackle box but will get some anyway. Thanks Itsme"
