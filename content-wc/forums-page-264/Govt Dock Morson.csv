4073394,IL John,2015-07-24 11:11:00,45,We are planning one launching from morson govt dock on Sunday . We are going to a boat in cabin in sabaskong. Has anybody had any problems leaving there trucks and trailer there. Just want to make sure our stuff is safe for a week
4073482,johnboat,2015-07-24 11:49:00,2014,I haven't left my truck and trailer at the government parking lot before so I can't answer your question......But I have just down the road at Pier North. It will certainly be safe there and the charge is minimal.
4073690,Shorelunch,2015-07-24 13:18:00,554,We have a cabin just past there. I would feel fine leaving a vehicle there. Just take the normal precautions.
4073698,Bill Krejca,2015-07-24 13:19:00,6107,"Most of the camps near Morson will allow launching and leaving vehicle for a nominal fee, most are relatively secure.. Bill"
4073762,IL John,2015-07-24 13:52:00,45,Thx for the replies
4073986,MikeMcC,2015-07-24 16:31:00,72,The only problem that I have had is a lack of parking spaces. If that happens just launch at a resort.
4074530,ftfarms,2015-07-24 22:41:00,444,Government dock free pier north $35. One is secure one is not. I'll pay the $35. We where told no one has had a problem parking there but there's always a first.

4075138,Bill Krejca,2015-07-25 10:15:00,6107,"I don't remember ever paying that much ($35) fora week's parking at a resort. Some just charge for launch, it has been a few years, though. Bill"
