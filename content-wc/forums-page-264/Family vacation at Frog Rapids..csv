It's our second year going to Canada and staying at Frog Rapids Camp, we really enjoy staying there. The fishing was excellent but the people really made the trip special. Got a lot of good advice and tips from many in camp on fishing spots and more importantly navigating LS. Especially glad bigwalleye1 stopped by our cabin this year and last. Package arrived here today, you sir are top notch! See you in camp next year."
