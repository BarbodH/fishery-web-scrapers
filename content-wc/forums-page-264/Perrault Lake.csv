4075834,bigdaddyguns,2015-07-25 16:38:00,608,"alan, What was the stealth approach/technique you used?"
4075906,alanexpup,2015-07-25 17:36:00,278,"HI. as it was explained to me the simpler the presentation the better. with a fluorocarbon of about 12 feet tied to your line tie on a small hook about the size of your pinky finger and then 2 feet up the line just 2 split shot weights. hook on a leache , cast it out and let the boat drift with the light wind. the leache will look normal with the light hook and split shot. the fish wont even know its been hooked till its too late. at first I thought it was a fluke but after the first couple fish it was all in the presentation. good luck."
3947537,team walleye,2015-06-08 18:47:00,336,Heading up this Saturday morning!! Can't wait.. anyone else heading up there next week??
3951569,team walleye,2015-06-09 19:13:00,336,We now stay at Rainbow point.. We did stay at Rocky Dhore for about 4 years. Both are great lodges. Did you catch any good sized Walleye?
3951713,JOE WALLEYE,2015-06-09 19:53:00,753,"My boat partner and I caught walleye up to about 25"" but we moved a lot looking for fast action. Other boots in our group worked areas harder and caught nice fish up to 29"". We ran a long way for the best action. Most consistent bite for 15"" and larger walleye was at the south end of the west arm of cedar for us."
3953945,team walleye,2015-06-10 13:04:00,336,I have seen and heard about a few musky being cut there. I have never really fished Cedar much. All of our walleyed have come from Perrault and the Ord.
3954089,BlueJayBert,2015-06-10 14:34:00,15,"Heading up on the 20th...any idea of when the Mayfly hatch might happen and if you are on the lake during the hatch do you change any fishing techniques because of it ie. fish deeper, fish for smallies etc."
3954745,team walleye,2015-06-10 19:31:00,336,Last time we were up there I believe the 20th was towards the end of our trip and our lodge owner said we would miss it by a week or two. Sounds like the hatch an make for some tough fishing!
3958281,team walleye,2015-06-11 20:50:00,336,Leaving at 2am Saturday morning!!
