4075914,fishpoop,2015-07-25 17:40:00,630,"""PARTS FROM WINNIPEG TAKES A WEEK!!"" So I've been told over and over again by just about every camp, resort, or marina I've ever dealt with anywhere in N.W. Ontario. Memorize that line and use it to be your guide in packing tools and equipment for a fishing trip in Canada... Parts from Winnipeg take a week. In thinking back I don't think I've ever gone to Canada without having some sort of mechanical breakdown or troubles. I've had my outboard engine block crack on me, many flat tires, water pump impeller fail, carburator intakes gum up, even the bowstop on my trailer ended up missing in action on one trip. Oh, and I do my required maintenance all the time so these problems weren't due to lack of effort on my part. That missing trailer bowstop is a good example. The resort was right next to a marina on Sabaskong Bay. I thought I'd easily get a bowstop there as a replacement. Well, parts from Winnipeg...You can go into any marina here in Minnesota and get any number of sizes and styles of bowstops right off the shelf, a simple and common item. But up there they don't stock inventory like they do here because they don't have the business so they have to special order any part(s) you might want. It was easier for me to drive back to Minnesota and cross the border again and go to a marina near Baudette and get a replacement bowstop to fix my trailer rather than try and order it through the Canadian marina and wait a week in which it might not have arrived in time before my trip was over and I had to leave.Now if you have a problem with your outboard motor chances are your fishing trip is ruined unless you have the parts with you. I now carry a water pump impeller, timing belt, oil filter and oil, an original manufacture equipment trailer wiring harness, you name it and most likely I have a spare for it packed in my gear when going to Ontario because... Parts from Winnipeg take a week.If you got the parts chances are you can find a competent marine mechanic to fix the problem if you can't fix it yourself. So even if you don't think you need it, pack it along anyhow."

I try to keep it at a minimum but as the years and trips have taught me plan for problems. I know I have the rod, reels, and tackle covered. The tools and gear are what I'm wondering about. MY list includes sockets, screwdrivers, a small electrical repair kit, spare prop, battery charger, extension cords, electrical tape, duct tape, penetrating oil, small floor jack, jumper cables, rope, small grease gun, and a tow strap. Anybody think of a necessity for repairs I have overlooked? I've had to change props up there twice, replace leaf springs, change tires, repair electronics, and replace plugs. Thanks for any tips. I'm in countdown mode."
4067754,law57,2015-07-22 06:41:00,1147,"I take extra wheel bearings (trailer) and dust caps. The caps come with the new bearings anyway. they aren't as good as Bearing buddy's. But they'll get you where you're going. I have a few dozen 3-gallon plastic pails. Food stuff came in them originally - so the lids are gasketed (great for camp stools and they float too!). I have everything to fix a bad bearing - short of a destroyed spindle. This includes channel lock pliers, new cotter pins, grease, hubs, Go-Jo, rubber gloves and paper towel. Changing bearings on the road can be a messy job - nice to clean up after. When I put new bearings on my trailer I just save the old ones (if good) and re-pack them. I put them into small ziploc bags. Same with old hubs. Bearings and hubs have gone up a lot lately. But years ago it didn't cost much more to just buy new hubs (with the races installed). Anyway, twice (over the years), I've stopped to help people who had bearing issues. They were very grateful. Oh - I also carry some emery paper strips - to clean up the spindle if necessary. There may be other stuff in the pail - I don't remember. And I carry a small soft-sided bag with wiring supplies - fuses, extra wire, butt connectors, tester, stripper/crimper, bulbs, flat connector loop, cable ties, etc. I don't like to follow people who's lights don't work - so I make sure mine do."

4067874,Andyeye,2015-07-22 07:31:00,179,"The wheel bearing stuff is a good idea. I just had mine changed but I've seen several smoking wheels on trailers over the years. My electric repair kit does include a multi meter, test light, and spare bulbs. I'm not a fan of following people with no trailer lights either."
4068050,Golden Eagle,2015-07-22 08:17:00,2642,"Back in 1960 my wife and I spent 7 weeks camping and fishing around the Chapleau area. Slept on the ground every night but 2. Took all our gear, including an old Evinrude and fuel tank. Packed it all into a 1960 Austin Healey (Bugeye) Sprite. I had the cherry red Sprite and another couple made the trip in their 1960 BRG AH Sprite. We had the bare essentials and made them do the job. Would shop for groceries, spend $5 and wife would have to hold them on her lap due to lack of storage room. Hitchhikers didn't bother to show us their thumb."

4071810,law57,2015-07-23 16:44:00,1147,"Yes - I have a 'dedicated' tote for that stuff. I keep the list right in the tote. In addition to what you have, zip locks, mouse traps, oil of peppermint (keeps mice away as well as moth balls but easier to tolerate), extension cords, plastic cups... a whole bunch of stuff that can sit in the basement from trip to trip including everything you have there except the cresent wrench and gloves. That's in my tool box. I have a plastic bag with towels and old gloves. I use it mainly in the fall. A towel to dry your hands and (nearly) dry gloves is really nice on a rainy 43F day with a 20mph wind! When I get home I wash them and put them in a clean bag for next time. As I assume most of you do, I have a list of stuff - over the years it has changed - but it's cloths, meds, bug dope, sun screen, tooth brush - you know. A list that can be checked off so you are sure you have everything."
