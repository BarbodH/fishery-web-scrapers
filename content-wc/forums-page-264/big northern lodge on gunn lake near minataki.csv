4030129,DeBo,2015-07-08 06:31:00,211,Is this Big North Lodge on Gunn Lake near the hamlet of Minaki? Not aware of a Gunn lake in the English River system area near Minnitaki. I fish the Winnipeg River system every year for musky. Catch a fair number of pike while I'm at it. As a general rule the best pike fishing is in Big Sand which is a fair Jaunt from Big North but not too bad and it is quite scenic starting a couple miles north of Minaki. Nav Bouys the whole way. Muskies are all over the system. The only place I haven't caught/seen them is upstream of the Dalles.

My wife caught multiple 40 inch northerns in the small eastern bay above the larger eastern bay in Roughrock. On our fishing club's trips we caught large numbers of muskies in Roughrock and Little Sand. We also got a 43 inch northern and and a few muskies south of the bridge, but not nearly as good there. We fished Gunn Lake a few times and didn't do as well there. Disclaimer: I haven't been there in a good ten years. I really love the place!Frank"

4071730,BreezyPoint,2015-07-23 16:12:00,1581,"As I said, it's been about ten years since I was there and I don't know what may have changed.I never stayed at Roughrock Lodge, but we caught muskies all over Roughrock Lake, quite a few within a two-three minute ride from the lodge. I'll give you a little hint- out of all the lakes I have fished for muskies I never saw one where the muskies were so focused by the wind. We would go from point to point and find them sitting just barely in the lee of the point. This would happen on virtually every point the wind blew across. I need to get back up there some day. I made three trips and had great Muskie fishing every time. Roughrock and Little Sand were my favorite lakes. In one (not windy bay) on Roughrock, I caught a 43, 44, and 45 on three straight casts. Not giants, but I am sure I will never see that againFrank"
