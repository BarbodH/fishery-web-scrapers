Caught quite a few walleyes over 20 inches. Biggest one was 27. Lot's of Pike although we didn't target Pike. Largest Pike was 37. Fished spinners and salties, jigs, and the last day I went to 4 inch swimbaits tipped with a saltie. They hammered the swimbait. An older camp that could use an update. Not very well set up for housekeeping. Most of their business is American plan. Dock guys were great. We were there only 4 days. But it was a good time."
