4073570,SinOrSwim,2015-07-24 12:23:00,1528,"Spent a few days at Hawk Lake Lodge. This is our 2nd trip. Unfortunately with schedules we have only been able to fish a couple days each time. Overall it was a great trip. Me, my son and my father in law. On the way up it was sunny and nice. Then, some dark clouds were to our north. My son asked.......is it going to rain? I said, probably not but possibly. So, I quickly grabbed my phone and pulled up the radar. Radarscope is a great app. Uhhhh, yes not only was it going to rain there was a HUGE area of hail directly in front of us. We were only a mile or so from the next exit. We pulled over, needed gas anyway, and filled up. We just stayed under the canopy knowing what was coming. And, HAIL it did. lol About 5 minutes of marble size hail. As we were sitting there cars were coming from everywhere trying to find a spot under the canopy. We took our time going up. Stopped in Sioux Narrows at Big Johns Mineshaft for lunch. What a great view over LOTW. Arrived at HLL about 3pm. Teds staff greeted us, offered us a beer and showed us around a bit. We actually stopped and looked at a cabin for sale by owner on our way in. Teds staff unloaded our gear and hauled it to our cabin and I think we were fishing by 4pm. I can't say enough nice things about the staff there. Fishing was slow that first evening. Decided to head out the next morning before breakfast. Went to an area one of the guides showed us. Spent about 90 minutes there and were getting close to going in for breakfast when my father in law hooked into one. You could tell it was a bigger fish. My son was able to net it and as he was measuring the 29"" walleye I was taking pictures. I had set my pole down and had my foot on the handle. BOOM! It goes over. My son nets that one too!!! Turned out to be a 32.5"" walleye. Hectic and borderline chaos in the boat would be sort of putting it mildly. lol But, we were able to get both fish released quickly. The only problem with this, looking back, was the lack of quality pictures. I thought I got go pro of my fish but I had it set to still and ended up with a random picture of the net. Spent the afternoon chasing smallies and as usual had a blast doing that. Biggest was 17"" but a lot of fish in the 10 to 12"" range. So much fun to move along the shoreline and toss a small jig. We got to the point we didn't bait. Just a small jig and a twister tail was enough. The next day we had a guide. This was probably one of the most enjoyable days I have ever spent fishing. We honestly didn't catch much. But, it wasn't for lack of effort. We hit a lot of areas and more importantly he was telling us what we were looking for, we tried different baits, depths etc. I ahve always spent too much time in a non-producing spot. He also was so extremely helpful with my son. The information in this guys head is amazing. From talking to my kid about the loons, letting him learn to drive, baiting hooks, retying lines etc. We did catch fish later in the day. A little of everything. But, we went into areas I probably wouldn't have tried myself. He explained what we were doing and why we were doing it every step. Even explaining how certain pine trees repopulate. I didn't realize some of these trees pine cones only release the seed if a fire burns the pine cone and it opens up? But, to keep a 10 year old from being bored during slow fishing is not an easy thing to do. Anyway, we didn't catch huge numbers but we did catch quality fish. The food was spectacular from bison burgers to pasta. Breakfasts are outstanding. The dock guys and guides are amazing with kids. They spent a ton of time with my son. From fishing off the dock to catching snapping turtles with a net only. If we weren't doing something specific, my 10 year old would ask...........can I go to the dock? Cabins are nice, they are clean and as my father in law said..................what, they deliver ice to us daily? lol yep. Cooler was filled and the ice bucket for drinks waiting when we came in from fishing every afternoon. Happy Hour on the deck. It is hard to explain but this place just has a different feel to it. Maybe because it is a smaller lake and everything is easy to get to? Maybe it's the staff? But, it is just a fantastic place to spend time."

4073946,Carnhzkr,2015-07-24 16:06:00,964,"Thanks for the report, SOS. What you've described matches my understanding of what to expect from HLL - maybe not a numbers lake, but serious potential for trophies. Congratulations! 32.5"" is an amazing walleye, and to me, would be worth the trip all by itself. I'd want to be sure I had several clear pics so I could get a quality replica of a giant like that. My man cave is in great need of a 30+"" walleye.Maybe if I start saving my cans & bottles refund money, I can swing a trip to HLL in 2020."

4074506,adempsey,2015-07-24 22:20:00,963,Nice to read a report from Hawk Lake Lodge. I've been interested in this lodge since a fishing trip I took several years back and a group of guests wouldn't stop talking about how awesome it was. They were mostly talking about the quality of the lodge and not the fishing.Did you manage to fish any of the other lakes? Don't they have a bunch of lakes you can book to fish for the day?
4074794,SinOrSwim,2015-07-25 06:48:00,1528,"Carnhzkr, I have some pics but none of them look decent. They were on my phone taken by my 10 year old. But, when you have a 29 and 32 in teh boat at the same time, it gets a little hectic. I have a replica of a 30 I caught about 12 years ago so I wasn't going to do another anyway though.adempsey: We fished a couple other lakes last year and only one lake this year. I had my father in law with me this year and there was no way he was portaging. Some of the portages are really not that long. But, to get him over there and out of a boat and into a boat from shore is not a simple thing for him. So, we mainly fished the main lake. This lake is definitely not a numbers lake for Walleye. It is a trophy lake for walleye. It's not a guarantee but the percentages are a heck of a lot higher than other places I have gone. But, it IS a numbers lake for smallmouth. Not only numbers but big fish. I can't put it into words why it's such a great place. But, there is just a feel. The smaller lake, the atmosphere? I don't know what it is? It is a very pretty lake though. When you get down to some of the bays and the gigantic rock cliffs coming out of the water. Literally, if you forgot something one of their staff would offer to run to Kenora to get it. We needed to leave before checkout the next morning. So, I paid up the bill and the staff pulled my truck around by the cabin and loaded everything the night before. All we did was throw our suitcases in and we were off. If you need it or want it they will take care of it.Also, I was down on the dock and I left. My son was still there. I turned around to go say something and he was leaving. I heard my son say thanks for something. Not sure what? One of the guides that was down there said............hey buddy, you come down an hang out with me anytime!!! Nobody knew I heard that. But, it made my 10 year old feel like he was the most important person there. He didn't have to say it. It wasn't like he was saying it for my benefit or the owners. There wasn't anyone else around. If you are a numbers guy for walleye. Not your lake. I'd rather catch one 30"" fish than a bunch of 20"" fish though. I had nver fished smallies but that can be addicting. It is a lot of fun. Also, if you are a ""I want to take fish home and eat fish everyday"" person. Not your lake. It is catch and release only. Which, I personally like. My father in law...........not so much. He doesn't get that at all?"
