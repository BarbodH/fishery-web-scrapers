I downloaded and converted a set of data from the Canada mapping website. It identifies a LOT of the subsurface rock hazards that exist on Lac Seul. Between that, and the Bing Maps Aerial Overlay, which is VERY good aerial imagery for that region, you should be able to look over the lake areas pretty well.If anyone needs it, I can convert a section of waypoints to your depthfinder format if you want to put them into your depthfinder."
4028377,Carnhzkr,2015-07-07 12:08:00,964,Looks like we'll miss each other again. We arrive August 8th.
4072482,stjoeguy,2015-07-23 23:13:00,979,That Google Earth map is fantastic! Thank you!
4072810,Shotgun,2015-07-24 06:40:00,759,"Carnhzkr, we will be arriving on the 8th also staying at the main camp. Fishing out of a white Lund fisherman. If you see us stop and say hi. We can swap some rock finding stories. Safe travels"
4072898,SinOrSwim,2015-07-24 07:17:00,1528,"I can't open that map? We fished with a guide at Hawk Lake Lodge beginning of July. One of the best fishing experiences I've had. And, that was with a very slow day fishing. But, he was talking about how he uses google earth and google earth pro to scout lakes and locations he will be guiding. He was talking about how much detail you can see and how looking at what is on shore will typically translate into what is in the water as well. It was very interesting listening to him. And, a guy who takes his job seriously. Didn't have much experience in Ontario but the little things matter. Went and got himself a book on Ontario birds etc. So, as we are driving along and we see a family of loons he started talking to my son about the loons. I had no idea a loon can chase food up to 150feet deep?????"

I have the weather turned off and tried turning off other selections but no luck. any ideas??"
4073258,CamoHunter,2015-07-24 09:43:00,363,"Walleye Central wouldn't let me attach a .kml file, so I had to compress it into a .zip file. You will need to open the Lac Seul.zip file, and extract the .kml file using something like WinZip or 7-Zip or similar program.Then you'll have the Google Earth .kml file that you should be able to open in Google Earth. Or, if you want, I can just email you the .kml file direct.Quote: Originally Posted by rnnonmtWhen I open the file in google earth it is very clear until I get to an ""eye altitude"" of around 50,000 ft and then cloud layers come in and I lose the crisp imagery.

Then, make sure the ""Bing Maps Aerial Overlay"" box is checked, in the Lac Seul file you opened. When you zoom in, the aerial overlay has to load a bunch of 'tiles' of imagery. Basically, it is a bunch of imagery tiles that overlay on top of the google earth imagery. But the Bing Maps imagery is MUCH better in that Ontario region than Google Earth. You should see the tiles 'refreshing' as they load.Hope that helps."
4073314,Carnhzkr,2015-07-24 10:11:00,964,"You might see a black F150 pulling a red Lund whoosh by you heading north on I35. That'll be me. I'll wave as we go by. We'll mostly be fishing around Manitoba, Stony, Windigo Points and the various humps in that area. Leaving two weeks from today. See you there!"
4026018,Carnhzkr,2015-07-06 16:27:00,964,"Every report I've read on LS this year has reported great fishing, and mine will echo that. All-in-all, we had a great trip. We fished out off Fisherman's Cove for the first time and upon checkout, signed up for the same cabin for next year. That's the first time I've ever done that, so that says something. The day before we arrived, I was a bit apprehensive about the stinking Mayflies, after reading V-Bay Gord's post announcing the hatch was in full swing. I know some people say it's a great time to fish, but I hate those little buggers. I also see now why it can work to your favor. Upon Devon's (son of the owner and primary guide) recommendation, we headed to McKenzie and the Sand Banks. He was correct. Action on the big bank was very fast, although we didn't snag any picture worthy fish the first couple of days. I noticed the action was always much faster in the morning and slowed down after lunch (as V-Bay Gord predicted it might - ""get out early""). We did see a lot of Mayflies floating and the fish I cleaned each evening were stuffed full of those nasty critters (disgusting). Since it kept working for us, we went back to the sand banks and other spots in McKenzie everyday except one, when we hit Manitoba Point. We fished the south side of MP in the AM and only caught maybe 15 fish, but they were nearly all 23""+, with the largest at 28. Afternoon, we fished the north side and the action was much faster, but size a lot smaller. Other places where we had very good fishing included the sand bank on the east side of South Bay, and all along the bank to the east when you go through Hungry Narrows into South Inlet. We had good fishing all along that eastern bank from Hungry Narrows into the bay to the east.One highlight of the trip was Wednesday night, when they put on a hamburger & moose brat feed with all the fixins. We picked the right week to stay at FC, because it happened to fall on Dan's 60th birthday and he provided a keg of Coors Light for the occasion. Since it was a light week for the camp, being over Independence Day, I did my best to make up for the light attendance by doubling up on food and beer (you're welcome).One thing I learned on this trip was that the walleyes love plastics, probably due to the Mayfly hatch. My technique was to pull spinners with crawlers or minnows until we'd get a double or triple, then I'd spot-lock and one of my sons and I would switch to jigs and plastics (I set up drop-shot rigs with live bait for my wife and other son). They'd kill those plastics. That was a ball feeling the faint ""thunk"" as they'd inhale the head down deep. I could really tell they were feeding aggressively by the way they'd suck whatever we threw at them deep into their throat. It didn't seem to matter what type of plastic - Gulp or twisters or whatever. It all worked. My son was using some goofy bass stuff he'd had and never used before - big 'ol lizzards and gawdy looking stuff, and they'd nail 'em. I also noticed the average fish on plastics was larger vs. the spinner/live bait rigs.I don't count fish, but I'd estimate we'd boat 100 - 150 average for the four of us. Our largest was just over 28 and one right at that mark, and several in the 24 - 26 range.The only bad part of the trip was that I found the reef marked by the red buoy as you approach Poplar Narrows from the west, or actually, it found me. It's a bit confusing in that area, but I should have known better. Fortunately, due to my confusion, I backed off the throttle to get my bearings just before I made contact. I was hung high and dry and felt certain that my LU was gone, but it was still intact. My skeg took a beating, but it's still there and there's no leaking so I got lucky.As far as baits, generally two of us were using crawlers and two using minnows, and I never see much difference between the two. Some days it seems minnows are hotter and some days crawlers win, but on average, it's 50-50 in my boat. Aside from hitting the rock, one of my regrets is that I didn't explore more than I did. I know I'd pass 100 good spots on my way to McKenzie. It's just hard for me to opt for two in the bush when I already had a bird in the hand.I'll be back in four weeks, when I have Lac Seul Lodge's outpost on Sunlight reserved, and we'll be concentrating on the main body of LS. I'm bringing a buddy that loves to fish, but he's never been to Canada. He told me his goal is to catch a 20"" walleye. I have a hunch he'll reach that goal."
4026042,new hips,2015-07-06 16:40:00,498,Sounds like a great week....Thanks for posting
4026082,Carnhzkr,2015-07-06 16:52:00,964,"I forgot to add one thing. Bugs were a non-factor. I never applied bug spray once. That may have been a mistake, though, as the last night I was wearing shorts and talking with my neighbors and Saturday morning noticed about 20 bright red bumps on each leg. I think the no-seeums got me, but I don't think I got a single mosquito bite the whole week."
4026194,rnnonmt,2015-07-06 17:36:00,992,Thank for the great report. I was up the 2nd week of June to Lac Seul SE section and the mosquitos were almost non existent. The camp owner Alan said they had a freeze occur after the first batch of skeeters hatched and killed a lot of them. I will wish for that every year going forward! lol
4026378,MOfish,2015-07-06 18:35:00,39,"Sounds like a great trip. We leave for Onaway on the 23rd and can't wait. I can't recall where Poplar Narrows is located but I will be careful. As much fun as it is, my nerves are shot sometimes navigating around even with a handheld GPS. I'm the worrying type. Anyway, congrats on a great trip!"
4026434,Carnhzkr,2015-07-06 18:46:00,964,"If you go from Onaway to Manitoba point, you'll go through Poplar Narrows. When you approach the red buoy, stay WIDE to the left (north)."
4026514,MOfish,2015-07-06 19:25:00,39,Got it. It's on the end of Big Island.
4026562,Fishin Fun,2015-07-06 19:57:00,218,Thanks for the report. So looking forward to heading up to Gawleys during the first week of August and get back on Lac Seul. Can't wait!
4027241,dstar49,2015-07-07 06:33:00,33,Thanks for the report. Heading to Fishermans Cove on the 25th of july sounds like we should have a good trip!
4028257,Steve Ediger,2015-07-07 11:31:00,97,"Carnhzkr, What week you going to Sunlight? We will be @ Lac Seul Lodge 7-25 thru 7-31. Steve"
