4071786,Core,2015-07-23 16:21:00,81,"I used to guide at Waterbury Lake. The road from La Ronge to Wollaston is known to be brutal. I would make sure I had 2 spare tires for that road. Alot of big sharp chunks of shale. I assume you aren't towing a $50k boat up it....but if you are, bring a rock guard and rock tamers...and few spare tires for the trailer too! Also I don't think there is fuel between La Ronge and Southend - and I'm only assuming there is fuel at Southend. I haven't been up there for almost 15years. Other than that, I've heard good things about the lake. Never been there myself."
