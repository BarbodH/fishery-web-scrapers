4071954,Obabikon,2015-07-23 18:13:00,2370,"In my opinion, it all depends on if the owner was able to fill the time slot or not. If he DID fill it... then ethically, he should refund the deposit. Simply because he is out nothing. If he/she doesn't... then its kind of double dipping. (just my 2 pennies)"
4071970,rnnonmt,2015-07-23 18:22:00,992,Are you a politician too? Your comments wreak moral motivation.
4071994,Fisherman Ted,2015-07-23 18:26:00,461,"For those trips that tend to be expensive (or any trips for that matter) you should always consider travel insurance. It is pennies on the dollar and is worth every cent. Your son breaks a leg, wife gets sick or you fall and sprain your back. They will cover the full cost of the trip and then some. It is an absolute no brainer. In my deposit confirmation for my guests I give my fishermen a direct link to our trip insurance provider and highly stress to purchase the insurance just to be sure. Our provider has cut many checks to guests over the years, happily. Would be a shame to be out 15 grand when for $400 you would have been covered. -FT"
4072034,wingmann,2015-07-23 18:46:00,42,"Thank you for all of your opinions. I really appreciate the resort owner's opinion which is what I was looking for. Everyone is definitely right that we should have known the resort's deposit policy. Been going to Canada for over 30 years and this was the first time we cancelled a trip. In the past we have had one person drop due to job loss and the resort owner was great and applied the deposit toward the group bill. We gave them a few weeks notice so at least they didn't loose money on food for this. Someone brought up why are you bringing this up from a trip so long ago. Not looking for any type of satisfaction, just wondering what other people's viewpoints were. Another poster mentioned why didn't we apply the money toward a future trip if it was a good place? There were a couple of things we didn't like at the resort. Also, when you are close with a staff member, you find out some things that disappoint you about the owners. But just like anything, nobody is perfect. Basically, I thought returning $600 made more sense from a business standpoint, rather than risk losing possibly $15,000 in future revenue for a year. If they would have handled the situation differently, I would go back. Maybe a couple from the group wouldn't go but that's what happens when you try to set up a fishing trip. Anyway, thank you for your viewpoints. It did help me see another side of the table. Wingmann"
4072050,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-23 18:49:00,725,This year we had one of our group of four that had to drop out to tend to his wife who was sick. His $300 deposit was paid in December and he was willing to contribute that if someone could join late. As it turned out there were no takers and we just applied it to the other 3 guys experience with his blessing. Are we jerks for not forking up a hundred bucks apiece? I guess I would have expected to forfeit the deposit if it was me. We never thought about having him apply it to the next year and never dreamed that the outfitter should refund it.
4071322,Freytown,2015-07-23 12:22:00,770,That figures.
4071354,adempsey,2015-07-23 12:32:00,963,"I think it's reasonable to expect your deposit back if you provide sufficient time from your scheduled trip. However, it's your responsibility to know and understand their policies.Assuming your trip was at least a couple months out, the outfitter probably should have refunded your deposit. However, I wouldn't hold anything against them if they only put it against a future trip, because it's their policy and they do need to protect themselves."
4071410,MrD,2015-07-23 12:45:00,452,I think the OP shouldn't have assumed what the policy was. They should have asked and resort should have told them even if they didn't ask. Be curious if policy was stated in the resort brochure. At the very least I'm sure this post will have more people verifying their resort's cancellation policy.
4071434,SinOrSwim,2015-07-23 12:52:00,1528,"I'd make those guys that went to the fishing show and changed their minds refund my deposit. Sounds like he only sent in the deposit after being told that is where you were going. Wasn't his fault you changed your mind. lol And, if you had gone there for 6 years, why not just move it to the following year rather than getting angry and not going back?"
4071562,fsz,2015-07-23 14:16:00,144,"It would seem if the outfitter honored his stated policy, keeping the deposits was legal. It would also seem that since the cancellation was 7 days after the deposit it was sent in, and it was January, the outfitter maybe booked the space. If this is accurate, prolly not ethical to keep the deposit. Only the outfitter can know this I would have given the group an offer that would have probably satisfied them and given me something for my modest hassle of having to rebook- a 50% refund, and have the balance apply to another trip. Its almost never a bad idea to meet someone half way."
4071634,packpro,2015-07-23 15:19:00,695,"Once we send the check we understand it is non refundable. It is a commitment. With that said, we are an older group, and we have had family deaths, and a couple of bouts with Cancer come up that caused some of our members to have to cancel. Our operator has been wonderful. Some times we roll the deposit over, other times he applies it to the master bill and the rest of the group can make the non attendee whole. Just one of the many reasons we remain loyal."
4071674,Ogoki,2015-07-23 15:38:00,291,"I know a group that does a fly in , where there is a minimum of 4 required. The group organizer told me he collects the deposits from the group, usually 8 to 10 going . He sends the deposit for 4 . Prior to the trip he phones the outfitter letting them know his trip will have 4 , 6, 8 or 10. He said he had so much problem with guys having to cancell or not knowing the exact number for various reasons. He said they always have more than the 4 minimum. He said he starting doing that after some lost deposits. He said he has never had to cancell their week . That is a different slant but he always has his minimum and usually more . 99% of the time it is just my wife and I and in all my trips I only cancelled once , but we went three weeks later."
4071682,mickr,2015-07-23 15:42:00,74,"I don't have an issue with non refundable deposits at all. The lodge owner is running a business. He receives your cheque. Makes a reservation in his reservation system. Enters the money on his books. Deposits it in his bank. That all takes time and time is money. I get that circumstances change but a client's change in circumstances shouldn't impact the lodge owner's livelihood. I can see certain exceptions to that in certain situations, but by and large a deposit is non refundable."
4071698,BreezyPoint,2015-07-23 15:57:00,1581,"I planned a lot of trips with groups...I had so much trouble with people dropping out that I started charging two deposits - one for the lodge and one for the trip expenses. I let people know that if they dropped out, the money was non-refundable and went into the kitty for everyone else. After that I never had a problem. Wafflers never made the commitment and we never had extra money because someone dropped out. We had occasions when people wanted to join at the last minute (Wafflers) and we said no - you should have committed up front. If we backed down we would just be back into the same old problem.Frank"
4071818,Old Timer,2015-07-23 16:45:00,255,"Filling a slot for four or more can be a royal pain for somebody. What happens is the camp owner uses the trip organizer as the camp's travel agent to guarantee a minimum number of paying bodies. And the organizer gets all grief when things go wrong. For my friends who still do group trips where a minimum is required, the folks going have to pay in full at time of booking. Then their payment is forfeited if they cancel out. That goes a long way to remove the stress on the trip organizer.I've been the wagon master on many trips. But the effort took it's toll and I now go with one friend or family member. If others want to go too, I say great. Get a cabin and see you up there."
4070586,MrSimon,2015-07-23 08:01:00,922,"Nobody likes loosing money, but policy is policy. Last year we paid our deposit to Hearst Air for 6 guys. A while later one guy had to back out and we forfeited those couple hundred bucks for his deposit. It was a bummer, but we knew the policies and the risk going in. I just took a deep breathe, let it go, and enjoyed a fantastic trip with an A+ outfitter."
4070594,Freytown,2015-07-23 08:03:00,770,"An outfitter can't not make a living refunding ""non-refundable deposits"". He could end up with an empty cabin and a mere deposit for his efforts. Not a way to run a business. Just sayin'. FT"
4070642,LOW1,2015-07-23 08:29:00,2828,"How can a payment be both a ""deposit"" and ""refundable?"" If you expect the outfitter to commit space to you, you should expect to make a financial commitment to the outfitter. How would you feel if the outfitter called you up and cancelled you? As a gift the outfitter may wish to refund the deposit, but that should not be required or expected. Refusing to patronize an outfitter because he did not refund a deposit seems unreasonable to me, but that is your choice. Perhaps the outfitter does not mind avoiding making commitments to those who are not committed to him."
4070866,Fisherman Ted,2015-07-23 09:34:00,461,"This situation is one as a lodge owner that can cause anxiety and undue stress on us and our guests. It shouldn't.The best way to address this is to be crystal clear on the web-site and any correspondence between both parties. We have policies to protect us AND you. Your deposit ensures your favorite week at your lodge of choice. You have locked in a cabin that sometimes is reserved over a year in advance. That deposit ensures you are good to go.I know of few businesses that don't charge full price for their service sometimes at the time of booking that are completely non-refundable, certainly within a certain time period. Airlines, cruises, safaris etc. Honestly the risk is on the lodge owner. The closer we get to go time the more of that risk we assume.I had a guest show up with less people than they booked for. At the end of their trip per our policy we did not refund the one deposit and unfortunately our guest was quite upset, even though we had a clear policy, had communicated that in writing and we had just lost the entire trip for one guest with just a token deposit to show for it. I told them in a nice way that what would have happened if multiple people didn't show up, would I have to pay them a refund?? That logic didn't seem to hit home either. The end result is we lost the revenue (that can never be recovered) and I had a very unhappy guest as they did not understand that a deposit is a financial commitment.I am always upfront with my guests and of course will try to make all of them happy but as someone said once you start to make exceptions you start down a slippery road. At the end of the day this is a business. If all policies are clear and you are honest with your guests that goes a long way to creating a solid relationship."
4070994,MrSimon,2015-07-23 10:17:00,922,"I own a fishing cottage that I rent out by the week, and I've learned two things for sure:There are plenty of people out there who will try and screw you anyway they can, and then complain like crazy when they don't get their way. They have no problem telling blatant lies either.As an owner, you have to protect yourself by effectively communicating your policies and sticking by them. If you give an inch, they will ask for a mile. Obviously not ever renter is a problem. In fact, most I've had are great. But maybe 1 in 10 is a nightmare. It's that 10% that I have to protect myself against. Unfortunately that will impact the 90% that are great, but it is what it is."
4071042,Guest,2015-07-23 10:33:00,0,"Well I guess if they have a non-refund policy, no need to let them know you aren't coming up. Let them try to book the cabin when you dont show up. Now if they said if they book the cabin they would refund your money that would be different."
4071090,Fisherman Ted,2015-07-23 10:38:00,461,"huh? That's the attitude that would ensure an outfitter will not refund your money at all. If you can't make your trip let them know and should they be able to re-book the cabin they would be much more agreeable to refunding the money, policy or not. Common courtesy would say let us know if you aren't coming. Staffing, pilots, food etc are all impacted. A no show causes other issues."
4071098,BreezyPoint,2015-07-23 10:39:00,1581,Very rude behavior. You are the kind of guy that drives up the cost of everything for the rest of us. As it is canceling a booking has a large potential opportunity cost for resort owners if they are unable to rebook the cabin. Your attitude makes this cost bigger for them.Frank
4071146,bigwalleye1,2015-07-23 11:01:00,2632,"If you're not going to call and cancel, you may be liable for the entire bill."

4069546,wingmann,2015-07-22 18:02:00,42,"About 5 years ago, our group had an issue with a deposit check that was sent to a resort in Canada where they refused to return / refund it within 7 days of receiving it. They offered to apply it toward a future trip. Here is the story: We had been going to this resort in Canada for about 6 years. It is a quality camp with great service, food and equipment. We usually have a group of around 10 people. It was late January and we gave a verbal commitment to this camp for our group of 10. One of our group sent in a check for the deposit for 3 people. In the meantime, some of us went to a fishing show and wanted to go to this other resort. We called the person who sent in the check and discussed it with him and he agreed to go to the new place. He contacted the resort owner who refused to refund or send the check back to him. I don't remember what the resort's policy was in regards to deposit money. But thought that since the cancellation was done within 7 days of receiving the check and in January that should have been reasonable to request the money back. Your thoughts? Wingmann"
4069626,stjoeguy,2015-07-22 18:46:00,979,"Resorts have different refund policies, but not returning the deposit when cancelled within 7 days in January seems like bad business to me. They gave up the possibility of ever having your group of 10 (and whoever else you mention it to) in exchange for 3 deposits."
4069634,BreezyPoint,2015-07-22 18:48:00,1581,"I don't know of many places that refund deposits. The most common I see is being able to apply to a trip within one year. If this was boat showtime they could easily have missed a booking even in those seven days. I know some places that don't refund deposits, period. It pays to ask for the deposit policy before sending it in.Frank"
4069658,Skywagon,2015-07-22 18:58:00,1106,It would seem to me that giving a deposit is like giving your word....
4069690,rnnonmt,2015-07-22 19:08:00,992,Kind of confusing.... what was the date of your trip and when did you ask for the deposit back? IMO that is more important in determining an answer than asking for your deposit back 7 days after the camp received it. For example if you were asking for your deposit back months before your trip at least the camp has a better opportunity of filling the vacancy rather than only having a few weeks. What was the camp's policy? That is the real question at hand.
4069770,wingmann,2015-07-22 19:53:00,42,"I would have to guess that their refund policy was no refunds since that is the way they handled it. I really don't know. I agree that when you make a verbal commitment that you are giving your word so we did feel bad about that. We were disappointed that the owners refused to refund the money. Our trip dates were about 6 months away. Due to the way they handled this situation, we have gone to another resort and will not return. The main reason we originally chose to go to another resort was we had a chance to fish with a guide we used to fish with in the 1980s. We hadn't had a chance to fish with him in over twenty years. Wingmann"
4070242,octanehi5,2015-07-23 05:50:00,1104,"The key is to know your outfitters policies,The one I have used for yrs. Deposits are not refundable,but can be transfured to a differant yr. I tell this to everyone that is putting down a deposit,if you back out of a trip you need to find your replacement. you have to remember that it was your group that decided to change outfitters after the deposit was made. Your also doing business in another country, its not the USA. I tell you through experiance, I have had guys back out the day before a flyin,and want their money back. Ya Right. Most outfitters have 5 months of being able to put fishermen in their camps, time and space is very valuable to them. My suggestion to you is get all your guys on the same page,as far as were you are going,the outfitters policies, then collect everyones deposit and book the trip.Keep in mind ,Money Talks and Bulls__t Walks"
4070306,v-bay gord,2015-07-23 06:19:00,3168,"Seems reasonable to me that your deposit wasn't refundable, which most likely was the camp policy. The fact that you could transfer it to another time was also reasonable. Seems like since you liked the camp and service it would have been wiser to ask about using the deposit the following year perhaps........ Not sure what getting upset over it is accomplishing..... You probably should have asked about the deposit policy before you pulled the pin on the trip."
4070322,Mike Borger,2015-07-23 06:29:00,1554,"I deal directly with a ton of outfitters and most have the same policy: deposits are non refundable but can be used towards a future trip.Seems reasonable to me.That said considering the time of year and the circumstances, that outfitter likely erred by not refunding the deposit."
4070570,bigwalleye1,2015-07-23 07:59:00,2632,"I dunno, Mike. Erred, I don't think so. He has a policy (we assume) and he's sticking to it. Once you make an exception, it opens the door. Did the outfitter do himself a dis-service? I'd go that far with you. He lost a lot of future potential business. That said, to the OP, it was 5 years ago. What benefit in bringing it up now?"
