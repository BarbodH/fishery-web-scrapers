4072794,Obabikon,2015-07-24 06:32:00,2370,"From an owner's side... I always reserve the right to move guests. We don't require Saturday-Saturday rentals, so scheduling can get a little tricky at times. Guests can make requests, and I do everything I can.... however, I can't turn down a group of 12, just because the group of 8 likes the ""BIG"" cabin. If I don't end up finding a group of 12, I'm happy to let them stay there. That said... I'm always up front with those things. I also apply deposits to other's trips. So... if you were a group of 6, and all had deposits in... but only 4 showed up. The four guys that came split the other 2 guys' deposits. If they want to pay them back... that's fine. But, I don't keep the money if the GROUP comes. Typically... I keep deposits for future trips, but if it is a medical issue... I refund it. If it had only been a week in January... I would refund it, as I know I would fill the week in the spring."
4072890,v-bay gord,2015-07-24 07:14:00,3168,"From my list of reasons that I might refund a deposit, deciding to go to another lodge isn't one of them....."
4073034,MrD,2015-07-24 07:53:00,452,"The places I stay have a schedule. Amount of deposit returned depends on how much advance warning is given. The days and amounts are spelled out. Also sometimes a small charge for booking fees even if cancelled next day. As stated earlier, no bumping."
4074202,wingmann,2015-07-24 18:52:00,42,Our group have been moved from cabins numerous times over the years. The resort owners we frequent know we are pretty easy going and don't have a problem with this. But the cabins we were moved to were fairly similar to the one we moved out of. Wingmann
4070914,Thompmd,2015-07-23 09:49:00,320,"I read the deposit thread and it got me to thinking, I saw a Camp(I believe on LS if I remember but it wasn't important) that in their policy said that the Camp reserved the right to change the Cabin a customer rented without notice. What are your thought(s) on this?My 2-cents is that if I book a cabin for the week and have paid my deposit,etc and then show up and the owner say we have changed my cabin I would likely be upset. I think that before they decided to change our cabin and give it to someone else at the very minimum they should contact me and ask if that is ok. If we are ok then move us, if we are opposed then IMO the cabin is mine.My 2-cents on the original thread is that(we own several Rental houses so we do run across this on rare occasions) if you book something, its yours. Personally if it were within 7-days as the op said I would have refunded the money as it likely caused no financial hardship BUT I would not argue that when is ok...7-days.....30-days.....1st time guest or long time guest. Common sense goes a long way and both have to realize that they have to have some skin in the game."
4070986,MrSimon,2015-07-23 10:04:00,922,"It all depends. If you get bumped out of the green cabin and into the red one, which is identical in all other ways ... then it doesn't matter. But at the end of the day, policy is policy. It's their camp and they can run it however they want."
4071114,roscoe33,2015-07-23 10:45:00,653,"The resort I go to will move you to a different cabin if needed. Sometimes your party of 5, grows to a party of 6, or 7. And another group shrinks from 9 to 5. Or a group books and one of them has a disability. So they swap your cabins, which gives both groups ample space, without wasting capacity, or the need to charge a minimum for the under utilized larger cabin. I'm sure if I NEEDED a specific cabin for some reason, they would accommodate. Also, at this resort, you book for specific dates (week block) until they are at capacity. BUT, they don't want your deposit money until January of that year."
4071362,Old Timer,2015-07-23 12:35:00,255,"My program is as follows: When I book a cabin, that's my reserved cabin unless they call or email and ask me to change. I'm generally not bothered by a camp's deposit policy as long as it is stated beforehand. I won't go to a camp that charges for a minimum number of people in a cabin or a minimum length of stay. And I won't go to a Canadian camp that charges in U.S. funds.There are fewer and fewer of these camps around. But they're out there and many have good facilities and offer great fishing. The tricky part of all my fishing trips is finding a camp with the right criteria on good water and then finding the cooperative fish. When I do my homework the catching takes little or no skill at all."
4071370,adempsey,2015-07-23 12:38:00,963,"I'd be totally fine with it if it was a party size issue or something similar. If it was because some other groups were preferred customers, I never know how to feel about that (assuming I was promised a specific cabin or boat or whatever).It's great if YOU are the returning guest that's been going for 25 years, but not so much if it's your first time and are now a second class citizen.I would NEVER let anything like that ruin my trip though, but it might impact my decision to go back. Which of course, might be YES because you want to be that returning customer or NO because it made you feel small, lol. Can't win!"
4071450,MrD,2015-07-23 12:56:00,452,"If I had been there before and requested a certain cabin, yes I would be very ticked if they bumped me. I had reasons for requesting certain cabin; comfort of beds, view, parking, etc. If bumping was stated in resort brochure, not a problem cause i wouldn't be staying there to start with."

4072530,alberta bum,2015-07-24 03:43:00,312,"Had that happen last year.. I booked and paid for a waterfront cabin. I showed up on the Saturday and was told we had too change your cabin( we are going to do deck repairs this week). They stuck us in a cabin,, that had an excellent view of the parking lot and fish cleaning shack.. I was not happy.. Launched my boat and saw there was a private boat at the dock in front of the cabin I was supposed to be staying in.. I saw him go out the next morning,, so I followed him and went and asked him some questions... He showed up mid week looking for a cabin until the Sunday,, they rented it too him.. He left a couple hours later,, surprise surmise that cabin became available that afternoon, since they were going too put off deck repairs for a week... Don't even ask about the fridge in the cabin they had stuck us in originally.. The fridge that wouldn't get cold.. I went up to the lodge owners deck where they were all sitting drinking the left behind beers from the previous weeks guests,, and asked what could be done about the fridge.. And the wife of the owner asked me if I had plugged the fridge into the wall the right way???? I'm not kidding..."
4072562,btyreprich,2015-07-24 04:11:00,1067,"When the lady asked if you had plugged the refrigerator in the ""right way"", I would have asked for her to show us the correct method to do this. Yikes is all I'd have to say. Hope your not thinking of going back to this camp after the way they treated you. I sure wouldn't."
4072762,MrSimon,2015-07-24 06:20:00,922,"I pulled into camp once only to find that the owners were literally packing up their truck and heading to Ohio for the week. They left a seasonal guest in charge who was nice, but didn't know much and wasn't around much. Also, the owner or one of his sons was supposed to take our group on a guided trip to one of the bush lakes. That didn't happen. I was pretty upset and felt like I got cheated. Then I found out that the owner's mother had passed away suddenly and they were going to the funeral. Obviously I felt like an idiot. I learned that there are always two sides to every story. Having a good attitude, being flexible, and treating people with consideration and respect is a WHOLE LOT better than getting pissy about little inconveniences."
