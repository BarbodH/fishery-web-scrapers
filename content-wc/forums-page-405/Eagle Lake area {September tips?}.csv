I would think with the hot Summer we just had the water temps will still be quite warm...We will be mostly walleye, pike and bass fishing with a few hours here and there casting casting for musky. We also might try driving to an off-the-beaten-path lake{s} as well. We have a 14' boat for that.If somebody would chime in with some tips on how to approach Eagle and a drive to lake I would appreciate it.fwiw, we will be entering the lake at the mouth of Eagle River.pm's are fine.Thanks."
1482496,oxdrift2,2012-09-03 11:54:00,37,"Walleye will still be deep, 15-20 foot around humps, rock piles and reef's. Try tail kooking minnows on lindy rigs. Small Mouth should be active on minnows, Jigs, cranks. Northern hit just about anything crank baits, spoons , top water and live bait. It can be windy, what we no is if it is try to duck behind islands or close to shore. Your resort should give you a hot spot map of eagle. If the don't have that option pick one up before you go. The tips section is good. This year I am going to try drop shotting and slip bobbers. I have never tried this but have heard it works, especially if it is windy. Good luck, have fun, stay safe!"
1482550,SinOrSwim,2012-09-03 15:55:00,1528,why tail hook if you are using a rig? Shouldn't it be lip hooked? thanks
1482896,Fonzie,2012-09-04 16:21:00,85,"Yep,Dropshotting is one of the techniques I want to try.I also like snelling two to hooks together about 12"" apart. Put a couple of large Gulp minnows on the rig and it really mimics two baitfish fleeing together...."
