1481130,MorganMan,2012-08-30 07:03:00,341,"I know that ""Outdoors Again"" is a bait/tackle shop in Baudette does sell flats of crawlers for transport to Canada. They are right next to Alice's Family Restaurant which is the old ""Ranch House"". On the Rainy side, I have no idea. Have a great trip, only a week or so to go for us!"
