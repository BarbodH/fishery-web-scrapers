1479958,Mike Kansas,2012-08-27 07:50:00,1463,"Have caught many Blue Walleye on Lac Seul. About 4 years ago we had two days that we hit the Blue Walleye in a unbelivable manner. We caught 400 or more of them at the north end of Canoe Bay in front of Poplar Island. They were all nice fish (21"" to24"") fish. It was the biggest school of Blues that any of us had ever seen and they stayed in that area for at least the two days we caught them. Have had other times when we catch a couple a day but never anything like we had those two days in front of Poplar. The only other place we have caught any was in Manitoba on a fly in to a resort called Amphibian. It is on the Pigeon River and we caught a dozen or so Blues one day close to a waterfall.

1480031,Guest,2012-08-27 10:41:00,0,Rumor has it that you catch the blue walleyes after the bears have eaten their fill of blue-berries and their droppings spill into the the water and the walleyes in that area get tainted by the color if they stay long enough. Sorta like a tattoo :-)
1480097,Mike Kansas,2012-08-27 13:02:00,1463,That is as good as any explanation that I have heard. Mike Kansas
1480432,stjoeguy,2012-08-28 08:08:00,979,"Here's my blue walleye from this year's trip to Lake St. Joseph. I heard that the blue walleye is an albino lacking the normal gold pigment, but the bear/blueberry theory is more fun."
1480517,joeman79,2012-08-28 12:49:00,417,If you ever want to go somewhere and CONSISTANTLY catch Blue Walleyes Richardson Lake is the place to go. We caught hundreds of them when we were there. They taste the same to no Blueberry taste at all. Northern Wilderness Outfitters
1480899,Mudpuippy,2012-08-29 12:36:00,23,"Blues in Marchington lake and tribtaries. The color is also prevelant in Essox lucius on some lakes.This color variation has a long and stoeried past. The first few specimins were dismissed as they were caught by the Blue Angles. Roy Orbison and Linda Ronstadt were also catching the blue walleyes on Blue Bayou some years ago. Fats Domino fished for them after weekend concerts and usually fished on ""Blue Monday"". Levi Strauss and Co. also developed thier famous Blue Jeans after a shore lunch of Blue walleye. Some recent trophy catches were reported by the Moody Blues Band. Even Paul Bunyan was a fan of the blue walleye and named his pet ""Babe the blue Ox"". More recently home delivery of Blue Walleye fillets has been made possible by ""Jet Blue"". (Had fun with that one)"
1479628,Guest,2012-08-26 10:48:00,0,I caught a blue walleye on sowdin lake near Ignace last week.
1479655,unclepaully,2012-08-26 12:00:00,112,"I know this original post is quite old but I'll add to it. I caught this eye this past March near the Chapleau game preserve. I don't know if it is considered a blue or not? In total we caught & released about 30 eyes and kept a few for dinner/bring back home & this was the only one that displayed these characteristics. Also the ""blue"" on this fish would rub off in the snow or on our hands."
1479665,octanehi5,2012-08-26 12:31:00,1104,"You will know right away if you caught a blue walleye, their color is differant, We have caught them on the gouin res in northern Quebec"

1479696,Larry Mac,2012-08-26 14:14:00,530,Here is what my son caught and released a few years back on a remote Ontario portage lake. I am not a fish biologist but I do know it was blue and it was a walleye LOL. Have a great yearThank you Larry Mac
1479815,nwont,2012-08-26 18:45:00,16,"I don't know if there are any lakes around Nakina that do not have blue walleye. Some are more obvious than others, pure blue would be rare, but different amounts of blue in the fins and slime is allways there. Really noticable in the winter when you lay them in the snow they turn the snow blue."

510130,Guest,2000-10-26 11:13:00,0,I am working on a Blue Walleye distribution project and would greatly appreciate your help. If you have caught a Blue Walleye in or around Ontario please let me know which lake you caught it in and what major city it is near. Thank you.

510134,Ron,2000-10-31 06:26:00,387,Two years ago we got two blue walleyes in a small lakenorthwest of Vermilion Bay off of Eagle Lake. Prettiestfish I have ever seen.
510135,Guest,2000-11-04 01:26:00,0,Are they still offering $500 for pictures of Blue Walleyes?
510136,scoot,2000-11-04 06:46:00,12,Our group caught a blue walleye in the Cabonga Reservoir in Quebec in 1997. The reservoir is in La Verendrye Reserve which is northwest of Maniwaki and east of Vald'or Que.
510137,Guest,2000-11-04 14:43:00,0,I caught some walleye while ice fishing a few years ago with quite a blueish color to them.Seem to be a whole school of them at the time. This was on the bay of quinte in southern Ontario near Belleville Ontario.
510138,Guest,2000-11-15 22:26:00,0,"Thank you to those of you who replied with usefull information. It has been a help, but we would still like more information on Blue Walleye. We would like to have any pictures or information on where Blue Walleye were found and when. I am working with a research group at the University of Wisconsin-Washington County. There is a new web page that we are creating specifically for Blue Walleye. It is under construction but we would appreciate it if you would check it out at www.washington.uwc.edu/walleye.Thank you.P.S. The $500 reward is for a differant kind of blue walleye originaly from Lake Erie, a kind of walleye that is thought to be extinct. We are not offering any reward but information would greatly help our research."
510139,Guest,2000-11-27 13:19:00,0,"Hundreds of blues are caught in Lake Kipawa (Kipawa, Quebec and Laniel, Quebec). This lake is not far from the Ontario border. It seems that the the percentage of blues in a given size range goes up as the size goes up (blues tend to be larger).I have a hunch that many anglers do not know what a blue walleye is, as the shading can be subtle and almost indistinguishable in low light conditions. Also, the coloration is not always obvious in a normal picture. I'll see if we have any pix where the coloration is obvious."
