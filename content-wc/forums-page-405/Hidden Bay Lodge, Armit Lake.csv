I would like to say it is a top notch operation. Arrived the afternoon the night before our fly-in and stayed in one of there cabins, at no extra expense. Flew out promptly the next morning at 6:30 a.m. and were on the lake at 7. Fished 5 days and caught 795 walleye and 30 or 40 northern pike. Biggest walleye 4 pounds 10 ounces and biggest northern 18 pounds 45 inches! Caught a lot of walleye 18 to 22 inches. Everything at the cabin ran flawlessly and Hidden bay provide more food than a small army could eat. Cabin was nothing special but what is expected out in the middle of no where and the satellite phone and internet are a plus. The only 2 complaints i have about Hidden bay are the nets provide are horrible and rubber nets would be a great upgrade and the bed are not very comfortable and are due for replacement. I can't say enough good things about Shaggy (our pilot) and Bruce. Operation is run very well. We will be back!"
