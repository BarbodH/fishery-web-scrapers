Have had pretty good luck with the walleye and its really beautiful up there. I hope that all this hot weather we've been having doesn't shut down the fishing too much. Any recent reports on Wolfe would be helpful. You asked about Sand Lake, which is right next to Wolfe. It's a small lake and I've never seen anyone fishing on it."

1482054,Guest,2012-09-02 07:06:00,0,"Very little is ever reported on the Southern Ontario walleye fishing oportunities. The St. Lawrence River and the Bay of Quinte certainly hold many walleye. Years ago, I was introduced to a spot on the St. Lawrence by a fishing buddy who is no longer with us. I still occasionally point out this spot to my fishin buddies as we pass over the Thousand Island Bridge. The spot is just visible as you cross the Canadien side. Tom was my buddies name, and just after dusk we tied up to a dock where this particular channel ran with a good bit of current. Tom used a deep diving jr. thunderstick in a crawfish color and proceeded to limit out on walleyes between 8 and 13 pounds. The limit then was six fish=2 in the boat=12. I was the net man and I can still see those submarines coming into the boatside lantern that we had positioned. Giant walleyes that are fished like that soon disapear as did those. Today, if I catch a large one, it goes back in after a photo. Anyone who wants to give the Westport area a try for walleye should give Wolfe Lake a try. My freinds and I have fished it for many years. It can't compete with the giant northern Ontario Lakes because of its size and level of activity, but in my opinion it has the physical properties of the best of walleye lakes. Clear water, many shoals, great forage base. Will be going up in a couple of weeks. Good fishing to all."
