1480714,5 of Diamonds,2012-08-29 04:03:00,151,Haven't heard this before?? Been fishing Lac Evans since early '90's. You've got no fears w/ this outfitter unless you don't agree w/ his conservation practices.
1480719,vteye,2012-08-29 04:31:00,812,"I don't keep trophy pike for camp food. Below is right off the brochure.

Inc does not assume any responsibility for the actions, oversights, delays, loss of luggage or negligence on the part of (2 associated business partners). I don't want to work with an outfitter who acts strictly as an intermediary in a sub Arctic region of Canada. ."
1480991,5 of Diamonds,2012-08-29 16:38:00,151,"Hmmm...OK....Good Luck and great fishing wherever you decide to go. Personally, I feel it's some of the best Trophy Class Pike fishing in North America. If everything goes as planned, I'll have a new IGFA line class World Record next season there. Stay tuned."
