Somewhat surprised that ours a nd one other cabin was in use during the week. Perhaps a little pricey, but the fishing was great. Young couple from BC attended to any details promply and friendly. Chris is a very accomplished musky man and as I have chased the critters for 44 years, it was to compare notes on Wisconsin/Ontario fish.We did not spend alot of time on Walleyes, rather focused on big northerns and muskies. My partner for the trip and I are both 68 years so stamina is not what it used to be. We boated plenty of big northerns, the largest was 41"", but lots of 38-39s-40s. Really fun.Chris put us on many good musky spots and we boated a 47"" fish the first night. Partner Tom had never caught a musky so a severe dose of musky fever set in. He managed to get three on but all got off for a varity of reasons. I saw at least two over 50"" and sveral in the high 40s. The last evening I had a Lac Seul monter miss my bucktail side ways in a heavy wind......I'm still thinking about that fish.A note on Chris the fishing guru in camp. Ifn you go listen to him very carefully, he gives you first hand info and puts you on big fish he has seen. A large tip is in order for him. Nice guy and a true musky fanatic.For details send me a private e-mail"
