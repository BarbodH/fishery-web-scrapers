1480184,Pikehunters,2012-08-27 17:26:00,100,"Just want to pass along some info. Crossing back into the USA on Saturday the MNR pulled us over for inspection. Have your fishing & or hunting license with your ID ready. I crossed the peace bridge but was informed they set up at all crossings. It will make your crossing faster if all is ready to go & not searching for ID's or licenses. Make sure all fish are packaged as required. I will also pass along the experience was very profesionally executed, no problems, no rudness they are just protecting there resource!!"
1480204,bluegussler,2012-08-27 17:59:00,124,"while crossing back @ pigeon river ithe US customs asked if we had fish. were told to get in line while the Minnesota DNR inspected our fish ,but also asked for a license. First of all why does Minn care how many Canadian fish I bring back and secondly at that point my Canadian fishing license had expired so what if I canned it in the garbage?This all happened on the US side of border"
1480217,northernbite,2012-08-27 18:38:00,1186,When I crossed back in June at the Peace bridge the federal US warden and 2 from Canadian Ministry checked us. They were on the U.S. side. They where very good and friendly but after they done their job. Crossed in July also around the 20th and nobody there.Paul

This could be a blitz for the end of the summer. Just a word to the wise."
1480480,Pikehunters,2012-08-28 10:44:00,100,Not sure but if your transporting fish in Ontario I would make sure that my license was with me expired or not. Our inspection was just passed the duty free store but still in Canada.
