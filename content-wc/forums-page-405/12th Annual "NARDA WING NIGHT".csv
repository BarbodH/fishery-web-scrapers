1482237,Bobbajig,2012-09-02 16:33:00,24,I wish we had booked our trip for 2 weeks later! Your wing night sounds like a great way to start a trip on Eagle. I can tell from the posts from Oxdrift that he is really getting excited about going. Tell Ernie I said hi I don't know if he will remember me but I will bet he would remember my ex wife who could speak German with him we went up there from 1996 until 1998
1482256,oxdrift2,2012-09-02 18:02:00,37,I'll be there....wait I'm always there!!
1482266,NARDA 1,2012-09-02 18:56:00,636,I'm sure he will remember you and I will be sure to tell him you said hi. And yes you should have come up 2 weeks later!!!!
1482313,JayM5209,2012-09-02 21:12:00,1050,Dang it. . . . I don't get to that neck of the woods until six days later. Any chance you have delivery service on take out orders?Have a great week in God's garden. Don't go flying through Vermilion Bay on plane throwing a big enough wake to swamp V-Bay Gord's docks!!
