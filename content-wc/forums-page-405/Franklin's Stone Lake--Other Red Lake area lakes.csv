Does anyone know anything about the lodge or the lake? Can you run a boat through to Stone Lake from Gullrock? I also know some of the lodges on Gullrock chain have boat caches on other lakes. We've always had such good fishing we haven't chose to use them. Are there any other lakes that we should consider fishing for a day for either muskies (not in chain) or for pike/walleye that is better than the chain?"
570555,Guest,2008-01-06 21:53:00,0,"The camp is fairly old and not well maintained compared to other camps in the area. It is up for sale so why not drive in and take a look. As for access to the lake, you can't take your boat in from gullrock. But I'm sure there must be some way into it. Musky fishing is available on Flat Lake and Russett Lake in the Madsen area west of the town of Red Lake."

"""""""""""""""" Sorry for a bit off topic, but what's the landing like for them lakes, always get them mixed up. The first lake off the main road had a landing, but they had construction going on when we last were there and it was so dug up from that you couldn't get in. Nice sized walleyes in the back lake, biggest musky was about 48"" just off the island back there. Not sure if the new 18' boat will get back there now though, used a 16' model and some years it was tough. Always had good luck at Red Lake, you can hit several other good lakes from there, including Gullrock if ya want. Al"
570571,Guest,2008-01-07 17:15:00,0,"tackleman--Thanks for the info. I appreciate it. Their site didn't tell me much. Didn't mention much about Stone Lake. Talked about ATVing to other lakes, but didn't say if you had to bring your own ATVs or if they had rentals and didn't say if they had boats on the lakes you ATVed to or if you had to shore fish. As I said, I'm happy staying on Gullrock, but mid-winter curiosity has to keep me thinking of something. allenw--Not off topic at all. I also asked about other lakes in the area as one of these years I might actually go chase some muskies or just see some new water while fishing walleye and/or northerns."
570572,Guest,2008-01-07 17:20:00,0,"""Nice sized walleyes in the back lake, biggest musky was about 48"" just off the island back there."" Good to know. I had been told that the muskies have a slow growth rate and didn't get that large. I believed the slow growing bit, but I found it a bit hard to believe that there wouldn't be some fair sized ones given the food base and the size that northerns can grow to in that area. I might have to pack the big box and a couple more poles although I hate to pass up a day of fantastic walleye fishing."
570575,AllenW,2008-01-07 20:01:00,11482,"I wouldn't expect Muskies that size on a regular basis, that was the biggest one caught in about 25+ years of fishing those two lakes, we tried to hit them a day or two each time we came up there. Fair amount of 15-20 pounders if the locals haven't killed them off by now. To get to the back lake you need to go though a small creek, 16' boat worked fine but if the waters low you may have to work at it a bit. Back lake has a island that sometimes sticks up and sometimes not, its that close to the water line, sneak up on it and fan cast the area. There's also a rock pile in the front lake, I think its off to the left a ways from the launch if I remember right, comes up to about 2 to 4 foot deep and drops off nicely, nice place to try, had quite a few follows and caught a few there and in the little bay the launch is in. Lakes aren't real big and I think it wouldn't take to much to fish the muskies out, we always C&R in them lakes, whether it walleyes or muskies. btw, we've picked up muskies in 30+ feet of water trying for walleyes using jigs and minnows. Have fun, hope ya get back to them at least once. Also going out of red lake on the nungessor (sp?) road you can run into the chukuni river and fish from shore, right time of the year that river is excellent to fish, and ya don't need a boat, great for them really bad weather days.

He finally pissed me off enough when he let someone else have our reserved cabin and also let them use our reserved boat in the middle of the week. That year I had a 12 year old boy with me because his father had died and promised to take him fishing (on this same trip). When the kid caught a trophy 20# pike and wanted to have it mounted, (he felt as if his dad helped him catch it) Franklin raked us over the coals in front of everybody for keeping it. That was it. We never went back. However, the lakes around there were very good for fishing. If you always do what you've always done,You'll always be whom you've always been.
