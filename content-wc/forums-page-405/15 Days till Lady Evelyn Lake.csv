1477903,phitans,2012-08-22 09:17:00,21,"No,second time. We went there in July last year and did well. We wanted to see how it is in early fall. Probably going to be much cooler than in July. I'm sure the walleyes will be in different locations too."

1480259,wpoplar,2012-08-27 20:01:00,2,"I will be with a group of 4 at Lady Evelyn- Ellen Island Camp- 15 - 22 Sept. This will be a new experience for us - the last 18 years we have fished Georgian Bay out of Diamond Key Lodge at the mouth of the Key River. When you fish the same area for so long you learn all the hotspots and it's hard to leave all that knowledge behind and start over again. The new owner turned Diamond Keyinto a family compound. On Georgian Bay we fished mainly for Northern Pike, occasionally for smallmouth, and seldom targeted walleye -we all live near Lake Erie and fish for walleye all summer. We have heard a lot of good things about Lady Evelyn and are anxious to get started. If I see a boat from Island 10 I will give you a wave."
