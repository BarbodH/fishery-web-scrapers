1480797,SinOrSwim,2012-08-29 09:15:00,1528,That is great information!! thank you. We have only ever stopped in places that had a Beer Store so hours were horrible. Very good to know.
1481046,pikeman14,2012-08-29 19:56:00,144,Is the reddens store a part of the reddens campsite and lodge?
1481047,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-08-29 20:03:00,84,Yes it is the same. We buy our food at Daslegs on Nestor Falls. They have everything we want. Reddens is much smaller.
1480304,pikeman14,2012-08-27 21:15:00,144,"Does anyone know of a grocery store near minaki, kenora, or fort frances that is open 24 hours?We will be crossing the border around 6 am and will need to pick up a few items (potatoes, beer etc) on our way to Minaki. It looks like Safeway opens up at 7, but maybe someone here knows of a 24 hour store. Thankspikeman14"
1480313,SinOrSwim,2012-08-27 21:25:00,1528,You are going to have a tough time with beer. I don't think they sell anything unless it's a liquor store or what they call the BEER store. We just take everthing over the border with us and pay the tax for that very reason. You just never know when/if travel plans change.
1480314,Guest,2012-08-27 21:29:00,0,Might as well plan for breakfast in kenora because as far as i know your not going to be buying beer before 11:00 am in the province of ont i might be wrong but thats the way it is in sask and manitoba
1480319,pikeman14,2012-08-27 21:38:00,144,"ouch....we are trying to avoid any extra attention at the border, since one member has a 9 yr old dui. We just figured on buying locally and saving ourselves the border headache. Ill try to talk to the lodge owner and see if they could pick up a few things before our flight. Thanks again"

1480387,camp chef,2012-08-28 07:02:00,915,"It looks like Dalseg's in Nestor Falls is open at 7:30. they would have everything you would need. Google Dalsegs Nestor Falls,they have a website ."
1480415,LOW1,2012-08-28 07:36:00,2828,"2x on Mr Chef's idea re Dalseg's. They open (and start selling booze) at 7:30. They will have everything that you need re groceries. Nestor Falls is close to 90 minutes from the border. If you are real early there is a restaurant next door or you could try the Log Cabin restaurant on the other side of the highway.It's about 2.5 hours from the border to Kenora, but I'd get what you need in Nestor Falls and take the bypass around Kenora."
1480457,Fisherman Ted,2012-08-28 09:32:00,461,"If you're not crossing until 6 AM you won't be in Kenora until 8:30, 8 AM at the earliest. At that point all grocery stores (Safeway, Walmart, Wholesale Club etc.) should be up and running. The only issue is booze. LCBOs don't open up here until 10. The Beer store does open at 9:30 on Saturday however."
1480590,pikeman14,2012-08-28 17:19:00,144,Thanks for the great info! All of these tips will help decide when to leave from home.
1480663,stillangling,2012-08-28 20:41:00,149,"Hey Gents, for those of you that don't know it, Reddens is open for business from 7AM to 10 pm during the summer hours. Stat holidays as well. They are just east Kenora on Highway 17. One of those strange deals in our socialist country. We allow so called ""agency liquour stores"" to set their own hours (as opposed to LCBO and the Beer Store). In communites that are not served by government controlled LCBO and Beer Store outlets, big brother will allow corner stores to sell booze. Strange because Reddens is only about 10 minutes east of Kenora. Regardless, you can fill your boots there in the AM and then go into Kenora for groceries. Far better selection in Kenora than anything you will find in Nestor Falls. I would suggest Teds in the Kenora Shoppers Mall for groceries. Far better prices than Safeway. One last tip in terms of booze. DO NOT buy your beer at the LCBO in communities that are also served by a Beer Store outlet. The mark up is crazy. If the community is only served by an LCBO then the beer prices will be the same as they are at a Beer store outlet. I know, confusing..."
