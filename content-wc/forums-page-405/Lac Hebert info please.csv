If you like alot of pike action take the earlyer week 5/31 witch is the first week in june the waters are on the cold side for active walleye bite.you will still catch them. 6/14 on the other hand the wter temps have warmed , keep in mind the optimum temps for walleye to feed 64* water, mid june the temp should be at or a little below that temps.the weater up there can change at the drop of a hat. Camp 20 is on the island.there camps are well kept, there care taker stays on that island. there boat are 16'lunds with 20 hp mercs. witch are new every yr.Hot and cold water in the camps.washing and taking showers, deposits are made out back in the backhousa (out house).not many bugs on the island. the fishing is great all over, the caretaker can send you in the right places. as for method I am an avid walleye fisherman, I spend 80% of my time drifting and jiging, a drift sock is a must have. Other times casing stick baits and trolling deep divers. with two guys or best week there 850 walleye's 150 pike biggest wally 28"" ,pike 43"" 25 lbs. you can have days you will put 150 walleyes in the boat and days with 50, weather plays a big factor.If you choose air Tam , I recomend them above any other outfitter in Quebec.I have fished the north quebec shield lacs for 30 yrs,I my fishing experiance lac Hebert is the best Walleye lake in Quebec.There are a few others that come close but none better"
1453243,MikeG1,2012-06-24 05:44:00,434,"I very much appreciate your comments, they are exactly what I was hoping for. I will be limited to 100 pounds. Does this include food also? Thanks again."
1453485,octanehi5,2012-06-24 17:38:00,1104,"If you are flying out of Clova its 110 lbs any other point they fly from is 100lbs. this is your gear, food, beer, what every you are bringing on the plane gets weighed. if you are over the standard charge is .75 to 1.00 per lb over. It is very hard to make this weight. I always plan on being over and we split the cost. Beer is 18lbs a case of cans. thats almost 20% of your weight you can see how hard it is. Bring what you need and pay the differance its not alot of money compared to your trip. just don't duplicate alot of items, plan your meals."

Cold front came and for 2 days it was slow, then it rained for 10 straight hours....Good thing we had decent rain gear (a must). We drifted walleye, fishing close to bottom in 40-50 feet with 3/4 oz jigs crawlers, and gulps. Funny, we caught as many with gulps the one day we forgot our crawlers as we did with the crawlers. We caught about 300 walleye, average size 16in. We had a good few 22"", and one big girl @ 26"". Pike were slow. We spent about 2 days fishing for them and caught only 10, largest one was 36"", avergage 20-24"". Will probably go back next year, maybe June. Air Tamarac has excellent facilities, boat, motors new, the lake has everything you want - plenty of structure, weed bays. Watch the weather though, go prepared."
