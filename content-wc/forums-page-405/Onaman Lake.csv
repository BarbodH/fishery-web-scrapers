1481063,polaris-pete,2012-08-29 20:40:00,343,Spent a week on Onaman 2 Years ago.Very large and desolate Lake but the fishing was fantastic all week.I would like to go back but 19hr. drive was alittle long from here in WNY.I would go back in a heartbeat with the right guys.Had 1 guy that was a complainer and didn't want to do anything to help out. Guess thats why the drive was so long.Where you thinking about staying/
1481099,adempsey,2012-08-29 23:49:00,963,"Onaman is near Nipigon. It looks to be a fairly large body of water too, but I never hear much about it.For this trip it would be at a lodge, not an outpost. For Onaman, I believe the only lodge on the lake is Bauer's. I know you can get to the lake by trekking through the bush though. I believe Pasha Lake Cabins has a boat stashed there. Not sure about anyone else."
1481721,Finshady,2012-08-31 18:41:00,12,I believe there are a few camps in the area that have boats on Onaman. I have been going to Pasha Lake Cabins for many years. I believe it is about $100 a day to rent a boat on the lake. It is a good hike in from the parking area to get to the boats. The lake is amazing for both quality and quantity of walleye. We tend to take one day out of our trip to fish the lake and spend the rest of the week on the other lakes in the area. There are many lakes in the area you can drive into that have quantity but Onaman tops all for average size
