1479584,pikeman14,2012-08-26 09:22:00,144,Thanks for all of your ideas. I might stay with the stradic models. I am only hesitant because my last stradic has worn down near the roller of the bail. This causes the line to get stuck up in the roller every cast....this would drive anyone nuts...especially after waiting all year for your canada trip.

1481982,pikeman14,2012-09-01 20:23:00,144,"Picked up a pflueger 6740 today at cabelas. Its a little overwhelming with all the choices out there. I really liked the stradics new models along with some of the top pflueger spinners. But for 60$, the 6740 was a steal, now I can save up for possibly the newer stradic or pflueger xt for a new walleye rig. Both were really nice. I figure over the winter/spring the new models will come out. Thanks for everyone's input! I might not have looked at pflueger if it wasnt for this thread. pikeman14"
1478193,pikeman14,2012-08-22 19:50:00,144,"Hey guys, what reel do you have on your pike set up? I'm looking for a reel to match up with my 7 ft St. Croix rod. Shimano stradics have been good to me in the past, but looking to upgrade to something new. Has anyone tried browning spinning reels? Thanks"
1478228,lionfan19,2012-08-22 21:17:00,41,I have a few outfits for Northern. The Shimano Curado 300 on a medium heavy 7 1/2 Tourney series from Bass pro is a great setup. My other rig that I bought to fish Muskies on St. Clair is the Shimano Calcutta 400 on a Heavy action 7 1/2 ft tourney series. I use 50lb braid and both rigs cast like a dream. I have used lighter braid in the past and had problems with it digging into the spool. My buddy recently bought a Shimano Cardiff 400 and after looking it over I really like what you get for the price I want to say it retails for right around $119.
1478268,GOBIG,2012-08-23 02:34:00,126,"I use the Pflueger President 6740. I put 50 lbs Power Pro, and works like a dream. The price is around $60.00, so if I destroy it, I do not feel bad about buying another. It landed several of the big monsters at Eddies, with no problems. Great casting reel."
1478377,NathanH,2012-08-23 10:16:00,697,President xt is also a great reel little better parts

1478555,NathanH,2012-08-23 17:53:00,697,"Hard to beat those abu's for price and preformance, but thats only if your talking a bait casting reel and pole which in my opinion is the only way to go for the large Northerns. But I think this poster is looking for a spinning reel. Cabelas also makes some nice heavy duty salt water reels you may want to consider."
1478562,Explorer,2012-08-23 17:59:00,873,If your looking at staying with a spinning reel I don't see any reason at trying to upgrade from a Stradic. You have one of the best all time spinning reels. What are you looking for that the stradic won't handle.
1478567,octanehi5,2012-08-23 18:16:00,1104,"The biggest reel I bring in on a fly in trip Quantum energy pt 2000 spinning 10lb suffix 832. I have caught pike up to 43"" 25lbs. with this rig.Its about the fight in the fish. not a rod and reel you can tow a boat with.My reels are 8yrs+ old that adds up to about $15 per yr per reel. you get what you pay for. They call it super line for a reason. If you break 10lb test braid your drag is way to tight.I only use 30lb braid for stripers in the ocean"
