1482070,Pauly22,2012-09-02 07:51:00,3,"Was up to Clova on 309 via Parent 3rd week August. Dirt road was fine...40-50 mph to be on teh safe side, although must admit we went a bit faster in spots on our way back!. Good luck."
1452527,Guest,2012-06-22 05:36:00,0,"We traveled up and back to Hibou on this rd. it was washboard it was slow, but better than the beating we take on the last 30 miles of the penetration from Sennetere. The last 30 miles takes 3hours rocks big enough to bend your axel. But theres hope, our outfitter says they are building a new rd in from sennetere going to shorten the distance significantly. It will be great till the first jet ski shows up!!! ha ha. They are prepping us for a slot limit on the gouin, which will mean more nice fish for the Gillnetters, Doesnt make sound managment sense."
1455550,octanehi5,2012-06-28 19:46:00,1104,"our crew of ten will be on this road saturday afternoon, and will report on our return Have a safe one"
1456642,NYBowHunter,2012-07-02 09:09:00,35,Just got back from Gouin this past Saturday and the road looked great... from five thousand feet up! And that's about as close as I want to get to it.Kyle your 100% correct - a slot limit would be great if they also restricted the netting by the indigenous people there but you know that's not going to happen!
1456963,Guest,2012-07-03 05:18:00,0,"NYBOWhunter you cant prey on motherhood and expect the population will remain stable. We had to leave our last location because of this very thing.Iremember seeing the first signs of netting activity and thought they cant possibly hurt the population, within 5 years it was dead and stinking. Thers just no place for that kind of erradication."
1457008,Freytown,2012-07-03 06:57:00,770,"Kyle, you are correct.As long as the indigenous people can take all they want, when they want, and by any method, all conservation methods are doomed to fail. When the Gouin Reservoir Communal Wildlife Area fee was implemented it's was to protect the resource & to stock fingerling walleye. But the indigenous people still played by the same rules.IMO, this is a slap in the face to all Quebec residents, especially all born in Quebec. What make's you folk's second class citizens to the indigenous people? It's time to truly conserve by ALL or by no one. It's 2012 & time to move forward."
1457657,Guest,2012-07-04 12:37:00,0,"Great rant right on the mark, How many 6 dollar a day fees are paid by non indiginous folks to subsidize the comercial enterprise. Dont get me wrong I realise I am a guest the second I cross the border and that I am blessed to have access to such stunning wilderness, but theresuch a stark diffrence between what we do with a string and a stick and what they do with gillnets during the spawn That logic would dictate throttle back the natives even 50% and you have no population issuses We talked to a guide at our old place who told us about the rotting fish in the un attended nets, He said every seagull for 100 kilometers was there, he was so helpless to do anything I was worried he was gonna go POSTAL on the natives. Maybe common sense will prevail, after all they dont drive buffalo off a cliff anymore."
1459336,a3dad,2012-07-08 21:26:00,115,"Freytown: We may be getting off topic here, but I totally agree with your position on this. But I am curious as to the extent of effect it is having on the extensive body of water that the Gouin is. I know that Obedjiwan is in the very north of the reservoir and I also have never seen any native canadian people on the water after dozens of weeks there fishing Plamondon, Mattawa, and Sarana bays. Again, I'm not challenging you, just trying to establish how large this problem is. Is there a way we can quantify it? I also wondering if we (the WC community) can put some pressure on the ""Gouin Reservoir Communal Wildlife Committee"" to help preserve this fishery. Good fishery management is the responsibility of all that fish the reservoir - indigenous or not."
1459515,keek,2012-07-09 12:05:00,1003,"Traveled the road out from Clova yesterday (7-8-12) after our week on Lac Hebert and it's fine. I have heard so much bad press about this road but it was no big deal. It's a wide graded dirt road with a lot of dust and some short sections of washboard and soft shoulders in some places. Not to different than the dirt roads I've driven on in Maine, PA, Utah or Wyoming."
1459530,octanehi5,2012-07-09 12:43:00,1104,"As Keek said, the road is fine, Its a four hr gig 45 mph, If you go faster your are looking for trouble and it will find you. I have made this trip 7 times and never had a problem. Dirt road means just what it says But the fishing will be well worth your trouble. and to comment on the things on the gouin,With all its rules its still a great fishery, The indians have eminet domain over most of the lakes up there anyway. They take what they need to live, you are in there world up there. If you do not like the rules on any given lake, I would suggest you find one you like.With as big as the gouin is I think its redundent as to how many fish the indians take. The fisherman on the gouin take far more numbers of fish than the locals.More fishermen should think about what they are saying, before they say it. The fishing in Quebec is alive and well."
1460986,octanehi5,2012-07-13 06:35:00,1104,"We just got back sunday, Its 4 hrs at 45mph, a few washboards,the fishing is well worth the trip. Air Tamarac 743 walleye's 76 pike. biggest pike 46"" #30 lbs, walleye 25 3/4"", YA THINK"
1445445,Guest,2012-06-06 04:04:00,0,Anyone been up or down the 309 thru Parent and Clova this year? How are the road conditions? anyone know where the fire was? Thanx.
1445487,a3dad,2012-06-06 06:20:00,115,"Was up and down last week. The road to Parent is in excellent condition. As usually stretch from Parent to Clova was a little less maintained, but still very good. I always take it a little slower on that stretch anyway. Safe travels."
1445515,Guest,2012-06-06 07:07:00,0,Thanks you for the info we been going to LeHibou from sennetere on the penetration rd the last 30 miles takes us 3hrs BRUTAL on the trailers. Time to go the other way. Thanx again!
1445831,Freytown,2012-06-06 16:34:00,770,I will be going to Baie du Sud on Friday but yesterday the outfitter (La Pointe aux Dorés) said that the road from Parent to the Oskélanéo river bridge was just graded. I'll give a fishing & road report when I return.
1446041,octanehi5,2012-06-07 06:41:00,1104,Its good to hear the the road is in pretty good shape. our crew of ten guys in three trucks will be traveling that road in three weeks. I find that whats more dangerous than that road is the loose nuts behind the wheel of the cars and trucks that speed up and down that road. I have found more than once a truck or car upside down on the side of the road. 50 mph is about tops on that road. be safe and good fishing
1446134,a3dad,2012-06-07 09:55:00,115,"Also be careful of washouts, especially if it is, or has just rained hard. I have come across a couple of partially washed out bridges and sink holes in past years. I always have that in the back on my mind. For anyone new to the road, pay attention the red arrow signs along the road. They mean it where ever they're placed - SLOW DOWN! And also look for red surveyers tape tied to trees/bushes along side the road. Someone has marked a caution area. Good Luck and be safe."
1451302,JVB1,2012-06-19 14:04:00,12,"Wejust got back from a trip to Clova via Parent. The road was in bad shape. Horrible washboard on the straight runs and the turns of which there are many slow you down to 5mph or under. Very bumpy, we saw two graders sitting dust filled, none were working. The trip to Parent took 5 hours and the trip to Clova took 3 hours. 8 hours to travel 160 miles sheer torture! I will never travel this road again, they simply do not maintain it. The locals and outfitters seem to revel in delight that it is so hard to travel the road. I have fished from one end of this country to the other and have never had such a hard time traveling. Had it not been for some great fishing our trouble with road was not worth it. The local idiots traveling at high rates of speed do no t help. All I can say is find a new way to get to your outfiter or fish a different location. I will never subject my vehicile or myself to that torture again!"
1451341,NYBowHunter,2012-06-19 15:05:00,35,"""I will never subject my vehicle or myself to that torture again!"" Our group said this years ago and vowed never to travel on this or the Clove road you enter by Grand Remous. No matter what the outfitters say, sooner or later you hit these roads when not recently graded and they're pure ****. I destroyed a beautifully restored International Scout on this road - never again. Rather pay the extra and fly in."
1451346,Freytown,2012-06-19 15:15:00,770,I just returned on Saturday (6/16)...the road was fine. 140 miles in 4 hours. It's a gravel road not an Interstate.
1451569,octanehi5,2012-06-20 06:46:00,1104,"Thats about right freytown, I have been on this road the past ten yrs, Its a gravel road greatly affected by weather. you can not travel it at 50+mph. you guys that are tearing up your cars are going to fast there are spots on that road you need to be doing 25mph. its 140 miles at 35 mph its 4hrs, you just got to slow down, I understand the urge to get there. But you guys see its 140 mles and think your going to get there in 2 hrs, It aint happening. On your trip you should give yourself extra time. We drive to Clova the day before stay in the hotel Ritz. and fly out the next morning.the drive there is part of the trip have a safe one I will be on that road in ten days"
