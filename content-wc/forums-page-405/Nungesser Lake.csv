We always went the first week in August and fish would be 20 - 25 feet deep however, that can change from year to year and with weather conditions. The key is to use enough weight to be on the bottom and try different depths. When you find the depth they are biting at then stay in that zone from spot to spot. Wind blown points were the key in that lake back then and we always caught lots of walleye and the occassional Northern could be monsters. A very good lake....you'll enjoy it. Enjoy the trip in up the river.....really pretty and a good way to start a fun week."

1480503,Ralfeee,2012-08-28 11:46:00,33,Well how was your trip?
1480548,tparker,2012-08-28 14:21:00,100,"Got back on the 18th from a week at Birchpoint Camp on Nungesser Lake. It was my 3rd time there, and first trip for the other 3 in my party. Fishing was different than my previous 2 trips as I had never gone this late in the summer before. Camp was great as usual, and Roy was a great host as always. Good boats and dependable 25 horse motors. No issues at all. We battled a pretty stiff wind most of the week which made fishing the mid-lake reefs tough. The problem was that is where the fish were. The two days we could keep the boat where we wanted to, we got into the walleyes pretty good. Not much size this year, but all the eaters you wanted. Caught a few bonus pike up to 35"" while jigging also. Very fat, healthy fish. When the wind was howling and the lake was a bit rough, we fished points, shorelines, etc., and picked up a few, and moved on, etc. We trolled spinner rigs, and fished with jigs, both tipped with minnows. All in all, a good trip, fishing was good, not great. We just never found the bigger walleye. We did the Modified American plan and enjoyed every meal. Walleye for lunch every day was a treat as always, and the highlight was the walleye tacos which have been talked about on here before. Lowlight of the trip was the ticket I got just before Ear Falls on the way up. Live and learn. Already thinking about next year."
1480561,Rich B,2012-08-28 14:58:00,1081,"TPARKER, Thanks for the detailed report.....all in all sounds like another fun week up in the North Country. Does anyone bring in their own rigs to this camp (up the river) or is it such that you can only use their camp boats ? Rich"
1480604,tparker,2012-08-28 17:47:00,100,"Rich b, Camp boats only. You have about a 50 yard portage around a pretty cool waterfall on the way in. Birchpoint has a boat on each side of the portage. No way to get your own rig in."
1480680,Golden Eagle,2012-08-28 21:36:00,2642,"Rich, I know of one guest boat on Nungesser, but it stays there year round. I almost made it one time with a 14' Starcraft and 2 young sons. Sent you a PM."
1480683,Golden Eagle,2012-08-28 21:44:00,2642,"Rich, shoot me your email address in a PM and I'll fire a photo of the guest's boat, motor and trailer making it up Nungesser Lake to a camp. Not for everybody or every boat, but it's been done."
1480686,walleye88ia,2012-08-28 21:49:00,35,has anyone caught a blue walleye at nungesser? i caught a 22 incher a few years ago. a guide there said there are also blue perch in there. has any seen one?
1481028,steve03,2012-08-29 19:21:00,22,"I catch many blue walleye every year from Nungesser. I have been going for 10 years, but it seems like I have caught many more in the past 2 or 3 years. As for the blue perch I have not caught one of those. We went in the 3rd week of June this year and fishing was great as well!"
1461079,tparker,2012-07-13 09:31:00,100,"Hello everyone. Has anybody fished Nungesser Lake this year. Going up Aug. 12-18 with 3 buddies who have never been there before. I spent a week there in '08 and again in '09, but never in August. My other two trips were mid and late June. Wondering how different things will be. I stayed at BirchPoint Camp on those other two trips, and had great fishing both times. Staying there again this time. Any current reports, tips, etc would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Tim"
1461160,wallydave,2012-07-13 12:59:00,2151,"TP who are you staying with? A buddy of mine boated in several years ago. Lots ofpike and walleye, but that was a spring trip. Check with your outfitter for the latest reports."
1461173,tparker,2012-07-13 13:41:00,100,"WallyDave, Thanks for the response. We will be at BirchPoint Camp. Getting a little pumped for the trip, so just looking for some current reports. Both other times I've been up there, Roy Green, the owner has done a great job of putting us on fish. No doubt he will this time also."
1463002,kevplow,2012-07-18 09:03:00,9,"TP,I'll be up at Nungesser the same week as you but will be at NLL. Our group was at Birch Point in 08 also and did pretty well. No lunkers, but Roy sure tried hard. Can't wait to get going...leaving that Friday at 5pm and driving straight through."
1463064,tparker,2012-07-18 11:00:00,100,"kevplow, Have a great trip. I see you are from Chicagoland, where at?"
1463077,Ralfeee,2012-07-18 11:25:00,33,"Keep us updated upon your return. We were there last year at NLL in Mid June. We have been there at the end of July or first part of August, the only difference we seemed to see was the depth at which the fish were at. Never really had any issues finding fish, both large and small.Have a great time."
1463200,kevplow,2012-07-18 16:17:00,9,"I'm in Villa Park now. I grew up in Highland and Griffith IN though and moved out here about 10-15 years ago.More about fishing though...in your experience on Nungesser, how deep do you typically fish walleye? Nobody in my group claims to be a professional and we actually prefer the easier stuff...crawler harnesses in 15 feet or so. But we are always on the lookout for the potential to land the 25""+ beast. Last time up, Roy kept telling us we needed to be down in 30 feet, but we ended up with fewer fish and more frustration. This year I'm bringing Fireline instead of Mono to try getting deeper easier."
1463201,kevplow,2012-07-18 16:19:00,9,"Ralfeee, what part of Central Iowa? I'm the only one from my group that doesn't live in Newton. You anywhere close to them?And when you say the only difference was the depth of the fish...I assume they got deeper in August?"
1463267,tparker,2012-07-18 19:05:00,100,"Kevplow, I have never been up there in August before. In mid to late June, we usually fished wind blown points in 10-12 feet."
1463568,Ralfeee,2012-07-19 11:32:00,33,About 20 miles from Newton.The fish were deeper in August compared to June. Great Lake with lots of options.
