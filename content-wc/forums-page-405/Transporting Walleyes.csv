About 10 people were charged, some jailed for what he said was killing ther babies. Turns out that he was actually not an expert at all in the field. The Ontario government has so far overturned all of his cases and is paying millions in compensation to wrongly convicted people. I would love for Mr Maw to charge me for transporting a fish from the fish cleaning house to my cabin,, I would LOVE it! Americans in Canada have the same legal rights as Canadians in these types of offences, there is a due process, don't be afraid to use it."
1478405,NathanH,2012-08-23 11:23:00,697,Wow that guy sounds wild. Have to say we have a number of those guys at home. But for the most part they are just hard working folks doing there job and at the end of the day they are lookng for major violators and folks making it unsafe for others.
1479296,walleyeduran,2012-08-25 13:00:00,286,"BGunn, the discussion is about filleting your walleye catch at the camp's fish cleaning house and walking up to your cabin. Reading the regs. it says for transporting your catch they must be able to identify and count them. (also, they are refering to packaging your fish and mention freezing them many times). I suppose if someone wants to be a big enough prick, you could classify walking your cleaned fillets up to your cabin from the fish cleaning house and would thus have to leave a patch of skin on them for identification. (I guess if this ever comes up, I will just have to ask the conservation officer why he can not tell the difference between a walleye fillet and a northern fillet without a patch of skin attached). THAT WILL GET MY ARS IN A JAM!!!!!"
1479358,bigvenison,2012-08-25 17:12:00,15,I'm going to side with the CO here because of where the cleaning shack MIGHT be -- say 1/2 mile away and you needed to drive there -- the answer lies some where there -- there has to be some reasonable distance which the CO would ignore the letter of the law--say within 20 yds from the cottage--that I don't know --better to ask him

1480688,Golden Eagle,2012-08-28 21:51:00,2642,I'll clean my walleyes in the cabin if the fish cleaning house is more than a couple of hundred feet away.
1480854,HighTech,2012-08-29 11:30:00,75,"NO he does not. NO fish cop anywhere trumps the law. There are methods of being represented without being there. IF a CO is abusing you or his powers he needs to be stopped. The place to do that is in court. Be very nice to him when you meet him, document everything, read the actual laws (not the handouts) and challenge him when you have to in court. It's your duty, AS for me ""Give me Liberty or Give me Death"") ... possibly a bit extreme in a fish cop case, but I hope you get the point!!!!"
1480871,tv4fish,2012-08-29 12:00:00,2694,"Amen Brother -- I think what needs to be done with this ""certain individual"" - is to definitely challenge what he appears to have done/continues to do - bullying tactics don't get very far with me and they shouldn't with anyone else, either. There ARE ways to deal with people like this. Sounds to me like he needs to be ""taught a lesson"" so he gets his act straight again."
1481006,teddi,2012-08-29 18:12:00,349,maybe you should come up and teach him a lesson then. call me so i can watch.
1476312,SNOPRO,2012-08-18 18:03:00,108,"Just got back from a week on GullRock. Talking to a guy who stays the whole summer there every year told me the MNR Officer for the GullRock Lake area warned him that when you clean your fish at the camp fish cleaning shack, you must leave the patch of skin on the filets and are not allowed to zipper or reduce each fillet to smaller pieces even if you take them directly to your cabin for cooking that day or evening. You must remove the skin and chunk your fish in your cabin's kitchen just before cooking. The officer told him taking cleaned fish from the fishhouse to your cabin qualifies as ""Transporting fish"" and subject to fines. I've always cleaned my fish totally in the fish house except the fish to be frozen to bring home. Has anyone heard of Transporting Fish defined this way???????"
1476323,v-bay gord,2012-08-18 18:53:00,3168,Never heard of such an interpretation. Don't think it would have much chance to stand up in court. I will continue to take the skin off and zipper walleyes for my guests that want to eat them in the cabin. If a CO can't tell the difference between an unfrozen walleye or a northern (skin off) then they don't deserve the job.
1476354,Golden Eagle,2012-08-18 20:35:00,2642,Don Maw will fabricate a case and have it upheld by the judge in Ear Falls. He might also bust you for being over the limit in the fish cleaning house while your buddy is at your cabin getting the cooking oil hot.
1476825,tv4fish,2012-08-20 07:55:00,2694,I SURE hope you are kidding on this one........ there ARE ways to handle that if you're not??

Has convinced a judge that he's always right.I've heard stories about him all the way down to LOTW.He's never busted me, but he's been in my cabin several times without reasonable cause. I'm super careful not to break a law. Careful to the point of becoming uncomfortable. It shouldn't be that way."
