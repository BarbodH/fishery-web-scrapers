1482478,onetimedave,2012-09-03 11:26:00,502,"Did you fish the Kap River leaving the lake towards Meclhett? If so, any luck there?"
1482501,TIGHTLINER,2012-09-03 12:45:00,223,DURING THE MONTH OF MAY WE HAD HIGH WINDS RAIN SLEET AND SNOW FOR 5 DAYS. HAD TO FISH WHERE EVER YOU COULD GET SHELTER AND HOPE YOU COULD GET BACK TO THE CABIN. GOOD FISHING AT THE MOUTH OF KAP GOING INTO THE RIVER AND FROM MELCHET MOUTH UP THE RIVER GOING INTO THE KAP.
1482503,TIGHTLINER,2012-09-03 12:48:00,223,Dog 2 ... Did you see lots of wildlife and was it looking like fall was coming on ? We never saw a moose or bear while in camp but plenty of them driving along the roads.
1482569,dog2,2012-09-03 17:04:00,198,"pikeandtina,yes this was with awo. fourth time on this lake,all the other lodges and fisherman we talked to said the same windy and low water. OTdave we could not get out of kap the water was to low west side had 8 to 10 inches running in it east side about the same ,we did not try to float through it was so low the boat alone hung up with no load. Tighliner we saw 2 moose , also found fresh wolf and bear tracks on east end of lake. then on the way out of Nakina saw another moose, the temperature was 58 at night 84 during the day felt more like the middle summer;but overall it was a good week!"

1482700,GOBIG,2012-09-04 06:44:00,126,"Did you go to Tester. We did in the spring. The fish were bigger there. The wind was to strong to fish on Melchett so we made the journey back to Tester. Might be to long of a trip from Kap, but could be a place just to get out of wind."
1482724,dog2,2012-09-04 07:54:00,198,"GOBIG; the water was to low to get out off of Kap. you had to drag boat up over the rocks .We only had about 6inches of water flowing between the rocks on tester side .We had plans on hitting Tester its a nice trip up to there its a little cooler water account of the springs that feed it and you are right the wind isn't as bad there.The water was so low the river flowing in was a 18 ft. wide channel ,you looked up from the boat seat to see the shore line .Greg from Nakina Air said it was the lowest he has seen it . remi will have to add to dock to get the Otter in the floats will drag at dock."
