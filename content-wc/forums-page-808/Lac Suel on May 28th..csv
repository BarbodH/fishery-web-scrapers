539910,68 starcraft,2004-05-25 08:01:00,32,Going to Fish Below the Dam of Lac Seul on the River and try some smaller lakes in the area hopefully we can find some nice eyes on smaller lakes if the weather gets bad on the big lakes. May even head up to the the Red Lake area and try Gullrock but pretty much playing by ear. Hope the walleye are as hungry as i am.

Fishing was a little slow but, certainly not poor. We did get many fish in the 24-28"" range and a lot more ""slotters"". Typical rigs are jig/minnow (salty) or worms. Weather was good and the water level was quite high for this time of year. We spent a day in Sen bay also and the fire of last year was certainly obvious. All in all, a very good trip and I rate this as one of the best walleye fisheries in North America."
