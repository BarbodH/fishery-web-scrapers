540191,Hawker,2004-06-01 21:36:00,3967,"The ""NEW"" Wal-Mart at Ft. Frances is located on Hwy 71 going west out of town from the border crossing. You can't miss it. It's a ""Super Center"" store but size wise is about the size of our older Wal-Mart stores we all grew up (older) with. Grocery section is in the middle of the store per the wife who just shopped there last Thursday. She wasn't impressed with the selections storewide but said they did have good grocery supplies though I don't know if everything on your list is carried there. Hawker"

540470,Guest,2004-06-09 08:48:00,0,Go and shop at WalMart and lower the wage scale in Canada the way they have in the states.
540496,balsl6,2004-06-09 20:30:00,426,I do not think I would drive all the way to fort frances to go to Walmart????
540686,Guest,2004-06-14 07:20:00,0,Walmart came into play because I am assuming that the grocery items would be less expensive at Walmart than at Safeway where I found everything to be expensive.
539861,Guest,2004-05-24 06:41:00,0,Just wondering if I can do all my grocery shopping at WalMart ?
539894,fishmaster,2004-05-24 18:56:00,209,Don't know that a Wal-Mart is in Ft. Frances. Dryden and Kenora have Wal-Marts.
539898,Guest,2004-05-24 20:49:00,0,"the wal mart in fort has dairy, canned goods, snacks, pop, some meats. It doesn't have any potatoes or fresh produce. Prices are lots better than Safeway."
539902,Guest,2004-05-25 06:57:00,0,Thanks.I was hoping to avoid Safeway.That place was unbelieveable.

539913,Guest,2004-05-25 08:23:00,0,Is the Walmart is Ft. Frances open 24hrs a day?
539950,Guest,2004-05-26 05:47:00,0,"The Safeway in Fort Frances has high "" gouge the tourist"" prices.I have never been to the Safeway in Dryden although I would assume since they are farther from the border they may be a little more reasonable."
539963,Guest,2004-05-26 09:14:00,0,where is the walmart in fort francis?it must be new.
539965,Trailerguy,2004-05-26 09:25:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I beleive it is in the northwest part of town, several blocks west on the hwy going to Emo. You can go to walmart.com and get it on a street map."
539973,Guest,2004-05-26 11:06:00,0,"Dryden has a very nice Safeway and an IGA and X-Tra Foods. You can't use a credit card at X-Tra Foods, though. Safeway is good and so is IGA. The Safeway in the Fort is good. Sure prices are higher there. You can shop on the US side and bring all but potatoes. The Canadians still don't want our potatoes here. :-)"
