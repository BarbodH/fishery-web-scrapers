540627,Guest,2004-06-12 09:24:00,0,"Well, they are there, but not in great volume. A few have been caught early-season walleye fishing in deeper water during cold, late springs like this year. Other than that, I would say look deep. If you are guiding, as your name would suggest, I would take the guys out and use your expertise and experience to try a couple theoretically good lake trout spots, for the first hour or so in the morning. During this time I would never shut up about how good the walleye fishing is on Lac Seul, and hopefully your guests will get the idea after a while . . . might as well fish walleye on one of the best walleye fisheries in the world!!"
540631,Guest,2004-06-12 13:07:00,0,"Thanx NWO Fishing Bum. And no I am not a ""reel"" guide. I just use the name to work my 6 brothers. 10 in our family and I am number 7. I set up all the brother fishing trips so i use the name. We have tried Bray Lake for trout and marked a full bottom of fish in the 60-80 foot range. Pulled up one whitefish and one 6# northern from about 70 feet deep while vertical jigging for trout. To me Bray would seam to hold trout as it flows into greater lac seul. We'll be up there the 16th thru 20th for the walleye and I always wonder about a little trout action. The locals are pretty tight lipped when I ask about trout. Guide07 out"

540634,Guest,2004-06-12 13:54:00,0,Just looking for a little variety and challenge on Lac Seul during our annual trip. I do fish Pipestone Lake some springs for trout and really enjoy the thrill of the fight. 7
