We caught enough for shore lunch and a few big fish. The weather probably had a lot to do with it. It was sunny and calm out. We fished just south of the Manitu Rapids area. The fishing started slow until the clouds finally moved in. Once we had the clouds the fish started biting. We caught very few small fish which is unusual for us. Most of the fish we caught were in the 18-24 inch range. We caught some dandies and they were mostly caught in 4-10 feet of water. I didn't think the fishing was fantastic but we did catch some nice sized fish. We are going back on the 24th to try it again. I think things might really be going by then. Yes, the water level is up! I would say 6-7 feet higher than last year in this area. They got around 14 inches of snoe the middle of May and then a lot of rain shortly after that. The water level now in only a foot or two below the water line you can see on the shore line rocks. Have a fun summer. Otts"
