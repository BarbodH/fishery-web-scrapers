540572,Guest,2004-06-11 18:44:00,0,"Just returned from an excellent week of fishing, considering constantly changing weather patterns which included, rain, lightning, and even a day of 40-50 mph winds! I primarily fish northern so upon arrival I was disappointed to find water temps approx 2 weeks behind normal and very minimal weed growth in the areas I fish. Did manage a couple over 14 pounds but not very many were chasing the large baits we like to throw. One day went to slowly trolling (2.2 mph) super rouges and husky jerks caught 35 northerns and 5 walleyes with the biggest being 16.5 lbs, but then like clockwork the next day the bite was gone. That was the story of our week, geat bite one day, gone the next. Walleye fishing was fantastic. Gawly's bay is where the numbers are at right now, with guys in our group catching 50 plus fish per person per day. I did well on the main lake in super shallow water (3 to 7) feet also. Keynote is kicking out alot of numbers also, with our group hooking into an 8 pounder as well. The action down there is primarily on the south end down by the island and on the west shore along the bays and coves, using jig/minnow or slowly pulling lindy's. Finally, smallmouth fishing rocked! We caught alot of 16 to 18 inch fish along the shorelines alot of places, but primarily in North Bay and Moose Bay. Just throw on a rapala or a small spinnerbait and be ready for some hardcore fighting! All in all it was a fun week of fishing, 4 seperate shore lunches meant for alot of fish eating, good comraderie at night with the guys and some Labatt's, and even got to meet and make some new friends in camp. Can't wait until 2 weeks...the weeds should be coming on and the fish should start to move out of Gawlys bay into the main lake areas where I like to fish for them. Big Mike"

540617,cough6609,2004-06-11 19:36:00,48,Appreciate the report Mike...makes August seem a long way away though! Craig
540622,Guest,2004-06-12 01:54:00,0,"August is a ways away, but with longer days coming and warmer weather also inevitable, August will be just as good as it usually is. The only thing I hope for is that the sun starts shining and allows the weed growth to fully happen, otherwise the cabbage may be far less sparse as some years."
540642,AB,2004-06-12 20:18:00,61,"Big Mike, Sounds like the water levels are back to normal? Glad you had a good trip. Thanks for keeping us late seasoners updated! AB"
540654,Guest,2004-06-13 09:01:00,0,Was fishing at Wine Lake last week and saw some boats from Wabaskang done in Wine was that any of you and how did you do. The boats where back in Beaver Lake.
540668,Guest,2004-06-13 16:05:00,0,"If I could get my Crestliner over the falls I would fish it alot. Used to fish Wine when I was a kid and did awesome, but the fishing on Wabby has drastically improved over the last 10 years and I truly don't feel its necessary for someone booked on Wabby for a week to go down there, unless you are staying at Lundy's where its not all that far away. But don't get me wrong...I'd fish it if I could get there easily."
