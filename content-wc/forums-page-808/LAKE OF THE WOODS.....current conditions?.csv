Water temps were in the low 60s, but have dropped back to the upper 50s during the last week due to weather. The walleye are starting to move shallow. The smallies are just starting to make nests and are ready to spawn. Northern fishing has been inconsistent so far. Everybody is waiting for a few warm, sunny days strung together, and the fishing should explode. Water levels are above average and still rising. Hope that helps."

540786,Guest,2004-06-15 18:39:00,0,I guided the last two days and caught about 100 the first day and about 50 the next. Fished near near Bells Harbour and Painted Rock. All the fish came out of 27' to 35' using 3/4 ounce jigs.
