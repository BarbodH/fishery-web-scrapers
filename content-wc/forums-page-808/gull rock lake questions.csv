540623,Guest,2004-06-12 06:36:00,0,I am mostly a muskie fisherman. My boy has gone with me a few times and is not happy with the rate of catching fish that you can encounter with that species. Would like to take him somewhere where we can catch alot of walleyes and northerns. I was to gull rock about 13 years ago in the fall and had fantastic walleye fishing. I am wondering if it is still so good? We probably would go in late july if I could find an opening at a resort. Is that time of year good also up there? I have also heard good things about lac suel. any good reports from there and what would be good resorts at both lakes? is there muskies in lac suel?

You will catch lots of them all summer long. We caught bigger fish this year,many were 20-25 inches. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge. This is an outstanding resort. The cabins are clean and well kept. Bud and Malinda are great hosts. Bud fishes and knows the lake very well, he always puts us on the fish. You will catch Pike along with the walleye. I dont think there are Muskeys in this lake. You can fish 5 different lakes out of this resort and lake. I highly reccomend this lake and Five Lakes lodge. They may have opening in July. www.fivelakeslodge.com Good Luck Fishing Ihawk22"
