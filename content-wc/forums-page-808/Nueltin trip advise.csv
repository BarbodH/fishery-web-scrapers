540736,Guest,2004-06-14 19:35:00,0,We are planning a fly in for 2005 and are looking at Nueltin Lake. We are considering one of the mini camps with a camp cook and no guides. Looking for some advise; what kind of fishing can we expect? Which mini camp to stay at (windy river or nueltin narrows)? What time of the year would you reccomend? We go to Canada several times a year but have never spent the dollars for a flyin and want to take our sons next year for a trip of a lifetime. Thanks in advance for any help on this trip you can give us BKT
