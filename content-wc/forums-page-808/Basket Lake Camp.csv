Last I talked to her she was having new brochures made up but they weren't done yet, that was a while ago cause she was supposed to send me one also but I havn't gotten it yet. I think her memory isn't what it used to be. Tim"

540722,Guest,2004-06-14 14:38:00,0,red--could ya get me the phone number to basket lake camp so i could give Olga a call. thanks.
540727,red2,2004-06-14 15:30:00,16,"Curious. Her number is 807-223-1355. She has a radio phone so when she is talking she can't hear you, you have to wait for the silence then talk and she will hear you, kind of tricky. Good luck Tim"
540524,Guest,2004-06-10 10:48:00,0,Does anyone know anything about basket lake. going up for the first time in 2 weeks. heard they were the only cmap on the lake and it is good size lake. Also heard that it may be for sale or was just sold???? makes me wonder about it a little. any info would be appreciated. Keep the lines tight.
540530,red2,2004-06-10 14:46:00,16,"Curious,I used to go to Basket but haven't been there for quit a while now. Its a great lake to fish or at least it used to be. Good Walleye and Northern fishing and desent perch. Olga North owns the Camp and it has been for sale for as long as I can remember. She is a very nice lady. Getting up there in age now. The cabins as I remember are clean and comfortable. She rent boats but not motors, She dosn't want to mess with that anymore. You will have a very nice trip, the road going into the camp used to be very sh#ty so take it easy I have seen guys come into fast and ruin their boats on the way in! They just take a pounding. The lake is about 10 miles from one end to the other. Its got some rocks so be careful. Any more questions just ask. Have a good trip, I'm thinking about going back myself next year. Good luck Tim"

They were going to take me and my wife there for the day a couple weeks ago when we were on Wabigoon as Terry had some work to do there but due to the crappy weather we never went. I know they slow troll for some decent trout on Little Basket. I believe Terry said you can access Basket from Little Basket. Hope that helps a little. Dan"

They usually go in August and do quite well on walleyes and northerns. It's been good enough that they have been going back for all these years, and I can't talk them into coming to Minaki instead. I wish you good weather IaCraig"
