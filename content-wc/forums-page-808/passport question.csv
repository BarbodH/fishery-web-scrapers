540684,Trailerguy,2004-06-14 05:47:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Passports certinally are better than B.C.'s and ID's but it's just a rumor at this time. Customs only looked at our ID's so far this year and I've been through several times.
540689,Guest,2004-06-14 07:49:00,0,Just got back from canada and on the way in they didn't check anything and on the way back to the states they just asked for our drivers license.
540691,Guest,2004-06-14 07:57:00,0,"Same here. They didn't ask for any ID on the way in but on my way back into the states they asked for ID. When I handed him my passport the level of questioning seemed to drop a level or 2. I feel passports will give you a little more respect from the border guards when crossing, but I sure wouldn't spend the money on a passport to go to Canada at this stage. If you have one bring it!!!"

540704,Guest,2004-06-14 09:52:00,0,Thanks!!! I will defineitly get a passport next year.It is sad it has come down to this.
540708,Guest,2004-06-14 12:00:00,0,Make sure your papers are in order... before crossing the border.
