540700,EconGuy,2004-06-14 09:15:00,32,I have searched the Canadian Customs site and can't find any specifics about bringing in fresh fruits and vegetables. I do remember from a couple years ago that potatoes were not allowed at the Baudette crossing. Anybody know what the current restrictions are or where tofind them on the internet? Thanks EconGuy
