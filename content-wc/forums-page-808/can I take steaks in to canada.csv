540688,Guest,2004-06-14 07:48:00,0,"Can someone help me understand the rules on bringing meat into Canada. I am going on a hunting trip this fall and we had planned on bring frozen steaks for dinner each night. Each one comes in its own plastic bag sealed and are frozen when we leave home, this helps cut down on ice as we can only take 200 lbs per man when we fly in. I thought we had a plan but now I am not sure we can take the steak with us. Any help would be great Thanks Keith"
