1463349,DeBo,2012-07-18 22:49:00,211,My Minaki adventure starts saturday. Looking like the water will be mid 70s so the muskies should be ACTIVE! Haven't heard much but it's quality musky water so just gotta find them and make 'em bite. Water levels have been constant all year according to LWCBA. No idea if that is good or bad.
