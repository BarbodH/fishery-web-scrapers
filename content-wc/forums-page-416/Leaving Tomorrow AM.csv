Gerry, Barbara and Ryan, who run the camp, are the best! The folks who stay at the camp are mostly return customers and are a friendly group. My good friend Terry will be with me the first week and my good friend Rick will join me in week 2. Both guys are great fishing partners, though, clearly, I seriously outfish them every year. In June, I was in Ontario for a week with a different group and we had the best fishing in the 12 years we have fished Lake Pashkokogan. Well, gotta pack up the boat and my 4runner!
