Of course the local lakes have muck, sand and gravel bottoms. In Canada, I've donated my share of jigs to the rocks chasing walleye. Dragging a drophot weight around on a shield lake seems like it would be more frustrating than productive. Any thoughts on this presentation for smallmouths up north?

We fished humps that came up to 25-30 feet, in 45-55 feet of water. With the warmer summers we have had the past few summers that would be a good idea. BOB"

I fish a clear lake in Canada each year and do well with this mehod as well as with jigs tipped with twister tails. we will troll cranks or worm harness when we have a few folks in the boat. When I go out alone, I like to fish the drops and other area with jigs. I will use drops shot tubes or finese worms with good success"
1463566,Guest,2012-07-19 11:27:00,0,i drop shot a lot up there. i use use split shots crimped on a lighter drop line. most of the time if you hung up you can just pull the line through the shot and all you have to do is crimp on a new one. much cheaper than a new jig and easier also. i drop shot flukes and trick worms mostly. plus when using split shots you can carry less other lead because it can be used for so many applications.

I'm not sure how I'll define efficient or a lot of time. I'll give it a try and see how it goes. Thanks for the comments. Nimstug"
