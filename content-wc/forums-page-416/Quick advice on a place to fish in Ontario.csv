All the walleyes you can handle, a few lake trout to boot. I posted a link to a video I took while there. Check out the sturgeon lake report thread for the link. If you want any details shoot me a pm."

1463101,chadly,2012-07-18 12:35:00,27,All - A fried of mine were planning on heading to the border waters of MN and Ontario to fish next week but a last minute thought left us searching for an answer. I have always heard how incredible the Walleye fishing can be the heart of Ontario. Instead of taking a boat to our usual spot in Voyagers (Namakan and Kabetogema) we were thinking of just taking a few rods and heading up a few hours into Canada for some Walleye fishing at a lodge we can drive too and use their boats. Requirements - Place would need to rent boats. I am fine with a 16ft tiller. Need a clean place to sleep. Approx 4-6 hours into Canada We are heading out of Minneapolis and can cross at International Falls or by Grand Portage. Any favorite spots folks can recommend to catch large limits of Walleye's at a reasonable price. And yes I know reasonable is subjective but I would hope we could find a place to sleep and a boat for approximately 200 - 250 a day. If not we may just hit up our old haunts. This is very last minute as we are leaving next Wednesday for a few days so I understand finding a vacancy may not be possible.

1463182,Bobbajig,2012-07-18 15:28:00,24,I would recommend Gold Pines Camp on Lac Seul in Ear Falls. The owners are very friendly. I have fished there 3 times in the past 5 years. Only wish I was going this year. Good Luck
1463193,Bitinlight,2012-07-18 15:45:00,95,WWW.LacSeulOutposts.com They boat you in from Deception Bay Landing which is 12 miles north of Sioux Lookout. They have 16 foot Lund Rebels with 30 Merc 4 strokes. Portable depth finder is helpful. They will direct you to the fish but it is not hard to find them. Camp is 40 miles in and takes 55 minutes to get there. Great fishing close to camp. Might have an opening.
