1462433,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-17 04:36:00,223,Once again i am going to mention eddies my pb for walleyes and pike two years ago. Runs a great camp and the fishing is fantastic. Eddie himself is in a class by himself. You will not be disapointed. Maybe you can get him to cook up some walleye wings.
1462466,Guest,2012-07-17 07:30:00,0,"Over the years I feel that I'm able to weed out the fishing camps / outposts who classify themselves as trophy lake and really are just average. It's rather basic and casts a very broad stroke, but a few things I watch out for: 1. Photos of of a couple eater walleye with 3 or 4 northerns. Some people prefer the northerns, but making a general assumption why wouldn't they post a full stringer of walleyes. Is it or was it that hard to get a limit? 2. Consistent attendance at any and all sport shows. If you have 80% repeat business and been open for 20 years,.....why would you waste your winter attending sports shows (having a booth is not cheap). 3. Large fish on a stringer. This just doesn't do it for me . These are alot of stereotypes and not always correct, but in general I do feel I developed some correlation between potential trophy fishing and just medicore potential."
1462946,ahennessey,2012-07-18 07:27:00,2,"Thanks for the responses! We are strictly catch and release on all big fish. We have gone out of Leuenbergers in years past out of Nakina and looking to expand our horizons. Always had decent fishing but we are really looking for walleyes 26"" plus and pike 40"" plus on a consistent basis. Sounds like Eddies North seems to be close to what we are looking for in terms of good numbers. What is usually the best time to head up that way? We usually go around Memorial Day weekend."
1462961,Hillbiehle,2012-07-18 07:55:00,66,If you want lots of big walleyes (and northern) I would check out Lake St. Joe (Winoga). At this time there is another thread discussing Lake St. Joe which has my input.
1462113,ahennessey,2012-07-16 10:34:00,2,"Looking to do a fly-in fishing trip next year with a group of guys and have been in the process of finding a really good/great trophy class fly-in fishing lake for walleyes and northern pike. Seems to be a lot of the so-called ""Trophy"" lakes as advertised by all of the outfitters however I am really looking for personal bests and experiences for a consistent lake that produces large fish on a day in and day out basis. Looking at providing a trip of a life time. Any input or pictures would be appreciated! PM me if needed! Thanks!"
1462126,Golden Eagle,2012-07-16 10:59:00,2642,"I frequent a lake that holds tons of small to medium walleyes and lots of huge pike. It's strictly catch and release for pike. They're not for the wall. We don't kill walleyes over 18""Not sure if this fits your needs."
1462174,Hawkfan,2012-07-16 12:27:00,237,"We have flown in to Gull Lake a number of years and it has produced. We had days when walleye over 21 inches was more common than eater size. One afternoon our group pulled countless fish over 24"" including a 27.75"" and two 28"". Biggest was 31.5"" over the years. You can get there through Red Pine Lodge out of Sioux Lookout. Great outpost.WWW.fishredpine.com"
1462239,Tinyfish,2012-07-16 15:08:00,16,"Just got back this weekend from Pasha Lake Cabins and had a great time. I've been on a fly in trip before the only problem was the fish weren't biting and we were stuck on the lake. The advantage we had last week at Pasha Lake Cabins was we were able to fish many different lakes. We fished about four lakes and caught many walleye in the 24"" to 30"" range and tons of pike. So depending on how much effort you wanted to put in to get to certain lakes you could fish for numbers one day and then move over to trophies the next day. Some guys at the lodge fished a lake that was unfished for something like 15 years they caught in excess of 100 pike that day. Give Chad the owner a call at Pasha Lake Cabins or check out his website. If you check his latest fishing report you'll see me i'm the first two pictures at the top of the report. I found out about Pasha Lake from the fishing show Fishing Canada if you search the fishing canada website you can find the episode and their comments about Pasha Lake."
1462259,Pooch,2012-07-16 15:55:00,4619,"""Trophy"" walleye or whatever gets overused.What is considered a ""trophy"" on one body of water might be considered an ""eater"" on another.Ask the camp owner what he defines as a trophy fish. Look for pictures where there is something in the picture of a known length for comparison. Beware, some guys holding a fish towards the camera have really long arms!!Where we like to fish any fish over 26 inches is a ""nice"" fish, but braggin' rights start closer to 28 to 30 inches. Trust the ruler, but question the fisherman who claims a large fish. We (me included) tend to over estimate a fishes length almost every time. We are fisherman and that's just what we do!Good luck.Pooch"
1462265,phishfearme,2012-07-16 16:08:00,1242,"pooch has very vauable words of wisdom. exagerating sizes and numbers is rampant on this board and others. for me, 26/27 inch walleye and 40 inch pike are trophies. have been to lots of flyin lakes and since we make the requirement that the lake is ""private"" (no other cabins or outfitters on the lake) we tend to go to smaller lakes that tend to not produce trophy fish. but the trip we did last year was special. see my report at the URL below and decide for yourself:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ht=kearns+lake but in general, BIG lakes are trophy lakes with only a few exceptions. phish"
1462293,wallydave,2012-07-16 17:32:00,2151,"I know some folks say there are too many reports of great fishing with Eddie North but so much positive feed back must mean something!! Like Pooch says those who fish stretch our length of fish! I'm thinking it must be the metric standard conversion thing that makes our fish ""-grow"""
1462357,pike50plus,2012-07-16 19:45:00,584,For Pike and some nice walleye Eddies North out of Nakina is hard to beat. I have had both species in trophie sizes at camps way north and west
1462395,5 of Diamonds,2012-07-16 20:56:00,151,"If you're looking for 40"" Pike regularly (several daily) and an occasional 50"" Pike, then check out bushlandadventures.com. World class trophy Pike fishing in Quebec. I have several posts/threads w/ recent pictures. PM me should you need more information."
