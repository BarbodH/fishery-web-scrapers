1463128,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-18 13:25:00,235,"Just got back from a fun fly-in fishing trip to the Jeanette Lake outpost operated by Kabeelo Airways. This was my fifth time fishing Jeannette in 8 years. We had a group of eight guys and fished four full days. Weather was tough for walleye fishing – highs in the 90’s and no wind for two of the four days. There was also a mayfly hatch going on. Despite this, there were fish to be caught and we caught fish. I wish I could say my dad and I caught as much as the other guys, but for some reason our numbers lagged behind the three other boats in our party. The first day, dad and I only caught 24 fish combined – slowest day I can remember in Canada (and we were working hard!). As the trip went on, the fishing improved. We lost count of the total number of fish along the way, but nobody was boating 100 fish per day or anything like that. However, some lunker holes were discovered (about 18-25 feet) and we ended up boating 72 walleyes that were 20 inches or larger for the entire group. One of our boats boated 12 walleyes 23 inches or larger in a two hour span – an incredible spot! My dad and I made the trip up the river (35 minutes each way) to Betty Lake and we fished Betty for about an hour and a half. Fishing was very slow in most of the spots we tried, but we managed to find a set of rapids flowing into Betty and it was fun to catch a few walleyes and northerns in 2-3 feet of water in the current – almost like fishing a small stream. I recommend the trip to Betty for the sake of exploring, but make sure you trim up the motor and have the front seat guy keep an eye out for rocks. A couple parts along the way you may be best served to pull the motor all the way up and paddle for a bit. There was no specific pattern for the trip - we caught fish in as shallow as two feet (when wind was blowing into rock piles) and as deep as 27 feet. The biggest fish were generally at least 18-20 feet deep. Salted minnows were the bait most used, but crawlers, leeches and soft plastics also produced. We didn’t fish northerns much, but a 39.5 incher was caught while jigging walleyes. My dad and I trolled for pike with large plugs for about an hour and a half on the last afternoon and caught a 36inch and a 34inch --- probably should have done more of that. Kabeelo’s service was outstanding as usual. We flew out and got picked up right on schedule, the new cabin on Jeanette was fantastic and Kabeelo flew our extra over-weight gear in a third flight for free (I’m guessing because we are a long time customers). Boats and motors performed perfectly for us. All in all, it was a very fun trip with great company. The numbers and rate of catch weren’t as high as past years, but I think that was a reflection of the mayfly hatch and the hot/calm conditions. My fears about the forest fire having an impact on Jeanette were unfounded – the fishery seems healthy. Can’t wait to go back!"
