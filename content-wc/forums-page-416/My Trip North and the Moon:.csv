1464469,fishingfever,2012-07-21 12:52:00,85,FWIW-I have caught or been in the boat when 3 walleyes over 10# were caught. All were caught within + or - 3 days of the new moon.

1464527,octanehi5,2012-07-21 18:26:00,1104,the new moon is much better fishing than that of a full moon. you can check the differance on the solunar tables
1464546,downriverbob,2012-07-21 19:34:00,880,"Some of the research that I have read related to moon phase states that certain moon phases effect certain species differently. The dominate species are more likely to feed during the full moon, I have seen this in reguards to salmon, tarpon, and muskies. As I said earlier I usually schedule my Lake of the Woods vacation during the full moon. I have had some pretty exciting nights during the full moon, clear nights, and calm water. During these conditions I have raised and caught a lot of nice muskies, on top water lures. BOB"
1461871,wallydave,2012-07-15 18:08:00,2151,"Bill that is a wonderful time to be up North! One of my favorite memories at Goose Bay is sitting on the deck on cabin 8 drinking a Blue, smoking a Cuban cigar and watching the full moon rising through the the trees! The firey orange through the trees and reflecting on the Lac!! Wow just about perfect!! Oh yea in early June the fishing was out standing!! Bill have a great trip!"
1461929,Glenman12,2012-07-15 20:30:00,762,"fwiw..several years ago me and my partner along with another boat in our group bought a device from our lodge owner called the Anglers Edge...it estimates fish activity using not only phases of the moon but also barometric pressure..its about the size of a cell phone..some of the info you need to program it correctly is your time zone along with your latitude and longitude coordinates..while a few times it has been off, 90% of the time its is uncannily spot on..dont even know if they sell them anymore.."

1461954,Glenman12,2012-07-15 21:22:00,762,thanks for being more industrious than me...yep..thats what we have in our boat bag...we only paid $60...
1461959,tooski,2012-07-15 21:32:00,393,Cheapest was at Amazon @ $79.00. Unusual for electronics to go up in price over time but it apparently did. You say you like it huh?
1462002,Glenman12,2012-07-16 06:07:00,762,"yeah, like it a lot..when we got them the retail price was $85.99..we got them for $60 because thats what our lodge owner paid a professional fisherman who was hawking them on his show at the time.."
1462035,81Saluki,2012-07-16 07:36:00,97,"Your post was timely. I've been fishing for various species from Southern Illinois to Ontario for 40 years and never really noticed any difference when the moon/tides influenced/increased the bite. Perhaps until now.I recently returned home from near Vermilion Bay. Whether it was the moon, or weather, or something else ... I don't know. But I caught more walleye in the days around the full moon. The attached pic shows the moon over our cabin (boathouse visible) on July 3rd as I came home from my honey hole across the lake. From the 1st to the 4th, the walleye seemed to be on a feeding frenzy at the same holes and same times each day. Before and after that, I had to hunt for a hole that produced 2+ catches. Hmmm.I'll be paying more attention to the moon/tide thing in the future and see if there really is a correlation.81Saluki"
1462346,fishincrazy,2012-07-16 19:26:00,1282,That is totally coll! 81 I will try to get a good picture of the full moon and keep track of the fish catching!FC
1464309,fishincrazy,2012-07-20 22:01:00,1282,TTT any more opinions on the moon and the bite????FC
1464408,Golden Eagle,2012-07-21 09:29:00,2642,"My wife and I were scheduled to fly in for the August 11 week, which includes a new moon. We were to be the only two guests in camp. When 8 others were booked for the same week I changed our trip to the August 18 week. Being alone on the lake trumps a stronger moon. We'll find fish.We'll see how it works for us."
1461192,5richards,2012-07-13 14:57:00,131,Man !!! Are you fired up or what!!!!! Here's hopin' that all goes well. What's this talk about a goat --- I always thought it was Sheep that some of you old Walleye fishermen took along!!!!! How'd the minnow drying go????
1461272,fishincrazy,2012-07-13 20:30:00,1282,I found out he has minnows for me and leeches and crawlers so I never dried any out.FC
1461340,octanehi5,2012-07-14 06:16:00,1104,The filets were seared on the outside and rare on the inside. have never burned them
1461399,fishincrazy,2012-07-14 09:26:00,1282,MMMMMMMMMMM Sounds awesome!!!FC
1461405,Terwalleye,2012-07-14 09:49:00,166,"I have always heard that most record fish are caught during full and new moon phases. I tried googling the topic and most of what I found was other fishing forums discussing the same. Ironically most of them started ""I heard...."" LOL. Now I am just spreading urban legend I guess. Anyone have a legit source for this theory? Great topic btw. I have always liked when our trip falls during the full or new moon; just because that is when the solunar charts are always fully erect."
1461407,tooski,2012-07-14 10:06:00,393,"""that is when the solunar charts are always fully erect."" Usually when I get home from a week of fishing."

1461817,btmbncr,2012-07-15 15:50:00,492,La Battes is the beer used during the goat sacrifice.It's best if you wear your fun underwear also. I have good walleye fishing during the middle of the day during full moon periods.I will be at Goose Bay during that time period.Bill
1461845,fishincrazy,2012-07-15 17:05:00,1282,That sounds about right Bill.We always fish throughout the day we have caught some of the biggest fish during the middle of the day.FC
1460844,fishincrazy,2012-07-12 16:40:00,1282,So I'm going North the last couple of day's of July and the first couple in August.The Full Moon is August 2nd Thursday the 6th night of my trip.Now I have always been told 3 day's before and 3 day's after are the best.Any thoughts on this?FC
1460853,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-12 17:11:00,1460,Strickly an omen of awesome fishing for your entire week. What else could it be?
1460871,btmbncr,2012-07-12 18:15:00,492,It helps the bite at that time to sacrifice a goat on a rock point during the moon rise.
1460951,fishincrazy,2012-07-12 21:33:00,1282,I'm thinking the 3 day's before till 3 day's after is a tidal water thing.I've got to get my sweet water lore and separate it from my salt water lore.I think.FC
1460952,fishincrazy,2012-07-12 21:34:00,1282,NICE!!!!I'll have to borrow a goat from one of my Mexican friends. FC
1460969,wallydave,2012-07-13 05:35:00,2151,Would the goat be considered live bait?? Which Canadian beer goes with sacrificial goat?
1460979,octanehi5,2012-07-13 06:15:00,1104,"The best beer to drink up north is Blue,Goat or not, The bite will slow up to the full moon then pick up after, weather and cold fronts still have a lot to do with it. We had the full moon in the middle of our trip last week. It did just what I stated. You will catch fish. How much is it to fly in the goat.We sacrificed a whole filet migon on the wood fire, with the blue of coarse"
1461039,downriverbob,2012-07-13 08:18:00,880,The full and the dark of the moon are typically the best fish periods. I usually schedule my LOTW vacation where I have a full moon involved. http://www.anglerguide.com/articles/522.html. As anything involving fishing weather is also going to effect things also. BOB
