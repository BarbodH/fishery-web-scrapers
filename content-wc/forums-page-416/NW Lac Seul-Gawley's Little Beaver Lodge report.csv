The weather was hot and calm most days probably making things a little tougher than normal, but my wife and I averaged around 50 fish a day. Her 25"" was the biggest of the trip. A couple mornings were relatively cooler with a chop producing our fastest action. We caught most of our fish in 12'-16' range, but fish were caught as shallow as 3' and down to 35.' We mostly fished a jig and minnow. This was my third trip to Lac Seul, but my first trip to the Ear Falls area. We could not have been happier with the accommodations at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge. Doug and Gail are very personable and happy to help you in any way possible. The cabins are modern and extremely clean. We fished out of our own boat which was landed at the resort. Free ice, electric on the docks, nice fish cleaning shack. It seems like a real bargain at $50 a night. We took a day trip to one of their daily fly ins and it delivered as advertised as we boated a ton of beautiful fish. We should have brought more bait! We will definitely be back. As always, a great time fishing in Ontario."

I can't say enough goood things about that place and the price is perfect. If you bring your own boats to the nw corner of lac seulo and don't try little beaver you are missing out. We have been going there for 7 years and we are headed up there august 5th for the week. Can't wait to feel that tap tap on the end of the old fenwick.....
