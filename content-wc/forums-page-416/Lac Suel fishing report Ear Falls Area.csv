1464264,Guest,2012-07-20 19:53:00,0,Last week some people were still catching fish in the river but never heard anyone going to sawmill. If it were me I'd head to Steamboat or Mckenzie Bay
1464265,NWwalleye,2012-07-20 19:55:00,223,out today .. water temps 74 - 76 degrees ..
1464278,rather-be-fishin,2012-07-20 20:26:00,429,Can you give more of a fishing report? We're headed up in one week to Lac Seul. Thanks! RBF.
1464289,NWwalleye,2012-07-20 20:55:00,223,Good fishing ... catching fish between 14 - 28 fow .. Lots of fish on the humps.. Wind was wild today and could only fish a few protected places ..
1464293,Guest,2012-07-20 21:03:00,0,"flyInOnH20 When you do all that running from Goose Bay to Mckenzie and further how much fuel were you burning in a day. I asume you have your own boat and didnt use a camp boat. I believe you were staying the same time my in-laws were there. Sounds like you did pretty good, I've been up there twice with them and it is a wonderful place. Just couldn't go this year to far and not enough time. Thanks, Left behind"
1464321,bigtimeelectric,2012-07-21 00:16:00,174,We bring our own gas and I have a 2025 pro v with a 225 and we run to mckenzie alot. we burn about 80 gallons a week in the boat.Ouch!!!
1464597,Guest,2012-07-21 22:00:00,0,Running to McKenzie bay I 'm guessing that I'm burning about 15 gallons per/day providing the weather is decent. If you put in @ the public boat ramp in Scout bay you can eliminate approx 8 miles of boating going to Mcenzie. If I'm heading past Poplar narrows it is worth launching there.
1461992,Guest,2012-07-16 04:42:00,0,"Just returned from 2 week of fishing Water temp main lake 76 degrees and shallow bays 82 degrees Water levels are back to ""normal"" Fuel prices in Ear Falls 1.39 p/ltr Spent most of the time in McKenzie where most of the bigger schools of fish were. Most days fished the 5-10' range. Did find them in the 15-20' a couple of days. Second week the fishing was better than the first week. Only had 1 day that produced over 100 fish. Pulled spinner rigs w/minnows. Throwing cranks for northerns produced a lot of walleye as well. The islands in Mckenzie had the best results for quality of walleye. Reefs held some fish but didn't hold much. Biggest walleye was 26.5"" Northern 34.5 Smallmouth 17"" Did fish Scout lake/bay. Caught more walleye than northerns. Manatoba Pt was good for northerns and walleye. Weather was warm and not much wind. A few isolated storms did pass thru on Thursday/Friday. Only got wet packing to leave. Can't wait till next year!"
1462058,bigtimeelectric,2012-07-16 08:35:00,174,Great report thanks for posting. Where did you stay? Did you fish steamboat at all? Heading up in a few weeks and finding it hard to concentrate. You should sign up on walleye central I see you are a frequent guest.... thanks again
1462105,WalleyeWally28,2012-07-16 10:06:00,298,"bigtimeelectricWhat dates are you going to be fishing LS? We will be there from Aug 4th to the 11th. I see on another thread that you will be staying at Gawleys. We stay at Whitewing, also about 5 miles south of Ear Falls."

1462430,Guest,2012-07-17 04:23:00,0,Did fish Steamboat 1 afternoon. Found some fish on the south shore @ the boulder/flat close to Farewell Bay. There were a couple of groups that fished Steamboat and had some success. Don't think they picked up the number of fish that I found down the lake based on conversations. We stayed @ Goosebay.
1463439,DMella,2012-07-19 08:05:00,32,I am staying on Perrault for a week upcoming and would like to day trip to Lac Suel. Where can we launch our boat?
1463453,greg2648,2012-07-19 08:34:00,80,There is a public launch site in the same bay as Fishermans Cove. There is signage on the road.
1463943,teddi,2012-07-20 06:04:00,349,be carefull parking at the landing. sometimes things happen.
1463970,mswope13,2012-07-20 07:11:00,73,"Teddi, do you have a water temp for Steamboat Narrows or Steamboat Bay? Do you know if fishing the sanctuary area or Sawmill Bay is producing? We are heading up this week."
1464260,Guest,2012-07-20 19:51:00,0,Main lake water temps when I left was 76-78 degrees. Found some higher temps in some of the shallow bays
