Live baits (crawlers/minnows) or cranks and spinners. Depths speed any suggestions would be good. Never tried trolling would like to try, deep diving cranks or tie them to a bottom bouncer?"

We use jigs 95% of the time so I can't help you on crankbaits. They will be on a fall pattern slide up to feed anywhere from 12- 25 fow with deep water close by, depths to 70 feet for rest. Will be in cabin 6 I believe the newer one right north of the lodge.wmd"
