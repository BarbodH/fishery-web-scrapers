1464551,adempsey,2012-07-21 19:41:00,963,Sounds like you did amazingly well even with the few days of bad weather! Nice to see that worms and Gulp performed almost as well as minnows. That's what I used most of the time. Whereabouts did you spend most of your time fishing?
1453850,Redear,2012-06-25 12:34:00,40,"Whats the word somebody from this form had to been there and back by now this year. Please post and let us know the fishing report.Were going the 13 of July,can't stand the wait.Thanks Fred"
1453892,Behle,2012-06-25 14:10:00,51,"Fred, Our group of 8 returned June 22nd. The weather played a big role in our fishing. It was very windy most days with a little rain for about three of them. We did catch several nice walleyes in our group with a 28 and 3/4 inch being the largest. We had trouble most days getting under the 18 inch limit for eaters. Most of the action centered around twin island, whitefish bay and a few near debbie island. Whitefish had many smaller in size with plenty of large ones thrown in. Twin had many of the larger fish.

1453975,adempsey,2012-06-25 17:08:00,963,"I am heading up this Friday, June 29th. I'll try to post a report when I get back, but I am headed out again the day after I return home so I might not have time before you leave."
1454113,donb,2012-06-25 21:41:00,13,"Going up July 6th for a week, staying over nite in White River then on to Hornepayne. Don't know what kind of spring the lake experienced hopefully, the fish flies are done by then. These last few days have been spent getting my stuff ready and counting the days. I'll post on my return how we did."
1455213,buckeyedan,2012-06-28 05:23:00,44,"Good luck, guys. My cousin and a few of his friends are flying in Saturday morning to Walton's. I'll pass along how they did when they get back. Behle - I remember a time when an 18 incher on that Lake was a darn nice fish. Now they are everywhere. I think we caught just as many over 18"" last year as under. I'm not a fish management expert by any means, but should we be concerned that we aren't catching as much young stock as we used to? It's great fishing for now, but what about 10-15 years down the road?"
1455764,Behle,2012-06-29 12:37:00,51,We have thought that as well. There were many small walleye in whitefish bay this year to make me think they are in the nursery type areas until they get larger. The river had many smaller ones as well.
1461268,buckeyedan,2012-07-13 20:26:00,44,"Any other updates from Nagagami? My cousin and his crew got back a week ago, and said the fishing was great as usual. Biggest walleye was 29"". The only thing that surprised me was they said they caught more fish in the middle of the day than in the morning or evening. It has always been my experience that you can catch them just about anytime if you know what you're doing, bit early morning and evenings were the prime times."
1461454,Mich_Fisherman,2012-07-14 13:19:00,292,"Fred, Good hearing from you. Good luck to you you and your crew...stay safe and watch for the OPP in Hornepayne!!Our group was there for the week starting June 29, through July 6th. Once again stayed at Expeditions North for another terrific week. We did well most days but it was very weather dependent as noted previously. We had some real windy days that made fishing a challenge to say the least. On those windy days where drifting or trying to stay vertical was tough, some of our group trolled using a 3-way rig with a crawler harness with a minnow on it. Control in the wind was tough but it did produce fish. Our most productive locations (although we didn't try a lot of places) were; the sunken island, the south west tip of twin islands, the Foch (at times), and fair success on the reefs north of Chuck's point. We had 2 additions to the group this year, one of which had made trips to Manitoba in the past and he was amazed by the size of the fish taken (even in the middle of the afternoon with 90 deg temps and the middle of the mayfly hatch). We also did well one afternoon trolling 1/4 oz hot-n-tots (when we ran out of minnows) catching a dozen fish rather quickly (we marked a lot of suspended fish that day). Trolling 1.5-1.7mph 70' back. Accommodations and equipment were awesome (color fish finders were a bonus to find fish) at Expeditions North with the mid week camp fish fry being the highlight . Thanks for that Dave! The biggest fish was 28 1/4 with numerous over 25""....also some big pike this year while fishing for Walleyes.Counting down the days until we return."

It probably would have been us if you weren't ahead of us.Quote: Originally Posted by Mich_FishermanAccommodations and equipment were awesome (color fish finders were a bonus to find fish) at Expeditions NorthColor fish finder!?!?! I didn't get no stinkin' color fish finder!We were also up there the same week as Mich_Fisherman. The fishing was quite good. Plenty of fish over 18"". I don't think the day was any better than the mornings or evenings, but it was as good most days. For us, once we found the fish we did well. Finding the fish wasn't always easy though. I think the next time we go back we will do amazingly well."
1461523,Mich_Fisherman,2012-07-14 18:15:00,292,"[QUOTE=adempsey;1461519]Ya, I couldn't believe that happened! Hope it turned out OK? It probably would have been us if you weren't ahead of us. Adam, other than the 45 min delay it wasn't too painful. He cut us some slack writing it only for 5kph over and $40. Could have been a lot worse. the delay was painful though.... seems the officer fat fingered Denny's license number and they couldn't find him in the database. They finally figured it out. The officer apologized for the lengthy delay, thanked us for patronizing the area and putting money into the economy. Color fish finder!?!?! I didn't get no stinkin' color fish finder! - Yah...Dave is in the process of updating the fleet with color fish finders. I think at least half of the boats have em. They were the ticket for sure for finding fish!!!"
