My father was told by another border official that the only way this non-sense with the constant strip search and finger prinitng each time he crosses is if the arresting guard removes it from the computer. That kind of action by the USA Customs sure makes me thinks twice about visiting over their."
1463454,Burr,2012-07-19 08:37:00,8612,"Must be easier the other direction. We had an employee go from US to Canada to oversee the teardown of a plant that was going to be rebuilt in the US, so the products could be sequenced. He was escourted to the border and told not to come back. No strip search though.I suppose one could do something like - I'll come to your fishing lodge and fish, relax, enjoy myself for the first week, and then work the second week, in the end for free. Then after the first week, well gee, I can't break the law, gotta head home."
1461639,GNO,2012-07-15 07:24:00,153,Maybe Jinx can chime in and clarify a few things.
1461687,Manitou,2012-07-15 09:28:00,125,"A temporary work visa can be issued.My American ""girlfriend"" came up here to live with me and was able to get one to teach at the school I where I worked. Temporary is the key here and the school would have been forced to hire a Canadian eventually.We got married, solved that little problem.If I tried to run a business by bartering work for accommodations I would be in trouble. But I would think a private individual having American friends stay at the guest cottage is a different thing. If those guests bang some nails or cut some grass to show their appreciation for the hospitality I doubt the Immigration department is going to show any interest.I have also worked with an American who was up here and tried to work illegally. I was playing bass for him in a blues band, and after two nights in this bar the Immigration boys showed up and ended the night early. His mistake was that he actually tried to get a work visa and was denied so he was on the radar."
1461754,nubote,2012-07-15 12:52:00,35,"As a Canadian, I work in the US all the time. But I'm working for a Canadian company, and getting paid by them. I would think it would be the same coming the other way."
1462661,Kmanster,2012-07-17 12:39:00,26,"Just put some poles out with bobers and worms. Have a frisbee, a football and a bag toss game set up. If they stop by, you can try and convince them that along with all the other games, you are playing ""Who can pound the most nails in an hour"" game. p.s. Now can we get this back to a reports board and other fishing related stuff plzzzzzz."
1462667,v-bay gord,2012-07-17 12:51:00,3168,"Maybe they don't consider driving a truck to be ""work"" ......."
1462675,Obabikon,2012-07-17 13:16:00,2370,"It's not my ""take"" on the issue. It's what immigration officers have told me/warned me. Maybe you should ask next time you cross the border. Deliveries might be a different issue all together. But, for a Canadian business to employ an American citizen... even if it's a barter system... they MUST have a work permit or landed immigrant status. Otherwise, you are breaking the law. I assure you, I'm not being ""unreliable"" or ""dangerous"". I would love to be able to employ my friends and family here. However, I am not. You're allowed to paint your own cottage. You're even allowed to have your friends and family paint your personal cabin. As that is not a business. A resort is not the same as a residence. A business can not employ (and it is employment, even if it's bartering) a worker without the correct documents. Again, I'm not stating any of this to be a jerk, or even tell people they shouldn't do it. I'm just stating it, so that they know going into it, that they could be breaking the law. Also, if your family friend asks you to come up and help him paint his cabin... by all means, do it. That'd be a great way to spend a week. However, working for a COMPANY is a very different situation. Also, just because you don't go to jail for breaking the law, doesn't mean you didn't break the law. There's millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. Many of them have jobs. They and their employers are breaking the law. (even if they don't get caught)"
1462734,4JawChuck,2012-07-17 15:45:00,277,"I had an American coworker come up here to do some installation assistance on a surgical light at a Canadian Hospital, we corresponded by email extensively to arrange equipment/parts/tools etc. He shipped his tools FedEx and flew the same day, he told immigration he was coming here for a holiday at my cabin. They had his blackberry and searched through it finding all our correspondence,,,he was sent back and came back the next day after getting a temp work visa. I was interviewed as well, luckily I played dumb and just said I was there to pick him up. What was even stranger was the immigration officers sister worked as a nurse at the hospital we were going to work at, he contacted her for info and even the hospital administrator to verify reality. If I had attempted the same thing going the other way across the border I have no doubt I would have been arrested and charged, worst thing that's going to happen to you coming to Canada is sending you back. Truck Drivers are exempt from this type of situation under a different set of laws, they are not comparable to tradesmen or other workers due to the free trade arrangement that covers the movement of goods across the border."
1462742,tooski,2012-07-17 16:07:00,393,"""searched through it finding all our correspondence"" Kind of curious as to how you could have ""just played dumb""."
1462821,4JawChuck,2012-07-17 19:39:00,277,"At that point I had no idea he had been detained, I was standing in the airport at customs and he was a no show...when I went to customs to ask his whereabouts when they questioned me. What would you have done? I only found out details when he arrived back in Chicago and returned my calls, all they told me at customs is he was being sent back. I'm sure I am in some database somewhere with photos alongside other known terrorists trying to smuggle Americans into the country...you know how dangerous these type of people are."
1462948,rwl,2012-07-18 07:35:00,1655,"I've been to and send other employees to Canada all the time for work. Flying in with tools usually Toronto or Montreal. No problems at all, no work visa. The only thing we've ever been required to have is a letter from the company we are going to work for, Kraft, Frito-lay Canada, SC Johnson etc. requesting our presence. Its usually for 2-3 days at a time."
1461224,Rich B,2012-07-13 17:45:00,1081,"So because you own your camp, and if you have good friends come up north of the border and over a day or two or so help paint an outside of a cabin or whatever; that's illegal work ? I would understand if YOU owned a painting company and had been hired to do painting/staining work at the camp, but a friend helping out someone who owns a business as a favor seems harsh to me. I don't think you're ""wrong"" as you stated, as you looked into this with the Ontario (or Canadian Gov) but the situation itself just appears wrong. Is the situation different if a Canadian citizen/friend comes out to your camp and helps paint a cabin or two for free because they are your friend and live north of the border ? If so, would it matter what Province they were a citizen of ? Interesting.....and by the way, I enjoy reading your fishing reports. Rich"
1461234,GNO,2012-07-13 18:11:00,153,"It works the same way on both sides of the border. Must be a citizen or have a work permit from the country you are going to work. Province to provine is ok, just like working from state to state. Obabikan is just stating the rules as they are wrote. Will you get caught, probably not, but better to know exactly what the law is and make your decision from there."
1461241,Obabikon,2012-07-13 18:42:00,2370,"Rich, I have two older brothers who were raised on the island. I was told by an immigration officer that they're not allowed to even answer a telephone. The idea is that a company should be using the Canadian work force to fill these jobs. If you wanted a cabin painted, and you didn't want to do it yourself, then hire a Canadian to do it. Same's true for answering phone calls, and work as a carpenter or an electrician is probably even a bigger deal.http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/03...arter0306.html Bartering in Canada is legal, however, it's also taxable. So, any value gained must be reported and tax paid. I'm not sure the government hunts people down, but they also want their piece of the action (so to speak)."

1461336,Shellback,2012-07-14 05:50:00,8083,I wish it worked that way on both sides of the border! Unfortunately in the US we have too many people employing illegals.

1461349,Guest,2012-07-14 06:56:00,0,"Are you kidding me, if you even mention the word ""Work"" to the US Border Officials going into the US you will be ""Arrested On The Spot""!!! This happened to my father, he was sent from his employer in Toronto to go to another plant in Carolina to oversee some equipment instal for a week and he made the mistake of telling the border officials he was going there to work. Arrested, strip searched, finger printed and now he requires a waiver to cross the border to the USA.... What a joke, here is an engineer 64yrs. old, no record at all and that happens. He now has a waiver good for 5 yrs. but each time he crosses to the USA for whatever reason he get the same old strip search, finger printing photo's etc...etc... Think again about having anything to do at all with working on either side if your not a citizen."
1461387,Guest,2012-07-14 08:43:00,0,"From my personal experience. I drove into Ontario to visit a manufacturing plant that was building some RADAR equipment for the US Government. I assure you that I was working. Spent over two weeks there, in fact. Never was I required to get a work permit and I got paid for my work. The guys at the boarder never said a word about all the tools I was carrying in the tool trailer either and I told them what I would be doing when they asked too. Not a peep. Just a pleasant ""Enjoy your stay""."
1461402,Terwalleye,2012-07-14 09:34:00,166,****! And I thought we had Big Brother watching over US.
1461628,Guest,2012-07-15 06:59:00,0,"Hey. I drive a big rig in Canada all the time for a paint supplier to the auto industry. I cross the boarder sometimes 3 days a week. Never had a ""work permit"". If all this work permit banter were true you'd think I'd have to drop off the trailer after crossing or be in prison already. Typical message board know it alls spewing only enough information to be unreliable and/or dangerous. Obab's take is nonsense because as with many posters it is over the top and not applicable to many many situations. I painted my cottage last year on the north shore of Lake Erie. My wife and her 2 brothers helped me. Nobody went to jail or got deported. Amazing, eh? They even brought their own paint brushes from......shhh......PA."

1460860,Obabikon,2012-07-12 17:35:00,2370,"As long as they're Canadian citizens or have work permits. If not, it would be illegal to do, and I'd caution anyone interested in taking him up on it. If you're caught illegally working in Canada (even if you're not being paid, it's deemed work) there can be some pretty stiff penalties."
1460885,4JawChuck,2012-07-12 19:02:00,277,"You can get a work permit in a very short period, the problem only comes up if you try to come up here on a ""vacation"" and try to work...they will search your phone and emails and call references to verify why your coming here."
1460978,v-bay gord,2012-07-13 06:10:00,3168,Very true. Unless you are a Canadian WC member you might be out of luck.
1460991,fishinnut 3446,2012-07-13 06:47:00,638,So if I were to do some so callled work trade I could and would have to get a work permit?the lodge where I stay ask me to bring my gutter truck to do all the cabin and stay 2 weeks.
1461042,tooski,2012-07-13 08:25:00,393,"Fishinut, Don't even consider taking your work truck across without a permit. A few years back my outfitter needed some major work done on two of his outposts. He suggested a work for free weeks type deal but told me I couldn't bring my tools across. Nor did he want me calling or e-mailing re: the offer. I declined. I think the government takes that issue very seriously."
1461059,Ogoki,2012-07-13 09:08:00,291,"Correct me if I am wrong , but the USA does not protect their jobs that way . I spoke with a farmer that I know and he said he was trying to hire farm help for manual labor . He was told he had to advertise the jobs a certain amount of time and then he could hire ""outside "" help . He told me of another farmer down the road who did not go thru the red tape and hired ""outside "" help and paid them cash . So we ""must"" have some laws on the books for this but they are not always followed . Last year I took my service truck and cargo trailer on my bear hunt . Unloade 95 % of my tools and parts as I thought this may come up . It did not as not one question was asked about the contents of my truck . I did not want any issues ,so I was covered . Only took my service truck as to save my ""good"" truck as I was going to be driving many ,many miles on gravel roads ."
1461136,Guest,2012-07-13 12:16:00,0,"So you are saying you can't work for free. I can't help my grandma rake leaves in her yard, I can't empty the trash for a friend, nor can I help a friend paint their house? What kind of stiff penalties can I expect for these infractions? You must be a legal expert."

1461212,Obabikon,2012-07-13 16:30:00,2370,"Wow man... I guess me owning a resort in Canada, and having asked government officials about this specifically makes me some kind of bad guy? I was simply warning anyone who might be interested in this. It is illegal to ""work for free"". Sure, you can go help your grandma rake her leaves, but not if she owns a leaf raking business. See the difference? I've had a TON of friends and family offer to come up and work at the camp for free. But, it's illegal, and I tell them that. Also, good luck on getting the work permits. They aren't easy to land. The resort would need to prove that no Canadian citizen or landed immigrant is capable of filling the position."
