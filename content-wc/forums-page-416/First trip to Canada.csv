1464364,new hips,2012-07-21 07:37:00,498,"Not really, that's why the Lindy rig was such a hit when it came out. It tends to bounce over most rocks. With the upward bend in the walking sinker. Most people get snagged because they are not watching there locator and are dragging the rig instead of just nicking the bottom."

1457901,Guest,2012-07-05 07:33:00,0,I'm from Missouri. I have been youtube'n a ton of musky and pike video's. I can't wait!
1457910,Pezman38,2012-07-05 07:51:00,3196,"CMA, Get some nice rainwear, I have had a blast catching eyes in pouring rain thanks to my bimini top and raingear. The rain turns the fish on!"
1457979,DaBullz,2012-07-05 10:43:00,12,"Well, be prepared to have the trip of a lifetime! I've fished Lac Seul 5 times so far - my first trip was 4 years ago. I'm a novice fisherman, so please take the following advice accordingly. The very first words I have to say are that of caution. Lac Seul is big water - I've been lost on it, and that ain't no joke. It's also not a natural body of water. What you have heard, perhaps, about Canadian lakes being filled with rocks is doubly true of Lac Seul. You have to be careful. I would suggest, strongly, that you get the Navionics chip that has Lac Seul on it. Personally, I have it installed on my iPhone and it works like a charm. On the chip map, the primary obstacles are marked, but not, by any stretch, are all of them marked. Be especially careful around islands - so many barely submerged rocks - scares the **** out of me. The first 3 trips, I used a guide for a couple of days. I'd highly suggest it. While marking fishing spots with a GPS is an obvious use, the primary reason I used a guide was for safety. I marked a track used by the guide and I continue to use that very same track when I cross the water. Gives me peace of mind. While fishing for anything but walleye on Lac Seul strikes me the same as ordering a hamburger at a high end steak house, to each their own. If you are fishing the NW section of Lac Seul, you won't run into musky, but certainly will catch voluminous amounts of pike, even if you are fishing strictly for walleye. I haven't sought out smallies, but catch 'em too while fishing for 'eyes. However, I do know there is a healthy population of smallies at Lac Seul. Beyond that, with the stained water, you will catch 'eyes all day long. Finding them on Lac Seul is no different than finding fish anywhere, just probably easier. If you ain't catching anything, move along, find some structure, and have at it. In August, the fish will be deep and likely in the main body of water. There are massive sand bars, and I mean massive, find one of those and work the slopes. Good times to be had for sure. As a novice, I stick with vertical jigging, 1/4 - 3/8 jig with some meat on it. Switch it up, have the option of at least minnows and leeches, bring some crawlers too. If one ain't workin', try the next. Enjoy!"
1457985,DaBullz,2012-07-05 10:51:00,12,"Couple of other notes:Don't 'eff around at the border. Declare everything, hide nothing, and be courteous and direct. I got strip searched the first time up - doin' the bend and cough for the Mounties is no way to start a trip, trust me.Don't bring anyone up who has a DUI conviction - they won't make it through. Heck, any conviction of substance beyond petty misdemeanors will likely result in getting turned back. I believe there is a recent thread on here about the sort of crimes that will keep you out of Canada.Don't mess around on the water. Can't fish with 2 poles simultaneously - another lesson found out the hard way. No booze on the water. Keep in mind Canadians are very nice, but otherwise tolerate Americans as a necessary evil. Sticklers for the rules, don't break 'em, don't be the kind of American that foreigners love to hate."
1457987,Pikeslayer8,2012-07-05 10:53:00,1460,"DaBullz gave great advise for a newcomer to Lac Seul, but this statement is an ESPN Instant Classic."

Not that the others didn't give sound info, but this is what i'm seeking. won't mess around on the boarder and the others I'm going with have been several times before so i should be in good hands navigation wise, but the iphone app is a goo idea. i hope i get to experience a big fish. i can't wait to see the difference between a big catfish and a musky/pike."

1464068,bigdaddyguns,2012-07-20 11:20:00,608,For those that use bottom bouncers what is your rule of thumb for bringing up extras? It is my first trip and am wondering how many to bring along.
1464172,new hips,2012-07-20 15:32:00,498,"That's a great question, a lot of factors.........1.generally, if fishing in less than 25ft of water, it is very snag infested, keep it as vertical as possible, I use a baitcast for bouncing, always open bail with just your thumb holding it. watch your locator at all times and adjust accordingly. 2. generally deep water is smooth with occasional rock less likely to get snagged.3. when trolling........if snagged....release more line then give it a good pop with the rod tip, many times it comes free.4. If you use bouncers all day........expect to lose at least 1-2 easy5. I take extra stainless wire along and make more if needed, For weight I use a egg sinker usually 1.5oz to 2oz so that the sinker will just pop off not the entire rig. 3oz for 40ft and deeper.6. A lot of times, it's your snell that gets snagged, you can use a floater to insure it off the bottom.7. Now, I generally use a lindy rig instead, more snag resistant with the walking sinker."
1456711,Guest,2012-07-02 11:49:00,0,"Looks like I am making my first trip to Canada (Lac Seul) the first week of August. I have been pouring over websites and spending a lot of time trying to find the right lures and equipment. I bass (large mouth)fish a lot, but want to make sure I'm prepared for this trip. Is fishing for Northerns, Musky, Smallies any different? Technique? Lures? Time of day? Any tips you can give this noob would be greatly appreciated."
1456717,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-07-02 11:58:00,235,"Your largemouth skills will be somewhat transferrable to the bass and pike fishing, but walleye are a bit different. You probably won't have much luck casting tight to shore this time of year for smallies, unless there is a real steep rocky drop off right on the shoreline. Find the ledges and humps beneath the surface and start there. Recommended north country smallmouth lures:Senkos (can be weightless or with some weight depending on wind and depth)Double Tail Hula Grub (with Slider Head snagless jig, 1/4oz or 1/8 oxJig/Twister TailCrankbaitsPoppers for topwaterLeeches for live baitThere are many other things that can work, but that is what I've had success with"
1456718,bigtimeelectric,2012-07-02 11:59:00,174,where on Lac seul?
1456725,Guest,2012-07-02 12:21:00,0,"from what i have been told we will be floating on a house boat, no specific lodge or area"
1457451,unclejoe,2012-07-04 06:19:00,22,Will park houseboat around Taylor island area.
1457651,Gary from Iowa,2012-07-04 12:22:00,74,"Smallmouth Bass also like night crawlers. If you find the bass just a piece of worm on the hook is sufficient. BTW, don't put parts of a worm back in with the rest. Also be sure to keep the worms cool. I use a foam worm box with a frozen gel back in an appropriate sized cooler. Leeches can be harder to get later in the summer and are not always in the best of condition. Read up on leech care too. If using minnows use care in keeping them aerated.A good depth finder with a gps is good. You might be able to get one with a SD chip for the lake you are fishing. If you are not up to speed on the technology your head will be spinning and the cost substantial. I think you could get by with a modest priced depth finder without a gps, if you have a handheld gps to mark your path to and from the resort and to mark your hotspots. Also get a good paper map or laminated map. You can see more of the lake and get a better perspective of where you are. I suggest an old fashioned compass as a backup. Again know how to use it. Canadian lakes can be so deceptive. Your boat can be sitting in 50 feet of water and right next to it can be a reef covered with a few inches of water. You want to be very observant and not go too fast in unfamiliar waters. Its very easy to lose the lower unit of your outboard or houseboat if you make a mistake.The fish may be fairly deep in August so you may need deep diving crankbaits. You may be trolling these and other lures in order to find fish. So brush up of trolling techniques. Also read up on bottom bouncing. Bottom bouncing allows you to cover more water and reduces the frequency of hang ups when you are looking for walleye. If your fishing with snells, consider bringing a pool noodle. A pool noodle is often used by little kids when in the swimming pool for support and as a toy. The pool noodle is closed cell. You can cut pieces off of it and cover hooks on crankbaits, spoons, spinners, etc. I like to hook a jig into a pool noodle, wrap the snell around the noodle and peg the snell's loop with a golf tee.I bring sidecutters and a mini bolt cutter with me. Some of the crankbaits have hooks that sidecutter won't cut. The last time I was in Canada a little northern drove the barb of a treble hook through the skin on web of my thumb. My brother was able to use the mini bolt cutter to cut the barb off and then remove the remainder of the hook. Also look for a hook removal kit and directions for same.If fishing is really slow, just sit back and watch the loons, moose. I even have reading material on hand. Drift fishing can be fun too, but remember to be careful when you run the boat. If you drink don't do it in the fishing boat or even when you stop for shore lunch. Save your drinking for your residential quarters.Good luckGary"
1457660,new hips,2012-07-04 12:45:00,498,"CMA14, we fished Lac Seul for about 5 years....best walleye fishing anywhere. Watch your slot fish, we've been stopped a few times, pinch the tail and get a accurate measurement. Fish should be deep, 25-40ft, look for any mid lake reefs, or mega sand structures. You can keep it simple by using a bottom bouncer 2oz, or a lindy rig 1.5oz with a 36in snell, with plain hook or floating jighead. Little joe spinners with gold blades are also good. You will catch more big fish then small believe me. Try to find some weeds, with deep water nearby for the Northern, spoons and swimbaits work very well, always fish the wind side..........and between islands if the wind is blowing thru them. If you are anywhere near, fish Klieners Point, always full of big fish, you will have company though.......It's a walleye factory. Also check out Silver Wheel Lodge weekly fishing reports, very detailed advise."
1457664,Bill Krejca,2012-07-04 12:58:00,6107,"All the above advice is good. Regarding hooks in the hand: most of the hooks I have removed from my friends over the years have been caused during the unhooking/release attempt of small pike. I always have pliers close to me. Always. Before even thinking of touching the northern, pliers grip tightly the hook which is embedded in the fish, then grab the fish around the closed gills and proceed with the release process. Do not pay attention to the actions of some TV folks who seemingly like to man their way through the release process with their fingers. I also just shudder when I see a picture pose with the bait still in the mouth, too easy to create a tandem hooking. (I know the bait looks great for the picture, but, anyway.) Get a spring open heavy wire mouth opener for those situations where the hooks are buried in the pike's throat - grab the fish first in this situation. Good luck, you'll have a ball, give us a report when you return. Bill Krejca"
