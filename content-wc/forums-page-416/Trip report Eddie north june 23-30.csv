1460122,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-10 19:59:00,101,"Hey Rocko, Ebait is good, another good one for reapers is http://www.guideschoiceproshop.com/ and for Don Iovino reapers, try Tackle Warehouse. A great quality jig head for the reapers (but a little pricey) is http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Warba...age-WBSSJ.html. The way I justify it is I use good heavy line and terminal so I am not throwing them in the lake for keeps all the time. I am heading back to Eddie 2nd week of June next year as well. Cheers WW"
1462844,adempsey,2012-07-17 20:22:00,963,I came across this photo taken on Windsor Lake on the net. I wonder if this will be the new camp?? The lake looks like a great lake to fish. One of these days I will make it up there...
1462847,unclepaully,2012-07-17 20:31:00,112,I'm guessing its the camp that was owned by northern outposts. If you do a search on here a few people have fished it. From the reports I've read it sounds like a good lake.
1462873,EddieNorth,2012-07-17 21:15:00,32,"Hi guys,Beteau lake was last run by a guy out of Wisconson until 2001, we took it over in 2009, I was told his name was Carl Sailing.Before him there was a guy by the name of Ivey that ran a few moose hunts up here.Northern outposts never did run Beteau Lake they ran BlackBirch and Windsor lakes but have recently terminated their lease agreement,We are now running Beteau lake,Richter lake,Blackbirch lake and Windsor lake along with a small moose hunting lake north of the Ogoki River called Box lake.BlackBirch and Windsor lakes will not be opened for a year or two because of all the work and equipment they need.Cheers everyone I hope your having a great season fishing,Eddie"
1462994,Mike Borger,2012-07-18 08:52:00,1554,"Wow, that's exciting news. I'd love to fish Windsor and Blackbirch.Sign me up!"
1462999,Larry S,2012-07-18 09:02:00,665,I have fished Windsor lake in 2006 & Blackbirch in 2008 with Northern Outposts. Both are excellent for Pike & Walleye It looks like Ryan & Kathy Brady are getting out of the outpost business as they only have one camp at Keezik Lake
1463003,rocko0305,2012-07-18 09:03:00,138,"Larry, I am just curious. Did you prefer one lake more versus the other? Which had more pike and the biggest pike would you say? Thanks."
1463125,Larry S,2012-07-18 13:16:00,665,"Rocko,At Blackbirch you had another lake Missatin(Not sure of spelling) to fish. We caught lots of good sized eyes and a few larger pike. The weather that week(2nd week of June) was cold and stormy all week At Windsor,also 2nd week of June,weather except for one day was fine We caught more pike there. Also windsor is a lot bigger lake than Blackbirch If you go to Walleye Central archives reports on both trips are listed under my name Larry S"

1457855,Mike Borger,2012-07-05 04:17:00,1554,Eddie sent me a video clip of the groundhog last week. The darn thing comes when he whistles and he feeds it carrots right out of his hand LOL!Just amazing.
1457866,deputy dog,2012-07-05 05:39:00,305,"We were feeding it crackers out of our hands, she had bout 5 pups so they gonna b there for a while.....sorry no pics"
1458002,pegasis0066,2012-07-05 11:16:00,64,I can assume you've never had moose.
1458003,deputy dog,2012-07-05 11:19:00,305,"No just venison....similar but tad better I believe! And the steaks are HUGE by comparison, which is a good thing"
1458193,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-05 18:40:00,101,"Too funny Mike, I saw that video of Eddie feeding the GH carrots, must be putting on a show as he was feeding it cookies when I was up!Either way it was a blast to watch Eddie whistle for his new pet and it would come a running."
1459601,EddieNorth,2012-07-09 14:56:00,32,"Worst year for mosquitos I have ever seen,brought in a small fogger for the camp,,,,,,,,problm solved."
1459638,deputy dog,2012-07-09 16:12:00,305,"the ""green"" campfires you and craig had going worked great......old indian trick?"
1459666,lassh,2012-07-09 17:30:00,553,"Hey Eddie, Phish knows where you can get a bunch of bats to eat the mosquitos!"
1459755,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-09 20:53:00,101,Gives new meaning to BYOBâ€¦have a spare pint!
1459858,rocko0305,2012-07-10 07:23:00,138,"I have a question for all of you guys who have been to Eddie North's on Beteau. Where do you guys buy your 8"" or 10"" reaper tails to use for follow ups from the Northerns? I typically shop at BPS, Cabela's and Gander Mtn., and I don't see them in the store or on the websites. The only place I have found them are on ebay or a site called ebait.com I believe. Heading to Beteau from May 25 - June 1, 2013. Thanks."
1457401,deputy dog,2012-07-03 21:21:00,305,"water levels were about 3 feet higher than normal pool which was 6 feet low last year when we went the 9 foot difference made for a totally different lake. mosquitos were the worst we have ever experienced in all of our trips north. we all bought nets that cover the beds and they were a life saver! did get to use a therma cell for the first time and they work GREAT!!! between the nets, therma cell, and coils we were able to ""tame"" the skeeters. black flies were also out but not nearly as bad as skeeters. weather was cool and stable for the first 2 days and the fish were pretty predictable. tues-thurs was warm and sunny and once we patterned the fish they came fairly easy. with the water up into the bushes casting crank baits into the shore produced the best. trolling the channels also produced walleyes and some smaller 30' pike. points off islands worked later in the week as a cold front passed through slowing things down a bit. in all, no real huge walleye but many, many eaters. largest pike for the week was a fat healthy 41"" with many in the mid to upper 30""s. Eddie was great, as always, and even grilled up some moose tenderloin for the group. it was surprisingly tender and tasty. i even scored some to bring home for a Steeler game cookout we do during the season. nakina air is an impressive operation that runs very smoothly, just stand back and watch them do their thing. spent the night before at pennock's and it was in town and comfortable for $30 a man. breakfast before the flight in and lunch after the flight out at the train station in nakina was great. in all, another very memorable trip with a great outfitter that really goes the extra mile to make your trip as good as it can be. booked for may 18, ice out, next year and am already counting down! saw black bear cub on the drive up and one small bull moose out in a bay duing the trip as well. GREAT TRIP!!!!"
1457434,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-04 04:22:00,223,Sounds like you had a great trip i have never heard of anyone having a bad trip with eddie. Them skeeters can be bad large enough to carry you away. As always sounds like eddie is eddie what a great guy to work with. Was up there last aug when the water levels were way down could only fish about 4 miles of the river and lake but best fishing my group has ever had. Hope to return next year in the spring.
1457500,lassh,2012-07-04 07:39:00,553,Thanks for report. We're headed up in 3 weeks for 1st time. Glad to hear you held your own against the skeeters. I sent you a PM. Cheers
1457515,deputy dog,2012-07-04 07:59:00,305,"fishing was actually easier last year with the lower levels having the fish condensed into the deeper pools, a normal pool trip should allow for more predictable patterns...laash pm back"
1457554,Mike Borger,2012-07-04 09:02:00,1554,"Glad you had a good trip. That's quite a difference in water levels, wow!What's with the netting over the bunk thing? In my experience all of the sleep cabins at Eddie's are pretty tight, no bugs can sneak in.I know you always tend to get a few following you in and out though.What I've always done is bring a can of indoor raid and spray the cabin 10 mins before hitting the sack.Works like a charm and also avoids needlessly breathing in mosquito coil smoke all night."
1457557,Mike Borger,2012-07-04 09:05:00,1554,One thing I've been bringing recently on my fly ins is a 10X10 screen tent. Very inexpensive and weighs about 10lb's.In the evening when the bugs are fierce and the cabin is too hot it's worth its weight in gold when you want to relax outside with a drink.
1457587,5 of Diamonds,2012-07-04 09:43:00,151,Thanks to all for posting about Eddie's. We'll be heading there next June for the first time. Keep the trip feedback coming. I didn't notice but were you on Beteau or Richter?
1457625,tooski,2012-07-04 11:16:00,393,Does Eddie still have Richter?
1457650,deputy dog,2012-07-04 12:18:00,305,"we went to beteau again, yes he still has richter but it's mainly a walleye lake. he also is acquiring the outfitting rights to windsor lake to the north for 2014, hopefully. solo, we found these nets at cabelas and the are nets with grommets that hook into hooks you screw into the rafters that hang to the floor. we believe the skeeters were coming in through the ridge vents and the cabin was full by morning. one of the guys in our group has major issues with leaving coils burning overnight but with the nets they couldn't get to us. we will NEVER head north without these again! 9' swing in the water really made it a whole new lake for us to learn this year but that is what fishing is about!!"
1457833,Walleye Wanderer,2012-07-04 21:28:00,101,"Glad the skeeters didn't slow you down Deputy, sounds like another great trip any pictures? Your sure that was moose Eddie fed you, he cooked some up for us and I never saw the groundhog again LMAO. The water levels have been way down and this year way up, so you gotta believe 2013 is gonna be just right. Cheers"
