5546674,kona77,2017-05-15 19:35:00,236,Scott- Have only gone thru one check station in 20+ trips. We never bring fish across the border so it was just the inconvenience of being stopped and checked. Best of luck on your trip to Action Lake.
5548274,jambi,2017-05-16 11:58:00,504,Thanks Gene! No big deal for us we have never brought home a fish in 16 trips. Safe travels and have a great time.
5541025,jambi,2017-05-13 09:04:00,504,I've seen fish check stations mentioned on here many times. I've been to Canada a bunch but have never seen a check station. Are they pulling over every vehicle? Do I need to stop if I haven't been fishing yet? I'd default to pulling over to be safe. Northbound in 11 days.
5541065,pjshorthorn,2017-05-13 09:25:00,5654,"in my experience, most vehicles are going to be pulled over if your are towing a boat or traveling with a group that is pulling a boat. If there is ample room and traffic volume is low, officers will pull over every vehicle on a stretch of road where they are set up. Normally, a CO is directing vehicles to pull over when they want them to be inspected with signage set up in advance of the inspection area. PjShorthorn"
5541169,tandm,2017-05-13 10:14:00,679,"I've been pulled over twice. First time no boat, but was on a logging road coming from a fishing lodge. Second time was just North of International Falls at a check station that had been set up. The CO directed all boat pullers over . He talked to car drivers and directed some to pull over, some to go on thru . I assume he was asking them where they were coming from, etc. both times, they checked licenses, fish per license, and identification and size of fillets.So, always pack your fish cooler where it is readily accessible, leave a little skin on fish , and package each fish individually , so it can be counted and examined. Also, make sure each person's fish is in the same vehicle as that person. Do those things, and the guys are great to work with."
5541225,Bill Krejca,2017-05-13 10:52:00,6107,"Not to worry about knowing where/when to pull over, you'll get help! Officials have even been known to request your company at the end of the lodge's drive.Bill"

5542825,packpro,2017-05-14 09:46:00,695,X2. Perfect. If you make their job easy you will notice a different demeanor. Stopped on 502 once. MNR could not have been nicer. Buttoned up Mountie with a dog liked himself.......a lot. Licenses and cooler easily accessible speeds up the process.
5543585,HeHooksHimself,2017-05-14 15:27:00,725,"I have told this story before, but it is worth repeating and it is a story that I tell a lot. (At my age, I have a lot of stories....) A group of four leaving after opening week. We were very careful about counting the fish in the freezer, and I personally was in charge of making sure we were legal. We had a few bass and a few pike, but our main concern was walleye, since that is the fish God intended us to eat (bite size flakes of deliciousness) Sure enough, on the pulp check pulloff about 20k from FF, they are checking everyone. No problem, remember, I carefully counted the fillets myself. The officer asks us a few questions and asks to see the cooler. No problem. remember, I carefully counted the fillets myself. We are enjoying our last cigar in Canada and joking and smoking when the officer comes up to me and says, ""I keep coming up with 17 fillets!"" ""Couldn't be,"" I said. (Remember, i had carefully counted the fillets myself) He says, ""You count them with me."" Sure enough, there was 17. The once solidly frozen mound of baggies had melted a little and now they were much easier to count. I explained to him how we are very aware of the rules and respect the rules since we know that is why fishing in Canada is so great. He says, ""This is obviously just a mistake. If you were five over, I would take everything you own, but since you are only one over and made a mistake, I am only going to issue you a citation. Who wants to take responsibility for the extra fish?"" At this time, my companions became very interested in the dandelions around the area and it appeared they did not hear or understand the question. ""Well, it is my truck and I was responsible for counting the fish, so I guess it is me,"" I said. He said, ""This is like a ticket, but unfortunately, nothing is cheap in Ontario."" I was given the citation for $240 CDN. Everyone agreed that I would just get the total tax refund, which that year, for some reason, the Canadian government decided would be just $60 CDN. He also took four fillets and left us 13, for some reason. I never did quite get the math. The only good thing about this experience is that I never have to be responsible for counting fillets any more. FISH ON! Hooks. We leave in four days!"
5544794,jambi,2017-05-15 06:56:00,504,Thanks for all the replies and sharing your experiences. Safe travels everyone!
5545050,LOW1,2017-05-15 08:15:00,2828,"It's wise to remember that the Canadian officials (OPP, border , MNR, etc) are just doing their job. Treat them with respect and courtesy, know and comply with the law, don't be a jerk or smart alec, and use common sense and you will get along splendidly. My experience with check stations is that if you have a USA license plate you are likely to be checked."
5546138,stumcfar,2017-05-15 15:00:00,451,"This will jinx me, I know, but in nearly 25 trips to Lac Seul or Clay Lake, we have never seen a check station."
