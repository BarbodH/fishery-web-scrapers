I usually take 2 or 3 of everything, I been going about 23 years so I know what will get you in trouble Foe ever boat,we have a spare motor in the front seat. That has saved us numerous headache s .We also take two gas tanks with their rubber hoses, ALL THAT SAID WE HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES that pushed our limits, but we always HAD A BLAST"
5549698,dschiebel,2017-05-17 04:13:00,85,"Opening morning is nice every body is excited tricks are played all the time, Try removing the prop of you buddy's boat. Get going before they get in their boat, Go out about 100 yards when they start yelling about their no Prop tell him you have an extra for the proper money, At then end you can give him back the money a tell him you found the prop in the boat house under a big sign that stated PROP>"
5551946,Catman59,2017-05-18 04:52:00,345,I always carry a spare and leave a spare in the truck at camp. Ive used my spare more than once but then I fish Sturgeon Lake !!!!
5534417,pjshorthorn,2017-05-10 08:34:00,5654,"I bought a spare aluminum prop that had been refurbished. A lot less costly investment for a backup prop. Never had to use it, but everything was in the boat in case I made a critical navigational error. Now I just ruin props and transducers on camp boats PjShorthorn"
5534649,fishmanric,2017-05-10 09:24:00,219,I have first hand experience on this issue. Do you want to keep fishing or take a long drive to get a prop? I've had to drive to Sioux Lookout a number of times to get a new prop. And the expense of it all.
5545162,Hunts1,2017-05-15 09:05:00,123,I always take one and have had to use. It is a small investment that if you need it you will be very happy to have it. If you don't use it you always have it for the next trip.
5546538,West Newton River Rat,2017-05-15 18:24:00,128,After bending two blades on a log I had a 7 mile idle back to the resort and spent the rest of the day running around looking for a prop. I ended up buying a prop that fit but was the wrong pitch as that was all I could find. I take 2 extra props now!!
5546578,Hunts1,2017-05-15 18:42:00,123,"Also, I would get an aluminum prop. Stainless steel props on Lac Seul are probably a bit of a liability. I want my prop to break before my lower unit internals blowup. I only use aluminum props up there."
5546810,Further North,2017-05-15 20:19:00,2008,"One in the boat, another in the car back at the boat launch.Never had to use either, yet....but the first time I went to Canada, the guys in cabin just downhill from us broke one blade off a prop on Monday, bend all three blades on another prop on Wednesday and wrecked a lower unit on Friday.It made an impression on me..."
5547330,Wedge,2017-05-16 06:38:00,270,"Yea, the impression was ""PAY ATTENTION!"" You guys convinced me. I ended up calling my dealer and he has a used prop he is just going to give me. Pitch probably wont be perfect, but it will be good enough in an emergency."
5547714,fishinnut 3446,2017-05-16 08:46:00,638,"Same here, I know Gord has boats on Clearwater for his guests but I stay at Birch Dale. I've taken my boat down there once and bent the chit out of the prop and cracked the cavition plate from a beaver log that got wedged in between plate/prop ! Now when I go down there we rent a camp boat and last yr. before heading down there we got a boat that already had some prop damage but had all 3 blades,we came back and had 1 folded over and missing about half of the other 2 but we made it down there in about 20 mins.and got our limit of Lakers !"
5547890,3M TA3,2017-05-16 09:37:00,2846,"Reading this made me laugh thinking about my BIL who doesn't bring a spare. He starts out on his Canadian trip with a new 14""+ prop and a week later I swear it's only about 9 inches in dia. I have one with me no matter where I go. Haven't used one in over 40 years, but I have it....just in case."
5547906,3M TA3,2017-05-16 09:39:00,2846,"Bet Gord likes that, eh?"
5532810,johnboat,2017-05-09 13:03:00,2014,"Wedge, Buy one and rest easy. But........it won't do you any good to have one if you don't pack the tools to put it on. Spare prop nut?........check. Spare prop nut pin?......check. Spare shear pin?......check. All VERY hard to find if they get dropped in the drink!"
5532826,Bill Krejca,2017-05-09 13:03:00,6107,"My spare prop is on the Yamaha 8 hp, so far, so good. The best insurance when on unfamiliar water is to always check the map and GPS chart before starting the motor. Every time. Bill"
5532850,Babamel2,2017-05-09 13:29:00,414,"Yes, Always have one with me. Never had to use it. I would much rather spend the money on something I never use, than have to spend one rainy cool night out on a dark lake."
5532898,skindzier,2017-05-09 13:56:00,137,"100% absolutely, yes. We sometimes go out 20+ miles on Lac Seul, so I look at it as a necessity. In fact, I've always been a little antsy even with that. What if I have mechanical motor issues or what if I take out the whole lower unit? I finally put that to rest this off-season & bought a boat with a 9.9 kicker..."
5532914,tandm,2017-05-09 14:02:00,679,"Spare prop for main and kicker, plus extra nuts, washers, cotter keys, spark plugs and the necessary wrenches. Also, a crescent wrench , vice grip pliers and an adjustable pliers. Also carry extra fuel filters. They have little value on the shelf at home. Other than the props, everything fits in a water-tight box."
5532922,tandm,2017-05-09 14:11:00,679,"I agree with the 9.9 kicker. Main reason I added one. But 20+ miles out at 6miles/hr. makes for a long trip back to camp.It does get you to a sheltered area to make repairs,if repairs are possible, though."
5533058,Wedge,2017-05-09 15:30:00,270,"Thanks for all the input guys. I do have a 9.9 kicker on the boat too. It sounds like I should follow thru with what I was thinking, just buy an aluminum backup with hardware and be done with it. I dont feel like I need one for the kicker and the trolling motor. If the trolling motor prop goes, I can use the kicker, if the kicker goes, use the trolling motor. It wont be as good as using them both together, but I can get by. I already keep a pretty extensive tool kit in the boat."
5533418,alberta bum,2017-05-09 18:53:00,312,"The one year I didn't bring one, I was at a boat in lodge about 15 miles from where I parked my vehicle..sure enough knocked a blade off and folded one over about a mile from the lodge.. luckily it only took 2 days too get a prop delivered to the lodge... you don't want too know the cost.... and of course,, I did it mid day on the best fishing day I've ever had on that lake.My suggestion if you have a stainless on your boat.. buy an aluminum spare and put that one for your trip, and keep the stainless as your spare.."
5533434,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-09 18:58:00,8293,I even threw a spare trolling motor in last year. Didn't want anything to spoil the trip. Thankfully I didn't need it. Everything went smooth.
5534114,fishmanric,2017-05-10 06:37:00,219,"Always carry a spare prop. Much like my golf game where I seem to find the woods often, when fishing, rocks seem to jump out in front of me."
5532482,Wedge,2017-05-09 11:12:00,270,I am trying to decide if this is a purchase I need to make prior to heading up in a few weeks.
5532514,stjoeguy,2017-05-09 11:28:00,979,"Yes, I bring a spare prop but haven't had to use it yet."

5532546,camp chef,2017-05-09 11:32:00,915,wouldn't think of going to Canada without one.........Never ever
5532602,Ver88,2017-05-09 11:42:00,114,Always have a spare in the boat while in Canada and hope to never use it. I have encountered a few boats 20 miles out that could only idle due to prop damage.
5532610,Shotgun,2017-05-09 11:44:00,759,Yes I carry one and yes I've had to change one. Lakes are full of non-marked hazards.
5532626,Lovetofish,2017-05-09 12:04:00,458,Yes. I can hardly lift my tool tote with the spare stuff for my boat motor and trailer parts. Never had to change out a prop or fix a trailer bearing but it seems like I had to dig in the tool tote for something every year. I won't go up there without the spare stuff.
5532674,bigwalleye1,2017-05-09 12:10:00,2632,"Like American Express...I don't leave home without one. It may be an aluminum spare, but it beats waving at passing boats and screaming..."
5532754,packpro,2017-05-09 12:30:00,695,Always....One for the motor and one for the TM.
5532802,Fishin Fun,2017-05-09 13:01:00,218,"After running into a rock with the boat and being out of commission for a day while it got rebuilt and the $300 bill that came with it(this happened about 25 years ago), I always carry an extra prop AND prop nut in the boat."
