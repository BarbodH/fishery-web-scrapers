4976977,Freytown,2016-07-09 15:18:00,770,"Ron, pretty sure most here are complaining about the fishy taste that freezing with the skin intact brings."
4977025,octanehi5,2016-07-09 15:43:00,1104,"now that the law requires us to bring back fish with the pectoral fin and tail attached,If you bring back somewhat whole fish and not fileted,the meat does not come in contact with the skin in the freezer bag.like the way they take tuna to market. I have not tried my take home fish yet,but will post how they made the trip. You are never going to beat,live fish right out of the water,filet on site. Dreadged in beer batter and fried in hot peanut oil"
4977121,fishron,2016-07-09 16:08:00,317,"The whole change seems crazy to me. Ron showed me how he was taking them home and it was the convenient way to comply. I went the long route, carefully removing the bones, preserving the pectoral fin and keeping the skin and the attachment of the tail to the fillets. Had some the other night and they were great. Long term freezing with the skin on in water or not might affect the taste. I considered removing all the skin except around the pectoral and the tail but that's not regulation. Two things to consider if your not using Ron's method. Take a pair of shears for cutting around the pectoral. It's a knife duller. Use a large or long bag that will lay the fish out straight. I had visions if we had been checked of waiting for the fillets to thaw before they could be measured. No doubt about the goodness of fresh caught, filleted, and cooked walleye. Ron made that abundantly clear when we joined his group for supper."
4977497,sbe2,2016-07-09 20:29:00,63,"""Dreadged in beer batter and fried in hot peanut oil""-Yummmm"

5560385,Freytown,2017-05-22 06:49:00,770,"Going back to the live cage this spring. Will gut the fish the night before I leave and pack with ice for the ride home. The fish will be dead about 24 hrs when I get home to then filet and vacuum seal/freezer. I tossed everything I brought home last year as it was terrible, I'm sure the coons had a nice meal. Lesson learned: never freeze fish with skin attached. FT"
4946553,Bigredmf,2016-06-23 19:04:00,129,I would think its essential to wash the skin well before filleting and packagingPackage them individually so the meat can not come into contact with skin from another fishA camp owner told me twenty five years ago to make sure you wash the slime off of Pike and do not set a fillet into any slime left on the tableWhen you do this Pike tastes much better than Walleye!Red
4946585,Andre (wallyandre),2016-06-23 19:20:00,2274,"Agree! 1 fillet per bag, wash the slime and use waxe paper, saranwrap and freeser bag"
4946689,Kartman35,2016-06-23 23:09:00,245,"Just to clarify, in previous years the tail did not need to be present nor the pectoral fin, however the skin still had to attached along the whole length of the filet (not just a patch of skin). The slime was there before as it is present along the surface of the skin. Did you not have smelly slimy walleye in years past? I just don't get how the tail and the front fin affect anything that much vs having filets with the whole skin on."
4946817,Freytown,2016-06-24 05:38:00,770,"I separated the skin on the whole filet leaving only a small piece attached. Then wiped the slime from both sides of the skin. Inserted in a vacuum bag and froze. Filet looked like skin was intact. Kartman, with only the tail and a small patch with the pectoral fin, do you think the same specie id and length could be determined??? Waiting your reply."
4947217,Kartman35,2016-06-24 08:59:00,245,"I 100% agree that would be not only a much better way to keep fish, but would totally solve the problem of identifying the fish and establishing it's length within the slot. I'm NOT on the side of the MFFP/MRNF here. I also don't understand why the rule was skin on whole filet last year. With a minimum length of 32cm, a patch of skin would have been plenty to establish legality as it is in most jurisdictions in North America. Sunday I'm heading to Lac Mistassini...one of the few places left with no length limit and 'patch of skin is enough' rules. My only question was about why this is suddenly an issue since the skin (and therefore slime) was already there last year. Any reason why you can't perform the same operation you did in years past (separating skin and wiping down then freezing)? Doing that would not be any more illegal this year than it was before."

4927289,Andre (wallyandre),2016-06-14 15:22:00,2274,I live with a slot limit for 5 years now and fishing is improving year after year. Best thing that happen to our fisherie.
4928289,Kartman35,2016-06-14 22:37:00,245,Even prior to the slot limit the rule was the skin had to adhere to the entire length of the filet...the only difference is that now the tail must be attached to both filets and the pectoral fin must be present to verify that the filet has not been shortened. There are very few zones in Quebec that allow for just a patch of skin on walleye for ID purposes.
4935369,Freytown,2016-06-18 05:34:00,770,"I don't have a problem with the new slot but freezing filets with skin on results in a poor tasting dinner. Years ago when I camped, we kept our fish alive in a cage. Then gutted them the day before leaving and icing them whole for trip home. Fileted before freezing at home. Pain in the azz but good eating.There has to be a better way to comply without ruining fish that is brought home. My 2 cents."
4935457,sbe2,2016-06-18 07:23:00,63,^^^ exactly. I would be glad to read any suggestions.
4936689,octanehi5,2016-06-19 04:36:00,1104,"The walleye that you have frozen at home are never going to taste the same as fresh out of the lake. Air is the biggest enemy here,it promotes freezer burn. Freeze in water,or vacumm pack. I have always taken fish home with the skin on the fillets.It has always helped against freezer burn.Now with the new rules, I'm going to try,beheading the fish,Gutting it and shipping it home whole. Fillet it at home just before cooking. Bleeding the fish out while its alive,also makes a big differance."
4936809,sbe2,2016-06-19 06:24:00,63,"Octane, I will be very interested to hear your results. We vacuum seal with the skin on and a paper towel to absorb moisture, but still get that little funk taste. I feel like I am trying to have my cake and eat it too, trying to get the Quebec taste back into the States."

Anyone see a problem with this approach???"
4946329,Freytown,2016-06-23 16:02:00,770,Contacted the Quebec MFFP about my idea and was told to follow the rules???? Maybe when folks stop going the loss of tourist $$$$$ will hit a nerve. Why does the skin between the tail & pectoral need to be present to id specie & length....it doesn't. FT

4923897,Andre (wallyandre),2016-06-13 15:08:00,2274,Game warden will decide but probably between $200-400. + they seize all the other fish.
4924081,sbe2,2016-06-13 16:03:00,63,"Yikes. We used to vacuum seal the filets with a paper towel ""tampon"" (no other way to explain it) in order to minimize slime, and then froze them before we left.What ways do y'all freeze your fish to minimize slime? Has anyone frozen a fish whole? I know that there is no way to get that shore lunch Gouin freshness, I am just trying to figure out a good solution to my 1st world problem."
4924281,octanehi5,2016-06-13 17:12:00,1104,"Air Tamarac has had a slot limit imposed by them for more than 12 yrs. 14"" to 20"" Walleyes maybe harvested but no more than 4 per person at any one time. Since its introduction the numbers of fish caught in the slot as well as over the slot has grown every yr. You will find that putting your take home fillets will be better when stored and frozen in water,unless you have a portable vacuum sealer."
4924889,sbe2,2016-06-13 20:37:00,63,I think the slot has been overdue on the Gouin and hope the fishing will be even better over the next few years like u said octane. A fine of >$250 is a good size deposit for the next year. Definitely not worth taking the skin off my fillets.
4927113,octanehi5,2016-06-14 14:32:00,1104,"It has been a serious problem with a lot of lakes from the gouin and south, many have been overfished,and do not hold lots of fish.

4650177,Kartman35,2016-03-19 07:58:00,245,"Actually, the bottom fins/wings are not required, just the pectoral. This is pretty much the way walleyes must be transported in Quebec anywhere there is a slot limit. If the pectoral is accidentally removed on one side it's not a big deal, as they only need one side intact to see that the fish has not been shortened since both filets are attached at the tail."
4652025,sbe2,2016-03-19 20:49:00,63,"I like the new slot limits being imposed. There seems to be more success stories than failures with slot limits being imposed on other lakes which have implemented one. I personally prefer to keep a 16"" eye for shore lunch and dinner. Is there any particular reason as to why they decided to implement the slot? Did they want to increase the amount of eyes? Or increase the average size of an eye caught? Or (highly unlikely) increase the amount of trophy eyes? Which doesn't make sense with the limit and all, but doesn't hurt to ask.Anything to get more bits on a good fishery is alright with me"

Last yr I know for a fact the largest number of big fish were caught,as well as one of the guys in my camp holds the record for last yr at 31""-11lbs.

Could be better for the fishery but I personally have not seen a decline in the years we have been there. Usually the only differences are the weather and getting on the right pattern/colors early enough.
4563425,tshea,2016-02-19 18:46:00,36,I was at the Montreal hunting and fishing show today - spoke to a couple outfitters on the gouin and they were notified yesterday that the slot limit will be in effect this year.
4563753,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-19 21:23:00,2274,What was their opinion on that? I spke with the major one at the Outfitters show 2 weeks ago and they were all happy with that rule (even if it's official since yesterday it was unofficial for more then a month.

I'd even go as far as a possession limit of 2, but that would hurt the tourism industry way too much. I think 6 is reasonable. I also think more studies need to be done on the fecundity of large females. I have a feeling that the old girls that are 30""+ are just not really worth worrying about in terms of reproduction. However, there's no reason you should want to eat an old fish like that."

4399433,Andre (wallyandre),2015-12-24 12:58:00,2274,"The problem of netting is not that important and if somebody knows that a certain member of the tribe is netting walleyes on a spawn area he can call the Band Councel with some nformations or descriptions and better with a photo with the exact location and they will take care of it. It's something that is not tolerate.How I know that? I have friends in Obedjiwan. One day we have made a fun contest between my white friends and my Attiamek friends: rods against net and we won easily. Nettitng in a river when it's spawning time is not something that is done by the majority but only by a very small minority that are also the ones that drink and takes drugs; that's why the Band Counsel want to know about those individuals. If they do that it's because they have white that exhange walleyes for drugs and booze.Regarding the slot limit it's something that should have been introduce many years ago but it's never too late. In 90% of the Quebec territory is under a slot limit and at the beginning they were a lot of guys complaining about that rule but ask anybody today and they fully agree and the reason is for simple: walleye fishing is better now and much better then let's say 5 years ago. Take a look at my photos gallery.Before 1975 they were 3 big commercial ships that sere cruising the Gouin with big nets and those fish were sold in and outside the province so it's not 4-5 stupids brain burn by the drugs & booze that will ruin the fishery.Coordinates for the Attikamek:Conseil des Atikamekw d'Opitciwan22, rue AmiskwObedjiwan (Québec) G0W 3B0Téléphone : 819 974-8837Télécopieur : 819 974-8828Courriel : [email protected]Chef : Christian AwashishCoordinates of the AFC for the reservoir Gouin (and aux. game warden)Adresse : 762, rue St-Antoine, La Tuque, QC G9X 2Z4Téléphone 819) 523-5255"

We had a few run in's with the part time game wardens (the ones without side arms) this summer and they had no interest in seeing our provincial licenses but they definitely wanted to see our AFC licenses. They were measuring our fish to ensure they were long enough. As a non resident our group of eight people spend in excess of $1500/year just in licenses and the fishing is definitely not as good as it used to be. Also - we were told that there already was a slot limit for 2015 - from the MFFP web site ""You may keep yellow walleye between 32 cm up to and including 47 cm in length Sauger: no length limit."" - did this NOT apply at Gouin ??
