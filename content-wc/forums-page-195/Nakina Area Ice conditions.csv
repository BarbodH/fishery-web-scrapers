5528946,BIGMANBIGPIKE,2017-05-08 05:33:00,8,Anyone have any info on the condition of the ICE up there??
5529090,Jason B.,2017-05-08 06:44:00,7,"on the 29th of April there was 18-22 inches, this weekend there is still 16 inches, all of us outfitters are watching it close, hoping for some warm weather and rain to get things going, still snow around too."
5529114,onetimedave,2017-05-08 06:53:00,502,As of last night I talked to Christine at AWO and she said Cordingly Lake was still very ice covered. Some bush lakes opening up if they had good amounts of water flowing through. Need rain to open lakes.
5530082,Jason B.,2017-05-08 13:34:00,7,"ice today in Nakina (may 8, 2017)"
5531386,5 of Diamonds,2017-05-08 22:15:00,151,WOW! Thanks for the update.
5531714,onetimedave,2017-05-09 06:18:00,502,This AM received an email pic of ice covered Cordingly Lake Nakina. No open water just lots of ice/snow. Flying May 26. Hope it is gone by then. They need rain to help the process
5531794,515,2017-05-09 06:39:00,254,I'm not liking the odds for the opening week groups
5532434,vteye2,2017-05-09 10:55:00,123,They just had a cold snap over most of the last couple weeks. Weather is supposed to break tomorrow back in the 50's should be all set foropening week. Our first trip last week in May 2013 we had ice in the bays.We still caught plenty of fish.
5536017,Walleye Wanderer,2017-05-10 20:34:00,101,YIKES!!! Flying May 20th...I hope?
5545266,sbooth,2017-05-15 09:46:00,3,"There has been good progress over the last few days. Shorelines are opening up, warm weather and rain in the forecast for the next few days. My opinion is it will be all gone for opener."
