5549370,mickr,2017-05-16 20:01:00,74,I've never been but it is on my list of places for my annual spring trip. it looks great on the website and I like the drive there. I'd really appreciate a report when you get back. I've haven't booked there primarily because I can't find a lot of reports about the placegood luck! Mick

Daytime fishing locate fish by trolling (hot-n-tot, weighted rapala or worm harness). Once located, jig with 1/4 oz jig with leech or worm. After supper, troll #11 size rapalas or similiar lure. Add a split shot early then take it off as it gets later. This early most fish won't be far from obvious spawning locations (current, inflows, neck downs, etc.). Biggest fish are always late. Best time at this time of year is 8-10 pm. Besides size, you can catch more fish during this window than the rest of the day at this time of the year. This is general advice I know but holds pretty true for the area."
