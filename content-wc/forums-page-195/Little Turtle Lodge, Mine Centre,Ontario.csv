This place is a true fishing camp, but is very comfortable, quiet and clean. The lake itself is a really strong fishing lake. It is fairly easy to catch 13-16 inch walleye, anything bigger is a rarity but you can catch as many of those 13-16 fish as you would want. The largest walleye we have pulled out is 22 inches, but I have seen that there are bigger ones in there. This lake is a WORLD CLASS smallmouth fishery, largest smallie we have pulled out of this lake is 23 inches and in one week my group of 4 pulled out 25 master angling smallmouth. This lake also has a healthy pike population with some real pigs in there, 42 inches are the biggest we have pulled out. Great place."
