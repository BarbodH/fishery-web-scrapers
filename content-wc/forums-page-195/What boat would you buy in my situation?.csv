5557953,Hunts1,2017-05-20 18:07:00,123,"Personally, I fish in Canada once or twice a year and have done so for many years. Also fish Wisconsin frequently. Tiller boat works the best for walleye fishing and Muskie fishing, for me and my buddies. You have much more space in the tiller than you do in a console boat. And better control. You have direct drive and can back troll or maneuver much better than a console. However sitting at the back driving you do get a little wetter in a tiller in wind and waves. I spent a lot of time thinking about it and went with a Lund pro guide 1825 4 years ago and could not be happier. A buddy of mine bought a Crestliner console ""double bubble"" boat and this year we are taking mine to Canada and not his for 3 of us to fish out of. If you are just boating and cruising then get a console.My two cents."
5558121,Moosebunk,2017-05-20 20:02:00,211,"Personally, I think your choices in the ProGuide and Competitor tillers are perfect dood! Those 17 1/2 footers seem trickier to find in the classifieds than the 18's but man, you'll be a happy camper when one finally comes to you. Hold out! Tillers are the best."

5546698,Pooch,2017-05-15 19:47:00,4618,"^^ What Shellback has, but in 18' with a little larger engine. Lund's Alaskan is a peach of a boat. Tiller, all flat floor, but minimal storage. Guys buy them and keep them so not a lot of used around. New one is within reach of most folks.Pooch"

5546994,pjshorthorn,2017-05-15 22:33:00,5654,"If I was spending your money, I would concur on the Lund Alaskan. Although it was a side console, I used my uncle's boat a number of times in Canada and I found it to be very roomy, a dry ride, very responsive and just a nice boat. I think he had a 90 HP Evinrude on it. I think a tiller model would be the cat's meow and I really don't think one would have to power it with anything more than a 90 HP motor. PjShorthorn"
5547306,MrSimon,2017-05-16 06:35:00,922,"Further North - I really appreciate you posting those links. I spent some time and looked through each one. Those are EXACTLY the types of boat I want. At least two of them I would probably buy if I could figure out the logistics. It's about an 18-20 hour drive to the areas where those boats are. That's a long trip just for a boat, but I plan to make memories in this boat with my family for at least 20 years. I'm starting to feel a road trip coming up ....."
5547426,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-16 07:03:00,447,Maybe plan an extra day or two to test out that new boat on the waters near where you purchase it. Some good fishing in the upper Midwest in May and June.
5547914,LOW1,2017-05-16 09:45:00,2828,"Take the kids. Ideally pull them out of school to do it. Seriously. They will remember the road trip to get ""their"" boat as much as they do the later fishing trips with it. It's the sort of thing that they will talk about at your funeral 75 or so years from now."
5547922,castnblast,2017-05-16 09:52:00,111,"Hold out for the boat of your dreams...if you are a tiller guy, you are a tiller guy I was in the exact same position as you - and searched for ""the right"" used proguide for 3 years. There werre none avail in my area. (T Bay) I ran a explorer with a 50 tiller for years - great boat - but always really wanted a proguide. A month ago I did find a new / non current 1725 with a 75 HP Merc - and got a great deal but had travel 1600km to pick up in Southern Ontario. Had the boat in the water twice and it ihandles exactly like I thought it would. Perfect boat for the fishing I do. Good luck - hope you find the boat you really want : )"
5548242,southernEyes,2017-05-16 11:46:00,232,"I've been in your shoes. I ended up buying the boat I wanted halfway across the country. Lots of tiller boats around smith mountain lake in Virginia these days, probably find a used one around there tooSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5554786,MikeG1,2017-05-19 07:02:00,433,"I've been where you are and in my opinion you can't go wrong with an aluminum boat between 18 - 21 feet, powered with at least 90 HP (but I'd go bigger - 115 to 150). These boats are lightweight and easy to tow. They allow a versatile fishing platform and provide an opportunity for the kids to ski and tube. Add a 9.9 kicker and a bow mount electric trolling motor and you have the boat control necessary for any type of fishing. I have this rig in a StarCraft model with a 125 main motor. I use it on Lake Erie when waves are up to 4 feet, and I can even use it on PA Fish Commission lakes where only electrics are permitted and everything in between with the 9.9. There is no perfect boat, but this rig - IMHO - is about as perfect as you can get. Good luck. Have fun."
5545346,MrSimon,2017-05-15 10:13:00,922,"I'm putting this here, not in ""Boat"", on purpose ... I want input from guys who fish Canada. Me and my kids have finally outgrown our trusty 16' Sylvan tiller with a 40HP Honda. For the fishing we do (local PA lakes, medium sized rivers, St. Lawrence River, Canada) our dream boat would be something like a Lund ProGuide 1775 or Alumacraft Competitor 175 with a 75-90HP TILLER. Problem is, I can't find a used one within 1,000 miles of my house (been looking for 2 years) and I just can't stomach spending $30k for a new one. But, what I can find all over the place are used 18' side console boats (G3, Lund, Crestliner etc) with 90-150HP motors. Very nice boats, and at good prices, but I really want a tiller and I don't want such a big heavy boat. They use a lot of gas, are heavy to tow and launch, and are cumbersome in smaller water. So, do I settle and buy the larger boat (maybe I'll love it??) .... or do I hold out for the unicorn boat of my dreams? Or, do I drive 2,500 miles to ND or MN where they actually exist? What do you guys think?"
5545402,LOW1,2017-05-15 10:28:00,2828,"After all the talking is done, it's a personal choice.But, since you asked, my thoughts are (1) there's a big difference in weight, cost, etc between a 90 hp side counsel and a 150 side counsel. And you could get a 17 foot side counsel with something smaller than a 90. Something in the 75 hp range would do nicely. (2) but if you are 100% committed to a tiller, go buy one. A road trip to MN or ND with the kids to buy a boat would be fun."
5545450,camp chef,2017-05-15 10:46:00,915,We have a 165 Lowe fishing machine it is aside console with a 60 hp 4 stroke. Easy to fish out of light great gas mileage. It has a 28 gallon tank and we boat in 30 miles and fish hard all week on one tank of gas......I doubt you would miss the tiller. Good on small water and big water.
5545802,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-15 12:34:00,447,"Have you spent some time fishing with your family out of a side console? If not, rent one locally for a day, go out with a buddy in his or rent one for your next week long trip north of the border. You might really like a SC. If not, as someone suggested, take a road trip to where you have a few tiller boats to choose from. Good luck. Shopping for a new boat is fun."
5545954,MrSimon,2017-05-15 13:04:00,922,"I've owned multiple side consoles and have rented tons as well. They are nice. But, when I have 2, 3, or even 4 kids in the boat with me ... I want as much floor space as possible, and I like to have all of the kids in front of me where I can see them. There is a Lund Pro Guide on the classifieds right now in Grand Rapids ..... I might give him a call right now."
5545970,Multispecies Guy,2017-05-15 13:07:00,447,Absolutely understand your thinking of a tiller boat with kids. Good luck in your search.
5546050,Guest,2017-05-15 13:57:00,0,"According to Lund a 1775 Pro Guide and a 1875 impact SC weigh about the same boat 1225lbs boat trailer 2500lbs so loading, trailering, gas usage, should be a none issue."
5546114,stumcfar,2017-05-15 14:52:00,451,"I would definitely consider the side console. The console takes up a little space, but so does a person sitting in the back running a tiller. My personal preference as I switched from a tiller and will never again have a boat without a steering wheel, but you need to choose what you are comfortable with."
5546146,Shellback,2017-05-15 15:06:00,8083,"Make an adventure out of a trip to the midwest for a tiller boat. I drove to Maine for my Alaskan. I have a handicapped wife and know what you mean about have the kids in front of you. You don't want to turn around and get bad news. Hopefully if you find a boat you have to travel for, maybe a local W/C member could take a look at it before you commit to a trip."
5546546,northernbite,2017-05-15 18:32:00,1186,"I live just south of Erie, 900 miles to northern Wisconsin and met the guy from Minnesota who drove 400 miles to pick up boat I wanted. 2010 ProGuide, paid his mileage and room saved me a whole day. If it's what you want you need to go to the mid west or order a new one. They have tillers out there. Paul"
