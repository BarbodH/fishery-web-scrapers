5554266,Rich B,2017-05-18 20:09:00,1081,"Thanks for the warm welcome....a lot of boys (and a few girls) are in route or have already crossed the border and arrived for Sat's Opener. Personally will miss it this year as our Opener trip was pushed back into early July (medical issue came up for a one of the guys on the trip), though have a family fishing trip up north planned for mid-June which helps ease the pain (somewhat....as I truly love fishing the Opener week).

5556298,pan-man,2017-05-19 19:19:00,299,I'm sure they were fishing for crappies.
5556458,Obabikon,2017-05-19 19:59:00,2370,"I'm sure that's what they claim. I always fish for crappie in walleye holes this time of year. Maybe I'm the only one, but this is something that really irritates me."
