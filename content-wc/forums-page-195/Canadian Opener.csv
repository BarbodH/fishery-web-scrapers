5558977,Obabikon,2017-05-21 09:45:00,2370,"It was a little chilly Saturday on Lake of the Woods. Not bad. We caught plenty of nice walleye. Started around 8:30... had our limits plus half a dozen perch by 9:10. Caught a nice 24.5"" walleye too (released of course). Mostly fishing points, but I tried lots of different options. Went pike fishing in the afternoon, and caught 40-50 pike between 22"" - 30"". Kept 4 for them to take home.Also caught a crappie on a spinner bait.... lol, so that was a first. Tried to see if we were on a big school. Put on twister tails... didn't catch another one.All in all... it was a great first day and a wonderful first shore lunch!"
5559105,LoDo,2017-05-21 11:09:00,721,Walleyes caught in 50 degree temps and 5-12' water?
5559161,martinbns,2017-05-21 12:41:00,1520,"We have had the opposite to our friend above. We rented a cabin on storm bay, fished around the opening of the boat launch near longbow, several humps near scotty island on both ends, south of Hay island, around several islands in Bigstone bay, even resorted to some of our more normal spots like Keewatin channel and got skunked...minnows, leeches and some cranks into rocky points. First time skunked, had to buy our walleye along with a couple of pints of a nice Czech lager at lake of the woods brewery. Had decent luck on Bass thursday/friday, caught 8 along with a few smallish pike."
5559473,prov1800,2017-05-21 16:30:00,5010,fished cedar lake yesterday and found walleyes fairly shallow and some quite deep.not really a set pattern.typical for this time of year.crappies were still suspended over deep water but close to spawning areas.waiting for the right temps.day before went for lakers and caught walleyes in 50 ft.let them go of course hopefully they make it.moved of that spot in a hurry.happens every year.really not sure what there doing there.could be a preferred water temp.today to ugly to go out.do some projects.tomorrow looks like rain to.good luck to everyone.
5559649,bthomas3333,2017-05-21 18:23:00,465,"Hey, Fishing Hawk Lake Lodge for the opener. Water temp is colder than last year. Can see the fish staging in deeper water and occasionally cruising really shallow. One minute you visually see a big fish in 6 feet of water and then next thing they light up the finder in 30-60ft. I think the unstable weather and colder than last year water temp has the fishing unstable. My dad managed the 29 below. I got a 26 1/2 also below. Today was also tough but we managed matching 26s in less than 10ft... Key has been slow / slower / slowest. Seeing water temps 48-54. Tight lights and heres hoping for some improving weather in the next few days! B-"
5559713,fishron,2017-05-21 18:39:00,317,"Seems like everyone had wild weather like we did on Crotch Lake, Land o lakes lodge. First time there. Only an hour and a half over the border. We had hail, wind and drenching downpours, but enough decent weather to enjoy our first trip to the area. This section of Ontario has received a lot of rain. The lake was two feet above normal. Trees were standing in the lake. The floating wood was downright dangerous. For our first time on the lake we did okay, thanks to much guidance from Al who co-owns the place. It's a beautiful lake with great structure and quality fish. No great numbers this trip. Enough to fill our limits and lots of catch and release bass."
5559729,muskyman73,2017-05-21 18:51:00,401,"Nice dude, see you in a month and a few days, jack and I are counting them."
5559889,Obabikon,2017-05-21 20:45:00,2370,"Above 50 degrees... however, 13-20 feet deep off rock points. Not much on beaches or weeds."
