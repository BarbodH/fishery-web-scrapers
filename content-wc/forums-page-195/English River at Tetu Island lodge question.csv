I am going to take a couple of my fav pike/muskie lures that aren't your normal lures, just wondering what is the water clarity like there? Want to take appropriate color for the water."

Looks like a good big northern spot though, and that is what I hope to get into. Of course we will be fishing for walleyes too. Thanks for the info on the water clarity. The guides will surely know better than me what works on that water, but I just want to bring a couple of my ""special"" smaller muskie lures that have worked real good for pike for me."
