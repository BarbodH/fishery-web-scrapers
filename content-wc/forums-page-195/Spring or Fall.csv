Fishing is easier in the spring, but fall fishing just has something about it that I like. No crowds, no pressure, not much surprise with the weather. You go expecting the worst and when it turns out to be nice weather (the last two years for me) it's a bonus. Fish seem bigger and meaner. All that being said, two weeks from today and I'm on my way for the first trip of the year."
