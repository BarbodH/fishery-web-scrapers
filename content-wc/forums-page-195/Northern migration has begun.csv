Many varieties of trucks and boats with varying state licence plates were spotted in Dryden today which seems to be a popular spot along the migration route. Most converging in the Safeway, Walmart and beer store parking lots. Hope everyone has a safe journey. Have fun everyone and happy fishing."

It starts out at a fever pitch on the third Saturday in May every year when they are so focused on the best spots on lakes like Lac Seul, Lake of the Woods, Cedar Lake, Red Lake and Gullrock Lake to name a few that they will almost come to fisticuffs vieing for that perfect spot to fish. Not unlike a couple of bucks during the rut. It can usually be defused by shoving a cold LaBatt's Blue or a Kokonee in their face. The migration slowly winds down through the summer months but there is a secondary migration of some hardy anglers that appears during September and October. The species is extremely prepared for the migration and adapt well to their environment. They usually get along well with each other and their Canadian friends unless of course they run out of beer or bait."
