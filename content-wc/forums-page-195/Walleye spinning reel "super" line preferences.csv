5545434,Doublelung76,2017-05-15 10:33:00,42,You are spot on with having 2 spools filled with different line to vary it up and come up with a preference.ive been using P-line cxx 8lb test and I love it.its a copolymer that gives decent stretch but is more sensitive for jigging.its way more forgiving than flourocarbon which can be a nitemare on spinning gear.
5546490,muskyman73,2017-05-15 18:08:00,401,Fireline in dark gray at LOTW for me is a really good set up. My cousin likes spiderwire and power pro. I like power pro on my musky set up and the bigger stuff.
5550234,SterlingArcher,2017-05-17 08:02:00,92,"Because I feel lazy this morning I didn't read through all the previous replies, so apologies if this has already been covered! I am a HUGE fan of braid - extremely sensitive, extremely strong, no memory, lasts for a very long time without weakening. In most Canada lakes I've fished, the fish don't tend to be line-shy, so that isn't an issue. The main reason I suggest tying a mono or fluoro leader to the braid is that in your typical rocky Canadian Shield lake where you know you're going to get snagged a fair amount, braid can be REALLY hard to break. I have seen people break rod tips trying to break free from a rock. And you don't want to cut floating line like braid because it has the potential to get wrapped up in props. A 4-8' fluoro leader will keep the sensitivity allowing you to feel light bites, while making it much easier to snap the leader if need be to get freed from rocks or wood. I usually do 15lb Power Pro with 6-lb fluoro leader."
5550266,Larry S,2017-05-17 08:08:00,665,Have used 10 lb-- 4lb diameter Fireline for 10 years Have Never had any trouble pulling line off rocks or snags Use a 5 inch piece of wood dowel. Rap line around dowel and pull works every time
5552850,mwh624,2017-05-18 09:24:00,183,"10lb braid, take your pick lots of good options (Suffix 832, PowerPro, etc) and a 8-15lb fluorocarbon leader for some added abrasion resistance against northers and big 'eyes teeth."
5323177,bigwalleye1,2017-02-09 11:34:00,2632,"Don't know about the braid choices you mention being flexible enough to cast, but I do know that Invisibraid is. Also, regardless of which braid, I'd advise a short leader of mono or something like Suffix to enable an easier jig change or intentional breakoff in the case of rocks."
5324337,WallyWarrior,2017-02-09 21:45:00,2488,Plus a little more abrasion resistance with the leader. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
5325049,David Anderson,2017-02-10 09:32:00,2073,"Although I have done the switch from mono to braid and back to mono. I personalty didn't like the feel of braid, it always felt that I was missing fish by pulling the jig right out of their mouth where mono's stretch give me a little more margin. Today my line of choice is P-Line CX flourocoated Mono in moss green. It is extra thin but very strong as I use 8# test and it has the same diameter as most 6# test mono's. Like all mono's a day of jigging does leave it twisted up, I pull it behind the boat on my way back to reset it."
5325161,mjayn,2017-02-10 10:31:00,1188,"100% braid for nearly 20 years, 75% with a flouro leader. First year or so I was snapping braid on rocks while jigging, snapping it on hook sets. braid has improved alot and has reduced these issues alot, but my experience with braid has had the biggest impact. I don't think I have had fireline break or snap in 10 years(except breaking off snags). Power pro still breaks now and then, but I use it alot in saltwater, and nanofil will rub itself apart with very little abrasion resistance. 75% fireline 20% powerpro 5% trying new line. Currently Nanofil(great caster but low abrasion resistance) and Suffix 832(hate it, its like a tiny limp rope). I did have an inshore rod spooled with 14lb XL, fished it for an hour and caught a few fish, I just had to swap it out with braid the stretch and lack of sensitivity just wasn't acceptable."

5382378,prov1800,2017-03-08 06:46:00,5010,"Being on the water daily as a guide ive tested all braids since they came out.ive found that they all seem good to me.75% of my time on the water is spent chasing walleye and i have been using 6# suffix and have no problems,jigging,lindy rigging,drop shotting,casting.i use 6#gamma floura as my leader material and have for years.i always spool on my new line tight and connect braid to floura with a double uni knot.some spools will need backing ir some electrical tape on the spool to hold the braid from slipping unless you have the spools that are made for braid and i still use backing or tape on those.6# line will catch anything in any lake if your hook is in the right spot.during my walleye days i have caught numerous pike and muskies and some large lake trout.casting a 1/8 oz jig is not a problem with this setup.i have a number of st.Croix rods with abu garcia orra reels on.i also have been using these set ups on my ice fishing gear.only thing i would have to say would be to make sure that reels are in good working order.of course i use the 80# braid on my pike/myskie setups with 80# gamma for my leader line.no swivel.double uni to connect those two also. might add that if you do get hung up which does happen i do carry a piece of dowel in my biat to wrap my braid around so i can break the floura.be carefull not to be jerking on your rod as the braid is strong and you could break your rod at this point."
5382986,Wawajake,2017-03-08 10:37:00,413,"I agree with Mjayn..........have been using Fireline for a dozen years now, both the clear and the grey, love it for sensitivity and good wear characteristics, it last for years on the reel , and so cost is a moot point ......and snags with jigs , you can usually bend the hook before it would ever break so you get back more of those snags without losing tackle"

5318721,bigwalleye1,2017-02-07 12:01:00,2632,"I think ElectricSlide is on it. I fish a little different rod than you, but a premium rod/reel combo nonetheless, and when I built the rod, Thorne Bros recommended Invisibraid, a 10 lb braid with a 2 lb diameter, and a 6 ft leader of Suffix. I didn't like the Suffix, and went back to a short leader of my favorite mono...you guessed it... 6 lb Trilene XL. Now I get the anti-stretch of the braid, increased feel of the braid, less water resistance of the braid, with the ease of know tying, the ability to break off when I hang up, the invisibility of the green mono in the water column, and just enough stretch at the very end of the hookset to not yank the jig free. I will say, though, that the hooksets are way different with braid, and that was the toughest part to get used to. Instead of the over-your-head Curt Gowdy hooksets, now it's a little flick of the wrist, and we're hooked up."
5319161,skindzier,2017-02-07 15:17:00,137,"I tried Fireline once and switched back to Trilene XL. I usually jig for walleyes and found that although the Fireline is strong as heck, it also nicks up easily in rocks and then breaks very easily. So, basically anytime you get hung up you almost have to retie. Trilene XL is more forgiving & can usually survive a few forays into the rocks."
5319193,ciese,2017-02-07 15:28:00,3,"I have used XL for the past 56 trips to Canada and I too love a good Shimano/St. Croix ML spinning rig. I find that the stretch in mono actually helps with hook set with less rip outs. You will also note that most Canadian camp sites and camp owners recommend mono as well for all walleye applications. I have tried braid and fluoro but don't see the need in Canada. Braid is also a bi*ch when you snag up jigging on the shield lakes in Canada, eh? I do use braid/fluoro while fishing Lake Michigan for salmon and trout where the long-line stretch could be an issue. My advice: Stay in your comfort zone. You won't have a problem with 8-10# XL for walleye in Canada. Good fishing, Ciese"

5321433,WallyWarrior,2017-02-08 15:53:00,2488,"I'm a spiderwire guy myself. I've never found anything to be better than braid in any situation, open water fishing, except slip bobber fishing, where I switch the spool to 6lb xt. You get strength, feel, less memory, and smaller diameter out of braid. Only downsides are the need for better knots and abrasion resistance, which is pretty well covered when using a leader.

5322353,LLewellin,2017-02-09 05:51:00,1790,I am a SpiderWire Stealth braid fan. I have this on at least 12-15 rods for walleye fishing. Ive been using the Stealth for at least 6-7 years. I have the same rod as you but I use that rod for rigging not jigging. I really like the Fenwick Elite Tech Bass rod for jigging eyes. I use the 15# Stealth and it casts very very well with no issues of wind knots except once in a great great while like maybe 1-2 times per year at the most. It will actually cast further IMHO that XL which was my staple line for many years. I don't think I had even one wind knot last season at all. I was always changing out my XL once in the spring and once in late July and with Stealth I do not change it at all. If the end looks like it is fraying I just cut off about 15' and retie a new fluoro leader. I can pitch a 1/16oz to 1/8oz jig as far as I can and I still feel the most lightest of bites. Love it!
5322705,1K1MOA,2017-02-09 08:15:00,90,"It is interesting to hear the various setups and how people are using them. My conclusion is one spool braid and one XL, and to really test the braid vs. XL this June. So the question is Suffix 832 or Spiderwire on a SPINNING reel that maintains castability, etc.? Thinking 10 or 12# mono equivalent. My other question is anyone ever test break on these braids? Is 10# braid breaking close to that? Thank you all for your great input!"
5323033,Ver88,2017-02-09 10:35:00,114,"I use braid for nearly everything at this point. I can't find a downside of braid for my fishing. I jig or cast jigs most of the time and I rarely use a flouro leader. I prefer power pro or spiderwire. I tried suffix 832 for a while but it does not cast as well as power pro or stealth, and I seemed to get more knots while casting."
5317161,1K1MOA,2017-02-06 17:24:00,90,"So once again thinking about an alternative to my good 'ol Trilene XL. Every time in past I tried something else, I quickly returned back to Trilene XL. I get the benefits of fluoro, braid, fireline, etc. and have used as leaders and on other larger spinning reels, primarily in FL keys salt water. So here is my issue, I LOVE the castability and lack of memory,etc. of XL, and thus keep coming back to it. With that said, as I plan my Canada trips this year I am intrigued by a thinner, clear Fireline, fluoro, or braid that transfers more feel to the rod. I am fishing a Fenwick Elite Tech Walleye rod (MF) and a way too expensive Abu reel that I love (MGX spinning). I feel like I am not getting the most out of this rig fishing mono on it. So here is my request - if you are a spinning bigot, like me, who loves XL for it's casting, etc., like me, and have found a great superline or braid alternative that behaves similarly, I would love to hear what it is and it's pros and drawbacks. Thinking 10# mono equivalent. Thanks for your thoughts in advance..."
5317289,ElectricSlide19,2017-02-06 18:16:00,147,"One huge benefit is that braid has less stretch and thus is more sensitive than mono. And actually believe it or not, braid also has less memory. Another huge benefit is that 10# braid has the equivalent of most 2# mono line diameters. The only real draw back is that braid is more expensive than mono. The way to combat this is to fill your spool halfway with mono as a backing and then add around 75-100 yards of your braid. I have yet to find a walleye that is going to spool a reel and have never gotten down to my backing. Braid casts great as well, and I would even argue better than mono. If you are jigging for eyes then in my opinion braid trumps mono all day. Now, if you start lindy rigging, then you would want to use mono, because it has more stretch and will not allow the fish to feel you as well before you feed him line. I myself just like the 10# power pro, but I think you could even get away with 6-8 # and be just fine."

5317329,adempsey2.0,2017-02-06 18:30:00,612,"I assumed you tried some braid and switched back to Trilene. So, maybe it's best to learn why didn't you like braid. I have a feeling many problems people come across is with the thinner lower diameter lines. Personally, I don't like to use anything <15-20lb test on spinning reels because of that.BTW, I wouldn't worry too much about using mono. Sure, there are benefits to braid, but I imagine after using Trilene for so long you know how to fish it well. Some people actually find that Walleye fishing with braid is actually worse for them. You don't have the stretch of mono and end up having problems setting the hook due to it's stiffness. I think that's mostly due to being new to using braid though and would easily be corrected with use.Also, I wouldn't recommend Fireline, unless you're only vertical jigging with it. I like it for ice fishing, but won't use it otherwise."
5317449,1K1MOA,2017-02-06 19:13:00,90,"wow, very intuitive and interesting comment about the thinnest. I did go with a very thin braid and remember my biggest issue was wind knots when casting, if I recall correctly. My thought is to take a second spool and give another chance to a line with lower stretch. Where I am particularly interested in using it, is for Whitefish I typically am targeting 35 - 70' or when the eye bite is extremely light on a jig. I suspect I will feel the light bites better. Maybe I do stick with mono for casting, because you are right, I know it and fish it extremely well I actually do like a little stretch when a retrieved lure has a strike. I appreciate some of the suggestions already, thanks for the replies and suggestions all."
5317657,GBS,2017-02-06 22:17:00,2271,"I'm not very picky about line, but did start to use Spiderwire when it first came out. Through the years, and it's updates and changes, it still has been my go to line. Sure, when I buy a new reel, I'll let them load whatever ""free"" braid is included with the purchase. And usually find it inferior...so eventually get more Spiderwire. The other advantage - it can last a very long time....I have a couple of old rods only used for guests, etc. that have had faded Spider on them for several years, and it is every bit as strong as the ones with the new stuff."
5318281,mickr,2017-02-07 09:37:00,74,"I have several rods with me at all times for walleye fishing for various techniques. I jig a lot. No question in my mind that braid is a much better option for jigging. I started using Power Pro and used it for years, recently I switched to SpiderWire and like it better. I agree with whoever said to put backing on a reel and top it up with braid. Another tip to get more out of your braid is reversing it. A fluro leader is needed on some bodies of water, on others I don't find it makes a difference. The only setup that I use mono with is for trolling harnesses. can't really comment on throwing cranks as it's not something I do."
5318297,The tank,2017-02-07 09:46:00,340,I went from power pro to the first florocarbon line when it came out it had problems breaking to easy than went back to power pro. I went back to florocarbon the seaguar tetsu and I love it. Done with braided line for jigging. I use power pro for dragging spinniners and casting crank baits well for everything but jigging I love tetsu florocarbon line. It's not chesp but I've had it on one reel for a few years now with no problems.
