Just wondering if any of you veterans of the lake will be around to give a guy some pointers on where to find some fish. I did get lake map from Rushing River that has the coordinates to a lot of the rocks on the lake. Has anyone else used this map and enter the coords into your Humminbird? Thanks for any info"
