5547202,rzep,2017-05-16 06:21:00,1196,Do you guys tip pilot ? ... One taking you to the remote lodge/cabin from the base ? If so how much ? Both directions ? The plane is part of package so I am struggling with this as I know pilots are really not part of operations. It is about 20 min flight.
5547434,bigwalleye1,2017-05-16 07:03:00,2632,Only if you want him to come back for you....
5547546,Crede,2017-05-16 07:41:00,134,Our flight is about 1 hour. For 6 of us we tip $50 each way.
5547570,KSjim,2017-05-16 07:52:00,88,Typically our group tips about $10.00 per person each way.
5547578,Bstar,2017-05-16 07:55:00,564,$10/pp is our usual tip each way.

They also help to load and unload all of your gear. That alone is worth a tip. Although, that may vary depending on the air service or pilot.Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk"

5550010,rzep,2017-05-17 06:38:00,1196,thanks everyone. Flying to full service lodge so pilot does not do anything else for us. Seems as $10 pp one way is reasonable.
5550226,SterlingArcher,2017-05-17 07:56:00,92,We usually do about $20/person for the round trip.
