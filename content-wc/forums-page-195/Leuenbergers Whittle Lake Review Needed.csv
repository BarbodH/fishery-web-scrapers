5555418,md76c,2017-05-19 10:53:00,2,We just had our outfitter decide not to open his camps this year and found this to fit our dates. Looking for some kind of idea about the fishing there. We fish Walleyes predominately but would also like to know about Perch and Northerns.Any help would be appreciated. Need to book it soon.

They are great people and will be honest with you. We've been on many, many trips with them and while we haven't been to Whittle, all of the other lakes we've been to are all outstanding. We're headed to Whitefish this year. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't believe Whittle has perch. You should try and book Percy if you're after perch.Second thing I would do is check the Guestbook on their website, and contact anyone who you see has mentioned Whittle Lake. That has worked well for me in the past. Hopefully you also get some responses right here on Walleye Central.I do know that the cabin at Whittle is very nice, and probably the nicest of all the Leuenberger cabins. I believe that's because Whittle is the lake that the Leuenberger family uses when they want to go fishing. Our group hasn't been to Whittle only because of the lake size. We usually shoot for 2,500+ acre lakes, and Whittle is 1,600 acres."
