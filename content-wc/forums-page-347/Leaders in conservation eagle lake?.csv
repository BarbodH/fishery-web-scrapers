Steven J. Herbeck, of Mineral Point, Wis., pleaded guilty to the offence under Ontario fisheries regulations. The fish were donated to charity. On July 17, 2007, Ministry of Natural Resources conservation officers from Dryden District conducted a fisheries enforcement blitz on Eagle Lake, about 30 km west of Dryden. Officers inspected Andy Myers Lodge, owned and operated by Herbeck, and found 40 walleye in the lodge's main freezer. Herbeck told the officers the fish had been left behind by guests who had returned home to the U.S. He took responsibility for possessing the over-limit of fish. Justice of the Peace Raymond Zuliani heard the case Nov. 19 in Dryden.

2362962,stevie,2014-01-18 14:41:00,21,"really??? you are from the area and know the real story. enough is enough 14 guests,3 vehicles,3 coolers in the freezer with names and cabin #'s, under limit no over slot fish. left at 3;00 am,in rush forgot to get coolers out of main freezer. gave warden all names, carbons of lic.,and phone #'s. all where contacted immediately and confirmed they had forgotten them. they were informed they could possibly be charged with abandonment. good family people who have been coming to canada for generations and they would have quit coming had they had to go through that ordeal. since the fish were actually in possession something had to be done one way or the other so i asked them to give me/resort the ticket. the guests have been forever grateful and now still return every year and spend money throughout the community not just the resort. 40 fish,1500.00,the actual fine is over 200.00 per fish for individuals and double for commercial. they knew they were not for camp fish frys as some who use fish from the lake for because we had 10 yrs of weekly reciepts for commercially purchased fish and the the way they were pkgd/labeled.1-3 sweeps per season ,20 yrs,50+ freezer checks, not one time was a guest even 1 fish over limit. i commend the MNR for the common sense and handling of this matter. make of it what you will i feel no guilt and sleep just fine regarding this matter. steve"
