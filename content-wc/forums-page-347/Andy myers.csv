2348930,kzoofisher,2014-01-14 03:46:00,5144,I would bet that the new owners are going to provide a very high level of service and accommodation this year to try and put the bad pub behind the lodge. Past experiences won't be applicable to this year except as far as in how that area of the lake is for fish. Would be a good year to try them out if you have never been. The new owners have nothing to do with the previous asfaik except they probably got a pretty good deal out of them.
2349498,bigwillies,2014-01-14 07:38:00,515,the new owners(julien and nikki) do not have any ties to the previous owners.julien actually worked at a lodge just down the lake since he has been a kid.he has been in the tourism buisiness for a very long time a would expext nothing but the best from him.also if any of those staffers still work there he would probably fire their dumb a@#es.

2350610,NP4ME,2014-01-14 12:46:00,378,"Breezy, I completely agree. And I heard Steve is still working at camp. Hopefully Julian will sever ties completely."
2351242,kzoofisher,2014-01-14 15:49:00,5144,Really disappointed that he still works at the lodge. I don't think that trying to poach and then buying a license when you are successful is in any way ethical. Shame on AML for putting him back on the same water. I hope they are at least keeping him on a short leash.
