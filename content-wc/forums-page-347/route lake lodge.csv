2352298,Pooch,2014-01-14 20:19:00,4619,We were there fifteen years or so ago. Not a bad camp. Pretty lake. It does have public access so you'll see other boats. It's not very remote in case that's what you are looking for. We did well there and at one of their portage lakes.Search the archives for more info on this forum.Pooch
