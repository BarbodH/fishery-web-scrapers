It's not as if the rules and regulations don't allow each of us to enjoy hunting and fishing. In my mind a lodge owner is there to assure his guests follow the law and protect the integrity of the resource. The penalities they suffered seem light to me but than again their justice is not in my hands. Mike Kansas

Unfortunately there are still quite a few hunters/fishermen who feel that rules shouldn't apply to them and they should be able to fish for and shoot whatever they want, whenever they want."
