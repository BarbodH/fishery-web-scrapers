Is that Neawagank? I was there on a crew installing foundations for a microwave tower, so fished it for 3 months, I haven't seen fishing like that again."

I'll be interested in hearing how you make out that's for sure.Sorry for the hijack but considering your outfitter, I'd be curious whether anyone can tell me anything about North Caribou lake. Will be fishing it the last week of June....Cheers"
2348210,phishfearme,2014-01-13 19:53:00,1242,note the date on the original post - a few years old. we never made it to neawagank - high water drove the outfitter to send us to Williams lake - see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...=williams+lake LarryS was at north caribou - I think he posted some info. note that there are two outfitters on NC - one is a lodge with an outpost (on the east side of the lake where larry was) and pete Johnson has a large outpost on the far west side of the huge lake. definitely big water. phish
2348234,Mike Borger,2014-01-13 20:02:00,1554,"Oops, that was an aspiring senior moment on my part.Regarding North Caribou, it actually is North Caribou Camp we're going to, not Pete Johnson's."
