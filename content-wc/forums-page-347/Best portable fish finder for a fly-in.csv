2346762,MrSimon,2014-01-13 13:44:00,922,The new PiranhaMax units for sale right now use a re-chargeable battery that only has an 8 hour life. I want one that takes AA or D batteries .... like the older ones. I guess I'll have to dig one up on eBay or Craigslist.
2346794,Mike Borger,2014-01-13 13:51:00,1554,If you move fast there's currently one single brand new Cuda 168 portable for sale on Amazon:http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-168-Port...+cuda+portable
2346906,MrSimon,2014-01-13 14:26:00,922,Thanks for the link!! But I'm already bidding on a Humminbird PiranhaMax 210 Portable on eBay. The auction ends tomorrow. I'm pretty sure I'll win considering I put in a max bid of I-HAVE-TO-HAVE-IT.
2347026,phishfearme,2014-01-13 14:54:00,1242,"if the new piranhamax's use rechargeable batteries, you may want to consider a solar charger. no personal experience but I've heard they work good. phish"

2348722,adempsey,2014-01-13 22:27:00,963,"You can always put a battery pack together yourself. Shouldn't be too hard. Basically, buy a holder that puts 8 AA batteries in series to give you 12V and [at least] 2 Amp hours of capacity. You just need one of those sonar units that doesn't pull in a lot of current. I think the PirahnaMax 150/160 run at 100mA, so 20 [or more] hours off of 8 AA's."
2350434,cowboyd,2014-01-14 11:39:00,33,I know this is a pretty old thread but seems there is still interest. I have been taking portables up for a long time and I agree you can make almost any of them portable. My current unit is a Humminbird 797. All the bells and whistles from mapping to down/side imaging. Key is battery life Mostly drain comes from the back light on your screen so if you keep it down to the minimum for you eyes it helps a great deal. The other functions draw too but not as significantly. I always take two batteries up with me and keep one on the charger. The solar chargers work if you get a good one but lengthy charge times can be an issue esp if you don't have good direct light. They will charge in cloudy conditions but not nearly as fast. Over the years I have used all sorts of tranducer mounts from suction cups to clamp on alum adjustable depth rigs ( very nice but be careful of the size of the mounting plate not only for the drag on the general 9.9 powered boats but also resistance spray....pretty but useless and wet!) The suction cups work just fine but make sure you put a safety strap from the mount to the boat keeping it short enough to keep it out of the props if it releases. ( yes a lessoned learned the hard way) Good luck Cowboyd
1791426,Walleye_Guru,2013-05-20 17:37:00,62,"As long as you can recharge the battery, you absolutely, unequivocally cannot beat the Lowarance HDS5. I gutted an old tackle box and mounted the gimbal bracket and two 12v batteries in it. One battery should last an entire day, and having the track & waypoint option is priceless! Another bonus is being able to scroll backwards on the sonar page and place waypoints in locations you’ve all ready traveled over. Drawbacks – it’s a little heavier and you need to be able to recharge the batteries. I’ve run this unit in small boat situations for 3 years and wouldn’t trade it for the world!PS – remember to bring a couple of marker buoys, trying to back troll around a waypoint on a screen can be downright maddening"
1794618,fosterthedog,2013-05-21 14:02:00,51,"Whatever you decide on turn your backlight down to 0% during the day, up as needed during dark or lowlight conditions. I used to use two 6 volt lantern batteries hooked up in parallel, bought a smaller lithium battery this year charged(2 amp trickle charger) and tested it ran for 8 days and nights on 0% backlight. Have a great trip."
1797954,ameoba,2013-05-22 12:55:00,105,"What about using a Vexilar or Marcum (if you have one)? If all you are looking for is depth and structure, they would work great - especially having a lot easier control over sensitivity. Both Vex and Marcum have portable (suction cup) mount 'ducers. Just saying if you already have one for the ice, it would be an easy way to go."
1815546,weston,2013-05-28 18:26:00,18,"ice fishing flashers work awesome on fly-outs, I guide and do a least 50 daily fly-outs a season the batteries full charged will last 3 or 4 days depending on your gain settings. Also you can take your ice transducer and set in the bottom of the boat and it will shoot thru the hull just fine, you will read bottom and fish wide open with out having to secure it on the transom."
1815618,zeebee,2013-05-28 18:52:00,1144,lots of good options here. key seems to avoid bells & whistles and place reliability and weight/volume considerations foremost. on fly-ins it's really about depth and not fish IDing. any unit that gives you depth and battery life is all that's needed. as a matter of fact that's all that's needed in any situation. knowledge with fishing like most things comes with time/experience; you think you can buy it off the shelves but it aint so. enjoy the trip.
1816162,eyemike,2013-05-28 21:21:00,233,The fly-in I'm going to has electric start motors. My though was to run alligator clips to the battery and just leave my gel battery from my portable at home. Will I get a lot of interference doing this?
1817449,adempsey,2013-05-29 09:27:00,963,Not likely. That's how you would normally set it up anyway. That's really the ideal scenario.
2346410,MrSimon,2014-01-13 12:09:00,922,"I've been looking at the current line-up of portable fish finders from Humminbird and Lowrance, but I'm not seeing what I want. I want a small portable unit that takes AA batteries, but one that doesn't have some huge gaudy built in clamp system like the Humminbird Fish'n Buddy series. It seems most of the units I like have a built in battery that needs charged. I don't want that. Any ideas?"
2346618,Mike Borger,2014-01-13 13:00:00,1554,"If you can find an older Eagle Cuda that's pretty much exactly what you're looking for.Super lightweight, runs on AA batteries and at least in my experience perfectly suitable for the task.Even the cheapy 128 Cuda will serve the purpose perfectly.They're discontinued but can found if you're persistent."
2346682,phishfearme,2014-01-13 13:20:00,1242,"the hummingbird piranhamax portable series fits you bill well also. new ones are about $150-$160 on ebay. uses 8 AA and have lasted almost the entire 10 day ""weeks"" we do. phish"

It's heavy, finicky and downright annoying. It's not the one posted above, but similar.I've rented boats that used a piece of scrap wood with the transducer mounted on it and attached to the boat with a C-Clamp. That setup was far superior than the hunk of junk I bought."

The transducer is mounted on a short piece of hardwood flooring (left over from our house that he built in 1962) that I C-clamp to the transom. He passed away in 1987. My way of continuing to have him along on fishing trips."
1782297,ram41569,2013-05-17 08:08:00,125,"Humminbird 798 with Si, built in Gps with Cabalas portable transducer bracket. I use this setup while I reservoir fish. Also get a small cooler to mount a small 12v battery that you can also get from Cabalas. I mount the sonar bracket on the lid of the cooler and just flip the lid over and connect your sonar and wires and you ready for action. The battery will last all day even with the GPS."
1782385,Papa eye,2013-05-17 08:36:00,124,"Don't overthink this. Get a portable that uses 8aa batteries. Take a spare set of batteries. Turn it off when running across the lake. No color no GPS, just depth. Everything else is battery drain. You will have no problem finding the spot on the spot. I also have an old garmin hand held GPS that I wear around my neck, and mark spots, but mostly it gives conference to explore. After 100+ days on the water, the suction style keeps working for me. Just remeber its there and Be sure to tie It down. I have used mine on camp boats, canoes, ice and on our fibreglass ski boat.Good luck.PS if you take good locking vice grips you can mcGivor almost anything to mount the transducer, if you don't have a suction type."
1782713,Kmanster,2013-05-17 10:13:00,26,"Have used for years on both drive-in and Fly-in trips. No cords, C-Claps, etc. Just mount the holder and you can put in and out as needed. Batteries last almost 5 full days. We do turn it off if we are just anchored to save on juice. Just my 2 cents, you will not be disappointed with this set-up. Also, I use a hand held GPS which is easier to hold or set on the seat and navigate by.

1788521,catran3,2013-05-19 19:23:00,29,I just found a 1 year old Humminbird 120 on Craigslist for $80 just a few miles from my house. Called the guy and offered him $60 and he took it. Not sure if I need it but I figured for 60 bucks I couldn't go wrong. It looks almost new and he gave me the box it came in. Now if I could just afford a fly out fishing trip I'd be set!
1762665,Hawkfan,2013-05-10 08:10:00,237,"I've got a portable Eagle unit too and like others have said, can run more than the week on one set of D batteries. Has the options you need and is ready to go right out of the box. And be sure to use the little rope to tie the transducer to the handle on the back of the boat."
1763953,Jaskonie,2013-05-10 16:07:00,80,"the little piranha 1 thru 5 are the best on aa batteries and are light. the suction cup works good on alum boats. I have one here you can have cheap just used on trips up north. I have switched to the piranhamax bagged units with gelcell batteries because we drive in, I also use color now and they drain the aa batteries quick."
1765353,phishfearme,2013-05-11 06:58:00,1242,zeebee is right on the money - a failed sounder on a flyin (especially on a new lake) which happened to us one trip was like fishing blind. look around for a cheap backup - I got two hummingbird piranha max 210's on ebay for about $70 each and that (along with getting the best raingear I could find) is about the best thing you can do on a flyin. these take 8 AA batteries and will pretty much last the entire trip - but we always bring a backup set of batteries. zeebee is also right on the money about rechargeable batteries (forget them) and about steel wooling the spot where the suction cup is placed - it's almost like he's been on one of our trips - BUT we ALWAYS tie off the suction cup - steel wooled or not. only thing I would add is to spend some time during setup of the sounder on day one to place the transducer cable out of the way and the excess length spooled up and tied off. you don't want to step on this or pinch it while closing a tackle box lid. phish
1765401,Blue Lk,2013-05-11 07:45:00,269,"I mount my transducer to a length of 1x4 & use visegrips or a small C-clamp to attach to transom,much more secure than suction cup mount."
1766649,zeebee,2013-05-11 17:45:00,1144,Been there done and it works fine it but on fly-ins we be minimalists as weight/space/practicality is always a compromise. Hard enuff I try and stuff my kid into a duffle bag undetected. Last year he whinedthe breathing hole was too small.....is there no end to their complaining????
1767449,Mike Borger,2013-05-12 06:16:00,1554,Me too. A little piece of wood and a c clamp weigh nothing either.
1769273,independence_66217,2013-05-12 19:31:00,1,Cabelas has a portable transducer bracket that solves all of your problems with the suction cup. I have used it three years and with no problems on my fly ins.

1779321,Mohleye,2013-05-16 07:27:00,368,"I still use the suction cup, and find that if it's wet when applied, and slid around a little to make sure the seal is good and tight, I don't have any problems. But I've learned the hard way that they can come loose AND even if tied off, if you don't notice right away they can spin to the point of breaking a wire, at which point it's useless."
1747977,gonefishing13,2013-05-06 05:39:00,46,"I have never used one before on a fly-in trip, but am thinking about getting one for this year.

1748041,octanehi5,2013-05-06 05:55:00,1104,"there is no best one, you may want to try the eagle cuda portables"
1748289,ftfarms,2013-05-06 07:19:00,444,I would just buy a cheap one if depths all your wanting. I have a the humminbird 120 and a eagle not sure on the model of the eagle I got them for fly outs and both work great for that.
1748641,rsiminski,2013-05-06 09:11:00,53,I have the Humminbird Piranha Max 230. It works great and runs on 8 AA batteries. It has been faithful and works awesome. I have used it on 2 fly-in's. Very compact and you dont have to lug around a bulky battery which eats up your weight for the plane. I think I paid $200 bucks for it but it was well worth it. I dont really use it to mark fish just to check the lake structure.
1748817,SinOrSwim,2013-05-06 09:44:00,1528,Not sure what you use at home but you can buy a portable case and make almost any fish finder portable. That is what I did with my Hummingbird 595. It's sort of a battery hog but I love having GPS to mark spots. Nice to have the GPS when navigating through rocky areas as well.I got a roll up solar panel that is flexible and light. It's like one of those plastic cutting boards you can roll up. I attach that to the battery and I can fish all day on one charge. Works great. The other battery is at the cabin charging off the house batteries all day.
1748977,jambi,2013-05-06 10:18:00,504,"I have this one as well. This will be my third year to use it; batteries lasted all week but I do bring a second set. Marks structure great, and marks fish surprisingly well. I pack this in a plastic ammo can."

1749361,adempsey,2013-05-06 12:00:00,963,"If you are concerned about weight, look for a model with the lowest power draw that uses AA batteries.If you don't care about weight, it won't matter as long as you can charge the 12V Gel cell battery(ies). I'd probably check out the various Humminbird PiranhaMAX and Eagle Cuda/Fisheasy models. The PiranhaMAX 210 and 230 run off of AA batteries. Although, I think most of the Eagle models are discontinued and replaced with Lowrance models. You can also convert any model to run off of alkaline batteries with a battery pack. Just be conscientious of the power draw."
1761433,zeebee,2013-05-09 18:39:00,1144,"So dependant am I on my depthfinder on fly-ins that I take two with one serving backup. Both of mine, one an older Eagle, the other a newer DSI Lowrance, take 8 D size batts that will last better than a week of 10 hrs a day on time. I don't trust rechargeable units as eventually they lose their capacity to recharge and then what? At $10 a week for D size batts its the way to go. As for securing the suction cup transducer, best advice I came across was cleaning the mounting surface with fine steel wool before pressing the rubber cup on.......holds like it should. If that suction cup transducer comes off at full throttle it can pull the finder right outta the boat; caught mine once worthy of a MLB highlite reel. No harm in tying on a safety string with little play to the unit. Bells and whistles are frivolous on a fly-in....its all about depth ID in the end."
1761641,J.Iverson,2013-05-09 19:58:00,64,"one that does NOT have a built in GPS, running the antenna will drain your battery quick. The fly ins we do have solar power, so it needs to last. hand held works fine on AAs for that."
