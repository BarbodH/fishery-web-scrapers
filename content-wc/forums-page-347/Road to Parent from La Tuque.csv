2335506,TheDFP,2014-01-09 08:29:00,39,"Is there a gas station in Clova? Yes: but they also serve food, groceries, bait, train stop...... Nice little place and we get breakfast there before flying out!"
2336449,Andre (wallyandre),2014-01-09 12:45:00,2274,"If you need anything else, let me know"
2337073,Freytown,2014-01-09 15:44:00,770,"Ferrispata, if this is your first trip on Quebec logging roads beware of the dust, lol. It's like flour when the roads are dry. If you have a pick-up w/cap make sure you put things in plastic garbage bags, you won't be sorry. Been there, done that."
2337249,keek,2014-01-09 16:20:00,1003,"I also take a bottle of windex, a roll of paper towels and a spare gallon of washer fluid."
2351034,canyon,2014-01-14 14:52:00,37,Are you trailering your own boat up? These roads( especially as you get closer to the outfitters) can eat trailers if they are not in good shape.
2351922,Ferrispata,2014-01-14 18:41:00,63,"No trailer, we are doing a fly-in."
2330593,Ferrispata,2014-01-07 13:54:00,63,"We will be going to Clova for an Air Tamarac fly-in to Lac Hebert this summer and it appears that our route will be going up the NYS Thruway (from NYC direction) and by Montreal. We were told that it would be easier to go to La Tuque from that direction instead of to Mont-St. Michel, because we could avoid Montreal and save some time. Has anyone ever gone this route and if so, what are the roads like (particularly from La Tuque to Parent, but also up to La Tuque if any issues)? Thanks in advance. Jerry"
2331001,Freytown,2014-01-07 15:27:00,770,You should stay on 15 to Mont Tremblant. Going to La Tugue is going to make the trip longer. Just my opinion.
2331785,canyon,2014-01-07 19:49:00,37,We drive the LaTuque road every year. The road is in good shape. From Latuque to Wemotaci is great and you can average about 70-80 km/h(45-50 mph). On from Wemotaki to Parent it is a little bumpy in spots and so an average of 50-60 km/h( 30-40 mph). If you are coming up from NY state go up through Montreal. Thats a long way around going to LaTuque. Drivng though Montreal is not that bad. I have done both ways and the only reason i have done both is that forest fires had closed the road from LaTuque to Parent one year. The main thing will be that you will be on the gravel roads less going through Mpntreal-Mont Laurier-Parent-Clova than you would all the way over to LaTuque then back through. On a side notethere are LARGE logging trucks on these roads too. They pose no problems but can be intimidating the first time you see one coming at you. Good luck and have fun. I love the Gouin!
2332306,Ferrispata,2014-01-08 06:37:00,63,Thanks for the info. I thought going through Montreal looked the best. Any one else with some input? We cannot wait to get up there. Will be a trip of a lifetime for us. Although I am pretty sure we will be back periodically.
2332482,mr-fish,2014-01-08 07:42:00,58,"Never any problems going through Montreal ... Budget extra time for the boarder crossing ... Busy crossing with Montreal so close ... You can follow signs to St. Jerome to keep you going in the right direction on 15 through Montreal ... Biggest thing about the dirt roads is they have some terrible wash boards ... Bad on the straightaways ... Heart stopping on the turns ... Mount Laurier is a decent sized town, definitely gas up there.."
2333098,retire55,2014-01-08 11:40:00,1029,"According to a search on Google, the driving time from La Tuque to Parent (217 km) is a little over 7 hours while the driving time from Mont Saint Michel to Parent (178 km) is 5 hours. I can not speak to the validity of the driving time from La Tuque to Parent. I have made the drive from Mont Saint Michel to Parent - the gravel road was in good shape. If the roads are very dry, just watch out for the logging trucks because they create a complete dust out."
2333282,Ferrispata,2014-01-08 12:46:00,63,"From multiple sources, I have heard it is about 3.5 hrs to Clova from Mont St Michel I think (gravel roads). I just got word from Air Tamarac that there is a new road from La Tuque (unless I misunderstood) and it would also be 3-3.5 hours. She said ""good road""."
2333506,canyon,2014-01-08 14:03:00,37,That is an accurate time for LaTuque to Parent. 3- 3.5 hours. One thing last year that we noticed is that with a lot of rain there were some washouts on the edges of the roads. If you hit them you could be asking for a trip into the woods. When able stay to the center of the roads. That was the first time in five years that I had seen them though.
2334082,Andre (wallyandre),2014-01-08 17:28:00,2274,"There is a new (4-5 years) road from La Tuque; that road is very well maintain for the 1st 50 miles or so because it is maintain by Hydro-Quebec (our electric gov. electric power company) but after that it's a regular gravel road.Coming from the I 87N I will definitely going to Mont St-Michel. Once in Mont St-Michel there is a Shell station and I will recommend to fill-up there. You don't need to drive to Mt-Laurier, you can take a short-cut before Mt-Laurier. For safety if a member of you're group still got a CB radio bring it and you will see taking the gravel road a sign stating: ch 9; the reason being, the wood truck hauler always announce where they are and you announce where you are; on the side of the road there is some numbers on a blue sign, so you just announce that there is a truck going north at: km 22 or 43 etc... it's a lot safer and relax for everybody.Crossing Montreal is not that bad depending on time of the day. I would recommend crossing town before 6am. that time is valid on the week but on the w-end it is not bad at all.To cross the border it's also not that bad but if you are on a long w-end that it is another story; if somebody have access to internet via a smart phone you can get the waiting time to cross and if there is to much attend for you're patience you can take exit 41 and at the light turn right; fill-up you're gas tank because it's going to be the last cheap gallon. Once you are on that road, 2 lights and turn left toward Lacolle and you are going to cross at a smaller border gate, that is less busy (habitually) after the gate the 1st sign you see for 10 North you turn left and you are going back on the highway 10 North."
2335106,Ferrispata,2014-01-09 06:49:00,63,"Thanks Andre (and others). Sounds like that is the right route for us. I saw that short cut you mentioned so as not to go all the way to Mont Laurier. Will definitely gas up in Mont-Saint-Michel as you mentioned. Looks like we will be crossing into Canada around late morning on a Sat. (maybe around 11am). On a side note, is there a particular place that anyone stops to get beer in Quebec (if you opt to buy it there instead of bringing it into the Canada)?And is there a gas station in Clova also?Is there any one route across Montreal that is better than the others? Or just 15 over bridge then connects to 117?I don't think any of us have a CB.Jerry"
