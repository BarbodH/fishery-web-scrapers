2327354,tooski,2014-01-06 15:19:00,393,"Also if you do a remote trip, be it fly-in or boat in, be prepared for those rainy or unfishable days. You can only clean your tackle box so many times. A couple good books for those possibilities is a must..."
2339618,MrSimon,2014-01-10 12:31:00,922,"There is definitely something to be said for experiencing a Canadian fishing trip 100% on your own terms. Some guys are cut out for it ... some aren't. If you think you might like it, then I say DO IT. Just take the right safety precautions and if you hate it, just go home early."
2346986,dogrodder,2014-01-13 14:43:00,400,Most of my fishing time both local and in Canada is solo. Things are very simple when you are out by yourself.
2310098,BornToFish,2013-12-31 11:56:00,1224,"I fish several times each season in NW Ontario. My wife accompanies me in August, when the weather is friendlier to her. We very much enjoy each other's company and have a grand vacation together. I fish solo during my spring and autumn fishing trips. I very much enjoy my own company. I seldom get into an argument with myself about anything. I get up when I want and stay out as long as I want. I can explore the lake and try different techniques without being concerned about others being bored. I've met many nice people at the Lodge that I fish from. I sometimes take newcomers out on the lake and show them the lake or how to fish more effectively. I've made many friends by asking them to a shore-lunch. I enjoy fishing with others, but I also enjoy fishing solo!"
2310529,Freytown,2013-12-31 16:01:00,770,Did my first solo last spring...700 miles from home. I loved it and will never worry about doing it again. PS: no arguments or disputes.

2311282,pjshorthorn,2014-01-01 06:19:00,5654,"Taken a few trips on Lac Seul ( literal interpretation is Lake Alone) by myself. I had always wanted to fish late September and made the trip alone the first time due to lack of interest from the rest of the normal gang. Every trip has been a great experience and literally ""off the grid"" for 7-10 days. I would agree that this type of trip may not be for everyone, but you never know unless you give it a whirl. I've stayed in familiar camps, fished known water, always filed a float plan with the outfitter each day and just enjoyed the solitude, scenery and a deserved break from all of the normal responsibilities in life. Not having a daily plan or a set schedule each day was a pleasant change from the group trip. I plan on taking more solo trips in the future when I feel the need to completely unplug."
2313849,zeebee,2014-01-01 22:08:00,1144,"Hey, since all the posters like solo trips, why don't we all do one together?"
2316881,BuckeyeBill,2014-01-03 08:30:00,76,Just wondering how the camp/lodge owners accommodate a single person? I may find myself in the same situation this year. First year of retirement and usually go with family but not sure of their interest. I'm going !!
2317249,Pooch,2014-01-03 10:21:00,4619,"I was thinking the same thing. I have fished alone a fair amount when the wife would rather set in the cabin and read. I kind of liked it for a change. I can fish anywhere and anyway I want. I can spend a whole morning experimenting and trying locations without needing to ""be on fish"" all the time for whomever my boat partner is that day.One of my good buddies stayed on after the rest of us went home on Savant several years ago in the fall. He said it was a little eerie to be out on 90,000 acres of water and probably be the only one in camp or on the lake. Just a little unnerving and took some getting used to. Said he never saw another boat after we went home.I wouldn't hesitate a moment to go alone. There's a lot to be said for solitude.Pooch"
2317761,tiz,2014-01-03 12:59:00,18,"I sent out several emails to resorts across Ontario requesting a single rate in September. I knew not to ask during peak season, and I can respect their policies, they are a business. If you can do last minute or off peak Sept/Oct, you should be able to find something. Also try the resorts that have motel rooms for 50 or 70 a night. Some have stoves and tables inside the rooms so eating out is not needed. I got very lucky and was treated to a great deal. I want to say where to thank them, but don't know if they want every single calling and saying they want the rate they gave me."
2327082,Guest,2014-01-06 14:09:00,0,"Man, thanks for all the replies. Going to Canada alone is not as rare as I thought it might be."
2327106,dutchboy,2014-01-06 14:16:00,5717,You need to keep in mind how many people go. The percentage of those going alone would be low I would think.
2309002,btmbncr,2013-12-31 02:07:00,492,Some of the best trips included greenhead mallard breasts and walleye filets fried in butter while it had just started snowing.It was me and my dog in Saskatchewan in alot of Octobers.Bill
2309130,Golden Eagle,2013-12-31 06:38:00,2642,"I've made several October trips when I was the only person in camp. Each day I took along extra food and my sleeping bag in a plastic bag. My lab was my partner on several trips. One September our party was fishing Cobham River Outpost when I had the pilot on our return flight to drop me off at Little Vermilion Lake. The camp at LV was shut down for the week so I had the pilot notify the outfitter know I was in camp and had one of my party to let my wife know that I'd be home, later. A few days into the week my outfitter buzzed me, which meant for me to bring in a couple of extra walleyes for dinner. I went home for two weeks and somehow found myself back at LV, with my lab, for another October solo trip. I left when moose hunters arrived for the gun season. I did not plan the trip, but hit the speed dial Wednesday at noon to find a float plane ride and was out of my driveway the next morning at 4 a.m., with no wake up call, for the 1500 mile drive to Red Lake. Caught a 4 p.m. Friday flight for Little Vermilion. Got into some walleyes about 100 yards from camp for Friday dinner. Went solo to LV in 2012 and enjoyed a 12"" snow October 5, 2012. Took my wife with me September 2013. Went early to avoid cold weather so she could better enjoy fishing. No scheduled flight for this one, so I got to town and started looking for a ride. Got one a few hours later, at no charge, since the plane was headed north for several short runs. Pilot was pleased with a $50 tip for my 15 minute ride. He was scheduled to make 12 runs that day, all short to drop off moose hunters where there were no docks, only rocky shorelines. My post is too long and I've mentioned part of it on a previous thread. Somehow I'm enjoying thinking back on this day when I'm missing NW Ontario. I'll be back May 17, 2014, maybe a week early for pike fishing. Missed walleye opener in 2013 for first time in 29 years due to ice on lake. Went in 5 days later for a 9 day stay."
2309586,tiz,2013-12-31 08:36:00,18,"I just booked a week on Cedar Lake in Sept/14. I am taking this trip alone and I am really looking forward to the peacefulness and relaxing a little. Over the last several years I have been to Disney World (multiple times), Miami, Hilton Head, Destin, and even made the drive from Atlanta to Los Angeles, 6500 miles for those wondering, with the family. After hearing, ""Can't you just fish down the road"" to ""Do they have video games and WiFi"" I knew it was time to head North alone. This year I turn 50, plan on retiring from the police department after 24 years, anticipate starting a new career, and chasing muskie and walleye on Cedar Lake. Love my family, need my family, looking forward to a week away from said family. Two bottles of Templeton Rye whiskey, a box of Padron cigars, rods, reels, tackle, and some clothes. Unlike the above trips, should take 15 minutes to pack everything and counting down the days....."
2309690,Fisherman Ted,2013-12-31 09:23:00,461,"Nearly every evening in the summer I slip away from the lodge and silently drift on the lake, casting a fly on the glass surface only interrupted by fish exploding to the surface. Best part of my summer."
2309754,Pymbet,2013-12-31 09:43:00,42,"Maybe it was just dumb luck, but in 1994 I went up for a solo trip with my kayak and fishing gear. Picked a random lake not too far off a logging road and trailed a crawler harness for an hour and caught four 21"" walleye. While not the biggest or most, it was pretty cool pulling in those fish from a kayak -- and cooking one up for dinner while camping on an island. I don't go up by myself anymore, but I am sure glad I did that time. We (buddies and family) have been back to that lake (or a second one connected to it that is full of decent pike) almost every year going on 20 years now."
2309786,Blackmacs,2013-12-31 10:12:00,2121,A guy I used to work with would go to Canada alone quite often. They were some of the most relaxing times his wife ever had.
2309850,Skywagon,2013-12-31 10:26:00,1106,When I got up this morning is was -31 F with a wind chill of -49 F. Think there will be will be plenty of time for you guys to get your tackle boxes in order. Who did you ride out to camp with this fall Connie?
2309994,Guest,2013-12-31 11:11:00,0,"Years ago I took a solo trip to the Ottawa river in the Westmeath area. I camped and fed myself on fish and a few other food items I brought with me. I was new to the area but managed to catch a fair number smallmouth, walleye, channel cats and pike in that descending order. It was an interesting area to fish, with still water, back bays and current areas around islands. When I returned home, I tested three species of fish on my family for dinner. Channel cat won!"
2310042,Golden Eagle,2013-12-31 11:31:00,2642,"Went to camp on a Beaver and back to Red Lake on the Caravan. Landed on hard surface with wheels down for a quiet landing. Gave my driver a smile when the recording said, ""Wheels down for landing""."

2308026,Guest,2013-12-30 15:40:00,0,"This past summer I booked a trip to a remote outpost in Canada and since I couldn't find anybody to come along I went alone. I had never done that before but decided life is too short, go for it. Have had about 25 trips to Canada with the family or guys over the years. Thought a trip alone would be slightly weird but could be interesting. Well I had the time of my life and enjoyed it much more than I ever imagined I would. I have already booked the same trip for next year. I fish alone a lot on the home waters in sconie and sota so I knew I would be used to that. What I didn't realize was how much I would enjoy the complete silence and solitude. Had no problems at the border, if the border agent thought it was strange he didn't bring it up. One issue had me a bit concerned was if the boat or I broke, how could I contact the lodge for help? Next year will be taking a satellite phone along to cover that possibility. Anybody else do this and enjoy it?"
2308161,dutchboy,2013-12-30 16:02:00,5717,"What could be better then pulling up to shore on a bright warm sunny afternoon and taking a nap without worrying what other people in the boat might think?Crowds and friends are vastly over rated. I spend lots of time alone in the boat, I find it very, very relaxing."
2308177,btmbncr,2013-12-30 16:06:00,492,"I have made several trips to Canada alone,hunting and fishing.I always had my dog accompany me.Bill"
2308345,Limeyangler,2013-12-30 17:00:00,563,"Fishing solo is awesome. Like someone else said .nobody to worry about except yourself ..and unless one of you volunteers to swim back, if the boat breaks you are no better off with 2 people in most cases in terms of contacting base .but at least you have someone to feed to the hungry bear!"
2308673,tooski,2013-12-30 19:06:00,393,Apparently alone would be preferable to fishing with Limey- but yes I have made several and really enjoyed them...
2308721,wallydave,2013-12-30 19:28:00,2151,"June 2013 my wife made the trip to Lac Seul with me. She does not fish, but she went out with a couple days. The rest of the time I was solo fishing. Kind of the best of both worlds, showing her how beautiful Ontario is, got some good fishing in too. Would I fish solo for real, I just might!"
2308745,Guest,2013-12-30 19:42:00,0,"I take my wife with me but spend most of my time fishing alone since she only cares to fish one time a day and for not very long. Over the years have seen many people go it alone and they seem to have a great time. Normally if you want, there is usually some group in camp that would be will to have you go along with them or even go with you. In the evening it usually fun to go around camp and meet the guests staying there and vising and getting to know them (something that is not very easy to do if you are with your on group). Only down side is meals you will generally be all by yourself and that might be more quiet than you want and the biggest bummer is that you are paying the entire cost yourself which means gas up and back. If those things don't bother you than I would recommend it is worth giving a try if you can't find someone to go vs staying home. Plus you can't blaming anybody for not getting the net in time. Happy New Year to all and have safe travels to and from."
2308921,zeebee,2013-12-30 21:58:00,1144,"There is risk on any solo trip to a remote outpost. From boat breakdown to a myriad of accidents. If you are prepared to take the risk then at least go in prepared with a satellite phone and good first aid kit. I do solo's but fly-in to a remote lodge where I can fish alone and bask in the solitude while having the comfort of knowing there are other guests at the lodge.The most stressful trips are with young kids cause if anything happens to you, they could be on their own until the return flight comes in. I did one with my son when he was about 8 and thereafter, for the next few years I went with another father/son team until my son was old enough to again make a two man trip. I still however love fishing on my own as I am stubborn when it comes to preferred techniques... love to troll and despise jigging. Obviously, not everyone shares my preferences."
2308930,castnblast,2013-12-30 22:19:00,111,"i always fish alone with my dog when fly fishing rivers for steelhead or brook trout. When on the lake, the dog id there and usually someone else is in the boat. Fishing alone especially when wading rivers is a much preffered way to spend the day"
2308978,Tamarack,2013-12-30 23:40:00,16,We have guests come alone every year and they just love it. Have a great 2014 everyone and tight lines.
