2355306,zeebee,2014-01-15 18:46:00,1144,"Got an invite today to go fish 'bows on the Nipigon River system this spring. All the rainbows I ever caught were incidental when I use to troll for Kings around Manitoulin Isle in Lake Huron some 25 years ago. It was made clear to me that the invite was quite an honor as this group has been tight for some 10 years and Im the 1st new inductee.....sounds more to me like Im buying the bulk of the refreshments. In any event, havent the foggiest of tackle/technique. They say they float roe bags....I think I once one nighted something that rhymes with that when I was 17 and drunk. At least thats what my buddies referred to her as and my mom whispered somethin similar when I brought her home at 2AM to introduce her as the ""woman Im gonna marry"". So what if she was 43...she said she used expensive wrinkle creme.As for the fishin, should be a hoot and I have some time to research and get ready. Any help out there would be appreciated. As a start what kinda waders should I get? Would I look silly with those arm mounted swimmy inflatable wings...Im thinkin Disney theme? Free Willy or something so I dont look too conspicuous and outta place."

2355946,zeebee,2014-01-16 04:55:00,1144,Forget about any comment regarding the wrinkle creme ...woke up the next morn and discovered it didnt work too well. Mom made pancakes but they were all really burnt. Asked for two paper bags.

I've always called it ""the great equalizer"" because it allows relative newbies with a small amount of rigging knowledge to catch fish.If you're able to aquire some fresh trout eggs and subsequently tie them up that would be a fantastic choice. In a large clear river like the Nipigon I'd be going with mostly white and peach colored netting, but chartreuse always seems to work as well especially in the spring.Floatfishing a large river like that means bumping everything up a bit. Starting with a larger float in 9 to 11 gram range, and more and larger split shot. They're really very easy fish to catch and the biggest mistake beginners will make is simply not getting their bait deep enough. This is especially critical in a large, deep flast flowing river like the Nipigon. When floatfishing it's always best to run a heavier mainline on your spinning reel (assuming that's your gear of choice) with your float and all your split shot pegged on that, then a lighter fluorocarbon tippet with your hook and bait. I'd recommend running a mainline of 10lb test, with a 6lb fluorocarbon tippet. There's a plethora of fluoro tippet on the market but I'm partial to Drennan.Keep your hooks on the small side, I personally prefer sedge style hooks in 10's and 12's for the vast majority of my fishing.Lightly hook the roe bag just under the mesh, don't embed the hook right in the middle.If roe isn't available there are several great alternatives for you to consider. Ultralight marabou jigs are lethal drifted under a float. For the nipigon I'd stick to ones that are predominantly white. Small pink plastic worms also have a following and are pretty deadly.On big rivers like that perhaps the most fun you'll have isn't floatfishing though it's casting heavy bodied spinners and spoons. I would definitely not go there without having one rod rigged and ready for that. For the last number of years I've been running 20lb Suffix 832 on my hardware rod which is a fast action custom built 11'er. I don't run the braid direct to my lure, instead I tie a 2-3' section of 10 or 12lb fluoro.For the Nipigon small compact heavy spoons like the KO Wobbler should shine as well as heavy bodied #3 and #4 spinners. When tossing spinners stick with a silver blade. If you can find them the Mepps Longcast spinners would be perfect for this.Quarter cast either directly across from you or perhaps just slightly upstream. Let the lure sink a bit then reel in slowly trying to keep your line taut at all times. Never cast directly upstream in heavy current.Bear in mind the Nipigon is a very large river and much of your fishing may be done out of a boat. Most guides I know on big rivers like that will pull plugs for steelhead. Using lures such as the Luhr Jensen Hotshot or any other wobbling bannana style bait, they simply drop the lures back into a likely hole and very slowly move upstream, then drop back. Oftentimes it's highly effective to just sit motionless and allow the current to do the work for you. The fish are pretty aggressive in the spring when they're spawning and the hits are often pretty savage.Regarding waders if they're something you'll rarely use don't go crazy spending a ton of money. Still I'd highly recommend stockingfoot breathables. If I wear you I'd probably go with a cheaper Cabelas brand. They have some lower end breathables that are perfectly fine for your needs and the best part is their return policy. If you end up blowing them out and they leak you can return them no questions asked.Anyhow I could go on and on and on....LOL!If you have anymore specific questions especially on rigging or anything else for that matter shoot me a pm I'm happy to help.Cheers, Mike"
2356002,zeebee,2014-01-16 05:35:00,1144,This is a wealth of info...much more than I expected and I thank you for taking the time. I currently have 20lbs 832 on my Patriarch and have some 6lbs Seaguar floro somewhere. My invitees say they use real roe. Need to get a longer spinning rod as all the 9' I have are casting rods and all the spinning rods are 6.5'. I do like fast moving river fishing.....was fortunate as a kid to fish such a river for smallies. You learn to read the river.
2356250,skindzier,2014-01-16 07:18:00,137,"In Colorado we do real well on bows using Krocodile spoons (silver/orange seems to be the best). I caught my PB on one (28.5"", over 8 lbs)"
2356282,Mike Borger,2014-01-16 07:30:00,1554,"You're more than welcome! As an aside I have to say if I was fishing the Nipigon it would be for brook trout and not steelhead. It'd be a shame if you were there and didn't fish for them.Smaller heavy bodied spinners and spoons will work fine for brook trout, but the go to bait for most river regulars up there is what's locally called a ""jig fly"".More or less a brightly colored bucktail or feathered jig. Also highly effective is a version of the popular muddler minnow tied on a heavy jig head, brookies love them.Quarter cast upstream allow the jig to sink to the bottom and bounce it along giving it a few hops and twitches along the way.Here's an example of what I'm talking about:http://members.shaw.ca/amuir/lordoftheflies.htmlhttp://lakesuperiorstore.com/store/s....asp?catid=345"
