Do you use a controller? I can't imagine a panel of 5W or less would be sufficient to charge a battery within a reasonable time frame. Of course, I suppose you can have two batteries and alternate between them every day.Anyway, just curious. Thanks!"
2361090,SinOrSwim,2014-01-17 16:42:00,1528,I use a 5 watt powerfilm. I doubt it would charge the battery back up very quickly but I have a portable with color monitor and GPS that is a huge drain on the battery. I can't get a full day from one battery unless I have the panel hooked up to it at the same time. I just made little pigtails so I could plug both the fishfinder and the solar panel to the battery at the same time. It works great. I have one battery at the cabin charging and switch daily.This is like a flexible cutting board. Rolls up and weighs next to nothing.

2361234,Seanik,2014-01-17 17:20:00,218,"I also use a 5 watt solar charger, mine was purchased from Walmart for about 45.00, I don't use a controller. I have a Lowrance Elite 4 color combo and the 8 amp battery lasts more than a long day of fishing. I have 2 batteries bought on eBay 22.00 each, one on charge while the other is in use. The Lowrance unit displays the Battery voltage so I know when its low. Hi adempsey, Still looking for a micro sd card for the Lowrance unit, seriously thinking of selling it and replacing with a Humminbird unit. I will be at Lake Nagagami near Hornepayne and really like to have depth on the GPS chart. Regards, Seanik"
2361626,adempsey,2014-01-17 20:05:00,963,"Thanks for the reply guys.I figured if you used a 5W or less you'd have to basically ""work"" with it and not rely on it for a straight up charge unless you had multiple batteries. Perhaps having a 5W is a reasonable size as long as you plan properly and you don't need a controller for it.Having an inverter makes a lot of sense these days as well. Most outposts seem to have some form of power available.As for the Nagagami depth map, well the map on the Garmin chip is not the best. I ""drove through"" the islands if that says anything. It's reasonable enough though, but I think just having a decent printed map and any sonar would be fine. Although, feel free to invite me and pay my way and I will bring my GPS and map"
