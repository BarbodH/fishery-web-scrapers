2312602,davenathe,2014-01-01 14:01:00,113,Personal favorite. Rod has improved my results. Great for rigging walleye when using light weight and long snell.
2315017,SSH,2014-01-02 12:34:00,526,I really like my BassProShops Walleye AnglerÂ® Signature Series Spinning Rod for jigging.
2319225,nitroman,2014-01-04 07:11:00,368,"I actually use 2 different rods for jigging. One is a 6ft croix m/l with a phuelger arbor reel spooled with nanofil. That combo lets me pitch some light jig plastic combos a country mile while maintaining accuracy. The other is a Fennwick HMG at 6'5"" spooled with 8lb mono that I use when vertical jigging."
2326922,digjig,2014-01-06 13:34:00,146,I prefer a 6'6 St. Croix Avid in Medium-Light and fast action. I have is paired with a Quantum energy that came with 2 spools. One mono 8 lb and a braided 8 lb depending on water clarity.
2330049,cspierings,2014-01-07 10:54:00,230,You won't be disappointed. For the money its hard to beat that rod.
2344418,bigwalleye1,2014-01-12 15:58:00,2632,"Start heavy on the jig. Like 3/8 oz heavy. People think I'm nuts but in 25-30 fow I can move pretty fast and cover a lot of ground. I am not interested in a finesse bite. I want the stupid, active fish. When I HAVE to, I'll drop to 1/4 or 3/16 and finesse 'em, but I'd rather move to the next podn and of active ones, and run and gun. I'm in Canada to catch and release a boatload of fish, not finesse. I can finesse at home."
2346282,Steve Ediger,2014-01-13 11:34:00,97,"For years I wanted a St. Croix Legend Elite rod to use for jigging while on Lac Seul. Last year I found a great deal on one in a 6'-6"" med. light. I really like the rod but have a very hard time getting a good hook set with it. I am using braid so I know it isn't line stretch and my jigs are sharp. I am sure I would have been much happier with a med. weight rod. I have since gone back to using my two G Loomis IMX SJR 721 rods that I have had for nearly twenty years. In my opinion, these are without a doubt, the best jigging rods I have ever had in my hands. I still like my Legend Elite, just not for jigging. Steve"
2288098,btmbncr,2013-12-20 11:31:00,492,Jig fishing is my weakest presentation for walleyes.I want to get a rod specifically for vertical jigging and to pitch jigs/plastics towards the bank in the early season.Going to put a Plueger President on it with 6 pound braid.Was thinking about a Fenwick HMX or Aetos.What action and length would work best for this application.Any suggestions would be appreciated.Bill
2288162,Lovetofish,2013-12-20 12:23:00,458,I have a couple HMX rods. Medium power with fast action. One is 5'6 and the other 6' and fish them with jigs.
2288378,btyreprich,2013-12-20 13:51:00,1067,I suggest you also consider the Fisheagle Rods from Cabela's. I own several and am very satisfied with their performance and price. Will be buying another for the son this Christmas.
2288394,KTroller,2013-12-20 13:55:00,237,"ML/Fast or M/Fast 6'6"""
2288658,Blades-n-Beads,2013-12-20 16:23:00,484,"My personal fav would be 6'-6"" med light, fast. St.croix eyecon, fenwick also is a dandy rod."
2288866,zeebee,2013-12-20 17:57:00,1144,"I have the Aetos 6'6"" med fast and its a great rod for that application. Extremely sensitive and lightweight. Versatile rod."
2290170,ftfarms,2013-12-21 11:21:00,444,I use g-loomis glx721 and glx782 love the feel.
2290722,kzoofisher,2013-12-21 18:37:00,5144,"There's a couple threads on jigging rods and you'll find the most popular are 6'-7' lt to md with fast tips. How long and how light you go depends a lot on what weights you'll be throwing, how far and how deep. No idea what your lakes are like but, if your going to be pitching shallow dirty water I'd stick closer to 6', shorter is better for vertical jigging anyway. I like longer rods for deeper or clear water and for working down steep drops because I'm looking for more control at distance, lighter rods for lighter jigs and pretty fast action for sensitivity. Since I mostly fish pretty clear water and depths of more than 12' feet you can probably guess what I use most often. Just about any name band will be a good starter but the more rods you can hold in your hand the better you'll be able to judge. If I were you I'd pick a reasonably priced, high modulus rod in the length and action that you'll probably use most with the weights you'll throw, and then fish the heck out of it. You'll know by July what you like and don't like and then you can give the rod to your kid and upgrade."
2299626,btmbncr,2013-12-26 20:30:00,492,"Thanks everyone.I ordered a Fenwick Elite-Tech Walleye spinning rod.6'9"" ML,Fast."
2306378,roscoe33,2013-12-29 19:56:00,653,"I have several expensive walleye rods. Don't use them any more.Maybe its me, but having the most sensitive fast action rod, means the fish can feel the pressure of the rod, and react by spitting out the jig, faster than I can react. Fis do have faster reflexes than most of us, so I choose not to give them the advantage of feeling the pressure.Instead, I use a rod with a very limp or flexible tip.Flexible enough that the tip will flex under the weight of a 1/16 or 1/8 ounce jig.When working the bottom, the tip will move often before the line is completely tight.When jig fishing, I am almost always watching the line or rod tip.Actually my favorite rod for light jig fishing, is a Berkeley Ugly Stick Lite PRO, 5'9"" UL. Under $40.Very sensitive in that it the tip moves with the slightest of pressure, it just doesn't transfer the bite to the handle.Another rod I use has similar characteristics, but longer, is actually a trout rod.These rods have proven to be much more productive than my St Croix rods."
