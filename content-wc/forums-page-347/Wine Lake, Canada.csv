2350210,billy weaver,2014-01-14 10:51:00,470,I have fished Wabaskang Lake and Beaver Lake but have not fished Wine Lake much. I have not been any further south than the entrance to Beaver. How is the fishing south?

2358146,billy weaver,2014-01-16 17:38:00,470,I have fished the bay at the outlet on the north side and did ok. We have caught some big walleye in Beaver Lake. I don't know where Dynamite bay is. We have been staying at Peffley's for the last 25 years and like the trip to Beaver and a shore lunch. We used to portage over the falls to Lake Sharon but I am getting to old for that trip. We will use that day for fishing Wine Lake instead. Thanks for the tip.
