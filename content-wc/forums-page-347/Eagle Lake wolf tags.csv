2342042,fishguide1800,2014-01-11 12:53:00,84,I hunt on private property in area 5. I have travelled through 800 acres of private farm for years and have roughly seen 30 to 50 deer within a 2 km stretch of road.this summer while and this fall hunting the most I saw was 12 deer.thats quite a difference in numbers.there are lots of wolves in this area also and they get a couple here and there.but they didnt get the numbers iam talking about.have found dead deer from last winter where they never got up from bedding down.pretty sad sight.iam a trophy hunter myself and let good deer go this last fall in hopes they survive for the upcoming fall hunt.did notice more small bucks this fall as did my hunters who also passed up on them in hopes of them getting more mature.but your right going to take a few years to see more trophy deer out there.it will also take some time to bring the moose back.now we need to get a spring bear season back as thats one of the reasons I think that the moose population is so slow in coming back also.

2346802,LOW1,2014-01-13 13:52:00,2828,"It's unfortunate that jail time isn't involved. Violations like these should be punished by more than a fine, which can easily be seen as a cost of doing business. And the fine against the business may never be paid, and/or was calculated into the sale price when the resort changed hands.For wealthy people who lack character fines are not very meaningfull."

2346898,troutwater,2014-01-13 14:25:00,299,Thank you for the link. Hard to believe theye are still allowed into Canada after all that and yet you still hear stories about people getting turned away at the border for old DUI's. I agree with previous posters who said jail time would have been nice. As an American I'm embarrassed that someone would go into Canada and take advantage of the resources like that.
2338594,troutwater,2014-01-10 03:15:00,299,I'm just wondering if anyone knows when the hammer will drop on the individuals who got caught poaching wolves in the past year on Eagle Lake. I've been checking the MNR website but haven't seen anything yet.
2338682,Skywagon,2014-01-10 05:51:00,1106,"I wish they had removed a few wolves from my territory. There are hardly any deer left in our immediate area because of wolf predation, the last 4 years they have become a real problem. There have been two deer kills within eyesight of our house this winter, their tracks are on our trails almost daily. The local moose population is in trouble, bears and wolves are one contributing factor, but not the only one. I would gladly donate our local wolf population to any tree huggers that want them, with the stipulation they must keep them at least 500 miles away from here.We get pictures of wolves on our trail cameras on a regular basis, usually at night. Here is one taken in the daytime last winter.http://i1178.photobucket.com/albums/...ps05c64dd5.jpg"
2338762,v-bay gord,2014-01-10 06:39:00,3168,"Skywagon, if you are lamenting the lack of moose then the wolf is the solution. The problem is the deer population that has spread the brain worm to the moose population. The wolves (and the winters) will soon return the balance. The issue of the poaching that Troutwater refers to is interesting and I too am awaiting an MNR news release. I think many WC members will be shocked at the individual(s) who were involved, and in some cases very high profile people in the angling / tourism industry."
2338794,Fisherman1792,2014-01-10 06:49:00,927,Sounds like just about everywhere has a wolf problem. Didn't see a moose track anywhere this year moose hunting but a lot of wolf tracks. We had a pack near our camp for a few days and at night they would howl. Never saw them though. The wife and I were on our way to Thunder Bay back in late November and just before Nipigon there was a wolf on the shoulder with what looked like a deer leg in his mouth. He was just standing there watching the traffic go by. Fisherman 1792
2340210,fishguide1800,2014-01-10 16:06:00,84,"Wolves have to eat to.they do kill deer, moose, mice, thats thete job in life.but beleive me there not responsible for the decline in our deer herd.last winter was the culprit and this winter is working on another round.nature takes care of its own balance.those that were responsible for some of the wolves violations around the vermilion bay area will be punished as they should.some already have from what I know.one big fish out there that hasn't as far as I know.be interesting to see how it unfolds.those people just have no respect for our nature.just abuse everything they can get away with."
2340569,ftfarms,2014-01-10 18:57:00,444,If it happened and true why don't you all just tell us who the VIP that got caught Can't stand the suspense
2340882,Guest,2014-01-10 22:29:00,0,"I hope they throw the book at him. Always preaches conservation (fishing, anyway), but then poaches anything with 4 legs, smuggles lynx across the border, ensnares his guests in the nonsense. A crook, to say the least."
2341322,Skywagon,2014-01-11 08:09:00,1106,"Gord,As I indicated in the earlier post, there are also other problems contributing to the decline of the moose, brain worm is one, but certainly predation is another, I won't touch the other major problem.Fishguide,YOUR deer herd may have been effected by the snow last year. There is a significant difference in the size of the deer herd west of Dryden as opposed to that of several miles east (9A). I have talked to one individual (a trapper) that has legally taken many wolves from your area in the last two years (there may be others, I don't know them). MY deer herd (9A) has been effected by wolf predation in a major way since the winter of 2009-2010. We have an extensive trail system that winds through over 200 acres abutting the lake. There are 2 trail cameras set up, at least part of the trails are walked twice daily. We have a very good feel for how many deer/wolves are in our area, we see the animals, their tracks and have pictures, we also see the deer kills in the bush as well as on the lake. As you know, the wolves like to drive the deer on the lake where they sink in the snow, the wolves stay on top, instant red spot in the snow. MY deer have not survived to make it to the point of common winter kill because of the wolves. Yes, this will take care of itself, but for a trophy hunter, the wait will be years.I guess it will require a trip to Tim Hortons, to get the lowdown on the culprits."
