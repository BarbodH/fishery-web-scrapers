2342946,packpro,2014-01-11 22:07:00,695,Went down today as well. Seemed like pretty good traffic. I now do most of my research on line. However all the information and pictures in the world cannot replace a good conversation with a camp owner. That still has to be the best way to truly evaluate the real quality of a camp.
2343554,Fishoil,2014-01-12 09:50:00,1277,"I agree, nothing like meeting them in person. My first 6 or 7 trips were made to a camp where I first met the owner at the All Canada show back in about 1990. Looking forward to the show coming back to Green Bay next year since it's close to home."
2344346,misanthrope,2014-01-12 15:27:00,43,Booked this morning with Hugh from Viking for Telescope Lake. In and out in a half an hour. A truly beautiful thing.
2345298,Tamarack,2014-01-13 00:16:00,16,"It was a great show for us, most lodge owners I spoke with said the same. It was great talking to both you guys. After hearing Narda rave about Marcel's camp for a few years now it was nice meeting him. Nice talking to you too Lassh. I think there was something for everyone at the show. I get a lot of business over the internet too. However if I had the chance to speak to owners of potential destinations, I would for sure feel more confident in my decision. Yes Jared is the best!!!, Lots of great lodge owners out there. In fact the best part about my job besides being able to fish quite a bit are the great relationships we make with our guests and other lodge owners. We may be competing for business with each other but at the end of the day we all support and mutually respect each other a great deal. I think Steve, Scott and their staff did a very good job with the show, considering they only had a few months to put it together. - Should be even better next year with Chicago and Green Bay with a full year of planning and some cash to play with.Now off to the Quad cities, but first a little bluegill fishing with a few of my customers."
2345946,Larry Mac,2014-01-13 09:16:00,530,"We also enjoy meeting and talking to all the different outfitters. We a very glad that the show will still go on!!!Hi misanthrope, Hugh, Viking and Telescope Lake have been on my list for awhile, please post a report when you get back. Have a great Trip Thank you,Larry Mac"
2334754,Tamarack,2014-01-09 00:25:00,16,The All Canada Show in Chicago starts tomorrow and runs through Sunday. Come enjoy the show and pop by our booth and say hi. All the best;ToddTamarack Island Wilderness Lodge
2335018,teddi,2014-01-09 06:29:00,349,"Still doing the all Canada shows I see. What else are you doing, maybe we will meet up again for a drink."
2336457,Larry S,2014-01-09 12:47:00,665,Is it True that the Chicago Show is the Only ALL CANADA show this year?
2337105,v-bay gord,2014-01-09 15:47:00,3168,I believe that is the case. New owners with future expansion plans.
2338377,Glenman12,2014-01-09 20:27:00,762,it will be interesting to see what the attendance is...we worked the booth for our lodge for about 15 yrs...attendance seemed ok for the most part but the amount of lodges dwindled...two years ago it took up the main hall and the smaller one where there were demonstrations and food..last year it was all in the main hall with room to spare..
2338393,v-bay gord,2014-01-09 21:04:00,3168,"Here's a list of exhibitors. Not sure how it compares to the past, but I count 81 Ontario exhibitors. http://www.allcanadashow.com/html/sh...ibitorList.php"
2338866,NARDA 1,2014-01-10 07:09:00,636,"I was at the show last night in the Birch Dale Lodge Booth with Marcel. Attendance appeared to be up from the last couple of years, Marcel was very happy with the results from the first night of the show. Stop by and see us!"
2339554,lassh,2014-01-10 12:05:00,553,"It didn't seem crowded last night, but I haven't been on a Thursday night before. There did appear to be fewer resorts represented. I submitted our deposit for Wallace Lake Lodge. James and Joe are most hospitable. I spent some time reminiscing with the guys at the Showalter booth. I also met Todd from Tamarack- great guy on wonderful LOW! Narda- if I would have known you were there, I would have bought you a Rye on the rocks. Maybe next year. I missed Obabikon this year but he's an upstanding lodge owner. If you go to the show, stop by and see Jerry from Dunlops Lodge in Manitoba. Its not the typical booth. He has some easy chairs and carpet instead of the traditional table. They catch some impressive pike at his camps. Thorne Bros. had a limited selection of items for sale at the show. I had not noticed that before. They have a larger selection at the Musky Show this weekend at Harper College. Also if you plan to attend, go online for your discounted tickets to the show. Have a great weekend!"
2340609,NARDA 1,2014-01-10 19:17:00,636,"Tamarack, it was great meeting you, it's always nice to put a name to a face.Lassh, I would have had to buy you one because they don't have any rye here but of course I do."
2342058,lassh,2014-01-11 13:06:00,553,Then I really missed out!
