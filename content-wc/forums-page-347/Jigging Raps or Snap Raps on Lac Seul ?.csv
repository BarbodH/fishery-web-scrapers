I'm going to try this next summer if I can find the right spot and conditions.I would imagine you could lose enough of these on rock reefs to drive the price of Normark stock up.Bill
2343018,rdbalmer,2014-01-11 23:30:00,279,I've been wondering the same thing. I use them a lot on the lakes around Bemidji and have great success but I have also left a number of them in the rocks. I haven't tried them on Lac Seul for the reasons mentioned but I have no doubt they would work great. You would just have to be careful in the rocks and preferably find some fish in the sand to work on. I am looking forward to trying it my next time up there. Rob
