536250,hightide185,2003-12-31 06:38:00,4,I'm looking for some feedback on Rusty Meyers Fly In's. We are planning our annual Walleye trip and we are considering going to Grayson Lake. Is he the only outfitter on the lake ? How is the service and the fishing Any feedback (positive or negative) is appreciated.
536256,fishmaster,2003-12-31 14:11:00,209,Can't say from my own experiance these day's but when I was younger when the place was still owned by Rusty he ran a good ship but from what I have heard from others it is still run well. If you do a search on the fly ins you come up with others. There is another one that I can think of for sure from the same area but don't remember the name but sure someone else will post it for you along the way. Good Luck

536259,Guest,2003-12-31 15:08:00,0,Very reliable outfitter. Highly recomended by everybody I have sent in their direction. Grayson has a good population of fish. You will enjoy yourselves. G_W
