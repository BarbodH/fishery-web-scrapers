I often fish in -25 to -30 weather with a wind ( I know I'm crazy ). I need something that will keep me warm and can be easily taken off when it gets warmer during the day. I am looking for suggestions on brands, styles etc. Thanks"

My set is five years old and I wouldn't think of buying a different jacket. As for pants I also like The North Face. They have a bib that isn't as thick as others but is Gortex and keeps the legs toasty warm. Cold is one thing, cold and wet is another."

I wear a polar fleece pullover sweater over a flannel shirt on top, and just my jeans beneath the bibs on the bottom. Keep your toes, hands and head warm. That seems to be key for staying out in REALLY c-c-c-c-old stuff for extended periods."
