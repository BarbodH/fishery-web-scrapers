We like to fish the MacKenzie Bay area, but it is quite a boat ride from Ear Falls and would like to know of any accesses that would be closer. Thanks in advance."

It would be on Scout Lake I beleive which is connected. I've been up that strech a number of times, I seem to remember seeing another access sign, but I don't remember how far south of Ear Falls it was."
536278,Guest,2004-01-02 10:11:00,0,Sounds like you are familiar with the NW area of the lake. THere is a public access down by Lac Suel Lodge about 20 mins south of Ear Falls by road. Otherwise I'm sure you can put in @ most camps for a fee.

If it were me or you have a bigger boat I'd drive into Ear Falls and use the public ramp by Gold Pines. It's cement and not the shallow problem."
