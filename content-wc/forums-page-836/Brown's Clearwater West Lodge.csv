535981,VANT,2003-12-15 18:58:00,68,Anybody go there this summer? How was the walleye fishing? I understand that Turtle Lake across the road is supposed to be hot for walleye as it just opened. What is your overall opinion of the resort? Want to go housekeeping. Don't need anything fancy. Would like cabins to have bathroom with shower and be mostly bug free. More concerned with fishing. Would you consider Turtle to be a numbers or size lake? Thanks in advance.

Clear water lake is great for lake trout and whitefish. I did try Turtle but just caught some decent smallies. White Otter is great for walleye. Browns operate a lift into White Otter Lake from Clearwater. While you are in White Otter and have the time check out the Castle! Makes you wonder how one guy built it with out any help!!! Here's the Link to Browns.http://www.brownsclearwaterlodge.com/ Roger Mayer."
536445,Guest,2004-01-10 07:18:00,0,I have been fishing the White Otter area for over 18 years. White Otter is by far the most beautiful lake I have ever seen & the Walleye fishing is fantastic! Check out the abandoned POW camp just to the north of the castle.
