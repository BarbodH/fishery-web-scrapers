536204,Guest,2003-12-29 13:29:00,0,I've been there three years running.......Yes it is Jim and Marlene.......great camp and facilities......can't wait for May 17th.

Lac Suel is big water.There is good fishing near camp, they will mark a map for you, but I would recommend booking a guide early on in your trip instead of waiting to the end. The guys there are good and you will have a great experience as well as shore lunch till it hurts."
