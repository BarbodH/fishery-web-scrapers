536186,Guest,2003-12-28 10:19:00,0,Can anyone provide me with a link to a good resort on the Canadian side of the lake? I am primarily interested in fishing for smallmouth first and then walleye. Is the bass fishing better in the North Arm as compared to fishing the east side to the lake? Thanks.

My experience has been that the North Arm produces greater numbers of fish, but the east has larger fish. The eastern fish feed more on smelt, so they are often difficult to find because they may be suspended in open water. However, if you do find them, and they are actively feeding you can catch lots of big fish in a hurry on topwaters."

This is an older basic fishing camp-housekeeping. The grounds are well kept and the fish house is clean. The cabins are old with a mixture of appliances-some rusty but all worked. Hot and cold running water and flush toilets. You can see the wiring and the studs. Boats and motors are functional but not new. Location is near Devils Cascade waterfalls. When we were there, just after the Canadian Smallmouth Fishing Tournament-end of July and 1st day of August, the smallmouth fishing was terrific. A small piece of nightcrawler on a 1/8 or 1/4 ounce jig cast from the docks would bring a fish more often than not, leeches also work well. This is good value fishing vacation for people who are not concerned about fancy accomodations-and you can rent by the day. Either fly-in or boat in on a boat arranged by camp operator (about 20 mile trip from government docks, not a trip you would want to make without knowledge of reefs or in windy or stormy weather) Cost for boat in at that time was $90 one way for up to 5 people. We also caught northern, a couple of walleye and perch. People in neighboring cabin caught nice crappies at dusk. Fishing was so good off docks for smallmouth we didn't take boat out one day.

536218,Gary_IA,2003-12-30 05:55:00,144,"We had good weather on the boat in and a knowledgeable boat operator-a good trip in and a good trip out. What I meant to say, this is not a boat in you want to do in your own boat unless you know the lake and weather conditions. I think most people would be better off on the boat in arranged by the camp operator or by flying in. Boat in is better value and doesn't have weight restrictions with fly-in."

Both places are drive-in and are located in Bears Pass (connects Swell bay with Redgut Bay). This area has good smallie and good walleye fishing. Lots of areas to fish, reefs, islands and there is always a place to fish even if the wind is blowing. The best advice i can give you if you fish/boat these waters, is to buy the actual NOAA navigational maps for navigation. You can order them from the Outdoorman baitshop in Int'l falls, no other maps are as accurate. Xplorer"

536291,Guest,2004-01-04 11:04:00,0,I just wanted to thank those that have responed to my request for a resort on the Canadian side of Rainy Lake. While doing a little surfing I came across a link to LaBelles Birch Point Camp. According to the map on the site it looks like the resort is located in Northwest Bay. See the following link. http://www.labellescamp.com/index.html Can anyone make any comments about the resort and the type of fishing that is found in that area. Thanks again.
