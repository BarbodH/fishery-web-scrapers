536453,Guest,2004-01-10 10:37:00,0,"If you are an American, bring American beer. Seeing as how it is as weak as our dollar, you shouldn't have to worry about getting intoxicated. lol!! But seriously, I don't know why we can't have a beer when fishing, as long as we are not intoxicated. If I am away for the weekend of fishing, I always have a few cans with me for the evening fish. I have never been charged, & I am talking about the lakes close to Toronto which are swarmed with cops. JUST DON'T BE AN IDIOT ON THE WATER!! REMEMBER that 3/4 of the fatalities on the water are booze related, so keep it in moderation. If you don't want to chance it, I am sure there are lots of resivoirs in the States where you can fish & drink, so go there!!!!"
536459,rebelrn2001,2004-01-10 16:45:00,1563,"Don't bother reading all the posts here. Just tell you buddy it is perfectly legal to boat and drink beer in Ontario. You can drink as much as you want all day and night. If a warden comes along, offer him a beer and you will be fine. They all appreciate it when someone from the Good 'Ol USA offers a BUD or MILLER or COORS (especially). Be sure to urinate into the lake while they are there too, they want the water temps up a little bit no matter what time of the year it is and urine does help with that. Fish spawn better and the fry thrive better in warmer water."
536423,BanditFisher,2004-01-09 09:28:00,12,"Another interesting point, was that TrailerGuy said the ""Crown"" owns all the Lakes, Rivers, and Streams. My brother in Texas told me, that you can own a Lake or Pond in Texas, but the Game and Wildlife Dept. still owns all the Fish in it."
536424,Guest,2004-01-09 09:55:00,0,Bandit fisher...Texas is not a Canadian Provience....At least I dont think it is....Wheres my cooler????
536427,BanditFisher,2004-01-09 10:22:00,12,"Ha-ha, good one. I know...... its actually a US Povince. I was just comparing the different ways Governments seem to view things. You know, Canada is a pretty big place. There must be several Lakes you can go to that the Beer Police don't ever check on. And what if you had a Great Big Sail Boat or Yatch or something and were drinking Beer INSIDE. Surely thats not considered Public. Could you just drill a hole in the side of the Boat and stick the rod out? Then you could Fish while still consuming your Beer inside. Privately."
536428,BanditFisher,2004-01-09 10:24:00,12,"Hey, wouldn't it be funny if some rich guy tried that and then caught a World Record Pike and had 'em all reeled in up out of the water but he neglected to make the Beer Hole big enough to get the Fish inside."
536429,Ivy,2004-01-09 10:45:00,556,"Banditfisher, Don't drive yourself crazy with this beer thing. As it has been pointed out to me beer is bad for you. And if you have to drink while you fish, you're a drunk. Ivy"
536430,Guest,2004-01-09 10:49:00,0,"We take beer out with us all day every day on our annual fly-in. Then refill the cooler after supper and go back out. One boat each trip gets lost or someone breaks a rod or an ankle at dock - makes for great video. I have a tip for you on sinking bottles...we discovered that sinking bottles uses valuable fishing and drinking time and it can be dangerous leaning over the gunnel in waves. We stopped sinking bottles and now simply toss and smash them onto shoreline rocks as we pass islands while spot hopping. Also, try refilling the bottles with water and tossing them at loons. Hit one and you get a bottle of whiskey in our group. just kidding folks"
536431,Guest,2004-01-09 11:05:00,0,"Something close to the bottom line of the subject is that it is illegal to drink and possess beer in small fishing boats in Ontario. If you have a larger boat with a head and sleeping quarters and it is moored, you can drink. The reality of the subject is that on some lakes this law is enforced much more strictly than on others. I believe the larger lakes with numerous lodges are the worst (depending on your point of view) and the fly-in lakes are pretty much below the radar, but not totally immune. I've flown in over 20 times with various outfitters and they have never mentioned this law on one occasion. The last trip was a boat-in deal and when I asked the lodge owner he said that the local water cop didn't care and that nobody had ever been ticketed on that lake. A fairly lengthy post discussing this situation evolved into two basic camps: those that believed that this law was for safety and those that believed it was simply a revenue source for the providence. Some of us that believed it is nothing more than a revenue source via tickets and fines thought that they should sell a ""beer in the boat"" license which would allow you to carry and consume up to a 6-pack per person. A 6-pack per day wouldn't get anybody drunk and it would still make money for the local authorities. Unfortunately, the less-than-enlightened government officials haven't acted on this yet, so drink at your own risk. I believe the Canadians tended to fall more into the safety camp while we ugly Americans disagreed. But on the other hand, I've never encountered a boat with Canadian fishermen that didn't have a few beers in it. Proceed at your own risk. Personally, I drink a few beers in the boat and take enough money with me to pay the fine if I get ticketed. Cost of doing business, so to speak. After all, the fines are in Canadian Dollars, so whats the big deal? He,he,he..."
536432,BanditFisher,2004-01-09 11:18:00,12,"Ivy, I appreciate your concern, but, I actually hardly ever drink Beer or Alcolhol. (I'm a Coffaholic) But, many people do, and I often find the Reasoning behind different laws to be interesting. About half this thread could have been avoided if I had known from the Get-Go that it was not about Drinking and Driving Boats, but about Drinking in Public. That was why I was asking about if this Law applied to Canoes and such. Here in Oklahoma, there is a small river where paople go to Canoe Trips. Its perfectly fine to drink till you puke, as long as you don't have Glass Bottles. Cans and Plastic only. My brother got a $152 citation from the Glass Bottle Police. Its an Enviromental Broken Glass thing."
536435,Ivy,2004-01-09 11:53:00,556,"Banditfisher, I can get a little glib sometimes. It is as you say a public drinking item. The reasoning behind the rules would be interesting reading. My logical ( sometimes sober ) thought process tells me that if the concern was to obtain sobriety. Concentraiting on intoxication rather than legal consumption would better serve everyone. But who am I to judge. Besides I'm half in the bag most of the time anyway. ( Glib again ) Ivy"
536442,bigfish1965,2004-01-09 23:39:00,3210,"Ivy, the first half of my post was to you, the second to the OP. I realize after reading my post I didn't make it clear. The OP said his buddies had to be able to drink or no deal. We used to have beer all the time up north. No one ever said anything. These days 'Up North' isn't so 'Up' anymore and the increse in traffic has brought about an increase in awareness and enforcement. I don't miss the beer. Had to pee all the time."
536394,BanditFisher,2004-01-08 16:12:00,12,"Like I said before, I'm new to this Fishing Thing..... But, no one has said specifically if Canoes or Row Boats count. Someone said something that alluded to this Rule having to do with people getting drunk and Drowning. I would have thought it had to do with Operating Motorized Water Vehicles while intoxicated making us a possible perceived danger to other Boat or Water Vehicles or whatever. And what if you're some Rich Guy that owns a whole small Lake or something? Can you drink Beer in a Boat if you own the whole Lake?"
536397,Trailerguy,2004-01-08 17:59:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]In Ontario the crown owns the bottum of the lake,(every lake, river, ect). If you drink alchol on it you can expect the law to take notice. Just like drinking in your rowboat,in the fountian,in front of your county courthouse,when the Sherrif pulls up, will get you noticed at home,LOL. If you need a better explanation than that, just post for our old freind ""Dick Withem"", he'll fix you right up. :)"
536398,Guest,2004-01-08 18:02:00,0,"http://boating.ncf.ca/alcohol.html ....You can't drink in any public place and a river, creek, lake is a public place. Tis the law of the land. What you have to do is bring a little pot....Canadians are very tolerant on small amounts and we are in the process of decriminalizing it. Just make sure you get rid of it before you go back to the States. They seize your vehicle and sell it, you have a permenant record, are disenfranchised and you don't go past go and collect $200"
536406,Guest,2004-01-08 21:22:00,0,"You can take as much beer in your boat that you want,, just be prepared to pay the price when arrested. Last year we just sunk all the bottles after we drank them. After doing this for 4 years we now have a great piece of structure to fish on,, even caught a 6lb eye there last year!! Beer,, it does a belly good!!"
536408,PJM,2004-01-08 21:42:00,3516,"LugNutz You are not serious are when you say you sink the bottles to the bottom of the lake after you drink them, are you. That is just not a smart thing to do to our natual resources."
536410,Ivy,2004-01-09 05:48:00,556,"PJM, I doubt he was serious. The Beer in the Boat club was started when the subject was taken to extremes. I like to poke fun at the self-rightious. In my opinion the law is overly strict but it's the law and I'm not an anarchist. However, the post does have something to consider. Let's say there are guys out on a lake with a 6-pack of beer. After they drink the beer, they put all trash in a plastic bag and are going to throw the trash in a can back at they dock. Somehow they find out that the O.P.P. is back at the landing checking guys as they come in. Human nature being what it is, where do you suppose these bottles are going to end up? In the trash bag ( with the$1,200.00 fine ) or at the bottom of the lake? I believe that you can't legislate morality. If people ( who know they are breaking the law anyway ) are going to choose between healthy fines or worse, bottles at the bottom of a lake or river will win, more times than not. Ivy"
536413,bigfish1965,2004-01-09 06:38:00,3210,"It's not illegal to have empties, Ivy. In my experience, if you are behaving no one says anything to you about anything. If your buddies won't fish without beer, perhaps a trip to Betty Ford would be more beneficial than a trip to Ontario."
536415,Guest,2004-01-09 07:06:00,0,If you are going to drink on the water and be able to convince the Boat Police that you arent drinking take Pete Rose with you ....he is convincing....Pete didnt inhale either.
536421,Ivy,2004-01-09 09:08:00,556,"BigFish 1965, Let's not make it personal here. It's not about me or my buddies. My fishing buddies and I are captains of industry, leaders in our community, beyond reproach, ethical, honorable, handsome, great fisherman and above all modest. Which I am sure you are as well. What was your question? Oh the Betty Ford Clinic. The food there is awful and the service is lousy. Not quite up to my standards. Simply won't do. But seriously, what was your point again? Oh my buddies and I needing to drink while fishing. It's not that we need to but we choose to. Sitting out in that camp boat out on that Fly-out lake pulling in walleyes one after another. Building up a thirst. Sipping on a Labatt's. Know one around but you and your friends. What's wrong with that ? I forgot, it's against the law. Cheers, Ivy"
536422,BanditFisher,2004-01-09 09:22:00,12,"This has all been very Infomative. Especially for someone who is not from nor has ever been to Canada. Someone said it is not REALLY about drinking in Boats, but about drinking in PUBLIC. If that is true, the Question is, what is ""Public""? Seems if that were true, you could not even Drink Beer on the shore of the Lake at your Camp. Or would it be okay inside the Tent, but not at the Fire? Also, BanditFisher wants to thank everyone for their many Excellent Posts. FishermanFred said you were all a bunch of Swell Fellas."
536372,BanditFisher,2004-01-08 11:15:00,12,"Hi, everybody. I'm kind of new to this Fishing Thing. (One of your fellow Posters directed me to this Board) Anyway, I was wondering if they allow you to Drink Beer while Driving your Fishing Boats up there in Canada? I've been trying to get my brother to take a trip up there sometime, and this is the sort of thing that could be considered a Deal Breaker."
536376,MTJ,2004-01-08 12:33:00,106,"I can only speak for Ontario, but no beer in the boat. Check out this link: http://www.frcentre.net/communities/...at_Law_Ont.pdf My opinion is that you should be able to have alcohol in the boat, no consumption while under power and the operator cannot be intoxicated. Sure would be nice to have a beer with shore lunch."
536380,BanditFisher,2004-01-08 13:10:00,12,"Thanks, MTJ...... Thats interesting. FishermanFred, who directed me to this fine site, goes up to Ontario every year after Trophy Pike. When he comes back, he always brags about how much Beer he drank. Does the ""No Beer"" thing apply to Row Boats and Canoes, or just Boats with Motors?"
536384,Guest,2004-01-08 14:08:00,0,Maybe he is like some of the people I have met fishing and choses to ignore that particular rule.
536386,bigbo85,2004-01-08 14:12:00,2,if you get caught by cops or the ministry you could get fined and or a DWI charge.
536387,Guest,2004-01-08 14:24:00,0,There you go picking on us alcoholics who like to catch Walleye. Been drinking beer in the boat clear back when you had to carry a churchkey around your neck to open the cans. The law frowns on this and will take a large chunk out of your caboose if they catch you Heard tell about some guys who lost their boat and all their fishing stuff and paid a fat fine. just dont seem fair until you consider that a drunk drowns faster in some cases than a sober man....especially a case of Bud.
536388,Matches,2004-01-08 14:41:00,236,"Yep, it's a new year. Not bad though, it took only 8 days to start a discussion about drinking in the boat! Banditfisher, you're probably wondering what I'm talking about. Your question comes up a lot. The bottom line is that it is illegal to drink in the boat in Ontario. The other thing to ask your friends is if they ever had a DWI because you could have border crossing problems. To read more all about these subjects, go up to the search button, and then go to advanced search. On the advance search, choose Canada. Type in DWI or Dui for search words for the subject only. Both of them will show you many posts on these subjects."
536389,Guest,2004-01-08 14:49:00,0,You know that if we all would get drunk and get kicked out of Canada they wouldnt have any body to support their fishing industry. Bet they would change the law about us poor drunks than......Think it would work?
536392,Ivy,2004-01-08 15:37:00,556,"Beer in the Boat????? Anyone remember B.I.G. the ( Beer In (the boat) Gang ) campaign. Developed and created right here on W/C??
