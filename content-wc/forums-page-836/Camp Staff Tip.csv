Most of us have always felt that this was a fair amount. Last year, the service was well below what it had been in previous years and by the end of the week a couple of us wanted to decrease the amount of our tip. However, the person that had collected the money had given it to the camp operator mid-week. Needless to say there were some hard feelings. By the way, I sent the camp owner a letter expressing our concerns and am encouraged by his response. I have suggested that next year we wait until the end of the week and each man can decide the amount of tip he would like to leave. No one should feel bad if someone leaves more or less than another guy. I'm wondering how other groups handle a tip for the staff. Does my suggestion seem reasonable? Thanks!"

I travel with a few different groups every summer and this method is used by all. Our trips will run from 4 - 7 days and we try to assess the tip on a daily basis. Having apprenticed at a few camps to learn the business I know how well a tip is appreciated and we always seem to get the best of service regardless where we go."

People i talk to that work at American Plan resorts make a killing, whereas the housekeeping resort (lower cost) seems to attract a clientele that doesn't tip as much. If I was to receive $50 from any of our groups, I would wash and wax their car the night before they went home. Our cleaning stuff as so overlooked, it should almost be added to the bills. The most common compliment is on how clean the cabins are. Remember everyone that contributes to your comfort. We appreciate every nickel, as most of us work seasonally and a lot of us attend school. Thanks, Everyone."
