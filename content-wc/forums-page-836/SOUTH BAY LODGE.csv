536227,Guest,2003-12-30 14:19:00,0,"I am a biased opinion.....I owned South Bay Lodge for past 8 years and just sold this fall. While I know you want others opinions and I encourage them to respond. Confederation is 14,000 acres. No road access i.e. boat-in 3 miles from the southern end of the lake. Large numbers of Lake Trout, and big Northerns on the main lake. There are several portage lakes (with boats/motors) to fish for walleye as well. When I purchased South Bay Lodge 9 years ago I spent the entire summer there fishing and I continued to fish/guide during the whole time I owned it. We did alot of work on the log cabins and is apparent when you look at the condition of the 50 yr+ log cabins. We pretty much gutted and redid the interior as well as hand scaped the outside and replaced logs where needed etc etc...All the cabins have toilets w/showers, all beds are new in last 4 years, all boats & motors are 1-2 years old. (leased new motors every year and purchased new guide boats/motors last year). New floating dock system installed in 2002. This is not the place for everyone! It is a fisherman's lake and there is nothing else to do there....no beach, no playground equip (except horse shoe pit) no shopping....just alot of peace and quiet and of course fishing. The web site has photos and a fishing report from last season. New owners are not too computer literate (yet) so most of photos are from 2002 season. Leaving for shows (All Canada Show circuit) tomorrow, opens in Minneapolis Friday. If you are close to any of the cities on the show circuit stop by, I,ll be there this year in the booth again. ro"
536234,Guest,2003-12-30 16:42:00,0,Our party fished there about three years ago. We did OK. Bugs were bad and the weather sucked. Never had a real chance to get good fishing in.
536248,Guest,2003-12-31 06:17:00,0,"thanks for your response. when is the best time of year to go(less bugs, better bite)? do alot of people bring up their own boats? do they really help put you on the fish or do they recommend a guide. i would like to bring my own boat and have a good gps, recommended or not?"
536249,Guest,2003-12-31 06:25:00,0,"i just checked out the website and it looked very nice, i tried to send them an email but it said they cant answer any emails. are they having computer problems or just dont want to answer any emails? i was kind of put off by this, i really want to know if they allow a few fish to be brought home? i also wanted to be sent a brochure with current rates. can you help me with this? thanks my email address is [email protected]"
