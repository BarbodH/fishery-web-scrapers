The zero-stretch places all the headshake shock right on the hook shank and opens the hook holes. A big difference now that I 'm using 9 ft rods."
536370,Guest,2004-01-08 09:35:00,0,Thanks guys for all the input on fishing line. We are going to try Power Pro 10lb test on jigging rods and 15lb test on trolling. looks like the line diameter is small enough on both and sounds like Power Pro has the least amount of problems. Im looking forward to hooking up on some of those Walleyes and enjoying our first Canadian experience.
536383,River_eye,2004-01-08 13:28:00,1486,"I just found that when the line was reeled in tight, when there was a fish on, with fireline, the line would cut into the spool, and would require some jerking of the rod or grabing the line by hand to get the line off the spool. I attributed this to the fireline flattening out, being a fused line, and the powerpro keeping it's relatively round cross section from being a braid. I do still use my line after it's frayed so that could be the cause. I still use medium rods around 6' for jigging, as I have used superlines right from the beginning, right when fireline came out, so when I ever try mono it feels like I have to really jerk on it to set the hook. I learned from the beginning that a flick of the wrist is all it takes to set the hook."
536405,bigfish1965,2004-01-08 20:04:00,3210,"Eric; I use an old Zebco Pro Staff reel for my Fireline. It has a much faster spool rate ( you know, going up and down ) than anything else I've had. This probably stops that from happening. I do go through a new top eye every few months though. My newest rod has Titanium guides. If they get wrecked I'll just go back to ceramic and keep extras on hand.I'm totally in love with my new Shimano Castaic 201SF. Sweet reel!"
536300,Guest,2004-01-05 09:21:00,0,What do you men think is the best SUPERLINE for jigging and trolling? I have never tried one of these lines but have heard good things about all of them HELP.
536303,MTJ,2004-01-05 11:03:00,106,"I personally like 8lb. PowerPro. I have used Fireline and Spider in the past but didn't care for them. I switched one rig to 8lb PowerPro last spring and now everything I own is spooled with it. I jiged, pulled cranks (would go with 12lb) and worked spinners/minnow rigs and loved it. Great feel, enough strength to get out of the rocks, and fabulous hook sets."
536304,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-05 14:07:00,323,Have only used power pro for our canadian trip last june i liked it I used it for casting spoons and plastics for pike and trolling for Lakers.I will be filling all the rods I take on out trip this year with it. My boat partner has been using it for about 3 years and swears by it. Atlanta Dave

536339,River_eye,2004-01-06 14:52:00,1486,"I use fireline and powerpro. I used fireline for quite a while, then after using power pro for a few years I'm liking it more and more. My main observations are that the power pro doesn't fray as much as fireline in highly abrasive conditions. It also comes of of a spinning spool a little nicer in that, it doesn't seem to cut into the line on the spool as much. I first used 10 lb for jigging and the noise it made over my rod guides and reel roller guide when reeling in a good fish was kind of annoying. Otherwise, now I use 30 lb on a baitcaster for trolling/casting cranks and it works really nice. Either seem to do the trick, try both and see what you like."
