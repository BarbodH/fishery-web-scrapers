536210,dutchboy,2003-12-29 16:57:00,5717,This might be a poor subject for a Walleye site but the knowledge seems to be here so here goes. Planning on booking another trip to the west end of Eagle Lake. My primary species will be northern pike and muskie. I love to troll and most likely will be fishing alone. My question is how late in the year should i plan on going. (or maybe how early!) I want nothing to do with the black flies and 50 degree weather won't bother me to much either. Thank you for your help

All species are caught (perch,walleye, northerns,whitefish,bass and lake trout) The fishing is great the weather is a little unpredictable but who cares when you are catching fish. You might want to consider an early spring trip. If you need some info on place to stay message or e-mail me and I can go into more detail for you. Good luck on planning your trip."
536215,Trailerguy,2003-12-29 18:46:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Black flies typically get started about the second week in May and taper off again in August. So they are going pretty good when Muskie season starts. Big Pike are mostly moving to deep water by then. Late season usually has less bugs and the big pike and muskie are prowling the flats near deep water.
536373,Guest,2004-01-08 11:47:00,0,Are you talking open water trolling.... i.e. crankbaits or live bait? I go to Eagle end of July 1st part of August. One can do well for suspended 'big' fish (walleyes/northerns) over deep water this time of year. Mainly a early morning or late day bite. During the day I fish the structure with live bait rigs.
