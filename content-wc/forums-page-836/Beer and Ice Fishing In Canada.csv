536268,Guest,2004-01-01 16:12:00,0,"I am sitting at work right now and after reading all the above posts, I feel all P####d up. Wahhh. What a guy won't do to find a loophole to drink while fishing. I just do it, not very often but if I want a couple beers while I am fishing, I ""just do it"".....Isn't that what NIKE tells us to do?"
536269,Guest,2004-01-01 19:03:00,0,"Just to stir the pot (no pun intended) a little more...... On Lake St. Clair (in Canadian waters) your boat is not allowed to have a porta-potty. All toilets must be ""pump out"" heads and not easy dump porta potties."
536281,Matches,2004-01-02 18:34:00,236,Oh great! We're back to the drawing table! Guess I'll go back to Wal-Mart and return the sleeping bag and anchor I just bought!
536191,PJM,2003-12-28 22:24:00,3516,"I know that you can not have any beer or liquor in your boat when you are fishing on open water in Canada but what about ice fishing. Do the same laws apply even in your car, truck or snowmobile that you can't have liquor when you are on the ice."
536193,MTJ,2003-12-29 07:15:00,106,"Yes the same laws apply. A few years ago we were out on the ice having a cocktail at the end of the fishing day and the OPP came up and made us pour our beers out. He state that there is no alcohol allowed on the lake. Our fault for not knowing the laws. Should have been ticketed, lucked out. There's no excuse for ignorance of the laws. One more reason why these discussion boards are so important. One mans mistake may help many others avoid the same."
536197,Mahumba,2003-12-29 08:51:00,345,If you have an ice hut with toilet facilities you can drink in your ice hut. But ya can't bring your drinks outside. Roger Mayer.
536201,Matches,2003-12-29 10:40:00,236,"Mahumba, are you sure? You mean if I have a portable toilet in a portable fish hut, it's legal to have a beer? And PJM, when was the last time you ice fished in Canada?"
536202,Ivy,2003-12-29 11:22:00,556,"It's the law, sure enough. But I think if a guy goes to all the trouble sit out on a frozen lake, they ought to let him chip off a little hard water for his Crown Royal. Just seems to go together. Ivy"
536207,Guest,2003-12-29 15:42:00,0,I have an ice shack a permenant one. We are checked frequently by OPP and OMNR. The shack is considered your residence under the law if you are staying the night there is the way it was explained to me. If the officer sees that you have a sleeping bag and are geared for a night stay you are in. I have witnessed charges layed for liquor when the boys were using it for a day shack fishing. I'd check with the OPP for their interpretation if you have a temporary shack.
536208,Trailerguy,2003-12-29 16:26:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]If a toilet in an ice shack makes it OK for alchol, then a boat with a porta potty should be OK too? Where is the line?"
536212,Mahumba,2003-12-29 17:24:00,345,"You are pretty close! If it has toilet facilities, sleeping capacity and at anchor/moored ya can drink. Roger Mayer"
536225,Matches,2003-12-30 13:19:00,236,"OK, Let's re-cap this discussion. I want to make sure I understand what you are all saying. If I have a portable fish shack, with a portable potty, a sleeping bag and an anchor, I can legally drink beer on the inside of the shack?"
536230,MTJ,2003-12-30 15:51:00,106,"This is getting complicated. I don't know if I can fit all that equipment in the pick-up without leaving the beer out. May be easier to go downtown, buy some fish, set portable up in the back yard, and have a cocktail."
