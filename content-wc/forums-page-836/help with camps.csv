If you go to the www.justfishontario.com site and scroll down they have the Kenora, Fort Francis, Dryden, and Sioux Lookout newspapers listed, just click on one then go to the classifieds, you can also check in the Thunder Bay paper classifieds. Also www.fishontario.com has a classifieds section for real estate., hope these help."

Lee seems very accomodating and is doing a couple of new things. It will still be the same camp, just with out Mike and Gerri. This will be my 16th year at the same camp, now called Wright's Wilderness Camp."
536271,Guest,2004-01-02 07:28:00,0,"You might want to give Indian Lakes Lodge a try. They're about 30 miles west of Dryden, Ontario. About 10 miles north of Vermilion Bay. 8 lakes on the chain, with portage access to 3 more. Lakes go from clear gin-like to dark stained. Walleyes, muskies, smallmouths, and lake trout. Lot's of good eating size walleyes for plenty of fish fry's, plus my 12 yr old son hit a 30"" walleye last fall, so there are big ones too. It's all paved road to their property. Fishing pressure has remained fairly low too. Most muskie anglers practice C/R, so we're seeing more 50"" plus fish being caught. The cabins are clean, the owners are friendly, it's not a bad place to go fishing. I would even recommend it for families. I believe their website is www.indianlakelodge.com Good luck with your search."
536273,Guest,2004-01-02 08:30:00,0,hump1 what has the new owner of weavers done with the rates. we stayed at weavers before but found it to pricey compared to the other camps on the lake. What are some of the new changes lee is thinking of doing at the camp.
536275,Guest,2004-01-02 08:50:00,0,Rates went up $20. I believe i will be paying $435.00 next year. that does include all gas. Le told me he will provide a fish cleaning service and a shore lunch provision box.
536280,Guest,2004-01-02 14:56:00,0,"You should try Ross's Camp, its only about 50 minutes from fort frances. www.rosscamp.com"
536292,River_eye,2004-01-04 16:47:00,1486,"The answer is simple, Lake of the woods. The lake is a walleye factory, producing trophies all the time. It is also full of Muskies. Your experience will mostly depend on your guide and the boat. It's hard to fish the lake effectively without a big boat. I guide for a lodge, but it's pricey. I will give you more info on it if you are willing to spend more than $1000 US per person for a complete 4 night plan."
536297,Guest,2004-01-05 07:34:00,0,"river eye why spend a $1000? We fish Gullrock catch 100's of fish, and a lot of trophy fish spend about $370.oopp for a week and don't need a guide saying you should of been here last week."
536305,River_eye,2004-01-05 17:50:00,1486,"I'm more of a do it myself kind of guy as well, but some people are not. Some people want a camp that is spic and span, where everything looks brand new, and the service is top notch, and are willing to pay for it."
536170,Guest,2003-12-27 17:49:00,0,We are looking for a new camp in ontario to go to. Drive in camp would be best. in the western part of ontario. we drive through fort francis and up that way. we are walleye fishermen and have been going to canada for about 20 years or so. We want to walleye fish and we have one in the crew that loves to muskie fish and that is all he does. So we need a plentiful walleye lake with musky in it. One more question. does anyone know a web site or a place where you can find camps or cabins for sale in ontario????? thanks for all the help
536173,Guest,2003-12-27 18:09:00,0,check out gullrock lake and five lakes lodge great wallleye fishing and the camp owner put us on a muskie lake that was pretty productive one day.
536174,2 DOGS,2003-12-27 18:26:00,361,"Wouldn't argue Gullrock and 5 Lakes Lodge, fantastic walleye fishing and Bud's a good guy. If you don't have any luck you might try www.justfishontario.com and put in your requirements and they will help you out. If it was just great walleye fishing and big northern you were looking for I could recommend Golden Eagle Resort and Evergreen Lodge, both on Lac Seul."
536177,Guest,2003-12-27 19:06:00,0,check out www.paradisecoveminaki.com We love it there WrD
536178,Guest,2003-12-27 19:16:00,0,been to gulrock--it is a great lake. use to stay at weavers--heard he sold it??? thanks for the info and keep it comin.
536184,Guest,2003-12-28 08:52:00,0,"fishen we also stayed at weaver's once, I got leter saying that he had sold."
536187,Gary_IA,2003-12-28 10:27:00,144,"There are many outfitter organizations that will contact you once you input what you want in a fishing trip. I like the justfishontario.com site but have not had ocassion to search for a camp on it. A good source of travel information is www.allcanada.com Within that site click on the link to travel information, several regions provide travel info including Lake of the Woods, the Algoma Central Railway and the Patricia Region, plus others. I like the Patricia Region Link because it provides filters for your search and will provide you with presorted and immediate web links, etc., that more likely will meet your wants in a fishing lodge and you will not to await a response from the resort owners. Wishing you good fishing and nice weather!"
536188,fishmaster,2003-12-28 13:49:00,209,Check out www.vermilionbaylodge.com Whicj is located on the North end of Eagle Lake and offers all the fish you want to try for. Big lake but great fishing.
536192,Guest,2003-12-29 00:35:00,0,"For a good walleye and muskie lake, you can't beat Lake of the Woods. We always stay at Mylie's Place and fish the Sabaskong Bay area. You could fish that ""small"" area of that huge lake over and over for years and not hit all the spots. Check out http://www.myliesplace.com Can't be the service and price."
536198,Gary_IA,2003-12-29 09:02:00,144,I should have mentioned that the allcanada.com web site has a link for price. The link is to a checklist of what interests you and also to resorts in various price ranges. Helps if you are on a bargain or a luxury trip. The link is:http://www.allcanada.com/html/advsearch.cfm#Price
