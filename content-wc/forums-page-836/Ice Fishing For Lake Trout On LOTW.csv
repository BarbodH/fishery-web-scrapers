536295,Matches,2004-01-04 19:01:00,236,"Thanks for the Info. Darcy, I am naive to how popular ice fishing is on that part of LOW. My understanding is Ontario does not allow fish houses other than portables. Are snowmobiles the only mode of transportation on the ice, do many resorts offer ice fishing packages, etc.. any info would be apprecited."
