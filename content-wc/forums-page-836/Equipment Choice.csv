I want to buy them both a rod and reel and would like to know what you fisherman recommend. Im planning on buying one extra rod in case they break one. My budget is around $100 per rod and reel and have some flexibility. They have both used spinning outfits and Im leaning that way. Im in hopes that the Lodge we are staying at (Evergreen) will be able to direct us to some fish but would like to hear about line choices and lures from you too. I have a friend who is going to lend me his Depth Finder and GPS. He also has some rods and reels he will let us take for backup. Thanks, Gramps"
536226,Fred_G,2003-12-30 13:47:00,908,"Gramps, Cabela's has some great rod/reel combos that are priced around $100. Here's a link to one.http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...gif&hasJS=true I would say a 6 1/2' rod in a medium action would be fine for most any application. A 2000 size reel will provide plenty of line capacity also. I'm partial to Shimano reels, however there are many other good brands available also. Hope this helps!"
536229,MTJ,2003-12-30 15:49:00,106,"I would go with a Cabela rod (Medium Action) and a Shimano Symetry Reel. The last one I bought was around $125 for the combo. Just my preference. Good luck and most important, have fun."
536237,blackjack,2003-12-30 18:30:00,72,"If you wait for the Bass Pro Shops Spring fishing sale you can usually find some huge discounts on rod/reel combos. I paid $49.99 last spring for a combo which is usually $149.99. I would also check out the Cabelas spring catalog for combos and particularly the "" bargain cave"" area of the cabelas website. Another option might be to go to a Cabelas/Bass Pro/Galyans/ Gander Mountain/ Reeds etc. store nearest you and select 2 or 3 appropriate outfits and then let the kid make the final decision, the kids would love you for that. Good luck. It won't be a problem finding fish from Evergreen."
536243,Guest,2003-12-30 21:49:00,0,Check out the combos in Bass Pros Catalog. I just bought the Mitchell Combo...Love It
536270,Guest,2004-01-02 07:15:00,0,"You don't need anything special or high priced, unless you want to spend the cash. I have an Uglystick rod with Shimano reel and I think I got it for about $50. I think its more important that you lace it with good line (10-12 pound test) rather than spending a ton on the rod/reel, especially because its for kids. I snapped on line on 5 days of fishing...I am sure it was a shark. Good luck."
536276,Todd_NE,2004-01-02 09:46:00,1330,"Personal Opinion... For kids that age you might get them two rods and reels for the money. One nice 6 or 6'6"" spinning rod and another outfit for pike up there with a baitcasting reel. Spend $50 on a spinning combo and 75-100 on a baitcaster. Neither will be ""high end"" but you've got them on the road to learning baitcasting to boot. If you get two spinning outfits, get a 5'6"" light or ultralight outfit, that will be fun to watch on a few nice eyes! If you go to Lac Seul I've had great luck on the pike with Little Cleo spoons (better than dardevles) and also on the large size of Mann's 1- lures. Pike absolutely hate those Mann's 1 minus lures. Todd Oh yeah... I stuck her good... Feel that head shake... Walleye boats don't qualify as dinghy's in Cabo No... I meant to leave the back straps on. I wanted to see if the boat would float the trailer. No honey... Those aren't ALL my rods lures. I'm uh storing some for friends, ya, that's the ticket. By the way, don't let any of my friends offer ""to help you out"" by taking my fishing stuff if I die suddenly. Put it all on Ebay baby, it's better than life insurance!"
536299,Guest,2004-01-05 07:47:00,0,Took the boys shopping and bought them both two outfits apiece. Six foot ugly stick (medium) with a 2000 Shimano Solstace for Walleye and a seven foot MH Hank Parker combo with a Abu Garcia 4600c on a Lighting Rod for Pike. Their Dad bought split the cost with me and we all had a ball shopping. Both of the boys spent a few extra bucks on lures. They are really excited about going to Canada but not as much as me. Thanks for all the help to the WC Fisherman.
