Have any of you seen much of a rate increase over this year's rates? After the decline of the American dollar I kind of expected a healthy one.
536167,fishmaster,2003-12-27 11:18:00,209,Yep looks like most all of them are going up cause of the change in the dollar. Look for housekeeping plans to be jumping up to around 50 bucks american.
536175,Mr Ranger,2003-12-27 18:35:00,272,Our camp was about $600.00 Canadian per person this year. Their Canadian price only went up about $20.00 but out of pocket American is $100.00 per person more than last year. Guess we can't blame them since we have always gotten a #### of a deal before. Although I am not happy about it still feel it is a great place to spend a week. Great Fishing
536203,Atlanta Dave,2003-12-29 12:55:00,323,We got an increase of 300 dollars US on a trip that was 2400 US. Not real pleased about it .I guess at least it does not take effect till 2005 trips which we have to book Nov of 2003 with this outfit. Atlanta Dave

It will be interesting to see if the resort owners who have been passing on the ""savings"" to their customers ......with the exchange rate change will hold their price."
