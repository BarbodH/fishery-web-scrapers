4160121,Guest,2015-08-26 14:37:00,0,"I have been going to Remigny for 40 some years now. Glenn was my best friend so I was at camp Ronoda from the beginning to the end. Glenn also had a camp in Guren a few miles from Remigny before he bought Ronoda, I miss Glenn but still go up there, in fact I will be there on 8/28/15 but I stay at the next camp down called Cabines Dulong's, Gille is the owner and will bend over backwards to accomodate his guest. As far as fishing goes I have great success on both lakes (Remigny) and (Des Quinze) the walleye are outstanding better eating then lake Erie, they doin't get as big as Erie usually around 22 and the pike are big I caught a 54 ½ and Glenn wanted me to release it, NO WAY I said and did not. Des Quinse is subject to changes in water level do to the dam in Angliers and it's rocky so you have to pay attention to whats going on (by the way Glenn ash's are in this lake). Lac Remigny is better walley fishing well you don't have to hunt for the as much as De Quinse"
4183737,Guest,2015-09-06 07:13:00,0,"Just returned, OMG fishing was excellent, the first 4 days we fished remigny which we did ok but the last two days we fished Lac Des Quinze and that's when the fishing got crazy, my buddy landed a 30"" pike and it had a 12"" walleye hanging out it's mouth when we got it to the boat. Biggest walleye was 221/2"", averaged about 18"", lots of bass and a few perch. Water level was low but once you know where the rocks are not problem. Green Bay was the best then tiger Bay then the rock, use jig/worm/leech, gold spoon."

564743,joepa,2007-04-26 08:24:00,366,"ratherbefishing, We went to Camps Ronoda on Lake Remigny two years ago. I will never go back. Although the accomodations are very nice and the owner very helpful, it is not a true Canadian wilderness fishing location that I prefer. The lake was extremely low near the camp, 2' or less. Every time you started your motors you sucked up mud no matter how high you lifted it. You had to follow markers out very carefully and slowly or suffer damaged props and boat bottom. In order to get to deeper water, you had to go through a low rocky channel that changed daily. I ruined two props on my kicker and put a big dent in my keel. If you like to catch small pike, in August we did catch a lot of ""hammer handles."" I understand the pike are bigger in the spring. The walleye, if you can find them, were always in the 10"" to 14"" range. Very seldom did we catch anything bigger. If you do end up going there, fish the deeper water and especially around and behind ""bird poop"" island. Funny: Other guys that were there had a bass boat with a large motor. They would drift down the channel near the launch ramp, fire up and go full speed up the lake. Their theory was only the prop would be in the water and they wouldn't hit anything. One day another boat was towing them in. The whole bottom portion of their motor was gone. Glen, the owner, will help you any way he can, but if the water is low when you go, watch out! It just wasn't my cup of tea."

1397431,markkepka,2012-02-21 18:23:00,1,I was just on lake Remigny last season had a blast 20 to 30 walleye per day in a boat just got to know where to fish that lake this is my 10th trip every 5-7 years they get a dry summer but you just got to fish up the lake around islands it's around 20-40 feet worst case. We got few pike over 45 lots of small once as well. Great trip!
1397481,ohiojmj,2012-02-21 19:50:00,1262,"How are the newer owners? I had a blast and enjoyed my several trips when Glenn was the owner before he sadly passed. Lotsa nice water to fish for pike and walleye. Deep holes, rocky shoals, endless weed beds. Had good luck around the island with the platform and rope swing. We caught plenty when we knew little more than to cast mepps or williams wabler spoons. My son in blue jacket is still pictured on the website with a fat 38"" pike. Good lake even with some fishiing pressure."
1528385,fishon777,2013-01-24 16:03:00,3,I fished lake Remigny and stayed with camps ronoda been fishing there for past 21 years 2012 was the last time booked for next spring this is when fishing is at its best the new owners are nice they had made lots of improvments build 3 new cottages and now a brand new lodge with a restaurant I always take meals with them best food I ever had much better when Glen wao around.

1528650,fishon777,2013-01-25 08:28:00,3,I been to camps ronoda one summer the water level was low about 4 f at the dock its been a hot and dry summer this is why I always go in spring since water level are high and walley fishing is good do to sponing grounds right at the main camp all the fish after sponing come to the shallow bay looking for warm water. As for customers destroying boats its their own folt the chanel is clearly marked with tons of markers the new owners do a good job explaining the lake and provide you with good maps. I dont know where joepa is finding roks in the mark chanel since the first bay got clay in it maybe he was to drunk and doez not remember where he fished. I had seen some fisherman comming in to the camp drunk as skunks and been like that all week this are the once that find rocks eventually. Look at the web www.campsronoda.com the photos say it all there is to be said. Good lock.
