The wind was blowing perfect at this ridge,, the base was loaded with 12-22"" walleyes. A boat from a nearby lodge with 3 guys in it were driving past at full throttle when they saw me hook and land a 20"" fish.. They pulled up behind me,, on top of the sandbar and anchored in 11'.. I motored back upwind and pulled another fish out right beside them.. I did about 20 drifts catching 1 to 3 on every pass,, they couldn't hook one on top of the sandbar.. They had the balls to ask me if I had caught enough of this spot yet.. Nope,, I'm going too keep pulling them all around you.. They pulled anchor, said a few choice words and left.. Made my day."

4140073,fishron,2015-08-18 19:47:00,317,"This post brings to mind a situation my buddy and I found ourselves in many years ago. We were fishing Oswego harbor and river that night at a time when big walleye were plentiful if you knew how to get them. Our guide, a giant man who had quite a reputation, had entered the trolling pattern that all were expected to follow, giving adequate room for everyone's trolling lures behind the boat. A boat with three fishermen pushed in just ahead of us and their maneuver enraged our captain. He proceeded to edge up into the troll, and with very audible sounds, his prop cut their lures off. Not to be outdone, the boater swung around behind us to return the favor. I remember our captains words....get ready for a high speed maneuver as he swung his larger boat around and hit theirs with a wall of water. As hard as we tried, we couldn't get our lures in fast enough and as a result we wrapped the prop. You might think at this point, our captain might throw us overboard, but if you were his client, he was going to get you fish no matter what. As we drifted down the river, he untangled the lures from the prop, and I'll never forget his words. ''I'm going to put you guys ashore and ram that boat.......I'll probably kill the guy in the middle. (think I'm making this up, don't you?) As it turned out, when we got back to our position my buddy and I observed the boat and threesome hastily removing themselves from the river at a distant launch. Good move! We went back to fishing and managed to catch some impressive walleye that night. It was an extreme lesson in fishing etiquette and if you think you wouldn't have put up with our captains behavior, believe me, you better be packin' some heavy artillery if your into confrontation. Is there a moral to the story......well, don't fish with a maniac and watch your etiquette."
4140409,Aspencreek,2015-08-18 22:31:00,2911,"To the original poster, did you by any chance throw out a bouy marker, those things attract the under educated, overly enthusiastic, and generally unaware folks, like flies. Try something we do. Drop a marker well off your spot and see how many boats you can catch, for added fun keep track of where they are from (ie: MN, WI, IA or camp, etc.). After 15 yrs, the same state is the winner every year. Bet you can guess which one!!"
4140665,PRO-V1,2015-08-19 05:43:00,142,"I lived in Pickle Lake for many a year and got spoiled, fished St Joe, the allbany, and lots of other systems and never see another sole other than my native brother passing by going to check the nets or harvesting rice. When I moved down to Thunder Bay I was not used to people pulling up and fishing the same area as I was, and found this tough, I'm the type of guy that will move on it's a big body of water i'll find another spot. Last week it was a family trip, on the way back to camp I stumbled upon a hump in the middle of the lake holding a lot of fish. The next morning me and the young fella hit the hump, we could do no wrong, next thing you know a couple of boats pull up from the camp, we just packed up shop gave a wave and moved on to the next spot explaining to the young fella the proper etiquette, (for me) if somebody is fishing a spot move on there are lots of other spots on the lake..........I'm to old to sweat the small stuff. Mike"
4140857,last chance,2015-08-19 06:51:00,3262,I was fishing the st joe river in southern Michigan for salmon. people were lined up shoulder to shoulder. I got hung up and lost my lure. so I turn around to get the cold wind out of my face while I tied on another spoon. when I turn back around 2 guys have moved in right in front of me so I didn't have anywhere to cast without casting over them or casting beside them but then the stream current would have brought my line against there legs and they would have been caught when my spoon came to there legs. I was young but not stupid. I didn't want to start a fight with 2 guys that was bigger than me. so I just said a few choice words that had no effect on them. then I just left and have never been back to the st joe river.
4138753,Carnhzkr,2015-08-18 12:45:00,964,"I know this topic has come up almost as often as taking potatoes across the border, but this time it's different because this time it happened to me. So now it's my turn.Last week, I was fishing at a popular spot on Lac Seul. I'm sure those of you that fish the Manitoba / Stony Point areas know exactly where I'm talking about. Off of Stony Pt, there's a large plateau that runs about 20' deep. Along the edge of the plateau there's a drop off to about 30'. That ridge runs north and south, then turns back to the west toward Stony Pt. There's a lot of fishable area along that plateau and the drop off. So, I'm fishing the ledge one morning and mark a waypoint at a particular spot where we've had our best luck. Not surprisingly, two boats approach and pull up about 25 yards south of us. A little closer than I'd dare, I think, but as long as they keep their distance we'll get along like peas & carrots. I'm hovering around my waypoint, vertical jigging, and my four new friends are pulling spinners, I think, covering some water. Soon, I'm sandwiched between two boats. I can almost reach out and touch the closest one, so in the most sarcastic tone I can muster I face them and ask ""how's it going fellas"", to which I'm greeted with one ""good"" and one blank stare.I'm obviously fishing in the exact same spot they'd targeted, because we're soon doing figure eights around each other so I can stay on my waypoint. I know there are at least a hundred other spots within a couple miles where I can catch fish at that rate or faster, so I figure I've stared at this crew as much as I wanted and I'll go to my plan B. Looking back, I know I could have handled this differently. I could have simply driven away without saying a word - I know that's what Ghandi would have done. I could have given them the old, ""big lake, eh"" and hoped they'd take the hint. I could have politically suggested that perhaps they could move down the ridge a little so we wouldn't bump into each other, but figured that wouldn't go over well. Instead, my impulses took over and I told them, ""you win, you can have it. Good luck guys"". I heard ""good luck to you too"", just as I gunned my throttle. I believe it wasn't until the first wave of my wake rocked their boat that the ""oh, he was being sarcastic"" light bulb went off. What gave us a real chuckle was, the next morning we were back on that same spot when two familiar looking boats approached from the north. I could almost see the recognition form in one of the drivers' eyes as he stopped, then sped off to give us some of our own medicine after seeing my red Lund. Maybe I shouldn't be so possessive. I know I don't own that spot, but we were there first, and there's no reason to fish right on top of each other like that. In my mind, if there's only one spot you can catch fish in that area of Lac Seul, then maybe it's time to sell your boat and buy a set of golf clubs. It's quite possible that they are the four nicest guys you could ever meet. If we were neighbors, we'd probably be best friends, but that was a lousy first impression."
4138769,Lake Wisconsin,2015-08-18 12:51:00,1960,"Personally, I don't think you were out of line, and at the end of the day, you took the higher road, abit with attitude and wake. They got the message and hopefully learned from it. I have ran into this a lot, and now with fishing with my 10 year old son and 5 year old daughter, always take the high road. However, with that being said, we often fish with our dog. When it is hot, we have him ""fetch"" a bumper overboard to cool off. So rather than saying anything, if someone is close enough I can toss my bumper in their boat, they are too close. They usually get the message after 2-3 retrieves, without every making a confritation."

When He Caught A Trout He Had To Back Up To Get The Trout On Shore ... Then Put His Foot On It To Hold It While He Got The Hook Out .... You Guessed It .... He Backed Up .... Someone Jumped In His Spot .... They Didn't Realize He Was Fishing With Two Of His Brothers !!!
4139161,lightning rod,2015-08-18 14:39:00,15,"Space given to another boat depends on the situation. In Canada that space should be much greater than in the states. And that space can even vary depending on how populated the lake is with resorts and boats. In the states below a dam that space may be very close, and that would be acceptable. Years ago I was anchored on a hump and a guy was trolling circles around me so close it was affecting my cast. So I asked my young daughter if she could hit his boat with a cast. She nailed it right on the side of his Lund. She said sorry, reeled in her line, and he left. It's kind of hard to yell at a young girl dressed in pink that accidentally made a bad cast. She still remembers that moment but is too old to get away with it now."

4139657,youngknight,2015-08-18 17:06:00,228,"Granite Hill Lake...""walleye point""...a large area where maybe 7 boats were fishing...all with lots of elbow room between...there was plenty of room for someone wanting to backtroll on the dropoff without getting close to boats at all...but no, one guy motors over from the lodge and insisted upon backtrolling around...literally figure eights...3 of our boats...the dirty look was registered by his wife on board but I don't think she said anything. I would cast out just a tiny bit further to try to say...hey, this is my space, please stay outside it...but it had little affect. I had my son with me so I didn't make a scene at all...made sure he knew the guy was being a jerk and you need to respect other people's space. I think there was a point where his boat was maybe 12 feet from mine...the rest of us are jigging...I was trying to relax on vacation and felt my blood pressure rising. I wonder if idiots like that really have any idea that they are negatively impacting other peoples' experience and enjoyment and simply are putting their own desire over everyone else's or are they just clueless. My next fly in trip will likely be an outpost lake with no one else on it...not just because of this incident, but certainly this incident is contributing to that notion."
4139681,bigwillies,2015-08-18 17:13:00,515,"Told this story before, but have a whizz off the casting deck in their direction (assuming u r a guy) and make sure your pants are around your ankles. Ha! Done it. Works every time."
4139761,v-bay gord,2015-08-18 17:46:00,3168,"I think the better approach is to not ignore someone's bad behavior, but let them know they are pushing etiquette boundaries........without getting your blood pressure too high. In the end you may need to move to enjoy the rest of your day. German submarines had a nice feature on the nose to harpoon other vessels.....I would use it in a heartbeat if I had one...."
