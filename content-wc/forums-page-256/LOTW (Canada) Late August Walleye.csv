3707266,Clarence1,2015-03-29 13:16:00,29,"Hi, My wife and I will be spending the last week of August 2015 fishing Wiley's cabin outpost (not the island resort, but their cabin, maybe 12 miles south through French portage to cabin) in the heart of LOTW. We are new to LOTW open water. Cabin is on southern tip of Coste island, just above Falcon islands NE corner. If you picture where Tug channel goes north and meets into southern end of French Portage Narrow, and then the intersecting Johnston passage coming west to east, RIGHT at the Y intersection of the three is where we will be staying on southern tip of Coste island. We will be fishing primarily walleye, with a bonus of a sm bass or two if they are in that area. We prefer jig fishing, but if cranks or spinner rigs will way outperform, or help us to locate, we still like to catch fish too, just like all of you . We would be willing to travel up to 10 - 15 miles if need be, either north through French portage, south down tug channel, or west through and around Johnston passage. Our questions: 1. I see most folks use live bait on lotw ,primarily minnows for walleye when jigging. Anyone have decent luck with any artificial, such as a jig/plastic tipped with a 1"" chunk of crawler? or my favorite on Canadian dark water fly-outs, Trigger X on jigs? Any favorites to match hatch? Or should I just plan on trying to obtain a weeks worth of minnows and try to keep them alive somehow? If needed, any idea where to buy them between Int. Falls and Sioux Narrows? How do leeches compare if available? We will have a bunch of crawlers with us, unless someone says don't waste your time with crawlers. 2. If we will need to cover ground with harnesses and crawlers (or something I'm not thinking of), what kind of depth and maybe speed range would I expect to find walleye at the last week of August? Never really used harnesses much. Or other ideas? 3. How about cranks? Any opportunity to either troll or cast for either walleye or smallies? What depths/boat speed/structure would walleyes/small mouth relate to that time of year. 4. Is algae bloom get real bad that time of year in that area. 5. Any other late August comments in relation to where we will find higher concentration of walleye, how we may go about fishing them, and or if smallies, if present would be greatly appreciated. First time trips are always a bear, and takes me a week or more just to get a half an idea! With your help maybe we will be a bit more successful at the fish locating/catching. (And not spend a fortune at the bait shop buying crap we will never use) I know...we've all been there! I know I've put up a lot of questions, and don't expect all to be addressed, but if anyone can answer even one or two, please feel free to comment. Or even if you know the area, or the islands/humps area south of the Border islands, or area around Little traverse, and could throw any input at us at all, even if not related to any of my questions above, it would be a great help! Just hate to drag up a bunch of stuff we wont use... Thanks!"
3707458,Ndstallmann,2015-03-29 14:26:00,549,"Been to Canada three times. Twice Wicth Bay in July we used mostly jigs. Went to King island 1st week of September Walleye harder to find but when we found them we would jig. But we used spinner rig button bouncer to find them. After two days we realize we only caught the big walleyes (22"" plus) with spinner rig bottom bouncing. They were out of leeches by then, minnows worked better then crawlers. So that what we mostly did after that. We tried pulling raps didn't have much luck."
3707914,fishanytime,2015-03-29 16:12:00,63,I fish with folks who prefer crawlers and they do fine all year on LOTW's. I prefer minnows and they do very well on LOTW's. A friend uses 4 inch artificial crawlers all summer and most days will catch as many as I do. Use what you prefer and you will do just fine. Walleye's start to move toward the mouth of bays in late August but you can catch them off of points as well.
3708010,BornToFish,2015-03-29 16:27:00,1224,"I have fished for dozens of weeks in NW Ontario during August and September, but not on LOTW. I doubt that the lake that I fish is that different from LOTW at this time of the year. I have found that depth is consistently the name of the game for walleyes and smallies during August and September. The walleyes typically head deeper in search of more stable water temperatures. Many walleyes typically are 20-30 feet deep and associated with structure of some sort (rock humps, sand bars, points, etc.) The smallies will typically be in the same place as the walleyes, but shallower. I found that vertical presentations excel at this time of the year. Minnows are my favorite bait. Leeches work okay if you can find them this late in the season. Crawlers also work well. I vastly prefer live bait with vertical presentations rather than anything artificial. The fish just have too much time to study the bait before they decide to eat or pass on it. I would have some crankbaits, and rigs in the boat for just in case. You might find some walleyes relating to weeds. However, I wouldn't go out and load up on them. August and September are the time of the year when most walleyes are in schools. Find one walleye and you then know where they all are. Again, it's all about depth of water. I've noticed at the Lodge that I fish, many anglers fish in August and September and struggle. I believe they are using their favorite techniques from early in the season and simply find they don't work very well in autumn (i.e. late August and September). I hope that you and your wife make some great memories together!!"
3708978,stillangling,2015-03-29 20:19:00,149,"Clarence,Coste is a fabulous location. Nice one! You will have an unbelievable trip. I fish the adjacent waters frequently. Mostly for muskies. If you don't spend at least sometime in the evening fishing top water for muskies in the immediate area you are going to REALLY miss out. In terms of walleye it will be a bite on the humps at that time of the year. Your choices will be the Gardner/Bay Island area south of the Tug or go north into the area around Crescent Island. There will be a parade of boats heading north past your cabin each morning going north to fish humps. Those boats will be coming from the NW Angle. Never understand why anyone would stay there in MN and have to run that far into Ontario each day but that is another subject! In terms what to use it is a bait deal all the way. Minnows, leeches, worms in that order. You will be hard pressed to keep minnows two days at that time of year. Your cabin will have a refrigerator so buy a 1/2 pound of leeches at least. They will stay good if you change the water. As far as finding walleyes, look for isolated mid-lake humps that top out around 20'. Don't know if they have sonar units with the navionics or lakemaster chips. If not take your own! Absolute must to find structure that far from shore. Don't bother even starting to fish until you mark fish. The better fish tend to be shallower. 22 to 28' is normally prime. Saugers and smaller walleye tend to be deeper. Use the tiller motor to keep yourself vertical over the fish. Jigs all the way."
3709418,Blades-n-Beads,2015-03-30 05:02:00,484,"Clarence, x2 with stillangling. I fish LOW every July and august , in later August absolutely mid lake humps, I will pull bottom bouncers with#6 blades at 1mph with full crawlers when you slam a few go right back and sit on top of them if you are able to with jigs, if not depending on water conditions and your boat just keep back trolling with your bouncer rigs. I will usually use only crawlers and leaches this time of year. Have a great time."
3714954,Clarence1,2015-03-31 12:54:00,29,"I should have mentioned we will have our own boat, couple of 1100 series locators, terrova I pilot. So staying with them and keeping eyes on them, once we get a general idea, shouldn't be a problem. Thanks to all who posted, it will help us greatly. Any one else familiar with the area, please feel free to comment or suggest! Cant Wait!"
3738394,Clarence1,2015-04-07 06:35:00,29,"Flag Island, Thanks, I will check out on the map and circle those locations!"
4181033,Clarence1,2015-09-04 14:12:00,29,"August 22nd - 29th , 2015 Coste Island The women out did us guys. We fished primarily walleye . The 2 gals got a 27"" 26"" two 25 1/2"" and many from 20 to 24"". Best us guys had were a couple 24"" a 25 1/2"" and quite a few 20"" to 24""(we were still content and happy for the ladies) My wife and I don't generally count fish, but we decided to count one day. It was an average catch day. Surprised me when we just broke 100 fish that day. Not uncommon for us on fly outs, in fact we have broken 200 fish days with just the 2 of us on flyouts, but all walleyes, and nothing over 24"". What was really neat was the fact you never know what you will get on LOTW. We caught 6 different species in a very short time spot locked on one point. We got 12""+ perch, 18"" smallies, 30"" northern, 13"" crappies, average to larger 20"" walleye, sauger, and rock bass. I guess that 7 species. Simply amazing fishery. Minnows and crawlers were equal near as we could tell. I prefer jigging, but we bottom bounced a little more than jig, just because it was what they wanted the most it seemed. The only complaint I could come up with is out of anyone's control. Algae bloom and nasty high winds mixed with storms for the first 2 1/2 days. But that's Canada. ( Oh, and I never mustered time to throw for Muskie. Just too much going on every day. Shame on me, especially for the location we were in.) Thanks again all for your help and input on our maiden voyage to central LOTW. It was a blast! I'm already planning at least one if not two trips for next year."
3718762,BornToFish,2015-04-01 15:00:00,1224,"Your musky lures are classics. By all means, bring all of them! You might want to sharpen hooks, or maybe even replace some of them as may be needed. Throw them and they will work! Consider getting a map with depth contours for the section of the lake that you will be fishing. If you can find one, consider a SD card from LakeMaster or Navionics to work in concert with your gps. Look for off-shore rock humps and such that top out around 15-20 fow and are surrounded by deeper water. If nothing else works, just watch where the other boats are fishing as they will be by these rock humps. You might be surprised by how deep the walleyes may be, especially if you are accustomed to fishing earlier in the season. Vertical jigging and backtrolling work especially well when the walleyes are holding on the sides of the rock humps. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3718810,Clarence1,2015-04-01 15:26:00,29,"BTF, I do have two HBs... the 1199si/1159di / & Terrova I-pilot LINK on the boat , and am trying to find out which Lakemaster chips are the best/newest for LOTW to purchase. We plan on going a few times a year,so want to be equipped. I believe it is the Lakemaster WOODS/RAINY version 4 chip.........but haven't had time to research it all yet. When you are referring to the humps, I'm assuming you are back on walleye, or do the musky cruise those too. I was thinking Musky in evening casting shoreline structure for the Ski's..... no?"
3718834,Clarence1,2015-04-01 15:32:00,29,"Forgot to mention I have also been studying islands/humps points etc. on Navionics LOTW map on my computer. My cousin who use to manage ( I think Froelanders) in Monuement Bay sent it to me to study. Its nice, but I wish I could find the more detailed Lakemaster version to view on my computer."
3720066,BornToFish,2015-04-01 21:09:00,1224,"I started out talking about musky lures in my earlier post and then switched gears to talk about walleyes. The majority of the walleyes in the lake that I fish relate to offshore rock humps and such by middle to late August. The walleyes seem to move deeper as the surface water in the lake cools, in view of shorter days and cooler nights. They move shallower in the evening and deeper during the morning. Boat control is the key to fishing success! Late August in NW Ontario is more autumn like weather than summer like, at least in most years. I'm typically fishing 20-25 fow of water for walleyes in mid August, and typically 30-35 fow in mid September. This makes a lot of anglers uncomfortable, especially anglers that typically fish earlier in the season. The good thing about fishing in late August is that if you can find one walleye near a rock hump, you will know where they all are. It's all about depth of water. When I pull up to a rock hump and catch my first walleye, I'm thinking it's game on. I'm thinking I have a shot at catching every walleye on that hump. Many anglers struggle to catch their first walleye as they aren't too sure how to approach fishing so deep. In the lake that I fish, the biggest northerns and muskies in the lake are cruising these same rock humps during summer. These larger predators are eating walleyes and smallmouth bass. So, if you are catching walleyes and they suddenly stop biting, there is likely a good reason for this. The pike and northerns often move back to weeds when the water temperature cools. These cool water temperatures coincide with weeds dying off. The perch get concentrated into smaller patches of weeds. The northerns and muskies know this and take advantage of it. The fishing in late August and September can be challenging. However, the rewards are well worth it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3720362,Clarence1,2015-04-02 05:22:00,29,"BTF, Thanks, That is making sense. I actually prefer it when the walleye are at the 25 to 30 ft depth. I kind of forgot a couple years ago our fly - in Canadian lake owner called me to offer a deal on end of August trip on the lake that we were just at in mid - July. The walleye had moved off to about 28-30 depth, and in new areas. Two things I noticed: 1. Much more fun reeling the fish 25-30 than 10-15 feet! 2. The fish seemed fatter than they were in the summer and quite a bit scrappier! It was the Same lake 6 weeks later. 3. Also remember it was 80 degrees going in and snowing our last day there. And that one was a short 5 day trip."
3720450,stillangling,2015-04-02 06:10:00,149,"Top raider, jackpot (or similar topwater) and a 800 twin Bucher tinsel tail in Elvis colour! Remember you asked for it. Muskies will be on the rocks by then. Find yourself a saddle or a big shallow reef and be there as the sun is setting. In terms of the Navionics versus Lakemaster it won't make a lick of difference in spite of the advertising claims. The walleye structure you will be looking for is not subtle. Bigger the hump, the better."
3720738,zeebee,2015-04-02 08:09:00,1144,"I fish LOTW every year for a week in mid August and have for the most part come to rely on big baits. Troll water in depths of 15-30' and seek structure (points/reefs) or flats adjacent to deeper water.DHJ's, Deep Tail Dancers both in their respective largest sizes are my starting default rigs. I will also drag a F-18 and jointed J-13 behind a 2-3 ozs bottom bouncer. If the fish are finicky after a cold front its usually a slow death rig trolled as slow as possible while retaining action.Also keep a spinning set-up handy and as you pass a promising looking reef/point with say a large boulder on its edge, cast a 5"" swimbait on the shadow side. Some of my largest walleye have been caught in this manner in shallow water in mid-August.Ive come to firmly believe big rigs catch bigger fish. If you think your lure is a bit on the large size then go one step larger. Ive often observed the Musky fisherman in a given camp catch the largest incidental walleye while tossing 4 ozs 10"" baits leaving the dedicated 1/4 ozs jiggers scratching their heads.Mid August is a glorious time....likely stable weather, no bugs, less traffic and big fish."
3720922,Clarence1,2015-04-02 09:00:00,29,"Thanks still angling and zeebee. gives me a lot to get started with. I just dug out a pen and pad to write all these baits down to see what I have and if I want to pick up a couple of the others. Just come in from the shop from making/ painting jigs for wi. we fish flooded reservoirs, so I make my own similar to slow falls but truer to weight/higher quality hooks/ glow paints and a final uv coat. I like to use the powder paints and bake them prior to gluing in the 1/16"" x 7/8"" clear bristle weed guard. Hard as a rock after baking!! Weed guard I buy has 8 bristles ., I strip 2 off and leave 6. Makes for a good guard and walleye don't seem to notice. Lose very few jigs, or hookups for that matter. I am just finishing making gift kits for my 6 fishing buds. We should be set for a couple years except fill ins after today. Then I start on replenishing jigs for our fly- out, and then finally LOTW. Still have a lot of Canadian jig stash though, so wont need a ton.. Any suggestions on favorite colors or combo colors for live bait jigs/and/or plastics & gulp type artificial. (still have to try a few of the latter, but will definitely have bait with) on LOTW deeper water?? 25 to 30 feet late august......"

3738322,Flag Island,2015-04-07 06:19:00,32,From where you are staying you can also go up thru French Portage and fish walleyes along Skeet Island. Lots of water around there so it is always good. You can also just go south thru tug and fish Mc Pherson Island. Points and rock piles and you will be eating walleye every evening.
3716802,Clarence1,2015-04-01 04:34:00,29,"stillangling, Or any other Musky guy that fishes LOTW in late August. I've decided to sneak a couple Musky rods in for our trip. (I was going to leave Musky Rods to home as I was afraid if I dinged one, my wife and I would not get much walleye fishing in after that, which was our mission in the first place.)If you were given only three or so Musky baits, late august, on LOTW in our general location, which three would you choose and what size /color. Its been 20 years since I've thrown for Musky and lost touch of the names/baits and how too's of Musky hunting. But (stillangling) is RIGHT!I need to take at least a couple rods and cast in the evenings after a hard day of walleye fishing..... Any suggestions?"
3716882,BornToFish,2015-04-01 05:42:00,1224,"I will offer some general ideas for you to consider in terms of musky baits. I'm assuming that you might have a few musky lures in your basement or shop, rather than going out and purchasing new tackle. You might check out Rollie & Helen's website for more ideas if you want to do some window shopping or actual shopping. Topwater - e.g. a Bucher TopRaider or Tallywacker Jerk Bait - e.g. a Suick or Bobby Bait Minnow Bait - e.g. a Shallow Raider, Slammer. or Grandma Crank Bait - e.g. a Depth Raider, Ernie, or Triple D In-Line Blades - e.g. something from Mepps Again, I'm assuming that you and your wife are focused on walleyes, and might dabble into muskies. The above list is a starter list. The combinations of lure size and colors makes for a much longer list, and bigger investment. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3717474,Clarence1,2015-04-01 08:18:00,29,"Actually I do have 3 or 4 from your list. My assortment (of maybe 25 baits) is from the 80s, so didn't know if after 30+ years some of the newer baits and technology has advanced to the point that I may need to pick up a couple of ""modern age"" baits. Glad to here a few from my arsenal will still catch fish! Thanks BTF"
