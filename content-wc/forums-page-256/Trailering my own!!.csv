4179801,WowMarie,2015-09-03 21:07:00,19,"You have to have a certificate of insurance for your vehicle and your boat. Most people do not know this, but State Farm says you need it.very simple to call your agent and have them emailed to you."
4180089,BornToFish,2015-09-04 06:03:00,1224,"The proof of auto insurance is commonly called a ""yellow card"". I obtain one each season at no cost from my auto insurer. I am not aware of anything in this regard for boats/trailers, but haven't pursued this matter. One of the guys in our group looked into ""yellow cards"" and reported that they are not required to enter into Canada. However, having a ""yellow card"" with you will greatly simplify your life should you need to prove while in Canada that you have auto insurance (i.e. have a mishap). Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4167625,Thompmd,2015-08-30 06:32:00,320,"I too had a New Ranger so I understand your concerns. I went to LOTW from north central indiana,875 miles. Gravel roads weren't an issue. I bought a hand held GPS with a map but nothing is full proof, and be careful on new routes. I think LOTW has the best variety of all species and we targeted them all and we were never disappointed. One of the things I would be concerned with is docking your boat and having slip covers for the seats. Even today when I look at different places to stay I always look for pics that show the dock. Also in my experience very few camp boats come with a bow mount trolling motor and camp boats won't have close to the dry storage as your boat and as others have mentioned, Having everything in your boat is wonderful. You should also verify that your boat is insured in Canada."
4167761,razorray,2015-08-30 07:46:00,1,we pull to hudson every year with 5 boats never any issues all paved. fish lac seul on lac seul floating lodges.
4168049,trapper_john,2015-08-30 10:06:00,83,We've been going to Wabaskang for years. No problems at all.
4168241,28frawleydan,2015-08-30 11:38:00,18,"www.pleasantcove.com My buddies and I have been going to this fish resort since the early 90's. It's about 3 hours north west of Toronto on Highway 400 (turns into Highway 69). If your worried about gravel, this resort is a relief. It's about 1.5 miles off the main highway, paved road all the way. Best fishing for us is always first week of May, great Pike and Smallmouth. Owner Bruce Bishop will take you out for an hour tour and show you many good spots that are easy to get to without endangering your hull. Spend $220 on a Lake Huron chip for your Chart, and you'll feel even safer. Good resort for taking family as well, has a pool, sport court, small beach, etc. Take Rapala X-Raps and Williams Wablers..."
4169113,BornToFish,2015-08-30 19:39:00,1224,"There is considerable wisdom above. There are hundreds of good lodges for you to choose from. The key is matching your expectations to what the prospective lodges offer. Be skeptical of ""blind"" recommendation for a lodge, as ""all lodges are on lakes with great fishing and all lodge owners really know how to take care of their guests."" Some things to consider when trailering your own rig:Be sure that your rig is insured in Canada.Have proof of ownership when you cross the border, just in case the border services officers are looking for a rig like yours.Does the lodge have battery charging and is there a fee?Does the lodge have a launching/docking fee?Does the lodge provide gas for your boat?Be sure to have your wheel bearings serviced prior to leaving for Canada.When docked, will your boat be at more/less/same risk during bad weather than the lodge boats?Where does the lodge have you keep your trailer?Have with you a jack for your trailer.Check your spare tire's air pressure.Be certain that your boat is compliant with all safety requirements in your home state.Have with you proof of boating safety certification in your home state.Have with you a tool kit to make quick repairs to your rig should the need arise. - e.g. wire connectors, fuses, duct tape, wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers, hammer, breaker bar/sockets, flashlight..... Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4169625,28frawleydan,2015-08-31 06:23:00,18,"If you don't have a boating safety certificate in your home state, you can take the Canadian Pleasure Craft Operators Certificate (PCOC) online or at selected Cabelas or Bass Pro Shops in Canada.www.cps-ecp.ca/pcoc/https://www.boat-ed.com/canada/"
4172321,btebb,2015-09-01 08:51:00,339,So if I haul my own boat to Canada I must have this?
4172393,LOW1,2015-09-01 09:03:00,2828,"https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafet...sitor-1610.htmNo, not unless the boat is registered in Canada or you will be there for 45 days or more.But taking a US course through someplace like the Power Squadron or the canadian course online will be helpful, especially if you are going to some place that has an organized buoy system."
4172409,btebb,2015-09-01 09:09:00,339,"Ok, Thanks, Just going to Rainy Lake in Oct for 5 days. So will be good to go. Labelle's Birch Point Camp."
4172641,BornToFish,2015-09-01 10:12:00,1224,"I concur with LOW1. However, having a certificate of having completed a boat safety course does provide certain benefits. It simply gives a MNR or OPP officer less to complain about. I receive a discount on my boat's insurance policy having completed a boating safety course. I understand that completing the boating safety ""class"" offered at various fishing lodges qualifies you to receive reimbursement of a portion of the HST that you pay to the Canadian government when you stay at a fishing lodge. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4167017,jdan9,2015-08-29 15:15:00,5,"I'm new to the site. I just bought a new Ranger and am considering towing it up to NW Ontario next summer. Haven't fished Canada in 20 years and I'm just starting to research destinations. That last thing I want to do is tear the new rig up while trailering it on gravel or rip it up on a lake with lots of underwater hazards. Any and all advice, comments and recommendations on lodges are welcome and appreciated.Thanks, jd"
4167041,BRP,2015-08-29 15:39:00,77,"You can get to lake of the woods (kenora) on all good highway from east, west or south. Any basic gps sonar unit will keep you safe from rocks on the lake. You can catch any species you want within a half hour of Kenora or stay at one of many great boat access camps, 20 to 30 minutes out on the lake. I'm a little biased as my cottage is 5 minutes from kenora, but it is my favorite place on earth. Caught 40 fish in 2 hours today with the kids. Good luck with your new boat and your trip."
4167113,1700SS,2015-08-29 16:32:00,104,"Morson area on Lake of the Woods also has paved roads all the way. Lots of good resorts to choose from, but I stay at Red Wing Lodge."
4167129,jkretch,2015-08-29 17:23:00,80,I fish Vermilion Bay Area of Eagle Lake. Good roads might be a little gravel on camp roads but they are less than a mile from main road. Hazards marked well on lake. StYed at both Andy Myers and Eagle Lake Sportsmens. Would recommend both. Good variety in lake.
4167241,jdan9,2015-08-29 19:15:00,5,"Thanks guys, that's the exact type of feedback I'm looking for. Do you trailer your own boats?Looks like a 12-13 hour drive from Northern Illinois!!"
4167345,Aspencreek,2015-08-29 20:20:00,2911,"Yup, about right to any of the spots already mentioned. Interstate all the way to Duluth, then 4 lanes past Virginia, then good 2 lanes all the way to the border."
4167385,jdan9,2015-08-29 20:57:00,5,My biggest concern is miles of gravel roads! Pavement all the way would be nice plus it'd be nice if the fishing was REAL good!! Is the fishing better on Lac Seul then let's say Lake of the Woods or Eagle Lake? jd
4167417,Aspencreek,2015-08-29 21:15:00,2911,"Now you may have started something!!! In my opinion, you have the correct order but others will disagree, they are all great fisheries."
4167457,ftfarms,2015-08-29 22:42:00,444,We fished lac suel for over 15 years awesome walleye fishery switched to lake of the woods and haven't been back to lac suel since. Everyone has a opinion on what they like. Fish on both lakes can be awesome. The kicker for me was its a 12 hour drive to morson and a 14-14 1/2 hour to where we stayed at on lac suel. I can't say much about eagle lake Ive only fished it once. The week we fished eagle the weather was all over the board. The only thing I would say is the average size walleye we caught may have been bigger on lac suel. For me I like lake of the woods the best.
4167545,revitup,2015-08-30 05:24:00,140,"I have learned from experience (I won't go into those ""experiences"") that to feel comfortable trailering a prized possession that far you must go through proper ANNUAL trailer preparation, no matter how new your rig is. I now schedule that the week prior to departure. With that done, I much prefer my boat to camp boats. I fish at Cedar Lake, going about 8 miles on gravel."
