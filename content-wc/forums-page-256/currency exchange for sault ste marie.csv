Is casino best option, or would it be best to go to a bank in a town on the way to nakina. The rate at duty free america was 121.50.....on ICE website it listed 131.00. Any suggestions appreciated."

I believe after our Memorial day they stay open 24/7 unless that has changed also. I use www.xe.com and we found that whatever that says we got very close to that amount. At the money exchange just through customs they will dock you a good 5 to 7 cents. We been stopping at the bank in WaWa and they have treated us pretty good maybe a penny or two. There are several banks we have also used right at the Soo Canada. Always make sure you have two pieces of ID. At the Casino I think they give you the most they can they must figure you are going to spend it in the Casino anyway.
