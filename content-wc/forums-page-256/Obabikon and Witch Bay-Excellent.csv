Snacks and drinks for the boat and the cabin at night. Check with them in advance about the bait they have. When we were there they only had crawlers. If you prefer leaches or minnows, you can pick them up in town on way in. Their camp boats are excellent. Fishing from the dock is excellent, which might be a good thing with kids. Good amount of jigs - and patience, as you'll lose your share via snags. Take full advantage of the guide/fishing service they offer. They will bring you to places to catch fish and they allow follow boats. All part of the deal. Enjoy, it's a great place."
4179897,emma17,2015-09-03 22:08:00,436,I am proof that Jared will figure a way to keep you on the water while he gets what you need. Losing my TM prop was a big bummer as my teenaged sons really looked forward to casting for toothy critters. I had my new prop first thing in the morning.
4180633,eyeman_1,2015-09-04 10:47:00,690,Great to hear! The kids are all between 12 and 18 so they boys should have plenty to keep busy with. We'd been staying over in the Big Narrows area so we are familiar with the lake just not Witch and Andrews Bay. I would expect to find fish in similar areas. We do a lot of bottom bouncing with spinners and crawlers or Lindy rigs w/ leeches so we always pick up bait in Nestor Falls on the way up.How is the road into Witch Bay. We'll be bringing a Ranger and a big Lund? How is launching at the resort? Any issues charging trolling motor batteries etc..?Do we need to bring fans or is the AC in the cabins pretty good?Can you tell me what meals are like and what to expect for heading out early in the am? What is camp life like in the evenings etc...? The adults will have no problems especially with a beverage and cigar at night. Just wondering if we can keep the boys happy when on shore.Thanks again for all the great info and comments. We've been looking to head here the last couple of years and look forward to going.

When you get to the fork in the camp road go to the right. Meals are fantastic, home cooked all you can eat. My 17 and 18 year old boys never left hungry. You will be assigned a dock spot which is yours for the week. Each spot has power for battery charging. I found with my boys they are worn out by the end of the day so usually fish till dark and hit the sack. If they want something to do while your having a couple of cold ones they can fish off the dock and catch as many northerns as they'd care to. Some of newer big cabins have AC."

Both camps are excellent and worthy of new and repeat business. Obabikon: 'A ""boat to"" camp with a great location for accessing all species of fish. Our group of 5 fished 4 days from July 31-Aug 3 and we did very well with larger fish. We had several Walleye in the mid 20's with the largest just over 29"" and another at 27"". We had a couple Pike in the high 30's as well as a 15"" Crappie. We raised two large Muskie while jigging Walleye, both snapped the lines and soon as they realized we disturbed their slumber. Our largest Walleye were found in 14'-16' of water believe it or not. Minnows were the bait of choice. We spent most of our time in Obabikon Bay and a bit on the eastern side of Miles. Jared runs a great camp and he is always helpful, whether it's fish location or finding a replacement prop for my trolling motor. Witch Bay: A real special thank you to Gail and Steve as they did so much to make our trip great. My wife has some health issues that can make the simple things we take for granted a challenge, and Gail and Steve went out of their way to help. We were there from Aug 21 to Aug 24. The camp is clean and the staff incredibly friendly and helpful. We did very well in terms of numbers, catching eater size walleye and nice sized SM nearly every location we tried. We caught fish from 14' to 30'. We struggled to find large fish- I'm not sure why. The bait of choice was crawlers. The whether was interesting to say the least. Our first day was shorts and t shirts, and then the storms came, and then the cold. Our third day was 48 degrees in high winds and rain. The beauty of it all is that my wife fished every second of it (only stopping for lunch and dinner). We found fish in Witch Bay and Andrews Bay and nearly every place that looked good. The fact that my wife cannot wait to return given the very difficult weather we had is proof of the excellence of this camp."
4164129,Ndstallmann,2015-08-28 09:03:00,549,"We been to Witch Bay three times, Steve and Gail run a great camp. It is my wife's favorite vacation!"
4164809,Shorelunch,2015-08-28 12:17:00,554,"We have a cabin out of Morson, but if I was to stay at a resort in the Morson area, Obabikon would be a good choice. It's at a great location, scenic and close to fantastic multi-species fishing."
4164969,Obabikon,2015-08-28 13:48:00,2370,Thanks for the kind words! It was great having you guys!!!
4165057,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 14:25:00,1528,Looks like a great place. Question: if you boat in is the parking area a long way if you left something in a vehicle or trailer? Or is it a long boat drive?
4165177,Obabikon,2015-08-28 15:18:00,2370,"I'm assuming you're talking about Obabikon. We're just under 8 miles from the Marina where we launch... so it depends how fast you drive. Also, guides, workers, and myself are coming back and forth daily... and are happy to pick things up out of cars."
4165241,SinOrSwim,2015-08-28 15:28:00,1528,Yes. Also can you clarify how that works on the rates. 3 days and then 3 days/4nights have different prices? How does that work?
4165449,Obabikon,2015-08-28 16:56:00,2370,Not meaning to hi jack the thread. 3 days is if you arrive in the AM... 3 days/4 nights is if you arrive in the evening.
4176377,eyeman_1,2015-09-02 14:03:00,690,We are booked for Witch Bay next 4th of July week... looking forward to it. Can anyone tell me pro's / con's.... what do we need to bring that isn't obvious. Taking a couple of our own boats and renting one... Group of 4 kids and 5 adults... been going to another lodge across the lake from here so first time to new place in a while. Thanks for all info.
4177233,Ndstallmann,2015-09-02 19:20:00,549,"Bottle water for in the boat! Snacks in boat, which really aren't needed because they feed you well. They have bait, but a limited supply of tackle."
