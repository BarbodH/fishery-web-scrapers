We had trouble with the trolling motor motor on the boat we rented, probably a bad contact, so we ran back to the lodge and they immediately swapped out our boat with another and gave a us a free tank of gas. No time wasted trying to suss out the problem. I had expected to lose half a days fishing and the whole process took just 1 1/2 hrs when we would have just been lounging mid-day. There was also a heck of a wind, more on that and fishing later, and a good size branch fell on my car and dented it. Bob took pictures from all angles to help with an insurance claim and went above and beyond to make it right with me. Great, great people. If you are looking for a lodge give them a shout. The Outpost is booked but I had them put me on a waiting list and got in the first year due to a cancellation. I've already re-upped for next year. The fishing was good as always. We hit the water on arrival and thanks to steady warm weather just crushed them on Saturday night. First stop it was fish after fish on jigs. What color was hot? You tell me; we were getting them on chartreuse, brown, peanut butter & jelly, white, green and yellow. Casting and vertical jigging were equally effective anywhere from 8' to 25' on the point. The average size continues to increase, too. Very few fish under 14"", tons in the 15""-18"" slot and more fish over 18"" than we have caught before. We didn't get any over 24"" but marked many larger fish in water deeper than 30'. I choose not to fish that deep so we didn't try them. As the water cooled though they began to move shallower and I don't doubt the group that is there this week is lighting them up. Thursday morning my son got a 22"" that had a Burbot in its mouth. We also hammered the smallmouth when we targeted them. Plenty of fish in the 16""-19"" range that were willing to hit jigs and crankbaits. Probably would have had a good topwater bite if the wind hadn't come up. As it was my son got some every night wading around the cabin. What can you do about the weather? Dress for it and take what it gives you. We continued to do well through Sunday as the wind picked up but Monday the temps had dropped 20 degrees with strong winds and a light rain. The fish scattered and we had to search out smaller schools that would fish out in less than an hour. Planning strategy is half the fun of walleye fishing, right? Once we got on a school we would catch 10-20 between three guys and a lot of spots had slim pickings, only producing a half dozen or so. The fishing improved as the cold front held until Wednesday afternoon. The water dropped from 68 to 60 in the strongest wind but climbed back to 64 on Thursday. I had the best luck fishing aggressively while my son was tattooing them on tube jigs. Next year I'll bring more of those. He caught a nice pike but gill hooked it and it died boat side. It was in the same spot where the night before I had a bite off as I reeled up to net another fish. When we cleaned the pike my jig was all the way in his stomach. Guess he wanted it. We only saw three other boats the entire week which may be because of the weather. Normally we see about one a day. If you are looking for a near fly in experiance at half or less the cost you should check out Happy Day and get on the waiting list for the outpost. They do have some openings at the lodge too if that suits you but they fill up fast with repeat customers. As we were leaving we spoke with a couple who had been there since mid-July and would be back next year. Good spot for those who prefer to stay east of Superior."

I fish western Quebec and we had the same pattern last week of July. Pull 10 or so fish quickly, thats it have to move on. We had a full moon or close to it not sure if that affected things or not."
4174569,kzoofisher,2015-09-01 20:12:00,5144,"Hmm, we also had the full moon. Targeted walleye to SM 80/20 and caught quite a few smallies anyway, never went after the pike. We walked over to Kathleen and rowed over to the mouth of the river which is stacked with fish but needs at least a day of rest between fishing. Goldie is said to be phenomenal for bass but we've never gone back to the lodge to rent a motor for it. I suspect that a lot of the fish that were hanging deep were moving up shallow after dark. they tended to be suspended just above the thermocline and within 50 yards of obvious shallow structure. Maybe next year we'll get a quiet night and I'll have the nerve to motor around after dark. Much more likely to get the good weather than the nerve."
4176937,fsz,2015-09-02 17:17:00,144,"Thanks. I'm no expert, but on many shield lakes I do believe on a full moon fish (walleye) ""nibble"" and feed all night slowly but surely. Daytime fishing is slow, and I never have the patience to fish past 11."

4177249,BrianE,2015-09-02 19:23:00,98,"Very nice, thanks!"
4178201,Krisco,2015-09-03 08:08:00,12,"Thanks for the detailed report, sounds like you guys had a great week! I have a friend who is there this week and looking forward to his report when they return. Staying at the outpost is the way to go if you can get in, lots of great structure out that way with little pressure. Hopefully next trip you get into at least one of the back lakes. Already looking forward to my next trip May 2016, early season can be a great time on this lake as it is much easier to locate fish. Contrary to what many people say this large body of water can be an excellent fishery for a drive to camp once you figure it out."
4179105,kzoofisher,2015-09-03 14:22:00,5144,"Crayfish. I don't know how active they are in the spring but the fish we kept were full of them last week. When the going got tougher we went to darker jigs, especially browns and olives, and kept them close to the bottom but not at a crawl. I put my rod tip inches above the water, scooting them along in 6"" to 12"" hops and was rewarded with solid hits. That position also helped in the wind and a jig fisherman with my skillz can use all the help he can get. My son stuck with tube jigs in green pumpkin and tan and did as well or better than anyone. He often vertical jigged at the back of the boat, using the swing on the anchor rope to cover more water. He remained almost vertical because of the 3/8 weight and was able to hop the thing around in a 5'-10' arc. Really nice thing about the tubes is that they don't fall into the small spaces in the rocks. He hung up far less often than the much more experienced guys with our tiny 1/4 and 1/8 jig heads. The bodies on them last forever, too. The style just allows you to catch dozens of fish on a single body. Much more durable than twister and paddle tails and infinitely longer lasting than craws."
