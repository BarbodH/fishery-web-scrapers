Stuff happens sometimes. There's still 3 of us going on the trip. The outfitter wants extra dollars from me because the package price includes a boat and motor for each two fishermen. None of us would consider fishing 3 in a boat. The boats are 20 years old while the 15 HP 2 stroke outboards are 11 years old and both have been kicked around by fishermen. What is a reasonable extra charge for me to pay for the use of a boat and motor by myself? Thanks in advance."
4179617,Obabikon,2015-09-03 19:23:00,2370,We have 17' boats with 30's on them. We rent them (with a tank of gas) for $125 per day. (so ~$60/person~) I would say the smaller boat and motor... maybe in the range of $30-40 extra per day. Just estimating.
4180097,ftfarms,2015-09-04 06:16:00,444,We had this same thing happen a couple years ago Where we stayed charged us $100 Extra per man. There boats are nice with newer 20 hp four strokes. Our package gives you 2 dozen minnows a day and 5 gallons of gas per day. I brought my boat so they gave us everything the package includes with both boats and no dockage fees. We where all fine with it.
4180121,v-bay gord,2015-09-04 06:41:00,3168,Just for the mixed gas you will burn during the week will likely be in the $100-$150 range. Assuming the owner wants to make at least $50 a day on the boat/motor....that would make it $300 for the week plus the $150 to cover the gas..........$450 for the week? If your base rate includes boat costs based on two anglers then I would assume you are on the hook for $225 as an extra charge. Am I close?
