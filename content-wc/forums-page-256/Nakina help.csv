4162441,dog2,2015-08-27 14:36:00,198,Both Pennocks and Nakina air service sell license. Pennocks also sell bait But if you need a flat I would check the bait shop outside of Soo.[r side on 17].If you cross after 700am the Walmart in Soo is open it's a super center .Idont know what time they close.We plan on a return trip to Kayedon high water or low we liked it.Have a good safe trip!
4163337,hoppy63,2015-08-27 22:41:00,367,Thanks dog. Hope all goes well. We have good group.....if we can find a few fish to eat and weather is decent I'm sure it will be great. Ill post a report when we get back. Don't expect it to rival Mikes reports though!!!!! LOL

4172113,uv2021,2015-09-01 07:23:00,48,I was just in nakina.I talked to some people who just came out of kaydon.They had been there four times and this year was the best.
4172729,Guest,2015-09-01 10:39:00,0,"Just came back from Kayedon. The lake water is low, so be careful of submerged rocks just below the water surface. We did really well on the walleye and pike. The way to get to speckled trout rapids was too low to get via boat, we got stuck. Casting rapalas anywhere there was current, including the rivers was great. Jigging with twistertails, any bay with weeds, you can catch a pike on every cast. Mike"
4174689,hoppy63,2015-09-01 21:00:00,367,"Any problem getting to ogoki???? Have never been here. Any ""go to"" spots to get fish for dinners??"
4175553,Guest,2015-09-02 08:53:00,0,"There were two areas on river to Ogoki that got a little hard. You need to go around Lord Island to the east, then up the river, you cannot get through the west. Right at the beginning of the way to get to Ogoki there is a set of fast moving water with submerged rocks. We went slow with someone up front keeping watch, and were able to navigate through. Stick to the left about halfway into them, then cut to the right bank, move up and then cut to the left. Still remember the pattern. Getting into Ogoki, go to the left of entrance to lake along shore, cut into the entrance and motor in. There is a big submerged rock smack dab in the middle of the entrance just below water, and the entrance to the right is very shallow with large rocks. Took us about 45 mins to get to Ogoki via the river. Go to spot for walleye dinner? Set of rocks just to the west of camp in about 12 FOW. There will be 2 large submerged rocks you need to watch out for. Water was coming up a few inches when we left, so you might have different options/fishing. If you are staying at AWO cabin, bring some form of water filter to run boiled water through. If you want to give me an email we can communicate that way."

4161025,hoppy63,2015-08-26 23:05:00,367,"]Making last minute preparations for trip next week to nakina. Was wondering where best place to get groceries on way up, and some live bait/crawlers? Also not sure if we can get fishing liscence in nakina. Against the advice of some on here, I've decided to give kayedon/ogoki a shot. Any reports or advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance for any info."
4161041,EddieNorth,2015-08-26 23:11:00,32,"Daneffs in Geraldton,you can order ahead of time and they will have it at the airbase ready for your flight."
4161081,adempsey,2015-08-27 00:38:00,963,"We bought our perishables at Pat's No Frills. No Frills is part of the largest chain of grocery stores throughout Ontario and has a decent selection. They do not accept Visa though.Our flat of worms I pre-ordered from Pennock's, where we stay the night before our flight."
4161113,hoppy63,2015-08-27 03:06:00,367,"Thanks for replies.....where is Pats located, and can you still get liscences at pennocks?"
4161129,Ogoki,2015-08-27 04:03:00,291,For license I buy online or stop at the Trading Post at the Soo. It is lcated on the north side of the Soo just as you are leaving town. Right side of road.
4161273,Bill Krejca,2015-08-27 06:20:00,6107,"If you are going up through Thunder Bay, turn right off the main highway on Arthur street. Several blocks on the left is a large grocery store which we used to stop at. Since No Frills in Geraldton now does not accept Visa, we probably will be again going to the store in TB. It may be a Safeway. Bill"
4161937,adempsey,2015-08-27 11:05:00,963,"Pat's is located at the south end of Geraldton. I linked the website that has a map showing its location. Not sure about the licenses, best to give them a call.https://www.google.com/maps/place/10...5701c?hl=en-US"
4161977,oleJoe,2015-08-27 11:22:00,114,"Nakina air lines sells license and I pretty sure so does Pennocks. Just don't wait to get them in the morning. Being that the lady that runs, weights and helps to load the planes sells them and is very busy in the a.m. Oh she makes the coffee too. Have a good trip."
4162017,hoppy63,2015-08-27 11:34:00,367,"Perfect, fellas.....thank you. The only other thing is eggs.......are they still on the banned list?"
4162081,SinOrSwim,2015-08-27 12:07:00,1528,"yes. If the potato history shows anything, I wouldn't expect this to be lifted for many years."
