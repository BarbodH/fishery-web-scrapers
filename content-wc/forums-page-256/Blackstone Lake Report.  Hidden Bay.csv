The fishing was truly phenomenal! First time with Hidden Bay and can't say enough about the staff. Bonnie, Wilma and Shaggy welcomed us like family. Taking care of every detail we expected and then some. I've done some fly in near the US border before but the fishing on this trip was outstanding. First day was with some rain slowed the fishing, the the next 3 days made up for any slow down. We went for the walleyes and was not disappointed. Size and numbers were amazing. one 30, a few 27 and 28's. Too many to count over 18 we had to toss back. It was not easy to find ones to keep to eat. We are not big on northern fishing, but Bill landed a nice 40 while fishing for the walleyes. Fishing late season kept the bugs away too. They were nowhere to be found. Hidden bay kept us well feed. Loved them home baked pies. The food plan is the only way to go. No need to make any extra stops to load up on groceries. We were worried we may not catch enough to eat, that faded quickly. the internet and phone at the cabin was a great service. Nice to be able to call home and tell the kids about the fishing after just coming off the lake. Highly recommended! We will be rebooking for 2016."

They have Highstone lake that a 2 adult minimum but would prefer some of the other lakes. Fly-ins are hard for just a couple but understand with the minimum due to aircraft, gas and insurance to do so."

I failed ,in an epic manner, to get him into the 40"" club on Eagle Lake. He has worn the 39"" mark off on his measuring stick and he may be approaching the brink of northern OCD syndrome. Good luck, tight lines and stay warm up there. Look forward to hearing about the trip. BTW..........no pressure on the challenge. PjShorthorn."

Don't think you guys are allowed to motor down into St. Joe, but it's okay going the other way. We navigated the river almost to Blackstone one day just for fun, caught fish everywhere.Blackstone looks like a great lake, thanks for the lowdown."
