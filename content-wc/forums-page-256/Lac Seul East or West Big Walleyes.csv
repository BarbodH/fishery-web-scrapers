4142617,dan cardinal,2015-08-19 16:13:00,64,I am at least fishing in the right direction.
4143313,bigwillies,2015-08-19 19:42:00,515,If u guys think the bigger fish migrate west. Try Adamhay in the fall. Wow!
4143761,pjshorthorn,2015-08-20 04:21:00,5654,Adamhay is part of the Root River system at the very northeastern end of Lac Seul. I would love to hear about your adventures on that lake. We were to camp at Coones Bay in 1982. The native Canadian indians were exercising their right to trap and fish in the area we had reserved. Our outfitter highly recommended not trying to camp there at that time. Never made it back to the area over all these years. Maybe one day.......... PjShorthorn.
4143985,prov1800,2015-08-20 06:10:00,5010,"Ever since 12-15 years ago the big fish have been declining.there was a large abundance of 28-29""fish with some at 30"" and over but not many.i have been fishing lac seul since the 80, s.lac seul is hindered most years from bad water levels either high or low.all these situations have effects on how the walleye spawn and who ever is responsible for keeping these levels normal doesnt seem to be doing a very good job.once a year class of fish either die off or get caught there gone and with bad spawns it takes to long to get them back.its the same on the east end of the lake.i have fished there as well.i have also observed the amount of boats there its very busy and right now is also a very dangerous situation for the walleyes as they are deep and bringing them up from that depth is going to kill a lot of them even if you think they look healthy when they are released. I rather look for them shallower this time of year.there are a lot of problems for walleye population's.but after all is said and done the fishing is still pretty awesome there."
4146433,bigwillies,2015-08-20 17:24:00,515,"it was quite a few years back when we went and seemed later the better. there was a spot off the vermillion river road that a fella could put a boat in. not any bigger than a 16 foot with a 40 horse. went down a little creek(sometimes breaking ice and we always had a high power rifle for that just in case.for moose) and come out close to where we wanted to fish. a river flowed into adamhay that was a sanquarie. fishing just outside that in the channel that was there was amazing. those trips where u didn't bring fish home. over slots like crazy. may have cuaght the odd one under but that was it. between 2 or 3 guys we always caught at least one over 30"" each. haven't done it in years(dam kids!). only problem was when the wind shot straight down that lake it was like the main body of lac suel. nasty!"
4146513,Lmbkiller,2015-08-20 18:08:00,639,"Prov, it is my understanding that hydro is first and the resource is second in Ontario. I was told this by a lodge owner who worked in hydro in his younger years. Drawing the water down on lac seul the way they do is exactly how u make the most money off of available water. When they ""hold"" back or ""pass"" water like they do here in the states to maintain more stable water levels, they are literally flushing money down the drain. Here in the states the hydro companies are typically required to maintain water levels by the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc). Canada either doesn't have an equivalent or lac seul is exempt. As far as walleyes migrating all over lac seul, I guarantee it happens. What is debatable about it is how many yrs it takes and what percentage of the population does it. My money would be on a low percentage and several yrs."
4147129,pjshorthorn,2015-08-20 23:56:00,5654,That is pretty cool.
4181153,BenBeattie,2015-09-04 15:02:00,232,"FWIW - I believe the walleye on LS migrate more than you may suspect. For one, tagged fish from Pelican falls (SE Lac Seul) are caught throughout the system. Also, on the East end (NE and SE) there is a lot more current, and walleye return here to spawn. Fishing is the best on this part of the lake in May and June, then the bigger fish migrate west to the central basin. In the central basin (I guided there for 4 years before moving to the East end) they struggle early and then do really well after that. If I was booking a trip, I'd fish the east side early in the season and the center basin in the summer. I have a lot of respect for lodges that prohibit the possession of OVER SLOT walleye. SWWL, Williams Bay etc. It does make a difference. Lodges on the east side and especially house boaters should take a page from their book. As a guide I work hard to educate my guests about the negative impacts of harvesting over slot walleye. So basically it does come down to seasonal migrations where and when big fish are encountered the most and restricting over slot harvest has to have an impact too. That's my opinion, FWIW."
4141257,jimwalleye,2015-08-19 08:46:00,30,"I've been fishing 30 miles East of Hudson on a houseboat the last few years around the Taylor Island area to Bear Narrows and to Pine Point, and I've noticed that catching a walleye over 24 inches happens but not very common. On a typical year our group of ten pull a handful of 25+ fish from that area for the entire week. Many of our group will keep an OVER walleye. I will not. I had fished out of Fishermans Cove nearer to Ear Falls for many years and while fishing there it was not uncommon for our boat of two to catch 15 walleyes over 25 inches on a good day. It's my contention that because the camp owners near Fisherman Cove all have agreed that no OVERS are to be harvested it has increased the numbers of OVER fish to be caught in that area. It could take twenty years on Lac Seul for a walleye to grow to 25 inches, they grow slow in Canada much slower than their southern cousins. Think of all the boats on the East end of Lac Seul and all the OVERS that are taken, it only makes sense to me that less of them will be caught if they are not in the system anymore. With that said I have no idea how walleyes migrate on Lac Seul and if the East End walleyes migrate to the West or stay in that area. I know that the Silver Water Wagon Wheel Lodge posts many big fish but again that central area is not that accessible without a long boat ride. I was wondering if any of the rest of you think that makes sense and have had the same experience."
4141297,tv4fish,2015-08-19 08:54:00,2694,"Jim: I don't know if anyone has any ""proof"", but I don't believe the walleyes would travel that far.I would be happy for someone to prove that they do.Just another ""opinion"":Quote: Colby says that tagging studies indicate that most walleye populations move only a short distance. “Even in Lake Superior and Georgian Bay,” he says, “a majority of spawners move no farther than three miles from their spawning grounds. Presumably, a migration of similar magnitude is undertaken to return to the spawning grounds the following spring, since evidence now suggests that mature walleyes tend to return to the same spawning grounds year after year.”"
4141305,SinOrSwim,2015-08-19 08:56:00,1528,I have no idea but have been told by a couple guides they have no interest fishign walleye on the west side. Even though that is where we fish. Not sure why though?
4141345,Hump,2015-08-19 09:08:00,578,Have them all fish the East side. Make us west-siders happy and alone!!!
4141441,jimwalleye,2015-08-19 09:35:00,30,"I'm not talking about the far East end I'm talking about the McKenzie Bay area and the Bay of Islands. Do the East enders regularly catch 15-20 walleyes 25"" plus per day. On good days that was the norm out of Fisherman's Cove, at least during July. With that said, the only way you could buy a walleye in early spring was going into Broad Lake but there were some big ones, they just hadn't migrated to the big lake. Remember my point was if all the folks fishing on the East end keep the OVER fish there will be less of them. The resorts around Fisherman's Cove do not allow the OVERS which I think is a good thing. I remember fishing Lac Des Mille Lac as a kid going up with my Dad and friends for over 40 years, we were one of the first groups into Pine Point Resort. I'm not proud to say but for twenty years we always took home our limit of fish with up to ten guys and we keep only 3-4 pounders and up walleyes, and 8 pounds and up northerns. I noticed the decline of the fishery. It became harder and harder to catch big fish. The old MEAT HUNTER mentality was the wrong way to respect the fishery. Hence the slot limits. So do those folks fishing out of Fishermans Cove, Scout Lake Resort, Onaway Lodge near the Bay of Islands and McKenzie Bay area, catch more Bigger walleyes than the East end folks do?"
4141585,pjshorthorn,2015-08-19 10:10:00,5654,"In relative terms, I've fished a fairly small portion of the NE section of Lac Suel. Wapesi Bay, Chamberlain Narrows,Little Chamberlain,Scaler Lake, Kakebeka Narrows,Bear Narrows and many of the nooks and crannies in between.My experience in this portion of the lake has been quite satisfying over the years. I've landed a lot of 28""+ walleyes along with enough 30-40""+ northern to keep me happy. On average, I would catch 1-2 big walleye each trip myself over 28"" with a PB just a shade over 30"". The rest of our group would have similar luck.There are a number of large flowages coming into the SE/NE section of Lac Suel that eventually end up exiting at Ear Falls and the English River System. The Wapesi river from the WNW, the Root river from the north, the Vermilion river from the E and the English river from the S. All of these flowages have a large influence on the spawning and growth potential of walleye in this area of the lake system. Some of the rivers are sanctuaries during the spawn.The flowages all converge at the Taylor Island area and then head WNW to Ear Falls.I feel that it is not likely that walleye migrate 80 miles or more from one end of the lake system to the other end but the fishery is very healthy and, more than likely, a very large walleye will be caught in this part of the lake in the not to distant future.PjShorthorn."
4142025,dan cardinal,2015-08-19 13:33:00,64,"I have fished the NE East and the southwest section, and in relative terms still fished a very small section of the lake. But agree totally with your theory in regards to walleye migration on Lac Seul. There would be little, if any reason walleye would migrate that distance at this fishery. I do believe an abundant population of 25""+ walleye exist throughout the lake. I would also state my success ratio with 27"" and 28"" has been quite amazing in the middle section of the lake. We will be testing the west end in 2016."
4142209,SinOrSwim,2015-08-19 14:19:00,1528,"I leave ALL big fish in the lake. As a matter of fact I am so concerned about the resource, I don't even CATCH the big ones for fear I might hurt them."
4142265,bigwalleye1,2015-08-19 14:39:00,2632,"I find I do better in the ""less public"" spots. The ""nooks and crannies"" rather than the major humps that everybody knows about. That said, big fish primary migrate from east to west as they increase in size....."
4142377,SinOrSwim,2015-08-19 15:21:00,1528,"Is that true, or are you pulling my leg so I look silly pulling out this tidbit of information on our trip in a few weeks??? LOL"
