4174969,Baseline,2015-09-02 04:50:00,3207,"I 've used many resorts and campgrounds. Most of them have docks you choose when you arrive. Usually you launch and take one that's available and let the resort owner know. I have my own dock lines and keep them in the boat. I usually tie boat bumpers to the dock and leave my extension cords at the dock position. I've never had a problem with someone jumping in on my spot. Seems like people ""get it"" and find their own spot."
4177073,Aspencreek,2015-09-02 17:52:00,2911,"Where I usually go, the camp owner tells you what boat you are in (if using a camp boat) or where to park if you are bringing your own. And that is your spot for the week. When he is filling up the boats with gas in the morning he can be sure which boat goes with who. Gord, I'm sure that is why you run your camp docks that way, and it makes sence. If it's a free for all, I will bet the gas at weeks end is screwed up."
4177129,Bill Krejca,2015-09-02 18:36:00,6107,"In my opinion, one of the duties of the resort ""checker-inner"" is to lay out the dock rules and manage these rules. In a few places where I've gone, and there were none communicated, I've had some really interesting experiences, which I won't go into. It makes a lot of sense to just make assignments, then there should not be any conflict re: leaving buoys at the dock, etc. Bill"
4177385,v-bay gord,2015-09-02 20:22:00,3168,"Gas might be an issue in some bigger places, so because we're small knowing who got what isn't the issue. The issue is some boats are bigger than others and need the appropriate dock space...others like to park with the drivers side against the dock...people leave their extension cords where they dock....on and on. Once someone moves by mistake to the wrong dock it just creates a chain reaction where soon everyone is miffed. Run the dock with an iron fist and everyone is happy........ One of the reasons there should be someone on the dock to meet you............partly to greet you, but also to make sure you are in the right spot."
4177665,jabecker,2015-09-02 21:49:00,118,"When we go to Pine POint Resort at Lac Des Mille Lac we are assigned a dock for the week. When we go to Press Lake Resort we are also assigned a dock for the week. We Have never had a problem in over 40 years,"
4177681,Obabikon,2015-09-02 21:53:00,2370,"This can be an issue at our camp. We have a dock boy, and he does his best. Some people come in at different times. So, if he's cutting the grass, or getting the groceries... it can be an issue. VBay hit the nail on the head. The problem for us is that we have long docks, some boats are 6 feet longer than others. So, we can't just block off numbered parking spots. A 21 foot ranger will be leaking into someone else's spot. One goof up, makes it very difficult. We try to make sure everyone knows that's their spot, and to double check that they're in the correct one."
4177897,Ruddiger,2015-09-03 05:43:00,649,"Howdy, Well said, unfortunately not all camps are ran with the same efficiency you describe and not all dock boys are as hard working as their employer's believe. As a customer, it becomes very discouraging to see the same thing happen over and over again to other fisherman during the course of a week, particularly while the dock boys watch and do nothing. It really boils down to a lack of employee supervision by the owner. Of course, over time that results in a lack of customers to supervise for the reasons HRG so eloquently pointed out. Take care, Ruddiger"
4177961,GBS,2015-09-03 06:05:00,2271,"Our resort has a ""first come, first served, with veto"" policy. If you get there earlier on switch-over day (Saturday), you can pick your assigned dock space for the week. Subject to the owner's veto, if he knows there is a boat coming in later that will actually need it (size, etc.). From then on, it's ""park in your assigned spot"". The resort provides all basic dock lines and bumpers at each spot. The old owners had a generally similar policy, but would also pre-assign specific spots if a customer demanded before arriving. When it was sold, the new owners lost a long term customer because they would not accommodate the same demand - there was no reason he needed a particular spot, other than he wanted the convenience of driving straight in. So their response was - ""Get here earlier"". While not otherwise obnoxious, on the other hand, nobody misses him....."
4178009,MN_Moose,2015-09-03 06:26:00,964,Yes we experience similar challenges. Typically we ask the owner or dock boy where to park at beginning of the week. We put on our own bumpers and dock lines. The camp gets a lot of cabin owners and islanders. I'm sorry to generalize but to me it seems the cabin owners have an elitist attitude and have a bit of disrespect for other people's spots. The dock boy is very quick to move an offending boat and his tip at the end of the week reflects our appreciation.
4178145,LOW1,2015-09-03 07:30:00,2828,"I agree that simple and enforced rules go a long way. Posting those rules on the dock on a well made, stern but yet friendly sign also helps the folks who may not have been informed about the rules or who have forgotten that they have been informed about the rules.Also, crowding and other issues are helped by there being an adequate amount of well organized and maintained dock space. I have been at some places where dock construction and maintenance has not been a priority. The dock and how it is maintained is a big impression point for customers and potential customers."
4172625,fishingMN4eyes,2015-09-01 10:05:00,108,"Just curious what other fishermen out there practice as far as dock etiquette. If you see dock lines do you generally regard that as a spot that is likely occupied or off limits? Are there resorts that provide dock lines at each spot to their guests? I have never been to a camp like that and we have always provided our own dock lines, left them in the same spot on the dock when we go out for the day, and used those same spots throughout our whole trip.On several occasions we've had people come in a tie up using our dock lines. It frustrating coming in after a day of fishing and trying to figure out whose boats they are and trying to get them to move or switch out our lines. Has anyone else experienced this? We try to respect other peoples boats, equipment, and space so we found it pretty rude to come in and fins our dock spots occupied. Thoughts?"
4172825,Juls,2015-09-01 11:07:00,13414,"We always used the same spot for the entire week. The boats are provided for us at the fly in camp we go to. The dock lines are always attached to the boat. The dock has metal loops we hook the lines to with a carabiner (sp?) I don't think you are out of line to expect to have your spot available when you come back in. The other people using your spot, and dock lines, are out of line. Just my opinion of course...."
4172873,Hot Runr Guy,2015-09-01 11:16:00,16061,"This is one of the reasons I've changed resorts lately, and started using more of a private house type of rental, with it's own dock. The prior resort had adequate dockage, until 2 or 3 of the cabins (out of 5) would have guys bring multiple boats along. Got real tired of coming back after dark, and wondering if I was going to have a place to park. Of course, even at the current location, we come back from church on Sunday, to find a 2nd boat from next door tied-up at my dock. Absolutely amazing the lack of respect some guys show toward others. HRG"
4173097,Bakefish,2015-09-01 12:15:00,1077,"I went to a Canadian resort one year that had no dock protocol. This place seemed to have their stuff together except for docking. When I get to a lodge I tie my docking lines to the dock, set for my boat. Well this place was a virtual free for all, with no respect for previous docking positions. The closer you tied your lines, the more likely it was that someone would hijack your spot. I kept moving further away from the head of the dock until I was as far away as you could get. Apparently I found the solution because no one was interested in walking the additional 50 feet or so required for my spot. What truly amazed me was that that the hijackers had no problem using my lines which were obviously different from the ones supplied by the resort."
4173185,BRP,2015-09-01 12:30:00,77,"Maybe it's a regional thing, but here (North West Ontario), lines stay attached to the boat. If the camp assigns / reserves spots, they will tell you."
4173193,v-bay gord,2015-09-01 12:34:00,3168,I want boats (mine or yours) to use the same spot all week. Works great.......why do it any other way.??
4173233,Bakefish,2015-09-01 12:48:00,1077,"There is not much issue if there are plenty of cleats available, but it's been my experience to have to wrap my lines around the dock itself, which is a pain if you have to do it every time you come in."
4173337,Huntindave,2015-09-01 13:14:00,2194,"At the camp we go to on LOTW, we tie up ropes and fenders, bumpers, etc. on the first day we are there and use that spot all week. Our bumpers have our name on them and the ropes are clearly a set different from most of the rest of the ropes. Never had a problem that I've been aware of."
4173921,prov1800,2015-09-01 16:20:00,5010,Sounds to me the camp your staying at isnt very organized. Every camp j guide at has someone at the dock assign every one who brings there own boats to a specific spot for the week.or even the camp boatd all hace a specific spot.
4174729,Jesse-WI,2015-09-01 21:40:00,534,Never had this issue as we always have assigned spots.
