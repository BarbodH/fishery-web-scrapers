I'm not trying to get into a he said/she said fight, but I am Just curious if anyone has ever been ""asked to leave"" by a lodge operator and what rationale they offered, or seen somebody tossed out I'll leave this to the nmods to decide, and no hard feelings if they axe the thread. I'm just trying to see how willing a lodge operator might be to take a hit on a reservation to get rid of a customer he perceives as a problem"
4178785,Obabikon,2015-09-03 11:59:00,2370,"Personally, in 9 years, I've never had to ask someone to leave. I've actually had very few disagreements with guests. There are a small handful of groups/people that I removed from the mailing list. Simply because I was not interested in having them return. That is a very small percentage though. 99.9% of guests are great. They simply want to enjoy their trip."
4178825,outdoorsron,2015-09-03 12:22:00,843,"Hello: I stayed at a resort in Northwest Ontario that had a resort policy of no Walleye's to be kept over 18"". The owner caught one group continually breaking the policy after being educated about it the first time it happened. After 3 days of this and drinking and making a lot of noise at night he told them it was time to go. No one felt sorry for these arse#&^%s. Good Luck. O - R"
4178929,BornToFish,2015-09-03 12:55:00,1224,"I have some good friends that owned a fishing lodge in nw Ontario. I chatted with them from time to time about their guests. As Obabikon mentioned, 99.9% of guests are truly great people. But, from time to time, a problematic group would show up. My friends learned how to manage such groups to minimize their behavior in public. They basically isolated the groups from other guests. For example, not having a campfire at night would minimize the public drinking and rude behavior. Problematic guests might be told of a ""hot spot"" on the lake that nobody else was fishing. Their guides would keep distance from other boats. Dockhands would hurry them away from the dock. It didn't take other guests long to identify the problematic guests, simply by observing their behavior. Folks would simply avoid situations where they had anything to do with the problem guests. I managed a few problematic guests in this way. These guests would not have the greatest of vacations, and tended on their own to not re-book for the next year. At the end of a trying week, my lodge owner friends would ""win"" when they were paid and they watched the tail lights driving out the driveway. As Obabikon pointed out, such guests would not receive future mailings. The camp was always ""full up"" when they called to make another reservation. Taking this point a bit further, it didn't take my friends long to learn how to recognize problematic guests before they booked their first vacation. Problem guests often present themselves as problems at the booth at the All Canada Show or by the questions/comments they offer when they otherwise (e.g. phone calls or emails) contact the lodge owners. The key thing for me is that problematic guests are in the tiniest of minorities at the lodges that I stay at. Most of the guests at the lodges that I patronize are wonderful people. Many of these folks are now among my best of friends. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4179009,Kansas Bound,2015-09-03 13:23:00,152,I have never seen someone kicked out but I have seen one person told they were no longer welcome back due to his drinking problem.
4179329,SinOrSwim,2015-09-03 16:19:00,1528,"I just had a meeting with my finance guy the other day. Told him we were heading up next week. He said he had some friends who went up earlier this year and they were told they would not be welcome back. Not sure why or where yet. He was going to try and find out. And, knowing him, I can't imagine he is friends with a bunch of crazies."
4179641,law57,2015-09-03 19:40:00,1147,"The lake I go to has a reputation for big walleye. Many Canadian lakes do - but this lake is smaller than most other 'big fish' lakes. Before his death my dad and I boated 13 fish that were 30"" or over.In every cabin is a list of rules defined by the lodge. One of them is no fish over 18"" should be kept for eating - including 'take home fish'. No problem - there are plenty of 'eaters'. The second rule is only one fish GT/EQ 28"" per guest. The care taker explains the rules to all guests - new and returning. He tells them they are likely to catch a bigger walleye than they ever imagined. But that if they keep one, they can't keep another. Time after time a guest will come in with a bigger fish than they 'froze' the day before. What's the lodge to do?Generally they let it slide as they need the business. But one guy really pushed it - they asked him to leave and he got belligerent. The lodge called the RMCP and they escorted him all the way back tot he border.It's a tough call - but the lake and resource comes first. Then the resort and owner, then the guest. This day, any fisherman who doesn't release a big walleye should be banned for fishing for life."
4179673,Richard B,2015-09-03 19:48:00,735,"I have been kicked out of a Canadian resort! It was 36 years ago and 3 of my buddies and I where on our first group vacation. We went to a lake with only one resort on it and they only had 6 horse motors. Saturday was fine and caught a lot of fish. Sunday we got about 1/4 mile from the resort and one of the engines started smoking badly. We shut it down as quickly as possible and the other boat towed us in. The resort owner put another motor on and away we went. Monday was fine but Tuesday we where leaving camp and the ""newer"" outboard started slowing down. We turned around and the resort owner said some very inappropriate words to us but put a different motor on the boat. Wednesday we left the resort, went about 100 yards and the ""older"" motor started smoking and just locked up. We went back for the 3rd time and the owner yelled, screamed, cussed, and told us to get the *@$^ out. When we ask why he said we had torn up 3 motors and he was not going to let us take any more out. We argued with him and he walked into the resort and came walking back out about 10 minutes later. We stood there and talked to him for 1/2 before the police got there and assisted us in packing and leaving. We where forced to pay him for the entire week of the trip even though we left with 2 1/2 to 3 days left. Now mind you we did nothing to the motors. The resort owner filled the tanks with premix so I don't know what was going on with them and he never mentioned the problem but 3 motors in 4 1/2 days is a little crazy. The 4 of us still go up to Canada fishing once a year and we laugh everytime we think about that first trip. BTW we have been bringing our own boats ever since and have never had an issue."
4179833,Aspencreek,2015-09-03 21:18:00,2911,"This is familiar....I'm pretty sure I was at that camp that week too, or at least witnessed the same thing. When these guys came off the water, they had obviously been drinking (all day), had a cooler full of fish some well over the slot and in, with no regard for anything except themselves. Loud, obnoxious, language that would make a sailor blush, and trying to jig for the ""pet walleyes"" under the dock. It was actually fun to watch these guys load up their vehicles while hung over at 7am to 8am. When the camp owner found a lot of beer bottles on the dock and a fishing pole on the dock with a dead walleye still on the line, that was the final straw. He walked into the cabin and started banging pots together to wake up the group, then told them they were out and had until 8 before he called the police. Hope they had a nice drive home!"
4181081,LOW1,2015-09-04 14:36:00,2828,I had a lot of hope for this thread but it has been a fizzle. Surely my fellow Ugly Americans have done worse than (allegedly) stealing a towel?
4180921,schoolofhardknocks,2015-09-04 13:12:00,29,"Some years ago my buddies and I came off of a Rusty Myers fly-in and for a price one could use a near-by motel and take a shower before going home. After I got home I got a long typed letter accusing me of taking a towel (1 towel). First of all we didn't take a towel and secondly, would you jeopardize thousands of dollars of repeat business for a towel? We never returned. I guess they have new owners now."
