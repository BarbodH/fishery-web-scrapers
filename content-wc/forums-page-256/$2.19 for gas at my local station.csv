4183673,last chance,2015-09-06 05:47:00,3262,well I don't really understand whats going on but it just dropped from 2.35 to 2.24 here. now the first time I drive my truck im going to fill er up.
4178265,kzoofisher,2015-09-03 08:40:00,5144,Can't believe it won't go up before the weekend. That price would have saved me close to $20 on my last trip to Canada. Almost 2%! With a savings like that my wife might let me go twice.
4178777,Slab Seeker,2015-09-03 11:55:00,14,$2.33 here in Des Moines. With all the presidential candidates running around the state we should develop an engine to run on methane to capitalize on this @#$% that's produced.....
4178849,oleJoe,2015-09-03 12:24:00,114,$2.05 in Ohio of course the price of corn in Nepal might go up so it won't stay down for long
4180001,fishinnut 3446,2015-09-04 05:13:00,638,Lucky guy's ! Up around here in Wi. anywhere from $2.45-$2.54But going down slowly
4180113,last chance,2015-09-04 06:34:00,3262,"it was 2.27 here in Muncie Indiana yesterday. it was 2.25 here before the jump to 2.99. I seen it for 2.25 and thought I should fill my truck but decided to wait until the next day. that night it jumped to 2.99 and I still haven't filled my truck, LOL. but as soon as it gets down to 2.25 or below I plan to fill er up. I did put 20.00 in it and only used it when I had no choice. it has about 1/8 of a tank right now. so I only have to let it set for a couple more days as prices have been going down. the refinery in northern Indiana went down and gas prices jumped .74 cents a gallon here. they got the refinery back on line and its taking a month for prices to drop .74 cents a gallon. pure and simple price gouging in my book."
4180129,GBS,2015-09-04 06:43:00,2271,"The local Costco dropped it from $2.20 to $2.14 while I was in the store yesterday. Too bad I filled up my 34 gal tank there the day before at $2.22! Odd that premium stayed up at $2.74 (I usually switch up when towing for the 10% better mpg, but with that price spread, it doesn't make sense)"

4181473,bfish,2015-09-04 18:13:00,1096,"E10 was $1.88 this morning and I expect it to go up for the weekend. 100% gas was $2.21, and diesel was $2.19. I filled all three vehicles."
4183489,hommer23,2015-09-05 21:10:00,523,"Filled up at Sam's today in S. Lansing for $2.39, When I drove by at 4:00 it was $2.40 and at 4:45 it was $2.39 so I thought I got a great deal saving $0.19 on the fill up"
