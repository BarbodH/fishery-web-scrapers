4183481,Flip Silverlake,2015-09-05 21:03:00,645,"First out I don't buy a 8 day license, if I did I wouldn't have anything to do for the remaining 11 weeks I spend on LOTW. What I MENT to say was that if you keep fish you caught you can only keep 2 per day if you are a non- Canadian. One of which can be over 18.1 inches. If you place those 2 fish in your freezer and fish the next day you can catch and keep 2 more fish which will then give you a total of 4 fish. If you caught 1 fish over 18.1 inches on day one you are not allowed to keep another if that fish is still in your possision. Now if your a Ontario resident you can catch and keep 4 in one day of which one can be over 18.1inches, that's the same for a Canadian non resident of Ontario. The assumption was that the numbers of fish I was talking about were ""kept fish"". Believe me I know what the regs are due to the fact I have a significant investment on that lake. The license I buy is the Non resident non Canadian Seasonal. You might want to advise your guests on catching their two Walleye and having a shore lunch. They might be surprised to find out that those two are the limit for the day. I've watched a CO hang out 2 guys for catching 2 and eating them and then went back fishing. When they hung a couple of more Walleyes on the stringer the CO pulled out his ticket book. I KNOW THE RULES and follow them to the letter."
4183577,Obabikon,2015-09-06 01:11:00,2370,"I'm well aware of this law, and always advise my guests. You can read some of my venting about this in another thread. Its simply because of remote border crossings (RBC's). But... apparently that seems anti-american lol"
4186065,Flip Silverlake,2015-09-07 11:34:00,645,It's been a tradition for years with fishermen taking a break and having a couple of great tasting fresh Walleye for lunch. Unfortunately I think that this activity wasn't taken into account when the MNR passed some of rules they did. The Minnesota legislation passed a law on invasive species that required anyone driving through the state to take a course and buy a sticker even if you weren't going to put your boat in to any Minnesota waters. There was a ton of push back and they changed it. My biggest complaint is the unregulated netting of fish by the native population. That's way out of hand.
4187305,SinOrSwim,2015-09-08 06:10:00,1528,"Is the 2 per day, 4 total the same on Lac Seul? I think I'm reading this right and it is only the border waters but want to make sure. I have a conservation license so it really doesn't matter but others in the group will need to know this."
4187385,bigwalleye1,2015-09-08 06:27:00,2632,"As far as I know, Sin, on LS, it's 4 in possession all the time, total, in the deadwell, in the freezer, or inside you. I've never heard on 2 per day, 4 in possession there."
4187457,SinOrSwim,2015-09-08 06:45:00,1528,That was my understanding as well and I was pretty sure that was how I was reading the posts on here but wanted to make sure. thanks
4181209,Obabikon,2015-09-04 15:33:00,2370,Four total... two per day.
4181249,v-bay gord,2015-09-04 15:45:00,3168,"I believe there is a relationship between the size of the ""segments"" (not sure the biological term but they might be analogous to tree rings) in a fillet and the length of the fish in question.......so....no mater how bad you fillet it or how you try and disguise it if they want to pursue the case with some lab work I think it is possible to prove the length."
4182601,Bigfishhunter,2015-09-05 11:20:00,803,What? Staff don't ever fish? They would have to consider that too.
4182681,Flip Silverlake,2015-09-05 12:48:00,645,Conservation license gives you only 2 in possession. Seasonal non-Canadain is 4 after 2 days. Seasonal Canadian gives you 4.
4182713,Obabikon,2015-09-05 13:00:00,2370,"I wish that were true for all areas. However, it is not. Border waters are 2 per day 4 total."
4182937,Flip Silverlake,2015-09-05 16:09:00,645,LOTW for a non-Canadain is 2 per day 4 possession after 2 days. This is a seasonal license. Canadians can take 4 per day with a possession limit of 4. Conservation license limits you to 2 per day and 2 possession. I only fish LOTW and can't speak to non-border lakes.
4183249,Obabikon,2015-09-05 19:01:00,2370,"Flip,For non residents... Seasonal and 8 day licenses are exactly the same. There are seasonal conservation licenses and seasonal sport licenses. As there are also 8 days sport and 8 day con.Sport license - 2 per day and 4 total possessionConservation license - 2 per day and 2 total possession"
4183273,Obabikon,2015-09-05 19:09:00,2370,"2 per day 4 TOTAL possession (so max of 4). That isn't what you said to begin with... you said that the limit is four after two days. But, that is NOT true. If on day 1 you keep zero walleye... you can NOT keep 4 on day two. it is TWO PER DAY... FOUR TOTAL POSSESSION. There is not any wiggle room, or anything to argue about. The seasonal or 8 day fishing licenses for non resident are exactly what I've said. Anything else will result in a fine if caught."
4183321,fishron,2015-09-05 19:40:00,317,"Do you remember the year Ontario instituted the regulation that the whole fish had to be intact, after the guts were removed. It was a number of years ago. We only fished eastern Ontario at that time and we had our limits of take home fish in our possession. It was the only time I have ever been checked by the wardens and it happened as we were heading home, towing our boats toward the Thousand Island bridge. It was a lady warden who pulled us over and I believe she was taken quite aback when she checked our catch. The son of the owner of the lodge we stayed at was the most skillful fish cleaner I have ever seen. He had gutted and preserved the rest of the walleye, intact, and all that had to be done was a small snip to release the fillet. God bless him for his expertise. The prior year must have been a tough one for license scofflaws."
4183465,Bill Krejca,2015-09-05 20:57:00,6107,"In the 1940's, Dad brought the LOW fish home intact, no removal of gills, guts, or anything else. I also remember us at home receiving boxes of whole iced commercial fish as a Christmas present. They also were required to be whole. The large pike Dad brought home at that time had the darndest slimy smell that can be imagined. I still remember them being removed for show from his converted trunk ice box with the slime literally oozing out, stretching from one fish to the next. The limit at that time was 16 pike, 16 ""walleyed pike"". Bill"
4180257,rnnonmt,2015-09-04 08:02:00,992,"All of the recent posts regarding fish limits, fishing etiquette reminded me of something I heard on a recent trip. During this years trip to Lac Seul I had heard a couple guys talking in the fish cleaning house... I know, I know, this is where all the stories come from, but they were talking about how an MNR officer would frequent a certain camps fish cleaning house and go through the buckets of fish remains pulling out the carcasses and sometimes measuring them to see if there were any illegal size fish. Couple questions: 1) why would they do this? 2) if they did find an illegal size fish can someone be held responsible for it? Is it the camp owner that can be held responsible? 3) or worse, what if you happened to be cleaning your fish at the time they found an illegal size filleted fish in the fish house bucket? I know the fish have to be in your possession to for you to be held responsible for taking an illegal fish but who's possession is it in when the MNR officer pulls it out of a fish house bucket?"
4180289,v-bay gord,2015-09-04 08:22:00,3168,"Illegal sized carcasses in the bucket probably means there are corresponding illegal sized fillets in someone's freezer or cabin. It also means, if this occurs often at a particular resort that there is a lack of control by the lodge over their guest's fishing activities......which would probably result in more scrutiny by the MNR."
4180313,tv4fish,2015-09-04 08:39:00,2694,"EXACTLY --- And I do know for a fact that (at least years ago when the MNR had more money) the officers WOULD go into resort cabins and go through the freezers/refrigs. to check the size of the fillets. And, NOOOO - it wasn't my group It's just that we happen to know some of the CO's."
4180361,LOW1,2015-09-04 09:14:00,2828,"I think that this is one of those areas where officers apply common sense rather than a strict letter of the law. If there is a communal gut bucket and a communal freezer technically the owner of these facilities could be considered in possession and control of what is in these facilities. The same could be said for the users.My sense and experience is that MNR officers understand and want to promote and preserve fishing as well as the tradition of lodges, so they exercise their discretion and don't push this issue. But, as been said, if they see oversize carcasses they certainly will (and should) try to find the people responsible.Now whether finding oversized carcasses in the communal gut bucket is without more enough to justify a nonconsensual mass search of separate cabins is a different question.In the states, I doubt it. In Canada?"
4180401,tv4fish,2015-09-04 09:41:00,2694,"I think that in most resort's ""communal freezer"" -- most guys mark or label whatever they have their fillets in (baggies or ?) with their cabin No. or name so they don't mistakenly get ""taken"" by someone else."
4180449,SinOrSwim,2015-09-04 09:52:00,1528,"Is it even possible to get in trouble with a filet though? Your fish cleanign abilities can impact how big a filet is off a given fish. If there are a lot of fish guts and guests, it would be impossible to prove the length issue. Over your limit sure."
4180465,Obabikon,2015-09-04 09:54:00,2370,"They're also counting fish. On lake of the woods, if I have 20 guests... but there's 48 walleyes in the buckets, someone went over the limit. (since there's only 2 per person per day) I've never had an issue with my buckets, but there's always potential."
4180497,bigwalleye1,2015-09-04 09:57:00,2632,"The CO's may also use the finding of these oversize fish as a reason for extra patrols, more time spent in a particular resort, showing up unannounced, etc. There was one year they popped into camp 3 times during the week. That much time tells me it was more than a social call...."
4180537,Guest,2015-09-04 10:16:00,0,"MNR officers need no reason to search your cabin, boat, car, etc. They can and do impromptu searches all the time. Sometimes, after checking the number of fish in your boat out on the water, they will go to your cabin and check there."
4181169,Mark R,2015-09-04 15:18:00,1538,Only two walleye per day? What is the possession limit?
