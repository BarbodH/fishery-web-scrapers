1452206,cuamb,2012-06-21 10:54:00,203,A little late with this but we were on NE Lac Suel 9th through 16th and hatch was going strong. We did really well in shallow water. Found that the one time I put down anchor in the mud they were really active. It was really windy and I am not sure if the anchor stirring the mud had anything to do with it but it was sure fun. Had a 25 inch and 27 inch while sitting there. Also numerous ones around 20 inches.
1448545,jimmie,2012-06-12 20:00:00,123,"Mayflies can be tricky and seem to turn the fish off but fish still eat. Target the trails of the masses of mayflies and often under those trails and you should still have a fair amount of good luck. I had the same experience a few years back on the East end area from deception to Sen Bay and after trying the trails of skelitons I started catching fish again. I won't promise anything but it worked for me and this wouldmhave been in the first of July that year. They seem to hatch at different times and sometime even in more than one batch. Typical here in Minnesota the hatch is 10/14 days each year but at different times each year. Don't know what triggers the hatch. Please let us know how your luck was and if there was evidence of a hatch where you fished. Thanks, Jimmie"
1448554,Glenman12,2012-06-12 20:31:00,762,emailed our resort owner on Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls and he said no signs of the mayflys there yet..
1448565,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-12 20:45:00,235,"The one year we hit mayflies in Canada we found the fishing slow at first, but then figured out that all the fish were in very shallow water near wind blown points and rock piles. We got into some furious action after that. In the morning, when it was calm, you could hear and see walleyes taking flies off the surface - could've nailed 'em on a fly rod if you wanted to."
1448577,wallydave,2012-06-12 21:16:00,2151,"Ive seen the food chain at work before, will pike come into the flats looking for food with the walleyes?"
1448603,BennieS,2012-06-12 22:48:00,108,"Haven't fished in thirty years. Was on Ord Lake last Friday up near Perrault Falls and my son and I motored into a bay that was covered with mayflies. We could see the fish surface feeding everywhere but could not get them to bite. Reluctant to leave all those feeding fish behind I tried one last thing. Rigged a 1/16 oz jig with a small twister tail and began casting, and catching fish. It was immediately obvious that if they didn't hit it on the forst drop they weren't going to hit it at all. If they didn't hit on the first drop we ripped the presentation back in and tried again. We caught a ton of walleyes although I will admit they were all in the 13-15"" range. It was still a blast. If a similiar post appears I apologize as I just put one together amoment ago and feel like I ""lost it""."
1448628,campchick,2012-06-13 05:37:00,96,"Yes, some mayfly species is hatching and the fish are full of them. It is not the bigger mayfly though. This one is smaller and not as prolific. The bigger mayfly should be starting any day now though. As others have stated it is not that much of a concern and usually only lasts a few days. We don't get the huge mayfly hatches like they have on Lake Winnipeg where the shoreline has piles of them. On a side note, bears just love to eat these piles of mayflies. Must be a lot of protein there."
1448655,Guest,2012-06-13 06:52:00,0,"I have somewhere a research paper that a guy did on walleye, feeding patterns and when mayfly thing is in full bloom, it is 95% of what walleye eat, and if they are eating, you can catch them, look for swallow mud flats near by and fish shallows, you will be rewarded."
1448659,v-bay gord,2012-06-13 06:59:00,3168,I've had success using jigs that try and replicate a mayfly....such as these...
1449895,Manitou,2012-06-15 21:36:00,125,Leeches are a great bait to use during the mayfly hatch.
1450778,Mojo-NC,2012-06-18 14:28:00,1929,The mayfly hatch was in full swing beginning last Wednesday in the Ear Falls area. Our boat was full of rainwater and mayflies on Thursday AM when we came out to fish. We still caught plenty of fish on spinner rigs and jigs. The guides at the baitshop were trying to match the hatch using black jig heads and dark brown pumpkinseed twister tails. They worked well. Good luck!
1444587,jiggster,2012-06-04 10:19:00,183,Has the Mayflies started in the Ear falls area?
1444631,TIGHTLINER,2012-06-04 11:57:00,223,Just got back from nakina area last weekend and we had 5 full days of temps of 44 wind rain sleet and heavy snow in camp. However the mayflies had started already there.
1448338,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-12 12:49:00,298,Any reports?
1448342,teddi,2012-06-12 12:59:00,349,yes they are in full swing. started last weekend.
1448372,wallydave,2012-06-12 13:35:00,2151,"Teddie, how long does the hatch last. We haven't had ours yet in Cen. Il. We hit Goose Bay this Saturday. How will the post hatch bite be? ?"
1448462,teddi,2012-06-12 15:59:00,349,it lasts about 10 days depends on the weather. it takes a week or two after for the bite to pick up. fishing was tough last weekend because of the hatch and the poor weather. say hello to andrea for me.
1448518,v-bay gord,2012-06-12 18:56:00,3168,Mayfly hatchs can produce some of the best bites of the season....don't psych yourself out! Target the mudflats and bays where there is mayfly activity. Mid-day is often productive. Try trolling crankbaits in these areas......any cabbage weeds? ...try ripping some husky jerks through them to trigger fish. Jigs with a piece of crawler can work well. Good luck.
1448531,wallydave,2012-06-12 19:42:00,2151,"Teddie and Gordon thanks for the replies! I'm guessing there are usually two schools of thought on things like the mayflies. Yea there have plenty to eat, but they are actively feeding too! In just a few days we will know for sure!!"
1448536,CSH Kucinski,2012-06-12 19:50:00,1340,Spent last week in Cochrane and the mayflies were out in full force! The fish were biting too!
1448538,eyeman_1,2012-06-12 19:51:00,690,"I have found that the hatch is usually pretty good fishing for our group, nothing to be intimidated by. We tend to troll bouncers and spinners then with copper or gold blades and the fish seem in a frenzy if you can troll that rock to mud transition.... sometimes it's chaotic the number of fish you catch. Plan to try some slow death rigs this year... will up to LOTW in two weeks. Good luck."
