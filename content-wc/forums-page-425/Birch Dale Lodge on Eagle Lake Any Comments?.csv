I have a 15 year old daughter and ALL of our fish will be CPR.Also,I bought a handful of jigs,my wife bought me a handful of jigsand my daughter bought me a handful of jigs.I have a jigs coming out of my ears and I'll leave Captain Redbeard jigs with Cheryl for posters to use.THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Strawberry Island which is with in site of the pier can be productive. We have caught small pike and nice smallies right from the pier from time to time. Once you see the lake every place looks like great fishing, you are doing right getting a guide your 1st trip. Hope you have a great trip, I know Cheryl and Marcel will take great care of you. Don't just stick to jigs, some times you may hit a walleye or smallie bite on crank baits, usually fishing a weed edge. Cotton Cordell Grappler Shad in Black and Silver has been one of my most productive baits and you can get them at Walmart for like 4 bucks, don't know why this one works as I have hundreds of different crank baits but on Eagle it has always been lucky for me. Feel free to PM me if you want more help or spots to fish.Good LuckDanbear"

The guide will put you on some great spots, make sure you mark your map or GPS so you can find them again. Have a great time. Cheryl and Marcel will take great care of you. Terry"
1451936,jimmie,2012-06-20 19:55:00,123,I have stayed at BD over the years. My kids played with erines kids in the 70's. When I returned there in the 90's for a visit I noticed that the boy was running things ( a bit downhill) and Ernie was in the kitchen for great dinners. I went back the following year to great dissapointment as the same burned out lights were still burned out. The same plastic shopping bag that I had to put between the storms to keep ot thee skeeteras was still there. I have not gone back! However it would seem that there are new operators. I love Eagle and would stay there again if the reports turned out to be favorable for the updated reports. Thanks all. I hope that you have a better experience than I had over a dozen years ago. Nice folks in the day but . . . .
