1451609,Mike Borger,2012-06-20 07:52:00,1554,"We flew into Dusey lake north of Nakina Jun 2-9 with 7 Lakes Wilderness Camps.Dusey lake is actually a large widening of the Dusey river and there was a ton of water to fish and explore both upstream and down from the lake, as well as the lake itself which is quite substantial.Water was several feet higher than normal which made things difficult, but we adapted. On the plus side we hit the weather lottery that week, with beautiful warm sunny days the entire time. Didn't put on the rainsuit once which might be a first.Fishing wise it far exceeded expectations. What makes this camp so different is the river in both directions is teeming with beautiful wild brook trout.We caught scads and scads of them, some quite large.The delta where the Dusey flows in the lake was an unbelievable walleye hot spot and was within a stones throw of camp.Double, triple and quadruple headers were common. It was super fun for my 5 year old, but actually got kind of boring for the rest of us after an hour or so.I didn't fish much for pike, the trout and walleye were too tempting. But I did put in a good solid half day. Raised one mid 40's brute that wouldn't commit, then got one skinny 42""er later in the morning.Parts of the Dusey river and Dusey lake are very much like the Attawapiskat. There's just countless back bays and sloughs adjacent to deep water that just scream pike.I'm pretty sure if one was to concentrate on them the results would be amazing.The camp has been recently renovated and was very comfortable. Newer mattresses on the bunks and amazingly a Bosch on demand propane water heater were both a huge bonus. If you felt the need for a 15 minute hot shower you had the option. Honestly though it was really great.Boats are 16' Nadens with 2 stroke Yamaha 9.9's. The boats didn't leak, had comfy swivel seats and the motors ran great. No issues there at all.Overall I can highly recommend it. Personally I can't wait to go back and fish the river under normal water levels. I believe it would be even better, and it was pretty darned good 6' higher than normal.If anyone wants to see the complete trip report with photos and video clips check out this link:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=63633Cheers, Mike"
1451661,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-20 09:39:00,1460,Really nice report and great adventure had by all. I bet Brad had a helluva time fishing with your group. The day trip up the Balson Creek looked like a blast. I was is Wabakimi at the same time and the weather was great if not a bit warm. Way to go Mike. Brendan will never forget this trip.
1451667,Mike Borger,2012-06-20 09:51:00,1554,"Thank you sir. And you're right, if anything the weather was maybe too warm, but you'll never hear me complain about that.Didn't get this on film unfortunately, but I handed my rod to Brendan when I had the 42"" pike solidly hooked. I thought he was going to pee his pants LOL! Equal parts excitement and fear.For a lad of only 5 he's catching on pretty quick though I must say.I feel very blessed.It'll be my daughters turn in a couple of weeks, looking forward to that.Cheers"
1451804,adempsey,2012-06-20 14:41:00,963,"Great report as usual! I am not that familiar with Brook trout fishing (trying to change that), but I'd assume that the ideal fishing times are Spring and Fall? How challenging is it in the summer on a river like that? I always meant to try it on one of my trips but have never made it out. Perhaps this upcoming trip, assuming the Foch or Obakamiga holds brookies ."
1451845,Mike Borger,2012-06-20 16:33:00,1554,"Spring and fall is best for sure, but summer can be good too.The fish are generally much more highly concentrated in the summer being found in only the most violent rapids and in spring holes."
1451884,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-20 18:02:00,235,This sounds like an amazing outpost...putting it on my bucket list.
1451971,BuckeyeBill,2012-06-20 20:46:00,76,"Excellent report and pics, Mike. Really enjoyed. Those trout bring back a great memory for me. I was on my first trip to Canada, back in the late 70's. It was a fly-in trip with Luenbergers out of Nakina and we were on Percy Lake. About mid week a plan comes in with a guide and client who are heading down the river for ""speckled trout"". By afternoon the wind was blowing so hard we had to beach the boats. Just before dark these guys make it back to the camp and I got my first look at these beautiful fish. They opened up the cooler and I just could not believe how beautiful these fish were. That picture has forever been etched in my mind. A few years later on another fly-in I did manage to catch 6 speckles, not near the size that you guys had but I was tickled pink!! Oh yea, the guide and client had to spend the night with us. I love the north and will go as long as this body holds out!! Leaving this friday and heading to a great smallmouth lake just east of Saulte Ste Marie."
