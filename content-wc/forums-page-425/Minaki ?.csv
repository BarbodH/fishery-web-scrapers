1451775,walleyebubba,2012-06-20 13:39:00,20,I fish there a couple of times a year and if you want good walleye fish to the just to the north of Myrtle rapids. cross over the fast current about 75-150 from the rapids using a heavy bottom bouncer. make sure you have a card for the area for your gps as it can be confusing up there. good luck.

1452021,Campcountry,2012-06-21 05:01:00,164,"I was just fishing the area and we found walleye in 3 FOW water all the way down to 45 FOW. Used bottom bouncers for the the transition areas, points, and humps. We also saw quite a few groups jigging mostly around 20 to 25 FOW. Our favorite depth for bouncing ended up being 35 to 45 FOW.
