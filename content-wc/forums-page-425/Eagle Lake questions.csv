1451826,wishow,2012-06-20 15:53:00,19,"I just got off the phone with Casey at Bear Trail lodge. They were out of power for 40 days. They made a deal with Birchdale lodge and moved as many customers as they could over there. Any customers that could not be moved received their deposits back. That was the reason for the sale, to refund all the money.He assured me that we will not only be taken care of, but the cabin at Birchdale will be an upgrade from the one we would have had. He also said that he wanted to come on here and clear things up but can't get approved to post? Not sure what that's about, that's none of my concern.Bottom line is if you have reservations with Bear Trail lodge you will be accommodated.Note: Nobody was preventing him from coming here and posting. He never activated his account with the automatic email that is sent when a person registers. He emailed me and I manually activated his account and he can post to his hearts desire and he did post in another thread about this same subject."

1451982,jimmie,2012-06-20 21:07:00,123,You will love Eagle Lake. Ansy Myers camp too. I read good reports about Birch Dale just a feww minutes ago. Ther'sSDportman Ladge as well. You will not be far from Musky territory or smallie water at all Just accross the V. Bay going south and there is a flat rock stucture where they sun. Some large Pike there too at times. The entire area especially at bay openings can be patrolled by musky. Eyes are where you find them as the new Ontario Regulation and the stopping of the fishing tournament and night fishing have helped immensely. Ask any resort owner about the fishing. Also stop by Bobby's and get info and any fishing supplies including license. Have fun and be sure to let us all know how your adventure turned out.
1451604,wishow,2012-06-20 07:44:00,19,"Wow, I'm glad I found this. I am going to Bear Trail July 7th. They have not responded to emails earlier this month. I just called them and left a message. I'll post when I hear something."
1451652,Mike Kansas,2012-06-20 09:20:00,1463,"Hope this works out for the group. Hate to see guys trips get messed up.Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1451659,5richards,2012-06-20 09:35:00,131,Kudo's to V-Bay Gord Here's hoping all those that have reserved with this Lodge can at least salvage their trip with another outfitter. This stinks!
1451675,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-20 10:04:00,235,"I hope people can recover their deposits. The good news is that there are lots of other options in NW Ontario, most of them with very reputable owners. I'm sure some outfitters would work out a special deal for you if you explain your situation - you are ""found money"" for them on this last minute notice and they want your repeat business."
1451718,Guest,2012-06-20 11:17:00,0,<<<<said 2 resorts on Eagle were closing>>>> Does any one know what the other camp is that's closing?
1451747,v-bay gord,2012-06-20 12:13:00,3168,I don't know of another.....perhaps Danbear can elaborate on the rumour.
1451810,Golden,2012-06-20 14:59:00,2172,"v-bay gord.....you are really stirring the pot here and I'm not sure of your intent but I have been emailing back and forth with the owner of Bear Trail Lodge for over an hour now.They are in business according to him....they have never been out of business.I'm not sure why this rumor was started but from what I can see you are the one that started it.....and I'm guessing he is one of your competitors.Please refer to this post for more information and PLEASE refrain from starting unsubstantiated rumors about your competitors....all it does is cause me headaches that I don't need.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...08#post1451808If you have proof of the allegations, please post it.I have given Wishow the contact information that I was given for Bear Trail Lodge and asked him to contact them and post his findings in the thread that he started.Either they are open for business or they are not.......so let's find out."
1451812,v-bay gord,2012-06-20 15:13:00,3168,"This is what I said and I stand behind it: ""-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Del.....just a heads up on Bear Trail Lodge. I would pm you but I think others who have booked there need to be aware that the lodge has had their power cut off and many things needed to run a lodge have been sold off in the last few weeks.....this includes boats, motors, docks. I would suggest you contact them asap to see what the arrangements are re: your booking. If they haven't contacted you it tells me that all is not well. "" I did not say they are out of business. I suggested that the poster contact them to find out what is going on. I have no motive other than I think folks have the right to be aware of possible issues affecting their trip."
1451819,NWwalleye,2012-06-20 15:32:00,223,"Why did they advertise their sale as a"" MOVING SALE "" ???????????Added by GoldenHey....let's stop stirring the pot until we get more information OK!"

1451375,del-yakker,2012-06-19 16:27:00,6,"Hello all, newbie here. I'm headed to Eagle Lake in mid july for the first time, and will be staying at Bear Trail Lodge on Waldohf Bay. I am looking for whatever anyone will share. Plan to fish 'eyes, pike, muskie, and smallies. Have fished LOW/ NW Angle area and Lac Seul many times, so very excited to try another legendary lake. What lures for Muskie do you recommend, thinking brown suicks and bull dawgs, others? anyone willing to give up a favorite spot or two nearby? Thanks in advance."

1451410,del-yakker,2012-06-19 18:06:00,6,"V-Gord~thanks for the heads up, going to be doing some very quick checking. I really appreciate the note. Probably going to look into a fall back lodge. suggestions?"
1451415,Larry S,2012-06-19 18:12:00,665,Del-Yakker For you info V-Bay Gordy Owns and operates Vermillion Bay Lodge very near to where you have planned to go on Eagle Lake Give him a call
1451416,v-bay gord,2012-06-19 18:19:00,3168,"Seems inappropriate to insert myself into the discussion of alternatives, but so be it. I would also recommend Cedar Point Lodge, or Birchdale Lodge. I hesitated even responding to the post but I think it would be negligent to not let someone know what's going on."
1451418,del-yakker,2012-06-19 18:20:00,6,"I saw that after I checked the bio, thanks!"
1451425,Larry S,2012-06-19 18:30:00,665,"V-Bay your a good guy for telling it like it is,and it was me who told yak that you have a lodge on Eagle. So no inappropriateness on your part. Larry S"
1451426,Blue Lk,2012-06-19 18:31:00,269,"Gord,you are a Class Act!Well Done!"
1451451,Danbear,2012-06-19 19:19:00,72,"I talked to Cheryl at Birch Dale last week and she said 2 resorts on Eagle were closing and they were filling up fast. I go to Birch Dale every year and love it. One of my employees has been going to Vermillion Bay for years and he loves it there. They would be my first choices. As far as Muskie baits go my buddy likes throwing Double Cow Girls, Copper blades and black tail worked for him last year, I like throwing swim baits. Try the rock reef at the entrance to Clearwater creek, the reef isn't marked so be careful, always seems to be a musky hanging around there, we get follows there every year but they seem smarter than us as we haven't got the hooks in one yet. The weeds there are also good for Pike, alot of smaller ones, but always action and once in a while a nice one. In July I would fish a little deeper any submerged reefs or sharp points that drop off to 20 ft, there are many. Good Luck."
1451579,tv4fish,2012-06-20 07:00:00,2694,"I agree - that's the kind of info. that is important to provide, especially for a newbie going to a camp that he knows nothing about."
