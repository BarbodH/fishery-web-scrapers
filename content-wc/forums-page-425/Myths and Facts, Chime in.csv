1452577,bassface44,2012-06-22 07:53:00,96,"""the lightest jig possible"" is a nice rule of thumb to keep in the back of your head but it isn't always the best solution. For the time my group is in Canada, the first or second week of July, I seem to have better overall success using heavier jigs (3/8 oz) than I do with lighter ones. I am pretty aggressive with the jigging and I like the faster fall rate when water temps are up and fish are a little more active. In this case I am looking for a reaction more than an I am a feeding response. That being said if the bite slows downsizing is always an option. I do prefer lighter jigs if I am pitching shallow though. Here the fall rate is very important in my opinion and I want the jig to take as long as possible to get to the bottom. Differences in line color do make a difference in certain situations in my opinion. For most of the lakes I have fished in Canada though it has not been much of an issue since most are pretty stained. The Great Lakes or Finger Lakes are a totally different story. I hate to not have flourocarbon on those bodies of water with the water as clear as it is."
1452631,johnboat,2012-06-22 10:26:00,2014,"Bigger jigs = better visability, better hook set, and stays on the bottom better. (from Tommy Skarlis's web page) Thats the way I roll. Strictly a vertical jigger myself. 3/8ths for me. If its dead calm MIGHT go to a 1/4. In rougher water WILL go to 1/2. If I was pitching, ya, I'd go lighter. Fishing line. I prefer vanish transition. But who knows about the visability thing. I've been in full camo and deer make me 200 yds out. Next day walk right under me when I am wearing street clothes. My myth to correct is ""be quiet, you'll spook the fish"" I sometimes think a little Jimmy Buffett or John Prine are a better attractant than a good looking minnow."
1452643,Bill Krejca,2012-06-22 10:40:00,6107,"Here's my take on the subjects: - Jig Weight - In most cases, the weight is there to get the bait where you want it. If casting, it enables the bait to sail out to the desired spot. If vertical fishing, it enables the bait to get to the depth desired, usually the bottom. In all but one instance I can think of, the weight should be as light as possible to achieve the above. This allows for a slower sink rate, which normally provides a little longer window of opportunity for the fish to grab it, as well as allowing the bait to be sucked in easier during the gill flaring. One instance where I prefer a heavy(5/8oz) jig is when I use a Power Leech; then I feel the action of the leech is enhanced by the heavy weight being able to better emulate a leech by simply by moving it an inch or so up and down - I do not want a coasting or gliding action, similar to what is usually desired by a minnow imitator/ real minnow. - Line Color - there are many posts on WC and other sites on the subject of line color or transparency. Whatever a person believes to be true as to line visibility being/not being detrimental to a bite can be found/ proven by a search and spending the day reading the various comments and experiences of the posters. Some quasi scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, and made available to the public, that I have read about, some of which tend to indicate line visibility to not be a major issue; some indicate some colors to be better, in that water, on that day, for that specie, than another color. My feel-good is to use a clear leader, or color the bright line when fishing in clearer water, not so much when the water is more on the murky side. I don't know if it matters, seems to depend on many variables, some of which we probably haven't identified, nor even have the faintest idea of their significance. It certainly is an interesting subject, given the amount of comments and the frequency of which the subject is brought up. I would be interested in any experiments readers make on the subject - be sure to include all the evident variables in the study and report. Bill Krejca"
1452720,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-22 13:25:00,235,Agreed. I have caught fish straight under the back of the boat with the motor running in five feet of water. Nothing wrong with playing music at a modest volume or yucking it up with your buddies. The fish don't care. Just be respectful if others are nearby.
1452727,new hips,2012-06-22 13:40:00,498,"Jig weight..........2 guys fishing a point catching walleye after walleye with 1/4 white jigs and 3in white twister tail(in 24ft of water). I stop and put on 5/8 oz gold with white twister tail. I get 1 fish to his 7.....see a pattern here? Switched back and started catching again. Line Viz...............When jigging I use Hi Viz like Fireline Crystal, so I can see the line were it leaves the water(gray doesn't work to well) I use a tiny swivel and 18in dropper of Fluorocarbon 8lb. Works for Me"
1452741,Mohleye,2012-06-22 14:05:00,368,"I agree the quiet thing is a myth, at least sometimes. We are serious fishermen, but I'm on vacation with very good friends, some of who I don't see as often as I should, and we are going to talk and laugh, maybe yell at the guys in the other boat, etc....also have caught many many fish with motor running in 6' or less. Also, many times drilled a hole ice fishing, scooped it out and immediately caught a fish. And sometimes the only fish at that hole."
1452488,packpro,2012-06-21 21:49:00,695,"OK, looking for a lively discussion on two fishing concepts. No right, wrong, or judgement, just opinions and personal experience.1) When jigging you should use the lightest jig possible. Thoughts- Isn't it the jig that is getting the attention of the predator? Wouldn't a bigger jig attract more attention? Also, wouldn't a heavier jig insure a tighter line? Tighter line= more vibration transferred to the rod handle? Me..I'm a line watcher, which brings us to point #2.2) Hi vis yellow vs. flourcarbon. Is there such thing as ""line shy"" fish? They are about to bite something with a (usually visable) hook. Sometimes two trebles. It may look like food, but not really. The big hook(s) with a significant larger diameter than the line are ignored, but the line puts them off? If you say they are focusing on the bait not the hook, it is reasonable to assume they can focus on bait and ignore the line as well. I don't think this species is easily conditioned. They experience the pain of the hook time after time but keep coming back. I have been bitten off and caught the same fish on the next cast after retying. Two jigs side by side. I think the base predatory response supercedes all of the industry marketing, or maybe I am in shock at the price of the new lines. In our group Hi Vis out fishes flouro. How about you?"
1452501,jimmie,2012-06-21 23:15:00,123,"I think we are supoosed to be smarter than a fish wouldn't you say? Don't over think it. Hi vis flurocarbon both catch fish same as nylon and dacron have and still do worldwide. The hi vis likley does not stretch as much as fluro but with a finger on your line once you have set the hook you have set the hook. Fish can prove to be wiley depending on pressure during the season. Jig size seems to matter upon depth and current. What may be attached ( curly tail, minnow, crawler) is what the fish focus on unless they are starving when they may eat a shoestring (northern pike). You can catch a walleye on a 9"" Rapala and a Musky on a 1/16 oz jig. I have done both! Use what you know try different lures when some do not work until you find one that does. Light conditions, wind direction, water clarity can all affect your catching of fish. There is always a certain amount of luck involved (good & bad) when fishing. That's why we see it as a challenge more often than not. I am not an expert but here on Walleye Central is as good a place to learn between the couch and the water as any."
1452518,Pooch,2012-06-22 04:12:00,4619,"I ponder the same things as you and it sometimes makes I have to realize that it's fishing. Why two guys in the same boat both using the exact rig and one out fishes the other, but not everyday. Next day same thing, but the other guy is is now catching all fish.Hi visibility line vs. fluorocarbon? One day the fish ignore the yellow line tied directly to a jig and the next day they won't touch it, but will hammer the jig on fluorocarbon or any mono. Too many factors.What is fact today will be proven wrong tomorrow as sure as the sun will come up (with a little luck) in the east.Interesting question. There are so many fact/myths in our group about fishing that it in itself provides quite a bit of entertainment after supper each night.Pooch"
1452519,Obabikon,2012-06-22 04:38:00,2370,"I would say both make a difference. Jig weight is simply for sensativity of the bite. It's much easier to tell a fish is on a 1/4 oz jig than it is a 1/2 oz jig. Sometimes all you're feeling is the small ""weight"" that lets you know a fish grabbed onto your hook. Also, if fish weren't ""line shy"" why shouldn't be all be using 75LB mono to ensure no bite offs? I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes, and I agree not to over-think it. But, walleyes do respond differently to both questions."
1452522,tv4fish,2012-06-22 05:08:00,2694,"ONLY if you are using a plain jig - if the jig has live bait or a plastic tail - that is the attractor. I agree in using the lightest jig to place the bait where you want it - that allows you to ""feel"" the pickup by the fish. With a heavy jig and a ""light"" biter, you may never know he was there."
1452524,btmbncr,2012-06-22 05:15:00,492,"One of the main reasons for the ""lightest jig possible"" is the way a walleye feeds.It opens it's mouth,flares it's gills and ""sucks"" in water,along with the bait/food.The lighter jig makes it easier for the fish to get the bait in it's mouth. Walleyes swim into gill nets made out of 150 pound test line.Unless it's ultraclear water colored line doesn't spook them,then in this situation what line isn't going to spook them.The bright colored line makes it much easier to see a bite,ie the bow suddenly goes out of the line,the line twitches sideways,the jig stops sinking before it gets to the bottom.Bill"
1452544,REG,2012-06-22 06:50:00,445,"If I'm casting and using a twister tail on my jig (or a minnow for that matter), I want the lightest jig possible just to slow the fall. Many hits will come on the fall - either on the initial cast or as you're hopping it back in. I don't like the heavier jigs just because it falls like a rock and limits the time the fish has to grab it. Probably makes less of a difference when you're truly jigging and hugging the bottom.."
1452552,Mohleye,2012-06-22 07:07:00,368,"I think in both jig weight and line selection it's at least as important to use what you like and have decided works best for you through experimentation. I use a 1/4 oz jig most of the time, and I'm very reluctant to change just because I'm so used to the feel. Same with line, I've tried many but love the feel of 6 lb mono. My buddy that I do most of my fishing with locally uses a 1/8 oz jig , and one of us has to be seriously outfishing the other before either of us will switch. Of course, it has become a running joke and trash talking point, so it also involves swallowing a little pride to switch...."
1452559,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-22 07:15:00,235,"I like lighter jigs because I seem to get less snags. While we're at it with slaughtering sacred cows, I'd like to go after a few others: -Myth: Jig color matters. (It doesn't. Very often these colors look NOTHING like the forage a fish eats in the wild. Show me data if you want to convince me otherwise, not anecdotal experience.) -Myth: Walleyes hug the windblown shore. (This may be partially true for shallow water, but only after a very long time of a strong wind blowing in the same direction into a specific spot. 12 feet below the surface, the wind isn't really making a stir usually)."
1452565,micropterus,2012-06-22 07:27:00,450,It's the baitfish that are 12 feet down.
