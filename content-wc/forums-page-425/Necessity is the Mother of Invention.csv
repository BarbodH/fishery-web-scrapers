Just the three of us on a lake that rarely gets fished. One of the guys is still recovering from the night before and he starts the rehydration process with a popular sports drink. Still, it didn't stop him from packing 18 more in the cooler, ""You know, what if we get stuck out there"". With the plane getting ever smaller in the distance, we notice that the sky is getting dark. Not twilight dark.....more like, end of the earth dark. The sky opens up and it starts to rain. Big rain, huge drops, that sting has they pound down. We cannot see the island that is just 75 yards off the front of the boat. Undaunted we are going to get our money's worth, so we just keep fishing. Frustrated the big guy in the front of the boat cracks a beer and we all just laugh at the absurdity of our situation. No electric bilge pump on this boat. It is raining so hard, we are taking on so much water, everytime the big guys gets up we have waves inside the boat. Water is rushing into and over our waterproof (so we thought) boots. Oh ****, once your wet your wet, but the water in the boat is a concern. Low and behold I wipe my eyes and look away from my pole to see the big guy has taken a knife to the top of the empty sports drink bottle. He works on it feverishly as the water level in the boat is now at low calf level. Finally done, we stare at him with the anticipation that the water in the boat has no chance once attacked by the motivated big guy. We will be dry again soon. Without missing a beat he looks at us lets out a bellowing laugh, turns the carved half bottle over his open beer. It fits perfectly snug on the cozzi. Completely satisfied he laughs and declares, ""Look at that no more rain watering down my beer, ""How about that, first time.... no extra trimming at all .......perfect"" It has been a week since we were together and I just cannot stop laughing."

1451978,Fish_Heads,2012-06-20 20:59:00,154,I'm sure the boat was on shore contained in a building with a leaking roof .........why take a chance.........right ??
