Water temps dropped all week with the rain and cold. Fishing was good Saturday and Sunday and slowed during the week. Saw large numbers of mayflies on Tuesday and Wednesday. Fish were feeding on them. Roads are in good shape on the way, not much has changed in the past year. Fish were in the normal spots as they are every year. Caught some in 7-10 feet of water and some in 21-28 feet."

1450165,tackleman,2012-06-17 05:10:00,444,"got out yesterday and met up with moondog. we fished the flats (off the claybanks) by both jigging and trolling. after watching moondog nail fish after fish, it was determined that the blue jig was the colour to have."
1450167,jkwildhunting,2012-06-17 05:20:00,361,Good to hear from you tackleman! Hopefully the weather straightens up. Hopefully see u.sometime next week
1450468,Moondog,2012-06-17 20:59:00,362,Hey! We went looking for you knowing you would be sitting on FISH! Sneaky? We really had a great time and as always learned more about Gullrock. Went out today and missed most of the rain. We have trees growing in our boat.........nice touch but could use a few days of dry weather. FISH ON!!!
1452133,Blue Fin,2012-06-21 08:40:00,47,"Sorry for the late report, but we were up there from June 9th to the 16th. It rained every day except Friday and overall had about 8 inches of rain. We had to come in a few times due to lightning and we lost power one night for about 15 minutes. Throw in the mayfly hatch half way through the week and it was a pretty tough week. We found that there were a lot of fish suspended and feeding on the mayflies. In a few bays we found the ""piranha's"" right on the surface and having a feeding frenzy. I tried to cast at these spots and never had any luck persuading them to feed on something else. Overall the best places to fish seemed to be the islands. The sides of the lake constantly showed fish but they were mostly inactive. I am not sure if that has something to do with more mayflies being in shallow water but that makes a little sense to me.We had our best luck on jigs and live bait rigs, tipped with leeches and minnows. One evening we threw out some bobbers and caught a handful of walleyes over 20 inches. It seemed like the best colors for jigs were ones with green and blue on them....funny how that changes from year to year.We started the week with water temps at almost 70 degrees and by the end of the week we were at 58. We started off trying in shallow water (5-10 feet) and had some luck the first few days. One day I believe our boat of 3 caught around 175 walleyes with the biggest being 25.5 inches. But after some mid week struggles, we figured out that most fish were stacked up in that 18 to 22 foot range but not very active.It was a good, safe trip even with the fishing and weather being tough. The border on the way home took us 10 minutes. That made the tough trip home that much easier. Last year we had a 1.5 mile line that took several hours to get through. The guys going up there in the next week or two should have good luck."
