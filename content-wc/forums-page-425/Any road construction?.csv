1452179,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-21 09:59:00,109,In just over two weeks my group is heading up to Lake Savant. Bemidji-->I-Falls-->Dryden-->Sioux Lookout-->West Caribou Air. Just checking to see if anyone is aware of any road construction along that route that we need to be aware of so we can adjust our departure time in order to account for any delays. Thanks!

1452212,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-21 11:00:00,109,"Thanks, TV - I'm more concerned with what we might run into north of the border, as there are FAR fewer options for detours once you get a ways into Canadia. I had heard there was some resurfacing being done somewhere along the route I'll be taking, and was wondering if it had yet been completed."
1452252,tv4fish,2012-06-21 12:14:00,2694,"Bob: When we came back through June 9th, they were milling and resurfacing just east of Wabigoon and they were headed east. They may well be done on that stretch now???"
1452275,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-21 13:41:00,109,Let's hope so...we're already leaving at 3am on the day of departure; I'd hate to have to make it any earlier!
