1451497,dutchboy,2012-06-19 20:56:00,5717,At the end of their stay a inspection of the cabin BEFORE they settle up would discover any problems. Bill them at that time. Have a chart with ALL charges from props to mattresses posted in your office.I would personally tour the whole group through their cabin upon check in and again at checkout.
1451632,SinOrSwim,2012-06-20 08:40:00,1528,"Ugh, that is disgusting. I have always taken an extra sheet with me along with my sleeping bag so I don't actually touch the mattress but holy moly is that bad. You could call them and ask who was in which room. Then, post a BIG PICTURE of the person or of the group to let all the others know who peed the bed. Sort of like places used to do with bad checks. You are right, how are they hiding that from the rest of the group? Just sleeping in it the whole time? I can't imagine people would pee on something just before they leave. Either way, what a horrible issue to deal with. Your business is hard enough."
1451665,5richards,2012-06-20 09:48:00,131,"If you are certain that it was a specific group, I would contact the ""leader"" of the group and discuss the issue. There may be a ""bad"" apple in the group that the partners were not aware of. Give them an opportunity to make good for your loss. If you encounter opposition or refusal, move on. You don't want them back. You then could consider informing your fellow outfitters in the area of your experience and to be aware/careful of booking this party."

1451844,epiepenburg,2012-06-20 16:32:00,365,"The outfitter that I just returned from requires a $150 cleaning deposit. When the plane comes to pick us up and bring the next group in, the leader of the incoming group is in charge of signing off on the cleaning via a check off sheet.. When you return to the office to pay your bill you have to give them the signed check off sheet. Then you get your cleaning deposit back. This process seems to work well."
1451854,Outfitter Gal,2012-06-20 16:52:00,4,"Thanks for all the suggestions. And Canada Dave, this is no joke. I guess you've never been in the business of renting anything to anyone."
1451879,campchick,2012-06-20 17:52:00,96,"Sorry to hear of your problem ""Outfitter Gal"". Urine on a mattress has not happened to me but I have cleaned up bedding after a drunk guest had vomited on it. One time I had to clean sh*t off a blanket - yup, another intoxicated person. Makes you see people in a whole new light. The men were terribly embarrassed but the cleaning fell to me. I was glad when the plane came to pick them up."
1451938,Outfitter Gal,2012-06-20 20:01:00,4,"Man....haven't had that fun job, I feel for you. I don't know about you, but whenever I travel and stay in a motel/hotel, rent a vehicle, rent a tool, etc. I leave the room tidy, wipe up the bathroom, clean the vehicle, etc."
1451316,Outfitter Gal,2012-06-19 14:25:00,4,"What are your solutions to prevent wet mattresses?.......and I don't think I have to be specific about the nature of the liquid. Plastic covers get taken off, torn, etc. I've about had it with those that are able to move the can/bottle to their mouth, but can't move their ""can"" and get out of their bed."
1451332,adempsey,2012-06-19 14:56:00,963,"Seriously? Bleh, that's just not right."
1451345,v-bay gord,2012-06-19 15:14:00,3168,That seems unusual to me.....never had such issues. If the problem is overindulgence perhaps you might attempt to lay down some ground rules. You could ask your linen supplier for a better grade of mattress protector I suppose. My first instinct would be to eliminate the type of guest that is giving you the problem.
1451358,Outfitter17,2012-06-19 15:51:00,127,"I thought you were just kidding, but I guess not? I have been in the business for the past 12 years and I have never run into this issue. I guess you put the mattress outside until it dries and then pour the frebreeze to it? On the other hand you could charge the guest for a new mattress and if they dispute it, ask them if they would like to sleep on a mattress that had just been peed on last week - I bet they would say no and just pay the bill.Good luck"
1451390,tooski,2012-06-19 17:08:00,393,Been flying in over 40 years and never saw that problem. My guess is it is not a Canada issue and it happens at home. Gotta agree with Outfitter that if is a continuing problem the peepertrators should be buying that matress -and the cost to fly it in. They know they have issues and I am not condemning them. But someone needs to be held responsible.
1451398,phishfearme,2012-06-19 17:28:00,1242,i agree with tooski - for a change. treat it just like you would if someone destroys a prop or motor. by the way - i spent a week on a matress covered in plastic - will NEVER go back to that outfitter. he had many signs in the cabin about cost for damaging anything - including $50 for tearing off the plastic matress covers. keep your clients happy - but within reason. phish
1451457,Outfitter Gal,2012-06-19 19:34:00,4,"I don't supply linens; guests bring sleeping bags or bedding. And, they're long gone before we can find what they left behind. I guess a ""damage"" deposit might be in order.It is disgusting, and I often wonder how they manage to use their sleeping bags....not to mention keeping it a secret from the others in their group. At least I can dunk the mattresses in the lake, scrub the daylights out of them and lay them in the sun."
1451478,grizzley,2012-06-19 20:07:00,2518,"are you sure that they aren't doing it just before they leave? believe it or not, there are some real A- - holes out there. I know things are tough right now, but I think I'd tell that group that they need to find another place to stay, especially if it's happened more than once."
1451483,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-19 20:23:00,235,How many times has this happened? Is it the same group each time?
1451489,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-06-19 20:30:00,84,I have been on a bender a few times in my life and I can say with certainty I have never peed the bed. At least not since I was a little kid. That's the craziest thing I have ever heard.
