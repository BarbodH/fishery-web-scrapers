1452214,UKBDM,2012-06-21 11:02:00,178,We leave tomorrow morning @ 7:00am. We usually go up thru Duluth to Int'l Falls to Dryden.Flooding in Duluth has us concerned. Suggested detour is west of Twin Cities to 71N. Adds 150 miles and 3 hours.Considering going up thru Michigan thru Sault Ste Marie and taking 17 over to Thunder Bay and up to Dryden. Adds 200 miles and 4 hours.Anybody have experience with the Sault Ste Marie route? How bad (or good) is 17 along the shore of Superior? Hotels between Sault Ste Marie and Thunder Bay?Any suggestions are appreciated.
1452235,10point,2012-06-21 11:45:00,102,I don't know anything about the Duluth area but man that seems like a big detour. I crossed at the Soo last week and the bridge is only 2 lanes so you might want to avoid times when there could be lots of people crossing. We crossed both times late at night.
1452237,10point,2012-06-21 11:47:00,102,I should add I have only been on 17 to Wawa and the road is very good and it is a scenic drive.
1452241,bigdaddyguns,2012-06-21 11:55:00,608,"Here is a list of road closures in the area. I did not see any mention of Rt53 so given your alternate routes, I would go as planned but be prepared for heavier traffic. http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/"
1452247,jiggster,2012-06-21 12:05:00,183,"You could also take 494 north to 10 then go 371 through brainerd, walker, bemidji and 71 to International Falls. Map quest has it at 6 hrs. 37 Minutes. Lakeville,mn through Cloquet to International Falls which is closed is 5 hrs. 20 min. 1 hr. 17 min. longer. Going up 169 to Grand Rapids/ Hibbing/ International Falls is 6 hrs. 29 min."
1452386,Aaron-IN,2012-06-21 17:30:00,500,"I'm leaving Sunday from Indy as well, 53 via Duluth is not and will not be closed, you will be okay.good luck, weather looks to be pretty good for a change."
1452408,buckeyedan,2012-06-21 18:50:00,44,"The only thing I have to add is that Hwy 17 from Sault Ste. Marie to White River is as pretty of a drive as you will ever see. Sounds like things will be OK through Duluth according to other posters, but if you have a few hours to spare and want a change of scenery, I recommend it. We do that drive almost every year and it never gets old..."
1452414,UKBDM,2012-06-21 19:20:00,178,We have decided to go thru at Sault Ste Marie. Thanks for all the input.We have always wanted to go this way and I think things in Duluth are uncertain at best. Detours will be crowded and hotels will be booked.We are going to try to get to Marathon the first night. Have reservation at Travellodge right on 17.
1452444,Rich B,2012-06-21 20:16:00,1081,Let us know what you think about your drive via the Soo when you get back....have a good week on the water at Perrault Falls....I was up there for the opener....can't wait to go back ! Rich B
1452446,boyks,2012-06-21 20:27:00,5,FYI you are looking at about 8 hours from Marathon to Dryden. About 4 to Thunder Bay and 4 more to Dryden. Get gas in Thunder Bay if needed. Very scenic drive from SSM to TBay as you run along Lake Superior. Drive safe.
