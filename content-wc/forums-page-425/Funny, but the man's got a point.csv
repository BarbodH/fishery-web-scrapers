Keep smiling', fellas! Bill"
1452099,adempsey,2012-06-21 07:42:00,963,"Lol. I am thinking there's a lot else going on there. Maybe he has some stomach issues, who knows.I do carry wipes though for a variety of uses."
1452127,fishinnut 3446,2012-06-21 08:28:00,638,"That right there is funny!! UMMMM...Honey could you turn around while I do a maintenance wipe,I wonder if he has any anti monkey butt powder?"
1452144,Guest,2012-06-21 08:59:00,0,"The job isn't finished till the paperwork is done. But, this guy seems anal. I also carry a roll of TP in the boat at all times."
1452222,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-21 11:13:00,725,"I think this is hilarious and I am sure it will lead to some stories....like the time I wish I had the huggies, partner nosed the boat into an island and I got rid of the last night before's sins. I also left a once clean tshirt under a rock on that island and thought about the need for a maintenance wipe the rest of the day! If you found something like that in NW Ontario and can tell me the logo on the tshirt I will send you fifty bucks! Ha ha!"
1452229,adempsey,2012-06-21 11:29:00,963,"We really didn't need to know that, lol."
1452240,Turlington tom,2012-06-21 11:50:00,3,Looks like a good topic for Larry the Cable guy to comment on.
1452265,Pikeslayer8,2012-06-21 12:59:00,1460,"Yeah, I found your shirt. I found it under the rock when I slipped in for a maintenance wipe. (hope you don't mind that I reused it) Here it is!"
