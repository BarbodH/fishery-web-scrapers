1452274,jiggster,2012-06-21 13:39:00,183,"If you look at tv4fish map link, it looks like 35 is closed so you can not get to Duluth. I could be wrong, so look at the map yourself."
1452282,Guest,2012-06-21 13:47:00,0,"My understanding is that I35 northbound is open, I35 southbound is closed. Will check this again later today before I leave Fri morning. It also looks like you could exit onto 33 at Cloquet as usual, turn right onto Morris Thomas Rd (Co Rd 56) before you get to the bridge that is washed out, then left onto Canosia Rd (Co Rd 98?) to go north to US53. Maybe the DOT is advising us to use those rts that are so far west in case the creeks may rise further?"
1452332,dutchboy,2012-06-21 15:28:00,5717,Is the bridge really washed out? The bridge onto Hwy. 53 from Hwy 33 was torn out to be replaced. They routed you down to a 3 way stop light with Hwy. 53.Maybe something did wash out but when I traveled home last Sunday everything was ok.
1452459,jiggster,2012-06-21 20:54:00,183,Listening to 511 and the 511 web site it appears 33 is now open.
1452489,Pat,2012-06-21 22:00:00,203,Thanks headed that way in the morning.
1452492,jimmie,2012-06-21 22:15:00,123,If you come to grand Rapids it is shorter to go west to Deer River then north on MN 6 that connects to US 71 to Pelland at the end turn right and 11 miles to I falls and the Border. It does not seem closer to go this way but it actuall is only 120 miles from GR to the Falls this way. To go thru Hibbing to 73 and up to 53 then the Falls is about 143 miles. Your choice. I'm going up next weekend to sSioux Lookout and have gone to Deer River and up for years after using the 169 to 73 to 53 for yesrs not realizing it was closer to go left before I went back right.
1452498,rather-be-fishin,2012-06-21 22:33:00,429,"YES...As of now, this route would be a good route and save a lot of time. I 35 to Hwy 53 as of now is open. Hwy 53 by the Mall in Duluth is dry and open now. Hwy 53 to Int. Falls as of now, road is in good condition. Keep checking the road conditions since river & stream water is still rising and roads/bridges are collapsing. Moose Lake, Barnum, Cloquet, Duluth and surrounding areas and North Shore have suffered tremendous flood damage. Duluth News Paper has many good pictures and articles covering the flood: http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/"
1452137,jiggster,2012-06-21 08:46:00,183,"I will be heading to International Falls on my way to Canada. I called the Highway department to confirm the best way to get to International Falls from the cities. I was told I had to go all the way over to 71 by Sauk Centre and up. I called the Brainerds office. I was told we could go up 10 to 371 thru Brainerd, Walker, Bemidji and 71 to International Falls."
1452146,Lovetofish,2012-06-21 08:59:00,458,What about 169 to Grand Rapids?
1452163,tv4fish,2012-06-21 09:23:00,2694,"This may be a helpful link - it shows the road conditions/closures:http://gisservices2.dot.state.mn.us/...SURESPage.htmlJust ""Zoom in"" or drag the map to the area that you want to check.Jigster: I also would suggest 169 all the way to Hibbing - then turn off to 73 north and then hit 53 to I falls.We normally take 65, but it is partially closed right now."
1452168,jiggster,2012-06-21 09:31:00,183,I asked about 169 going thru Grand Rapid to Hibbing and The state said you can not get through. I called Brainerd office and they said the best way was thru walker. the route above is what they told me.
1452178,Lovetofish,2012-06-21 09:59:00,458,Thanks for posting the map. Very useful.
1452184,tv4fish,2012-06-21 10:10:00,2694,No problem - I figure with all the rain/flooding we just experienced - it would be worthwhile for anyone heading up this way to check it out.I do believe MN/DOT updates that map very often so hopefully it will be accurate for anyone who uses it.
1452188,jiggster,2012-06-21 10:28:00,183,Thank You for the map. It does look to be open through Grand Rapid/ Hibbing.
1452200,jiggster,2012-06-21 10:45:00,183,"figured the two routes with map quest. From Lakeville,Mn. through Bemidji is 6 hrs. 37 Min. and through Grand Rapid / Hibbing is 6 Hrs. 29 Min."
1452202,Guest,2012-06-21 10:46:00,0,"I found another link that looks good:http://hb.511mn.org/main.jsf Here is a blog by the Duluth newspaper:http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/pages/weatherblog Apparently the problem in Cloquet is a bridge washout, not just flooding over the road. If so, could be a long time before it is fixed."
1452257,Guest,2012-06-21 12:29:00,0,"It looks to me like it should be possible to take I35 north all the way into Duluth, then turn onto US53 north there. US53 runs past a mall that is said to be wet, but I guess the road is OK. Anyone in the Duluth area who knows if this would be a reasonable way to go? If this route is indeed open, maybe the traffic would be bad with all the other closures? Thanks very much to whoever started this thread!"
