1452791,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-22 15:49:00,235,"Last year on Okanse Lake (fly in, east of Red Lake area), we got into to some late summer walleyes schooled up on a shallow rock bar. For fun, I decided to throw some of my old smallmouth favorites and hooked a few. I put on a Senko, and I believe I did a few casts wacky style and caught one (also got some on a hula grub), but I'm pretty sure I went back to Texas rigging because wacky style gets me snagged up on all the rocks. The short answer: it can work, but you have to have an active bite in shallow water that you can pitch to. However, it is probably not the preferred tactic if your goal is to catch as many as possible."
