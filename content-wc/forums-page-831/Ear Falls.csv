537176,Guest,2004-02-06 12:32:00,0,"Just booked a trip to Golden Fawn resort. Never been to that end of Lac Suel and after reading several posts i have a couple questions. There are several lodges in the immediate area Evergreen, Gold Pines, Goose Bay etc... We will be there the week of June 19th. How long of a boat ride will we need to make for good fishing? Were is the Dam? Will we have to go around it? I've fished the Sioux Lookout Area in June... Similar fishing to the Sioux Lookout area?"
537180,Guest,2004-02-06 16:02:00,0,Call Barb at Golden Fawn your host will be glad to answer any questions for you. You have experienced the lake so you know how wonderful the walleye fishing is. Good luck and enjoy.
537183,Guest,2004-02-06 17:36:00,0,You won't have to run but about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile to find fish. The dam will be about a mile northwest of your camp and no reason to go that way. Should find fishing about the same on both ends of the lake. Camp owner should point you in the right direction.
537186,Guest,2004-02-06 19:18:00,0,For great fishing you will want to head toward ghost narrows or turkey creek. The narrows as you hit Mckenzie can be good if the wind is right.

537213,Guest,2004-02-08 00:46:00,0,If its too windy to go out on the main lake we always found it was good fishing around the bridge. It used to be for trains but the last time we were there the loggers were using it. toward the dam was also good fishing. everyone allways had to go out on the main lake but dont discount going toward the dam. if you can get below the dam the fishing is real good there too. sometimes the lodge will move our boat there. we got out limit for walleye and northers in one day there. its right in town the launch ramp is so try that too. I wish we had learned about that earlier. we went there for 20 years. the fish are al over. good luck..
