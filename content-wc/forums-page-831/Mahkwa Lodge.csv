Thanks Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."

Rates are per cabin per day. Ten man cabin is $365 a day, eight man cabin $315 a day, six man cabin $250 per day, four man cabin $180 aday. My bill for five days last September was about $320 with three people in our group. Cabins are pretty basic but all we used them for was to sleep and have our evening meal. We were otherwise fishing our brains out. We bought our own boat and our food. I think the rates have gone up slightly for 2004. Fishing is pretty easy, go to point, hump, shoreline, begin fishing and begin catching walleyes. Then go to next point, hump, shoreline, begin fishing and begin catching walleyes. Repeat over and over. Enjoy."

My boat they cook breakfast and supper and provide a kit for shore lunch or make sandwich for you. The fishing was excellent and near by ,we caught hundreds of fish in sight of the lodge. I'm going back this 4th of July. I looked at cabins they are basic but should be fine. Mwal"
537154,Guest,2004-02-05 08:08:00,0,We have fished the area of the lake that Mahkwa Lodge is located on and the fishing is awesome. I would say that if it meets all your other needs it would be a great place to get a case of Walleye Elbow.
