537166,Guest,2004-02-05 18:38:00,0,You might wanna think about Lake of the Woods and the Rainy River in the fall. I have seen many fish in their teens in this system. If you need someone to fish with let me know.
537167,Superdad,2004-02-05 20:24:00,64,"I would agree with BigFish1965 as the Bay of Quinte being the place to capture, photgraph and release a 15lber or more. Although I haven't attained that size of walleye, I have a friend who who caught a 15 Plus and 17 plus within twenty minutes of each other. I have put some pictures from 2003, starting in May and ending in Nov that might be of interest.https://www.walleyecentral.com/photop...&ppuser=101882 Have a look and ponder the BoQ Tight Lines - Soft water walleyes open May 1st,2004 David Delcloo aka Superdad"

536939,liprippin,2004-01-28 11:36:00,4,Need help for my birthday my wife gave me a trip to anywhere I wanted for a trophy walleye. I'd like to catch & release or atleast try for a mid teens walleye. Looking for help with lodging & guide! I have a Ranger 620 so big wather is not out of question. Thanks for any Ideas or help. E-mail at [email protected]
536940,Guest,2004-01-28 11:41:00,0,Most of us would love to be able to go on a trip and have a shot at a Walleye in the teens. If I knew where to go I would be there. Biggest I have ever caught or seen has been on the Winnipeg and Red rivers in Manitoba. Have caught 4 in the teens myself and have probably seen 50 or so in the last four years during our annual three day trip.
536941,liprippin,2004-01-28 11:54:00,4,Would you have any names of towns to stay by those rivers and the time of year thats best. I know it'll be tough and maybe won't get any but have to try! Thanks
536942,Guest,2004-01-28 12:10:00,0,"Try typing in....cat eye oputfitter....once you get to their site there is lots of good info and links. There are lots of fisherman on WC that fish there in the fall for big walleye. The Manitoba record came out of the Red 39"" 19 lbs."
536944,Ia Walihntr,2004-01-28 12:13:00,320,"A buddy and his party go to Tobin in northern Sask. every year in late late fall. Group is 6 or 7 guys. Last fall they got several 10s, 3 11s, 1 12#, and 1 13#. 15s are possible!!! Must keep in mind though that it's a long way to tow a boat. The last 70 miles or so before Nipawin is all gravel. My buddy said it was just like shooting a sand blaster at the trailer and the front of the boat. Now all that tow boats have mud flaps that hang almost to the ground from one side of the pickup to the other. You deffinently need to expect any kind of weather though, from sunny (although chilly) to stormy (snow) with rough water. When the big part of the reservoir is rough you can stay in the Saskatchewan River to fish. (won't be nearly as rough)"

536952,Guest,2004-01-28 13:19:00,0,"I fish at Nipawin (Tobin Lake) almost every weekend all season May - Oct. My biggest this year was 12.5, but I had lots of 10+ fish over the year. Best time is fall for big ones, but I got my 12.5 and a 10.5 within a hour on the last weekend in June. The road to Nipawin was under construction last year - it's not normally gravel. It is all new blacktop all the way there now -- I should know I drive 3.5 hours each way every weekend to go there. Talk to Twin Marine (Curtis or Teresa) at (306)862-BOAT or go to the web page at www.tobinlake.net You can see photos of my wife with a 10 pounder (hugging fish in life jacket on the dock) and my biggest fish (blue jacket with boat roof up behind me) Later.
