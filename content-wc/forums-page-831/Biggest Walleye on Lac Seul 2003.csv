537137,Guest,2004-02-04 13:08:00,0,"I don't think that was my walleye, I usually drink Crystal out of the bottle and break them on the rocks or sink them for structure."
537138,Guest,2004-02-04 13:48:00,0,We know it was your Walleye because we could still see the powder burns on it from your .357
537142,IA  DAN,2004-02-04 16:39:00,53,"We go last week of July,the biggest this year was 27in. using 1/2oz slip sinker tipped with a night crawler.Most of our fish were in 15-20ft of water.That time of year we use leeches and crawlers,no minnies.Good Luck on your trip. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
537188,Guest,2004-02-06 20:03:00,0,I've been going to Lac Seul for about 9 years still have not broke 30 Last year 29.5......riggin
537192,Guest,2004-02-07 05:45:00,0,I have been going to Lac Seul for 16 years and my biggest Walleye is 17 inchs but the Polish Master caught one twice as big as mine. Of course everything he has is twice as big as mine.
537097,Guest,2004-02-02 13:39:00,0,Heading for Lac Seul this year for the first time. Wondering what the biggest Walleye was the WC gang caught there last year. What time of the year and what bait?
537101,Guest,2004-02-02 16:55:00,0,"My 11-year old son caught the big fish for our group last year, a 30 1/4 inch walleye, caught in Lac Seul the first week in June on a Wiggle Wart, casting it on to a sand bank. The fish was in about 5"" of water when it hit. I know a Wiggle Wart is not suppose to be a walleye crank-bait, but my son didn't listen to me when I tried to have him put on a more traditional crank. So much for what I know. Now I listen to him when he says ""I have a feeling about this place or lure."" IW Walleye"
537103,orchard frank,2004-02-02 20:25:00,1900,"We did not break 30"" this past yr. (middle 2 wks of Aug.) but several 27 to 28 1/2. Like the other post noted, never be afraid to try shallow even on hot still days when it ""shouldn't"" work. We fish mostly with bouncers and minnows or leeches, also cranks. I have also had good luck with 4"" tubes on a light jig, steady retrieve to avoid snags."
537121,Smeds,2004-02-03 18:14:00,103,"ttt ... I'm going for the first time this year also, so this is an interesting question. Only two replies? Must be more out there than that!"
537122,Guest,2004-02-03 18:24:00,0,28 1/2 inches released the first week of August 03
537125,Guest,2004-02-04 06:12:00,0,"Also 28.5, May 03, on a crankbait. Countless numbers between 20-25."
537126,Guest,2004-02-04 06:47:00,0,"Last year second week of June five of us fished for six days and caught 1180 Walleyes. At least 25% of them over 24"" and many of those in the 27"" to 28"" class. Most of our fish come on jig/minnow in 3' to 8' water. At that time of year we are catching fish in a transistion pattern from spawning areas to primary and secondary points. The wind is our best guide to finding good forage areas and hot spots. I believe our biggest fish was 29 1/2"" and one of the guys who has been going to Lac Seul for 16 years told us at the end of the first day that he had caught the 9 biggest Walleye he had ever caught on Lac Seul."
537127,Guest,2004-02-04 06:56:00,0,"I should have mentioned that this year we are going to have a special fisherman join our group. The infamous Walleye catching machine ""Barney Vanderheyden"" is going to grace us with his presence. His fishing ability has been well documented on Walleye Central and Im waiting with baited breath to watch ""Master Barney"" employ his Walleye catching techniques on Lac Seul.

537129,Guest,2004-02-04 08:30:00,0,"Had a bad year last year and the biggest was a 26 1/2"". Threw her up on the rocks for the gulls. Leaves more bait fish for the little ones."
537131,Guest,2004-02-04 10:21:00,0,"Hey Dick...Was there the week after you. Your fish was still alive and had grown to 29"". Little dry but still kicking."
