We will need a Guide and we want to fish for 4 or 5 days. We live in west central Iowa and would love to hear from you guys about some people to contact about catching some Cats. Thanks, Grampa"

537088,Guest,2004-02-02 09:13:00,0,"Hi Gramps Love to see people taking younger kids fishing. Especially family. Email me, maybe we can connect and get you and your grandson on some cats this summer. He won't be dissapointed trust me. You may have to keep bringing him back once he's hooked. email - [email protected] Blair"
537089,Guest,2004-02-02 09:22:00,0,"Have fished the Red below Selkirk a few times, and it is fun. It's a relaxed kind of fishing, but the anticipation of a big fish keeps you hooked watching your line. I don't have any contact info, but have gone with Dallas Stevenson, and have so far always caught some master angler sized ones. Fun guy to fish with."
537091,Guest,2004-02-02 11:18:00,0,"Why not just fish US waters of the Red? The Grand forks and Drayton areas of the Red river have great Catfishing, maybe not as good as up near Selkirk and Lockport, but great none the less. I would'nt even bother with a guide, these fish are very easy to catch. Sturdy rod, selection of heavier weights, hooks around 2/0-4/0, bait up with a leopard frog or a chunk of cutbait and you're in the business! Late June thru September is Prime fishing."

You couldn't get a better guide or have a better experience. He primarily guides on the US side but talk to him about what you are after.[email protected] Todd Oh yeah... I stuck her good... Feel that head shake..."

I do not know if they are necessary though if you bring your own boat. Stu also rents boats and you can do a lot of fishing from shore. We enjoy night fishing from shore with the kids. Usually lots of drift wood for the fire to roast their hot dogs, I guess it depends on what kind of experience you are looking for. The red is not exactly pristine, ok its a muddy river which needs a lot more care, but it sure has a trophy cat fishery. 03 we my family (4)caught over 30 cats that were 34"" and up If you get tired of the cats in the summer try the carp. The 6500 will do fine, I burnt out the drag on a 5500, but got my moneys worth and then some out of it. Try http://www.travelmanitoba.com Lots of travel information hotels etc. They have a great search for trophy fish that can provide the best historical dates,bodies of water, species etc. The thing about the local guides are that they can put you onto other options if you get sick of the cats. Theres a few trophy smallmouth lakes. (You gotta love smallies on light gear.) or maybe crowduck for a whack of walleye. Lots of options you could discuss with the guide if you go that route and you could get a pretty good fishing manitoba experience with memories to last a life time. Good luck and enjoy"
