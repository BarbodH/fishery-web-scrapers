537214,Guest,2004-02-08 01:45:00,0,we stayed there for many years when glenn and delores owned it.when they sold we got a brochure from the new owners saying that instead of raising prices they actually lowered them! well we had the last years price list so knew that they had actually raised all the prices. bad mistake. Thats when we started going to GOLDEN FAWN just down the way a bit. These folks were from kansas so I dont know if the place changed hands again or not. The wife and I liked the small cabins. the kitchen dining room had nice paintings on the wall in most of the cabins even if they were small. they were pleasant. the bathrooms were part of the porch and generally were unheated back then. We always found the table and chairs on the small size. dont get the cabin by the gas tank. We have always found that the first time we go to any lodge that we always get the crummiest cabin they have. Anyone else have that experience too? Any way we probably went there for about 12 to 15 years. The fishing was always good and we did not have to go far. we would go out at 10 am and come back at about 3 with a load of fish to clean. we would have an early dinner and maybe a little afternoon delight! and then go out about 6 again. the sun does not set up there until about 11. so you have plenty of daylight. if I remember right the sun started coming up again around 4 am. Its really not necessary to head out at 6am to catch fish. they will still be there at 11 or 1 or 3 or anytime you have a line in the water. You dont need any good luck either. go by the falls . its very nice there. we go to LOTW now. just a little close. I could write a book but then so could everyone else. have fun
