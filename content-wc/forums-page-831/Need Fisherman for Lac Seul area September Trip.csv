536875,Guest,2004-01-25 13:23:00,0,"I have been to this camp approximately 5 times. The walleye action in spring, was so-so. The ones we did catch were nicely sized 22"" or so. The only drawback that I saw was the scenery was boring. The river wasnt too wide and was on the shallow side. It seems to me that canada means ""pristine waters"", but I know they did flyouts and we slaughtered them there. If you stay at the big cabin , it is a very nice looking chalet that is good for partying. How has the fishing been in september?"
