I'm looking for anyone who has been to this place and can give me some details (time of year, accomodations, guides, etc.) I'm actually most interested in pike fishing, but it sounds like it's a good place for multiple species. Any info. is appreciated along with email address so I can contact you. Thanks. Rick W.[email protected]"
