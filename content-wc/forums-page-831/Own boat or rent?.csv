537105,Guest,2004-02-03 01:08:00,0,if you get one of those plastic props like a pirahna you only have to replace the messed up blade. Thats what I use in canada. Its 20 a blade compared to being down or repairing it.
537114,Guest,2004-02-03 11:50:00,0,"They probably rent Lunds. If so, you'll be fine! :) LOL...I couldn't resist."
537115,Guest,2004-02-03 13:02:00,0,Dan does rent Lunds out of Lac Seul Lodge. They are 17 or 18 ft with 40hp on them. We have always used them and they are great for fishing. There isnt much savings by bringing your own boat. You need to call Dan early and get the bigger boat because he only has a few....Good Luck
536989,Guest,2004-01-29 00:15:00,0,Hello. been to lac saul for about the last 20 years. used the lodges boat before getting my own. Its lund tyee IO. as mentioned above I would not leave my boat home. I bought it to use everywhere and that includes canada. as they say the main channel are not a problem the other areas you are slow and carefull anyway. also thats why you have a kicker and insurance just incase you wreck the main.
536996,Guest,2004-01-29 06:58:00,0,"you LS guys crack me up all the traveling, rocks and rough water just to catch a couple eyes dosen't make sense."

537021,Big Tim,2004-01-30 07:14:00,63,"Ivy, I'm with you! a 15 (+) hour drive & a ZILLION rocks to avoid will not deter a true fisherman from a lifetime of memories!"
537027,Peekay,2004-01-30 10:32:00,7,"What cracks me up is someone who mocks guys on a fishing messageboard for making the effort to travel for a great vacation when he just posted on another thread a few weeks ago that he(or his party) previously got turned away at the border for a DWI charge!!!(travelling to Canada to catch a few eyes, I'm guessing!?!?) Seems a little hypocritical to me!!!! Maybe Jojo has LS walleye envy, amongst other issues..... PK"
537041,fishinnut,2004-01-30 15:41:00,642,"I always take my boat to Canada, unless it's a fly-in, and I've dinged a few props. The way I see it, why have one if you don't use it. As far as those shore lunches go, I saw a new anchoring device/line that looks like it might be the ticket for those rocky shorelines. You anchor offshore, then motor into and unload. Your boat gets pulled back offshore by a bungee type rope. When you're done pull the boat in and away you go."
537061,Guest,2004-01-31 18:42:00,0,"Ok, here is what you do. I've been around a long time and have seen almost everything. HAHAHA I've been known to ding a prop or two myself, but think about trying this. If it's a new lake, hire a guide for a couple of days so you can fish from your own boat and learn a little while not having to worry about navigating so much. A couple days with a guide in your own boat would be cheaper than renting a resort boat for a week in most cases I'm sure. Also, more than likely you're insurance is cheaper than what you would have to pay for a resort motor being wrecked. Everyplace is different, but most places can't get insurance on rentals with anything less than $1000 deductible. That would be an extra cost for your trip. They may have some sort of insurance daily fee, but you know never. Why worry about it when you have a good rig? Good luck."
537066,IA  DAN,2004-02-01 08:28:00,53,"Apparently you've never fished Lac Seul jojo.AFEW WALLEYES???HAHAHA Doesnt matter what level of fisherman you are up there(first timer to season vet)YOU WILL CATCH FISH.So if you want to stay home and catch a FEW EYES so be it.Don't knock us for driving to catch more eyes than we can count.6 guys,3 boats,1 week of fishing over a thousand eyes and to many northerns to count.Yeh you stay home and catch afew eyes and we will go north and have the time of our lives. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
537067,Big Tim,2004-02-01 08:48:00,63,"Our 2002 trip cost the guys that lost an entire lower end $300. That's what the owners deductible was then. Not so bad compared to what you would have to deal with if you had to leave your boat in Canada till you could get it back on a trailer to bring it home. (worse case---hole on the boat the prevented you putting it on the trailer) I like the idea of bringing your own boat , even if it is glass, but get a guide for the first day (at least). Just be ready to spend much of the day scouting the worst hazards. Probably the comfort of having your own boat all week is worth the risk & time spent, Just my 2 cents."
537084,Guest,2004-02-02 07:18:00,0,"Dan I'm sorry if I hit a nerve. I have fished LS and it is a good lake and at the time I was impressed. But have found a lake that is a little farther north and alot more fisherman friendly if you know what I mean (rocks, travel, no guides ect) I only fish eyes but if I fished northerns I'd fish LS I think it is a good northern lake."
536943,Smeds,2004-01-28 12:12:00,103,"A buddy and I are heading up to Lac Seul Lodge end of June. First time at Lac Seul, and based on some of the past threads, looks like we picked a good lake! I have a 17.5' Warrior (glass) with 100hp Yamaha 4-stroke ... don't really want to ding it up. Sure would be nice to fish out of though. Rent lodge boat or haul your own ... What is the general opinion?"
536957,Guest,2004-01-28 13:32:00,0,If you take your own boat throttle back and drive slow and be careful. While Lac Seul is an awesome Walleye fishery she will also jump up and bite your boat if you dont proceed with caution. I have been fishing LS for several years and would not be afraid to take my own boat. I like my electronics and the fishability of my 18' Lund. HASTE MAKES WASTE
536958,Guest,2004-01-28 13:39:00,0,"Bring it with. Been going to Canada for 18 yrs, and twice, due to mechanical issues, had to rent a boat instead of bringing mine up. The trips are never as good. It's purely a comfort zone. On your boat, you know how it handles, the livewells are where you like them, the fishfinders and trolling motors are set-up as you like. Why leave all that behind? Dings? Possible, but any good resort owner will map out where the danger spots are. In 18 yrs, I've dinged the prop once, and hit rocks with the keel once. Both times at night, no moon, and hugging the shoreline way too tight Luckily minimal damage both times. My two cents."
536959,Big Tim,2004-01-28 13:48:00,63,"Lac Seul can be tough on boats, but why go to the expense of owning a boat if you are afraid to use it? That said, a glass boat could be in real danger on this lake, LOTS & LOTS of rocks to bump into. Lac Seul EATS lower ends (happened to a boat in our group in 2002). I sure would hate to be 20 miles from the lodge with no motor, or worse, a big hole in the boat! Dan has very nice 17 1/2' Lunds (tiller) with elect. start 40hp 4 stroke Yammahas that will run 29.9 mph & idle all day on little fuel. If you can live with that, you might want to leave the glass at home & use it on waters you are familiar with. Your call. Dan also does not drop the rate too much if you bring your own boat. Add up the diff. & then decide the savings verses the risk. I will say I do not remember seeing a glass boat on the lake in 3 (one week trips) to Lac Seul Lodge. Have fun it's a GREAT walleye lake!"
536963,Guest,2004-01-28 13:58:00,0,We ran a 2003 620 out of Dan's(fisherman's cove) without a problem. Just like the above said use caution. If your not sure slow down. This 620 will run 59 or 60mph gps but the only time I seen that was during the last 1/4 mile to the cabins. The rest of the time we ran very careful however put on upwards of 60 miles a day. Bottom line bring your boat! Otherwise sell your boat.
536972,orchard frank,2004-01-28 14:59:00,1900,"I have been going to the Seul for 10 yrs or so. I bring my own boat for comfort and gizmos. I agree with the other posts, be careful, hire a guide, follow others after you make friends in camp. Glass boats are touchy for shore lunch, maybe consider a keel guard. My wife and I consider it a boating vacation as well as some of the best fishing on the planet. Good luck, once you go you'll be back."
536977,Smeds,2004-01-28 17:34:00,103,"Thanks guys ... always great to have input. I use the heck out of my boat (live in Hayward, Wis.), and do have a keel guard, but I think since this is my first time to Lac Seul, I'll use the resort's boat. Looked at the difference (rent vs. bring), and I won't save much money on my package anyway. Probably use up the difference on gas for towing! Wimping out this year, but it sounds like one trip to Lac Seul and I'm hooked, so I will check things out, maybe bring mine next time. A hole in a glass boat is way nastier than an aluminum boat (neither is very nice)! Good luck & be safe to all!"
536978,Reels,2004-01-28 18:34:00,2876,"Pay your insurance on time, take your own boat. You will be a lot more comfortable. Just be carefull and take your time. Look at it this way. Even if you trash the resorts boat or motor, your most likely going to have to pay for it anyway. <{{}}><"
536982,rebelrn2001,2004-01-28 19:40:00,1563,We were at Fishermans Cove last June. Probably ran 60 miles per day as the previous post said. Their tiller rentals were faster than my ProV 1775 w/75HP Honda tiller. I was quite miffed when a 40HP Lund tiller passed my by (by about 1 mph). I talked to the guy there (?Dan) and he said those rentals are pretty darn light even though they are about 17'. Not very good in the rough stuff I'm sure....and Lac Seul can (did) get rough in a hurry. They are made by Lund for resorts and not available to the public (I guess). I think they had a live well and flat floor. I am not sure but it might have been called a 'Resorter'(?).
536985,Guest,2004-01-28 20:23:00,0,"No question about it, Lac Seul rockpiles are hard, but with a camp map you will be able to do just fine in the daylight. Remember, that time of year it'll be light from around 4:30 a.m. until 10:30 p.m. I assure you it won't take that long to catch your limit or run out of bait. Take your own boat, enjoy it, that's why you bought it and you carry insurance for the accident. After you've been there you will see there really isn't any reason to be out on the water after dark. Many of the camp operators start to get concerned if people aren't in by say 8:00 - 9:00 P.M. Some even have a policy that camp boats MUST be in by a certain time. I tell the people who think they have to stay out all hours, think of the poor saps (me included) who have to come looking for you when you get lost or break down or just don't come in for whatever reason. Now your actions have put alot of other people at risk. Didn't mean to make this post so long."
