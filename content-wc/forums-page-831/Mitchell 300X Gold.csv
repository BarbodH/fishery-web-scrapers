537108,Kip1,2004-02-03 07:14:00,17,"Last year I bought several reels to compare: a 308X Gold, a Tica Libra SA, and an Okuma Epixor. The Tica and the Okuma were in the same price bracket (<$70) while the 308XG was a bit cheaper at about $50. That's why I tried it. And yes, the 308 is smaller than the 300, but I thought you might find some value in my brief reply. The Tica is noticeably the nicest reel of this bunch, with the Okuma a close second. The 308XG is simply not as smooth and the drag is not in the same class either. I have also had some problems with line getting hung up in it as well. I use all three reels mostly for smally fishing in streams and I can tell you that rather than buy an X-Gold I'd save up an extra $10-$20 and get the Tica."
