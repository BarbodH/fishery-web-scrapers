537174,Guest,2004-02-06 06:50:00,0,"I have gone fishing to Manitoba for the last 18 years. Would not miss it for anything. I go over by Cranberry Portage(north of the The ""Pas"")and drive right to the lake. In Manitoba a person does not have to camp in a campground so we just camp out on an Island on the lake we go to. If you don't want to rough it you probally will wantto get ahold of a Resort on a lake. I would think that that Manitoba DNR would have something about resorts. The fishing has always been great!!!"
537178,Guest,2004-02-06 13:47:00,0,You looking for a drive in or fly in? Manitoba has some awesome fishing and anywhere you go north of Thompson should be great.
