WE WILL BE GOING THROUGH OGOKI FRONTIER OUTPOSTS, AND THE TIME OF YEAR WILL BE THE LAST WEEK IN JULY. WE WILL BE STAYING AT MOJIKIT LAKE SOUTH CAMP. I HEARD THAT THE WALLEYE AND NORTHERN FISHING IS TROPHY CALIBER, AND MOJIKIT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNDERATED LAKES IN ONTARIO! SAW A MESSAGE STATING THAT MOJIKIT IS LOADED WITH FALLEN TIMBER. HAS ANYONE OUT THERE FISHED THESE WATERS/RECENTLY? WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY MAPS AND TIPS FOR THIS PARTICULAR LAKE FOR BOTH WALLEYE/NOTRTHERN. LURES AND COLORS WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL. IF ANYONE HAS MAPS, PLEASE CONTACT ME. THANKS, AND HOPE YOUR UPCOMING YEAR IS FULL OF BIG FISH AND BIG FUN!!! MATT (CHICAGO)"
