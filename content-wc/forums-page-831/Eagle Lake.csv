He says that he finds sand bars and uses night crawlers on Lindy Rigs to catch his Walleyes. Eagle lake is Huge and wind can be an issue. There are, however, many places to fish in more protected areas. If you are not a Walleye fisherman, you can go after SM Bass, Northern Pike, Musky, lake Trout or Perch"

For numbers find a rock reef surrounded by deep water and jig with a minnow, crawler, or leech. We've had equal luck with the three. Good Luck."
