They all seem to work fine until the warranty runs out, except for Hummin Bird, they don't last that long. Bottom Line has a new locator called the 480 Max. Has anyone bought one yet? Any feedback? How about Bottom Line in general, I've never owned one. Do they make a quality product? Frankly, I'm getting tired of wasting my money on the rest. Any input would appreciated. Thanks in advance Bo"
