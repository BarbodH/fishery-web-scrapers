4113625,Iowa Hawkeye,2015-08-09 09:51:00,90,"Never priced a fly-in but our costs seem cheap compared to lodges. We really don't see many boats where we go, but a fly-in would be great for that reason. How many planes does it take to haul 40 cases of Molson lite????"
4115825,GGustaf,2015-08-10 08:46:00,8,Having done several fly-ins our group really prefers the houseboat trips mainly because we can bring everything but the kitchen sink along. This also means if we have our own boats which are setup for comfy fishing they are towed along. Either way it's an adventure.
4116353,tsquared,2015-08-10 12:05:00,57,"Fair question. We have done remote fly in, boat in and houseboat. I probably prefer the Fly In as I like the remoteness, but others preferred the houseboat as it balances the remoteness and the multi species fishing and does allow bringing your boat. We try to switch it up every year and evaluate the trip. They are all great and have their strong points."
6322956,musicman,2019-05-19 16:40:00,33,"And I enjoy being part of your group for all those years. Since I am now in AZ instead of MN, I have to add in airfare to MN first. In recent years when we have larger groups (10 - 11), the cost excluding airfare for me has been in the $900 - $1000 range. See you in a couple of weeks."
6323322,fishmanric,2019-05-20 16:21:00,219,"Last year we spent $610 a person for the houseboat, houseboat gas and pilot up and back. We pair the meals to five so two people are splitting the cost for one meal. Each is responsible for their liquor. So food isn't a big deal cost wise and liquor is all bought in the states and duty paid by each party. We also bring our own gas which helps keep costs down. All in all I'm thinking were right in the $800 per person range."
4108497,blewslb,2015-08-06 20:24:00,53,"Those of you that rent a houseboat, not mattering which company, what's is your average cost per person from portal to portal, all costs considered. Gas to and from, bait, rental of boat, meals, license, etc. Ours this year from Wisconsin, $1300.00. Just for knowledge to learn what we might or might not change. Thanks"
4108833,Knutson21,2015-08-07 05:38:00,348,"On lake of the woods we average between 900 and 950 each. This is for eveything except transportation to and from Canada. With 12 guys we are coming from 4 states eveyone is on there own for transportation, that doesnt get divided into the group."
4108881,tsquared,2015-08-07 06:13:00,57,"yeah, lac seul seems to run a little higher. We were at 1100 a couple years back, including fishing licenses, excluding gas for vehicles and excluding beer, etc. Our food is next to nothing as we eat fish every night."
4109049,Nav175,2015-08-07 07:16:00,1,"We were about $1300 also, that's total cost door to door. We also spend the night in Dryden on the way up and hire driver for the house boat."
4109097,jimirjr,2015-08-07 07:29:00,1149,"We spent about $1400 ea. for 6 Guys.. That includes Mini van rental from Denver; Gas for Van; 3 nites motel; food; booze; 3 rental boats at $510 per; gas for HB and rental boats; bait ( 3lbs leeches, 30 doz. minnows, flat of crawlers); licenses; Pilot cost + tip.... We don't skimp on stuff just to save a nickle.... Could have done it cheaper, BUT why?"
4109529,GGustaf,2015-08-07 09:21:00,8,Our group has been doing a houseboat on Lac Seul for 25 years and the cost pp has ranged from $450-1150. The past couple of years it has been right around $1100 incl a nite in Ft. Francis on the way up and all food and bait. Gas on trip up/back not included.
4111386,Iowa Hawkeye,2015-08-08 06:17:00,90,"We have gone about 13 years and this year was about $1300 each for eight people. This was door to door in Iowa and we don't skimp on anything, especially beer, bait, and food. This includes one hotel stay, the biggest houseboat with driver, and everything. You can't beat it for the money and location. Biggest issue is to plan for everything, because you don't want to forget anything, and you don't want to run out of bait and beer!! We rent a satellite phone for emergencies, but remember you are hours from help or a store."
4112410,Hawkfan,2015-08-08 14:20:00,237,"Kind of on topic, but mostly off topic...if it costs that much for a houseboat trip, why not go to a fly in outpost? We spent around that much money when you factored in food, plenty of beer and bait (Iowa Hawkeye guy, it was like I was reading my own post! ), but we had the remote setting where the only other cabin on the lake was 7 miles away so rarely saw anyone else, a full spacious cabin, dock system and the light fishing pressure on the lake. We go to Lac Seul now and have seen houseboats driving and parked. You might stay where the fish are, but others can get there too. I've looked at houseboat trips and I think I would love it if I did it, but then looking at the cost, it seems spendy to me."
4112770,jimirjr,2015-08-08 19:11:00,1149,"One MAJOR reason is the ""weight limitation""... Don't need to worry about any extra gear that You just can't live without... PLUS... Its FUN to pretend You're a PIRATE !!!"
4113138,Hawkfan,2015-08-08 23:11:00,237,"Our outfitter (s) didn't have a weight limit. Anything extra (more beer) came on a second flight, usually that day, or a check flight a couple days later. In fact with what we took, I would be worried about putting it all on a boat. Of course now that we drive it's even more. Can't forget to take something you might use once every 5 years! But you almost had me at pirate."
