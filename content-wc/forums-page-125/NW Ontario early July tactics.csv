6324562,UPnorth3,2019-05-24 07:43:00,22,What are your thoughts on hair jigs? Nice to have in the arsenal or waste of time?
6324672,prov1800,2019-05-24 10:33:00,5010,Snellgrove will treat you well.all of clarks outposts are fantastic wether you are a good fisherman or not.theu will give you a map for walleye and pike spots that will get you all the fish you want.wouldnt worry about trolling cranks and if you do make sure you have a short steel leader on or you might loose some lures.jig color makes absolutely no difference.my main jig color is black or unpainted.fish will be holding shallow in those northern lakes and will probably catch lots from the dock.lol.check there website they always post results cr√≤m what there guests week was like.interesting read you will pick up some tips.www.clarksresorts.com
6324702,UPnorth3,2019-05-24 12:04:00,22,What is the significance of the steel leader for trolling? Snags?

6324726,prov1800,2019-05-24 12:33:00,5010,Thx buss Pike have a tendency to take cranks when trolling and that can get expensive a small steel leader will save them.
6324752,UPnorth3,2019-05-24 13:03:00,22,"Gotcha. Thanks guys. Those **** toothy critters really piss me off - unless they are at 40""+"
6323366,UPnorth3,2019-05-20 19:14:00,22,"Dad and I will be at Snelgrove lake July 2-9. This will be our first non-Erie charter walleye experience. Been to a few fly-ins but always smallmouth and pike fishing. Looking for tips/techniques to use for walleye in early July. Or what sorts of patterns the fish should be in. Snelgrove looks to have several narrow shoots, and figured walleye could be found in the current.Thanks in advance."
6323548,jeffp,2019-05-21 08:35:00,2,"My dad and I have taken many trips in Ontario that time of year. Our plan is start the week with original Rapalas in orange, clown, or chartreuse in sizes 7-11. We add a split shot about 18"" in front to get it down a little. We troll in 8-12 ft of water. Once we find fish, we finish the week jigging salted minnows with 1/4 oz jigs. Favorite colors being White, yellow, orange and green."
6323628,UPnorth3,2019-05-21 10:53:00,22,Fortunately the outfitter supplies minnows a few times per week. But figured there had to be a more efficient way to find fish. But now I need to buy some Rapalas size 7-11 haha.
6323704,TitanD,2019-05-21 14:33:00,43,"About any time of year you can catch walleyes on jigs up North. I'm sure Snelgrove will be no different. If you search on here for Snelgrove you will see quite a lot of information about the lake and reports etc. Clarks do a great job and the minnows they provide is a great feature for a fly in. I personally prefer to fish 1/8oz jigs but with some moving water may need some 1/4 oz up to 3/8 oz jigs as well. I am an absolute HUGE fan of the glitter type jigs...........several colors including red, blue, chartreuse, silver and gold. GOLD is my #1 choice most of the time..........in either the glitter type and/or the gold plated jigs. I also prefer the red hooks on my jigs but probably doesn't make any difference but in my crazy mind. At any rate Gold, Gold, Gold. 1/8, 1/4, 3/8 oz. Good luck."
6323746,UPnorth3,2019-05-21 18:31:00,22,Just purchased some 1/4 and 3/8 jigs in multiple bright colors - no gold though. Sounds like gold will be my choice for 1/8. I typically buy the jigs from ebay. Do you have a favorite brand/seller of gold jigs?Do you vertically fish the jigs? Or bounce them along bottom? Any preference for paddle tail or curly?
6323770,TitanD,2019-05-21 19:43:00,43,"Vertical Jig, back troll. Wind and weather will generally dictate. Sometimes just running motor to hold over active fish with was slight movement across a hot spot will produce very well. It can be a little bumpy but fishing a point or bay where the winds is consistently blowing into is almost a guaranteed way to fill a stringer on a flyin lake. We like the gulp minnows but with live minnows provided not sure I would invest in a lot of artificial stuff. Cabelas sells gold plated jigs the last I checked.Good luck"
6324038,Mojo-NC,2019-05-22 13:31:00,1929,"You should be able to obtain a few locations to try first from your outfitter or the lodge management. Even a crude map with a few fish locations is a good place to start. Go to one of those places and check your electronics for depth and structure. Use a slightly different presentation from your boat partner until you find out what they want, be it a spinner rig, jig, or crankbait, even if the difference is only a different color, style, or blade type of a similar bait. Back trolling a spinner rig or a weighted crankbait is a good way to search for fish and cover water to find 'em. Once you find one fish, make a mental note of what you were using, how you caught it, and the conditions like depth, bottom structure, general location. Now start to dial in on the fish. Try a jig in your favorite color. Color doesn't matter as long as it is either chartreuse or gold (just kidding - those are my two favorites). Catch a few more, try a few slightly different colors, patterns, techniques and pay attention to the developing pattern. Change up from no tail, single curly tail, double curly tail, paddle tail, color, minnow, leech, crawler, etc. Easy peasy. I use 1/4 and 3/8 ounce jigs with long-shank hooks from Northland Tackle mostly. You can use a short shank hook if you aren't using a tail. The gold metallic jigs are considerably more expensive than normal jigs and cost about $1 each but they work really well. I had everyone in my group wanting one. My son and I went to an outpost lake we had never been to last year and caught about 80 walleyes in 4 hours using the technique I summarized directly above. Once we found 'em, we dialed in and caught one after another. If you find a location but it's too windy to stay on it, don't be afraid to go directly into the wind and drop your anchor. Let out enough rope to put you back on the spot and jig 'em up. If the bite slows down, move around a bit. Once you find the fish in one location, look for other similar locations around the lake. Good luck and tight lines!"
6324514,UPnorth3,2019-05-24 06:27:00,22,"Mojo, big thanks for this info. I am going to write this down and keep it handy while out on the lake."
6324544,lawson2343,2019-05-24 07:14:00,459,X2 on what Mojo said and I would just add one color to that - orange. That is my go to start of the day color in stained water. Last season I was kicking my boat partners rear end when I asked him why he didn't switch to orange. He said he didn't have any! I gave him some and then we were fish for fish. Guess who will have a tackle box full or orange this year? Good luck.
6324546,lawson2343,2019-05-24 07:16:00,459,"BTW, I was using orange spinners."
