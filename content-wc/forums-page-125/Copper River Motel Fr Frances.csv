Anybody been there since the change to Copper River? How is the free breakfast? We enjoy taking in a beer or two, how is the bar. The last time we stayed there the bar had gone to **** and the service was bad so started staying at the Super 8 and going to the Boston Pizza joint for a beer. Boston Pizza was ok but over priced. Just wondering what if we will be happy with the Copper River updates."

We liked just walking down the hall to eat dinner in the restaurant. Same can be said for the bar (serves dinner too). Same for the large breakfast buffer before resuming the drive."
6322576,camp chef,2019-05-18 10:48:00,915,We were scheduled to stay there last year but the remodel on the taproom was not completed so we switched to La place Rendezvous and are staying there Thursday night again on our Way to the the Winnipeg river. I have heard only good things about The Copper River.It looks very nice on their website.
6322656,NARDA 1,2019-05-18 14:57:00,636,Stayed there in September last year and booked for this year when we left. Food was very good as was the bar and breakfast. Staff was very personable. They remodeled the rooms over the winter.

The remodel job to the room was pretty poor, especially considering the price payed for the room. I will say that it was clean and the staff was very accommodating."
6322866,NARDA 1,2019-05-19 11:36:00,636,The rooms were remodeled just this past winter. Here's a link to some after remodel pictures.https://www.facebook.com/copperriver...type=3&theater

Walked over to Boston's to eat, and finished the evening back at the hotel bar. Breakfast was great. Will be repeating all of the above this Friday. Safe travels to all."
