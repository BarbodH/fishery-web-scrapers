Once I sharpen them and take the plating off, the hook points just corrode down to a nub. I usually switch my spoons to a single hook and rip it out of the weeds when necessary."

6322992,Ltrain,2019-05-19 17:50:00,4145,"Now that looks like a good bait, off to ebay i go"
6322996,bthomas3333,2019-05-19 18:07:00,465,Harris Sports mail out of the UK I believe carry them too. Often offer free shipping too. Usually takes 2 weeks to the US. I prefer the largest size which is around 4in. The mid-size is around 3in and is a bit easier to find.Brett
6322998,Ltrain,2019-05-19 18:12:00,4145,"****, they have a 4 inch? I only seen the 3 inch so that's what i ordered. Oh well they should work, hope so, they weren't cheap."
6323148,bthomas3333,2019-05-20 08:09:00,465,UGH! Sorry I didn't do this in the first place. Here is the source for the 10CM~4in Rapala Weedless spoons Scroll way down to bottom of the page to find the largest ones. I actually like the colors in the 3in rattling version better but like the size of this model better. Anyway. I have ordered from these guys too. Same deal about 2 weeks to get.https://www.lureshop.eu/rapala/minno...-weedless.htmlBrett
