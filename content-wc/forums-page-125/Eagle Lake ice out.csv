6318302,rosh1,2019-05-06 06:51:00,275,I was on the bridge at narrows and no ice to be seen. Ice in outlet bay 200 yards from shore and can see it piled up on rock 1&2. It wont be long now!

6322034,lazermule,2019-05-16 15:14:00,86,"I will be at Temple Bay 5/29-6/2. Looking forward to it, this will be my first time on Eagle lake. LM"
6324000,Donic,2019-05-22 11:22:00,3,"Do you, or anyone else, know if this 2019 ice out is sooner, or later, than average? How does it compare to last year (my first time on Eagle lake). Also, are water levels up, or down, compared to 1) 2018 and/or 2) an average year. I was up the first week of June in 2018. Will be up the 2nd week in June this year. Did not try for Lake trout nor smallies last year - think I'd like to give it a go this year. Any idea if lake trout will still be roaming everywhere, rather shallow, or if the water will be above 52 degrees and the trout found deeper? Best wishes and best of fisherman's luck."
6324070,v-bay gord,2019-05-22 15:34:00,3168,"Donic ..you could check out our blog http://vermilionbaylodge.com/blog/ for this year's ice out date and go back in the archives to compare previous years. It's been a colder spring so anything is possible in terms of trout, but I'm thinking 2nd week of June might be a bit warm for shallow trout... .but they won't be deep."
6324346,Donic,2019-05-23 13:36:00,3,"Very good. Thanks! And I enjoyed all of the tips posted on your page, by species - very helpful. I had great luck with Muskies and Pike the first week of June last year (2018). But struggled a bit with the walleyes, had very few smallies, and no trout. I wold really like to get a lot of action on all of them. This year I've ordered a lake map of Eagle lake - I'm not that great with the depth finder, in terms of finding humps and reefs. Hopefully the map will help. And I'm thinking I've got a better game plan this year, as it won't be a completely new lake this time."
