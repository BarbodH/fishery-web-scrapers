6322268,TitanD,2019-05-17 08:47:00,43,Talk about last minute Assuming that means they will be getting guests to their destinations provided they are ice free? I know my outfitter canceled at least 2 groups earlier this week due to ice at the plane base.Hoping they get everyone headed that way into their lakes. Pike should be ready and waiting!!!!Good luck.
6322400,vteye3,2019-05-17 14:30:00,496,Satelite was showing ice on many of the lakes North of Nakina on Weds. It can go quick but glad I am flying-in June 7th.

6323188,vteye3,2019-05-20 09:27:00,496,"We are flying into Kayedon, short hop out of Cordingly and thinking ice has gone out. Satelite mapping is cloudy but see clear lakes NW of Nipigon that were frozen mid last week. Looks promising just have to survive the inlaws coming in tomorrow, sons wedding this weekend, open house at our home an then ""the"" drive."
