Presently 1165 above sea level, which is the 50th percentile, meaning historically at this time of the year, half the time it's higher, half the time its lower. It's on the rise now, and they're reducing the outflow. I'll be there in 3 weeks, and I'd consider the elevation right now to be on track for this point in the year. FYI, in mid June, I'm looking for 1167. I believe the map chips are calibrated on 1170 as a baseline."
