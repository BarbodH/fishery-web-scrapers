I'm not finding a lot of information about this area, but it's expansive so hoping to get advice on where to focus at this time of year, and conversely what type of water to generally eliminate.I am hearing the water clarity is naturally dingy so assuming brighter colors (chartreuse, orange, pink) work best for eyes?Also seeing a wider range of species than accustomed to seeing at other lakes in Ontario. I know the outfitter has promised to share some spots to fish, but hoping to connect with someone who has established their own patterns.Thanks in advance!"
