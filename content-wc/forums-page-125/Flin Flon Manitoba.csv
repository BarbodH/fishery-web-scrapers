My buddy that is also going asked me if the automatic inflating life vests were legal in Manitoba , hoping someone knows .Also wanted to know if there are ATMs available and can you use cards from the U S . Thank You . O - R"
6323700,TitanD,2019-05-21 14:24:00,43,"Not sure about your specific question but can tell you some outfitters/lodges accept credit cards and others do not. If they do sometimes they add on a 3-4% surcharge for using the cards to cover their costs (technically not supposed to do that but they do it). I would confirm if they accept or don't accept. The great thing about using cards in Canada is the bank automatically does the conversion for everything so you can ensure you are always getting the right conversion on your dollar. Finally, I would strongly suggest you (everyone that travels to Canada from the states) contact their credit card/debit card providers and let them know you are traveling and create what some in the industry call your ""travel plan"".........this will ensure they don't decline your credit card and/or atm while traveling out of state, country etc. Generally if charging/usage activity falls outside of your normal geographic locale it is likely to get declined. Much easier to be pro-active and set up your travel plan. Just call the toll free numbers on the back of your credit card and atm card to share with them your dates of travel and details. Yes, I work for a financial institution and specifically in the card industry for many, many years. Good luck."
