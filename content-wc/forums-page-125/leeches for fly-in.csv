6324014,cnewcomer,2019-05-22 12:46:00,4,Flying into Trout Lake in early June. Can anyone recommend a good spot to stop on way to Red Lake or in Red Lake to get leeches? Thanks in advance
6324048,olderfart,2019-05-22 14:09:00,18,TJ's Quik Stop on the right as you come into Red Lake has them...you may want to preorder to make sure they will have the size and quantity on hand...they open early do you could pick them up before you fly...their # is 1-807-727-2752
6324058,olderfart,2019-05-22 14:27:00,18,"Just for your info, we were informed that Red Lake Marine is the only place now in Red Lake that sells fishing licenses (besides online)...we're planning on stopping at Great Bear store right after you go through Ft Francis on the way to 502 to get ours in case of any problem in Red Lake...had an incident a few years ago when all the license computer lines were not working in Red Lake the morning we were flying out...luckily they came back up about 15 minutes before our fly time...don't want to go through that again!!!!!"
