It brought back tons of memories about my Dad and all are fishing trips to Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Canada that we went together. Everyone on Walleye Cantral should read this excellent book To Bill if you are reading this posting ,Have you finished your latest book yet? And if so when do you anticipated its release? Thanks Again for reviving all the great fishing memories with my Dad. Have a great Fishing trip this Year to Canada Take Care Larry S"

I started my second book several years ago, but have not gotten much past about 1/3 done. The previous publisher has been bought out with the result being a halt in royalties for past authors. A few books are available by contacting me, thanks for the kind words. Bill"
