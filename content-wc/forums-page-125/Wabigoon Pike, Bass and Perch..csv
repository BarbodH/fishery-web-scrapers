Water is still chilly, with the highest surface temp being 54â„‰. Bass and Pike are aggressive at the moment, preferring large swimbaits and spinnerbaits over live baits. Perch are where they should be but bite is slow. A*week or so and the crappie should move in which is a bonus, but there are plenty of in season fish biting without the crappie and walleye.VIDEOShttps://youtu.be/D3GxbvbRJxshttps://youtu.be/M9RHPhEswpQ"
