6324520,skap,2019-05-24 06:35:00,58,I will second the previous recommendation of Winoga Lodge in Sioux Lookout. Been going there 20 plus years and its the prefect drive to spot. Easy to get to and great fishing. Lodge is on an island so it makes for a great experience. Good luck!
6322910,Poutwhacker,2019-05-19 13:30:00,4,"Looking for recommendations for a ""drive to"" destination, either in NW Ontario, Northern Manitoba or even Saskatchewan. It would be my wife and me. We live in Northern Minnesota and run a newer 19' Skeeter. We are outdoors people, so it could be a campgrounds (tenting) or a lodge (preferred). Target species would be walleye, pike and lake trout. Time would be 3rd week of June. We are retired, so drive time isn't really that big of a big issue. It doesn't need to be fancy, just clean, safe and near good fishing. Thanks"
6322920,Steve H,2019-05-19 13:46:00,3,"I have had a great trip every time I've gone to Goose Bay Camp. https://www.lacseul.com Andrea runs a good place, nothing fancy but good. You have to cook your own food. They have cabins with everything you would expect. We don't bring boats so we do the package deal where you pay per person per day for cabin, boat, motor, gas, and minnows. With your own boat you can just rent a cabin or tent camp. I personal would do the cabin. Andrea will give you a map and mark spots on it get you started. You will catch Walleye, Northern and Smallmouth Bass. I think there are Lake Trout but we have never fished for them. South of the camp there are Musky. We have also caught perch. Without Lake Trout this might not be what you're looking for but at least one suggestion. We drive up Friday and I can give a report after our trip. Steve Captain of boat #1"

6324166,pjshorthorn,2019-05-23 04:08:00,5654,"Going to V-Bay Lodge on June 15th-22nd with three other rascals. We will be hunting for big pike and Muskie, scaring up some walleye,smallmouth and perch with hopefully a lake trout here and there as an added bonus. Taking a day fly-in trip to Zizania Lake through Clark's Resort for trophy pike and walleye. This place is a great and relaxing lodge with beautiful grounds and an amazing amount of water to explore for all of the major species. And of course, there is Uncle Gord to play with if your day hasn't been entertaining enough PjShorthorn"
6324168,pjshorthorn,2019-05-23 04:11:00,5654,I've always wondered about this lodge. I drove past the turn off road going to it when I went to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake. PjShorthorn
