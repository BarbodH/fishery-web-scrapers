6318154,HeHooksHimself,2019-05-05 14:36:00,725,"We used Twin Lakes Outfitters and flew into Tennant Lake. Chad was easy to work with and very reasonable. We actually had to go Kap Lake for fish, but we caught plenty."
6324234,BHughes,2019-05-23 08:15:00,5,"Highly recommend Twin Lakes Air (twin-lakes-air.com). Flew in to Abamasagi last year late June. Returning this year 2nd week of July. 7 man crew last year caught over 1,000 walleyes total. Some pike too, but not targeting them. TW has 20 cabins of 17 different lakes."

6287180,Juls,2019-02-07 02:39:00,13414,"We've been going here for several years.... http://www.metalakelodgefishing.comWhile we target pike, we always catch a bunch of walleye by accident too. I highly recommend John and Cheryl's place. Great people and great staff! You can fish Meta Lake, Ara Lake, or Brace Lake from their central location on the lake. They have outpost camps/cabins too, so you can have an entire island to yourself."
6287184,Bstar,2019-02-07 03:30:00,564,"Try Boreal Forest outfitters Melchett Lake outpost. Nice people and camp. Went there last September and caught over 1100 fish. Big was 26"". https://www.borealforestoutfitters.com/"
6287358,oleJoe,2019-02-07 13:27:00,114,Twin lakes outfitters has numerous lakes. From big to small.
6287656,onetimedave,2019-02-08 11:13:00,502,Look at brace lake. This lake gives you several bodies of water you can fish. Brace lake outfitters
6287758,Ruddiger,2019-02-08 15:49:00,649,"Howdy, I highly recommend Nagagami lake out of Hornepayne. Contact Expeditions North as they are the best outfitter on the lake. Amazing pike and walleye fishing, and closer than Nakina too. Take care, Ruddiger"
6288034,gordy28,2019-02-09 17:57:00,437,I would highly recommend Ogoki Lake with Ogoki Lake outfitters. We went this past August and loved it. Good numbers lake w great average size w a shot at big walleye and pike I did a pretty long write up here https://www.canadafishingguide.net/f...ek-ogoki-lake/CheersGordy
6288082,adempsey2.0,2019-02-09 21:14:00,611,"Lots of good options posted already. Couple more:Air-Dale (from Wawa) Little Miss, Nameigos LakesTwin Lakes Kagianagami, Abamasagi LakesDeep Wilderness Peninsular, Studd LakesNakina North Outfitters Percy LakeSeven Lakes Wilderness Camps Marshall, Kap LakesBauers North Outpost on Onaman Lake"
6317916,Dymes,2019-05-04 16:18:00,13,"I always Recomend Bauer's on Onaman. You with catch 100 of walleye. Most will be over 20Â”. Leuenberger's flies to a ton of lakes. They have great planes and feel safe. I would contact both of these locations through call, Facebook, or email to get a hold of them. I don't not believe you will disappointed with either outfitter."
6317934,TitanD,2019-05-04 18:42:00,43,Eddies North has a few options as well and flies out of Nakina. We are going to Beteau Lake this year which is not known to be a big numbers place but I think Richter and Windsor offer big numbers + opportunities for big Pike. Whatever you decide good luck and enjoy!
