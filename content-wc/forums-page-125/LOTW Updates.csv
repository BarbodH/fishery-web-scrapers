6323744,Thompmd,2019-05-21 18:09:00,320,Maybe I missed but I assume the ice has left and wondered if there were any current updates. We are heading to Sioux Narrows on June 7.
6323820,tandm,2019-05-21 21:12:00,679,The resort I go to near Sioux Lookout reported everything open on Lac Seul last week. I would say you'll be in good shape.
6323826,martinbns,2019-05-21 21:27:00,1520,"Ice officially out May 14th on LOTW, we were out about 20 miles west of Sioux Narrows. Fishing Monday was decent but opening day is never the best. By June 7th the fish should be on humps in numbers."
6323834,Thompmd,2019-05-21 22:06:00,320,"Thanks for the update, btw when is your trip with Gussy?We were in Sturgeon Bay last week fishing for smallmouth and I was checking the weather in Sioux Narrows and it seemed warmer than normal?"
6323858,martinbns,2019-05-22 05:39:00,1520,"Cooler than normal, it was looking like an earlier ice out but spring was cool. We are out with Gussy June 5,6, can't wait."
6323862,Thompmd,2019-05-22 06:14:00,320,Thanks and I would be excited too. Are you going for bass or walleye? Good luck and I'd love to hear how it went sometime. Be safe
6324146,martinbns,2019-05-22 21:26:00,1520,"Primarily Bass, but we have to eat so at least enough walleye for a shore lunch"
6324154,Lmbkiller,2019-05-22 22:22:00,639,U HAVE to eat and your bass fishing so why do u HAVE to get some walleyes? What is wrong with bass?
6324180,martinbns,2019-05-23 05:41:00,1520,"Nothing wrong with bass, but a typical shorelunch is walleye and it's not too hard to catch enough for three people. I will leave that up to Jeff. I am really hoping to learn some new jig type techniques for bass and how to better find them. Won't be all that hard to find them as they will be actively spawning at the time."
