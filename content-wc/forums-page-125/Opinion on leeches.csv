6322806,Mojo-NC,2019-05-19 08:39:00,1929,"One year we fished opening week only a few days after ice-out and the walleyes were still pre-spawn. The bite was very subtle that week and we caught big females as they made their way up to their spawning area. We positioned our boats up on a flat near the river inlet and slowly pulled spinner rigs up a slope. That year the fish preferred leeches over minnows and live leeches outfished Gulp leeches about 10-1. We've also used them off and on over other years and everything catches fish when fished properly. I can't say they caught more fish but they are tough little buggers and don't come off the hooks very easily, so that's a plus. Smallies love 'em too."
6322824,Daddybigfins,2019-05-19 09:25:00,484,"Last June we spot locked on top of some underwater humps on Ft. Peck and were using leeches and minnows. Three of us using slip bobbers and dead sticking knocked the **** out of a bunch of smallies and walleye. We found no difference in the bite between minnows and leeches, even though we witnessed the fish chasing cisco around. Some of the cisco jumped out of the water trying to evade the smallmouth. That was a stellar day!"
6323370,Aspencreek,2019-05-20 19:24:00,2911,"I will fish Minnows, leeches and crawlers with about the same frequency during the week on Lac Seul. Now we go up early July, so the fish are where they want to be and the weed lines are defined and temps are stable but climbing. Results from our trips have told us that having all 3 in your arsenal of baits can be beneficial. When 1 slows down switching to another can create reactions by the fish. In other words, mixing it up can do the trick. I will jig, backtroll, slip-bobber, and lindy all in 1 day and depending upon location, structure, bottom, wind and gut feeling with all 3. But some days the minnows will be hot, another crawlers, and another leeches. There is no magic bullet, being able to change things up makes all the difference. My buddy went up with his brother last year and all they did was jig, if that's all I could do I would swim back to camp, or the other guy was goin in!!! All of these tactics work, that's why it's called fishing and not catching!"
6322294,Jahloaf,2019-05-17 09:40:00,74,"I've used leeches off an on over the years without overwhelming success, has anybody used them with great success and what was your method of presentation. I've tried on slip bobber, on a jig and trolling with floating snell and will admit the best was using a slip bobber. Debating about trying a couple dozen again this year. My best bait has always been minnows, live or dead or frozen. Live on a plain unpainted jig head has been unbeatable but always liked the durability of a leech."
6322304,Flyinghappy,2019-05-17 10:08:00,215,"I always had the best luck with leaches by using a bare hook with a split shot about 12"" up and slowly dragging it along the bottom off a drop off. Other way I have used most is the slip bobber. Mostly did this on my home lake in Chetek, WI. So shallower lake."
6322326,TitanD,2019-05-17 11:02:00,43,I prefer minnows and if no minnows plastics before leeches generally. Just don't like messing with them on fly-in trips if we don't have to (and don't have to is more common that not). We are fishing all artificial this year on our trip due to some weight limitations and outfitter really does not have a good storage facility for minnows. Some of the outfitters do provide minnows as part of their package which I REALLY like but they are few and far between. I will say this about leeches..........they (and crawlers) seem to be more of a Summer presentation bait. Minnows are really good anytime but have had success using leeches as the water temps rise. Sort of makes sense I guess as leeches probably don't become available until things start to warm a bit but I'm not 100% sure about that but thinking it is sort of a match the hatch exercise. Good luck.
6322332,camp chef,2019-05-17 11:23:00,915,We have used leeches on and off through the years. We don't buy them anymore because crawlers and plastics are way easier and equally effective. I would have no problem using them if they were my only option.
6322356,stumcfar,2019-05-17 12:07:00,451,"We stayed at an outpost camp on Lac Seul a few years back. We didn't take enough minnows with and ran out early in the trip. We finished the trip using the leeches we had brought with. We found out that we caught far less fish with leeches but the quality of fish was better. The numbers of smaller fish caught with minnows were not caught on the leeches, so when you hooked one, you knew it was a pretty decent fish."
6322384,the_bronco,2019-05-17 13:31:00,86,"We fished a very hot week in Canada last year, mid June, some of you will remember, mid to upper 90's, when the week was over the camp owner apologized for the slow fishing, no one in our camp or in the surrounding area caught much for fish, we did not know what he was talking about, although not our best year, we caught fish and a good share of them...all with leeches. Come to find out, no one else in camp were using leeches. It is the bait of choice in our group of twelve. 1/4 oz jig (sometimes 1/8, depending on depth), just off of the bottom,(Perch colored fireball) jigged slightly, lot of times we will just drag the jig on bottom. Yes, we have used crawlers and minnows, but always go back to leeches. We are picky on our leeches, they must be big and lively...gotta kept them cold, at least cool, and they have a swimming action walleyes can't seem to ignore. If it does slow down a bit, I will go to a lindy rig, my PB 31"" on this."
6322408,Rock Hound,2019-05-17 14:43:00,51,"Leeches are a tremendous bait. If you can buy them in the store, the fish will eat them! - they are not just a mid summer bait (they are excellent in the spring, and incredible in the fall *if you can still find them). You need to keep them cold and change the water on them, but they have a tremendous action on jig or hook, and some times you can catch two or three fish prior to baiting up again. *Leeches are one of the easiest baits to take care of, but you must keep them cold / cool (and don't dip your hand into the leech bag with bug spray or sunscreen on them). Use them with a bare jig, or lindy rig, or if you are a plastics person, try tipping your jig and plastics with a leech . . . you will be impressed. They are one of the best bobber baits you can find, but don't be afraid to fish them more aggressively, particularly if you are a jig fisherman! Regardless if it is in the Mississippi River, Minnesota or Canadian Lakes, I always have leeches in the boat. Give them a try!"
6322512,Daddybigfins,2019-05-18 05:43:00,484,I find leeches much easier to keep on a long weekend or week long trip. No separate aerated container necessary. Just keep them in your cooler with food and beverage. Minnows work great but are a PITA to keep alive. Slip bobbers are my favorite way to fish them. IMO fish can't pass up a squirming leech
6322734,tv4fish,2019-05-19 05:54:00,2694,"FWIW: We use both leeches and crawlers in Canada - kind of a ""contest"" to see what is working better day to day. If you hook the leech through its sucker end on a small jig (1/4 oz.) and do vertical jigging while drifting over a hot spot (like we do), it seems to ""stretch out"" better and be more attractive to the fish. Leeches are tough and we can re-use them to catch more than one fish - crawlers - not so much........"
6322792,andreindy,2019-05-19 08:15:00,308,"We have one big fishing trip a year, a fly-in mid-July, and my mental state is most at ease when I am prepared with a splattering of options and alternatives (crawlers, salted minnows, plastics, etc). I am considering a limited supply of leeches...for some fellas whose greatest comfort is using a slip bobber. I am passing through the Nipigon area to Nakina...looking for bait shops where I can pre-order. Any suggestions? I think I found one place that has them for CND $5 a dozen?"
