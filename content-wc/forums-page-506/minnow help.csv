1267123,Guest,2011-02-01 15:05:00,0,"Hi Larry,I use to go with my brother to, but he got to be a real pain, LOL I quit going with him when we bought our own boat and the kids were ready for fishing. That was about 25 yrs ago. Now the boys have got me going back again. They took me up to Hawk junction to flyin with Air Dale for fathers day in 06. This is our 6th trip now and are moving up to Nakina. We have been going with White River air for the last 4 yrs. Taking the same path that we did back in the 60's with Tim. Hear you are going to Red Lake again ??? Have fun"
1267170,Larry S,2011-02-01 17:27:00,666,"Ted, I haven't gone fishing with your brother since 2008.I hear that he is going on a trip for the 2nd year in a row to a fly-in out of Red Lake with Dan Whealan. Haven't firmed up a trip yet to Canada this year . I am going with a friend to Minnesota the first week of June. Hope you and your sons have a great trip and catch lots of fish! Larry S"
1265766,Guest,2011-01-28 15:14:00,0,"Hey guys, I've seen where you can preserve your own minnows for the trip to Can. My three boys and I are going to Nakina this year with leuenbergers to Kayedon lake. Can some one give me the recipe for the process to salt minnows. We take lots of crawlers and they work great to but would like to compare. Thanks for any help !!!! Ted"
1265794,Bill Krejca,2011-01-28 16:19:00,6107,"After trying a half dozen different ways, I now put 30-40 live minnows in a plastic zip bag and add enough non iodized or picking salt to the bag to cover the minnows, shake to distribute the salt, and put in the freezer. I have had better success using this method than with Borax or other ingredients. If the bait is very large, such as chubs, first add enough salt to the water they are in to kill them, otherwise the guts will tear out while using them. Then proceed with salt in the bag. Bill"
1265894,MorganMan,2011-01-29 08:04:00,341,"I have taken salted minnows in the past, but have found them to get so softy and mushy that they don't stay on the hook as well. Is there something I am doing wrong or something I can do to prevent them from becoming fish paste?"
1265899,Bill Krejca,2011-01-29 08:15:00,6107,"I have used salted minnows, as prepared above, for up to 3 trips to the lake, and they remain quite usable. I suspect putting them into the bag while they are still alive may be key. They are, or course, returned to the freezer in between fishing times. Bill"
1265936,Bigstorm,2011-01-29 09:59:00,799,"I always take 15 to 20doz salted minnows when I go for a week long trip. I usually layer them in the quart size freezer bags.add 1/2"" of salt at the bottom of the empty bagadd 2 doz minnows (live)add 1"" of saltseal bag and shake so all minnows are coveredadd 1/2"" lay of salt on top and repeat the processWhen I'm done with 1 bag, it usually has around 10doz in it with close to 1lb of salt, then I freeze it until I go fishing.The minnows almost get a little leathery, but seem to work just fine and will outlast a live minnow on my jig by far. They stay in the boat unitl the bag is empty too - I dont refreeze each night. It doesnt seem to make a difference"
1265998,Gavorlake,2011-01-29 12:41:00,33,"You're flying in fishing,and worring about the cost of minnows ?????Like going to Florida and bringing your own oranges from home"
1266989,Manitou,2011-02-01 09:07:00,125,Yah last time I checked we do have some bait up here.Heck you can buy salted shiners at Safeway.Salted minnows are very popular in Manitoba.Practically non-existent across the boarder in Kenora ON.
1267012,dkrusin,2011-02-01 10:16:00,97,"We usually do 20 dozen at a time or more. Put ice in the water to make the minnows active, then dump in a cup of canning salt. This will purge the minnows and get some salt in there inside. After about an hour put them on paper towels and partially dry. Then cover them with canning salt for about and hour and a half. ( I usually layer them in a plastic bucket). Rinse off the salt in the water you purged them in and back on the paper towel until they are dry. Put a dozen on a folded paper towel the size of a zip lock and put them in the freezer.It is a little work, but the minnows are excellent, no BS. This receipe came from Lake Michigan Angler."
1267028,Larry S,2011-02-01 10:42:00,666,"Ted, use the search feature on this site. I put in salted minnows and got 143 postings I also have fished in Canada with your brother Tim and Dan Whealan. have a good trip wherever you go this year Larry S"
