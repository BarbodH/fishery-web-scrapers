1266021,515,2011-01-29 14:14:00,254,I'm thinking of hitting the Provincial Park in the last part of May or first part of June and looking for information on the lake. Hoping to catch some walleyes. Has anyone ever fished the lake and will it be worth the 12 hr drive? Any help will be appreciated. Thanks Mike
