1265356,Millerdog,2011-01-27 09:50:00,41,My son and me are looking to rent a cabin on Lake of the Woods. Something rustic with a private setting and we would do our own cooking. It needs to have a good boat launch and accept my labradors. We would like it May longweekend into that week. Thanks

1267304,JDP,2011-02-02 08:21:00,1457,I have been to the Northwest Angle in 1990's early 2000s a few times. There a re a number of different resorts.I do believe though you will need your Passport/PassCard as you actually leave the U.S. enter Manitoba and then back into the U.S. at the Northwest Angle. The Angle is a very cool place to visit!Search the Internet and the resorts will pop up!
