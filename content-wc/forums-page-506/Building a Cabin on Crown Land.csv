1266992,Manitou,2011-02-01 09:19:00,125,"The facts:Quote: If you are a non-resident of Canada, 18 years of age or older and wish to camp on Crown land north of the French and Mattawa rivers, a Crown Land Camping Permit is required, unless:You are a non-resident that is 18 years of age or older and are renting a camping unit (a camping unit can include a tent, trailer, tent-trailer, recreational vehicle or camperback) from a commercial outfitter in Ontario.You are a non-resident that is staying on a watercraft equipped for overnight accommodation, anchored on a Crown land water bed and not located within a regulated (green) zone or other signed prohibited area.You or your spouse owns property in Ontario - NOTE: access to regulated (green) zones remains prohibited.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_170045.html"
534730,Guest,2003-08-31 20:44:00,0,"Have been going to different areas on Ontario for many years, and do not consider the question ""dumb"". It depends on what you define as a permanant structure. I can't count the number of times we've seen pole frames that people have put up & thrown a tarp over during their stay. When they leave they usually (not always) take the tarp down, but the pole frame remains. I've seen these from north of Pickle Lake to Wawa to Atikokan. It occurs to me that these frames, being made from wood cut right on site (also illegal if you want to split hairs), aren't obvious to flying MNR guys checking for such things, so they remain there year after year. And yes, I'm certain that some, if not most, were erected by non residents."
534731,Guest,2003-08-31 20:50:00,0,"Here in the U.P. of Michigan, it's not uncommon for for whoever feels like it to throw up a shack or park a dilapidated trailer camper on US Forest land and just leave it there to use during hunting season year after year. What difference does it make if it's U S citizens or not - and what difference does it make for Canadians if it's Canadian citizens or not? An eyesore is an eyesore. And, I hate to sound racist, but look at how the First Nations people trash the bush."
534732,Guest,2003-08-31 21:25:00,0,"The trashing in the bush is done by Americans, Canadians, Natives. I guess they think their mother is coming along behind them to pick up. It personally makes me sick. It takes no effort to pick up your trash and put it in a bag and take it to a dumpster."
1265124,Mike Borger,2011-01-26 16:24:00,1554,You dredged up an 8 year old post to say that?I apologize on behalf of all Canadians for this halfwit.Just unreal.
1265133,Freytown,2011-01-26 16:34:00,770,"No need to apologize as ""halfwits"" reside on both sides of the border. It's the internet...maybe just the sad feature of the internet."

1265205,Yellow Fever,2011-01-26 19:17:00,1809,"I would like to know who the Nipigon Kid is as I lived there for 7 years, did a heck of a lot of fishing on the river and South bay. And I still have a lot of real good freinds there as well. I worked for Bell Canada. Just an awesome place to live"
1265314,fishman10,2011-01-27 07:45:00,226,"man are you funny. do you have a bottle in front of you, or are you going for a frontal labotamy?"
1265320,tv4fish,2011-01-27 08:02:00,2694,"This thread reminds me ---- Any of you know the history of a green-roofed shelter that is up close to Picnic Bay (on Lac Seul)? Years ago, that shelter was used by my buddy and I as we were caught in a nasty thunder storm. We were sure glad it was there. We were told that it might have been used/constructed by Boy Scouts or a similar organization? It's almost hidden now, but we still check to see if it's there on every trip - in case we get caught again."
1266730,bobbylfishermon,2011-01-31 13:42:00,241,"By the way, you can't even camp on Crown land without a permit, and the fine is for everyone in the PARTY , five guys, five fines !!!! To the tune of you could have stayed at a resort, expensive fines, and that is just for camping my friend!!!"
534646,Thumper,2003-08-26 13:31:00,133,I hear that they build cabins in the Ohio state forests all the time... to run their 'stills in! :)
534648,Guest,2003-08-26 14:43:00,0,"All of your points are well taken. I too thought this was probably a bad idea, but I just wanted some reasoning to show my buddies. Where I'm from there is little state land to even consider such things."
534653,Guest,2003-08-26 18:53:00,0,"No Harm Tex, They don't let us build them either!"
534654,hoosiercanadian,2003-08-26 21:47:00,104,"Another good site to find property is www.norealtyfee.com , I have a cabin listed on there in the Lynn Lake area of Manitoba, fully furnished,road access, only cottage on the lake, the lake it is on has excellent walleye, it is surrounded by numerous other good fishing lakes, for the price of an s.u.v.. There are 20 pictures of it to veiw. Didn't really want to use this board to advertise, but it seems alot of people want to buy, but don't know where to look. Another good place to look is in the classifieds of local newspapers, you can pull up many right here on the internet. Go to www.justfishontario and you can pull up the Kenora, Dryden, Fort Francis, and Sioux Lookout papers. Search on yahoo and you can pull up many more."
534656,Guest,2003-08-27 09:38:00,0,"#1 -Everybody in the first several responses is assuming the poster is a US citizen.(Personally, I don't think so) #2- This looks like a classic ""trolling"" pattern..and it is getting many bites. When a post appears this dumb..somebody usually has their tongue in their cheek."
534657,Guest,2003-08-27 09:51:00,0,From what I have seen down there you could doit and no one would say a thing. It would probably improve the area.
534658,Guest,2003-08-27 09:57:00,0,As I have fished the lac saul area in a number of different places i have abandoned shacks and little places that look like they have been there for a lot longer than the 20 years I was going there. someone built them and they have not been torn down.
534661,Guest,2003-08-27 12:00:00,0,"I definitely was trolling for opinions and the question was a little out there, but I can verify that it was a serious inquiry. To clarify, we are avid fisherman, having gone to Ontario over 30 times in the last 15 years. We are not cheap. This year our group plopped down over $5K canadian on various fly-in trips. We are adventurous (many of our trips have been exploratory drive-ins checking out new lakes). We are not hillbillies, I run a consulting firm and two of my buddies include a physician and a lawyer. Also to clarify, our great lake is pike only. We wouldn't dream of such an undertaking on a walleye lake mainly because you would never find one all to yourself. This lake, however, is 40 minutes from the nearest town and a half mile from the nearest maintained logging road. We occasionally clear the old logging path to the lake with hand tools. This itself may not be within the regs, but I have been told by many that it is common and generally ok so long as its not abusive or in a park. We found it nine years ago. Many of us, including our kids and/or our parents have caught their largest pike here. We have taken only two out to eat that I recall. We don't want to rape and pillage the country side, just dreamin about how nice it would be to have a little shack by ""our"" lake. Thanks for the replies."
534709,Guest,2003-08-29 14:58:00,0,"Sorry for the assumption. But being that question was legit and all, I can understand better why some Canadians think badly of American fishermen. How'd you like it if some foreigners did that in the States on US Forest Service land?"
534712,Guest,2003-08-30 06:17:00,0,Those might be Trappers Cabins you see and it would have needed a Trappers Cabin Permit or old fly in lodge cabins no longer in use.
534621,Guest,2003-08-25 14:28:00,0,"My buddies and I have identified a decent fishing lake on crown land in Northern Ontario. We enjoy camping along this lake, but recently got to thinking how nice it would be to have a permanent structure. We figure we could throw up something for a few thousand dollars and a weekends work. Problem is we would have no permit or other authorization for such an undertaking. Does anyone know the potential legal trouble a person could get into building a small structure on crown land without a permit. We are from Ohio and not Ontario if that matters."
534623,Guest,2003-08-25 15:11:00,0,In the land of lakes and regulations I cannot imagine anyone being allowed to build a structure on Crown Land without permission. US citizens can't even camp in the boonies without a daily permit. I would check with the local district officials. There is land on some pretty good lakes for sale. The futher north you go the cheaper it gets. TGG
534624,Trailerguy,2003-08-25 16:34:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Unless you are a native american from one of the local reserves you can't put any structure on crown land. A couple of years ago I read about some guys that built a cabin on crown land and bribed a native to say it was his. When the dust settled they were each fined heavily and the cabin was removed at their expense. The MNR enforces the rules zealously.
534629,hoosiercanadian,2003-08-25 20:28:00,104,"You will be throwing your money away, the structure will be ultimately torn down and removed. You could pool your money together and purchase a cottage on a legal Crown Land Lease Permit in Northwestern Manitoba for just a few thousand more, and have better fishing ."
534635,Guest,2003-08-26 06:15:00,0,Would it be OK if I build a shack on the beach at Key West this winter? Then I won't have to pay anything to visit your country either. ;)
534640,Guest,2003-08-26 08:18:00,0,"They have lots of ""rules & regulations"" in Ontario because of these dumb and dumber ideas that come up from time to time. I'm from Canada but like open water fishing, so I think I'll head down to the Mississippi this winter, find a nice walleye/sauger pool & maybe put up just a wee little shack along the shore....just so I don't have to go too far for the good fishing! I'm still laughing!!"
534642,Guest,2003-08-26 09:02:00,0,Great Guide: Would you happen to know the website link to take a peek at some of these lots for sale? Thanks!
534643,Guest,2003-08-26 10:06:00,0,"Thats the dumbest question Ive ever heard. If you decide to build one, make sure its near my area because I do report every permanent structure (on Crown Land) I encounter to the MNR (License plates too)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
