1264162,GWC,2011-01-23 20:22:00,1021,"Gull Rock Lake is good. Don't think you could go wrong there. It's a drive in, we've had great luck at Poplar Point Resort. We've made 4 trips & have had a great time on each trip. Good rates, good facilities & friendly people. We're headed back again this year."
1264528,Needinatripnorth,2011-01-24 21:25:00,6,"Thanks everyone for your recommendations. Have been looking through all the options - Gull Rock looks great but concerned about the size and how wind/weather might be a big factor. Are there plenty of areas there that are reasonably protected? How does Pakwash, Red Lake/Parker Lake compare in size, weather protection, fisheries?"
1264560,REG,2011-01-25 06:09:00,445,Pakwash is a good sized lake and is mostly north-south so it can get some good sized waves on the main lake when the wind howls from the north or south. But it also has many bays and islands so you can get out of the wind. The nice thing about Snake Falls is that they're in a protected area of the lake and you have two rivers close by - the Chukuni and the Trout that both offer great fishing and protection from any wind. I'm guessing that Pakwash and Gull Rock are comparable in size but I haven't compared the acres.
1264602,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-01-25 08:24:00,100,"The Sioux Lookout Area is once again ignored. No one will deny that the walleye action, and options of where to fish(with less traffic) is endless. You have your choice of smaller or bigger waters. Perfect spot to bring your kids. Send me a message anytime, and I can direct you to one of the many great camps in this area."
1264624,LOW1,2011-01-25 09:30:00,2828,"By all means take your kids as soon as possible-age 5 is plenty old in my opinion. I suggest that you stay within an hour's drive of Kenora so that you can use its great indoor pool, see a movie, etc as a ""Plan B"" if the kids (or you) get tired of fishing. Also, don't be afraid to hike, canoe, mountain bike, or otherwise take advantage of what the area has to offer. I am sure that other communities have similar attractions so you might want to consider what the area you are interested in has to offer. Fishing is great, but not necesssarily for 14 hours a day."
1264644,kgeary,2011-01-25 10:31:00,88,"Think about Anglers Kingdom on Nungesser Lake It is remote like a fly-in without the expense of flying. great walleye fishing , Nice sand beach , very family friendly. kg"
1264764,new hips,2011-01-25 18:02:00,498,"Here is the link to Parker Lake, the Lodge is located way on the North end and has a waterfall flowing North into Red Lake, so no boats can access. Red Lake is big but usually can fish around those islands nearby 5min away. Parker is very protected and wind never an issue. It also is completely dead ended, can't get lost but has plenty of water, 5-6 miles 20 minutes from camp to the back end, which also has a incoming stream,( also a great Northern Bay) Many weed beds in all bays, most of the water is 20ft with one area near camp wirh 40ft, you can troll shorelines or cast, with good Northern and Walleye action. Bigger Walleye on Red Lake, but in recent years have moved more to Western end of the Lake.http://travelingluck.com/North%20Ame...html#local_map"
1265571,Needinatripnorth,2011-01-27 21:18:00,6,Gull Rock and Golden Hook it is. Thanks to all for your help and hope you all have a great fishing year!Go Packers!
1265705,digjig,2011-01-28 11:42:00,146,"We have been going to Rainbow Point Lodge for the past 3 years and love it. Family of 4 (11 yo boy & 9 yo girl). Great people, good lake, good equipment, convenient. Bob and Gale are great owners, George (heads up their bait house, dock services, all around great guy) is beyond helpful. The lake is big enough but not too small. You can get back to camp in 20 minutes in a camp boat. Lots of bays, islands and shore lunch spots. Perrault falls is right by the camp. The lodge has their own store and Dutchies is about 1/4 mile away if needed (beer). My 2 cents. -DJ"

1262532,Needinatripnorth,2011-01-17 21:01:00,6,"Hello! My boys are finally old enough for a trip to Canada, and we're looking for recommendations for a camp in Ontario - probably a drive-in due to fund constraints. Will be bringing (2) boys, 14 and 12. Driving distance isn't a problem - I have flown out of Red Lake before. Would like a place that reasonably clean on a lake that isn't too large - don't want wind to become too much of a factor. Trophy fish not a requirement - would rather have the boys catch numbers of walleyes and pike - smallies if possible - just to get 'em hooked. Late June arrival for a week. Not excited about the big camps - a small family-owned and friendly place would be the preferred. Would love to hear your recommendations and experiences. Thanks a million!"
1262673,REG,2011-01-18 14:04:00,445,"Have been bringing my kids to Canada since they were about 10ish. Snake Falls Camp on Pakwash has been great. Fishing is good and you can always catch them up the river if the wind gets out of hand. They have a pool table, foosball table, trampoline (very popular) and a very large basketball/rollerblade court. Family owned and very friendly. They even have wifi so the kids can check facebook - unless you want to forget to mention that to them."
1262702,outdoorsron,2011-01-18 15:37:00,843,"Hello:: Check out Wenasaga Lodge near Ear Falls They have a fishing package that includes everything you need except food and cleaning of fish. Includes Ice, bait, freezer service, boat and gas. If you have your own boat you get dock space and gas. Its the only resort on the lake. Its a smaller lake and weather won't be a problem. Fishing is real good. Check with them to make sure things didn't change. Been going there for the last 6 years. Good Luck O - R"
1262952,new hips,2011-01-19 11:25:00,498,"We have been going to Eagle Falls Lodge out of Red lake, They will pick you up by boat and take you to their camp. This is were I would take young boys or first timers. They are situated on Parker Lake which is all dead ended and about 5-6 miles in length, so wind is never a factor. Has a lot of small walleye with occasional 21 above or bigger. Plenty of Northern also, to keep the boys interested, they do have some large northern, I've seen some 44in come to back of the boat on follows. Travis and Carrie bought the lodge about 3 years ago a really great young couple. Check out their website and costs, you can also fish Red lake as they have boats on both sides. The food is great and cabins boats and motors all good, average day for us is about 30 walleye and 15-20 pike daily. PM me if you need more info..........New Hips"
1262960,jsmyers,2011-01-19 12:16:00,198,"I went to Wabaskang for the first time when I was 5. I skipped a week of kindergarten to go in September. I still have the 14.5"" perch I caught mounted. It rained, it snowed a tiny bit, and we didn't do anything but fish, but I was in the boat, wearing out a crappy spin-cast outfit as fast as I could.But then I'm crazy about fishing...maybe because my dad didn't take me when I was 4, and it really made we want to go.We didn't go the next year, but I went when I was 7,8,9...all the way until I was about 14 or 15, when we stopped going.I was also in the blind with my dad when I was 6 and he got his first deer.My daughter ""caught"" her first fish last fall when she was about 15 months. She was sitting on my lap with her hands under mine when we hooked and landed a small bluegill. I can't wait to take her and my wife to Wabaskang for a half-fishing vacation. If she can hold a rod and crank the handle, then she can troll for hammer handles if she wants to.No offense, but I feel sorry for your boys to have to wait until they are teenagers to be old enough to go fishing. I suppose I don't know your kids, so maybe I should keep my mouth shut. I do know that some of my cousins who never went fishing much before they were that age couldn't care less for it once they get to that age.My suggestion is to go to a lake where you can catch small northerns in visible weedbeds in the middle of summer. You are less likely to have bored kits when you are always moving and when you can see where the fish are likely to be hiding. Wabaskang fits the bill in my experience. It is pretty easy to stay out of the wind, and there are a number of camps:http://www.peffleyscamp.com/http://gawleysparkviewcamp.com/http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/http://tallpinescamp.com/http://www.wabaskangcamp.com/http://kingfisherlodge.com/I'm booked with Peffley's for the opening weekend, and we used to stay at Gawleys. From what you say, I suspect that one of the other four may be a slightly better fit for your family. Peffley's is on the other side (boat in only) of what can be a windy part of the lake. Gawley's is a pretty big operation."
1263147,ManitouBass,2011-01-20 00:10:00,201,"Sleepydogcabins would be great. Small lake, beautiful cabins, nice gear, cheap prices, and you can drive right to the camp. Its about 20km south of Ear Falls.If you so choose, you can even go to the hydo dam in ear falls and catch nice walleye right off shore.camp narrows on rainy lake would be another great option."
1263148,ManitouBass,2011-01-20 00:22:00,201,"Or you could always drive up to manitou, just past emo (west) a few clikcs.Nice hotel and everything you need in emo, then some amazing fishing right by my house, I'd be glad to show you the spots on Rainy RiverTons of walleye, lots of trophys, sturgeon, smallmouth bass, big pike, real world class fishing, and its pretty easy to fish there.Right by one of our hardwater spots, I build a sliding hill for the kids, can help them stay entertained if they grow tired of fishing.If you wanna come here, let me know, I'll hook you up"
1263196,jiggster,2011-01-20 07:22:00,183,I have been bringing my son since the age of 8.I have had lot of friends go to the same lodge during the past 10 years. You might want to consider Anderson's Manitou Falls Camp on the English River by Ear Falls. Fishing is fantastic. My son also caught a large numder of walleyes from the dock when I cooked. [B]Price very reasonable[/B]. If you want more information please contact me. Best of Luck. The Jiggster
1263197,HighTech,2011-01-20 07:24:00,75,For an excellent Family run Camp call Len and Nancy at Bonnie Bay Camp on Wabigoon Lake. Located near Dryden for occasional shopping and MacDonalds for the Kids or whatever. You will catch all the fish you want. I'm not in any way associated with the Camp but I do know it and I live here. You will be lucky to get a spot as they are usually booked solid.
1263876,luv2fishcanada,2011-01-22 20:42:00,41,"I have been going to Gullrock for over 30 years usually the first week of June. Started when I was 14 with my dad. Went 15 times or so with him and my uncles. Greatest time in my life. They are in a better place now, but I continue going with my daughter and my son (9) might make his first trip this year. Gullrock is an excellent place to fish with quality of fish and large numbers of Walleyes. I have always stayed at what is now called GoldenHook Camp, but have heard good things about Wright's and Five Lakes Lodge. You won't be disappointed in Gullrock, best week every year of my fishing life."
