1266595,campchick,2011-01-31 07:38:00,96,Limit your search to those camps that have their own aircraft for flying guests if you want a deal. The simple truth is that the cost of flying is killing the camps that have to charter planes to transport their guests. They cannot afford to give deals. Another factor is the uncertainty of gas prices we all have to live with. Who can say what gas will cost this summer?
1266653,walleye4life,2011-01-31 10:19:00,54,"Gas prices are going to hurt everyone... again.... I have already seen outfitters charging a ""fuel surcharge"". This angered me... then I was reminded that everything else I buy there is a surcharge added on to it.... should be interesting to say the least."
1266732,SSA,2011-01-31 13:48:00,19,Which fly in places are charging fuel surcharges this year or have charged fuel surcharges in prior years when the gas prices went up? Be interesting to hear which ones apply these extra fee's.
1266772,Guest,2011-01-31 16:13:00,0,"I would look at Buck and Bingwood Cabins located on Lake Obakimaga. I have been a long time guest and have always really enjoyed the fishing there. Plus their pricing is extremely reasonable. A 7 day trip runs $850.00 This includes the round trip flight, and also all the gas you use in the boats. Another awesome deal is that children under 14 years old are half price. Check out their website at www.fishbucklake.com If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact them as there are great people that own the camps."

1266335,wmd,2011-01-30 12:54:00,388,"2 friends and I are thinking about doing a flyin with our sons, all adults. Has anybody found a great deal out there with the economy still stuggling to a point. Ontario would be 1st choice but would consider Manitoba as well. We live in South Dakota so either province is manageable for travel. Last year there were some bargains but I have not come across any this year. Would like to stay in the $700-$800 range if possible. Thanks in advance for your help.wmd"
1266369,adempsey,2011-01-30 14:53:00,963,"Air Cochrane, Air Ivanhoe, Hearst Air , AMS Outpost Camps and Parks all have some options in that range [or $30-$50 over].This information is just from places I have bookmarked for future reference. I have not used any of the services. Cheers!"
1266376,Mike Borger,2011-01-30 15:13:00,1554,"All decent options. I'm not a fan of the small dishpan outpost lakes north of Cochrane though. The camps are sub par, but the fishing is decent. I've flown with Parks and Air Ivanhoe and always had great trips. Parks is owned by a super nice young couple from Thunder Bay. They're trying to get their business up and running and are fantastic hosts. AMS out of Nakina is on the cheaper side too. Ara or Meta gives you access to huge fish filled watershed albeit with multiple camps on it. Stone is very lightly fished and would be my choice. The outfitter has 3 camps on Stone and they're rarely booked. Also out of Nakina and on the cheap side, O'sullivan lake Outfitters has very reasonable rates for their fly ins: http://www.osullivanlakeoutfitters.c...ing_lodge.html Luenberger's in Nakina has very cheap rates to two of their closer camps, Jemar and Samuelson. By all accounts good fishing in both, as well as running water and hot showers: http://www.leuenberger.ca/outposts.html The closer outfitters such as Parks and Air Ivanhoe will offer a fantastic experience at a great rate but on smaller lakes. The lakes north of Nakina are bigger. In some cases considerably bigger."
1266430,deputy dog,2011-01-30 17:19:00,305,"mattice lake outfitters, lots of info about them and their lakes on this site. good luck whole bunch of choices out their"
1266443,Mike Borger,2011-01-30 17:57:00,1554,They're great but like most outfitters in that region cost more than $800 for a week.
1266452,walleye4life,2011-01-30 18:17:00,54,"Many outfitters are willing to offer reduced prices at certain times of the year. My advice is to find an outfitter with decent lakes and camps and see if there is time of year when they will give you a ""deal"". A normal $800 fly-in doesn't get you much.... at all."
1266454,Mike Borger,2011-01-30 18:23:00,1554,"Good tip on asking outfitters if they'll cut you a break, but that statement is simply not true."
1266497,deputy dog,2011-01-30 20:04:00,305,missed the part bout price......
1266551,GOBIG,2011-01-31 03:37:00,126,"If you can be flexible, just narrow it down to 2-3 outfitters and call them. See if you can fill any open weeks. Once all the sport shows are done, they will have a better idea as to what weeks they have open. Most outfitters want to be full, and will work with you if they have openings."
1266581,deputy dog,2011-01-31 06:50:00,305,thinkin there was another thread in this section bout fly-ins under $1000 with good info.......
