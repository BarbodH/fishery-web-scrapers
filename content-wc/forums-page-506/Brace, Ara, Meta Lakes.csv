1263797,Mike Borger,2011-01-22 12:58:00,1554,"I fished Ara about 5 years ago and I doubt much has changed. We never did get around to fishing Meta or Brace, the walleye fishing was excellent. Unlike the other two lakes it's deep, clear and filled with structure. Great jig lake."

It is a reasonably priced venture with excellent hosts Kyle & Teri Polesky. I go with a group of 8-10 guys every year.220 miles of shorline. We do the housekeeping, they are opening their Lodge this year for people who would like American Plan.Check out their web site at BraceLakeOutfitters.com My preference is in August, no biting bugs, and the fishing is good, plus we always have a couple of Black bear hunters in the group. Whatever you decide, enjoy your trip.Regards,Rob"

Had a nice chat with camp owners John and Cheryl at the Chicago Outdoor Show on sat. and will have a tough time waiting for June to roll around. Sounds like preferred method of finding walleyes is back-trolling with floating jig rigs till you locate them, then anchoring up and pitching the traditional jig and minnow combo. Anybody have any additional info that might help a group of of 13, most of whom have been on canada trips before, but never to this lake? Thanks!"
