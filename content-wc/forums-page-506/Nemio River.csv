Is any part of the Nemio river closed in the early season due to it being a spawning location?Can you purchase fishing permit & Gouin permit at the outfitter?How long would it take to get to Baie Nord with15/20hp motor? Thxs for any info."
1265761,retire55,2011-01-28 14:50:00,1029,I fished out of the Nemio Outfitter in Aug 2005. There was no difficulty finding and catching walleye. The boat ride from the Nemio location to Baie du Nord took about 15 minutes in a camp boat with a 15 HP motor. Permits are sold on site.
1266263,Freytown,2011-01-30 09:32:00,770,Thxs for the reply. I was hoping that someone who fished last year would comment. Would also like to know if any part of the Nemio river closed in the early season due to it being a spawning location.
