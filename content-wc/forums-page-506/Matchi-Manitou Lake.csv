562589,Smitty12,2007-01-06 17:56:00,14,Hi Guys Just wondering if anyone has fished this area of Quebec - I am planning a trip for May and this is one of the options we have. Any info would be appreciated. thanks Paul Smitty

We fish Parent Lake which is about an hour beyond the turnoff to Matchi-Manitou. It is a little further up Rt. 117, and then North on Rt. 113. All paved road. The town of Senneterre is near the southern end of the lake. The walleye fishing is fantastic, but this is big water, so it can take a while to figure out. Since we have been going for so many years, we really do not have any days that we do not catch fish. Fair to good pike fishing, but we do not target them. We catch all we want while fishing for walleyes. We always go the second week of June. We used to go to that area the end of May, but the fishing could be spotty, and the weather can be brutal. Waiting an extra couple of weeks made a huge difference in the fishing and the weather. Let me know if you need additional information."

I'd be interested in reading your >comments on other places like Wetetnagami, Berthelot, Club >Kapitachuan and Adventure Monet. Thanks in advance. I've fished Lac Faillon and Club Kapitachuan in that area... If you are going in May, Kapitachuan should be a definite consideration... It's mainly small water and rivers (Megiscane, Pascagama and KekKek) however... It's legal to fish the spawn in their territory and you can really kill the walleye in river fastwater eddys (and the Northerns are right in there with them.) The weather can be brutal, but sticking to the smaller rivers keeps you protected... plus, running some of the larger rapids is a challenge (the outfitter puts 25HP engines on his boats) Fallion and Valets were both OK, but I went to both those in May as well and a lot fish were still in spawn (and you can't fish the fastwater in their territory I don't think (although I do remember fishing some fastwater at the very north end of Fallion (It was about 20 years ago since I have been there, so my memory is a little hazy) Sidenote: There was a pretty major forest fire in that area last May... All the Outfitters were fine... except Forsythe - their main lodge burned to the ground I believe..."
