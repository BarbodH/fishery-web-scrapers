I know a couple of groups that fish Dorval for many years but I found it expensive since you have to pay the park fee on top of the price of a cabin per person. Was looking for another good place for walleye that is not too hard to access with my 17ft Crestliner. Thinking Matchi-Manitou looks good but was not too sure if it was a pressured lake (at least for the area). I know the owner does not have exclusive rights but maybe that mean nothing in that area. Owner said there is little pressure but like to hear reviews from someone else.thnsk"

The people are friendly in town, on the water, etc. Camp has new owners since I was there. Plan to go back in the next few years, but currently hooked on Georgain Bay."

We began on the east side where the Wineway R. entered Simard but spent most years staying on the North end of Lac Quinze north of the town of Mofett. Easy drive and there are 2 or 3 outfitters there. We always took our own boat. Simard is about an 8 mile run by boat, but worth it. Smallies, pike, and many walleyes are this lake. It has 200 miles of shoreline and numerous islands for a fish fry lunch. Lake is excellant due to the flow of the two big rivers and 250 depth in some areas. I was back this past October and not much has changed."

This year we are going to O`sullivan lake lodge. We have never had a problem with any owners in Quebec. We have also fished in Ontario and Manitoba."

1267974,4Paulie7,2011-02-04 04:16:00,30,You find it by going to Ontario then turn right.
1268260,PIKEMAN330,2011-02-05 09:07:00,101,"I have been to Quebec only five timesand have had good trips four times.The bad trip was because the fishing was so bad,about six fish all week.The owners were all americans but one and that was Tamrac Air.The owner at Tamrack could not have been nicer. All the locals I have meet were very nice.There are a lot of very nice lakes and rivers in Quebec.Go catch some fish and have a good time."
514760,Papi,2001-09-04 04:50:00,13,Where did you go ?How did you find it ?
514761,Guest,2001-09-04 14:05:00,0,We have been to Caesar's Lodge twice and before that we used to go to Domaine Poutrinicourt.
514766,Guest,2001-09-04 15:31:00,0,The french in the province are pretty hard core. I hear that the walleye are just as cheeky. They ignore the english speaking fisherman and will only bite your offering if you are french speaking or muttering in a pidgeon french. Best bet is to get some bilingual minnows to translate for the walleye. Whatever you do don't use artificials. Think the walleye are arrogant check out the northern. Do not display any bumper stickers in English. You can get arrested......
514767,Guest,2001-09-04 15:38:00,0,I hear theres no limit on the seperatist walleye....that is the walleye that want to seperate from Canada. Fillet em up boys. Might want to spice them up a bit. They have a little off taste from years of getting a free meal.
514762,Papi,2001-09-04 16:38:00,13,"How were your experiences at those two outfitters, housekeeping, cabins, the people and naturally the fishing ? What time of year did you go ?"
514763,Guest,2001-09-06 16:04:00,0,"At Pourtinicourt you drive to the main lodge and then take a boat to your cabin. We always found the fishing to be great - over 400 walleye for the week. We usually only did catch and releast so we didn't bring any home but could eat all that you want while there. Cabins were clean and all of them have indoor toilet and showers. We stopped going because there were only two of us and it was hard to rent a cabin for just 2. Most cabins are for 6 or more people. We did really enoy the place though it was a long drive - approximately 17 hours from home in Pa. Been to Caesar's - nice clean cabins - the two years there we were in brand new cabins with indoor toilet and hot shower. Fishing was not as good here/ We are also looking for another place to try - maybe a little closer. At Caesar's you can either drive tot he main lodge or stop at the coursol base and be flown directly to your cabin (which there are no roads),"
514768,Guest,2001-09-07 05:46:00,0,Hey Canadian Red Neck! What province do you live in? I am in Ontario and have been fishing in Quebec for 4 years now and have nevr had a problem. Let's not stir the pot and give the outfitters and lodge owners a bad name!!!!!

514765,Papi,2001-09-07 07:22:00,13,"I found it :http://www.poutrincourt.qc.ca/It is north of Lac St-Jean....quite a distance.I spoke with other fisherman and Dorval Lodge, Domaine Matchi-Manitou are also very good for Walleye and Pike.Email me if you want the addresses."
