1267512,Seanik,2011-02-02 16:48:00,218,"I decided it's time to replace the old portable Garmin 120 fishfinder with a new and improved unit. Considering the Hummingbird 285 C fishfinder/Gps but I am opened to suggestions on other units. The 385 C accepts Navrionics sd chips but I have no idea which one to buy if I bought it. This year I will be at 2 Ontario Lakes, Heathcote Lake near Savant Lake, Ont. and Lake Nagagami near Hornepayne, Ont. I don't think they are on the hotmaps chip. Is there a general chip for that part of Ontario and what kind of detail would I get for these lakes. I am old school and electronically challenged when it comes to this new technology. I know there are many of you that are knowledgeably about this stuff. Please help an old geezer into the 21st century of fishing gear. Seanik"

1267660,GOBIG,2011-02-03 03:29:00,126,"Hummingbird 140c for the fish finder. My group bought 3 of them and they work great. Very easy to operate, and pull up when not trolling or jigging. The display is very clear. We do fly ins and this is a easy unit to pack. Hummingbird make a 140 without color which is cheaper yet. Very happy with this unit.."
