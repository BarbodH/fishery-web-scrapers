1264066,Guest,2011-01-23 15:55:00,0,try maptown.com-just got maps for our lake this year north of red lake
1264133,Further North,2011-01-23 19:01:00,2008,How about a website where we can pull the maps for free?Wisconsin has many lake maps on-line that you can download as PDFs right from the DNR.http://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/maps/

1264207,Jack77,2011-01-24 06:22:00,168,http://www.fishingmapsplus.com/index.htmlAfter a lot of searching I ran across this site. The maps give depth contours and some info on the lake and you can select what size you would like. I also found 2 of the 3 lakes that I am looking for.

I chose Canada, and it includes great deatail of hundreds and hundreds of charts and lakes in Canada. The only downside was that it took all night, even on high speed internet to download. The plus side is that it can be zoomed, moved, and manipulated like an electronic map. Very cool. I already have spots checked out on the map for the summer!Scott"

I believe Meta, Ara and Brace are in Thunder Bay district. So why don't you call the Thunder Bay district MNR and ask them directly for the maps? You might end up getting them for free."

It will generate a number of links to that place on online mapping sources. The topo and aerials are more useful. The national map of Canada is a good one, even if a little awkward to use."
