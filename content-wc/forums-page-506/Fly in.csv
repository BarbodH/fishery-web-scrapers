1251311,tly,2010-11-23 19:22:00,1900,"First item: WEIGHT be careful of what you bring. Only essentials, if you want beer etc have outfitter bring it, not part of your weight. 2nd item: Forget trolling batteries, they are heavy 3rd item: For convenience for all, stow stuff in totes & rod carriers, it makes it all so much easier. Most of all, have fun!"
1251342,vteye,2010-11-23 20:25:00,812,Anyone have a good check list ?
1251387,SinOrSwim,2010-11-24 05:48:00,1528,"Hookers! Umm, I mean hooks. LOLParachute if they don't provide them. (wink wink) It depends on the weight limits and what the cabin offers. For instance, we have decreased weight by not having to take a ton of batteries. Take things that have rechargeables and then use solar to charge if needed. Can use the house batteries or bring a small solar charger. I ran my GPS/fish finder last year with a flexible solar panel. Like a flexible cutting board. No weight and when rolled up took up little to no space. Agreed with totes etc. Take extra totes with you as you will always have stray things. A-it protects things and B-doesn't make you look silly when a random pillow or life jacket is being loaded and unloaded by itself. Putting everything in totes will make things go more smoothly and help their staff to pack/load the plane. But, take extra totes so those random things can have a place. All toiletries, bug spray etc get travel size. No need taking full bottles of stuff. If you can get with your group so not everyone is bringing a full bottle of bug spray, first aid kits, etc. Try to combine/share some of that. Combine rod carriers. I always put my poles in my brothers etc. No need to have a rod carrier per person if they are the bigger ones.Have someone decide/prepare a menu and buy all food as one as well. Prepare as much ahead of time as possible. For instance, my brother is responsible for most of our menu. He will cut veggies and put in baggies or cook a bunch of bacon and have in plastic baggies. We make wraps at shore lunch. Tortilla, fried fish strips/chunks, lettuce, onion etc. Tortillas are easy to transport and are light. But, by having a bunch of that stuff prepared takes less weight and makes things much simpler when up there. Our menu has gotten borderline gourmet over the years and we are more efficient. BEER! Take plenty of beer or alcohol as you will not have the ability to run to the store. Not saying you have to get loaded but try to have some idea of what you will use/drink. Some people will way over estimate and some way under. If you like to have some drinks after a day fshing but part of your group didn't think they would but decide to drink the first couple nights, then you are out of luck the last couple. Might not be a big deal but is frustrating when you can't run to the store. Check to see if they have a satellite phone or something to take. Nice to have a safety net in case someone gets hurt or needs to contact home. Have fun. We have been flying in for 15+ years now and love it."
1251398,wallydave,2010-11-24 06:30:00,2151,"Check out some fly-in websites, they usually have a ""What to bring or how to pack"" info. Check with some fishing buddies who have flown in, and check here for info! Plan your trip, meals snacks, always think LITE! Some fly-ins will deliver beer and groceries ahead of your trip.Write down each meal, take a look at your tackle, take only what you will use, jigs, lures extra line and rod n reels.Try to pach smart, use your bath towel to wrap up your rods in the rod tube. Use your coolers as luggage.Check with your outfitter for ideas and questions. They will want to help with your trip, a good trip for you will likelt mean you will want a return trip!"
1251409,Pooch,2010-11-24 07:36:00,4619,"Our group has a letter that was given to all of the new guys on our fly-ins. It was camp specific, but fairly general in nature. Usually everyone did well on weight, but there was always one or two who ""free lanced"" and cost the group over weight charges on stuff they never even unpacked. Our group has made over thirty float plane trips over the years and half that many drive or boat to trips. So we have seen our share of ""oops"" or ""Boy! that's something you don't see everyday"" moments.Main thing is to pack smart. You really need little tackle to fish most fly-in camps. A back up rod (or two) for the group is always a good idea. Humongous tackle boxes are BS and totally unneeded. Small variety of jigs, some bottom bouncers and a bag full of spinners and floating jig heads are the bread and butter of any Canadian walleye trip.Make a master list of ""group"" supplies and stick to it. No need for three guys to all bring a first aid kit, etc.Email me if you want the letter.Pooch[email protected]"
1251428,Crede,2010-11-24 08:46:00,134,"1) Portable depth finder. This may be obvious, but it wasn't to us when we went on our first flyin. 2) Depending upon the amenities of the cabin - if don't have electricity at night - go get a couple of the battery-operated disc lights. Powered by 4 AA batteries. About 6"" across. Push on the front to turn on/off. Made to hang up in closets, etc. Cost about $6 per pair. Makes cabin life much simpler after dark, and they weigh almost nothing. 3) Most importantly, weigh everything before you go and mark the weight on the bag/box or item. Better to be removing lures you will never need, that extra-extra pair of pants, etc. then. Being surprised by your weight at the dock and then making quick decisions about what to leave behind never turns out well."
1251442,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-24 09:30:00,223,Always remember on a fly in weight is the number one thing. I always look for things that you need to mix water with. Rice a roni-noodle roni- all kinds of potatoes. If you have access to dry ice a small amount will keep things frozen for days. If not use half gal jugs from milk and mix kool aid crystal lite and other powder drinks they come in handy when you get into camp also will keep your food cold always remember to leave some space for freezing. Make out a menu give it to the group and if there is something someone does not like exchange it. Once you have it go to the store and look for items that will be lite but serve its purpose. Tackle should be held to items you know you will need and share a box with your boat partner. Cloths depends on the time of the year. A clean set of underwear is a must dress in layers remember goosedown is light and very warm. A good set of rain gear will not only keep you dry it will help keep you warm from the winds. Just think if i am going to take this is there something else i could take that might be lighter that will do. I cut out the can goods as far as fruit and veggies.. Plan several meals of fish that is what you are there for. Keep food to the basics. Beer i think weighs in at about 20+ lbs a case same as pop. Discuss the amount of beer your group will drink chances are you will either be drinking lots of beer at the end of the week or bringing it home. Rubbermaid makes totes pack everything you can in tote's coming home you can put tackle boxes in them and other items dirty cloths boots you name it. Hope this helps some look for threads on this i remember last year someone was looking for the same thing. ALL OF THE ABOVE POSTS ARE GOOD AND SHOULD BE GONE OVER AND USED.
1251483,thunderatwork,2010-11-24 13:05:00,79,"duct tape. on a trip five years ago one member brought everything but the kitchen sink. (and i suspect he had one in that big green duffle). out of all that ""extra"" stuff he brought, duct tape came in real handy. if you are going to where it is mostly walleyes and a few northern- leave the bass stuff at home. spinners/plugs/buzz baits are all near useless where we go. variety of jigs/gulp/minnows/ and some five of diamond spoons do our group real well. no need for eeryone to take five rods and six reels. go together so that you have extra as a group, not individually"
1254877,djcoop52,2010-12-12 09:03:00,1411,I agree with others planning is very important share duties and make lists. Canned potatoes are easy to carry and cook and taste great. take enougn beer having it flown in is expensive. Take a basketball net makes a great anchor just fill with rocks and will hold boat in place and easy to pack never know if they have anchors in boats.
1263973,labsrus,2011-01-23 09:41:00,557,"Our goup have been going on fishing trips for 30 years. Most have been drive in but we have started to go on fly ins the last twn years or so. We have a details list and do not duplicate items like first aid kits or other items that the group would use. Our menu is pretty good we try to take some items that can serve multiple needs. Example is to take a spiral cut ham. Use it for dinner early in the week. Then ham can be used for lunch meat or fried up to serve with breakfast. We have a debriefing meeting after the trip to help refine our list. Another thing is we used to take those fold up chairs for comfort when relaxing around camp. The place we have been going to has some of the plastic stacking chairs so we will leave the folding chairs at home. We alos consider the over weight charge to be parts of the expense and the outfitter will fly in later in the day with our extra stuff. We alos make sure we have some of the supplies, like potatoes and beer flown in mid week when he comes in to check on us."
1264014,JCsGoneFishin,2011-01-23 11:40:00,34,"Even if you don't smoke, bring a pack of smokes if your cabin has an outhouse... Light and blow smoke into the outhouse before entering to get rid of the smell...Also coordinate number of nets/bait buckets. Only need 1 per boat.One thing I haven't seen mentioned on this thread in insect nets for your head. Some of those biting flies go right through all known insect repellants. You don't want to come home looking like you just went 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.Also a deck of cards or some other form of entertainment for if/when the weather is bad and you can't fish."
1264043,Jack77,2011-01-23 14:10:00,168,"-You will not need as much clothes as you think. Clean boxers, socks and tee shirts for every day. Everything else you can wear over again. Rain gear is a must have.- make a menu and stick to it when shopping. Plan on eating fish everyday and sometimes twice. You can do walleye lots of different ways. pick some easy recipes. Things that mix with water are easy and light. ie. powder drinks, rice, ramen noodles make a good snack.Pack your dry goods into cardboard boxes- they can be burnt with the trash and do not need to come back with you. Leave the pop and water at home. Beer is a must! If you are looking for 5 star accommodations and gourmet culinary delights you may be on the wrong vacation. - I bring my entire huge tackle bag - I am on a fishing trip, I am not going to be with out something on my fishing trip-catching fish is why I am there. I can control what I am wearing and eating but I can not control what the fish are eating. I have been to lakes where we could catch fish on anything and some where we had to experiment to find what was hot. Portable fish finder is important, lots of times it is just a matter of finding out what depth they are at related to nearby structure, you won't find either without a fish finder/ depth finder.- Chances are you may get weathered in one day or part of one( heavy rain and wind ) bring some cards and light plastic poker chips.In everything that you pack think about weight and what you can do to reduce it as well as consolidate it into containers that are making the trip with you. 100 lbs adds up quick! A lot of these suggestions and the ones mentioned in earlier posts depend on whether you are going to a lodge or outpost. Experience is the best teacher because only you can decide what you can live with and without. One last suggestion - leave a clean set of clothes in the car that you can change into for the ride home. I have a checklist that I keep from year to year that I would be happy to share with you."
1265938,MorganMan,2011-01-29 10:00:00,341,"As you can see from all these posts, those of us who have been going for 15+ years have things down to a science (our own science) and most of us either meet afterwards to determine what needs to change for the next time or have someone in the group to go through the group items and determine what didn't get used and what we could do without next time. For the first time, you don't have that luxury. There are so many variables such as weather, your cabin, what you like to fish for, and your personal needs. Weight is always an issue, but since you are starting this early, you should be able to get down to some basics. For years, I took too many clothes, you can wear over and even wash if you need. MUST HAVE....good rain gear. It's worth the money as if you get wet and it turns cold, you are miserable. Many good ideas here and we will take a few with us even after all these years. Thanks fellas! Most of all, be careful and have fun! I can't imagine not going every year!"
1251546,Jatar,2010-11-24 17:49:00,169,"wear cargo pants and a big jacket, stuff as much as you can in the pockets"
1251589,SinOrSwim,2010-11-24 21:29:00,1528,"???? Weight is weight. We get weighed along with the gear.However, we don't get charged extra for weight. We just make sure we have certain things that come in on a later flight at their convenience. usually a check flight later that same day and sometimes a day or two later. For instance, extra ice and beer sometimes comes in a day or two after we get there. Just have to make sure you know where all your ""must"" haves are. That way your rain gear doesn't get left behind as happened to my brother a couple years ago and it rained like a mother the first afternoon. LOL"
1251654,deputy dog,2010-11-25 07:54:00,305,"what do you guys do about drinking water? this, along with beer of course, is the biggest killer of weight for my group. havent come across a filter to remove giardia(sp) yet and dont want to get the dreaded ""beaver fever"" while in the bush"
1251659,Ogoki,2010-11-25 08:04:00,291,"The first thing is DO NOT go on a fly-in as it will consume your thoughts and cost you money every year . LOL LOL . I got ""hooked"" on fly-in trips and have been on 33 . It keeps me going as it is something to work towards and think about to get away from the problems of life . We fly-in with Mattice Lake Outfitters after having used several other outfitters . They do not charge us for extra weight . We do not take advantage of that either . They will drop off the extra stuff at their convenience . The planes are not overloaded either . They are very safe . Most of the time it is just my wife and I so weight is not a problem like it could be when I go with groups of 6 or 8 . That being said much of the trip is planning and researching . If you only get a weeks good out of a trip then much is missed . We have many many pictures and ""stuff"" we have accumulated from our many trips . Our family room is full of mounted fish , pictures , pieces of wood that I brought back and made thigs from etc. Then there is the carved bears, lamps etc my wife has purchased . We met a bear guide on a trip years ago with Mattice and now we are hooked on bow hunting bears also . Needless to say going to Onatrio on our 2 trips a year have became a VERY BIG part of our lives . My wife has a list of fly-in things to bring and she is tweeking it on every trip. Keep a list so you can use it in the future . Every group has their own preferences on food likes etc. The basics are much the same. We are so ""consumed "" with our trips that we named our Labs after the area . We now have Goki (short for Ogoki) , Moji (short for Mojikit Lake) and our newest is Matti (short for Mattice) . Enjoy the planning , the trip and the memories after you return !!!!!!!!!!! Deputy Dog , you can leave a pot of water on the stove after it has been boiled and cover it to keep ""stuff"" out or take along a small purifier. There is one purifier that holds a gallon or more that gravity feeds thru the purifier so you are not pumping it all the time ."
1251682,deputy dog,2010-11-25 08:45:00,305,"ogoki, thanks for the insight about boiling. do the filters remove giardia as well? from all that we have heard this is the parasite you need to be concerned with, kinda like the water in mexico and montazuma's revenge type thing. we went with mattice last year and with the otter flying you in there is almost no weight issues, just use common sense. first rate outfitter and caretaker, richard, was great!"
1251683,Crede,2010-11-25 08:46:00,134,"Didn't filter the water on the first 15 flyins and never had a problem. Did some boiling but not always reliably. On the last few I have taken a PUR CR-6000 2 Stage Oval Water Pitcher. Got it at Wal-M. Cost less than $20 and replacement filters cost about $8 each. Bought it because the side of the box says, ""Removes 99.9% of microbial cysts, such as crytosporidium and giardia."" Holds a little less than a gallon and filter good for about 40 gallons - I use a new filter for each trip. Takes about 15 minutes to filter a pitcher full. Don't know if it actually makes us any safer or not, but everyone in my party seems to like having it. Cheap and pretty lightweight, it now makes the trip each time. As one of my brothers commented, ""99.9% has got to be better than nothing."""
1251742,SinOrSwim,2010-11-25 17:32:00,1528,"We take in our water. Usually take a couple cases of bottled water and sometimes one of those 2.5gallon jugs. These are the types of things we take a little in at the start and leave the rest at the dock. They bring in a day or two later when they fly their check flights. I am not opposed to drinking the water straight from the lake other than the color. That part creeps me out even though I know it's clean. Plus, it is pulling water from down by the dock. Who knows if gas has leaked or if someone in our grou pee'd off the dock. So, bottled water it is unless I fill up a container from the middle of the lake."

1251519,trapperbob,2010-11-24 15:53:00,45,"Battery powered head lamps the small LED strap on, Good for night fishing, outside at night for outhouse, and reading. Also check to see if they have outside barbecue, propane preferred. Many will fly in beer , water and soda ahead of time which won`t count against your weight. If they fly in water then get flavoured powders such as propel etc. which weigh nothing. Try to avoid any cans and glass too much weight. Don`t forget toilet paper and wipes good for hands and other parts of anatomy. Good luck. also at least one piece of rope and duct tape, good for covering holes in walls and screens."
