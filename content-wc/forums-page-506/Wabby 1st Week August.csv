We are heading to Pelfreys so I would appreciate info, patterns and if you have GPS coordinates, that would be awesome. Thanks, Craig"

If you're not, your kids might be.I suspect that you're after 'eyes. The only way we ever fished for them was slow trolling small spinners (mepps 3-4, fuzzy grub with safety pin, etc) with some crawler around the second narrows at dusk."
