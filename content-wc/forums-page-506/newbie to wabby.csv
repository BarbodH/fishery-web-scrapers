1263540,jsmyers,2011-01-21 10:22:00,198,"I haven't fished the lake in 15 years and I never really targeted walleyes when I did, but I'll tell you what I know. I'll be up there May 21.Here are some maps I made last summer:Camps:http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UT...bcc85c53a&z=12Geographic Names:http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UT...,0.445976&z=12From this thread: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=168289These threads on another forum also has some tips:http://lake-link.com/boards/forums/v...hreadTypeID=43http://lake-link.com/boards/forums/v...hreadTypeID=43There is slightly moving water in all of the narrows, especially the ones on the main Cedar River path from Perrault Falls to the outfall. Of course this varies depending on rain and lake levels.You can find maps online. I'll refer you to your previous thread for the link:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=169515Also read through these long threads to find a few tips:http://lake-link.com/boards/forums/v...hreadTypeID=43http://lake-link.com/boards/forums/v...hreadTypeID=43"
1263656,WallerChief,2011-01-21 18:51:00,83,"I've got some GPS points for you if you use a GPS. I've got a great map, but it's the only one I have left. Tom will give you a map of the lake and mark it up for you. It's a pretty easy lake to get around on. Leave some for me! I'll be back for the 3rd consecutive year June 18-25!!"
1264903,jigmeister,2011-01-26 07:21:00,34,anyone else?? i know there are a lot of wabby guys out there
1265018,KevinSB,2011-01-26 11:12:00,73,"A buddy and I took our first-ever Canadian trip to Wabaskang last June and are heading back late May (due to our scheduling issues -- not related to ""best"" fishing times). We stayed at Tall Pines Camp and loved Steve and Andrea.Before going, we worried lots about how and where to fish and were pleased to validate Steve's promise that the fish are there and catchable. We caught lots of 'eyes and northern, as well as assorted smallies and perch, during our week there.Consensus on these boards seem to be that most or all Wabby camps are like Tall Pines in that they do a nice job of helping you find the vfish. This year, I'm taking a smaller tackle box and will wait until arrival to resolve exactly where and how I'll fish.To the OP, sorry I don't have more specific input. Just wanted to reaffirm that Wabby is a great place to fish and that Tall Pines in particular was a very enjoyable stay."
1265049,jsmyers,2011-01-26 12:40:00,198,"Because Keynote is smaller and shallower, it warms up faster than the rest of the lake. Depending on what the fish are up to when you are there, that may be a good or a bad thing. The downside to fishing in there is that there isn't a depth map available as far as I know.We used to troll up and down the channel connecting Wabby to Keynote, in August, using pretty much any northern lure (but a mepps #4 was my favorite in there). We'd usually get a lot of small ones, sometimes some perch too.It always seemed to me that the northern parts of the first lake (the small one nearest the falls) never got much fishing pressure. It might be an interesting place to explore, but that was only one part of the year, a long time ago.From what I've read, during the time you'll be there, finding weeds is one of the most important things for finding fish (pike, perch, and eyes). During that time I'd think that the spawn would be putting a monkey wrench into any bass fishing plans. My that time, I would also expect that trout would be in the deep parts of the lake."
1265542,Tbum,2011-01-27 19:32:00,12,"The last week of May will be my 6th trip to Wabby. We never have a problem finding fish. Weather can be challenging. Had a blast last year with perch on Keynote with a slip bobber rig. Had equal success for 'eyes using jig & minnows or 3"" gulp...really didn't matter. I have a map I created I'd be willing to share. Send me a PM."
1265890,Stu,2011-01-29 07:40:00,472,"Try fishing the 1st narrows just outside your dock for walleye. Specifically, nearer to the bank on the south side. We've also had great smallmouth fishing by tying our boat up against the bank right in the middle of the narrows and tossing jigs into the current. The water flows pretty fast in the spring. If you go up to the 5th lake (past Gawley's Bay) you'll find 2 sunken islands. Here are the gps coordinates: N50*27.347 / W093*13.472 & N50*27.367 / W093*14.336. Doe Island is also a hot spot for eyes all year round. Head up there early in the morning or evening and fish the north side, just off the east point. Gawleys Bay is also a good spot for evening eyes. Wabby is a great lake and you guys will have a blast. Shoot me and email ([email protected]), there are lots of other spots to fish. Good luck - Stu"
1267349,jsmyers,2011-02-02 09:57:00,198,"It seems to me that there is a newer aerial on google maps for the area. You can actually see a number of the rocks, reefs, and navigational hazards if you zoom in.Using the Google Earth program that you can download makes it easier to zoom in.Here are two sources for detailed maps of the ground:http://mapper.acme.com/?ll=50,-93z=15&t=Thttp://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/englis...tour&map_layer[northarrow]_class[0]_style[0]=ANGLE%20-1.59925396088029&urlappend=The first one has the maps that are available on anglersatlas. The second is the same data, but displayed in a different format."
