1265798,fishman10,2011-01-28 16:41:00,226,i have very rarely seen it work better than live bait.
1265940,Bigstorm,2011-01-29 10:04:00,799,"I wouldnt waste the money on it. Live bait works the best and if you are lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time when they are really hitting, try a salted plastic tail/grub/shad."
1265950,Jack77,2011-01-29 10:29:00,168,"I think that I am going to stick with minnows, night crawlers and walleye belly again this year. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" It sounds like Gulp Alive works about the same as the walleye belly."
1265977,Seanik,2011-01-29 11:40:00,218,"Jack77 I use Gulp alive and have found it to be very effective, especially on a remote fly in. You may want to reconsider using Walleye belly as a bait, Walleye is considered a gamefish in Ontario and it's illegal to use gamefish as bait in Ontario. Seanik"
1265983,Jack77,2011-01-29 11:59:00,168,Did I say walleye belly? I meant sucker belly. yea sucker belly is what I use.
1265996,Wall1,2011-01-29 12:38:00,17,"All i will say i would not go on a Fly in with out 3"" smelt - much bigger fish on Gulp- not so many little ones- i have fished in same boat with non- Gulp fisheman and out fished them everytime.I do tip the gulp minnow with a very small piece of crawler - Some days nothing seems to matter good or bad - but overall it is the best producing method for me Very strong and many many fish on 1 gulpgood luckWall1"
1266015,Jack77,2011-01-29 14:06:00,168,It's only $20.00 so what do I have to lose. I'll give them a try. You can't have too many options ..............right.
1266023,Bill Krejca,2011-01-29 14:23:00,6107,"I think you meant to say ""When I fish in Manitoba and Sask.! Bill"
1266094,Wall1,2011-01-29 17:48:00,17,"Jack 77- i was wrong on the size gulp i use- i said 3"" but i checked and it is actually 4"" smelt color - try a tub and see how it works- like i said i catch more big one than the others and the only different is i use the gulp- all week - work good on a drift across a windy shore 15-25' of water with most coming around 20' down- if real windy use a drft sock to slow the drift.good luck and let us know how you doWall1"
1265139,Jack77,2011-01-26 16:47:00,168,I have never used Gulp Alive but am thinking about getting some for my trip to Canada this spring. Is it really as good as live bait? how long does one minnow/grub last? Any tips on using it?
1265147,jiggster,2011-01-26 17:17:00,183,"Jack 77, My son age 21 and I use gulp when we go to Canada. My son uses it about 80% of the time. My son and I will catch about the same on gulp or live bait. His gulp will last for about 6 fish. It is critical to measure were the hook will come out of the back to make sure it is straight on the hook."

1265217,Glenman12,2011-01-26 20:09:00,762,"this has been my experience with Gulp Alive...if youre on fish and they are hitting, it works well...if you are dealing with finicky light biters youre better of with the real thing.."
1265304,new hips,2011-01-27 07:32:00,498,"We were on the fish in Red Lake, I switched to a Gulp leech, they would tap it but only one get in the boat, switched back to half crawler and started nailing them again. Cost for a flat of crawlers is cheap compared to the overall trip. Tried to sell my Gulp at a rummage sale and no takers, $3 for the bucket. My fishing buddy also got rid of his Gulp grubs. I know some guys swear by them, not for me."
1265313,nitrodude,2011-01-27 07:44:00,60,Just wanted to say I've found the exact same thing after a couple years of trying the Gulp Alive.
1265315,Bill Krejca,2011-01-27 07:53:00,6107,"As in a hair or feather or tube jig vs live bait saga, some imparted action on the part of the user is usually necessary to achieve favorable results with other than live bait. One would not normally expect much success just holding the jig over the side. So it is with Gulp, in many cases. It may be nothing other than a slight movement that make it attractive. Too much action can be unnatural, so this needs to be applied applicably by the user. A huge difference in success is also generally noticeable where the fish are more plentiful. There seems to be achieved what I call ""the boarding house reach syndrome"", that is, the fish become more competitive when they ""feel"" their neighbors are going to get to the offering first, therefore they try to get there ahead of the others. Fish that are more singly spaced may be a bit more cautious in taking the offering. In clear water and/or ice fishing, this can be observed. Gulp can be a fantastic bait, we use it with great success in the Nakina area, actually use little else. Bill Krejca"
1265319,Shorelunch,2011-01-27 07:56:00,554,Same here.
1265327,tv4fish,2011-01-27 08:13:00,2694,I've used both the minnows and the leeches. As stated by others - if the fish are on the bite - they work as well as live bait. I usually switch after 3-4 fish as I think the scent (liquid that they are stored in) wears off and they are not quite as appealing after that period of time. I like the fact that they can be put back in the liquid and re-used and the fact that they are rather tough so you CAN re-use them over and over.
1265337,Flip Silverlake,2011-01-27 08:41:00,645,"I have found that if I switched to Gulp, 3 inch leech, just as the sun dropped below the tree line it worked real well. Better than live bait. In fact late in the evening it would out fish live bait 10 to 1. During the day I found live bait to work better. Fish would strike Gulp harder than live. It's almost like fishing with a plug. You do have to work the jig more to get movement. I use it and have had real good luck with it."
