1264661,Gavorlake,2011-01-25 11:33:00,33,"I SEE 3 lodges on the lake,and how many outposts ? Thats alot of fishermen on a 25 mile lake"
1265015,kgeary,2011-01-26 11:09:00,88,"Nungesser lake has about 28,000 acres of water. It is a dark water lake with a huge forage base of ciscoes, whitefish and perch. I have fished hundreds of lakes across Canada and haven't found a more productive walleye lake whether fly-in or drive-in."
1265543,DonC,2011-01-27 19:51:00,93,I recommend Birch Island Resort at Minaki. It is on the same water as Rough Rock. Definitely a great place. Don
1265630,camp chef,2011-01-28 08:38:00,915,"Without question you need to try big North Lodge in Minaki. We have fished there for 5 years and although we are trying someplace new this year,if I was going to fish a couple hours from Winnipeg,we would be back to Big North in a heartbeat.Check out the website"

Looking for a guided trip with Smallmouth, Pike and Walleye -- numbers are more important than trophies. Have narrowed it down to Carribou Falls, Rough Rock, and Separation Lake.Any guidance on these three lodges would be appreciated -- pros and/or cons. Other lodge recommendations in the area appreciated as well.Thanks!"

They have three camps on the lake, one drive in housekeeping and two boat in (or fly in) that are full plan meals and all. We have been staying at their Caribou Falls camp for the past 12 years and they are fine folks. Paulhttp://www.halleyscamps.com/"
