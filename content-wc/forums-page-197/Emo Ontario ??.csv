First count finds about 10 lakes, but an increase in altitude soon triples that number. I understand there is decent walleye fishing right in the city and close to the city limits.Nashville, for me, is right up there with Minneapolis, but I can bypass Nashville on the drive to Red Lake."
5516930,stumcfar,2017-05-02 09:51:00,451,"Not that it really matters, but Emo is 500 miles from Minneapolis by road. Nice community right on the Rainy River."
5517658,jcd,2017-05-02 13:45:00,185,Mapquest says about 315 miles from Minneapolis to Emo.
5517794,stumcfar,2017-05-02 14:36:00,451,"You are correct, my bad. I didn't figure in the exchange, it just over 500 kilometers!"
5517962,penner,2017-05-02 15:14:00,348,Thanks for the info LOW1.
5518978,Baseline,2017-05-03 05:40:00,3207,"Emo is a small community. Anyone moving there would have to appreciate small town living. The winters are long and cold and summers short. If a person was into fishing I couldn't think of a better place to live because Emo is in the dead center of North American fishing opportunities both summer and winter. I'd say anyone living in Emo would be more likely to travel to Winnipeg than Minneapolis when they wanted some big city amenities. Duluth, MN is only 3 hours away."
5519538,LOW1,2017-05-03 10:41:00,2828,The OP and his sister may like reading one of the local newspapers:http://www.westendweekly.ca/Fort Frances also has one:http://www.fftimes.com/Sorry I was so wrong about the mileages!
5510242,penner,2017-04-30 05:37:00,348,"Hi. Was talking to my youngest Sister last night and she told me she has a job offer in Emo. Just wondering if anyone here is familiar with the area? Or , maybe one of you live there ? I have never been to that area but I might have to make the 1700 km trip for a visit and holiday. Thanks."
5512306,Skywagon,2017-04-30 20:17:00,1106,I would guess the offer may have had something to do with a gold mine. That is on the doorstep of Lake of the Woods.
5513530,LOW1,2017-05-01 09:13:00,2828,"Been through and stopped in many times. Smaller community, so it does not have a large assortment of cultural or other amenities. It has a very good grocery and hardware store, and other local stores. It has local medical facilities but I am not sure how viable or good they are. It has local schools. Emo has always seemed to me to be very clean and well maintained. Fort Frances is 25 miles east and has good medical care, car dealerships, a Walmart, etc.Emo is about one hour south of Kenora which is a nice town of about 15,000 with all the shopping, restaurants, etc you would want. Minneapolis and Winnipeg would be about 3.5 hours away.Housing may not be that available or cheap in Emo because of the demand created by the gold mine.Emo is not just a mining town. It has a large agricultural component with some forestry in addition to the gold mine.It's on the Rainy River near the southeast corner of Lake of the Woods. Lots of outdoor activities in the area.All in all, if someone likes smaller communities I think that it would be a nice place to live."
5513786,That Minnesota guy,2017-05-01 10:06:00,8293,If you can get to Minneapolis in 3.5 hours from Emo remind me never to ride with you.
5513874,FishinFreaks,2017-05-01 10:28:00,386,I'll take that ride!
5514578,kzoofisher,2017-05-01 14:52:00,5144,"I'm picturing a town where everyone wears black and has there hair hanging over their face. Oh, and lots of angst and existential crises."
5514834,Knoxabilly,2017-05-01 16:34:00,225,
5515058,Low4fish,2017-05-01 18:28:00,37,Likewise for Kenora to Emo (180km). The OPP are going to be very interested to talk to you when the first part to Nestor is 90 km per hour and the rest is 80. Thanks for the nice words on our community in Kenora. And I agree with your assessment of Emo a nice community. Sent from my SGH-I317M using Tapatalk
5515186,muskyman73,2017-05-01 19:08:00,401,Ditto on the Emo trip ; as long as I can wear my snowmobile helmet and a kevlar suit.
5516018,SterlingArcher,2017-05-02 07:08:00,92,"I was just thinking that. Roughly 315 miles from Emo to Minneapolis...if you can make that drive in 3.5 hrs you have a fast car, good roads with no cops, and a death wish"
