5331993,team walleye,2017-02-13 21:02:00,336,Hi everyone! I was just curious to chat with some people on here that make there trip to Perrault lake and specifically stay at Rainbow point lodge. I have stayed here my last few trips up and have been very impressed. Of course my love for Perrault Lake is strong so I want to hear from anyone who fishes the lake and see what lodges people stay at and what they like about them. Any and all experiences welcome!! Happy fishing! Bryan

Now as far as the lake goes,.....I often hear people call it the ""Dead Sea"",...and I'd like to keep that rumor goin to keep people away!!!!!!!! Hah!!! I do wish it had lakers,...but all I gotta do is jump over to Cliff Lake if I wanna catch some of those rascals.My opinion---I love the lake.Chuckbearfvr13"

They truly understand ""we have a choice"" when it comes to Canadian destinations. Their staff is on top of their game. Always available to make the stay perfect. The fishing is phenomenal! Walleyes, perch, northern pike are abundant. Smallmouth bass fishing is terrific. I've been to other lodges in Canada in past years. I'm coming back to RPL again this year for my third trip. RPL and Perrault Lake has all and more than I could ask for in a Canadian destination."
5334297,team walleye,2017-02-14 19:47:00,336,What week will you be there? I will be there June 24-July 1. About a week or two later than usually for me.
5336273,Guest,2017-02-15 19:01:00,0,I will be at Rainbow Point Lodge the second week of July. This will be two weeks earlier than on other trips but I am more excited than ever! We are looking forward to excellent smallmouth fishing. The top water bite should be peaking at this time. We'll be working the walleye and pike as well. Good fishing!
5336441,team walleye,2017-02-15 20:35:00,336,We have had some guys in our group catch some very nice smallies on top waters over the years! Good luck in your trip! Private message me if you want to talk about the trip! Bryan
5528042,Guest,2017-05-07 14:22:00,0,HI. we stayed for 2 weeks a couple years ago. very nice and nice boats. wifi was week though. caught 5 biggest walleyes ever on their bay with the drift method with the tiny hook and leach just floating. hope to get back next year. small lake but if the wind wipps up the waves can get nasty on the main lake. always had fish for meals.
