5254121,rzep,2017-01-04 20:32:00,1196,"US currency is most stable currency in the world. If US dollar were to drop 40% within few months w/r to major currencies,we have bigger issues than Canadian fishing trips. I do not see this as being gauged by anyone...It is just being smart shopper.. I do not buy the argument about convenience and risk..."
5254249,Juls,2017-01-05 03:02:00,13414,"Cool....maybe i'll buy the 3 year Ontario fishing license this year, instead of just the annual.Also, when I have to pay for the temporary work permit (new last year), to take charters across the line on lake erie, it will be under 400.00 this year. Anyone know if it's going to keep going up by chance? If so, I'll wait a little longer to buy them..."
5254426,Obabikon,2017-01-05 07:11:00,2370,"Fishoil poked just enough to get me into this conversation with.... ""It doesn't benefit us much if the Canadian camp we use charges in US dollars and doesn't lower their price as the exchange rate increases. It does make camps that charge in Canadian dollars much more attractive if you're thinking of an extra trip or changing camps though."" Then follow that comment with.... ""So a year or two earlier when the rate was even up you were charging the same? If so, that means that when it became 1.33 you were getting 33% more in Canadian dollars for the same package. I understand you need to make a profit but how do you justify a huge price increase like that over such a short period of time?"" And I'm back in. I agree that it is silly for me to be involved in these conversations constantly. However, when someone claims that a 1.77% annual price increase for my guests over 11 years is excessive... I feel it is a little more personal. My business is based in USD... so, the only thing the exchange rate affects are my Canadian bills. You don't have to accept that it is more convenient. Right now, if you book a July trip and plan on paying in Canadian dollars. You believe you will be paying $500 US ($650 CAN)... if the exchange rate drops to $1.10 before July... You will now be paying nearly $600 US for that same ($650 CAN) trip. However, if the exchange rate goes up to $1.50... you will now be paying $430 US for the same $650 CAN trip. This is really simple. It doesn't have to go to par to be a ""risk""."
5254858,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-05 09:09:00,461,"So this might sound crass but enough is enough. I (as a lodge owner) could charge in tic-tacs, used hockey pucks, Yen, USD, Loonie, gold bars. What I charge my guests can be all over the competitive market. Much less, the same or much, much, much more. And I as a lodge owner will in fact charge whatever I want. If I want to charge you a fee to drive down my driveway, or to shake my hand or to swim in my lake I have every right to do so. No matter what my competition says. Why, because the consumer has to make the determination that driving down the driveway is worth the fee. And guess what, no one wants to pay to do that so I don't charge a driveway fee. See where I am going here. What we charge doesn't matter and you can complain all you want. If you don't want to pay it then don't. But I will give you a hint. If people thought it was too expensive they wouldn't pay it and we would adjust our fees. If the general consumer actually thought that we were gauging our customers as some have alluded to then they wouldn't come and hence that rate would have to be adjusted. But they don't. All lodge owners I know (and I represent hundreds of them through my board connections with tourism) run excellent businesses, work extremely hard and are proud to do what they do. If their prices were so out of line with what you think we should charge you then they would not be in business. So the exchange rate is going up. It could double. And you know what? As a business man that charges in USD I would let it ride until my customers said hey Ted, $1,500 a night is a little much. But until that point since I took the risk I am taking that reward IF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY IT. My success in the business will be determined in part by how I can gauge this price point. Because as you have alluded to you are on me and see what I am doing. You apparently know my margins, know my Porsche payment and what I pay for labor. The USD has dropped 3% in the past week. You know what. Since I charge in USD I am going to send out a revised bill to all of my customers for that 3%. Boy, they would be screaming bloody murder. Funny how they are silent when it goes down but when it goes up we are all the anti-Christ. rant over"
5254890,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-05 09:29:00,447,"Fisherman Ted Strongly worded but I get your point and agree with your position. Prices reflect what the market will bear. Being relatively new to this site I'm unaware of which resort you own. Do you mind sharing that info here or via PM? If it helps, I would guess the vast majority of fishermen appreciate the hard work that resort owners put into running a good operation and don't mind paying a decent price for a good experience. Personally, I appreciate having so many good camps to choose from, although it does make it tough to decide when there are so many good options."
5254954,Fishoil,2017-01-05 10:10:00,1277,"Jared, go back and read post #24 and maybe you'll understand what I'm getting at. I'm not trying to say that you're benefitting any more from today's rate than your guests were back when the rate went down to par. As Ted pointed out, nobody is talking about that part of it, they just want to bust the camp owners' chops over not getting a drop in price because of the favorable rate. Never mind the fact that they didn't have to pay more a few years ago when the exchange rate went the other way. Sorry if I got you worked up, that wasn't my intent. For the record I have been paying essentially the same rate in US dollars for many years at the camp that I most often frequent and I really don't care what the exchange rate is."

5507658,Deer Lake 1,2017-04-28 16:06:00,12,It probably is worth buying your license on line from US as the exchange rate is favorable again for those going to Canada to fish this year. The $55.80 non resident 8 day license will cost you $40.80 in US funds. That's like someone giving you $15 for free! For those that buy a non resident for 3 years to Ontario the Canadian price is near $250 and by buying on line it's in the $180's. The lodge I stay at only accepts US monies so when the bill comes the fishing license is included at $55.80. I cross it out and save $15. Some guy on the tv business channel said the exchange rate is near a two year high for US - Canadian Dollar. Tight lines!

5255594,fishron,2017-01-05 16:08:00,317,"Thanks to Andre for bringing the topic of exchange rates forward. Your a fellow fisherman that has experienced the great fishing at lake Hebert that has been the best fishing for me for three trips in all my Canadian experience. I'm 72 now and my fishing Canada started shortly after I got my first car, a 62 Corvair, and as many times I could make it to Canada thereafter. I've not been privileged to fish deep into the interior or to the great fishing destinations in western Ontario but I would like to say, I've had great trips to many places in Ontario and Quebec and regardless of where the exchange rate has been, I've never regretted the price for any trip. The value of my fishing experiences is measured in something other than money. I have to believe it's that way with most of us."
5255618,fsz,2017-01-05 16:29:00,144,"I feel the price is the price. USD or CDN, as long as its not hidden. And enforced across the board by the vacation service providers. If someone is charging say $1,000 USD dollars for a one week trip per person, I expect all customers must pay the fee in USD. If the trip is $1,000 CDN, same thing. I expect the service provider to require everyone to pay in CDN. As far as service providers changing which currency they accept based on the exchange rate, I have no problem with that as long as it is clearly stated, not hidden and equally applied to all customers."
5255794,Andre (wallyandre),2017-01-05 18:14:00,2274,"I raise that because for me it is something different; I have a trailer on the US side of the border on a campsite on Lake Champlain shores. From April to November I fish on the US side, let say 80% and the other 20% is in Quebec. So for me the impact of our lower $ is quite important, it's not like somebody that travel once a year for a week so spending 2-$300 more is not the end of the world but base on months it's another story and another impact. But because I love fishing Champlain I will keep going anyway and maybe spend less on things that I don't really need."
5256626,LOW1,2017-01-06 08:43:00,2828,"I don't have a problem with resorts (or hotels, airlines, etc) charging different rates to different people for the same thing. If a resort owner, for example has an empty cabin that usually rents for US$1000 and someone offers CND$1000 that's better for the resort than letting the cabin go vacant. It's no skin off my teeth what the other guy pays.As long as the resort owner is not discriminating based upon race or whatever, price should be a negotiation between the resort and the customer."
5256642,LOW1,2017-01-06 08:46:00,2828,"There are always winners and losers with the fluctuation. For Americans who own cabins in Canada our property taxes, utilities, insurance and everything else that we buy with $CND have decreased by close to 35% over the past several years."
5256762,rzep,2017-01-06 09:41:00,1196,"Since it appears that I am going to be paying for the Wall on the southern boarder now, the exchange rate with northern neighbour is of crucial importance for my next trip."
5256778,Shellback,2017-01-06 09:48:00,8083,The real bandits are the banks exchanging money. xx% on one dollar or a thousand dollars. Total thieves! How is it my CC company only charges me the exchange rate of the day with no fees?

Make no mistake, Shellback, the CC company is still making they're money, just not where the exchange is happening..."
5257074,LOW1,2017-01-06 12:32:00,2828,The CC company also charges the merchant a percentage of the transaction as its fee. That is why it wants to encourage you to use the card by having a low transaction fee. It makes its money off the merchant.
5254994,pjshorthorn,2017-01-05 10:30:00,5654,"Jared, I completely understand and respect your thoughts on the whole exchange rate aspect. You have obviously built a successful business model that allows you to continue to invest in your lodge ; providing your customers a better experience year on year. Keep doing what you do.!!!! One year I want to spend my trip at Obabikon after having stopped in last year to see you while fishing with Breezy Point on LOTW. You have provided a ton of insight into why an exchange rate can favor a customer vs. a business at any given time and I would suggest you continue to do so, as frustrating as it can be in some cases. Yourself, Ted and Gord have willingly opened up your business approaches to WC in order to educate and hopefully have folks make informed decisions on really important trip(S) for each person. Alas, you will not always have everyone see it from your perspective; which is to be expected. I do agree with you that the exchange rate concept is pretty straightforward. There are no smoke and mirrors with the calculation and how monies are figured out on trip costs........unless......I'll get back to this point in a minute. From where I sit, I weigh my trip choices on two very simple concepts. Where will I receive a great fishing trip experience and can I afford that trip. Yup, will I catch a ton of fish during the trip ? ;that is not a factor for me personally. I get more enjoyment out of all the other aspects of the trip than catching a ton of fish. Like many folks on this forum, I have the pleasure of fishing with good friends and family. I willingly pay for my son's trip as he is in college still and on occasion, I pay for my Dad's trip as a small way to say thank you for all the years he did the same for myself. So I have either two or three shares to pay depending on the year. I'm blessed that they still want to go to Canada on a trip. Having said that, the exchange rate has always been a factor on whether a trip will be affordable enough where I can pay the cost and have three generations fishing together for another year. The last few years we have used a lodge that charges in Canadian funds and has provided us an amazing vacation;with thoughtfulness and integrity every step of the way. With a very fair exchange rate provided by the lodge, I can afford to do what I want to do with my son and Dad. I agree that there is some risk for both the customer and lodge owner regarding the exchange rates and the fact that rates may become unfavorable throughout the course of the year prior to a new season. I liken it to the stock market......with it being a little bit like legalized gambling......we make informed decisions on our investments and hope that things don't head south for everyone involved on the downside of a change. If the US dollar weakened to the point that the exchange rate dropped $0.30. - $0.40 in a short period of time, we all have bigger decisions to make outside of what lodge we want to use next season. I've made trips where the rate was par up to 36 % in favor of the US dollar,but I still made trips regardless because those were trends that corrected over extended periods of time and not in one year. Back to the earlier point I was going to make. In all the years (30+) that I ever questioned an outfitter's business approach and integrity has been when they decide to ride the exchange rate wave. I have used two outfitter's on Lac Seul that have done so. When the rate favors the US dollar they charge in US. When it favors the Loonie they charge accordingly. That will never be a viable business model whereby customers will tolerate that type of change over the years they use an outfitter. The two outfitter's that I had that experience with are still in business and very busy so there are folks that don't seem to mind if they change their policies with the rate trend. Would I ever use them again, probably so.........just not on a consistent basis. Sorry, for the long response. Just thought I would provide a perspective from a customer who appreciates what lodge owners do to provide a great vacation experience regardless of the currency they charge. BTW, I looked at the new website the other day and it is quite nice. I'm sure you will tweak it as feedback is provided,but it is a nice foundation to build from in the future. PjShorthorn"

I do enjoy a little devil's advocate myself at times. Thanks for the kind words PJ. As long as the trip is what you can afford... it doesn't really matter if it is being charged in US or Canadian. Someday when you stay with us, I'll guide you for free for a day... and we can hash all this out hahaha."

5253737,Fishoil,2017-01-04 17:03:00,1277,"I was wondering if anyone would pick up on that. When I first started taking trips north the exchange rate was ridiculously high. Over the years it dropped down to par and now has gone back up quite a bit. Back when it was coming down I joked with a camp owner that if it got much lower they'd want us to pay them in Canadian dollars. I got a polite chuckle in response, I'm sure it hurt to have it drop and for them to lose all that money. Now the shoes on the other foot and the owners are benefitting from the increase. If I've been paying the same rate in the same currency for all these years why should it matter to me?"
5253801,Guest,2017-01-04 17:52:00,0,"First off... most of my bills are in US (including my mortgage payment). So... what really happened those years was all my Canadian bills went up 33%. I don't magically make more by charging in one currency over the other. When it tanked 4-5 years ago, and went to par... I didn't raise my rates. When it was low 6-7 years ago I didn't raise my rates because the US economy was struggling so much. This is the first time in my 10 years that I've felt a small raise in prices wouldn't hurt anyone involved. This is a HARD business. It is incredibly difficult to make a profit... if you doubt me, look at all the resorts that went under over the past 10 years. That said, I'm not looking for pity. I would like for people to stop assuming those of us who charge in USD for convenience of our guests... are fleecing the exchange rate system. Stop worrying so much about exchange rates. Figure out what it actually costs you where ever you are thinking about going. If it is a good deal... it is a good deal. If you're American... $500 US is the same thing as $650 Canadian... There will be people who charge in US that are better deals than those that charge in Canadian."
5253937,Obabikon,2017-01-04 19:04:00,2370,"I figured I would look back and see how much our rates have actually changed for our guests in the past 11 years. When I took over the resort (in 2007) a 4 day trip was $820. This year (2017) is year number 11. A 4 day trip is $980. That is an increase of 19.5% over 11 years. That equates to an average annual increase of 1.77% per year for my US guests. For those who opt to pay in Canadian currency... there would be more fluctuation for us. However, like I've mentioned before... I can count on one hand the number of Canadian groups I've had in 11 years. So, that's the actual cost increase for our guests. Over those years... my bills have fluctuated greatly. Some years have been in the red and some in the black. The only place you will see the effect of the exchange rate... is in how many upgrades I can do to the resort. THAT is where it truly makes a difference. A little more history.... Prior to 2005... the USD had averaged around $1.35 since 1980. Now, there were some pretty large fluctuations over those times, but I'm averaging. There was actually one point that it got up to $1.62. In that time period it also got as low as $1.12. If I were a speculator (and I am not, but I obviously have a very vested interest), I would guess an exchange rate of $1.35 to be a reasonable expectation for the next 25 years too. I guess that oil could spike again, but I wouldn't bank on it with the introduction to fracking. Aside from a large spike in natural resources, the Canadian economy probably won't out perform the US economy... barring an economic catastrophe."
5253945,rzep,2017-01-04 19:22:00,1196,Oba* No one is saying you are getting rich in your lodge enterprise. I think people are saying that US $ has more buying power in CAN (and Europe) comparing to couple years back. It somewhat puzzles me that you get pulled into these arguments and feel the need to justify publicly your business decisions.
5254009,Fisherman Ted,2017-01-04 19:52:00,461,It's because people continually question our ethics and accuse us of gauging our customers when the exchange rate goes (or appears to go) in our favor. Yet these same people are suspiciously quiet when the rate goes the other way and they get a killer deal. So when the rate is going down the last 5 years (and our expenses went UP) we were getting killed. Where were these guys then????Can't win really.
5254089,bthomas3333,2017-01-04 20:17:00,465,Cant help myself. Assuming we take the US customer prospective. Lodges that charge us in USD are taking the exchange/currency risk for us. Lodges that are charging in CAD are putting the currency / exchange risk on the customer. Most customers would rather know WAY in advance how much their trip will cost. So they charge us in USD for our convenience and we as US customers don't have to worry about how the USD vs the CAD performs and we can plan our trip cost. In exchange for our convenience the lodge can get hurt / benefit but the customer has a fixed rate. The point of all of this is to make our life as customers easier. If you would rather shop in another currency and take the risk the USD goes up or down vs the CAD then go for it. Buy a trip in CAD and hope the USD stays stable. If it were to go down...your trip could cost 20/30/40% more. Your choice. B-
5254105,Pooch,2017-01-04 20:27:00,4618,There are always camps for sale for those who think they can do a better job than those on this board who actually run a camp and try to explain to the rest of us.I for one want camp owners to make a decent living and keep the camp open and maintained so I have someplace to go and not have to worry about the day to day business of maintaining my own place. And I'm guessing that camp owners want the rest of us to make a decent living so we can come play in their sandbox.If you are really inspired by your own business prowess try running a float plane business. I know of a couple that might still be available for next season.Just sayin'....Pooch
5252257,Andre (wallyandre),2017-01-04 07:24:00,2274,Around 20 years ago when I start fishing a lot on lake Champlain it was $145 Can to buy $100 US. I was reading in a financial paper the other day that some specialist predict the same thing; so fellows amaricans just wait before buying you're Canadian $ and maybe forecast 2 fishing trips instead of one.
5252273,bigdaddyguns,2017-01-04 07:33:00,608,"Pump prices are governed by a combination of wholesale refined gasoline market futures on the NYMEX and local market spot price trends. The cost of the fuel in the tanks has no direct bearing on current pump prices although they are highly correlated.

The falling tail regions are where stations can make higher profits by exploiting the price to cost spreads until competitors eventually move market prices lower."
5252281,Fishoil,2017-01-04 07:37:00,1277,It doesn't benefit us much if the Canadian camp we use charges in US dollars and doesn't lower their price as the exchange rate increases. It does make camps that charge in Canadian dollars much more attractive if you're thinking of an extra trip or changing camps though.

5252585,Lake Wisconsin,2017-01-04 09:48:00,1960,"Was in Toronto two weeks ago and thought about the exchange rate while I was here. they had some pretty good whisky for a good price at the duty free. Once the exchange rate was processed, it came to $24 for stuff I pay $45 in US. That was worth the carrying weight!"
5253081,Obabikon,2017-01-04 12:30:00,2370,"At $1.33 the exchange rate has not moved much in the past year. Any drops or holds... should already be in place. We do charge in US, but my guests have without a doubt seen great benefits with the exchange rate over the past 3-4 years. This year was the first year in 5 years that we raised our rates at all. I would argue that most American Plan resorts that charge in Canadian are still more expensive than Obabikon. Even at $1.33"
5253489,Fishoil,2017-01-04 14:58:00,1277,"So a year or two earlier when the rate was even up you were charging the same? If so, that means that when it became 1.33 you were getting 33% more in Canadian dollars for the same package. I understand you need to make a profit but how do you justify a huge price increase like that over such a short period of time?"
5251898,Andre (wallyandre),2017-01-03 18:56:00,2274,While shopping this afternoon I pass by a exhange office and I was schock: $139 Can. to buy a $100 US!!

5251922,Overwatchmike,2017-01-03 19:19:00,201,Sorry Andre but I hope it goes higher! I want to side my cabin this summer! I can remember mid to late 90's it being $156 to buy $100.Sent from my SM-T567V using Tapatalk

5251970,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-03 19:31:00,447,It's much better than the 1:1 it was not too long ago. 1:1.39 is a pretty nice rate.

5252146,Skywagon,2017-01-04 05:08:00,1106,"Andre: I think we need to get into the money exchange business, that company is making over $5 on that transaction. It kills me how much money is made by a push of the button on exchange rates, on really large amounts of money it is outrageous.The Loonie has held it's own pretty well lately with the US compared to other countries. I read one of the doom and gloomers predict the time will come when $45 US will buy $100 CAD (not holding my breath on that prediction). If that happens, Arizona, Florida and Texas will have less Canadian residents in the winter."
5252177,Shellback,2017-01-04 06:09:00,8083,"How does the exchange rate effect US goods already on the shelf in Canada? Let's say a retailer has Offshore boards in stock that he bought at $1.20 CA. Now that board will cost him $1.35 CA. Is it normal for a retailer to raise the price immediately on in stock goods, or do they wait until they resupply?"
5252217,BornToFish,2017-01-04 06:30:00,1224,"Greetings,The previous post by Shellback made me think of gas stations in my local community within the US. Nearby gas stations regularly raise the price of their gasoline based upon the increases in the cost of crude oil, not what they paid for the gasoline that is in their tanks. In other words, they price their product (gasoline) on what their cost will be for their next supply of gasoline.In the spirit of being complete, I will also note that these same gas stations were pretty darn slow on lowering the price of their gasoline when the cost of crude oil went down!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
