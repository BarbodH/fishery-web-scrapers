If they open the dams there will be terrible flooding in the south."
5525098,fishron,2017-05-05 18:17:00,317,I hope they can manage the situation. Many times my group has made the beautiful ride north along the Gatineau River. We have seen the reservoirs in the drawdown stage but never the opposite of too much water. Give an update of the situation as it progresses.
