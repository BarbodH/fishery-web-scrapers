5535625,fishron,2017-05-10 16:33:00,317,"Last fall, on a short week on a favorite southern walleye lake, I had mentioned to some of the remaining anglers at the camp, we were pulling out in the morning. As a precaution we remove 90% of our gear each evening when we come in. In the morning, just before pullout, I noticed all the remaining nightcrawlers in my bait container were gone. I guess I was lucky because I had also left my radio in my forward compartment overnight. The thing is, if they had asked me, I would have gladly given them the crawlers. I now have a lock on my forward compartment. My bad. Only time that has happened."

5536457,MrSimon,2017-05-11 06:43:00,922,"28 years of going to Canada ... never anything stolen from the boat, cabin, truck etc etc. And I leave everything out in plain sight. At my cottage in NY, some of my renters had a fully loaded fishing kayak stolen right off the back porch in the middle of the night. I did everything to help find it, but no dice. That was a real shame."

Mentioned it to the owner as soon as we noticed, and he and his wife could not have cared less. We were also missing some fillets from the community freezer (in labeled bags in the only freezer in camp) at the end of our stay. Only time in may trips I've had any problem with theft.

5509578,Baseline,2017-04-29 16:58:00,3207,"About 15 years ago I was at a resort on Lac Suel. I didn't have a boat with an onboard charger so I had to use my portable charger. The resort had a generator so power to cabins was limited. To charge batteries they had a charging rack where you could put a battery and plug in your charger. On the morning of day two I went to retrieve my deep cycle battery and someone had taken my charger. There was no mistaking it for another similar model charger because I had my name taped to the charger in very large black bold print. The owner checked around, but I never did get the charger back."
5509602,pjshorthorn,2017-04-29 17:40:00,5654,"In 1984 I made my first trip to Canada as a teenager. We were planning on boating from Sioux Lookout ( Deception Bay launch) all the way up to Coone's Bay. For those of you that don't know the NE section of Lac Seul, this area is about off the map. We had planned to tent camp for the week in Coone's Bay which was open to Americans to do so at that time. When we checked in with the outfitter the night before launching, he mentioned that the native indians were fishing and trapping in the area and may actually be using the campsite we planned to use. He advised us that if we decided to go all the way up to Coone's Bay that it was very possible we could have a problem as camping that far north was fairly new for Americans and may not be welcomed by the native indians. His words were, "" If the campsite is open and you set up camp, when you go out fishing you may return to find all of your gear stolen or the campsite burned out. It is your choice,but I advise against going that far up."" We ended up heeding his advice and decided to camp on Taylor Island which was only about halfway to our intended destination. With all of of the gear loaded in our boats, it took us 6 hours to get to Taylor Island. By the time we got there, I was so over that boat ride.....but I was a teenager on his first Canadian fishing trip with threats of Indians burning down our campsite. Today, I would love to take that camping trip to Coone's Bay in a 14' fiberglass Lund from the 1960s with a 15 hp Evinrude hanging on the transom. Thanks for taking me fishing Grandpa. PjShorthorn"
5529498,lobo1,2017-05-08 09:15:00,734,"A number of years ago the lake we were going to still had ice on it so after a year of waiting and planning - our trip was cancelled 3 days before we were set to leave. I scrambled and went through all of my files and found an outfitter that I had used previously and called him. He said he could get us in but we would have to help open the camp and he would be sending some natives down to help us - but the normal camp attendant would not be there. Long story short - is we got back from fishing one day and I noticed my case of Molson Export Ale was gone - went looking for it and found the camp attendants cabin to have empty red beer cans on the porch - peered in and saw the rest of the empties. I was pissed but keep in mind these guys showed up to camp with weapons so there was little that I could.......or wanted to do. A few days later - on our last night in camp we decided to break into our ""rainy day"" stash - which was a liter of Jim Beam that was in the freezer. We noticed that it was 80% gone and we didnt drink any of it. We knew what happened....grrrrrr. About an hour later one of natives showed up to our cabin just HAMMERED - so we knew who drank the Beam. The outfitter sent me a check when we got home and I told him about it - so it was all good. Fishing was tremendous but we havent been back to this particular camp"
5530410,Jig Man,2017-05-08 15:56:00,95,"We are strictly a fly-in group that avoids lodges and resorts so we never worry about things being stolen. That all changed on afternoon when we returned to our Island camp. We noticed the all if the fry oil from lunch that we left out was gone. We were dumbfounded as to how it disappeared. We soon had our answer, we looked down by the lake and we see a black bear going through bouts. He was interested in the smell coming from opened bags of Gulp. In all we lost 2 gallons of grease and 2 bags of gulp."
5530874,drlee,2017-05-08 18:21:00,409,"I have fished northern Ontario on 26 different lakes since 1987 and always stayed in camps. Aside from 3 or 4 fly in's and a couple of boat in's, I have done drive in camps. I have never had one single incident of stolen property and we leave about everything in the boats each night we are there. Maybe I am lucky and/or foolish, but that is the truth. I did have a net stolen out of my boat in northern Wisconsin a few years back,but that's about it."
5503778,Pooch,2017-04-27 07:38:00,4618,"Several years ago one of our guys forgot his really nice fillet knife in the fish house and when he realized it went back and it was gone. I'm still ticked about it.I believe strongly that if it's not yours then don't touch it. Especially true in the ""bush"" or any remote location.Anyone else ever have something like this happen? I always leave my rods and gear in the boat in camp and (so far) have never had a problem on remote access lakes. In drive in camps I use my own boat and rod locker.Just curious and making conversation on a crummy rainy day here in Central Illinois.Pooch"
5503834,Riverkeg,2017-04-27 07:49:00,134,"Had a guy in our party one year that swears someone snatched his small digital camera from his boat. This was at a drive-to lodge. It was in a small waterproof box and could have just as easily bounced out based on where he had it sitting. Plus why would anyone take that when there was several hundred dollars worth of other stuff sitting there. I've never really worried about it. Not much choice though as the rod storage in my boat sucks when it's 3 guys worth of rods. I've never had anything come up missing. Last year though, I added a new Helix 10 SI to the boat on a Cisco mount. I do take that off and carry it up to the cabin at night. It takes about 20 seconds to remove it so...."

He stuffed his suburban with all his stuff with the anticipation of leaving early in the morning. Well I heard the truck peel out about 1am and then there was some yelling. Someone stole the Suburban packed with rods, reels, fishing trip gear, all this guys fishing stuff. Truck was found on fire a few hours later. Not cool at all."
5503962,Mojo-NC,2017-04-27 08:20:00,1929,Someone cut the wiring harness off of my brother's boat trailer while stopped at a gas station on the way up one year. Either that or it might have happened at the motel in MN where they stopped for the night and they didn't notice it until they stopped for gas. That was a PITA.
5503978,bthomas3333,2017-04-27 08:23:00,465,On a fly-in I never think twice about it. If someone wanted to canoe/hike miles through the bush to steal my stuff and then slog their way back out with my gear I guess they need it more than me. On drive ins I get a little more nervous but typically I just leave the stuff in the boat. It is just such a hassle to drag the stuff back and forth to the cabin (typically after dark both ways) that it just isn't worth it. If I did the math on all the $$ / stuff I might feel differently but I prefer to assume the best about other people esp fellow fishermen.B-
5504050,Ricky Spanish,2017-04-27 08:41:00,1298,"Never had anything stolen, but did have our cabin trashed by another group on a trip to Lake Erie about 1993. We went for a weekend, fished all day Sat, and one of our group did more beer drinking than fishing that day. He was completely tanked, staggering all over as we made our walk to our cabin. A group of guys sitting outside their cabin were highly amused, as I was, and decided to say something to him. Drunk guy's brother heard them and some harsh words were exchanged. Next morning, we were only about an hour into our fishing when Capt. Bart tells us to reel up and that we're done for the day. He said the housekeeper never saw anything like the condition of our cabin and refused to clean it. We had quite a beer can collection, and some dirty dishes from the previous night, but I doubted that was anything new. We got back to the room and bags of fish fry breading, flour, sugar and our garbage bags full of beer cans were strewn all over the place. We were asked to never come back."
5504226,Multispecies Guy,2017-04-27 09:26:00,447,Never had anything stolen unless you count the minnows and leeches that disappeared when otters figured out how to open the latches on minnow buckets left in the water. I lock my storage compartments and rod locker. I leave my electronics in place.

We checked out boat and determined that someone tried to get our motor, but did not take it for whatever reason. Other than that one incident, have never had a problem with theft. We take our graph up at night and leave the fishing roads in the boat."
