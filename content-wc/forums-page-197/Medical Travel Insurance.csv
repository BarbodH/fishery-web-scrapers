5529914,Bstar,2017-05-08 12:01:00,564,""" I calllled the two closest hospitals and were told they didn't accept any form of insurance from U.S. citizens. Maybe I spoke with the wrong people who weren't aware, or it is pay up front and then try to get reimbursed from a travelers policy if I had one. Both hospitals told us we would have to pay up front to be seen"" I checked the GeoBlue policy and it looks like you would have to pay upfront and then file a claim with the insurance company."

5530050,Shellback,2017-05-08 13:21:00,8083,"I checked the wife and my US Healthcare supplemental policy and found we have the coverage you do also. I was going to let it go at that, but the wife just took a fall at home this morning. Looks like Joe Frazier gave her a right hook! She has MS and it's getting worse. We have 3 trips planned for Canada this year, although 2 are just across the St Lawrence from the US, 20 minutes from a US hospital. Been there, done that! I'd better check on the Geoblue plans for a July trip to Chapleau, ON."

Now that we are older it seems to be more of an issue but accidents and health issues can happen whether your 30 or 60. I hope we never have to use it when we're up there but you never know. I don't know what healthcare costs in Canada but I will assume it's not as expensive as here in the States. Maybe one of our Canadian friends can chime in on that."
5530490,thawk9455,2017-05-08 16:26:00,343,"Just looked up my insurance. When traveling internationally I'm required to pay upfront and then submit any billing and documentation on services rendered. They have up to 30 days to review it and then reimburse me directly (minus any deductibles). I suspect just like anything else out of network, they would probably prefer I call them first unless taking the time to call might put me at risk. Even in the US things can be tricky. Walking home from dinner three hours after we arrived in Asheville, NC my wife had a freak accident that ended with a stick going about 1.5 inches into the top of her foot. We assessed the situation and drove to the ER (you know it's unique when the doctor asks if they can take a picture). Hospital wasn't used to the more local insurance company and entered the info under a different company name. It will be covered, but we're still waiting to hear it is sorted out. Quick end to a planned hiking and biking trip though..."
5531010,WVangler,2017-05-08 19:12:00,14,"Thanks from me too Bstar, I will definitely check it out for this years trip. After the close call we had I've been paranoid since then. I had went for years and had never given it a thought."

5526538,Bstar,2017-05-06 15:10:00,564,This topic may have been covered before but does anybody take out medical travel insurance when they go to Canada? Our group did on our last trip. We took out a GeoBlue group plan that cost about $30 pp. Any thoughts?
5527378,Shotgun,2017-05-07 06:33:00,759,"May not be a bad investment in this situation. My understanding is - if your on Medicare it does not cover you except for some special instances when outside the US. If you have a Medicare supplement, it covers $50,000 lifetime. A week's worth of insurance for an additional $50,000 for a 65 year old is around $40. If someone has a different view or experience with Medicare coverage, please share it."
5527426,Bstar,2017-05-07 07:18:00,564,I don't think our medical insurance will cover us in a foreign country. I'll have to check with my carrier. Two in our group are covered under US medicare with supplement coverage. The short term trip coverage is relatively inexpensive so we'll probably take it out anyway. Anybody out there ever have an accident or medical emergency while in Canada? Just wondering what the outcome was financially.
5527554,Shellback,2017-05-07 08:32:00,8083,"The wife and I are or Medicare, and have US Healthcare as a supplement. Anybody know off hand if the supplement covers you in Canada, or if there is an option to buy coverage from US Healthcare?"
5527578,martinbns,2017-05-07 08:40:00,1520,"If something happens to you up here you will be treated whether you have it or not, but you will get a bill. Think for a minute, you are in Red Lake or on Lac Seul and you have a heart attack. You would be treated at a sub hospital or nursing station then transported to either Winnipeg or Thunder Bay if it was required. Probably by helipcopter, your stuff and buddies would be left behind to drive to be with you. Every minute of every day you are being treated until you are stablizied then transported home by Ambulance to the US. You are nuts to not have it. I have it actually double for when we travel, first through my work benefits program and then through my Gold Amex. The trick with the Credit Card or one you just buy for a trip is they don't cover pre-existing conditions. Strongly recommend as we get older if we travel a lot, putting a fulltime, permanent solution in place, that way the pre-existing thing isn't a killer. Not sure about the US, but most Banks in Canada sell travel insurance that is pretty cheap or CAA."
5527666,Shotgun,2017-05-07 09:18:00,759,"Shellback, reference my earlier post in regard to your questions.Additional insurance for a week of fishing in Canada is not expensive. https://www.geobluetravelinsurance.c...t_overview.cfm"
5527730,Guest,2017-05-07 10:06:00,0,"Call your insurance and get specifics on your coverage. That's the only way to know. At the very least you may want air evac coverage. I hosed my knee in MX, spent the night in a decent clinic/ hospital. The bill was 4K, cheap by us standards. I put it on AmEx, got a detailed bill and diagnosis, my HMO reimbursed me promptly. I was able to fly back on commercial carrier, if I needed specialized air transport it would have been on my dime. The only way to know YOUR coverage is call your provider"
5529002,Bstar,2017-05-08 05:55:00,564,"I checked my wife's medicare supplement insurance with United Healthcare and it WILL cover 80% of emergency medical care expenses while traveling in a foreign country. It has a lifetime limitation of $50,000. This may be true with most if not all Medicare supplement insurance plans. Check with your carrier to be safe. I also have United Healthcare through my work and it also will provide coverage for emergency medical care in a foreign country. We will probably take out the GeoBlue Voyager Choice travel insurance anyway since it does cover medical evacuation and pre-existing conditions. You never know what might happen. It's worth the $30-40 pp."
5529370,SSH,2017-05-08 08:25:00,526,"I have purchased Atlas Travel Insurance (Tokiomarine) several times, but luckily haven't needed to use it. It runs about $35 for a week and you can choose the amount of coverage you may need. https://www.hccmis.com/"
5529610,WVangler,2017-05-08 10:08:00,14,"Interesting thread. I have also considered insurance for traveling to Canada. My wife had an issue a couple years ago while we were in Canada. I calllled the two closest hospitals and were told they didn't accept any form of insurance from U.S. citizens. Maybe I spoke with the wrong people who weren't aware, or it is pay up front and then try to get reimbursed from a travelers policy if I had one. Both hospitals told us we would have to pay up front to be seen. Luckily, she ended up getting by with medicine we had on hand and didn't have to go. One was in Ontario and the other in Quebec, both were about the same distance from where we were staying. Be interesting to hear from someone that had taken out a policy and had used it while in Canada."
