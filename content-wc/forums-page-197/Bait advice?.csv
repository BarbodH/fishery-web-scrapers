Minnows produce well, but are expensive - I usually get a couple dozen minnows during the week, and have never done any better than we did with the leeches / crawlers, etc. I agree with using 1/2 crawlers, both on jigs and slow death or Lindy rigs, especially if you are used to minnows and the timing of hook sets, etc.You can use anything, but I think the recommendation for crawlers is financial, but you wouldn't be getting that advice unless they were productive either. You are getting good advice."
5530434,IronDioPriest,2017-05-08 16:02:00,96,"I got invited last minute to accompany some friends of my dad to Lac Des Mille Lacs in Ontario the very beginning of June. The fellas I'm going up with are talking about using nightcrawlers for bait. I called the lodge owner with some questions, and he brought up crawlers as well - as if I should just know that crawlers are the bait I should use. In spring and fall, I'm a jig-and-minnow guy - lindy-rig when conditions warrant. I don't really like fishing with crawlers, but when I do so, it's usually in summer. Looking for advice from guys who've fished this lake... Is there something unique about Lac Des Mille Lacs that makes nightcrawlers the bait of preference at this time of year, or is that just what these fellas I'm fishing with like to use?"
5530754,phishfearme,2017-05-08 17:44:00,1242,to me it's simply a cost and convenience thing. minnows cannot be beat for effectiveness but they are very expensive and hard to keep. we have found that crawlers do just fine thank you - no need to bother with minnows. you may want to try the salted minnow route - make your own - do a search and fine some great processes. phish
5530842,drlee,2017-05-08 18:16:00,409,"I have not fished that particular lake, but do fish that general area around that time of year. We have used salt minnows, crawlers, leeches, live minnows. Long story short, they all work well. We typically jig vertically or drift as a method with all of these baits. Trolling does not happen as often, but does not change our preference for baits. Preference? Yeah, probably crawlers. We split them into two parts, you can avoid the dirt by putting 1/2 doz. at a time in a plastic cup 1/2 full of water. I ALWAYS buy these at Larry's Bait Shop in Kakabeka Falls. (807)473-9321. I typically call ahead and buy either a 1/2 flat or a full flat. (His shop is next to the liquor store on the left side of the highway). I usually call ahead by a couple of weeks, but he always says I don't need to. The owners of both of the camps I go to swear by Larry, and won't buy crawlers anywhere else. Leeches are equally as effective and can sometimes be better. Salt minnows are a bit less consistent, but are pretty easy to take care of. Live minnows are a pain in the...and frankly, not worth the hassle/expense. I know this: You will have a great time fishing!"
5531602,Guest,2017-05-09 05:45:00,0,"I will agree that crawlers can be an excellent bait, but there have been times where the walleye would not hit a crawler, but would hit every minnow or Gulp minnow we sent their way. I even tried switching after a 10 for 10 run and changed from Gulp to a half crawler and went 0 for 5. Switched back to Gulp and caught fish on the next cast. We have switched to the 3"" Gulp Alive artificial vs. minnows. Actually not that much less in total cost vs. buying minnows, but they normally allow you to catch 5 to 10 fish per and this allows you to fish more and bait less. We also bring up a flat of crawlers and pick them up before crossing in International Falls. They have them ready for crossing the border. Best of luck. We will be on Lac Seul this year."
5531738,Baseline,2017-05-09 06:31:00,3207,"I've only fished Lac Des Mille Lacs on two occasions, but frequently fish this area of Ontario. Like you I'm a jig an minnow guy, but I use lots of crawlers as a way to cut the minnow budget and that they are easier to keep alive. You can also bring in crawlers purchased in US as long as they are packed in paper. I break the crawler in half and feed it on the jig leaving a tag end to dangle from the end of the hook. This usually works as well as a minnow, especially if the walleyes are eager."
5531778,Twodogs,2017-05-09 06:38:00,115,I've fished Lac Des Mille Lac for over 30 years..Early years we always went the second week of the opener now we go the 4th week....weather and temps more to my liking... Minnows have far out fished worms for us. We stay at Lac Des Mille Lodge....pm me if you have any questions.
5532042,Ver88,2017-05-09 07:56:00,114,"I have not fished that particular lake, but I would forget natural bait altogether and just use soft plastics. I have not fished a lake where plastics did not work, and in most cases work just as well as minnows or crawlers. With plastics you don't have to deal with keeping bait alive or buying expensive Canadian bait. Plus you can catch many fish per plastic and don't have to check your bait constantly."
5532122,IronDioPriest,2017-05-09 08:24:00,96,"This will be only my 2nd time on this lake. The first was about 20 years ago with the same bunch of guys, and honestly I can't remember what bait we used. I also go to Lac Seul annually, and all we use there is the 3"" Gulp Alive minnow. If I can use the same thing on Lac Des Mille Lacs and get results, that's exactly what I'd prefer to do. Obviously I want to do whatever catches fish, but all things being equal, if Gulp works, I prefer that for Walleyes every time."
5532402,mjayn,2017-05-09 10:43:00,1188,"We used to bring a flat of crawlers bought in Minnesota. I never really used them, I did just as well(on other lakes) with artificial. I might not have used them, but I did bring some everyday in case we did want to use them. We would put the days crawlers in ice water for 30min to plump them up in the morning or night before then transfer them to a plastic bag and put on the ice. No mess and they were frisky all day. Thats how I keep shrimp too, in a plastic bag with a little water to keep them wet(no ice water bath for the shrimp), then bag goes on ice, very easy, spunky shrimp all day."
5533514,ILScott,2017-05-09 19:48:00,139,My group uses crawlers on a spinner rig with a slow death hook. Works wonders
