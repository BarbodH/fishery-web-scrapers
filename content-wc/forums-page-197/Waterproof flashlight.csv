I thought we just had to carry what our state registration required.Just looked on this site, https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafet...sitor-1610.htmHere's what they say about boats not registered in CanadaSafety Equipment RequirementsForeign pleasure craft (pleasure craft that are licensed or registered in a country other than Canada) need to comply with equipment requirements of the country in which the vessel is usually kept.If you are not a resident of Canada and are using a pleasure craft licensed or registered in Canada, all of the required safety equipment must meet Canadian safety requirements. However, you may opt to bring your own PFD for your own personal use."

5521730,Golden Eagle,2017-05-04 08:18:00,2642,"Love my Fenix. One lives in my tackle bag, along with 4 extra (tested) batteries. The other is within reach when I'm sleeping.Mine are 230 lumens. Will check into the 900 lumens Fenix that you have.Fenix is priced well for the quality of the product."
5521922,Ricky Spanish,2017-05-04 10:01:00,1298,Really no different than requiring you to register your car in the States when you cross the border. Still funny?
5524178,123chadder,2017-05-05 10:01:00,429,its a UC35 i believe....rechargeable too...
5473234,Guest,2017-04-14 10:42:00,0,"One of the requirements to have in the boat is a waterproof flashlight. For the past 8 years, I've bought an inexpensive 6V ""waterproof"" flashlight...that is essentially disposable, as it doesn't last. I'm thinking of getting a decent one instead (feel bad for throwing these things out every year)...any recommendations? -42"
5473242,pjshorthorn,2017-04-14 10:51:00,5654,"I have carried Maglites for years, but I bought my son a Coast brand flashlight that has a very high lumen rating with a pulse feature that would be recognizable from a long distance in the event of an emergency. It is bright !!!! PjShorthorn"
5473290,Hot Runr Guy,2017-04-14 11:19:00,16061,This has worked well for me.http://www.rayovac.com/products/ligh...spotlight.aspx HRG
5473562,David Anderson,2017-04-14 13:43:00,2073,"I have this in my boat, it is excellent. Charges with a standard cell phone charger and is bright enough to act as a spotlight if needed. It is amazingly inexpensive and the quality is excellent, it is incredible how bright it is. In addition it has an SOS function and 4 levels of brightness. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
5474722,Baseline,2017-04-15 06:18:00,3207,"I have a Larry Light. It's inexpensive, LED, runs on AA batteries, floats, magnetic, and has pocket clip. Very bright. I own three or four of them. http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/p...FREoaQodS0sOKA"
5474842,halfmoon007,2017-04-15 07:09:00,121,"This narrows options down. one of our boats got stopped by MNR and checked. The officer said does it float, and my buddy said I don't know and threw it over board. He got lucky and it did.Here is what i put in my Kit. bought at amazon, I keep a coast led in my tackle box for all other uses.

5483426,Aspencreek,2017-04-18 14:02:00,2911,"Kind of makes sense that the flashlight kept in the boat would float and be waterproof/tight. I just got one from the marine store But the real workhorse is the ""Atomic Light"" I got at Home depot for less than $20."
5486730,yoopertrout,2017-04-19 17:15:00,1172,"Some of the Princeton tech headlamps are waterproof. I don't know if they'd be bright enough for your purposes, but the hands free part is nice."
5517826,agress15,2017-05-02 14:44:00,13,"Redline by NEBO is another good one, they have multiple settings to conserve battery and strobe and S.O.S settings. Some of them are waterproof and you can get them at Batteries and Bulbs or I have seen them on Amazon also."
5518050,prov1800,2017-05-02 15:47:00,5010,"Just buy a cdn marine safety kit.it has all the items required to be in the boat.forget how much it is.ive had mine for years.comes in a waterproof orange pail.can be used as a bail bucket.has the whistle,fliating rope and the flaslight has a battery in it.i just check the battery or basically i just change it every year.i have been stopped a number of times an the opp told me the flashlight better work.lol."
