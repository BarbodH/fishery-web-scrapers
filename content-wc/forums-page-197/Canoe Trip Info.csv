5025153,Ogoki,2016-07-28 07:58:00,291,"I have canoed in Quetico and Wabakimi. I much prefer Wabakimi. As there you have river systems . In Quetico , where I have been anyway, was lakes and long portages between lakes . On a river system you have two things that I much prefer. You portage around rapids , eliminating long over land portages . Then as you probably already know , walleye like moving water so you fish the moving water. Just my preference anyway. The draw back from Wabakimi is that you have a long paddle thru Caribou Lake to access the actual park. Or take train going west from Armstrong and paddle back. Or fly in and fly out. More expensive . If you have four people and two canoes , they will use an Otter and the cost split four ways . That is my preference , but more costly. I use Don Elliot of Mattice Lake Outfitters . Don is super knowledgeable of that area and can give you many options . I have been using MLO for 18 years and Don has never let me down. Don't want to sound like an advertisement for MLO, other than I am a very satisfied customer. I used 5 other outfitters and MLO is my favorite."

5482218,Fishoil,2017-04-18 07:55:00,1277,"The whole North Road is Gary's driveway, from Pickle Lake all the way to the trailer he lived in at Windigo Lake, something like 165 miles."
5482746,Herkyhawk00,2017-04-18 10:08:00,33,I agree. Look at Hearst Air. Mike Borger did a write up on his 10 day excursion. Looks like something you may be interested in.
5525538,Eyesore,2017-05-06 05:42:00,455,"Thanks, but I'm pretty sure that Garys take out spot Len mentioned is far more specific than the ""165 miles"" between Pickle Lake and Windigo."
5009673,wally28,2016-07-21 17:57:00,65,Buddy and I are planning a 7-10 day float trip in Ontario. And am having a time finding a good remote rive to float. We have been fishing White Lake for 6 years and looking for a new adventure.We've crossed the Shekak between Hornepayne and Oba which looked good. Any info will be greatly appreciated.Thanks
5010249,123chadder,2016-07-21 21:06:00,429,if you are looking for a real adventure try the sutton river
5011265,Fishoil,2016-07-22 10:15:00,1277,"You need to talk to Mike Borger, he'll point you in the right direction."
5011697,wally28,2016-07-22 13:19:00,65,"ey, thanks who is Mike?"
5011713,LoDo,2016-07-22 13:20:00,721,Woodland Caribou Prov Park is great!! Have fun!!
5011857,Fishoil,2016-07-22 13:59:00,1277,"He's a member of this site under his name. He's paddled most of the rivers that you would be interested in and is very gracious and helpful if you ask him for information. I'm surprised he hasn't already seen this thread and responded, must be gone fishing. If you go into the member profiles you will find him listed and can send him a private message. You could also just find one of his posts and click on his name."
5012081,chris.brock,2016-07-22 15:47:00,112,"What's important to you Wally28? the fishing, scenery, whitewater etc The Missinaibi from Mattice (near Hearst) is a classic trip. You start from highway 11 and paddle north leaving civilization behind, and flag down the train at Moose River Crossing to get out."
5012585,wally28,2016-07-22 19:05:00,65,Actually all the above with white water a minimum. I will check it out. Thanks much!!
5013569,lenray,2016-07-23 08:03:00,467,Put in at Stirland and come down thru the Pipestone and come out at Gary's Driveway 100 miles north of the village of Pickle Lake. Great fishing along the way. Some come from foreign countries to take this trip and there is a better than 90% chance you will never seen anyone. True wilderness area....................
5015233,wally28,2016-07-23 21:08:00,65,"Hey thanks; I've been researching this and it is doable. Once we take out at Garys how do we get back ? Again, thanks much."
