5529578,Jdolan89,2017-05-08 09:50:00,1,Looking for Sat Phone Rental recommendations. We will be at Wabakimi Lake in June. In the past we have always rented the phone from our Outfitter just in case of emergencies but that phone could only call the outfitter. This trip is going to be a bit different as we are taking our wives with us. My wife is nervous about not being able to check in with our kids. I think she will enjoy the trip a lot more if we can call home to check in on the kids a couple of times during the trip. Paying for peace of mind What are the best options available? I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you!
