5519290,bob888,2017-05-03 08:22:00,244,I'm curious if there are active resorts and or marina in the lower part of Sabaskosing Bay. I've had no luck in searching on the internet for resorts or marina in that area. See pic

5520634,Lotw1,2017-05-03 19:28:00,36,I get what your looking at from that picture now. I don't know what that is but I don't make it up that way very often. Maybe someone from the northwest angle would know.

The lower left one is not there at all, maybe an old cabin that is falling down or completely down, again, I am pretty sure. I know of guys that have stayed at the Bell Island Outpost. I have fished in and around that bay a few times."
5524674,bob888,2017-05-05 12:45:00,244,Thanks for the reply on Bells Island Outpost and the marina. We often run from Sabaskong Bay to Little Traverse Bay and are a little leery of being in that in case an accident occurs. Certainly the Little Traverse Bay area has considerably less anglers in that area. Am aware there is a resort (Reel Em Inn Lodge) on the south east corner of the island. Just was not sure of any resorts were on the northern part of Little Traverse area.
