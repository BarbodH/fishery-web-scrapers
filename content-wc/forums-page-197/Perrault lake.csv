I have fished a few of these lakes that chain together.We fished out of Gold Arrow camp. They have small boats on 10 lakes or so and you carry your gear to the lake you want to fish, including your 9.9 motor and gas. It is fun, but kind of a pain in the rear. Sometimes even hauling your boat across beaver dams and stuff. A lot of these lakes are small dishes. Basically the structure just slopes about the same angle from shore everywhere. A lot of spinner rig trolling at 12-14ft. I dont know if Perrault is the same or not. We now go about 20-30 minutes north of there to Ear Falls. I personally would take the time to go a bit north and fish Lac Suel or Pakwash Lake. The little bit of extra drive has paid off for us with much better fishing."

You'll find a lake with very good fishing for walleye, smallmouth, and northern. I don't fish musky but they are there. If you can find the perch they are a very nice bonus. The lake is small enough to be comfortable even in unfriendly weather and big enough to give you lots of options. I've stayed at Manotak. Friends have stayed at Perrault Lake Camp. We are all very happy with our choices. I've also heard good things about the other camps on the lake (Rocky Shores and Rainbow Lodge). I don't think you can go wrong."

5498057,Mojo-NC,2017-04-25 08:11:00,1929,"Another WC guy (BornToFish) actually wrote a book titled ""Secrets of the Canadian Shield: An Angler's Guide to Perrault Lake"". I recently purchased a copy from him and it is a good read for anyone who fishes the shield lakes of NW Ontario. It would be especially helpful for you because he summarizes his learnings from fishing Perrault Lake over the last 15 years, identifying specific areas of the lake and seasonal patterns. Shoot him a PM."
5498801,team walleye,2017-04-25 11:54:00,336,I have been fishing Perrault since 2003. I absolutely love the lake. Also never have heard anything bad about any of the camps. No need to go to the big lake up north in my opinion. But we are also talking NE Ontario.. the worst option is still pretty good.
