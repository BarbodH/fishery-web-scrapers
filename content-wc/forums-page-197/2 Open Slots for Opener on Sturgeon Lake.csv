We have a modern cabin on the north end of Sturgeon Lake near town of Savant Lake NW Ontario. This is a drive in camp (bring your own boat) We have a 3-bedroom cabin with 1 room available with 2 beds. We’re bringing 2 boats and fish 2 to a boat. If you meet us at camp and bring your own boat the cost would be about $500 for Cabin, Food, dock rental and bait for week. You’d pay for your own license and gas up and back. This has always been a fantastic week to fish on Sturgeon for us as were coming up on 30 years of making this trip. Were all retired and make it a relaxed week, on the water by 8am would be early for us. Send me a PM if you might be interested. They do offer boat rentals but that would be at your expense."
