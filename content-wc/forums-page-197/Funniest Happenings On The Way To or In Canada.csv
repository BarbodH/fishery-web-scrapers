A guy in the next cabin says ""is that your boat with the motor running at the dock?"" It was just after I had traded my old 2-stroke for a new Yamaha 4-stroke. Everybody had told me they were a lot quieter than my old 2-stroke, and it was."

Our driver, who gets really nervous crossing the border cant handle the pressure when the guard asks, bringing any fish back? We don't bring fish back - just eat our fill in camp. The driver blurts out ""blueberries"" (We had about a gallon, since they were so plentiful that year). The guard pauses, then says ""What did you catch them on?"""

I had driven about 20 hours and was getting very sleepy. We pulled over at a rest area for bathroom break. While going standing at the urinal, I fell asleep and managed to get front of my pants wet. Everyone got a good laugh out of that."

I always make a point of being courteous and only answer the questions I am asked with no joking around. The guard asked the usual questions, where are we going, for how long etc. The thing was he had a strong French accent and I had a little problem understanding what he was saying. He asked what was our main purpose for coming to Canada. I replied fishing. Then he asked another question and I couldn't understand what he said. So I said excuse me? He asked the question again. I looked over at my buddy to see if he could help. He gave a shrug because he couldn't understand either. I turned back to the guard and nervously apologized that I couldn't understand what he was saying. He said you mean your main purpose for coming to Canada wasn't to see my smiling face? He had to see and enjoy the relief that came across my face when I realized he was joking. He told us to have a good trip and sent us on our way."
5311857,Guest,2017-02-03 17:21:00,0,"Background: My son and I sleep at the Anchor Lake (MN) rest area Friday night, and cross the border at International Falls Saturday morning. I have Green Bay Packer license plates on my truck. Last year, we got to the rest area late and I didn't get much sleep--still half zombie at the border. Border guard added this question: ""So, a Packers fan, eh?"" I said, ""Yes, sir."" He then asked why I had a big Vikings sticker on my tailgate. ""Whaa...?? I...um...what?"" He gives me the stern eye and says, ""I asked you to explain the large Vikings sticker on your tailgate, sir."" I'm at a complete loss. Did some rascal slap a sticker on my truck while I was sleeping? How would I explain that, and the fact that I didn't notice? He then says, ""Just messing with you. Enjoy your stay."" I told him that he really had me going, I was completely lost. He says, ""I know. Should have seen yourself."" Among the biggest mental/emotional swings I've ever had. Story #2: It's our first year going up, just my 8 year old son and I, in late July. I tend to be over-prepared, so in April I went to Farm & Fleet to pick up a spare spare tire (yes, I meant to duplicate that word--I bought a 2nd spare in case the first one died). Get to the counter to ask for the tire, the dude asks me if I need a 4-lug or 5-lug rim. I have no idea. Sheepishly, I say ""be right back"" and step outside to call my daughter at home to go look. She says 4, so I go back to the counter and get my extra spare. Fast forward to late July, somewhere between Superior and Anchor Lake. Blowout on the trailer--the tire is confetti on a rim when I pull over. HA! No problem, I'll grab my brand new spare!! Won't even have to wrestle with the 851,369,174,841 threads on the U-bolt to get the old spare off! Grab the jack, the wrenches and my shiny new spare and walk back to what's left of the failed tire...to discover that it's a 5-lug rim. In the brief span of time during which I was imagining some very creative ways to get fatherly revenge on my daughter, that *$^&% U-bolt managed to grow about 18"" in length just so that I'd have even more threads to pull the nuts off of. New (old) tire mounted, called the wife to ask her to find a tire store between wherever we were and the border and call me back. She got distracted by something and forgot. Gassing up in Dryden, I asked where I could get a tire, got directions, went to the tire shop. Walked in with the finally-cooled-off confetti rim and the dude behind the counter asks how he can help me. I show him the ""tire"" and say, ""um, this one leaks. Can you help?"" He laughs and says they'll throw a patch on it, good as new. We both got a chuckle out of that. He sold me a new tire--and then took my 4-lug as a straight-up trade on another new spare. Granted, I had from April until late July to look for myself to make sure that I needed a 4-lug...but I pretty much had assumed that my teen daughter could actually count to 5. I still harass her about it, and it's been years! -42"

I put it in the basket with the rest of the contents of my pockets and the US Customs Officer tells me I can't bring it into the US. I reply sorry, in Canada it's ok to fly with one bic lighter, she replies she wishes Canada would take the War on Terror seriously. She wasn't kidding, and very seriously thought me and my Bic lighter was contributing to World Terrorism, she was in her 50's and looked like Flo from the 1970's show Alice."
5320809,Pooch,2017-02-08 10:44:00,4618,"In the late 1990's we were on Route Lake using camp boats. The last day of the trip Old Bob and Old Ray took my (camp) boat so I could fish with one of the other guys. Now Bob & Ray were the kind of older guys that would get hung up on discussing why this or that was wrong with the cabin construction or the right and wrong way to restore windshield wiper blades. They were peas in a pod. SO anyway, when Wayne and I went to pay our bill with the camp they had a truly demolished prop setting on the table and said it came off of one of our boats. Wayne and I were totally blindsided, but went ahead and paid for the prop.Get back to the cabin and ask if anyone had damaged a prop. Everyone looks at each other then either Bob or Ray mentions that they were trying to figure out why all the fish on the depth finder were all swimming the same way and forgot the boat was in reverse. (They had even turned on the fish ID on my old Eagle unit) Backed into the rocky shore, panicked and hit the throttle. They both told us it seemed like the boat was slower and really made a lot of foam after that.I wish I had a picture of the prop. I have never seen a prop literally flattened out. I can't believe that the boat would actually still go forward.Everyone in this little story (but for me) has passed on now so it is special memory to me and always will be. Sure wish I actually had that prop on my desk now. Really miss those guys.Pooch"

He is half out of his guard shack when all of a sudden He starts flailing his arms Yelling and pointing at uncle Johnnie.We sit behind and are thinking O boy this is bad! this goes on for 4 or 5 minutes, the he hands them their passports back and the pull away. Then we pull up and he asks us were we been and we answer the same lake, fishing etc. and he says I suppose you don't have any pike. Simple answer NO SIR were walleye fisherman. He shakes his head in disgust and hands us our passports and said your good to go. well we stop 1 mile down the road from customs for a tank of gas and a burger at Wendys and we get out and ask uncle Johnnie what was that all about. He responds We pulled up and he starts all the normal questions then asks fish? uncle Johnnie responds 6 walleyes . He asks any pike and Uncle J responds I wouldn't bring those slimy b**strds back. well that's when the old boy went off! Ill fillet them pike and cook them and they will taste better than any walleye and he went on and on about it to Uncle J. what a laugh that day. In the last few years Ive been traveling with uncle J to nakina and when we pull up to the customs guard I just pray to god he answers yes sir no sir . But you never know with Johnnie.

5321761,Carnhzkr,2017-02-08 18:16:00,964,"I’ll tell one of my stories, but I have a feeling this might get wordy because each time I tell it I embellish more and more, so if you’re not up to reading a long post I’ll give you a few minutes to leave this thread… Are they gone now? Good, I never liked any of those guys anyway. We were heading north into a very desolate area of Manitoba along with my mom and dad, not so many years ago. My dad, being a worry-wart decided to bring along a spare spare for the trailer, similar to a previous post on this thread. I’m more of leap before you look kind of guy, so I thought the old man was being overly cautious, but it was his rig and we had room so what the heck. We hadn’t gotten too far into Manitoba when I heard a boom and looked in the mirror in time to see a cloud of smoke and debris shoot into the air coming from the boat trailer. Crap! Oh well, 15 minutes later I was wiping grease off of my hands and once again heading north (one down, two to go). The next episode didn’t happen until we’d set out on our return trip. Perhaps some of you may be familiar with Quesnel / Manigotagan lakes. If you are, you know that the 11 miles leading to the lodge is some of the worst road on the planet. It was on this stretch, on our way home, where the next mishap occurred. When I walked back to inspect, I could see a large hole opened up in the trailer tire, apparently from one of the 10,000 jagged rocks I’d driven over. You know, maybe the old man was smarter than I’d given him credit for. With the tire once again changed, down the road we headed thinking lightning can’t possibly strike the same place three times. Care to guess what happens next?You are correct! Driving along the rural, flat prairie land of Manitoba, not so far north of Winnipeg lightning did again strike. Like the first time, this was a major blowout. Boom! The black debris of tire shrapnel shot into the air. When I pulled to the side of the road to inspect the damage, I saw that the flapping tire rubber curled the metal trailer fender like the lid of a sardine can. What remained of the tire resembled Bob Marley’s dreadlocks. It’s at this point that panic begins to set in. This is the point when I try to convince myself that the situation sucks right now, but eventually this tragedy will join the ranks of other seemingly horrible situations that get retold with laughter whenever the family gets together, but that day seemed long into the future. For now, we were just trying to figure out what to do next.We notice if we continue forward then turn left, there’s a farmhouse in the distance. If we can leave the damaged trailer there we’ll drive into Winnipeg to pick up a new tire and spend the night, then return the next morning and be on our way. So we limp along on Bob Marley’s hair to the farm house. Easing down the gravel driveway, I can see this is no ordinary farm. There are a couple of old corn cribs. One contains brightly colored golden pheasants and the other has red pheasants. On the other side of the lane is a pen with a miniature donkey and horse. I park and proceed to the house and am immediately swarmed by dogs and cats of various sizes and colors. I figure we’re in luck because there is a truck in the driveway and I can hear music coming from inside the house. I knock on the door and wait, but there’s no answer. I pound this time, but still no response, so I stand outside an open window and shout, “anyone home”? I hear a man’s voice saying, “Sean, I think someone’s at the door”, and I’m soon greeted by Sean who’s wearing nothing but pajama bottoms. I explain our predicament and ask if it’d be okay if we leave the boat for the night. Lance eventually comes to the door to join the conversation. They’re both extremely accommodating and as helpful as they can be, offering advice on the best place to go to find a tire store and a hotel. When we return the next morning, Lance is busily working on our fender and has it nearly pounded back into shape. The two gentlemen couldn’t have been any nicer and before we left, they gave us a tour of their farm. I got up close and personal with a miniature donkey, a pot-bellied pig, a golden pheasant and a ferret. Then we were on our way.I’ll never forget my naïve, 80 year old dad ask as we reached the end of their driveway, “do you think those guys are homosexuals”? Gee, I dunno dad, two guys living on a farm in northern Manitoba raising exotic birds and miniature horses? I suppose it’s possible."

They're very much appreciated by me. @labsrus: I hope you have many many more years of wonderful fishing trips with your wife as your best fishing buddy. Cherish each trip. Make memories to last a lifetime for both of you. Take pictures and video of as many trips as you can to help with those memories. Though I lost her early, and young, I too was blessed in having my wife as my best fishing buddy. The best moments of my entire life were spent with her in a fishing boat. Moments that, while some of the details now fade from memory, I will nonetheless cherish for as long as I live. She never once said to me, ""You're NOT going fishing this weekend!!"" Instead she'd say to me, ""Will you take me fishing this weekend?"" How could I say no? lol @ Mojo-NC Yeah, there's no reason to end the thread on my story. I appreciate the sentiment of that gesture by you, but keep the stories coming. None of us want to miss out on a great funny story or another poignant one like mine. This forum is for everyone to share so don't let me be a party pooper and end it all. I'm sorry your wife doesn't go with you on your Canadian trips. You have my sympathy for that. I don't know, maybe you can talk her into going to one of the really fancy resorts that offer fine dining and more to do than just fishing? Treat her to some luxury and relaxation and a hot tub. That might be enough to get her there and then once there she can see the beauty of the area and see how nice it is to be in a boat with you. That is all I can suggest to help your situation. Then you wouldn't have to put up with the group you do go with."
5454018,jimwalleye,2017-04-05 16:55:00,30,"Our group of ten had been going to Lac Des Mille Lac for more years than I can count. The fisherman changed a bit over the years but we always appointed a treasurer to account for the money and pay the bills. Harold was getting up in his years but was a good business man and had owned the PURE OIL station in the town of Britt, Iowa, so appointing him the treasurer was a good choice. On the way home from the trip, we stopped at the Pigeon River Crossing and filled up with gas. Harold being treasurer paid the bill and we were on our way back to Iowa. Harold was sitting in the back seat of my Dad's 79 Park Avenue Buick, and shortly after leaving the border, after we had filled with gas for the return trip, he exclaims, ""Stop, I left the bank bank with the money at the border,"" So we turned around and returned to Rydels and looked for the bank bank with about $800 still in the bag, but we never did find it. Harold, taking his responsibilities seriously, insisted on replenishing the bank bag to the tune of the missing $800, despite our groups insistence that he not worry about it. Our group ordered a custom engraved wallet for Harold complete with a chain to affix to his belt and he used if for many years after that incident on our annual trip up North, because our group had voted Harold to be treasurer for as long as he continued on the trip in the succeeding years. That 79 Buick was a heck of a car with a huge engine in it that never even noticed the boat it was pulling. Dad kept that car for twenty years, and Harold had long ago passed on to a better life. Dad complained one day that the CB radio antenna that he had installed on the Buick to talk to the other cars on the way to Canada was not working anymore, so he took the car into the dealer and they tried to trace the antenna wires which ran back behind the rear seat and into the trunk. Low and behold after the seat was removed twenty years later we found the bank bag with the money still in the bag. Harold was long gone but our group was still going on fishing trips so our group gave the money in the bag to Harold's son Jim, a retired Commander in the Navy who also went with us on the same fishing trip every year. I'm sure Harold was looking down and saying, thanks you finally found the ""MONEY""."
5454810,fishpoop,2017-04-06 01:33:00,630,"That is a great story, funny, touching, and poignant. Looks to me like it was preordained that Jim got the money."
5454818,fishpoop,2017-04-06 02:07:00,630,"I know this is supposed to be a light hearted funny thread with stories about crossing the border to fish in Canada but I thought I should make a serious follow up post about my last trip with my wife. For those who might be wondering, or sadly facing making a similar trip with a terminally ill person I thought I should provide a bit more information and a bit of advice. I'm not a health care professional or a lawyer, I can only speak from my experience. There's three things to consider when traveling abroad with a terminally ill person, 1. Medical Information, 2. Legal Information, 3. Financial/Insurance Information. 1. Medical Info: Before we left home my wife and I consulted with her doctors and asked about her leaving the country. They provided us with letters from her Neurosurgeon and Neuro-Oncologist. These letters detailed her diagnosis, prognosis, current medical condition based upon their most recent exam which was the week before the trip, recommended treatment if any was required, and finally a full list of her many medications and dosages. The med list is important not only for any foreign doctor to have should it be needed but also for the border guards to avoid suspicion of smuggling narcotics into the country. We only smuggled potatoes!! lol 2. Legal Info: Note, this was back in the days before a passport requirement to cross the border. We had legal copies of her birth certificate, my birth certificate, our marriage licence, her Advanced Health Care Directive/Living Will, and my Power of Attorney. These are important because if she'd had a seizure, for example, and ended up in a hospital I could legally prove who I was, the nature of our relationship, and could legally speak for her regarding any treatments that may have been provided, or forced upon her, should she not have been able to speak for herself. In other words they couldn't put a feeding tube in her without my consent and I knew she didn't want that. 3. Financial/Insurance: Before leaving home we talked to our health insurance provider and asked about coverage should something happen on the trip. This way we wouldn't put a burden on Health Canada or Ontario health system and also for our financial protection too so we wouldn't be financially wiped out by hospital bills from Canada because the insurance refused to pay for foreign medical expenses. It turned out ok. She had a good trip and nothing bad happened and none of this information was needed but we were prepared just in case. I hope no one reading this needs this kind of information but I thought I should post it just in case, because one never knows who might be in a similar situation. Now, back to the funny stuff."

"" In my mind, things went into slow motion.....Oh chit, we are going to get pulled over and be here for a very long time. The border agent started laughing and says she was doing fine. "" You guys get out of here and have a good trip"". We were never asked a question other than where we were going. As far as my fishing experiences in Canada, that has to be the fastest crossing in the history.....about 45 seconds max. I think I did almost wet myself on that occasion as well. We had some good laughs about that experience after we could start breathing again, but my uncle got the business all the way to Sioux Lookout that night. On future trips, we never let him drive when it came time to cross the border PjShorthorn"

5322929,Beer King,2017-02-09 10:06:00,146,"This happened several years ago. Fish a remote drive in lake with unimproved landing way back in the sticks. Its pretty rare but from time to time some stupid will take exception to non residents being there. We get back to the landing after a week of camping and two or our three vehicles have had paint badly keyed. For whatever reason they left mine alone. Typical childish stuff, penis pics scratched on hood, etc. On one of the drivers door they scratched in big letters ""I suck C_ _ K in his black paint. Everyone was pretty pissed about the whole thing, particularly this guy (my cousin) so not much was said. We got back out to main road and stopped for a break. I figured time to break the ice a bit so I said its really too bad this happened but what I really could not figure out is how they knew this was his truck :-). Everyone got a good chuckle, but him (he did finally smile a bit) Better yet, he drove back with this proudly displayed on his door and as luck would have it had a female border agent check him thru to MN. She never said anything to him but I bet they had a pretty good laugh later. Insurance covered their damages so all ended well and it is now one of the many Canada fishing trip stories we get a good laugh from. Yes, we keep going back there too. Dan"

My old boss was always trying to put more fish on the ice so he went out side of the shack to put up tip ups for everyones second lines. When he left, I pulled up his jigging rod that had a slip bobber on it and tied on the ice skimmer so the bobber was just 6 inches under the water. When he returned he notice his bobber was down so he set the hook and started reeling in, the ice skimmer made for a good realistic fish fight fluttering back and forth. It only took him less than a minute to bring it up from 25 feet but the whole time he was saying, **** I got a good one on, I got a good one on. When he finally reeled the ice skimmer up through the hole the laughter lasted well beyond the next few beers."

My buddies Dad who was 78 at the time and could barely walk makes a wise crack. ""hope no alarms go off or lights turn on"" If they do I will start running away faster than you guys can run.

Anyhow, on the way back across, we got stopped at the border. Standard ""pull over and come inside"". I drive forward, put it in park, turn around and tell the guys... ""absolutely no joking around in here. Be silent unless an officer asks a question."" We go in, sit down, and a couple minutes after we sit down, another guy comes in with his girlfriend. He was obviously in the same situation as us. He throws the door open, and immediately starts cussing. ""This is bull sh**! F this, F that, F them"". An officer comes over and politely says to him ""I will be with you in one second"". Then the officer turns to us and says... ""are you guys altogether?"" I tell him yes. He says, ""thanks for your cooperation, you can go. Have a safe trip"" The jerk throwing a fit had the border's UNDIVIDED attention. The seven of us quietly walked out and drove off (cost us 5 minutes maximum). I bet that other guy was there for a LONG time."

I bet that other guy was there for a LONG time.[/QUOTE]For all we know he might still be there!! lol lol The idiot. The last time I went to Ontario with my wife was August 2003. She was already 8 1/2 months into what was supposed to be a 6 month, or less, battle with terminal brain cancer. I had asked her if there was anything she wanted to do before the end came and she told me she wanted to go to Canada one more time on our yearly Muskie Inc outing to Sabaskong Bay in August. At the time she told me, in January, I didn't think she stood a prayer of going on the trip. She made it and another 10 months beyond that too before I lost her. The day of the trip came and she was having a bad day that day. She couldn't function very well as her body wasn't doing what she wanted it to do and it took her longer to do even simple tasks. Which was understandable. So it took me longer to get the truck packed and the boat hooked up and everything ready to hit the road. So it was about 3:00 pm before we left home. That meant we didn't arrive at the border at Baudette/Rainy River until around 9:00 pm or so. We didn't have any problems at the border. Customs asked the usual questions and we gave the expected usual answers, showed our ID and were sent on our way. No fuss, no muss. Just how it should be. We arrived at the resort in Morson close to 10:00 pm. Because we were so late getting there everyone else in the group was worried about us. They came over to our cabin to check on us and when they found out she was having a bad day they pitched in and helped me unload the truck. Bless their souls. I'm up in the truck bed passing things out to the helpers and I pass out a 5 pound bag of potatoes!! The gal helping out said, ""Potatoes?! How did you get potatoes across the border? They took ours!!"" She was pissed! lol lol I told her the truth, they didn't ask about potatoes and we didn't know they were prohibited that year so we didn't say anything. If the border agent had asked us about potatoes I'd have told him. He didn't ask and I didn't think about it. I've chuckled about that for years now. I'm a hardened criminal. A wanted man! An International Potato Smuggler!! lol Who knew?? A couple of years after she passed I went up to Eagle Lake Ont and crossed at I. Falls. They asked about potatoes and made me dump the three I brought with me. So I figure I'm about 50% on my potato import business, which isn't to bad I think. The lady who helped unload the truck that night, and was upset about our potatoes, has now passed away too. Over the years since my wife, Mary, passed away I've lost a number of good fishing friends. So I hope Mary, Terri, Tony, Smokey, and Perry are all together now catching the big ones and waiting for me to join them and show them how it's done... if that's possible in whatever lies beyond this mortal coil."

I'm one to replace tires, brakes, etc well before they may be to be replaced, and my brother is at the other end of the stick....trailer had ""good tread on the tires"" though later found out they were dry-rotted....heading back to his house through single-lane construction on the interstate 2 hours north of Madison in the early evening one of the tires blew right at an exit ramp (thank you Lord) so I pulled down the exit ramp and into a gas station. This was about 8 pm and after jacking up his trailer tried to change out his spare....oh, the rim is the wrong size and won't fit. Fortunately, there was a tractor-tire Service shop on the other side of the expressway, and me and my brother's good friend drove over there....they were closing down but the mechanic heard our dilemma and changed over the good tire to the rim with the blown tire. Then after tipping him $20 we drove back to the gas station and the trailer....we are jacking the trailer back up and we hear a old P/U truck pull up....it was the mechanic who said he wanted to check on us on his way home....very nice man....saw we were using several cement blocks to use as a base under my brother's too small jack, he drove back to the shop and returned with a floor jack and had the trailer up in short order....a few minutes later we had the new tire back on and again thanked this good guy with another $20....we would have been sleeping in a motel room that night if he didn't stay over at his shop and change the spare tire. When we pulled into my brother's house in the middle of the night, he got an earful from his friend....I just laughed as I knew that's how my brother rolls (ha). So no stories about buddies with bowel problems and/or having messed up passenger seats (funny story)....but did meet a kind hard working man who helped us out in the middle of Wisconsin after closing time at his service shop.

So we had finished what we thought was our supply the night before flying out. Plane was later in the day as I think we were the closest lake to base so we got picked up last. It was getting warm and was around lunch time and me and the brother in law were *****ing about how a beer sounded good right now, dad doesn't say anything just keeps putting the final touches on packing. We see him go down to the dock and I tell him boats are all cleaned up so don't bother, he keeps going. Me and the brother in law are sitting in the cabin making fun of what a worry wart he was about checking the boats and watching him, he walks past the boats pulls up a rope that must have been tied there since the day we came in.

So we are fishing walleyes, the new guys in one boat and my buddy and I in mine. They were a ¼ mile or so down the shoreline and we notice them drifting out into the center of the lake where the basin is 80+ feet of water. We are watching them for an hour or more and wondering what the heck they are doing out there. We can see they are sitting down and don't seem to be in any distress. Finally they motor over to us and tell us about all the structure and fish they had been marking out there but couldn't get one of them to bite. They asked how deep it was where we were and I tell them like 18 feet. They are seeing wildly different depths so I told them I should see what is going on with their sonar. They pull alongside us and you guessed it .. It was set on Simulator mode LOL!"

I started to panic and tried to explain that we live in a small town without door to door mail service and that I used a PO Box address for mailing but unknown to me my wife had used an actual street address ... blah blah blah.

5312473,team walleye,2017-02-04 06:18:00,336,"I'm not sure if it's a funny story or not but..... Last year on our way up we were about 2.5 hours from home approaching on small town out south of Minneapolis on 35 when my dad's truck started sputtering and came to a stop on the side of the road on I-35. This was at about 3:30am or so. We waited a good hour or more for the tow truck to arrive. When he gets there and tows us in to town he gives us a few options on where to take the truck. He said the dealership in town would be the best bet since it's a Saturday and he doubts anyone else is open. He takes us to the dealership and drops us off. Now we need to wait about another 3 hours or so before the dealership opens up... a few hours later we see a an employee walking in to the building, so we decide to go talk to him to see if there is anyway possible they could get us in. Just our luck he says they won't have a mechanic in at all until Monday. They only had guys capable of doing oil changes. Its beginning to look like the whole trip my be ruined or at least lose a day or two on the water. Across the parking lot is another mechanic that says they open up at 9am. We still have a few hours for them to get there so we sit and wait. Finally they open and we all go in to beg for help. Once again they only have a few guys there and most of them only do oil changes.... The head guy there agreed to take a look at it, but couldn't promise anything. They are only open until noon on Saturdays and don't have parts. After looking it over he discovered it was the fuel pump. To shorten up the story.. they worked on our car while doing their other jobs and got us on our way by 1pm headed north. Once they found out we were headed to Canada for the week they were all about getting us taken care of. While my dad was in paying the bill myself and a few of the other guys went over to the grocery store and bought a couple of cases of Michelob Golden to give to the shop. They were pretty happy about getting that tip, and we were happy we wouldn't miss anytime on the water the next day. It set us back about 6-7 hours but with some luck and good fortune we made it!"

The first time we did that we were returning to the states and the agent was asking some questions. He was pretty serious, but I have been known to have little control over the ""filter"" and it gets worse the older i get. I was driving and after a few questions, he asked if we had any fruit. I said, ""Just him"" and pointed at Doc. To my surprise he just laughed and said, ""Get on out of here! Thinking back we were glad he realized I was just joking.My favorite story is when we were with our usual spring group on Wine Lake. Doc and I were boat mates that last day.

He was riding shotgun and the owner of the truck was driving. So my dad turns around to face the 6 of us sitting to his ""rear"", goes into the gangster lean and lets fly.

Fortunately for him (and us) we were less than 1/2 mile away from a rest stop. So we pull into this rest stop and he gets out. As he's duck walking away we all notice that he's got a wet spot on his britches. Well this got us to laughing even harder. But just when you thought it couldn't get any better the driver realized that my dad had just sharted on his front seat. You could almost hear his head snap as he turned to look at his seat.

I pulled myself along the side of the boat to the dock and climbed on. Lucky for the walleyes they got their freedom. Of course my fishing partner had to tell this story to just about everyone I fish with. Now whenever I pull into dock its pointed out to me what side of the boat is next to the dock.

You've all been in airports where it is common for the entrance to the bathrooms right off the concourse to have an immediate secondary wall where you go to one side for the stalls and the other side for the urinals. Well this particular bathroom had the men's on the left and women's on the right. I didn't notice the signage and went to the right, and I wasn't even the least bit surprised to enter the side that had only stalls. I was all settled in when I heard the strange clicking of heels that did not sound even a little bit like a man's walk as the ""person"" entered and proceeded to use the stall right beside me. Let's just say I finished as quickly as possible and bolted out of there. When I got back to the bar where my buddies were hanging out, they immediately asked why my face was so red and why I couldn't stop laughing. To this day I still double check every time I stop in one of the airport restrooms and then chuckle a little...

From then in we always answered United States of America. 4 of us Northbound one year. trailered his small boat and my canoe on top. On the NY Thruway heard a sound, pulled over, one of the trailer fenders lost a bolt, and was rubbing on the tire. Took out the remaining bolt and threw in in the trailer. Later stopped at a Canadian Tire and bought some bolts... and checked some others. Same trip - female tollbooth worker looked back check or count axles and says"" What is that a pool table?"" Buddies boat was covered in green outdoor carpeting. It was in the dark of night."

Well, knowing this, we set up a imitation mouse (very realistic) attached to some fishing line and strung it along the wall in the cabin. Well after several beers after dinner the plan was put into action. Only a couple of pulls on the line to get some initial movement and his attention, then the big pull to set him flying over chairs, light footing it out of the cabin all the while screaming like an 8 yr old girl. That was good for one of the biggest LOL to the point of tears. He is a good sport but to see him move like that you would have thought he was in the NFL."
