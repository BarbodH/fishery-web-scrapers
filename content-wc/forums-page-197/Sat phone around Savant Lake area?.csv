I have used the Satellite Phone Solutions place referenced in several threads on two trips -- but both in the Sioux Lookout area. Granted Savant Lake is only ~2 hours away, but still I don't want to pay for the thing and then get up there and have a hard time getting a signal.Our first trip, we went with the (cheaper) Global Star service, and had a hard time maintaining a connection. Next trip, same area, we used the Iridium phone and, while it was more expensive, it worked. Has anyone used the Iridium phone up in that area and NOT been able to get calls through?Thanks in advance,- Steve"

Iridium is used worldwide and is the go-to service used by everyone that wants reliable service, including Government entities. As you know by now, it is always best to get in the most open spot available for an unobstructed view of the sky (that is usually on the dock if at an outpost cabin). I have an Irdium phone and used it a few times this fall while moose hunting in an area no more than 30 air miles west of Savant Lake. You will have no problem with the phone."
