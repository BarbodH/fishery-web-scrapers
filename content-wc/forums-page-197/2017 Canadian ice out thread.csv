5518506,bigdaddyguns,2017-05-02 19:36:00,608,Here is the sat image from today covering western Ontario. The western areas have a lot of open water however the north and east have quite a bit of snow cover and a majority of the lakes still have ice cover.
5518914,Jason B.,2017-05-03 03:56:00,7,That is Cordingley Lake in front of Nakina Air!
5520378,vteye2,2017-05-03 17:18:00,123,I spoke with Remi yesterday who said there was a foot of snow at Nakina and a lot of local ice. He thought it would be at least a week till ice out.
5523138,Rock Lobstar1,2017-05-04 20:45:00,134,I did some scootin around the sky today and saw a lot of lakes and am happy to report I saw a lot of open water. I'll list the major lakes that I flew over and their ice statuses. Also some bonus pictures. Cedar Lake- no ice Cliff Lake- no ice Aerobus lake- no iceAnishinabi lake- 80% ice covered Gullrock Lake- 10% ice coveredPakwash lake- 70% ice covered Red lake- no ice Little Vermillion lake- no ice Kirkness lake- 60% ice covered Perrault Lake- no iceWabaskang lake- no ice Lac St Joseph 95% ice covered
5523306,Pooch,2017-05-05 04:24:00,4618,"Curious about why some lakes are so ice covered and others pretty much clear. Do lakes follow about the same pattern every year? Is it because of flow, water color and depth?Open water seems early this year. Water low, too?How much does an early ice out effect spawning areas and timing of movements throughout the summer? I can't imagine the fish care, but follow water temperatures and maybe day length?I've never paid much attention to the ""annual ice out threads"", but with several posting pictures it has my attention even though we never go early.Thanks for the pictures. They are pretty interesting.Pooch"
5523514,Walleye Wanderer,2017-05-05 06:42:00,101,"Thanks Jason, I am supposed to be in the air on the 20th so if you are in the area and could post when the ice is out that would be great! WW"
5524746,Rock Lobstar1,2017-05-05 13:18:00,134,I think depth and flow are major factors. But I'm not totally sure because Anishinabi lake is over 200 feet deep in places and had a fair bit of ice still but Pakwash lake is only 50ish feet and also had a lot of ice left. Must be a difference in flow between the two because they are very close to each other.

5497537,kzoofisher,2017-04-25 04:14:00,5144,Does anyone have a good idea of what ice out this early does for water temps? Obviously warmer for the opener and post spawn more advanced. Does the thermocline tend to set up deeper? High temps drive the fish into deep water structure how much earlier? Fall cooling delayed by X days/weeks? Mayflies early? Heavier weed growth? Just a ton of things that can be different with an early spring.
5497625,octanehi5,2017-04-25 05:26:00,1104,"47* north as well as farther north will be a later ice out 2nd to 3rd week in may,lakes in this area are just starting to go above freezing during the day,staying below freezing at night"
5498073,kzoofisher,2017-04-25 08:17:00,5144,They're reporting ice out at 49 and 50 degrees already.
5500945,vteye2,2017-04-26 08:22:00,123,I was up at camp near the VT - Quebec border 4/23 and couple of the ponds still had ice. I checked the NASA satellite and Northern Maine alongQuebec border is frozen. We fly into Kayedon out of Nakina . Kayedon is iced in and forecast suggests it could be another week or two.
5516122,Jason B.,2017-05-02 07:23:00,7,Still 18-22 inches of ice in Nakina.
5516250,campchick,2017-05-02 07:49:00,96,I would be very interested in having the link for the NASA satellite website. I am having trouble finding it. I would like to check the status of lakes here in Northwestern Ontario. Thanks.
5516386,rocko0305,2017-05-02 08:21:00,138,I have these links bookmarked to monitor ice out conditions:http://ge.ssec.wisc.edu/modis-today/...solution=1000mhttps://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov...=3&al=true&e=t
5517426,campchick,2017-05-02 12:10:00,96,"Thank you for your speedy reply. I tried both links and find the NASA one the best for me. Disappointing how much ice is still on the lakes north of Red Lake. It sure would be great to find a satellite link for really extreme detail, like the ones the military has."
5518418,Walleye Wanderer,2017-05-02 18:52:00,101,Was that ice on Cordingley Lake or Lower Twin???
5492658,v-bay gord,2017-04-22 08:44:00,3168,I get the same reaction from some of my guests who figure I rigged the ice out contest...but photos don't lie. The ice was gone the morning of the 21st..........it was ice covered though on the 20th.
5492674,pjshorthorn,2017-04-22 08:45:00,5654,Many guests of V-Bay Lodge have contended for many years that the ice out contest held by V-Bay Gord has been rigged every year. Now we have proof...... Fake news now rings true !!!!PjShorthorn
5492706,Skywagon,2017-04-22 09:06:00,1106,"Here in N/W Ontario we have not had a lot of rain since last year and after the first of the year there seemed to be less than the usual amount of snow. From what I saw just before ice out (after a lot of the snow was already gone), the water levels on the remote lakes did seem somewhat low for this time of year and we have not had that much snow melt since to make a huge difference. All of that can change in a heartbeat when a significant weather system passes through."
5492738,pjshorthorn,2017-04-22 09:31:00,5654,"Photos posted from prior years are a clear attempt of deception. I have been in contact with many of your guests and they agree that you have been posting the same ice out picture every year and then declaring ice out at different times to benefit guests who have offered you the best meal during their stays. We have decided that rigging the ice out contest, in order for you to benefit from a five course meal, is both shameless and blasphemous. To that extenet, we are putting together a petition to boycott many things during our visits this summer that have yet to be figured out. I for one will be boycotting buying any of those V-Bay Lodge luxurious specialty gift items that are for sale. See you in June. BTW, does a Mac and Cheese casserole with hotdogs and brats sprinkled in work or would you prefer the ribeye steak dinner again ? I've worn out my mink lined thong too. Do you have any left in an XL ? PjShorthorn"
5492874,v-bay gord,2017-04-22 11:31:00,3168,"Sorry I'm all out of the mink lined thongs, but I do have a new model that has a self lubricating strap that you might like......"
5492938,Lake Of The Woods,2017-04-22 12:20:00,124,"You are correct, but at the time of posting they were the most recent.What I forgot to do is add the date of when they were taken.Shortly after that post I uploaded photos that were taken on April 20th which show an updated look at what the ice situation is.I will post more aerial photos when they become available.Apologies for any confusion."
5493010,pjshorthorn,2017-04-22 12:57:00,5654,Canola oil or peanut oil? I have to be careful as I have a peanut allergy . PjShorthorn

5491650,Skywagon,2017-04-21 17:09:00,1106,"The Golden Retreiver and I had to play ice breaker in order to get the plane out to open water from our bay. I flew around some today, there is still ice in places on the walleye lakes and a little more so on the trout lakes. There is snow forecast for Sunday, but it won't last. Bottom line, early ice out.I talked to a CO yesterday, he said rumor has it that a few walleye are starting to run the creeks, a couple of CO's were going out to confirm that last night, as of yet, have not heard what they found. Those guys don't get much rest, always another reason for them to be out watching that the bad guys don't take advantage of our fish and wildlife resources."
5491930,martinbns,2017-04-21 19:43:00,1520,"Those pics aren't current. The 2nd or 3rd shows Tallpine Marina where I keep my boat being frozen over and yesterday there was no sign of ice. Clearwater was open, but Sugarbay was still frozen. I also went up to Red Lake, Eagle Lake was visibly frozen from the highway in Vermillion Bay, Gullrock was open, Red was still frozen but very black."
5492194,Rock Lobstar1,2017-04-21 22:31:00,134,I dunno about that. Vbay Gord declared vermillion bay ice free this morning.
5492394,gmattbruin,2017-04-22 06:16:00,174,"Always good to get the ice out post going imo.....there is alot of info in knowing when the ice has left a lake....but once gone the temps tht follow to activate the spawn. Another important part of the ice out is knowing the water levels. If any of you guys tht are living north and providing the ice out info....how abt water levels? S Ont has been hammered with ALOT of rain since winter let go, but doesnt mean you guys are get tht up there. Unless im wrong i dont believe you guys north had tons of snow, so how are the lakes this spring? Thanks for all your insitu info you guys provide."
5492522,martinbns,2017-04-22 07:52:00,1520,From what I could see water levels are very low. In the highway up to Red Lake all the swampy areas were dry and the waterlines in the lakes looked 1-2 feet lowSent from my Pixel XL using Tapatalk
5475834,Rock Lobstar1,2017-04-15 16:48:00,134,It's as good a time as any to start an ice out thread. Update with any ice reports (or lack of) as you see fit. With pictures is always nice. Or if you would like to know the condition on your favourite lake then you can ask and maybe someone that lives near that lake can help out.
5476050,Skywagon,2017-04-15 18:39:00,1106,"I heard someone fell through the ice on Cedar Lake yesterday (April 14th, no injuries), trying to fish the last day of walleye season. Here is a picture taken before lunch today from our yard (south of Sioux lookout), later this afternoon a patch of open water showed up in the middle of the bay. I have no clue as to when the lake will be completely open, but it has started. It looks like there will be plenty of time to get the boats in the water to check them out before the opener this year."
