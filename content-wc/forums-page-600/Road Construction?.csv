1046800,rather-be-fishin,2008-08-01 23:33:00,429,Hwy 502 is OK at the beginning and then several miles of road construction which can be rough...then it gets better before Dryden... Hwy 17 and 105 at just fine!!! Happy Fishin!!!

1046831,JDP,2008-08-02 08:31:00,1457,I was in the Fort Frances area last week. There is bridge/road construction going over Rainy Lake that cuts traffic down to one lane for BOTH directions (traffic alternates to allow for safe passage). You may be delayed a few minutes. I heard on the radio the Hwy 502 construction is for about a 10 mile stretch --- that badly needed the work. JDP
