1047376,bevy8,2008-08-05 09:55:00,8,Just wondering how the borders have been if you aren't bringing up a passport or passport card? Heading up in about 6 weeks and almost eveyone in our group (14 guys) does not have a passport. Have things been smooth for you guys that don't have them.......Good or Bad....any info would be appreciated.

I should have read up on it a little more before going - that was coming back in to the states. Entering Canada was no problem at Pigeon River, MN."
1047451,Guest,2008-08-05 14:15:00,0,"Last weekend coming back, forgot about the Birth Certificate, got a lecture and pamphlet. Overall delay 3 minutes at Ft Francis, however there was a good backup ahead and behind us, so probably not worth the aggravation at the time. 11:00 am Sunday 15 minute delay"

1047477,Jimmy Jig,2008-08-05 15:59:00,1905,"We came out of Canada at Ft. Francis, had our BC's, US didn't ask to see them, just the DL's! This was late June."
1047479,deputy dog,2008-08-05 16:03:00,305,"my group also had our passports and it seemed to make the cross into canada at buffalo quicker, usual questions. upon our return, the u.s. agent had a real attitude and was unfriendly and rude to say the least. we sort of expect a little hassel from the canadians going in but usually get it from our own country coming back!"
1047597,Guest,2008-08-06 06:44:00,0,"Crossed back to US last Wednesday with three people. One had passports, two had only drivers licenses. Got three questions: How long were you in Canada?, Why were you in Canada? and How was the fishing?"
