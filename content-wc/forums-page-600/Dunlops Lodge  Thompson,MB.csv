Search for my post on it here. 2 of the guys I wnet with had been to Holmes which was part of the original 2 lodges available when owned prior. Have not fishe the main lodge, but it has a great reputation too."

1047336,evy TN,2008-08-05 07:16:00,15,thanks for the info. checked out silsby and they have a camp manager at the outposts. kinda like the the feeling of being droped off in the middle of nowhere alone.

Everything works great. at the price 1350 for the week, it's a steal! Dunlops is a lodge, full service including guides For outposts with camp managers you can't beat BushlandAdventures and Ganglers, both have numserous options."
