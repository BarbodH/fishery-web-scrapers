574217,rockpt,2008-05-22 19:36:00,589,"Good to hear you guys are OK and salvaged your trip. Hats off to Jared. :rock-on: Curious where you guys were heading when you got in trouble? And you actually recovered the boat that got swamped? I thought it sank, but guess not.:confused: Thanks for the full report."
574228,Obabikon,2008-05-23 05:27:00,2370,"They were headed to Bottle Bay (over by thompson's creek). I think in all the excitement, I was told that the other boat had sunk. Didn't figure out until a couple days later it had just flipped and was full of water. Those boats are very hard to sink completely with the foam blocks under the seats. It ended up about a 1/4 mile - 1/2 mile away from where they beached. But, it was pretty banged up. The engine was knocked off in about 3ft of water, and the gas tank/hose was still attached. Would've been tough to find without the ""bobber"" gas tank. Guys, thanks for the kind words. Alan, I hadn't put together that you were one of the guys. We didn't even discuss walleye central."
574229,Obabikon,2008-05-23 05:34:00,2370,"I got out to go fishing yesterday afternoon. The walleyes are getting more and more active every day. A few days ago, we were catching them in 20 ft of water, and now we're catching quite a few in the weeds (8ft). That's a great sign that they're going to move up shallow. For the most part, everyone's been using jigs and a minnow. One group of guests used ""gulp alive"" leeches, and did very well. We did have two 28 inch 9 pound walleyes caught in the past week. So, even though it's not fast action, it seems the big ones are around. The lake temp is up to 51, and with a day in the 70's today, that'll be coming up. The northerns in obabikon lake are fast action of course. We caught two over 27 inches yesterday. Seems the slot is really helping the population of larger northerns."
574331,alanb,2008-05-27 09:05:00,56,"Ob, yes I was one of the group. In all the excitement we didn't talk about Walleye Central. I had been reading your ice out reports this year with great anticipation that the ice was finally gone! Looks like you are having great weather and look forward to reading your updates on the fishing all season. Have a fun, safe summer and see you in January @ Pheasant Run Resort."
574521,Guest,2008-05-31 13:58:00,0,"Sorry for the lack of reports guys! I've been swamped. Anyhow, we have one group in camp (but it's 54 guys). They've been doing great! Tons of big fish... infact, the one complaint I've heard is the lack of lunchers. But, we seem to have enough in the 15-16 inch range to feed those guys. (I just got back from doing the shore lunch... got them in and out in an hour and a half). Anyhow, two 29 inch fish have been caught... along with a ton of 24, 25, 26, 27's... Last night I took a couple of the guys out, they said they'd been coming up for years and had never been to Obabikon Lake. Anyhow, I take them up casting for northerns and telling a story (about the POW camp that was in Obabikon). Anyhow, I reel up, and a 50"" musky grabs my little inline spinner right at the boat (maybe 3 feet of line out)... unprepared, my reactionary hookset was weak at best. But, all three of us saw her flop and roll at the boat... even though she was only on for 5-10 seconds. Those beautiful fish can sure get the heart pounding!"
1045364,Guest,2008-07-26 17:06:00,0,"I was up in Caribou today and caught two large mouths. We were casting for northerns, and caught them both on rock points. One was 4.5 lbs and the other 3 lbs... very nice fish."
1045460,Obabikon,2008-07-27 13:23:00,2370,"The fish really are biting, and the weather is perfect! I suggest to anyone with a chance to get out fishing ASAP! Crappies, Walleyes, Northerns, Muskie, even bass... we're catching everything right now!"
1045492,mlure,2008-07-27 17:42:00,15,Where have you been getting the crappies? Heading up on Wed. Have a trailer at Mylie's. Know your cook Larry quite well. Say hello to him for us.Dick Moore

1045583,Tony Shirley,2008-07-28 07:25:00,211,Hi obikon were fishing out of 620 with a 250 no prob to be there quick lol.Wheres caribou?.When am i pickin up lol.Is there a lot og good smallmouth there also.
1045600,Obabikon,2008-07-28 09:09:00,2370,"Tony, Look at my website, and call me on the toll free number (it's at the bottum of the front page). It'll be easier to figure out dates that way.www.obabikon.com Also, are you fishing the KBI? Or just looking to have fun?"
1045601,Obabikon,2008-07-28 09:10:00,2370,"Oh, and Caribou is a small lake in the North East corner of Obabikon lake."
1047279,Obabikon,2008-08-04 20:54:00,2370,"Great day today! I didn't get to go out until the evening, but the people who did caught fish! The walleyes are sitting ontop of 10-14 foot humps. Nice ones. There's no problem catching the 16-18 inch fish right now. Tons of them. Also, the big wallies are hitting again. One group caugh 4 over 24 inches this morning... the biggest being 27. Now back on me! There was very little wind, but cloudy drizzle after dinner this evening. My wife loves to chase muskies (even though she's yet to catch one). So, she asked for me to take her out. Anyhow, 3 muskies on, 1 in the boat (not good odds, but we had fun). The boated one was a 44"" fattie caught on the ""last cast"" of the night. She hit it right at the boat, immediately after I had told the wife we were heading in (I had the luck of catching her). Also, we boated a 31"" northern (the wife's biggest ever) and a 36"" northern. Anyhow, just thought I'd share our great day of fishing with everyone!"
1047381,rockpt,2008-08-05 10:11:00,589,"Good for you, Jared. Was nice meeting you last week. We hit the spots you marked in Obabikon and caught a bunch of northerns. Nothing big, but not bad for a calm, sunny afternoon. Thanks again for marking our map. The reef fishing for walleye last week was as good as I've ever seen it. One afternoon, wife and I caught 28 in less than two hours and most were 14-18"" and a couple bigger ones. That was pretty typical for the week. We'll be back up from Oct 3-12 for the fall bite and muskie trolling."
1047590,Obabikon,2008-08-06 06:30:00,2370,"I boated a 48 inch muskie on a crappie jig and 6LB test yesterday! LOL I wasn't even pulling up a crappie, he just hit the jig! Huge fish, and a long fight."

575869,Obabikon,2008-07-08 14:06:00,2370,The crawlers that a guest just brought up have been VERY successful.
575876,Guest,2008-07-08 18:02:00,0,Thanks Obabikon. We'll probably stop by and get some advice on Obabikon Lake and the pike fishing spots. Hope to see you soon. Dave
1044330,Guest,2008-07-22 11:57:00,0,"Fishing report for last week. The weather pattern was very challenging the first couple days with high winds and a 20 degree temperature drop. Additionally we were in the midst of a mayfly hatch. This made walleye fishing very challenging. We caught plenty to eat and bring home but they were not jumping in the boat. Fortunately muskies don't eat mayflies. We caught our nicest muskies yet on this trip with our biggest being 50.5"". We were fishing out of Miles Bay Camp and I know for sure that at least 3 50 inch fish were caught by guests last week with numorous high 40 inch fish as well. I would highly recommend this fishing camp as Matt and Jenn do a great job taking care of clients. Bucktails were the best producer, with weeds being the key to finding the fish. I would like to thank everyone who gave me advice on this site as it really helped get me to some new water, all of whcih was good. Additionally, I would like to thank Obabikon (Jared) for marking my map up with a few spots for pike in Obabikon Lake. It paid off and we had a great day on action with some good size as well. Dave (Link)"
1044822,rockpt,2008-07-24 08:52:00,589,Great report! We head up tomorrow for nine days. Weather is looking good. We're staying in Miles Bay and running a Crestliner 192 DC with 200 Merc. and Pro Kicker. Dog will be with us. Stop by and say hi if you see us.

1044880,Guest,2008-07-24 12:33:00,0,"Largemouth can be caught in West creek (north west end of Obabikon lake) and Caribou lake... I'd be happy to take you out fishing, but it all depends on the day."

1045052,Tony Shirley,2008-07-25 07:20:00,211,Any good lure choices
1045160,Guest,2008-07-25 14:13:00,0,I'll talk to one of the Gibbons boys and ask for some advice on lure choices. I usually just toss a spinner bait.... but there's lots of options. You're going to boat all they way around from Kenora? That's quite a boat ride!
574979,Guest,2008-06-12 08:15:00,0,Thanks for the info Obabikon. We may just take you up on mraking up our map. Hope you have a good season!
575743,Obabikon,2008-07-03 16:19:00,2370,"The prop was returned! :) fastcast2 and his wife came by the camp a few days ago and I gave them back the prop. We talked musky fishing for a while, and he said he'd just boated one a few minutes before. Anyhow, just thought I'd share that little bit of info. It's funny how the news traveled so fast about the prop!"
575769,Guest,2008-07-04 13:27:00,0,"Obabikon, hows the fishing been up there? Plan on making a trip in a week. Any info would be great! Thanks"
575771,Obabikon,2008-07-04 14:10:00,2370,"The fishing has been great! The may flies are out, but the late spring killed most of them. The hatch was almost nothing compared to seasons past. Walleyes are biting just about everywhere right now. Reefs, shorelines, beaches... The muskies are starting to get going. The big crappies seem to have moved out deeper. I haven't tried much, but assume they're in 18+ feet of water. Small mouth and northerns are going well too! I love July for this exact reason. Every species of fish is catchable right now."
575785,rpieske,2008-07-05 06:44:00,1276,"I concur with Obabikon's report. Northerns and bass have been really good and the muskies are finally moving. Caught two yesterday and saw several big girls, one of which I lost at the boat. I think the stable temps and the nice wind put them on the rocky/weedy shorelines. We have been catching nice walleyes right in the reeds in 2-4 feet with jig spinners. Today should be good, too."
575809,Guest,2008-07-06 08:37:00,0,Headed to Miles Bay on Friday. We usually will make a run to Sabaskong for a day chasing muskies. Never headed west before but I am wondering if it is worthwhile to head up to the Sabaskosing Bay area? Any particular pattern for the muskies right now working better than another? Are the walleyes biting on crawlers yet or are minnows still more productive? Thanks in advance for any information you can provide.
575812,rockpt,2008-07-06 11:05:00,589,"Yes, try going west. Lot's of good walleye spots around Rubber Island, Firebag, Gull Bay and Sabaskosing. A ton of good muskie water, too. Sand Point (Naongashing), Little Garden, North Island. Don't go west though if there's a strong wind from the west, southwest or south, it'll be tough to fish a lot of spots."
575823,Guest,2008-07-06 20:58:00,0,I've guided about 20 day since opening and fishing has been above average around this end of the lake especially around Rubber Island and Sand Point and Painted Rock. Here's a link to some photos and reports:http://buenavista.livejournal.com/

Anyhow, have him get in touch with me. I removed the prop from the chunk of lower unit, and it seems to be in pretty good shape."
574678,Guest,2008-06-04 21:52:00,0,"Some of the local Indian guides have told me they go thru the narrows on plane, but I've never seen it done. Like navigating a minefield."
574692,MTJ,2008-06-05 08:39:00,106,"I was told a story of a boat that tried running the opening on plane. The hit the rocks and it shot them up the island. I get nervous enough trolling through I would never have it in me to take it on plane. If the water was high enough I believe it's possible, just not for me."
574693,Obabikon,2008-06-05 09:20:00,2370,"I used to do it in smaller boats when I was a kid. Stupid rush stuff... but in all honesty, it saves you 30 seconds, and risks thousands of dollars. Even if the water's high enough, what if you rub the west point going through? Lots of things other than lower units can go wrong. Very dangerous."
574695,Guest,2008-06-05 12:56:00,0,"We made the run thru the gap on plain the first year up there following our guide in camp boats, not knowing what was there...every year after we now take our own boats at a snail pace with motor up. I still pause to think...what were we doing weaving S curves in camp boats like that following Serge..."
574704,Guest,2008-06-05 18:25:00,0,"Obabikon, We went up into Obabikon Lake last spring on opener and only caught a couple pike. I assume it was because of the colder water/weather.

574711,Obabikon,2008-06-05 19:52:00,2370,"Tell Matt hi for me! He's a great person, and I hope you have a wonderful trip. July is a very good time period for northerns. If you pick the right day, it wouldn't be suprising if a boat of 3 caught 50-75 northerns in 5 hours... all in the range of 18-26 inches. Now, there are going to be guys on here saying ""all that's up there is hammer handles"". Those guys are the idiots that fish the rice beds all day! Fish the shore lines and deep water cabbage beds... they'll produce bigger fish. If you stop by the camp, I'll mark a couple of spots on the map that you should try during that time period."
574640,Obabikon,2008-06-04 04:34:00,2370,"The fishing has slowed down some. Yesterday the walleyes were in about 5ft of water. Only spot I could find them on a regular basis. But, I do have a funny story to tell. I took a group out fishing yesterday, and decided we'd go up to Obabikon Lake. While passing through the narrows, a kid in my boat says ""there's a prop down there"". So, I back it up and see a beautiful stainless steal prop about 3 feet under the water. We try to net it, but the prop was wedged between a couple of rocks. After 15 minutes of working on this thing, I decide to hop out. I'm waste deep standing over the rock, and just dive down to get it. After pulling and pulling the rock finally lets lose. I pull it up, and it's a HUGE Mercury prop with about a foot and a half of lower unit still attached! Somebody had a very bad day. No clue how long it had been down there, or who's it was. However, the prop itself is in almost perfect shape. If you're heading into Obabikon Lake, don't be crazy... slow down."
574662,Guest,2008-06-04 14:28:00,0,"My good frien Jeff Miller from Eagle River, WI lost that prop last summer. I have called him and told him to get in touch with you. Whais your e mail address and phone. You can contact me at [email protected]. Dick"
574666,Guest,2008-06-04 15:21:00,0,"I'm sorry to say that the lower unit and prop are from my ranger boat.I have been fishing LOTW for 25 years and never hit anything.Last year we made a dozen trips into Obabakin lake going slow and got the bright idea coming back out that I could get thru on plane as a friend told me he did it.Well you found the proof that it can't be done,at least with that water level.It took me 1 1/2 hours with my kicker to get back to my mobile at Sportsman harbor and $7000 later I am back running.This happened the end of august,but my wife did get a 44"" musky just before this happened.I can't believe the prop is in descent shape.If I can figure how to post a picture here,I will show you what the motor looks like after the crash. Jeff at 9C Sportsman Harbor"
573750,Obabikon,2008-05-09 18:23:00,2370,"Hey guys, The weather the last two days has been absolutely perfect. It's been in the mid 50's with blue skies all day! There's a slight chance of rain the next few days, but the temp is going to continue to go up. Highs in the 60's by middle of next week. I'm at the camp, and everything is in working order (except a couple of broken pipes that I apparently didn't drain properly). Anyhow, the water level is a little lower than I expected, but still up from where it was last year at this time. Assuming we get some spring rain, it should be up most of the year. Sabaskong looked wide open... there's very little snow/ice to be seen anywhere. I would guess that the big Northerns are still in shallow, but they won't be there much longer. Not a lot of color on the trees yet, but spring will bloom soon. Miles Bay is also open... I didn't do an entire tour, but I peaked through one of the southern entrances (one closest to Obabikon Bay) and it looked just like we left it 6 months ago! Anyone who is in the area feel free to stop in and have a cup of coffee. We can exchange fishing spots! (Bill K., I expect to see you at least once this year to talk about your book)"
573783,rpieske,2008-05-10 22:39:00,1276,I'll arrive in Nestor Falls on Thursday. Crow Lake is starting to go out pretty fast now. I'm prepared for some cool weather this coming week.
573788,Obabikon,2008-05-11 06:41:00,2370,"Nestor should have decent temps. High's in the mid 50's and touching the 60's by the end of the week. Yesterday was an ugly day... cold with rain/snow off and on. Bad day to be working on leaky water lines! Today is already looking great. Blue skies, sun shining... makes me want to go fishing!"
573789,Guest,2008-05-11 07:40:00,0,"Obabikon & Rpeske, Thanks for the updates. We leave in a couple of weeks and the updates are certainly appreciated. Also nice the see the lake level up and according to the LWCB report it appears to be continuing to rise. Max"
573995,Guest,2008-05-17 05:43:00,0,Ob- how about giving us an update on Miles Bay. Have you had a chance to get out and wet a line? Thanks and will try to stop by the week of 6/7.
573998,Obabikon,2008-05-17 10:13:00,2370,"Actually, haven't had time to get a line wet, had to help in a rescue of 11 guys last night that tried to cross... one of their three boats flipped in the middle of Mile's bay. Absolute miracle that they all lived! The water's so cold, one had serious hypothermia. So, please, anyone going to a cabin, check wind conditions. If it's more that 15mph, stay on shore until it dies down. Or, find someone willing to transport in a large launch. Don't load down your boats with gear and then try to take on the lake! Anyhow, today's opener. I'll have some fishing news from the groups that went out today. I'll try to post again this evening."
573999,rockpt,2008-05-17 16:03:00,589,How about a few more details on that boat flip... Everyone OK? Boat recovered? How rough was the lake yesterday? Thanks for the report.
574005,Obabikon,2008-05-17 21:02:00,2370,"Everyone's fine, they're going to stay here for a couple of days. The wind was 30+ mph out of the NW... they tried to cross miles entering the SE entrance, which was the worst possible direction. The boat has no been recovered. It was a rental from Mylie's Place... 16 footer with a 20 hp yamaha 2stroke. They lost 1/3rd of their gear and supplies... and all their beer was in that boat! :) Anyhow, the guys are doing much better, and are going to go fishing tomorrow! Daryle from Mylies and Matt from Miles Bay Camp were amazing out there. Resort owners willing to put their equipment, and even their lives at risk to help strangers on the lake. Wind was rough again today, but the forecast for tomorrow is much better. Be careful out there!"
574210,alanb,2008-05-22 16:38:00,56,"Since we are now immortalized on the message board of an excellent example of ""What Not To Do""; I want to extend a huge public thank you to Jared from Obabikon Bay Camp, Daryle from Mylies, Matt from Miles Bay Camp (now we have his name) and the fellow (sorry forgot his name) in the Crestliner that shuttled us out Friday evening to Obabikon Bay Camp. Furthermore, Jared went above and beyond to accommodating us at Obabikon Bay Camp. Their hospitality is beyond words and I will gladly recommend them in the future for anyone looking for a camp on LOW. Jared, thank you again. Obabikon is dead on that we should have never been out there. What happened was a combination of GO fever (herd mentality), inflexibility in the plan (this is what we have always done)with no backup plan and no weather information provided. We attempted the crossing in the afternoon once the winds had been blowing all day. This was only my third year (and time) on LOW, but I learned a heck of a lot for the future. I have always carried a GPS on LOW and we rent a sat phone each year. Jared was first on the scene very quickly after we made the call for help. Found the boat upside down next to the motor on 5/18 and some gear scattered on the western shorelines south of the SE entrance to Miles Bay. Ended up only losing beer, 2 older fish finders, and a tackle box or two. Thank God that's all. Gear and beer can be replaced, lives can't. As for the fishing from 5/18 to 5/20, the water was very cold and the walleye were mostly in the warmer shallow bays and coves. Found them in water depth in the 8' to 12' range. Best production was direct tied chartreuse jig tipped with a minnow drifting over shallow flats into the corner where the wind is pushing the water. Lots of small northerns and bass in the same areas. No luck using crawlers, but maybe ours were too wet!"
