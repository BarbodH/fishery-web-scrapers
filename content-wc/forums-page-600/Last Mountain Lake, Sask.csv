Several of us from SE Montana are heading up to Last Mountain Lake and staying at the G&S Marina in one of their cabins the 2nd week in September. Any hints, tricks or fishing reports for this lake. I have never been there but a couple of the guys in our group had a couple of days up there a few years ago and said they thought the fishing was very good. Haven't been up to Canada in a lot of years and looking forward to it!"

Lindy rigs and trolling bottom bouncer/spinner rigs and cranks are the most effective methods. In Sept., I would guess that Lindy's will be the best bet. The lake is full of structure. Most of the main points on both sides of the lake are very productive, as are the shelves in the 15-25' range near the main lake basin. Many of the small points just south of the marina can be really productive too, I've caught some real beauties just slowly drifting and working those points. The folks at G&S will point you in the right direction to find the fish, I'm sure of that. The big Rowan's Ravine walleye tournament is the week before you guys get there, so they'll have all the latest info. It's a big lake, and if the wind is blowing from the NW (which it seems like it ALWAYS is when I'm there lol), it can be a little hairy. Depending on your boat and how bad you want to fish, you can often be limited to the more protected areas on one shore or the other. On the upside, the weather in Sept. is usually pretty stable, and it can be downright perfect if you hit it right. Take some warm clothes, a tooque and rain gear though lol. Welcome to Canada, and good luck! Waxy P.S. If you're looking for tackle, bait, licenses, etc... or more info on where and what to fish, the guys at Pokey's Tackle Shop in Regina (about 40 mins away) are great."

We always fished out of TTT Beach. I have always heard good things about G&S. When the wind decides it is time to blow, it is not much fun. We generally would fish until the September wind stayed for three days staight. Then we knew it was time to go home. Good luck."
