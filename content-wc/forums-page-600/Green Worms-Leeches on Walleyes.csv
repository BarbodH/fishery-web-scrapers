Any idea what these creatures are? We never noticed them on fish any other years. Anybody else catch fish with these ""creatures""?"
1046203,Guest,2008-07-30 13:43:00,0,"I'm surprised that nobody else noticed these small ""worms/leeches"" on the smaller walleyes, our group of 5 caught several fish daily with these ""creatures"" stuck to the tails. Or maybe no one knows what they are???"
1046363,prov1900,2008-07-31 07:38:00,544,"Don't know what those are, but have seen them in lots of walleyes on that system. That is why we don't eat them sushi style"
1046439,Obabikon,2008-07-31 12:42:00,2370,"I believe those are actually small leeches. The paracite, which usually infects perch from eating a type of snail, is under the skin. Anyhow, I don't believe those actually infect the meat. However, they could cause an infection that could kill the fish."
1046453,Guest,2008-07-31 13:42:00,0,"Has the MNR mentioned what these ""leeches"" are? We've never noticed them on any previous trips to LS(last 3 years) and this year we never noticed them on any of the over 15"" walleyes, just the small ones. If there is a potential danger to the fishery wouldn't the MNR be ""proactive"" in trying to eliminate them as best as possible? And if they only affect the smaller walleyes, what are fishermen supposed to eat? Most camps frown on eating the bigger fish and probably want you to eat the 14"" walleyes. Hopefully the MNR responds to my email and will clear up some of the questions I asked them. Thanks for your replies !!"
1046802,rather-be-fishin,2008-08-01 23:38:00,429,I just got back from Lac Seul today and yes I caught several small walleyes with these small brown leeches stuck on the tails....I've never seen them before either in the last 5 years on Lac Seul....also waiting to hear from someone who can explain why they have them now and not for the last 5 years????
