1044354,Guest,2008-07-22 13:49:00,0,"I have been to canada often in August. As a rule I believe the walleyes are less active, however, there have been years when we caught a lot. Including a 14 lb 30 inch. My two cents worth is that Canadian fishing is always a lot better than where I live in N. Indiana. Personally I try to stay away from going to Canada in July and early Aug. but mainly because of the heat."

1045314,way2goofy,2008-07-26 10:24:00,22,"I've been up in August many times. We always look for reefs that come up to about 30 feet. The walleyes seem to be in the 26' to 35' range then. If we are having trouble with wind holding on a reef we also troll shorelines with about the same depth in mind. We usually use ""Little Joe"" rigs with a leech or minnow. I am anxious to try Gulp Leeches with a stinger hook this year. I have the 3"" and 5 1/2"" to try. I heard the Gulp minnows work well also. I found out they aren't cheap but have been buying then a few bags at a time."

1045992,way2goofy,2008-07-29 18:57:00,22,"Single hook with an add-on stinger hook. Need them on the Gulp leeches as they break easier than the Gulp minnows for some reason. The sports shops here are getting almost $6 for 8 - 5 1/2"" bag of Gulp leeches. We are buying leeches in Ft. Frances also."

Usually I find walleyes in deeper water at the edge of large reefs and then move up into 7-10 feet of water for pike. This time walleyes spent time in shallow water and were extremely aggressive. Found some walleyes on points and in moving water, but mostly on each of two large reefs. Jigs and power grubs kept us in business."
