1048042,Matches,2008-08-07 20:41:00,236,I'm just curious if the Tournament is disruptive at all for those that are up at resorts out of Kenora to enjoy a quiet week of Walleye Fishing. Kenora news says it is over 100 Boats in the Tournament from Thusday through Saturday.. Is it disruptive or noticably more boat busy traffic at all during those 3 days for those on the lake not fishing in the tournament? This photo sure makes it look so.http://www.kenoradailyminerandnews.c...aspx?e=1147174 Just wondering if the locals support the tournament.

Many of the entrants are locals from the Kenora and LOTW region, so their friends and families closely follow the tournament. There also are some of the top fishermen from the states and Canada entered. There's also the US vs. Canada competition for national competition and pride. And there are events for the community all weekend long. In many ways, it's a tournament for locals run by locals. Definitely more boat traffic than the average weekend, but it's exciting to see those guys racing around the lake. And LOTW is so big that except for start and finish times, I think the boats are pretty well dispersed thru-out the lake. I know the current leaders, and those guys don 't even wet a line until they get down around the Sabaskong area, and that's a long way from Kenora, especially going the the Tug Channel route. A few years ago I was fishing near Naongashing (Sand Point) just west of Rubber Island and one of the boats came blasting thru at 65 mph on their way back to Kenora to make weigh-in. We waved and cheered them on. Good luck Oliver and Jason!"

I've seen 2-3 boats in my area fishing today that are clearly KBI guys. I would say sorry to anyone that it's bothering, however, it definately is worht upsetting a few walleye fishermen for 3 days for what it does for Kenora and LOTW's in general."
