1046123,bearpaw,2008-07-30 09:07:00,4,Does anyone know what camps are charging for gas these days?
1046130,Guest,2008-07-30 09:29:00,0,Evergreen Lodge was charging about $4.60 a gallon earlier this summer. They don't take a make up on their gas you pay what they pay
1046153,Obabikon,2008-07-30 10:57:00,2370,"1.60 per litre is what I charge. I have to mark mine up from what I pay, because I have to barge it out 8 miles into the middle of LOTW's. I don't make money on gas. These prices suck!"
1046187,bearpaw,2008-07-30 13:01:00,4,That's not as bad as I thought it would be. I heard horror stories of more than twice that. Thanks for the info
1046200,Guest,2008-07-30 13:36:00,0,Ear Falls area resort was about $6 a gallon last week.
1046615,Guest,2008-08-01 06:56:00,0,Yep - $8.00 per gallon up north of Kenora.
1046801,rather-be-fishin,2008-08-01 23:35:00,429,Just got back from LacSeul and gas was $5.30 gallon at resort.... 3.79 at gas stations...
1046820,Guest,2008-08-02 06:55:00,0,"Rather-be-fishin, where did you stay that gas was so much cheaper? Ear Falls gas stations were 1.51 liter last week( approx. 4 liters per gallon, liter is more than a quart, I know) and that is what the resort charged for gas. Vermillion Bay gas stations were charging 1.41 per liter."
1046861,Lazy Fisherman,2008-08-02 12:33:00,276,"From what I have heard, $3.79/gallon would be way below the norm."
1046998,Guest,2008-08-03 11:21:00,0,I wonder what Ken and Brenda are charging at Lac Seul Outposts? they barge gas uplake 40 miles!!!
