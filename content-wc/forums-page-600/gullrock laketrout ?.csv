Make a ""needle"" out of a piece of wire and thread your line from the rear of the fish and out the mouth. Then tie on a treble hook and a wieght so that the hook goes into it's mouth. We usually fish in 30 - 40 ft. deep. It's pretty boring, so we only fish during our luch break."

The deeper water is in Red Lake, and that's where the summer fishing can be had. I've heard of trout being caught in Gullrock in the early spring by walleye fishermen, but I think it's pretty rare. Whether they would be back in Gullrock in September I couldn't say. Your campowner or someone local should be able to tell you."

I didn't weight it but the weight calculators i have tried with those measurements put it at over 20 pounds but when I talked to the local MNR guys they said the fish in red lake system that size would be close to 30 pounds based on their experience.Of course I didn't have a camera. I released it as soon as I measured it and the last thing I saw was it's big head turning toward the bottom and swimming off.Most lakers are caught in Gullrock through the ice, my neighbour got a 12 pounder on the shoreline beside my house this past winter. and myother neighbour got a 20 pounder while ice fishing by 3 sisters.We think they follow the smelts down under the ice from Red Lake then head back to Red Lake when the spring comes."
