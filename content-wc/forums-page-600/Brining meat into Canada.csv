We always have our own meat processed at a local locker. All of the packages have my name, date of processing, and the name and address of the locker. Does anyone know if this will be acceptable, or am I just asking for trouble at the border. I don't want to give up my meat. Thank you. Any and all info is appreciated, this is our first trip to Canada."
