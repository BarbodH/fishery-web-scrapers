Last time I almost got killed because a careless outfitter that operates on that lake. Here is the press release I just had written up about the incident: Fisherman Cheats Death and Warns Others of Deadly Problem FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE A fisherman has created a website to warn anglers about the dangers of unscrupulous fly in fishing outfitters after following ones bad advice nearly killed his father, son and himself. Millington, MI Tuesday JULY 29, 2008 -- The website, CanadaFlyInFishingReview.com, was launched after the fishermans' ordeal and aims to provide a place for fishermen to gather and share their experiences about outfitters, as well as establishing a rating system for the fly in fishing industry. During a fishing trip to northern Ontario the outfitter talked the fishermen into departing by way of river instead of flying out of their destination in a float plane. The three men missed their outfitter who was supposed to be waiting for them on the river bank at 8am that morning. The fishing party ended up going much further down river than they were supposed to. One of the fishermen and website owner Mr. Steven Snyder said: ""The weather had been very rainy for the entire trip and the rivers had swelled and were raging."" The fishing party couldn't turn around and go back because they had already passed through some strong rapids. The boats weren't powerful enough to make it back up stream. Steven said: Â“We temporarily lost control of both boats in the next set of white water rapids that stretched approximately 40 feet of the river. It was an extremely close call and both boats nearly capsized."" Next the three men then found themselves trapped between the white water they had just encountered and a new stretch of extreme rapids that was clearly impassible. The men were forced to land the boats in a remote area. This isn't the only deadly situation this fishing party encountered due to their outfitters carelessness. Canada Fly In Fishing Review was created by Steve Snyder after this almost fatal fishing trip to northern Ontario in May 2007. Steve has been on several fly in fishing trips to northern Ontario since 1979 and is an experienced fly in fisherman.
