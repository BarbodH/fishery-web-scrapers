This is a fly-in outpost, single cabin, 11 mile long lake about a 20 minute Otter flight due west of Pickle Lake on the Meen River. We were given the honor of ""de-bugging"" (literally and figuratively) this cabin that hasn't been used in about 3 seasons so we really had a ""fresh"" lake. And the results showed it!! Without exageration, the 4 of us caught about 2000 walleye!! We found 4 or 5 really-hot spots where it was just plain un-challenging and decided to move on. One spot we considered to be the best single fishing spot we've ever found. We also caught 2 ""blue"" walleye. The walleye size range was unique for us. Probably 60% of the walleye were less than 15 inches (the future of this lake looks VERY bright) but there were plenty in the ""sweet spot"" range of 16-19 inches. Then there seemed to be a hugh gap in the 20 to 23 inch range as we only caught about 10 in that range. But the jumbos were excellent: 3 - 24's, 2 - 25's, 2 - 26's and the largest caught on day one was Wil's 27 incher. The pike fishing was darn good also - even though we didn't really target them - with numerous fish in the 29-32 inch range. Tom's 37 incher was our best. There's a pike-only portage lake - Larsh Lake - that is supposed to hold trophy northern but during our day there (in a square back, man-powered canoe) we only got 4 pike - 29 to 31 inchers - and no small ones. A tough portage for this level of fishing when Wettlaufer was sooooo good. As a bonus, while walleye fishing, we caught about 30 jumbo perch up to 12 inches. One windy day, my partner and I parked off a weedbed in the lee and specifically targeted perch with small twisters and worms and caught 5 in about an hour or so (along with a number of walleye). The outfitter had the cabin setup just fine (the new shower was wonderful on cold days) but there's clearly alot of work that can be done there - didn't bother us at all though. Boats and motors were excellent - 14 foot dry Lunds and 9.9 hp Mercury's. The outfitter plans to have this cabin upgraded and the lake available for next year's fishing season. The cabin's location was also notable - in a protected bay with a wonderful sand beach right in front. We practically never used the dock. Gary caught a 32 inch pike on the second cast off the dock the first day. Questions? Feel free to ask away!! phish"
575904,idapaul,2008-07-09 14:49:00,82,phish; what was the damage per person? out of curoisoty
575919,phishfearme,2008-07-09 21:36:00,1242,their base rate for a 4 day trip is $725 plus $75 for each day past that so the price was $1175USD. note that this includes the arrival night at their cabin in pickle lake so they covered 11 nights for this price - about $107 per night before taxes - not a bad deal at all. phish

575933,phishfearme,2008-07-10 16:21:00,1242,sarg - web site is: http://northof51.com/ the photo gallery has a number of photos from our bow lake trip last year and will probably have some of our wettlaufer lake photos shortly. you'll note though that wettlaufer is not yet offered but will be shortly - at least i think. phish
1046120,Guest,2008-07-30 08:48:00,0,"Phish, I am heading up to Wettlaufer in September (5-10) to try it out. 11 mile long lake? Any suggestions on where to start, ideas on lures and structure of the lake. Any input would be appreciated. More Northerns than walleyes or what did you spend most of your time on?"
