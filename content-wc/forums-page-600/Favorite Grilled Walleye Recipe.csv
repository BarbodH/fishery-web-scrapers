1048007,bob oh,2008-08-07 17:49:00,3936,"Let me tell you a quick, easy way to fix fish that will get you eating more without the grease. I just tried it and wife and I both like it. Friend told me he fixes eyes on the George Foreman and I thought he was well, easy to satisfy. I was wrong, I've done it twice and really like it. Heat the grill, spray with Pam (I use an olive oil spray) put lemon, margarine, allspice, lemon pepper (whatever spices you like) on fish, close grill for 4 minutes and then enjoy. The fish will be browned on top and nice and moist. It really is quite good and very easy and makes having fish a lot quicker and easier (for weekdays especially)."
1048025,phishfearme,2008-08-07 19:17:00,1242,"get a fish grilling ""basket"" that you can lay the fillets on then close the top over them. spray with sprayable butter or margarine on both sides. sprinkle with lemon pepper (NOT the salted kind - just pure ground lemon rinds and pepper) then cook QUICKLEY over a very HOT grill. INCREDIBLE flavor. crisp on outside and moist inside. bon appetit phish"

1048076,stinkycat,2008-08-08 06:01:00,2018,"I started this a couple of years ago and now I fry fish only 10% and grill 90%. -I put two layers of foil ( would like to find where phishfearme found grilling basket with lid ?) flat on counter top. -Spray with pan spray and lay fish on top -dice up a bunch of green peppers and onions, try to dice quite small and almost completely cover the fish with vegs. -add several table spoons of Italian Rose Garlic Spread on top -sprinkle seasoned salt and pepper -cover with one layer of foil and seal up the edges by crimping the foil -cook for about 8-10 minutes and check Eat with all the vegs still on top or scrape off some if you want. Super Yum Yum!"
