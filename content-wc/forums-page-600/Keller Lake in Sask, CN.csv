What kind of weather should I prepare for? Does anyone have any fishing information that they would be willing to share on that body of water? Are the bugs bad that time of year? I think I'm ok on what fishing gear to take, just typical Canadian pike/walleye gear eh? Any help would be appreciated, I have never been to this lake and never been to Canada this time of year. Thank you in advance of your response."

You can probably throw a rusty bottle cap in there and catch fish, but a basic assortment of jigs, rubber tails (Gulp if you want to save on bait), and as much bait (minnows) as you want to or can pack in will be all you need to catch the walleye. For the pike - a few shallow running and floating cranks (surface sight fishing for the big northerns is always a blast), and most importantly, an assortment of Len Thompson spoons. The silver/blue and 5 of diamonds are my faves. Don't be afraid to go BIG on some of the pike lures, and make sure you buy a dozen good quality (titanium is best, they don't bend) leaders. Take whatever tackle you want and can pack in though, it's fun to catch fish using a wide variety of techniques and lures, even some of those ridiculous ones in your kit you've never caught anything with before! As far as weather, prepare for the worst and hope for the best. It could very well be beautiful- warm, sunny and calm, but most likely you'll have a couple days where it's going to be cool, windy and maybe raining, at the very least, you'll see a thunderstorm. Just pack the basic stuff - a good set of warm clothes and rain gear, maybe a touque and gloves for the mornings, and the rest of your basic fishing stuff. Make sure you take some shorts and t-shirts too. The bugs shouldn't be too bad, a few skeeters and black flies, but by Sept, they're usually pretty decent, it's the heat of mid July to mid Aug that's black fly time. Enjoy. I wish I was going! Waxy"

Hate to pack heavy but it sounds like I better pack for warm and cold weather. I'm excited to go and I love catching big pike and then a few walleye for supper. If only I knew how to clean a dang pike. I usually keep the smaller ones and boil them whole (after cleaning them of course) and then peel the meat off the bones instead of trying to fillet them."
1047647,Waxy,2008-08-06 09:28:00,2938,"Yikes. It's very hard to explain, especially typing, but it's very simple to do actually. I could show you in 5 mins. It's all about feel. Once you have the fillet removed and the skin off, just let the bones guide you. The bones in a pike are in the form of a ""Y"". Find the bones down the center of the fillet with your finger. Now take the knife and carefully cut down until you feel the resistance of the bones. Take your knife and angle it away towards the edge of the fillet and let it slide along the top of the bones, you'll be able to feel and see them. Now flip the fillet over and do the same on the other side, using the exposed bones as your guide. Finally, carefully remove the small remaining strip from the front side of the Y. You'll end up with three smaller strips of meat, and a strip of bones. I know that's probably impossible to visualize and follow, but take your time with a couple fish and sharp knife. Visualize the bones and follow their structure and you'll be surprised how self explanatory the whole process is once you're in there. Just remember - feel the bones and cut along them, like you're shaving the meat off the bone. A little patience to get the hang of it will pay off big time. You do lose a little meat when deboning, but it's nothing compared to what's wasted picking the bones out, and it makes for a great meal. (Compared to boiled pike anyway! Yeck, that sounds awful!) I actually prefer a nice sized pike caught in cold water to walleye. Waxy"

Its like anything else, a bit of practice and you'll be a pro, and your friends will be envious of how you can debone pike!! Have fun on the fly in trip, sounds like a blast."
