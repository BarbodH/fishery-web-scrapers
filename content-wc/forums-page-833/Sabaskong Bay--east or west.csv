That is one of the best things about Mylie's. When there is a stiff wind, you don't have to go out through that gap into the open water to the west. That is just a suicide run. We've had to do it before, but not anymore, thank god. It is too hard on the boat and the body and the nerves to bounce through there. Yikes. Anyone else know what I'm talking about?"

536838,MTJ,2004-01-22 07:18:00,106,"Been there done that. I can't count the times I've headed out through the Gap headed west to only make it to the Fox Islands and realize that I may have made a bad decision. It's a long run into the Sunset to seek cover from there. Only to have to cross bad water again at Rabit Point to get home. I haven't fished for walleyes much east, but I would agree with the Horseshoe area for Muskies, especially early in the season."

536701,Ia Walihntr,2004-01-18 11:53:00,320,"I know everyone that fishes Sabaskong Bay, with any consistency, has their favorite spots that they fish regularly. When you find the good spots,you usually don't have to go far for good fishing for any spiecies. Some will fish mostly near Hansons Bay. Some will fish mostly near Nestor Falls, and the rest will be somewhere between. I'm just curious to see which areas get the most fishing pressure. HERE'S THE QUESTION: If you could only fish one small area of Sabaskong Bay between Hanson's Bay and Nestor Falls, what area would that be? (I realize that it may have a lot to do with which resort you stay at, but maybe you like the fishing in a certain area and that's why you stay at the resort you do!) Thanks for the participation. Marv"
536740,Matches,2004-01-19 22:33:00,236,"That's a tough question the way you put it, if you could only fish one small area.......... I guess maybe the area around Hay Island, you just may find the crappies too!!"
536742,Slayer,2004-01-20 07:21:00,41,"I'd say around Hay as well. Out as far as Rabbit to the West and Stony Portage to the East. ""Slayer"""
536749,Guest,2004-01-20 10:55:00,0,Why go to a lake the size of Lake of the Woods and only fish one area?
536750,VMS,2004-01-20 11:45:00,1103,To learn every little bit of information you can about the area. You just might find a gem of a spot that nobody else knows about.
536778,PJM,2004-01-20 21:23:00,3516,Rgate Here is a question for you. Do you know Lake of the Woods very well and do you fish a lot. If you do fish a lot where would you suggest?
536779,wallidiver,2004-01-20 21:44:00,50,"The first question that should be asked is what time of year are you talking about? What type of technique do you enjoy fishing the most? Do you like to fish the reefs, troll, pitch jigs, cast. We make an annual trip the first week of June each year and fish out of Nestor Falls. The fishing this time of year is usually so good you wouldn't have to venture out more than 5 miles to have a good days fishing. We enjoy trying new areas and over the years have built quite a healthy milk run of spots to fish. We might end out 20 miles or so, but it's not that you have to it's the rush of finding that new honey hole. The total experience of Lake of the Woods is something everyone should experience at least once."

536787,Guest,2004-01-21 11:06:00,0,Depends on the time of year and what you're fishing. For walleyes I prefer July and a number of good reefs from Dawson Island to North Island which is a big area. Late September and early October is also good for big walleyes but they bite light and are found in about 30 feet of water where there is some current.
536792,PJM,2004-01-21 12:47:00,3516,rockpt I know who he is I was just playing with him. He took my Dad and I out last summer and we caught some very nice fish and I plan on doing it again this summer........
