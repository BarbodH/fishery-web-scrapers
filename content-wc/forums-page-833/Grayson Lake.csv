536809,Guest,2004-01-21 18:25:00,0,"I paddled through Grayson a couple of summers ago. Northwest of Whitewater I think? Anyhow, if it's the same lake you're in for a good trip. I was there in July so things will be much different in May. I remember a really nice camp on an island near the east shore. Most likely the one you booked. Concentrate on the rivers flowing in and out. In the summer I paddled down the outflow to Whitewater lake. If you're willing to leave the boat and walk the shoreline downstream, the second (I think) set of rapids was LOADED with walleye. 3"" twister tails tipped with a worm, a selection of Shad Raps, and a handfull of spoons (weedless and non) is pretty much all you'll need."
