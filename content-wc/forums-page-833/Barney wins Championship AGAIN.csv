536852,Guest,2004-01-22 20:10:00,0,This Barney must be one heck of a fisherman. Seems like he gets his name on this board all the time. How do you get on this Walleye Cicuit or is Barney so good that he cant be beat? Does Barney have a TV show?
536857,Guest,2004-01-23 09:36:00,0,I heard only two guys fish the circiut and the other is some overgrown lunatic from Kansas that couldn't catch a cold naked in Alska in January. Barney lets the fellow hold his fish for pictures though. Seems like Barney is a pretty good guy eh'
536859,Guest,2004-01-23 11:42:00,0,"Dear topwater tom.....You have been sadly informed. First of all you need to learn how to spell Alaska. Second of all the only reason that there are just two of us on the cicuit is that the thousands of fisherman who have tried to qualify for the cicuit have simply failed to meet the high standards of the circuit. One of the reasons that most of them fail is they cant spell and they fish way too much topwater to catch the Hog Walleyes that it takes to qualify for the circuit. I believe the ""TOPWATER SYNDROME"" is from old Pike habits. Tom, if you would like to try to qualify go to the lake and borrow somebodys Walleye to get your picture taken with and send the picture and $100 to me with a 500 word essay ( correct spelling) explaining why you would like to join the Circuit. I will let you know if you are qualified to join witin 30 days....SEND CASH."
536890,Guest,2004-01-26 13:58:00,0,I was lucky enough to be at the the crowning of Barney last year as the circuit champion. His speech was one that I will never forget. He told of how he was raised in Illinois and he was the 7th son of a 7 generation sharecropper. Barney talked of how he worked in the field form sunrise to sunset 7 days a week. He said that finally at the age of three times 7 (21) he snuck away at 7 in the evening on the 7th day of the 7th month and fished for the first time in his life. He cut a 7 ft willow rod and put 7 ft of twine on it and landed his first 7 lb Walleye. It started a career that has made Barney the 7th wonder of the world a true Walleye Champion. It does not surprise me that Barney is the Champion again. I expect him to win the Championship at least 7 more times.
