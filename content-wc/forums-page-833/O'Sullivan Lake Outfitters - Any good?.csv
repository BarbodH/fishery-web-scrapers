We plan to fish their main lake and take our own boat. They say the gravel road is 18 miles. I searched this forum and could not find any commentaries on this fishing location. Does anyone have any experiences with this outfitter? If so, how are the accomodations? We will do the housekeeping cabin. Clean? Good working order? How is the fishing? What time of year were you there? What can we reasonably expect? Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks, O F"

I talked with an older gentleman a few years back at the Columbus Sports Show and he told me it is a very clean camp and the fishing was pretty good. Let me know what you find out."

We always liked the camp and the family that ran it are nice folks. The lake is interesting and produces some pretty good catches. The last twenty or so miles to camp are a gravel road. No big deal at all. Rocks could ding up a boat if you go too fast. But that is true anywhere. Since we were last there they have added new docks and upgraded the camp in general. It's been several years since we were there so I can't tell you alot about what they are doing now. We usually caught lake trout while fishing for walleye every trip. (July/August) Which surprised us. On one trip a young man picked up about a 15# northern right off of the dock before his parents even had their car unloaded. Very exited young man. As drive in camps go, I rate it very well. It's better than a couple fly-ins we've been to. Much cheaper than most any fly in also. Plus if the weather stinks you can leave early. Search for their website. It is pretty informative. Good luck. If I can help just email me. Pooch"
