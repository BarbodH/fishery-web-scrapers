It is probably just an incentive for non-residents to get their deposits in early. I would not complain, at least they are refunding your tax. I just spent 3 weeks in Chicago at sport shows, and let me tell you, I paid alot of accommodation tax and purchased alot of stuff. I am sure the US gov. is not going to refund any of it."
536802,McQ,2004-01-21 16:40:00,615,"I am certainly not against free enterprise but this one really drives me nuts. A claimant is going to give up 20%/or minimum $10 of their eligible refund to a middleman who is just not required. The claim forms are readily available at a great number of locations and it would take less time to process the refund directly. Sorry resort owner you are skirting an issue here and it doesn't fall under the category of tour operator to the best of my knowledge. Here's the math on a typical trip: Cost on American Plan $1,000 CNDN 50% of invoice qualifies as GST creditable (accomodation). $500 GST @ 7% = $35 Minimum charge $10 applies - this is one very expensive solution when you consider the amount of time to complete the required forms is less following the standard government method and your cost is a postage stamp. As far as I know the government will process a standard claim within 4 weeks. Less than a third of time required with your recommended service. Where's the logic?"
536805,Guest,2004-01-21 18:02:00,0,"I am not going to argue this point. Revenue Canada allows us to Charge 3.5% on packages. You should read the end of the example I left for you. The ""I am going on fishing/hunting trip to Canada"" example. Your example: Your trip american plan...(cabin, boat & motor, meals) you get a rebate on only your cabin if I break this bill down. Your way $1000.00 x 7% =$70.00 Total cost....$1070.00 Now you have to fill out a form, mail it in or stop at a duty free, etc. you will get your refund on the accommadation part of the bill only. If it is 50% of the bill, which it won't be, you will receive $35.00 back. Our way. the trip cost $1000.00 x 3.5% =$35.00 Total cost $1035.00 No forms, no duty free stop, no postage, no wait. The guest is happy, I am happy, revenue canada is happy."
536810,McQ,2004-01-21 18:38:00,615,Resort Owner and others who have an interest in this subject. First off Resort Owner is right although the explanation is somewhat over simplified and involved a reference that wasn't clear. Here is the REV/CAN link on the subject that explains everything in great detail. It applies solely to package deals and shouldn't be interpreted any other way. The restrictions are covered very well and all misinterpretations can be cleared up. To answer the first query that started this subject - you must pay the full charge in advance not a percentage.http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/gm/b-064/b-064-e.htm Confusion can arise when responding to posts that don't carry all the details. If my responses in any way contributed to the confusion I apologize.

536811,rebelrn2001,2004-01-21 20:09:00,1563,So let me get this straight. I bring my own food and boat so I don't qualify for the reduced GST up front?

536835,McQ,2004-01-22 05:24:00,615,"The up front rebate applies to package deals that are completely paid in advance only. Copied from text of the government guidelines: A non-resident individual who purchases accommodation only (i.e., the accommodation is not part of a tour package) can choose to claim either a rebate of the actual GST paid OR a flat rebate of $5 per night per room invoiced up to a maximum of $75 per claim. The limit of $75 does not apply if the individual chooses to claim a rebate of the actual GST paid. For accommodation which is part of a tour package, a non-resident individual can choose to claim either a rebate of 50 per cent of the actual GST paid on the tour package OR a flat rebate of $5 per night per room invoiced up to a maximum of $75 per claim. Again, the limit of $75 does not apply if the individual chooses to claim a rebate of 50 per cent of the actual GST paid on the tour package. The option an individual chooses (i.e., actual GST paid OR $5 flat rebate) to claim the accommodation rebate must be used consistently throughout the claim. When claiming a GST rebate for eligible accommodation, non- resident individuals must submit original receipts verifying that the GST was paid and showing the number of nights of accommodation provided. Credit card slips and photocopies of receipts are not acceptable."

536516,rebelrn2001,2004-01-12 18:57:00,1563,"I read somewhere (a few months back) that if we send 20% downpayment or more to the camp in Canada 60 days ahead of our trip, that then the camp doesn't have to charge us the GST that we would get back at the border anyway? Is this true and where can I get some official info on this? We really don't buy anything of significance while in Canada (over $50) other than the lodging so that is all we really get back anyway. I just talked to my camp operator in Canada and he has never heard that before."
536521,bigfish1965,2004-01-12 20:33:00,3210,Never heard of it either.
536538,Reels,2004-01-13 13:37:00,2876,We have had some lodge owners say that to us too. Only if a large deposit. <{{}}><
536541,McQ,2004-01-13 14:31:00,615,"Gentlemen, the lodge owner may be using this sort of a statement to encourage a deposit. GST is a federal tax and must be paid - either by you or the operator. If the operator chooses to waive payment by you he is absorbing the cost. It really has nothing to do with you making the appropriate claim for refund on the lodging and/or meals part of the bill. Your invoice should include the tax even if he paid it. Not unlike any sort of early bird bonus but someone is paying somewhere in the system."
536542,bigfish1965,2004-01-13 14:58:00,3210,Of course if the deposit ia in cash...well thats a whole new ballgame. ;)
536549,Guest,2004-01-13 17:47:00,0,It sure does change things......
536794,Guest,2004-01-21 13:28:00,0,"If a guest sends in a deposit early, the resort owner can charge only 3.5% instead of 7% on package plans. You only get your GST rebate on accommadations and on purchases you take home. You do not get the rebate on boats and motors or meals etc, anything you use in Canada. If you just rent a cabin, and bring your own food and boat, the resort owner must charge GST, but you can get the whole amount back as a refund. If you are on American Plan or a cabin and boat package, as long as the resort owner charges it as a package it will only have 3.5% GST on the bill, which is like getting your refund for your cabin. It all depends how you are billed, (if it is one package price or if it is broken down). If the deposit was not sent in early, then you will be charged the regular 7%, with little chance of the refund. If the resort owner does give you the rebate and he is audited, he will be responsible for the GST not paid."
536796,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-21 13:54:00,323,Resort Owner I am not understanding how the timing of my deposit would have any bearing on a GST refund .I would think after I have paid you in full I would get a reciept showing I have paid for a cabin or an american plan trip and the ny GST would be figured accorordingly.I would appriciate a more complete explination if you can. Thanks in advance. Atlanta Dave
536798,McQ,2004-01-21 15:12:00,615,"I'd like to see the legislation that allows this step to be taken. My understanding of GST law is that it must be paid. I for one am not aware of any right an operator has that allows the reduction of any GST on site. The accomodation part qualifies for rebate for a non-resident and a claim form must be submitted to REV/CAN. Claim forms are available at the resort (sometimes), Canada Customs and Duty Free Shops."
536799,Guest,2004-01-21 16:17:00,0,"Here is the answer: TOUR PACKAGES I purchased a tour package to visit Canada. Am I able to claim the GST/HST that I paid? Answer: You will be able to claim 50% of the GST/HST that you paid. The reason you are only able to claim 50% is that a tour package is usually made up of an accommodation component as well as several other ineligible components (transportation, admissions, entertainment, etc.) We recognize the fact that tax has been paid in part on accommodation and therefore, refund 50% of the tax rather than asking for a specific breakdown on the actual cost of the accommodation. I purchased my tour package at home in Great Britain but I cannot find the amount of GST/HST that I paid on my invoice. Where would it be located? Answer: Many times the tour operator rebates the tax at source (in effect, does not charge you the applicable tax) since they know that they are selling a supply to a non-resident of Canada. The invoice will reflect this fact and the claimant will not be entitled to a refund on their accommodation as it was already credited at the time of purchase. TOUR PACKAGES (Hunting/Fishing trips) I went on a hunting trip to Canada. Am I eligible for a refund? Answer: The same rules that would apply to a tour package would apply to a hunting or fishing trip (50%). Sometimes, however, the outfitter will show a cost breakdown. If this is the case, you will be able to claim the exact amount of applicable tax paid on the accommodation vs. 50% of the tax paid on the total package.www.canadasalestaxrefunds.com/gstfaq I hope this answers your questions."
