536858,Guest,2004-01-23 11:02:00,0,Anyone recommend any good books with northwoods fishin' and huntin' stories to get me thru the winter?
536862,Guest,2004-01-23 19:09:00,0,"For fishing try North with Doc by Greg Knowles. If you like fly fishing and waterfowling stories check out the Gordon Macquarrie trilogy. For upland game hunting try A hunter's road by Jim Fergus. Another good book I just finished reading is Tales from the Marsh and other Drivel by Leonard Lisenbee. These are a number of short stories by a retired game warden. And lastly if you want a funny coffee table book, check out Misery Loves Company from Ducks Unlimited."
536865,manitobawalleye,2004-01-24 08:17:00,885,for a mix of both with great humour read the patrick mcmanus series i have read and re-read them all over the years my wife cannot understand how you can suddenly break out laughing while reading
