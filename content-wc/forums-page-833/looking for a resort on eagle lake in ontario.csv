536888,JoeUpnorth,2004-01-26 11:40:00,17,"I have stayed at a couple of different lodges on Eagle Lake and the last three years we have been staying at Deer Trail Lodge. The lodge is in a good location on the lake, you can head up the West Arm, fish Vermilion Bay or make a trip south to some of the walleye reefs and there is always great fishing spots in between. The cabins are only a few years old and they range in size to match your fishing party. The boats are nice and roomy and the motors a dependable. Ruth and Richard are great hosts and will make you feel as welcome as if they have known you for years. They really do take good care of you. Last year just at dusk, I got a little careless hand landing (dunb) a small pike and ended up with a treble hook sunk into my hand. Ruth drove me to the hospital, stayed with me for almost three hours (we got home at 1:00 am) and made sure that Richard knew about it so he could see how I was getting along (fishing) that morning. Here's the number if you have questions for them 1-888-260-4486 Hope this helps and have great trip on a great lake."
536889,Ia Walihntr,2004-01-26 13:12:00,320,"BIGEYEJOHN, An update of my last post: web addresses should have been: Deer Trail Resort www.deertrail.on.ca Bear Trail Resort www.beartrailresort.ca Sportsmen Lodge www.heartland.on.ca/sportsmen Stanleys Resort www.stanleys.com"
536891,MrEyes,2004-01-26 19:47:00,360,"BigJohn I have stayed on Eagle Lake 2 years at Temple Bay. It's a nice lodge. My question is what do you want to catch. If your doing the walleye/northern/smallmouth thing then check and see where the lodges are located and the type of water your going to be fishing. If your going for Muskie then I would recommend going to Centry Lodge. I feel that the water on that end of the lake holds more muskie. There is a big difference in water color between the 2 sides of the lake. With Centry Lodge having very stained water and Temple, Northshore and fin and feather all having clearer water. Mark"
536896,BIGEYEJOHN,2004-01-27 05:35:00,95,"thanks for all your input guys, i am looking for mostly walleye fishing. i have narrowed it down to a few, any people have anything good or bad to say about temple bay lodge? i kinda like that one, because we dont need to drive up there, just a nice ride in a big bus......lol"
536897,JoeUpnorth,2004-01-27 06:02:00,17,You should have good luck catching nice walleye in that area of the lake. I think there are a couple of threads for Eagle Lake at a website called Lake-Link. Try and track someone down who has stayed there. Joe
536898,catchNrelease,2004-01-27 08:33:00,157,"We go to Temple Bay Lodge every year. They have a nice setup with the bus, no worries about driving etc.. We did the bus thing for 2 years, now we drive and bring our own boat. Any questions, feel free to ask."
536900,BIGEYEJOHN,2004-01-27 09:47:00,95,"is it worth it to bring your own boat? i have a nice walleye rig with a gps that i love, but not sure if i want to drag it all the way up there. is there a good lake map around?"
