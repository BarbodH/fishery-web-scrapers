536806,Guest,2004-01-21 18:06:00,0,Does any one know about purchasing a used boat and bringing it back to Canada? I found a few used units approx $20 000 US and would like to purchase one but I'm not sure if I would get charged duty at the border. Has anyone done this??? T Bay Fisher

There is no no duty but you will have topay GST and PST to bring the boat back into Canada. Your price will be converted and the taxes will then be paid. $20,000x1.35= $27,000x1.15=$31050 Hope this helps,"
