They charge you like an extra $5-10 for tanks without the new OPD. It's a one-time thing and you'll be set with a tank that has a the new style. Also, propane dealers will change them for you as well for a minimum fee. I had three of them and was able to exchange all of them and now have all the new, legal type. Just for your info."

Here in Oklahoma, if you stencil paint in red the words ""Welding Gas"" on the side of the tank, they will fill your older tanks with the old style valve assembly. I have done two this way and have no problem getting them filled anywhere. Might be worth a try. The new valve can be installed on your tanks, but they are $20+ to do so just for the valve. Hawker"
