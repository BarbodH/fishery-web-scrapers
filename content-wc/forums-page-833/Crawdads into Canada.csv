536756,Guest,2004-01-20 13:31:00,0,Don't know where you're going but they're easy to catch on LOTW at night. Just go along the shoreline with a flashlight and you'll see their eyes glowing in the shallow water. The coons catch them and leave their claws all over the rocks.
536760,Guest,2004-01-20 14:43:00,0,Oky....You cant take crawdads into canada. But you can bring lobster so when you get to your camp call me ...I love lobster.
536762,Guest,2004-01-20 15:19:00,0,You can't bring them into Canada but depending on where you are staying you can pick up all the crabs you would ever use from some of the locals.

536845,Guest,2004-01-22 16:22:00,0,Last summer on LOTW I caught dozens of big crawdads while jigging for eyes in 20 feet. They'd grab onto my minnow and not let go. I've never used them for bait but I think eyes do eat crawdads.
