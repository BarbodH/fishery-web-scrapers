Can make a difference a little bit in presentation. The north arm fish feed primarily on crayfish, while out east they rely more on smelt."

So you want to fish the rocks points out in fron of the spawing areas. I tend to throw a lot of topwater, and kalins grubs. If its later you might run in to a tough bite, but try throwing both hard and soft plastic jerkbaits. I hope you have a great time. Where are you staying?"
536748,Guest,2004-01-20 10:02:00,0,"I haven't fished Rainy in a few years. However, when we did our early June trips, we would typically find the bass very tight to boulder strewn shorelines. Surface lures, or floating raps twitched were good. But tube jigs in crawfish colored patterns produced the largest fish for us. As one of the other guys said, if you are pre-spawn, the fishing can be great, and particularly for the big females. I don't know why, but on rainy or overcast days on Rainy, anything with orange on it out-produced everything else for bass. Rattlin' rogues with the orange belly, shad raps or fat raps with any orange in the color pattern seemed to work. Good luck."

We use mostly soft plastic baits such as sluggo's and cenco's etc. White is usually the best colour, although depending on the weather conditions yellow's or pumkin works well. Husky Jerks also work well, but I do not like to use them that much because of all the treble hooks and the damage they do to the fish. Bring some tube jigs of various colours. They are always good because the many big northerns will always steal anything you throw. Bring lots of jigs.lol. The great thing about Rainy Lake is that it full of boulder reefs and points. This is why it is such a great bass lake. Good Luck."
