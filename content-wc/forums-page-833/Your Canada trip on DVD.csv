536834,AL,2004-01-22 05:20:00,89,"Fellow Walleye Fisherman, I have recently started creating my own DVD's of my wilderness trips and for family. I have gotten to the point that I, and my friends and family, all agree they are better than the ones you can purchase from stores (home movie style). This is also my problem. I am considering this as a part time hobby for extra fishing gear cash. I need a totally unbiased opinion of my work from somebody who isn't worried about hurting my feelings with constructive ways of improvement. I am offering to make one person a DVD of one of their, or a combination of several, Canadian fishing trips. In return I want an honest opinion of the work and a list of questions regarding the movie creation answered. The movie contents can be gathered from conventional pictures (I will scan them), digital pictures and most camcorder recordings. I will add music, titles, captions, etc. The details can be worked out. I first need to see if there's any interest on this board? Let me know. AL"

536846,AL,2004-01-22 17:39:00,89,"Mike, I going to do this video free of charge. I'm looking for the feedback to help improve the quality. I have made several so far and the perfect 20-30 minute video takes about 300 pictures. That leaves each picture on screen for 3-4 seconds with a 1 second cross disolve between frames. How many picture do you have and are they digital or regular photos? AL"
536850,Reels,2004-01-22 18:35:00,2876,"AL, I have a pretty big digital scrap bok with mpgs and jpgs. I'll even pay you to do it if it turns out nice. Drop me a line.[email protected] <{{}}><"
536853,bigfish1965,2004-01-22 21:21:00,3210,Al you may even be able to make some promotional DVD's for Charter Captains if you can make them at a somewhat reasonable price. The smart promoter would see these as the next thing in advertising.
536855,Guest,2004-01-23 08:53:00,0,I have about 20 hours of video over six or seven trips. Let me know if you're interested.
536866,Guest,2004-01-24 10:22:00,0,"A great idea! I have seen technology oriented folks put these together for weddings,etc. I'm kinda technically challenged. I would love to have something like this done. I have a lot of standard photo prints and will be taking my first digital camera shots on my two outpost trips this summer. My guess is you probably will have plenty of takers on this but I would definitely be interested if you are still looking. I could also help you with your feedback request as I worked with outfitters for years on brochures, bookings, etc in a previous job. You can email me at [email protected]."
