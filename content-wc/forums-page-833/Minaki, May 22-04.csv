536682,Guest,2004-01-17 15:26:00,0,"He is talking about the ""south"" Duck Bay, the one off of Gunn Lake. It's well known for crappie. Also right across from the Minaki Lodge is a good spot. Depending on what map you look at it is known as ""Lost Lake"". Head up towards Big Sand, and go into ""Hidden Lake"" this is also very good for crappie. When you get into Hidden, head straight into the lake and go into the far ""right corner"" this is where I have found the nicest crappie. Now a few things about going after these fish. When heading into Lost, be careful it is shallow. When heading into Hidden, be even more careful. It is rocky & shallow. When I go into Hidden, I always motor up & use my thruster to get in. It's also a good practice to have someone up front ""pointing"" the direction to travel. The best to do is stay in the middle when going in. When you get thru the narrow channel, you are then good to go. No major rocks to be concerned about (so I have found, SO FAR). After you get into these 3 spots you'll find other fish than crappie. I have caught & seen caught some BIG pike. 20lb plus range. Duck Bay is hot for BIG pike early on in the year. Hidden also produces BIG pike, but Duck seems to produce more. I have seen also BIG Musky in this area caught, but early on in the season - when Musky isn't open yet. The smallmouth action on Hidden can be hot as well with some real nice ones to be had here. I fish the shorlines for them and always do well. I have not fished Duck for smallies so I can't say what it can be like. All in all, my personal choice would be Hidden first, then Duck. Only because it's a 5 min boat ride from the cabin to Hidden or a 25 min run to Duck. There are many other ""hotspots"" but I'll save that info for another time................ Good Fishen Rob"

536688,Guest,2004-01-17 21:35:00,0,"Last I spoke to the Calgary boys, Turbo said that they were working on ""plans"". I think he said that the golf course will be open, which I guess means to include Dockside & it's related business. I guess that means Martini's will be available ? ! Last I heard, they were off overseas. I called Turbo actually earlier tonight & all I just got voice mail. Interesting note, in todays local papers the fire investigator in Ontario said that he is unable to determine the cause of the Lodge fire. Thus the file is now ""closed"". The O.P.P. have also ""closed"" their file. Seems now we'll never know...... and that sucks ! GoodFishen Rob"
536882,Guest,2004-01-25 23:00:00,0,Still looking for anymore advice
536894,Guest,2004-01-26 20:57:00,0,We are headed to Minaki for our six year. We have a new guy with us that got a DUI a couple years ago. I do not want to beat a dead horse knowing it has been posted a hundred times but can somebody point me in the right direction in getting him across please. Any phone number or web site would be greatly appreciated. Headed up the first weekend in June again and I sure hope we can repeat last years Luck. Thank You.
536600,Guest,2004-01-14 21:08:00,0,Heading up to MInaki on this date. Have only fished Minaki in late June. How does this time relate to late June. Presentation/location etc. Fish mostly walleye. Will also hunt pike / bass Thank You Jim
536613,Guest,2004-01-15 07:11:00,0,"Nebraska Jim, Fishing can be great this time of the year but mother nature plays a big role with the location and the bite. Early ice out or late ice out water temp etc. Usually you need to look for protected bays with warmer temps to attract the bait fish. Pick bays that are protected from a north wind. Pitching 1/8 ounce jigs or light lindy is the way to go as the walleyes will be shallow. Also check out current areas that are close to the mouths of small rivers that dump into the winnepeg. Northerns will be shallow and aggressive at this time of the year also. Good luck I will be up the first week of june, first week of August and over labor day. Love this place. BKT from Nebraska"
536639,Guest,2004-01-15 19:21:00,0,Thanks for the info. This is what I thought but wasn't too sure. Jim
536645,Guest,2004-01-15 22:12:00,0,"I should have added, what about the river at this time of year ? Jim"
536649,Reels,2004-01-16 05:41:00,2876,"Depends heavily on the water level. It can be great, or it can suck. A good moderate current seems to be best. Hopefully they have some winter run off this year. <{{}}><"
536658,Guest,2004-01-16 09:23:00,0,NebraskaJim: How about a tip for a 1st timer on LOTW in late June 04.Thanks in advance.
536665,Guest,2004-01-16 18:25:00,0,"I fish out of Birch Island the last week of May. I fish primarily smallmouth with some crappie and walleye thrown in. If the water tempature is in the 60's, the smallmouth will be up in 2 to 6 feet of water. I use jigs with soft plastics. I catch walleye shallow, and deep with bottom bouncers or Wolf River rigs. If the water temp is in the upper 40's or the 50's, you might try trolling a number 11 rapala minnow over the emerging weeds in 5 to 7 feet depth along the shoreline for walleye. I use 14 pound stren florocarbon as a leader, which reduced pike and musky bite offs on my last trip by about 90%. If the leader gets frayed, change it immediately. Make sure you check the florocarbon leader after every Esox that is hooked if you decide to use one. If the smallmouth are up shallow, you will catch big numbers by casting a #11 rapala minnow with white sides and a blue (black less preferred) back. You might want to crush (pinch down) your barbs to make it easier to release the fish. Good luck, Don"
536667,Reels,2004-01-17 06:32:00,2876,"Hey Don, Were would be a good spot for Crappie? My 11 year old is going for the second time this year, and he has never caught one. I dont think I have ever caught one in Minaki either, but have seen some nice fish. I'll be up there the first week of June this year. Thanks for the tips last year. The Florocarbon made a huge difference. <{{}}><"
536669,Guest,2004-01-17 07:20:00,0,"Reels, With 1/16 ounce jigs heads, any color, though I use white with red eyes from Cabelas, 6 pound line (I use gold stren) and 2 inch white cajun critters (Basspro), though any color would probably work, fish the left back area of Duck Bay south if the water is not low (if it is high, then you are really in business), Lost Lake, and Hidden Bay. If you can find dead, broken off, subsurface bull rushes, in 2 1/2 to 4 feet of water, get ready. I catch everything, including walleye, up to 18 inch smallmouth, tons of perch (some jumbos) and unbelievable numbers of those pesky pike, except Musky with this setup, though my partner had a 28-30 inch musky on a cajun till it wrapped around a dead head. I will be up there fishing from May 28 to June 2 in a Birch Island boat. I wear glasses, am 200 pounds, with gray hair, fishing with gold stren, and 49 years old. My fishing partner is 70. There may be a third guy in the boat perhaps. Hope to say hi to you all and we can swap fishing reports, Don PS: Feel free to stop by the lodge and we can trade lies."
536671,Reels,2004-01-17 08:25:00,2876,"Sounds good Don, I have a green Lund 1900 with a 200 Yamaha. Recliner for a drivers seat, and go about 6'1"" and 285. Hard to miss. 39, and I will be with my 11 year old as said before. My brother is going also, so most like will be three in our boat. I will be at Barbers, not too far away, so we will stop by and say hi. Duck bay- Do you mean the one off little sand, or on the way to Gunn down by you? <{{}}><"
