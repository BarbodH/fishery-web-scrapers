We would be interested on feedback from folks that may have stayed at Evergreen, Big Eagle, or Colegrove's. We plan to fish in August with the priority being Big Pike, Musky, and Walleye in that order. How would you rate their cabins, docking, fish cleaning house, location, distance to good fishing, etc. Thanks for the information."

Defiantly worth a look also.You'll get more info there then anywhere else. Good cabins has american plan if you want great docking and full time dock boys.best area on eagle and also most dangerous as far as boating.many submerged rocks.the muskie and walleye fishing is very good although i catch pike i dont find it very good.mostly smaller up 30-35""."
