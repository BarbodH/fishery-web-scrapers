6388838,prov1800,2020-01-23 09:57:00,5010,"All 3 sleds are mountain sleds,so no problems.I didnt even know i was in slush till the other 2 guys told me.haha. No problems getting to the shack ever."
6388878,Eckohlt,2020-01-23 10:56:00,3685,"Sounds good John,glad to hear you didn't have to stand in 3ft of slush trying to get unstuck,it can be a nightmare that stuff,rod"

6389156,prov1800,2020-01-24 06:54:00,5010,Went ice shack yesterday ron.redeemed myself.caught a lotcof walleye and probably lost one of the biggest walleyes ive ever seen.tried earlier around 2 was slow for first hour but hooked into the big girl right away higher up in the water column.then around 3 the bite really started but ended within a hr.probably caught around 25 or so.all on a 1/8 oz white marabou jig.toward end i was picking up one here and there on a straight hook.walleye dinner tonight.
6389206,Eckohlt,2020-01-24 09:13:00,3685,"Man you know how to get a guy pumped up,I have to settle for pizza tonight,but I will make up for it when I'm there,eye for lunch n dinner lol,rod"
6389216,[email protected],2020-01-24 09:25:00,4,"Just wondering about ice conditions as you hit the various lakes. Is the thickness less than a ""normal"" year? A foot doesn't seem like a lot. Tom"
6389266,prov1800,2020-01-24 11:32:00,5010,"The walleye lakes are all 16+"".its always the deep trout lakes that freeze slow.we have quite a bit if snow cover niw so that will slow making more ice.weather still mild but its pretty normal for ice rìght now.it will still slowly build some more if weather gets colder but snow is a good insulator."
6389270,prov1800,2020-01-24 11:35:00,5010,Might add with the heavy snowload it creates lots of pressure which cracks ice and water leaks out creating slush which we have a lot of right now.
