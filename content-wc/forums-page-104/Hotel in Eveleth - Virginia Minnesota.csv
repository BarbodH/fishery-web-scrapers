6389830,Bad Santa,2020-01-26 17:00:00,100,Stayed at Pine View in Virginia several times. Never disappointed.
6389870,HeHooksHimself,2020-01-26 18:36:00,725,We stayed at the Amerc INN one time. They provide earplugs for a reason. The railroad tracks are right next to the hotel and it literally shakes you. Great deal though
6389888,Sniper1980,2020-01-26 20:07:00,33,Yup. And plenty of good escorts. Cheap price and great you right. Look them up
6390116,jbb1069,2020-01-27 14:21:00,33,Booked a room at Pineview Thanks for the feedback
6388874,jbb1069,2020-01-23 10:52:00,33,I have been staying at the Super 8 in Eveleth for years on my way to Lac Seul. Unfortunately they are all booked on July 3rd. I am looking for suggestions in the Eveleth/ Virginia area to over-nite and park my boat and truck Looking forward to the WC members feedback
6388896,LundDriver,2020-01-23 11:16:00,30,"We have been staying at the Hibbing Park Hotel the last couple of years. Not far from 53, parking for boat, and a bonus bar/restaurant on site."
6389118,Sniper1980,2020-01-24 03:54:00,33,Country store and motel in cook. Newly remodeled. Can‚Äôt beat it.
6389140,DavKin,2020-01-24 06:11:00,104,Try the Pine View morel in Eveleth. Half the price of Super 8. Nice clean and comfortable rooms. We stayed there last May and August.
6389582,rather-be-fishin,2020-01-25 19:41:00,429,"On July 3 you are going to have difficulty finding lodging in the Virginia/Eveleth area. There are lots of activities going on for the July 4th Holiday with lots of visitors to the area. Here is a list of motels to try contacting the sooner the better. You may also want to consider looking at the Duluth/Hermantown MN motels. Also Pine View is in Virginia not Eveleth & Hibbing is 30 miles southwest of Virginia.

6389656,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-26 07:34:00,8293,I might be mistaken but I think there is a Americ Inn just past the Sawmill in Virginia. Or maybe I'm thinking of another city.
6389684,jimirjr,2020-01-26 09:25:00,1149,STILL there.. We always stop at the SAWMILL on the way back from Lac Seul...
6389700,bigdaddyguns,2020-01-26 10:13:00,608,X2 on Pine View Inn good rooms and price. Stayed there a few times on way up to Canada year after we did the Super 8 in Eveleth. The only substantial difference I recall was the Super 8 had more variety for their breakfast buffet.
6389724,rather-be-fishin,2020-01-26 11:49:00,429,Yes there is an AmericInn but I had already checked availability for that day and no rooms are available.
6389740,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-26 12:45:00,8293,Got it. With the 4th on a Saturday rooms will be real hard to find.
