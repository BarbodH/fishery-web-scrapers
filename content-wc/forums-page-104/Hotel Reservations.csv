A current thread on this forum prompted me to start this new thread as a reminder to folks to consider making their hotel reservations if they haven't already done so. It's amazing how the hotels near the border and within Ontario fill-up with guests on Fridays during fishing season. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6388624,btyreprich,2020-01-22 15:59:00,1067,"We makes ours a year in advance. Once the dates are set for the trip, I'll sometimes call the hotel after we cross the border. Don't want to forget and have to stay in a town that is far away from the border. We like to roll out of bed early, cross the border, and eat in Ft Frances."

6388706,btyreprich,2020-01-22 21:08:00,1067,"McDonald in Fort Frances. Fast service compared to the location in International Falls, good food, clean restaurant, and it's on the way to Highway 71 which is our preferred road to Ear Falls."

6389164,tparker,2020-01-24 07:13:00,100,Boston's was still there on our trip last year. We stay at Copper River Inn and walk down to Boston's. Lively Fri. evening crowd and pretty good food.
