6386724,bcmss396,2020-01-15 18:15:00,296,Check out The Eddy in Kakabeka Falls. Great Burgers!

6386756,pjshorthorn,2020-01-16 06:02:00,5654,"I'm not sure if Dick and Nellie's in Sioux Lookout is still open. Maybe someone on here can confirm if they are,but they had decent food. More of a casual sports bar type restaurant . I believe the Forest Inn serves dinner as well as Anderson's Lodge. It has been a few years since I've fished out of Sioux Lookout so things may have changed somewhat. PjShorthorn"
6386794,wmd,2020-01-16 09:08:00,388,It is open but now called Dicks. Nellie apparently has left the business. wmd
6386814,elway12,2020-01-16 11:05:00,335,Thank you for all of the responses. We are adapting a little and planning on doing a lunch in Thunder Bay. Any suggestions for a good hot lunch spot in Thunder Bay? The burger place in K. Falls looks like a place we will check into as well!!
6386972,pjshorthorn,2020-01-17 05:14:00,5654,Thanks for the update. I have to get back to that end of the lake in the near future. Been too many years. PjShorthorn

If you like an all day breakfast menu, you will get a good one. If you are ready for lunch, there are a bunch of good choices. I eat there 3 times every summer on going back and forth to the Ignace area and have never been disappointed. They have even gotten to know me. And, I typically run into other acquaintances who go to the same camps I do."
