6388780,HeHooksHimself,2020-01-23 07:53:00,725,"gordy, thanks for the report. It is very useful for people considering their first fly-in. We have had similar experiences. I usually report on our trips, but one you might find interesting is a thread here on WC called ""Short report on Tennant Lake."" We actually had a cabin fall off it's foundation! I like your style, it would be great to drop a line with your group! Fish On! Hooks"

I always appreciate the posters who come back and update on their trip. IMO if you visit boards and are constantly asking about this lake or that lake its implied that you will come back and give an update - pay it forward so to speak. Doesn't need to be a novel or include a wealth of awesome pictures but an update that says ""fishing good, great outfitter, but not a lot of variety in the lake"" is so helpful. I think our groups would get on like fire as wellCheersAndrew"
