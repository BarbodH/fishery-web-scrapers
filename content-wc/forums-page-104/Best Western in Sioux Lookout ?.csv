6388010,Ndstallmann,2020-01-20 18:10:00,549,The best western is anyone with John Wayne!
6388020,pjshorthorn,2020-01-20 18:36:00,5654,"Jimi, Give the Lamplighter Inn a call. I've stayed there since 1982 and has always been decent. Rooms are basic set up, but have always been clean. They have a good breakfast in the morning if anyone would be interested. PjShorthorn"
6388102,Skywagon,2020-01-21 06:08:00,1106,"I attended a meeting at the Best Western in December, they were still open at that time, if they did close that is too bad, they would have been my #1 pick in town. I agree about the Sunset, I stayed in the front building one time, mostly natives, the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke and was not especially clean....The Lamplighter would be your next choice."
6388160,prov1800,2020-01-21 08:49:00,5010,I asked my wife who works in sioux.she said its open but the nane has changed to siouxlookout inn and suites.
