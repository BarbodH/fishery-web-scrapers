6388906,Guest,2020-01-23 11:36:00,0,I just wanted to share this great fishing competition on YThttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nODzxVjfTC4 What are your guy's thoughts?
6389014,turkeyriver,2020-01-23 16:53:00,80,Interesting concept. Definitely a twist on traditional fishing shows. You have to like the personalities of the guys to enjoy the show cause it's not just about the fishing.
6389148,MrSimon,2020-01-24 06:36:00,922,"I loved Season 1, and am loving Season 2. I think it's the most enjoyable fishing-related content on YouTube."
6389238,Esoxmike,2020-01-24 10:19:00,114,"Season 1 was awesome,season 2 just as good!Taro Murata is freakin hilarious!Best content on YouTube by far!Everyone who enjoys this should subscribe.Regular commercial tv fishing shows stink.I feel any support helps so outdoorsman like us can have some great stuff to watch when we r getting some well deserved couch time.Aaron Wiebe is phenomenal angler for his age and these shows are great entertainment with a wealth of knowledge.I know I sound like a teenage girl crowing about it,but these guys and Today's Angler are some of the best stuff out there!"
6389258,coldtuna,2020-01-24 11:11:00,25,"My 14 year old son and I loved the first season of 39 hours and have been big ""uncut angling"" fans for several years. That show actually got my son and I focused on fishing Canada several years ago, and has spurred our interest in a variety of canadian fishing adventures (e.g., big lake trout). The advertising dollars spent to back that show and these guys is well spent in my opinion. So far, we are enjoying season 2 quite a bit."
6389354,That Minnesota guy,2020-01-24 18:55:00,8293,Now that Aaron is sponsored by Warrior I wonder if the show will feature Warriors or AlumCrafts next year? Didn't see a Evinrude hanging on those boats either. Wonder if it was filmed before Evinrude bought AlumaCraft.

What I like is these guys are informative but it's ok to not do well also, which doesn't happen on tv fishing shows obv. I also enjoy watching Eric's YouTube channel. The excitement and passion all of them show is very relatable content. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
