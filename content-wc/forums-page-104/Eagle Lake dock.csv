6387838,Eckohlt,2020-01-20 08:44:00,3685,Go there early morning pick some strawberry for strawberry pancakes then catch some eyes n lake trout doesn't get any better than that
6387892,prov1800,2020-01-20 10:26:00,5010,Haha.funny.maybe catch fish first then go to coop and buy some strawberries
6387918,Eckohlt,2020-01-20 12:22:00,3685,"John I didn't know vermillion had a co-op probably bigger strawberry's there rather than the island,do they keep a plowed road open up until April 15?"
6387930,prov1800,2020-01-20 13:07:00,5010,We have a co op store.strawberries will be fresher .road might be plowed we will have to wait and see what kind of conditions there are when you get up here.everythibg woukd depend on snow load we will have.not much melting yet in early march. Road will be plowed from cabin to shack though.
