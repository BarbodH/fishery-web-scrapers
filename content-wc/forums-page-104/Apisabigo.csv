6388430,BHughes,2020-01-22 07:04:00,5,A group of 4 of us are booked for a week late June '20. What can you tell me about your experience with the cabin & fishing?
6388556,adempsey2.0,2020-01-22 11:53:00,611,I would watch Mike Borgers videos.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis...mFDvHoRgmUzW6_Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk
6389224,10lbeye,2020-01-24 09:44:00,61,"Just tried to send you a PM but not sure if it went through. I fished it last 3 years. Great lake, portage, and the folks who run it (Air Dale) are top notch. Shoot me a Pm w/ some contact info and I'll be glad to chat with you."
5032097,1-shot,2016-08-01 09:57:00,35,"Hello everyone. A group of 4 of us has booked a short 3 day trip to Lake Apisabigo with Air-dale in mid-august of this year. I have done a bit of research including reading and watching the great videos of Mike Borger's recap from last year. Based on the reports I have reviewed, it sounds like it should be a great time. I have downloaded the lake map and am trying to get a feel for where the fish may be on this lake at this time. We will mainly be targeting walleye but also like to tangle with the toothy critter for a change from time to time. Would love to have any pointers as far as areas where I might start and what type of setup to start with. I often times get to a lake and then find out from the locals that a particular color or technique is the best producer only to find out that I didn't pack that particular color, etc.... Although we have done numerous train-in, boat-in and drive in trips, this will be only our 2nd fly in trip (the first being on Nagagami in 2012 which was great). This prompts me to inquire, how do you bring live minnows out to a fly in outpost and is it worth the hassle or can you be just as successful using plastics? Trying to minimize all the searching since the trip is so short. thanks in advance. 1-shot."
5032505,adempsey2.0,2016-08-01 13:26:00,611,"How did you fish at Nagagami? It won't be much different. I wouldn't worry about minnows, especially in the summer. Nice to have, but totally unnecessary. Worms are easier to bring in if you want live bait. Especially if you like to troll harnesses, slow death or drift Lindy rigs. I am sure Mike would mark up a map for you. If it were me - albeit I am not a very good angler ;P - , I'd start fishing the points/steep drops off of the islands/shore on the side adjacent to the deepest part of the lake. I'd also try the creeks coming into the lake as well as all those neckdowns/narrows between the various lake sections and islands. Probably hit the two humps north of the island with the other camp - one is <12 feet the other is <18 feet. Which spots specifically would be dictated by the wind direction.There's an interesting looking flat at the northwest end of the lake too. I'd probably check that out one calm evening/morning as well.You can probably check out the most promising spots on the lake in the first day and go from there."
5035497,spw2350,2016-08-02 20:45:00,26,One of my favorite lakes we flew in at least 10 years in a row there lots of tips etc last trip in took my older brother in (his first fly in) and he caught 11lb walleye..... cost him $300 getting it mounted...he loved every minute of it send me pm and i will give you all the tips
5035561,forgop,2016-08-02 21:21:00,880,At least he made sure nobody else could catch it again. Sent from my SM-G935V using Tapatalk
5036105,spw2350,2016-08-03 07:32:00,26,Yup and at 70 years old on his once in a lifetime (literally) ever trip he displayed it proudly and made sure everybody that visited him saw it...I don't begrudge him one bit especially now that he has passed on it is a nice memory that he passed on to his only grandson.
5049393,1-shot,2016-08-09 09:15:00,35,Thanks for the information. Will be leaving next week and will post a report upon my return.
5075554,1-shot,2016-08-22 13:43:00,35,"Well our group of 4 returned last week from a 4 day trip with Air-Dale to Lake Apisabigo. This was our 2nd trip this year (June trip was to LakeEsnagi).We had a great time. The accomodations were excellent, the flight in was excellent and the fishing was great as well. Special thanks to Jen from Air dale for helping accommodate our group on such short notice. They really run a first class operation.After reviewing some of the previous postings and PM'ing with a couple of members, I had a bit of a game plan on how we would proceed. The group ahead of us told us on their way out the the portage lake at the south end was definitely worth the effort.On day 1, this being our first time on the lake we fished the main lake and caught a few eater size walleyes and some hammer handle pike trolling the shorelines in about 12-15 feet of water, but listening to all the other reports on how good the back lake was, I was itching to get back there and give it a try. I convinced the others in my group that we should definitely make an effort to find the back lake and they agreed.After taking a couple hours orientating our surroundings to the lake map, we finally found the trail to get back there. Then we had to transport another motor and all of our gear across the trail. Once we finally made it back however and got situated, we caught bunches of walleye (probably over 150- between 4 guys in a little over four hours time) on the first night. Nothing less than 15 inches and numerous fish 17-19 , 20-22 and a couple 23-24's. We didn't however hook a single pike in this back lake. We got out just before dark and had a great meal of fried walleye with taters/onions and some baked beans along with some nice cold beverages.The next 2 1/2 days consisted of more of the same. Fishing a couple hours on the main lake, and eventually making it back to the portage lake. It never got quite as good as that first evening on the portage lake, but we still consistently caught walleye anytime back there. All the fish were caught either trolling stick baits or jigging 1/4 oz. jigs tipped with crawlers or minnows. Gold colored rapala F 11 was our best stick bait, and live baited crawlers or minnows out fished the plastic grubs while jigging.The point just out past our cabin was a great morning and evening hot spot, however most of these fish were only between 14-17 inches.Overall it was a fantastic trip!!!Can't wait til next year. Still not sure where we'll go yet but I'll have the whole winter to figure that out.cheers1-shot"

As someone who's fished Esnagi, and who is booked for Apisabigo for next year, I'm interested in your thoughts as to how those 2 lakes compare in terms of numbers of decent sized (18-24 in) walleye? I'm guessing that Esnagi would generally hold better numbers of larger walleye (7-10 lb) because of its size... Also, how easy or difficult was the portage? Thanks and congrats on a great trip."

The portage at the south end is nothing. Very short - total piece of cake. The one further up the lake is about a 20 minute hike. Both lakes are excellent!Esnagi has both numbers of fish when you can find them and yes, much better trophy potential. BUT it can be a VERY tough nut to crack. I talked to someone who fished it earlier in the summer and they caught 4 walleyes all week LOL! I did very well on Esnagi but it took time to figure things out. The fish are on very specific spots and required some finesse to catch. I loved Esnagi to death and would go back but I can totally see how someone might struggle on that lake and be disappointed. Especially considering it's a fly in lake."
5084353,1-shot,2016-08-26 12:29:00,35,I agree with Mike on all counts.
