6388034,AsianAngler,2020-01-20 18:59:00,67,"Hello All, My current CPA is retiring and I need someone who can prepare my US taxes and advise me occasionally when the Canadian government asks me to fill out some bizarre form. I no longer rent my Canadian property, so I don't have to file Canadian taxes. CPAs I have communicated with generally want nothing to do with Canada except perhaps for FBAR forms. I am located in Illinois, but can work electronically with someone that is not local. The big international firms are too expensive and overkill for what I need. Willing to listen to suggestions for this issue. Thanks!"
6388058,Aspencreek,2020-01-20 20:55:00,2911,"My suggestion for the OP is to possibly contact a firm in Duluth or Detroit. They may certainly have to deal with both countries tax laws from time to time. Someone in IL would not be so ""lucky""."

6391106,Fisherman Ted,2020-01-30 11:01:00,461,"Actually it is Outside of the big 4 it is one of the largest and oldest. ""Homegrown Canadian accounting firm MNP LLP racked up another impressive year of net audit client gains in 2018, according to SEDAR analysis of public companies provided to Canadian Accountant by Audit Analytics, an independent research provider based in the United States."" The Calgary-based national firm had the second highest number of net client gains (15) of public companies outside the Big Four, but the third highest gain in audit fees among all accounting firms, behind KPMG Canada and PwC Canada respectively. MNP also ranked fifth among all Canadian auditors in total market cap of its new clients, surpassing the $1 billion mark."" Calgary, Alberta-based MNP is one of the largest accounting and business advisory firms in Canada, with over 4,000 staff and offices across the entire country."" But that's not really the point is it. He wants a firm that can do cross border tax advising. These are difficult to find, trust me. Especially if you are not Apple or Tesla. For smaller companies and individuals it is near impossible to get solid financial advice for cross border tax issues. MNP has been excellent with my business and multiple tax jurisdictions. If you don't know what you are doing you can get hosed. DM me and I would be happy to put you in contact with them. Cheers -FT"

Grant Thornton is the opposite, big in Eastern Canada through Ontario and really no presence in the west. If I was an American who wanted advice on both sides of the border I would use EY or Deloitte."
6391468,Fisherman Ted,2020-01-31 08:03:00,461,"Oh Dear God, this is ridiculous. But I have nothing better to do. MNP has a huge International Tax office in Toronto with like 350 staff and over 50 partners. Or Montreal with another 250..... The problem (as an individual) with going with one of the big 4 is you are going to pay huge fees and they typically are geared towards higher net worth individuals and businesses. Yes, any of those will help you at $400 an hour.......but doesn't sound like you need that. Heck I don't even need that and this is my livelihood."
