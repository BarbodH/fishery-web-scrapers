6390276,Bstar,2020-01-28 06:08:00,564,"Hi neighbor, It so happens that we will be there on a Thursday this year. Hope the wings are good!"
6390532,Bakefish,2020-01-28 17:42:00,1077,I lived in Hessville for 15 years. That was about 27 years ago. Certainly has changed.
6388200,Guest,2020-01-21 11:58:00,0,"I'm looking for a hotel in Fort Francis in late July. Group of 12+. We don't want to ""rough it"" Any suggestions?"
6388206,NARDA 1,2020-01-21 12:46:00,636,Copper River Inn http://www.copperriverinn.com/ or La Place Rendezvous http://rendezvoushotel.com/
6388208,prov1800,2020-01-21 12:55:00,5010,Could cross the birder and get that over with and then stay at the rendezvous hotel.nice place and good food and nice veiw of rainy lake.
6388220,Carnhzkr,2020-01-21 13:33:00,964,"Don't delay. Your post prompted me to call for my reservation. I typically book the Super 8 and when I tried I found they have only a few rooms with Kings and a pullout which doesn't work for my family of 4, so I booked next door at the Copper River Inn. I've stayed at both. Of the 2, I prefer Copper because they have a better breakfast, but I always try to book the Super 8 because they're about $40 cheaper for my group, and for $40 we can make due with the standard hotel breakfast of cereal, toast and Otis Spunkmeier Muffins. I believe the three nicest hotels in FF are the two I mentioned above and La Place Rendez-vous. I've never stayed at La Place because they don't have free breakfast and I'm a tight wad."
6388290,campchick,2020-01-21 18:05:00,96,Another place to check out is the Bayview Motel. People are saying it has been totally renovated. Their website doesn't mention a free breakfast but the rooms look nice. The website shows drone footage of their location. Just a thought. Www.bayviewmotel.ca
6388362,prov1900,2020-01-21 22:12:00,544,"AmericInn on the I-Falls side, if you can get in. Decent enough rooms, great pool, and outstanding prime rib sandwich. I would call ASAP though as they are typically booked on the ""typical"" border crossing weekends."
6388818,Mr. Sauger,2020-01-23 09:23:00,285,Another vote for Copper River Inn or La Place Rendezvous.They both have restaurants (and bars) on-premises that are convenient after that long drive. The last thing I want to do is get back in the tow vehicle for dinner. It is also a lot easier to coordinate with larger groups. Nice to hit the room one more time after breakfast before hitting the road.Copper River had a very good complimentary breakfast buffet - we can then skip lunch 'cause we're anxious to get to our lodge.
6388976,Aspencreek,2020-01-23 14:47:00,2911,"Again.........DO NOT WAIT, make your reservation as soon as possible, these places DO fill up. I make my reservation at the Super 8 when I check out the yr before. Also, If you are looking for a place to stay on a friday night and could get a reservation on the Ft Francis side so as to avoid crossing the border on Sat morning why wouldn't you?? I have always found it curious why guys would drive all the way to I Falls to stop short, just so they could enjoy the line on Sat morning?? Our group doesn't worry about that BTW, our camp is Fri to Fri."
6389060,Bakefish,2020-01-23 19:37:00,1077,Does the Rendezvous have decent and safe parking for towed boats?
6389614,Bstar,2020-01-26 05:57:00,564,"Plenty of safe parking at the Rendezvous. We've stayed there three times. The rooms are average but what we like is everything is right there after a long drive from Indiana. They have a great patio overlooking Rainy Lake where you can have a drink or two, a lounge and a restaurant. The service is awesome and the blueberry pancakes are the best around. We're booked there again for our trip in August. I wouldn't delay in making reservations."
