Maybe he does find time to fish but I think of the credibility of other interviewees in other segments. Granted this is entertainment and I do not believe it was totally in bad taste, it just points out a credibility problem.Since Ken is so visible at all the sports shows this cannot be a blessing for Ron. Good to see a plug for Ken tho, he has cleaned up the outpost very nicely and deerves some good press.TLY"

Lodge owners, guides, pros, manufacturers reps and so on.Is this Ken guy in trouble with the law or something? I am not familiar with him and why he would have no credibility.Sorry.Could you fill us in?"

Ken is also so visible at sport shows throughout the winter that I would imagine others saw this as well. Ron gave the outpost a deserved plug without again mentioning Ken's affiliation. No big deal, just kind of funny.The segment itself was right on. Only about 5.x months before can be there."

It's not fair to the other hard working resort owners. I don't blame Ken as he is going to take every advantage offered to him, that's business. But Ron should have picked the high road. Every time I see him on TV I think of this and it has taken the fun out of it."

Now I know that's not true, but someone who has never been there before would not. I wish the tv shows would be more honest."
