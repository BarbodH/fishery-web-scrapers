527669,McQ,2003-02-22 18:41:00,615,"Boy, I hate a post like this - now I have to change directions and drive to the north west. I have never fished this area but would sure like to help you out. Can probably get info for you, could you be a little more specific in what you are looking for and I will make enquiries on your behalf. I do know there are some great lodges in the areas you are considering.http://www.quebecfishingcamps.com/fishing.htmhttp://www.araymond.qc.ca/chalets.helen/c.helenA.htmlThis one is a broad listing of outfitters in that area of Quebec, check under the Temiscamingue section."

I am pasting a site that you can peruse at your leisure, just scroll down to Outfitters of Temiscaminque - most of them have detailed web sites. Enjoy and let me know how you make out.http://www.48nord.qc.ca/tableau_pourvoirie_an.phpMcQ"
