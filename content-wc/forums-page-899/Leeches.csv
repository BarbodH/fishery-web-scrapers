527758,happy,2003-02-17 09:24:00,34,Can anybody give a good approximate count of large leeches in a pound? Trying to figure out number of pounds to buy for trip in July.
527759,Bryan,2003-02-17 09:27:00,244,Seems to me about 8-10 dozen a pound for larges and 6-8 for jumbos.
527760,Mike KS,2003-02-17 12:37:00,18,Happy ....We buy two pounds for 6 guys one week and usally have some left over. Purchaseing a lb of Leechs and guessing how many there are is like balancing your wifes checkbook.....just keep putting more in the bucket. We always have a few twister tails and some crankbaits . If the fish are biteing good enough to eat two lbs of Leechs anything will work....Good Luck
527761,Dave,2003-02-21 14:17:00,258,Leeches are pretty reasonable so for a seven day fly-in we go with 1 lb./person.
