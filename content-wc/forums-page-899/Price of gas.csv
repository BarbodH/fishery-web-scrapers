527622,Tom,2003-02-13 07:36:00,1063,"As I recall, gas prices rose some 15-20% in reaction to the Gulf War more than a decade ago. Problem is, the oil companies saw a new price benchmark established, accepted and the price per litre NEVER CAME DOWN. Oh how we forget."
527623,Tom,2003-02-13 07:43:00,1063,"Oh yes, I forgot to mention that the gas prices may finally do me in as far as fishing expenses are concerned. I am getting to the point where I can no longer justify the 8-cylinder engine required to tow the 16 foot boat. Burning more than a mortgages worth of gasoline every month from May-Oct is ridiculous. I may scale down to a small 4 cyl. pickup and a 14 ft. boat. Fishing is what I do all summer but the cost of gas is making it tough on the finances. It's the new reality..."
527624,Thumper,2003-02-13 12:57:00,133,"Things are probably a bit different between Canada and the U.S., Tom. In Canada, as I recall, gas has always been expensive, and property has always been (relatively) inexpensive. I remember paying $.99 per liter in Vermillion Bay, Ontario year before last. I think that worked out to about $2.54 per gallon in U.S. currency. At that time, in Minnesota the gas was going for about $1.50.Right now, in Canada the cost of gas is about $2.17/gallon (US) while in the U.S. we're paying roughly $1.75 (US) or about 19% less.Why the discrepency between the U.S. and Canadian prices?BTW - in my neighborhood, the prices are ""down"" to $1.68It would take a realy big price increase for me to cancel my trip to Canada this spring, _but_ if gas prices were to stay extremely high, it would be included in my decision of subsequent trips.- Rick ""The Registered Thumper"" Torgerud ;)Owner of a V-10, so I'm interested in gas prices."
527625,Guest,2003-02-13 20:36:00,0,"Thumper, the price of regular gas in Vermilion Bay has never been .99 cents per litre. At present it is 76.9 and likely to go up to 84.9 by tomorrow.....that is the highest I have ever seen it. Maybe you were using premium?"
527626,joepa,2003-02-14 07:09:00,366,Just on the news: We are being gouged by the oil companies but mostly at the pumps! Every reason that was mentioned should only have mounted to a few cents. Isn't it wonderful!!!!!!!!
527628,Guest,2003-02-15 09:18:00,0,"81.5 cents per liter in Sudbury, Onatrio"
527627,Thumper,2003-02-15 15:12:00,133,"Hey, Sam. Yeah, really, .99/liter. Early June, 2001. My truck was very new, and it cost over $100 (can) to fill the tank!! It was just West of 105 on the South side of Hwy 17. I think it may have been a Husky, but it was very ""touristy"", not like a truck stop. - Rick"
527629,Big Tim,2003-02-22 08:12:00,63,"You Think A Gallon Of Gas Is Expensive? Makes one think, and puts things in perspective. Diet Snapple 16 oz $1.29 ......... $10.32 per gallon Lipton Ice Tea 16 oz $1.19 ....... $ 9.52 per gallon Gatorade 20 oz $1.59 ............. $10.17 per gallon Ocean Spray 16 oz $1.25 ......... $10.00 per gallon Brake Fluid 12 oz $3.15 ........... $33.60 per gallon Vick's Nyquil 6 oz $8.35 ......... $178.13 per gallon Pepto Bismol 4 oz $3.85 .......... $123.20 per gallon Whiteout 7 oz $1.39 ............... $25.42 per gallon Scope 1.5 oz $0.99 ................. $84.48 per gallon and this is the REAL KICKER...... Evian water 9 oz for $1.49 ........ $21.19 per gallon. $21.19 FOR WATER! ....and the buyers don't even know the source. Yes, and the name Evian, is Naive turned around, and the Canadians are selling it by the millions of gallons to the US. So, the next time you're at the pump, be glad your car doesn't run on water, Scope, or Whiteout, or God forbid, PEPTO BISMOL or NYQUIL!!!!"
527630,McQ,2003-02-22 08:35:00,615,"Taxes are the reason for the price discrepancy. 53% of the total in my area goes to either the feds or provincial authority. Compared to other destinations such as Europe, the UK, Japan, etc our countries still get a bargain rate.The comparison above attributes Evian water's source incorrectly - the water is an export of France - get your info straight and don't contribute to more confusion.http://www.evian.com/homeus.htmlSo if you want to boycott French products this one could be top of anyones list."
527612,Thumper,2003-02-12 05:12:00,133,Wow..The price of regular fuel here in NW Ontario is .86 lire. Thats about $3.50 Can per US gallon. Lets get this Iraq thing out of the way or I'll be in the poor house soon.

527614,Guest,2003-02-12 08:37:00,0,$1.79 here in minnesota thats a gallon of course! and only going up from here!!!!!

527616,Guest,2003-02-12 10:09:00,0,I live 1 hour outside Toronto and gas prices are at 81 cents per litre. That's about $2.00 US per gallon. Stop the madness!!

527619,Guest,2003-02-12 14:26:00,0,How high would gas have to get to keep you from going to Canada and having that time you wait for all winter. Our group drives a total of 2000 miles at 17 mpg or about 118 gallons of gas. Our group would not like it but we would pay $150 per man for gas.....150 x 6 = $900....$900 divided by 118 gal = $7.62 per gallon....yipee we are still going....how about you?

527620,Vitreum,2003-02-12 15:12:00,221,"keep your britches on boys. very, very soon this iraq problem is going to be solved and the iraqi people liberated. that should lead to a decade of $10-15 per barrel oil leading to $.95 per gallon gas. i was always told to watch the money. who stands to lose when we flood the market with all of that iraqi oil and stop the importing of chemicals for weapons of mass destruction? france, germany, venezuela, most arab nations, russia and yes, even canada. now, who are the nations raising the loudest fuss about what we are about to do? interesting, isn't it? the price spike is due mostly to war uncertainty and venezuela. add to that the coldest winter in 10 years in the northeast usa and oil supplies are really low. the saudis have promised to do their part and raise production. we shall see. the end is near. we're not sending all those guys over there to build sand castles. if bush doesn't go thru with it, i'll guarantee you that he will not be reelected."
527621,phidelt157,2003-02-13 05:23:00,191,I suggest we tap into the millions of barrels that we have on our own land (Alaska.) I'll cast the first stone if I can pay .75 a gallon for gas.
