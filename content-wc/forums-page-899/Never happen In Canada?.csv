And this 49,900-percent cost overrun was somehow kept secret from Parliament for years. Fact: With the passing of the New Year's Eve 2003 deadline for registering all firearms, perhaps as many as a million Canadian citizens went from being ordinary, decent, law-abiding men and women to being turned into criminals. Many in that instant-criminal class were already licensed gunowners. Fact: The provinces of Alberta and Manitoba will not prosecute individuals for failure to register their guns. But the Federal government has pledged to track down and prosecute those good citizens. Fact: Hundreds of thousands of firearm owner license holders who tried to register--under government cut-rate or free on-line offers to entice compliance--could not do so because government computers, telephone systems and bureaucrats were swamped into paralysis. If these license holders can now prove they tried to register, they have a six-month grace period to register their individual firearms, but will have to pay $25 per gun. Fact: As of the deadline for registration, 5 million firearms were added to the government registry--out of an estimated 16 million firearms in private hands. Under the law, those unregistered guns are contraband, subject to confiscation by police administering warrantless searches. Their peaceable owners are subject to $2,000 fines and six months in jail--per gun. Fact: Given this political nightmare, eight of the 10 Canadian provincial governments have demanded the whole program be suspended for further examination or scrapped altogether. Fact: With the support of many Liberal Party Members, Parliament has refused to ante up the $72 million demanded to run the failed program through March 31, 2003. Confronted with what may be the largest cost overrun in the history of any Western Democracy and a registration system fraught with a 90 percent error rate (according to the official audit), and a law-abiding citizenry and its provincial governments in quiet rebellion, the Liberal Federal government in Canada is, nonetheless, forging ahead. Martin Cauchon, the current Justice Minister, admitted, ""Yes there were some cost overruns ..."" but defiantly threatened, ""As far as I'm concerned, licensing and registration are here to stay ... . What we are doing here is that we are establishing in our Canadian Society a culture and values ... ."" When asked whether any crime has been prevented, he responded that it is ""hypothetical."" Though the Auditor General's Report focused on massive mismanagement and dishonesty with lawmakers, it said that the Department of Justice admitted ""the Program's focus had changed from high-risk firearm owners to excessive regulation and enforcement over all owners and their firearms ... as a result, the Program had become overly complex and very costly to deliver, and that it had become difficult for owners to comply ... ."" Most chillingly, the report concluded, ""The Canadian Justice Department said the excessive regulation had occurred because some of its Program partners believed that, the use of firearms is in itself a 'questionable activity' that required strong controls and there should be a zero-tolerance attitude toward non-compliance with the Firearms Act."" (Emphasis added) There it is. ""[T]he use of firearms is in itself a 'questionable activity.'"" For this belief, there is now a massive class of new criminals-ordinary people, good and peaceable people. Among them is Oscar Lacombe: Korean War veteran, former Sergeant-At-Arms of the Alberta Legislature and former bodyguard to Alberta's provincial premier. Lacombe--offering himself up for arrest for possessing an inoperable, unregistered .22 rifle--is willing to fight the law all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court. John Dixon, president of the British Columbia Civil Liberties #####'n, and advisor to the former deputy Minister of Justice, described these new criminals as people ""whose first reflex was to respect the laws of the land. This group's political alienation is a far greater loss ... The creation of this new criminal class--the ultimate triumph of negative political alchemy--may be the worst, and most enduring product of the gun registry culture war."" And this is a culture war. What has happened in Canada is proof positive that licensing and registration--in any guise--is an evil concept. We must never allow even a foothold in our nation. With this Congress and all the hype over ""ballistic fingerprinting""--read GUN OWNER REGISTRATION--we are looking at a future shown to us by the plight of our Canadian cousins, and our already disarmed friends in England and Australia. Our message to Congress should be: ""Never in America. Freedom First."""

The comments from the Government officials that won't pay for the over runs and will go ahead with the program no matter what should scare the He11 out of every gun owner in Canada. Who do you think is gonna pay for the program then? I'd bet it is the gun owners through a massive tax, just watch. If they continue on their merry littl way, you will go down like England. It is the same anti gun socialist mind set at work here. When the bottom drops out, come to America. We'll welcome you with open arms. And then take up the fight here and we can still hunt without being a criminal!"
