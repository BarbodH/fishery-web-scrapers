I can't wait to hook into one of those monster yoke lake Muskies. The cabins are in perfect condition and so is the lodge. The new owner has just ordered a new fleet of 17' lund outfitters so our group will be fishing in style. Great food, great service, great fishing, what more could a guy ask for.

527119,Guest,2003-02-05 19:18:00,0,"I haven't stayed at Happy Landing Lodge but have fished Yoke, Sucan and Straw lakes when a brother and I stayed at Slippery Winds over the same labor day weekend that Princes Diane died in the auto accident. The weather was nice but cold at night. Although fishing was slow, we had a great time and caught at least one of each specie available on those lakes. We also fished Sullivan and Bluffspoint. They are lovely lakes about 6 to 9 miles long. Our best fish was a lake trout that my brother caught on the last day before our plane left. He also caught a muskie and we caught northerns, walleyes, largemouth bass and smallmouth bass, problably a few perch. What I liked was the space to fish. The resort had boats and motors on all the lakes with short portages between. The food and evening visits with other guests and staff and the staff's pets make this one of my favorite trips-even tho the fishing was slow. I think Slippery Winds is under different management and the cost now is too much for my meagre pocketbook."
527108,Guest,2003-02-07 07:34:00,0,"Pipestone is very clear and walleye are best fished at night. I don't want to go to canada to fish at night, there are so many better choices available. I am sure the lodge is very nice, but I just want better day fishing, and am used to sleeping at night. It is kind of like fishing Whitefish Bay on the LOTW. Good luck."

This will be my third year owning this lodge and in two full summers not one of my guests has ever fished at night. We do all of our walleye fishing on three lakes named Straw, Sucan, and Yoke Lakes. They are located behind my lodge and take between 2 to 10 minutes to get to. The only way to fish these lakes is to stay at My lodge or at Slippery winds lodge, which is located on straw lake. We don't do any walleye fishing on pipestone. The only thing we use pipestone for is Smallmouth bass, Muskie, and Lake trout. We have 13 Brand New 17'4' Lund outfitters with 50hp.

I stayed a Happy Landing shortly after Matt took over. Had a group from Japan with me. We only had 2 days and not a lot of time to fish. The guides were fresh to the lake at the time but were still able to take us to some WALLEYE spots on Pipestone. We really got into some good Small Mouth and Northern Pike. If you look at there website http://www.happylandingfishing.com/photos.htm. The fifth picture of Matt and Seth with the 2 nice walleyes were caught not far from the resort the afternoon we arrived. I think that every resort owner or person has the right to respond to anything that is said about them. It your afraid of a response you shouldn't bother to post.

This was our sixth trip to canada over the last ten years and this was by far our best trip. We went in august last year and we caught lots of walleyes on the reefs, pike all over, bass on the rocky shorelines, and we even caught two muskies. Our guides were professional, very knowledgable with the water, always kept us on fish (my son in very immpatient, needs to be active), and cooked a great shorelunch.We stayed in cabin two, a very nice 4 person cabin with two seperate bedrooms and a shower and bathroom in each bedroom.The lodge was beautiful, the food was good, and the staff was great.

""RE: Happy Landing Lodge vs. Moose Point Lodge?""In response to message #6 I also stayed at Happy Landing Last year and we parked at Ross' and Ross' worked great for parking my car. Happy Landing is 28 miles and three lakes from Ross' so you are only fishing the same water if you travel that far everyday. Also Ross' is on Clearwater along with many many cottages and other resorts vs Happy Landing is remote with 12 other lakes that they can also fish, many of these lakes they are the only ones that can have a boat on that lake. The eating hours are more flexable at Happy Landing and as far as I am concerned the guides are way better also.muskies Guest User Apr-07-02, 12:43 PM (CST) 10.

I do venture down towards the other resorts once in a while, but usually I like to stay out of their way. There is fish all over on that lake and there is no sense on crowding someone else.

The food was wonderfull and I loved the home made bread! My buddies and myself took a guide with use when we were there and I must say it helped the fishing.

527117,Guest,2003-02-18 13:44:00,0,I have been fishing pipestone for year and never had any trouble catching fish dring the day. You don't catch a lot of fish but the quality is sure there. I have never stayed at Happy Landing but it sure sounds like a few people jump to some conclusions. I think you need to learn how to fish a clear lake because it is sure worth it.
527118,musky master,2003-02-18 15:00:00,2,"Harry makes a good point that needs to be posted on a few other discussions as well....clear water does not mean poor fishing. For the average angler not used to fishing clear water it may present a challenge. It does not necessarily mean that you have to fish at night. Clear water lakes in NW Ontario generally have species such as ciscoes which are a prime ingredient in maintaining populations of LARGE fish. Shallow, stained waters can be easier to fish under most conditions but tend to not have the forage base to produce many trophies. Large,complex lakes with clear water can be dynamite fisheries for walleye.....others that are simply a deep bowl with little complexity may be great for lake trout but have a poor walleye population. If fishing was as simple as looking for either clear water or stained water it would not be half the fun it is!"

I hate it when lodge owners or any other owners spam and I certainly won't do it. This venture I have is to help fisherman with honest opinions based on mine and others experience and to help fishermen being mis-lead by lodge owners who tell them what they want to hear in order to get bookings. since I have been assured by the web master on this board that he did not give you any information about me (and I belive him), I was wondering how you found out so much about me considering I posted as guest user with my middle name?

How dare you insult and attack somebody perosnally for posting thier opinion. If you did that to everyone on this board then who would want to post opinions to help anybody? It's one thing to disagree with somebody but it's horrible when you attack personally. You don't know me as person and thank god you never will. I wish you the best as i will not post on this topic again."

I don't mind the fact that there is a road, I mind the fact that the guy didn't have the integrety to acknowledge it. It falls under the truth in advertising issue. If you can't believe one thing, can you believe any????? From my perspective, I had flag go up when you have a lodge on one lake and they fish three others instead. Not for me."
527132,Guest,2003-02-21 16:23:00,0,"Carol, Actually very few lakes in the area south of Dryden, east of L.O.T.W.'s, west of Atikokan, and north of Fort Frances, are remote in your terms. Roads, cabins, lodges, camps, and progress have been happening for a long time around here. Tourists have learned that locals can and do fish these waters also. It's too bad you feel disapointed to see us(locals) on the same lake (Straw and Sucan) as you, but this is not going to change.If any lodge owner in this area tell you otherwise (private), then they are selling you something that doesn't or should exist. Common sense should prevail here. A true remote fly in does exist, but that is quite a bit north of here. Where there are virtually no people and no roads, there is also the feeling of privacy. It simply does not exist where most of the residents in the area live. Please do not feel disapointed to see us fishing our waters, and we will not feel the same about you.Local yocal,"

They have some remote fly-ins but remember that some of these my have other outpost camps on the same lake. Be sure to ask and I think you will get a honest answer.Fitch"
527138,Fitch,2003-02-21 20:18:00,75,"This will be my third year owning this lodge and in two full summers not one of my guests has ever fished at night. We do all of our walleye fishing on three lakes named Straw, Sucan, and Yoke Lakes. They are located behind my lodge and take between 2 to 10 minutes to get to. The only way to fish these lakes is to stay at My lodge or at Slippery winds lodge, which is located on straw lake. Matt Koerbitz Happy Landing Lodge local yocal Guest User Feb-18-03, 08:14 AM (CST) 17. ""RE: EYES WIDE OPEN - HOW DID YOU MISS HAPPY'S BANNER?"" In response to message #15 Straw and Sucan lakes can be accessed from a public road called ""Cedar Narrows Road"". Backed my boat in many times. I hate it when lodge owners say they have the only access around (private). I am calling big Baloney on this on. This area is not remote. Carol Guest User Feb-18-03, 12:20 PM (CST) 23. ""RE: EYES WIDE OPEN - HOW DID YOU MISS HAPPY'S BANNER?"" In response to message #17 The truth always works out better and that is completely obvious here. I would have to say that I would be unhappy to be told I am on a remote lake and see boats from Fort Frances fishing on the lake. Not that far away. A little disappointed I am not sure Carol but I didn't see any thing on his website saying that Pipestone is a remote lake. Did Matt say this? Maybe some of the other guests that actually stayed there since Matt took over could post there honest experiences and let us know if they would return to Happy Landing Lodge Fitch >Sounds pretty remote to me huh fitch. this is not mis-leading in any way now is it. You can post anything you want on this site but it seems that you are attacking people for stating thier opinions and facts. By the way, nice smart ##### post about keeping secrets. Yes i have a small side hobby/business that I PURPOSELY won't mention on this board because that would be spamming and i repsect this board and the fellow fisherman on it to do that. I hate it when lodge owners or any other owners spam and I certainly won't do it. This venture I have is to help fisherman with honest opinions based on mine and others experience and to help fishermen being mis-lead by lodge owners who tell them what they want to hear in order to get bookings. since I have been assured by the web master on this board that he did not give you any information about me (and I belive him), I was wondering how you found out so much about me considering I posted as guest user with my middle name?

527134,Guest,2003-02-22 10:39:00,0,"I don't give a hoot if you are on the lake, I just don't like the guy who owns the place saying the only way to get there was to go through his place. So take it easy."
527135,Guest,2003-02-22 10:43:00,0,"I don't care if you are on the lake, I might come over and ask you for some fishing help. But I don't like the lodge owner telling us that it is a remote lake when there is a road to it."
527136,Guest,2003-02-23 06:54:00,0,"He never said Remote, and he never said he had the ONLY place on the lake system. And once again, if a guy was gonna drive 1500 miles to go fish there and he used the road access, where is he gonna stay? You are hiding an isue here maybe? Got an axe to grind?"
527137,Guest,2003-02-21 19:22:00,0,"Where did he say his lake was remote? He said the only way to fish these lakes was to stay at his lodge or the other lodge there. He not only described his Lodge, he named the other, gave em a free plug. But you idiots are taking this way too seriously! If a guy was to drive up from America and bring his boat, and use the road ramp you are mentioning, where are they to stay? Campground etc? The FACTis there are only 2 resorts there, so the statement the only way to fish was only misleading if the intent was to say the only way to fish also meant vacation at stay at in the whole context of finding a lodge on the lake. You people are way too tightly wound and need a drink!"
527111,Guest,2003-02-17 11:30:00,0,"To Tyler:The reason there are so many posts over the last two years is because, I tell many of my guests to post their experiences on walleye central. Why can't I tell my guests to post their trip experiences? The purpose of this board is for people to post their summer fishing trip experiences, am I correct. This is why so many post are similar. We treat every guest the same and give the same great quality trip to every guest old or new. And just to let you know I am the ONLY Canadian fishing resort that pays for advertising in this section. ($3,000 a year) In your spare time go back and look how many other resorts make their own posting without even spending a dime on this site."
527112,Guest,2003-02-17 12:23:00,0,"Matt,I agree with you that lodges spam their info. on this and other sites and I think it stinks. But if you were somenone who comes to this board once a day for the last three years and you read all of those similiar posts wouldn't you think something was fishy? Perhaps your guests and employees can register so we could e-mail them for their personel references. One other question, if you have 91% re-book rates why spend $3000.00 to advertise and do all of those sport shows at 2k US per pop to fill 8% vacancy. That 8% certainly is not enough revenue to cover your advertising/travel budget. But it's your money who the ##### am I to say. On my ""spare time"" I reasearch and look into other fishing lodges that don't have such a harsh attitude towards people even though they don't put the mint on the pillow. Anyways good luck in 2003 and maybe i will see you at one of those sport shows that your ""guests"" keep inviting me to."
527113,Guest,2003-02-17 12:44:00,0,"Tyler,If you do so much research you wouldn't put a stupid post of the 8%. I can tell that you have no experience understanding what an occupancy rate is. DO SOME MORE RESEARCH AND GET A LIFE OR AT LEAST A BETTER HOBBY"
527124,Guest,2003-02-17 13:20:00,0,"Matt,i am in the same situation as i cannot register with the board. However, I am not saying anything bad about anybody who posted honestly. just some of the posts are very similiar in writing style. thats all."
527125,Guest,2003-02-17 16:36:00,0,"Sounds like those hot walleye lakes need to be tested out in the hard water format......digging out my map and loading up the auger! Hey Tyler why not join me and we can find out if those ""guests"" were telling the truth or not! A well known fact....fishermen can never keep a secret.....:)"
527115,Fitch,2003-02-17 21:56:00,75,"Tyler:Looks like you have a lot of free time on your hands and could do a good job being an internet sales person. Perhaps you could cut a deal with Matt and make some money on the internet getting bookings for "" THE LODGE"". Just a suggestion. P.S. ( You would be supperized what you can catch throught the ice in the _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ chain of lakes. Notice I can keep a secret.Have a good one and bring a fast snowmobile with you.Fitch"

527127,Guest,2003-02-18 07:59:00,0,"Hey yocal, how was the fishing in those two pot-holes? Have you ever ice-fished them?"
527114,Guest,2003-02-18 08:01:00,0,"Bill,Remember that I did not post anything about the lodge after my intial post. As a matter of fact i never said anything bad about that lodge, the owner, or the fishing. Actually i said in one of my posts that I was confident that the accomdations and fishing were very good. The reason for the orginal post was because the verbage was very similar to every other post about the lodge I have read over the last three years on this board and I got curious. I only replied back to Matt who decided to slam me for expressing my original opinion. I would have never said another thing about the subject. Shame on me for backing up myself with facts after being provoked and possibly helping somebody else. After all this board is for promotion of products and services right?.... Wrong!!! It's a sad day on this board when somebody trys to help and gets attacked. Matt decided to accuse me of speaking out of turn for no reason and I thought I had to waste my time with an explantion. Besides, what else is there to do when you have a blizzard outside and 30 inches of snow on the ground. But thanks for being concerned about my spare time it sure beats shoveling. Good fishing."
527116,Guest,2003-02-18 08:55:00,0,"Sounds like you got caught Matt. Not only do you have a banner, but you make bogus posts to boot. Shame. And your lakes are not only accessible by you and Slippery Winds but by road as well. My goodness. Kind of stretch things a bit. I did not bash your lake, just said that Pipestone was a clearwater lake that was tough to fish during the day for walleye, if that's bashing, you are awlful thin skinned. One thing you never want to do on this site is get into a peeing contest. Cause you don't look near as appealing as before you got all hot and bothered."
527123,Guest,2003-02-17 11:08:00,0,"Tyler, I can not register because I have a hotmail e-mail acct. but that being said I was just pointing out that Matt does pay to advertise on this board, yes I do know Matt but no I have never been to his lodge.Matt Thompson"
