527897,Guest,2003-02-21 12:56:00,0,Vitreum.....The Pickrel Rig Im looking for is solid wire and weighted at the bottom with two hooks attached directly on it. I fished with them years ago in Manitoba but cant find anybody who sells or makes them.
527898,Vitreum,2003-02-21 13:11:00,221,"oops. sorry, thought you were talking about walleye spinner rigs. kinda sounds like an erie dearie, but they only have one hook. maybe someone else can help you. lots of experienced oldtimers here on this board."

527899,Peanut,2003-02-21 13:17:00,929,"Kevin, try www.thefishinhole.com. They have them under the ""Components"" section of their catalogue, which you can view online. You can also shop online if you wish. They were listed at $.69 each.derrek.""It's the weaseling out of things that sets us apart from the animals.... Except the weasel."" - H.J. Simpson"
