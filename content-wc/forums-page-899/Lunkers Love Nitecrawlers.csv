Any one think they're worth posting on the swap Board? They're all just sitting in boxes with pictures of my old row boat. Thanks.Atomic Eye (New Mexico) -- ""Gone Fission!"" ~~~<}}}:>"

527820,IaDave,2003-02-19 08:54:00,476,I have been reading this book and I can't beleive how much I have learned. What is even better the book was published in the mid 60's and it is still revelant today. It has a lot of ideas that I have never used and I am looking forward to trying them this spring. It is from a series of books or magazines called strictly fishing or simply fishing something to that effect. Has anybody read these books or magazines and know where I might get more? They are great for the beginner or a serious fisherman.
527821,Guest,2003-02-19 09:17:00,0,"It was from the original Fishing Facts magazine which was one of the best around in the old days, not the advertising hungry magazine of today. I read it back then and used the methods very successfully on the Woods. Loved the poor man's Lindy Rig. I would use a lot of their ideas but think in terms of bottom bouncing which has taken over for Lindy Rigging. You go forward instead of backwards, and move quicker. A much better and quicker search tool. However once fish are located one could backtroll with good success and use the Lindy Rig. You do gut hook a lot of fish as they tend to inhale the crawler and you do let them have line. The parts about the various structure were right on for the most part and formed the basis for my walleye structure which I use to this day. It's a great book."
527822,IaDave,2003-02-19 10:07:00,476,Thanks Phil- What I like about the book is the simplicity of the fishing at that time. None of the hi-tech ideas you see today. I guess I must be at that age around 50 where you want simple over tech.I'm just getting the part on the structure. You got to love the illustrations. Any idea where you might get the old issues. Probably the library.
527823,SetTheHook,2003-02-19 11:35:00,89,I found this book in a clearance of used books. Bought it for 10 cents about a year ago. Thoroughly enjoyed it. I may have to go back and read it again.
527824,Guest,2003-02-19 12:21:00,0,"The old great issues of Fishing Facts were in the 60's, 70's, and 80's. I don't know where you would find anything that old. Maybe on Ebay as some collector might have them. I remember back then, it was read that book or Buck Perry whom I couldn't understand at all. This book made the difference between me catching fish and not catching fish. It was the beginning of my guiding career on the Lake of the Woods. I had an Green Box Lowrance and was the only one fishing the humps other than Virgil Ward when he came up. Nobody else could find them cause they didn't have depthfinders. At least not the deeper humps. Boy that was some great fishing and great memories. The only drawback to the system was that when you would put the rig down the walking weight would get hung up a lot, sometimes on the drop. But now, with all the advancements there are better ways to skin a cat. But his principles on location and behavior are pretty much right on."

527826,Guest,2003-02-19 13:35:00,0,"I bought the original ""Lunkers Love Nightcrawlers"" book back in thelate 60's I believe. It was not as thick, but still covered a lot.Not sure if I still have it somewhere. I also think the author wasBill Winkelman, whom most of you may never have heard of. If he wasn't the main author, he was a big contributor to the beginningsof Fishing Facts."
527829,Mike KS,2003-02-19 13:36:00,18,I used to fish with crawlers a lot. I havent used them for several years now because of to many deep mouth and throat hook sets and fish bleeding. We fish Lac Seul now and are lucky enough to be able to catch and release all day with jigs until the last 15 minutes of the day if we need something to eat....if we used crawlers the mortality rate would be unacceptable.
527827,Guest,2003-02-19 17:53:00,0,"Sounds close, but I ...think... it was Bill Binkleman...But,I could be wrong. I used to get the ""Fishing Facts"" magazine. I read the book. The magazine used to have a lot of articles about structure, spoon plugging, slip sinkers. All kinds of ""cutting edge"" (for its' time) thinking.Wow! I had not thought of that magazine for years."
