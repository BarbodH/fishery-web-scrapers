Boat A goes to leave and total nutjob in boat B fires a shot?!?!?!?! I tell you what, if I was in Boat A I would soon own everything the gunman in boat B owned as the civil suits would be HUGE and well publicized. I would not rest til that Jackwipe wass living in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere. The gun man needs some serious jail time, counciling and he needs to surrender all his belongings to the guys in boat A."
