However, I'm not sure my wife will be up for the idea of community bathrooms, and dodging the bears to go to the bathroom at night. This is one of the places I'm thinking about taking my wife in mid July. We certainly aren't looking for luxury accomodations, but I don't want to go too rough. Has anyone stayed here? What are the accomodations like? Any input you have is appreciated. Bill"

527057,Guest,2003-01-30 10:44:00,0,"Witch Bay has spearate bathrooms and showers, which doesn't really bother me during the day, but at night . . . I went out one night to go to the bathroom, and nearly ran face first into a bear. They are all over up there, and are running through camp pretty regularly at night.As for that part of the lake. I really like it. You are definitely far enough away from Kenora that the boat traffic is minimal. Frequently the only other boats we saw were from Witch Bay. The only other resorts I have found in the area are Pipestone Point Lodge and Sunsuri. I also like it because it is not the clear water like Whitefish Bay, and isn't big water, so its always possible to get out. The other thing I like about that area of the lake is it is an untapped muskie resource. I like to spend some time fishing muskies, too, and almost no one else is there muskie hunting. The are lots of muskies in the area, and they really aren't getting any pressure. This makes it quite different from the Northwest Angle and Sabaskong Bay part of the lake (at least, that's what I hear)."
527058,Guest,2003-01-30 11:13:00,0,"From the map it looks like a great area to fish....lots of islands and bays. I agree with you on the muskie fishing. Sabaskong and the Angle seem to get a lot of attention, but there are muskie in alot of the other areas on the island side of the lake. For the first 12 years I stayed at a camp with central bathrooms and showers and it was fine. Then I found an island camp with full baths in the cabins and now I'd never go back. I bring my wife with me and she really appreciates it, besides the bears there's the privacy issue. Good luck on your search. We're also going to be up in July, but we stay in the Miles Bay area."

In the sping you don't even have to leave sight of the lodge and you got a chance at a real big walleye. Major bass spawning happens with 1.5 miles of camp. The bathrooms are not a problem and at night just go off your porch, nobody walks to the bathroom anyhow after dark. Or use a bucket. Not a legitimate problem and kind of overblown. That is why the grass is all brown around the porches of the cabins. Fishing is no better anywhere in Ontario then this area of the Woods."
