Carolina and sold under the Lomec brand?The 800 phone number is no good and neither is the old website, www.fishinsticks.com. I have a couple of their spinning rods and am looking to buy another if they are still in business. Any contact info would be appreciated."

I had heard that he moved his operation to Arkansas, then sold it and bought it back again. Just rumors from old customers though."
