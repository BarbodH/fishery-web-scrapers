527724,Guest,2003-02-17 08:43:00,0,"They work great with live bait rigs; I tie them in tandem about 4"" appart and hook a big minnow in upper lip and just ahead of tail. Then use a colored bead just ahead of minnow's nose. Work them with minimal weight about 30-36"" ahead of bait; when you get a pickup, just raise rod tip and crank; DON""T set hook as you will pull bait from the walleye's mouth. The curve of the hook lets the fish set the hook but itsself, usually very nicely in the corner, I use a #1/0 or 2/0 because the gap is different then a std hook. The circle hooks are some of the easiest to remove that I've ever seen and the guys I've introduced them to are really impressed too."
527725,Guest,2003-02-17 09:14:00,0,Is the colored bead just before the hook that you hook into the minnow's nose or is in on the hook itself?
527726,Guest,2003-02-17 21:53:00,0,Have started fising cicle hooks exclusively for our spinning rolling rigs at Lac Seul. They work exceptinally well. Dont miss many and the hook always ends up in the corner of the mouth for easy unhooking.
527727,Guest,2003-02-21 08:37:00,0,"They're great for spinner rigs, especially if there are pike where you're fishing. They get hooked in the corner of the mouth and you don't lose your rig. I've tried several styles, but I've had the best success with Eagle Claw L787 style."

527729,Backwater Eddy,2003-02-21 11:37:00,3871,"The Gamakatsu colored circle hooks made for walleye work great on many vertical presentations. Glow green, red, and blue work well for me. You can see them at this site if you wish.www.gamakatsu.comA key element is a longer slower action rod. This prevents tearing the hook free, and allows for a solid hook-up in the corner of the walleye's mouth.It is extremely rare to see a fish ""gut-Hooked"" on a circle hook. Barbs are not really necessary either, I pinch them back.They are a great deep water option while ice-fishing spooky perch and walleye, fish them on a float or rigged on a dead-stick. ;)Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson..><sUMo>"
