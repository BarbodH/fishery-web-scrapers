527845,Vitreum,2003-02-22 17:02:00,221,"tech, i'm assuming that you use the original. from the tests i've read, the plus is not nearly as good. seems that in an effort to make the line thinner, they lost a lot of the abrasion resistance."

527847,lobo1,2003-02-24 13:40:00,734,You may find yourself sacrificing casting distance in a comparison to some of the thinner lines. I feel that the original is indestructable but I can't cast it nearly as far. This is very durable line but at the same time is thick and somewhat more visible (to my eyes) than anything else I have spooled up. I like it and feel the durability and brute strength of the line outweigh the casting distance issue - I am keeping it spooled on my nicest muskie rig.lobo
