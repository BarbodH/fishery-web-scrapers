527790,alan ex pup,2003-02-20 22:58:00,126,Well i will tell you this. I would not meeting you in 6 years or so as a cottage owner in canada. 4 months renting up there would be a lot less than the taxes and the troubles I would hope.
527791,David/MN,2003-02-21 08:23:00,249,"I use mine 12 months out of the year, Nothing better than winter and ice fishing in Canada! The beauty and quite is AMAZING!!dw"
527792,wiggle,2003-02-21 09:24:00,400,"I bought a cottage near Sioux Narrows, Ontario. I started out dealing with Norhtwoods Realty. He would not show me any cottages that were not listed by him. I had to go to another realtor from Kenora to take at a look at the cabin that I eventually purchased. Why he didn't show it to me, I don't know!!! I was riding in his car with him one day and went right past the cabin and he would not stop in. Seems like a nice guy, he just wanted to sell me a cottage that he had listed I guess. Brad"
527793,alan ex pup,2003-02-21 10:41:00,126,Hi. I always reread my post to make sure its right but i really messed up #10. what I meant was that I would not mind meeting you in 6 years as a cottage owner on LOTW. That the taxes and trouble would be a lot less than what it would cost to rent a cabin for the summer from a lodge. I will have to look at those other realy web sites also. Thanks. alan
527794,Fitch,2003-02-22 21:49:00,75,I purchased a cabin on Rainy Lake last Oct. Been wanting to do it for years. Lake property has be going up appoximately 10% per year for he past 7 years. U.S. exchange rate has dropped 7 % in the past 2 weeks. You may find yourself paying double the price in U.S. $$ in 6 years and wishing you had of bought now. There is no more land availible in Canada than what's out there today. You may want to double think the wait. The other thing is to buy a property of lower value now and up grade in 6 years. This property will go up in value the same as the new one you purchase.Good luckFitch.
527795,Trailerguy,2003-02-23 13:04:00,1407,"Fitch is right about property values, I bought 3 years ago and have seen 25% increase near Lac Suel. Taxes and hydro are really affordable when you are using USD, the exchange rate varies throughout the year."
527796,Fitch,2003-02-23 19:04:00,75,">[email protected] I know a guy who just bought a resort who is going to sell his Island on Lake of the Woods on the south end by Morson for about $ 100,000 U.S.. If you want I can have him contact you. He is going to sell it with out a realtor.Fitch"
527780,Guest,2003-02-17 19:36:00,0,"We are looking at buying a cabin on the Canadian side of the border. I have several questions that I am looking for some help on.1. living in states what kind of taxes will we be charged on the purchase price of the cabin?2. Any advise on electricity what size and type of generator?3. We will probably tear down this cabin in a couple of years to rebuild, what can you take accross the border? lumber, appliances, etc and is there duty? If there is duty would I be money ahead to buy material up in Canada?4. Looking at a cabin in the Minaki area, a boat in cabin, any comments on the area?Thanks for any help or comments, my email address is [email protected]"
527781,Fitch,2003-02-17 21:41:00,75,You will only have to pay the normal taxes due on the cabin. Generally it is very cheap. Supplies from the U.S. mostly will just be 15% tax. Recommend checking prices in Canada as you will find many things are much cheaper there. Check in the Fort Frances area as they to get more expensive as you go north. Here is a good site to check out listing. www.norealtyfee.com They only charge $ 150 for listings till they sell. May other realty site in the area. Be sure you have no charges against you that will prevent you from coming to Canada. Check with the customs at Fort Frances. Have a good time. Canada is a great place to own property.
527782,Wawajake,2003-02-18 13:12:00,413,"Can't advise you on the taxes , mine is on leased land in a different part of province and I AM CDN. (bought camp from a yankee though) I will suggest that you buy a generator that gives you 240 volt and 120 volt that way if you end up putting a service panel in your camp you just hook generator up to the bus bars thru main switch and bingo whole system is at 120 volt.I would suggest a minimum 4500 watt output , so that it can handle a toaster or electric fry pan at same time as lights. I myself looked at yamaha and honda but they were twice the price of Canadian Tire generators, but just avoid tecumseh motors on generators , mine has a Fuji (Subaru) gas motor and has good reputation , I figure I can wear out two generators and pay the same as a Honda. But I might be wrong , three years so far and no problems and a theft of it would not be as bad a hit on the wallet!Figure on 750 to $800 CDN for decent generator on sale with 4500 watt 240 volt , Hondas are almost $2000 CDN For same model. (15% sales taxes to be added to these prices. ) I live on a border town with US and smart Americans buy their lumber on CDN side. Besides you also have advantage of exchanging stuff you don't use at local lumber yard closest to your cabin. However you might not have the selection you want so bring across those hard to find items and buy the basics in Canada.Jake"
527783,Hunter,2003-02-18 18:22:00,346,"If your purchasing a piece of land,, consider having your lumber cut from your property. There are lots of small saw mills all over the country,, just ask around for one in the nearest town to your property. If you have enough property it is possible to make a trade with the mill owner and you can get your lumber cut for just some extra logs!"
527784,David/MN,2003-02-18 20:29:00,249,"BKT,In 2000 I purchased a cottage (that's what there called in Canada)on Rainy Lake. Here are a few random thoughts.1. You do not pay any special taxes on a cottage. There use to be a special tax for non residents but that was repealed a few years ago.2. You will find the real estate purchase to be very much the same as in the States, but after you get an accepted offer the lawyers take it from there.3. The seller is called a vendor4. I pay three taxes a year, Provincial land tax, School board tax, road tax. All reasonable.5. You only have to pay duties on a few items. Color TV's Carpet, Copper pipe and fittings are the biggest. Other than that not much.6. Yes you can bring lumber, but no plants.7. I have brought things from the Cities, bought in International Falls, and spend as much as I can in Fort Frances. Buying local the right thing to do!8. Being from the US anything you bring to leave at the cottage you will need to pay the local tax only (GST 7% not the PST 8%).9. You will be considered a seasonal resident, and as such you can import on a one time basis your household goods for the cottage with no taxes. You will need to make a list of everything you want to bring on your one time deal, but you can space out the time that you bring it. You must have owned it before you bring it in, and can't sell it for two years.10. Generator is a good idea! I have a large cottage and went for a 7500 watt continuous unit so I could run the boiler and the lake pump.Let me know if you are looking for more specific information. Being in Canada is a privilege that brings great rewards for someone who loves the lakes and the bush!!!!!!dw"
527785,alan ex pup,2003-02-19 00:35:00,126,"thanks david MN. I have been thinking of the same thing. been going to canada for 30 years and would not mind spending 4 months of the year in a ""cottage"" on LOTW. been looking at the website for the guy at siox narrows. Lots of nice places for sale, but I dont need one for another 6 years. I wish I could justify it now but I cant. thanks any one else out there with suggestions? Thanks Alan"
527786,Guest,2003-02-19 07:46:00,0,"ex pup,would you mind sharing the web address for the realtor that you are using?we have been hashing the purchase over for a couple of years and if i get it together maybe i can get the boss lady to give her approval..we haven't looked for anything yet,so i don't really know where to start.we have always kinda thought about the dryden,antitoken (sp) areas,but like i said we're unsure and just now wanting to get started.thanks in advance..."

527788,alan ex pup,2003-02-19 11:00:00,126,Hi. I like to look at www.northwoodsrealtyltd.com this for property around sioux narrows on LOTW. It looks like he has listing that go to Morson and kenora too. Alan His office is right by the market in town but we are just looking yet.
