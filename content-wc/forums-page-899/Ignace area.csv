527885,Guest,2003-02-21 08:36:00,0,Try the trip finder feature at http://www.justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htmfor finding a lodge to go to in northwestern Ontario. I used it and got over 70 respones and found just what I was looking for last year's trip. I am going back to the same place. There are some great places in that area. Thumbs up and good luck. That site only deals with northwestern Ontario and they seem to have a handle on things.
