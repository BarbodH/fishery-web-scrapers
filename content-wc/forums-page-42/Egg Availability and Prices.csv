6662352,dschiebel,2022-06-07 02:45:00,85,"So went across at Fort Francis on a late Sunday night. He asked if we had any potatoes, chicken, or bait of any kind. We said no, They searched us anyway. he pulled out a bag and said these are potatoes, I said No those are yams, He said these don't come from a hog. I said Yams, not hams, He says up here in the Northland we know the difference between a hog and a potato. He was becoming irate. He then asked whats in the cooler, Paul said beer, he stated how much beer Paul stated 50 dozen. He yanks the top of the cooler open and there is 50 dozen spot tailed shiners. I was shocked. The agent said you Americans are going any where for a while. I felt like I was in the twilight zone. The agent walked to the trunk and said whats in the trunk, Paul said justba bunch or rolls, Agent said open it, the trunk opened and there were 2 very large kinda looking females almost naked getting out of the the truck. The agent then started yelling at on of the things that looked female and a noise was coming from her bottom. The agent said what you have in there honey and you guessed it she had 3 live chickens. At this point I actually went # 2 in my pants and felt lite headed. More agents showed up and One of the female looking things yelled he has eggs in his keister. I new I was drinking on the was up but I thought I could not have been that drunk that they could get a dozen eggs up my keister . Well about that time someone yelled really load everybody up 15 minutes to the border check to make sure everything is in order. I realized I was having a night mare and did not go # 2 in my pants and could feel any eggs down there. I did tell them to open the trunk, no giirls in there. We passed through with flying colors then Paul started making chicken clucks, I new we were starting Canada Fishing 2022."

6661910,SweetD,2022-06-05 16:42:00,243,Any problems finding eggs for those that have already traveled North this Spring? What are prices per dozen on avg?
6661912,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 17:02:00,3685,I'm sure the chickens in Ont are working 24-7.
6661940,Yellowfin123,2022-06-05 18:21:00,2182,"corn feed prices are thru the roof up north and all the coops are flooded, the chickens are pissed off, just figure a buck an egg"
6661942,Clairebear,2022-06-05 18:23:00,937,Here in Southern Ontario I pay $3 per tray (1 1/2 doz) right from the farm.
6661944,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 18:24:00,3685,"Just hope you get a few double yokes in the 12 pack.Yea being a chicken in Ont is hel on earth,laying eggs with rubber boots on gotta be a pain."
6662020,v-bay gord,2022-06-06 06:05:00,3168,I will only buy eggs from chickens that respect me and don't hold me in contempt.
6662036,Huntindave,2022-06-06 07:11:00,2194,"Don't eat many eggs eh? (it's a joke, picked the low hanging fruit)"
6662044,Walleye2242,2022-06-06 07:23:00,263,I will just try to answer the actual question: like 3.60 canadian for a dozen eggs right now. Plenty of eggs.

6662258,3M TA3,2022-06-06 18:15:00,2846,We like scrambled eggs so bringing from home works for us.
