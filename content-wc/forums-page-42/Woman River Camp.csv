Never fished this particular system but trying it out this year.Anyone have any pointers on where to start? We will be mainly jigging for eyes, probably spend some time chasing pike and maybe even a little small mouth.As usual not looking for any of your honey holes but any recommendations you can provide would be appreciated.Thanks,"

Big woman is usually good for walleye. Find out the depths that work and go to those depths There is good structure everywhere. Early in the year, like now, the first narrows is a great spot Good Luck! Hooks"
