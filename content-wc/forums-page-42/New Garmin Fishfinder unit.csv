6661352,NWBearcatgrad,2022-06-03 13:22:00,36,Needing help.......I own an older Garmin echoMAP 54 and just purchased a echoMAP UHD 73sv model. Can my data and/or map on the older unit be transferred or shared on the new unit. Trying to avoid paying for the chip. Cheapskate Any help would be appreciated. TIA.
