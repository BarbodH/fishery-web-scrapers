6662220,wallypod,2022-06-06 16:04:00,21,"Never seen water like this and hope to never see it again. Fished a new fly-in lake w/o May21, got flooded out of planned lake. Water looked about 2 to 3 feet high (not bad) temps were 40 first day. Found a north bay with pike stacked up, 3 over 40"" 25 over 30"" and guess 100 more smaller, all in 5 feet or less. Believe they scattered by end of the week as water reached 55F. Walleye were where you would expect leeward side of reef like structure near 10 foot holes. But they were most aggressive at 2' to 4', go figure! I think dragging them up from the nearby deeper holes, must be where the food was?. Great fishing! Eggs, milk and all!"
6662368,Skywagon,2022-06-07 04:59:00,1106,"Friends have a cache boat there, but I have not fished it in open water for a while. I do know cabins have changed hands there. This is tough year for everyone."
6662370,Eckohlt,2022-06-07 05:09:00,3685,Thanks sky!
6662764,NM_Trout,2022-06-08 07:57:00,1094,"I've got some friends in camp now, and their outfitter passed a message on to me. The water is well up above normal stage. Clarity is unchanged (tannin) and they are having no trouble finding lots and lots of fish in the usual spots. All good news."
6661536,lassh,2022-06-04 08:47:00,553,This message goes out to all of you who have experienced high water at fly-in lakes. This includes those of you returning from the first couple weeks of the season. Did you find fish in new areas? Did the usual techniques work? How was weed growth impacted? Did the depths you found fish change? Were there issues with docking? Did you find issues with formerly visible rocks lurking under the surface now? Any surprises?
6661542,NM_Trout,2022-06-04 09:22:00,1094,"Very timely. I'm following this closely. I found out that the lake I am headed to shortly is completely blown up with high water. Water is up about 18"", the dock is under. I'm disappointed that my outfitter didn't share this with me; I found out from someone who returned from the lake. No one in my party has mobility issues, but if we had... having the dock under water would have been a really big deal. I have a bunch of favorite spots on the lake, and I think that the water level is less likely to affect the fishing rather than the clarity and chemistry. I dunno. I guess I will know firsthand coming up shortly. Any info I can gather prior to the trip will be helpful."
6661580,Eckohlt,2022-06-04 11:37:00,3685,"High water is costing me more money,I have to put more line on the reel."
6661844,Mr. Sauger,2022-06-05 14:08:00,285,I figgur you should be able to catch more fish on a fly-in because ... Since the water is higher it takes the float plane less time to descend and land on it - thus providing more fishing time.
6661852,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 14:28:00,3685,"The docks are under water,it takes more time for the pilot to locate the dock!"
6661866,prov1800,2022-06-05 14:51:00,5010,The high water both at drive inns and the outposts is no joke.Going to cost lots before its said and done.Many docks totalled or gone.Boats and motors gone.Generators flooded.Cabins flooded.its basically a disaster.They are all trying there best to move people in for there holidays and work on getting others ready.
6661874,Eckohlt,2022-06-05 15:34:00,3685,"So anything new being built on a lake up there they have to maybe reconsider on where to build,by what could happen anytime down the road."
6661890,prov1800,2022-06-05 15:56:00,5010,Definatly in the plan.
6662014,Skywagon,2022-06-06 05:29:00,1106,"This was one of those perfect storm occurrences that you hear about, a combination of thick ice, huge amounts of snow from the winter melting, topped off with large quantities of rainfall all at the same time. I built my cabin 4' higher than there was any indication that water had ever been in history and yet water still went under the cabin, unlikely to ever happen again in my lifetime, but you never know."
6662026,Eckohlt,2022-06-06 06:32:00,3685,"South cabin on wapesi lake got flooded,so the outfitter lee bought another cabin on wapesi lake about in the middle of the lake,we are staying in that one,sky you might know something about that cabin,I think lee bought it from a private owner?"
