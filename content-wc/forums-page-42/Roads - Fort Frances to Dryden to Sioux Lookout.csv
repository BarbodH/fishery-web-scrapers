6662690,David Anderson,2022-06-07 21:53:00,2073,I thought they were pretty good a couple of weeks ago.

I was at Sioux Lookout a week ago, only water issue was at the bypass around town by Dick and Nellies, had to go through town and hit the highway on the north end of the railroad overpass if you are going that way, the water may be down enough to use the bypass now."

One spot early on into 502 from Fort Francis had a little water on the edge of the road, the rest of the way was smooth sailing. Lots of sand bagging in Fort Francis and Sioux Lookout, but it didn't interfere with us passing through."
