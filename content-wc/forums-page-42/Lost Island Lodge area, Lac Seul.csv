I've heard nothing but great things about Lost Island Lodge and read everything on here. The new owners have been great communicating and seem like top notch owners. We are very excited for our trip July 3rd - 8th. Anyone have any tips, ideas or suggestions for us? We would like to get onto some bigger Walleye and don't mind travelling up the lake. Any recent information would help.Thanks to everyone."
