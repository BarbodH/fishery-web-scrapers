6662240,prov1800,2022-06-06 16:56:00,5010,Drove up to Clarks this afternoon to pick up some minnows for our fishing day on Eagle tomorrow.Was shocked to see how much the water receded at camp.Can actually walk on the road in front of the cabins.slowly returning to normal.Anyone needing minnows or leeches tgey have lots and get bagged with oxygen.Weather also looking much better.
6662242,Eckohlt,2022-06-06 17:16:00,3685,That net with the minnows would last me about hour n half.

6662314,Golden Eagle,2022-06-06 20:38:00,2642,I've spent a lot of time cleaning my truck after traveling the 105 detour May 18 & May 28. It's also been through 2 commercial washes. It's fine now except for the tires. Any suggestions for sprucing up the tires? I'm concerned about what certain chemicals will do to the wheels.
6662318,Yellowfin123,2022-06-06 20:55:00,2182,"there's alot of tire dressings out there now days to get the mud color out, the ol armorall days are gone, don't wanna hurt the pimp wheels with the 22's"
6662324,prov1800,2022-06-06 21:07:00,5010,Been going through the detour a few dozen times and don't notice anything wrong with my tires.Everything nice and clean now that I go through water.hardly ever wash my truck and when I do it rains so not taking any chances.
