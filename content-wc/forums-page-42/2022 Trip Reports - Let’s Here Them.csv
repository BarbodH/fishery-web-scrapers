Strong northwest wind with snow,sleet and rain. We went south to Muskeg Bay and caught some small noirtherns and one 30 inch pike. Water temps were 42 44 degrees. The following day we went east to Spring Bay and trolled for pike using husky jerks. We caught one at 38 inches and 4 at 26-67 inches along with smaller ones. Water temps were 45 degrees. Next day we went to Osbourne Bay and jigged for walleyes. Water temps were 52-54 degrees. We caught 28 walleyes in a little over an hour. 1/4 ounce jigs tipped with minnows. 6 in the slot ,3 at 18 and lots between 16 and 17. The following days we fished Camp 6, Lost Bay and Midway Bay. 1/4 ounce jigs with minnow. Biggest walleye was 281/2 inch and a 26 inch fish along with other walleyes and a few pike. Water temps were 54-56 degrees. Next day we fished Eldorado Bay casting for pike. We casted husky jerks and caught about 38 pike with 11 of them over 30 inches with 39 being the biggest. The last day we fished the humps in open water. We caught smallmouth, pike and walleyes. 16 to 24 feet with jig and minnow. Water temps were 56 degrees. I have been fishing Eagle since 1982 and have never seen the water this high. There is going to be a lot of damage to lower units for people who don't know the lake."

But due to road washouts and severe flooding in that area (and expected increased flooding per Mike at the camp), we deferred that visit to 2023. And, already in Canada, called an audible to go to Donnelly's on the Pickerel Arm of Minnitaki Lake. Darrell saved our 2022 trip! Cannot give him enough credit for that, as he wasn't truly open yet, and he had almost no help in camp. But he graciously hosted us and took good care of us.Minnitaki was up at least 6-8' and is (I think) still rising. I've been there in the past when it was 4' up. This was definitely higher and made the fishing harder. Water temps started on 5/21 just around 41 or so, and by end of the week, were closer to 47-49. We caught plenty of fish during the week, but the fishing was different and required exploration. Many of the usual spots that held fish were not really the same with the high water - plus it was pretty early in the season. For example, Redpine bay, a typical treasure trove of fish catching, was much more difficult to find fish in. Landmarks were largely underwater, and/or hard to recognize. But we did manage to find a number of spots east of the Pickerel Arm toward Windy Jim's and the vicinity to catch fish. A couple were very productive. We had lots of fish from 20 up to 27. Most were overs in the 21-22 range. Also quite a few slots. Finding eaters was actually a bit challenging. But we definitely didn't go hungry. It was so great to be back in Canada, and as I said before - kudos to Darrell at Donnelly's for saving our trip!Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

6662130,SweetD,2022-06-06 11:28:00,243,Look forward to hearing about your trip report St Joe guy as I’m assuming you are headed to Lake St Joseph???!!!!!!
6662236,Invader21,2022-06-06 16:42:00,105,Yes and also watch for rocks! I dragged my skeg on a rock at low speed I should have known better was there. But it was underwater. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6662316,Golden Eagle,2022-06-06 20:49:00,2642,"If I posted about how good fishing was on Little Vermilion Lake, I would not be believed. Ask Whopper. A hint: Walleyes hit on just about every drop of a jig. No meat. No stink. Just a jig & grub. Huge pikes were eating Johnson Silver Minnows and Suicks all week long. Same successful fishing for the guys who replaced us in camp at the end of our 9 day stay."
6662360,Whopper,2022-06-07 04:35:00,340,"Yep the catching was off the charts, almost made up for the two year hiatus. It was great to spend another trip with the cabin two crew. The clinic my son put on with a Suick was priceless. My hands have still not healed up.Thanks Connie for letting us be a part of it."
