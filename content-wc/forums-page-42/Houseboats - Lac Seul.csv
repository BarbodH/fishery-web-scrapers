6662028,Lmbkiller,2022-06-06 06:47:00,639,"Not like the water is high on lac seul, simply higher than in a normal spring. It's at mid summer pool currently. There's plenty of beach in mid summer, so there will be now. Get a bunch of rain next few weeks that could certainly change the game but for now plenty of beach"
6662032,prov1800,2022-06-06 06:53:00,5010,Was on Lac Suel on west side on Saturday and there are zero beaches.The places they would park the houseboats would have to be tied up in the woods.It will recede very slowly but long way to go.
6662268,pjshorthorn,2022-06-06 18:40:00,5654,If you are taking a HB trip soon ..what area are you thinking about and when. I can probably make some suggestions depending on where you might be going. Going on my trip July 9th and know exactly about where I want to be regardless of water levels. PjShorthorn
