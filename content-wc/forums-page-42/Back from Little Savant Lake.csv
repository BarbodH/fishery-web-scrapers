Like everyday this spring, weather was windy wet and cool for the first 2.5 days and finally had a beautiful day Saturday. First time on the lake. Fishing was weird. We would fins a spot and catch 6-10 fish in no time and think we had them figured out and then not another bite. We caught right close to 450 fish for the 4 of us. With the weather and a new lake, not a bad amount, but definitely have caught more other places. The thing I will say is the quality was the best I have seen. Every walleye was 16""-21"" with and occasional 22"" and 23"". Maybe 6 fish under 16"" the whole trip. We probably caught 60% on a jig and slip bobber and the rest jigging. The cabin was great, motors worked flawlessly, using hardly any gas. I am thinking the group that flew in for this week will hit some unbelievable fishing as things warm up just a bit. Great to be back in Canada. Sad to see the flooding on the way up in Fort Francis and Sioux Lookout. The motel in Sioux Lookout with the airplane in front has at least 4 feet of water on the main level. Hopefully the weather will hit a dry pattern and levels will slowly recede."
