6661646,Prop Chopper,2022-06-04 16:55:00,18,I'll give it a spin!
6661664,walleyecheek,2022-06-04 18:01:00,2231,"Yeah , you do that !"
6661950,Prop Chopper,2022-06-05 18:57:00,18,I'll get right on it!
6662042,prov1800,2022-06-06 07:19:00,5010,Gord where are you getting your minnows.iam headed up to the minnow capital on Cedar Lake today to get some for my fishing day tomorrow on Eagle.
6662046,v-bay gord,2022-06-06 07:49:00,3168,"I get them locally at a store we all know. It doesn't matter the source though.....back when your supplier had an outlet in Eagle River the sizes were just as inconsistent. I get it, a lot depends on the trapping conditions. Feel free to drop off some of those free minnows you're always talking about and I will do minnow review on them for WC."
6662054,prov1800,2022-06-06 08:09:00,5010,"Iam just a lucky guy I guess.I get to play in any of the minnow tanks.Like a kid in a candy store.I like the medium tank best.A 2 -3""minnow is best right now on a 1/16 oz jig.I leave the large alone till it's time to hump fish.Ill definatly bring some for my guide day next week at your place.Used some 1 1/2"" minnows on Lac Suel on weekend and they work just fine on a 1/16 oz jig."
6661306,v-bay gord,2022-06-03 09:50:00,3168,A good post on Eagle Lake....what's working and locations. I will say we've had the opposite results trolling crank baits....it's been very successful for our guests. I would say the majority of our fish have been caught using them. Different anglers and preferences I suppose. Fishing has definately been good and getting better.....
6661366,Prop Chopper,2022-06-03 15:09:00,18,I like Wally divers myself. They wouldn't have worked well in Bottle Bay given the weed growth but definitely easier on the minnow budget....and what's with the minnow distributors around Eagle lake? 1.5 inch minnows that look like they went on a food strike.
6661368,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 15:17:00,3685,Times are tough even for a minnow.
6661374,walleyecheek,2022-06-03 15:22:00,2231,I think the minnows are spawned out !....LOL
6661382,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 15:45:00,3685,Lol how many eggs in a minnow??
6661444,Prop Chopper,2022-06-03 21:03:00,18,Are you the board's resident dumbass?No offense intended.
6661456,Eckohlt,2022-06-04 02:50:00,3685,Nothing wrong with alittle humor on here.
6661500,v-bay gord,2022-06-04 06:22:00,3168,The bait business is one of the few where the quality of the product fluctuates wildly but the price remains the same. I find it painful to charge someone $6 Cdn / dozen for a size of minnow you could floss your teeth with...
6661550,walleyecheek,2022-06-04 09:28:00,2231,"Hey Eck , I wonder if Prop chop has ever listened to the song by Hank Jr. ""Mind your own business"" ? If not he should !!!......No offense intended !"
6661578,Eckohlt,2022-06-04 11:35:00,3685,"You might want to mention to him,that's there is a song out there he needs to hear!"
6661026,Prop Chopper,2022-06-02 06:01:00,18,"Water temps currently ranging from 53 in larger bays to 61 in protected areas. Wind has exceeded 30 mph gusts and has caused damage to local docks on a couple days. There's a cooling trend occuring as of this post.Fishing has been incredible.Walleye - 16 to 22 inches pretty common along windswept rocks. They appear to be actively feeding with 2 hour frenzy's followed by 2 hour pauses in action in 6 -12 feet of water. Trolling Lindy rigs less effective. 55 degree areas minimum needed for action. Some small males still milting. Orange and chartreuse jigs as well as blue trigger most strikes. Crankbaits all but worthless. Dark, warm and still bodies of water not as productive thus far. They do not appear to have moved deeper yet.Smallmouth- They are hitting Lindy rigs or jigs cast close to shore when fishing for Walleye. They don't seem to have staged on rock shelves yet but starting to. We have caught them in odd areas/atypical spots.Northern - Active. Very active. All depths but none exceeding 27 inches thus far. We aren't targeting them however. Young fish extremely battle scarred at times.Musky - not targeting them but 4-5 smaller ones have been caught in smallmouth areas. Perch - periodic and unintentional jumbo perch have been caught jigging for walleyeWater level - seems 3-4 feet higher. Be ready to adapt. Previous go-to areas will need to be jigged or trolled a little closer to shore to stay at 5-12 feet. We didn't run into a lot of debris..Best fishing I've seen in 20 years.Good luck."
6661058,rockape,2022-06-02 07:11:00,215,I'm up there in 2 weeks. What areas of the lake did you fish?
6661068,10point,2022-06-02 08:01:00,102,Good to hear. Going up to Eagle Lake for the first time ever on Saturday. Will be at Vermillion Bay Lodge.
6661128,Prop Chopper,2022-06-02 13:40:00,18,"Areas fished were Bottle Bay, Bottle Bay lake, Railroad bay, Canoe Narrows, West arm."
6661132,10point,2022-06-02 14:02:00,102,Did you use minnows for the walleye?
6661138,prov1800,2022-06-02 14:43:00,5010,I'll be fishing some of those spots soon.Have a couple of guide days on Eagle out of vermilion bay.
6661152,reddemon2,2022-06-02 16:29:00,255,Best lodge on Eagle
6661200,Prop Chopper,2022-06-02 21:08:00,18,"We used minnows tipped to 1/4 oz jigs or Lindy rigs. Windswept rock walls with cobble or sparse weed bottoms were the most productive. It was **** on my boat buddy when he drove but that's were they were. NO hits on crankbaits. Zippo. Gulp bait did work when we ran out of minnows. It got so intense trying to conserve minnows, we'd have a walleye hanging in the air while we'd use the fish net to save the minnow the walleye threw when we brought him to the boat."
6661202,Prop Chopper,2022-06-02 21:23:00,18,Bottle Bay Lake - south rock wall and north wall in the channel before you get to largest part of the lake. -not the part of the lake you enter after going through the stream. Railroad- the rock shelves that run north and south on the west section trolling.Bottle Bay - trolling weedless rigs along the bank before going into the stream that goes into BB lake - bottle bay itself is still pretty weedy but much deeper now. Canoe Narrows - the tall rock wall past the island. 6-11 ft of water. Trolled jigs there.
6661218,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 03:31:00,3685,Did you cut out the gullet n try that??
