6662386,eyeman_1,2022-06-07 06:39:00,690,"What was the water level like? We are headed to Wiley in three weeks so just checking on what we might expect for levels and dockage. From what I've been able to hunt down, levels are slowly falling? Thanks for any info."
6662390,Iceshack05,2022-06-07 06:47:00,31,Water levels are pretty much at an all time high...and I have been told they are going to rise before they start to recede.
6662392,MN Brandon,2022-06-07 06:48:00,14,Water levels are crazy high still. It has came up around 3” over the last 5 days and I believe they are expecting it to go up another 2-4” this week. If we don’t get any rain it should start to level off soon. My docks are 18” or so under water….. I assume Wiley has some floating docks so that should be fine.
6660956,Catch&Release,2022-06-01 17:09:00,6,Oh yea Left them for ya.
6660968,Eckohlt,2022-06-01 17:54:00,3685,"You left them for someone else which is good,I'm not a Lake of the woods guy."
6660970,Catch&Release,2022-06-01 17:56:00,6,"Figure with enough of us taking Walleyes out.. LOTW, even though much bigger and will take longer, will end up like a Mille Lacs one day."
6660974,Eckohlt,2022-06-01 18:33:00,3685,Hope they don't end up in a gill net.
6661124,MN Brandon,2022-06-02 12:53:00,14,I’m up near crow rock channel and the water is 52…. Super windy but fishing has been great!
6661142,Obabikon,2022-06-02 14:48:00,2370,The morson area is still running very cold for this time of year. I assume that's true for everywhere. Temps are ranging from 53-58 depending on wind and location.
6661166,mrpike24,2022-06-02 17:11:00,54,Thanks for all the responses. Very excited to be back in a couple weeks!
6661238,Bill Krejca,2022-06-03 05:03:00,6107,"An uncontrollable factor, limits on other fishing means are more or less able to be managed. Bill"
6661274,Eckohlt,2022-06-03 08:40:00,3685,"Your right,it's hard to teach a fish about gill nets,a boat net,just need to force'm in it."
6662200,mrpike24,2022-06-06 15:07:00,54,Have the bugs been much worse this year with the higher water? I saw jay Siemens post a video on his Instagram which looked like a solid sheet of mosquitos off his dock at night a few days ago!
6660784,mrpike24,2022-06-01 08:35:00,54,Heading up to the Kenora area in a couple weeks and was curious on the current water temp in the area? Any fishing reports are always appreciated as well!
6660794,MN_Moose,2022-06-01 08:57:00,964,I've been curious as well. The weather buoy isn't operational yet. https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_pa...?station=45148
6660800,Hook_settr,2022-06-01 09:01:00,127,I’m heading up this Saturday so I’m interested in the latest intel also. I have been using this as a water temp source since the weather buoy hasn’t been operational but I’m unsure of it’s accuracy.https://seatemperature.info/morson-w...mperature.html
6660812,patricktjms,2022-06-01 09:13:00,67,Watching also...headed up in 3 weeks.
6660860,txk4,2022-06-01 11:26:00,31,"For what it is worth. We returned home last Friday from a 2 week trip to the NWA. Arrived the Sunday of the Minnesota opener. The ice had basically gone out the Monday before. The water temps were around 42 degrees except it was colder out in the bigger basin by Little Oak for example. There it was 37. When Canada opened we found 44-46 in most areas and by the time we left there were some spots that had reached 52. Fishing was good, getting better each day. Water temps will not be your problem, the high water will be more of a challenge. Lots of docks were lost the last few days due to the high water and wind conditions. Hope you guys all have great trips. T"
6660862,Iceshack05,2022-06-01 11:30:00,31,I had water temps ranging from 40F (Clearwater Bay) up to 54F in some other area's. That was on May 28.
6660868,Hook_settr,2022-06-01 11:52:00,127,Thanks for the info. I just saw on Facebook that Flag Island Resort is suspending operations due to the high water/dock damage. Said they will reevaluate on 6/5. Poor resort owners can’t catch a break.
6660890,Bill Krejca,2022-06-01 13:20:00,6107,"Generally, the north - Kenora area, Whitefish, etc., is cooler than the Morson area, just two completely different water systems, north averaging much deeper. Bill"
6660944,Catch&Release,2022-06-01 16:31:00,6,"Returned from Morson area 5.30. Water temp 52-55 most days. When wind died and sun was out, popped all the way up to 60. Fishing open areas around islands. Also, water is up about 3-4 feet."
6660954,Eckohlt,2022-06-01 17:05:00,3685,Did you release any??
