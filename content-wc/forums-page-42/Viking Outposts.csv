6662350,english bob,2022-06-07 02:43:00,14,Can anyone tell me about the ownership of Viking Outposts in Red Lake? Their website advises 'coming soon' with little other detail. There is a Black Moose Outposts logo on the website and I see from Facebook photos that their yellow Beaver also has Black Moose on it. I went to several different Viking outpost lakes over many years when the Carlson's were owners
