After going at least a couple times in May, June, July and Sep I'm partial to mid June. Not too cool, not too hot, and usually the weather is pretty stable."
6662872,winger,2022-06-08 12:26:00,8,"I went for a dozen years opening week to Eagle and surrounding portage lakes.. Easy to catch big pike, great shallow walleye bite, lake trout are shallow and no bugs. I still think that's the best time to go. Had a couple trips in June also but didn't match up in terms of size. Resort owner told me August is a nice time to go and fishing is very consistent and predictable. Taking family members this year who do not like the cold though and trying LOTW this year when its a bit warmer in 2nd half of June."
6662790,Jwendt15,2022-06-08 09:10:00,72,"We went out to Lac Seul the last week of May and weather was rough to say the least. We've been up there five times now around that time of year and have likely been lucky with the weather in the past. If anything, this was more of a typical weather pattern that we experienced. I talked to the lodge owners and they both agreed they'd come around the first three weeks in August if they had the choice. I also have three young kids that I am going to start bringing up within the next few years. Trying to be patient with that as they aren't quite ready, but this past week would have been a disaster for them at this age. Of course there's never a guarantee with the weather, but you can certainly play the odds. Curious as to what everyone's preferred time of year is for their trip. Thanks ahead for sharing."

6662818,eyecatcher1,2022-06-08 10:20:00,323,"I've been going to Lac Seul for 30 years from opening day until mid October last year. Our opening day group quit after 5 straight years of wind and snow on opening day. Weather can be a challenge that early. I agree with Walleye 2242 that the cooler air and no bugs later in the season is a bonus. The fishing always seems to be great, it's just different spots at different times of the year. I was there last August and again in October and the fish were in the same places because it had been so warm up there last year. That's the first time that ever happened though."
6662826,guidedfishing,2022-06-08 10:33:00,531,"Younger years I used to do Opener, weather was always hit or miss. I have long since stopped playing weather roulette. Not saying you can't have bad weather at any time, but at least the probability decreases. I have found I typically aim for the last 3 weeks of June, and then anytime end of July through the first couple weeks of September. Honestly My favorite time is around the 1st week of August."
6662828,Old Timer,2022-06-08 10:34:00,255,"Hi Jwen. I've been fishing Northern Ontario for more than sixty years. My preference for a spring trip in the Red Lake vicinity is sometime around June 20th/21st. The weather is stabilizing and you capture the longest day of the year. It seems the fish are still in their easy to catch spring pattern. Over the last 20 years I sense this sweet spot can be extended to very early July. Is it due to climate change patterns? I dunno. For LOTW, I like to go earlier, like the first week of June, so I can avoid the mid-month mayfly hatch. August is wonderful mainly because of the warm, stable weather. And for me, stable weather patterns have more to do with good fishing than lure color, live bait choice or whatever. However, for me, the August fish seem to be a bit more finicky and my catch rate is generally slower than what it is in June. You might wish for air conditioning on some August trips. The above said, the second to third week of September is still my favorite. I enjoy the colors, lack of other fishermen, easy reservations, no bugs and usually great fishing. But the weather can throw you a curveball. I've seen the best and the worst of it."
6662830,Eckohlt,2022-06-08 10:37:00,3685,"Not the first 2 weeks,anytime after until freeze up."
6662836,Riding high,2022-06-08 10:46:00,69,I like may for myself. I take my wife from mid July to mid August. Last year went mid September. Se like the sun and warmth. I like the cooler days. Mid July to mid August would be best for the kids.
6662838,Baseline,2022-06-08 11:07:00,3207,"If your plan is to bring kids then return to school figures into the equation. Although I quit Lac Suel about 20 years ago I always liked mid August. Mid August had more consistent and nice weather, bugs weren't much of an issue and the fish were always biting. The water was always warm enough for a mid-day swim during our lunch breaks. Some of our late May and early June trips had us sitting in the cabin or fishing close to the resort because of some major storms that would blow though. Cold temps, wind and rain isn't the type of weather kids like to cope with. It's hard enough for adults."
6662854,SweetD,2022-06-08 11:45:00,243,If you look at avg high temps in mid-July they are in or around 78/79 degrees (Sioux Lookout area). We are headed there 7/15-7/23. Been heading North for over 30 years and have generally aligned to an “earlier is better” approach. While we have always had pretty good success the weather is much more volatile that early part of the year. We fished early Sep last year and had a tremendous trip. Zero bugs and fish stacked in holes. Looking forward to fishing mid-Summer as we never have before! I think we have always just assumed it is blazing hot in July/Aug like it is here in the Midwest when in reality avgs don’t necessarily align. It’s hard to wait until mid-Summer for our tripas it is contrary to what we have done in the past but really looking forward to fishing this period.
