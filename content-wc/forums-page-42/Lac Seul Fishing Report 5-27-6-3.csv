Would've had to take that very slow if you were trailing a boat. They did a good job of scraping the road and it was just fine the way back. First three days were incredible for fishing. I have always been skeptical of how much difference the color of the jigs make, but pink and orange seemed to produce the most over the week. We headed out to Broad Lake every day we were able to, the week was all about finding warmer water. Started the week by fishing a little further out around 6-8 feet but continued to move in closer to shore where we were getting the bites. In the end, most walleye came in 3-5 feet of water. Big fish of the week at 26"" bit about five feet off shore. Sunday ended up being the banner night for the week. Not necessarily for pure numbers, but I don't think any of us have caught more 22""+ walleye in a single outing. There was a time when between the three of us, we had a 22, 24, and 25 inch walleye in the boat at the same time. Just incredible for size all weekend. Weather really turned on us later in the week. Cold, rainy and extremely windy. Had one of the rougher rides out to broad I had ever experienced. Another day it just wasn't worth the trip with the wind and sideways rain so we fished closer to camp. Nothing but pike that day. On the last day we made it out to Broad again but had a high of 45 degrees. The cold front definitely had an impact and fishing was slower all around. Unfortunately for the owners, camp was not even half full but the others seemed to struggle outside of Broad or McKenzie Bay. With the weather they did not want to make the longer boat trips and had a hard time fishing closer to camp. In previous years, we've had great fishing closer to camp near the Bay of Islands, but not this year. Warm and shallow was the theme of the week. Zero action on crankbaits from walleye as well. Jighead/minnow seemed to be the only answer for us. It's never a bad trip up to Lac Seul, but one of the slower weeks of fishing we've had. Much of that was due to the brutal weather at times though. It's a different topic so I'll post a new thread, but we are considering a trip later in the season next time as we know this type of weather is typical around the time we go. Best of luck to everyone else heading up this year!"

We found about 4 different logs that would have been well out of the water last year that were just under the surface. They were also well within our ""safe path"" so we took it slow the first few times and noted where those spots were. Always had to be on the look out for debris as well. You could be out in some big water and a full-sized tree would just be floating along. The debris was more of a concern than anything else."
