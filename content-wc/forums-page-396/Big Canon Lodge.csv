Because of the simularity in names and location of the two .But, they are 2 different bodies of water .. With different species of fish in each .."
1519829,stillangling,2013-01-04 18:24:00,149,http://www.canmaps.com/topo/buy-topo...50k/052k04.htm The above link gives you the map series (Federal) that identifies the lake as Big Canyon. I realize that some map series call the lake Big Canon...guess it is a matter of personal history. Sorry for highjacking the post on the lake name. I am certainly not the right person to give advice on the lodge itself but just find the idea of going to a fly-in and then having to work to get to a waterbody that you can can drive to a little unusual.
1519869,NWwalleye,2013-01-04 20:42:00,223,"You can't drive to Big Canon ( Canyon ) Lake Lodge .... And there are plenty of other portage lakes to fish, as well as the river system .. Most people that go there, rate the whole over all experience,.. Such as, lodging, boats, meals, hospitality, fishing, etc ..."
1521041,GeoFish,2013-01-08 10:39:00,70,"We have stayed at Big Canon Lake Lodge numerous times when Bill Frederick and Steve Guse owned the camp.We also visited once when the camp was run by Sam Guse. They are great people, the camp is very well run and they are extremely helpful.We have caught some Musky in Francile. I understand that there are Musky in the main lake.We mostly fish for Walleye and have fished the Wabigoon River downstream from Clay Lake many times.Since we mostly Walleye fish we quit going after we heard about the mercury spill.Have a good time, but I won't eat any fish caught from the Wabigoon River."

1515723,elkman99,2012-12-21 15:20:00,180,"Thanks WD, I did a search prior to my post and didn't see much. I was thinking that this could be a diamond in the rough for musky. Big trout water usually produces large ski's."
1515864,lassh,2012-12-22 07:01:00,553,"I was at Big Canon Lake one time in the 80's. Jim Booi had a camp on the lake. He was building a log cabin when we were there. He keeps a very sharp axe and could fillet fish faster with his axe that we could with knives. We weren't musky fishermen at the time. I only musky fished Big Canon seriously one afternoon, didn't get any. We did catch multiple muskies on the little no-name portage lakes down at the end of the lake, I think it was the southwest end. We didn't get any big ones but there are definitely numbers of muskies in those small portage lakes. Small mouth fishing was good in the rocky areas and lake trout fishing was good even though we weren't experienced summer lake trout fishermen. They took us in wagons and four wheelers down to Segise Lake/Wabigoon River. We got some nice pike in Wabigoon and walleyes were in Segise. There was one current area (narrows) that held walleyes, but every day an armada of boats from somewhere on Wabigoon would travel straight to that spot and troll back and forth. You could hear the boats coming in the distance for a long time before they got there. We would usually leave after they got there because I didn't go on a fly-in to community fish a small area. I also remember we caught a number of very large rock bass. If I remember right, there were some private cabins on the lake, one of them was Walter Mondale's. I hope this provides some insights. It was a long time ago. There was a large variety of fishing at Big Canon. Its fun to reflect back on previous trips. Thanks for providing the spark to relive the experience."
1515900,Limeyangler,2012-12-22 08:58:00,563,"my buddy is a guide at Big Canon...he also says there is awesome musky fishing to be had in the portaqge lakes...walleye is top class and lakers too. He is born and bred NW Ontarian and rates the fishing very, very highly....and he's not trying to sell me anything."
1515917,packpro,2012-12-22 10:52:00,695,"PM sent. All good. Most of the past posts are right on target. Our group has made 12 trips there over the past 15 years. All very postive experiences, with something for everyone in our group."
1515959,Tx Jig tyr,2012-12-22 15:53:00,140,"Elkman99, we have fished Big Canon several times since 2001. Good camp operators, top equipment, (no problems with motors, or leaky boats) they help put you on fish. The portage lakes may have #'s but we saw 30# musky taken from Big Canon. Good cabins, food, etc. We can't go back every year, but sure wish we could. Best way I can say it is: ""as advertised"" is what we found. Good luck."
1516583,NWwalleye,2012-12-25 01:57:00,223,"I have been a frequent guide on Big Canon @ Big Canon Lake Lodge. I started guiding out there, when Bill Fredricks and Steve Guse owned the place . I would say that was about 18-20 years ago. I still go there for about 1 or 2 guide weeks a year. Sam and his mother Sue Guse own and operated the lodge now.The lake trout and small mouth bass fishing on Big Canon is outstanding!! With a mix of some trophy walleyes being the normal the last 10 years or so . There are some trophy Northerns that cruise the waters and YES the ocassional Musky . But, if you are going to target Musky at Big canon, you will need to fish the portage lakes, no name and little no name or even Francil all hold Musky . With the two no name lakes having good numbers, but tend to be on the smaller scale . Francil produces a large Musky on occassion ( but is a catch/release lake ), it also has a good numbe of big small mouth bass.Here is the website for Big Canon Lake Lodge, Check it out .http://www.bigcanon.com/If you are interested , use me as a reference ... Tell them , "" Ken "" pointed you in this direction .."
1519324,NWwalleye,2013-01-03 13:19:00,223,"There seems to confusion as what lakes are catch and release .. As I stated above... Francil is catch and release, which is enforced by the lodge .Big Canon and all other lakes fished from Big Canon Lake Lodge ( http://www.bigcanon.com/ ) are regulated by the MNR laws .."
1519414,stillangling,2013-01-03 17:17:00,149,The locals call the lake Big Canyon. I think that the Gazetter name (Big Canon) is probably a mistake but that is another story. The lake gets a reasonable amount of fishing pressure from locals in the winter who target lake trout. It is a strange situation. The lodge is fly-in during the open water season but they are sending their clients into the Wabigoon River that certainly isn't fly-in. The armada of boats that one of the earlier poster was referring to are coming primarily from Clay Lake (North Star Lodge - drive to). A little bit of boat traffic also comes from people who launch off the Segise Road.
