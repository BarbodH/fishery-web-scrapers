1520387,NMG,2013-01-06 16:21:00,1053,"Hi folks,I'm looking to plan a 3-4 day getaway this summer and I'd like to visit either Georgian Bay or Lake Nippising, just not sure which one!I'd like to get into Pike, Musky, Walleye and Bass and I have a 16 foot Alumacraft Competitor tiller with a Yamaha 70. It's obviously not a a wave crasher, but I'm comfortable in it's abilities when using common sense. I would also be looking for a resort with a marina. It would be my wife, my small son and I on the trip.Can any of you provide some thoughts on these two options? Is one better than the other? Does one have a much greater chance of foul weather? From what I can gather, both have some sheltered spots, but I'm not sure if you need to access large expanses of open water to find them.I'm in Ottawa so they are both about the same distance for me to travel to, although I do appreciate that Georgian Bay is obviously much larger so the options would also be more extensive. I'm guessing I'd be looking at somewhere around Parry Sound, but that's just a blind guess from looking at the map.Any advice or thoughts you'd be willing to share would be GREATLY appreciated.Thanks!"

Nice place, they have cabins for rent, or you can camp with your own equipment. They also have docks that are protected with a breakwall, I don't think they have a full marina with gas (have not been there in a few years). I do remember they have a nice beach for the kids and to just sit around. The fishing was o.k, not what I am used too but over all a nice place, Nippising can get rough in a hurry so watch the weather. I have not been to Georgain Bay to fish so I cannot give any advice.Fisherman 1792"

1520537,zeebee,2013-01-07 06:41:00,1144,I would opt for Bay of Quinte over the other two......good family vacation spot and has the bass/walleye/pike combo amongst other. Likely a closer drive for you too.
1520589,reelobsession,2013-01-07 10:25:00,40,You may want to look at the lower French River. They have everything (fish) you are looking for plus some beautiful locations. Look at Atwood Island Lodge to stay. You launch at the marina and it is a 10 minute boat run to the lodge. I have a 16.5 crestliner with a 90hp and have never had an issue with waves. Most I have scene is about a foot max. There are some great places to just cruise with the family and explore. You can always find a quiet cove to pull to and swim / shore lunch. PM me if you need more.Have a great time.Mike
1520758,NMG,2013-01-07 17:05:00,1053,"Thanks for the replies everyone. I didn't realize that the fishery was being hit that hard up on Nippising, so maybe I will look at other places first. I'll definitely check out the other suggestions you had for sure. I remember many of these places from watching fishing shows growing up as a kid in BC and now that I live out here it can be a bit overwhelming trying to make a decision. I guess that's not a bad problem to have, LOL Much appreciated!"
