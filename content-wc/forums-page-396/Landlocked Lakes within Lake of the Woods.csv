Does anyone have any adventure stories from hiking into lakes like Wake, Hammeretas, or Cuss that look to be accessable on foot from the main lake? So many landlocked lakes exist within the Aulneau Peninsula and I have a belly boat with their names on it. Simply daydreaming of Canadian fishing adventure!"
