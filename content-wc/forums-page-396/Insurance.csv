1519246,Larry S,2013-01-03 10:23:00,665,Some Lodges offer insurance to cover the motors-lower units & props on their boats This may be what is being asked about.
1519259,LOW1,2013-01-03 10:30:00,2828,"Perhaps the place to start is by having your friend talk to his insurance agent and determine whether he already has coverage under his existing homeowner's, boat, or umbrella coverages. For example, many boat policies have an ""operation with consent"" provision which covers you if you are operating another boat with the owner's permision. If there is not existing coverage your friend may be able to buy a rider or a policy which provides this coverage. Your friend should be aware that his liability coverage may protect him if he is negligent but he may sign a rental agreement which holds him responsible for damage to the rented boat regadless of whether he is negligent, so read the policies and discuss with the agent with this in mind. I don't know if boat rental places offer damage waiver protection, as do car rental places. It may be worth a call to the lodge to find out."
1519312,Hillbiehle,2013-01-03 12:19:00,66,"Insurance policies vary from company to company. However, the majority provide liabity for rented boats under 48' within the United States. An umbrella policy goes further and provides liability coverage in Canada and sometimes increases the lenght (renting a house boat). With an umbrella, if you damage a resort boat, you can file a claim under your umbrella liability policy. Always check with your agent first as coverages vary."
1519322,Pooch,2013-01-03 13:07:00,4619,Three years ago my agent told me I was covered when using a camp boat up to the value that my own personal boat was covered.I'd not assume anything. Talk to your agent. Either way if you damage a camp boat you will probably need cash to cover the damages then collect from your insurance company when you get home. Document everything seems like the proper thing to do and carry a fair amount of cash or take the camp insurance if offered to be safe.Sooner or later.... rock attracts aluminum.....Pooch
1520335,vteye,2013-01-06 14:02:00,812,We cover liability on rented boats up to 26 feet in length as long as powered by a 50 hp or less. Guest has not ownership interest in camp boat. Ins company would need a special endorsement or rider to provide coverage. That being said a minor claim under $1000 pay it out of pocket. Do not use your home insurance for minor losses you are capable of handling. Home insurance claims are for substantial financial losses ie your buddy getting seriously hurt while you were operating the boat.
