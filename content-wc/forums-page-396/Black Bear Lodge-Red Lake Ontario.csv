My wife was talking at work about me going to Canada and one of the women that works in another department asked her if I would be interested in a good deal on a trip for two to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake in Ontario. It seems that her son won the trip at an outdoor show that he attended, entered a contest, and won the trip. He will not be able to go so he is looking to sell the trip at a bargin price. Does anyone have any information on this camp and/or this lake? Should I jump on the chance? Thanks for any information and thoughts."

The cabins and pit toilets would be her big issue.Fishing is good, food is good and boats and service are good. That is what I am looking for.www.fishblackbear.com"

These are new owners and I'm sure they will make your trip a memory. I'd love to go again some summer in July, but I'm not working now. There were days I caught over 100 fish a day. Did not keep many practiced release. Huge lake and easy to get lost shoreline can look the same from far away. The fish can be large and the food was always good. There are Ground Hogs that are tame. It is beautiful up there. AND you do need passport which I need to get soon so I can go. Dan H. 815-273-2858"
