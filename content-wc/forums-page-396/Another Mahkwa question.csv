I've never looked into the smaller cabins for a small group. Anyone have any photos or opinions of the smaller cabins?Has anyone stayed on the lodge side of the camp? Maybe on the modified American plan? Are they separate cabins for just two people or ""apartment"" type rooms?Thanks,Pooch"

I do not know much about the american plan, but it looked nice over there. Great place to fish wish I could go back soon.Rodney Bondele"
1513410,windriderhog,2012-12-15 08:00:00,61,I've stayed on the American side at Makwa for the last four years. They have 3 person cabins with single beds and also have cabins that sleep up to 8 with 2 to 3 in a room. Some of the newer ones are nice. The older ones are showing some wear but I have no complaints. The food and maid service is great.

The food was very good and the rooms were clean with a small air conditioner & 1 small refrigerator in each room. These were like a normal motel room----3 men max. My wife & I were alone on one of the trips. She enjoyed the fishing--nothing else for her to do. We looked at the cabins on the american plan side and they looked nice---when we get a larger group we will do that. As you know fishing was great. John"
