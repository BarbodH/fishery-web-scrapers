1518621,Gregking,2013-01-01 16:09:00,2658,X3 for witch bay camps. Gail and Steve are the nicest people I have ever met. They actually care about you. Dad and my two brothers made it up there 3 times last year. I only made it twice. That is something unheard of for us. Once maybe twice is the norm
1518886,Guest,2013-01-02 11:29:00,0,Which ever you choose make sure they don't nickel and dime you to death. I've stayed with some of the drive too's in the past and refuse to go back due to that reason. good luck.

Coffee delivered to cabin at 6 AM & daily linen service. Can't go wrong."
1516235,bassnblast,2012-12-23 16:09:00,56,"Went to Crow Rock Lodge last summer with my brother and loved it. Nice cabins, great meals and excellent boats. It is boat in -- about a 25 minute ride from Kenora -- so very remote. We only saw a few boats the days we were fishing. Caught walleye, bass, pike and muskie. They also have 8-9 small portage lakes that you can fish -- really fun way to mix things up a little and the fishing is great (we caught 40+ nice bass one morning on one of the lakes). We also made a run to Shoal Lake where we caught a ton of pike and bass (and my brother caught a 33"" wallleye while bass fishing). I highly recommend..."
1516260,1860Angler,2012-12-23 17:06:00,2642,"I have been to Ash Rapids Lodge 3 of the last 4 years, remote location, great fishing, access to Shoal Lake for some monster Pike, great people, awesome food, I can't say enough good things about it. It's about a 30 minute boat ride from Kenora."
1516279,Hawker,2012-12-23 17:47:00,3967,"Young's (Young's Wilderness Camp) in Stephens Bay on LOTW is and has everything your looking for and more!! Great (really great) food, nice cozy comfortable modern cabins, GREAT fishing, wonderful owners & staff, excellent boats, on an island 5 minute boat ride from drive to landing, excellent service! Been going there for the past 22 yrs straight and wouldn't even consider looking anywhere else!"

1517627,1700SS,2012-12-29 08:08:00,104,My vote would be for Obabikon Bay for american plan. Jared and his family are good people with great fishing. I prefer housekeeping and drive to resort and have been staying with Mike and his family at Red Wing Lodge for 15+ years.
1518557,LOWeyes,2013-01-01 12:50:00,3,I'd love to invite you and the crew to Ballard's Black Island. What month are you looking at? June and July are going fast for us... shoot me an email at [email protected]! SET THE HOOK!
1518603,zeebee,2013-01-01 15:25:00,1144,"Find a place that meets your budget and search on this website for reviews.. if it appears host friendly go there.. LOW is open to all...to me if the hospitality is good, you will not go wrong ...the rest is uo to u."
1515984,wingmann,2012-12-22 17:46:00,42,"Getting a group of guys together and looking for a resort on Lake of the Woods. Need a place that has an American Plan and rents boats. Not looking for a real high end place but something nice, with good fishing, nice cabins and hopefully good service and meals.Thanks,Wingmann17"
1515990,Golden Eagle,2012-12-22 18:17:00,2642,Obabikon is an advertiser on the forum. Good lake. Good guy. I suggest giving him a try.
1515992,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2012-12-22 18:24:00,629,"wingman:Fire-up the computer & look-up ""Ballard's Black Island Resort"". Gary Moeller & crew will be entering their 2nd season(2013) with the resort out of Morson, Ontario. Gary is the GM & has multiple years in the resort business & knows how to be a great host. He also is part of the ""Ballard's Resort"" on the Rainy River & South Shore of LOTW. I know Gary personally from years on the South Shore & have stopped @ Black Island, but never have stayed there. But, I have been to the Island & can say that it is a very well run & maintained camp. You will be able to drive to Morson, Ont. & the camp will then pick you up & take you to the island by boat. Give a look see on their website. There is another camp I'm familiar with out of Morson, but they are a hsekeeping camp known as ""Tamarack"". They also have a website, & Todd is a young man full of enthusiasm! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
1516044,PJM,2012-12-22 22:18:00,3516,Wingmann What time of the year are you thinking about coming and what do you want to fish for.
1516049,nemusky,2012-12-23 00:00:00,60,"I have heard real good things about both Duck Bay's Lodge, top notch rental boats, great food, and the cabins aren't shabby either."
1516051,Tamarack,2012-12-23 02:38:00,16,"Thanks for the referral John, although most of our customers do the housekeeping thing, we do offer the American Plan as well. Good luck with your search, there are a lot of great resorts on this lake, especially out of Morson. Obabikon, Duck Bay, Grassy Narrows and Youngs all have great reputations!"
1516057,bellbuoy,2012-12-23 05:46:00,490,"Witch Bay, Gail and Steve will take great care of your group."
1516058,teddi,2012-12-23 05:47:00,349,"i guess i won,t see you this winter. i am working up north till spring so i won,t be doing any shows. have fun with jennifer."
1516092,wingmann,2012-12-23 08:25:00,42,"Thank you to all who have replied with suggestions. Please keep them coming.We mostly like to fish for walleye, northern and bass. Anything else would be a bonus."
1516145,tyeeguy,2012-12-23 10:23:00,111,I go to Whitefishbay camp. It is on an island so it is quiet at night and there isn't the constant commotion of cars coming and going all the time. It also has the feeling of being on a remote lake. The area of Whitefish bay that it is on has many islands so there is always quiet water to fish no matter how hard the wind blows. It has all the species of fish you mentioned along with world class musky fishing near camp. I like the ability of adding a Lake Trout to my catch.
