561997,Minnow Man,2006-11-18 08:29:00,85,Heard a story that South Bay Lodge on Confederation Lake burnt to the ground. Any info on this?
562001,grt1,2006-11-18 14:44:00,259,don't know if it burnt to the ground but the Red Lake newspaper said the OPP were investigating the burning of several buildings as arson. that is all I know.
562002,Guest,2006-11-18 15:27:00,0,"Yes, I can provide lots of detail. Operators left the lodge on October 5th. Two hunters staying at one of the cabins along the shore in the same bay just to the north left on the 6th. All was fine. A guy who had put in at the landing to the east found the buildings burnt to the ground on October 13th. As last I heard, there is nothing known of the period in between (8-12). There are really three potential reasons: 1) Accidental fire 2) Arson by somebody with a specific intention, and 3) Arson via random act of violence. You can rule out accidental, no forest fires, no burning on the grass in between cabins. All buildings were burnt with separate fires, and each was set from inside each building. If you are familiar with the lodge, cabins 3, 4, 7, 8, the main lodge, the guide shack, the laundry room, the sauna, and the operator's newer cabin all burnt to the ground. Cabins 1, 2, 5, 6, the fish house, the garbage shed, the tool shed, and the generator weren't touched. Nothing appeared missing or disturbed...tools were all there, quad was there unmoved, and once again the generator wasn't touched! If you know the property and the layout, it is the cabins which line the forest and the property behind that were not touched, perhaps because somebody wanted to make sure only the lodge went up, and the other untouched cabin was the one out on the extended point, which theoretically could be seen easier. Somebody doing this would have needed to devote some time to it...there is nothing nearby, they almost assuredly had to boat to the property, which likely would have had to include trailering a boat out there, going across, and getting back out of there...or going in the Woman Lake system and hiking over. It's a LOT OF EFFORT and a LOT OF RISK to be #3(random act of violence). Which leaves only #2. All I can say is the lodge was up for sale, had been for some time now, the listed price was $550,000 last I checked, which in my opinion was too much. It has been financially struggling, new owners and operators 3 years ago, new operators this past season, the old operators weren't overly happy when they left, but the new operators seemed to be turning things around......... So there are some details to think about. NWO Fishing Bum"
562027,Biffster,2006-11-23 13:03:00,2,"Mmmmmm, maybe the new operators were looking to get a 'better deal' on the lodge?"
562028,Guest,2006-11-23 14:54:00,0,It is a buyer's market! I know you're in for 50K Biffster. NWO Fishing Bum
562030,Biffster,2006-11-23 18:20:00,2,"That's funny. I would be in, however, I would like a better fishery. The location is pretty sweet, but it needs a lot of $$$ to make it quality resort. The fire sure makes the needed improvements a lot easier. Interesting...."
562034,Guest,2006-11-24 01:43:00,0,"Yeah, I just don't know about the fishery. Tough spring this past year on which to judge pike fishing...I'll give you a call at work tomorrow (Friday), and we can talk more about this. NWO Fishing Bum"
