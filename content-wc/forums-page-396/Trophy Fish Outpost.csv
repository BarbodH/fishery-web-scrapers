Looking to plan another trip to one of their lakes, Peninsular, and looking for any reviews. @Novtroy - any chance you have been to Peninsular?"

540675,Crede,2004-06-13 19:30:00,134,"Went to Machawaian in 1998 and Kenosha in 2000 - both times in late Aug./early Sept. Had a good experience both times. Good cabin, boats, motors, etc. Spent most of our efforts on walleye. Bad day 20-30 per man, Good day 70+ per man. More good days than bad. Most 2-4 lbs. A few 6-8 for the week. Can't comment on the Pike fishing. Have heard good things about Keezik, but opennings/dates have never worked right for us. Will definitely go back sometime. Let me know if I can be of more specific help. Crede"

540725,Guest,2004-06-14 14:59:00,0,"Thanks, Crede. We, too will be targeting walleye in Sept. Did you try the portage lakes?"
540735,Crede,2004-06-14 19:03:00,134,Didn't try the portage lakes. Did boat into the next lake down from Kenozha and had a good day there. Crede

1477204,Guest,2012-08-20 20:19:00,0,Have been fishing with Ernie and Donna for 20 years. They are the best outfitters I have used. Camp and boats are well taken care of. They used to outfit many camps but have limited the the number of outposts
