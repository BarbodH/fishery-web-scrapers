1519540,MrSimon,2013-01-04 07:51:00,922,"I've gotten a few PMs about our recent trip to Happy Day Lodge on Lake Windermere. A handful of the questions were about ""what is the scenery like"" and ""what was the weather like"" and ""what can I expect from the fishing"". Well, here are three short videos that should answer those questions nicely. 1. The weather and scenery in late August are unbeatable. The remoteness and solitude you get are great too. These two videos show it well. This is a video of us cruising up Windermere in one of the lodge's rental boats.http://youtu.be/lvU-BlHNFxE This is a video of my buddy after catching a decent pike on Goldie Lake. You get a real good feel for what that lake looks like.http://youtu.be/V5B_LA-gaII 2. The walleye fishing on Windermere is very good. Admittedly we are terrible walleye fishermen, but even we were able to catch plenty of decent eyes while trolling around with spinners and cranks. Here is a video of my buddy catching one of our first walleye. We were all excited.http://youtu.be/vBSPX4WiA-0 And just for fun, here is a video of that same buddy getting a pike stuck in the landing net and making a scene trying to get it out.http://youtu.be/-93s1HCoIbM"

They had been having problems earlier in the day with the motor, so we all got a laugh out of them not being able to get it going .... not to mention we were a 45 minute boat ride, a 45 minute hike, and another 15 minute boat ride from our cabin. Having a motor crap out that far from the cabin would have been really bad.http://youtu.be/NymidTPc66Q"
