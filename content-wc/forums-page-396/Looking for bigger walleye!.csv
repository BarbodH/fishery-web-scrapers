1520123,Bill Krejca,2013-01-05 17:05:00,6107,"If it is size, not numbers, Tramping Lake in Manitoba is a good place. It may be farther to drive, maybe than you want. Check out the Manitoba Master Angler list. Anything over 22"" must be released. Bill Krejca"
1520185,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-05 22:02:00,608,"rather-be-fishin, I have good friends that fish Mille Lacs frequently and they have catches of walleye in the 20""-29"" class on a fairly consistent basis."

1520248,Duflebag,2013-01-06 09:24:00,218,I would add to the Lac Seul group. I have fished both Eagle and Lac Seul for over 20 ears. Lac Seul hands down has better numbers and larger fish average. My best day on Lac Seul size wise were two back to back 30.5 inchers within ten minutes of each other. The lists of resorts above is spot on. Can't wait.

1519860,Apeters40,2013-01-04 20:14:00,3,"Hi everyone, our family has been fishing walleye on Gullrock for the past 6 years. We have had a great time and caught lots of fish. We are ready for a new fishing location/resort with the opportunity to catch larger walleyes. We live in west central MN, a few hours closer to home would be nice, but not a requirement. Any suggestions appreciated!"
1519864,ftfarms,2013-01-04 20:29:00,444,Since 1991 I've ben lucky enough to fish twenty five weeks in Ontario and that has ben in nine different lakes all drive to and for walleyes over 24 inches it's ben lac suel south of ear falls and English river north of kenora. That's what I've found.
1519865,TinmanDon,2013-01-04 20:30:00,194,"are you looking for spot to fish thru the ice?? check out Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, awesome walleye fishery.....and the bite is on right now, huge greenbacks being caught as we speak, lots over 30"".....will be out tomorrow so will post results after"
1519866,TinmanDon,2013-01-04 20:32:00,194,like this one...
1519867,rather-be-fishin,2013-01-04 20:41:00,429,"What size walleye are you looking to catch? We fish NW to Central area of Lac Seul & find that we catch MANY walleye that are very fat 19 - 26"". Also catch a few 26 - 28"" & caught one 32"". Is this the size your looking for? Would be a little closer than Gull Rock. If this is what your looking for check out Fishermans Cove, Onaway Lodge or Lac Seul Lodge resorts area of Lac Seul located South of Ear Falls, ON on Hwy 105. Good Luck! RBF"
1519868,Pezman38,2013-01-04 20:42:00,3196,"I go to gullrock for numbers, and Lake Erie for size!"
1519874,wallydave,2013-01-04 20:55:00,2151,For Lac Seul! I have caught a 30 and back to back 29.5 inch walleyes fishing the NW section near Ear Falls. Pooch will tell you Savant has some big walleyes! Eddie North seems to have big eyes and pike too! Wait for a few more replies and check out the tips on the web!
1519880,Apeters40,2013-01-04 21:22:00,3,"Thanks for the replies everyone! We typically make this trip in late June, early July. LacSuel is on the list. Has anyone had luck on Eagle? Any favorite spots on LOTW?"
1519949,jiggster,2013-01-05 08:02:00,183,"I have fished Eagle several times. Can be tough to fish in the beginning. Lac Suel is a fantastic fisheries. Depends on if you are looking for large water, American plan, etc. I have been fishing the English River by Ear Falls out of Anderson's Manitou Falls camp. He is having new motors this year. You can always get out fishing and there are 7 lakes off the system only resort for approx. 25 miles. We have had walleyes up to 32 in. I personally would choose Anderson's for fishing, but not if you are looking for American plan. They do have a u tube about the area. Our best walleye of the dock was 27 and the best northern from the dock was 45. If you want more information about Anderson or Eagle send me a p.m."
1519962,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-05 08:32:00,608,How about Mille Lacs?
