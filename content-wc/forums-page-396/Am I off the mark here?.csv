I understand folks from the US can now enter Canada with a DUI on a one-time basis for a fee, etc., Maybe this is an extension of that. While I don't want to see this thread turn into a discussion/argument over whether Canadians or Americans think the current policy or the previous policy is right or wrong, I had a thought I hadn't seen here before, and wanted to see what you all thought. Perhaps if the idea is sound, someone on the Canadian government/tourism side might think so as well..... If an individual that has a DUI and applied in advance, every year, with the requisite fee, and named specifically his point of entry and date of entry and exit. He's sent a card he presents with his passport at the entry point on the specified day. He's given a document to sign wherein he agrees he a passenger only, has no driving rights in Canada, specifies penalties, the plate number is noted, driver signs as well and consents to at will stop by law enforcemnet to verify who's driving. Seems like it might accomplish a couple things: 1. Gets more folks to Canada, on more than a one-time basis, increases revenue/tourism/helps resorts 2. Doesn't unnecessarily put Canadian citizens at risk 3. Provides a revenue source for the govt/province 4. provides a penalty for infractions 5. and while not necessarily a benefit to Canada, may make it easier for folks to set up trips to go if one guy in the group can go, but can't drive, at least the annual trip doesn't fall apart because one of the regulars made a one-time, boneheaded mistake."

How long would that be in effect until it ""goes away""?2) If even considered, I'm sure it would move through the bureaucracy at glacial speed just in time for our unborn grand-children to benefit."

1517879,Shellback,2012-12-30 08:55:00,8083,"Good thought. Not sure about that, as a DUI is not a felony in the states. But if your Canadian records show you have a felony, maybe you would be denied entry."
