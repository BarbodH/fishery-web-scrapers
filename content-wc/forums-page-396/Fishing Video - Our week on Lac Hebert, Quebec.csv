1513058,Pezman38,2012-12-14 07:09:00,3196,I'll check I movie out and Jewelbeat. GoPro is pretty impressive once I figured out the software for it is terrible. I'll start a new thread we can discuss settings.
1513066,Hillbiehle,2012-12-14 07:44:00,66,"Great video! Quick question, is your cabin the only one on the lake or are there other outfitters as well? Again, great video."
1513292,keek,2012-12-14 20:25:00,1003,"Thanks for watching the video! There are 7 cabins on the lake. There are 2 at the northern end and our group was split between those two. It was about a 2 minute boat ride to visit our buddies cabin. About 5 miles away there is an island with a really cool cove (you can see it from the plane as we fly over it at the end of the video) with about 5 other cabins and the caretaker. The only people fishing the lake which is about 12 miles long are in those 7 cabins. We had a TON of water to ourselves. Air Tamarac has exclusive rights for Lac Hebert. Everything was top of the line - New 4stroke Merc, Lund boats, on-demand hot water heater in the cabin, etc. We were in cabin 26 on the map which is found on the Lac Hebert page of Air Tamarac's website"
1513788,Erie Ranger620,2012-12-16 11:03:00,74,Love your video gives me some new ideas. I love filming and watching videos later it takes me right back to the moment it happened especially during the winter! I blog all my fishing trips Erie and Canada at http://walleyewarrior.blogspot.com/ Here is an example of one of my Canada trips. http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature...&v=RSEvWSKb7cg I wish there was a place where all fishing blogs could be on one site seperated by species or locations
1513884,adempsey,2012-12-16 15:59:00,963,"Ahh,thanks. I needed that!"
1514089,keek,2012-12-17 08:37:00,1003,Good stuff!
1517638,NY Walleye,2012-12-29 08:59:00,78,Impressive video.plan on hitting Hebert this July. Should we awesome.
1518355,keek,2012-12-31 17:59:00,1003,You'll have an incredible time. PM if you have any questions.
1512904,keek,2012-12-13 15:53:00,1003,The software is iMovie - nothing special really but the more you play with it the more tricks you discover- I buy music from Jewelbeat dot com that can be legally used in videos without infringing on copy-write. Enjoy your Go-Pro!
1512907,keek,2012-12-13 15:55:00,1003,Thanks Pikeslayer! Sorry about stoking the FEVER!
1512936,515,2012-12-13 17:13:00,254,Great job and looks like a nice camp. Thanks for posting.
1512970,Mpower,2012-12-13 18:32:00,1032,"Nice work on the video! I have same blue buff as your buddy If you want to add any music you want, download audacity, its free. You can change the pitch of the song slightly, but its not noticable. That will get you around the copyright stuff on youtube."
1512976,Rich B,2012-12-13 18:41:00,1081,"Keek, I just shared your video link with my buddies that go north with me for the Spring Opener, as it's a fun video to watch (music is good too).....nice job on the editing as well. Thanks, Rich B"
1512998,keek,2012-12-13 20:11:00,1003,Thanks M - That's me actually in the blue buff - Bluewater Camo right? I love that thing. I'll try Audacity thanks for the tip.
1512999,keek,2012-12-13 20:12:00,1003,Share away Rich! I've spent many a winter night looking at fishing videos on the web and I'm glad I could finally contribute.
1513008,Mpower,2012-12-13 20:38:00,1032,Yeap...love those buffs!
1513037,keek,2012-12-14 04:42:00,1003,Cool shot!
1513054,Pezman38,2012-12-14 07:03:00,3196,Beckman and Ciscos! Nice shot man
1512680,keek,2012-12-12 19:26:00,1003,This past July I got the chance to fish Lac Hebert with Air Tamarac. INCREDIBLE. Thanks to Octanehi5 for opening up spots for my guys to join in the fun. Hope you enjoy and maybe it will help with the cabin fever that's setting in. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiPCqmilG3I&feature=plcp
1512696,wallydave,2012-12-12 21:00:00,2151,Yea nothing like some cabin fever treatment! Looks like your group had a great time!! Time for the 2013 countdown isn't too far away!
1512697,Knoxabilly,2012-12-12 21:01:00,225,"Awesome video, looks like you guys had a great time!"
1512708,bassnblast,2012-12-12 21:31:00,56,Great footage! What type of camera?
1512721,marapoint,2012-12-13 04:56:00,38,"Really enjoyed the Video - so much so, I watched it twice!Thanks for posting,bobby"
1512729,Juls,2012-12-13 05:51:00,13414,Nice video..thanks for sharing it. Looks like you guys had a great trip... Juls
1512731,keek,2012-12-13 06:04:00,1003,Thanks! We did have a great trip - one of those trips that make you want to return the minute you get home. The camera is a Contour Roam and you can see it on my head in a couple of still shots. It's a good camera that shoots 1080HD but if I had to do it again I would go with the GoPro.Thanks again for watching!
1512752,Pezman38,2012-12-13 07:20:00,3196,"Awesome video man, thanks for sharing. Tell the guy at 4:30 to stop messing with his drag while fighting fish :-). What editing software do you use? I just got the GoPro black edition and have been playing nonstop with it."
1512885,Pikeslayer8,2012-12-13 14:40:00,1460,"You know, I was gettin along pretty dang well as of late. I've kept the fever down somewhat and BAM Keek goes and posts this awesome video. I think I'm ruined for the rest of the winter. Wallydave might just as well post another one of those countdown threads. Really cool video and a lot of hogs in der. Well done!"
1512901,keek,2012-12-13 15:51:00,1003,LOL! That guy is me! I'm using 3lb fireline on that reel.
