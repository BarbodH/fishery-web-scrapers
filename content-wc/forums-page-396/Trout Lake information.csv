1519039,scar,2013-01-02 18:14:00,196,Are you talking about the Trout lake 40 miles east of Red Lake? If so I am not familiar with Walstren Outfitters but I am with Trout lake as I fished there 9 years in a row. Let me know if we are talking about the same Trout Lake
1519087,stillangling,2013-01-02 21:14:00,149,I think that the Trout Lake being referred to is northwest of Separation Lake and just off of the English River Road (north of Kenora). No experience with the lake myself.
1519108,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-01-03 01:55:00,358,Yessir the one north of Kenora is the one I'm interested in. I should have given more info on location.
