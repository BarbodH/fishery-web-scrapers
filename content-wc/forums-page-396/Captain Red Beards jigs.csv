The paint is way better and I liked the hammered Colorado blades. I only wished I had more. The 3/16 oz. hot pink was just the ticket. I fished it with a 3"" Yum grub white and tipped it with a small piece of crawler. I wasn't as happy as I thought I would be with the Cleopatria Gold's color but the hook is definetely stout. It's what I snagged a big sturgeon with. Can't blame the jig for losing it, however. I will be putting a large order of these pink ones."
1448906,HeHooksHimself,2012-06-13 14:58:00,725,"We used Capn Redbeards chartreuse with the gold blade. I outfished most of my boat partners through the week, but everything was working!"
1449041,1shooter,2012-06-13 20:42:00,1493,Those are the ones. The bucktail version.
1519961,Joek3,2013-01-05 08:31:00,244,What color blade do you guys prefer? Gold or silver?
1519994,Seanik,2013-01-05 10:15:00,218,"Definitely gold, gold 3 to 1 over silver at tannin stained Flindt Landing camp with 1/4 oz hot pink, white or chartrause. Seanik"
1407787,J Arendt,2012-03-16 08:58:00,45,Can anybody comment on the jigs from Captain Red Beards?
1407798,HeHooksHimself,2012-03-16 09:22:00,725,"I just received my order. They look like they will be deadly. We have used a similar jig from Northland that we usually pay about 1.50 or so for at Cabela's. These are a little more expensive but I probably saved quite a bit of $ by not impulse buying at Cabela's. He threw in an extra jig in the CLEOPATRA color for me to try. Turn around time was less than a week. We will be trying them in 62 days, I will post our results after our trip."
1407808,NathanH,2012-03-16 09:34:00,697,How are they diffrent from a road runner jig? Better quality they look about the same to me. Just wanted to know if its worth the exta .75 each? Look forward to the imput.
1407849,wallydave,2012-03-16 11:05:00,2151,"Last year Capn Redbeards walleye weapons were the best producing jig I used. It was early June while we were fishing the NW section of Lac Seul, the weather patterns were constantly changing, it made for some tough fishing. The walleye weapons held to the 3-1 catch ratio! Gold and Pink seemed to work the best. I went with the gold blade for the stained water on LS. I placed an order as soon I got back home , so I am ready to go for this years trip! I have picked up a couple different Northland jigs, thumper and whisler to try this year. We were fishing in some current, and the Redbeard jigs just plain worked, after I found the angle that produced the most flutter from the blade. The only time I had multiple back to back walleyes were using these jigs! Sirmanski Jigs worked well too, especially pink! Both worked, I like to have a couple of rigs set up, one with Sirmanski and the other with the Capn!"
1407860,Pikeslayer8,2012-03-16 11:36:00,1460,"As a primarily Roadrunner jig fisherman, I really think that you are on to something big for my tackle box. I like the offered sizes and I also feel that the gold hammered Colorado blades will be a giant upgrade over the silver Roadrunner blades. I ordered the pink, white and lots of cleopatra colors offered.Thanks Wallydave for sharing."
1407871,wallydave,2012-03-16 12:05:00,2151,"Pikeslayer, the main purpose of WC is to share the good and the bad things about our favorite shore lunch protein! I know I have learned a lot from this board, so it is only right to pass these things along! Who knows what presentation will work for this years trip! We are going a few weeks later than usual, so we will be trying different methods. Good luck with the Capn! Lots of pics and a report, and have a beverage of your choice for me!"
1407916,NathanH,2012-03-16 14:17:00,697,Good to know. I know road runners now have gold blades but I think the weights are limited. I might have to add some to the box.
1407960,Seanik,2012-03-16 15:52:00,218,After reading these posts I ordered a selection of the Captn's jigs it was easy using paypal. The jigs should work well at Lakes Nagagami(Hornepayne) Heathcote(Flindt Landing) both Tannin stained lakes. The blade will make a difference especially dressed with a crawler. Seanik
1408072,1shooter,2012-03-16 21:53:00,1493,Nice jigs but my weapon of choice are these:http://www.deanstacklebox.com/dressedjigs.html
1415244,NathanH,2012-04-02 13:00:00,697,I saw The good Capt at the NW Sports Show this weekend. Walked by 3 times before I broke down and purchased a few jigs. Very nice guy. It was hard to spend 7 dollars on 4 jigs but will see if they produce. The blade size is large when compaired to the Northland Thumper jigs of which I purchased a packet or two as well.
