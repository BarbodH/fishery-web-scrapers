1513268,Guest,2012-12-14 19:26:00,0,"I guess ""cut a deal"" has it all figured out, not getting nothing by him. He seems to know what everyone should charge and how to market it to be a profitable business. I have heard there are resorts and outpost businesses for sale, maybe he should show everyone how it's done. Who cares if someplace charges to much, go somewhere else. They will either adjust their rates if no goes there or new owners will come in. If they stick around, then others must feel their services are worth it. Enjoy your hotel room. I will be lakefront and happy to pay more for it. There's more to the trip for my group than just the fishing."
1513284,v-bay gord,2012-12-14 20:04:00,3168,"Thank you for admitting your calculations are a bit off. Now, the question about boat and motor rental. I think that is a throw-back to the past. Maybe due to the unreliability of old motors, but some folk used to bring along a motor and just rent a boat. That is a relic of the past. Regarding per person vs per cabin costs.......well, I guess the hours spent cleaning the cabin varies on how many people were in it...how many fish you clean depends on how many guests, etc.......so why not a per person cost? Regarding exchange rates, I agree some people used it to their advantage. Sucks to be them now. Bottom line is people can charge whatever they want....but you can choose to stay wherever you want so do your research and know what you get for the $ you are going to spend.. Re: fish1......I agree, I would like to see ""cut a deal"" in the camp biz....offering those great rates....it's been done before.....does ""Bear Trail Lodge"" ring a bell?"

Cut a deal--please keep comments like this to yourself. It's not nuts when you have a perfectly running, old 15 horse motor that you don't sell just for purposes like this. Some people in my group are pinching pennies and it's great for me to be able to say to them, ""hey I'll throw in this motor for you in my boat and save you and your son a couple hundred dollars."" That motor has more than paid for itself 3x over the last 20 years. we don't take it every year but I'll keep it in the garage just for that occasion."
1513392,Cut a deal,2012-12-15 07:22:00,38,Morning Gord .What's Bear Trail Lodge all about? Sorry for hi jacking this topic but I look at you as the mensa guru of all operators and your posts are well thought out not like mine.Anyways it's Sat.morn got some time what's your thoughts on Walleye tournaments? Now they gotta be good for locals but I found something on the internet about a Can Am tournament. There are slot sizes in some areas in Ontario zone 17 sizes are 13.8 in to 19.7 in.So what's the point the guy who catches the largest fish doesn't even win. Now I found this there seems to be a huge problem with Fish Kill at weigh ins. Some guy named Fenelon started a topic it's a lot of pages with different views. Have a look and tell me what you think or is there a better way.http://forums.oodmag.com/showthread.php?t=45575
1513429,v-bay gord,2012-12-15 08:30:00,3168,"I don't particularly agree with walleye tournaments. I don't have time this morning to read through all of your link, but the first post says it all. Quite bad. I don't have an issue with a catch and release bass tournament. They seem to be much hardier fish. Bear Trail....just do search here. Part of the issue is low balling your rates to generate business......eventually it catches up to you. It wasn't the whole story, but a big part of it."

First thing I noticed is they probably expect you to pay for your own gas. Also I used this inflation calculator from 1955. .What cost $100 in 1955 would cost $828.29 in 2012. ""Here are the prices from the 50's at Goose Bay! A cabin for two, $35 a week! Boat options, 16ft wooden $4 a day. 14ft aluminum $4 a day. The top of the line 16ft aluminum $5 a day.

1513259,Cut a deal,2012-12-14 18:54:00,38,"Gord ok I might be off by couple peso or 2. Saw your family package I like it. Here,s a thing maybe you can answer it .It,s not about you. This boat rental and motor rental what the heck is that all about. It,s like renting a car from Budget.One for a car and one for a car with a engine. Who the heck brings their own motor and rents a boat. Who the heck brings a boat and rents a motor that's nuts. Also when did this all change you used to be able to rent a cabin sleeps 3 sleeps 5 whatever then someone made a decision to go per person.Well the $1500 cabin went to 3K and if you didn't want to row a boat you had to get a motor and so on. Now one more you remember not to long ago when the dollar was 60 cent or so to US funds and operators in Canada wanted to be payed in US funds. Their expenses were in Canadian funds then they went to the bank and grabbed $1400 for every $1000 US. They made a killing on exchange. Now the way things are going some day you might see a US dollar at 60 cents to Canadian dollar and the first thing you will see is pay in Canadian funds only.It,s almost false advertising before it was cabin -boat-motor that's it now you gotta add all this up before you get hosed."
1511919,Northtwin,2012-12-10 13:09:00,175,Does anyone own a houseboat on LOW or Rainy Lk? I was wondering if it might be an alternative to looking for a cabin or lake lot. I would assume there are marina docking fees involved and gas etc..... Can a US citizen anchor the houseboat anywhere in canadian waters? Any info would be appriciated.
1512224,Hillbiehle,2012-12-11 10:56:00,66,"I'm intreested in seeing the responces. I've often entertained the same idea. The depreciation to me is the only expense. The cost to rent docking and storage is far cheaper than property taxes. I wish I could provide more detail, but most of the research I've done was with Lake Superior or Crane Lake in mind."
1512231,dutchboy,2012-12-11 11:15:00,5717,I don't own a houseboat but will offer this. You can dock it at Sportsman dock on Hwy 11 East. They are located just before where you turn to get into the park. I don't know if they have electric hook-up there or not. As far as anchoring in Canada I would think the same laws apply as fishing there. You will need a license and a remote crossing permit. Call the Canadian customs in Fort Francis for details on anchoring there.Also I have seen houseboats tied up at Frontier Resort on the Ash River Trail. However you can access the Canadian side from there also. That would be 30 miles closer then International Falls.I would think that a seasonal trailer would be more cost effective unless you are able to spend the whole summer up there.
1512284,LOW1,2012-12-11 13:48:00,2828,"You might want to investigate this. Canadian real estate property taxes in the Lake of the Woods area are more reasonable than American property taxes. We pay about .5% of fair market value yearly.A person could of course buy a good used houseboat for much less than the cost of a cabin, but I do not think that you would save much on the yearly maintenance, etc expenses.You could check with Northern Harbor, Two Bears, or the other larger marinas by Kenora to get a price for storage, etc."
1512292,Bill Krejca,2012-12-11 14:02:00,6107,"I do not know, so I am not being solid rock certain, but my wag is that, bring a nonresident, you would have to have a camping permit and follow the same rules as a tent camper. Another wag is that if you rent a houseboat, the permit and accompanying restrictions would not apply. I I'm sure a commercial renter of houseboats would be delighted to explain the regulations. How about it guys? Bill Krejca"
1512299,SinOrSwim,2012-12-11 14:24:00,1528,"I own a houseboat but not up there so can't answer any of those questions. However, the cost and maintenace of a boat that big can certainly add up. I know that part first hand. You may be better off in the long run with a cabin? It would be cheaper to rent a room in a lodge."
1512319,Northtwin,2012-12-11 16:00:00,175,I would be spending most of the summer (on and off) on it so it would get quite a bit of use. I know it is illegal to camp on crown land however would anchoring a houseboat be different?
1512328,SinOrSwim,2012-12-11 16:30:00,1528,"I'm unsure of any of the rules and regs you would be dealing with. I have owned 3 different houseboats over the years from pontoon style to full hulls so if you get to the point you want to buy, I'd be happy to answer any questions about the boat part. I've gone from an old pontoon with 70hp outboard to my current boat with aluminum hull and twin 5L motors. Pros and cons to both.Lot's of differences. Regardless of what you decide.....ALUMINUM hull or pontoons is the only way to go in my opinion. Then, there are all sorts of otehr things to take into account. Roof material, motors, inboard, outboard, twins, single etc. Not sure if there are boats up there to purchase but I can also give you information about transport etc. There are houseboat sites on-line. Here are a few:http://www.houseboatsbuyterry.com/http://www.boattrader.com/http://www.eliteboatsales.net/http://www.yournewboat.com/houseboats.htmlThere are a few others as well. I will say many of those boats will be the same boats on there. Most people who go through brokers have them priced way too high. Many boats sell within a marina or on craigslist depending on where you are. Thus, not paying a 10% brokerage fee. If you are going to anchor against shore you will likely want a pontoon style and reinforce the crap out of the areas that are against shore. Sand is one thing but up north I assume there will be docking against the rocks. Also, you will have to make sure the marina will pull it in and out for you. I know of a trailer for sale if you are interested as well."
