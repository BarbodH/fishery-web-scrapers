2741425,Gregking,2014-04-30 09:36:00,2658,"Going into Canada, how modified is it? I have a exhaust and tuner but I hunt with it so I have a practical pickup, I put a 4"" exhaust with muffler and my tuner is set for economy and I don't have a problem. If you have 2 exhaust pipes sticking out the box that are big enough you could practice free throws with or a smoke tune you might have a issue. Of a cummins making 150 db's at idle you might get your stuff tossed. Idk what canada rules are, I don't rock the boat and respect the boarder guys. I try to eliminate any possible problems to better my chances of spending more time on the water vs getting my underwear looked at."
2741769,erieangler,2014-04-30 10:40:00,57,"Thanks gregking , my truck isn't rolling coal and doesn't look like it belongs in a stadium crushing vws, but it also has 4"" exhaust with a tuner egr and cat delete and a stage 1 turbo.. I'm with you, don't want to stir the pot with the folks at the boarder"
2741793,biggamefisher,2014-04-30 10:43:00,540,"CBSA doesn't enforce any laws that don't pertain to crossing the border, they could care less your driving a modified vehicle, unless of coarse it's modified to hide stuff?????????The RCMP and/or local police are the enforcement agency(s) responsible for that, that being said they don't do stake outs at the border waiting for folks to cross. Even once inside our country, behave yourself, don't draw suspicion to yourself or break any traffic laws which would result in being pulled over and you will be fine!"
2742297,polaris-pete,2014-04-30 13:18:00,343,Very well said biggamefisher.!!!
2742465,Aaron-IN,2014-04-30 13:46:00,500,You will be fine.
2742865,Hammdog,2014-04-30 15:27:00,11,"I'm sure once they realize that you are famous rock star, they will just let you slide through. Unless someone has an older military compass that sets off their radiation alarms, no names mentioned(Kyle)."
2743433,erieangler,2014-04-30 18:21:00,57,"Thanks for the repllies guys, except for the one from you hammdog ( smart@**).... can you swim in40* water?"
