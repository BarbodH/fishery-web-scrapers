I've crossed off two on the list with a 21"" smallie and a 42"" pike lost two over 30"" walleyes at the boat one my fault one was hit by the netter. I've caught over a dozen walleye over 281/2"" the biggest 291/2. I guess I put the muskey up to 53"" cause my buddy caught one 50"""". That was awesome."
2666545,bigdog8837,2014-04-11 11:19:00,30,"20"" smallmouth30"" walleye40"" pikeThese are what I think are trophies. I have only managed the 30"" walleye. But my dad gets a 40"" plus pike almost every year we go to canada and I love just having the time to spend with him."
2666689,rocko0305,2014-04-11 12:08:00,138,"I would agree with you that those are the benchmarks for what I consider ""trophy"" for all 3 species. However, the more I think about it, I think the 30"" walleye needs to be adjusted, at least for my friends and family that I fish with. I think any walleye over 27"" would be a ""trophy"" in our book. The fact that our group has caught probably 10+ 20+ inch smallmouth, 25+ 40+ inch pike, and yet no walleye over 30 inches is why I think it would need adjusting. And that is not for lack of being good fisherman or not targeting walleyes a lot either. Numerous 27, 28, and 29 inch walleyes have been caught by our group, but no 30 inchers.....yet. Time to make that happen at Washi Lake this year."
2695122,Kenny_Ross,2014-04-18 14:59:00,103,"When setting a benchmark for trophy fish I have two standards....Length is used when looking at pike and musky (40 and 50"")Weight is used when looking at walleye (13lbs), bass (10lbs for largemouth and 6 for smallmouth), lake trout (30lbs) and rainbow trout (20lbs).Sadly Ive only achieved walleye, pike and smallmouth bass. The weight is kinda needed for the rainbows out of Dief....they tend to grow fat and round."
2696586,Fisherman Ted,2014-04-18 20:45:00,461,"I agree. Typically smallmouth trophy fish are measured in pounds, not inches. In NW Ontario a 20 inch smallie can go 6 pounds which is not so for other areas in North America. I would take a 6 pound smallie (and consider it a trophy) even if it only goes 19 inches."
2696738,rnnonmt,2014-04-18 21:21:00,992,"I think that it is relative to the waters you are fishing. A fish on one watershed maybe considered a trophy VS another watershed. If we are to consider all waters then I would have to go with:Muskie: 50""Pike: 46""Walleye: 30""Smallie: 21""Only because I am still haven't boated one of these..... Yet!"
2728289,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-04-27 07:13:00,629,"After having read through this thread on what people consider to be ""Trophy-Smallmouth"", I'm a little ashamed of my only mount.My experiences on LOTW & 100's of ""Smallies"" that I have come across, I feel that a 19"" to 20"" with no marks & in the 4# to 5# range is a trophy. In my opinion, a LOTW ""Smallie"" @ 22""-23"" & 6# is a trophy of a trophy.My mount is of 4-18.5""ers & 1-20""er. There was not a single mark or flaw on any of them. They were all caught in the same place with artificial lures ""Long-Lining"". I am proud to say that these 5 are the only ""Smallies"" that I have knowingly killed! Set the Hook, CRJohn"
2729113,kzoofisher,2014-04-27 12:08:00,5144,"Those are some beautiful fish. ""Trophy"" is totally subjective, put 'em on the wall or don't, it's up to you."
2740722,CMesserschmidt,2014-04-30 07:23:00,1006,"30"" walleye is still my trophy goal. Biggest is a 28.5"". Biggest I have seen was a 29.5"" my dad caught while sturgeon fishing 2 years ago... It was the biggest for him and he didn't even know he had it on his line until I told him to check his bait haha!As far as smallmouth..... Besides walleye I love to fish smallies. My biggest is a 23"" and have a few 22.5's. If I got a 24"" it would be on the wall as a replica for sure!"
2742777,3M TA3,2014-04-30 15:07:00,2846,"I've caught plenty smallies over 20, a few over 22, and mounted lots and lots in the 12 inch range on the plate. Those are the trophies. Don't think I've ever killed one over 13 inches though."
2661465,prov1800,2014-04-10 07:04:00,5010,"Being a guide in the vermilion bay area allows me to fish a number of lakes in the area and most have great bass populations.have been very fortunate to fish some of them strictly for bass.they all can produce a number of 20""fish.my personal best has been 23 1/2"" and have two of those coming of the western part of lac suel.I know the eastern part of lac suel has them also as I have freinds catching them.another super bass lake that I have been fishing here and there when I get the opportunity is minitaki lake.last fall while I was up there fishing w alleyes we got into huge schools of smallmouth on the humps, with a lot of 18"" fish.right here in vermilion bay on eagle lake also produces some linker smallies as well as cedar and cliff lake.clay lake which is part of the wabigoon river system is also producing huge bass.I feel very fortunate to be able to access these lakes for s mallmouths as well as the other species these lakes have to offer."

2662049,UKBDM,2014-04-10 08:33:00,178,"Smallmouth - 20"" - my 15 year old son caught a 18.5"" football that almost went on the wall. Walleye - 28"" - maybe not a skinny 28"" but definitely one that had a belly. Anything 30"" plus is a lock.Musky - 50""Pike - 42"" or 44"" - toughest decision for me. The heaviest pike I ever caught was 38"".Largemouth - 8# or bigger. Length not important. One of the coolest mounts I ever saw was a stringer of five bluegill 1# plus."
2662145,Fisherman Ted,2014-04-10 08:44:00,461,This is the coolest mount I have ever seen. One guy 2 years ago made this mount of 8 walleye over 30 inches they caught on their trip. I saw it first hand and it easily could be hanging in any Bass Pro/Cabellas etc.
2662193,troutwater,2014-04-10 08:54:00,299,"Thanks for the relplies guys, this is great stuff! My biggest smallie is an 18 1/2, but I caught it in a river in central Illinois so I was thrilled when I got it. Some great points made that body of water is a huge factor."
2662257,vteye,2014-04-10 08:59:00,812,VT blessed with great small mouth water. Excluding Lake Champlain which has great small mouth water I think a 20 is a trophy.
2662553,Aaron-IN,2014-04-10 09:44:00,500,For me it would have to be over 21 inches.
2663865,yoopertrout,2014-04-10 16:38:00,1172,"I like this way of looking at it. Partly because my biggest walleye was 28"" and my biggest smallmouth was 21"" (both out of the same river, and both on muskie lures), but mostly, because the idea of a barrier and a hope makes sense with me."
2664873,Basser,2014-04-10 21:17:00,31,"A 16-18"" bass is a good one, 18-20"" EXCELLENT and 20""+ a trophy."

2659049,troutwater,2014-04-09 17:07:00,299,"Just curious to see what everyone thinks is the size of a trophy small mouth bass. Muskie seems to be 50, and walleye 30, but I've never really heard a mark for smallmouth."
2659097,kzoofisher,2014-04-09 17:15:00,5144,"I'd put it by weight more than length because they seem to stop getting longer but just keep getting fatter, but if I had to pick a length I'd say 22"". 6# in the north, bigger in places like Erie, St. Clair and the Traverse Bay area, 7#."
2659281,bfish,2014-04-09 17:56:00,1096,"TN and VA both recognize 20"" as a trophy for catch and release anglers."
2659329,phishfearme,2014-04-09 18:06:00,1242,"a 30 inch walleye is MUCH more than a ""trophy"" at least by my definition of ""trophy"". is a trophy one in a million? maybe you should define ""trophy"". and it's highly dependent on the lake. for example in PA all of the largest walleye are caught in Lake Erie - a major league trophy elsewhere (say a 27incher) in nothing to get excited about at Erie. same with lac seul versus most other waters in NW Ontario. in any event, I personally think a true 20 inch smallie is a trophy. but again, in Lake Erie a fish of that size is no big deal. phish"
2659609,billy weaver,2014-04-09 18:44:00,470,"In the waters I fish a 20"" smallie is the barrier. A 28"" walleye is the barrier, however a 21"" and a 30"" is the hope."
2660889,rocko0305,2014-04-10 00:25:00,138,Couldn't agree more.
2660921,jimmie,2014-04-10 02:11:00,123,"Depends upon the region of N.America I think. I personally think its purely a sportfish yet so many folks keep them to eat. As far as size goes I too think 20"", could be considered a trophy in most northern bodies of water. As has been stated most usually go more by weight as a 16""/17"" smallie is a good fish by smallie standards. However, in the Lac Seul (Sioux Lookout) region there has been a 25"" smallie caught but most Northern staes MN & WI records are judged by weight over 8 lbs. Ontario the same. There are differences in the seasons that affect fish weight as a 30"" 'eye is suggested to be a 10 lbs specimen. Not always I've seen an 'eye 31"" just make the 10lb mark. I have caught a 20 1/2"" smallie in mid summer yet it weighed 4 lbs 12oz. Usually a 20"" smallie was considered to be at least 5 lbs. Yes it could have benn even more but forage decides more than anything the size of the fishees we hunt for. Musky lore had the record at 69lbs and 15oz which has since been disproved. A possible 75lb example was caught in Lac Seul ajust over a decade ago but all are catch and release soooo.... it may still swim but has likely dies of old age. The MNR has speculated the weight of that fish by measurements and pictures of 67-75 lbs. Years before that a partially decayed musky washed ashore on Lake of the Wood near Kenora and it was speculated at nearly 90lbs??? Again a guesstimate. Regardless have fun hunting those great smallies. Any fish is a good fish even my world record 5"" walleye caught on a trolling Rapala. lol Just have fun"
2661065,jfaisten,2014-04-10 05:20:00,1060,"I think a 5# smallie is a dandy regardless of where you fish. I use a pair of boga grips to weigh the big ones -- boated 1 5#'er in the last 10 years or so. Probably my skill is the barrier -- however, I think people ""guesstimate"" on weights and are often wrong."
2661097,grizzley,2014-04-10 05:31:00,2518,This holds pretty true for our area also.
2661457,bones82,2014-04-10 07:04:00,121,"Agree with this, except I'd say 30"" for walleye. Probably because I've caught several 27"" & 28"" and can't get over the hump. I've caught a 19"" smallie and that was huge. A guy in our group caught a 21 1/4"" smallie. What a pig."
