2714257,jimmie,2014-04-23 12:42:00,123,"Looking for info on where and how to regognize public access to SB Lake just off Hwy 72 heading towards Sioux Lookout, please. The Sioux Lookout area map shows that there is a public launch arount the very NW side of the lake but not sure I can recognize it on Google satellite even magniofied several times. I know the MNR usually has a green and white wooden placard at every other public access just neve noticed one for SB Lake on my wat to Sioux Lookout over the years. In too much of a huury to get up to SL I guess. Thanks for any help, Jim"
2714305,Downrigger,2014-04-23 12:58:00,60,"Jimmie, I spoke with owners last fall to see if they would allow access through their property, and was willing to pay a launch fee. Was told they were the only resort and access on the lake which is a selling point for their guests. Because of that they will not allow even for a fee."
2714353,Downrigger,2014-04-23 13:11:00,60,"Jimmie, name of lake you are referring to is Big Sandy, and resort is Pinecliff."
2714385,BenBeattie,2014-04-23 13:20:00,232,They took the public access out years ago and Pine Cliff is the only boat launch on the lake.
2714441,jimmie,2014-04-23 13:42:00,123,"Yes I have Pinecliff info thank you. TYoo pricy for me though. Just love smallies and heard that it was a great lake for those fun guys. Thanks to all for your help. Its good to know I was not so old yet that I missed the MNR signs. lol !! Thanks again guys it is much appreciated, Jim"

2719161,Walley Guide,2014-04-24 16:06:00,67,Been a few years ago... But we slid a utility boat in the creek right off of 72 and motored out and fished Sandybeach lake. No idea if that is still an option or if it is even allowed these days.... I agree there are a bunch of great fishing lakes in the area. Happy Fishin Walley
2719225,prov1800,2014-04-24 16:18:00,5010,"Yup, still a option.we use that area to unload our sleds, and head to the lake from there, not that far."
2719361,Walley Guide,2014-04-24 16:34:00,67,My folks use to stay at the camp at the south end in the 60's. It's been closed for years. They flew out of there on a few 2/3 day trips. Once that camp closed we used started using the creek to access the lake. Just have to watch the wind... It can really get to rolling. Thanks for posting the info on the creek access..may give it another try one of these days. Walley
