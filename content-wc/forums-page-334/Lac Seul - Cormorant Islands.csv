2718305,WalleyeWally28,2014-04-24 11:28:00,298,"This clearly shows the Cormorants if you zoom in around the Manitoba Pt. area. I've driven past them many times and they are wall to wall with Gulls, Cormorants, Ducks and Pelicans. If you are in the area and still unsure, drive past the two rocks on the downwind side and all doubt will be gone. You will not be able to get close because the odor is horrendous."
2719025,JesterBreeze,2014-04-24 15:25:00,16,"Thanks to everyone on the information! Does not sound like the Cormorant Islands are worth fishing around, but I now know where they are!! Remember going past them last year on the way to Windigo."
2727649,btmbncr,2014-04-26 21:22:00,492,"JesterbreezeIt depends on when you are fishing that area,Cormorant Islands,P.M me for suggestions .Bill"
2714793,JesterBreeze,2014-04-23 15:27:00,16,"Can anyone give me an idea where to find the Cormorant Islands? Several people have mentioned them in their posts, but the paper map I have does not label them. Thanks"
2715025,Carnhzkr,2014-04-23 16:20:00,964,"I believe Cormorant Islands are a small group of rocks sticking up out of the water directly north of Manitoba Point. From MP, you can see some small rock islands covered with white gull crap. That's Cormorant Islands. It's maybe 1/4 mile north of MP."
2715081,teddi,2014-04-23 16:25:00,349,between Manitoba point and ghost narrows. to the west of Manitoba point not north.
2715145,Carnhzkr,2014-04-23 16:39:00,964,"I'm looking at Google Earth. I thought CI was the two small rock piles directly north of MP. Maybe that's not the case. There are two larger, tree-covered islands that are further north. There are no islands east of MP, that's where Altimeter Creek dumps in. If you draw a line from the tip of MP to Ghost Narrows, those islands are about half way up."
2715169,Carnhzkr,2014-04-23 16:45:00,964,Here's a map from Google Earth. Maybe someone can direct you (and me).
2715233,teddi,2014-04-23 17:18:00,349,Go further west.

2716977,Guest,2014-04-24 06:21:00,0,"My map of Lac Seul shows the Cormorant Islands north of Manitoba Point about a mile, just as Carnzkr said. The islands that are midway between Manitoba Point and Ghost Narrows are part of an unnamed reef coming out from west of Altimeter Creek. The Cedar Islands are west of Manitoba Point by about 1.7 miles. My map comes from the Ministry and they are never wrong."
2717065,SinOrSwim,2014-04-24 06:51:00,1528,"That is correct. Basically some rocks sticking out that have a bunch of birds and crap on them. We were told there isn't any reason to fish there. It's dead. There is also a set of rocks down by the south inlet on a map we have called Bird S h i t island. LOL Sure enough, drove by and they are basically white with crap."
