I've been there 22 times, but I have no idea what to do there except for go fishing. Need some help on non fishing things to do, because she doesn't want to fish the whole time. Will probably spend 3 or 4 days fishing in Shoal Lake / Lake of the Woods. But then need other things to do. Like maybe rent a canoe and go canoeing somewhere between Kenora and Vermilion Bay on any of those lakes along the Highway (near Dogtooth etc). Or maybe take the LOTW ferry boat tour... Or maybe go for a sightseeing float plane trip at Northwest Flying in Nestor Falls.Any other suggestions or ideas for somebody who isn't as hooked on fishing? We will go for maybe 10 days to 2 weeks. But I think we may only fish for about 3 or 4 days total. The rest is sightseeing / canoeing / photography / etc.Please share some ideas with me if you can think of more ""family"" oriented things to do.Thanks in advance!""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

Ash Rapids and Crow Rock are a 1/2 hr or so boat ride south of Kenora and allow you to mix an afternoon of fishing with a relaxing meal in a beautiful setting. Otherwise Kenora has some pretty good restaurants. Depending on what time of year, theres blueberry picking too.If your looking for a day trip, Winnipeg is only a couple of hours away and one can easily spend a few hours in an area referred to as The Forks."

2731265,tackleman,2014-04-28 06:19:00,444,"it depends on the time of the summer you'll be up here, each community has events going on and each event is generally scheduled at different times. try looking at the web sites for the local radio stations to see what they have listed. I know the Dryden site is ckdr.net not sure on the kenora site but the station call letters are cjrl"
2731457,Bill Krejca,2014-04-28 07:20:00,6107,Kenora used to offer a several hr (?) tour of the lake on a larger boat. Pretty scenery and info on the area as you cruise along. Bill
2731793,LOW1,2014-04-28 08:32:00,2828,"http://www.lakeescapes.ca/This is a business that organizes canoe/kayak trips in the Lake of the Woods area.http://www.greenadventures.ca/rentals-kayak.html This is another.There is also a business in Kenora which sells a lot of kayaks and may have information about trips, rental equipment, etc.It's called The Hardware Company and its contact info (and other outdoor info about the Kenora area) is here: http://www.kenora.ca/living/be-activ...or-sports.aspxRushing River Provincial Park is a great park to check out and perhaps even camp. They have a brochure available for canoe routes of the LOTW area-I could not find it online but maybe they will send you one. I suggest at least one trip to the farmers market in Kenora, which is on Wednesdays."
