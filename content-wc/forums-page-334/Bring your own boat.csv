The owners are fantastic people, the lodge and cabins are great, price was very good, and there's a tonne of dock space with shore power. It's a 15 min boat ride from the launch (Nestor Falls) to the lodge and it's located in Sabaskong Bay. The area doesn't see as much boat traffic as the north end of the lake, and there were days when we only saw one or two other boats on the water. Scott knows the lake like the back of his hand and can put you on fish immediately. The fishing was fantastic, and in the end that's what matters the most! http://www.lakeofthewoodslodge.com/"
