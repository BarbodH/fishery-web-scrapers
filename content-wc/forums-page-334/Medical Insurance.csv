2740234,roscoe33,2014-04-29 23:18:00,653,"My health ins is through UHC also. I know my bills are covered, eventually, but what about at time of service? From what I have been told, UHC is not accepted in Canada. They will reimburse my expenses after I submit the bills, but how exactly is that going to work if I am in the hospital for a week recovering from surgery, with no way to pay the bill? So, with RoamRights, they take care of the bill over the phone, and the Canadian hospital says all is good and sends you on your way? Have any of you actually made a claim with one of these travel medical policies?"
2740890,polaris-pete,2014-04-30 07:50:00,343,"No we have never had to file a claim but the ID Cards they issue are what you show the Medical people if needed.I had explained in an earlier Post what I was told by a RoamRight Rep.Seems they are the #1 Travel Insurance Company around. She answered any question and concerns I had. If in doubt, call your preferred Company and talk to them directly, this way you will know whats what.I do know that for the $48 for a weeks Medical Coverage with a Million $ Air Evac feature, its a no brainer, especailly on a fly-in and no help around but your Sat Phone."
2741082,LOW1,2014-04-30 08:41:00,2828,"Anyone concerned about this issue may want to contact the hospital(s) and physician group(s) near the area where they will be at in Canada to determine their policy on this issue. Insurance may not be able to directly pay the providers if the provider does not agree to accept direct payment from that company. I once contacted the hospital in Kenora and was told that they would work with my insurance company (BC/BS). Although I am sure that providers would like to be directly paid if possible, they really have no choice other than to work with insurance companies in the event of a large bill. I would suggest that in addition to contacting the hospitals that you find the names and contact numbers of the folks from your insurance company who deal with Canadian claims-this may be a different number than the general customer service number. Call them up and find out what they say about this. And doing something as simple as carrying your insurance card with you would help."
2741441,onetimedave,2014-04-30 09:38:00,502,I asked AARP United Healthcare about medical expenses in Ontario and was told if I am more than 75 miles from a US hospital they will cover it.
2742737,Downrigger,2014-04-30 15:03:00,60,"I did speak with 'accounts payable' with the hospital in Sioux Lookout today. Was told they will not bill your ins. carrier, but want a credit card which they can verify, and then will charge against the card. Then will supply you copies of services rendered together with detailed billing amounts to be given to your carrier for re-imbursement. Am in the process of contacting BC/BS Arkansas to get their side of the process."
2744617,roscoe33,2014-04-30 22:39:00,653,"Ok, went thru insuremytrip, chose Frontier Medex as a carrier, and read all I could.Called them to clarify a few things.They said they work with the hospital/caregiver, and issue a payment guaranty, which frees me of paying for anything but the deductible or copay.They were also very clear that with their policy, if you are in the hospital when the term of the policy expires, that they will continue to pay the bills up until you are discharged from the hospital.The other carrier that I checked out, stated that all coverage ends when the policy term ends.So, for $32.13, I have a little peace of mind that will hopefully ease the payment hassle in an otherwise stressful situation.Thanks for bring this topic up for discussion.And I got a quote for my parents, 78 and 79 years old, no pre-existing conditions, $55 per person."
2735266,roscoe33,2014-04-28 23:08:00,653,"So with the insurance plans above, do they pay the Canadian hospital directly, Or do I have to pay the bill and then they reimburse me? Have any of you ever made a claim with one of these policies?"
2735314,Skyraptor,2014-04-29 04:12:00,291,"My question, how are Canadians treated in US hospitals if they require treatment? Do they have to pay the bill prior to leaving or does their insurance cover or is accepted at the time of the treatment?"
2735586,forgop,2014-04-29 06:31:00,880,"You can walk out of any hospital without paying a dime. What are they going to do? Hold you there until you do? I've seen Medicaid patients argue over a $3 copay at checkout from the ER for a visit that would have easily cost $3-4k after CT scans, x-rays, meds, etc. They just bill you and only recover what you and your insurance company are willing to pay them."
2735978,jfaisten,2014-04-29 07:44:00,1060,useful information -- I had no idea I wasn't covered in Canada.
2736018,woods,2014-04-29 07:50:00,646,"I just used the web site below to buy my insurance for my June fishing trip. Easy to use, but don't know how good it is because I've never had to use it.http://www.insuremytrip.com/"
2736442,dkrusin,2014-04-29 09:04:00,97,"It is true that Medicare does not cover foreign travel. However, some medicare supplement policies do provide some coverage. Plan F for example you would pay 20% after a $250 deductible with a life time maximum of $50,000. This is for emergency care, not a routine office call. As mentioned earlier the Canadian providers will most likely require cash or credit card and you will need to file claim when you return to U.S. Most under 65 policies will cover foreign emergency care as long as the charges do not exceed ""usual and customary"". Charges in Canada and most foreign countries are considerably less then in the States. Best advise is to read your policy and talk to your agent. On a side note..years ago my son fell while climbing a bolder and jammed a stick in his eye. We went to the emergency room in Kenora, they did a great job gave us some drops, said nothing foreign in eye and good to go...$40.00. My wife however was not convinced. Got home took son to our local Doctor for examination. He said everything looked good to him, however he would like a specialist look at it, $60. They looked at him, all good, $200. Not complaining, Healthcare in the U.S. is the best in the world. It just is more expensive and operates total different then anywhere else, at least for now."

2739522,polaris-pete,2014-04-29 19:07:00,343,"I just got a quote from insuremytrip and they are $27 more for the week and the Medical coverage is way less than RoamRights Policy.Medical Evac is up to 1 Million and the only co-pay is if you do a walkin and walk out.They then re-imburse you for this amount. As for Hospital or Emergency room treatment, they send you a card before you go that you show the Hospital and when and if admitted, there are 2 toll free numbers they call to authorize. I talked to a Girl this morning and she was very helpful.She did say they cover pre-existing conditions also."
2732361,micropterus,2014-04-28 10:53:00,450,Do you buy medical insurance coverage when you go to Canada? Medicare does not cover. What policy do you buy?
2732697,Duflebag,2014-04-28 12:13:00,218,"Micro, I learned a lot about health care in Canada last year when i had a serious knee injury while on a fishing trip. I had two ambulances respond, emergency room, doctor, lots of xrays, an imobilizing brace for my knee, crutches and meds. I was treated at the Dryden hospital. Excellent service by the way. When I went to check out i handed over my US Blue Cross Blue Shield card and my international medical insurance card from work. The hospital finance rep said that they do not accept insurance from the US. Their policy was to pay before you leave. I used my visa card to pay that day. I filed an international claim with Blue Cross when I returned and was promptly reimbursed. Real easy, no sweat. Now for the real interesting part. For a whole lot of treatment for a very serious injury I was charged a grand total of $1,004.00 for everything. In the US that would have been $15K to $20K easily. I was very happy with how easy the whole thing was. Hopefully you will never need the medical treatment but if you do it is first class, inexpensive and not a hassle to work with insurance after paying yourself."
2732881,troutwater,2014-04-28 13:12:00,299,"Wow that's amazing. If someone doesn't have the cash readily available I've always wondered what would happen, not let you leave???"
2733433,Golden Eagle,2014-04-28 15:15:00,2642,"Medicare Supplement Policies are available to cover geezers in Canada. Mine has a $500 deductible and coverage of $50,000. I'm thinking that Medicare supplement part F provides coverage in Canada. I also have an Emergency Assistance Plus policy that covers my wife and me for transportation to a medical facility. It has a lot of other valuable coverage at a cost of, I think, of $109 a year. It is available to me as an NRA member. It would be great to have in case I ever need emergency travel from a remote lake in NW Ontario to medical facilities in Winnipeg."
2733537,SinOrSwim,2014-04-28 15:36:00,1528,"THe problem in the US is they ""bill"" you for 15K but they know for a fact they will only get paid about 1K fromt eh insurance. It's all smoke and mirrors so nobody knows the true cost. I'm not sure THEY know the true cost."
2734065,polaris-pete,2014-04-28 17:30:00,343,"We buy a 7 day Policy from RoamRight and is well worth the $53! It gives you peace of mind that all your Medical bills will be taken care of and the 1 great thing in this Policy is the up to $200,000 in MEDIVAC Air Services just in case like we are, way back beyond any roads you will be flown out.I have contacted all my US Medical Providers and none of them cover in Canada.I buy this also for my Yearly Snowmobile trips up North. You are just taking a great chance by not having any insurance when you go."

Luckily we were in town (Sioux Lookout) and not out on a houseboat or remote lodge. I got the ""deer in the headlights look"" when I handed over my insurance card. Total was about $1400 bucks out of pocket for xrays, anetheisia, setting the broken bones, and a Canadian cast. I filed a claim when I got back to the US and all but $100 bucks was reimbursed."
2734674,BuckeyeBill,2014-04-28 19:44:00,76,"Pete, definitely something I should consider. Do you know if it covers pre-existing conditions?"
2734946,polaris-pete,2014-04-28 20:30:00,343,Not sure but they have a website and real people you can actually talk to and get answers.The one we get is for accident and sickness.
