2715841,ftfarms,2014-04-23 19:24:00,444,That's exactly what we do. We call up two weeks before we go and make sure thay have a flat ready for us when we get into Canada. It's usually 7-10 bucks more in Canada but for 10 bucks I don't want to worry about them surviving the long trip or the hassle it could be at the boarder.

2711658,Jimmy Jig,2014-04-22 19:13:00,1905,Frozen minnows are OK to take to Canada. Take both.

2712649,last chance,2014-04-23 06:24:00,3262,a lot of local bait shops will give you a good deal on a flat of 500 worms. but if you cant find someone who will do this you can buy them online at canadiannightcrawlers.com. I think I paid 54.00 last year for 500 nice crawlers with free shipping. I did move my crawlers to a larger container and added more bedding and kept them cool.
2712937,JayM5209,2014-04-23 07:51:00,1050,"Order on line. They'll come to your door the day you want them delivered. Packed in bedding for Canada so you don't have to touch them. Come via UPS, Fedex or Speedy. Just put a fresh ice pack or soda bottle of frozen water in each day.There are a bunch of online sources. Two I've used multiple times with excellent results are:http://www.knutsonlivebait.com/index.htmlhttp://www.vadosbait.com/Depending on your destination you can call ahead to order and pick the crawlers up at Dutchie's in Perrault Falls. They'll be top quality, too."
2713273,Kartman35,2014-04-23 08:45:00,245,Depending on where you're going that may not be true. Many zones in quebec do not allow any minnows.
2714433,MikeinMN,2014-04-23 13:39:00,190,"I see JayM mentioned Vados Bait. That's where we get our nightcrawlers. One of the flats I picked up there had the receipt taped to the top and I asked why. The guy at the store said International Falls customs have checked so many Vados flats they recognize the name, know the bedding is right, and don't need to open them up anymore. I don't know how true that really is, but they have never opened one of ours up to check the bedding. They have certainly had the chance to do so as twice my vehicle and boat were completely unpacked onto the pavement. All the coolers, totes, suitcases, and bags were opened, but not the worms."
2715001,yoopertrout,2014-04-23 16:16:00,1172,Thanks Everyone!
2715097,Carnhzkr,2014-04-23 16:26:00,964,"I've mentioned it in previous posts, but I've found that it's actually cheaper (for me, at least) to buy my flat of crawlers in Canada. I used to always buy in International Falls, before I crossed, but by the time they put the crawlers in bedding and in a cooler, I'm paying about $75, compared to $60 in Fort Frances. I have to supply my own cooler, but this way, I don't have to worry about bringing them through customs."
