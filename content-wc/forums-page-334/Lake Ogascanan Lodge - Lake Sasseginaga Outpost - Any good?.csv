541190,Ohio fisherman,2004-06-27 19:47:00,989,"Does anyone have any information about these two fishing camps? How is the fishing, accomodations, road into the camp, and when should we go? We will be taking our own boat. Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks, O F"
541194,retire55,2004-06-28 07:48:00,1029,"Ohio Fisherman: Our group fished Ogascanan in Sep 2000. Brad and Ginny were great hosts. Unfortunately, bad weather for all four days greatly affected the bite. There were no places to get out of the wind. We stayed at Smith Pass outpost - a comfortable cabin. Roads were fine - about 2 hours 30 minutes from Tee Lake. A search here on Ogascanan this AM provided 31 hits - consequently lots of information available."
541196,Guest,2004-06-28 08:33:00,0,"Retire55 - Thanks for the information. Would you go back? I was wondering if anyone had any info from this year. I will try the search method. Just trying to learn about these places before we make reservations. It seems that places can change dramatically from one year to the next. We used to go to a different hunting/fishing camp every year for about 5 years. The last time we went there we were told that they no longer want hunters or fishermen but instead only eco-tourists! Take care, O F"
541211,Guest,2004-06-28 12:43:00,0,"Ohio Fisherman: My gang of 8 went to Sasseginaga last year in mid-June. The weather did not cooperate well for us, in that, for the week we were there, we had a steady procession of east wind cold fronts that passed thru. Our group are all seasoned, die hard walleye fisherman.....believe me when I say our fishing results were scant, but not from a lack of effort. The accomodations were fine, boats great, beautiful lake with tons of structure. Our host, Wally Mullins, is an absolute gas.....the guy should have his own TV show ala Red Green. Good folks! We really had to work to produce enough walleye for 2 suppers....tried everything in our bag of tricks....they just were not biting well. But those are the breaks, you gotta deal with it when you can't fish but for one good week in God's country. We would all go back again sometime, but NOT in mid-June....the blackflies and skeeters were just fierce....probably wouldn't remember the bugs so well if the fish had been more cooperative. We stayed at Wally's ""remote"" cabin, 1/2 mile or so up the lake from the lodge and cluster of cabins. We jigged, trolled cranks and bounced bottom -w- spinners and crawlers, early, late, in the dark... all kinds of spots and just couldn't get results. Strange too, you'd pick one fish up, get excited thinking ""AH, here we go"".....then nothing else happened. Just single, scattered fish. We had Fishin Buddy fish locaters with us, and showed many fish at times....but no results, we threw the kitchen sink at 'em. But we'll go back again someday to salvage our pride!"
541215,retire55,2004-06-28 15:17:00,1029,"OF: No. I wouldn't go back - primarily for three reasons. One, there weren't many spots to get out of the wind to fish. Two, the camp boats (at least in 2000) were not ideal for such a large lake that can be whipped up by winds. And three, we happen to be more than satisfied with our move to Lake Kipawa (although a much larger body of water, there's all kinds of areas to fish during inclement weather). Please note that 2 out of my 3 reasons have to do with inclement weather. I have read reports from others who have fished Ogascanan and they were quite satisfied. There are many places to fish walleye/trout in that area of Quebec. Many outfitters don't bother doing the big sport shows. You might benefit from a look at http://www.kipawa.com/ I have found that simply doing a google search on a lake name invariably leads to finding outfitter web pages. For instance, take a look at http://www.tenmilelodge.com/ and http://www.clubtroutlake.com/index.html Another area reknown for walleye fishing in Quebec is the Gouin Reservoir. There are 28 outfitters plying their trade there."
541228,Ohio fisherman,2004-06-29 15:14:00,989,"Baxter - sorry to hear about your tough trip. Sounds like just about every trip for me, ha! Glad to hear that even though you had tough conditions, you would go back. You must have found plenty of fish on the sonar! Would you suggest the remote camp or the cluster of cabins? How are the shower and bathroom facilities? The only reason that I ask is because my wife is disabled. Take care, O F"
541229,Ohio fisherman,2004-06-29 15:16:00,989,"Hi Retire55 - Thanks for the details. I would be taking my own boat. Would an 18 footer with 50hp make the lake easier to fish? I will check out your suggestions for the other locations. Are you still happy there? How is the fishing at the new location? Email if you want. [email protected] Thanks, O F"
541231,Guest,2004-06-29 16:05:00,0,"This will be our seventh year going to Ogascanan. As Retire 55 mentioned, the accomodations are good but the lake can be very difficult to fish during windy periods. This lake is definately not a ""fish factory"" like Lac Seul, Gouin, or Lake Erie. Many decent stringers have been caught but this lake makes you use all your fishing expertise to catch them. Just like anywhere else, you have to be in the right place at the right time. After fishing in Lake Erie for the past 20+ years, our group tends to be a little picky when bringing fish back. We are not ""meat"" fisherman so we relish the remote experience of this vacation. As stated, Brad and Ginny are fine hosts and are constantly upgrading their facility. At present, they are in the process of rebuilding numberous cabins at the Main Lodge area. The dirt road is decent but that mostly depends on when it rained last and when they graded it last. It usually takes us about 2 hours to get in via full size van. Some of their customers have been coming back for over 15 years. The boat you mentioned is more that suitable for Ogascanan. Hope this was of some help Another Ohio Fisherman"
541232,Ohio fisherman,2004-06-29 17:03:00,989,"RSM - Thanks for the info. Glad to hear that it is worth going back. When are you going? Do you usually go at the same time each year? If you are looking to fill a spot on your trip, let me know. I am from east central Ohio - where are you from? Yes, Lake Erie can really spoil a person on numbers and size. However, the big lake has not been good to me this year. I too relish the wilderness fishing experience. Just like ice cream, many flavors. Take care, O F"
541254,Ohio fisherman,2004-06-30 13:31:00,989,"Hi Baxter: Thanks for the great information! We always prefer a ""remote"" or isolated cabin for the same reasons that you state. It is even better if we take our two labs. They are great fishing and hunting buddies, but we respect that other people might not be so amused by their antics. That story about the loons is wonderful. It is amazing that when you go on a fishing trip, sometimes the best part is not the fishing. We live in the country but still crave the wilderness. One of the hardest parts about my wife's illness is that we cannot go on our wilderness treks like before. We used to go to Alaska, Maine, and other wilderness destinations. I hope that when you go back you have great fishing. Maybe we can meet up someday. Take care, O F"
541302,Guest,2004-07-02 12:27:00,0,"I also went to Sasseginaga in a group of 8 seasoned walleye fishermen and stayed at Wally's remote camp. Really nice facilities and boats. The lake and area are absolutely beautiful. The lake water is so clear that you could drink it. Therein lies the problem with fishing it. It is so clear that you have only about 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening when fishing is somewhat productive. Other than that the walleyes go deep to get away from the strong light penetration. We did catch a couple of 28"" walleye that we released after measuring, but it was difficult to get enough for meals. It was the first week of September when we were there."

Great hosts, good kids to help and best inbrief anywhere in Canada we have traveled so far. Class operation. Had we taken thier advice and followe dthe brochure, we would have done much better on walleye. When they say 1/8 oz jig and nightcrawlers is all you need, believe them. Bring good jigging equipment, rain gear and rubber boots. Walleyes are tight to the bottom all day. Leave all the other crap home Good laker fishing to 12-16lbs on Canadian 2"" silver wabbler (Canadian Tire) and 18"" of worm harness. double hook and good swivels, or orange tandem steamer fly on 2 -3 colors of 18# lead core line. Going to the other relatives lake this yea close by. We like to do new each year. Would go back John"
1315132,rimfire21,2011-06-06 14:57:00,7,"Howdy. I just returned from Wally Mullen's place at Sasseginaga last night (June 5, 2011). This is my third trip, having been there in June 2003 and June 2005. There were six in the party and we stayed at Outpost Cabin #6 this time as we had done in the past. In a word, the fishing was ""TERRIBLE"". Four of us are experienced fishermen who spend a great deal of time on the water. This past week the 6 of us caught a total of 4 suckers, 6 northern pike, and 8 walleye. None of them were trophies. That is 18 fish for 6 men in 3 boats who averaged better than 8 hours per day on the water. We fished hard! We had all types of different weather and temps, and we fished in the sun, wind, rain, chop, calm, early and late! We threw everything we had at the fish; stick baits, Hot 'n Tots, Rapalas, Husky Jerks, fresh crawlers on Green Mountain Grabber rigs, bottom bouncers, spoons, - you name it. We drifted, we trolled, we sat still. We went so far as to put crawlers on hooks with sinkers below bobbers. It plain sucked!Each of the 3 boats had fish finders that worked and we couldn't find the fish anywhere within a 40 minute boat ride from our cabin. We charted/marked very few groups or schools and very few singles. We noticed that the lake had very few minnows or bait fish around. We found almost no weeds in the lake and we traveled all over looking for the fish. We tried every pikey looking bay without result. We weren't missing bites or strikes either. I had less than 6 bites all week. Believe me, we brought a lot of crawlers home with us! I saw 4 northerns follow my lures, and I had two strikes that I lost the fish on. Pretty darn poor results for over 80+ hours of fishing.I noticed that there were few terns, gulls, or eagles on the lake which leads me to believe that they aren't finding much to eat there.Wally Mullens said, ""The walleye are milkin', and they're sick for a while after that."" Well, I'll tell you. You can catch walleye during the spawn and the fishing doesn't completely shut off for better than a full week like we saw it. Northern pike spawn much earlier than the walleyes and they were't there either. I saw that the lake maps he gave us were copies of the same maps we got on our fisrt trip in 2003 with the same ""hot spots"" marked. We never found that they produced any better than other spots we located on our own back then and I wonder if Wally has actually put a line in the water in a few years.Some other words of advice: Be careful about the amount of gas you use as Wally will charge you $8.00 per gallon for anything you use beyond the advertised 5 gallons per boat. He rounds the gallons and the dollars up. He will ask you if you want him to bring any ice in the middle of the week and it sounds likje a favor, He will then charge you handsomely for the chunks of lake ice he brings you.We found that the cabins were clean and neat and were freshly painted. They had plenty of firewood available and we needed the stove on several nights as the temps were in the low 40's. You will need to bring your own trash bags, toilet paper, and I suggest a stapler and a roll of screen to put on the front door of the cabin as there is no screened door to let air in and keep the many, many mosquitos out. We had trouble with the oven in our cabin and ended up using the outside grill alot, thought the tank we had was 80% empty and we had to boat up the lake to take one from a cabin that wasn't being used. The propane 'frige was venting directly into the camp until we fixed it with a beer can and some hose clamps we had brought. We filtered our drinking water and also brought cases of frozen bottled water to keep our beer coolers cold. The kitchen is well stocked with utensiles and great cast iron skillets to use in the event you actually catch a fish to cook and eat.Nice buildings with old appliances and furniture, good running boats and engines with easy docking, nice views, terrible fishing. (at least this week). It was never terrific fishing in the past but we returned, being optimistic about our chances of the fishing getting better."
1315145,phishfearme,2011-06-06 15:24:00,1242,"i made the mistake of fishing in this region many years ago and after many years in northwestern ontario, i think THE key issue here is the clarity of the water - ie; the FERTILITY of the water. most the lakes we now fish are stained and very fertile and are associated with a major river system. they're fertile with tons of food base and the walleye (and pike) populations are solid. even lakes in other regions of quebec and ontario that are clear (oligotropic lakes) hold poor walleye populations although they may hold wonderful lake trout populations. if you go for walleye, the first thing to ask is the clarity (or fertility) of the lake - try to avoid oligotropic lakes - unless you want the chance to catch lakers also - but don't look for excellent walleye days. i wish someone had told me this 20 years ago. phish"

The fishing is excellent. We ususally go in late May to mid June. This is a very wind driven lake which will make a difference on where you fish. We have always had success with obtaining our limit every year. Naturally we have fished this lake for sometime and do know the areas to fish. Last year we went in mid June. I caught several good size walley, around 4 to 5 lbs, along with two 15 lb Pike. Our choice of bait is leches, also worms & Minnows. When we troll we use a varitey of lures. I will be going late May this year, a little cool but fishing for the big ones always seem to be great.LaterBrian"
2727633,needtofish,2014-04-26 21:14:00,6,"I know this is a fairly old thread, but just wanted to make an addition for my first post. My husband and I have been going there for 12 years and have enjoyed every one. We normally go the second or third week in July. We don't think the fishing may be quite as good or the fish may be harder to find, but after going there for that many years, we do have some of our favorite spots. The Mullens are great people and we also have seen that huge flock of loons. That was a real treat along with a moose swimming Taylor Bay about 5 years ago. The fishing is better some years than others. We don't go there with the idea of boating huge amounts of fish. for us that area is our Heaven on Earth and we enjoy ourselves no matter how many fish we catch. We normally take our own boat in a 16.5 footer with a 40 hp Honda. Handles the lake well if bad weather kicks up. They supposedly did alot of work on the road late last fall, but we will see how the winter treated it. The bottom line is we do enjoy our stay there or we wouldn't go back."
1317544,Guest,2011-06-12 19:53:00,0,"You should probably cool off for a few days before posting a bad report like this, pretty classless. These guys do a lot of work to get gas and provisions in there and have no control over the weather and if the fish are biting or not. You should stay somewhere thats all inclusive and pay upfront a few grand and get all the ice and gas you want. what is it $700 a week per guy for a cabin and boat? Throw in a few extras and its $800 for that location. I have been to that lake four times with mixed results but always managed to put it in perspective if the fishing were slow. We stay at Bush Country."
1441515,Guest,2012-05-28 09:02:00,0,I have fished this lake three times . And have been more than happy with the fishing. The weather is the weather one just has to be prepared. As far as the boats go the are more than sea worthy I have been out in some pretty rough stuff and they peformed fine. I would like 20 hps rather that 15hps but not a hill to die one.Brad and Ginny and the boys are great hosts and have done a lot of work since they took over the Camp. I think if one fishes walley a lot you would know that there are times when they just vanish and don't bite. Plus with all the weird weather the last few years and changes in water this adds to the challanges of cathching fish. I would recomend this camp to any one and have. When people come in to BPS in Toronto and ask me if I know any good places to take a vacation and have a little adventure and cathch some fish I alway mention Ogascanan and the Kipiwa area in general> DK Toronto
1874882,Guest,2013-06-17 17:08:00,0,You didn't stay with or use the same outfitter and you seem to believe that any reports with some negativity should not be posted. I don't believe that helps people who are seeking an honest opinion about a place before they send off a deposit. Most fishermen who are preparing to spend $700.00 bucks or more are interested in knowing what they getting into but you appear to be OK with letting folks get gouged if that's what happens. The fishing can't be controlled by the outfitter but safety and maintenance should be. A propane refridgerator venting into a sleeping area? Both a non working stove or a grill for a week? Wish you were there to cook for us.
1879673,Jaskonie,2013-06-19 07:27:00,80,I can't cook for you if you cant bring in any fish!
541239,Guest,2004-06-30 05:48:00,0,"OF- I highly recommend the remote cabin, just for the sake of having a place to yourself. For my group, it's perfect. We don't want to be a bother to anyone else should one of the guys get a little too loud....and we don't want to be kept up at night by somebody next door being a little too loud either. After all, it's a vacation, and people do tend to unwind. The shower and toilet at the remote camp are of the ""camp"" variety....small enclosed room -w- a flush toilet, small shower stall, certainly more than adequate for most folks. Not wheel chair friendly however. The path from the camp to the water is just that...a path....rocky, narrow, but not a long walk. Good to hear that your wife will consider a trip to the boonies! I don't rely heavily on fish finders.....in fact, sometimes I think that the manufacturers program in some fish every 20 minutes or so, whether they're there or not! Sasseginaga was such a beautiful spot...there's no way we could get shut down 2 times in a row (grin!). After fishing from sun-up till 9 or so one morning, we were kicking back after a huge breakfast...it was drizzling rain, when we heard this tremendous racket coming off the lake. We all went outside to see what it was. Coming down the lake towards us was this raft of loons....45 by count....all hootin and hollerin and carryin on....never have any of us seen that many loons together at one time. They passed by the camp, only 40 yards off shore, raisin ####, with 8 guys standing there with our mouths hanging open....we had a camcorder and filmed it all.....that alone was worth the price of admission. Often thought that there was some kinda message there, from one group of fisherman to another....."
