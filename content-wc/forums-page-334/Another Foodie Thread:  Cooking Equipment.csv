2700722,LOW1,2014-04-20 07:16:00,2828,I am enjoying all of the recent posts re cooking. Here's another: What cooking equipmnet do you bring with you? Personally I am not going anywhere without a big Lodge cast iron skillet and a garlic press.
2700858,bigwalleye1,2014-04-20 07:37:00,2632,"Aside from my dutch oven and cast iron chicken fryer and lid in my shore lunch box, I tend to bring things like tongs, spatulas, basting brushes, grill brushes, and things I expect to be more usable than some of the stuff in the cabin."
2700986,port1042,2014-04-20 08:05:00,509,"We stay at a drive-in camp, with electric, so I always bring an electric fry pan. We have fish at least 5 times in a week and that pan gets a work out -- and it's easy to clean. Works great for pancakes, french toast, and eggs too. Counting on decent cookware at the cabin is dangerous!"
2701610,oleJoe,2014-04-20 10:05:00,114,"We do a fly-in so we always take a spare spatula, big spoon, knife sharpener, tongs and a spare filet knife for the kitchen. That's along with a roll of duck tape and rope an a toaster for good measure. We have used most of those things over the years. Oh a can opener for sure! We did a drive-in and the only opener they had for the cabin was a c-ration opener! The more mature gentlemen in here will remember those. You never quit learning on these trips LOL"
2702002,roscoe33,2014-04-20 12:24:00,653,"We used to camp a lot, so are used to taking plenty. Have narrowed it down a bit since we switched to drive-in cabins, but we still take the basics so as not to be without. Part of what we take is a large quality fry pan, cutting board, small strainer, and a french press coffee maker. 2 scoops of grounds and 8 ounces of water, and look out world, here I come. You guys can have your camp coffee and/or aluminum percolator coffee."
2702178,JayM5209,2014-04-20 13:57:00,1050,"Since retiring eight years ago I do two or three trips per year to Ontario, and one is always with five other guys to a drive-in camp. Another person and I were part of the original group 36 years ago. Two of the food related traditions that have evolved over the years are pies baked in camp and Wednesday evening all you can eat walleye chowder. So . . . I always need to take several pie pans plus the ingredients for 4 or 5 pies (usually apple, cherry, pecan, key lime). One of the smartest things I've done was to acquire a proper pot to make the Wednesday chowder. After too, too many years of the agony of trying to make it in a thin walled aluminum stock pot (read: burn the bottom and cold on top) I watched eBay one winter until I found an old Wagnerware Magnalite Dutch oven at a reasonable price - not the normal sized model but the big, oval, use two burners one. It is always on the Must Have/Most Critical packing list! The chowder has never been better! Always take a big soup ladle, too.Incidentally, the camp this group always goes to has very well equipped kitchens, including 3 or 4 well seasoned cast iron skillets per cabin. If I'm solo or just cooking for one other person, I can make do just fine with about anything, but when doing most of the cooking for a group of six the absence of enough good cast iron cookware is pretty much a guarantee we won't be back."
2702274,MikeinMN,2014-04-20 14:29:00,190,"Since our group drives in we tend to pack a little heavy. I take a turkey fryer we use to fry fish, fries, onion rings, and tater tots. I also bring a discada for breakfast dishes and general utility cooking. Some meat, a few vegetables, and some store bought bottled sauce cooked in the disc makes a fast and very tasty stir fry. My discada fits right on the turkey fryer base/burner. If you don't know what a discada is check southwestdisc.com, that's where I got mine but many places sell them. These are heavy big items that would never make a fly in, but are fun and useful for a drive in."
2702498,Bill Krejca,2014-04-20 16:09:00,6107,"Going to drive-ins - 2 cast iron frying pans, 1 light weight lid, 2 pliers/scissors type short tongs, frying thermometer, a large spoon for pouring pancake batter, etc, knife sharpener, a variety of smaller sharp knives, juice pitcher, can opener, plastic bags- both zip lock and garbage. These are items that should already be in the cabin, but sometimes aren't, depending on where I'm at. Bill"
2703298,@Lunker,2014-04-20 20:08:00,835,"Maybe inherent but seems worth mentioning specifically - a good, sharp, quality kitchen knife."
2703490,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-20 21:12:00,1460,"I gotta admit, my outfitter kinda sucks at keeping kitchen pots and pans etc. up to date whatsoever. I finally talked with our pilot last year about the condition of the flat cookie sheets. Seemed to me it fell on deaf ears. I plan on bringing up a couple this year. Last year, I brought up a big plastic bowl as the year before we immediately noticed it was a goner. Came in real handy. In past years, I've donated a couple of tupperware marinators and 2 steak platters. We've done a lot of MacGyver make do's in the kitchen in the past and if I can avoid these problems by donating a few things, I will."
