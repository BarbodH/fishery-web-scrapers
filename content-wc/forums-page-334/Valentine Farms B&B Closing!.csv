I have been there a few times over the Years while on Snowmobile trips.I decided that this would be a nice place to stay the nite before we fly into our Lake.I booked over 3 Months ago and she called me to tell me they are CLOSING and hopefully re-open in a year or so. No idea of why but its to bad as it is a beautiful place to stay.Just a heads up to anyone going to Chapleau and wanted to stay there. We booked at another place so we are good to go.She did tell me that it was SNOWING at the time of the phone call!!"
