Staying at a friends close to there this summer and wondered if there was a place to launch my boat. Any other walleye related info regarding Rugby would be appreciated. Thanks !!!"
2717953,Skywagon,2014-04-24 10:02:00,1106,"I have flown into rugby before to visit with friends that were camping there. From what I understand, the only way in is to pay a launching fee at the camp."
2719193,bigwillies,2014-04-24 16:11:00,515,skywagon is right. only acess is through the camp.also i hear they can be difficult to deal with.
2719529,Fishingfinn,2014-04-24 17:00:00,30,"There are a lot better lakes in the area for walleye fishing than Rugby. If you can, make the trek up to Lac Seul. It's well worth the extra drive!!"
2719649,115 optimax,2014-04-24 17:52:00,650,We tried to pay a landing fee there and they told us the ramp was for guests of the lodge only.The old owners use to let us pay and launch.
