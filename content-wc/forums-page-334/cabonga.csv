The people in charge of the water level on the Cabonga, drew the water down to far and the fishing suffered as a result. I always fished Lac Barrier which is close to the Cabonga , had better luck fishing the Lac Barrier, rather than the cabonga itself.Just be carefull if you park your vehical there along the dirt road , the Indians like american toys.Just a reminder , the indians are not as you would think , lets just say, they are not honest people."
