2699754,Clayton69,2014-04-19 20:09:00,80,"That's a great clip...and an awesome looking GSP! It's funny how similar their traits are. When mine's swimming circles around the boat, he tries to retrieve the lure every time I make a cast and I have to call him off. I do a lot of shore camping and when we're not in the boat he will spend every waking minute standing in the water as far out as he can get looking into deep water. He literally never stops looking for fish. Even in the house...(pic 1) I can't tell you how many times he's stalked the fish in the tank. I made a comment in an earlier post about not being able to make it out of the driveway with the boat attached without him. Was getting ready one morning loading and hooking up...didn't see the dog anywhere...couldn't hear him barking or whining...followed the lead and this is where I found him...(pic 2)...no way I was leaving without him!! Dogs...you've got to love them!!"

2412473,mctbone,2014-02-02 16:59:00,26,"My wife and I have brought our 2 springer spaniels with us fishing every year for the last 12 years (that's how old they are) and we typically take them out in the boat all day. We always keep them in life jackets because they will jump out after the loons if we're not careful and it's much easier to get them back in the boat with the handles. It's much easier to do with drive-in resorts and larger 17-18 foot flat bottom boats, but we've also had them out with us in 14 ft fly-in outpost boats a number of times. We are somewhat limited in where we can go on a drive-in resort (Witch Bay on Lake of the Woods is especially dog friendly), but we've only found one fly-in outfitter so far that would not allow dogs (Nestor Falls) - however they do count towards your weight limit. Never had a problem with hooks in the dogs, but we are careful about keeping lures stowed when not in use. As for the heat, we let them out for a swim if they look to be getting too hot. We love having them along and many resorts understand that."
2612010,AsianAngler,2014-03-29 16:00:00,67,"My husband and I spent most years fishing with one or more Weimaraners. It does take some planning and some training. Since we didn't have our own boat at the time, we would bring shade cloth, bungies and clips to cover the bow of the boat. If it got too hot, they would escape under there. You can also buy cool coats, cool collars, and cool beds to help with the heat. Believe it or not, there are also sun screens made for dogs. We were always worried about skin cancer and damaging the eyes. I would not take any short-nosed breed out for a full day in the heat. They are much more susceptible to heat stroke. Bring something to put water in as they will drink a lot. I also bought hook covers. Basically, little square of nylon with velcro on the sides. When you are rigged up but not fishing, the covers went on. Never had a hook in a dog in over 20 years of fishing. If you decide to use life preservers, try to find those that cover as little of the body as possible... also adds to the heat factor. I have attached some pics of our fishing buddies over the years. Enjoy!"
2649081,bubblehead,2014-04-07 14:16:00,18,My Weimaraner loves the boat. She's our Walleye pointer. Only problem is she can't seem to steer a straight line while trolling.

2651057,Clayton69,2014-04-07 20:37:00,80,"I would never make it out of the driveway with the boat attached if he wasn't in the truck. If I even touch the boat keys, start loading gear, or even mention the word 'boat' all **** breaks loose with my shorthair. The boat is definitely his favorite place to be. Once in the boat he's very well behaved until I set the hook, say 'fish on', or if he hears drag being pulled out...then he tries to get as close as he can until the fish is out of the water. And if he knows there's fish in the livewell, he'll spend hours guarding the lid so none escape. On hot days he'll help himself to a swim to cool off. It's also the main reason I added a swim platform and ladder to the boat. As for the lodges, it can be difficult to find ones that accept dogs, and often there is a daily surcharge. We went to Lake of the Woods Lodge last year and they are happy to have your four legged friends in camp. It's well worth the added expense in my humble opinion. I'm sure he appreciates the fishing trips as much, if not more, than I do! And that's really saying something. Wouldn't go without him."
2651153,Mike Borger,2014-04-07 21:02:00,1554,Beautiful dog! I have a 31/2 year GSP and she's terrible in the boat LOL!Very envious.
2655001,jds22,2014-04-08 19:28:00,9,I can't get into the boat without the Pooch. Honestly couldn't imagine him not coming fishing. From a pup he's been amazing in the boat. Always makes sure to kiss the fish goodbye! Jordan
2655513,Clayton69,2014-04-08 21:13:00,80,"Thanks...he's just turned 7 and still acts like a two year old. They are a great breed aren't they! The only complaint I have when he's in the boat is the pacing that happens if I don't catch any fish for awhile. He'll run from bow to stern staring into the water looking to spot some for me. Kind of chips away at the confidence when the dog feels the need to put me on fish...LOL! I'm not sure who's suffering from the winter blues more. I was at BassPro (allows dogs in the store...awesome) with him a few weeks ago picking up supplies and getting my pre season fix in. I went over to the boat section to have a look...as I leaned in to look at the interior of one I heard something beside me...looked left and he had climbed up on to the wheel well, had one paw hooked over the gunwale trying to climb on board! As I tried to walk away the whining and 'puppy' barking began until we got out of sight of the boats! Too funny!!"
2655985,Mike Borger,2014-04-09 06:15:00,1554,"That's hilarious! I posted this earlier, but here's a short clip of me steelhead fishing with my dog.Earlier she was swimming out to where I was wading, circle me like a shark, then she'd swim out to grab my float every time I tried to cast.

In general she's the greatest dog ever but I've tried and I can't bring her fishing.In this clip I'm steelhead fishing in late November landing a fish. She always tried to attack the fish when I reel them in. Right at the end of the clip she paws my trout LOL!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfeSt225x-QHere's a short clip of me, my son, my buddy and my dog fishing up at my camp in Quebec. Earlier my young son was bragging that he was the best fisherman in the boat (kind of funny). Beyond that you can hear the dog whining non stop. She's BRUTAL in the boat LOL! Non stop whining and constantly jumping all over the place.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU893uTcsogMy hope is that eventually she'll settle down, and as she gets older I'll probably try again. Right now though she's banned from any fishing trips HAHA!"
2379929,Guest,2014-01-24 07:17:00,0,"Hi , we take our dog fishing ( gascon bluetick) he is 100 lbs of excitement when we catch something other than that he sleeps the day away. As a camp owner we don't mind people bringing dogs, take a blanket in the boat, clean up after him but please don't leave him alone in cabin."
2379961,BornToFish,2014-01-24 07:25:00,1224,"First of all, I think it's great that you consider taking your fishing buddy with you to Canada! Many folks gave excellent feedback to your posting. I encourage you to check with Canadian and US Customs agents before you leave on your trip. There might be regulations regarding crossing the border (both ways) with pets that you will want to know about before your trip. For example. I'm referring to paperwork from your pet's veterinarian. It surely would be disappointing to travel all the way to the border and not be allowed to cross simply because you don't have proof of something (e.g. good health, vaccinations or whatever). I recall good friends traveling to Canada with their dog a few years ago that were not allowed to take dog food across the border. This became a problem as they couldn't find the dog's preferred brand of dog food. Apparently the dog had allergies to many common brands of dog food. Be sure to do your homework in terms of lodges that accept dogs. The lodge that I fish from does not allow guests to bring dogs. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2380017,Lovetofish,2014-01-24 07:31:00,458,Does she like to do that too?
2381777,Catman59,2014-01-24 16:00:00,345,"The only paperwork needed is a current rabies certificate. I take everything along as far as records for the dog, but have never had to show anything but the rabies cert. I have never been questioned on the kind of dog food that I have along , but I guess different agents ask different questions. Our camp welcomes pets and enjoys my Golden as much as we do."
2381921,Mike Kansas,2014-01-24 16:46:00,1463,"Bill, Are these the two friends that you buy permits for so you can bring 12 Walleyes a day back to camp? Mike Kansas"

2377881,Carnhzkr,2014-01-23 14:40:00,964,"I'd imagine this has been discussed before, but in the interest of starting some new discussion, how many of you take your dogs with you on your Canadian fishing trips? I don't do it now, but someday when I have my own boat, I'd love to find a lodge that allows dogs so I can fish with my buddy. Whenever I mention this to my wife, even though she loves our Vizsla as much I do, she tells me it wouldn't work. She says dogs can't spend the whole day in the boat, they might step on a hook, get too hot, be a pain in the azz, blah, blah, and blah. I tell her lots of people take their dogs with them. Who can back me up on this?"
2377921,dutchboy,2014-01-23 14:52:00,5717,"I always had mine with before having to put her down. She loved the boat. However, it was a smaller breed (bigger then a ankle biter) and could climb under the console to escape the sun. I would stop from time to time and let her off the boat for a few minutes. That said I never took her to Canada. I don't think I would take a dog to a Canadian camp. Seems I could manage a week or so without the dog. I think you should consider the other guests also, some people actually go to Canada to escape there neighbors and their dogs."
2377961,MrSimon,2014-01-23 14:57:00,922,"If its a fishing dog that has grown up on boats and is used to hours on end on the water (and in the car) .... then by all means take them along! I find that most lodge guests are thrilled to have a well mannered fishing dog in camp. If you've never fished with your dog, but want to try it out .... a lodge in Canada is not the place."
2378001,Lovetofish,2014-01-23 15:14:00,458,She could never make the 14 hour drive up and back with her head out the window.
2378089,Carnhzkr,2014-01-23 15:30:00,964,You talking about my wife?
2378113,Carnhzkr,2014-01-23 15:34:00,964,"They might be locals, but it seems that I always see several people fishing with dogs in their boats. Last year, I saw a guy with an Irish Wolfhound fishing off the twin islands off of Manitoba Point in LS. Now that's a big dog."
2378137,IaDave,2014-01-23 15:41:00,476,I have taken my 2 Goldens probably 5 or 6 times and always try to when I make solo trips. I have kind of narrowed down to 2 camps that allow dogs which 1 is on an island and the other allows them to be in the cabin. I normally take them all day unless it is going to rain or it is warm and sunny. They do well in the boat until I catch a fish- the male always needs to lick the fish before I throw it back. I would post some pictures but haven't taken the time to figure out how to. One of them probably has 1 more trip in him so I'm going to try again this year.
