2705810,Aaron-IN,2014-04-21 15:12:00,500,Does it come in Kokanee flavor?
2706226,Skywagon,2014-04-21 17:08:00,1106,"Then the broken seal thing... Who is brave enough to bring my scotch across, Walleye Dave? I could sacrifice a shot out of every bottle if anyone is interested. Then I am also thinking Pooch, he could put it in his live well and nobody would ever know...of course Golden Eagle has a lot of experience. and that southern charm... So many choices. Step right up, I have a deal for you, who needs powdered booze."
2708746,Simple Man,2014-04-22 07:32:00,92,"Man, sounds like desperate times. We dont fly-in so I cant speak to what you guys have to go through in your planning/packing process. We boated in last year and the boats looked like floating LBCO barges....LOL. Powdered Alcohol sounds disgusting but I suppose I would try it if desperate enough for something that resembles a beer. I will stick with real beer, bourbon and hooch for our group. We ran out of beer last year and had to boat over to the main lodge from our outpost to buy cases of warm Labatts Blue Light in the cans and I gotta tell you, my guess is the powdered alcohol tastes better than that stuff did. LMAO!"
2708826,ftfarms,2014-04-22 07:47:00,444,Powdered alcohol was not approved by the Feds so problly will not be for sale this year. Maybe next year thay have too do more studies on it.
2708978,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-22 08:16:00,1460,"Dang, and I was planning on spiking the Chowder this year."
2719353,bigwillies,2014-04-24 16:34:00,515,powdered alchohol! pass the straw
2697810,Noel,2014-04-19 09:13:00,115,"Anyone hear about this? Its powdered alcohol which should be available fall of 2014. Yes, college students will abuse it but I thought it would be great for us fishermen to use in Canada. Those fly-ins have such tough weight restrictions so how about taking some powdered alcohol along and save weight. Cut down on those cases of beer that weigh so much. This should help. Until the Canadian gov. figures it out and passes restrictions on it. I can see the conversation at the border right now- ""do you have any alcohol or cigarettes along""? Yes sir- a case of powdered alcohol. ""What""?? Since alcohol crossing the border is restricted by volume powdered should be no problem. Also should be good for canoe trips into the boundary waters. Check this link below. It will be called PALCOHOL.http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/...ame-day-better"
2698082,phishfearme,2014-04-19 11:00:00,1242,I bought some powdered water but can't figure out what to add to it.
2698266,wallydave,2014-04-19 13:09:00,2151,Mix with your favorite adult beverage!
2700274,roscoe33,2014-04-20 02:26:00,653,"From what little info that is available on this stuff, it appears it will take more than a teaspoon full to make a drink, substantially more.And no one is saying it will be cheap.I'll stick to whisky, and its 10% the weight of beer."
2700394,zeebee,2014-04-20 05:32:00,1144,On vacation?.......single malt. I used to be a bass fisherman until I discovered scotch. I could sell you dehydrated water....add just one granule to 8 ozs of H20 and voila!
2700514,Skywagon,2014-04-20 06:40:00,1106,"Zeebee, Let me make you sick. I am in the US right now, bought a case of 750 ML bottles of my favorite blended scotch (that was on sale) yesterday for $19.99 a bottle. Now to figure out how to get it back without paying duty...."
2700674,octanehi5,2014-04-20 07:04:00,1104,I will keep mine in liquid form Thanks
2700682,Mike Borger,2014-04-20 07:04:00,1554,"An entire case would be a tough, but if it's a bottle or two simply crack them open and drink a shot.As long as it's purchased for ""personal consumption"" there's no duty or taxes, even if it's less than a 24 hour trip."
2704026,tv4fish,2014-04-21 07:08:00,2694,"But - But UNLESS it's ""Windsor Canadian"" --- who cares ??"
2704746,SinOrSwim,2014-04-21 11:01:00,1528,"Wait, so if we cross the border and don't want to pay duty on the booze, we can crack them open, drink some and it's not taxed? Obviously can't do that with the beer but we could easily take open bottles of vodka etc."
