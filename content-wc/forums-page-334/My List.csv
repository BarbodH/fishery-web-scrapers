2693226,Simple Man,2014-04-18 07:07:00,92,"Great lists fellas. We have ours down to a science now as well. We eat like kings on our trip! Its the only time of the year that I can have all the bacon, butter and deep friied goodies I can eat and washed down with beers before 8am without a house full of women griping at me about the health affects! LOL.... Cant wait to get up there....only 74 days until paradise!!!!!!"
2693298,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-18 07:26:00,1460,So very well said! I'm waking up to just 44 days! Pressure's on.
2693386,Simple Man,2014-04-18 07:37:00,92,"I'll keep my fingers crossed on the weather for you....I am sure it will be fine but this winter has been brutal. Good luck and I look forward to hearing your reports....on the food....and the fishing, but mainly the food! LOL. Safe travels!"
2693458,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-18 07:51:00,1460,"Hey Roscoe, love the jiminy Christmas reference, hilarious, but alas we are only there for a week. We will eat fish every day, mainly lunch meals. We definitely eat our fill of walleye, but we do it our way. As far as my bun to brat ratio...........We call it roughing it."
2695018,jimirjr,2014-04-18 14:25:00,1149,"One of these DAYS, I'LL be there!! Best part of these columns, is... THE GREAT IDEAS I get for Our Fall HB trip.... They already begged Me to make your Walleye Chowder... I'm gonna do the Linguini Thing, this year, too! I'll be thinkin of you guys when I'm up in the ""windswept plains"" of WYO...."
2697658,Swamp_Donkey_Slayer,2014-04-19 08:22:00,42,"One year we rolled into camp after some Iowa hog farmers. As we were walking in they said hey we had some extra bacon we left it in the freezer for you. Awesome. Well we opened up the freezer and found that ""some""bacon was 15 lbs and this was to be added to our 8 lbs we brought. We had roughly a lb of bacon per person per day.....heaven. We had bacon in, on and wrapped around everything we ate. Since then we have had a serious bacon per man per day ratio but it has dropped to 1/2 - 3/4 lb. I think back to those 4 guys often and think...what was their planned ratio...2lb?"
2697826,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-19 09:14:00,1460,"Great story! Impressive bacon consumption you guys on Donald go with. There is nothing better than inheriting a bonanza from the prior group in fishcamp. I especially like it when they leave minnows or leeches to supplement our supply. One year, a group left a batch of salted minnows in the freezer for us. My nephew, who was about 13 or 14 at the time, decided on his own to utilize this succulent concoction the best way he knew how. I tell you what, nothing quite stinks up a cabin than an appetizer made with salted minnow on a triscuit with a slice of sharp cheddar cooked under the broiler."
2726601,labsrus,2014-04-26 14:55:00,557,"I really enjoy looking at other people ideas We keep a good list of our food and gear each trip, every year we seem to add or remove items. I like to look at comments from the last few trips to see what worked and what did not. All this stuff helps make the time pass faster Looking forward tot he next fish"
2726777,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-26 15:55:00,1460,"Yeah, took a bit of a learning curve to realize that just getting what's on the list to camp isn't enough. I needed to bring the list, to fine tune it, while fresh in my Labatts drenched mind. Lol"
2690922,Lovetofish,2014-04-17 14:36:00,458,North Albany is a drive-in camp.
2690954,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-17 14:46:00,1460,"Looks way legit! Probably the closest drive-in to Wabakimi, other than Forrest Lodge on Caribou. Another for the ole bucket list. Thanks"
2691114,Ranger319,2014-04-17 15:24:00,166,Skimping a little on the bacon!
2691202,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-17 15:55:00,1460,"Oh no, not enough bacon for the Chowder! .................................................. .........recalculating............................ ............................. .................................................. ........................................ .........."
2691314,lassh,2014-04-17 16:25:00,553,"I still see Crisco sticks on your list so you have yet to get the lard out! Do you fly in with Mike or with Rusty Meyers? I've always wanted to go to Wabikimi. Lots of water and varied habitat. We have a similar list except the non-fish meals are steaks, brats, and spaghetti. We have walleye several different ways- deep-fried, pan fried, sautéed, grilled and fish tacos. It looks like you have some makings for fish tacos, do you whip them up? I see you bring pasta up for several starch dishes. We also bring up dehydrated hash browns in a pint sized milk carton type container. I get them at costco. You just add hot water to rehydrate, then cook them the way you want. They are very good and you can fly in about 12 more beers or the makings for Bloody Marys. We do bring a few taters just to clean up the frying oil. How many are in your group?"
2691466,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-17 16:57:00,1460,"Hey Lassh, we fly with Vic Davis of Northern Wilderness Outfitters. Is Mike the owner of Pipestone? We still keep bringing the crisco for shore lunches. Just easier than screwing with the peanut oil. Walleye tacos are done pretty much exactly how SinorSwim/Hawkfan/Morgonman's recipe is. Spectacular! Use the pasta for Fettucine Alfredo with the Bacon/Blue Cheese Burgers and the linguine is for the Buffalo Walleye with Blue Cheese Linguine lunch time meal. I have used the dehydrated hash browns from Cosco as you described. Dice a couple onions there and cook em in bacon grease and you got something der. Lassh, I remember you on the Wabakimi thread. I can't recommend this lake highly enough. If ya ever get the chance to go, all the camps on the lake are superb. The lake is like none other. There are usually 8 in my group, thus the 8 of Pikeslayer8."
2692026,lassh,2014-04-17 19:43:00,553,Yes. Its Mike Henry of PFO. He flies out of Clearwater Lake near Emo. He used to own a camp on Pipestone Lake. I did have a trip lined up to Wabakimi years ago in September timeframe with PFO but half my group lost their jobs when their company went belly up and backed out--I had made the mistake of putting up the deposit myself and lost the whole thing. One guy did end up paying his share. Lesson learned. But the biggest thing was that I lost the opportunity to fish Wabakimi. Fortunately I did have a Canada fix earlier that year so the fall trip was going to be the cherry topping the whipped cream. Hope you have a great trip!
2692562,btyreprich,2014-04-17 21:36:00,1067,Pikeslayer8: Pretty detailed list - thanks for sharing it. Just wondering why the need to buy so many items in Canada when a good portion of the list was purchased in the US. Are the items you buy in Canada cheaper or perhaps there are a few favorite brands available at that store? Thanks again for the list
2692610,Pikeslayer8,2014-04-17 21:57:00,1460,"It's a long trip from Colorado so I just bring the frozen stuff in the coolers and the dry goods in totes. I try to buy just the perishables at the border so I don't have such a big window to crush the bread or crack the eggs. Lol I do prefer Canadian coffee and have fond memories of when my Dad bought the boat candy there when I was little so I keep on that little tradition. I have a lot of memories border shopping, some good and some not so much. There were times where my Dad would be so driven to get it over with that he would get a bit overbearing. Last year was fun as the checkout guy remembered me from years prior and we had a nice friendly chat."
2692754,roscoe33,2014-04-18 00:04:00,653,"Jiminy Christmas, are you going for a month?Do you plan on eating any fish?FYI, your brat to bun ratio is off."
2690402,SinOrSwim,2014-04-17 13:11:00,1528,That is a list. It's almost like your a chef Slayer!!!!
2690458,Lovetofish,2014-04-17 13:21:00,458,Can I come along? I know how to do dishes and catch/clean fish.

The kitchen work is pretty well divided up. My brother and I are co-chefs and we make my nephews and my boys do most of the grunt labor so we make sure our drinks stay full.

Many Swisher sweets as well. Usually have eggs one morning and sandwiches at lunch. Lately we have been taking our big meal early in the afternoon, seems like fishing is slowest then.Fish On Brother!"
