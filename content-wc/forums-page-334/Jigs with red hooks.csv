2731377,BornToFish,2014-04-28 06:52:00,1224,"Hello Needtofish,I can sympathize with your and your husband's dilemma of having paint falling off the jigs. I've been there and done that. I've made thousands of jigs for myself and my partners over the last fifteen years. I hope that I've encountered all the various issues that might come up when making or painting jigs.I've encountered the problem of paint flaking off the jigs before. I solved this issue in two ways. First, I coated the already painted jigs by sealing the paint with a lacquer. I simply dipped the painted jig into the lacquer, hung it on a string to dry and then punched out the eye of the hook so it would be open to tie the fishing line. This step made the finished jigs look shiny. I believe that I purchased the clear lacquer from the same company described below (CS Coatings).The second way I solved that problem was to dispose of the paints that were flaking off. I didn't like the extra time/expense of applying a lacquer to the painted jigs.I've been using lure and jig paints from CS Coatings. Their website is www.csipaint.com. I mostly buy the paint in one ounce bottles. As above, I hold the jig by the hook with a needle nose pliers and dip it into the well-stirred paint, remove excess paint by touching the painted jig to the rim of the bottle, hang it on a string to dry and then scrape off the paint from the eye of the hook. They describe the paint as being ""the toughest finish ever put on a lure"". I have to agree as I haven't had it fail yet. Do yourself a favor and do the work outside on a pleasant afternoon to minimize the smell in the house. I buy this paint at most any fishing store in NE Wisconsin. If you go this route, I suggest that you pick up a bottle of their solvent to thin the paint when using it. The paint's solvent evaporates, leaving a thicker sludge in the bottle. Simply add a few drops of solvent from time to time to keep it the right consistency.I've been using more dry powder paints than anything of late. There is a bit of technique to painting jigs with powder paints. I will give a brief description. Hold the jig with a hemostat and heat the jig for a fleeting instant in the flame of a torch. Don't directly heat the region around the eye of the hook. Drag the heated jig across the surface of the ""fluffed up"" powder paint, taking care to not get powder on the eye of the hook. This step involves a simple flick of the wrist. Don't plunge the jig into the powder! Clean off the eye of the hooks and then ""cure"" the paint by heating the jigs in an oven. My experience is that the cured paint is bomb-proof. Powder painting is very quick and simple once the technique is acquired. Keys are heating the jig just enough (melts the powder paint) but not too much (melts the lead jig) and acquiring the flick of the wrist technique to apply the paint to the jig.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I have always used jigs with red hooks and this past weekend after spending 100 bucks on our favorite jigs, I started to take the wrapping/bar code off the hooks (pain in the behind, not sure why they started doing that.....safety??) and noticed they were the ""plain"" hooks not the red ones. Probably no difference, but didn't like it. I guess superstitious or something. Is there any difference? Stronger? Or am I just a dumb $&@"
2687641,BornToFish,2014-04-16 21:18:00,1224,"I have considerable experience fishing with jigs in NW Ontario. I make my own jigs and have painted them with every color that can be imagined, in addition to unpainted. I have used Aberdeen, bronze and red hooks. I sincerely believe that color (jig and hook) doesn't make a difference most (but not all!) of the time. Jig weight is far more important to me than is color. You might be overthinking your situation. I don't know as though I would recommend replacing your jigs, but if doing so makes your brain happy (i.e. restores your confidence) - go for it. You will catch fish if your brain is happy. Do whatever it takes to get to that state of mind. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2688090,Jack77,2014-04-17 05:23:00,168,I have been hooked by the red hook myself but I can't honestly say that it has ever made a difference. I have noticed a difference in the color of the jig head itself and as a rule you always want to use the lightest jig you can. If you are anchored in still water in anything less than 15'FOW I would go with a 1/8oz jig and go up from there. Experiment with what color seems to working best but I wouldn't worry about the hook color. I have come to believe that the only thing that red hooks catch more of are fishermen.
2688514,tv4fish,2014-04-17 07:02:00,2694,"And they also catch more of the fisherman's money.I also believe it has MORE to do with what weight jig you are using and what is on the jig (bait). In my boat we typically ""experiment"" with jig haed colors to start with. Each of the 3 of us will start out with a different color and if we find out that one color seems to be more productive, than the other 2 will switch to that color. I guess I don't really believe that small amount of red on the shank of the hook is going to make much difference."
2688713,Fishoil,2014-04-17 07:39:00,1277,"I agree that the color of the hook makes virtually no difference but I think jig head color matters most of the time. I generally fish with twister tails in Canada, the color of the tail definitely matters and to a smaller degree the color of the head. With live bait I think it's about the same. What really matters the most is how you work the jig. Weight of the jig is also very important and you should be using the lightest jig that YOU can feel bottom with. That might be heavier or lighter than the next guy. If you can't feel bottom well you will miss bites and not be able to work the jig as effectively to get them in the first place."
2688938,northernbite,2014-04-17 08:29:00,1186,"Amen, Most of time it is just knowing what ""action"" they want that day and what is on the end of hook. The more you do it the better you get. Paul"
2690538,jimmie,2014-04-17 13:33:00,123,Likely a government regulation. Hooks might be sharp you know. lol Ladders have 11 warnings on them . . . jigs could be next heh. I do agree that the jig head matters but I have had better luck with red hooks some of the time but over the years have noticed little difference. The more exposed the red id I think it could work better but no proof of it. Fish are supposed to see shades only but I'm not a fish either. By the way if you are spending $100 on jigs . . . move away from the rocks just a tad. try flipping you line if you get stuck too much. It may release them from whatever they might be stuck on. Have fun and be safe and enjoy your trip ni matter where you fish. Jim

2699250,jimmie,2014-04-19 18:27:00,123,LOL The less experienced fishermen do have alot of rocks bite their jigs. Good luck with your gang have fun!!
