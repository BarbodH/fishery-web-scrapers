2714289,EyeMagic,2014-04-23 12:53:00,10,"Looking for some opinions on brand/type of net to purchase for upcoming trip to Northwest Ontario. While the camp I go to provides a net for each boat, they are usually crappy/mesh style nets that the hooks get all caught up and such. Looking for a rubber type/hook resistant type that will deter some of this hassle when landing fish. I only want to spend between $50-$75. Multi-species between walleye/Northerns. I handle most of my fish by hand, but on occasion I need to grab net due to the hookset with trebles just staring at my hands! Any help guys? Also on that note, any preference on landing glove for those fish that look impossible to grab without being hooked. Needless to say, I troll quite a bit with Rapalas and larger Stick Baits. Help!"
