6252460,gordy28,2018-10-10 08:41:00,437,Our group is pretty sure we are going to fly commercial for our next trip We typically bring our own portable graphs which are powered by the 12 v 7 am hours batteryhttps://humminbird.johnsonoutdoors.c...5-sonar-gps-pt Has anyone flown with something similar? Can you put it in your suticase Â– any restrictions that you are aware of? Figured I would ask here prior to calling the airlines directly Cheers Gordy
6252468,Mojo-NC,2018-10-10 08:52:00,1929,"Yup, we do it every year. Place tape over the terminals and place the battery in a ziplock back. We have not had a problem checking or carrying one on the plane. However, you never know how the TSA employees will react. It might help to print the page from the TSA website and carry it with you.https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-...-wet-batteries"
6252500,jimirjr,2018-10-10 11:21:00,1149,"I do this every year... I put all My fishing Gear (finder included) into a hard side cooler... Usually an old Coleman Plastic Sided Cooler. Use socks to cushion all My stuff.. You also need to ""duct tape"" it closed.. Most TSA people are knowledgeable enough now days to recognize what You are carrying. Oh Yeah, I always ""CHECK"" My baggage.... except for My Rod Case. THAT is always a CARRY ON..."
6252838,Larry S,2018-10-11 16:42:00,665,I Take frozen ELK every year for my fly-in trips . I carry a soft cooler with elk & dry ice on plane I Always Print the TSA Instructions on what can be carried onto the plane One year the TSA agent Insisted that I Could Not bring the elk on board the plane I showed her the print out from TSA's website she took it checked with her Superiors and Came back Told Me I was Correct & Apologized to me
6253046,Guest,2018-10-13 01:24:00,0,"Absolutely check with the airline. And dont try to sneak it into your checked luggage. you could get hit with a big fine if the airline / TSA / Catsa consider your battery as undeclared dangerous goods. And each airline could have different allowances of what is acceptable for their carriage. Also what TSA may allow may not be allowed by Catsa if you are flying back from Canada. Or visa versa. Wet cells are pretty much a no go, unless its part of a wheel chair for someone and even then it must be removed and the battery placed into a specialized container to prevent spills or capture fluid in the event of a spill. All I can say is check with the airline to be safe and avoid disappointment. Good luck"
6253444,gordy28,2018-10-15 07:54:00,437,"Thanks guy's Should have mentioned our flight will most likely be from Canada to Canada as I am a Canadian lol But all tips helpful - think the gist is read the regs, talk to the airline and make sure if need be that equipment is pointed out ahead of time (pre boarding) Cheers Andrew"
6254708,Guest,2018-10-20 15:01:00,0,What kind / type battery does your unit use or plan to take on the aircraft?
6254836,gordy28,2018-10-21 09:35:00,437,It uses a 7ah 12 v gell battery like this https://www.walmart.com/ip/HUMMINBIR...ARGER/20449451ThanksGordy
6255600,Guest,2018-10-24 15:39:00,0,"Ahha. That is technically a acid battery. the sulfuric acid is mixed with fumed silica, which makes the resulting mass gel-like. I'm not sure how the airlines would handle that as it is not spill able but it does contain acid. Best to ask Air Canada, Westjet or Porter"
6266978,spoonchucker,2018-12-07 11:50:00,82,"I flew United from Buffalo to Winnipeg. Totally checked out that the battery was ok if terminals had electric tape over them and wires pulled, separate box. I even had the TSA print out of how to transport and what sizes were permitted etc. At Security in Buffalo the TSA looked at it, said nice job, and I went right through. On way back from Winnipeg I did same thing. Security told me I needed United permission to transport. He told me just wait and we will call down at desk and tell them what you have and expect ok. I was tight on schedule. He said no one answering at desk. He tried again. I told him I flew United in to Canada etc but said without permission I could not take it on board. Last call to Board came so I had to leave while they had my brand new battery. Moral of story- when you are at counter and checking in from Canada, tell them to call security and say battery is ok or at least tell agent that security will call when I go through and show the agent the battery. At least someone should be able to ok the battery for transport."
