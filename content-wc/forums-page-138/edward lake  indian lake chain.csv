One of our guys caught a 30"" walleye off the dock one night. He kept hollering ""Get the net, someone get the net"". We all thought he was kidding around. He found a net stuck in a post at the end of the dock. The fish is on his wall now. Clark's run some nice camps. That chain of lakes is full of good fishing."
