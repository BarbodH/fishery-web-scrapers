6199580,DonC,2018-05-24 13:09:00,93,I have been on 60+ Ontario fishing trips since 1988. Had my best numbers day in 2016 with 205 fish for the boat in 1 day. Mostly smallmouth. Some large pike and walleye also. DonC
6199718,ackermannsacre,2018-05-24 19:09:00,196,"A few years ago I took my wife to Boois on Trout Lake. Fly out of Red Lake, very nice modern A-frame cottages, great food in the lodge. It was like a second honeymoon!"
6200094,AsianAngler,2018-05-25 14:46:00,67,"I have roughed it and experienced the ""luxury"" trip (flush toilets, clean rooms, and American Plan). If you ask me (and I love to fish), I would go luxury any day. I find it leaves me less crabby from enduring the ""BS factors"" involved in rustic lodging and I have more energy to devote to fishing and other pursuits. One of the nicest places we have stayed is The Old Post on Lake St. Joseph. Pretty much all American Plan unless you have a large group. No dishpan hands! One caution, if your wife is uncomfortable on large lakes with potentially rough water, this is probably not the place for you. Fly-ins to lakes where you are the only two on the lake are usually smaller bodies of water and can be romantic if you have the energy for that. One contradictory point on the advice above.... I will say, when you rough it, you are not sad to return home after the trip... you say, ""Wow! Hot running water and flush toilets, it is good to be home."""

6265656,mnfishin,2018-12-03 18:11:00,52,"I figured I would update this post. We had a fantastic time at Crow Rock lodge. The lodge is on a beautiful island and tucked away in an extremely wind protected area. The lodge, staff, guide, food, and service were all outstanding. The fishing is excellent in the area. We also liked the private portage lakes to mix things up a bit. For a first Canadian trip for my wife it was an A+. There is a very high chance we will return but may try another lodge next summer. Haven't decided yet.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6270162,kayakmatt,2018-12-19 16:22:00,105,"Yeah, my wife loves Crow Rock also. We've been there 3 times in recent years. The portage lakes make for a nice diversion if she wants to catch smallies one after another. Great place if you seek an American plan lodge with your wife. There tends to be a decent amount of females that go there."

6075361,Aspencreek,2018-03-21 08:41:00,2911,"Well, you tried.............For some reason my wife thinks that she would be stuck in the boat all day, with smelly fish and dead minnows, would have to handle crawlers and leeches, beat back the biting fly's, and stay in a run down cabin, with no hot water and sleep in a lumpy bed, listening to snoring all night. Not to mention eating bad food, the gaseous eliminations from the other ""guys"", ill fitting rainwear and not being given ample time for hair and makeup in the morning. I have no idea where she got those ideas, but I'm sure not going to try and convince her otherwise. WIN _WIN for me."
6076161,rosh1,2018-03-21 13:32:00,275,"I have never stayed at temple bay but would agree with others that would be a nice place to take your wife. A few years ago took my wife and kids up to eagle and its a nice lake. My wife and some other people go over to temple bay and have cocktails. Taking my wife fishing to eagle, when we were coming home she said we need a bigger boat. Next year coming home she said we need to buy a place on eagle, last year she said we need even a bigger boat. I have no problem fishing with my wife now I spend months not a week in Canada."

6116594,martinbns,2018-04-07 10:13:00,1520,"You will love it there. I've never stayed but it's in a great location on the lake with easy access to the full southern portion down towards Big Narrows, Andrews Bay is just to the east and Ptarmigan/Shoal is just to the west. On windy days there are plenty of areas close by near Oliver Island etc where you can fish easily without being beaten up."
6137729,fldoc1,2018-04-16 17:22:00,69,"It was great reading about recommended options where one could bring their wife. I will be taking my wife to Mylies Place on LOW near Morson for the 4th year in a row. She grew up with camping and fishing plus we live on a lake near Duluth so is willing to try outdoor, fishy things. I typically go on one or more Canadian fishing trips with the guys each year but decided to see if I could convince her to go. I tried for 7 days and we settled on 5.I remember the drive there the first year as she was trying to negotiate the max time she would fish - 3 hours she said. I did not fight this but we fished 11 or so hours each day. Once we got out on the lake the time just flew. We visited Obabicon camp and that would be another good choice especially if you want the American plan. It has the feeling of a 50's adventure. The owner knows the lake, it is in a good location, plus he is a frequent Walleye Central contributor.I looked at the Crow Rock camp and it looks very nice. I like the idea of the smaller lakes. We are not American plan people so would not work for us but it looks like a great choice for you.I do want to comment on Mylies near Morson. It is a drive to camp in a nice location tucked into a bay that has great protection for your boat. Unlike fishing out of Baudette there are 100's of islands so one can fish in almost any direction getting away from the wind. My wife really likes Ellen, the owner. She and her son run the camp and they take pride on having a clean, comfortable, reasonable priced camp that one could bring their wife to. Wendy looks forward to going each year and each year we explore more of the lake.Randy from DuluthPS With the guys I am going to Rainy Lake, Little Vermillion near Red Lake, and possibly Sturgeon north of Ignace this year."
6187793,Lake Of The Woods,2018-05-11 21:37:00,124,"I think you may find one of the Totem Resorts lodges will full-fill your requirements. I lived in the Kenora area for many years and have stayed a couple of the lodges. Yellowbird being my favourite but Wiley Point is a close second and closer to Kenora if your wife is interested in shopping and other various summer activities i.e., festivals, M.S. Kenora boat cruise on LOW, sightseeing.You will however have to be water taxied in the Kenora harbourfront from Wiley Point Lodge or take your boat to town if bringing one.

6060401,Guest,2018-03-14 10:15:00,0,"I've been to a few of these places. Would recommend Obabikon or Witch Bay. If you need more help finding fish, then I'd lean towards Witch Bay. They have an excellent fishing program. Prices at Tomahawk are very close to American plan, but they only offer cabin and boat dock. Their dock gas is over $6 a gallon. Can't speak to any of the others. Good luck with your trip!"
6060929,Ricky Spanish,2018-03-14 13:18:00,1298,"I probably sound like a broken record by now, but I have had nothing but good times fishing out of Temple Bay with my wife since going there first in 2003. She is not a girly girl, though. Our first trip there was actually our honeymoon, and HER idea. Every time we are there, at least a couple guys in camp have brought their non-diehard wife along. Most years, we are paired up with other couples in the dining room and every one of those ladies has told us they can't wait to come back."

Having said that, it's been a pretty long time since I fished Eagle for walleyes, so my opinion isn't based on very recent experience.But Lake of the Woods has always been excellent for walleye in my experience."
6061561,Guest,2018-03-14 20:05:00,0,"Never fished Lake of Woods. Fished Eagle out of Temple Bay probably 15 times. If you want BIG walleyes we have had 3 fish over 30"" each of the last three years in our boat. Dozens in the 25"" to 29"". Hundreds and hundreds of Walleyes under the slot and in it. Over the years many wives have taken the bus trip up with us and have enjoyed it immensely. A Dr. And his wife have gone with us the last 4 years and are signed up again this year. She enjoys the guides that show her the old gold mine and soap stone mine on the lake. Big northerns and an occasional musky thrown in. Not to mention the jumbo perch fishing. Good luck and enjoy."

My cousin who WAS always my travel and boat partner in all of my previous trips, had the same wonderful thoughts. So he set up a trip for 2 to our camp for a week before our planned trip several years ago. Of course all went well and she thought it was SO wonderful that now he can't go with us unless she comes along. He doesn't come with us anymore and I miss him. Just food for thought!!!!"

You see I live in a testosterone free zone now and have for over 20 yrs., shucks even the dog is a female. My cousin would love to go with us, but he made that fatal mistake.

6052761,pjshorthorn,2018-03-11 07:25:00,5654,"I would echo Breezy's suggestion about Obabikon Bay. Jared has a beautiful place and all we saw was from the boat. When I introduced myself as PjShorthorn from WC, he just laughed. Two years later I'm trying to figure out if that was a good thing or a bad thing...... If I were to take my wife to a lodge in Canada ( which she will never do - too much of a city girl), I would absolutely consider Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul out of Hudson,ON. It is a drive to location just west of Sioux Lookout and you can park your rig at the main boat launch for the week, boat across the bay to camp which may be about 5 minutes. They have a very nice camp on an island that is easily accessible to some awesome walleye fishing not far from camp.They have Aemerical plan and Housekeeping plan options with cabins that are fully furnished with all amenities that most everyone wants on their vacation. If you want to run into Sioux Lookout or explore other towns, they will run you to the boat launch on the mainland so you don't have to use your boat and trailer it. They also have guide service out of this lodge that will help you learn the area. I can't remember athe name of a prominent guide that works through the lodge,but I'll update the post if I remember his name. Very nice setting and close to other things to do if that urge hits you.

6053377,Slim03,2018-03-11 11:50:00,159,Basil and Sam both guide out of there. Great fishing and nice cabins. I go there twice a year right now. I was going to take my wife and daughter there this year but vacation plans changed. One thing though is mention to Shane that you are bringing the misses and he will ensure that you have the right cabin as all do not indoor facilities. All cabins have running water and showers.

6053521,Mojo-NC,2018-03-11 13:15:00,1929,"Another place to consider for you and your wife would be Reid's Birch Island Resort. This is the first place we ever stayed on a Canadian fishing trip. We drove up and they came and picked us up in a boat and took us to camp. You will be pampered at Birch Island Resort and fed very well. It's an exceptional camp on an island in the Winnipeg river system. There is great walleye, pike, musky, and smallmouth fishing, but it's big water so you'll probably need a guide unless you are fine staying close to camp. The place has changed ownership since we were there, so I can't speak to the quality of new owners at all.http://reidsbirchislandresort.com/#home"

Total cost, if I remember correctly was $100 (50 per person) for the short 15 minute flight. But she had never flown in a float plane, and thought it would be fun.Here's the video of our float plane adventure...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-OubGE73kwAfternoon:Launched the canoe in a tiny lake in Nestor Falls and caught 5 or 6 nice pike over 30 inches. My wife had a blast, as her previous PR was about a 10 inch bass.Days 2-4Stayed at Dogtooth Lake Resort, just south of Kenora. Did a lot of canoeing and hiking in the Rushing River Provincial Park area, with just a small bit of fishing as well.Went into Kenora and took an evening cruise on the Miss Kenora. (Scenic boat tour of LOTW, and you can buy dinner on the cruise as well) If your wife has never been to NW Ontario before, my guess is that she would probably enjoy this cruise.Here's a link.....http://www.mskenora.com/Days 5-8Went to Ash Rapids Camp, and fished in Labyrinth Bay and Shoal Lake. Stopped in at Shoal Lake Lodge to take a tour (That's on an island, so you can't run into town for shopping, etc. But it's REALLY nice, with wonderful accomodations, beautiful landscaping, game room, etc. My wife was really impressed with Shoal Lake Lodge and I think she would have enjoyed staying there, even though it's on an island - still plenty to do there, even if you're not a die hard fisher person)In general though, if your trip is not dedicated to 100% pure fishing, then your wife may (potentially) experience some boredom at an island resort, or a boat in / fly in type setting.So we did kind of a ""random sampling"" of all that Ontario has to offer, because I knew my wife would be bored with a 100% fishing trip.So if you could provide a little info regarding your wife's level of enthusiasm toward fishing, it might be easier to make a few more specific recommendations.""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
