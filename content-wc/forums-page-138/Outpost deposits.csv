6266754,Ogoki,2018-12-06 17:44:00,291,"Been back to Ontario 3 times since then. Been on over 40 fly in trips and don't plan to stop , but I am VERY cautious now . Fair is fair . Our bear hunting outfitter agreed with me on this issue. He has been in business many many years and has also worked for fly in outfitters . His bear hunting business is so go that he does not even have a website ."
6266054,Ogoki,2018-12-05 06:31:00,291,"I totally understand a short season and on operator has to make it when they can. That being said , I feel that each situation should be looked at by the outfitter. My wife and I had a trip booked for a year. Paid the deposits shortly after returning from our last trip. A couple decided to go with us about 2 months prior to us going. They sent in the $700 deposit. Something serious came up and they just could not go. Well the outfitter has a policy whereas he will NOT carry the deposit over to the next year. My wife and I were originally the only two booked for that cabin , so the couple LOST their deposit. That left a sour taste with them and they would not go the next year. It was not a situation where there was a minimum number for the trip. I explained this to outfitter and he was firm with his decision . He flat out lost two people over it . Cost him more in long run , but we still use him . I would have looked at that one differently ."
6266068,Obabikon,2018-12-05 07:12:00,2370,"A few things... I try to avoid putting a group of 2 in a cabin that sleeps 4 or more. There's several reasons for this, but the main one is to maximize the number of people at the resort during our peak times. However, if I had done this, and you had called to tell me you had two more, I wouldn't have even bothered to have the other couple send in a deposit. I would have just said that in my mind the cabin was reserved, but thanks for the heads up. Every resort is going to be different though. Every owner will have different policies about deposits. Always ask before you send in the money."
6266082,v-bay gord,2018-12-05 07:42:00,3168,"I think it would have been reasonable, and preferable, to credit their deposit to another trip. In the scheme of things it takes marketing dollars and a lot of effort to get potential guests to the point of booking. He was just throwing that away by his actions, when he had the potential to retain a group for future trips. Perhaps he doesn't need the customers, or was just stuck on his own hard ball attitude and policy."
6266106,BreezyPoint,2018-12-05 08:58:00,1581,"In the past, I have had a few people back out of trips at the last minute. After that, I have my own policy about deposits. When I book for a group, I handle the deposit and require all parties to pay me right away. I make it clear that the deposit is non refundable. If you back out the deposit is used to defray costs for other members of the trip regardless of reason for backing out.As to the resort owner, I consider the deposit spent money and expect no further consideration from the owner. If they want to provide some consideration, such as applying to a future booking, than that's nice, but I don't expect it.The season is short for these people and lost last minute bookings can be very costly to them and they may not be able to rebook at the last minute.When I go to my annual trip to Lake of the Woods, every cabin is booked, so it is for sure a loss to the owner, far in excess of the deposit.By setting my expectations this way, I will never have hard feelings towards the owner of a camp and they will never have hard feelings towards me. I like it that way.Frank"
6266248,IAranger,2018-12-05 15:29:00,352,I have sent deposits for years and been to several places and spent 15 years in the Motel industry that is ridiculous and just poor business by that outfitter. I can see only giving half back or any number of things but he would NEVER get my business after doing that to one of my friends. Kudos to you Ogoki you are a much bigger man that I to keep going back to them. I had a situation where I made reservations and paid deposits for a fly in trip for a friend and his son with my son and I. I paid in January for a June trip and my buddy sent me his deposit in February. Mid March my buddy had a heart attack and was under Dr restriction and could not go. I called the outfitter and explained as this effected a lot we went from 4 in a plane to 2 and it was an all inclusive place so room and food everything was effected. He said no problem and let him use his deposit the next year and worked it out for my son and I to still enjoy our trip without paying a premium.
6266288,Fisherman Ted,2018-12-05 17:46:00,461,"Every lodge has a different policy. Making sure everyone understands said policy is critical. This happens all the time. But if you are clear up front there should be no surprises. As a lodge owner I am crystal clear when booking a trip for a guest. Its in writing, on the web-site and in the deposit confirmation. If you feel there is a chance something might happen that would preclude you from taking a trip (like having a heart condition, or sick mother etc) then trip insurance is your best friend. Insure your trip and this issue goes away. That deposit ensures your cabin months and even years in advance. Let's put the shoe on the other foot. How about if we as lodge owners two weeks out when you were going to arrive said ""sorry, something came up, I'm not going to have a cabin available for your trip"". But you say ""hey my deposit ensured that cabin for me"". Can't have it both ways. Try this. Book your flight to the Caribbean for spring break and then cancel 2 weeks before your trip. As Obabikon says that money is not recoverable. Its not like a car where I can keep it on the lot. We go out of our way to help out when we can for sure. But with trip insurance really being a life saver and a valid option for many situations that has helped big time and if you bail and leave us in the lurch........ -FT"
6266290,Ogoki,2018-12-05 18:02:00,291,"In our situation ,this outfitter ALLOWS two people at certain camps. So my wife and I were booked and deposit paid . The couple going with us was just a bonus to the outfitter ,as he was taking JUST TWO OF US ANYWAY . If he had allowed the deposit to carry to the next year , who knows how many times they would have went with us . Four people paying to fly in a beaver vs two , would make more since and money for him. I totally understand if there was a 4 person minimum and 2 backed out . But that was not the case . If I had known what might have happened, I would have told them not to pay deposit and called a week before we were to arrive and said there will be 4 instead of 2. We booked on way out before we found out about the deposit not being carried over . Have not went back since . As you can tell this is a sore subject with me . I have dealt with customers in my business for 45 years and I look at the situation and then deal with it . I can go anywhere in this town where I live and don't have to avoid anyone . I just try to be fair ."
6266298,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-05 18:28:00,8293,You really aren't getting a point across to the lodge owner by going back.
6266306,Ogoki,2018-12-05 18:53:00,291,"We only went back the one time , before we found out about the deposit the other couple lost."
6266610,IAranger,2018-12-06 10:07:00,352,"Totally makes sense now !!! Everyone has to make money for the system to work and there is always going to be some give and take depending which side of the fence you are on... In your case hearing just your side the owner was clearly wrong, which is too bad because those are the kind of situations that make people shy away from taking trips when they hear about being mistreated. I love going to Canada and exploring different lakes, resorts, etc. I look forward to my trips all winter and spring long and for me to bail on a trip something really bad would have to happen for sure."
6263280,vteye3,2018-11-26 10:26:00,496,We sent in our initial deposits 6 confirming camp. I have additional guy should he send in his deposit? May have 8 guys in camp if one backs out last minute and paid cost of entire trip (US exchange is good) should he expect to get the funds back minus the deposit? Curious of camp owners thoughts? Thanks Charlie
6263282,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-26 10:36:00,8293,I think every camps owner is different and you should check with them.
6263452,CABLEGUY,2018-11-26 21:14:00,15,They will usually hold your deposit for a future trip from my experience. But best to check with your outfitter. Some post it on their website
6263478,Bstar,2018-11-27 05:36:00,564,Guys in our group know that the deposit is non-refundable if they back out unless the spot is filled or plenty of notice is given. You have to have some skin in the game to deter last minute back outs. Our group is all family and we haven't had that problem. I would definitely lay out the ground rules to any newbies so there's no hard feelings if the situation should arise.
6264002,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-28 18:15:00,8293,"If you invite guys that ""need"" to go to Canada fishing vs the ""gee, that sounds like fun"" guys you will have less people backing out."
6265816,Aspencreek,2018-12-04 11:50:00,2911,"When planning for our trip the deposit is NON_REFUNDABLE. With 1 exception, you can't go because someone in your immediate family dies or for the birth of a child (yours). If the person making the deposit dies, no refund, he can't use it anyway and should have had more consideration for the rest of us when making the reservation. (Rule 1a) Our group has developed this policy because of some last minute (within 2 months of leaving) guys who have backed out for any number of dumb reasons, not the least of which have been: 1. my wife says it cost too much 2. my wife doesn't want me gone that long 3. my girlfriend (anything) 4. my boss won't let me have the time off and if you back out once, you are no longer on the list for invitee's (without some serious begging on your part)."
6265898,hoppy63,2018-12-04 15:42:00,367,"We have had group of six the last 5 years. I always pay the deposit for our group, then when trip rolls around I collect from all, and I owe nothing plus have all the $ I need. With that said I only pay deposit for four guys, with the understanding with outpost owner that their most likely will be six of us....has not been an issue. That leaves wiggle room if something would come up, and a couple could not go. As far as the refund, if you do cancel, most places will let you use it toward the following year. My 2¢."
6265910,pnnylfr,2018-12-04 16:25:00,114,X2. We have the same basic policy.
6265954,Obabikon,2018-12-04 19:21:00,2370,"Camp owner perspective.... If my resort has 40 beds, and my average ""peak"" season is 15 weeks... I only have room for 600 guests per year. If someone books a trip and cancels... that is money that the resort can never get back. Even if they come another trip. Everyone should be aware of that. That said, our guests are our often our friends. They are our life, and without them there's no resort. So, kindness and consideration come first. If you have someone you're worried about backing out... tell them to be completely committed or try to come last second. If the resort is ""full"" they should have committed."
6265988,Aspencreek,2018-12-04 21:22:00,2911,"The lodge owner that I go explained his policy the same way, this afterall it is HIS/HER Livelihood, so we adopted ours the same only a bit stronger. Over 20 trips and we have yet to not fill our cabin, yes we have had guys try to drop out and when they find out that their deposit was going to fund someone else they found it a good enough reason not to drop out, or we found someone last minute to fill the spot. We still keep the deposit for guys that do drop and it pays for groceries. In my mind NOBODY is in unless the deposit is in my hand, no deposit no go. I know another guy who tried to put together a group of husbands and wives for a cabin of 12 minimum. After originally getting the 6 couples to commit he didn't get deposits and had 2 drop out within a month of leaving. He could only get 4 couples, and asked me and my son to go along last minute for a group of 10. He footed the bill for the last 2 himself, paying over $1700 extra because he could not fill the 12 person minimum, and did it willingly, Getting those deposits are critical."
