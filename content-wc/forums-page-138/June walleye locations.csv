Have been to Canada several times with this group and this will be our third time to the lake, but never during this time (we’ve been there during May and August) I know walleye movement is dictated by water temp, but any general advice for locations to try? In May we were picking up eyes in 4’ of water in river mouths that they were spawning in. Will they have moved to main lake structure by this time? Thanks for the help."

I travel a bit further down Nungesser Road than the bridge to fish on Stormer and Kirkness Lakes. You said the key thing to understanding fishing in late May and early June: it all depends on water temperature. Weather patterns (winds, temperature, water level, rain/snow, sun/clouds) are very important at this time of the fishing season. It's not only water temperature, but can also be trends in water temperature. I have seen weeks in late May and very early June that were all over the map. One pattern that generally worked for me was fishing the wind. By this, I mean fish where warmer surface water collects. This could be points, ""cups"" along shorelines or in bays. One thing to keep in mind is that the fish will be on the move, as water temperatures might be just warm enough to allow fish to work long expanses of shorelines. The fish might be here now, and then gone in just a little while. I noticed something in 2017 that was unusual. The water temperature in late May that year was up and down with wild swings. I think the fish got tired of these temperature swings and they just left shore very early. I was catching them on Memorial Day in 20+ fow associated with structure that was near shore. The walleyes moved off of shore to the first set of rock humps. If the water temperature is warm enough, you might want to target emerging weeds. These weeds might be holding young perch or other minnows. I have seen yet another trend come into play. It seems that the walleyes that linger for a long time around shore are often juvenile males. I often found the adult females close by, but deeper. The larger fish might be near the first break. Another pattern might develop for you. If the water temperature is warm enough, the walleyes might follow the shiner minnows when they spawn. The walleyes will stage just outside of the spawning area and wait for the minnows when they finish spawning. The shiners typically spawn in the middle part of June. Check incoming streams for this pattern. I encourage you to not lock into any pre-conceived patterns. Be flexible until the fish tell you where they are and what they want. Other anglers in camp might be able to help you get things dialed in. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Since you've fished the lake before, you already know the structure areas. We generally find fish anywhere deep water comes close to shore, on points with decent contour, and on submerged humps. Emerging weeds can be a really good place to find fish, depending how far along the weed growth is at the time, the type of weeds, and how close they are to deep water. If it's been a cold spring, the fish will be a little shallower and if it's been warm they will be a little deeper. We generally focus on structure in the 8-14' depth range and we often will find them pulling spinner rigs. Once you catch one, there will be more there. You can do your fine tuning using a jig. Looking at the lake map on Navionics, it looks like you'll have plenty of places to fish. That lake is loaded with structure. I would focus on structure areas closest to the inlet to the lake first, and move outward from there."

Nungesser doesn't grow much of a cabbage crop, except for a couple of bays on the right at the far end of the lake. Since you know where walleyes spawn, I suggest starting at the mouth of the river, then follow shoreline, checking structure and points until you find fish. A river mouth that doesn't hold walleyes during the day will very likely hold plenty at first light and around sunset. You will probably be seeing dragonflies and little yellow butterflies. Shiners begin spawning about the same as butterflies show up. Casting into shallow water will occasionally result in spooking shiners. When you see them jumping you'll know you've run across a shiner spawn. Begin fishing around 80' from where you saw minnows jumping and you should be picking up walleyes. As it slows down, move closer while continuing to fish. Finally you'll be close enough to fish right at the spawning bed. Don't be surprised if a huge pike eats your lure. It might be a mistake to make your first cast right into the spawning bed in case you hook onto a huge pike and will be spooking other fish as you bring the pike to your boat. Don't beat up the spot . Fish it for a while, then let it rest. Check it again the same day. Shiner spawn doesn't last long. If another boat approaches, pretend you're working on your reel or eating lunch until the other guy moves on. Your hot spot doesn't need to be over fished."
