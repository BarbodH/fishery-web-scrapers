6235602,Neil Toland,2018-08-20 13:45:00,198,Leaving Friday to Eagle Lake for the first time. Going to Birchdale Lodge and this is my Wife's first trip to Canada. Looking for a current fishing report or any hints / tips.
6235618,rosh1,2018-08-20 14:19:00,275,lake is very low. fish last week where around 30 ft east of where you are staying. plenty of fish but not all biting. have fun
6235640,v-bay gord,2018-08-20 15:09:00,3168,There is still a shallow bite going on (surprisingly more than I would have expected)...not all walleye are deep. Don't overlook weed edges and shallow structure that can hold fish. That being said there are walleye using deep water as well.....which can be problematic when trying to release them. Some cloud cover / wind / wave action can trigger fish that seem reluctant. Good luck!

6269514,Huck34,2018-12-17 18:29:00,4,"My group will be tackling Eagle Lake for the 1st time this coming Spring! We will be headed to South Shore Lodge mid-June and will mainly target Walleyes, but also enjoy fishing for bass, pike and skie's. Can anyone offer any tips for this lake for that time of year? We have fished Cedar the last 5 years and although it is a great fishery we found that it was a little crowded for the size of water plus we were just looking for a new adventure! We will have 2 private boats and one camp boat with a diverse group from hard fisherman to hard beer drinkers! Thanks for any input! Huck34"
6269598,prov1800,2018-12-18 06:39:00,5010,Morning huck.i do a fair amount of fishing on both cedar and eagle.You will find out it's really busy on eagle to.maybe busier than than cedar.also because it's a huge lake it will be tougher to find fish.all the HOT spots will have lots of boats on them.if you don't want crowds then you need to find a couple of your own spots.fishing is good but easier fishing on cedar.size wise about the same.you will be close to blind bay and blind bay creek.good fishing in that area but there will 30 boats in there at all times.
