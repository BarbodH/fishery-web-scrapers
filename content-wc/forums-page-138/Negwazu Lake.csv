4106857,sahutch,2015-08-06 07:55:00,6,I was wondering if the cabins on Negwazu Lake (between Wawa and White River) are for rent? Thank you for any help.
4107865,Fish_Heads,2015-08-06 14:39:00,154,"There used to be a ""train"" in resort on the north side of the lake but don't recall the name.The other camp on the east side (boat in ) was closed & not looking in too good of shape with a local living in one of the cabins when we were there 2 years ago. We didn't get to Negwazu last year or on this years trip, found a better lake to portage in to much closer to where we stay at Wawa.Miss those nice Negwazu walleyes though, but don't miss the road in or the parking area that looks like a freshly bombed battlefield ! (that's being nice on my parking description !)Post up an after trip account of your stay I'd like to hear a fishing update.Fish"
4108897,sahutch,2015-08-07 06:24:00,6,"Fished there one day last week. You are correct, the road and parking are an adventure. Fishing was good , with 29"" walleye being the biggest. I would like to know if the train in cabin is still available."
4109505,Fish_Heads,2015-08-07 09:14:00,154,"You might check at the train station at Hawk Junction to see if they're offering a stop there. If they are, you could inquire about contact info for the cabins to see if anything is available.I would love to get my ""real"" boat in there sometime to use the electronics & locate some go to marks on my gps.The little 12 footers we take in there don't have much room for large screen sonar/gps combos ! (but it's still a fun fishing destination for a day trip)."
4109817,sahutch,2015-08-07 11:26:00,6,I will look into that. Thanks for the help.
