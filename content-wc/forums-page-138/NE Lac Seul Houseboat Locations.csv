You may try Google earth as well to look at those areas."
6268936,wooglin,2018-12-14 12:58:00,371,Where is Ogemon Light/Banana Island? Thanks!!
6268994,bigwalleye1,2018-12-14 21:23:00,2632,"Go up through the Rags, turn right. Follow that water northeast on the map to the gap going north toward Taylor island. Youâ€™re on the route toward bear narrows and still south of Taylor island"
6246514,wooglin,2018-09-19 06:53:00,371,"Does anyone know specifically where houseboats target to beach for a week in NE Lac Seul? Are there designated, or typically used, spots? Can it be anywhere? I have attached a map section of that area, wondering if they beach anywhere near here. We want to target muskie and walleye and this is the section of the lake we intend to go to. I have identified a few outposts in that area too, for reference. Thanks!"
6246560,pjshorthorn,2018-09-19 08:01:00,5654,"If you would like, PM me your email address and I'll be happy to send you some marked maps of spots that I have personally used along with others from this forum. If you are going to target musky you may want to consider HB spots north of Bear Narrows. Spots are not designated. It is first come first serve and each outfitter has their own favorite spots to suggest. You can pretty much park anywhere you want, but you want it to be somewhat protected and a bit of a sandy bottom so you aren't bouncing on rocks if a good blow were to come up. PjShorthorn"
6246570,wooglin,2018-09-19 08:15:00,371,PM sent!
6246574,pjshorthorn,2018-09-19 08:22:00,5654,Got it. I'll send you some ideas as soon as I can. PjShorthorn

6267844,jimirjr,2018-12-10 18:26:00,1149,You Will Love It !! We will be there week of 9/7 - 9/14 !
6267978,David Anderson,2018-12-11 08:27:00,2073,"Nice choice, was there 3 times each year for the last 3 years, usually on opener, once in June then in September. Are you bringing your own boats? If so I highly recommend the Navionics Map North or Canada that has Lac Seul listed. It's a great resource to help avoid the major rock and hazard areas as well as finding your way back to camp. Wapesi is known for its muskies. Somewhere there was a good post on muskie vs pike fishing on Lac Seul and their locations."
6268308,wooglin,2018-12-12 08:15:00,371,"We have one boat of our own and then 2 other guys will be renting. We have fished the SE side of Lac Seul 03-07, near Lost Island Lodge and then west into Websters bay. The boat we have, has the Helix 12 so it's fully chip capable and we'll be able to mark our trails. I'm sure we'll get a/the chip at some point, and I'll try to track down a paper copy of that side of the lake too. Here are some options for paper maps, that I've jotted down over time: Adventure Fishing Map 705-292-6175 Ear Falls Four Seasons Sport Shop 807-222-2200 The Pit Stop 807-222-3273 Kenora Tackle and Target Sporting Goods 807-468-3145 Can't wait, it's going to be awesome having that first shore-lunch!"
6268558,pjshorthorn,2018-12-13 02:24:00,5654,"Wooglin, I still owe you some marked up maps with fishing spots. Sorry!!! I will also look at my paper map collection and see if I can give you some more info. on where to buy one of the NE section that has decent detail on hazards and contours. Ken and Brenda have them for sale at the camp,but they have the basics noted on them and aren't as detailed. PjShorthorn"
