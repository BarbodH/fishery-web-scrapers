6265102,Fishhunter2010,2018-12-02 09:10:00,10,"Looking for a driveable american plan fishing lodge from within a day of Phila. Not interested in a long gravel road, been there done that. We are a couple in the 70s so like a bit of comfort. Good fishing is most important. Anything from walleyes and pike to bass and lake trout or a combination. Asking for a lot so may be willing to compromise on some things. Any suggestions or lodges you have fished would be appreciated."
6265354,fishron,2018-12-02 20:30:00,317,"It's hard to find an good easily accessible full service lodge within a days drive of Philadelphia, Sounds like you've done some that involved gravel roads and I've done that many times myself. I'm in my seventies and can understand the desire to find good fishing without making the trip arduous. Many of the American plan lodges that were available years ago are no longer there. I could list a bunch but it means nothing because they are gone. I've fished Loughborough lake in the past and they have a full service Inn on that lake. Its within a easy one day drive. It's a bass and pike lake. Newboro Inn on that lake near Westport and Full service and an easy one day drive. Also a bass and pike lake. If you can tolerate a long days drive, I would head for Lady Evelyn Lake. Maybe a twelve hour nice scenery drive and an overnight stay before boarding a launch to get you to the main lake the next day. Three American plan lodges. I would choose Garden Island but the're all good. Bass, Pike, and Walleye. Beautiful country and good equipment. Good luck."

6267944,MrSimon,2018-12-11 07:06:00,922,"I also live outside of Philly and have been doing drive-ins to Ontario for decades.We have tried the St. Lawrence River, a bunch of lakes north of Kingston, multiple places on the Ottawa River, and a few around Temagami. That's really about as far as you'll get in one day.We've also done the 18-22 hour drives to the Wawa, Chapleau, Hornepayne, Hearst area.Lastly, we've done a few long hauls to Nakina. That's a solid 24 hour drive.After all these years, I've learned two things:1) You can find gorgeous scenery, nice accommodations, and good fishing in any of those places, and have a wonderful vacation.2) The fishing does get better the further North and West you go. And not just by a little, it gets a LOT better each time you go to the next level.You said good fishing is most important to you, but you also mention comfort and not TOO far of a drive. That might put you in the Temagami area, somewhere between Marten River and Latchford. There are some good drive-to camps in there that have good access to bush lakes. The main lakes will see plenty of pressure, but still be good. The bush lakes is where you can find some amazing fishing.Marten River Lodge is a good option. http://martenriverlodge.com/43/Home/Also, Lake Herridge Lodge http://lakeherridgelodge.com/index.html"
6269766,bigcreekdad,2018-12-18 13:11:00,74,"I've enjoyed over 20 trips with my sons to Crane's Lochaven Lodge on the French River. Over the years I've met several other guests from Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. It is likely drivable for you in a long day (i.e. 12 hours or so). But many folks drive to Barrie, Ontario (a bit NW of Toronto), stay over, and drive final lap from there. That's a bit more leisurely than a one day trek, and you can get a good bit of fishing in the day you arrive.Crane's is an American Plan family fishing resort. The camaraderie between the guests/staff/owners etc is nothing short of wonderful. Cabins are rustic, but quite clean. Fishing is fishing...sometimes great, sometimes mediocre, but very seldom lousy. You will catch walleye,pike, both LM and SM bass, and can have a real shot at a trophy muskie. Take your own boat (I do), use theirs (including comfy pontoon boats), or take a guide (always a good idea for at least a day on new water). BTW...if you love topwater fishing, you will be thrilled.Almost forgot...food is very good.Honestly...you guys will go back if you try it.Feel free to PM me if you want to chat"
6269858,phishfearme,2018-12-18 18:48:00,1242,"do you have to drive? we've flown from PIT to thunder bay for the last 8-9 years - nice connection thru Toronto - I would bet Philly would be similar. once in thunder bay, the best walleye and pike fishing is there for the taking MUCH better than anything you can drive to within a day from Philly. you could rent a car or see if a lodge owner would setup rides to/from the lodge - or even do a fly in out of TB.united frequent traveler miles can be used - on air canadaothers from our group fly in from las vegas and easily carry all their gear in two checked bags - we've gotten car rentals for less than $300 for well over a week.phish"
6269938,MrSimon,2018-12-19 06:57:00,922,"That's really interesting. Once you land in TB, do you guys get groceries and drive to a lodge, or do you fly into a remote camp?"
6269944,phishfearme,2018-12-19 07:09:00,1242,"there's both a Walmart superstore and a very large metro food store within walking distance of the airport - both are full service - a tad expensive but no big deal.we do flyins to private lakes, no lodges - make a detailed shopping list based on a detailed menu and stick to it. cheap coolers are readily available.consider an American plan lodge and forget about food.phish"
6269994,spoonchucker,2018-12-19 08:45:00,82,"For about 700 $ you can both fly round trip tp Winnipeg in July. Consider Elk Island lodge at Gods Lake- great fishing, Greg Dick and staff will take care of you and get you without driving to their lodge by plane. FUll service."
