6266984,Andre (wallyandre),2018-12-07 12:00:00,2274,A few months ago I post a link to a inter-active map for the reseroir Gouin but at this time it was only in French so not a big plus for you guys and at that time I mentionne that the Corporation was working on a English version and it's now ready. I just did a short video to show you how it works.https://youtu.be/gN5QJoOrmqY The link for the map: http://www.afcgouin.ca/carte-interactive/ Something I forgot to show in the video is if you scroll down you can also just click on the outfitter or anything else you are interested in and it will bring you directly
