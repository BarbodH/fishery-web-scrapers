6257464,Scratcher,2018-11-02 07:50:00,170,Listened to two guys talking about a fly in they are going on. Somehow they got on the topic of being checked on the water by the MNR when there are only one or two boats on lake. First saying those boats would be an easy target for the MNR then getting to why would they bother to stop and check just one or two boats at a commercial fly in out post. I am not a fly in guy so have no idea what goes on. Just wondering how many of you have been checked at an outpost?
6257488,HeHooksHimself,2018-11-02 08:45:00,725,"We got checked last June on a fly in. We were very accurate with our catch until that very day. We had just returned to the dock for our last full day and we were gathering at the dock to take a picture of our catch. At this point we had the fish all together and thought we were spot on within the rules when one of the fish measured 19 inches. We assume that someone missed the measurement on the boat and mistook 19 for 18. We are not even sure which boat that fish was in, but the MNR wanted someone to commit to that fish. Finally my son said it was his and they stuck him for a $150 fine. We split it among the six of us so it was no big deal. We had everything marked in the freezer and they could tell we just made a mistake so it was not that big of a deal. It is our luck that just when we were on the dock for a picture they circled our camp, though. It taught us to be more careful on the boat measuring. We were very respectful to them and they to us. However, one of them was a huge linebacker style of a guy so we were certainly not going to challenge them! Fish On! Hooks"
6257506,BreezyPoint,2018-11-02 09:36:00,1581,"Over the years I have been checked many times by the MNR, especially on Lake of the Woods and Lac Seul, but the most unusual times were on Unexpected Lake on the English River and Nungesser Lake. You can boat into Unexpected Lake, but we were checked by a CO who flew in on an airplane. On Nungesser Lake, we wee checked by two COs in a very large boat (probably about 20 feet). I never figured out how they got that boat in there.Frank"
6257580,MikeinMN,2018-11-02 14:11:00,190,"We were checked on a fly in lake several years ago. It was a more remote fly in for Ontario, about 200 miles north of Red Lake. The officers were a little suspicious that we had no fish in our possession. We would always eat a steak dinner at the end of our trips and we never took fish out of a fly in, so the day they checked we had no fish at all. They took a long time thoroughly searching the whole camp. Once they were satisfied we were in compliance they asked if they could use our fire to cook a meal for themselves and if we had any spare toilet paper! They had flown out of somewhere south (I can't remember where) and were staying in the bush for a week checking places too far to economically fly round trips to daily. We offered them any use of our camp and any food we had (they were cooking hot dogs on the fire). They declined, ate their hot dogs, and left camp in an hour or so. If you're wondering, we did have beer in the boats, they did mention it, nothing came of it, they were way more concerned about over the limit fish, but this was 20 or so years ago and even in the Canadian bush things were different then."
6257586,IMT00FIERCE,2018-11-02 14:19:00,8,"I grew up (3-24 y/o) at my parents fly-in lodge NW of Ignace. It seems once a season they land at our camp to check on the Outfitter, then fly around the lake and land on a few guests. In my entire tenure up there I've only been landed on twice. Normally they land in teams of two COs. The last few summers they have also had an OPP officer that remained in the plane while COs were checking people. First, they want to see that you have licenses and a boater safety card (or the 8 day exemption signed). They also check to make sure you have enough life jackets, and a safety kit (floating rope, flashlight, whistle). The safety kits flashlights can be a problem, as the kits are cheap and don't actually keep water out. We have been making sure guests have working flashlights in their tackle boxes. Then they look at your fish, be sure to remember who kept what fish on the stringer. One guest at another camps outpost made a joke that 4/4 of the walleyes on the stringer were his (The two man limit between the two of them were 4). He ended up with a ticket. Lastly they'll look for beer and booze. They will look in your cooler, open cases of beer are illegal to have in the boat in Ontario. This coming summer, I assume they will also be looking for Marijuana.They fly a yellow turbo beaver on amphibious floats. Costs nearly 1500$ an hour to operate the plane, then they have to pay the pilot and the COs. All to try and chase down one tourists having a beer in a boat on a remote lake in the middle of nowhere."

It is the fear of getting caught that keeps most of us from speeding, driving under the influence, or robbing banks, same principle on the Conservation Officers flying in.

6257634,wantabigone,2018-11-02 19:26:00,39,I agree IMT. This is not a very cost effective way to check licenses. When we were checked ona remote lake the COs admitted they were on a milk run back to base to justify their weekend of camping. This is a waste of MNR money. They could simply set up shop at air base for the day and check everyone and their coolers prior to anyone getting into their cars. Much more cost effective.
6260364,kettyspanky,2018-11-15 04:56:00,271,I think it is good that they are checking these remote places. They have to make their presence known. Checking all water is part of the job. They are just doing their job no matter where it is.
6260406,Skywagon,2018-11-15 08:17:00,1106,"If you are concerned about those few dollars, you should come up here to the north and see the hundreds of millions of dollars that are being spend/wasted on those that don't follow any fish and game rules. I don't think the MNR is receiving an disproportionate amount of money for enforcement in the north, or probably spending it any less wisely than they do in the south, there is just not enough money available to support enforcement like we would all like to see it done."
6260414,chris.brock,2018-11-15 08:32:00,112,"By flying in to outposts, COs can find guys with beer in the boat, people without a life jacket or guys who may have forgotten their licence in the cabin. Personally, that's not how I would like to see enforcement dollars spent. I think it's more important to target the guys with 20 walleye in their possession and that can be done more efficiently and effectively by stopping them on the road heading out of town."
6260460,cast_and_blast,2018-11-15 10:38:00,1098,"We were checked a couple of times on a fly-in out of Red Lake, ON. Both times it was a yellow float plane that was ""unusually"" quiet for a plane of that vintage and size. Both times, we had 3 boats on various lakes that were accessible from our outpost cabin. Both times, they checked all 3 boats individually (fly to one, fly to the second, fly to the third). We were always in compliance, but would get weird questions... - Do you have any weapons? NO - Do you have any weapons at the cabin? NO - Do you own any weapons? YES - So you own weapons? YES - I'll ask you one last time, do you have any weapons with you? NO - So, if we check you and check the cabin we're not going to find any weapons? CORRECT What in the world were they asking us about weapons for when we're out walleye fishing? - Do you have any alcohol in the boat? NO - Do you have any alcohol at the cabin? YES - How much alcohol do you have at the cabin? WE HAVE SOME BEER AND SOME WHISKEY - How many beers at the cabin? NOT SURE, DIDN""T COUNT. LESS THAN 48. - So, you have no idea how much beer you have? WE BROUGHT 48, WE HAVE CONSUMED SOME THIS WEEK. - 48 beers per person? NO, 48 TOTAL FOR OUR PARTY OF 6. - Do the other 4 people have alcohol in the boat? NOT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE - So, they may have alcohol in the boat? NOT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE While fishing in a 14' aluminum boat with NO storage anywhere... - Are the fish on the stringer yours? YES - What are they? THREE WALLEYE - Who caught them? I CAUGHT ONE, MY PARTNER CAUGHT THE OTHER TWO * They measure the fish, all is fine * - Which of you caught which walleye? NOT SURE, THEY AREN'T ON THE STRINGER ANYMORE. - Why do you only have three walleye? WE DON'T NEED MORE, OTHERS KEEPING A COUPLE TOO. - How may fish do they have? NO IDEA - How do we know you're not over the limit? WE ARE UNDER OUR LIMIT IN THIS BOAT - So, the others may be over their limit? I'M SURE THEY ARE UNDER THEIR LIMIT TOO. - How can you be sure, you said you don't know how many fish they have? It was a real comedy show (for us). The guys were a joke and the pilot was just shaking his head in disbelief. It was obvious that they were looking for any reason to hassle us. It was weird - we were 75 miles from the closest civilization. Outfitter requested that fish not be flown out, we didn't care because we ate fish once a day while there so we had our fill over a weeks time. In talking to the outfitter, this was not unusual for the MNR at the time - he had similar stories from other guests. Both times we had evidence that our camp had been accessed (including going into the cabin) while we were away. We are assuming it was the MNR even though they didn't mention it. This was 15-20 years ago now, but we still bring it up every couple of years. Scott"
6260478,wantabigone,2018-11-15 11:47:00,39,"I am in agreement Chris. This is an inefficient use of money and resources. For those that think spending thousands a day. (plane rental, fuel for plane, Pilot fees and the wages of the numerous officers on this plane) so be it. This thread was not to bash that officers are checking fishermen, this is not the case. It is the wasteful way it is being done. If I owned a business and were tracking my costs this would drive me crazy. As I have mentioned previously, the cost of having 2 officers drive to the float plane locations and check each load that comes off the plane is much more cost effective. Someone mentioned that this slows down the loading and unloading at base. Why? Simply wait for all gear to be removed from wagon by cars (which we all do anyway) and then check the coolers and such before they are loaded in the vehicles. Easy check, quick. Only delay is to the customers about to hit the road. If all checks out okay a delay of at most a half hour. Having said this.... I have been to a lake where the lodge owner did allow duffel bags to be filled with over the limit fish. This was not an outpost but a camp with many cabins. Whether these groups tried to take all these fish out I do not remember and if officers had indeed come by they could have issued many tickets and have put a stop to this. Not by us though as we did not go over our limit-we never do. In this unique (I hope) situation the main fault lies with the camp manager not putting a stop to this. (main fault really was in the groups thinking that filling the duffel bag was the goal for the week). I do doubt that this sort of thing happens in remote single cabins and if it does the officers can easily catch them at the float plane base. It was also mentioned that Fridays are the day most fishermen will be over the limit. Now I will really fire some of you up..... The scenario being that the group has caught their limit of fish and have frozen them for the return trip. The group now decides they would like to eat one last fish dinner prior to leaving the next day. By law any fish kept at this point is breaking the law as they have their frozen fish limit in the freezer. These are remote lakes with little fishing pressure. Would 3 fish for each 2 people crash the fishery? This is the purpose of these limits-correct? I don't know the answer to this. I imagine that it is possible on some lakes, most of these fly-in lakes would not be effected. Particularly single cabin lakes. I would be curious to know how often tickets have been issued for over fishing by using a float plane into these remote areas per year. I can imagine that if a group were out in a boat and when they see a float plane coming down and they were over their limit all they would have to do is release stringer from boat and let them sink prior to the float plane reaching them. Obviously the cabin over limit would be successful. To recap. I agree that officers need to check. It just should be done in a cost effective way where there is a better chance to catch over harvesting of fish. To all those officers out there-keep up the good work. Let the comments commence!"
6267928,MrSimon,2018-12-11 06:44:00,922,"Every single time I have ever been checked, the officers focus almost entirely on if we have alcohol in the boat. They search everything, sniff our water bottles, and rummage through any garbage. Then, almost as an after thought, they check our fish and make sure we have the proper safety gear. I guess after rescuing lots of drunk people, and recovering dead bodies, they take drinking in boats pretty seriously. I can't say I blame them."
6268070,Mojo-NC,2018-12-11 13:25:00,1929,"We've been checked on several occasions, but more often than not we do not get checked on a given year. As a matter of fact, it has been several years since we've been checked. One year the DNR checked us while we were out on the water. They then came back to camp and checked the freezers in the cleaning house to make sure everything was packaged and labeled properly. The wardens hung around and watched us clean a few fish and even joked around with us. I'm sure they were observing the sizes of the fish we cleaned and were doing their counts, but I think they also made the determination that we were not doing anything illegal and they were very cool. I'm sure it also helped that the camp has a good reputation. They did not enter our cabins and check the refrigerators for fish filets. Considering that we have anywhere from 8 - 14 guys spread out over several cabins on any given year and we do almost all of the cooking from one cabin, that's probably a good thing. I've got nothing but good things to say about the wardens that we have dealt with over the years and no one in our group has ever been ticketed. They've never searched our boat or harassed us in any way. I think one guy forgot his license and ID but they allowed him to get it out of his cabin and then they were fine. They just reminded him to carry it with him at all times."
6268134,Golden Eagle,2018-12-11 17:05:00,2642,"It's an overkill, but I carry a copy of Outdoors Card and copy of current license in my billfold, tackle box and truck."
6268322,MrSimon,2018-12-12 09:11:00,922,"That's not overkill, it's a good idea! I bought the ten year license here in PA. I printed out about 20 copies and have them stashed everywhere ... one in every boat, tackle box, tackle bag, car, truck, and wallet."
6268334,BornToFish,2018-12-12 09:35:00,1224,"Greetings, Mojo mentioned something that resonated with me: the reputation of the lodge and the lodge owner/manager. I have no problem whatsoever when the lodge owners (of the camp that we fish at) have a conversation with someone that is violating or even stretching the laws of Ontario. I am referring to things like keeping oversize fish, fishing multiple lines, keeping fish over their limit, or helping someone else fill their limit. I sincerely believe that the word will get out if a lodge owner knowingly allows such practices to take place at his/her fishing lodge. I am pretty sure that the MNR will ride a camp if they suspect that a lodge owner is allowing illegal practices to take place. My wife and I prefer to not be bothered by others (such as the MNR) when we are out on the lake. In our opinion, a lodge owner that knowingly allows violations to take place is doing a dis-service to my wife and me, as well as others at the lodge. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I personally won't visit a lodge again if I know violations are taking place and it wasn't addressed by the lodge owner once they were informed. I don't need the hassle of camp visits because other guests aren't willing to follow the regs. I paid to take a vacation and not attend a sideshow at the circus. PjShorthorn
6263070,Slim03,2018-11-25 13:03:00,159,The limit is for 24 hours not day by day. So if you ate 4 the night before and had 4 on the stringer yep you are over. Part of our group had that explained to them when they were getting a ticket for the empty beer cans from shore lunch and a couple cold ones in the cooler. Oh and no we were not over the limit anyways and no one was intoxicated.
6263078,stjoeguy,2018-11-25 13:39:00,979,"That doesn't sound right to me, at least not for Ontario. Where is a 24 hour limit described in the regulations? Using that logic if you ate 4 fish at 6:00PM Thursday you wouldn't be able to keep any more fish until 6:01PM Friday. The only place I see hours indicated in the Ontario regulations is defining an 8 day license: 8-day fishing licences are valid for eight consecutive calendar days. A calendar day is a 24-hour period starting at 12:00 midnight."

6263130,kzoofisher,2018-11-25 16:18:00,5144,The MNR is empowered to perform field surgery in order to verify the contents of your stomach. Best idea is never to eat fish two days in a row but if you do be sure to keep your filet knife sharp so you minimize the scarring when you get checked. The above is 100% true. I did not make it up. Check it out on Facebook if you don't believe me.

It's nerve wracking when they show up to check you over because even if you're doing the right thing, there's a myriad of rules/regs/laws that are tough to know all of inside out and you just hope you haven't missed anything. At the end of the day though you're happy they're out there because they're keeping the real dirtbags in line when they catch them with 100+ fish etc. Yes, that happens with shocking regularity and would happen far more if there were no CO drop ins."
6267860,nosvalves,2018-12-10 19:08:00,2,This thread is interesting. I've been drive in fishing in northern Ontario for the best part of 45 years. Started when I was a small child. We've been checked a number of times over the years. Some of the CO's were okay and other were real standoffish.... acted like were stone criminals. One thing I can say that really makes me scratch my head. Where I've went everyone drinks beer in the boats. Never had a CO or even the OP out of White River even mention it as problem to us. I don't get it have things changed that much in the last couple years? I have not been up since 2015. I'm headed back this year and this will really suck. A nice cold beer is great while your fishing.

LOL It works like this,for maximum bang for your buck,a spot ck will allow the ministry to interact with far more individuals and it would be a very powerful deterrent.And I personally would not enjoy having to unload and re load and the time involved if the CO did not believe I was in total compliance.Especially when you have a 10 to 14 hr drive ahead. On the other hand,if I was in a boat in the middle of nowhere and a yellow plane came at low altitude over the tree tops full of 007 wannabees ,I would find it entertaining and always being in compliance would not bother me as much as a half hr delay at a spot ck. And statistically due to the vast size of northern Ontario is less likely to happen. Especially since I've been there a few times already (while over limits are in coolers driving down a dirt road) So yes,spend more $$ interacting with less people.And less people includes me. I think the common denominator as far as how you will be treated by decent CO's is the presence of alcohol in a boat and lack of safety items. I believe if you have your act together in that dept you will be viewed as an individual who is not likely to be in violation of fish and game rules. Where,if you are trying to talk your way out of lack of a throw rope and the beers are for shore lunch, you may be viewed as an individual who may also think what's an extra couple of fish when we are catching hundreds.

One day a few years ago, the MNR showed up at our door about 4pm. We were just hanging around drinking having some fun. The CO wanted to see our fish. All we had were some leftover fried fillets from the night before. It was a mix of pike and walleye. Not more than a couple of fish. I wonder if they have ever pulled some crap saying someone is over the limit based on leftover fried fillets that are totally unidentifiable! I did enjoy showing him pics of the 48 inch musky I caught the day before! He liked them too. 99.5% of us play by the rules.

But if I was a CO,I would much rather be flying in a plane in pristine northern ontario than I would be on the bank of a crowded river surrounded by people snagging and littering .So many violations you would not know where to start. What they did in port hope is they went undercover and nailed a whole bunch of people.But not until multiple complaints from the city and true sportsmen. This was shooting fish in a barrel for the ministry.I guess it went neglected to the point of being ridiculous because it was too easy and not as much fun as sneaking up on people in remote locations.

Or can I just say they were eelpout in my belly."

6261244,fsz,2018-11-18 17:50:00,144,"Shortly after the spring bear hunt was cancelled years ago, we were checked one spring along the highway. We had a cheap cooler that didn't have a lot of insulation that had the fish. My brothers duffel bag was right next to it. When the one CO took the bag out, a different CO felt it was cold but wasn't paying attention to its location. The second CO then yells ""he Joe, I think we have a gall bladder here"". The proceed to shake all contents out of his bag, looking for a gall bladder from an illegally harvested bear (bear parts are often sold on the black market in Asia). The entire stop took an hour. I don't blame the CO's- I blame the MNR. The CO's weren't born that way, they were trained that way by the agency. Flying into outposts for nickel-dime violations, arguing about minnows etc...all goes back to the MNR authorization."
6261246,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-18 18:09:00,8293,"Every year we hear and read about game & fish violations. This with the Co's ability to drop in out of the sky with no notice. Can you imagine the violations if everybody knew they couldn't or wouldn't hit remote area's? I understand the cost vs return but only if you don't factor in the damage to the resources. Me personally, I have no problem with them dropping in. He77, in 20 years they will beam in the way Scotty & Kirk did."
6261338,MrSimon,2018-11-19 09:01:00,922,"I did some actual research by reading the reports published by the MNR. There is some fascinating information in there about what the MNR is doing in Ontario ... cool stuff. Anyway, here are some actual numbers. Recreational fishing contributes $2.2 billion to the Ontario economy each yearOntario resident fishing license sales produce $36 million in annual revenueNon-resident Ontario fishing license sales produce $19 million in annual revenueThe MNR spends $13 million annually on conservation officers and enforcementOf the $13 million spent on conservation and enforcement, $3 million was spent on field operationsThe MNR's annual operating budget is $734 million So, 0.41% of the MNR's annual budget is spent on ""field operations"". And non-resident fishing licenses alone bring in 6 times that amount annually. Saying that bush checks is ""a waste of taxpayer money"" just isn't valid. They aren't funded by Ontario taxpayers. Not even close. If you think the TIME AND EFFORT spent on bush checks could be better used elsewhere .... that's at least a valid argument and is worth discussing."
6261342,MrSimon,2018-11-19 09:14:00,922,"One more thing. Ontario actually created a special account to make sure Fish & Wildlife revenue is used specifically for Fish & Wildlife activities. Meaning, Ontario resident taxes are not used to fund ANY Fish & Wildlife activity. More specifically .... COs, planes, dogs, snow machines etc. are 100% paid for by revenue from license sales and other sources of F&W revenue. Taken directly from the MNR report:"
6261344,vteye3,2018-11-19 09:15:00,496,TMG - exactly my thoughts. It also leads to a safer week. We were checked our first year in Ontario and don't mind. There is a lot less drinking in boats as a result. Boating and drinking just don't go hand in hand even with camp boats an 9.9's

It took these guys a lot of work and years to get the ""facts""https://lfpress.com/2016/10/01/south...4-65a2073d31a2 This is why I totally object to the waste of money regarding remote fly ins and otherwise. It's not run like a business at all."
6261536,v-bay gord,2018-11-19 19:46:00,3168,"The amount of money generated by tourism in NW Ontario from non resident anglers, and the related license money (far more than generated in the rest of the province) warrants the money spent on enforcing regulations even in remote fly in situations (of which we have a substantial amount of remote tourism locations). Perhaps that is a better business decision if you consider those facts. I'm not disputing the claims made in your reference....there can always be improvements to the way government spends our money."
6260512,uv2021,2018-11-15 14:12:00,48,"Three times I have been in the middle of nowhere in the winter and got totally checked out by the ministry with dogs and opp officers in tow. First time we were 50 kms away from the nearest road.We were ice fishing.nobody around for miles and miles.Out of nowhere 4 snow machines. 2 co's 1 opp and one special Indian constable.The co's had a fish smelling dog that traveled in a crate on the back of the snow machine. So,4 machines,one dog.Do the math.For what? So they could see my fishing licence and ask a few questions .The dog sniffed all around the place to see if I had any fish hidden in the snow. Ok,all is good.50 kms away is lake temagami. With all kinds of huts and a bunch of lodges that offer ice fishing.Think how many people they could have checked if they did not spend about 6 hrs getting to me. They came back two years later!! Same group.Hey guys remember me? lol Another time,we were ice fishing.We were two hrs out of Cochran on lake abitibi in April.We were the only ones in the remote camp we were at.Even the lodge owners had left.We were to find our own way out.It was april,still 3 ft of ice up there,it was warm during the day,5/6 degrees celcius,raining a bit off and on. We were there for 5 nights.One day,way the heck out on the ice( as if we weren't remote enough) we see way on the other side some snow machines.We just figured we weren't the only crazy ones still out fishing. One turns towards us and makes their way over.It's a CO.How you doing guys..... fine.Thank you.Usual questions.He was reasonable. Then the other 3 machines come over and one of them is a real ********. They also have a dog.Sniffs all over the place looking for fish.We were well within our legal limit and size. We were catching walleye,saugers and BIG PIKE ,largest was a 44.All pike of course went back. We are allowed two lines while ice fishing.So we have a set line and a jigging rod on the go. Now,my friend always has a second rod rigged in case he gets stripped he can change up right away.He has two holes side by side.Two jigs and a minnow on each.The one minnow was in the water,the other was out of the water,by the hole waiting to get dunked if needed. So the CO's dog decides to pick up the minnow and jig in its mouth .lucky for the dog one of the co's grabbed it before the dog set the hook on himself. Well,wouldn't you know it,the minnow after being warmed up in the dogs mouth springs back to life.You know,if ice fishing you can put a fish on the ice and a half hr later it still decides to flop around? And it was plus 5.so things were not freezing to death. That prick CO spent at least 30 minutes badgering my friend to get him to confess to using two rods ( plus his set line) We tried to explain the minnow was only alive because of it laying in the slush and 5 degree temps. He would not quit. They finally left,only to drive to an island about a half mile away,crawl up the bank behind the island pull out the binnocks and started watching us.We had the binnocks back on them. I mooned them and then they took off LOL. But it pisses me off as a taxpayer that all that time and money was spent on us. A spot ck on the only road in,or even on a snowmobile trail would create an opportunity for far more checks. So flying planes into the bush to ck on people.Driving for hrs in the winter to ck on very remote ice fisherman is a very inefficient use of resources. They don't eve have to set up at the seaplane bases in Nakina.The road into Nakina is perfect for a quick look and see.And you have no choice but to take that road. You would be sending a much stronger message if a poacher thought their vehicle could be seized it may make them think twice.That is what you call a deterrent. As far as alcohol in the boats,if you are smart you just won't do that.If you are dumb and get drunk in a 14 ft aluminum boat in the middle of nowhere you know what can happen and it should not be my tax $$ saving you from yourself."
6260640,tv4fish,2018-11-16 05:12:00,2694,"IMO - There have been some VERY good points brought up in this thread. I really agree with the above quote. Why is it that ""we"" taxpayers have to ""foot the bill"" for some of these similar rescues???? Good ole' ""personal responsibility"" has apparently gone the same way as ""common sense""?? Kind of like mountain climbing - Why should taxpayers have to pay for somebody wanting to take the risk of doing that and then they have to get rescued by helicopter -- IMO - THEY took the risk --- THEY should have to pay for the rescue............"

6257940,Pooch,2018-11-04 15:26:00,4618,"Checks at the dock would work, but really screw up turnaround of guests by the outfitter. As long as there are occasional checks at remote camps that should be enough to keep (most) folks honest. Too bad folks don't always have the personal integrity to do what is right, regardless of the law. We've been checked several times over the years at remote camps. Plane flies in checks that camp then boats to others local camps to do compliance checks.Checking guys on the water seems to be mostly pro-active awareness. Kind of like the marked squad car setting on an overpass shooting radar at oncoming traffic. Preventative maintenance. Is that also wasted money? Not really IMO. Traffic calming? Probably.Pooch"
6257946,Ozark Bob,2018-11-04 16:08:00,5240,"I doubt half of the ""random"" fly-out lake visits are that. I have overheard resort owners mention tipping off the officers if they have a party that they have witnessed heavy coolers in the past or a pilot noticed more fish than looked proper on fly out checks. Beside the conservation situation if overharvest hurts the lake, business will also suffer. Sorry to say there are more cheaters than we care to admit. JMHO Bob"
6258052,Bill Krejca,2018-11-05 07:51:00,6107,"It is not uncommon for limit checks to be made on Friday afternoons. The temptation to have a last fish meal and still go home the next day with their limit has made several hours of over-the-limit a reality for numerous fishers, whether far into the bush, as well as at drive-to camps. My guess is that a majority of violations occur on this day. The potential for being aware of potential checks, even in fly-ins, I'd guess, justifies drop-in visits by the officers. Bill"
6258076,vteye3,2018-11-05 09:00:00,496,"We were checked on last day in camp. It was our second trip to Ontario. Our outfitter told us it could happen and said if we got caught with illegal fish, booze on the boat it could end our trip right then and there. We listened. We have no problem abiding by the f &W laws. No beers on the boat was sobering but we adjusted and love fishing Ontario."
6258202,phishfearme,2018-11-05 14:28:00,1242,"frequently, MNR checks in remote fly in outposts are associated with forest fire inspections. this happened to us once - we were the only people for miles but a plane landed and the officer was trying to identify when we were where with respect to where they think a fire started. he (don maw) checked all our boats and the cabin for fish and licenses. he called us gentlemen then we took him back to the waiting plane and he was off. phish"
6259052,NM_Trout,2018-11-08 22:26:00,1094,"Speaking of a waste of tax $$$$, we were on a lake NW of Redlake when lightning sparked a forest fire. We watched three CL417 (?) water bombers scoop water off the lake for 2 or 3 hours, only to put the fire 95% out and fly off. Next day it blew up again as though they never even worked the fire. I can't help but wonder what an hour of air time for that plane cost."
6259112,MrSimon,2018-11-09 07:58:00,922,"Fly-in guests pump a LOT of money into the Canadian economy. Probably well over $20 million per year. That revenue provides thousands of jobs for Canadians and helps fund government programs like the MNR, including paying the COs and the pilots. Doing spot checks on bush camps seems like an excellent way to spend that money. It promotes following the laws, keeps outfitters honest, helps with safety, and shows a general law enforcement presence in the area."
6259436,CCRet,2018-11-10 18:54:00,128,"I envy the CO's getting to use the ultimate bush plane. Throughout my career when responding to an emergency call at Adrenalin induced speeds, in the back of my mind was the knowledge that I was operating a vehicle on tires that both were low bid purchases. I am surprised at the statement Costs nearly 1500$ an hour , my understanding that for a commercial operation to make a profit, $1000.00 an hour is closer to the cost. That includes all expenses, including the pilot. Are the 1500 you speak of, metric dollars?.... BTW, I truly believe in the old saying:Laws, regulations and rules without enforcement are mere suggestions."
6259876,fishmanric,2018-11-13 04:47:00,219,"In my forty years plus of fishing Ontario, I have been checked just about every way possible. Outposts, houseboats, boat ins and drive ins. Not once have I met a rude officer or officers in some instances. This past year was even crazier when customs decided to check our car at the boarder. My wife who brings everything including the kitchen sink had our Enclave packed to the gills. I told them to be careful when opening the doors and got a funny look. They realized I wasn't kidding. Once they were finished one of the officers said, I think it's time for a truck and we both laughed. I told them I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my Canadian fishing trips."
6260342,chris.brock,2018-11-14 23:20:00,112,"Wrong, you're missing the point. Inefficiency and wasteful spending is the issue. While these COs and cops are flying around trying to check people in remote northern regions, the creeks, rivers, dams etc of the south, accessible by car, are a circus, a free for all, infractions and broken laws galore, and not a law enforcement officer to be seen."
6257730,Lake Of The Woods,2018-11-03 14:54:00,124,"Worked for the MNR in Kenora during the 80's. Started off First Fire Fighting and over the ten years served some time with the Forestry,Northern Development & Mines and Provincial Parks Departments(Rushing River). I was then going to transition into the Fish & Wildlife section and spent some time going on patrols with a couple Conservation Officers. Unfortunately the late 1980's was hit hard with provincial MNR cutbacks and the opportunity to pursue the occupation came to a screeching halt. I can tell you that many fisherman and hunters have had their activities observed without even knowing it. In my experience on these patrols it was revealed that about 95% of the time the persons being approached by the CO's were in 100% compliance with the regulations. Then there is the other 5% that could get down right defensive and nasty,... especially when alcohol is part of the equation. It can get fairly nerve racking when there is a spirited discussion going on with hunters who show signs of impairment and holding high powered rifles. I know a CO who has been involved in more than one sting operation trying to gather evidence and take down some notorious big game poaching operations in Northwestern Ontario. The stories are of white knuckle intensity in some cases. I do vividly remember that back in 1987-88 the MNR took down a rather large big game poaching operation where the guilty party was bringing guests into an area to illegally hunt black bear and moose. These guests were mainly from Europe and were paying very high prices to trophy hunt out of season. The MNR co-ordinated the big bust one July day and took down the illegal operation. That afternoon 6 five ton trucks rolled into the MNR base loaded with boats & motors, dismantled aircraft, prospector tents, wood stoves, ATV's, rifles, ammunition and other odds and ends used a evidence. I didn't see it but apparently there was also a refrigerated truck that contained the illegal big game. Interestingly it was not the first time this individual had been busted for such activities,... you can't fix stupid! One very good thing other than catching the culprits that materialized due to all the MNR confiscations was the fall auctions they would hold each fall. You could bid on any number of the hundreds of firearms, boats, vehicles, fishing gear, camping gear, etc., and usually only pay 1/4 to 1/3 of their value. Occasionally present where those who had their equipment taken by the MNR trying to buy it back,... that was always very entertaining to watch them sweat and try to buy their items for a second time, lol. It was a smart idea when the Provincial government decided to allow CO's to carry a handgun as the occupation has unfortunately become just as high risk as that of a police officer at times.However, in my opinion they are still too much under staffed to patrol the vast Ontario wilderness and catch all the poachers."
6257760,chris.brock,2018-11-03 20:14:00,112,"I've never been checked on a fly in.That said, planes are very expensive. I think it's stupid and a waste of tax payer's money for COs to fly into a camp to check for infractions. The COs could meet out coming groups at the dock or stop them on the road heading out of town. Typical gov't wasteful stupidity."
6257776,CCRet,2018-11-03 22:49:00,128,"All through my career I heard complaints about how the State was wasting taxpayer dollars by using quality, safe and efficient equipment. Also whining about the fortune that we were making, when actually if broken down to $$$ paid for hours put in on our way of life, we would qualify for public assistance. In my State, the Game Warden's funding all comes from License sales, Coast Guard funding, and some gasoline tax monies. Nothing comes from our General Funds which are generated by the State Income Tax (no sales tax here). I would point out that the State is a non-profit organization when hearing these complaints. Usually the individuals that whined the most about the waste of money to check a fishing or hunting license were the ones that complained the most about Law Enforcement agencies being used as revenue collecting agency because they are out there issuing citations to the criminals. They also were probably the first ones to cry about ""never a cop around when ya need one""."
