6174465,Larry S,2018-05-05 07:57:00,665,"Just a thought Spoonchucker The website which might be the Past Owners says they will make arrangements and purchase your food for your group. Did you ask about this? Other wise ,if you have the time you can send a food order in and take a cab to store to pickup. Have a Great trip and Please Post a report . I live in Las Vegas and would be interested in maybe going next year with BTHOMAS on a trip there Larry S"
6267486,spoonchucker,2018-12-09 14:52:00,82,Finally have some downtime. I want to thank Darren for putting us on to Mrs Groceries. Did an amazing job. Delivered right to airport and all food was fresh and well packed in boxes. Cold and frozen foods she packed in insulated cooler bags she bought at Walmart I believe. Transwest took all boxes up on flight to Stony rapids and there is no charge per checked number of bags or boxes. Fed 11 guys for 5 days at a cost of less than 100$ a man canadian including her fee. Thought so much of her service we will use her again for our trip to Reilly Lake outpost this year.
6169121,spoonchucker,2018-05-02 10:19:00,82,Flying in to outpost from Stony Rapids. Flight from Saskatoon to Stony is not chartered but regular scheduled. Need grocer who will fill order for eleven of us and deliver to Saskatoon Airport where we can meet him and take to Transwest Air check in to load. We fly in to Saskatoon from Toronto on same day we fly out to Stony. ANy thoughts?
6169201,Darrenf442,2018-05-02 11:08:00,1369,Superstore has a service you can shop online and pay for it. Then when you show up they bring it outside. See if a taxi will deliver it to the airport. There is a super store about 10 minutes from the airportI live in Saskatoon. Ill see if anyone else does it.https://www.realcanadiansuperstore.c...180502170751:s
6169241,Darrenf442,2018-05-02 11:23:00,1369,Ive never heard of these guyshttp://saskatoon.mrsgrocery.com/https://www.kijiji.ca/b-services/sas.../k0c72l1700197
6169249,spoonchucker,2018-05-02 11:24:00,82,Thanks Darren - I appreciate it. Going up to Misekumaw and ownership changed this year so not using chartered flights where fly direct to float plane base . We want to be sure we get to label boxes so they don't end up in La Ronge etc at stops on way up to Stony. Concerned too that if just dropped off at Hangar might not get loaded on our flight and 11 guys at outpost without food reminds me of a certain novel....
6169273,Darrenf442,2018-05-02 11:31:00,1369,"Or not sure but if you had anytime there are a couple grocery stores within 10 mins of the airport a Co-op Address: 1624 33rd Street West, Saskatoon, SK and a Supertore Address: 411 Confederation Dr, Saskatoon, SK ( its a big store ). Grab a cab go shop grab a cab back.If you had 90 minutes it could get done, not sure you can ever leave."
6169297,bthomas3333,2018-05-02 11:54:00,465,Interesting. Did Milton Lake Lodge sell Misekumaw? The website still shows the pricing as including flights from Saskatoon. Just interested to see if there is another outfitter on Misekumaw or if it was sold out of Milton Lake Lodge outposts.brett
6169361,jambi,2018-05-02 12:26:00,504,Curious as well. I had this on my radar as a hopeful trip in 2019.
6169409,spoonchucker,2018-05-02 12:48:00,82,"Milton was sold this year- we had signed up with Maxine but David DeCorte bought it. He seems like he will be a good steward and has been responsive but I am sure there are some kinks to work out. Apparently they could not work out a charter for my group and the dates we had agreed to with Maxine. I will let you know how this all works out, right now I have my faith in him doing his best to succeed- especially after my son talked with Mike Borger and Mike feels it will be an improvement."
6169425,spoonchucker,2018-05-02 12:51:00,82,I should indicate the airfare to Stony is part of the package and he is fully honoring the price quote from Maxine.
6170009,bthomas3333,2018-05-02 19:17:00,465,Excellent. Please post a trip report when you get back. I am very interested in fishing Misekumaw one of these years. Not sure I can get a large enough group. Is 4 the min or 6? Nice to hear they are covering the flight to Stony. That can be pricey.Great water I am sure it will be an awesome trip!B-
