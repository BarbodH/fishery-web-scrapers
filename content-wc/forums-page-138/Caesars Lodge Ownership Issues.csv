6251296,Jeepguy43,2018-10-04 09:31:00,1,"Hi Guys...long time Quebec fisherman here...have used AIR Melancon cabins/outfitter for many years. They were recently sold to Air Tamarac. Looking to gain any info on Caesars north camps private lakes. i.e. walleye size and frequency, pike size, what lake is best of my initial visit with Caesars north camps. I have a friend who went to little benny lake and reported very good fishing. any other thoughts?Randy"
6253522,chris.brock,2018-10-15 11:17:00,112,Interesting about the sale. We fished Simard and were satisfied with the fishing. The appeal of Simard is the adjacent portage lakes which might not be everyone's cup of tea.
6267484,CABLEGUY,2018-12-09 14:36:00,15,Has anyone been to Ceasars north camps lately. Looking for good trophy pike water with some walleye for shore lunch. What lake is best for trophy pike? Any info pls
1418502,vteye,2012-04-09 13:21:00,812,Good luck Oliver - I hope you regain the success that you formerly had. My extended family has been fishing that area for 40 years and looking forward to a trip in 2013. Quebec is a days drive for most of us east coast types a heck of a lot closer than NW Ontario and the famed waters of that region. I checked the website fly in for less than a $1000 per man.

1424611,octanehi5,2012-04-22 10:49:00,1104,"The gouin is a great fishery, no matter what outfitter you go with. Hope you have a great trip. If you have problems I can send you another outfitters name just send me a PM. But give your present outfitter a chance to give you the service that he sold you."
1424660,5 of Diamonds,2012-04-22 12:17:00,151,I think you're going to have a great trip! Olivier will work hard for you. I don't believe you've got anything to worry about other than what lure to use. Look forward to hearing about your trip when complete. Safe travels & good luck!
1425084,vteye,2012-04-23 09:52:00,812,"Ask Oliver for locations, I am sure you will find fish. We do well trollingbottom bouncers & rapalas and once we find the fish switch over to jigging. There is a lot of pike water husky jerks, Long A's, have been goodto us over the years."
1431625,kegisfly,2012-05-06 19:52:00,22,"My group (just 2 of us this year) will be in that area july 4 thru 10 with Air Tamarac. I believe yours is the camp near Plamondon Bay on the Gouin? You have a long trip planned. I am jealous. Maybe we can get together and share some knowledge during that time. If that is the area you will be in, I can try to help some. I have been traveling to the Gouin for 3 years now, but there are others on this board who have been visiting it for decades. You can probably search ""gouin"" on the message board and get some info or PM me. You should be able to easily find some good fishing on the Gouin. Have a good trip, Kirk"
1431731,a3dad,2012-05-07 06:20:00,115,Yes Caesar's Gouin 1 is the camp at the very north end of Plamondon (Ruisseau/Creek) where as Air Tamarac is on the west side. Easy distance to travel if you wanted to meet up. I've done this route many times. Freefall: During summer you will probably need to head into the main lake to find deeper water. I checked my maps and the deepest holes in the creek area is 5m (at full capacity). The water in the reservoir may be low this year. If so you may have a difficult time getting to the bay as there is a very narrow and shallow passage at the end of there creek. Check with Oliver as to the conditions as you get closer.
2493962,Guest,2014-02-26 19:02:00,0,"I spent a great week at the North camps years ago and Oliver was our pilot and he is a first class guy. He pulled a 48"" long pike I could barely lift up out of the float plane pontoon to show me and I had never seen one that big. I am sure if Oliver is involved it is ok! I hope to see Oliver at the RCC show tomorrow in Suffern NY. Kevin K."
2862689,Guest,2014-06-03 14:15:00,0,"I have been to several of the Caesar camps over the years. The first two with Benny and Anita (a first class operation, followed by Olivier 3 times, again a first class operation. The fishing was always fun, and productive. We were always treated as their ""only customer"" which was a nice touch. I had the unfortunate experience of booking under George four years ago. This trip was mismanaged from the time we arrived at the main lodge to the time we flew out. Since then I have gone to two other fly in camps. Both we were just treated as business. Cool reception, a drop off pick up, and done attitude. I have tried to convince my group to return to Caesar's and because of the last ""poor experience"" to put it nicely, no one was willing to agree. After speaking to Olivier at the 2014 Sportsman's show in Buffalo, New York I have been able to convince every one to return to the North Camps. I would urge every one to separate George from Olivier. If you have any inhibitions of a trip to Caesar's rest assured Olivier will provide the quality and attention to detail you would expect. Wayne Buffalo, New York."

1154825,Esox Angler,2009-12-17 20:26:00,102,"Hello Boys,Esox Angler here. I want to inform all board members of the recent developments regarding ownership/management of Caesars Lodge Quebec.The former Owner, Olivier, is again in charge of ""Northern outposts"" with George Jr. in charge of main lodge and ""local Outposts"". I was contacted by phone and email and informed of these developments. Apparently, Air Mont Laurier was contracted last season to run flights, but will not be doing so this season. I have a trip scheduled for this season, but my party members and I are no longer 100% after this information is now fact. I will be in touch with Caesars again next week and will keep you all informed to the best of my ability.EA"
1155650,Esox Angler,2009-12-22 18:32:00,102,"Since my party has a trip scheduled for a Northern Outpost, we will be dealing directly with Olivier. We were instructed to drive directly to Parent, QC where we will be airlifted to our outpost. Which means taking the F-250, not a road for cars from what I understand. The Eastern Sports & Outdoor Show is scheduled for Feb 6-14 in Harrisburg, PA. We were supposed to be contacted by phone monday, but have not been as yet. So we will be discussing issues with both Olivier and George there in person. I will keep you posted.EA"
1385055,Olivier Brossard,2012-01-23 12:52:00,2,"I would like to take this opportunity to explain some of the history of these two outfits. My parents Benny and Anita Brossard started Caesar's Lodge over 40 years ago and built it into one of the nicest and most efficient outfitters in Quebec.When they wanted to retire in 1993, I, Olivier Brossard bought the outfit and kept the name Caesar's Lodge. I ran it for 13 years. During this time I married , had 2 children and decided to retire and spend more time with them, so I sold Caesar's Lodge to my cousin George Brossard, Jr.George has been the sole owner of the business since 2007, I was not involved, nor did I have any business connections with him after the change of ownership (we had a falling out). At the end of the 2009 season, George was having trouble taking care of this huge enterprise and meeting his financial obligations, so I got the 2 float planes back in lieu of final payment and decided to come out of retirement and bought all of the Trophy fishing lakes from him: Hanotaux, Nancy Lake, Bob Lake, Little Gouin, Super, Impossible, Simard, Larouche, Little Benny, Gouin 1, 2, 3, & 4 but only these lakes !So I started a new business in 2010 with my friend and long time pilot employee Jean-Lou Simard and we called it Caesar's North Camps & ETA Aviations Inc. ( I kind of kept the Caesar's part of the name in memory of all the great years I had in the past). Our buisness offers fly-in Trophy fishing trips for Walleye and Northern Pike as well as bear & moose hunting but only European plan ( no meals and no guides).Since I came back the satisfaction of our clientele at Caesar's North Camps is 100% and we spare no effort to make every client's vacation with us everything they wish for... I would like to say how sorry I am ,for the troubles you have had if you booked a trip with George and Caesar's Lodge in 2011. We as part of Quebec's Outfitters know that something like this, is terrible for all our businesses as well as the reputation of our province.I don't really know what is happening with George, nor do I know if he had a heart attack this past spring and I can not reach him on any phone line either, which as you probably already know, have all been cut. What I do know is that Caesar's Lodge is officially closed down, due to management problems on his part and will not re-open in the future.If you had a deposit with George for the season 2011 and you wish to book with us, we will be happy to discuss arrangements including the possilbity of a better price for you. I am doing this becuase I really beleive that what happened to you is not right nor fair and it saddens me greatly that the name Caesar's Lodge which my parent's and I worked so hard on, has been turned into something that is giving people bad memories instead of great ones...I hope to have the chance to serve you soon and show you a really great fishing or hunting vacation in Quebec, Canada.Sincerely yours,Olivier Brossard"
1385447,doubleheader,2012-01-24 10:49:00,2652,And that boys and girls is what you call a professional.
1385457,bloom08,2012-01-24 11:18:00,13,"I have nothing but great things to say about Olivier. I went to Caesars Lodge when he ran it and went back to Caesars North Camps in 2010 when Olivier starting running his new business. I have never had a bad experience dealing with Olivier, and he has made many updates to his cabins and continues to do so. Every outpost camp that i have experienced, that Olivier has since takin over, I have caught fish. I have been to Mattawa (but don't think they have a camp there anymore), Nancy 1x, Bob Lake 4x, Gouin 1...1x... and this year i am booked with 3 others to go to Little Benny from July 12th to July 19th. He has also opened a new V.I.P camp this year for people to fish. Mike Lelko"
1386896,Esox Angler,2012-01-27 21:49:00,102,"I hope everyone is satisfied with Olivier's clear explanation. Myself and members of my party have always had outstanding experiences with him & Jean-Lou. I wish them the best. When I return to QC, you best believe it will be be with Caesars North.~EA"
1415981,Guest,2012-04-03 17:01:00,0,"Oliver, It has been too many years since we have seen each other and enjoyed a good challenging game of darts my friend! I am glad to hear things are going well for you, I also am guessing that you and Nancy are the proud parents? It is too bad about Caesars Lodge, it was a great place that I, my sons Joey and James and also my friend Scottie Beller enjoyed many years at, the service and hospitality that was shown to us by yourself and Nancy and the rest of the staff could not be beaten by anyone. I am living in California right now but will be moving to North Carolina to be closer to my sons Joey and James and my granddaughter Gabriella by the end of 2012 so I will also be looking forward to some more trips to the Northern Outposts and seeing you and Nancy as well. I look forward to seeing and possibly hearing from you even sooner. You can reach me at [email protected], I would really enjoy hearing from you. Your friend, Joe Lynam"
1416058,polaris-pete,2012-04-03 19:50:00,343,"I haven't fished Quebec in many Years but after reading the post from the owner of Caesars North, I would definitely think about trying Quebec again in the future. This man is what all other outfitters should be like. Seems like a very honest outfitter and willing to help."
1417092,TroyMansfield,2012-04-06 00:09:00,92,"as an outfitter myself, my hat is off to Cesars North, couldnt be any more professional than with open public explanation, good work and good luck fishing"
1417698,octanehi5,2012-04-07 15:36:00,1104,"Time will tell,If you do not give your clients what you are selling they will not go back, I'm not saying he will or not, I wish caesar's north well. I know for a fact that he is on some good Lacs, He owns the camps on little Benny, that River from there runs into a lac that I fish every yr. Lac Hebert, the real name of Benny is petite lac Hebert.They are both walleye factories. I have never fished Lacs in northern Quebec that were any better.If I could not go to lac Hebert for what ever reason I would give him a try. GOOD LUCK Oliver"
