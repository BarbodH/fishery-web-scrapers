6258384,Mike Borger,2018-11-06 09:22:00,1554,"Hey guys, my son and I will be at Gangler's Bain Lake outpost camp in far northern Manitoba for two full weeks next year. July 27 - August 3, and August 3 - August 10.Bain is an INCREDIBLE piece of water with trophy fish of all 4 species available - pike, lake trout, arctic grayling and walleye. It's Gangler's largest outpost location. Bain combined with connected Belsham Lake offers more than 50 miles of navigable water. Along with that is adjacent Foord Lake, easily accessed via portage. It's an endless amount of water to fish in a week! It would be pretty great if some of my Walleye Central friends could join us. If you're interested contact me directly and let's chat!https://ganglers.com/home/bain-lake/"
6258442,That Minnesota guy,2018-11-06 11:52:00,8293,Will you be looking at two different groups of 7 days each or are you looking for people for the whole two weeks? Looks very interesting and like a nice camp. Is this a return trip (so you know the water) or just going in for the first time?
6258460,Mike Borger,2018-11-06 13:20:00,1554,"Yep different groups for each week. Have never fished Bain before but I don't look at that as a negative. I've fished Maria and Burnie previously with GanglerÂ”s and had incredible trips. Can't see Bain being any different. But it probably goes without saying, if someone joined me the second week I'd have plenty of fresh intel"
6258712,vteye3,2018-11-07 12:02:00,496,Mike - Sounds like a great trip and would enjoy watching/learning how you break down water. Bummer next summer does not work.
6266324,ManitowishWaters,2018-12-05 19:31:00,39,Spots still open?
6266354,Mike Borger,2018-12-05 20:40:00,1554,There sure is! The first week (July 27-August 3) is wide open. The second week (August 3-10) is booked.
6266458,Golden Eagle,2018-12-06 07:17:00,2642,Guys fishing the second week will be chasing USED fish. Lots will be caught and released during the first week.
6266724,Mike Borger,2018-12-06 16:06:00,1554,Hi Connie! Not sure about chasing used fish LOL! It's a pretty huge watershed. Gangler says it takes regular visitors 5 years to figure things out and fish the entire thing.If anything the guys coming the second week will have an advantage as I'll probably have a few patterns figured out by then.
6266876,Golden Eagle,2018-12-07 07:38:00,2642,You're right about a great second week. That's why it filled so quickly with smart fishermen.
6267138,Aspencreek,2018-12-08 06:17:00,2911,"Oh, now, isn't the old saying ""should have been here Last week!"
