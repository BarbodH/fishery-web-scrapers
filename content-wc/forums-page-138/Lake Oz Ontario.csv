6270618,RichA$1970,2018-12-20 19:25:00,1159,I am heading north by myself & single rates are hard to find. I want to fish St Joe but not having much luck for June for an outfitter. Anyone ever fish Lake Oz n do they also have the single barbless restrictions? If anyone has any other options for a single under $850 with a boat & motor. I am open and donâ€™t mind camping either that I am looking for walleyes n northerns. Thanks.
