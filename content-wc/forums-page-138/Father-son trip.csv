6269048,deuce50,2018-12-15 07:34:00,1,I want to take my 13-year-old son on a seven day trip this year.We will be going at the end of July. Looking for big pike but good walleye numbers. Housekeeping and I may or may not bring my boat. Been to Lac Seul and it was amazing but looking for something a little closer. I live in Kalamazoo Michigan.Any help would be appreciated.

6269142,jfaisten,2018-12-16 04:14:00,1060,I understand this is off the track a bit but you may want to consider red fish in Louisiana. They use walleye rods for 25# plus redfish. Fast CC boats and you can find a place with housekeeping. When we went we brought back a cooler full of redfish fillets. Big fun Good think to enjoy the time with your son regardless of where you go. Good luck
6269216,jackpotjohnny48,2018-12-16 12:19:00,153,"Based on your requirements for big pike, with some good walleye fishing mixed in, you may want to take a look at either Rainy Lake or Nungesser Lake. Note: I've never fished either of these lakes, as I primarily go to Canada to fish for muskies, but if I were looking for big pike in NW Ontario / Sunset Country, I think Rainy and Nungesser would be two of the ones I would look at. Wabaskang might be a good option, too. Or even some of that other stuff in the Red Lake area (Little Vermilion or Gullrock chain)."
