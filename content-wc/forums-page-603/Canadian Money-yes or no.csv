Also consider that the ""local establishment"" must deposit the U.S. $ into the ""local bank"" which converts it into Canadian $ with 3-4% tacked on to add to their profits (and cover their arse). So don't blame the local businesses for not wanting to take a 5% hit on every transaction where the customer wants to use a foreign currency. I think it is a good idea to have some Canadian cash along for those small purchases......or in the case where you are unable to use a credit card. You may want to look at the fees your credit card company is charging you as well.....many of them now charge you extra for the privledge of converting currencies."
575979,Obabikon,2008-07-12 10:46:00,2370,"Very few of the local stores that have to charge extra for exchange rates, make money on it. If they do... it's almost nothing after paying the fees and hastle of switching it back to canadian."
575980,Guest,2008-07-12 13:12:00,0,Never taken any Canadian and never will. Pay cash for beer in American and that's it. Need the points on my Cabela's card !!!!!!!!:)
576008,Hammerhead Herb,2008-07-13 17:49:00,259,"Something else to keep in mind is that VISA/MC charge 3% per transaction; however, American Express charges 2%. Not a big deal unless you charge the resort charges."
576009,Guest,2008-07-13 18:50:00,0,Check with your credit card provider to find out if they charge a fee for conversion from foreign currency to American dollars.
576018,Guest,2008-07-14 07:51:00,0,"I'm with v-bay, I always bring a couple hundred along for them smaller purchases, stopping in the local store, restaurants and tips, any place that may be geared more for locals than tourists, etc. Al"
575923,Hump,2008-07-10 10:26:00,578,Leaving in a couple of weeks to Lac Seul. Normally get a couple of hundred canadian money. Is it necessary this year?
575926,2746,2008-07-10 11:33:00,3206,I never take any and have not for several years. Use a credit card for evething possible and you won't get canadian change to bother with and you get the current exchange.
575927,Guest,2008-07-10 12:01:00,0,If I was travelling to a foreign country I would bring their currency. The visa thing works but having cash is a good idea.
575929,Jigger1,2008-07-10 12:05:00,234,I haven't taken any in years either. The exchange rate is basically par. On my credit card the exchange rate was a hair below .99 one day and hair over the next.
575932,Muskygary,2008-07-10 16:01:00,137,I always get some at the border. That way when I buy something in a store I know what I'm paying and don't have to worry if Im getting the current exchange rate.
575950,Guest,2008-07-11 11:41:00,0,The exchange rate right now is just about even. 1 US dollar = 1.00883 Canadian. Not worth the hassle of exchanging if you ask me.
575951,Guest,2008-07-11 11:51:00,0,"I have not yet run into a place of business that will not take U.S. dollars and with the exchange rate being nearly equal, I think you would lose more money by changing it over."
575953,Guest,2008-07-11 11:54:00,0,I would get some Canadian money. We went last month and the US dollar was slightly stronger than the Canadian but just about every joint we stopped ta was treating the Canadian dollar higher. Use a credit card and you don't have to worry abou the hassle.
575972,walleye54,2008-07-11 21:26:00,8,"While the official exchange rate is about equal between US and the Canadian dollar, many of the local establishments will gouge you as much as 5 percent on ""their exchange rate"". You can buy almost anything with a credit card; less hassle and at the official exchange rate. However if you have not purchased your license ahead of time you will have to pay cash for it across the border."
575975,Guest,2008-07-12 06:38:00,0,5% gouge? lmao try spending canadian money in the U.S. you will find out what gouging is all about!
