576022,CDNWalleyehunter,2008-07-14 09:47:00,17,"I was out last week for a day, We started drifting with rigs, with a sliding bottom bouncer and a lipped minnow off of a 6 foot lead red hook. We caught quite a few, then late morning early afternoon, we moved to jigs, yellow with a red eye and red hook caught the most, but the biggest came with a 1/4 ounce green with a red eye. It was a 31"" walleye. we trolled some cranks and caught some nice ones 3 that were 28, alot of 24's and 25's. You have to let the fish tell you what they want. October is my favorite time to fish Lac Seul. The walleyes really hit hard then. Good luck out there. I'll be out on Lac Seul again this weekend."
575744,bpetersen,2008-07-03 16:30:00,251,"June 7-13 orange jig with minnow did well. I know I might not be the norm but a lindy rig and crawler fished very slow did very well, also. Fish Hawk/Powered By Yamaha"
575766,Guest,2008-07-04 11:14:00,0,"We fished from June 20-30, and gold metallic and pink were the colors of choice, though our guide didn't seem to feel it mattered much due to the tannins. The few times I switched to black, white or chartreuse, I did just as well. We fished minnows, and what made a huge difference was the size of the jig and the way we hooked the minnows. Sometimes the fish's preference changed a few times in a single day, and the guys in the boat fishing the right rig would nail them while the other guys went dry. As soon as you switched, it was like turning on a lightbulb. I was amazed at how subtle the change was sometimes. The two presentations that seemed to work best, but never at the same time, was a 1/8 oz jig with a lip-hooked minnow or a 1/4 oz jig with the hook run through the mouth, out the gill, then hooked again through the middle of the back so that the minnow looked like he was swallowing the jighead. The first presentation was better when the fish went negative or had been worked over hard, the second was better on a hot bite or suspended fish. Speaking of, we did find lots of suspended walleye that just pounded the bait when you lifted it to their level. We did rip bouncers for awhile, but it really wasn't necessary, and at one point we got into a Lindy bite when the fish really got picky. Otherwise...ole' Lac Seul ""jig an' a minnow"". KWN"
575807,worthsr,2008-07-05 23:46:00,52,I caught my biggest Lac Seul Walleye on one of Mike's spinners this year! It wasn't my biggest ever but I did win the big Walleye conest again this year! Thanks Mike.
575942,Guest,2008-07-11 08:27:00,0,What about salted minnows on a jig? Anyone had any luck with that set-up?
575947,Mike Kansas,2008-07-11 11:01:00,1463,>What about salted minnows on a jig? Anyone had any luck with >that set-up? We tried some salted minnows because a couple days we ran out of the real thing. Our success with salted was minimal but we did catch a few eyes on them.
575952,Guest,2008-07-11 11:53:00,0,I always vertical jig but I was wondering if anyone has much success pitching jigs?
575957,Mike Kansas,2008-07-11 12:53:00,1463,">I always vertical jig but I was wondering if anyone has much >success pitching jigs? We had some success pitching jigs into shallow water and edges of weed beds. The jig we use for that is a LipJig which has a crankbait lip on it which enhances the action on retrieve. I have them on my website for sale and if you are interested email me and I will give you my website address.[email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

Joey, The biggest Walleye we caught this year was flipping a LipJig 1/8oz silver along weed beds. The eye was 28"" and the LipJig had a minnow on it. The lipjig has great action because of it's crankbait like bill on a jig. They are avaliable on my website. if you want the address of the website email me at the following address.[email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
575205,Guest,2008-06-19 12:04:00,0,"I am wondering what color of jig has worked best for folks on Lac Seul? My best producer over the years has been a chartreuse jig head with a red hook. Also, what is your bait of choice for tipping the jig? Mine would be 1/2 a crawler."

575245,stumcfar,2008-06-20 10:09:00,451,"I was fishing Lac Seul last week in the Ear Falls area. In the midst of the rain storms last week, the fishing was fantastic, but jig color really mattered. Gold or black outfished everything hands down. Don't be afraid to try different colors, until you find what they want. Last week minnows were better than crawlers for us anyway."

Pink was really hot in stand up jig 1/4 and 3/8 oz. If you are interested I have a website that sells the exact jigs we use. All jigs are painted with a powder coating that is baked on for durability and the 1/4 oz has a 1/0 Eagle Claw hook and the 3/8 oz has a 3/0 Eagle Claw hook. Email me if you would like the website address[email protected] Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
575260,Hump,2008-06-20 16:44:00,578,i have seen Mike's tackle website . It looks like great products and very reasonably priced. give him a try.
575282,Guest,2008-06-21 10:01:00,0,"Fishing Lac Seul June 7-13, white out produced anything else hands down for us. Pink was the second choice. All were tipped w/ minnows, however crawlers were starting to pick up towards the end of the week."
575378,Guest,2008-06-23 12:40:00,0,"When we were there two years ago-we caught the fish on anything including over 30 walleyes on chunks of red licorice-easy pickins. If I had one bait of choice for this time of year it would be white 1/8 oz or 1/4 oz jig-decent size hook with a small chuck of crawler-cha-ching. Buy a box of hooks, get some lead from your tire guy, and buy a case of beer with your buddies and make 3 years worth in two hours-can't beat it!"
575729,Guest,2008-07-03 08:29:00,0,"Was at Lac Seul near Ear Falls 6/21-6/28. Gulp worked as well as Minnows. I have been going for 6 years and most of the time I have found that plastics work as well as live bait. The other great benefit, when you find the fish action is pretty fast. You do need need to constantly put a new minnow on. Also, otters are sometimes a problem...attacking your minnow bucket. I think the choice is more about confidence. For example, I also like white jigs and did very well. We started to run out and I swithed to yellow. I did not see a noticeable difference."
575735,Guest,2008-07-03 10:51:00,0,"I leave for Lac Seul tomorrow and have been going this time of year for about 7 years now. The bait of choice is a bottom bouncer with a worm rig and gold spinner. I use the electric trolling motor to pull us along slowly and have good success year in and year out. I bring a flat of worms that have been fattened up on Buss bedding for a couple of weeks. I started this because it was easier for my son to fish, less snags. It has worked so well it is our go to bait. Troll 10'-25' shelves off of the 40' deep basin."
