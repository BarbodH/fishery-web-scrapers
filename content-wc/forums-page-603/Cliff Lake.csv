575855,Guest,2008-07-07 21:35:00,0,"Hey Rose, You are right about the 8lb. and muskie fishing, I was up at Camp Manitou on Lower Manitou fishing muskies last week and we boated 5 for the week - the biggest being 48"". One of the guys guiding caught a 51.5"" muskie on 8lb. mono while fishing bass on a pink jig. They are waiting to hear confirmation, but the owner said it tied the 8lb. line class world record. I saw the digital pictures when he got back to camp - it was a beauty. I fish with 80lb. tuff line on my baitcaster and one guy catches a line class record on 8lb.? What a strange year it's been for muskies."
575861,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-07-08 08:45:00,116,Muskie Ron Please keep me posted on the 8lb test record. I had not even thought about that aspect. Thanks
575862,Guest,2008-07-08 08:56:00,0,here is a link to a pic of the 51.5# muskeyhttp://www.fishingminnesota.com/foru...ie#Post1452638

Even if it is a little bit out of the way. I really enjoy your perspective and enthusiasm. I know you have taken a few bashings on here, but don't be discouraged from posting! Lazy eye"
575990,skindzier,2008-07-12 20:19:00,137,"Hi Rose, Glad everything is going good for you! We were going to stop by yesterday - until the northern hurricane hit! Prior to that nonsense, I boated a 37"" musky on Mystery and my daughter caught a 25"" walleye on Cliff - on a 9 inch crankbait while trolling for musky! I'm actually writing from a hotel in Fargo on our way home. Hopefully we can catch up with you next year! Jef"
575811,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-07-06 09:50:00,116,"Hello Everyone, Fish Status, Largest so far; Walleye = 31"" Northern = 36"" Smallmouth = 5 lbs Musky = 46"" Lake Trout = 34"" Overall the fishing has been good. Best before a front moves in and we've had plenty of them. Wind,wind and rain for last couple of days. Right now our tiny bay has white caps so the big water is ""really"" rough. We'll see how they manage, it's going to be a tough one. What a life; I have met the neatest people!!! Arkansa, Colorado, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Florida and Minnesota. It's crazy, the people catching musky on 8lb test and light weight rods. I thought it was a freak thing the first couple of weeks but it has continued each week since opening. Are any of you experiencing this too??? If anyone is driving by, please stop in and say hi."

575826,Guest,2008-07-06 22:20:00,0,"The boat ramp at Rose's camp is a little hard to get to, I would use the ones at Sharpe's cliif lake lodge or Jack's campground and there is a public ramp right along 105 also. The trout on Cliff should be running form 2-6lbs. this time of year."
575834,Guest,2008-07-07 06:31:00,0,Seen the public ramp> Don't know if a 21' boat can get in/out? What is the normal charge for boat ramp usage?
575837,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-07-07 08:34:00,116,"We have a very large turn-around and a flat sand boat launch. We've had large boats in every week since opening. No charge to anyone from Walleye Central and yes, the coffee is on!!!"

"""""""""""" Rose I've picked up several muskies using 5/8ox jigs and minnows in the lakes around Red Lake over the years while fishing for walleyes. Also my wife usually fishes for crappies off the back of the boat while I cast for Muskies and her biggest musky so far is 27# on 4# test ultralight set up.

Don't feel bad Rose, my wife had about 10-12 to her credit and doesn't even fish them, hard to convince her too...:) Tell them to go find a 50""+ one, that might help convince them. Al"
