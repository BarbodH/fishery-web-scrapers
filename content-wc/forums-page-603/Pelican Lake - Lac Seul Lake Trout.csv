575713,Guest,2008-07-02 16:04:00,0,Has anyone fished Pelican Lake or Lac Seul for Lake Trout? and if so did you have any success?

575756,Guest,2008-07-04 05:58:00,0,"Better choice would be Big Vermillion Lake just south of Lac Seul and reached by the road to Hudson. Deep clear water- not stained like Lac Seul. I haven't fished for Lakers in years, but used to do very well in early Spring and later on in the year trolling in ~ 45>55'. Big gold Doctor spoon was the lure of choice. -JBP"

Lac Seul has enough deep water but not many lake trout according to a man I talked to a few years ago that was netting whitefish out by the Dominion Islands. Never heard of any anyway. Why not try Minnitaki? Not that far from Pelican."
575835,Mohleye,2008-07-07 07:34:00,368,Good point. We used to do real well on lakers in Minnitaki.
