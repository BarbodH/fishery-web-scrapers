575935,Guest,2008-07-10 17:28:00,0,Fished Gullrock today with some friend that our staying at Golden Hook camp and were saying the place is TOP NOCTH. Great owners and staff. By the way we only caught about 80 walleye today not a good day on Gullrock but it was sunny and no wind.
575938,Guest,2008-07-10 20:05:00,0,"We have been staying for years at South Bay on Gull Rock. Great camp and beautiful setting just across the bay from 5 Lakes. Mary does cater to RVers but has 3 very nice cabins and a protected dock in South Bay. Lots of 24-26"" walleye caught just off the dock! Also up on the bluff with a good breeze to eliminate bugs. Very clean fish house. I agree....seems like all the camps on Gull Rock are quality."

576048,Guest,2008-07-15 11:38:00,0,"Rod Bender Ricky, I would recommend you check out Woman River Camp. We have been there three years running, fishing is great (and not to far) from the camp and the accommodation's are top rate. Great value for the money and Moss and Debbie run a great camp. Good Luck. Pella Dutch"

575871,Guest,2008-07-08 15:32:00,0,anyone??
575872,Guest,2008-07-08 15:50:00,0,"Hey ricky, We just got back from Camp Manitou, we mainly muskie fished but we caught alot of pike and smallmouth also. There was a family of 5 in the cabin next to us, they did housekeeping but rented boats from the camp. The cabin was nice, the boats look like 18' lunds with pedestal seats and 50hp hondas. I enjoyed the fishing, I know my group is going back next year. Their website is www.campmanitoufishing.com There is not alot of info on the website, I just e-mail through the site for more info. If you do go, talk to keith one of the guides he helped us out with some good spots. Good Luck"
575874,Obabikon,2008-07-08 16:22:00,2370,"Rod, I'll suggest Rose on Cliff Lake! www.lostbayresortclifflake.com"
575875,Guest,2008-07-08 16:55:00,0,"I suggest Woman River Camp, womanriver.com Has everything you are looking for."
575884,Guest,2008-07-09 06:10:00,0,I'm an excamp owner don't have any interest in any resort right now. If I was taking women and kids for a fishing trip to NW Ontario I would fish Gullrock. It's easy to fish (lots of walleyes) very little rocks to hit and town is close by for bad weather days. Most camps have a reduced rate for family.
575887,Guest,2008-07-09 08:04:00,0,"I concur with Bud with a couple of additional thoughts, Head to a lake that is close to a population center...be it near Red Lake, Dryden, or Kenora. As Bud stated, you have options on the days you can't get on the lake other entertainment options for the ladies and teenager. I don't know the Kenora area, but would recommend Gull Rock (near Red Lake)for the walleye fishing. Near Dryden, I would recommend Wabigoon. It is not a clear water lake, but has a high variety of fish (walleyes, smallmouth, pike and muskies) and due to it's stain, you can fish much shallower than you could at Gull Rock during August. Good Luck!"
575907,Guest,2008-07-09 15:36:00,0,"We stay on Gullrock in 3rd week in August and have great fishing. I know there are a lot of good resorts on the lake. We stay at Five Lakes Lodge and they have great upgrade boats if they have them still available. 17' with pedestal seats, 40hp 4 strokes, minnow and live wells and small locator. The pedestal seats and underdeck storage are great to have. I'm not sure I'd qualify it as ""small water"", but I've never been afraid of getting lost. Only once did I turn back from the main body of water due to size of waves and that year we didn't have the upgrade boats. There was still plenty of other water to fish. Others can hopefully give you some suggestions that might be smaller water and/or a shorter drive if thats an issue."
575921,Guest,2008-07-10 08:52:00,0,"Ricky, 6 years and running at Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock and won't consider another lodge or lake. Great camp, great location great owners and fantastic lake. The first year we went my boy was 9. I was concerned about rough water. No worries. Plenty of spots to get out of the wind. One of our best producing spots this year was 300 yards from the lodge. As mentioned before, Red Lake has some interesting sights just a short 7 miles up the road, tourist centers, museums. etc., if you need to take a break, and free golf as well. Plus talk to Everett, the owner, he has some romote lakes that have an unbelieveabley beautiful drive to a small lake, Lake Zimmering, that you will be the only boat on. You will catch as many medium size northerns as you can stand with a chance of a nice one. Good Luck & Be Safe, JohnB.O.A.T."

I wouldn't call it small water either, but it's marked for navigation and there are other unique landmarks, so finding your way around is pretty easy. A lot of people from this area go to Gullrock, and it seems that all the camps have good reputations."
