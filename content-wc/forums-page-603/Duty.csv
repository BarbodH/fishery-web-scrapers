575903,YellowHead,2008-07-09 14:37:00,4,I know this has been mentioned before but I can't seem to find it. What is the duty this year on beer? Thanks.
575915,slugger,2008-07-09 19:34:00,4,The amount is based on the price you paid for it and have your receipt to prove it.
575928,Guest,2008-07-10 12:02:00,0,Can someone give me and approximate? Is it better to claim your liquor or your beer as your one freebie?
575939,Matches,2008-07-10 21:42:00,236,It would be approx. $9.25 per case of beer. I don't know about liquor.
575940,straydog,2008-07-11 06:25:00,11,"A case of beer costing $14 + tax in the US, will be about $25 after you get it into Canada. You will save $15 to $20 over similar Canadian beer."
575941,Guest,2008-07-11 07:15:00,0,"""similar Canadian beer"" LOL Not many American beers are similar to Canadian beers....IMO. Canadian beer is a special treat for me!! Clarkie"
575949,woods,2008-07-11 11:39:00,646,"After we paid the duty on our beer this year, we only saved about $3 per case! Not worth the effort."
575954,Guest,2008-07-11 11:57:00,0,Buy the good Canadian stuff at the boarder and pay the duty. Still alot cheaper than buying it in Canada. We saved about $15 per case on Blue Light.
575955,MTJ,2008-07-11 11:59:00,106,I paid $18.30 canadian for two cases each valued at $18 US last weekend. Hope this helps.
