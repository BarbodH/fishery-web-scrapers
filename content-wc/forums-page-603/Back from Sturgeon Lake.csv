Gary and Judy are great people and we have developed a very good friendship over the years. The Trip..... Border crossing at Pigeon River is a little out of the way , but 5 minutes total time both directions makes up for it ! Gas was $4.08 at the border and ranged from $1.43 per litre in Ignace and Sioux Lookout $1.60 in Savant Lake. The weather ...... Rained all but 2 days, 1 day too much storms and lighning to even fish. It is very wet up there. The lake is almost 3 ft above normal. The weeds are way behind . Winds were pretty tough .The water temps ranged from 63 to 70 . The Bugs.......... The worst I have ever seen. Mosquitos , Gnats , Black Flies , and the ever present no-see-ums. You would even have to battle them on the lake at times. The fishing ........ The BEST I have ever had there, 100s of Walleyes , with lots of ""too bigs"". The Northerns were scattered due to the weeds being so late , but the quality was awesome. My wife personal best 25# and 45 inches worth !!. Lake Trout were unreal. I had my limit in 5 minutes and our 2 person limit in 10 !!! I am still amazed at the fight those fish can put up. We fished a bush lake for 1 day (in the rain) , that is another part of the trip I look forward too. Very good fishing and definitely part of the experience. I never saw any other boats the entire week , so the fishing pressure is pretty light ! Overall it was a great trip. It cost more this year , but tomorrow I will be back to the grindstone looking forward to next year's trip. There have been quite a few cancellations at nearly every camp up that way due to the gas , the $$ etc. Strurgeon is 96% underfished and you are not going to figure it out immediately , but once you do --- it is an awesome fishery. I guess it says something when one of the guests just made it up there for his 44th consecutive year !!!"

We have stayed at Moose Creek for the past 15 years but decided to move north because of needing a change and too many other boats. It sounds like you had a great time. We have fished the south end for lakers and have done well but didn't spend much time fishing eyes. Any info you would be willing to share about your pursuit of eyes on Sturgeon would be appreciated. We plan to fish a couple of other lakes in the area for eyes also. My understanding is that White Sands is a very nice place to stay. Anything you can share about it would also be appreciated. I'll post upon return. Thanks in advance, JEP"
