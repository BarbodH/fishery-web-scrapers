575960,Dog,2008-07-11 14:01:00,210,We were up there the last week of june and the fishin was great just as it is every year. We found the walleyes to be deep (20-24')early in the week and as the weather got hotter later in the week we were doing well in the 12-14' depths. Talked to a few guys that were doing real well up shallow on the weed edges with a jig and twister tail. Dog

Northerns were tough to find due to the lack of weeds. Walleyes were pretty good and smallmouth ok. Due to the lack of weed growth, you might do well to check out the Hayfields for some northerns. Typically they would be weed choked but this might be a good time. Good Luck. Wingmann"

Fish in the 16"" - 18"" range are common, with good numbers of fish in the low 20-inch range taken daily. And it seems they're everywhere."

Lunker's report is right on the money. We found that we could take 2 or 3 fish out of a pod on the humps with bottom bouncers and then would have to switch to vertical jigging for the remainder. We spent 3 hours on one hump and took 40+ walleyes between the 2 of us. Great year. And, the camp staff is fantastic as usual. The VERY good service is even better this year if that is possible. Gonna go back in a couple of weeks."
