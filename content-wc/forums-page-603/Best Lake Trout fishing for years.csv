I told guys to use Len thompson 5 of diamonds but they are best in the fall or in deeper water. This spring the guys caught beautiful lake trout on regular walleye lures like a chartuese jig and floating num 18 rapala. Several groups reported the best lake trout fishing ever in several different lakes. Just this past week, a lady caught the biggest trout I've seen in many years at Viking Island. She used a croccodile lure and a zebco rod and reel! Hmm thought you needed a Mitchell reel at the very least! For pictures you can check out my blog www.viking-island.blogspot.com"
