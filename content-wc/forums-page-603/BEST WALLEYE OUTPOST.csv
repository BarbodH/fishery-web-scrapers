561386,phishfearme,2006-09-26 08:54:00,1242,"robby - to get some real ""quality"" lakes with outposts, you'll probably have to violate your budget number. but i can personally vouch for springpole lake with canadianflyinfishing.com (and i'll bet their jeanette lake would be just as good but without the chance to catch true 20lb lakers) as well as bow lake with albanyriver.ca both of these lakes are what i consider quality lakes (an excellent walleye population - but you sometimes need crawlers to catch larger numbers - and a single very nice cabin on a large lake) and you can get a week for less than $1K. you can see my most recent bow lake report at:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...ng_type=search would be glad to provide details on both lakes for you including a marked up map. i would expect 25 walleye per person days would be very average on these lakes and we've had 75 - 100 per person days at each. phish"
562885,Guest,2007-01-19 09:29:00,0,"your on a thight budget for a fly-in, at $1000.00, i am familiar with Air Melancon, good reputation, another is www.NorthAmericanBushman.com, great Walleye, sometimes every cast, if walleye is all you are after , you do not have to do a fly-in,"

563365,Guest,2007-02-13 11:10:00,0,you may want to try one of the outpost of Allanwater bridge lodge. some great walleye fishing.

575689,Guest,2008-07-01 20:40:00,0,Robby - look into TAMARAC Air to Lake Herbert- been doing it 15+ yeaes and very steady-they also have a portage lake for catch and release- you will exceed your numbers and price is in your range nice cabin - nice lake and good outfitter- if you want more info post email and i will send you our personal experience and info good luck
575696,Guest,2008-07-02 06:27:00,0,"Have had excellent fishing trips on Melchett Lake in Nakina, Ontario. There's a lot of lake with only one other cabin on it. Catch lots of good size walleyes and northerns. We use Arctic Watershed Outposts. They have taken great care of us.http://www.awonakina.com/"

575728,Guest,2008-07-03 06:28:00,0,Also in Nakina you can try Brace Lake Outfitters. I just got back from my trip in there and it was excellent. Fishing was second to none for both walleye and Northerns. There are a couple of joining lakes to Brace like Ara and Meta which are both accessible by boat. Also the rates are on their which are very cheap with the price of fuel these days. Check them out at http://www.bracelakeoutfitters.com
575937,Guest,2008-07-10 19:57:00,0,Chimo out of Red Lake Ontario ( www.chimolodge.com ) Has some great outpost and is very reasonably priced flyin fishing. Peter the owner is a great person goes out of his way to make sure your happy..Cabins are nice and fishing is great. Been going for 10 years now and the last 2 years I took my 12 year old son with me this year he landed a 29.5 walleye. We took all the mesurments and pic so we can get a mount made of it. Maybe he will cetch it next year and it will be over 30 ( that is what he is telling me ).. Lots of nice pike biggest this year was 42 inch and a few lake trout.
561022,phishfearme,2006-09-11 19:10:00,1242,"robby - you need to define ""outpost"". to me it's NOT a lodge. it's a single cabin (or tent camp?) remotely located BY ITSELF on a large lake or lake system. furthermore, what amenities does an outpost have by your definition? there's some isolated outposts available in northern quebec on HUGH lakes that would probably out-do any outpost in NW ontario but do you want to spend $2K for a week? see for example: http://www.bushlandadventures.com/about.htm? there's places in NW ontario that aren't quite as expensive but are excellent (northern outposts was mentioned but i would NOT recommend their obashi lake outpost - their other lakes are much better). and also there's mocassin trails (mcdowell lake!!) at: http://www.moccasintrailsfishing.com/ but both of these places are about $1200 to $1300 per week. there are alot of places much cheaper that can produce really good results. for example, albany river outposts at: http://www.albanyriver.ca/ will give you a week of really good walleye fishing for about $800 a week. in general, the larger the lake the more lodges and outposts on them (like lac seul). seem like you get what you pay for but what do you really want? i try to find a large lake that's newly opened OR a lake that you can portage to that has not been touched. these are real gems. phish"

561038,Guest,2006-09-12 10:35:00,0,"Between $800-$1,000 is about our price range. The last few years the outpost camps we have gone to have not been that productive. The first ten years or so that we went we just had great fishing but not recently. I am just trying to locate good consistant walleye fishing. We always go in late August or early September, maybe we should change times and go earlier."

561363,lobo1,2006-09-24 05:18:00,734,like phish said - Mocassin trails - I been to several and they are all outstanding but maybe a tad out of your range $$ but well worth the cash in my opinion. not an outpost but we went to the OldPost on Lake St Joseph this past June - I took my 11 yr old son for the first time. OUTSTANDING facility - fishing was as good as any of the outposts I been to and I been to some good ones. lobo
561364,Guest,2006-09-24 07:02:00,0,"Anyone have any experience with Air Melancon in Quebec? I know it is not primitive and has nice lodges etc. We are planning to be there in late May right after the walleye opener. Anyone been there, had success, what works for bait/lures, how was the overall experience? Thanks."
561369,lobo1,2006-09-24 18:36:00,734,"Not familiar with your lake // air service but I have yet to go to ANY ""quality"" lake and needed anything other than white berkely powerbait twisters and either metallic gold or unpainted jig heads. This year we tried some gulp minnows in the shad or alewife color and they worked even better but are not nearly as durable. I would take some pkgs of gulp minnows for when fishing slowed down but when they are biting fast - just about anything works. We have had many many days with 150+ fish in the baot at numerous differant lakes/regions. We have never even considered live bait - we need that to fish at home!! In a pinch, after a cold front etc, I suppose you could cut some walleye belly meat into strips but I don't know how legal that is in Canada Take a handful of spoons for pike - with a few being weedless JSM - and you are all set. lobo1"
561372,Guest,2006-09-25 09:27:00,0,"When I say ""outpost"" I mean fly-in. We like to be the only ones on the lake if possible. That way you are not fighting over the ""good spots"". It has been years since we have had a 50 fish day per boat. We do like to portage to other lakes as well."
561379,Cameron Muir,2006-09-25 18:27:00,11,"If your budget allows, Little Doctor Lake, NWT. No bait allowed. Walleye every second cast (3 - 4 lb size, which is about as big as they get that far north). Has one bay for pike which is insane. They scared the bejeezes out of my wife, because she would set her rod aside to read her book and the pike would hit the side of the canoe as they jumped out of the water to hit her dangling lure. Top water bass lures were fun here, as the backs of some of the big pike would break the surface about 10' before they got to the lure. You could play with them and decide which ones you'd let hit. Some would double back and go at it again. Also grayling for a change of pace, which will take a Mepps spinner. I just checked online and I see that Simpson Air still owns the cabin on the lake: Box 260 Fort Simpson, N.W.T. XOE-ONO Phone: (867) 695-2505, Fax: (867) 695-2925"
561382,Guest,2006-09-26 07:47:00,0,lz- I highly recommend Air Melancon. My group went with them 2X and had great trips. The prices have gone beyond our means now with the price of fuel. A top-notch outfitter with great accomodations. We caught many walleye...nothing huge...but great numbers of fish. Check/search Air Melancon in this forum for a more detailed report. I'd go back there in a heartbeat if I could.
