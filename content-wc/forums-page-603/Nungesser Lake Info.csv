We'll be doing a lot of walleye fishing but a bit for northerns as well. Can't wait!!! And for you Chicago guys, how long was the drive? I live in the west suburbs."
576034,Guest,2008-07-14 16:27:00,0,"Wonderful body of water.....The chances of a true trophy are very real.Fish hard and enjoy the seclusion.We were on Nungesser last fall and can't wait to get back. As for the drive, it is a real haul."
576051,tparker,2008-07-15 19:34:00,100,"kplowman, Hope you have a great trip. The trip from Northwest Indiana was a little over 11 hours to get across the border, and another 5 hours or so to Red Lake. Watch for moose on the way up, as we saw a few pretty close to the road. Roy at Birchpoint took great care of us the week of June 21st. Every morning we checked with him, and he marked a map for us based on that days conditions, wind direction, etc. He put us on fish all week. Make sure you try the point about 200 yards from camp. (ask Roy) My son and I went there every evening after dinner, and caught more walleye there than any other place. Also caught the largest walleye (25.5"") and largest pike ( a fat 33"") of the trip there. Tell Roy that Tim and Chris from Griffith, Indiana say hello. Good Luck. Tim"
576064,Guest,2008-07-16 11:24:00,0,Thanks for the help. I'll be sure to mention your names to Roy. Was there anything you did or used that really produced more fish than something else?
574713,tparker,2008-06-05 21:38:00,100,Heading up to Nungesser Lake June 21st. First time up there for my son and I. Any help with areas and techniques for both walleye and northern would be a big help. Any fishing reports from up there yet? Tim

575097,Guest,2008-06-15 19:07:00,0,"Tparker Where are you from,i just got back 6-14.Walleye fishing was great, caught tons of fish 40-80 a day per boat, 2 people.Could have caught more if we fished them all day. Are you close to Chicago i have a marked map with plenty of HOT spots."
575102,tparker,2008-06-15 20:31:00,100,"Spike Mike, I'm in Northwest Indiana. Would love to get a look at that map. Glad to hear you did so well. What camp were you at? We will be at Birch Point Lodge. Leaving Fri. morning. Did you fish for pike at all, or just walleye? I really appreciate the report. Tim"

575648,tparker,2008-06-30 18:04:00,100,"sch205, My son and I got back Sat. from Birchpoint Camp on Nungesser Lake. Had a great trip. Both the weather and the fishing were great. Mainly pitched a jig and minnow on windblown points, and when you hit a good one, it was one after another. My son had the biggest walleye @ 25.5"", and the biggest pike @ 33"". Numerous cases of pike trying to steal our walleye boatside. I know others in camp caught bigger walleye than we did, a few 28's that I know of, but no complaints from us. This was my first trip to Nungesser Lake, and hopefully not my last. Everyone at Birchpoint Camp was great. No hassles, and everything was ""as advertised."" I would be glad to answer any specific questions, and help in anyway I can, as Spike Mike gave me a lot of help prior to my trip. Thanks again Mike. Tim"
