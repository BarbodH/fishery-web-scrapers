576024,KidWalleye,2008-07-14 11:01:00,557,"Ended up coming home early saturday as the wind was just too much. we ended up staying at main prize and fished from there south to the bridge. pulled cranks saturday morning with good luck had our limit of 20"" fish buy noon. didnt really seem to matter what crank you were running as all of them produced but if i had to pick one i would have to say (yellow wonderbread reef runner) never did try bait wind was just to bad. I could drift my cranks along at 2.0-2.4 MPH on gps. Only got to fish from about 8-2 on friday and for about an hour friday night. Gary"
