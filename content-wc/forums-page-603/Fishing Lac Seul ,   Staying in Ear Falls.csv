My son and I will be coming up on the 31st and leaving on Aug. 3 Short trip. Hope to get a couple days of Walleye fishing in.I have my own boat and am pretty good at finding Walleye's but, this short of a trip and maybe bad weather could make a long day. So looking for a little advice on were to start looking. Also there are two motels in town is one better than the other. The kids will be staying at relatives somewhere on English River Rd. I might sleep in the back of my truck or get a room. Any help or advice you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Please Fill free to E-mail me at [email protected]"

There's not a lot of structure, just move in & out from shallow to 20' until you find them. Hopefully they'd still be there. Check the weather, wind & gas tank as it is a long ride (20+ miles). We caught quite a few off Lunker Point too - not as much size, but much less of a run. Same deal depth-wise, just start shallow & go deeper until you find them. Both spots are marked on the green map that is easily available up there."

However, another boat was in position A1 on the windy side of the southernmost island - we didn't want to be pushy, so we kept our distance. Nosed into Sawmill very briefly after dinner one evening & didn't do much, but was there less than an hour."
