576056,Guest,2008-07-16 04:09:00,0,I know this has been beat to death before but I forgot. Senior moment I guess. I'm taking my 13 year old Grandson on his first trip to Canada. What documents do I need except for a passport. Thanks
576057,Guest,2008-07-16 05:38:00,0,"You need a signed and notarized letter of permission from his parents or guardian(s). The letter should include the address and phone numbers where the parents or guardians can be reach. The letter should grant permission for your grandson to travel to and from (insert name and address of resort and home address of grandson) with (insert your name.) I suggest the parents or guardians grant the grandfather authority to seek any needed medical, dental or optical son during the trip. Gary_IA"
576058,Guest,2008-07-16 06:24:00,0,"be sure both parents sign the permission papers and it would not hurt to have them notorized. (if your going to err, err on the side of being over prepared. below is info I got from a website, (sorry I no longer have the address). We will conduct a more detailed examination of minors entering Canada without proper identification or those traveling in the company of adults other than their parents or legal guardian(s). This additional scrutiny helps ensure the safety of the children. Minors traveling alone must have proof of citizenship and a letter from both parents detailing the length of stay, providing the parents' telephone number and authorizing the person waiting for them to take care of them while they are in Canada. If you are traveling with minors, you must carry proper identification for each child such as a birth certificate, passport, citizenship card, permanent resident card or Certificate of Indian Status. If you are divorced or separated, you should carry with you copies of the legal custody agreements for your children. If you are traveling with minors and you are not their parent/guardian, you should have written permission from the parent/guardian authorizing the trip. The letter should include addresses and telephone numbers of where the parents or guardian can be reached and identify a person who can confirm that the children are not being abducted or taken against their will."
