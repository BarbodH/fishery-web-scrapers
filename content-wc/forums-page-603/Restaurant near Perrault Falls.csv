576006,Guest,2008-07-13 17:19:00,0,Last year the restraunt was closed and for sale. Some of the resorts around the area offer meals and you might be able to get a home cooked meal if prior arrangements are made. Otherwise the the restraunts are either in Ear falls or back in Vermillion Bay. Dutchies general store offers some grocery items.

576028,Guest,2008-07-14 12:07:00,0,The restaurant is the Sunset. It is open weekdays from 6am to 9pm if memory serves me right. It has a tavern licence and you can get a beer or drink with your meal if so desired. It has everything on the menu from burgers to pork chops to fish and chips. it has the best coffee along the highway. Hope this helps
