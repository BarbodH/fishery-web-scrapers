575763,Guest,2008-07-04 10:58:00,0,"Hi Mitch, Don't want to get into details, cause the place wasn't too bad and we really enjoyed the company of the guide, but it paled in comparison to SWWL. We did have one really good day of fishing on that side, though, and other than the ""surprise"" of costing about $800 more than we expected at the end of the four days, it was an okay place with good food and facilities, friendly staff, and a great view. Best plan is really just to know what to expect for your money, what's included and what's not. Most of the ""long-timers"" there seemed quite happy, so they're doing something right, I guess... KWN"
575810,Jigger1,2008-07-06 09:19:00,234,"Another fantastic year of fishing LacSeul has come to a close. We just got back from fishing LacSeul June 22-July 1. I spent the first half of the trip with my daughter and the other half with the guys. This was my ninth year fishing the same time period and it was by far the most variable weather I've ever experienced. As a result our volume suffered this year and we were faced with a changing bite on a daily basis. What was amazing this year was the average size of the fish we caught. For the first time ever we actually had to scramble to find lunch. Over 57% of the recorded fish caught this year were 22 or larger. We topped out with two 29 walleyes, my daughter landing one of those. I was literally done fishing once she caught that fish and didn't care if I got another. It was awesome! We started the trip fishing 8' to 15' of water and progressively moved deeper as my time went on. By the end of the trip we were catching most of our size in 16' to 25' of water including some great fun with suspended fish. Several of my plus 24 walleye came from suspended fish. We almost exclusively used a jig and minnow combination for the trip. We had times during the trip where we would mark fish, but not catch them. We had other times where we would catch everything we marked. We had feather light bites one day and solid aggressive bites the next. We fished deep and the next second we tried shallow. Like the weather, variable was the best way to describe the fishing. We stay at SWWL lodge and a big thank you to the entire crew. Mike and his excellent team always do what it takes to make sure your trip is a memorable one and this year was no exception. We all had an outstanding time even though the fishing was a little tougher than normal. The countdown to next year has begun."
575870,iowaprowannabe,2008-07-08 14:14:00,1,"How deep are the suspended walleye's? Where did you find them in relation to structure or baitfish? I've tried it in the past and have not been very successful with it. I'am leaving on the 18th, so any information will be helpful. Thanks."
575909,Guest,2008-07-09 18:02:00,0,I hear people trolling for suspended walleyes but haven't tried it myself. Do they show up on sonar before you try for them or do you just pick a spot and go? Most of our walleyes at Lac Seul have been structure orientated for us. Any help would be appreciated.
575910,Jigger1,2008-07-09 18:39:00,234,"What we experienced was not open water suspended fish. With a body of water as large as LacSeul I'm sure that population of open water eyes exists but our target is structure related fish as well. What I've seen is suspended fish relating to typical structure that for lack of a better explanation were just a little more active and holding higher in the water column than the normal eye. We saw suspended fish at various depth levels, shallow as 12' to 30+. We saw them mixed in with baitfish and without and caught them in both cases, so there was really no consistency. We also caught several small to medium pike suspended in deeper water in areas that would soon hold summer walleyes. I personally caught suspended walleyes in 12' of water with eyes suspending 8' down and also in 25' of water with walleyes suspending as high as 12' down. It was really a matter of watching the electronics, knowing how many feet each crank of your reel raised the jig and then floated the jig, held on and set the hook when they slammed into it. My biggest suspended walleye was 26 and I caught several between 23 & 26. However at the same time I'd be catching a suspender, another person in the boat would catch one off the bottom so go figure. The lake is just full of them, I love it!"
575974,Guest,2008-07-12 04:20:00,0,"I was at SWWL the same time as Jigger1 and had almost exactly the same experiences with the suspended fish. We would mark fish down 10 over 16, raise our jigs, then either hold them ""dead-a** still"" or just twitch them slightly to trigger a strike. The fish were always bigger than the ones we were doing on the bottom, and they hit like a ton of bricks. Watching the graph was absolutely key. Definately not open water walleye, though. Transitions and breaks, just more active?? I did hear that a couple groups found suspended fish they couldn't get to go, too, so maybe not a sure thing, but worth keeping an eye out for (no pun intended...). Gator"
575977,Guest,2008-07-12 09:28:00,0,"what kind of jigs / size ? How much time do you spend bottom bouncing with spinner rigs? I'm going the first week of sept. This will be the 9th time in sept. We bottom bounce just about the whole time. Slip bobber it a little. Just looking to try something new to try and find bigger fish. I have not caught a walleye over 5 lbs. in years.Our group fishes Sunlight, South Bay,Hungry Narrows, Manitoba Point, and various islands in the main lake, in Sept. Any help would be great. thanks. jerry"
575525,Guest,2008-06-27 10:15:00,0,"I bet it is nice but way to pricey for me. Also I do not want a guide, or if I did maybe for one day. But about half their week price is in my budget. But I bet it is awesome. Maybe someday if I come into some money. Looking at Fishermans Cove and Lac Seul Lodge. Have a great summer"
575527,Guest,2008-06-27 10:20:00,0,"Both of above are very good, you might also check with Onaway Lodge, housekeeping packages, best docking facilities, great boats, and minnows and gas included for $700 for the week. Contact Blair or Kathy at 888-662-9291."
575557,Guest,2008-06-28 09:35:00,0,How is the Smallmouth fishing in that area?
575569,Guest,2008-06-28 18:38:00,0,"I don't target them except for just a couple of times. But we catch some incident to walleye fishing, so my gues is that if we tried a little harder we would catch more. But the ones we do catch are larger every year and boy do they have an attitude."
575666,Guest,2008-07-01 08:20:00,0,"Just got back from Lac Seul on Saturday. We launched from Deception Bay and mostly fished Sen Bay. The water levels are extremely high this year. The water temps at the start of the week were cold, but warmed up considerably by the end of the week. We started on Tuesday and had a bit of trouble finding fish, using our very sucessful (from last year) method of bottom-bouncing spinner/lindy rigs/floating jigs with leeches. We started off tuesday using Gulp Alive Leeches and caught a few. Then after some slow times, we decided to switch to fishing smallmouth using gigs with squirlly tails. With the water levels so high, there is a lot of sunken timber, so we fished the trees hoping for smallmouth. Our first few catches were nice smallies, however, we then started nailing walleyes in the trees...no kidding. We caught walleys in the trees anywhere from 1 ft to 6 ft deep. The next couple of days we switched back to bottom-bouncing (with real leeches) and caught a few in 8-12 ft, but when it got slow, we went back to the trees and did very well. By Friday, the water temps had warmed up and we finally started nailing the walleys using bottom bouncers (real leeches) in 10-16 ft. Most fish caught were in the slot 17-21"", but I personally caught 5 fish over 24"" on Friday and Saturday. In conclusion, we had to work hard to find fish, but we caught more than enough. We were also surprised to find lots of walleyes in typical bass territory (trees)."
575674,Guest,2008-07-01 12:39:00,0,"We fished out of Fisherman's Cove on Lac Seul June 21-27. Here is what we found: Water levels were up about a foot. Temps were around 59 F at the beginning of the week warming to over 70 F by Friday. A few degree variance depending where you were and the wind blowing. Fish didn't seem to react yet to the warming water. CAUTION! High water causes a lot of deadfalls to be floating around - some as big as telephone poles. Be careful, these floating hazards were all over the place  never seen so many. Rained most days, but it was a warm rain  we didn't bother with boots most days. Shorts and a T-shirt a few days. Shore lunch in the sun was a good thing. Saw a black bear loitering by a sandy beach in Broad lake by the mouth of Altimiter creek. I guess he and Boo boo were waiting for a pic-a-nic basket. Wind and waves were small making travelling easy on all days except 6/27. Fish were biting in 5  9 feet of water. We mostly ¼ oz. jigged rocky points in MacKenzie Bay. Minnows and half crawlers worked equally well. Clean rock points produced better than gravel. Each location produced fish in assorted sizes (in years past they grouped by size). Lots of slot size fish, so, on average they were good sized (even had a little trouble finding under the slot fish to eat). No monsters over 28  . A few days we landed over 100 fish per boat (2 Fisherman per boat). All others days were good. Most spots would produce for a couple of hours and then it was time to find another point not too far away. No slow days. Also pulled spinner rigs but we found the fish were concentrated on a spot (cups) at the 5-9 foot dropoff so jigging produced better. Weeds  what weeds? Couldn't find any except new growth in less the 5 f.o.w. (Big Sand Banks)."

575695,Guest,2008-07-02 06:02:00,0,"When you're comparing prices between resorts, you should make sure that you know exactly what you're getting for your money. We stayed four days at another lodge on the East side last week, then five days at Silver Water Wheel. The other lodge had a-la-carte pricing, and we ended up paying more there than we did at SWWL. Some of that is because of how we fish: guided during the day, American plan meals, then a camp boat for two hours in the evening. At SWWL, all of that is in the quoted price. At the other place, it wasn't. I'm not putting down a-la-carte pricing, cause it works for some people, but make sure that you're comparing apples with apples when it comes to cost. Things to check include do you pay extra for: minnows? parking? gas for guide boat? evening boat rental--how much? What kind of boat does the guide run? What kind of boat do you get in the evening? Lot's of options up there, and it's worth doing some homework. As for fishing, we nailed them. On the East side, as stated by others, we found the fish shallow in the trees, but not heavy on the reefs. At SWWL, we fished sand to rock transitions (12-16 fow) with great success. We did have one of those fantastic Lac Seul days, with over 100 eighteen inch+ walleyes, and a 27 fish smallmouth kicker in the evening, all of them on topwater. The fishing just got better every day we were there (despite two days of rain). I would like to put out kudos to the staff at SWWL. Wow. Absolutely top-notch. Professional and competent. I was seriously impressed..."
575707,Guest,2008-07-02 12:20:00,0,"I have been going out of Williams Lake Lodge for 10 years, same end of Lac Seul as SWWL. We take our own boats, access lake via Williams Bay. Fish a lot of same areas as the SWWL guides, see them all the time. Never get a guide, take own boats but lodge has as well as part of package. Williams has an outpost cabin at mouth of Williams Creek we stay in. Nice setting. Good accomodations for reasonable rates."

575430,Guest,2008-06-24 14:07:00,0,"Got back Saturday from LS, was there for six and half days. Conditions were tough the week we were there. Started cold and raining and then the sun broke through about mid-week and the weather was great for the last three days. However, the fishing had no pattern that we could figure out. For a while you would catch fish in 6 - 8 foot of water on rocky points. Then within the hour that would shut off and you would find yourself in 20 feet marking fish and occasionally catching them. Those would all be jig and minnow fish. If the wind would blow steady you could cast the wind blown shore with Husky Jerks and pick up nice fish (not non-stop action but a fish here and there, with a few northerns and smallies in for fun). Never had one of the those famous LS days where you cannot keep fish off the hook, but in all another great trip. Biggest eye was 27.5 and biggest smallie was 19.5. Nothing of great size on northerns but lots of nice fish in the 32 - 28"" range. As always our resort was first class with service, food, boats and guides. Have a great trip..IA Walleye"

575451,Guest,2008-06-24 22:05:00,0,"NWO is correct, we stay at Silver Water Wheel resort and have done so for nine years in a row now. Outstanding resort, run by first class folks. Boats are top notch (18 foot Lunds and Alumacraft with 90 horse four stroke Yammies, equiped with GPS and full color sonar. Food is great, guides know what they are doing but are not overbearing and never drunk. Fishing, safety and your enjoyment are their guiding principles. While the walleye fishing was a bit tougher than normal last week, I can assure that the fishing is terrific. Even last week with the weather being tough we had some great times, including one 2 hour period where it was hard to keep the smallies from hitting (and I am not complaining when they are 15 - 19"" smallies). See the website and give Mike a call ASAP, he will do his best to get you in. I will be back next year June 15 - 22, boy I am already counting. Last year was our best year, and I scored my personal best of 30.5""! I am an average to below average fisherman so that tells you a bit about how good the guides are and the fishing.
