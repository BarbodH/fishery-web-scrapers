575985,Guest,2008-07-12 17:07:00,0,I was hoping that someone could tell me if the mayflies are done on Gullrock lake or not. Will be heading up July 18th and hoping not to hit the hatch.

575994,Minnow Man,2008-07-13 06:03:00,85,"On Thursday July 10th the lake & wind were both calm, could see clouds of Mayflies in certain areas of the lake. Lots of places on the lake with no mayflies. Have had strong winds & rain for the last few days so that has stopped the hatch. No sure if this current weather has killed the hatch or just delayed it. Fishing was great on Thursday, we had as good as day as Bud & his company did. Two boats total of 7 people, all had a fish on at the same time, it was crazy."

576012,Minnow Man,2008-07-14 05:58:00,85,Hello Goldeneagle Would love to fly a Ultralight Aircraft but I have never flown one. I own & fly a Cessna 180 on floats.
