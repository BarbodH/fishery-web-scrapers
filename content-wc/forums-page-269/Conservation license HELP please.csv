But, in another area of the rules and regs it states a conservation license is a C-2 iwth a possession limit of 2. But, when I go to buy it only says conservation license. Doesn't say C-1 or C-2. I don't really care to bring any home but I also want to be able to keep more than 1 fish. I am taking 2 trips. One is catch and release only and the other not. I don't want to pay for a sport license if one whole trip is catch and release anyway."
