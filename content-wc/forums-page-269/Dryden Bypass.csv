We eventually find our way to 17 HWY, as there's a few options to get you there. Can someone tell me which road may be better,,,Griffith or Minnitaki?"
4016682,Bstar,2015-07-02 07:05:00,564,I don't know about those roads but Adams Rd was recommended to me by another WC member.
4016690,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-02 07:05:00,725,"Assuming you are trying to get to the 105, we usually take the bypass through Eagle nation which connects to 594. Speed limit is low and wildlife is abundant, but we find it works best for us. However this year we needed to go to Dryden for eggs. Our next trip is to Century Lodge on Eagle Lake so we will see if cutting off that couple of hours is worth it. Will report in September."
4016706,Bakefish,2015-07-02 07:11:00,1077,"Adams. Been doing it for many many years. Gravel road, and sometimes a little sketchy."
4016882,Golden Eagle,2015-07-02 08:28:00,2642,"I usually go from 594 to Oxdrift and have stopped many times in the dip for my lab to take a squirt. Sometimes I take 594 to 17, which is a pretty drive. In really nasty, wet weather or with snow covering the roads I go all the way to Dryden. It's easy to avoid downtown Dryden traffic and save time, but I don't remember the road north, just before arriving in Dryden."
4017234,Aspencreek,2015-07-02 10:47:00,2911,"I recommended Adams rd into Oxdrift. It seems to get a little better every year. More houses and the farm is getting bigger so there is a couple more cars every day. A few year ago they replaced a culvert, which made for an interesting back job with the boat for about a 1/4 mile to a driveway into a field. It is all gravel but wide and cuts off at least 20-30 min. And have seen bear, deer, porcupine, raccoon and a lynx. ""carefull on the curves"" never know about oncoming traffic or the wildlife crossing the road."
4017778,Bakefish,2015-07-02 14:40:00,1077,"I've been taking that road for as many years as I can remember and I've never seen a wild animal, not once. Maybe next spring. I do find it odd that there is a picnic table on the east side of the road out in the middle of nowhere."
4018306,bigwillies,2015-07-02 18:53:00,515,all the roads that cut across to the 17 are pretty much the same.gravel with a few twisties.adams rd is the first and the oxdrift store has great beef jerkey from rainy river meats. if u are worried about stone chips like the other poster said take ojibway drive through the reserve and come out at eagle river junction store(left at first stop sign. right at second.come out at 17)
4021562,mswope13,2015-07-04 16:42:00,73,"Thanks for all the reply's, Bigwillie, thanks for the local knowledge, we will definately stop at the Oxdrift store and pick up some jerkey, good boat munchies."
