Not just when you are buying something, but also when you return something on your card. The credit company's always make their money. Cant get away from that!"

4020186,Gipper,2015-07-03 18:48:00,76,That's a great exercise for the tykes. Next teachable moment is to explain that they have to pay for the Canadian Obamacare somehow.

4018002,Gipper,2015-07-02 16:10:00,76,Is anyone aware of what you paid for gas in Canada in $USD? I'm thinking it still makes since to fill up before crossing. Am I wrong?
4018034,forgop,2015-07-02 16:27:00,880,I believe it was around $1.259/L between SSM and Wawa as of June 12/13th. I filled up on the US side and was able to make it back before needing to fill up again.
4018250,Gipper,2015-07-02 18:09:00,76,I thought so........thx.
4018474,bigwalleye1,2015-07-02 20:37:00,2632,"It always makes sense to fill up on the U.S. side. It will never be cheaper in Canada, even with the good exchange rate. 1.28 per liter in Sioux lookout is still $5 CDN, with a .8 exchange rate in still $4 USD"
4018602,fishman10,2015-07-02 21:37:00,226,4.5 litres per imperial gallon So it would have been 1.28 times 4.5 $5.75 per gallon canadian
4018626,ftfarms,2015-07-02 21:52:00,444,It's around $3.78 a gallon in US funds. That's 3.78 litters I think that's a gallon in the states.
4018802,Guest,2015-07-03 06:05:00,0,"This is where life gets interesting. Here is where you can get the kids in the car excited about math. Every year, we cross the border at Ft. Francis, the kids dig the old calculator out of the glove compartment and start to compute the price of gas in Canada. One US gallon is 3.785 liters. Then you figure in the exchange rate. Then their jaw drops when they come up with the answer. Then you explain that the border is more than just a line on a map."
4019106,NARDA 1,2015-07-03 08:06:00,636,You can check the gas prices along your route on this web site http://www.gasbuddy.com/ this can also be downloaded as an App for your phone and works for Canada too.
4019122,Guest,2015-07-03 08:07:00,0,"As of today on Gasbuddy.com. Gas at the Esso in Sioux Lookout is $1.24 CND per liter. @ 3.78 litters per US Gallon, your price is now $4.78 CND. $4.68 CND on Oanda.com at a Credit Card Exchange rate is $3.61 USD per US Gallon You will get your best exchange rate with your credit card, as you will get the banking exchange rate, plus a 2.5 - 3% commission for the credit card company. You will lose more exchanging your US cash to Canadian Cash at and back or exchange office, and independent stores could give you an even worse exchange rate. I hear the A&W restaurant in Dryden takes US dollars at par. Thats a 20% loss. Gas in International Falls is $2.64 USD per US Gallon. Gas in Dryden is $3.46 USD per US Gallon So Yes, fill up on the US side before crossing north at the border. Then if you need to, buy enough in Canada to get back across the border Now dont get me started on where to buy your beer and booze."
