4026186,Deer Lake 1,2015-07-06 17:33:00,12,"Returned last night from Temple Bay Lodge 5 Nights 4 days Central Wisconsin Bus Trip. The Walleyes were on the humps and in the weeds. Biggest Walleye in our boat was a 29"" . The three of us in my boat caught more than 10 fish over the 23"" slot size. Had over 30 ""eyes"" in the slot and more than two hundred under the 18"" slot for 4 days of fishing. Had shore lunch everyday and put my self on a diet this week, just too much good food at Temple Bay. Biggest Northern in our boat was a 34"" and released (just under the 35"" slot limit). Didn't really chase Northerns. All were caught while using jig and minnow for Walleyes. All our fishing was with Jigs & minnows. The jig color differed from day to day. First day plain jigs worked, second day white with pink tint was hot for the day, third day chartreuse and orange with an eye, Saturday our last day we all used different colors and at one time on one hump we all had on an over slot fish on at almost the same time with different colors at 3:00 on a sunny 80 degree afternoon in 12 feet of water. It was crazy good spectacular fishing on Eagle Lake again this year. Some of the guys on our bus have been taking this bus trip for 23 years to Temple Bay Lodge they must do something right to have guys come back that many years. This was my 10th trip and plan on heading back again next year. Jeff and the staff should be complimented on a great week for the 47 fisher persons on our Central Wisconsin Bus. Just a side note one of the guys in the camp was trolling a hump with a Rapala in the evening, caught and released a 50"" Muskie. Watch TB face book page for picture. Also Jeff informed us he has the same price for the 2016 5 nights 4 days fishing package from Wisconsin. Good fishing to All!!! If you any questions I will try to answer. Deer lake 1"
