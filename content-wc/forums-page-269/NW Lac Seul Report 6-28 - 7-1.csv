4018786,Anglin Andy,2015-07-03 06:03:00,100,"Just returned from an unbelievable trip to Lac Seul and Gawley's Little Beaver Resort (Doug and Gail have a fantastic and very reasonable resort. Excellent, very clean cabins and fish cleaning building) on the NW side of the Lake. Three guys, 4 days of fishing and 624 fish. (Sunday 67, Monday 131, Tuesday 154 and Wednesday 262). We fished in the McKenzie Bay area. Techniques used were primarily bottom bouncers with crawlers and some leeches, we also jigged some and also were casting into wood and weeds as well. Biggest Walleye was a huge 30.25 inch fish. A few 26 inch fish and a number of 24-25 inch fish. Northerns were also part of the mix with a 39 inch fish a couple 37 inchers on down and a few ""Sumo Smallmouth"" The neat thing about the trip is we did not have another boat near us the final day and for 90% of the trip did not fish near others at all. Trust your electronics (Lowrance HDS 8 and Elite 7) and keep moving until you find the fish. Depths varied from 5 feet while casting along weeds to primarily 10 to 15 feet. The final day we drove to a area while working around a island and then fished a 100 yard diameter area for the majority of the day and then worked around the other side of the island to wrap things up. Did not start the main motor until leaving. If you get a chance to take a trip to Lac Seul, go for it, you won't be disappointed. Anglin Andy"
4019978,Shotgun,2015-07-03 15:56:00,759,"Andy, thanks for the update. Will be on Lac Seul in a few weeks. If you don't mind - what were you running behind your bottom bouncers, i.e., snells with spinners, colors, bare hook, etc...? Thanks"
4020082,fishron,2015-07-03 17:57:00,317,"Great report, glad to hear Lake Suel treated you well. I'll never get that far west, but I'm glad you have such a great resource."
4020106,Guest,2015-07-03 18:12:00,0,"Once crossing the border, which route is better for trailering a boat to Gold Pines resort in Ear Falls? Left is 71? Right is 105? Thanks !! Glad you had a good trip, hopefully you left a few for my Dad & I."
4021114,Larry S,2015-07-04 09:28:00,665,Badger Once you cross border at Ft Francis you drive on Hwy 11 either West to Hwy 71 or Right to Hwy 502. Both 71 and 502 go North to Hwy 17 then at 17 you turn Right off of 71 to 105 or Left off of 502 to 105 71 is longer but Hwy is better surface. Either way you have to get to 105 North to get to Ear Falls
4021138,LoDo,2015-07-04 09:44:00,721,"IMO, both roads are fine for all vehicles pulling boats."
4021178,Guest,2015-07-04 10:07:00,0,"Thanks, it's been years since we've been there and with Dad closing in on 80 years young, not sure how many more he'll experience so I don't want any travel problems. We headed west before, but several posters seemed to go east to 502, so I'm wondering which route has better roads? Thanks !!"
4021338,Larry S,2015-07-04 11:43:00,665,"71 is in better shape, less isolated and has a lot more places to stop for gas, rest stop ETC. 502 is more isolated, the road winds a lot more and if you should break down no gas stations.502 will save you some time, but depending upon what you want its your choice on which road to take"
4021370,Bill Krejca,2015-07-04 12:30:00,6107,"I believe I figured it out once, and taking 71 is about 20 miles more. That said, I would prefer to take 71, due to it being straighter. I took 502 once on the way up, liked 71 on the way back better. Bill"
4021770,fergiefish,2015-07-04 18:59:00,197,"Sad day today as we left camp to return home after a great week on Lac Seul. Great fishing with over a flat and one half of crawlers and two pounds of leaches consumed by hungry walleyes. We cut our crawlers in half to make them last longer. My nephew and wife with their three young children caught more fish than they could imagine and can't wait to go back next year. Most fish were in 4-12 feet of water. Caught a few in the 14-16 foot level but did not need to go that deep for the most of the week. Very surprising to find them very shallow with little wind and sunny conditions. Fished the NW main body on islands, Steamboat on weeds, and Mackenzie on sand as well as structure off islands. Fish were everywhere and had to be one of our best weeks in many years. Spinner rigs were the main lure but we caught fish on jigs, cranks, and spoons. Largest walleye was 29"" with lots of 21"" to 26"" fish. Everyone we talked to at camp did well for quantities and quality. A great fishery with a solid future to remain so. Booked for next year and counting the days off already."
