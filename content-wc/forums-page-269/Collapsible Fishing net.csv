Currently we have your regular net that takes up some room and at times is in the way. For those that use the collapsible net is it worth the price? I've heard getting the net out of the handle is easy, however getting the net back into the handle can be a pain. Id like to hear a few opinions. Also, what collapsible net do you prefer?"
4022290,oger,2015-07-05 06:32:00,46,I have a frabil works great. The basket folds in half and handle slides forward. Cost about 55. Would buy another if needed.
4022514,SinOrSwim,2015-07-05 08:00:00,1528,I have a Cabelas that folds in half then the net slides up on the handle. It is awesome. Originally bought because we flew in.
4022626,rnnonmt,2015-07-05 08:48:00,992,I have the Frabil Hyber-net. I like it mostly but some days I want throw it in the lake. The Pros are that it doesn't take much space but the Cons are sometimes it wont fold/collapse properly and the net is a string material so if you have barbed hooks and happen to pierce at a knot it is a pain in the a$$ to get it out. If you pierce the string any where else it comes out easy. One of the things I finally figured out that if the net gets reversed (inside out) that is when you will have trouble collapsing it.
4023866,halfmoon007,2015-07-05 19:46:00,121,My little brother ( Wes Winkleman ) says real men don't use a net. For me it only comes out when I hook the big one. and its DAVE GET THE NET ( my son ). I have a colapsible because we do fly-ins. A bit funny when you get the BIG one to the surface and its about a 8LB sucker. then its ah forget the net. Good luck all Halfmoon the camp cook
