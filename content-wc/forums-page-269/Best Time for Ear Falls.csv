What time of year do you think is the best fishing? We when this year for the opener and the weather was bad due to heavy rain and snow. Cold front really slowed fishing down for the larger fish. We have also gone in late August and have ended up going down to McKenzie Bay. Don't really fancy that boat ride everyday. So looking for recommendations for next year. Thanks

It took me 30 minutes to get to the Big Sand Bank moving at about 32 mph, as long as I could maintain that speed. Usually, I'd have to slow down to 20ish once I hit the bay, due to my wife's bouncing kidneys. My impression is that there are a lot of good early season spots in the Ear Falls area, and the main body of the lake is better in mid to late summer, but YMMV. There's the long-standing debate over trying to time the pre or post spawn big female feeding frenzy, versus the more stable weather and predictable walleye patterns of mid summer. Anytime you can get on Lac Seul is the right time to fish, in my opinion."

Later in the summer the fishing can be good maybe not fish after fish,, but still decent, windt points can hold fief, trolling humps can work too. Breezy Point can give some good tips on late sesson fishing near Ear Falls."
