Any one been down this road lately? Pulling my ranger reata boat and wondered the condition of this road and the ramp at Esox landing?Also is there an easy access to Bat lake? Good enough to launch a heavy fiberglass boat?Thanks!"

Didn't pull a boat, but the road was in better conditions than I expected. It is certainly better than some of the gravel roads where I live in Nebraska. It's a little narrow in places and lots of sharp curves where you have to be careful of the rare vehicle coming the opposite direction. But, I wouldn't hesitate in making the trip. Don't know anything about the landing at Bat lake."
