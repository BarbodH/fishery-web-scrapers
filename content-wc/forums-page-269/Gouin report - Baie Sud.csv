Fishing was fair, I had a few very good days but a few poor days....bluebird sky & little wind (no chop). No problem filling our quota of walleye and ate walleye all week too. Biggest pike was a tad under 40inches. Road into Parent and to Clova was perfect. All the bridge approaches are now paved...no more depression before & after the bridge deck. FT"

4023418,fishron,2015-07-05 17:23:00,317,I've seen marks like that on pike that are overly aggressive and from wild areas. The pike will actually go after the prop and turn at the last instant. The result on the last minute turn are some healthy gashes on the pikes rear body. Just a theory from past experiences.
