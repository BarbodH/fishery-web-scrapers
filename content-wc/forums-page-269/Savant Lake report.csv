The short version: If you can't catch fish on Savant, you should probably quit fishing and take up golf or bocce or knitting. The longer version: My crew didn't chase lakers at all, as we had four kids in the group and they don't mix well with the patience needed for lake trout fishing. Also, it was pretty windy for a good chunk of the trip, and the main lake can get awfully rough...not fun for the kiddos. Pike fishing was OK, but no giants...plenty of fish from 33-37"" caught. None of our boats really spent much time targeting pike, so it's hard to say if the big fish were eating or not. Walleye. Oh, the walleye. This year was easily the best trip for big fish that I've had, though I've had some trips that were better for numbers. Three members of the group caught their personal best walleye this time out, including one guy who caught his PB. Then bettered that mark on his next cast. Then topped THAT on his very next cast. It was his first time to Savant...needless to say he is sold on the lake now and will be back next year. The first day, I caught fish of 26"", 27"" and 28.5"" in the span of five casts, and had an even larger one toss the jig just as she was being netted. Far and away more 22-26"" fish than I've seen my group catch in any previous trip. 1/4 oz glow-white jigs tipped with a minnow were by far the best, but fish were caught on crankbaits, spoons, and twister tails as well. The wind shifted every day we were there, which made it interesting to figure out where to contact the active fish, but we found a great bite each day. The first day most of the fish my son and I caught were in 3-7' of water. Two days later, a strong NW wind made boat control challenging, but it stacked big fish up on windblown points in 12-14' of water. The last day the wind flipped to the NE and eventually died, which made for the toughest bite of the trip, but downsizing to a 1/8oz jig and vertical jigging over deeper (16-20') water produced plenty of fish. Safe travels to all who are taking trips this summer, and best of luck!"

Didn't take many, as the challenges of helping my 11 year old, keeping the boat off the rocks in windy conditions, and just wanting to catch fish more than I wanted to take pictures of fish Lots of pike the size of the one in the pic (33"") and lots of walleyes like the 25"" pictured. The third pic is a true Savant double...both my son and I hooked up at the same time, and he netted both in the net at the same time. Fun stuff!"
