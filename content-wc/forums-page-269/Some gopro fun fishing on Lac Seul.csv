I only have about 100 more clips to go through (3 days worth) Jimi and Pat (PJ) have fun on Lac Seul & Eagle. PJ make sure you bring some tobacco for spirit rock. lolhttps://youtu.be/NASJ07hGT2g

4021690,3M TA3,2015-07-04 18:15:00,2846,What kind of landing net was that? I think I want one if it's sturdy.
4021706,rnnonmt,2015-07-04 18:19:00,992,Thanks Mark. The Z is a cool place. You can really open it up through there. I sped the video up to 200% because I really wanted to see what 180 mph looked like through the zig zag! lol!
4021730,rnnonmt,2015-07-04 18:26:00,992,Its a frabill hyber-net. It is very sturdy. I like it for the fact that it stows nicely away but the net is a string (not rubber) type and if you have barbed hooks.... LOOK OUT.... if a hook goes through one of the knots in the net. Plan on a few minutes of curse words while everyone else is still fishing.
