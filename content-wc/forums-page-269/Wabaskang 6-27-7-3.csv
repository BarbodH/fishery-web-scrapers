4025481,Big Mike,2015-07-06 12:49:00,35,"Just returned from another trip. This trip was all about the big fish as my report will reflect. As we arrived on Saturday morning we were greeted to hundreds of mayfly carcasses floating around the docks at Jim's. I knew this was going to make things tough for walleye fishing unless we were willing to work our tails off and try many different tactics. I turned out that the best way to catch our eater and other decent walleyes was to go with a super light jig and cast the cabbage weeds for them with either a minnow or plastic. I prefer plastics when weed fishing because the weeds ruin the minnow too easily. These walleyes were easy to catch if you were willing to fight off the weeds to get to them. Several walleyes over 20 inches were caught and released by my boat, mostly in the upper stretches of Wabaskang in Mean Lake and Gawley's Bay, not far from Peffleys resort. Our other technique was to troll large stickbaits at night down in Jim's part of the lake. With the full moon making its way on us it was lights out fishing for big walleye! We caught a 28.5, 28, 27, and numerous fish in the 24 to 25 inch range. All of these fish were released to catch another day. This bite only occurs for me every few years but when the moon is full in June and July you need to take advantage of it. Whether its weedlines, rock shores, or over top of deep reefs, the walleyes move high in the water column and are very aggressive from sundown all the way into the night. I also spoke to several groups at camp who were able to beat the mayfly hatch blues by pulling spinners with crawlers mostly down in Keynote. Several limits and fish frys were able to happen thanks to that tactic last week My favorite species to target, big pike, did not let us down either. My good fishing buddy Kevin Reints was along in my boat this trip and he put on a clinic that myself and youngest son was able to watch (much to our dismay!) He caught a 41, 43, and then a whopping 46 inch beast that is the biggest I have ever seen personally in my boat or Jim's camp for that matter. We did manage to boat another dozen or so pike between 36 and 40 inches so it wasn't a complete failure on our part! All of our big pike catches were done on the edge of deep cabbage weeds throwing big jerkbaits, glide baits, and large shad bodied plastics in the 10 to 12 inch range. The window for these huge fish is closing quickly as water temps will push them out to deep water soon but don't be afraid to fish the deep weed edges if they have strong wind hitting them....I can't wait to get back up in a few weeks and will give another report at that time. I look for the walleye action to really heat up as the mayfly hatch will conclude and the walleyes will start to stack up on rock structure. Pics of some of our fish should be found on Jim's website or facebook page soon. Thanks, Big Mike"
