4021154,Skiball,2015-07-04 09:58:00,82,I would agree with Mahkwa as well. Great location . Nice camp to fish out of. Walleye and Northern fishing do not require long trips. Our longest trip to fishing is 20 mins. You can be on good fishing within 10 mins. Been fishing out there for over 20 yrs.
3988330,Guest,2015-06-22 10:11:00,0,"Looking for advice from all you Lac Seul fisherman. Possibly heading up the first or second week of Sept and not sure where to start. What camp do you recommend that time of year? East,west or central - don't really want to travel 30 mins to get to where the fish are that time of year. I have fished a lot in the fall in Canada and wind can be a big issue so really don't want to have to cross big water if it is too rough. From the searches I have done it looks like the camps near Ear Falls are a good 30 min ride that time of year-closer in the spring though. Thanks in advance for your suggestions."

3989746,Pooch,2015-06-22 18:55:00,4619,"One group I fish with fishes out of Mahkwa over Labor Day. Some times we fish in shorts and other times we have as many clothes on as we have with us.You are considering going a little later so I'd be prepared for about any weather. We have moved the Labor Day trip up and this year will be going ten days earlier in an effort to avoid the chances of an early cold snap while we are there. Most areas of LS have a fair amount of open water unless you fish from the Hudson area east. LS is so large that I doubt you can ever really avoid an occasional rough ride sometime during the trip.Probably the most open water part of LS that we fish is Ear Falls south to Windigo area. I've never been that far as it is just too far in my smaller boat.As good as the fall fishing is in the Mahkwa area, I have to believe it's like that all over the lake. Fish are really predictable at that time of year, or at least it seems that way. Deeper water in the main lake basin. Structure, structure, structure most of the time seems to hold fish. Anything the fish can relate to seems to have few fish on it.Lots of choices. Pretty in Canada at that time of year.Pooch"

3990354,flntknp17,2015-06-22 21:28:00,151,"I fish Lac Seul second week of September most years out of Goldpines at Ear Falls. I really like fishing this time of year up there......never have to share a spot and the big fish are feeding heavy most times. Fewer numbers of fish than summer (like 30 per day instead of 50 or more per day......), but most of them will be over 20"" on the right spots. Generally much deeper fishing in the fall often 25'-35' pulling big bouncers. Great pike at that time too and often few bugs. Nice fall colors etc etc......I am going twice this year to experience both summer and fall up there. Let me know if you decide to fish anywhere from Manitoba Point west to the dam and I'll point you to some fall spots. Matt"
3990794,vaquero01,2015-06-23 06:08:00,101,"Try Onaway Lodge. It is about 17 mile south of Ear Falls. For the last 2 years the wife, dog and I have gone the last week of August, this year we are going for two weeks. Great camp, cabins, boats, owners. Check out the web site."
3990818,pjshorthorn,2015-06-23 06:21:00,5654,"I've taken a few trips the 2nd week of September to Lac Seul Outposts on Chamberlain Narrows. My experience has been that there is normally plenty of availability a that time of year. They will take singles on a trip as well. There are many great fishing spots within 1-2 miles of camp and if the weather does get rough, there are plenty of places to get out of the wind. If you take a look at Google earth, you'll see how the river comes through the area which presents prime fishing dropoffs from 10 fow to 40 fow quickly. As mentioned, the numbers of fish will not be the same as post spawn, but the chance at big fish is much better. My first fish a couple of years ago was 28 1/2"". The 17-18"" fish were fatter and more frisky than I recalled when fishing spring patterns in the same spots. FWIW..... PjShorthorn"
3990946,SinOrSwim,2015-06-23 06:43:00,1528,"We fish the 2nd week in September out of Onaway. Our best fishing is about a 45 min or more ride typically. We like to be out by Manitoba Point. There is fishign closer but our best luck for the most part has been further away. Great cabins, great boats, facilities absolutely top notch. No question. I'm unable to PM you because you are a guest but if you are looking for owners who will show you where to go, give you tips and pointers or just chat............probably not the place. But, we are pretty self sufficient. The fish house is one of the nicest ones you will find."
3993010,dan cardinal,2015-06-23 16:15:00,64,"I would second Williams lake Lodge in September. It is somewhat of a haul to the best fishing... 40 minutes. But it will be worth it in my opinion. Ken and Kathy are great host. They provide excellent boats... nearly new 18' Crestliners with 40 H.P. Yamaha's that will take rough water with ease. Half the trip from Williams Lake Lodge to the main body of Lac Seul is creek... no big water. The remaining is sheltered by Williams Bay. Not until you enter the main basin outside of Williams Bay would there be much concerned with potential rough water. In my opinion The mouth of Williams Bay and the immediate availability to the main basin from there, offers some of the best walleye fishing there is to be had on Lac Seul. The other plus... Ken and Kathy offer a 10% discount off regular rate in September."
4008130,Steve Ediger,2015-06-29 11:52:00,97,"If you can get in, Lac Seul Lodge is a great lodge to fish out of in September. Lot's of places to fish close to camp, and the lodge is great. Steve"
