Mishagomish will have to wait for a trip by its self that sucker it up there I did talk to the Cree Chief (abelskitchen) and have his contact # His prices were not bad for the quality of fishing Fishron the trip to Doda may just do that, no outfitter on the lac. Name for outfitter Is Walleye Ron's"
