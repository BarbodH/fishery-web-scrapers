3982610,jWN,2015-06-19 19:46:00,62,"Looking for a special Lodge or outpost camp to take the wife for our 20th anniversary.I have been to Big Sand lake outpost 2 xs so far (once for 10th anniversary and 1 time for dads last trip but he did make another this year) and they were great but looking for an upgrade for the all around fishing for our 20th. I am thinking I would like to hit the NW territories for big pike and Lake Trout but I am an avoid walleye fisherman. Guess ideally a lodge in Northern Manitoba or SAK that has all 3 would be great. I also am not against suggestion for Ontario but only want suggestions that truly have trophy opportunities and have been experienced by the poster. I understand all of Canada you have the opportunity of a life time but there is a cut off line of which ones can really deliver on a regular biases. I have looked at Ganglers a lot but am hesitant due to some internet feedback. (Not sure on the feedback) I am not looking for something like Wollaston due to we (wife and myself) Are not a pampered type and would only like a guide to show overview of lake /area then we would like to do most the rest on our own. I know there are smaller operations in all these area mentioned that would be up our alley just do not know all of the ones to look at. This may seem like a large order but I have some years to research just looking for ideas of who to go with and where they are located. This is what I am looking for I guess and please do not suggest the common spots, I understand fishing can be tremendous or bust due to many variables but am looking for a truly good chance at the trip of a life time.1 great fishingA walleye would be great but have caught undeliverable numbers in the pastB Lakers a great plus but a 10 or 20 day average not it unless the size is 20lbs plusC pike I generally hate dealing with but 36 in above is fine with a chance at several/many 40in plusD Grayling would be a plus also as long as it wasn't a fly out to find them or 100 cast a fish (not what I am looking for)E All we need is great fishing water fair accommodations and good equipment to use. (Boats, motors, lodging)I know this is a tall order but also know there are these places out there. Basically we want to fly in have minimal assistance, great fishing and decent do it yourself trip with the luxury of a cabin and cook house with fridge stove, good food package and accessories. (Shower would not hut but would trade for out of this world fishing)"

Both produce incredible fish/experience. You're going to pay a little extra for both! Enjoy wherever your travels take you. Congrats on 20yrs!!"

It has lake trout and pike (some quite large) as well as world class grayling in the Kazan River itself.Most interestingly to me is a 10 minute run down river from camp brings you to mammoth Ennadai Lake which is over 50 miles long and pretty wide in spots. Very much unexplored and unfished it has virtually untapped fishing potential for trophy lakers and pike.The outpost is spartan but very comfy with an indoor flush toilet and solar electric lighting. All food is provided - Kasba flies in all the same 5 star food they feed their guests at the lodge for you in advance.For what it's worth I did a HUGE amount of research on a bunch of different locations and ultimately settled on this camp myself. In fact I leave with my son next Tuesday for 8 days and literally cannot wait!!Within 3 weeks I'll have a huge stockpile of video and photos from this location as well as some valuable first hand knowledge which I'm happy to share.You will easily find more luxurious camps - Steven's Nicklin with Ganglers is one example - but you'll be hard pressed to find another camp with the amount of varied and different water to explore along with its fishing potential and spectacular scenery."
3984858,jWN,2015-06-20 19:43:00,62,"Thanks for the input guy'sMike I would like to hear more about some of the lodges you did research on. I think I meet a guide from Kasba a coouple weeks back while we were camping at Reed Lake in Manitoba but did not have a chance to talk alot about the place. nI guess I am in the belief that there are some small operations that keep it small for a reason or due to just getting going that would be up my alley but it is hard to find these through genral serches on the web, so I am all for any and all info I can get. Thanks"
3985554,SinOrSwim,2015-06-21 07:28:00,1528,"Went to Hawk Lake last year and didn't have great luck with walleye but that was explained prior to arriving. The time of year we chose wasn't the best. We are heading back up next week. Take a look at their fishing reports from this year. That said, I have been going up for over 20 years and it was easily the best service I have experienced. They unload your gear and take it to the cabin to the food and the fishing. The smallies were amazing and my son and I had a blast. That and you have a ton of out lakes to portage for the day. Boats and all equipment was in fantastic shape too. Be a great place for an anniversary trip. Food is great, the cocktail hour from 5 to 6 was a lot of fun and had great appetizers. The lake isn't that big but it is deep and very easy to get from place to place. http://hawk-lake.com/fishing/weekly-fishing-report/"
4024010,jWN,2015-07-05 20:30:00,62,"Kasba is definitely a place of interest but I am already struggling with the thought of no walleye.(even thou I have had tremendous trips for them) Anyone with any other suggestions please post up, I know there are a lot of smaller operations with all 4 of the species available. It is just hard to find info on anything other than the big operations."
