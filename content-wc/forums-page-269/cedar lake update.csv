Fishing was ok.not fast but fairly steady.lake is still being effected by the mayfly hatch.you can still catch fish just rakes some patience and some moving around as certain areas are better than others.deeper fish were biting much better than the shallower areas.weed walleyes were tough to get.wed produced real nice fish.my wife and i still boated quite a few and were all over 18"" caught some up to 26.5"".only caught two walleyes under 18"".taljed to some WC members at two different camps and they also said the bite was down some buf everyone still caught fish.went out yesterday for some muskie and smallmouth bass.caught a 35"" tiger on my third cast.lol.saw two mid 40""within a hour and a half.those fish came off the rocks.weed beds are really popping up now.so i suspect the muskie fishing will get going there.checked out some different areas for bass.they were biting pretty good.used a popper and a tiny torpedo.worked real good.need to be patient again as they seemed to be deeper of the bank.needed to leave the lure a bit but had some awesome top water explosions.think this next week will see the walleyes back in there regular mode."

4019018,fishron,2015-07-03 07:36:00,317,"Nice fish, good report. I'm glad to see the larger walleye that most of us will return to the water to be caught another day."

4025369,Knutson21,2015-07-06 11:51:00,348,"Just got back from Cedar Lake, Northern Lights on Saturday July 4th (Group of 5 Guys). The trip was good. We caught many walleyes 23"" and over, with multiple, 28, 26, and 25"" caught during the week. That was the good part of the trip, what we did struggle with was the quantity of walleyes, the 12"" to 18"" that you would expect to catch all day long were not found by our group. In fact talking to others at the camp and on the lake we found that no one was catching numbers of walleyes. I was one of the WC that John talked to at the Northern Lights Camp. He launched his boat from there. I enjoyed talking to John and his wife, they were very friendly and helpful with a few questions we asked them. If anyone was looking for a guide in that area, John should be the first person called. One day we did trailer the boats over to Clay Lake / Wabigoon River and did very good that day, we found the quantity we were looking for, there was definitely non stop action. We raised about 8 Muskies on the week about half of those were over 40"" and one was over 50"" but could not get any of them to strike. It was still a rush to see them follow to the boat. The weather was great for the week, and on the hot days, we had smoke haze blocking the sun to give us a break from rays."
4026162,prov1800,2015-07-06 17:24:00,5010,See you made it home safe and sound.thanks forcthe guiding plug.took some guys out on cedar today.for muskie/bass and walleye.saw a few fish and one of the guys really screwed up on it.lol.we all had a good laugh.his figure 8 wad one of those zig zag patterns.and the myskie that came to the boat really wanted the bait and tried to twist itself to get it.wadnt to be.smallmouth were slow today.we still caught some but i could tell it wadnt going to get any better.they did bring 10 minnows with them (i asked if they had minnows and they said they did) haha.guess i should have asked how many.anyways those minnows lasted about ten minutes.might have been a good walleye day even after yesterdays light show and cold front last night.wad 5c this morning with some pretty good wind.still was a fun day with some nice guys.
