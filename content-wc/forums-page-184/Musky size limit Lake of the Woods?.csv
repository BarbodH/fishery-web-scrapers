5667810,pan-man,2017-07-16 18:29:00,299,I would say a minimum of $300 per removal.
5668402,Obabikon,2017-07-17 05:57:00,2370,"hahaha... this is funny, because 3 of the 5 I removed this year were from one group. Bunch of guys from Louisiana.... insert swamp jokes here. Super nice guys, but just a little careless with the bass lures."
5668506,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-17 06:45:00,447,"I had a little fun at his expense. I had been telling him earlier in the day that I was thinking about switching to barbless hooks on all my lures. He scoffed. As I removed the first hook I said ""Barbless hooks, buddy. Barbless hooks."" He growled a little. The next day I was telling him, a devout monofilament guy, how nice braid is for many casting applications. Again he scoffed. The third time he hooked himself was when he got hung up on a shallow rock and had to break off. About the time he reached max stretch on his mono the lure came loose and rocketed back at him. Bam. Right into his forearm. After hook removal I couldn't help but throw a little jab his way, "" Ya know. That doesn't happen with braid.? Another growl."
5668538,3M TA3,2017-07-17 06:59:00,2846,Never ate one. Do they taste bad?
5668874,Obabikon,2017-07-17 09:12:00,2370,They would taste the same as Northern Pike.
5669714,bthomas3333,2017-07-17 15:04:00,465,"At this point does anyone really think a skin mount would result in a better looking longer lasting mount. If the answer to that is NO then why would anyone kill a large trophy-size Muskie 50 or 60in?I have a 10.5 lb (29.5 in) walleye mount from 1981. It looks pretty rough. I really wish I had released the fish. With the quality of replicas I'd say why not take a bunch of pictures and measurements and let the old fish go.So, is a skin mount really better in any way?B-"
5670394,Obabikon,2017-07-17 20:28:00,2370,"Taking a photo and estimated weight will not qualify you for a record. That's the only real reason, in my opinion. Odds are slim that the 68 year old record won't go down (which many argue wasn't even accurate). Still... if there's a world record fish in your water, can you imagine what that would do for tourism?"
5670538,v-bay gord,2017-07-17 21:40:00,3168,"Yes, but can you imagine what that fish would do for tourism if it was released?"
5670594,Obabikon,2017-07-17 23:43:00,2370,"I get the idea behind that, but articles don't get written about ""alleged"" world records like they do actual world records. There's plenty of debate to be had, but in reality, that fish has very little time left in its life. It is also (most likely) well past breeding stages. To have a certified world record... breaking one of the oldest (if not the oldest) record in all of professional angling....... yeah, that'd be a huge deal."
5664186,eriksat1,2017-07-14 07:56:00,6029,Not trying to start a C&R war here. But I was looking through the Ontario fishing regs. and as best I could tell they are saying the muskie size limit in Ontario zone 5 to keep a muskie is 40 inches. I looked for the special regulations for Lake of the Woods but found none for Muskie. I thought the size limit used to be 54 inches? Did they change it?
5664234,eriksat1,2017-07-14 08:21:00,6029,"Ok I did find it, yes the size limit is still 54"" It seems to get harder every year reading fishing regulations. They split the page instead of going straight across."
5665282,Obabikon,2017-07-14 17:49:00,2370,"Hopefully they bump this to 60"" in the next couple of years. If it isn't close to a world record... no point in keeping it."
5666594,muskyman73,2017-07-15 20:40:00,401,Thanks for taking that crankbait out of my middle finger Jared. I promise that will be the only time I ever give you the finger ! lol
5666658,Obabikon,2017-07-15 21:27:00,2370,I removed my 5th hook of the year today.... new record!
5666882,v-bay gord,2017-07-16 07:06:00,3168,It should be catch and release only.
5666890,NARDA 1,2017-07-16 07:10:00,636,I agree with V-Bay Gord!
5667210,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-16 11:04:00,447,I removed three in two days. Same guy. Everyone should have a good first aid kit in their boat and know basic urgent care including hook removal. Could save your trip and prevent long term medical issues.
5667538,pjshorthorn,2017-07-16 15:37:00,5654,"You may want to inform him that the handle "" HeHooksHimself"" on WC is already taken. Did you take his rods away from him after the third episode ? PjShorthorn"
5667746,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-16 17:58:00,447,"He's 60 YO and, to my knowledge, never hooked himself prior to that trip. Might get him a pair of those steel mesh gloves before our trip next year. He was unaware of the best way to get the hook out the first time. I started to get set up and he said ""Let's just cut it off and leave the barb in there."" I told him that would mean a trip to the ER in a couple days due to infection. He let me do it my way. BTW what's the going rate for an ER doc, I should send him a bill."
