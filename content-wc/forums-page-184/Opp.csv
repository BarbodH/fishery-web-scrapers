Last year I was getting gas at a station in Wawa along with an officer and tried to start a cheerful conversation and he responded with just a stare. About an hour ago I had a tire going flat and had no cell service and I saw an OPP officer sitting in his car. I approached him to ask about a service station nearby and the only thing I got from him was a lecture on driving with a low tire. After ten minutes of berating me over safety issues associated with me driving with a low tire, before he finally ""allowed"" me to drive a quarter mile to a garage. I hope I've just been unlucky and this isn't the norm......."

Speeding ticket, visit to my camp by boat, and when my camp was broken into.They were always nice and never an issue. I did get a lecture when I got my ticket but I deserved it.Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk"

I know that if I needed help that I and my family would count on OPP.This isn't sucking up, its the way I act as a visitor in another country."
5665050,SmallyNut,2017-07-14 15:01:00,11,"No issues here and I've been going to Canada to fish and snowmobile for 35 years now. In fact a very nice OPP didn't give me a ticket for riding a snowmobile inn town when it was the only way I was getting to my destination due to being so lost, in face he escorted us to our hotel, very nice. Had I not been a lost American I think it would have resulted in a hefty ticket."
5665066,Sportdog,2017-07-14 15:12:00,6735,Well I'll tell you fellas you never ran into these guys. I'm here talking to a local and he says the guy is a jerk. So that's coming from someone who knows him. You know I've never actually seen China but I have no doubt it exists. Glad you guys haven't had a bad experience with them. That held true for me too until the last two years.

5665218,packpro,2017-07-14 17:19:00,695,"Two years ago were loading out at a remote river dock for our 17 mile excursion to our camps dock. One of our founding members was back after a year of failing health. He still wasn't quite up to par, but you couldn't hold him back. He was not going to let anyone out work him and he was determined to be the most helpful guy in the group. On this morning it caught up with him. Passed out a few feet from the waters edge while I was parking the car. We have some folks with medical backgrounds in the group and they were on it. He was out for two minutes, but they got him revived. The folks at that camp called it in right away and the OPP was in route and an ambulance. We got our guy up and got some fluids in him. He started to come around but scared us all. He overruled our pleas to take the trip to Dryden and get checked out. He just was not going to let that happen. The OPP officer arrives first, and puts a halt to the ambulance before it ever gets there. Does a thorough investigation to make sure that the event was medical and not drug or fight related. Talks to everyone and is very, very patient with our fellow fisherman. He is professionally insistent (yet respectful) on trying to get his consent to be taken to Dryden. Could not have done his job any better that day. Concerned, Compassionate, Respectful, he was outstanding. End of the story. Our guy was dehydrated. He had beaten cancer four times. He was just done with hospitals. This would be his last trip. We kept a close eye on him all week. He had a great trip.Second event. 2012, Spending a week fishing Wabigoon/Dinorwic. Also booked a one day fly-in to a remote lake with Wilderness Air. One guy was draggin that morning and we had to make up some time. So 1/2 mile out of camp, 6:15AM, on 17 we see the OPP car hit a U-ie has we go blowing by. Lots of colorful language in that moment. Our guy in the backseat is a knucklehead, so we have to threaten him and everyone he knows with bodily harm if he opens his mouth. His response, ""I'm gonna ask him I can play with his gun"" DUH. Anyway, he behaves and the officer strolls up to the window and asks if we know how fast we were going. ""No sir"" ""Well I got you at 126"". I look at him in all astonishment, ""No way"" He starts laughing right away understanding my ignorance of the metric system. Asks where we are going, and we explain the circumstances of missing the flight out for our one day excursion. His response, ""Oh, got fishin on the brain, do ya"". "" Yes sir we do, we've heard good things about this lake"". Again great disposition, great demeanor. He explains at our rate of speed he has to write the ticket, but he'll knock it way down so we don't get killed on the fine. He also states he'll do his best to hurry things along so we don't miss the plane and it's OK with him if we call ahead and explain the circumstances. We'll he does process the ticket fast. Gives us the ticket, still very nice, almost jovial. Wishes us good luck on the day a few times and reminds us not to speed. I pay the ticket by mail. My check is refused twice. I call and explain that I was wrong and want to pay the ticket. I cannot take a chance on having an issue at the border next year. I insist. The clerical person I am speaking with says I cannot pay the ticket, because the ticket cannot be entered in their system. In the US we capture month/day/year. For official record keeping in Canada they do it differently. This officer captured the date of my birthday wrong and they cannot even enter the ticket to receive the payment. I'd like to think he recorded the date wrong on purpose. It always pays to be respectful in that situation."

I know some people... everyday is a bad day, but the idea is... don't let it get to you! I've had several interactions with the OPP... all very pleasant and professional."
5665762,515,2017-07-15 06:22:00,254,"Agreed, wee all have bad days but for the most part living here and dealing with them all the time for the most part they are just doing there just as mandated by law to do. Never take it personally."
