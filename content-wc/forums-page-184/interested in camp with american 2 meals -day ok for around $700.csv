Its a bit of a learning curve and you have to have the energy/mindset to pursue it.I find em but am not gonna share my info because my negotiations with the outfitter are between me and them (implicitly implied and respected)....you do your own homework. In an average year I talk to a dozen outfitters....thats me.I will offer one tip...pick a 1/2 dozen lakes you like and call last minute...tell them you can be there in under 72 hours....see what they throw at you. Works better after July. I did a $5K NWT trout fly-in for $800 because the outfitter had a 5 day window between fly-ins. His words were "" pay my gas"".Win / Win. I remember this trip in particular because as a dum ***, I left my cannonball on the plane for the portable downrigger and had to use a heavy wool sock full of shore rocks in lieu. Worked well. Also, never seen seen so much bear crap so close to a cabin"
5672490,hoppy63,2017-07-18 18:45:00,367,"I think people took question wrong. It was in gest. Seems as though no matter what a person is looking for, price, accamodations, plan, etc......you see some of the same suggestions for place to go, as if people benefit from their referrals. I certainly am not looking for anything, as I have only visited 5 times, 2 outfitters. Just find it odd."
5672626,pjshorthorn,2017-07-18 19:32:00,5654,Me thinks you assume way too much. PjShorthorn
5672674,fishron,2017-07-18 19:45:00,317,This one takes the cake. There's definitely something in the water.

5670762,pjshorthorn,2017-07-18 05:31:00,5654,"I get rewarded with the pleasure of helping someone else out and seeing that they had a great time on their trip to Canada. If I wanted compensation for any of those types of efforts, I'd buy a lodge and make it a full time gig. Just me though...... PjShorthorn"
5670970,wallydave,2017-07-18 06:42:00,2151,I will give info on a Lodge or camp because I have had a good experience or would like to try a new place. Some owners become friends and I would like to see them have some new.business or make new friends! If they offer a discount or throw in a shirt or two that is up to them!
5671626,HeHooksHimself,2017-07-18 12:30:00,725,"People are just sharing the love, brother."
5671674,fishron,2017-07-18 12:56:00,317,"Definitely in your budget, and a drive to in Southern Ontario. Beautiful lake with good accommodations and an easy drive to. Great hosts. Bass, sm and lm, walleye, pike, perch. Not the walleye numbers you will get further north but a price you can't beat. Land o Lakes Lodge near Sharbot Lake."
5672146,NARDA 1,2017-07-18 16:15:00,636,I am just happy to help the lodge out that has provided my group with great fishing vacations over the years. Sure Marcel buys me a few drinks when I'm up there but in the long run I just want the lodge to succeed. Terry

5668322,Guest,2017-07-17 03:50:00,0,fellow fishermen interested in visiting a camp this year from around $700/week maximum american plan 2 meals/day is fine (tired of cooking also include boat; NOT black bear camp on red lake or any camps on perrult or cedar lake (want a drive in situation ) 4 fishermen out of chicago any suggestions would be welcome jim wolf the chicago boys
5668338,prov1800,2017-07-17 04:57:00,5010,Check out north shore lodge on eagle lake.
5668986,troutwater,2017-07-17 09:46:00,299,"May be real tough to find that combination around that price. Clark's is one of the cheapest I know of and they're just over $600 for housekeeping, but the boats are nice and free minnows! I would start looking around some of the very accessible lodges first. I know some lodges advertise a modified American plan where you get just dinner served. I've never tried it but it sounds great!"
5669026,wallydave,2017-07-17 09:54:00,2151,"Eagle Falls is an American plan boat in lodge. They are on Red Lake, with Parker Lake available for fishing. I think they run $800 a week, that includes the meals and Canadian taxes. New owners this year."
5669114,Golden Eagle,2017-07-17 10:47:00,2642,Camp owners need to be able to feed their own families.
5669138,camp chef,2017-07-17 11:03:00,915,True......I can't imagine an American plan with boats for $700.
5669258,wallydave,2017-07-17 11:59:00,2151,www.eaglefallslodge.com Check it out!
5669898,123chadder,2017-07-17 16:59:00,429,"wow,thats an incredible value!i dont know how they make $...it must be a drive to lodge....oh,a boat in...."
5669930,NARDA 1,2017-07-17 17:42:00,636,www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake is $1050.00 Full American Plan (the American plan is unique because you order off of a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing). Give Marcel a call 807-227-5262 and see if you can work something out.
5669946,hoppy63,2017-07-17 17:48:00,367,How much do people get for recommending outfitters??? Is it monetary or free/reduced fees or what? Just curious.
