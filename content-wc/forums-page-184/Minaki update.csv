Weather was perfect, just a little rain on Tuesday, water levels were about the same a last year and in my opinion pretty normal for up there. We caught tons of Smallmouth on topwater in the evenings, the biggest being 19 1/2, smallmouth for the most part were well into post spawn. Walleye were caught in just about any depth it seemed, I don't normally target walleye but we managed 2 26inchers for the week and a number of slot fish. The crank troll didn't seem to be into full swing yet on Big Sand, at least not for us. The highlight of the trip was a 42 inch Pike that grabbed my 17 inch bass on the way in, landed both. Last but not least, bugs. The skeeters were pretty much non-existent, which surprised me, the deer flies were the peskiest of all but not too bad. Travel to and from the states was about as simple as you can get with no delays either way both coming and going on Saturday afternoon. Overall another good trip to Canada."
