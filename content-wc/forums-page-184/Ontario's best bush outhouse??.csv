Just a platform with a toilet seat. No walls, out in the middle of nowhere. Had to take the paper with you from the cabin. One step ahead of the old scouting cat scratch."

Yeah, I know, it's not a Canadian bush camp outhouse like the thread states but I had to put this here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adkNNbinnEY"
5665794,Mike Borger,2017-07-15 06:38:00,1554,"I built a pretty nice one at my camp in NW Quebec. Boardwalk leading to it just off the deck. It's lined with cedar, has a tiled floor, and it's actually a flush toilet. The womenfolk approve."
