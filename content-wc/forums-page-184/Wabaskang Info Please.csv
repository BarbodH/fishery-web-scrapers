5669154,Big Mike,2017-07-17 11:12:00,35,"Jay,I was up twice so far and have had a lot of success. Most recently I returned on July 8 and the walleyes were tough for most because of mayfly hatch but we powered thru it and found the windblown points and shorlines away from mud and weedbeds to be lights out. We casted rapalas and other stickbaits including xraps into 4 to 6 feet of water and pounded a lot of quality walleyes up to 27 inches with several every day over 23. It was a humbling few days fishing live bait until we switched things up and then it was great. Others in camp did well a few days with spinners/crawlers across the weedtops I assume mimicking mayflies. Things will have changed drastically by next week as the mayfly should be gone and the fish should start to transition to deeper structure and the shallow weed walleyes will be easier to catch on plastics without the competition of mayfly smorgasbord. I will be up sometime during your stay as well, look for me and we will chat! Which resort are you at this year? Mike"
