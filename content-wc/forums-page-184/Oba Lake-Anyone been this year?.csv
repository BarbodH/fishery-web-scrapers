5670474,ObaBound,2017-07-17 21:01:00,5,"This is my first post on the forum, but I've been lurking for quite awhile.I'll be headed with my son to Woods cabins on Oba Lake at the end of the week (arrive on 7-22). This will be my 6th trip to Oba over the past 26 years. I have a lot of good memories up there, though I worry that it may not last much longer with the train still not running. I'll be sure to share a report when I get back.Has anyone been on the lake this season? If so, how was the fishing?"
5670602,123chadder,2017-07-18 00:44:00,429,do you mean cameron lake?
5671074,ObaBound,2017-07-18 07:42:00,5,Nope. Oba lake. Here is the link to Woods cabins.http://www.woodscabins.com
5671138,Mike Borger,2017-07-18 08:44:00,1554,Is the passenger train still running? Have always wondered about Woods Cabins.
5671170,WesternAllegheny,2017-07-18 08:52:00,2,No Train!! Very sad as it effects all along the rail. Raises Cost drastically.
5671178,ObaBound,2017-07-18 08:52:00,5,Nope. It stopped two years ago and hasn't started again. You have to fly in with hawk air now.
5671186,ObaBound,2017-07-18 08:55:00,5,"It raised cost for us about $100 pp two years ago. Wish we didn't have to pay it, but it was less than we thought it would be. That was with a party of 4."
5671194,Mike Borger,2017-07-18 08:57:00,1554,That's really not bad at all! Shame about the train.
5671226,ObaBound,2017-07-18 09:07:00,5,It really is. It always felt like we were living in a different time when we loaded all our gear on a train and headed out into the wilderness. I wish I could have experienced that with my son. It stopped the week before I took him up for the first time.
