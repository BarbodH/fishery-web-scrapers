Been busy packing & excited to get on the road in 3 days! ❤️🎣🇨🇦 Thanks in advance! RBF"

5673042,rather-be-fishin,2017-07-18 23:51:00,429,Thanks Aspencreek. Crawlers bought & ready for the trip. Will pick up some leeches at Dutchies. Studied the map & ready to try out some new fishing spots! 🤓 Will post a report when we get back. Hope you will be able to go next year! It sure is the highlight of my summer! 😬 RBF 😎

5674778,rather-be-fishin,2017-07-19 20:47:00,429,Skindzier ~ Thanks for the fishing update. Have been hearing that they aren't on their normal summer patterns yet. So guess we will have to hunt for them. I like fishing South Inlet so will give it a try. Final packing tomorrow & hitting the road bright & early Friday morning! RBF 😎
