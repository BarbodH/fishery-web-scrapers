5653554,TRFDDS,2017-07-08 21:35:00,13,"Two items on one post 1) My dad and I are looking at a trip in 2018, hopefully early June. There is only two of us so some of the lodges and outposts require 4 or more I know. What locations could you all recommend for us that would fulfill these couple things a. good numbers of Walleyes, and pike or smallies as a bonus b. decent boats, comfortable, clean, dry c. housekeeping or american plan possibles 2) Looked at Canada North Lodge on The woman chain of lakes. They have an ""own boat"" plan. While looking at the map, I wonder what types of boats can navigate the channels and rivers between lakes to expand the fishing beyond Little Bear Lake. I have a 18.5 ft. fiberglass Stratos with a 150 HP yamaha. Could this navigate enough to be able to fish a majority of the waters at this Lodge? My first post, Love this forum! Mike"
5653994,Guest,2017-07-09 09:19:00,0,You might look at Bow Narrows Camp on Red Lake. We have been going there for about 10 years and it has been great. They offer every thing you listed. They do have new owners this year so in a couple of weeks we will find out if its as good as in the past.

5655890,HeHooksHimself,2017-07-10 07:51:00,725,"I would suggest a stay with Paul and Debbie at Woman River Camp. There are plenty of boats like yours that use the chain. There is a lot of water and Paul will put you on fish. We will be there in September, but we use camp boats. Check out their website. One warning, the 30km ride from Ear Falls is a dirt/gravel road. May be hard on your boat. Fish On! Hooks"

They are a fantastic outfitter, and, most importantly, would more than likely be happy to accommodate your group of 2. Last year, my brother and I flew into Auger Lake, and MLO was happy to take our small group of 2. I know I would like to return. Their site is www.walleye.ca ."
5678138,wooglin,2017-07-21 13:53:00,371,"I second the motion above to go to Woman River Camp. I was there last year with a group of guys (my first time, their 5th). The fishing is great, walleye numbers are great - albeit we've had better 'numbers' on Lac Seul, the quality of the fish in the Woman River system was better. Fish were bigger. We had a 17'6"" Lund with 115, did great up there. We stayed at the outpost, which was nice because there was nobody else around you. You would see boats throughout the day passing by, but never had any issues with people fishing right up on you. They would run us ice and minnows when needed. I am not returning to Woman River this year solely because I am transforming my trip to musky/walleye and not just walleye. Check this video out I made from our trip in 2016 - great place, highly recommend!https://youtu.be/JuKhH358kgA I will be back though, you can mark my words."
