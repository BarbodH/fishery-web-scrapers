5676522,Ronin,2017-07-20 17:52:00,3,If anyone has fished Melchett Lake (AWO originally and now Boreal Forest Outfitters) in July I would like to hear where they had success for both walleye and pike (and even perch). We are fishing there next July after years of fishing that lake in late May and early June. We did fish it one in August but I know we failed to find all the best spots. Any wisdom and guidance is greatly appreciated.Thanks
