5659074,DaBirdman,2017-07-11 14:16:00,164,"What Pooch said. If I see another boat on the spot I want to fish, or have one move in on us, we're going elsewheres. Lots of places to fish & be secluded. Closest I care to see another boat is probably 1/4 mile. Much closer than that & ill fish another spot unless it's family."
5659154,Baseline,2017-07-11 14:47:00,3207,"I think it depends on the the time of year. If it is a pre or just post the spawn in the spring and the fish are stacked in a river then I would be a patient with multiple boats in that spot. If it is mid June till freeze up and the lake is many miles long and many thousands of acres I don't think there is any reason for some one honing in a spot. About the only exception would be if some one trolled by a reasonable distance and kept going not returning. I've actually had more trouble with my buddies who are on the trip noticing that I have a bite going and driving in right on top of the spot pushing me out. I'm a pretty good sport, but sometimes it's irritating especially if the lake has a good bite going and fish can be found elsewhere. One guy who shows up on a trip every now and then actually has the nickname of ""Prop-wash"" because he is always fallowing someone's boat."
5659202,Lake Wisconsin,2017-07-11 14:58:00,1960,"I think it all depends. If we are only talking Canada - I really prefer some space unless it is one of the community areas such as a narrowing in the lake or confluence of a river. Then closer is okay. 2x's casting distance seems about right. Fishing general structure such as humps, weed line or rocky shoreline, those types of cover can be easily matched in other parts of the lake. I will not stop if I see other there, and hope others do the same. But we all know what happens. A few years back we were on Lac Seul and hammered the fish day 1. A few guys that we did not know overheard us (did not think we needed to be so careful in Canada) and they followed us to many spots after. I did throw out the comment we should just share a boat to split gas, but don't think they caught on. Now in local waters, it all depends. Fishing spring run rivers, expect combat fishing. Mid-summer patters, where the fish are more scattered, no reason to crowd."
5659250,3M TA3,2017-07-11 15:24:00,2846,"Everybody needs to fish Erie at least once when the bite is ON although I think some of you would not be able to fish, at all, because some one would be in ""your space"". Actually I would think it would be like that at many places."
5659306,papadave,2017-07-11 15:41:00,151,It doesn't matter where or how you fish this is just human nature. I have had people at the lodge come over and buddy up to me so they could follow me to my spots (without ever discussing it with me). One season I would take people to a very productive spot and ask them to be considerate and please not come back to it for the rest of that week. That was a joke because by the end of the week nearly every person from the lodge would already be in that fishing spot when I got there. The really comical part was that they would even tell people from other lodges and those boats would be crowded in there too. All we can do is keep a cool head. It's just fishing.
5659338,mickr,2017-07-11 15:53:00,74,"So I am in my 50s, born and raised in Canada, lived for years in Winnipeg. I've fished LOTW and I've fished Lac Seul. I live in eastern Canada now so the fishing lakes I frequent wouldn't be known to most posting here. I hate to upset the apple cart here but something you might consider is that your expectations are misplaced. I know most of you are from south of the border and travel a great distance to get to the lakes in NW Ontario....but you might consider that you really aren't going ""up north"" and you certainly aren't ""remote"" From the sounds of it to me, from what most are posting, you should consider fly in trips to remote lakes. Lac Seul? LOTW? Minnitaki?? Some of the other larger lakes out there with many many outfitters.....IMHO the entire lake is a community hole. 1/4 mile distance? couple hundred yards? the problem isn't the distance between the boats in my opinion, the problem is your expectations. Walleye stack. Do you think it's ok if you are the first guy on a 100 yard shoal that everyone else stays off ""your shoal"" ? I think that is an unreasonable expectation. IDK, maybe it's an American thing because your expectation is you are going somewhere remote and drove a long way to get there. Let me ask you....how many miles of gravel road did it take to get to your remote spot? The outfitter I was at last month we drove about 100 miles on a gravel road (I'm not bothering to mention how far we drove on paved road).....the outfitter had about 20 cabins throughout their territory and on the main lake we didn't see a lot of boat traffic but we did see some and one evening working a sand flat me and the guy I was with chatted with the other 2 boats working it....6 guys, 3 boats...nobody knew the other guys....and nobody thought anything of itI was a heck of a lot more remote than the community lakes you guys are fishing....and I don't find it offensive and never haveone guy mentioned Erie....never fished it.....you should try Bay of Quinte on opening weekend....from the sounds of things you guys would go insane....you can't troll on some of the hotter locations.....there are too many boats to weave through...some guys mentioned two casts...heck a lot of time you cannot cast you'll hit someone"
5659426,orchard frank,2017-07-11 17:03:00,1900,"Long way from NW Ontario now, but did about 30 trips to Lac Seul over a 14-15 yr period before moving south. Other boats were not a big deal to us. If we wanted to stay where we were, we did, or moved on. I was often the idiot waving to another boat if we were on a hot bite or good hump. Sometimes had shore lunch with people met that way. Saw the Anderson boats plenty of times, they may have been fishing those spots for years, who knows. They might fish, but were never rude. Random exploring found us some of our greatest days. Lived up the road from Little BaydeNoc, opening weekend or during a good fall pattern, that could be an adventure. Try to not let it detract from the enjoyment."
5659834,DaBirdman,2017-07-11 21:57:00,164,"I know for my part, it's not ""my reef"" or shoal, or lake for that matter. Not even my country. I can also say that the lakes I fish locally (small 300-800 acre lakes) are not mine either. Nor are the spots I fish on those small lakes ""my spot"". I've never taken ""ownership "" of any spot I'm fishing except the boat I'm fishing in which, yes, is mine. I can go to Canada and raise my expectation of fishing with no boats in sight. Why? Because there are so few resorts with a limited number of cabins where we go. In the 40 years we've fished the lake, being honed in on has never been a problem except on one day in 40 years, and even that wasn't bad. There are literally hundreds to thousands of spots to fish that it's no problem making a short move and you're back on your own without a boat in sight. So for me, yes, it is most definitely an expectation and one that is easily attained where we go. It's part of the reason we've been going to the same place for 40 years. They are never ""my spots"". Never will be no matter what lake or country I fish. You want the spot? Have at it. I can hit any one of 30 other spots where there are likely no boats within a 1/4 mile, or even in sight. üëçüèª"
5660106,pjshorthorn,2017-07-12 06:50:00,5654,LOL....never thought of using music as a deterrent . I brought a waterproof JBL speaker on our trip this year and used it in the boat synced up to my playlists on the phone. The BIL couldn't catch a fish unless country music was playing.........he hates country music....LOL. At one point he couldn't get a bite and made a comment about the music not being on. I turned it on and up popped Alan Jackson....he literally caught a fish within 10 seconds. We had a good laugh over that one. PjShorthorn
5660194,fishmanric,2017-07-12 07:22:00,219,"I just completed a houseboat trip on Lac Seul and was amazed at how far guides and others travel to fish certain spots. These same spots were pounded day after day and became laughable to us on the houseboat. One day we got to pine point and after an hour or so we encountered seven boats and left. After that, we started fishing all our pre trip waypoints and never saw another boat the rest of the trip, except off the houseboat. Lac Seul is full of incredible spots and we found many. There are over twenty outfitters on Lac Seul so there is going to be some boat traffic. All in all it was a great experience for this first timer."
5660586,Rock Lobstar1,2017-07-12 10:01:00,134,"So what's the courtesy during a tournament? When I'm in a tourney and I'm heading to a spot that I picked on the map and find that there's someone there already then I'll pull up (not too close) and ask if they're in the tournament. If they are then I'll fish. If they're just a couple of people out fishing or a family having fun then I'll ask how they've been doing on that spot and then move on. Either to another nearby spot and wait for them to leave or keep heading down the lake. I've had some other tournament anglers try and bully me off of ""their hump"" even though I'm 100 feet away. I just tell them to suck it up."
5663218,Dave Si,2017-07-13 16:21:00,27,Around here we try to maintain 15' between boats and no bumping. Rope anchored boats get to hold their ground. Courtesy goes a long way and boat handling skills are key. Not unusual to see for' and aft trolling motors turning.Non participants keep their distance and avoid the waters if at all possible for a couple of days.
5663410,BrianE,2017-07-13 18:33:00,98,"Man that is crazy.........I recall reading a story quite a few years ago about Bob Crupi (only known person to have caught two certified bass over twenty pounds, one just three ounces shy of George Perry's, and over 150 ten pound bass certified through the I.G.F.A.) One time someone got so close he supposedly drew his off duty pistol and fired shots in the air to warn them away. Amazing what people will do just for a fish."
5665858,ziggyzag,2017-07-15 08:03:00,125,Baseline: You have a problem with your own buddies in your fishing party joining you in a spot with a hot bite? NICE!!!

5671002,TheDFP,2017-07-18 07:15:00,39,I don't like to be able to hear someone else in their boat. I try to keep 1/4 mile from another boat. I only spend 1 week a year in Quebec and go for the quiet and solitude. Every time I had someone fish close to me is on a tough day of fishing and they think you are on fish. I just move on. Plenty of other spots I know and many more that I should try.
5671010,fishmanric,2017-07-18 07:21:00,219,I'm with pooch on this one. Boat tag is not my game.
5660154,steve.a,2017-07-12 07:05:00,274,"I agree with Bill K. on LOTW fall crappie fishing as they are grouped up pretty good. ( The Elbow, Hay ,Nestor Falls, etc.). I have traveled to certain spots only to find someone beat me there so a lot of times I try to find some new spots close as there is no way that any one person can know all the places that fish are holding. Have found some good spots that way and have struck out also. Only time that is real bad is when you are casting a bank and some boat comes in just ahead of you doing the same. Some times it starts leap frog or hand signals."
5658090,The tank,2017-07-11 08:09:00,340,One of about 4 reasons I haven't been back to lac suel for a few years. The last few years we had to many boats think they need to follow us around and fish on top of us. That don't need to happen in a lake that big. The last few years we've fished LOW. Until last year no one has bothered us. Last year twice and this year once the guides from Shady Roost have come fished right next to us?? Boating that far and you have to come with-in 30' of our group. Not so sure about their guides.
5658122,LOW1,2017-07-11 08:24:00,2828,"To some extent it may depend on the lake/river.But 100', or even twice (or 4 times) casting distance is too close for me.As someone else said, if you have to ask or wonder if you are too close, you are too close."
5658146,3M TA3,2017-07-11 08:32:00,2846,"I'm pretty much in agreement with your first 2 sentences. But after you've said something, then what? What happens when they've moved in to say a boats length? Really, what are you going to do then?"
5658362,bigwalleye1,2017-07-11 09:23:00,2632,"I'm not looking for a fight, if that's what you mean. I'll give them a wise-a$$ed remark, asking if they'd like to share a boat next time and split fuel. Point out that I'd like to fish by my own marker if it's OK. Ask where they're from, and then ask if fishing this close is acceptable behavior where they're from because it isn't here. The goal isn't to intimidate the operator, he's there because he put himself there, and he's likely the one with the attitude, since he piloted the boat to the spot even though he saw me there. My goal is to make the others feel uneasy enough to get their captain to move. A little of that, they usually either blast off or move further away.That said, I give boats with Canadian registrations, that are obviously locals, a lot more leeway. If they're locals, and they're going to hump in 20 miles from the landing, maybe it really IS their spot. Besides, I've gotten some decent spots watching where the locals fish."
5658402,Shellback,2017-07-11 09:44:00,8083,"Wait till they have a fish on, crank up the outboard, spin the boat around close to them and pull a hole shot? That's what they deserve. Personally I'd just leave, eventually karma should catch up to them."
5658522,Bill Krejca,2017-07-11 10:22:00,6107,"I think it depends on the situation. Normally, most decent folks don't want to horn right in where someone is already fishing, so some of the distances referenced are probably OK. It can get uncomfortable sitting on top of/getting set on top of another boat. Some factors where closer is maybe OK can be out of the wind due to ..wind, current below dams, or other types of narrows current, possibly drift scenarios where the game is played fairly. I am always reminded of the fall crappie fishing in certain parts of LOW, where folks don't seem to mind being a lot closer to each other, and, believe it or not, actually may develop a friendship with their close fishing neighbors, not as common if walleye fishing. We humans can be strange discriminators. Bill"
5658634,clawman,2017-07-11 11:26:00,2078,"Ha,Ha he is a funny guy. Guess you better buy more marker buoys"
5658978,Hwy 101,2017-07-11 13:07:00,33,"This sounds bad but I use music at times to keep people away. I'm not that guy who cranks tunes across a quiet lake all day, but if you want to fish really close to me uninvited you will get a dose of metal/punk/bluegrass/hip-hop to the point it will be hard to have a conversation in your boat. That being said if the guy communicates a little bit I have no problem working with them to help get them on fish also. My teenage daughter listens to stuff that makes me want to jump out of my own boat.."
5658986,fishron,2017-07-11 13:11:00,317,"I don't mind sharing a drift with other boats ten yards or so apart. Once in a while the drift will pull us closer and I will get back to a reasonable distance as quietly as possible. As long as all boats fishing respect the others in the vicinity as they leave an area and don't rev the motor and take off. A couple of weekends ago, my buddy and I fished Onieda lake in New York. There were a fair amount of walleye fishermen drifting and snap jigging or using other methods. There were a large number of bass fishermen in boats powered by at least 200 horse engines. I never saw anything like it. The bass boats would continually roar through the areas the walleye fishermen were drifting. They was plenty of lake they could have used to go around. Never again!! I can't say it doesn't happen in Canada but you have so many more choices to avoid that kind of nonsense."
5659050,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-11 13:54:00,447,. It can be very difficult to distinguish an anchored boat from a drifting boat. I give both a wide berth but it's quite possible I inadvertently blast through the area you intend to drift through.
5657354,drew59,2017-07-10 19:35:00,87,"The thread about the idiot getting too close got me thinking. What is your attitude about other boats moving in the area you are fishing? I figure it's public water and everyone wants to catch fish. I don't have a problem if a boat keeps a comfortable distance. Maybe 75-100 feet or so away. However, I'm always nervous about moving in on others. What is your attitude?"
5657418,Pooch,2017-07-10 20:25:00,4618,If I go to a spot or area and someone is already there or close. I go somewhere else. That's just me.The only time I fish anywhere near another boat is if it is one of our group and then usually just to chat and jerk each others chain.Pooch
5657426,Aspencreek,2017-07-10 20:29:00,2911,"I use the what I can cast X2. And on a lake like Lac Seul if they are trolling a shoreline they can have it, they got there before me. If the other boats are drifting and jigging 50 to 75 yds is close enough. If I have to move in closer I move on. There is plenty of other spots, and I love exploring new water anyway."
5657490,Obabikon,2017-07-10 21:14:00,2370,"I think if you're worried upsetting someone... you probably are. These lakes are so isolated, unless it is a strange pattern (like LOTW's in the fall) or wind condition (there are only so many spots out of the wind) there is no need to be fishing with other boats."
5657578,Guest,2017-07-10 22:17:00,0,"Sure wish the people that own Andersons in Sioux Lookout would understand this. on a streak of 9 years, generally 2-3 times a week, that they have had a ""guide"" would come settle in right next to me like they didn't even know I was there. pointless to talk to the guides. They just ignore you, say oh sorry and keep on fishing, or best of all...threaten to ""take this matter on to shore."" Called Andersons several times, nothing. Not a care. Even stopped out there twice thinking maybe some face to face honest, friendly communication would help. Nothing. I have never raised my voice, cursed, etc. always 100% polite and professional. Doesn't matter. Rant over. Lol"
5657586,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-10 22:21:00,447,"If I can see you, we're too close. Seriously, if we can yell and understand each other, I will move farther away."
5657858,bigwalleye1,2017-07-11 06:47:00,2632,"While I prefer to have a spot to myself, and will pass on a spot that has a boat on it already, my tolerance level follows Aspen's rule. Cast distance x 2. If I'm on a spot and somebody moves in on me closer than that, I'll say something."
5657898,BornToFish,2017-07-11 06:59:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished a well-known lake in NW Ontario for many years that receives a fair amount of pressure from Lodge boats. I've had my fair share of close encounters with other boats that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. For example, my wife and I were catching nice walleyes on a reef near a shoreline. I took the boat to shore for my wife to take a ""shore break"". Another nearby boat immediately moved onto the spot we just vacated and claimed it as being their spot. Another time, my wife and I started drifting a mid-lake rock reef, with nobody within several hundred yards of us. We eventually drifted over a marker buoy. Then, a boated pulled within a few yards of us. The ""angler"" asked us if we saw a marker buoy. I pointed to the buoy with my fishing rod. He told me that it was his marker buoy and we should not be fishing near it.I learned that putting out a marker buoy on this lake was often an invitation to a problem. I learned to rely on the gps function of my Humminbird rather than putting out a marker buoy. I simply fished my waypoints with the chart view ""zoomed in"". My wife and I now fish another body of water in NW Ontario that has one fishing lodge on two lakes connected to one another. There is much less competition for ""spots"" to fish. It seems that people are much more friendly to each other on the lake when they sit by each other in the lodge for dinner.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5658010,MrSimon,2017-07-11 07:26:00,922,"For me, it's a feeling .... and depends on a lot of variables. You can just ""tell"" when someone is too close. But, I plan my trips to Canada with the intent on not seeing anyone else all week .... so this has never been a problem."
5658058,Dave Si,2017-07-11 07:42:00,27,"After fishing walleye tournaments for 7 years I have become more tolerant of 'encroaching' boats. Sometimes large fish have been pulled up from underneath someone else's hull and sometimes you just feel like a little space. But be on the leader board and you get a following.What really gets me are ice shack owners who feel they own 300 yards of space around their shanty or boat owners who sink an anchor buoy at the entrance to a cove and post ""no trespassing"" signs on the float and expect to have the place to themselves when (and if) they return."
