Bottom line - Our group of 4 landed 51 pike between 40 and 451/2"". Also legions of mid sized pike from 34-38"". There were ups, and there were downs, but the amazing fishing overshadowed anything negative.I tried to explain more in detail where and how I fished in this report. The ""how"" was pretty elementary as the pike were stacked in the bays as well as key current areas and were hitting flashy hardware with abandon.I did include a marked satellite image for every day fished showing precisely which spots I targeted though. For each day explaining where I fished in detail.This should have a twofold benefit.1.It'll give you a clear idea of how I operate on a large lake like Misekumaw and2.No one will have to bug me for a marked map of the lake if they go. There is a ton of fish porn in this story but the honest truth is it's roughly 1/3 of my photos. I quickly realized that scrolling through 5 minutes of fish pictures was probably not a great idea. Hope you like!Cheers, Mike http://www.canadafishingguide.net/mi...pike-paradise/"

5670386,kona77,2017-07-17 20:27:00,236,Mike;Very informative read.. Appreciate you taking the time to go thru all these details.

5671474,DeBo,2017-07-18 11:00:00,211,Great write up Mike! Looks like a great pike outpost to take a trip to! Looking forward to your Gangler's report and how that stacks up to Maria. Buddy of mine is up at Maria right now.
5673434,Kansas Bound,2017-07-19 08:20:00,152,Mike I always enjoy your trip reports. This one was exceptional! It appears in the photos that you use both titanium and fluorocarbon leaders. Which do you prefer?
5673474,Mike Borger,2017-07-19 08:29:00,1554,"Thanks, and sure hope your buddie's trip went well! There's lots of big fish at Maria, but the approach now would be way different than when I was there the first week of June. Would be curious to know how he made out.Quote: Originally Posted by Kansas BoundMikeI always enjoy your trip reports.

Both have a use, but in general I prefer titanium. It's so much thinner and lighter than heavy fluoro. Doesn't ruin the action of topwater baits, or lighter baits."
