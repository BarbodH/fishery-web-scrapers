5675730,LOW1,2017-07-20 11:03:00,2828,If you will be eventually heading north towards Kenora I recommend the Log Cabin restaurant in Nestor Falls on the west side of 71. That's about 60-70 miles from FF.Also there's a restaurant on south side of 71 in Emo. About 25 miles west of FF.Both are good but IMHO Log Cabin is better.In FF you will be driving past a Timmy's and a McD's on your left if those work for you.Have a safe trip.

Do a google search of that name or call them.Hope fishing is good for you. We're heading for the other end of Lac Seul Sunday."
