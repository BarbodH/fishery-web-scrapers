5676154,Bayou,2017-07-20 14:28:00,52,"Well, when I saw them I thought they were too big so back they go and I'll order the 4 1/2"" size. My 7 1/2 "" gran ma plugs came in today and I'm keeping them, lol. By the way what size grubs are a good size for a single hook on these?"
5676178,bthomas3333,2017-07-20 14:54:00,465,I have been using Mister Twister or BassPro 6in tails. Then I rip the first one or two inches off the body so the tail fits better and doesn't make the tail run crooked. A pack of 10 runs about 3 bucks. I have used White / Yellow / Chart / Black.B-
5676594,Further North,2017-07-20 18:55:00,2008,"I've got a ton of the 4 1/2"" versions, a fair number of the next size down and a few of the big ones.The 4 1/2"" have been the most productive over time, except for last week on LOTW where the smaller size outfished them. Dunno why.I've really struggled with the big versions. In addition to not catching many fish, they are a bear to throw and I have a hard time keeping them out of the weeds on slower reels.I also use the stop-and-flutter-back trick; they will fall on a tight line...and it will sett off some following fish."
5674362,Bayou,2017-07-19 16:56:00,52,"I received in the mail today three of the Doctor Spoon Big Game Series which are 5 1/2"" long-2oz, they also have the tinsel tails. I originally was going to order the 4 1/2"" long-1 3/16oz version without the tails but the website was out of them and I ordered the larger size. I opened the box and said, wow these are big. Now I'm thinking I should return these and get the 4 1/2"" which is now back in stock. We are going to Minniss lake which has the potential for greater pike size and I've upped my tackle this year but in years past we've mainly flew into walleye lakes not known for numbers of large pike. Has anyone used the larger spoons in the Big Game Series or does anyone think the 4 1/2"" would be better? The Big Game Series is only an inch larger but considerably heavier. And no, I'm not asking the better half is bigger is always better lol.http://www.yellowbirdproducts.com/st...-copper-swirl/http://www.yellowbirdproducts.com/st...-copper-swirl/"
5674610,Jtmwalleye,2017-07-19 19:10:00,16,"I use the 4 1/2"", 285 Doctor Spoon with tremendous success. I remove the treble and use a size 5/0 Single hook. I attach a 4"" white twister tail. This combination is deadly. I also use a 12 to 15"" homemade floro leader using 40#. Work relatively slow, alternate your retrieves, etc., as most will follow 1st...unless you hit them on top of their head while in the weeds! Then they crush it. The tail adds length and enticement to this Spoon. Most won't believe the numbers of Pike and walleye caught on this Spoon but trust me on this one. Hundreds have been caught (walleye and Pike), just on my most recent trip this year. I personally feel ""bigger is better"" and you already beat me to it in regard to getting the larger Big Game series. I caught Walleye that were as small as the 285 Spoon to northern in the 40's...measured to the ""inside"" of the tail. Regarding the trebles...they just tear up the fish. All of us are catch/release guys...and most of us have been going in the bush for almost 30 years. We either bend all barbs down or use a single hook. I have not seen any difference in hookup rates using a 5/0 hook. In fact, it is waaaaay easier to safely release larger northern without taking them out of the water. We work hard to not take Pike out of the water, to the extent possible. If we do, it is a 10 second pic. You may a good choice with the Doc Spoon and good luck on your trip. If you can, do get a few size 285. John"
5674658,bthomas3333,2017-07-19 19:40:00,465,Can't speak to the larger size. I can say the 4in ones are money in N MB. A number of times they were so hot both my partner and I were both fishing the same lure and hammering the pike for hours. Orange/Hammered Copper=lots and lots of pike.B-
5674706,BornToFish,2017-07-19 19:53:00,1224,"Greetings,It's ironic that this thread was started today. About ten minutes ago, I opened a package from Yellow Bird that contained ten Original Doctor Spoons that were all 4.5 inches in length. I bought one this past winter (copper/orange swirl) on the recommendation of Mike Borger on this forum. I used this Doctor Spoon two weeks ago while in NW Ontario. It's already well chewed up!Obviously, I liked this weight/length of spoon enough to invest more money into this size of spoon.I have a question for JTMWalleye. You mentioned that you replace the treble hook with a single hook and add some soft plastic. How does the soft plastic impact the action of the spoon? I tried this a few years ago with a one ounce Daredevle. The soft plastic absolutely killed the action of the spoon. I might very well give this presentation a try in a few more weeks.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5674954,Jtmwalleye,2017-07-20 06:03:00,16,"Hi BornToFish, In my experience the 5/0 single hook (wide gap...to width of Spoon), coupled with a Mister twister (white) grub did not impede the action. If you work this Spoon a tad slower than most, e.g., 5 of Diamonds, etc., the action is fantastic. Many times I stop and start my retrieve and as the Spoon flutters back, they hammer it as most Pike are following it and it puts the Spoon right in their snoot. Good luck on your upcoming trip. Also, I often ""pinch off"" about 1/2"" of the grubs body so the body runs parallel with shaft of the hook. This has been a great combination. If I don't have a grub on it, it feels naked and my catch rates go down. Best, JTM"
5674994,BornToFish,2017-07-20 06:13:00,1224,"Greetings,Many sincere thanks to JTM for the helpful comments. I will be giving it a try! I'm pretty sure that I have some 5/0 or 6/0 Siwash hooks in the basement along with some soft plastics.Maybe Mike Borger will see this thread and offer comments. He seems to be a surgeon when it comes to Doctor Spoons.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5675026,Mike Borger,2017-07-20 06:33:00,1554,"Without a doubt, you want the 41/2"" size for pike, especially on Miniss. I mostly use those larger versions for lake trout, and once in a while for pike. It's not that they don't work for pike, but the 41/2"" is better.Also don't really like the tinsel tail those big ones come with. IMO it affects the action of the spoon slightly. On most of my larger Doctor spoons I cut the tinsel off."
5675138,Thompmd,2017-07-20 07:27:00,320,"Great post for a guy that loves to catch them but know virtually nothing about them. Do most of you use a single hook and in your opinions does it effect hook up?Also, just ordered a couple from Walmart $4.78ea"
5675330,Mojo-NC,2017-07-20 08:33:00,1929,"Thanks for all of the information. I'm not sure why the same sizes of these spoons in different colors vary so much in cost - maybe it's availability. The orange/gold 4 1/2"" spoons are $4.78 and the pink/white swirl spoons that Mike loved so much in his video are $14 each. Based on his catch rate, I'd say they're still worth it."
5675554,BornToFish,2017-07-20 09:52:00,1224,"Greetings,I ordered several different color schemes of Doctor Spoons directly from Yellow Bird Products (815-469-9686). All were the 4.5 inch size and all were in stock. Many shops around my home had a few color schemes, but not all. These Doctor Spoons were $8.00 each - on par with what the shops are pricing their spoons. Two day shipping was another $8.00. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
