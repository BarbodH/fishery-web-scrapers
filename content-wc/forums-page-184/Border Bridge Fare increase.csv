5671530,Blackmacs,2017-07-18 11:36:00,2121,It may technically be called an international bridge but it's actually privately owned by Boise and Resolute Forest Products.
5671666,johnboat,2017-07-18 12:55:00,2014,Ahem...............both of you...........shhhhhhhh!
5675362,nicko,2017-07-20 08:45:00,508,Momentary mental lapse from lack of fishing....Won't happen again!
5675426,bigwalleye1,2017-07-20 09:08:00,2632,Talking about two different bridges here.
5675458,LOW1,2017-07-20 09:19:00,2828,You want light border traffic? Go to the Lancaster/Tolstoi (sp?) crossing. I once came back from the Steinbach area through there. I pulled up to the US station and there wasn't anyone in the window. I had to honk my horn to get the agent to come out. I think he was glad for the company.
5675474,v-bay gord,2017-07-20 09:20:00,3168,".......and so, if you decide to not stop to pay the toll what are they going to do about it? Will the lady leave the booth and chase after you? Doubt it. Will she phone the border people? Doubt it, not their job. O.P.P? Doubt it. I proclaim this coming Saturday, ""Toll Free Day"" at the bridge in I Falls. Just keep driving......."
5675562,pjshorthorn,2017-07-20 09:53:00,5654,"Ummmmmm.......there is one flaw in your proposal. The border crossing lanes are after the toll booth. I don't think the border agents can deviate from their standard 5 question list; with making change for tolls being one of those deviations under your proposal. There would be utter chaos at the crossing,but I am compelled to get a poster up to the border toll booth by tomorrow night that outlines your proclamation."" Per the Omnipotent Ruler of everything related to fishing in NW Ontario, or at least for everything that can be seen from the screened porch at the Vermilion Bay Lodge, today is Toll Free Day as proclaimed by V-Bay Gord."" At least I couldn't be falsely accused for this particular sign....BTW, How is that Walleye Central sticker working out for you so far ? PjShorthorn"
5675962,LOW1,2017-07-20 13:19:00,2828,Fixed your typo for you.
5667930,Stringbean,2017-07-16 18:56:00,279,"I drove up to Canada and as I passed by Border Bob's,and as I approached the toll station, I read the sign that says cars - $7.00. At this rate, the paper company is making more money from bridge fares than from making paper."
5667978,Hot Runr Guy,2017-07-16 19:11:00,16061,"Not to worry, I'm sure the toll will go down once the new bridge is built, and goverment-owned,,,,,,,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunde...idge-1.3774323 HRG"
5668226,tandm,2017-07-16 21:22:00,679,"Shucks, Now I can't spend as much at Border Bob's"
5669330,LOW1,2017-07-17 12:29:00,2828,"I always wondered why you can't pay the toll in Cnd$. It's an international bridge. Either currency should work. I'm going again in a few days and if I am in an obnoxious mood I might try it. So, if there is a red Ford at the booth and the line is backed up to Rainy Lake, blame me for the delay because it will have been me who got in an argument with the sweet little booth lady."
5669474,Stringbean,2017-07-17 13:35:00,279,"Way back when I traveled up there with a large group, we would stop at the Holiday Station and get a bridge card. It was $10 for 12 crossings. We used it for all the vehicles and then just paid the $4 for each trailer. This ""sweet little old lady"" turned into an ornery old lady. I reminded her that its not coming out of her pocket. That did not go over well."
5669498,pjshorthorn,2017-07-17 13:42:00,5654,"The toll is accepted in both funds when crossing at Sault St. Marie . I thought that was pretty cool to give citizens of both countries the option to pay in their normal currency. My experience at I-Falls was always US funds. Baudette is free.....go figure. I'm thinking the Peace Bridge at Buffalo/Niagra Falls was free too,but I can't remember for sure.Forgot to mention that the toll in the Soo was $3.50 US......pretty reasonable.PjShorthorn"
5670018,law57,2017-07-17 18:22:00,1147,"$7 ??? WTF??? Gas is only a little over $2 and you complain about a $7 bridge fee? LMAO. ****, burger flippers make more than that per hour. There is a solution you know..."
5670194,Stringbean,2017-07-17 19:37:00,279,That extra dollar is cutting into my beer funds.
5670338,nicko,2017-07-17 20:17:00,508,Solution...Cross at Baudette...It's free....
5670402,Obabikon,2017-07-17 20:31:00,2370,"Hey... quit telling people that! I enjoy have ZERO wait times, friendly border guards, and a free bridge. Traffic gets heavy, and who knows what will happen!"
