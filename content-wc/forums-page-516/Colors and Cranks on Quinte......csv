Post up what your favorite colors and cranks are for quinte in the fall as I am sure I am not the only one that is learning!"

1234210,keek,2010-09-08 19:06:00,1003,What about the other styles of Reef Runners? Do you guys use them or do they run too shallow?
1234214,bluedog,2010-09-08 19:11:00,14,yo keeklong time ago for fall fishing @ quinte i was led to the fact of :go big or go home so it is 800 or 900 series reef runnersfor mebluepscould be full of but it works for me
1234225,FISH HUNTER,2010-09-08 19:36:00,161,There doesn't seem to be alot of experimenting size wise come fall here. Bigger baits put fish in the boat on a very consistant basis so there really isn't much incentive to change. FISH HUNTER
1234278,Mark Komo,2010-09-09 05:58:00,867,Wondering if handliners work cranks as well in the fast water areas.
