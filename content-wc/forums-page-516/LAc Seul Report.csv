1233598,Jim6buck,2010-09-06 19:37:00,4,Just got back from Mahkwa 2 weeks ago. Fishing was fantastic. We were finding waleyes on the eastern shores of the two big islands out of camp and to the left. Sorry forgot the names of these Islands.. We were fishing in 14 to 45 ft of water. Fish were harder to catch in deeper water but always 22 inch plus. Both of these islands are close to the 100 ft water. Vaughn Lake was very good and close by. Found a long shallow point and fished 14 ft and could anchor and jig. Lots of big Northerns breaking our lines. Landed one 44 and a few close to 40 on jigs. Had a blast!
