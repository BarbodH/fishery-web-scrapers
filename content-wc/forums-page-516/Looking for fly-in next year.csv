Its a drive too operation and they will take you too outpost cabins (30miles away) which are great. Hot showers, freezer, frig etc, top shelf accomodations. your beer will be delivered if you run out and can pay for 1 day guide to teach you the lake. Walleye & Pike fair too good fishing but truly a great place especially if you are taking some seniors (father & uncle love this place & pushing 80)."
1231024,labsrus,2010-08-27 10:55:00,557,"Background information Been going every other year to an outfitter near Timmins, north of Sudbury. Last trip was a little dissapointing from a few points, cabin in disrepair, boats leaked a lot and outboard motor issues. Fishing was still good. We will have 8 to 10 guys. Looking for a fly-in in Eastern Ontario and might consider Quebec. Target is Pike with a few walleyes thrown in for dinner. We would rather catch 30 to 50 smaller ones each day in the mid 20 inch range with the chance to catch a 40 incher. We are from the Western New York area so we are looking at a drive of around 12 to 14 hours or less. Would like a comfortable cabin with gas lights, fridge and stove. generator for electric and water pump would be nice but not needed. Last outfitter did have showers added recently with hot water that was a nice feature. Looking at mid July thru early Augustfor time frame for trip. This will be High School graduation present to two of the boys going. Thanks"

It's another story if you're paying enough to expect better living quarters and equipment. Many outfitters might be short of cash, so it could be a while before they are able to reinvest into their business. Maybe fishing should be great, rather than just good, in order to overlook a run down outpost. I might be wrong."
1231045,TIGHTLINER,2010-08-27 13:12:00,223,Look around the cochrane and james bay area also around gogoma. There are several outfitters right around each of those areas. I have not used any of them but have talked with one in great detail from the cochrane area. I believe it is polar bear outfitters. He has turned it over to his boy billy and i have not seen the dad at the last several shows. Do a search on ontario fly ins. Probably the best info would come from right here on wc. Good luck..
1231055,octanehi5,2010-08-27 14:08:00,1104,"If you choose to go to Quebec,there are two outfitters that I would recommend, air tamarac has two lacs that they go to both have nice pike and walleyes, and air melicon has alot of lacs. they are both good outfitters, with all the things that you are looking for. I am looking forward to my forth trip to Lac Hebert with air Tamarac next yr. we have caught as many as 850 walleyes and 150 pike in one week, and thats two guys. my personal best on the lac is a #25 lb. 43"" pike, and we are walleye fishermen.you can tell witch is my favorite,There is a small lac next to hebert ,that has boats on it. short walk though the woods.That is catch and reliece only, there are some real monsters in it."
1231088,adempsey,2010-08-27 16:51:00,963,"First, I have never been on a fly in so this info is just what I read on the internet.I read some good things about True North Air Service.Many people recommend Air Ivanhoe. It sounds like that could be the outfitter you were using though?Air Cochrane also seems to be popular.Personally I want to stay here but still trying to get the info about it.Good luck!"

1231654,labsrus,2010-08-30 09:41:00,557,"Thanks for the ideas I wil need to start looking over their web sites and get in touch with any references. We were willing to go back with the same outfitter but the lake we liked is booked. They have replaced the motors on a few of the lakes. I know it is a large investment by the outfitter. But, it is also a large investment by our group to spend a chunk of change with the outfitter. On a typical trip, I will spend with the outfitter around $2400 for both myself and my son on a trip. That includes fee to use the cabin. Fee to stay at lodge overnight before the next mornings float plane trip, Dinner at the lodge Breakfast at the lodge before leaving and after flying out Overweight charges Items purchased in store at lodge. Shirts, Hats Lures Last minute things we might have forgotten"
1231683,jjwillie,2010-08-30 11:58:00,5,"We just got back from a week-long stay with Air Melancon at Natakim lake. A group of 8 guys, cuaght over 1800 walleyes for the week. It was not difficult at all to go out and boat 30 'eyes in an evening. Nothing huge. Most were in the 16-24"" range. I caught a 29"", 7 pounder on an xrap while casting for pike one afternoon.The lake is tea-colored, so you will catch walleye all day. I am a pike fisherman, so most of my time was spent casting for pike. I ended up catching a nice 38"" and a 24lb 43"" pike. The pike bite was a little off this year due to the lower lake levels.I woul reccommend this outfitter to anyone. You would only be looking at around an 8 hour drive from WNY."
1231939,onetimedave,2010-08-31 05:56:00,502,"This might be a longer trip than you are liiking for but look at Atctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. We have used them 15 times. GREAT people, cabins, fishing and the rest that goes with it. I have marked maps of the lakes we have fished if you decide to use them. E-mail me at [email protected]. AWO is www.awonakina.com."
1231946,Guest,2010-08-31 06:04:00,0,"My gang went there 2X and it was by far the best trips we ever took. Look in the archives/search and you'll find some of my trip reports. Air Melancon is one class outfitter, outstanding service, accomodations and fishing. And no, I do not work for them....I'm just an 'ol walleye fisherman."
