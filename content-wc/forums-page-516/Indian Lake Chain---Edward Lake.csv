1231431,81Saluki,2010-08-29 13:04:00,97,"Wishin ...Just got back from our last trip of the year. Fishing was good. We found most walleye deep (20 feet) in the mornings and shallow (12-ish feet) in the evenings. Weather was great (70-80 degrees) except for 2 days when it was really windy with rain/showers.We found a green jig head + blood-red twister tail produced the most fish. Dad also had *some* success with a WidowMaker, especially during the windier days.Had some unintentional muskie action ... they must be hungry. :-) The last and most spectacular encounter came when Dad caught a decent walleye and, as he got it to the surface, a nice muskie appeared with jaws wide open and Dad saw it nail the walleye broadside. A brief fight ensued until the muskie finally let go. That's not entirely unusual as we get such hits at least once a year. But the rest was unique ... I didn't get my line out of the water fast enough during the tug-of-war and when Dad finally got the walleye into the boat, my jig was wrapped around his line. Fortunately it wasn't too bad and he untangled it fairly quickly and tossed my jig back into the water. A couple seconds later, my line went tight and went under the boat. I tightened up some more and then a big fish jumped out of the water on the other side of the boat! It was (we assume) the same muskie. I got it back on my side of the boat and brought it to the surface long enough for a good look at its size ... around 36"". Then it took off again and grabbed some air a couple more times before shaking the jig loose. What fun!!"

1212388,81Saluki,2010-06-22 05:46:00,97,"We returned from our cabin on the chain (Forest Lake) a couple of weeks ago and the fishing was good. Lots of walleye in 6-10 feet around rocks -- mostly in Cobble -- before the barometer went on a roller coaster ride.Saw a handful of muskie and a couple of smallies when scouting holes with the underwater camera. Two of the muskie sightings were around our point … a favorite spot for many people. The smallmouth were really shallow (2-3 feet*).* NOTE: We normally don't get this shallow. On one occasion, the wind blew us into shore before Dad could get the boat back to deeper water and I saw a smallie between some big rocks. During the other, Dad slipped on a rock at the cabin and fell into the water … and he lost his glasses. So we got the little Lund out and looked for them with the underwater camera. First thing I saw after lowering it into the water was a smallie. :-) Never did find his glasses though. :-("
