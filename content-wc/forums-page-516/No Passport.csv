1233314,MorganMan,2010-09-05 15:11:00,341,"There may be some places (ie Minneapolis) that you can get one while you wait?? They were talking about opening a place like that, but I don't know if they ever did? You may be able to find out online or even call the border to find out. The problem would be reentry to US and not getting into Canada. Good Luck."
1231092,walley250,2010-08-27 17:01:00,161,"We have one in our group who has not been on the ball as far as getting his passport info sent off yet. He lost his original Birth Cirt and will not send it off until next week sometime. The passport getting to him is going to be very close to the day we leave. Is there any way to expidite the process, or some sort of number you can get so if the card is not in your hands the day of crossing the border you could at least give them the number and b/c. Also, is the issue getting into Canada or back into the US? And what is the worse they can do if re-entering the states? Make you pay a fine, background check, not let you back?? Hopefully it gets here in time, but I would want to be prepared if not."
1231095,2746,2010-08-27 17:11:00,3206,When he orders his passport he can ask that it be expedited. Last time I checked that service was $65. Worst thing they can do.....not let him back in. More than likely they will reprimand him and let him pass if he has other docs such as birth certificate but know they don't have to.
1231097,walleye88ia,2010-08-27 17:45:00,35,"if they have no passport, they better stay home. pay the extra fee and get it expedited."
1231109,SimilarIsland,2010-08-27 18:50:00,121,If he doesn't have it they'll slap him on the wrist and let him through with a driver's license anyway. My buddy has been through multiple times without one. Makes me mad that I had to pay for mine!
1231128,ILScott,2010-08-27 20:46:00,139,Had a member in our group that didn't have his passport this year. Lives in Colorado and forgot it there. He decided to go and no hassle going across into Canada and no hassle going back into the US. He did have his birth certificate and license.Scott
1231133,Andre (wallyandre),2010-08-27 21:03:00,2274,He won't have any problem getting in Canada without a passport. It's the US Homeland Security that request a passport to get in the US
1231152,walley250,2010-08-27 23:26:00,161,"Thanks for the replies guys. Hopefully he gets it but I think I would chance it if I was him. What the worse that can happen, they send him back into candada and he can do more fishing."
1231195,stumcfar,2010-08-28 08:03:00,451,"Applied for a passport for my daughter this summer. Did the normal channels and had it within two weeks. Funny how they want to see that when we come back to our country, but down south the Mexican border is basically open for whoever, where ever they want to cross and our governement frowns on stopping them, but yet makes it difficult for legal Americans to return from a fishing trip. What a country! Next thing you know, someone will want to put a mosque near the Twin Towers site and it will probably be welcomed!"

1231228,Ashman,2010-08-28 10:47:00,106,"A few years ago I needed a passport, and it was taking a long time to get here. In fact we were due to leave within a week, so my wife called our local Representative and he was able to expedite it through in time. Not sure any one else would have this kind of luck with their rep. but we are from a small area and he was accomodating to us."
