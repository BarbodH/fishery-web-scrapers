What about northern any slot on them? Are you required to kill your fish immediatly or can you keep them in a live well?"

1233445,Muddy Waters,2010-09-06 09:30:00,45,"Non-residents of Canada limits are 2 walleye/day only one of which can be over 18""."
1233492,Guest,2010-09-06 13:42:00,0,So if you stay 5 days you can keep 10 walleye @ 2 per day? Doesn't sound right to me.
