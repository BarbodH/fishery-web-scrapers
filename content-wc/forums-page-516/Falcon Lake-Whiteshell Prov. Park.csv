Falcon is an early morning walleye bite most of the time during summer. I would use Falcon as a home base and drive the half hour to Lake of the Woods. I would consider the fishing opportunities on LOTW's 10 times better than either lake you name. once you get your lake maps, send me a private message and i will give you my phone number."
