1233100,Golden Eagle,2010-09-04 08:28:00,2642,"I'd spend a week on Little Vermilion for huge pike and great numbers of small to medium walleyes. I'd spend a week on Nungesser for good numbers of big walleyes and some nice pike. I suggest going now to check it out for a return trip in 2011.That's exactly what I was planning to do, today, until I went to my doc for a third cortisone injection for an ailing shoulder. I got an MRI instead and will have surgery September 14. Doc says I need it now."

1233110,Golden Eagle,2010-09-04 09:23:00,2642,"Thanks Bill. I've probably had my share of fishing trips, but it still hurts to miss one now and then. Spending a few months thinking of my next one will make my life better. I'll be at the head of my class in rehab."

1233281,Obabikon,2010-09-05 10:30:00,2370,Todd and Jake at Atikwa Lake Lodge are very good friends of mine. They have 8 or more lakes to fish... very reasonably priced!
