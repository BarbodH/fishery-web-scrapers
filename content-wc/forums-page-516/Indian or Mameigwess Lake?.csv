527098,Guest,2003-01-30 19:39:00,0,Mami is a great lake for lake and smaller eyes. The bigger eyes are on Indian. Stop a Gunderson's camp of the south end of Mami ask for Larry and he can give you the low down as to what is happening. He has a launch ramp and live bait. For big northern fish the inlet on Indian. Good luck up there.
527099,Guest,2003-02-03 16:43:00,0,"You didn't mention if you were looking for lodging. Gummies cabins will probably be filled. He has camping with no hookups, but has flush toilets, showers, freezers, and ice. Nothing too fancy but clean and friendly. To get to Indian from Gummies you have a 15 minute river trip. 15 minutes if you don't have anything bigger than an aluminum 16' with a 40hp. There is another camp on the north end of Indian. Can't think of the name (we refer to it as ""the little boys camp"" because of the plush digs). If you have any questions, I usually watch this board."

Stayed at Agimac River Outfitters on the North end off the lake. If Harold is still running it he is the biggest bull****ter in the world. If you would ask him where to fish on that lake he would tell you to ask someone else because ""he doesn't fish this lake"" when we paid our bill they didn't even have the commom couresty to say thankyou."
527101,BD,2003-02-04 15:09:00,739,Did one of your crew #### Harold off? He's allways been decent with us.
527102,Guest,2003-02-04 15:53:00,0,"BD, how was the fishing?"
527103,Guest,2003-02-05 13:58:00,0,"What does it take to make Harold mad? When we would ask to have him fill up our gas tanks he would make it sound like he was doing us a favor by doing his job. I remember one year when it was cold and we asked if he could cut some firewood he said that if he cut it everyone would just burn it up. Well when you pay for a cabin you should have that done for you. When we stayed on Lac seul the owners came into our cabin when we were gone and built us a fire and kept our wood box full.At both resorts the rates were about the same just that one knew h who was buttering their bread. One time someone rernted a motor from Harold and they couldn't get it started and he was really p-off that he had to come out of his cabin and try to start it' I said try because he couldn't get it running either and it probably hasn't run from then on. No Harolds a nice guy as long as your willing to listen to his bullsh#t, but if he has to lift a finger to earn his money then the table is turned. I would rather stay at Flayer's and launch my boat than give hime any money. They never told us about the tax refund either. Screw YOU Harold"
527104,Guest,2003-02-05 15:17:00,0,"I've stayed at Agimac several times. Harold and Isobelle have always been decent with me and my group. It is true that he doesn't know much about the area lakes. But, what is there to know? Fish are plentiful and easy to find in Indian, Barrel, Arethusa, Heathwalt and Elephant. The cabins are clean, up-to-date and always waiting when we arrive. I don't think that there is any resort in Canada that provides cabins with 7 bedrooms for the per person price of 4. Harold does like to BS, but we just cut him off and head for the fishing hole. I personally know of a couple of times that Harold has assisted campers who have had trouble. These people were not even staying at his resort. In my opinion, Agimac is a good camp. Harold comes with it. TGG"
527105,BD,2003-02-05 15:42:00,739,"The fishing is good throughout the English River system. I prefer Press Lake (2cd lake upstream) to Indian (and the others in that area) but both are good fishing. I would say that Press is better than most. Search for Press Lake on the Canada, fishing reports, and general discussion boards for the last year for more info."
1233513,Bearfangary,2010-09-06 14:55:00,22,"Been fishing Indian for 30+ years. first 10 were at Gummesons. Loved it, but a north wind would shut you down and the trip to Indian got to be too much. Mameigwess is a good lake for lakers and big notherns, but we did all the walleye fishing in Indian.Started going to Agimac River Outfitters about 20 years ago and was always treated well, and usually had good fishing. It's gotten progressivly better since the slot limit put in place and the spawning grounds were made off limits until mid-June.Harold and Isobel sold out about 3 years back and the new owners, John & Daryl have really expanded the business with Ice-fishing and sled dog trips. I haven't done that yet, but would like to. - BFG"
