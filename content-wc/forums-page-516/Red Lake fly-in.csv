Rather than vertical jigging, lindy rigs with a bare hook or floating jig head proved to be the most successful in 22' to 28' feet. Boats and motors were very good this year. While we were disappointed the Fort Frances bait dealer stiffed us on leeches, ordered in advance, and I had to scramble to get crawlers from Vados after another online bait dealer cancelled my order three days before we left, bait was not an issue."
