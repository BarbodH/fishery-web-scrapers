1232811,biggamefisher,2010-09-03 07:04:00,540,"Water level high, flow is pretty strong on the Red, might make it a difficult end to the season, we have had alot of rain lately that is adding to the issue, we'll have to see how the fall goes. The strike ended at the mill alright.....closed down and is no more, going to be a tough go for the town of Pinefalls and surrounding area.Always welcome our American friends, regardless of the conditions, still a fabulous fishery to take advantage of, crossing our fingers on a fantastic fall."
1232816,REELMAN,2010-09-03 07:19:00,1624,"thanks for the info. sure am sorry to hear the mill closed down. i know what that feels like to loose your job. hope those guys can bounce back. we'll be there in a month and a week. can't wait to get into some of those green fish , and some good old canadian brew."

I have met many good people over the years ...too bad to hear about the shutdown. We will be making our annual trip during the first weekend of October to Pine Falls. I will be accompanied by 3 other boats. I have never heard much happening at this time in previous years but we have always done pretty well during this first weekend of October. Has anyone picked up any Greenbacks yet? How is the boat ramp near the mill? How about access at the park in Selkirk? I realize the water levels are high but historically the higher water levels have been a good thing. Thanks Hawgeye ps. Laurant Raymond, have you got any updates?"

The number of walleye was very surprising but the conditions are good. Water was 65deg with a real good flow. We caught at least 60 walleye in a couple of hours, it was fun....As the water gets cooler it should only get better. As for the state of the town, it has been hard on some families. Slowly they are finding work and moving on thank god for the gold mine just north of here. Its just a guess but I would say 80% of the mill employees have found work..Some of the guys were waiting to see how the buy out would go but that never happened and it (the mill) will be decommissioned in the near future. Looks like the fall run may be good, hope to see you all this fall."
