1231958,DanM57,2010-08-31 06:56:00,135,Our group of 6 always has a fishing contest. Everybody puts in $25. Prizes are awarded for the largest walleye for the day with the big payout being for the largest walleye of the week. There is also a prize for the largest northern of the week. We fish primarily walleyes. The little bit of cash is nice but the bragging rights are what get us through until next year. We are looking for ideas for next year. I am curious what others are doing? Thanks.

Then at the end of the week or when the last guy gets 5 cards the person with the best hand wins the pot. Size is determined the group and based on the lake. I think we got this game idea from a previous post."
1232190,SD Fisher,2010-08-31 21:21:00,90,"When we go ice fishing, we throw some money in the pot and pay out for the first walleye caught each day, the biggest walleye caught each day, and the biggest eelpout of the whole trip. Kinda interesting because if you catch the first walleye, you can't lose that $$$ and, of course, you got bragging rights for that money fish for the rest of the day. You also have a chance to catch the biggest fish each day, but that money fish is at risk until the last line is pulled in. Then you start all over again the next day. We pay out for the biggest eelpout because that poor fool is harassed relentlessly."
1232201,Moondog,2010-08-31 22:24:00,362,I realize that this idea is not original but we have had a contest in the past that you must use a Barbie Pole or Spiderman pole ( you get the idea) for 2 hours and the largest fish wins.......something. We all must fish together and it has been pretty darn funny. You can imagine the video.
1232204,Stu,2010-08-31 22:43:00,472,"We do the same things. But in the middle of the week, usually Wednesday, we have a perch tournament for half a day. Five bucks a head and the money goes to the boat w/ the most fish. We are all walleye fishermen, but it really breaks things up and has become the highlight of the week (yeah, we're lame, I know)."
1232297,REG,2010-09-01 09:30:00,445,"If you're more interested in bragging rights, we've done a travelling trophy/Stanley Cup sort of thing before. Have a nice little trophy made and big fish for the week gets to keep it and proudly display it until next year where it's up for grabs again."
1233111,MorganMan,2010-09-04 09:28:00,341,Great idea REG! We just returned last weekend and this year was a first in the big fish contest. We just use walleye length and all put in $20 at the beginning of the trip. We pay out the top 3 spots every year and this year one guy took all three spots.........ME baby! LOL.....talk about bragging rights! They couldn't wait to get out of the truck on the way home. I'm trying to get a course list put together with some night classes and webinars! They just don't seem to be picking up what I'm trying to teach them. Anyone have any ideas on how to deal with remedial students?? lolololololol!
