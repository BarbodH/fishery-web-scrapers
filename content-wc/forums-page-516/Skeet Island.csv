1232473,balsl6,2010-09-01 21:52:00,426,Deep water bay is about centrally located on the lake just about straight east of the NW angle or Angle inlet. Skeet Island is NE of Deepwater bay about 10 miles or so. Look up Sportsman's oak Island lodge on the web. Deepwater is about 3-5 miles east and Skeet is NE of that. Good Luck!
