For what it’s worth, I would aim to have an early dinner in the Soo and then head up to Wawa afterwards."

We really enjoyed the camp. Dave Lake is larger than I thought it was. Interesting lake with lots of areas to fish. Caution until you learn the lake as a lot of it is very shallow. Some areas soft flat bottom and rocky areas. Be careful along the shore lines as you can be going along in 8' of water the all of a sudden very shallow with rocks for a very short distance then 8' again. I've been going with Jenn and Martin since they bought their first camps 23 years ago. Excellent outfitter. Fishing...My initial thoughts are it's likely more a northern pike lake than walleye, but we caught both. It's difficult to say how good the fishing is/can be as we had a really bad cold front and the barometric pressure was so low for most of the week that the smoke from the wood burner went straight to the ground most of the time. As a result we had to fish hard. We had plenty of walleye to eat and caught a lot of small northern pike. No question, Orange was the best color."
6754661,Doack,2023-08-10,10,"Made it back, it did not disappoint, we caught over 600 Walleye for week, we had little issue with them, pike we caught about 150 id guess, mostly when walleye fishing, most were hammer handles, but landed 2 over 40"", and several in the mid thirties, they were thick healthy fish the bigger ones. The walleye early in week were larger for some reason, 18-24 was all day for first several days, rest of week most were 13-20, it was a little different, and the walleye moved a lot during week, very few times did we catch large groups in same spot as day before. All in all a great trip, tons of fish and pretty good weather the whole week, would definitely recommend."
