He passed me finally and blew by and was going at a good clip. Later on down by the S curve bridge on the south end of 502 there he was pulled over by the OPP. He will have a good fine.

6754263,Wallychowder,2023-08-06 15:22:00,1567,It didn't happen to have offset rims where the tires stick way out beyond the fender wells did it ?...........lol.
6754275,Skyraptor,2023-08-06 16:04:00,291,It might of had those tires. I know they had a rod case tied across their tonneau cover.
6754277,Skyraptor,2023-08-06 16:06:00,291,You are right. We almost took out a moose going up last week Friday. It crossed right in front of the truck and had to put the brakes on. About 3:30 in the morning.
6754285,Eckohlt,2023-08-06 17:03:00,3685,The moose probably telling his buddies that he almost took out a truck!

Moose are black and their eyes do not glow in headlights like a deer, hard to see until the last minute when driving at night, let alone on such a winding road."
