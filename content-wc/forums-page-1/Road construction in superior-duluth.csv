6753037,kettyspanky,2023-07-29 15:42:00,271,We went up last saturday the 22nd and came back today. In my opinion MNdot does not have the detour marked very well at all. I used my navigation in the truck and had no problems. I'm glad I had navigation to use. Good luck to everyone else on their travels this year.
6754617,Pooch,2023-08-09,4618,Any recent reports on the detour from Superior to route 53 in Duluth? Wife and I went north on 61 a month ago and it was poorly marked and we mostly had to figure it out ourselves. Pooch

6750949,kettyspanky,2023-07-19 04:13:00,271,What is the current road conditions in superior/duluth? Which bridge are they using? We are heading up 61 once we cross the bridge. Thanks for any help.
6750981,fishin779,2023-07-19 06:36:00,63,"I ran Hwy. 53 thru Superior/ Duluth on Sunday. It was not bad, in my opinion. Just be a bit patient, the detour was well marked and traffic moved at a good pace. It just takes a few extra minutes extra but in a 12 hour trip, I just use the detour as a little bit of a mind numbing relaxation!!"

6751117,tolson93,2023-07-19 18:27:00,48,"The blatnik and bong bridge are both open. I'd suggest staying away from downtown superior street into Garfield , leading to the blatnik.. road construction makes it pretty tight down there. I see lots of boats down in that area, must be launching underneath the blatnik bridge. I work in Duluth delivering diesel and gas and it definitely gets busy in that area.

I assume Google maps would pick it up and be correct once I started that way, but just to be safe if anybodyâ€™s willing to put detailed directions on here I would appreciate it. We are crossing at international Falls."
6751275,7 Mag,2023-07-20 14:48:00,1887,"I use google maps and it will have you follow the detour but you could take the Bong bridge and follow 2 to midway road, that will take you out to 53 and avoid the construction."
6751289,Jimmy Mac,2023-07-20 15:56:00,96,Try using this link....https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ri...a3oy?entry=ttu It is a Google Map of the Bong Bridge along with surrounding roads.. Jimmy Mac
6751293,Slimerocket,2023-07-20 16:01:00,34,"I would say to cross the Bong, take left [South] on to I-35. Go up the hill take Right exit onto US-2, continue to Midway Rd. [Co.13] Stop light go Right and stay on it untill you come to US-53 in Pike Lake. Now its a Left and put the pedal down .. Good Luck and have a safe trip."

6751577,LacSeul,2023-07-22 10:30:00,6,"Drove back yesterday from our trip, in Duluth I would just stick to Blatnick/53 cause construction wasn't a big deal at all. Almost no delay. Same thing in regards to our ride up. Followed Google map advice,"
