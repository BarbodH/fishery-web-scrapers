Had numerous 29.5 and 29.75 but 30 has always eluded me.Like said above you have to go to where those fish are. You also have to change the mindset to size VS numbers. Normally not going to find those fish where the big numbers are.Good luck."
6673810,Mojo-NC,2022-07-19 09:36:00,1929,"I've caught two 30"" walleyes to date, one from NWO and the other from Erie. On just about every occasion where we've caught larger fish than the norm, we've gone a bit deeper. I don't think the larger fish (>25"") hang out with the schools of the 15-23"" fish that you typically catch when you are racking up the numbers. Our larger fish have always been a bit isolated from the schools. When I caught my first 30"" walleye, we were catching smaller fish on a point. I suggested that we move out deeper and bam. Last fall, we fished a bottle neck location that was the deepest water in the area. We caught the largest walleye of the trip (25.5"") along with a 35"" and 40"" northern, all from that same location and within in about 1 hour. Big fish hang out with other big fish. I can't think of a single example of catching a big fish amongst of a bunch of smaller fish when we were locked in on numbers."
6673840,stevensinks,2022-07-19 10:17:00,330,Three summers ago my wife got one in Red Lake that measured was just over 32. Two weeks later the lodge that is very close to were she got her fish posted that one of there guest got a 32. I have always wondered if it was the same fish. Thats the only time I have touched a walleye that large and I have been fishing for them for over 40 years.
6673848,Mojo-NC,2022-07-19 10:31:00,1929,"Let me ask a question that is slightly off topic but related to this post. How many of y'all keep fish over 24"" to either bring home or eat? We have a rule in my group that no one keeps anything over 24"" (unless it is to be mounted). I'm even thinking we should go a little smaller, say 22"". We've caught a couple of 30"" fish in NWO in my group. I released mine, but the other guy kept his to be mounted. I personally would have gone with a replica mount. If everyone keeps larger fish, there are fewer fish that have an opportunity to grow to 30"". Just my 2 cents."

In 2000 I fished a sunken island with a 3/8 oz jig with a half a minnow on it for two hours, caught one fish that night a 31.5 inch monster. I have fished that spot dozens of times since and have caught a half dozen 27-28 inchers but have never caught another 30 incher."
6673880,Old Timer,2022-07-19 11:45:00,255,"Back in the late 70's and 80's I was consumed with catching 30 inch fish. This was long before the Internet and semi-reliable intel. I canoed in, flew in and trained in to many remote Canadian locations with no luck. Then a friend saw some Polaroid pics that a customer had from what was then a relatively unknown lake. One thing lead to another and I stated fishing there. It took a few years to crack the code but we'd catch 28 to 31 inch fish every day and sometimes a couple 30's the same day. It was stealth fishing late into the night using big chubs and slip sinkers. It's been years since I've fished there and I wonder if the big ones still exist. It's not an unknown lake anymore and is mentioned on this forum from time to time. And by the way, we never killed a fish from that lake except a few eaters for lunch. This was long before restrictive regulations. I mostly go on drive-in trips anymore. I often target LOTW and have a hunch I'll catch a good one on a remote big-water hump. Just before Covid I caught a 29.5, but that's not a 30."
6673892,valley366,2022-07-19 12:54:00,193,"The last 3 camps I have visited in Ontario have had a policy that NO fish come back to camp over 18"". I follow that policy most places I fish including MN. Sometimes may stretch is slightly on MN waters depending on how many catching. I prefer a fillet from a 16-17"" fish.One lodge I went to with that policy had a group that were not following it. Owner told them if he finds one more in the cleaning shack they would be packing out. Did not see another over the rest of the week so he must have got his point across."
6673894,orchard frank,2022-07-19 13:09:00,1900,"From 1992-2004, spent 2-3 weeks/season on Lac Seul,, never caught a true, measured 30"". Caught tons of fish, lots of 27's, bunch of 28's, some 29's, 29 1/2 a few. Wife had one boatside that sure looked over 30, who knows, came undone. Fished BaydeNoc area from 97-2015, lived there 14 of those years. Lots of true 30's, 32 1/2 tops. Wife and I caught 3 over 30 right in front of the Gladstone Launch, fishing for splake, before the walleye season opened. I don't think I had any over 30 the last few years I lived there. Fall runs kind of fell off some, big fish were being caught (and kept) by the 100's at Oconto, and elsewhere. Forage changed, alewives diminished, or the fish got smarter. (or I got dumber). And of course, netting got worse in the pre season, and even under the ice. A 30+ is a pretty rare resource, anywhere."

6673698,Pink Unicorn,2022-07-18 21:49:00,83,"Hey everyone, I have been fishing NWO for 28 years but only fishing seriously for about 12 of those years. It turns out Dad's approach of trolling twisters in Aug in 12' FOW isn't the most productive and it wasn't until I had a guide that I learned about vertical jigging/boat control/reading the bottom. I can get 100 fish days serval times a week and usually fish between the hours of 10:30 am-6pm. I never have a problem getting 20""-25"" walleyes, and I did catch a 28.75"" a couple of years back, but I would love advice on getting a 30"". I usually use 3/8oz jigs with 5"" twisters (white, black, smoke), sometimes tipped with a frozen minnow. I will be at Roderick Lake Aug 12-19. I have around 15 spots marked on the lake (Ladder, South Reef, various islands, Indian Bay, etc). Likely fishing 20-30' FOW. I will be at Marvin Lake Aug 20-27. From my experience, Marvin is decent but the East Lake portage has more big fish potential. I don't know of any mid lake structure in Maple Lake that might hold big fish. Does anyone have any advice on helping me finally get that 30"" in the net?"
6673700,Lmbkiller,2022-07-18 22:31:00,639,"I have touched over 100000 walleyes in my life thru fishing and work. Never seen a 30in. 29.8 is not 30. That is something u will have to cipher thru when others start posting. Your best bet for a fish like that is goin to the only handful of places in North America have them. I would start on Erie. I've touched 12lb walleyes and they weren't 30in, in the month of august. I've handled around 20 that were over 28in, out of over 100000. Good luck on your quest"
6673704,Pooch,2022-07-19 00:31:00,4618,"I don't believe there are a lot of lakes that routinely produce a TRUE 30"" fish in Ontario. Lac Seul, Lake of the Woods, Eagle and a few others probably. Years ago many lakes had thirties, but fishing pressure has thinned the herd. Good friend of mine has a thirty hanging on his wall that came from Dogtooth fifty years ago. Next month will be my 71st trip to Ontario and I've caught a lot of 27-28"" fish, but never a TRUE 30"". Closest was a 29.75"" over on Savant years ago. I've given up the quest for that elusive 30"" fish. Should I ever stumble upon one it has to be actual 30"" in the measuring trough and not an ""eyeball"" 30"" before I claim it as a thirty. When someone claims a thirty, I acknowledge them, but before I drink their Cool Aid, I want to see it in the measuring trough. A 30"" fish is rare in most of Ontario waters. Odds are they are there, but they are usually old and skinny and die of old age. ""Larger baits larger fish"" is not always true, but a good place to start. If I were on a quest for an TRUE 30"" fish, I would focus on big fish producing waters like the Columbia, Erie, Little Bay De Noc, Missouri, Lake Ontario, etc.. Good luck, but don't make yourself crazy over it. If I'm catching bunches of smaller fish, I move as I'd rather catch few, but better fish. Any large fish I've ever caught was a loner and not in a ""bunch of fish"". Big fish don't get big by eating anything that swims by. Big fish are wary and do not have to compete with little fish for forage. The little fish are ""the forage"" for big fish. Someone once told me that if a lake does not have jumbo perch it does not have large healthy walleye. It's all about genetics and forage base. Just like farming, you gotta have good soils (good lake), good fertility (the right forage base) and good hybrids (good genetics) for good crops and fishing. Pooch"

6673752,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-19 07:09:00,8293,"If you want big fish you have to go where big fish live. Then you have to hunt for big fish. It's a different game than a numbers game. IMO the biggest fish are in lakes you can't drive to. The exception might be Erie & healthy river systems like the Mississippi & St. Croix. I don't know if the Missouri can kick out a 30""+ Walleye or not."

Any walleye 28"" ,or over gets a Master Angler Award. Last trip, before gas prices went crazy high, 2008, or so, 5 of the 8 of us got the award, my second. No walleye 22"" or over may be kept, which can explain the relative abundance of larger fish. The lake is a sort of drive-to, having to motor up the river a mile or so to get to it. You have to go where they are,. there are reasons for where they are, etc. Bill"
6673798,prov1800,2022-07-19 09:15:00,5010,"A lot of the really good lakes that produced big walleyes are gone.To many people haven kept those big fish for taxidermy wise and then some made it into a frying pan.As a example when I guided a lot for North Star Lodge on Clay Lake and there other camp at Big Canon Lake Lodge we would portage into Sequise Lake (Golden) as it was also called and on most days when we went tgere we would always catch one or more 30"" walleyes.It was a amazing lake and it had rules.Then the loggers came in from the Deer Lake Rd and oretty much cut down to the lake which now gave people a opportunity to get into it and fish it.I myself went there some times with my family.Always someoñe there and saw 28-30"" fish carcasses that had been cleaned at launch.Needles to say that fishery went down fast.I had many lakes to go to like that on my own trails we cut and were good for many years but when they cut those areas that was it for the good fishing and any big fish were kept.Gov should just put a limit of 4 fish under 18"" and leave it like that.But all damage is done.Ive seen people bring in huge walleyes into cleaning shacks.Disgusting site to me."
