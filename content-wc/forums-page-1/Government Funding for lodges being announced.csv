The owners are surviving, but they have had to put off completing several major updates like improving their water and electric systems and expanding the septic field. Although us Yanks are returning the fall season at this resort is less than 50% of what it usually is. The owner told me that he could use some assistance to keep up with his loans and support his family until the 2022 season starts. He told me it might take 5 years of revenue for him to balance his books after losing the 2020 and most of 2021 seasons."

I could name 4-5 lodges off the top of my head that combined have lost more than $10 million alone. Also this program is not just for lodges. Its for a whole swath of businesses, some very large ones. We may be the last dogs at the trough......-FT"

They wasted a lot of money early."
6601030,Windermere,2021-10-03 08:11:00,23,"Eligibility  be a for-profit business, legally incorporated (federally or provincially) as of January 1, 2018 (this is the first listed requirement) If we read the eligibility for this funding, the very first requirement will make the majority of the outfitters ineligible for any of this funding? Are we reading and understanding this program correctly?  Hopefully, it is my misunderstanding/interpretation. I believe most camps are not incorporated and this requirement alone will not help a large portion of tourist camps. In addition, it states it is a competitive application for funding. This may mean outfitters that are incorporated are going to have to be very creative in their application and compete to be selected. Only from my understanding? This is a GOOD small step and this will be very helpful for those that will be able to secure funding with this program. On a sad note 100 million is great , but may need more to help most. I think most readers should know (if my understanding is correct), that a majority of small owners will not be receiving funding thru this program. The way I read it is that a majority of camp owners will not be able to secure funding thru this program ( as of Oct. 2021) if they are not incorporated, but maybe and hopefully there will be another program that will come from these points of eligibility made that the small outfitters can apply for and receive next time!"

You must be incorporated. NOTO is working on this as I type this. Most of the larger camps/operators are incorporated. But smaller ones/mom and pop are likely not. This is another example where the government hasn't either thought this through or two, doesn't or has ever cared about fishing/hunting lodges. I tend to think the latter. But, I'm jaded...... -FT"

Even if you are an incorporated small company... they're making it nearly impossible to get approved. You have to have a CFO signoff on receipts proving losses. There's going to be a ton of hoops to jump through... I'm pretty disappointed."
