These do not necessarily have to be of fish, they can be a scene on the lake. If you have 1 or 2 you would not mind sharing, please post them on this thread, or message me with them. Thanks for the help."

6754125,Skywagon,2023-08-05 14:49:00,1106,"Sad isn't it? Pooch, if it helps I just got back from the cabin doing manly things, like staining the sauna building. The Facebook post has to do with the high-level nuclear waste dump they want to put in our area. Lake of the Woods is in the watershed downstream from where they want to bury the nuclear waste. For those brave enough to be on Facebook, here is the page that will have the post- https://www.facebook.com/NoNuclearWasteInNWO"
