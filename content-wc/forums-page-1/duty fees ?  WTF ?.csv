6600398,Net_Man,2021-09-30 15:12:00,578,For how many times that I crossed the border in the past you would think that I would have a better grasp on alcohol purchased at the duty free shop. My one experience in purchasing beer at a duty free shop in Int'l Falls we purchased several cases over our allotment to bring in to Ontario Canada. When crossing we claimed the beer purchased at the duty free shop but we were charged duty by Ontario on everything over 1 case per person. The beer purchased at the duty free shop in Int'l Falls was not any cheaper than I could by locally (MN metro area) at the time. Based on this experience I did not see any benefit purchasing at the duty free shop. Was this handled correctly at the border? And if yes then are other people finding the prices to be cheaper at the duty free shop?
6600416,Slim03,2021-09-30 17:08:00,159,We crossed with 6 liters for 2 people and got told have a nice trip. Other truck was also over but not as much and got told the same.

And if yes then are other people finding the prices to be cheaper at the duty free shop?When you purchase at the Duty Free shop on the US side you pick it up just before you cross the border. The duty free means it does not have US tax on it. That is why you pick it up close to the crossing so you cannot turn around and drink it in the US tax free. When you cross the border you will still be responsible for the Canadian duty if you are over the limit. Some times the border agent will not charge you for the overage and that is purely dependent on them and not where you bought the booze/beer.

Guess that was satisfactory for Him Is this your first time across? To me it sounds like they were quite helpful. 1. Just buy the overage in Canada next time. Saving a couple bucks is all you're doing. 2. I know the ArriveCAN app can be a little confusing(The site through a computer was a little different than the mobile app) but please fill this out ahead of time. 3. Be ready with all the docs at the boarder. All these items just slow down the lines for other people behind you. Also it's a fair question to ask why the CO guy. My experience is they always ask one question just to see if you stumble. We crossed on the 10th. There were about 6 cars in each lane in front of us...3 booths open. We took the shortest line. It took us 40min to get through while the other lines looked like 15-20 min. Due to one vehicle in front of us was pulled over and looked like they had excessive amounts of alcohol. Another vehicle looks like they didn't have their documents ready to pass. Our conversation was about 2-3min when we got up. Handed our vaccine docs & test results, quickly declared our booze/cigars, where we were going. Agent was very friendly as they usually have been. Sounds like the trip was as much about socializing as fishing which is good to see!"

6598504,Obabikon,2021-09-21 07:45:00,2368,"Well... that is quite a bit over the 1L per person limit. (2.75 litres and 8 cases of beer over) Typically, you want to declare booze and pay duty on beer. Depending how you worded what you were doing, they may have made you pay on the liquor. Either way, booze is not poorly priced in Canada right now.
