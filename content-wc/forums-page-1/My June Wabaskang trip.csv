I am happy to say 503 and 105 was open and in good shape, as good as I have seen in 30 years. We went across the border at 4o AM no one except us, went right through after showing the officer our documents. Fishing in the lake was quite different than any of my previous 32 trips to this lake. I have always fished weed edges in 8 to 12 ft. of water (the 5th week of the season). Because of the high water and cooler water temps. there was no weeds to be seen and the shore lines were in back a ways. When we did find them they was shallow in 4 to 6 ft. of water. The water temperature was 65 to 70 degrees even in the shallower water. The air temperature reached about 90 degrees so the water was warming fast in the shallow areas. We didn't catch as many numbers as 2019 but they was definately bigger as we most were over the 18"" keeper size. I would guess they will be moving deeper soon. The camp I go was had a tough spring with high water in their lake side buildings and stationary docks. Most of the boat docks are floating so the part was ok. I sure had a good time but it was like a strange lake even after 32 trips to it. At 85 years I had a good time and look forward to a few more. (if he is willing) Have a good one Billy Weaver f"

6667756,billy weaver,2022-06-25 16:46:00,470,"In 30 years I am not sure what normal is. If it would drop another foot I would say it would be in the normal high range and not be a problem. It dropped about 3 inches the week we were there. I would guess that for fishiermen it will be in the normal high range (in July) and not a problem anywhere except for a lot of clean up for the camp owners, its been tough for some of them. You will probably see a big difference in the weed beds after starting the year in such deep water. I will bet that if you have not fished Canada since 2019 you will notice the increase in average size. Have a good one, Billy"

Two years of very little fishing has certainly helped the fishery. Thanks for the info.. Last August was extremely low with less than a foot of water @ Toms dock so this will definitely be different. We had to raise the boat motor and use the trolling motor at the narrows last year. What a difference a year make, aye! Later, Jay"
6754369,kettyspanky,2023-08-07 11:21:00,271,Any reports for this year on Wabaskang? I'm thinking about booking for next year but would like to hear some reports from this year.
