I am looking to take my three teen boys to Canada next summer and was hoping I could rely on the experience of all of you recommending a good fishing lake at a fly-in for $950 or less. I had inquired about going to Melchett, but it is booked during the time we are going. We have been to Abamassagi. Just curious what other options and lakes you would recommend? Thanks for your time."

6754717,proguidedream,2023-08-10,345,"i would be suprised if you find something cheaper than this. https://jacksonslodge.com/rates/ an 8 person plane out of Lac Du Bonnet , that holds 8 people costs around 2K total for one way trip. thats 4K for a round trip just for the plane. maybe you can ask to fly in a smaller plane and save some money, but then your gear is a lot less. This place below , is a 100% canadian adventure and closest you will get to a fly-in trip without the actual flying and cost of that part. send me a pm if you would like more info. and garaunteed to catch 100s of fish. http://crowducklakecamp.ca/price/"
