6754527,Old Timer,2023-08-08 17:39:00,255,I'm with Rich. Years ago I was the cook and tour guide. The group fell apart when I said no more and nobody else would pick up the slack. Now it's one other person when DIY. If a larger group it's American Plan. You stay home if you can't afford the freight.
6754555,kona77,2023-08-09,236,Thanks for another great trip report. Nicely done. Looks like the group had a great time. Give you credit for feeding/cooking for a group that large. Bacon wrapped walleye's and fish taco's are now two of our staples for meals on our trips. Have a great trip with your son in Nth. Sask..
6754407,Mike Borger,2023-08-07 19:54:00,1554,"Hey guys! Last month I visited North Caribou Camps, a place I've been to many times before, but this trip was a little different. It was a large group of a dozen people who joined me on a hosted trip. It's something I started to do prior to covid, and will likely do again. My role is simply to educate, instruct, offer tips and guidance, and cater to the group as well. I did all of the food shopping and most of the cooking. It was a ton of work, but also a ton of fun and I think everyone had a great time. Weather was horrible sadly. The entire previous 11/2 months it was a heat wave with fires burning everywhere and a fire ban in place. Was expecting t shirts, shorts, flip flops and sunblock, but it didn't happen. A crazy cold front hit and water temps went from 74 to 58!! Needless to say it made things a lot tougher for the big pike, but we still got a bunch. Weather in general was tough. Thunderstorms, heavy rain, strong winds and very cool temps for most of the trip, but we persevered. When it comes to walleye there are never any excuses on this lake and we caught tons. No major complaints other than bad weather, as I said the whole gang made the best of it!! If you'd care to read the full story on the trip you can see it here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/s...e-hosted-trip/ I also have a lengthy video documenting the trip as well:https://youtu.be/HyqNTeitFDw Hope you're all having a great summer! My son and I are currently packing for an extended trip to northern Saskatchewan, leaving on Wednesday this week. All is good, I'm very blessed. Cheers!"

6754423,Eckohlt,2023-08-08 05:13:00,3685,"hope we get alittle snow next week when I'm up,I need cold weather."
6754425,kim n indiana,2023-08-08 05:39:00,62,"Kinda what I just did last week on spanish river. But we had great weather. Like you said, its alot of work, but they helped with cooking/cleanup, so it made it easier. Lots of memories made as none of the other 3 had ever been on this type of trip."
6754429,RichA$1970,2023-08-08 06:43:00,1158,"Can’t make the weather & it’s a crapshoot, but pretty country although their rates of around $2,800 including tax is around double what I’d want to spend. The older I get the simpler it is going with just 1 other person or solo. Nothing worse than coming back from fishing and people in the cabin staring at you asking what’s for dinner. Unless they paid my way, there wouldn’t be a Top Chef meal every night."
6754437,Eckohlt,2023-08-08 07:10:00,3685,"That's a boat load of cash for one week,4 people max for me and on down to a solo trip,perfect for me.If you went with the max people of what the outpost holds,it's bumper cars with people all week."
6754447,Walleye2242,2023-08-08 07:49:00,263,Heading to Gullrock on friday. next week looks like a mix of rain and clouds. I will take the clouds not a fan of the rain.
6754449,Eckohlt,2023-08-08 07:59:00,3685,"I'll be up next week also,things will change from now until next week,rain chances should dwindle,great set of rain great is always a game changer."
