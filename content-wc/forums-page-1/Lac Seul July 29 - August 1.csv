We always planned on going back and boy are we glad we did!!!First time we were able to meet Scott & Heidi. They purchased the resort in late 2019-early 2020. We won't about the thing that was COVID. Thankful for all the resort owners who were able to hang onto their resorts during this time!!!Fishing was absolutely awesome. In our group, 5 personal bests were caught with a 27.5 & 27"" Walleye taking top honors. Also, a 41"" Northern was caught too!!Fishing was so good & because 3 of the 4 boat owners had other engagements back home, and they were talking 60% chance of rain Wednesday, out entire group left Tuesday afternoon. Already making plan on going back to LSWR in 2024!!Edit question: Why/how did my pictures rotate & how do I fix them?!?"

6754641,Skis,2023-08-09,1523,"Fished 15-25' of water. I had spinner/minnow & Jason had spinner/crawler on the entire time. I probably caught a few more fish than Jason, but it was close!! Other boats were primarily using spinner/minnows, with some actually just using a plain hook with a BB. One individual did some rip jigging & some other types of aggressive jigging, but I don't think he caught as many from my observations. Color of spinner didn't seem to matter because we had to switch colors from time to time, losing some rigs to the rock gods"
