One have better all around species fishing. Going either late August or 1st week of September? One have less boat traffic. Trying to decide between those 2 areas. Obabikon vs Duck Lake? Advantages vs Disadvantages. Any info much appreciated. Cheers"

6754685,DeBo,2023-08-10,211,They are 7 miles apart as the crow flies. Found Muskies near both. Can’t speak to other species. You can easily fish the same water from both. There are more islands near Duck bay. I think Obabikon is closer to more good water but I don’t particularly care for the immediate region.
