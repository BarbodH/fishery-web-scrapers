6754155,vteye3,2023-08-05 19:03:00,496,"I realize any given camp might be used 8, 10 or more weeks per year and some groups will be clean and others - not. Keeping a clean camp is about burning the trash over the course of the week, NOT throwing out oil from fish fries into the woods, disposing of fish remains properly. Doing ones part to keep the camp clean is best way to avoid curious bears. I've never had a problem with bears and do an unguided float trip in AK every 3 years. We've had brown bears walk by camp at least half dozen times. No food, waders, rain coats (sprayed with fish fluids) in my tent please. We eat our evening meal, clean cooking gear, clean the boats, clean waders, coats and then travel another mile or so before setting up camp."
6754247,MikeinMN,2023-08-06 12:35:00,190,"Unfortunately, we have no control over the parties that use a cabin prior to our arrival. Keeping a clean camp all but eliminates bear problems, but once a black bear is habituated by finding food in camp, he is no longer a big raccoon. I believe after a bear is fed, he will continue to try to find food in camp and becomes a danger to people and property, and the only solution is to kill the bear. Sucks for the bear and the folks at the camp after a messy or careless group."
6754315,Hewhocookstomuch,2023-08-07 06:12:00,66,"A couple of the guys in our group wanted to burn paper plates and food scrapes. I told them don't be ridiculous .Bears can still smell the burned scrapes and come into camp. One of these guys is hunter and laughed at me. Beside there was a burn ban in NW Ontario. I asked the outfitter about my thoughts of burning food scrapes and he agreed with, saying even if there nothing but ash the bear would still dig through the ashes. We are lucky to have a bear proof building to store our trash and carry it out with us. That's the safest."
6754537,fishron,2023-08-08 19:16:00,317,"Other than Pennsylvania, Alaska and Yellowstone the only close encounters I've had with bears were on the Cabonga reservoir in Quebec. The area is hunted year round by the native tribe and when we saw a bear it was running for it's life. One time coming through a narrow inlet between two parts of the reservoir, (Cabonga is made up of hundreds of lakes connected by building a dam) We encountered a tiny cub swimming slowly across the inlet, only a short distance. Mama bear was no doubt in the thick bush and we never saw her. It would have been easy to scruff the little guy but common sense told us that we probably would see a lot more of mama bear that we wanted to if we had done that. It was a moment to remember."
6754609,lenray,2023-08-09,467,have seen a few bears near camps..................
6754635,fishron,2023-08-09,317,"I remember an occasion well before my encounter in Quebec. My brother and I took our scout troop on a week long canoe trip through Algonquin provincial park many years ago. We saw a bear who quickly disappeared as we approached one of our campsites. The rest of the week we used the many islands in the lakes we passed through. On our last night before heading home we used a group campsite within the park. After the troop had eaten dinner we were visited by one of the parks rangers who cautioned us to be very careful with our food or leftovers because bears had been a problem around the area. My brother and I bagged up what we could and walked it to a dump area several hundred yards from our campsite. It was pitch black and we were loading our bags into trash cans when a ranger pulled up in his vehicle. He gets out with a flashlight, shines it into the dump, pulls out a 357 or a 44 and lets loose into the dark. My brother and I were stunned. The ranger walks over to the bear that we had no idea was around, shines his light on the bear, jumps back and pumps another round into the bear. We left in the morning without any further adventure."
6753685,Filthy oar,2023-08-02 19:19:00,8,You only have to out run one of the other guys in camp
6753687,Eckohlt,2023-08-02 19:23:00,3685,"You know the old saying,No one left behind unless a bear is chasing you!"
6753719,kswalleyer,2023-08-02 21:25:00,1651,meh in my experience most black bears are just big racoons ...now when I fished Kodiak Island with those Brown bears around.......that was uncomfortable at times.
6753733,Eckohlt,2023-08-03 03:43:00,3685,I'm pretty sure big racoons bite.
6753737,Filthy oar,2023-08-03 03:53:00,8,"Reminds me of a story, in 1980 my grandpa took me to ontario for my first fishing trip when i was 14, we fished vista lake north of ignace, headed up there in pickup campers towing boats. **** of a trip for a farm kid who'd only caught brook trout, bluegill's and bullheads. Anyway, since i was the kid, i had to sleep on the floor in the back on a piece of mouse urine soaked foam next to the propane fridge,, at least the propane fumes cancelled out the mouse piss, on the second or third night, we heard something trying to get into the coolers under the back of the truck , my grandpa armed with an empty blatz bottle and half tanked up opens the door and i was literally nose to nose with my first black bear, he thumps the bear on the head with the beer bottle,slams the door and said,, just keep the door closed and you'll be fine. And stumbled back to bed. Ah, the good ol days."
6753755,Obabikon,2023-08-03 07:18:00,2370,"With the incredibly dry June, they're trying to find food. Blue berries were very scarce this year. First time in my life we have ever had a bear on our island. She grabbed my dog's dog food (50 pound bag), turned over a few trash cans, and left."
6753839,Old Timer,2023-08-03 16:03:00,255,"More on the camp axe. This bear wouldn't leave. He/she huffed around and made bluff moves towards us. There was nothing we could do to scare it away. You can be sure we banged together every pot and pan we had, all to no avail. The axe was the best we could muster."
6753843,Eckohlt,2023-08-03 16:56:00,3685,"Old timer,do you suppose that bear was deaf?"
6753845,Tristian5431,2023-08-03 16:58:00,37,Hilarious!!!!!! LOL
6753847,Walleye2242,2023-08-03 17:04:00,263,this is now my favorite story.
6753539,Joek3,2023-08-01 18:34:00,244,Have been to Canada 15x ish. 3 run ins with Bears coming up to our cabin. 2 times we scared them away no issue. 3rd time the bear would not leave and appeared lethargic. Hung around camp just lying down within 30-40 yds. Would not move. Outfitter came out and disposed of it. Has anyone ever had an issue where they felt seriously in danger with a bear encounter? We have been lucky.
6753571,pjshorthorn,2023-08-02 02:44:00,5654,"Seriously threatened ..nope. When going into remote camps, Bear bangers help scare them off. PjShorthorn"
6753577,Larry S,2023-08-02 04:58:00,665,Question PJ Where do you get Bear Bangers!! Larry S
6753583,Eckohlt,2023-08-02 06:21:00,3685,"Years ago cherry bomb or m-80 did the trick,one blast and you won't see the bear again,I don't bring them anymore."
6753587,deputy dog,2023-08-02 06:49:00,305,had one come into our camp twice in about 30 mins.....took 2 pots and made a helluva racket and never saw him again
6753591,proguidedream,2023-08-02 07:15:00,345,"FYI bear spray is not allowed on float planes for anyone reading this thread and think they will bring some to protect from bears. black bear country is generally fine, dont leave garbage around and take your fish scraps somewhere else. i wouldnt go west into brown bear country without spray however."
6753597,Bill Krejca,2023-08-02 07:54:00,6107,"Have seen my share, never felt threatened, have a few stories. Once in Saskatchewan was sorta forced to walk within 30? feet of one which wouldn't move away from the trail, probably not a smart situation, still think back on it. Bill"
6753647,Old Timer,2023-08-02 13:35:00,255,"I've had my share of run-ins with black bears. The worst were on canoe trips in the Quetico and BWCA. On one trip with my dad we had a bear wreck the entire camp. The bruin tore up the tent and sleeping bags. And, of course, all the foodstuffs that we hadn't hoist into a tree. I cleaned up the camp and dumped the gear into the canoe while my dad kept the bear at bay with the camp axe. We pulled out right at dusk and canoed down to the next lake and slept under a tree. After that I always brought a revolver or collapsible rifle until the authorities outlawed firearms. I'm reaching back sixty years. Side story. Maybe thirty years ago I was at a Canadian outpost. I had a .22 rifle with. A native girl came up to the cabin and asked if we had a firearm. Turns out her family was on a ricing trip and the others were circling a moose they found swimming across the lake. So off we went and the girl had the gun. She plugged the critter about ten times in the head and they dragged it to shore where they cleaned it up. They were very appreciative and gave us about ten pounds of unfinished rice. By the way, I kinda like the M80 and cherry bomb remedy for bears. There were a few trips where I woulda tried them."
6753679,Joek3,2023-08-02 17:55:00,244,Kept the bear at bay with a camp axe ..I love that!!!!
6753683,Eckohlt,2023-08-02 18:03:00,3685,"The camp axe's I've ever seen in Ont are so dull,your not going to stick it in any bear,so you better have tennis shoes on to run like hel after you swing that dull axe at him!lol"
