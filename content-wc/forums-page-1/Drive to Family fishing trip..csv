6753013,SweetD,2023-07-29 13:14:00,243,"I would avoid LOTW for a family trip. Pick a manageable water that you can get on in almost any weather. That lake on the Canadian side might be OK but on the US side huge water with 6’ rollers alot of days. Just doesn’t scream Canadian solitude and yea, I have been there m(during Covid). I wouldn’t go back. There are so many options that are more remote, beautiful and scream true Canadian shield fishing. Just one guy’s opinion of course.Good luck"
6753023,troutwater,2023-07-29 14:21:00,299,"If you don't care about fishing ""pretty"" water Wabigoon may be an option too. The pike fishing is really good with sheer numbers along with walleye. I think the biggest walleye I've caught is like 18"" there, but I've caught a lot of them. Muskie numbers are really good too"
6753039,RichA$1970,2023-07-29 15:57:00,1158,"I’d hit Prov1800 up as he fishes and guides on Eagle, Cedar, LS, Indian probably a lot more. I’d pass on Eagle, LS and LOTW with family as those are big lakes and I struggle at least as I want to keep exploring and probably pass over a lot of spots. I’d look for narrow, not too deep lakes with bays and islands."
6753047,prov1800,2023-07-29 16:59:00,5010,"Thx Rich.Not sure how old kids are but would suggest Kc Landing on the Indian Lake Chain.The camp is real nice with great cabins with a 1000 ft sand beach with water toys and a water trampoline.Smaller lake and fairly easy to fish in windy conditions.Walleye,pike,muskie smallmouth and lake trout,18 ft Kodiak crestliners with a 50 Yamaha and all the bait you will ever need.Sweet place.www.clarksresorts.com"
6754007,proguidedream,2023-08-04 13:21:00,345,"My pick for a kids trip would be Crowduck Lake Camp, in Whiteshell Manitoba. you drive to a parking area(campground with a small store) and they boat you across big whiteshell lake. from there you take SxS ATV or Safari truck down a short trail to their cabins. its Jig and Minnow fishing and you can catch 100s of walleyes. or cast for bass and pike. they can do shore lunches or fish dinners, but you pack your own cooler with food to BBQ or whatever you want to eat. you would probably only need a guide for 1-2 days. depending on age of kids and ability to fish they may even be able to operate their own boat there. there is some great swimming there , and plenty of grass if the kids want to play yard games or hangout by a beach. the service is top notch out of any place i have been , once your feet hit the dock you dont have to carry any of your own gear unless you want to. you can also do a day trip there if you are driving by on your way somewhere further into ontario."
6754377,Steve Comerford,2023-08-07 13:18:00,28,I've never been to Wabigoon. I didn't know the walleyes on Wabigoon were so small. The lake seemed to have a good reputation.
6754393,Baseline,2023-08-07 17:50:00,3207,"If you are looking at family trip with nice accommodations with on-site owners and staff who will take good care of you and have access to guides.......my two picks would be on Lake of the Woods. Young's in Nestor Falls. Located about 80 miles north of the US border of Baudette or I-Falls. It is drive to and located on Stevens Bay. It has all species of fish you named. Plenty of area to fish and can be accessed on all but the worst weather days. Obabakon - Located out of Morson Ontario about 50 miles from the border crossing at Baudett. You will boat in to a full service resort and they will guide you out if necessary. Good fishing on Obabakan and Miles Bay and all species of fish you named are present. As a matter of fact both these resorts are known for their crappie fishing. Canadian Lake of the Woods is nothing like the US side. The US side is a big bowl that is about 35 miles across and averages 30/35 FOW and sits on the mid-western prairie and has no islands except in the far northeastern corner. The winds can kick it up and by the time the waves roll into the US coast they are big. I never fish the US side during open water season.The Canadian side is more like any shield lake you will find on most Canadian Lakes with lots of islands, hard rock and sandy shorelines with big shallow weedy bays. There is some big water that can get kicked up if a storm rolls in. August is about the most stable weather month there is with nice warm temperatures. The walleyes are firmly planted on the mid-lake reefs and large points. You can also find walleyes along the weed lines bordering the large shallow bays. Pike can be anywhere. You will find perch with the walleyes on deeper reefs. You will have the ask your guide where the crappies are. There are musky too."
6754405,Limeyangler,2023-08-07 19:51:00,563,"I just got in 20 minutes ago from the Goon, lost count of slot size fish(18-23) and at least 10 over slot today, biggest was 25. No shortage of nice fish on Wabigoon on a good day. Yesterday was even better, caught close to 100 walleye, I was out from 8am to 6pm, lost a 30 and next cast got a 26 .https://youtu.be/x98ShLxM9hQ"
6754413,46Harley,2023-08-07 22:51:00,149,www.YoungsWildernessCamp.com Has everything you are looking for. I have been there in late August for the past 10 years or more. Going back on the 25th.....can't wait.
6754535,troutwater,2023-08-08 18:58:00,299,"I've mainly fished muskies on Wabigoon, so I'm a very novice walleye fisherman. There are good ones in there, just have ti weed through the dinkers at times. Limey is a way better resource than I am though for walleye fishing. I've also never fished the big part of the lake as all 3 times I've stayed at Huber's."
6752283,Matcaz,2023-07-26 07:41:00,22,"I've received a lot of recommendations, thank you all. It is great that there are so many options that others feel would fit our family, but also makes it hard to choose one. In an attempt to narrow things down a bit, if there were one water body that you feel is the best fit which would it be? Lac Seul Eagle Lake Cedar Lake LOW Thanks again!"
6752295,Spurgery,2023-07-26 08:21:00,79,"Eagle, Cedar, and LOW are better in terms of multi-species, however Lac Suel is arguably one of the best walleye lakes in the world with plenty of pike as well."
6752307,emma17,2023-07-26 09:18:00,436,"Tough call. I've not been to Cedar. I've taken my family to the other three. I'm bringing six family members up to Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle this September for our third consecutive year, which indicates my vote."
6752475,AMPHIB206,2023-07-26 19:43:00,191,Lake of the Woods for scenery and wildlife. Youngs wilderness camp is very clean. Perfect for a family.
6752489,NM_Trout,2023-07-26 20:28:00,1094,"I've been following this pretty closely.... I am trying to narrow between Lac Seul and Eagle for September '24. Timberlane or Evergreen for Lac Seul. Silver Water wheel looks very nice, but is too pricey for me. On Eagle, Northshore / Eagle Lake island is likewise too pricey..If I am going to spend $1500+ per person, we are headed to a fly in. Birchdale or possibly Cedar point or Vermillion Bay for Eagle lake. Hmmmm....."
6752493,lunker99,2023-07-26 21:30:00,236,Gold Pines would also treat you right for that area of Lac Seul.
6752509,7 Mag,2023-07-27 05:09:00,1887,"Cedar Point is a nice camp, I stayed there last year, but unless Pat changed his mind or he sold the camp (it's for sale) he was only taking repeat customers."
6752555,SweetD,2023-07-27 07:48:00,243,"Ghost River is a cool trip and fishing is very good. I think for kids the trip through the tunnel in the rock and then the run up the huge culvert + numerous super portages (some very short) would make for an excellent trip. We have been several times but has been a little while. It is a boat in trip where the pick you up and deliver you and all the gear to your cabin. Lots of cool inlet rapids, large falls etc. to really get the full experience. If you go be sure to coordinate a trip into Singapore. It is an excellent short walk to portage lake. Good luck in your search"
6752977,Lac Seul John,2023-07-29 11:02:00,31,"Never been to Cedar so can't comment there.Respectively, you may be over thinking this. If you have not been to Canada - you really cannot go wrong with LS or Eagle or LOTW. Us crusty old vets are splitting hairs because one lake may have more smallmouth than another, or whatever . It takes a few trips before you will even notice stuff like this. Any of these lakes are beautiful, have great fishing, awesome shore lunch experiences, etc etc. It's all good for a 1st timer!Your original post seems to focus on guides. My recommendation - find a lodge on one of these lakes that has full time guides on staff. Some lodges will fill slots with local guides when needed - these can be crap shoots. Lodges have guides on staff I think that are more of a guaranteed thing. I think Pro V John from Walleye Central may be a good fit for you if you can connect. Otherwise I would stick to full timers.The difference in many lakes is the distance you need to travel to get on fish. Having a guide makes this almost a moot point. He / she will take the guess work out of it for you. The lakes will fish the same once you are on fish and he / she will get you thereAlso...since you are bringing kids and family - maybe look for a lodge with more 'modern' accommodations, newer cabins, etc. Some lodges are more 'fishing' lodges and kind of rough with cabins. I think that would be more of a factor than the lake you are on with these 3 as your choices.So....if you are looking for muskie - probably check LS off your list, esp if you want a drive in. Crappies - I think only LOTW has a population. I may be wrong - but don't think people target them on August. I've caught some really nice perch on Eagle but never targeted them. With that being said you should be plenty busy with walleye and northern on any of the 3 I mentioned.John"
6752997,adempsey2.0,2023-07-29 11:19:00,611,Solid advice.
6750691,Matcaz,2023-07-17 11:46:00,22,"I am looking for recommendations for an August 2024 family fishing vacation. We are looking for a drive-to camp that would have guides available, though a boat-in is not out of the question assuming the staff helps with the process (not going to get into the last one we did). Coming from Nebraska we are mainly looking at Sunset Country Ontario. Because this is a family trip, numbers of fish are important. That could mean walleye, small mouth, perch, or crappie; just need to keep the wife and kid's lines tight. But my two older boys and I would also like the chance to chase musky in the evening hours as well. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!"
6750697,farmnfish,2023-07-17 12:51:00,130,"a few year ago my family did what you're talking about, wife and 3 younger kids. Went to Indian lake chain area north of vermillion bay. Fishing in august was good early and late in the day, smaller water that is not so overwhelming. During the middle of the day we went over to blue lake, that has an exceptionally nice beach, and went swimming. Kept everyone entertained."
6750711,PhilTickelson,2023-07-17 13:41:00,84,"Sounds like a fun trip, and good on you for getting your family up there with you! If you're really set on chasing musky, I think two of the common suggestions would be Eagle Lake or Cedar Lake. Both pretty easy to get to and both have a handful of lodges with a lot of reviews you can look up on this site. I think both lakes offer smallmouth action as well. Cedar has crappies, although I'm not sure if people catch those in August. I had friends who went to Cliff Lake on a trip, but I've seen kind of up and down reviews on that place/lake. Seems like maybe less of a numbers lake? But definitely some big walleyes/musky/trout in there. Again, I think if you're looking for fast catching, it may not be the best choice unless you have a lot of experience on it. ProV will probably chime in with other great suggestions for the area, he's a reliable source of info, he must live up there or something cause he's always posting pictures from Cedar, Cliff, Eagle, etc. I'll put in a recommendation for Five Lake Lodge near Red Lake though. It's on Gullrock Lake which has fabulous walleye and pike fishing. A legit shot at a mid 40"" pike on that lake system, while I know that's not musky, it's in the same genre! I think Ian also has boats cached on lakes with Musky and smallmouth if you want a change of pace. I've caught a few over 40"" pike up there, and a 28.5"" walleye. But there's always at least a few 30"" walleye that come out of that lake each year it seems. And there's a few spots that have consistently produced nonstop action as well. The lodge owners are absolutely fantastic, they have a great camp/facilities, including a bunch of inflatables and swim raft type stuff setup in their protected bay. You're also real close to the town of Red Lake, which is nice, run into town a couple nights for some dinner, or grab some donuts/coffee from Tim Horton's for a change of pace. I believe he offers guided fishing as well to get you goin. I've also seen him take people out who were struggling just to get them going in the right direction. He grew up in Red Lake and spent many years guiding fishing and hunting trips on that lake system. He knows the area as well as anyone, so he is really able to give you solid intel on where to go, what to try, etc. It's worth giving him a call just to get more info!"
6750713,7 Mag,2023-07-17 14:05:00,1887,"I would look at Cedar lake or Lake of the woods, both have everything that you're looking for, LOTW's will have a lot more camps to choose from."
6750717,Ricky Spanish,2023-07-17 15:03:00,1298,Temple Bay Lodge is a drive to on Eagle Lake that tics all those boxes. Been there a couple dozen times.
6750719,jambi,2023-07-17 15:25:00,504,"Young's Wilderness Camp on LOTW. Boat in camp on an island (about a 8 minute easy boat ride). Remote feel, no other lodges in sight. Lots of fish to catch close to camp. Muskies too. American plan or Housekeeping."
6750753,NARDA 1,2023-07-17 19:09:00,636,"Check out WWW.BIRCHDALELODGE.COM 807-227-5262 Owners name is Marcel. Located on Eagle Lake nice cabins and equipment. An American plan where you chose what to eat off a menu like in a restaurant. Guides are available fro Musky, walleye, pike, smallmouth. I will be going up in September for my 33rd year at Birch Dale."

6750859,Lac Seul John,2023-07-18 12:42:00,31,"I've fished out of Young's Wilderness with a guide - great experience. Guide was Trevor. I hear he moved on and bought the bait shop in town. I think he still guides. I've fished with a bunch of guides in my life - and he is about as good as they come. Great personality and knows how to catch fish. I found this place while researching new spots and had a bunch of emails back and forth with the owner and one of the guides. We did not end up going there - but it is definitely on my bucket list for a trip in the near future. They maintain a group of guides that are dedicated to this lodge and that work together. https://www.canadafish.com/meet-the-team Or...hook up with Prov1800 from this site. He posts quite a bit on this site and seems to fish the LOTW, Eagle Lake, Lac Seul area. I have never fished with him - but he seems like a great guy based on the way helps others and posts on this site."
