6752815,Nwoh_AM,2023-07-28 08:15:00,8,Thanks for the heads up on no bait. I used salted minnows last time and they worked great. Could someone describe or attach a link for these walleye spinners? Not sure exactly what is referred to.
6752817,Nwoh_AM,2023-07-28 08:17:00,8,Where are some good places to target perch? We have hooked a few while walleye jigging and would love to catch more. The hosts (and most Canadians) seem to consider them trash fish.
6752827,Mojo-NC,2023-07-28 08:45:00,1929,"Here's a link to a bunch of spinner rigs. I make my own but you can also buy them pre-rigged. You can use a bottom bouncer weight, a Lindy No-Snagg weight, or sometimes a bullet weight and fish it like a Carolina-rig. Some guys use a banana weight in front of a floating jig with a crawler out in the deep water to catch suspended walleyes. They all work. Just use a heavy enough weight to keep it on the bottom based on the depth you're fishing. I like to use about 45"" of leader on my spinner rigs (pre-made rigs usually come with a 60"" leader). These can be tipped with a minnow, a crawler, a leech, or a plastic baitfish mimic.https://www.amazon.com/walleye-spinn...ye+spinner+righttps://www.northlandtackle.com/bott...s-for-walleye/"
6752829,wallguy1992,2023-07-28 08:50:00,19,most perch in lac Seul you will notice are quite thin and generally full of worms when they get above 10‚Äù
6752961,Lac Seul John,2023-07-29 09:23:00,31,"I agree with pretty much everything that has been said. I've been up to that camp 3 times late August. Fish can be awesome there in August. It is tough to get useful info at the camp. It takes a while, but you just have to find the right person! There is one younger guy who works the dock - he was great to us. Got in the boat and pointed to spots on my navionics and let me mark them. He showed us the spot where he won the camp tournament and other go to spots he has when he guides. Based on my limited fish understanding it seemed like his thought process was spot on for the time of year we were there. He said he worked there for years and left for another job or school or something and just got back. Sorry, I cannot remember his name. We had great success talking with other guests there and dm's from people on this site. That really made a huge difference for us. I would not go to Vaughn. Well, at least based on my experience at that time of year. I would instead focus on mid lake structure - wind blown points & steeper drop offs along rocky shore lines are the easiest to find. I think the best is basketball to car tire size rocks that slope in at about a 45 degree angle. Fishing alongside the sheer slopes of large granite slabs can be good also. Just start fishing and / or use your electronics and focus on areas where you start to mark fish. Typically better fishing but tougher to find are sunken islands and humps. Navionics app is only about 50% correct - so you pretty much need to just luck into finding them or having someone at camp tell you about them. We slayed them within 3 miles of camp. No need to really travel far. But....if you want to explore I recommend taking a trip out to the pine point area. I don't know if the fishing is any better there, but it is pretty darn good and exploring different parts of the lake is fun. We go pretty light - 1/8th and 3/16th ou jigs, 8lb nano fil, 8lb flouro leader on an ultra light rod. We use a 5'6"" Fenwick HMX ultra light. I just looked now and they may not be making nano fil and / or that rod anymore - what a bummer! We fish with crawler halves - string them onto the jig so they jiggle in the water like a leech. Better yet are leeches - but a bit pricey compared to crawlers and really not needed cause crawlers catch plenty. We did not use a minnow last trip. I am sure they would be great, but crawlers are just fine, easier to store, and cheaper. They will run out of minnows at times also - so having your own crawlers is nice. It may be tough to finesse / fish my way if you don't have spot lock. So maybe Plan B should be to pull 2 to 3 ou bottom bouncers wth crawler harnesses. Number 4 colorado blade about 3 foot behind the bouncer at 1.0 - 1.6 mph. If you are going to fish faster use willow blades or double willows. You can just find a decent looking shoreline and pull that thing in 12 to 25 fow and you will eventually find the fish. We stay inside of 30 fow just to reduce the mortality on released fish. We have a lot of fun jigging so don't pull harnesses much. I think you will catch larger fish on harnesses, but it is kind of boring compared to jigging. I am sure slow death would be awesome, but there is a bit of trick rigging that hook to spin the right way. IMO - crawler harnesses are easier and more speed tolerant, so we go with that. I've had disappointing experiences with guides there. Get one if you have concerns about getting lost or finding out where the rocks are. Maybe consider not getting a guide if you feel kind of confident in your own ability to pattern fish and get hook ups. Good luck and be sure to report back!"
6753045,brett13,2023-07-29 16:20:00,51,"its been years since i've been up there in August. We stay in Ear Falls, and travel down to steamboat bay on the regular. Going up August 12 in a few weeks. If i remember correctly, it seems like 15+ feet deep, don't go past 30' to keep mortality rates down. We pull spinners with crawlers. Again, it's been years, so should be interesting to say the least when i go back in a few weeks."
6753071,Nwoh_AM,2023-07-29 20:36:00,8,Appreciate the solid info. Last trip I fished the entire time without sonar. Having that on my boat this time will make a big difference. With all the rocks doesn't a bottom bouncer get snagged pretty often? It does sound like a good way to cover an area to find the fish. Pine point was one of the areas they mentioned to us at the lodge. We just never made it over there. The weather on that trip was not very good. It was cold and rained every day. The only nice days were the evening we arrived and the day we left (of course!).Edit: I'm not used to this forum yet. If I don't quote or reply to your post it's not on purpose. I've read them all.
6753099,Pooch,2023-07-30 07:36:00,4618,"Bottom bouncers are pretty easy to fish on LS as it has a lot of sand or muck bottom. Yes, there are rocky areas to get snagged on, but much easier than a true rocky shield lake. Pulling a bouncer on a lake with soft bottom, you will find that you have a harder time knowing when the bouncer is dragging bottom. Very little feedback even with braid line. You can go from soft to hard bottom and back and immediately feel the difference. If you get snagged pulling a BB, most of the time it is the spinner that gets caught. Don't pull it in harder, back up and get on the backside of it then try to pull it out. Keeping the wire on the BB at a ninety degree angle bend helps feedback and keeps the bait slightly higher out of the rocks. BB is a pretty straight forward way of fishing. Easy to get the hang of it. I use baitcasters for BB and keep my thumb on the spool without engaging the crank. That way I can feed line and regulate ""drag"" with my thumb until I get a hit. When (not if) you get snagged, by thumbing the spool you can keep just enough tension to not pull the snag harder, but just keep enough to keep your line straight pointing to where the snag is. We might cross paths when you are there. Pooch"
6753775,Steve Comerford,2023-08-03 08:20:00,28,Joek3 - are there worms in the perch?
6754107,Nwoh_AM,2023-08-05 06:30:00,8,I appreciate the info given both here and in PMs. I would be curious on hearing some advice on areas and methods that would allow smaller boats to avoid the roughest water. My boat doesn't handle 2 ft waves very good. Are there areas you would recommend for certain conditions? Concerning Vaughn Lake: different ones mentioned it would not be their first pick. Is that because of lack of fish or just trophy potential. We are planning to fish in there some at least and perhaps more on windy days.
6754179,pjshorthorn,2023-08-05 21:28:00,5654,Yes .worms are in the fish. PjShorthorn
6754557,fred44,2023-08-09,4,What part of Lac Seul do you like to fish in August ?
6754593,PRO-V16,2023-08-09,454,Anywhere over reefs with deep water nearby.
6753103,Pooch,2023-07-30 07:48:00,4618,"One more thing.... BB size or weight.1 ounce is mostly too light to hold bottom with anything more than a plain hook and leech or minnow and slow moving. I avoid them unless just barely moving.1.5 ounce is a good general weight for small spinner blades under about 1.2 mph.2 ounce feels like pulling a dead pig around, but it will handle, faster trolling, larger blades, crank baits or bulky plastics.3 ounce feels like dragging half of a beef around. But sometimes has a place, but not very often. I would not spend the money on them. Deep fishing for lakers, maybe they are useful. For walleye and staying in the no deeper than 25' range focus on 1.5 and maybe 2 ounce bouncers. The shallower you fish the lighter BB you can use.If you have little or no experience with bouncers, bring some extras........PoochPS: Pine Point itself is about a half mile of decent to good fishing. Pretty area, but is a well known ""public"" spot."
6753765,Nwoh_AM,2023-08-03 07:54:00,8,We will definitely be using fresh minnows from the lodge and I will be bringing 2 dozen gulp minnows. How many dozen nughtcrawlers (per person) would you recommend purchasing in addition? (Plan to order them in Dryden)
6752693,Nwoh_AM,2023-07-27 16:45:00,8,"I'm going to Mahkwa Lodge as part of a 10 person group the week of August 13. Most of our group was there in Sept 2019. We struggled a bit to find the walleyes. While a few of us are experienced on Lake Erie, I would describe us as knowledgeable beginners on Lac Seul. We were disappointed with the level of help we received from the hosts in locating fish, but sounds like that's normal. We will probably venture out a little farther this year, but would prefer within 5-6 miles. Walleye: We are more interested in numbers than trophy fish. Planning to take jigs and salted minnows. Anything else we should use?Pike: will definitely be spending some time chasing the northerns. Again not too concerned about trophy size. I really enjoy catching anything over 26"". We primarily fished spoons in the weedbeds last time with limited success. Planning to take a few spinners and Rapalas. This year we plan to fish Vaughn Lake (was closed last time). Will this be productive or would we be better off sticking to the main lake?General tips welcomed. Not looking for specific locations, but any advice/directions appreciated!"
6752725,Limeyangler,2023-07-27 19:37:00,563,"Did you hire a guide? Looks like it's only $175 with a shore lunch thrown in, might be worth doing if you havent already gone that route. I fish quite a bit west of there and this time of year they are typically 15 to 30' FOW, points and reefs. What boats/electronics you running? I find vertical jigging most productive, just watch your screen, mark some fish, hit spot lock and you're good to go. Many years ago I fished a spot right near the camp called Grassy Bay, it's by the bridge on the Kejick Bay Road, really weedy back there but the walleye and smallmouth were stacked up in there. Maybe look at the free depth maps on the navionics website, see if you can identify some midwater humps and drop offs near the camp."
6752737,Nwoh_AM,2023-07-27 20:06:00,8,"We prefer to fish without a guide. Maybe that's crazy I don't know. A few of us fished with a guide on a day trip to Vaughn Lake back in Sept 2016. I would probably recognize some of the points we fished, but it was later in the season. As to boats: we'll be renting one boat from the lodge. My boat is a 16ft Lowe with 35hp tiller steer and foot control trolling motor. Fairly basic sonar unit. This boat does not like anything over 1-2 ft waves, but we have taken it on Lake Erie several times. The third boat is a 19ft deep V that is set up well for trolling on Lake Erie. It's got the I pilot trolling motor and electronics, etc. This boat would be no problem venturing 10+ miles. In 2019 we relied pretty heavily on Navionics Boating app for navigation. That worked very well for us.Vertical jigging is my favorite way to catch walleye."
6752755,PRO-V16,2023-07-27 21:33:00,454,I've fished most of the lake between Deception landing (east end) to Vaughn. Vaughn is great early as it's a spawning sanctuary but wouldn't be my first pick that time of year. I've had several friends that have fished out of Makwa. They report that you don't have to go more than a mile or two from camp to catch all you want. Find reefs/rock piles with deep water nearby and you should find fish. We usually vertical jig. I wouldn't waste my money on commercial salted minnows as I've never found any that worked worth a darn. I would buy minnows at the resort or use 1/3 of a crawler on a jig. If the wind quits and the bite with it we will switch to a spinner/ bottom bouncer combo or shad raps. For pike I like a large Doctor Spoon in chrome. Cast or troll it. They're hungry there.

6752773,Joek3,2023-07-28 05:04:00,244,"Couldn't agree more on salted minnows. Ditch them and buy fresh minnows. Also 2nd the bottom bouncer comment on windless sunny day. Use a SLO-Death hook. You just can't beat a jig and minnow most of the time. Also, take advantage of morning and evening bites. We target perch during middle of day."

6752793,eyecatcher1,2023-07-28 06:22:00,323,Is it even legal to take salted minnows anymore? Last year I was asked if I had and live bait or bait that used to be alive. Check on that before you spend your money.
6752799,Mojo-NC,2023-07-28 06:42:00,1929,"I have had better success during the late summer months using crawlers rather than minnows, but both work. Focus on 25' of water on rocky points or deep water humps. That time of year I think you'll have better luck catching pike while jigging for walleyes or while trolling spoons and deep water crankbaits, not casting. We also pull spinner rigs along ""fishy looking"" deep water shorelines to find walleyes in areas that you might otherwise miss."
6752811,PRO-V16,2023-07-28 07:48:00,454,You can't bring bait of any kind. Northerns are everywhere. Plastic is great when you get on a hot bite.
