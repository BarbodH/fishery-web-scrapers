Seemed to be no real difference between the two. Biggest walleye was 28 and quite a few over 22. Always impressed with the shoulders on those bigger Lac Seul walleye! Water temperature was just below 70 degrees F for our whole trip. Water levels seemed normal to me. Caught a few mid 30 pike with a few smaller ones mixed in, several small smallmouth with a beautiful 17 1/2 as the best of those, cleaned a few nice perch, and remarkably also caught around a half dozen small rock bass! Pretty interesting being there for the tournament out of Ear Falls. Around 75 boats participating, and we found our secret spots are not so secret! While there were a lot of boats, we never felt crowded. Mostly fished Steamboat Bay, but did run to McKenzie Bay one time. Usually fishing is better for our group in McKenzie, but this trip the fishing was about the same closer to camp. Weather was helpful to the consistent fishing I think. There were only a few hours we couldn't fish where we wanted because of wind, and the only rain was a very impressive but short lived storm. Stayed at Gawley's Little Beaver for somewhere around the 15th time. Couldn't be happier with the hospitality and accommodations. Free ice, free dockage with electricity, clean cabins with 2 fridges and a freezer in our cabin, and located about 7 miles south of Ear Falls. Had my favorite Canadian wildlife sighting yet when a lynx ran across the 502! Also saw an otter, plenty of eagles, and several pelicans. Stopped at Dutchies in Perrault Falls on the way up. They had leeches and we got some, but they were really no better or worse than other live bait. They have an assortment of 16 oz cold adult beverages there for something like $2.70 per can. Pretty nice to have a cold one right when we got to camp! There was some road construction on the Trans Canada between Dryden and Vermilion Bay. Was about a half hour delay on the way up and much less delay on the way back. Just like every year, we booked next year before we left and can't wait to get back!"
