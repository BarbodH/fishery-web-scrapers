Dropped at stream edge and went downstream to cabin on grassy point. 3 incoming streams/rivers, one outgoing. As always, fish were found at those places as they were sitting on bottom picking off food. Lots of 20ish walleye. Lots of 20ish smallies also. Fight like dickens vs walleye. Took guide first day with shore lunch. Picked up another spot or 2 to check. one being bowl depression in middle of weed bed. cabin was functional and no issues. Queen size mattresses is plus. had generator for 2 guys with CPAP machines. Solar lights in cabin. Train was on time both coming and going. outgoing took while to load as there were 3 sets of canoes loading up. We got to station just in time to get prime parking spot for unloading. 2 guys and 2 teenagers in cabin upstream with Shooting Star also. They caught 31"" walleye. I saw pic. Fat Pig. Also several big pike. Had 3 noobies along but everything went well. Lots of laughter, stories, and BSing. home at 4am as we drove straight thru. caught more fish ned rigging than i did jigging. topwater was good for smallies. I have jig with underspin that I always catch fish on. The guys upstream did a lot of drop shoting to catch most of their walleye. My opinion is if you had anything that looked edible on bottom, the fish would hit it. Rocky bottom so lost some tackle, but hey, that's part of the game. Time to turn my attention to Esser lake out of Nakina at the end of month with wife."
