6754651,nitroman,2023-08-10,368,"Cedar by far, September is one of my favorite months to be there. Give Ray and Kathie a call at Cedar Point Resort."

6753759,Steve Comerford,2023-08-03 07:39:00,28,"Zimm21, what type of fish do you want to catch?"
6753771,Zimm21,2023-08-03 08:11:00,5,Walleye #1Pike and Muskie #2Bringing a friends son who hasn't fished much so looking for quality over trophy.Was thinking cedar lake and doing 2 trips over to zizania private for that experience.Thoughts?
6753779,Spurgery,2023-08-03 08:37:00,79,No Muskie at Stormer. Too far north. Walleye and pike and maybe a bass or two but I wouldnâ€™t plan on catching many bass. Outstanding walleye fishery though.
6753793,Larry S,2023-08-03 10:02:00,665,"Zimm21 it depends on type of fish Walleye & Pike at Stormer and Cedar, Cedar also has Muskie. Also Stormer is an American plan and More Expensive than Cedar from which you have a Choice of a number of camps You Vacation, Your Choice!! Larry Schroeder"
6753797,Walleye2242,2023-08-03 10:18:00,263,Stormer...price is up there. american plan only. they are trying to sell camp. Fishing is amazing for walleye. hardly any traffic. cedar...more species. lower prices i would assume. more lake traffic? not as secluded? If i had the funds...for me...Stormer all day long. not even close.
6753799,Carnhzkr,2023-08-03 10:18:00,964,"I don't know about Stormer or Cedar, but can vouch for Zizania. I did a one-day fly-in with PJShorthorn last September. If they removed all of the walleyes from that lake, the water level would drop by 4 feet. I think 3 of us caught over 300 for the day. If you're looking for numbers, that's the place, but you probably won't catch anything big. We did get a couple pretty decent pike by accident though. I think PJ caught one in the mid to upper 30s, if I remember right."
6753801,Walleye2242,2023-08-03 10:20:00,263,When it was with Doug Gawley i did a 1 day fly in to zizania.....you had to put your pole down to stop catching walleye. It was all day long every minute.
6753803,Spurgery,2023-08-03 10:23:00,79,Cedar has 4 or 5 lodges on it. Still a very good fishery but would be much less secluded than Stormer.
6753805,Carnhzkr,2023-08-03 10:28:00,964,"OP mentioned maybe doing Zizania two days. For me, one day would be enough. It's fun to do once, but honestly gets kind of old after a few hours."
