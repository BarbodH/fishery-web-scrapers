We are taking advantage of good health we are currently enjoying and headin' north! We'll be on Tamarack Island. Completely new area to us. While the main objective is to simply get away and enjoy the splendor of LOTW, we would like to pick up a walleye or two. I assume working main lake basin humps would be the odds on favorite location, given ""normal"" conditions? We'll target Muskies and smallies too. Muskies I'm not worried about locating. They'll be in their summer haunts, main lake points and the like. Smallies will be deeper and maybe schooled up in the same general areas as walleyes. So, walleyes, in general in August. Best bets?"
6752875,Rick!,2023-07-28 12:17:00,353,"Last year I was at Young's Bay at the beginning of August. We found walleye mostly in 18-25 feet of water. Dragging crawlers and plugs produced the most fish with sharpshooting marks with jigging Raps pulling in bigger fish. Last year the water was 40+ inches higher than normal which made for easy navigating save for several deadheads. Islands are nice to hide behind if the wind comes up but if you get caught out in the open, it's a slow ride back to home base. So, know the weather outlook before adventuring south of Bigsby Island. Tight lines, good luck and have fun."
6752939,LOWrider,2023-07-29 06:50:00,40,"Ask 5 different people you'll probably get 5 different answers. LOW has so many different topographies and situations all 5 will be right depending on where you are and the conditions of that day. My recommendation would be to start as you suggest - mid lake humps and branch out from there. That could change as August progresses and water temps fluctuate. Yesterday we topped out at 73. Two days ago 82. We fish by Tamarack regularly and for the last couple of weeks fish have been relating mostly to the top of the humps as minnows and crayfish there are quite numerous. Not every hump produces so you have to be willing to move. We fished the main basin last week and the same was true. To the North the action was really good at times, but for us unpredictable. Tamarack seems to be busy this year, so you'll likely have lots of advice to go from when you get there. Good luck."
6753089,Obabikon,2023-07-30 06:55:00,2370,"The walleye patterns have been unusual for July. So, I'm not sure that the normal August patterns will hold true this year. That said... deep humps are standard for August. Humps that top out at 18' or more. Also, points in 20-25' of water."
6754191,MN_Moose,2023-08-06 06:09:00,964,LOTW North end near Kenora Water temp 71. Light wind. Tuesday evening thunderstorms. Fish were typically on main land and island points. 25' - 28' for. Off shore humps were not productive. Night crawlers worked better than leeches. Smoke from wild fires were noticeable but not terrible. Overall excellent trip.
6754195,Eckohlt,2023-08-06 07:31:00,3685,"Wow,I'm surprised they were that deep."
6754229,deadhead1,2023-08-06 11:11:00,193,I am in north east corner of LOTW and still finding walleye are shallow. getting lots on or near shore in 8 to 15 feet or on the top of shallow mid lake humps in 17 to 22 feet. casting jig with minnow or worm close to shore also getting lots of nice bass and seems like more large perch than ever.
6754459,djk50164,2023-08-08 08:26:00,370,Normally the walleye would be in the 20-30 range this time of the year but the water temps are cooler this year. Surface tmep about 75 but lake temp is around 71. Found most fish to be 12-20 feet with some as shallow as 3'. Thermocline in whitefish was only 40' which it would normally be 50-55' . Must be global warming.
6754647,Obabikon,2023-08-10,2370,"For an update... walleyes are on humps at all depths. It is very good fishing for them right now. Muskies are muskies... they're still moving around, and have not moved into any fall patterns. Have a great trip with Todd, Paul and the crew!!!!"
