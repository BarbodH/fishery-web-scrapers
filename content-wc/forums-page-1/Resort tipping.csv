We have a group of ten headed on a five day fly-in where we will be providing all meals on our own, no guides. There's a couple of dock attendants that are there for gassing motors, but little else, and of course a pilot in and return trip. It's a great facility with terrific hosts and I don't want our group to be considered ungrateful or cheap. What best shows our appreciation for the vacation provided?"
6754491,Eckohlt,2023-08-08 13:03:00,3685,"I think they'll be grateful getting a big load of money from 10 guys just paying the outfitter,I'm not sure how much each owes for the trip?"
6754497,Pooch,2023-08-08 14:11:00,4618,"When we did fly-in's we always tipped the pilot both ways. No dock hands in camp to tip. Loaders at the base camp we never tipped as we mostly loaded or handed the pilot our gear as he requested.On drive in camps with our own boats we leave a tip for the housekeeping folks.On any camp where we use camp boats we tip everyone that helps us during our stay including those fueling boats and filling minnow buckets early in the morning and the house keeping staff. Sometimes they are the same people.Last months trip wife and I (using camp boats) left $100 CDN for the workers. They work hard and season is short. That seemed about right, hopefully.Pooch"

6754515,That Minnesota guy,2023-08-08 16:48:00,8293,"$10 per man each way to the pilot. $50 per man for the dock help, maid service, and anybody else at the resort who's not an owner. Seems like a lot but they have a very short window to make their money. $70 per man isn't going to break anybody in your group, if it does maybe they should stay home."
