Now I have ATT, which should tell you something right there and an old LG phone at the time, it was a client with a question. The reception was good and the conversation lasted about 2 min and the call didn't drop. Now, if you are like me, you should be saying.....no way!!! And I would agree with you. My brother told me that if it rings again he was going to make it part of the lake structure, it didn't."
6591130,prov1800,2021-08-18 17:06:00,5010,Good one
6590430,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-15 12:30:00,429,Friend is looking at switching cell service providers on Lac Seul Ear Falls area & wonders what is the best service coverage companies? Verizon vs ATT vs Spectrum? Thanks for your input! RBF
6590444,reddemon2,2021-08-15 13:32:00,255,"Doesn't matter what carrier you have for canada, You most likely will be on the Bell Network"
6590462,prov1800,2021-08-15 14:29:00,5010,We have 2 carriers in Canada.Rogers and Bell. So whatever you have in states will log into both of them if you get holiday pkg.Your not going to get a lot if service on Lac Suel depending how far you go.
6590474,PRO-V16,2021-08-15 15:14:00,454,Buddy has an outpost at McLain Narrows. Called me from there a couple days ago using a cell booster. I couldn't make it this trip. We normally use a satellite phone which is fairly reasonable but you have to subscribe for a year. He cancelled it due to Covid. We'll activate next spring.
6590800,bus33,2021-08-17 11:58:00,289,"I have Verizon and with the international plan activated I get service in Ear Falls. You only get .5 gig of high speed per day before it goes to 2G. Like others have said, it will hit off of Bell."
6590804,phishfearme,2021-08-17 12:22:00,1242,"with ATT i the US with my iPhone, you can buy an international plan for $10 a day. it starts when you first use it and covers the next 24 hours. the international plan replicates what you have in the States. phish"
6590854,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-17 15:50:00,429,Phishfearme Thanks that's what I plan to do too. My friend is switching to ATT to & I will tell them to take out the international plan. RBF
6590872,Tonyo,2021-08-17 20:29:00,212,I would prefer the old days where I crossed the border and the phone went silent for 7 days. Just saying. TonyO
6590882,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-17 22:19:00,429,"Ummmm if one of us get selected for the random Covid-19 test, we will need a cell phone & service to make the telehealth video call to take the test with the nurse watching. You gotta be prepared to do what ya gotta do to be able to go fishing in Canada! Count down is on & I canâ€™t wait to get back up there!!! RBF"
6590910,pjshorthorn,2021-08-18 05:24:00,5654,"I miss the old days when one didn't have to worry about turning phones off.......they didn't exist I went off the grid for a reason...a complete unwind and reset. I literally didn't care what happened in the rest of the world for 8 days. When cell phones came into play, mine was shut off the minute I crossed the border....it didn't work anyway. I'd turn it one crossing back and dreaded knowing there was going to be 600-800 emails to deal with When my Dad became a bit up in age ,and still going on trips with me, he had a need to stay in touch with home. I got the international plan through Verizon and it worked well for him. I have kept it year on year because the price is pretty cheap annually. It has served me well over the years if there was a true need to make an important call. I guess I'm getting pretty old and need that coverage because I can be a complete idiot on most occasions.....at least that is what the wife leads me to believe.....yes dear. She keeps the plan up to date for me. PjShorthorn"
