6587682,mms3rd,2021-08-07 11:06:00,148,"All of my trips to fish Canada have been in NW Ontario. My son now lives on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. His drive to Vermilion Bay, as an example, is over 1700 miles. I'm a mere 990 miles. Are there resorts/camps for walleye/northern/smallmouth that would be closer to Washington State? If northern Saskatchewan is an option, I think the places would be too expensive. Yeah?"
6587690,reddemon2,2021-08-07 11:48:00,255,Why doesnt he fly to winnipeg and u can pick him up or rent a car
6587692,adempsey2.0,2021-08-07 11:54:00,611,"Consider flying commercially. I live in Ontario and am 1100 miles from Vermilion Bay. When I travel in that region I fly commercially to Thunder Bay and rent a car to my final destination. Otherwise, many of the lodges/camps in Saskatchewan are probably going to be a bit pricey. Often due to the travel distance because they fly you on small commercial jets and then take you in from there. That being said, I am sure there are places that would fit your budget."

6587872,reddemon2,2021-08-08 08:31:00,255,"Wilderness Family Outfitters on Wollaston Lake,SK is reasonable priced"
6588030,LoDo,2021-08-08 23:12:00,721,"Jan Lake Lodge on Jan Lake, Saskatchewan is a fantastic lodge. I've been a few times in my life. Big time fishery. 40"" pike is a daily catch, incredible population of walleye too. One of the nicer places I've stayed. Good luck!"
6588420,mms3rd,2021-08-09 19:19:00,148,"Thanks, looks very good....maybe too far for me..."
6589264,Prairieboy43,2021-08-11 20:01:00,38,"How far do you want to travel. Why not meet him in Washington state, and go Salmon, halibut fishing. Coho (silverbacks), Chinook are running now."
6589466,mms3rd,2021-08-12 09:36:00,148,That's what he asks me. I was born and raised in Minnesota....and fish what I know. I think that I'm too old and lame to learn something new.
6589476,Prairieboy43,2021-08-12 10:03:00,38,"You are never too old. I too am flatlander (Prairie-boy (Alberta/Saskatchewan)), however I have fished west coast a few times. It’s awesome. Rent a guide, or visit local shop and find out where they catch fish. Then go get em. Guides with boats can be expensive ($600.$1000.00/day), However they have all the equipment, experience, and put you on the fish. Once you start catching 12lb Coho (silverbacks), it’s excellent experience. You will have two, three rods down at same time, as troll through the school of fish at 60-100’. Also river fishing is fun, catch big Chinook, chum or king salmon (25+ lbs). Or even latch onto a 50lb+ halibut, jigging a 2lb weight at 300’. Like pulling a sheet plywood, 300’ by hand. Then you can enjoy the experience. I was happy to take my old man (81), west coast salmon fishing. He was grinning ear /ear. Enjoy the moment, before it’s gone. Then, Go home fish for walleye, pike, small mouth. Make it annual trip. Never too old. Good times."
