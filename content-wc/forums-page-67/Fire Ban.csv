You can even get a soft case or hard plastic case for the stove . Get a couple MSR bottles and with gasoline or Coleman fuel. I just get a gallon of Coleman fuel as many of the outposts I go to have mixed gas and you DON'T want to use the mixed gas . Had a friend try the mixed gas and it didn't work to well for him. Another option is a compact 2 burner propane stove . I have and use both , depending on how many i will cook for . Have fun !"
6590198,eyecatcher1,2021-08-14 11:59:00,323,I use a two burner propane stove when there's a fire ban. It works great!
6590248,valley366,2021-08-14 16:50:00,193,We have the 2 burner Coleman. Works great. We used to use a large oval cast iron pot that covered both burners. Took a while to get hot but kept hot through the cook. Was also hard to cool down. Many times we set it in the rocks with the oil still in it and went out and fished locally for an hour or so. Then it was cool enough to dump the oil back in the jug.I have since found a cast aluminum pot. Doesn't hold as much oil but cools down much faster. It is also deeper and has a better handle so can set it in the water too cool. Usually cool by the time we get done eating.
