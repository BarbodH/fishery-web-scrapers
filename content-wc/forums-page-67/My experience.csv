6589936,dakota eye,2021-08-13 10:37:00,69,So you didn't have to show the ArriveCAN app?
6589942,fishingMN4eyes,2021-08-13 11:04:00,108,Doesn't sound like it. I'm guessing after you submit your info on the app they are able to view it on their screen once they scan your passport/ID.
6589986,BreezyPoint,2021-08-13 13:35:00,1581,Don't assume it will be that way for you I had to show them ArriveCan receipt and paper copies of everything else.Frank
6590040,hoppy63,2021-08-13 18:23:00,367,No. We had to just show our negative covid test results.
6590046,BnD,2021-08-13 18:45:00,13,Easy for us maybe 5 minutes +/-. Very nice customs agent. Hopefully the fishing goes that well.
6590300,CiscoKid,2021-08-15 02:31:00,28,"Went through fort Frances on Saturday. Very easy process. Handed passports, printed proof of negative test, asked questions on how we felt/covid symptoms, was on the water catching my PB smallie 3 hours later. This agent had all of our bad info from ArriveCAN based on our passport numbers."
6590302,CiscoKid,2021-08-15 02:33:00,28,Meant vax info not âbadâ
6589772,hoppy63,2021-08-12 20:20:00,367,"Crossed at the soo this morning at roughly 1:30 am. Border agent was very nice. Handed her our passports as she was obviously looking at our info on computer. Handed her my Vax card and offered my partners and she said she didn't need it, she had it on the screen. She asked if either of us had any symptoms, and asked for our proof of negative covid test results which I handed her. Asked how long we were staying and if we had anything other than food or clothes we wanted to share and I declared 2- 30 packs and my partner said 1/5 of booze. She asked if we had any live bait or cannabis products which we had none and she handed our paperwork back and wished us a good trip....probably 3-4 minutes at the border. I wish you all the same."
6589774,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-12 20:42:00,429,Good to hear! Thanks for the update! Tight lines & good fishing! RBF
6589796,kettyspanky,2021-08-13 03:10:00,271,Thanks for the update. We are crossing tomorrow and hope to have it as easy you did.
6589802,Eyesore,2021-08-13 03:45:00,455,She didn't need to see your partners jab card since his vax info already showed on her screen due to his passport info? Am I reading this correctly?
6589812,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 05:07:00,3685,That was a jack pot crossing.
6589828,MikeAnkeny,2021-08-13 05:58:00,67,Hoppy days are here again!
6589832,Bill Krejca,2021-08-13 06:04:00,6107,"My first thought, but I'm guessing the reference was actually to the other information which normally shows up with the name? Stuff like DWI, etc. Bill"
6589848,eyecatcher1,2021-08-13 07:16:00,323,"I think that everything about you shows up on their screen. In 2016 when I got to the window the guys says ""I see that you got a new truck."""
6589868,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 07:53:00,3685,Wonder if will show I got a new used truck
6589886,prov1800,2021-08-13 08:38:00,5010,Few years ago i used my buddies truck to go to Iowa and pick up a boat for him.Was questioned right away why i had that truck. They see plates already from Long way away.
