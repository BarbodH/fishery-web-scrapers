That is pretty much the end of your trip anyways. No risk it all come on up! If for some random reason, you test positive prior to the end of the trip, Canada will not hold you hostage‚Ä¶ You are allowed to go home."

6589934,mms3rd,2021-08-13 10:30:00,148,Best answer to any question that I've yet seen.
6588554,mms3rd,2021-08-10 08:11:00,148,"I don't want to have to look this up, but isn't the quarantine for 10 days? If I'm booked somewhere for 6 nights and get a positive test result, do I hope the camp owner has room for me? Or do I drive to a motel somewhere. If I'm at an outpost and even get results, do I tell the outfitter that his other guests will have to wait a couple days to fly in? If I'm on the American plan, does someone drop meals outside my door? If I'm on housekeeping and need groceries, does some have to go out for me? And how about my close contacts....do they go get tested, do they self-quarantine? A lot of the posts on this stuff would sound like hysteria, but it's going to happen...and on a random basis that you can't plan for. Testing people who come into the country isn't a terrible idea, except you just made them get a test within 72 hours."

6588656,Wallychowder,2021-08-10 11:01:00,1567,I heard once the US opens the flood gates for Canadian folks that it's not going to be random testing. It will be 100% test kits !
6588686,mms3rd,2021-08-10 12:32:00,148,"I'm not too lazy, Mr. get off my lawn (smiley face). I had to go to motor vehicle to get a new license in my new state....waited for hours and then their camera went down. I have 6 sites bookmarked and didn't find it on several...found 14 days which I think is outdated and looks like it relates to air travel.... and my question was more about how to quarantine....than how long...if people can look up answers to their questions...this would be a much shorter discussion... I trust this exchange will be deleted."

6588694,Riding high,2021-08-10 12:43:00,69,I would just pack up and go home.
6588702,GetTheNet6,2021-08-10 13:15:00,11,"https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/tr...suitable-place If you scroll down to ""How to quarantine"", there is a section stating you can leave canada. If you have no symptoms, just put on a mask and return to USA"
6588804,reddemon2,2021-08-10 16:46:00,255,"Ok i looked it up, In the arrivecan app it only lets you put in a canada address for quarantine, so use the place your staying at?"
6588808,hoppy63,2021-08-10 16:49:00,367,Yes....and if you get a random and test positive you can still go home after your trip. You just need to follow Canada's protocols of masking and social distancing. That was from Canada Health Board
6588812,reddemon2,2021-08-10 16:54:00,255,thank you
