6590472,prov1800,2021-08-15 15:07:00,5010,Been doing that a lot.Easy and no oil.
6590558,Bill Krejca,2021-08-16 06:54:00,6107,"Thanks, John! Re: One over - Completely ridiculous interpretation of rules. What if you don't catch/ can't catch one over, or chose to not bring any home. Would not want to have to deal with the fellow who interprets law as such. Most wardens I have interfaced with have been more realistic. Bill"
6590566,prov1800,2021-08-16 07:25:00,5010,"I don't know any wardens that would tell you that.Depending on which lake your a one over could be 3 diff sizes.Most lakes one over 18"".But Lac Suel and Eagle have slots and understand Wabigoon Lake has one to. Keeping one over on Eagle would mean a 23""plus fish which i wouldn't even want to eat."
6590160,Guest,2021-08-14 09:54:00,0,"I heard the Canadian border guys can look up your name and tell if you have been catching a lot of fish at the Canadian camps in the last few years. Our camp owners have always required a fishing report from us. The guys catching a lot are maybe a lot more likely to keep fish to take home to the US with them. They might try and not let you in. With that said V-Bay Gord should be fine, smooth sailing to get into Canada. The rest of us, not so much."
6590168,Eckohlt,2021-08-14 10:20:00,3685,"I don't think there was much fishing going on last year,at least no one from usa,if you have a webcam in the boat the border guard I'm sure is watching,don't keep anything over 18 inches"
6590192,eyecatcher1,2021-08-14 11:56:00,323,"A few years ago I got my butt chewed by a game warden at a roadside check on 502. He asked why I didn't have any over slots and I told him that I release all of those. He said the rule was 1 over and 3 under for a reason and I better start keeping overs in the future. I have since then, but have seen negative things about that lately, so my limit next week won't have any overs in it."
6590202,skindzier,2021-08-14 12:19:00,137,"He was just plain wrong. The reg says ""not more than one over..."" Which means 4 under is fine."
6590206,Wallychowder,2021-08-14 12:52:00,1567,"Over the years i have run into a few that have been "" just plain wrong"" I think alot of them need a ""refresher course""."
6590216,pjshorthorn,2021-08-14 13:13:00,5654,He or she was just full of badge bravado. You can keep two or 4 depending on which license you have chosen. Nowhere in the regs has it ever said that you have to keep one over the slot. I’m not keeping one over the slot as those fish tend to be the breeding stock and the future of a fishery.PjShorthorn
6590228,Eckohlt,2021-08-14 14:20:00,3685,"My wife is Asian and if you keep one over 30 in I can feed every Asian in my city,plus a sht load of rice"
6590260,prov1800,2021-08-14 18:32:00,5010,So wife and i got out after having got back from Winnipeg.Needed some quite time.Man that place is noisy.We got out on Cedar this morning for some casting.Quite at Clarks but some vehicles parked in back for flyouts.Saw 4 boats today so still not much traffic.Saw 4 muskies had one on but it came off right away.Lots of pike again but slower than usual and nothing very big.Walleye fished just before we went to load up.18-24 f150 seemed best.Saw huge schools go by pretty steady on my lowrance and we did good .Had 2 good limits of eaters in no time.Caught and released a bunch more.1/8 oz jig and a juicy minnow did the trick.Hot day again after 4 days of cool front and pretty windy south wind at 30 km.Had a great walleye supper done on BBQ again.No fishing pics.lol.
6590326,Eckohlt,2021-08-15 06:36:00,3685,"Doesn't get any better than that,those minnows are the ticket for you john,juicy n free,,,,jack pot"
6590464,prov1800,2021-08-15 14:31:00,5010,Minnows at 25 ft.
6589858,v-bay gord,2021-08-13 07:30:00,3168,"Here's my report........fishing has been great, you should have been here."
6589866,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 07:50:00,3685,Not yesterday nor a week ago but a year and 3 months ago
6589888,prov1800,2021-08-13 08:39:00,5010,Iam surprised your not up here yet.
6589968,JAY221,2021-08-13 12:37:00,877,"I would of been there if I could of been there! I will enter next Thursday if the border guards agree with me. Later,Jay"
6589998,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 14:35:00,3685,"Let the rookies in first hahaha,they can scout out the border first."
6590002,prov1800,2021-08-13 14:50:00,5010,They'll agree will be a smoother transition it already is
6590132,fishman10,2021-08-14 07:41:00,226,"Living in Thunder Bay I can say the fishing has been quite good this year. Numbers and size, but water levels are low.Enjoy"
6590142,pjshorthorn,2021-08-14 08:37:00,5654,He is trying to figure how to bring crawlers with him......it has caused a slight delay. PjShorthorn
6590146,Limeyangler,2021-08-14 08:58:00,563,"Can only write about Wabigoon. We had a storm roll in last week which shut the walleye bite down on the reefs, then the wind blew 30kmh all last week making it difficult to fish the main lake. I was guiding most days last week, spent a lot of time in the smaller lakes on the Wabigoon chain, bite was slow for walleye, but we got into the pike and bass while waiting for the walleye to turn on ( and off just as quick.) Not had a chance to hit the main lake yet so will get out this evening. Walleye were in 12’ weedy areas, same as the bass, perch and crappie, pike were everywhere, big ones near deeper water depending on which area of the lake. Had a blast with 3 different groups, always something to catch. Water temps on the main lake between 65f and 69f smaller lakes no warmer than 70f. Water levels at the lowest I’ve seen it bar 2006. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=QiZHmV6qh7E&t=197s"
6590156,mms3rd,2021-08-14 09:48:00,148,"What's wrong with real time video broadcasts? I want that camera right in the boat...if they can do covid tests, well......"
6589518,JAY221,2021-08-12 11:55:00,877,"Can somebody please post a fishing report for 2021 besides John! Later,Jay"
6589520,Eckohlt,2021-08-12 12:10:00,3685,"Give them a chance to get home,As you know border just opened they need a chance to get some fishin in before reports"
6589524,Wawajake,2021-08-12 12:21:00,413,"I can only give a fishing report from 30 km east of Sault Ste Marie....surface water temp on the small/ medium lakes are 75 to 78 F , tons of rain in August so lakes are high. Fish are still locating in 9 to 11 ft of water along weedlines morn and evening, eg caught a 21 in one at 11 am on shallow running orange 5 inch rapala ...although had some success at 25 ft mid day with bottom bouncers.. but during walleye chop ( white cap waves) in evening walleye were in 5 ft water where wind was bringing bait thru the weeds. Got our limit that evening with grandkids."
6589626,Skywagon,2021-08-12 16:02:00,1106,"I don't have any grandkids, sounds like they must be good bait, where can I pick some of these up?"
6589630,JAY221,2021-08-12 16:11:00,877,"Them grandkids are harder to come by than the live bait you can't take across the border. I gave them 4 days to fish before asking for a report I think that is reasonable. Later, Jay"
6589632,Wawajake,2021-08-12 16:19:00,413,"start with two daughters, wait 20 or more years, find a couple son in laws, after you pay for the weddings, wait a few more years, and with great genetics from grand parents you can end up with 5 grand kids. Bring them fishing every chance you get, they don't need a license for awhile , now add them to your walleye limit, and hope they don't like eating fish as much as you do."
6589698,JAY221,2021-08-12 18:19:00,877,"That will pretty much be how it plays out. I only got 4 of the grand kids but have 6 great grand kids! Thanks for the report Wawajake. Later, Jay"
6589836,Bill Krejca,2021-08-13 06:06:00,6107,"I got 10, but you can't have any of them!!!! Bill"
6589838,prov1800,2021-08-13 06:09:00,5010,I've refrained from posting for a bit.Will say weather has not been favorable this week with very high winds and some rain.
6589850,prov1800,2021-08-13 07:22:00,5010,And a cold front.Have been out of province for a few days but plan on fishing in next couple of days and see how busy lakes are.
