6590318,five in the box,2021-08-15 06:08:00,17,"I know I've posted some of this on other threads but wanted to share my full experience from our trip to Lac Seul. We crossed the border in I-falls on Monday August 9th. We were in line at 3:30 am and were just making it to the toll bridge at 9:15 am. I was getting nervous because my COVID test was taken at 9:42 am the previous Friday and I knew we wouldn't make it by then. At 10:30 am we made it to 1 of the 4 open booths. It was taking 5-8 minutes to get a vehicle through. The agents were very nice and very patient with us. They asked for our passport/ID like normal and then wanted vaccine cards and test results. They asked about bait and I am in agreement they were not going to let anything (salted minnows, crawlers, leeches, etc) in. They asked the rest of the normal questions and a few COVID questions like are you feeling sick and any exposure. We were on our way in 5 minutes. None of our 4 people (2 trucks) were selected for random COVID testing. Once in we stopped at a bait shop in Ft Frances, a bait shop in Dryden, and the Safeway in Dryden. Masks were mandated in all indoor places and it was 100% followed by all. I was humbled by the number of Canadians that walked up or drove up to welcome us back and thank us for coming. I'm not kidding when I say in those 3 spots we had 10 different people make their way over to talk to us. On a side not we got our bait at a new shop in Dryden called Clark's Bait. Incredibly nice people and great location! Travel in Canada was super easy. Hardly saw any other boats on the 502 or 72. When we arrived and for the week there was only us and one other group in camp. Fishing? Yeah, we didn't forget about that. Lac Seul is low 3 ft low but really didn't change my navigation or create more hazards for me. Monday night there was smoke in the air but I never noticed it the rest of the week. The rest of the week was unusually windy, but fishing was lights out. 2 guys in our boat and we caught 623 walleyes in 5 days. 27¬î was or biggest but we had over 40 bigger than 23¬î. I included a pic of a 27¬î/23¬î double my dad and I had. Finally we came home yesterday. We crossed back into the US at 3:30 pm. One line open and 1 car ahead of us. Showed passport, answered normal questions, and were back on US soil in a couple minutes. Sorry for the long winded post but it was a trip full of memories and wanted to share my experience for those going soon."

6590390,Reidfish,2021-08-15 09:53:00,3,Nice count on the walleye! If you don't mind me asking did you see any different action on bait types? What depths were the most consistant for early morning? Or did you just trust electronics for spotting pools?
6590396,Bill Krejca,2021-08-15 10:11:00,6107,"Thanks for the report, Five, heading up later in September. Hoping to converse with someone from the Cedar Rapids area who found a test facility which can produce return quickly. Hv-Vee Drug and Walgreens apparently use the same lab for testing, may not share a fast turnaround, according to a Hy-Vee pharmacist, maybe will improve in a few weeks? Bill"

6590408,five in the box,2021-08-15 10:29:00,17,We run all crawlers using spinners to locate pods on areas we know hold fish and then spot lock with jigs on pods of bigger fish. I will say Gulp and reaction baits were far less effective than crawlers.
