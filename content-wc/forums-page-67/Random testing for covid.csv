6588458,RichA$1970,2021-08-09 20:51:00,1159,That really sucks especially as I have a fly in on a Monday morning. I hope they are open and that site should 24/7 on Sunday but really a crock of BS.
6588460,hoppy63,2021-08-09 20:52:00,367,"I'm curious the percent of people crossing were the ""lucky"" winners......haven't heard many horror stories, but I sure sympathize with those who won the lottery."
6588462,Skywagon,2021-08-09 20:59:00,1106,"I have two friends that got the random test that are spending the night with us because it had gotten so late and they needed good internet to contact the testing facility. They tried to get through for the test, but there was over 2300 people ahead of them in queue when they got shut out before 8:00 pm, the site said there was an overload. They will be trying again at 6:00 in the morning. It took them 8 1/2 hours in line to get through the border, now they have no idea how long it will take to get to get the test done, they will have lost more than a day of fishing time at the best. Canada really dropped the ball on this one."
6588470,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 23:20:00,1581,Ok folks. It is now 12:11 AM. I have completed the test kit. I still don't know where to drop or if I can schedule a pickup.Total wait time was nine hours 26 minutes. I'm tired. I will figure out the drop tomorrow as the site would not let me do it. I kept receiving error messages. Hopefully I can resolve this and go out fishing!Frank
6588472,troutwater,2021-08-10 04:00:00,299,"Is there any way to schedule something with a healthcare provider there for the test, or does it have to be the online ordeal?"
6588474,C182P,2021-08-10 04:28:00,59,It's Canada. Nothing happens fast when it comes to healthcare. Hurry up and wait is the protocol. You could proabably schedule an appointment for mid November.
6588476,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 04:41:00,3685,Has anyone said what happens if you don't get the test done?
6588478,Twodogs,2021-08-10 05:05:00,115,I'm with you Eckohlt..what would happen if you don't take the test? We're spending the first night in Thunder Bay then continuing on in the morning. I'm not going to wait in TB for hours. Are they going to drive 180 miles to the Lodge to find us? No internet where we're staying and a phone signal occasionally if you go out to the dock stand on one leg with your tongue hanging out.
6588484,walleyecheek,2021-08-10 05:35:00,2231,"They come and find you, and you have to run the lemonade stand &#x1f923;"
6588496,Eckohlt,2021-08-10 06:05:00,3685,"They better not find me in a outhouse,they'll get there lemonade alright,,,for free.It's the same color as lemonade."
6588364,manfishing,2021-08-09 16:52:00,131,Did anyone get randomly picked to get a covid test while crossing the border
6588390,stjoeguy,2021-08-09 18:00:00,979,"He'll probably fill in the details later when he can, but I just heard from a friend that crossed this afternoon. The two cars in front of him took 30 minutes. He was done with the paperwork at the window in 5 minutes. Then he was selected for the random test. When he emailed me he was 1,219 in the queue to complete the test and had been waiting 3 hours. He said he'd get back after completing the test, but I haven't heard anything yet. That was an hour ago."
6588402,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 18:40:00,1581,"Ok, the random test sucks. I was picked. You have to do a video chat to complete the test. I started 4 hours and 45 minutes ago at 2086 in the queue. I am now 788 in queue and based on the most recent 30 minutes progress, I have 2.75 hours to go.Crossing the border at Baudette went fairly well. They had two lanes open. One lane made no progress at all. In my lane I had two vehicles in front of me. They took 30 minutes.My wife and I drove in two vehicles as she may have to leave early. When my turn came, it took no more than five minutes. My wife was even less than that. They were flagging quite a few vehicles over. Way more than normal. I have no idea why; maybe it is because they didn't have their paperwork ready or complete.A few people were walking across the bridge to jettison their crawlers. When the agent asked me about crawlers I said I didn't have any and he thanked me implying that there have been many people with crawlers.After he was done questioning me he said congratulations, you have been randomly selected for a Covid test and he handed me a box with the test kit. The swab must be completed within 24 hours. As a consequence I have been sitting online for a long, long time.You need an internet connection good enough for a video chat and the test has to be shipped to a lab within 48 hours of completion of the swab. We are on a satellite connection here. I hope it is good enough for the video chat.If you are flying out say a prayer you don't get selected.Frank"
6588426,mms3rd,2021-08-09 19:32:00,148,"what does this ""in the queue"" mean.....the total number of people having to take a test at all cross points at a specific time? I assume it isn't the number at one cross point.....the numbers seem so large. I've read lots about this process, but if you self-administer test, how do you get results? when?"
6588432,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 19:40:00,1581,"You have to create an account online, then start a video chat. They must witness you taking the sample. The number in queue is the position in the waiting line for the video chat.They give you a shipping pouch for Purolator to return the test. They send you your result via email. I am not sure where I will have to drop the package. According to my resort owner Purolator doesn't come to his town.I am now down to about two hours wait.Frank"
6588436,joeflip,2021-08-09 19:45:00,75,"Seems like if I am randomly selected, there's a very good chance that flying into a remote area might not be possible, I might have to look at other options, the flight base itself has sketchy internet on a good day, and just forget about any at the outpost, definitely going to contact my outfitter and see what scenario they have in place."
6588448,RichA$1970,2021-08-09 20:34:00,1159,Why would they just not have you do the sample right there and give it them to process? Hopefully that site is open 24/7 but sorry to hear the BS you got tagged with.
6588452,C182P,2021-08-09 20:37:00,59,And word I got from another lucky winner of the random test kit is they were 2000th in the que and the online test center closed at 8pm and doesn't open again till 6 am. So I guess they log in at 6 am and wait their turn in the que. could take all day. then the courier has to come pick up the test. Then you have to somehow be able to get online in the next couple of days to check your Results. Basically sounds like you just as well turn around if you get one unless you have good internet and lots of time to spend on it where you're going.
6588454,C182P,2021-08-09 20:40:00,59,These are self test kits. Customs just hands them out. They have nothing to do with administering them. The website is NOT open 24 7. Closes at 8 pm and reopens at 6 am
6588456,BreezyPoint,2021-08-09 20:48:00,1581,The site does not close at 8pm CDT. I know because I am still on it and it is 9:48 pm CDT.Frank
