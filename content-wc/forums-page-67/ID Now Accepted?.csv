6589950,Robby1walleye,2021-08-13 11:27:00,17,They will not accept a Rapid antigen test. ID Now is a rapid diagnostic test. It's processed in-house not sent off to a lab. It's an NAAT test.
6590112,Twins_dad,2021-08-14 05:57:00,38,"The accepted pre-entry test list includes a isothermal amplification test. The ID Now test uses that technology according to documentation from the Walgreens site. If anyone has had any issue with this test being accepted, please let us know. I'll get mine on September 8!"
6590214,David Anderson,2021-08-14 13:07:00,2073,"Trout, I am right next to you in Dayton and my friend from Champlin are heading up September 4th. May I ask where you got your test as I inquired at the Walgreens on 169 and did not get a very good answer from them. I have time to research but your post seemed like a great place to start!"
6590292,valley366,2021-08-14 20:56:00,193,I went in and talked to the Pharmacist at the one on Rockford road in Plymouth. They have the quick test that is allowed by Canada.

6590454,bones82,2021-08-15 14:02:00,121,Walgreens does the Nucleic with a 2 hour turnaround time. These tests are considered acceptable molecular tests: * PCR - Polymerase chain reaction * RT-PCR Ã¢Â€Â“ reverse transcription real time PCR * Quantitative PCR (qPCR) - [x] Nucleic acid test (NAT) or Nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs) * Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) * Isothermal amplification * Droplet digital PCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) * Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) * RNA (Ribonucleic acid) * Ct (cycle threshold) * CRISPR * Sequencing * Next generational sequencing (NGS) or whole genome sequencing (WGS) * Oxford Nanopore sequencing (LamPORE) * Detection of the N gene * Detection of Orf1a/b * Detection of the S gene * Detection of the E gene * Detection of the RdRp gene Antigen not accepted.
6590470,bigeee99,2021-08-15 14:53:00,8,The ID Now test is the type which is on the list of approved tests. Get one if you can.
6590970,skap,2021-08-18 08:43:00,58,"We just got back from a quick trip to Sioux Lookout last weekend and they accepted our ID Now Walgreens tests for all 3 of us. I wasn't really concerned as it was on their list, but you never know I guess. Side note, only took about 45 minutes to get the results emailed to us. As long as you have all your information filled out in the app etc you will be good to go. Safe travels all."
6589212,Robby1walleye,2021-08-11 19:03:00,17,What test did you take? From ?
6589230,djk50164,2021-08-11 19:23:00,370,Just a molecular test from a hospital which I believe are shipped to texas and normally 24-48 hr. Naat were not available anymore in my area.
6589234,Robby1walleye,2021-08-11 19:25:00,17,Hope for the best. Good luck!
6589258,Prairieboy43,2021-08-11 19:39:00,38,Try Greenback test. ðŸ’µ
6589336,djk50164,2021-08-12 03:19:00,370,received results this morning 12:48 am now just have to get across before 4am
6589358,djk50164,2021-08-12 06:05:00,370,sorry 4pm
6589374,Eckohlt,2021-08-12 06:35:00,3685,"Thought maybe you were driving a rocket ship 12:48am and arrive 4am,good luck dJk keep us posted."
6589468,mms3rd,2021-08-12 09:39:00,148,thought maybe you had a wormhole to go through......see what I did there?
6589508,kettyspanky,2021-08-12 11:02:00,271,I did the Walgreens ID now test and it is a NAAT test. I got my results in a hour. I printed out the results and I just have to do the ArriveCan and I'm good to go. Good luck to all.
6589948,fishingMN4eyes,2021-08-13 11:22:00,108,"Anybody around Minnesota used this service for testing? https://app.acuityscheduling.com/sch...qm81fqonlgipg1I was under the impression these rapid tests didn't meet the Canada requirements, but now I'm hearing conflicting stories...?"
6588934,Robby1walleye,2021-08-11 05:54:00,17,Just wondering if anyone has crossed that used the ID Now Test?
6588946,JAY221,2021-08-11 06:16:00,877,"I have not been yet but I donâ€™t see that test on the accepted list of tests. Later, Jay"
6588960,troutwater,2021-08-11 06:24:00,299,Are you talking the Walgreens ID Now? I used that and crossed no problem yesterday. Just make sure to print out the PDF version
6588962,Robby1walleye,2021-08-11 06:25:00,17,It's a rapid NAAT test. I think they'll accept just making sure.
6588978,troutwater,2021-08-11 07:09:00,299,Correct thats what it is. I had my results in 30 minutes. The PDF is what actually listed what type of test it was.
6588998,kettyspanky,2021-08-11 08:09:00,271,I was hoping that test is allowed since that's the one I'm getting tomorrow.
6589002,Robby1walleye,2021-08-11 08:30:00,17,Ok Trout water thanks for info. Did you upload the PDF into ArriveCAN?
6589026,troutwater,2021-08-11 09:07:00,299,"No place to upload the test actually, I just handed him our vaccine cards and print outs of the test PDF when he asked. I've heard digital works as well, but the print outs worked well for us."
6589206,djk50164,2021-08-11 18:57:00,370,Seems like this 72 hour is going to be a problem. Walgreens is running out of the naat test and the labs for the molecular test are getting slower on getting results back. Waiting on ours 52 hour mark now and will expire tomorrow at 4pm. Hitting the road tomorrow morning hopefully we get email soon!!
6589210,Eckohlt,2021-08-11 19:03:00,3685,"Major problem,good luck"
