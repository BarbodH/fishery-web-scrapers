6589750,fishnfood,2021-08-12 20:00:00,94,"Has anyone filled out the quarantine plan and not had an address to put down? We camp on crown land and if needed will drive out to cell service but I'm wondering about needing an address for the plan? I'm not sure ""middle of nowhere"" would suffice."
6589782,drlee,2021-08-12 21:11:00,409,"Our camp is drive in, but remote. We are near Ignace, ON. So I use the Northwoods Motor Inn, old highway 17, Ignace, Ontario P0T 1T0. I would likely quarantine right in camp, but this motel would be an option. Not at all likely I would need to take that action. The app accepted this entry."
6589784,drlee,2021-08-12 21:12:00,409,Est
6589814,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 05:13:00,3685,Will the app take the name of the resort a person is going to?it's remote
6589816,BreezyPoint,2021-08-13 05:30:00,1581,"The app does not ask for a name, just an address.Frank"
6589818,kettyspanky,2021-08-13 05:31:00,271,It wanted a address. If I was you I would put the address from their office or main lodge. Good luck.
6589820,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 05:42:00,3685,Would the address of the motel we stay at the night before work?thanks for any reply.
6589822,BreezyPoint,2021-08-13 05:49:00,1581,It just needs to be an address that the app can see as valid. A motel or hotel address would work.Frank
6589854,fishnfood,2021-08-13 07:24:00,94,"Thanks for this reply. It makes me feel better. No one at the arrivecan number really had an idea or a suggestion. I'm sure they are being very careful as to what is being recommend to those crossing the border. It would be nice if we could see the entire process before actually having to fill it in. I haven't found that site yet and one of the folks I talked to warned against multiple entries in a short period of time. Stating it may get a person ""red flagged"" at the border."
6589988,BreezyPoint,2021-08-13 13:41:00,1581,You can go through most of the process now you just can't complete the last step until it is less than 72 hours to your crossing. So practice all you want. You will just have to start over each time.Frank
6589094,hoppy63,2021-08-11 11:41:00,367,FWIW my conversation with the border agent she told me they want you to cross the border within 10-15 minutes of the time you put on ArrivCan. She said to redo it if you are gonna be delayed by more than that. Not sure if that has been an issue with anyone and I've seen no responses since I posted that.
6589098,cphilli5199,2021-08-11 11:44:00,5,Is Pigeon River crossing CST or EST. I know it is right on the boundary.
6589102,phishfearme,2021-08-11 12:09:00,1242,see below - says it's eastern time zone - and MN is centralhttps://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/@6104458
6589108,cphilli5199,2021-08-11 12:38:00,5,Thank you. hoppy63 has me thinking about the importance of an accurate crossing time and this could cause us to be an hour off!!!!
6589182,kettyspanky,2021-08-11 18:09:00,271,I talked with my resort owner today on this subject. He said he was off on time by a couple hours and they never said a word. Maybe because he is a business owner they don't care that much. I'm crossing at pigeon river and was worried about the time to put on arrivecan also. I guess I'll put down a time and be there before that.
6589190,Eckohlt,2021-08-11 18:28:00,3685,Does arrive can choose who wins the lottery for test??
6589224,fiftyincher,2021-08-11 19:18:00,309,"Did you get and I or a V for the confirmation? My dad got an I, brother and I both got a V"
6589262,kettyspanky,2021-08-11 19:53:00,271,I'm guessing all those people that were in line on sunday night and monday had to be off on their time. Unless they redid it when they were in line. No service at pigeon river so I can't redo when I'm in line. I'm putting a time down and hopefully I'm there at the right time. Good luck to all.
6589306,BreezyPoint,2021-08-11 21:10:00,1581,I really doubt they care about the actual time. My guess is they use your estimated time for workload planning.Frank
6589380,Eckohlt,2021-08-12 06:43:00,3685,Frank aren't you suppose to be out fishing?
6588976,hoppy63,2021-08-11 07:04:00,367,"So we have our negative covid test results and I filled out the ArrivCan with the two of us traveling together and when I submitted it and got my email receipt, after my name there is an (I) after it and says immunized. After my partners name there is a (V) and says ""Vaccination document Please speak with a Canada Border Services Officer on arrival"". I uploaded both of our vaccine cards the same on my phone, I'm not sure what the issue is. Has anyone else ran across this? Also I called the border services where we will be crossing before I submitted my ArrivCan because I was curious about the date and time you will be crossing section and asked how close the time you get to the border has to be to the time you enter on ArrivCan, thinking it would be within a couple hours and the agent told me 10-15 minutes. Curious of any others experience that have crossed and how your times compared. She said if you are going to be 30 minutes late or so you would have to re-submit ArrivCan"
6589008,fiftyincher,2021-08-11 08:43:00,309,I have a V next to mine. Did you have J&J shot or 2 shot? My thought was the pic I submitted was the same from both doses
6589012,hoppy63,2021-08-11 08:50:00,367,"Our vaccines were the same Moderna and from same location even. I called the number for ArrivCan support and she told me it was probably because when I took the picture to upload it, it did not scan properly and they just want to see the card to verify it. And the pics I submitted for both doses are the same because the info is on the same side of the same card. I appreciate your response....thank you."
6589014,fiftyincher,2021-08-11 08:52:00,309,Just found this - https://www.canada.ca/en/public-heal...ecan/help.html Towards bottom it says V is for fully vaccinated
6589018,cphilli5199,2021-08-11 09:01:00,5,"Questions regarding ArriveCAN 1. If you fill out on a computer will the information carry over to the app on the iPhone? 2. If you fill out on the iPhone only, do you have the option to print the receipt or is this option only available from a computer?"
6589024,fiftyincher,2021-08-11 09:07:00,309,No idea on first one but a receipt shows up in the app and gets emailed to you
6589032,cphilli5199,2021-08-11 09:19:00,5,Thank you for the feedback
6589036,hoppy63,2021-08-11 09:24:00,367,I am not 100% sure but I believe regardless of where you register...online or on app you will be able to sign in and access it either place but I believe if you start filling it out on the app you must complete it on app and same for website.
6589058,djk50164,2021-08-11 10:12:00,370,If you start filling it out on one or the other it has to be completed on that device. Once it is complete on either it will show up on both. Let's say you started it in the app but you want to finish it via online you can delete the entry from the app and do it on the online
6589088,Carnhzkr,2021-08-11 11:25:00,964,"I received my test results this morning and will be crossing the border on Friday with a group of six. We'll have three people in each of two vehicles. This morning, I submitted my info via ArriveCan and after doing so, I began to have second thoughts about what I had done. I'm thinking that it would be much better to include all travelers riding in the same vehicle on a single submission, rather than, in our case, have six individual submissions. I don't know this, but I'll bet that each ArriveCan submission, whether it be for one or three people, has the same chance of winning the random test lottery. So if all six individuals submitted their own info, that's six lottery tickets as opposed to two (3 people in two vehicles). I do see that I can delete my previous submission and redo it. The email I received states that the most recent submission will be the one that is used. Anyway, that's my thought."
6588094,hoppy63,2021-08-09 06:22:00,367,I know there are already threads or at least a thread on this topic but there was one thread where one of the members stated that they had just completed the ArrivCan and it was about a ten minute process. The member also stated he would help if anyone needed it. I can't find that particular thread nor do I remember which member it was....maybe Obabikon???? At any rate we will be getting our covid test today and then trying to fill out the ArrivCan info. Can you fill out the info before you have your test results? Also I will be traveling with 1 other person. Is his name to be put on my info in the quarantine portion and mine on his since we are traveling together? Also anyone that might be willing to help walk through the process if needed would be appreciated. Hate to get nixed at the border over my ignorance or misunderstanding on a part of the questions. Thanks for any help.
6588144,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-09 07:39:00,88,"You can fill all of the info out before you test, just don't hit submit at the end before you are ready. The app just asks if you have a negative test within the last 72 hours. No place to upload the test results, just make sure you have copies of the negative test results with you. I believe that both of your info could be entered into one phone, especially if you are riding together. Safe travels. If you need any help let me know."
6588176,fishingfever,2021-08-09 08:24:00,85,Question about filiing out the ArriveCan app- if you fill it out on your computer do you get something to print out or do you need to download something to your phone to have at the border? Thanks in advance for your help.
6588188,BuckeyeATC,2021-08-09 09:06:00,88,"I would assume so. But I can't say for certain, as I did ours on the phone app."
6588226,hoppy63,2021-08-09 10:21:00,367,So you are thinking we only have to fill out ArrivCan once for two of us traveling together??? Is this correct and can anyone confirm? Also what do you put for quarantine plan? When I put return home it does not give the United States as on option?
6588230,x4flatfish,2021-08-09 10:27:00,319,"Just did mine on my laptop. You will get a receipt when you finish to print and present at the border. Now my question, someone said you could save your info. Did not see that option. I did mine however used the wrong date as you have to be in the 72 hour window to fill it out. I now will need to edit my entry to change the date. Don't see that option. Any help here?Yes you can use 1 ap for 2 people...just did it. Quarantine is your camps address"
6588234,hoppy63,2021-08-09 10:32:00,367,I did not see how to save it on the computer but it does save it on my app on my phone. What did you use for quarantine plan?
6588242,x4flatfish,2021-08-09 10:44:00,319,your camps address
6588244,hoppy63,2021-08-09 11:13:00,367,"Thank you, and do you or anyone know if two of us can be on one ArrivCan? The way I'm reading it is if all adults are fully vaccinated they can all be on one arrivcan and you will be able to get the golden ticket (receipt) you need to provide to the border agents."
6588268,x4flatfish,2021-08-09 12:11:00,319,asked and answered above...yes you can do 2 or more on 1 just start filling it out and you will see how to do it
