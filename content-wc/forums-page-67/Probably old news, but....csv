6589186,Pooch,2021-08-11 18:18:00,4618,Went to my Arrivecan app this afternoon and it automatically updated itself when I gave it permission. Can't finish registering until next week. Bobo from here on WC showed me that I can also put my (even less tech oriented than myself) traveling partner on the same app. That was mentioned earlier by someone here on WC. Just a passing thought. Pooch
