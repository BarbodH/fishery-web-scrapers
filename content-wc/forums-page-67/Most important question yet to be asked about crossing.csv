If we get selected to test and are unable to complete at the border we have 48 hours. Technical video problems we can call and talk with a nurse who will walk us through it. 2. We are fairly remote, but a courier will pick tests up from lodge owner. You just need to call Health Canada and arrange it. 3. We can come home at any time and don't have to stay for the full 14 days. All in all it's a few extra steps to get back to what I love. Well worth it in my book."
