6590126,pjshorthorn,2021-08-14 07:27:00,5654,"So you are going to try and illegally bring crawlers into Canada and you have also ordered some in Canada. That is the most illogical thought process I've read in quite some time. If I was in your group and we got hung at the border based on your decision to bring crawlers, I'd be highly pizzed off. PjShorthorn"
6590134,Eckohlt,2021-08-14 07:57:00,3685,"Who said anything about bringing crawlers in?I said I already ordered them up there,wake up get some coffee in ya."
6590136,Juls,2021-08-14 08:09:00,13414,"What are you referring to, when you say ""soldiers""? I thought it meant you were bringing more crawlers with you too."
6590140,pjshorthorn,2021-08-14 08:35:00,5654,Ok then......you can frame it any way you want to because it is your party. PjShorthorn
6590150,Eckohlt,2021-08-14 09:34:00,3685,"I don't do I anything illegal up there ever,I'll leave that to others,and I would never put a trip in jeopardy,I'll report back to youwhen I return let you know how it went.I don't think crawlers and salty's are illegal,there just a big no no right now and I don't think people are getting fined if they have them,but I'm not totally sure about that,probably go back to usa to the bait dump."
6590466,prov1800,2021-08-15 14:42:00,5010,Just use the gullet.This bait business sounds like pain in a**.just stop at clarks in dryden and they'll bag your minnows in oxygen.Last you all week.
6589872,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 07:56:00,3685,All these hoops are giving me nightmares
6589892,MN_Moose,2021-08-13 08:46:00,964,"what I find ironic is that those crawlers (around here anyway) originated from a bait supply house in Canada. Up near Toronto if I remember correctly. And shipped to U.S. in soil, not bedding."
6589972,pjshorthorn,2021-08-13 12:52:00,5654,"Wait...what ? No more positivity from you ? I expected you to say that bait would be allowed no matter what this season...just bring it along boys, it won't be a problem . PjShorthorn"
6589976,pjshorthorn,2021-08-13 13:00:00,5654,It has been that way for as long as I can remember going back to 1996. I specifically remember a gal having to hand sort crawlers out of Canadian dirt and put it in bedding while we waited. She was not a happy person at the beginning of the season. I can't imagine what her demeanor was like after about a month of doing that. I guess it is moot point now. PjShorthorn
6589996,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 14:34:00,3685,"Pj your right I'm bringing a sht load of bait,I need lots of fire power,I'm going to try and get it through,see if the bait can get through the hoops."
6590000,fishnfood,2021-08-13 14:49:00,94,"For thirty plus years our group has been fortunate enough to make memories enjoying another countries wilderness. Along the way fees have increased, new permits have been purchased and costs have risen. So what? In the scheme of things it's a a small price to pay. Of the regulars there are only two of us left. At 60 I'm the youngest by far and already planning trips alone when it's the only way I can go. In August of 2018, 150 KM into what is true wilderness, and after decades of trips, my companion looked at me and said, ""How lucky we have been all these years that Canada has allowed us to use this land."" Little did we know that 2020 would be the first year missed in decades. The moral of the story here is ...... Quit complaining and stay at home if you don't like it."
6590006,pjshorthorn,2021-08-13 15:10:00,5654,Sounds like a very solid plan for you having to walk or drive back to the US in order to get rid of your investment. Best of luck on your plan. PjShorthorn
6590008,Eckohlt,2021-08-13 15:34:00,3685,"Think positive,no investment I'll pick up the others have dumped freebies"
6590082,pjshorthorn,2021-08-13 21:56:00,5654,Think about your logic for a hot minute and get back to everyone on what you have concluded. PjShorthorn
6590092,Eckohlt,2021-08-14 03:40:00,3685,"I already have crawlers ordered up there,but the other soldiers are going in with me and lots of them,,,concluded"
6585272,MN_Moose,2021-08-01 08:22:00,964,Probably correct. The ban is a Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) rulehttps://inspection.canada.ca/plant-h.../1590683262739
6585286,Eckohlt,2021-08-01 08:44:00,3685,Won't be long and something will be pulling our lines.
6586098,C182P,2021-08-03 10:34:00,59,"Interesting its a food ban? The customs agent in the Fort yesterday told me the new reg was MNR and she said expect it to be permanent. However the agents may not always be well versed on where the laws originate, just that they need to enforce them."
6586148,Wallychowder,2021-08-03 11:44:00,1567,Doesn't surprise me ! Probably dont pay em enough to know everything....hence strike !
6589042,valley366,2021-08-11 09:32:00,193,Bumping this to top as there were conversations in other threads asking questions.
6589044,troutwater,2021-08-11 09:35:00,299,"Good call, I was asked twice yesterday at Rainy River about bait. He specifically asked about crawlers and salted minnows after I said no to frozen or live bait."
6589512,fishnfood,2021-08-12 11:18:00,94,Did they mention salted minnows? We talked to the Ontario Ministry last Friday and they said salted were OK this year.
6589672,valley366,2021-08-12 17:57:00,193,This was off the Sunset Country post. I also saw it in several of the releases when they announced the border opening.you cannot bring frozen or any kind of bait - including nightcrawlers - into Canada from the USA in 2021. This measure was put in place for 2021 to help avoid the potentially longer than usual wait times anticipated with the covid-19 screening of travelers.https://visitsunsetcountry.com/bait-...DyiRs.facebook
6589704,Eckohlt,2021-08-12 18:25:00,3685,Gonna be a lot of duty free crawlers at the border next spring.
6589834,Wallychowder,2021-08-13 06:05:00,1567,"i talked to a gal at the Canadian soil place (or whatever they call it) just to get a little insight on this BS. she said if a person wants to take live bait into CANADA they have to apply for this ""permit"" to possess bait. $39.00 she basically told ""more hoops to jump through"" I have no problem buying crawlers up there ! Just kind of odd that the 30 years I've been going, and now all of a sudden a promlem ? Oh and by the way the permit is good for 3 years ! Kind of like the outdoor card &#x1f923;"
6584856,@Lunker,2021-07-30 15:33:00,835,Should have read more thoroughly to begin with Is this old news and I missed it or new news? https://visitsunsetcountry.com/bait-...DyiRs.facebook
6584890,Bill Krejca,2021-07-30 17:24:00,6107,"Old news/continuing variable outcome news. Seems like depending upon whom one ""talks"" with, dead bait and crawlers are either allowed or not allowed. There are several earlier threads on this here on WC. The article referenced states rule is effected due to attenpt to smooth the crossing procedure. If effected, the ""temporary"" rule may(?) stay in effect, just the way stuff works, my opinion, I imagine the bait dealers would be in favor! Not to be putting down the bait dealers, they have had a tough enough time, along with the camps, in trying to survive the plunge in business. I normally do not use either live or dead bait, so any restrictions do not effect me. Just sharing my thoughts. Bill"
6585122,Donscs,2021-07-31 16:21:00,379,I wish there was a Canadian bait shop on my way when I fish in Canada. Fish Lake St. Clair so unless somebody puts a floating bait shop in the middle of the lake I'm out of luck. And before you ask it would add at least an hour to an hour and a half by water on the way out to try and find a bait shop in a marina on the Canadian side. Wouldn't matter anyway because I think the border opening (such as it is) does not apply to crossing by water. Heck we can't even cross the border to fish even if we don't touch land. Donscs
6585174,Half oz jig,2021-07-31 21:44:00,4,"Apparently it is a temporary measure, but no bait of any kind is allowed imported in at this time.https://www.noto.ca/news/a-notice-from-cbsa-on-baitI tried to find something on the CBSA site with no luck.Guess it would be best to call ahead and pre order your bait, frozen or live with your outfitters or bait shop en route on the Canadian side."
6585198,bradsto,2021-08-01 06:05:00,4,called the entry at pembina friday and was told we can still bring in crawlers as long as they are in worm bedding
6585202,Eckohlt,2021-08-01 06:15:00,3685,Wonder why they would let crawlers in at pembina and not the other entry points?are all entry point different as far as regulations.confusing!
6585208,Wallychowder,2021-08-01 06:27:00,1567,I think somebody's pulling our legs !
6585228,MN_Moose,2021-08-01 07:06:00,964,Pembina border crossing goes into Manitoba. The live bait ban pertains to Ontario
6585234,Wallychowder,2021-08-01 07:14:00,1567,I think it pertains to all of canada ?
6585248,ILScott,2021-08-01 07:33:00,139,Read on a resort facebook page that no bait is allowed in this year. If you are going to Red Lake area I have always ordered nightcrawlers from Dutchies. Support the small business they have been great to work with.
