6611880,Wawajake,2021-11-20 16:23:00,413,"I hunt deer on my homestead property here, and also use the side by side for bushroad exploring with relatives and partridge hunting. Ice fishing I limit now to just when we go to sister inlaws waterfront home so we have easy access to hot food, beer and deep fryer for the walleye or lake trout. Nice diversion for winter months."

I still have a love for deer hunting but the main reason that I still hunt deer is my oldest son and his wife hunts with me. the times we spend together at the end of the day are priceless. don't get me wrong I still love my alone time in a tree. It's the company while on stand that keeps me going back, LOL. just kidding, it's the quality time with my oldest son that keeps me going back. i still love fishing but ever since my little brother died I have had a very hard time finding the get-up and go to make myself go. I do still do a one-week trip to Erie and do a little pond fishing with my granddaughter. I was spending the month of February in fl staying with my sister and her husband. but they moved to tn. my brother n law and I made one trip down and stayed with a nephew the 1st yr after they moved but I'm just too old for spending a month sleeping on a rough couch."

6609084,RMBin303,2021-11-10 19:07:00,927,"If I had to only choose one trip - hunting or fishing - it would be our annual opening weekend South Dakota pheasant hunt. Everything else is a distant second. It’s not just the hunting. It’s the entire experience. Friends I see once a year. Lots of birds. And stellar dog work. This year I’m on IR with a arm injury, but it still may have been the best trip yet."
6609118,kswalleyer,2021-11-11 05:34:00,1651,"I hunt but not nearly as hard as I used to...waterfowl, upland, big game (bow, rifle) all of it. i shoot/reload quite a bit as well. I am a multispecies guy and I ice fish. I fish 10 month of the year, hunt the other 2. Used to ski and still would if I could talk my wife into it. I have always just loved to be outside in a lot of different ways."
6609122,last chance,2021-11-11 05:49:00,3262,"if I hit the lottery I would fish for 10 months and take 2 months off to hunt. as my wife gave up fishing yrs ago and doesn't hunt. I would buy a satellite phone so she could call me anytime. I would only hunt big game such as elk, moose, buffalo, and deer. but would fish for anything larger than a snapper in the Bahamas to a halibut in Alaska"
6609132,prov1800,2021-11-11 06:14:00,5010,Living in NWO its part of our life style to hunt and fish.Seems like most of my time is spent fishing.Just recently boat my boat away and started deer hunting.Love the meat but love the hunting more so don't shoot anything for a while.Just take in the whole scenario since we have a long season here till Dec 15th.By then we will have good ice and will switch gears to ice fishing till ice out.Always something to look forward to.
6609136,RichA$1970,2021-11-11 06:27:00,1159,"I used to deer hunt hard (one season 88 days in a stand) as it’s one of the few perks of living in Illinois and on our farm we have 77 stands now. I love sitting out in the stand and seeing the nature alone but now I’d take a week or 2 fishing in Canada any day because:1) Getting to the stand in the dark & walking the ridges & bluffs is not so easy as when I was in my 20’s. 2) Hauling a deer out, getting on a quad, gutting, skinning and butchering is 3 hours minimum vs 15-20 minutes cleaning fish3) You can throw fish back if you don’t want them4) good and bad but usually you are not alone and can shoot the sh*t with a buddy in a boat5) Sitting in a stand when it’s cold is almost like flying coach to Asia, not the most comfortable seat to sit in for 12 hours. 6) Bushhogging, maintaining logging roads & other maintenance on the farm is never ending. I still hunt and enjoy it, but the trips to Canada are more of a vacation to me"
6609240,Timmer92,2021-11-11 15:36:00,451,I don't want to hijack the original post but great picture. My last dog was a Weim. He was not only a fantastic hunter but one of the most fun dogs I've owned. If you ever need another hunting buddy in SD.....

He built 80 feet high...he needed to go over a 100 but the feds stepped in). The other day, a local suggested using it as a deer stand.....I've got 6 acres....maybe I can rent it out!"

I use to do all the stuff you mention but age has got the better of me. we never had a quad because I've only hunted public land. butchered my 1st deer, since then I've had mine done but I've spent 3 hours dragging deer out. and I've never been able to clean fish that fast. I have thrown back a lot of shorts. I love the solitude of hunting then talking about our day when it's over. being on stand-alone is what hunting is all about. I love sitting on my stand but I'm 70 now and don't know how much longer I'll be able to use my climber. I love it, even more, when we have snow on the ground and even better if it's snowing. I never have to maintain any property as I've been deer hunting public land since 81."
6610816,Husker525,2021-11-17 15:42:00,720,"20 years ago, I was 70% hunting and 30% fishing. Now I am 95% fishing, and 5% hunting. I lost my desire to hunt for some reason when I came back from Asscrapistan. I still like to shoot, just no desire to actually hunt. Fishing is somewhat cheaper than hunting, and slightly safer then going into the Rocky Mountains with 1000 hunters all very anxious to shoot at something, even if they are all dressed in blaze orange. I am not anti hunter, I am just lazy and don't have the personal desire. With that being said, my wife, who has NEVER hunted, is all about getting into it. She got to experience the 1st day of deer season in Nebraska last weekend, while we were stopped at a cafe from Walleye fishing. She was talking all the hunters with fresh deer in their pickups to letting her touch the eyeballs, their tongues hanging out, and sticking her finger into the GSW's. I would not mind going with her to let her shoot a deer or antelope, but she has no idea how much work it can be after the trigger is pulled. She has me putting a winch system in our Nebraska garage so we can some day winch a deer out of the back of our truck. 30 minutes to clean fish or 4 hours cutting up and processing a deer, hmmmmm. I will take fish. LOL"
6607936,mms3rd,2021-11-05 08:54:00,148,"A lot of resorts/camps are switching over from fishing to hunting. I'm really curious about this. I love fishing...can't think of much I'd rather do. I have absolutely no interest in hunting and, maybe (sorry), a bit of a negative attitude about it. My point is not to argue about that. I'm curious about whether the fishermen on this board are also into hunting.....and compared to their interest in fishing. I guess a related question, sort of, is how many open water fishermen continue with ice fishing. I ice fished as a kid, but haven't for many years. Thanks....too much time on my hands Mike"
6607972,Timmer92,2021-11-05 10:26:00,451,"I enjoy hunting more than fishing, but do way more fishing. I don't have to travel far to fish and it is a much longer season, so there is far more opportunity. This is especially true given busy family life. Sadly, I haven't ice fished in probably 3-4 years now due to having 3 kids in winter sports. The kids won't be around forever so I hope to get back into it."
6607974,7 Mag,2021-11-05 10:27:00,1887,"I do both hunting and fishing. Before i turned 55 it was 75% hunting 25% fishing, now that i'm over 60 it's 90% fishing 10% hunting & i do not ice fish at all."
6608154,Richard B,2021-11-05 17:53:00,735,"When I was younger I would hunt every weekend and holiday from September 1st through January 31st for everything from dove to deer to ducks to rabbits to pheasant. I loved it. Around 60, and my dog dying, that all stopped. I would fish a lot but it wasn't every weekend. I used to love wading in streams using 4 pound test and baby rebel crankbaits or roaster tails. I still fish but only occasionally. I used to ice fish but never really enjoyed it."

6608240,last chance,2021-11-06 06:17:00,3262,"when I was a little younger I hunted bow, gun, and the muzzleloader season and loved them all. I fished every chance I got from wi to fl and a lot of places in between. I fished the Intracoastal and the big water in fl. I fished for anything and everything that wanted my bait. I have fished for and caught sharks in the keys. I salmon fished wi and mi with great success in mi. and I loved every type of fishing I did. now that I'm older and all my old hunting and fishing buddies have died and my health isn't what it use to be I hunt our muzzleloader season with my son and his wife unless my son gets a deer early then were done. I'm just not able to drag a deer out anymore. but I would hunt more if I had someone to hunt with that wouldn't mind dragging my deer out. as for fishing, I have big plans in winter but they just never happen when summer gets here. i do very little bass fishing in ponds with my granddaughters. I do a little pond fishing with my nephew when I make a trip to tn to visit family and to fish with him.. the highlight of my year is our 1 week trip to Erie in July with my oldest son and his wife. if I had to give up hunting or fishing it would probably be hunting., as hunting is loved by me because I get to spend some alone time with just my son and his wife. but our week up on Erie I get to spend more time with them together out on the boat and still get to go in and spend time with the wife. and I don't have to go home like we do if he gets his deer. hunting consists of 3 weekends if my son goes dry until the 3rd weekend. I still love and enjoy hunting and fishing I'm just not able to do either that much. i did have another great fishing trip to fl when my younger sister and her husband lived down there. for the last few yrs, they lived down there. I spent the month of February down there fishing the Intracoastal for black drum, redfish, and grouper. but we caught everything including a lamprey eel that he caught,"
6608454,Obabikon,2021-11-07 06:47:00,2370,"At the resort, we do duck and grouse hunting... but personally, I have no interest in it. If I am going to shoot for fun, I'd rather shoot clays with some friends. Fishing soft water... that's what I was made for. Ice fishing is staring at a hole for hours. I would rather be snowmobiling at that point. Floating in a boat in the middle of nowhere is as good as life gets!"

I love hunting and fishing but having others that feel the same way that makes it priceless. I did ice fish for a few yrs with my best friend. but after he moved to tn and we had a couple of mild winters that I didn't fish I just never started back. I did catch my 1st walleye through a hole in the ice. it was 29 1/2"" and was 9 1/2 lbs. and I've caught thousands since but not ice fishing."

My dad started me out at 5 on Lac Suel fishing, and on the lake front here chasing perch and salmon. I took my first deer, duck and goose at 9 so it's been a life long passion both fishing and hunting.I will fish from open water till freeze up if possible, but once October rolls around I'm chasing deer or waterfowl as often as I can. I do not ice fish... it is very difficult to cut a whole big enough to troll in...."
6609048,stjoeguy,2021-11-10 13:38:00,979,"Mike, no need to apologize for wasting time starting a W/C post. What do you think the rest of us are doing responding to your post? I've never hunted. I wasn't raised hunting and never had friends that were big into hunting, so that pretty much kept me out of it. Being a member of Walleye Central says that I like fishing and responding to your post in the Canada section also indicates my preference for Canada. We used to weekend at the cabin and I fished a lot. Since retiring and living at the lake year round I really only fish my MN lake when relatives are in town and want to go fishing. I'll fish early in the spring for crappies but that's about it. Canada has spoiled me so I get there as often as possible (three times this fall, but that was pushing the spousal limits). Ice fishing is fun, but I've gotten lazy there, too. I used to run around the lake, but as I've gotten older I enjoy going out to a heated day house in a bombardier or staying in a sleeper house. I haven't had the snowmobile or portable house out in several years and keep saying I should sell them. I do enjoy going to the ice show in St. Paul in December and making as many ice fishing trips as possible December through February. By March I'm done with winter and we usually go somewhere warm for a couple weeks."
