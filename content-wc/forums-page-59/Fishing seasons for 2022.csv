On the west end of Eagle Lake are the seasons? Smallmouth and largemouth bass year round? Northerns year round? Walleyes, 3rd Saturday in May? This differs a lot from Minnesota, yeah. Is that expected to be the same for 2022?"

6610694,Obabikon,2021-11-17 08:07:00,2370,"From my understanding, there will be no major changes next year."
6610736,v-bay gord,2021-11-17 11:19:00,3168,No changes that I've heard of. Specific to Eagle there are no largemouth. No season on the smallmouth but there is a time frame (spring) where the limit (if you wanted to keep some) was half and the fish have to be under 13 inches (approx)....basically protecting the spawning female fish.
