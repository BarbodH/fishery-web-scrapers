Don’t mess with your normal body shop supply like Napa, call a certified ppg paint supply with the ppg paint code # found online on the Crestliner site. Mine is storm blue and was very difficult to match !"
6607780,jambi,2021-11-04 14:09:00,504,I hear ya. We dont drive at much into the night any more. The drive up is full of energy the ride home is full of naps.
6607810,Cgillespie,2021-11-04 16:58:00,120,I’ve already booked a rental car in Winnipeg for mid-June. Going to book flights soon.
6608614,bthomas3333,2021-11-07 20:01:00,465,There have been a few times where getting to Red Lake demanded I fly. There is an option to fly from Winnipeg direct to Red Lake on Bear Skin Airlines. It isn't cheap but renting a car for a week and leaving it in RL isn't free either. Just another idea which wouldn't require a car. Fly to YWG then overnight. Grab the 6a out of Peg to Red Lake and take a taxi or have the outfitter give you a ride to the float base. Not the cheapest option but def the easiest and fastest. Brett
6608664,Cgillespie,2021-11-08 08:20:00,120,"I've done the math on that option, and it works out about the same as getting a rental car. Besides, my wife likes to stop at the tourist places in Kenora and I like to stop at the tackle stores. Renting a car gives us some freedom to do as we please. I kind of like the drive from Winnipeg as it transitions from prairie to the Canadian Shield."
6607606,NM_Trout,2021-11-03 17:44:00,1094,"I'm hearing that rental cars are a problem. I've got a trip planned / deposit in place for 2022 out of Red Lake, and I need to figure out if I'm flying to Winnipeg or International Falls. I really like INL, as I like the area and the town. My last trip through Winnipeg didn't leave a favorable impression. However, I think that there are more flight options from KC MO to Winnipeg than there are to INL, and given all the flight cancellations going on now I am a little spooked. Hmmmm..."
6607612,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-03 18:00:00,8293,"Check with the airport in I-Falls. They spent all summer working on the runway. I don't know if they added one, lengthened one or what they did. I know they worked on it all summer."
6607620,Eckohlt,2021-11-03 18:39:00,3685,Why can't you drive up to Ontario?
6607622,Yellowfin123,2021-11-03 18:42:00,2182,"denver is a big hub, why not shoot up the 25 to catch a plane vs kc"
6607638,NM_Trout,2021-11-03 20:12:00,1094,"I'm in New Mexico... my fishing buddy / daughter lives in KC MO, and her vacation time is thin. I'm flying to KC the day before, and we are re-packing gear to get things in a couple of bags (I cheat and use a golf club hard case). So we will depart KC for either INL or Winnipeg. I'm researching flights this weekend. Two or three trips ago, I had a flight get cancelled on me, and I ended up delaying my buddy who had flown into INL from Idaho. We ended up missing out on a day of fishing thanks to a flight cancellation, AND had to get an extra night of hotel room stay. I've learned to try and roll with the punches. But I like to avoid punches all together when I can :-)P.S. A 16 hour drive to Red Lake one way would just be too much for the two of us. Especially on the way back."
6607680,Mojo-NC,2021-11-04 07:12:00,1929,"We've flown into both INL and Winnipeg. We loved going through customs at the airport in Winnipeg (YWG), but that's where the advantages end. Getting out of the city is a pain, and the drive to Ontario is boring. We prefer INL. We've also flown into MSP. The extra 5 hour drive is brutal on the way back considering we do the drive from Ear Falls to Minneapolis in a single day on our return. We've also flown into Duluth, but again, that adds 3 hours to the drive. Other than a bunch of flight changes on Delta from the time we book our flights until the time we actually leave, the flights have always gotten us there on Friday as planned. One word of advice, link your flights together at the time of booking. Otherwise, they may move someone from your group to a different flight. We've spent hours on the phone fixing the mess that Delta created with flight changes. If you link your flights, if they move one they move all. We usually rent our vehicles from Wherley Motors in INL. They are pretty good about getting us a large vehicle like a 4-door truck. We have lots of gear, so getting everything 4 guys need for the week into even a large a car is not an option. We've only done spring and fall trips, so all of our experience is June and September. This coming year we will be going up in early July, so we'll see then if that changes anything."
6607682,Larry S,2021-11-04 07:31:00,665,"Since 1998 I have lived in Las Vegas Area and have flown into Winnipeg & Thunder Bay many times. I prefer Winnipeg because I can fly straight into it. Thunder Bay requires a stop in Toronto. I can also get a good to great price on a rental car from Costco Travel This year my sister & I flew into Duluth and drove into Canada because a Covid Test was Required to Come back into USA Flying. No test was necessary returning to USA driving. It was a bit longer trip, but since we had booked a trip with Mattice outfitters out of Armstrong the driving along Lake Superior was scenic Next year our first fly-in trip out of 3 we are going on is with Clarks out of Vermillion Bay area so we will fly into Winnipeg and drive there I did drive several times to Canada from Henderson, Nevada over the years, but its really Too Far a 2 1/2 day drive with 2 stops for motels. I use to always drive to the Kenora area of Canada, where I had a friend who owned a fishing camp from the Chicago Area when I lived in Chicago . Drove straight thru all night, but stopped the night driving when I hit a moose in 1991 Never flew to INL Take Care whatever you decide Stay Safe Larry Schroeder Henderson Nevada"
6607690,NM_Trout,2021-11-04 07:45:00,1094,"Thank you. Good perspectives here. Another benefit to INL is that we usually get our groceries on the US side. I noted that many of our brand preferences disappear on the other side of the border, and having some of those creature comforts does make a difference.My impression of Winnipeg was similar. The drive east from there is bland and a bit of a pain. We always spend one night at the end of the trip in a hotel before flying home, and I just don't care for Winnipeg. I think I'm leaning towards INL at this point, I just want to make sure that Delta doesn't pull the rug out from under us. I can put up with Winnipeg in exchange for getting me there on the day I need to get there. We normally fly in on a Friday, and arrive late-ish. Do some dry grocery shopping that night, then get produce and meat and drive up on Saturday. We take our time and geocache along the way or just goof off in general. Then spend one night in Red Lake, and be at the plane dock at 5am. Our host (Loon Haunt) has been good to us in the past too, and has let us know if the outpost we are going to is empty. They have offered to fly us out the day before for no charge. It depends on plane schedule and other factors of course. But how do you say no to that?"
6607716,jambi,2021-11-04 10:19:00,504,"We drive up from Tulsa to Ear Falls, about 4 hrs longer than from KC. All of the hassles of flying/transfers/gear/food gathering aren't worth it to us. We split drive up and the drive home so really not any same time difference that what you are describing."
6607730,NM_Trout,2021-11-04 10:57:00,1094,"Yeah, just two of us though. I think if we had 3 or 4 in the party it would make a lot of sense. For me, the car travel is a lot more hassle and the flight cost can be a pain. But I pay for the flights with points so it is not too bad."
