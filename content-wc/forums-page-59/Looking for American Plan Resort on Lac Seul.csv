6607816,Ronr81!,2021-11-04 17:24:00,15,"Has anyone stayed at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul? Would be interested in your opinions of the lodge. Also, is the Lost Island area of the lake better/same/not as good as the Ear Falls area? Looking to go late June. Thank you"
6608008,fishman10,2021-11-05 12:37:00,226,"I have stayed there twice. Great lodge and great area.I fished within a few miles of the lodge with great success. In many cases within several hundred meters of the lodge.And in a 14 foot boat, quite a few fish in the 24-26 inch mark.They requested a phone call when getting close to the boat launch, we were met at the dock by camp staff, our vehicles were driven to a secure area, and they helped us get our gear to the lodge and right to the door of our cabin.Fuel and bait was available, clean comfortable cabin!Very happy there!"
6608686,eyecatcher1,2021-11-08 10:38:00,323,Just an FYI: A few years ago at the Minneapolis Sportshow I checked out a resort on Eagle Lake. I asked the guy how Eagle compared to Lac Seul. He said that it wasn't fair to compare every lake in NW Ontario to Lac Seul. I took it that he thought the Lac Seul was a better lake and am still going there. We've been going to Lac Seul for 27 years now.
6608690,prov1800,2021-11-08 11:16:00,5010,"You know I fish many lakes and I like them all.Each has its own thing going.As far as Eagle goes its hard to beat.Has it all.Diffenatly the nicest shoreline and has the most islands.Its big also and can churn up like Lac Suel does.I hate wind.Eagle will give up bigger fish than Lac Suel to.They both will get you the same amount of fish in a day.just you will catch smaller fish on average but still lots of slot fish with are 18-23"" so not that bad.Some guys like big fish like most guts me included and if i fish either lake ill get them but chances of 30"" walleyes are better on eagle or bigger.Each guy has diff views of what they want.When I guide my job is to put fish in the boat and I have happy fisherman.Bigger fish need diff tactics and diff spots.Average fish are always easy to come by.Less known lakes I fish have 30"" walleyes also and better chance to catch them.Not all about BIG lakes.lol."
6608742,eyecatcher1,2021-11-08 15:16:00,323,"I agree on the wind. I'd rather fish in rain or snow than wind. About 20 years ago a friend and his wife were on Eagle. Fishing was slow, so they went looking for a private spot to skinny dip. As they pulled into a secluded bay my friend caught a 12 pound walleye. I've never caught one that big on Lac Seul. All of mine over 12 have been on the Rainy River."
6608744,Eckohlt,2021-11-08 15:37:00,3685,What's the name of the secluded bay?is it still being used as clothing optional?
6608746,eyecatcher1,2021-11-08 15:41:00,323,I don't know. He said that there was a stream on an island that led back into a secluded bay. I think that he was staying at Temple Bay Resort. Maybe near there?
6597094,kayakmatt,2021-09-14 18:25:00,105,"Wife and I have been flying up to LOW Crow Rock Lodge in June for several years. Looking to change things up to someplace more remote. Never been to Lac Seul. We like to catch walleye, then smallies and pike in the afternoon. I am finding only two American Plan lodges... Lost Island and Silver Water Wheel (full guided and too pricey for us).We would need / like:American PlanDecent flat floor boat 30+ HPPrefer boat in rather than Drive in lodgeAny other suggestions?If none, I will try Lost Island. It can be difficult to find a place in June for two people."
6597108,Pooch,2021-09-14 19:07:00,4618,Try Mahkwa. Pooch
6597120,x4flatfish,2021-09-14 19:24:00,319,Moosehorn and Andersons both have American Plan but are drive in. Lac Suel Outpost is boat in but don't think they have American Plan...check them out
6597126,prov1800,2021-09-14 20:04:00,5010,Not Lac Suel but as good.Eagle Lake.Check out Eagle Island lodge.Very nice place they pick you up and around 6 mile boat ride to camp.Awesome fishing very close to camp.Excellent smallmouth as well.
6597136,Riding high,2021-09-14 20:36:00,69,I don't do the American plan but I've stayed at whitewing resort up by earfalls and it was nice. They used to do American plan.

6598288,LoDo,2021-09-20 09:14:00,721,Onaway is as good as it gets on Lac Seul. Great location on the lake!!
6598304,prov1800,2021-09-20 09:50:00,5010,Agreed.No AP
6598374,prov1800,2021-09-20 15:27:00,5010,Another suggestion is Cedar Point Resort on Cedar Lake.Has the fish your looking for and the boat and does the AP.Fishing is awesome and dont have to boat far.
