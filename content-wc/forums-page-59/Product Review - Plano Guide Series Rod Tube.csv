6609408,HeHooksHimself,2021-11-12 08:30:00,725,"Andrew, I don't mean to hijack this thread, but this post brings to mind the argument for one piece rods. We have one guy in our group who insists that one piece rods are worth the hassle of trying to fit an 8 foot tube into our transportation vehicles. I think his argument is that he has a better feel with a one piece rod. I haven't really had any issues with my mid priced two piece rods, which are walleye angler rods from Bass Pro. Why did you switch to one piece rods? Is it worth it to try to fit 8' of tube into tight spaces? Fish On! Hooks"

Having ten guys bring rod carriers is crazy for both commercial ( add 35$ apiece on some carriers, there and back) and then jamming in to a float plane, so we had one guy who is a skier and he had a a hard plastic ski carrier and we can get 30 rods in there and have never had a problem. We always have encourage 2 piece rods to keep the carrier in the short position"
6609520,gordy28,2021-11-12 12:52:00,437,"No worries and not a high jack! So I switched to 1 piece rods for feel - at the time the previaling wisdom was they were more sensitive and I really wanted that for a jigging rod. In terms of fitting the 8 foot tube into tight places so far it hasnt been an issue and the tube does adjust so if your rods are only 6 6 the tube will only be a little over that. I will say that I have had a few people tell me that with some of the newer higher end 2 piece rods the difference is negligible - I just havent bought one yet lol. I will say my St Croix Avid one piece is way more sensistive than my Fenwick Eagle 2 piece but its not an apples to apples comparison as the Avid was more than 2X the priceQuote: Originally Posted by That Minnesota guyI just bought a piece of PVC tube, (1) screw on cap and (1) regular cap.

We always have encourage 2 piece rods to keep the carrier in the short positionIts a good call out - for Air Canada a tackle bag and a rod tube count as one piece of extra luggage - so we ended up putting 6 peoples rods into 3 rod tubes (6 per) and 6 peoples tackle into 3 large tackle bags - saved us some money - but again your idea sounds great as well Cheers Andrew"
6610120,NM_Trout,2021-11-15 08:55:00,1094,"I bought a rod tube years ago for my first outpost trip. A ginormous thing about 6"" in diameter that would expand out to 8' or so long. It counted as part of my luggage, so I ended up putting my rods in the center, and cramming socks and t-shirts around the edges. It was just too much of a pain. Since then, I have changed my packing strategy. I now use a hard sided golf case (most if not all airlines allow it without penalty, even though it is oversized). I don't take one piece rods any longer. The benefit is not worth the hassle. I take my rods, bundle them together so that no tips stick out (grips can stick out a little, but not tips), and I rubber band the whole thing together. Then I wrap them in aforementioned clothes, and put them in the hard case. We always re-pack the night before for the float plane, and I pull the rods out. Clothes go into stuff sacks, rods are left out with one layer of tshirts and rubber bands around them. At the dock, I hold the rods while gear is being loaded, and ask for the rods to go in last / on top. We've never had an issue, although I do know that it is more at risk. A 6"" diameter bundle of rods is actually pretty self-protected, and we don't purchase expensive rods. So far, so good. Knock on wood.BTW, I don't take a ton of gear with me. I pack jigs and plastic, spoons, and a few crank baits. For the few lures that I have not converted to single hook, I use treble hook guards and they go into nylon bags. We travel pretty light."
6610288,Mojo-NC,2021-11-15 19:26:00,1929,"We have to fly up to either MN or Canada for all of our Canada trips. I don't own any 2-piece rods and I prefer not to have to buy additional rods specifically for use only in Canada. I purchased this rod holder for such trips. I'm not saying this is the way to go for everyone, but it certainly works for me (us).https://www.amazon.com/Flambeau-Outd.../dp/B000EDVT30 We bring 4-6 rods per person on each trip and we can get rods for 4 guys into a single rod holder. Knock on wood, we have not had any airline/transportation damage on any of our rods to date over almost 20 years. Well, not due to transportation anyway, but that would be a story or two for another string. We've broken and lost a few for other reasons. Yes, you do have to pay for an additional bag when transporting rods in these holders on airlines. However, they do allow you to tape 3 of these rod holders together and check them as a single bag. That's a lot of rods for approximately $10 per person. The cost is nothing compared to the overall cost of the trip and you get to fish with the combos that you are the most familiar with using on a regular basis. To me it is a no brainer. They can take a pretty good beating and survive."
6610380,prov1800,2021-11-16 06:57:00,5010,Nothing like a rod case to protect expensive rods.I have a old one at least 20 years old.Dont even know the name of it.Its been a great addition for some of our trips to multiple outposts for fishing and hunting with with Clarks and big trips to Florida and Alaska and British Columbia.Highly recommended

6612456,Cgillespie,2021-11-22 15:12:00,120,"I've got a real nice Plano case with a handle that holds rods up to 8' long. On my last trip, security in Atlanta held it back and it came in the day we flew out to the outpost camp. It and my rods spent all week in the Air Canada luggage office in the Winnipeg airport. I had to buy some new rods at Cabelas. The others in our group flew out of Memphis with same cases and had no problems. I've moved back to AR since then and I'm flying out of Memphis on Delta next year. I hope I don't have the same issue."
