6605156,prov1800,2021-10-22 15:14:00,5010,Fishing posts are just about done.Fishing not the only thing happening in NWO.So now that boat is tucked away I trade my fishing rods in for a shotgun.Still use a Remington 410 single shot.Bought it when i was 16 for 32 bucks.lol.Next week our deer season opens up and by time that's over we will have good ice.Went with a buddy the other day who raises and hunts with German wire haired pointers.We took them on a 7 mile hunt so they ran 14 miles plus both ways.Went through some awesome country only accessible by ATV. We rode in the comfort of a Honda sidexside but had to get out 50 times to check out the dogs when we heard beepers going and they barked when they treed a bird.Not easy getting to them at times. Was a amazing day.Saw a number of fresh moose tracks as well but we didn't have any moose tags this year.
