6612316,tparker,2021-11-22 07:44:00,100,"Sorry, that's across the Bridge in Fort Frances."
6612470,Joek3,2021-11-22 16:15:00,244,Hilltop Motel and Border bar has been our pattern for years. New owners at Hilltop. Very clean and very reasonable. New owners added some nice amenities this year.
6612498,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-22 17:44:00,8293,There were for sale signs up at Hilltop last time I went by.
6612876,Joek3,2021-11-23 19:41:00,244,Wow. Just stayed there in mid September and it was great.
6612886,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-23 20:35:00,8293,No tracks in the snow now so they are closed for the winter for sure. Hopefully new owners in the spring. Canadian resorts weren't the only ones hurt by the border closure.
6610836,Walleye2242,2021-11-17 16:46:00,263,"americinn is where we always stay. pool, bar and restaurant thats pretty good. Everything you need right there. plenty of parking."
6610976,tparker,2021-11-18 07:43:00,100,"We've been staying at the Copper River Inn the last few years. Nice rooms, and the bar and restaraunt were great in pre-Covid times. No bar or restaraunt this year due to Covid."
6610984,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-18 07:58:00,8293,There is no Copper River Inn in International Falls.
6611046,pjshorthorn,2021-11-18 11:05:00,5654,"I heard the pancakes are a bit dry, but the conversation and humor is very good. PjShorthorn"
6611048,pjshorthorn,2021-11-18 11:12:00,5654,"We could renovate the horse barn.....four beds in the hay loft and 4 in the stalls. With marketing, it would be a slam dunk and an aroma to look forward to. You could even sell maps to the guests on how to get to the border from the ranch......so many possibilities. I'll come up with a plan for ya... PjShorthorn"
6611070,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-18 13:52:00,8293,"Yaks, I need Yaks !! We will keep a stall downstairs for the Yaks. Maybe start some sort of riding academy. You might be onto something............"
6611336,nitroman,2021-11-19 07:47:00,368,"Thunderbird lodge east of IF. Nice rooms, good food, drinks and view! On the FF side we used to stay at LA PLACE RENDEZ-VOUS. What ever you choose start booking now as most hotels are close to if not booked for Friday nights in season. We cross and drive a bit further north to overnight Friday night as we found a great place right on a lake that's pretty cheap and has great views to wake up to!"
6611342,pjshorthorn,2021-11-19 08:01:00,5654,"I have Yaks. I might be able to wrangle a pair of Alpacas from the neighbor too. I'm thinking you could knit hats, mittens, scarves and sweaters during the winter. Guests would snap those up on opening week and early fall. Let me know if you want full size Yaks or the miniature versions for riding too. PjShorthorn"
6611446,v-bay gord,2021-11-19 12:32:00,3168,"Well, you'll finally have a use for the riding crop and crotchless chaps you've been bragging about for years..........."
6611702,pjshorthorn,2021-11-20 04:10:00,5654,You just had to go there.....you obviously don't realize that all chaps are crotchless and quite necessary when busting through a heavy bush. PjShorthorn
6610720,7 Mag,2021-11-17 10:35:00,1887,"I normally stay in Rice Lake but i want to get closer and stay in IF, has anyone stayed at the Days Inn, I'll have my boat with me and concerned there's enough parking?"
6610728,Yellowfin123,2021-11-17 10:50:00,2182,"not sure when your going but looks like theres a new big motel going up next to the chocolate moose, myself i always zoom in on google earth to check out the parking"
6610734,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-17 11:17:00,8293,"Plenty of parking. There is also a new Bestwestern? being built on the west end. Lots of guys also stay at the Falls Motel, it's a bit older but clean and you can back your trailer right up to your door."
6610788,7 Mag,2021-11-17 14:35:00,1887,"Thanks MG, i forgot about the Falls Motel, I had planned to stay there in 2020."
6610790,7 Mag,2021-11-17 14:36:00,1887,"Good suggestion, thanks!"
6610804,Hot Runr Guy,2021-11-17 15:10:00,16061,I thought I saw an ad for TMG's B&B? HRG
6610806,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-17 15:12:00,8293,Thats always a possibility.
6610822,Yellowfin123,2021-11-17 15:55:00,2182,"thats really not a bad idea, may 15-sep 15 if you have the lot space for a new 40 x40 2 storys, 4 units, better income than the stock market, just rent to WC people, no need to advertise, sounds like a plan"
6610832,7 Mag,2021-11-17 16:18:00,1887,Throw in coffee and a breakfast buffet I'm sure MG could do very well!
6610834,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-17 16:21:00,8293,"I don't cook. But, I do have a beer refrigerator & a fire pit."
