6608810,cuamb,2021-11-09 06:05:00,203,I agree with tandm. I was fortunate enough to get to Canada twice this fall and I was surprised at how reasonably priced the crawlers were. They were no more expensive than the ones I buy on line here. I do feel sorry for the supplier I have used for years. I assume this will have a big impact on their business.
6608814,Bill Krejca,2021-11-09 06:27:00,6107,"Yeah, having to check to see if live bait is still on, while the fish is still in the area can be a time of decision. I go a step farther with plastic(maybe you do too) and super glue the bait on. Before doing so, I sometimes got a hit, then nothing, but left the bait down there to tempt another hit, only to find out later(after retrieving) that the plastic was half way pulled off - this doesn't happen when using glue. Bill"

6608924,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-11-09 23:06:00,240,"Sorry if this has already been covered, but will the bans for live bait at the border also apply to salted minnows? thanks--"
6608926,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2021-11-09 23:29:00,240,Sorry 'bout that--just saw in another thread that salted minnows are not allowed across the border from the U.S.
6609018,billy weaver,2021-11-10 11:56:00,470,i have been ordering a flat of nightcrawlers from Dutchies in Vermillion Bay for years and pick them up on my way. I order them by phone a couple of weeks before going. The cost is not a lot higher than buying in the U.S. I am sure there are other places you can order from. t
6609082,ia bhtr,2021-11-10 18:29:00,212,"Cant disagree with the plastics instead of live bait , just havent done it much and have more confidence with crawlers , definitely need to work with the artificials and get my confidence and ability improved"
6608432,mrwalleye5,2021-11-07 04:34:00,1922,"I used to spend large $'s on live bait of different kinds whether it be leeches, crawlers and sometime live minnows. About 4 years ago I started exclusively using certain kinds of plastics. Now I never buy live bait. I can't say that I wish I never had bought live bait ever because it is just in the last decade or so that some really game changer baits have come along. It's so nice. No fuss and no mess. As far as I'm concerned live bait can go the way of the dodo bird."
6608460,Pooch,2021-11-07 07:20:00,4618,"I doubt that live bait will go the way of the dodo bird, but as a reformed live bait addict I can say that on our only one trip to Canada in 2021 I tried live bait no more than a half dozen times and caught a lot of larger more aggressive fish on plastic. It's taken me a lot of years to get confident fishing plastic and unless it is a truly lock jawed bite, I do better on plastic fished the way the fish want it displayed. Setting on a spot for hours on end hoping a fish comes by and takes a liking to my minnow/leech/crawler is not for me. Occasionally, maybe in the evening when the quiet and calm of night comes in do I enjoy just drowning worms and observing the world. Pooch"
6608470,tandm,2021-11-07 07:40:00,679,"I have taken nightcrawlers into Canada for many years and was concerned about what to do. Called numerous bait shops, in late August and found nightcrawlers readily available in most areas. The exceptions were in the immediate Fort Francis area. Ended up reserving a 1/2 flat of nightcrawlers at a bait shop near the resort we were going to.When we picked them up, they cost less than the nightcrawlers we had been bringing from the States and were in excellent condition. The ban on nightcrawlers saved me money and eliminated the hassle of transporting live bait long distances. Come to think of it, we found the same to be true while potatoes and eggs were on the banned list."
6608476,Net_Man,2021-11-07 07:50:00,580,I also fish with more artificial baits than I used to but with your description of using live bait it sounds like your presentation was the problem.
6608492,Pooch,2021-11-07 09:02:00,4618,"Too much time ""checking"" live bait status after a ""bump"". Never check plastic after that same ""bump"" and many times a snap or drop back while convince the reluctant biter to commit. Pooch"
6608526,Obabikon,2021-11-07 11:34:00,2370,I have no inside information... but I would be surprised if there were any changes to that this year.
6608562,Wallychowder,2021-11-07 13:40:00,1567,How about next season. This season is pretty much over as far as crawlers are concerned. I thought i heard something way back in may - june that the crawler ban was just temporary ?
6608566,Baseline,2021-11-07 13:42:00,3207,"I'm in the ""no import of live bait ever again "" group. However, crawlers were the only bait allowed for as long as I can remember and that is 40 years. Rainy Lake Bait in Fort Francis was well stocked with crawlers and they were priced competitively with US prices. They will reserve half and full flats if you call ahead."
6608598,bbheli,2021-11-07 17:53:00,1387,i don't know but Ive been told Canadian Fish like Canadian crawlers.
6608602,Obabikon,2021-11-07 18:01:00,2370,"Sorry... I have already mentally moved on to next year. I do not believe there will be any change for the 2022 season. Also... aside from crawlers, a lot of people bring frozen salted minnows. I didn't understand the ban on these, but it is what it is."
6608200,ia bhtr,2021-11-05 20:49:00,212,"Guys , with no live bait this year , anybody have any idea if that will still be in place next year , kinda hoping to bring crawlers for our early June trip , Thanks for any and all thoughts , Dan"
6608204,fishman10,2021-11-05 21:27:00,226,No live bait?I donâ€™t understand?Plenty of live bait in Canada
6608206,Net_Man,2021-11-05 21:33:00,580,I have not heard anything on this but if I were a betting man then I would bet that we will see these same restrictions for next year.
6608258,Bill Krejca,2021-11-06 07:51:00,6107,"I would guess the restrictions will stay in place. I'm sure the folks who sell bait north of the border would be quite happy to keep as is. Not saying this is a bad thing, as they do have to make a living, and buying before crossing must amount to a significant amount of revenue. I don't have a dog in the game, rarely use bait, but that's the way I see it. Bill"
6608262,Wallychowder,2021-11-06 08:01:00,1567,I wonder how the folks who sell bait north of the border did it for so many years then ? Because i remember folks bringing crawlers across for many many years !
6608264,johnboat,2021-11-06 08:25:00,2014,"If the restrictions stay in place, I hope the supply can keep up with the demand. I was up this fall (late Sept- early Oct) and it sounded as if we were getting the last of the minnows.I'm not sure if it was just timing or the shortened season but it sounded as if we were fortunate to get what we needed. Maybe the crawler guys went to minnows?I've never really been a crawler guy. Getting minnows has never been an issue in Spring in the past."
6608318,Eckohlt,2021-11-06 14:29:00,3685,"If they restrict bait for 2022 it should be in the new fishing laws for 2022, I assume they put in the new laws every year.I understand it's a border thing but if it's for all of next year it should be in the booklet,but then again I don't know sht, I just go fishing regardless of what's happening."
6608352,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-06 16:19:00,8293,Nothing will change the rest of your lifetime. All restrictions & protocols will be in place forever.
6608362,RichA$1970,2021-11-06 16:43:00,1159,"Outside of crawlers, what else are people bringing and just buy it up there if needed."
6608398,Net_Man,2021-11-06 19:04:00,580,If you use remote access by water you basically have no options other than artificials with the current restrictions.
