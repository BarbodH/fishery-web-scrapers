6609568,maddogg,2021-11-12 15:54:00,178,Sorry to hear about your Dad.My buddy and I had a similar experience but not nearly as tragic.We pulled up on a nice flat rocky island with our boat and thought it would be a nice place to take a break to stretch our legs.We moved to the rear of the island and did a little casting. Luckily I move to a different spot and saw our boat drifting about 50 yards off the island. So we both tied on the largest dare devils we had and started casting.We were lucky it wasn't very windy.It took us awhile but we snagged the boat and hauled it back to the island.To this day we still argue over who was suppose throw out the anchor. I still say it was him.

I think this illustrates the point that, just like non MNR personnel, some are considerably more human than others. To the original post, we've been checked a number of times on Lac Seoul, mostly by boat, once by air, once twice in the same day by the same warden, at Deception landing several days in a row by the same female officer who was able to make us happy to slightly delay the return to the cabin and a cold beer. We've been checked on the road back to Sioux Lookout, and been checked several times in camp. Once on the water we invited the two wardens to lunch with us, since we were just getting ready to fry, and they did join us for a bite. Mostly business, some more pleasant than others, but nothing I'd call negative at all."

6609704,eyecatcher1,2021-11-13 07:07:00,323,"I had one experience on Lac Seul that could have gone bad. A friend and I were fishing and two game wardens pulled up to my boat. One got in my boat and checked licenses and then our fish. All of a sudden he says that we have two slot fish in our live well. I said we didn't, but did have two about 22 inches. My buddy was near the game warden and sees that the fish in the slot box is about 20 inches. He knew something had to be wrong with the slot box and after looking carefully he noticed that the ruler in the slot box was about an inch from the end of the box. He pointed that out to the game warden and he slid the ruler into the proper place and looked pretty embarrassed. He did apologize and left us then. I wonder if he wrote any tickets that day for fish that were actually legal fish?"
6609372,guidedfishing,2021-11-12 06:27:00,531,"Sorelips In my 40 plus years I have had interactions with MWR officers roughly a dozen times. I have had them land a float plane near me, boat up to me and tie off along side, pulled over on the highway for pulling a boat much like a traffic stop, and multiple check point stops. We have had them come into camp and check out campsite, as well as come into the fish camp and check the freezer. By and large almost all the stops have been business like, professional and non-intimidating. I did have one stop that left me furious, and sorely disappointed with the MWR for many years. My Son and I were returning from fishing it was a quick 3 days over opener and we had a room at a wide spot in the road. ""Silver Dollar"" to be exact. On our way back a MWR truck coming from the opposite direction on the highway flagged us down to stop. the MWR officers stopped us basically in our tracks completely blocking the east bound lane of traffic, their truck completely blocked the west bound lane. We had our limit of Walleyes and even though they were obviously within the size limit It was a two person limit of eater 15-16 in walleyes they measured each one carefully along with checking licenses ""it was opening day"". They then proceeded to start pulling tackle boxes and vest and gear out of the compartment to inspect. Gear was placed on the highway. In the meantime one of the two officers took my 10 year old son towards his truck, I made it clear to the officer that he was not to leave my sight, tactfully and as pleasant as I could. Then the grilling started, at least 3 times he tried to get me to say we had shore lunch. He finally said I want to see your fillet knifes, and stated they were dirty, well yes they were not spot less but they were certainly dry and pretty darn clean for a fillet knife, obvious they had not seen any use. At the same time I could hear the other officer repeatedly asking my son if he could take them back to the spot we had shore lunch. Since we never had shore lunch, my son repeatedly told him he froze his butt off, we did not have shore lunch and all he had was a sandwich, and to his credit I can show you my sandwich bag. This went on for approximately 30 mins. By this time there was considerable traffic backed up behind each vehicle. Finally the MWR gave up on us, and without anymore discussion, or thank you etc. said we are done. got in their truck and left. Well keep in mind I had gear all over the road, so now I have frustrated drivers who have been delayed in both directions and cars trying to get around while we pick up gear. I finally told my son just push the loose stuff under the boat and lets get out of the way before we get run over. After the traffic cleared we picked up our gear and went back to camp. I lost a tremendous amount of respect for the MWR on that day. I did write a letter but never received a response. Especially disappearing at the end and not assisting with traffic putting my son and I in danger. So I always caution, I have had many professional interactions, but that is not always the case."
6609396,tv4fish,2021-11-12 07:20:00,2694,"WOW - Guided, I am sorry to see your post. What they did to you (and your Son) WAS uncalled for. My group has also had ""encounters"" with the MNR up on Lac Seul and on the Canadian highways - and I will freely admit - SOME of them have NOT been pleasant. No doubt - the wardens do not have an easy job, but they NEED to remember - they are ""public"" servants and visitors to Canada (or any other people) should get some respect from them................"
6609400,eyecatcher1,2021-11-12 07:21:00,323,I've been going to the Sioux Lookout area for 30 years. I've been checked at roadside checkpoints 3 or 4 times either on 72 or 502. I've been checked on Lac Seul probably 6 or 7 times over the years and once on Big Vermillion Lake. I've been checked a few times on Abram Lake and it was usually them gathering information or telling us about new laws.
6609406,Yellowfin123,2021-11-12 07:57:00,2182,"wow!! you would think the regional bosses would be telling all the officers to carry out our laws, but be nice!! i understand they need to protect their resources but at the same time without us bringing money up there those people are gonna be eating tree bark for dinner"
6609450,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-11-12 10:07:00,358,"The inspection of the fillet knives is incredulous. Obviously the MWR had been watching too much CSI. It reminds me of the time all my gear was X-rayed at the Pigeon River border crossing. The border guard demanded to know what was in a tool bag containing bundles of wires. The guard was not interested enough to open the bag or was afraid the bag would explode. I replied ""Jumper cables."""
6609468,7 Mag,2021-11-12 10:49:00,1887,"Wow, thats horrible they put your son through that!"
6609492,Obabikon,2021-11-12 11:37:00,2370,"Man, that's a bad story... it really sucks that you and your son were put through that. I have had a BUNCH of encounters over the years with officers. Every year, at least once at the camp (sometimes twice). Most are pretty standard, and business like. A couple times things were less than smooth, but for the most part... the officers I've experienced on LOTW's have been good. The story I am going to share though... is a good one. Some of the long time regulars here might remember that my dad passed away (10 years ago) in an accident on the lake. Basically, he went to burn boxes around dinner on a rock, boat blew off the rock while he was lighting them, and he swam after it. The wind was too strong, and he couldn't catch it. It took several days (3-4) for him to be discovered. A diving team eventually had to be called in. As things unfolded, we called emergency service, and I received (within 30 minutes) a call from the MNR. He told me that they would come out immediately. They came down and began searching. Always keeping me informed, stopping by the resort, calling, and keeping us in the loop. The main two officers were ALWAYS in the bay. Looking, waiting, and giving me some peace of mind. They explained how these things typically worked, and assured me that they would not be leaving until he was found. Every single day, they would drive an hour from Kenora down to our bay. They would stay WAY past working hours. When dad's body was finally recovered, the primary officer brought me his wedding ring... he told me that there was no need for me to identify him visually. They would accept acknowledgement of dad's ring as positive identification. He said that my last memory shouldn't be of that. I know that this was an extreme circumstance, and I would like to think that most people would show kindness. But, the support that the MNR showed myself and my family during that time was incalculable. I will always be grateful."
6609500,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-12 11:53:00,8293,Hadn't heard that story about your dad before. Very sad but glad everything was handled professionally with a concern for the family. I haven't made it to your camp yet but the good Lord willing I will one day soon.
6609504,7 Mag,2021-11-12 11:57:00,1887,Sorry for your loss and glad they found your dad!
6609506,Skywagon,2021-11-12 11:58:00,1106,Tree bark and lots of walleye!
6609148,Bakefish,2021-11-11 07:37:00,1077,"We got a visit from a game warden (or whatever they are called in Canada) while on the water this fall. I've been checked only twice before but both times it was while we were in camp. I was in the process of releasing a nice northern when I looked up and saw a boat headed our way. I told my fishing partner, ""I'll be darned, here comes a game warden."" We were both surprised because in our 50+ years fishing Canada we have never been approached by a warden while on the water. I've been checked twice in camps, but not on the water. He asked to see our licenses (not the outdoor card), life vests, throwable and fish. Checked our live wells and asked if we had any questions for him. Then he went on his way. Neither a pleasant nor unpleasant experience. The whole process took about 5 minutes. We were on a lake that's a little out of the way that takes a bit of driving to get a boat on it. So you never know when the possum cops will show up. Not that it mattered because we always try to be within the law and never knowingly break the rules."
6609158,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-11 08:07:00,8293,"Another thread is talking about how technology is changing fishing. Some things we know....the population of the world isn't going down. The number of people fishing is going up. With tech the number of fish caught will go up. I have zero problems with game wardens being out, in fact in Minnesota there isn't nearly enough of them and the penalty's aren't harsh enough. Just reading the newspaper will tell you people don't respect laws, regulations or each other. I can say with certainly some people that pour out thousands of dollars for electronics won't slow down in a hot bite. Poaching is and will continue to be a big thing. My hats off to all the law enforcement trying to keep our resources safe on both sides of the border."
6609178,Walleye2242,2021-11-11 09:18:00,263,"I wish there were more ""possum cops"" on the waters in Canada. I do nothing illegal and abide by all the rules. I keep 1 maybe 2 fish a day to eat and the rest is catch and release. Kudos to all the ""green jeans"" out there making sure POS people are not ruining nature and following the laws in place."
6609196,Sorelips,2021-11-11 10:42:00,5,"New to WC, finally decide to join. Been going to Lac Seul for about 20yrs. We've been visited by the MNR officers 3 times, twice on the water and once on our way from the boat launch back to camp. Both times on the water the experience was the same as ""Bakefish's"". The experience we had that took place on the road all I can say is ""WOW"". The officer checked everything counted, measured, and documented our take home fish. What was strange is he asked us twice if we ate a shore lunch, we do not, never do. He then told us and I quote ""that fish consumed that day could count toward your daily totals"" Ive looked over the regs pretty well and cant find that rule anywhere."
6609198,Wallychowder,2021-11-11 11:10:00,1567,"could count or ""will count"" toward your daily limit ? Big difference !"
6609202,combine_billy,2021-11-11 12:17:00,151,I have gone to the same fly in lake since 1999 (except for the past 2 years) and was always told that the game warden's would fly in at times. About five years ago we saw a small boat coming our way and sure enough it was 2 game wardens. They showed up at the time we were dropping our fish in the hot grease for shore lunch. We literally had just cleaned the fish 2 minutes before they got there. We were way under our limit but they did mention that we needed to leave some skin on. We had a little discussion about that as I am not going to leave skin on while i am lowering it into the grease. I am all for those guys protecting the resources for us so I can take my grandson up with me in a few years and hopefully he can take his grandkids.
6609204,Sorelips,2021-11-11 12:32:00,5,The way we took it was if we had eaten walleye that day that he would have counted them>
6609210,gaspumper,2021-11-11 12:54:00,73,Hope this helps: Catch and Possession Limits  The catch limit is the number of fish you are allowed to catch and keep in one day and includes fish that are not immediately released and any fish eaten or given away. Catch limits apply to each individual and any fish gifted to another person count towards your catch limit even if they are gifted to a member of your fishing party.
6609216,fishron,2021-11-11 13:56:00,317,"I respect the men and women who keep our waterways safe and legal on both sides of the border. I've been fishing Canada usually twice a year more than fifty years. Only got checked once. Maybe some can remember a year way back when for some reason Ontario added a regulation that all fish kept had to have total identification. Basically the whole fish minus the guts. Only that one year. We were coming home from a great fall trip to Green shingle Lodge in southern Ontario with full limits (six fish at that time) and on the road we were pulled over by a gal who was obviously a warden. Asked to see our fish. The son of the lodge owner who we now rent cabins from, was the finest walleye fillet-er I have ever seen. He cleaned our catch leaving only a small piece of the meat attached to rest of the fish. The officer looked over our fish, said practically nothing and was gone. What would you take from that experience. I have put it behind me and continue to fish within the law and enjoy every minute."
6609350,pjshorthorn,2021-11-12 05:09:00,5654,"That would have been back in the 1990s I believe. We used to gut and degill all of our fish during those years and filleted them out when we got home. The only time I've been checked in Canada was at a roadside stop at the corner of 72 and 502 on our way home. They didn't discriminate.......everyone pulling a boat got stopped....LOL. Overall, a very nice and professional experience with the MNR. PjShorthorn"
