6609916,Cgillespie,2021-11-14 13:24:00,120,"Probably going to stay at the Balmer motel at Red Lake the night before we fly out to Cat Island Lodge. We'll have to check out the bait store in Vermillion, I was planning on stopping at LOTW sports HQ and Sunset Baits in Kenora as well."
6609926,LoDo,2021-11-14 15:06:00,721,"Oh nice! I've been to Booi's many times in my youth. Trout Lake is great!! Tackle store in Vermilon is on the south side, attached to a Shell station. Its called Bobby's corner. its roughly 5 miles east of the 105 turn off. LOTW HQ is a good one too."
6609946,Yellowfin123,2021-11-14 17:09:00,2182,bobby's is actually hair over a mile west of the 105 turn heading north
6609948,Cgillespie,2021-11-14 17:19:00,120,You are right. Found it on Google Earth. Looks like a good place to fill up with gas before getting on 105.
6609954,Yellowfin123,2021-11-14 17:35:00,2182,"its a happnin place in vermillion plus theres a little ""roach coach"" type trailer with some pretty good food at least i thought so"
6609994,LoDo,2021-11-14 21:32:00,721,"Yes. My bad! West of the 105 turn off. We've stayed at the Super 8 for the past 6-8 yrs. I remember going to Red Lake before Super 8 and it was real touch n go on a bed, especially if you arrived later than 11p. We've def slept in the car a handful of times. Be sure and hit the Thirsty Moose restaurant in Red Lake. You'll drive by it on your way to Red Lake Marine."
6610000,johnboat,2021-11-14 21:59:00,2014,Why not just get your groceries in Red lake?
6610046,RichA$1970,2021-11-15 06:22:00,1159,I went grocery last night and felt like I was in Moscow in the 80’s as the shelves were bare. I wonder if Red Lake or other remote areas are feeling the supply chain fubar?
6610118,NM_Trout,2021-11-15 08:44:00,1094,"I did on my first trip to Red Lake back in 2003. We phoned in an order to be assembled and to have meat frozen in advance for us. We later found the meat was sour at the time we thawed it, and selection was a little limited, and the prices were just higher due to the location of the stores. Since then we shop at the larger stores on the way up, get what we want and end up paying less. It does take longer, but we know what we are going to have when we get to camp."
6609486,NM_Trout,2021-11-12 11:24:00,1094,"Ok. I booked my June trip, and I have flights arriving into YWG.Next up, I need to plan some logistics, and would appreciate any guidance.1) Safe, clean, decent area near the YWG airport for a good hotel? We have an early morning flight out departing YWG and I don't want to have to drive too long to get to the airport. 2) I'd welcome a restaurant recommendation near YWG as well. On the night before we leave Canada, we do like to go to a nicer restaurant to eat something that we don't have to do the dishes for :-) 3) We will be heading out of YWG for Red Lake as soon as we arrive into Canada. I think the last time we made a stop in Dryden for groceries. Any other options for a large grocery stop between YWG and Red Lake? (we are not taking bait. just need groceries. bonus points if we can call a grocery order in and have it assembled and waiting for us)4) Any tips for either navigating through or around Winnipeg appreciated. I think we land approx noon on a Saturday. Hoping traffic is not bad that time of day. 5) Finally... its been 8 or 9 years since I booked a motel room in Red Lake. Any recommendations on a clean place to get some rest on Saturday night?Thanks in advance...."
6609524,Cgillespie,2021-11-12 12:57:00,120,"The two hotels at the airport at Winnipeg are pretty nice. There is a good restaurant in each of them. Our flight arrives in Winnipeg before noon, so we'll be driving to Red Lake as soon as we get our rental car. We'll stay at the airport hotel the night before we fly home. There is a Safeway in Kenora that is pretty well stocked. We're going to Cat Island Lodge, they recommended the Balmer motel in Balmertown."
6609532,Eckohlt,2021-11-12 13:47:00,3685,The super 8 motel
6609612,Tx Jig tyr,2021-11-12 16:49:00,140,"It is counter intuitive, but go north from the airport to the by pass and then go east. It is much quicker and easier than trying to navigate south and east through town. Both major hotels, Hilton and Sheraton? are very close to airport and have good restuarants. If you haven't already, make your vehicle rental arrangements dont wait. Tx Jig Tyr"
6609614,Cgillespie,2021-11-12 16:57:00,120,"I’ve got my rental car booked already. I’ll have to remember that tip about going north to the bypass, thanks."
6609616,NM_Trout,2021-11-12 16:59:00,1094,"Thanks... yes. I found that cars in June of 2022 are getting hard to come by. Prices have jumped up a lot. Oddly, the cheapest car I could get is costing me $480 total cost for 9 days. And it is a BMW M3. We are going to be rolling up in style. Previous trips, the car cost no more than $300. Thank God for travel points."
6609706,Eckohlt,2021-11-13 07:21:00,3685,"I guess we don't know how lucky we are to be fairly close to Ontario, to just jump in the truck n go"
6609710,pjshorthorn,2021-11-13 07:58:00,5654,"I have stayed at a number of hotels close to the airport, but the one I liked was a Holiday Inn just a few miles south of the airport entrance. Don't stay in downtown as it is a PITA for parking. I think the HI was off of King's Highway ( road name might be incorrect). There is a gas station on the right as you approach the airport main drag. It is open early in the morning.....we always had 6 am flights going back to Atlanta. Travel out of the city can be a bit of a challenge if you go through the city. The bypass is probably a better suggestion and traffic should be fine at the time you hit the road. Grab a map at the rental desk......it will help you get oriented. If you take the bypass, you might see the big sunflower fields in their full glory. They can be stunning if the timing is right. Myself, I like going through downtown to see all of the older buildings and architecture....but that is just me. My son would just sleep...LOL. Kenora is a good place to stop for your groceries. Having to go into Dryden would cost you about an extra hour roundtrip past your turnoff on the 105. Enjoy the drive....you see will a lot of different landscapes and an amazing amount of beauty. You will also see a ton of turnoff signs for lodges that you have either heard of or thought about going to. One day, I hope, my son and I will go back to Red Lake for another trip. A really nice lake with a shot at some big pike and solid walleyes. Best of luck on your trip planning. Feel free to PM me with any questions. Been through the process you are embarking upon from the Peg to a final destination a bunch of times. PjShorthorn"
6609744,bthomas3333,2021-11-13 10:36:00,465,If the price isn't too much the Grand Winnipeg is connected to the airport and closest to the airport rental cars and the customs exit door. I normally arrive on a flight between 11p-1a so close and easy is key. The rooms are very nice and the beds super nice. Esp when sharing rooms we stay there because the extra 20bucks each is worth the conveniance. Sometimes it allows us to wait on picking up the car if driving in the am. Saving a day of car rental pays for the higher price. My choice for food which is nearby (5-10 mins) is Tony Roma's. Lots of stuff there I like and it is nearby. Also there is a liquor store like 2 miles from Tony Roma's. In Red Lake I usually choose the super 8. It was the newest place and had a 24hr Timmy's in front. I've done the drive out of Winnipeg more than 20 times. IT IS AMAZING how big of a PIA it really is. I've done the bypass and the extra miles kill you. Driving through town is complicated and the stop lights suck (like 40 of them). I've timed it both ways and in general if it is an off day or off time (Sat at 4a as an example) I drive through town it is quicker. If it is a weekday and around rush hour then I take the bypass. Anyway that's my two cents. Brett
6609912,LoDo,2021-11-14 13:20:00,721,We fly Denver to Winnipeg annually. I've driven to Red Lake from Winnipeg many times. We travel on weekdays and we've found the bypass to the north to be the route. We used to drive through the city and found the bypass to be faster. I'm not sure which would be faster on a weekend. Agree with earlier poster getting through Winnipeg is a pain. We do all our shopping in Kenora. Theres a Safeway and Walmart. Theres a nice bait shop in Vermilion before heading north to Red Lake. Where are you staying in Red Lake?
