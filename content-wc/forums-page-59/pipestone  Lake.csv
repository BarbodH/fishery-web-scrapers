6607652,jackpotjohnny48,2021-11-03 23:20:00,153,"Hi, I have taken about 5 different trips to Pipestone over the years. Fished it in 2003, 2010, 2017, 2018, and 2019. It's ULTRA clear water, so the daytime bite can be difficult, but the after dark bite can be very rewarding, and there are some true GIANTS in there (both the muskies and walleyes get extremely fat feeding on the abundant population of ciscoes and whitefish). Since it is a deep, clear, oligotrophic lake (i.e. a ""lake trout"" lake), it is definitely not a numbers lake, and the tactics that work on shallower, darker waters (such as Lac Seul, for example), will not work very well on Pipestone. (But if you bring your bug suit, your permithrin bug spray, and your flashlight, and you're willing to fish from about 9 pm until 3 am the next morning, it can be a very rewarding lake). As far as accomodations, you can stay at any of the following: 1. Cedar Island Lodge - centrally located on an island in the lower arm of Pipestone, just west of Leatzow point. Operated by Carrie Baker and Jessie Baker 2. Pipestone Lodge - located on the island that is right next to Cedar Island. Operated by Art and Jenny Perchuliak These are the two full service resorts on Pipestone.... 3. Pipestone Fly-In Outposts - This is a boat in lodge on Slender Lake, which is located near the very southern part of Pipestone. But Slender is connected to Pipestone via a channel, so it's basically all the same body of water. Operated by Mike Henry 4. Hideaway Lodge Outpost Cabin Located in the Northwest Arm of Pipestone. Operated by Doug and Kathy Johnson, who also own a full service resort on Clearwater (Burditt) Lake, which is the lake that you must travel through in order to get to the railroad portage into Pipestone. I've been to all 4 places, and would go back to any of them. I think we also stayed at an outpost cabin one year, located in the Northwest Arm (I think it was run by Border Country Outfitters, based out of Emo, if I remember correctly. And that was fine too) Anyway, I think it's one of the more beautiful places that I've ever been, and I'm very much looking forward to my next trip to Pipestone. The fishing can be quite difficult if you approach it using dark water / shallow water tactics, or if you fish it on bright sunny days. But if you fish on overcast days (or even better, if you fish after dark), you can be rewarded in a big way. As far as the railroad portage, here's a little video I shot a couple years ago... It's ultra beautiful once you get dumped on the north side of the portage. Hope that helps.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB8n_ef7vqU ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

After working all day and driving all night, we crossed the portage and got lost out on the lake. Asking some fishermen wthww, we camped on an island on the far end of the lake. Although we didn't do well on walleyes, I did manage to catch a muskie from off the island. Nearby Schistose (sp?) Lake, connected, was very good for lake trout. We stayed several days and ended up at LOW. Bill"

6607766,mms3rd,2021-11-04 12:46:00,148,"My wife and I stayed at the outpost cabin that is 16 miles north of the put in on Clearwater lake. It is in Watson Bay. We carried two kayaks with us. The cabin was in pretty good shape with a separate outhouse and a shower house (which we use a couple times a day). We used/rented a sat phone. From what I can tell, guide/outfitter now runs it. This was my worst trip to Canada from a fishing point of view. It was early June but temps near 80 and high sun every day except the first and last. I got average small mouth along the shoreline in the morning and evening (no more than 6 at a time). Caught a few walleyes (5-6), and one small lake trout....oh, and one small muskie. To me, this is ""big water"" and I had never been there. I might be a 6 1/2 on a 10 point scale for fishing......some might say a 5. But, I was on the water morning until evening and actually got lost late evening. Thought I would spend the night on the water. My wife had built a big campfire which I saw almost by accident. Al Lindner has a Youtube video where I think he is fishing just across the mechanical portage on the Pipestone side....he had a guide who knew the waters. Good luck......Mike"

6607852,dstemp,2021-11-04 20:23:00,16,Thank you so much for the replies !! on the pipe stone area it sounds great I am hesitant over the clear lake fishing . I have been on them before . And found it difficult to fish . I am open to suggestions . In my earlier post I said I was recently in the lower half what I call it LOW below Morson it was good but had winds 20-30MPH that was hard so Im looking to book another trip for next summer to a smaller lake area . Im more used to fishing what I guess stained water like in northern Wis And really not interested in a couple hundred mile drive up from the border Have a friend who suggested pipe stone point area don't know much about that .
