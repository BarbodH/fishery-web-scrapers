6606274,Obabikon,2021-10-28 08:58:00,2370,"It was certainly one of the best 2 months of fishing I have seen. All species seemed fatter and more aggressive. Hopefully the trend continues next year, and we all get to enjoy it together!"

6606318,Riding high,2021-10-28 13:07:00,69,"I've fished out of miles bay on LOW for 9 years now. Usually in May and late August. This year it was first part of September. I've never had so many 12-14 inch walleyes like we had this year. Everyone hit like it was a way bigger fish. We didn't catch a third of the walleyes over 20"" as we normally do. My wife and I biggest was 25"" and only ended up the week with 21 over 20"" alot of fish just no size."
6606500,fishman10,2021-10-29 12:29:00,226,"If you caught that many smaller ones doesn’t mean the big ones weren’t there.Smaller fish are more aggressive, and maybe you were in the wrong area for bigger fish.It was your first time fishing at that time of year.I’ve fished and suddenly the big fish turn on, nothing but 4-5 pound fish, then 30 minutes later the switch turns off and it’s back to smaller ones ."
6606522,JAY221,2021-10-29 13:24:00,877,"We were up from the 19th to the 27th of August and we normally come up mid to late July. The fishing this year was exceptionally better than previous years. We don't know if it was the shutdown from nobody coming for 18 months or so if it was just the month later but I am thinking it was the lack of fisherman because we had no problem catching fish this year all day every day. Next year will tell the tale as we are returning mid July if the powers that be allow us in again! Later, Jay"

6606578,Obabikon,2021-10-29 18:23:00,2370,"I'm not sure who ended up winning. I know that Jason or Jules didn't... but, can't remember who did."
