1264607,SeulAreaWalleye,2011-01-25 08:33:00,100,"I once had a guest hook a 23.5 inch walleye, on the bottom, in 93 feet of water. We were fishing for Lake Trout on Minnitaki Lake. This one came up way beyond ""the Bends"". I have only seen this once, and I still don't know why it was down there. I don't recommend fishing too deep, when there are higher concentrations of walleye in depths that they will be successfully released at."

6609130,last chance,2021-11-11 06:00:00,3262,the deepest I have caught them is at 65' in lake Erie in the central basin. most of the fish go deep in the summer months. if you want walleye during the summer months on Erie it's best to fish deep.
6609370,kswalleyer,2021-11-12 06:26:00,1651,"you asked abiut size, most of my biggest walleyes have come shallow(less than 6 ft). I dont fish below 25 ft if that."
6609540,Misdirection,2021-11-12 14:12:00,418,"Same here. In the summer, its all about water temps and where the thermocline sets up. Out of Ashtabula, that's around 50' come July and makes its way deeper as the days get hotter. Ours are destined for the fryer, so were not overly concerned about mortality. And those deeper fish tend to be the larger ones.Sent from my SM-A505U using Tapatalk"
1262207,SydneyLake,2011-01-16 17:10:00,1,"What's the Deepest Walleye You Ever Caught?Exploring the depths of walleye fishing...How deep was the deepest walleye you ever caught? Is the average size bigger?What is the best structure to fish? Reefs, Drop Offs, Flats?When is better for deep walleyes - May June or July August?I have noticed that in July and August walleyes move deeper. Even when they are very active at 15 to 18 feet there are spots at 35 to 30 feet where they are also very active but the average size is much better. I have also found big walleyes at 50 feet May long weekend. The deepest walleye i have caught is at 65 feet. Usual bait is jigs and minnows or tails. Is there a sweet spot for certain times of year with numbers vs. size?"
1262217,Pooch,2011-01-16 18:12:00,4618,"We catch walleye fishing for lake trout at about any depth down to one hundred feet. From such deep water there's no hope to release them so they end up as supper. I've not seen anything above normal in size from these depths. Some larger than average Northern seem to prowl the depths in hot weather probably looking for cooler waterWe don't intentionally target walleye that are in deep water as it is almost always fatal. I'd guess that even those fish that appear to swim away will soon perish. Seems all fish will acclimate to deep water as they feed, but sudden changes in depth pressure is a killer for most species.Interesting question though.Pooch"
1262295,Skywagon,2011-01-17 07:15:00,1106,"Well put Pooch, that is information everyone should be aware of. You have to go to extraordinary means to save fish caught from deep water. Ask the tournament fisherman that must keep their fish alive, what they have to go through, if they happen to catch a fish in deep water."
1262302,BenBeattie,2011-01-17 07:24:00,232,I make a point of not targeting walleye deeper then 40' due to the high mortality rate of fish caught from deeper water.
1262321,2Labs,2011-01-17 08:28:00,685,Me too.

1262613,3M TA3,2011-01-18 09:25:00,2846,I caught one once that was into poetry. I thought that was pretty deep.

1263524,new hips,2011-01-21 09:41:00,498,"About 5 yrs back on Lac Seul we found the motherload of sauger and walleye on a flat 50ft deep. This was in September 3rd week, just remember to bring up slow or they will die. All fish were 18-20in. I'm not a fan of fishing deep because of mortality is high."
