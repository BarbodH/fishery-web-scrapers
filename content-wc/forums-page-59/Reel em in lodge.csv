6609088,dstemp,2021-11-10 19:36:00,16,Has anyone anyone visited the Reel em Lodge near Morson ? is see its a boat in just wondering what type of place it is and what experiences they had Thanks

It is way out west (compared to us). You won't see a ton of boats out there, and you won't need to go far for good fishing. Sorry I don't have more information, but hope that helps!"

He has had nothing but good things to say about the camp, the fishing, and the owners."
6609304,dstemp,2021-11-11 19:37:00,16,Thank You for the replies Well after reading what others have posted it sounds to be very interesting I have never done a boat in until I started searching for places to fish in Canada This might be a interesting experience

My biggest walleye (28"")and musky (52"""") that I've caught in LOWS come from around firebag. Biggest smallmouth in my life came from milebay( 22.5"""") There are more boats buzzing around that area than most might think. I think some come from flag Island in minasota. Not that far from there."
