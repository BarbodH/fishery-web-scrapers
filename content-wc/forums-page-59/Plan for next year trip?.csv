6605936,SJC305,2021-10-26 07:41:00,154,"I booked my trip about three weeks ago for Lochlomond Camp, near Longlac ON. The previous place we stayed at (Northwood Lodging) closed/sold over the last year and we needed a new place to stay.Owners of the new place said they had already reserved 2 of the 7 cabins out for next year already from USA groups. I would definitely book ASAP, as we are all eager to get fishing for next year.We typically bring everything with us and only need to buy bait and minor other items while there. Bringing an arrival meal and departure meal makes life a lot easier."
6605954,Fisherman Ted,2021-10-26 10:04:00,461,For those going to NW Ontario I would book ASAP if not earlier. We have had 2 years worth of rollovers so the first 10 weeks of the 2022 season have been locked up since last June. It will be virtually impossible to book with a camp during May/June next year for those camps that are mostly American. Just my 2 cents. -FT
6605958,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-26 10:12:00,8293,"There will be angler attrition from those who found other locations during Covid. There will be those who for personal reasons aren't vaccinated. But, I'm assuming there will be lost camps also. Those camps who couldn't survive and haven't found new owners yet. I think in the case of Canadian fishing the sooner the better would apply."
6606018,7 Mag,2021-10-26 18:35:00,1887,"I know Cedar Lake Camp was recently sold, there's probably a few others that might be considering it. Definitely a tough couple of seasons for the camp owners and everyone else associated with the tourism industry. I've got a fall trip booked for Pelican/Abram lakes and I'm thinking a spring trip to LOWs or Eagle might be a possibility."
6606096,Hillbiehle,2021-10-27 08:25:00,66,"I have quite a few fillet knives, some are custom and expensive and others the more traditional Rapalas etc... All are good, but if I had to recommend one knife it would be a Dexter based on price and quality. More times than not, you will see professional fish mongers, salt water guides, fish cleaning stations on Erie (or wherever) all using Dexters. If it's good enough for them everyday, it's perfect for me for fishing and breaking down a deer, etc..."
6606246,Larry S,2021-10-28 06:26:00,665,"As Iam getting up in age (73) ,my sister who is (69) and I have decided to go on 3 fishing trips this year We are fortunate having the $$ to do this so we are going ahead with our plans. Have made 2 reservations one for an outpost on Antenna Lake with Clarks May 28 2022 to June 4th 20222 and another at Uchi Lake Lodge for Sept 10th to Sept 17th 2022. We also are going June 29th to July 7th to North Caribou Lake with our friends from Pittsburgh for the 4 time to this lake which we love. Larry Schroeder"
6610444,nitroman,2021-11-16 09:39:00,368,"Not sure I ever stop planning as I am a planner by trade so .......... Just made reservations for the Friday night stay last week as you need to make them early because every hotel near the border fills up fast come the first of the year. After 20 years planning is fairly effortless as the plan has remained pretty consistent. Meal plans nearly set in stone now and it's really just reminding people of what to bring for what nights meal. As people come and go from the core group we give them things to take care of and after they make a trip or two then they know how it goes. We stop at the same places to get gas etc every year so when we depart we don't even try to stay together on the road like we used to as we know we will catch up at the next scheduled stop. This time of year we start to get excited for the sports show and the trip so we text a bit more and i send out meal plans and reservation confos and then some pics start flying around and by memorial day we get together to finalize things which nowadays is just confirmation as to what time we are leaving(same time each year) and what kind of beer each is getting at the beer store after we cross. but to answer the op question, I plan all year long and even after 20 years we still learn things we can do better next time or things that would make the next trip better or more comfortable and enjoyable. I normally note these things while in camp or soon thereafter so as to implement them for the next trip. good luck, tight lines!"
6605128,Camoclad,2021-10-22 12:22:00,628,"My advice is book them both as soon as you can. Rental cars got scarce this year in the summer and may next season too. The flights are likely to change a bunch of times as they work out the flight schedules and it becomes more stable the closer you get to the actual date of flying. The reason I would advise you to book sooner than later in the current situation is that once on the roster it is easier to get changes made without having to pay a change fee (when they make the changes). It is a tough decision, since you will likely pay a bit more for an early reservation though there is no guarantee there will be room on a flight later or that it might not go crazy high in price because of fuel costs, ongoing staff shortages, etc. I have noticed everything about the trips are trending about 10% higher so our traditional all in cost of $2700 (outfitter, plane tickets, hotels, taxis, grocery, bait, license, misc.) is now around $3000 and nothing appears to be trending toward any stability or reduction in prices."
6605176,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-22 16:42:00,8293,My point is you can buy a Minnkota and have it dropped shipped to me. Should get free shipping if you use somebody like Reeds. Then when your group fly's in here you can grab it if you are ok for weight on the plane from Fort Francis. When you get back you can drop battery & motor here until the next trip.
6605200,Cgillespie,2021-10-22 17:45:00,120,"I will probably book the rental car ASAP, but I'll try to wait a few more weeks on airline tickets. Air Canada used to have one flight a day from Memphis to Toronto that was convenient, and I can book it for 6/2022, but I have my doubts that they'll actually resume that flight. I will probably play it safe and book with Delta."
6605254,last chance,2021-10-23 04:55:00,3262,"1 word BUBBA for all your fillet needs. if you haven't used an electric knife it's time you learned. the bubba cordless with 2 lithium is number 1 for remote areas or anywhere you use a fillet knife. the bubba corded knife is top of the line also for places you have power, but the cordless is what I recommend. if you just want a good old fashioned knife bubba has a 9"" that works great on larger fish but still works great on smaller fish as well. the bubba cordless kits come with 2 batteries as well as 4 different blades. we start planning our next trip as soon as our trip is over."
6605256,Cgillespie,2021-10-23 05:11:00,120,"The Bubba is a great knife, but I just could not get used to the trigger on it. I got a Rapala R12 that has the two lithium batteries. I have cleaned a lot of crappie and walleye with it and it has performed well. I will be taking it to Canada next summer."
6605330,Net_Man,2021-10-23 08:31:00,580,"Some times we start planning for next years trip as we are driving for this years trip.... Drive in resorts/lodges have greater capacity which normally does not require as early of a booking as a fly-in trip. Fly-in, generally a group with reservations this year has 1st opportunity for this lake/time slot when booking for next year. This opportunity usually fades away if they do not re-book as they leave from this years trip. I prefer fishing on opener and I have had to wait several years to schedule a specific lake for this time slot while waiting for the existing group not to re-book. If you have the luxury of identifying specifics dates in advance then book early as possible. As previously stated May and June are generally the busiest. For me packing fishing gear is the easiest part of the trip. If you are responsible for food then that is much trickier. The more people generally the harder it becomes. Our party generally has run from 3 to 8 people and I hate planning food for larger groups....... You are on track with premade meals if you desire more fishing or relaxation time. Depending on the time of year and if you do not have air conditioning then heating up the stove/oven might not be as good of idea as using a outside grill. What ever choice you go meals can be quite simple and fast or time consuming as you desire. If you are not bringing your own luxury boat then you are right on track with a waterproof bag or stuff sack. I prefer stuff sacks. Yes, as earlier stated you may have to dig a little more. However, most of us have experienced the non-waterproof nature of a item that we purchased which is sold as a waterproof item. I believe the design of of stuff sack lends itself to achieve a greater success in waterproofing as well as greater longevity than a bag style."
6605344,Camoclad,2021-10-23 08:57:00,628,"Yep,that is how is was figuring too, thinking about the total weight we had left for the float plane which theoretically is 600lbs total for the group and whether or not there would be some margin for a battery and trolling motor. I think there could be, we are never usually at or even close to the weight limits per person. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6605628,NARDA 1,2021-10-24 19:00:00,636,Our next years trip was planned and booked before we left the lodge.
6605630,btyreprich,2021-10-24 19:01:00,1067,"We set the date for next years trip when paying the bill for the current trip. I'd make the hotel reservations in December. The ride home is when we review the menu for next year and come up with items to bring on the next trip. As my friend has not / will not get the COVID vaccine, I've already reached out to a member of this group about possibly going on their Canadian trip in 2022. My friend wants to try two trips in 2022. Not sure where in Spring, but we have agreed on say Rainy Lake or Lake of the Woods in late August to early September."
6605792,10lbeye,2021-10-25 14:05:00,61,"In terms of menu items, I love preparing a few meals ahead of time and freezing them to max our time on the water. Here's a simple one that the gang loves. For 6, take a half dozen chicken breasts and a large jar of salsa. Throw them into a crock pot until fork tender and you can shred them with a fork. take 1 cup of any long grain rice you like and cook separately. fold the cooked rice into the cooked breasts as well as a small bag of frozen corn, or any other vegetable(s) you want. If it's a bit dry, add some more salsa to taste. Freeze the cooled mixture flat in a large ziplock bag. Placing the bag on a cookie sheet in the freezer ensures that it will freeze flat for easy transport. Heat slowly in a large pot (add small amount of water so it won't burn). Some of the guys made monster burritos with them w/ sour cream and lettuce. Others just ate it from a bowl. A one pot, pre-prepared meal that's hearty and easy to make beforehand and re-heat. You can add any side dish you want if that's not enough."
6604844,Walleye2242,2021-10-21 08:12:00,263,So when do you start planning for the next years trip? I fished gullrock the last week of Sept this year. Just 2 of us. We left at 6am for the drive home and 5 minutes down the road we are already talking about next year and things to do different or better or the same. It was a very last minute trip for us...decided on a tuesday night and left that friday morning. Things we need....have to get a better fillet knife...my knife sucked all week. Feel free to reccomend. A first aid kit for the boat or cabin. We had nothing. also a little survival kit for the boat in case of break downs or lost. I need a decent wet bag for the boat. Nothing huge but a nice water proof bag to keep things. Feel free to recommend. Easy dinner meals...just 2 of us and we want to fish all we can. I do not want to come in at 7pm(gets dark that time of year) and cook a full meal. We had fish every night and I made a pot of chili. really...i could do that all week long for dinner and not care. Any thoughts or ideas is always welcome from what you all do on your trips.
6604876,Baseline,2021-10-21 10:35:00,3207,"We learn something on every trip we take. For a dry bag I'd recommend the Cabelas Boundary Waters roll top duffel bag. Buy the large one. I've had mine for at least 15 years and it has been on every outdoor trip I take. I stuff extra jackets, sweatshirts, shoes, rain suit, hats, gloves, etc. It is heavy duty and rugged. It is big enough, but not oversized. DON'T buy the top load stuff sack version. My buddy bought one and he is always digging down into it trying to find something. It costs over a $100, but you will have it for all your trips summer and winter for years to come."
6604914,Camoclad,2021-10-21 12:12:00,628,"We use a fly-in outfitter every other year so in a typical cycle (non-pandemic) we would check for available dates and choose a lake/week around July/August. Usually, purchase plane tickets around Thanksgiving, buy a license and outdoor card in January, book hotel/motel/taxi in Jan-March, send out menu/grocery list to the group for approval in April then to the outfitter in May. Send a reminder in early June about the weight limits and packing details, and start gathering the group items that will be packed. Our trips are in mid to end June so it is an off and on process for most of the year. One item we didn't have the first year was a depth finder, probably do not need it but we have taken a portable for each boat on our trips since. If the fishing turns tough it can be helpful to isolate a depth range to fish in and possibly eliminate some water. One item that I wish we had and have not figured out a way to make it happen was to have a trolling motor/battery for a camp boat. I think it would make pike stalking even better if we had a way to quiet the gas motor."
6604964,Eckohlt,2021-10-21 17:17:00,3685,Paddle?
6604980,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-21 18:12:00,8293,How are you guys weight wise for your trip? I know where you can store a motor and battery between trips.
6604992,Eckohlt,2021-10-21 18:36:00,3685,"I was over weight with cash,looking for a place to store a load,any ideas?"
6605000,adempsey2.0,2021-10-21 19:11:00,611,"If it's going to be in May or June, book as soon as possible. The more trips you do, the more routine it gets. Only difference between planning for me is if I am driving to the air-base or if I have to fly commercially and then rent a car (or not). From there, pretty standard routine depending on travel plan. Similar to what Camoclad posted."
6605004,Camoclad,2021-10-21 20:32:00,628,"We use what is there for paddles, the trolling motor would help cover ground a bit more efficiently. The gas motor does too, I just get tired of listening to it and would assume there would be some benefit to the quietness of the trolling motor for sneaking in on some of the bigger fish.

6605006,Camoclad,2021-10-21 20:38:00,628,"That might be a possibility. We are limited to 50 lbs each on the checked bag for commercial flight so the rest of our weight is what we carry on, then bait and grocery so we are usually +/- 15lb per guy at that point in additional allowable weight. With a group of 6 that leaves us @90lbs. Maybe a low end trolling motor and a motorcycle battery? Something to think about for sure. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6605040,Cgillespie,2021-10-22 07:14:00,120,We are headed up to Cat Island Lodge near Red Lake in mid-June. We are flying into Winnipeg and renting a car for the drive. When should we book airline tickets and rental car?
