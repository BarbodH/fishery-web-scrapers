6612388,Bigtaproot,2021-11-22 11:30:00,900,All of a sudden my timeshare in Branson seems pretty nice. Glad you can appreciate beauty 12 months out of the year. I dont think i could do it even with the old lady by my side during the winter tundra time
6612398,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 11:54:00,3685,"You and the old lady could do it,you can have a dog sled team,,,a trap line to tend to,,,,,ice fishing everyday,,,and last but not least a reality show,,,big money.Plenty of things to keep you n dumpling happy."
6612414,Bigtaproot,2021-11-22 12:45:00,900,Nice idea and sounds like easy money if i can get the old lady to overcome her reluctance to appear on camera because she thinks she is overweight. Is tending to a trapline enough physical activity to lose weight?
6612418,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 12:59:00,3685,"Ya she can lose weight tending to a trap line,just don't let her eat the animals caught in the trap they could be fatty."
6612448,prov1800,2021-11-22 15:04:00,5010,Hope dumpling doesnt read these posts
6612452,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 15:09:00,3685,Lol
6612524,x4flatfish,2021-11-22 18:29:00,319,Climate change?...
6612530,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 18:31:00,3685,Four seasons where I live.
6612542,prov1800,2021-11-22 18:56:00,5010,I do see it I think.wind seems worse last few years.Could be all the logging.But our seasons seem the same.Ice out usually the same and ice on about the same.In between those times its awesome.
6610598,prov1800,2021-11-16 17:57:00,5010,People still fishing.
6610606,7 Mag,2021-11-16 18:21:00,1887,"Sounds like it was a rough few days, kind of reminds me of the winters we used to have back in the 70’s. I bought a generator about 12 years ago, one of the best investments I’ve ever made."
6610664,prov1800,2021-11-17 05:50:00,5010,Going to be getting one.Did manage to borrow one from a guy and used it to circulate my outdoor stove and got my water pump going.Picked up a generator and on on way home the power came back on.Lol.Normally doesnt stay off that long.Its still kinda dangerous to in bush for hunting and its still windy.Few trees nust missed my hunting blind so skeptical about going to spend some time in in there until wind settles down.
6610680,Eckohlt,2021-11-17 06:28:00,3685,If you do sit in the blind john wear a hard hat
6610688,prov1800,2021-11-17 06:41:00,5010,I'll have to find a orange one to be legal.
6611828,prov1800,2021-11-20 12:32:00,5010,Well
6612246,prov1800,2021-11-21 18:31:00,5010,No luck.ill stay home till wind dies down.Today 60 km again and some snow.One tree came down when i checked and baited blind.pretty loud.Buck came in fairly early while I was having coffee at home.lol.Road I travel on was starting to get blown in.
6612280,Eckohlt,2021-11-22 03:33:00,3685,Coffee rules
6612304,Bill Krejca,2021-11-22 06:08:00,6107,"RE: Drift picture - Reminds me of the years we spent living in the rural area north of Marion, Iowa. Folks in town have no idea how much the snow differs with a little wind in the country. We have had nothing but a few flurries here so far this year, which is OK. Bill"
6612314,prov1800,2021-11-22 07:10:00,5010,I could live with just a few flurries to but that's not goung to happen here.20+inches of snow causes different problems most city people never have to deal with.I got lucky that there going to cut some crown land 5-6 miles past my private property and the logging company plowed the road.Even put a small parking spot in for me right where I go into the prop.Hunting is not that great now with the storm.Hard for the deer to get to my blind area but so get the odd one.Had around 20 deer visiting earlier now a have 2-3.Had 5 decent bucks now have had 2 come here and there.More snow yesterday and have been having 40-60 km winds last few daýs.
6610406,prov1800,2021-11-16 07:52:00,5010,"What was a beautifull fall turned ugly few days ago.We received around 20"" of warmth sticky snow and caused many problems across our region.We had a power outage do 3 days.Thousands of trees went down on hydro lines and a lot of the back roads were impassable leaving lots of people stranded.We heated the house with a couplè of buddy heaters and cooked on our bbq and my double burner outdoor stove.Melted snow to do dishes and flush toilet and had candle lit diners.Had a buddy up from Madison hunting deer and storm kind of put a damper on that.Had 3 blinds going.Ill have to wait till spring to get my gear from tgat one.Got all my buddies stuff out and had to go in with my snowmobile.Have one blind I can use and have broken a walking trail in to it.Lots of trees down getting in there and probably still dangerous in there with trees potentially ready to snap with snow load.Will be getting a generator just in case.But never had a outage that long.Borrowed a genny and could circulate my water from boiler and fill my pressure tank with water and a few lights.Have more snow now than the last few years."
6610412,stjoeguy,2021-11-16 08:21:00,979,"I heard that you got pounded, but didn't know it was that bad. I talked with a friend in Sioux Lookout whose wife was stranded in Thunder Bay. Glad to hear you got by OK. Hopefully, the blessing will be that it helps replenish lake levels."
6610426,prov1800,2021-11-16 08:47:00,5010,It will help some.As I was melting snow you wouldn't beleive how much snow is needed.But everything helps.most melt off in spring tends to evaporate.We actually had quite of bit of rain this fall which had lake levels already coming up
6610432,That Minnesota guy,2021-11-16 08:58:00,8293,"Snowfalls like that create problems, but they sure are pretty."
6610434,prov1800,2021-11-16 09:04:00,5010,Diffenatly problems.Most back roads now plowed out.But your right about how pretty it is when your walking throufh it.
6610500,Eckohlt,2021-11-16 12:01:00,3685,"Now you know what it was like in the old pioneer days,,,,,,(everyday)"
6610506,Skywagon,2021-11-16 12:40:00,1106,"I spent a couple of extended sessions my tracked skid-steer with a 4-in-1 bucket clearing our trails at home. The heavy-wet snow combined with the wind took down more big trees than normal, the spindly stuff is down every which way, but that is business as usual after this kind of snow. My estimate is that there are are over twice as many down trees as there were when we had the last wet/early snow problem. The trails to the remote lakes are going to be an challenge, the time spent clearing them by hand will be a big issue this winter and continue into the spring for tourist camp operators with boat caches and private camp owners a like. As a side note, the walleye lakes are starting to freeze in the shallower sections. Included is a photo looking out my living room window, you can see where ice is already covering part of the lake."
6610558,prov1800,2021-11-16 14:46:00,5010,Your absolutly right about trees down.Some areas worse than others but that caused 3 days of no power at my house.Got to thank all the hydro guys for putting 24/7 in.Not much ice in our area yet it's been warm.Took a pic at Eagle Lake dock today and have 50 km s/e wind blowing.
6610584,Eckohlt,2021-11-16 16:11:00,3685,Still looks like a go for fishing
6610590,walleyecheek,2021-11-16 16:36:00,2231,If you go take your auger just in case !
