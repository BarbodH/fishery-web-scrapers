6604330,joeflip,2021-10-18 07:43:00,75,"Thunderhook purchased a majority of the outpost, I would definitely recommend them, they would definitely work with you if a outpost is available the 4 or 6 person limits are flexible, Thunderhook was recently sold about 2 years ago and the new owners have made many upgrades, this past August and September my group did a 2 week trip at the Almos bay outpost,"
6605956,kceureka,2021-10-26 10:10:00,3,"We fished with Mattice Lake Outfitters for several years, including their outpost on the south shore of Lake Mojikit. (Best natural shelter for a dock you'll ever find!) We had some very good walleye fishing in the south narrows and around some of the Islands. If the wind is out of the north, however, the waves get big fast. Wanting to explore more of Ogoki Reservoir, and have more protected water, we next booked Ogoki Frontier at their Mojikit Channel lodge. We had some good fishing there, including a 47"" pike, but as others have noted, you will lose a lot of jigs in Ogoki Reservoir! We were the first group into the Mojikit Channel south outpost that year. The camp was just not ready for prime time. Water heater failed. Three of our motors quit on us, some while a long way from camp. We decided to relocate to another outfitter for 2020, but were stymied by the pandemic. Happy to offer some recommendations for spots to fish on Mojikit - Ogoki. There is a LOT of water to fish. Tight lines."

If I do, I'd like to spend my dollars where I used to spend them...with MLO. My wife has never fished in Canada. I'd like to introduce her to fishing as it's supposed to be. It appears MLO has reduced their offerings to 2 or 3 camps. I don't blame them a bit. Has anybody fished at Ogoki, Whitewater, or Short lake/reservoir this or last year? Are Don and Annette still providing the quality fishing experience they did years ago? Thanks in advance"
6604000,Eckohlt,2021-10-16 05:19:00,3685,"My only advice if taking the wife is stay away from the lakes with flooded timber,might frustrate her being hung up a lot,which would include ogoki n short,just my thoughts,she will love it up there."
6604022,phishfearme,2021-10-16 06:51:00,1242,"Hey jigman, welcome back! yah, don elliott has indeed sold many of his LUP's - he told us that ""his clients are dying away and there's few new one's to replace them"". Part of our group went to Ogoki Reservoir a month ago - you can see their trip report at the link below. Take heed to what Eckhold says about snags - you can read more on LarryS's post:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...=Ogoki+mattice a place you may want to consider to go to with the wife would be Thousand Lakes outposts - Don Elliott does their flying. for two people, the stonehouse lake cabin from which you can access kearns lake (which is among the best fishing lakes in Ontario) would be nice. (you will probably need 6 to get into the Kearns Lake Taj Mahall cabin.) I've posted three trip repots on Kearns - the first is below. their web site is - thousandlakesoutposts.com best of luck, phishhttps://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ht=kearns+lake"

6604228,Bstar,2021-10-17 07:34:00,564,"Boreal Forest Outfitters in Nakina bought several MLO camps a couple of years ago. We went to their Melchett Lake camp in 2018 right after they bought it and had a great time. They're a nice young couple and we wouldn't hesitate going back with them again. That being said, we have kind of found a home with Slate Falls Outposts in Sioux Lookout. We've done three trips with them most recently to their Arc Lake outpost in August and had a great time. It's a walleye factory that holds some big pike also. Brand new cabin and Ryan provides the service that you were accustomed to with MLO."
6604240,Larry S,2021-10-17 10:09:00,665,Mattice didn't have Melchett Lake to sell to Boreal They must have picked it up from some other outfitter Larry S
6604254,adempsey2.0,2021-10-17 12:42:00,611,It used to be owned by Arctic Watershed Outposts.
6604294,jigman2003,2021-10-17 19:11:00,15,"Thanks to everyone who responded, I do appreciate it. I realize Ogoki is a challenging place to fish. I fished it a few times years ago and remember going through 100 or more jigs in a week. It may not be the best place to take a novice fisherperson. I don't think I want to wade through all of the new resort owners/offerings and try to come up with a place to go. I'm totally out of touch with Canadian fishing/resorts.I was hoping MLO still had Pringle Lake. I fished that lake with my Dad 4 or 5 times and always enjoyed it. Pretty easy lake to figure out and not that challenging ""gear wise"". Does anybody know what outfitter (if any) has that lease now?***never mind on the Pringle lake question. I see Thunderhook has it now and it's a 4 person minimum."
6604308,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-10-18 01:10:00,358,Talk to the Thunderhook owners. Four person minimum can be unimportant if a cabin sits empty. Most outpost owners would rather have two paying customers than none.
