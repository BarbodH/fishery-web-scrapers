6605316,LoDo,2021-10-23 07:56:00,721,"A few of us guys pooled our cash together and purchased land, built a cabin, few boats in NW Ontario. A dream come true! I called the border last year and asked the process for bringing supplies, furnishings, equipment, etc.. across the border. A 5% tax would apply to all furnishing staying in Canada. No used mattresses allowed. Easy enough. I called early Sept 2021 and again two days before we arrived to remind them of our names, dates and approx time crossing the border. On 9/30, myself and one other owner crossed the border in a 20' UHAUL. It was a Thurs at dinner hour. The Int Falls/Ft Francis border was as quiet as i've ever experienced. We pulled up, put the vehicle in park, shut the UHaul off. The border agent asked multiple questions on Covid. This was the primary concern. One question on what was in the UHaul. She told us to pull forward to the left, park and come in inside to pay duty on booze and furnishings. We thought 100%, this is where a team of agents would come out and search the UHaul. THIS NEVER HAPPENED! We crossed the border with a 20' UHaul and the back door was never opened??? I've mentioned this story on another thread with little details. Does the border have infrared technology? Serious question. Why would the border not open our Uhaul? Who knows what I could've had in that back. Let your imagination go... The next 6hrs on our drive we asked ourselves, why wouldnt they open our Uhaul? Where is the priority? Covid was far more important than what was inside a 20' Uhaul? Regardless, we got to our destination, furnishings on a barge, went to our cabin for the first time. Great trip!!"
6605322,Wawajake,2021-10-23 08:08:00,413,"I find your complaint a little funny, because if they had opened your u haul and went thru it very carefully and delayed you for an hour or two, you would of probably posted here and complained about a needless delay....meanwhile what probably happened was their computers name search saw your pattern of crossings over the years was innocent fishing or hunting etc , and you presented yourself responsibly, so they let you thru without putting you thru the wringer.....say thanks for their professionalism and that you got to enjoy your visit."
6605326,LoDo,2021-10-23 08:18:00,721,"Let me point out, there was zero complaining. Trust me. We crossed with our border bar pizza from Int Falls thinking we'd be eating pizza on the picnic table as border patrol did their search. We 100% anticipated them to go through our UHaul and we were expecting over an hour delay. Again, zero complaints, just curious as to why they didn't, at minimum, open the door? And yes, I'm guessing they saw the annual patterns, where we go, zero previous issues, etc.. I wouldnt have had a negative post on this site as it was expected. Lastly, I'd prefer the Canadian border and US border to, at minimum, ""professionally"" open the UHaul door."
6605328,Wallychowder,2021-10-23 08:28:00,1567,"I would of said , Hey"" just out of curiosity, aren't you going to even roll the back door up and look inside&#x1f914;"
6605372,Yellowfin123,2021-10-23 09:38:00,2182,"crossing at baudette on 10/5 at about 8am, guy was nice but i did see the box with about 10-12 little blue boxes in it behind him, and of course we were handed 2 boxs dang it.. got thru that, dropped at a auto repair place and off we went, came home thru int falls.. coming and going it looked like i was the only one in america going to canada that day.. and both ways not 1 word about my expired passport, nota word!"
6605376,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-23 09:45:00,8293,I'm sure there are X-Ray machines around. In fact they just confiscated 1000 knock off pizza ovens entering the country (USA). I would assume Canada has the same protections.
6605412,Eckohlt,2021-10-23 12:42:00,3685,So if there was a pizza in each oven they ate very well that day and so forth.
6605424,Wallychowder,2021-10-23 13:32:00,1567,especially if they were Pothole pizza's !
6605436,Eckohlt,2021-10-23 14:23:00,3685,If the ovens were a knock off then I'm sure the pizza's were Tostino's or roma
6605620,Bill Krejca,2021-10-24 18:21:00,6107,"Yeah, my thinking also. Bill"
