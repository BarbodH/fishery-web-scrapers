I think I would go one step further and say that any time you spend on the water (especially with good electronics) will make you a better angler. I think back to our first Canada trip some 20 years ago when we were all novices at fishing the Canadian shield lakes. The lodge owner gave us a hand-drawn map of the lake with a few key spots marked. Everyone goes to those spots and everyone catches fish. Easy peasy. Since then we have picked apart the entire lake, studied the contour map (which wasn't available 20 years ago), and found a bunch more spots to fish. We varied our techniques and shared what we learned with one another. Each time we go to Canada we learn something new and refine our techniques. It's not rocket science. The depths and locations of the fish change with time of year, temperature, and weather. Go with the flow, vary your techniques and depths, apply what you've learned over the years, and catch 'em up."
6609120,kswalleyer,2021-11-11 05:44:00,1651,"I agree. Going to a place loaded with fish and getting my confidence up and developing a feel with lot of different techniques always has made me better. I did this with ponds and bass fshing when I was younger. I'd see a technique, get good with it on a farm pond then take it to the reservoir. game changer really. same with back country fly fishing as well as fishing in canada and bringing that back as far south as Arkansas. Walleyes down here eat the same techniques as up north, there is just not as many of them."
6609126,prov1800,2021-11-11 05:57:00,5010,Agreed.Getting dumped in the middle of nowhere cant be beat.
6606462,gordy28,2021-10-29 07:46:00,437,I am guessing most of us fish in our home waters as well as trips to Canada For me its when I am at the cottage with the family and I may get an hour or two to head out for a fish Pre taking remote trips I would have considered myself a novice walleye fisherman and not a pike fisherman at all. I mainly fished one lake and it was far from a shield lake - I was a one trick pony After being fortunate enough to head out on fishier waters these last 15 years or so I think I have become a better fishermen and I am still learning each and every trip My gut says most of us do Anyway here is my post on a few of the reasons I think these trips have helpedhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/h...fishing-skills Cheers Andrew
6606546,RichA$1970,2021-10-29 15:34:00,1159,"Interesting take and I guess I’m the opposite as I have seen a lot of “Big City Fisherman” catch a lot of fish on stacked Sunset Lakes. Not bashing them and I’m no expert, but the last 2 years I fished my childhood lake (Leech Lake) and had to work for what I caught which I think made me better and appreciate the catch there. I do agree that based on the excellent fisheries Ontario has to offer, you can play around more and still slay them. I think most would agree a bad day on an Ontario lake is better than a good day on a US Northwoods lake. Also you don’t have to worry about bumper boats on a fly in and have an entourage anchor near you when the bite is on."
6606644,gordy28,2021-10-30 07:30:00,437,"It's a fair point. I would agree that fishing on those remote lakes is much easier than at home (for me high pressured lakes near Toronto) But I think I learn more in those trips because I spend so much more time on the water and also have more confidence to try new techniques Basically when fished the higher pressured lakes pre trips I tended to cycle between tried and true spots regardless of time of year or weather and generally stayed with confidence baits Post trips I have more knowledge of new baits or styles that I built confidence in and I have fished in more weather systems, more types of lakes and generally been able to add more tricks to my repertoire so to speak So for me I truly do think fry trips have helped me become a better angler"
6606648,RichA$1970,2021-10-30 07:36:00,1159,"Regardless, I think most agree being on a remote lake in Canada is the best fishing."
6606664,7 Mag,2021-10-30 08:20:00,1887,"Leech has definitely changed, it's becoming a tough lake to fish."
6606812,gordy28,2021-10-31 08:27:00,437,Agree that walleye fishing is better on those remote lakes for sure!
6606826,NM_Trout,2021-10-31 10:53:00,1094,"I agree. For me, the fly in trips are almost 100% of waking hours spent are spent fishing. Spending over 80 hours on 7 days fishing gives me a lot of time to practice and learn new techniques. Having stupid fish around makes it a lot more fun. I learned how to double haul an 8wt fly rod with a deer hair bug on a lake in Canada, and that casting style serves me well even when using a 4wt rod on my local waters."
6607210,MrSimon,2021-11-02 07:55:00,922,"Catching walleye and pike at a good fly-in lake takes a certain set of skills. They are relatively easy skills to acquire though and little kids can often out-fish the seasoned guys. Once you learn the basics of jigging for walleye and casting for pike, there isn't a whole lot more to learn. Sure you can tweak things a bit and experiment, but it ain't rocket science. Personally I've found that the technical skills needed in Canada don't transfer very well to my local waters in Pennsylvania."
6607316,Bigtaproot,2021-11-02 18:59:00,900,"Agreed, except for Anonymouse, it doesn't seem like any of us are in danger of being accepted to Harvard. The goal in fishing is to have fun"
6607340,Eckohlt,2021-11-03 04:29:00,3685,"The more you go to Canada the more you will learn,so get up there often if you can."
