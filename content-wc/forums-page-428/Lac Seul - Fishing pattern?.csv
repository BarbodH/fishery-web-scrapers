1448859,IMSPIKE,2012-06-13 12:59:00,12,Fished out of ear falls area last week. The fish were still moving out of their spawning areas with some already in the deeper spots. Most of our fish came out of 3-8 ft of water. But not on live bait rigs. We slayed them casting crankbaits. Best bait Blue and silver husky jerk. Lots of pics and videos to come on walleyewisdom.com
