Coming back the U.S. border person said he needed to see something with the vehicle's VIN number on it. I had a copy of the vehicle purchase agreement and he checked it out and I assume punched in the VIN number into his computer system. All very professional and it took only an extra minute or two. I had the impression that it is a rather common situation.I would take some document showing that you purchased the vehicle and which identifies the vehicle's VIN number."
