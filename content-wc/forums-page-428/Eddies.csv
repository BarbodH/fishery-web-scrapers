1448656,deputy dog,2012-06-13 06:56:00,305,With water levels being so low last year the enormous amounts of rain this year should probably bring the levels back close to normal....hopefully they stay there for a while.
1441191,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-27 09:13:00,151,Yes. Was @ Kirk Isle last year for the first time. What a great place. We'll be going to either Clarkie or Kirk Isle next year and if the schedule work's out then both. I'm getting in the habit of making 2 trips a year now. Jim is building a new cabin @ Kirk which I believe is ongoing as we speak. You should see the new 'Palace' he built on Evans last year. It is a new camp that replaced SW Bay. Unbelieveable facility.
1441192,adempsey,2012-05-27 09:14:00,963,"Look for Attawapiskat Lake in Google Maps, both camps are near there. One is on Beteau Lake to the east and the other on Richter lake to the south."
1441202,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-27 09:26:00,151,Hmmm...looks like a nice size body of water. Similar to Evans? Are you the only ones on it or are their multiple camps? And the 1st question: How's the fishing? Depths? Equipment (Lunds & Yamaha's)?
1441227,deputy dog,2012-05-27 10:07:00,305,"Only camps on both, beteau has only been open for 3 year and last year was first for ricter. Not as big as Evans but fishing is as good. Gonna take some time to learn it like we knew Evans but so far awesome. Only able to fish prolly 1/2 lake last year with the water levels and still did great! Top notch equipment and outfitter, Eddie, stays at camp with you. Satellite tv an wifi as well as phone available. That drive up the James bay highway was brutal.....good luck with your trips!!!"
1441685,EddieNorth,2012-05-28 15:37:00,32,"We have had a ton of rain and 5 inches of snow the last week .The water level has risen 4 feet the last 4 days and is still rising.Cheers all,Eddie"
1441760,Mike Borger,2012-05-28 18:11:00,1554,Wow that's crazy.Hopefully the lads are still able to swing a hammer.
1441765,RickOnt,2012-05-28 18:19:00,217,Eddie4' in 4 Days!! that's just Crazy!!
1447552,deputy dog,2012-06-11 05:46:00,305,"Leavin in 10 days....any updates, trip reports....."
1447947,Guest,2012-06-11 17:54:00,0,The water was up 6-8ft when i was there two weeks ago. All i've seen for the past week is rain there. Shoot Ed a call for a report.
1448397,Smettsio,2012-06-12 14:25:00,3,Sounds like tough weather up there for a few weeks. How was the fishin? Change of tactics for such high water?
1438467,GOBIG,2012-05-21 15:05:00,126,Anyone going to eddie north? Looking for some reports. Thank you.
1438557,deputy dog,2012-05-21 18:28:00,305,"June 23-30, hopin water levels are up to near normal..."

1439098,Smettsio,2012-05-22 16:27:00,3,"Oh yeahhhhh! Two of us headed to Eddies June 16th. That's 25 and a wakeup. Many restless days and nights till then along with a good (?) 22 hour drive from Cincinnati, Ohio and Rockton, Illinois. Can NOT wait...eh!Lookin forward to meeting a great group of others that week suffering from pikeosis, taking the cure at Eddies. Who's gonna be there with us the week of the 16th? That 100 lb limit is just for tackle, right? Nah, just kiddin', but I've been havin a great time stocking up on some lures and baits that look pretty stupid down here in the midwest. Heh heh heh,.... there's gonna be some very surprised and very mad fish yankin' and shakin' on those rods as they come up to meet Mr. Lund and Ms Naden. Did I mention, can NOT wait?"
1440882,deputy dog,2012-05-26 07:31:00,305,"Wanted to pass this along, got an email from Eddie last nite and water levels are good. Lots of rain and 6"" of snow yesterday!!! Leavin June 21.....tick, tick, tick....."
1441175,5 of Diamonds,2012-05-27 08:39:00,151,deputy dog:Where exactly is Eddie's? Can't seem to find a reliable answer on the internet (must be a great spot!). We're heading 3 hours north of Matagami this Thu 30 May. Your weather report intrigued me. Thanks.
1441179,tooski,2012-05-27 08:46:00,393,Your calendar intrigues me.
