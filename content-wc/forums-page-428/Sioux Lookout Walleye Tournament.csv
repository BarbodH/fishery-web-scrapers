Hope someone reports on what was caught as well as what is the water level like on Minnitaki and are fish shallow or moving onto the humps and bars already."
1447365,stevestevesteve,2012-06-10 16:28:00,1,"I would appreciate any information as well, as our group is headed up in a week!!! This will be our first year staying on Minnitaki. Have stayed at Mahkwa in the past and decided to switch it up this year."
1448578,gfish,2012-06-12 21:16:00,23,"We would appreciate any sharing as well. Our group will going up for year #3 in about a week and a half, and will be looking for 'eyes and lakers. We are very curious about water levels as well, as last year we saw a lot of unmarked rocks......"
1448582,TroyMansfield,2012-06-12 21:23:00,92,"water levels are high on minnitaki and are still on the rise, the fish just transiotioned to the humps and reefs out in the big water, but you cans till pull them out of the weed lines, dont be afraid to fish deep, some days you have to got 47ft to find the eyes, and you carch big trout too, let me know if you need a guide, I may be available"
1448584,gfish,2012-06-12 21:29:00,23,Awesome - thanks for the reply - we may want to take you up on your offer to get into some lakers - how would we contact you?
1448997,yurtman,2012-06-13 19:27:00,46,"finished 10th this year so we did manage to find fish. most of ours were in 10-14 feet of water on windward rocky shelves close to shore. we did find fish on humps and flats in 25-40 feet but the catching was slow(er) and not any better than in shallower water.bottom bouncers with a crawler harness and a spinner caught the most fish but a b/bouncer with a leech was close behind. in the deeper water minnows seemed to work better. not many big ones - most of those caught weighed 3 1/2 to 4#. only one over 5#.surprising how many teams couldn't find the 3 under 18"" fish they needed - we found lots but the majority for some reason seem to be 18 1/2"" to 21"" - all in the no keeper slot who knows what a week or two later will do. fish are where ya find 'em!"
