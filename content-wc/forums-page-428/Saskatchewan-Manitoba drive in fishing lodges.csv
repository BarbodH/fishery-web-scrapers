1447225,Tippytop1,2012-06-10 10:03:00,1,I live in Wyoming and have often used Canadian fly in fishing services with pretty good luck. However it's now difficult to get several folks together for a trip. I am now looking for reasonably priced places to fish walleye and northern in Saskatchewan or Manitoba. Please advise and thank you.
1447241,wmd,2012-06-10 10:29:00,388,"Three Lakes Lodge , Jan Lake, Slims Cabins, Churchill River, Pawastik Lodge on the Sturgeon Weir River. Have fished all three systems, Jan may be the most productive it is a management Lake. Pawastik is on a great little river but too much work to fish, have to portage either up or down river, great adventure when I was young, not so much anymore. Our group had issues with Slims, while fishing was good problems were no fun, however I know people that ahve gone there for years and got along just fine. Check out their web sites.wmd"
1447249,Angwalleye,2012-06-10 10:52:00,27,Just got home from Davin Lake Lodge in northern Saskatchewan. Outstanding fishing great accommodations and value. Irvin and Diana were a pleasure to stay with. Was my first trip there but will be heading back next year. Would go back just for the food!

Footprint lake has alot of master trout and then there's little limestone lake clear clean and green water due to the limestone awesome place. Look up moaks lodge as a place to start."
1447579,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-11 07:06:00,803,"Baker's Narrows resort is located on Lake Athapapuskow which is home to some of the countries best fishing for lake trout (numbers abound and big girls are plentiful enough). There is also great pike fishing on this lake, which is a nice big body of water that has plenty of Islands to allow for comfort even on windy days. Athapap is also a decent lake for trophy walleye if you are willing to spend the time. There are also a gazillion other smaller lakes in the area that have that nice tea stain, that can offer great fishing for pike, and walleye as well. I live in this region and can't say enough about the fishing. Send me a PM if you do plan on coming up and I can give you fishing lakes, and fishing spots on those lakes, as well as some general do's and don'ts. http://www.bakersnarrowslodge.com/"
1447827,Angwalleye,2012-06-11 13:05:00,27,When was the last time you were up to Davin?

Located in Saskatchewan across the border from Flin Flon, Manitoba. Good value and friendly people. Lots of ND, SD and WY people there."
