1448689,Bigstorm,2012-06-13 07:49:00,799,I've had some luck on the Northland Rattling Buckshot spoons in the past as well.
1448269,RapShad,2012-06-12 10:22:00,76,Has anyone used Jigging Raps (not through the ice) with success? Any tips on how to use them would be nice as well. Considering taking a couple up.
1448316,jsmyers,2012-06-12 12:02:00,198,"I haven't done it, but I found out that they use them in Fontana Lake near the Smokies in NC. The information I had was about targeting trout with them, but the lake also has walleyes.I was thinking that they might be useful for jigging summer lakers in ON."
1448324,hawg,2012-06-12 12:15:00,2008,You must have seen that Lindner show? Looks pretty strange to me.
1448332,RapShad,2012-06-12 12:38:00,76,"Yup, I think I'll try out a firetiger and maybe a shiny color. I don't see why they wouldn't work, what works for the Linders works for me."
1448386,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-12 14:02:00,109,"I've done it here in Minnesota, and it works great. They can be jigged vertically if you find a school of fish, and they're surprisingly effective drifting or slow trolling, giving the jig a periodic snap to let its trademark action work. Definitely something worth checking out if you want to try something new."
1448388,adempsey,2012-06-12 14:10:00,963,"I've only used them ice fishing for perch/whitefish/trout. Basically,you vertically jig them but also give them a VERY subtle ""tick tick tick"" just off the lake bottom to mimic a feeding minnow. So, in open water it has to be calm or you need to be anchored to be able to do this.I find that many ice fishing jigs have no real action. You must provide the action. This works fine as long as you're not moving and the lure goes straight down to the lake bottom. If you're blowing along in open water your lure is going to be at a 45+ degree angle and you cannot give these lures the the same type of action. Perhaps the Rapala ice jigs have enough action with that little plastic tail, I don't know. I guess it never hurts to try!You could consider trying a Northland Buckshot Spoon as well. They work well for ice walleye."
1448389,octanehi5,2012-06-12 14:12:00,1104,I have a few packed and ready to go. on that show they worked great instead of jigs use the jigging rap. put a worm on the treble hooksand away you go
1448482,RapShad,2012-06-12 17:13:00,76,Bob (love the arrested developement reference) what size do you typically use?
1448491,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-12 17:34:00,109,3/16 oz for water less than 25' deep; i'll occasionally use the larger one if i'm fishing deeper or if perch are harassing me too much. perch pattern has been by far the best producer for me.
1448495,octanehi5,2012-06-12 17:36:00,1104,"#9 about 3 1/2 "" We will fish these against the regular jigs to see how they do in te same conditions"
