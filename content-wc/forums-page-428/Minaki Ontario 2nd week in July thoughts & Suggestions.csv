1448780,Slashorn,2012-06-13 10:25:00,19,Our group is fishing Minaki during the second week in July. We were there during the the Third Week in August last year and found: Walleyes were tough to get in the morning over deep rock piles on clear hot days (however saw the thread re go shallow so will try that this year is experience same) No flys/gnats/bugs on the boat at all Black and orange mepps #5 was the ticket for pike Black Dble Cowgirl got me musky follows Now for July: what are thoughts/suggestions regarding: 1) bugs - there or not there (in minaki) bad or not bad 2) good spots/bad spots? 3) Big Sand or Pistol or Rough Rock? Thanks !
