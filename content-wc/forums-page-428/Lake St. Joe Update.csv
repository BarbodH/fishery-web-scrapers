We caught most of our walleyes in the 6 to 12 feet of water. Biggest walleye was 26"", numerous in the 18"" to 22"" range. Northern's were had to come by, the biggest was 39.5 and was caught while jigging for walleyes."
1448347,stjoeguy,2012-06-12 13:09:00,979,Thanks for the update. We're heading up there in 10 days. I've been watching the water level rise and hope it continues.
1448566,TroyMansfield,2012-06-12 20:45:00,92,"I will say the water will be rising fast for awhile, we recieved a bunch of rain here in the last week and a half and we are looking to get more rain this week up to another 2 inches maybe in the forecast, minnitaki, abram and connecting lakes are on the rise big time and will be probably rising another 12-18 inches before it peaks. so we dont need any more rain in sioux lookout, but maybe about 88 air miles north we can use some more."
1448572,gfish,2012-06-12 21:13:00,23,"That's great to hear, as we will be going up to Minnitaki in a week and a half. How has the fishing on this chain been so far?"
1448587,TroyMansfield,2012-06-12 21:33:00,92,"the fishing has been great, a little off and on last weekend with the thunderstorms rolling thorugh, but the fish are moving out to the humps and are between 20 to 50 ft, and on shorelines and bays 4-15, if you need any guiding or help let me know"
