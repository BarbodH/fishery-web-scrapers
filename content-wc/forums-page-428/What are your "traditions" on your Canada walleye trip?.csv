1448591,Steve of Madison,2012-06-12 21:43:00,230,"Saw this thread and just needed to join in on the fun. My tradition is a very private one. My father used to take a water glass from the cabin, go out in the boat alone, fill it with a shot of Weisers and some lake water. Then take a good hearty drink and pour the rest overboard ""a toast to the fishing gods"" he would say.Since 2001 I have been doing my part to keep that tradition alive without him. Rest in Peace ""Pop's""."
1448608,spikeidji,2012-06-12 23:15:00,10,Stop in Dryden's Gas Bar and Supermarket. Pick up some Presidents Grape Soda for the trip. Then off to Hubers Lone Pine Lodge for a Terrific German Meal and Fine German Bier! Get some Sleep and then on to Lac Seul.
1447740,Guest,2012-06-11 11:20:00,0,"you definitely win the thread. no matter how much i try to draw the comparison of fishing tackle is to men as shoes are to women, they wont ever understand. im 2 days out from my trip and finishing up the ""honey do"" list. the only difference from your trip and mine is that i host the night before. so i get to listen to the wife complain about how late we are up drinking beer."
1447759,Bigstorm,2012-06-11 11:46:00,799,"Every year, we always stop at the Sawmill in Virginia MN for lunch on the way up, its just over the half way point so good place to stretch for a bit. From there we finish the trip and are at the cabin by 8PM. Then we proceed to drink too many, go to bed late and wake up ready to go fishing.We usually fish unitl after 10PM, and once we get back to the cabin, we cook it up, play some cards and go to bed looking forward to doing the same thing the next day."
1447809,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-11 12:35:00,235,"There's a sign on the highway nearby that just says ""Bong Recreation Area."" That wording means something completely different to most people who aren't familiar with the heroics of Richard Bong."
1447901,nitroman,2012-06-11 15:59:00,368,"I have a hat,sweatshirt,and Zippo lighter that have been on every trip. When i get home I pack em away till the next year! We also stop at the Black Bear and the T Patten cafe on every trip! The Zippo is 23 years old I got it after basic training and ironicly my oldest just left for basic today, every day last week i thought about it when i used it!"
1447994,bigwalleye1,2012-06-11 19:28:00,2632,"Thank, and please thank your son for us all when you speak with him again. It is the sacrifice of few that allows us to pursue our dreams on the water, and in all aspects of our lives. As for traditions, breakfast in the Falls at Shore Lunch Cafe then slip across the border."
1448020,JayM5209,2012-06-11 20:24:00,1050,Shore Lunch Cafe is always lunch for us when coming home Saturday. My crew eats fish seven nights running. You should see them order up the beef when they hit the Shore Lunch!
1448060,nd89sc88,2012-06-11 21:38:00,92,"We always leave from my dads place in NW WI. He always wants to drive, but only to the Perkins in Superior for breakfast. I always have to drive over the bridge. We also always stop at he Safeway in Fort Frances. Final provisions always include a package of Mallomars. They are only consumed in Canada on a boat. Not sure why . . . Bill"
1448088,Sidge61,2012-06-12 04:01:00,59,At some point after one of our shore lunches as we are leaving to start fishing all the boats will engage in a circus peanut fight. It is so funny seeing 2-3 boats throwing circus peanuts at each other. They float and you should see people scramble to grab them out of the water as they float. One of these times I might try one as bait.
1448244,RapShad,2012-06-12 09:38:00,76,We always bring up two HUGE boxes of Tootsie Pops we picked up at Sam's Club. Not sure when we started doing this. But when fishing gets slow or we have a long trip back to the boat launch nothing beats a Tootsie Pop. We have a lot of similar traditions that have been posted but this is probably one that most people don't do.
1448427,jambi,2012-06-12 15:00:00,504,Seeing the 502 conditions report reminds me of our tradition - Peeing on the 502!
1446767,wallydave,2012-06-08 18:11:00,2151,"At least one morning, usually the first at camp. I meet the rising sun with a cup of coffee and a Cuban cigar. Nothing like the promise of a day on the water lying before you. The mist rising from the lake, meets the steam from the coffee. The smoke from the cigar just adds to visual effect, they all rise together with the rays of the dawn. Nothing like a Canadian morning! !"
1446842,KTroller,2012-06-08 23:19:00,237,"And after the coffee and the Cuban, if you're like me Dave, shortly thereafter you drop the morning Deuce in the latrine and are off onto the water. :-)KT"
1446864,wallydave,2012-06-09 05:10:00,2151,"LOL yea the deuce is a daily ritual, but even that ritual seems some how better when in CANADA!!!"
1446866,PRO-V1,2012-06-09 05:27:00,142,Now thats funny.............. Mike
1446985,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-09 13:40:00,235,"Agreed. The outhouse at our outpost usually faces the lake. Due to smell, the door is usually left open while you do your business - it is nice to have the lake view during that time. Just don't like dealing with the bugs."
1447413,Gipper,2012-06-10 18:36:00,76,"I love this question.My first trip was 1954 and departure was 0200 from Waukegan, Il north up hwy 12 (no freeways) to the Dells for all-you-can-eat breakfast at the original Paul Bunyans.Same restaurants up and back for the seven years which I can't quite remember them all.Lac Des Mille Lacs...........always.Last 6 years several USAF buddies from around the country hook up with me in southern WI for a trip to Cedar Lake, Some traditions developing but kinda weak now, mostly involving beer and fish wagering.This stuff is priceless and we will die one at a time doing it."
1447437,Golden Eagle,2012-06-10 19:26:00,2642,"Gipper, have you visited the Richard Bong Veteran's Historical Center in Superior? When I was there they had 4 guys manning the front desk who were WWII veterans. They had some super stories. Great guys. I'm speaking English because of guys like them."
1447457,Gipper,2012-06-10 20:06:00,76,"No I haven't and did not know it was there. It may interest you that I live 20 minutes away from the Richard Bong Recreation area in Kenosha County, This was originally planned to be Bong Air Force Base. It's mission was to provide fighter-interceptor support for Milwaukee and Chicago. The plan was overcome by events and transformed into a rec area.You are correct that heroes like Bong, a brave lad from Superior, are the reason we not only speak english but have the freedom and resources to play in Canada. Folks nowadays don't get it.My boys and I will stop in on July 13 on the way in. Thanks."
1447709,Kmanster,2012-06-11 10:50:00,26,"(I can't believe that I'm the only one with this tradition?????)Here's how it starts:(One month before)-Listen to the wife complain about the money I've spent on tackle for the trip.(2 weeks out)-Listen to the wife complain about the additional money I spent on more tackle for the trip again.(1 week out)-Listen to the wife remind me of the ""Honey Do's"" that must be completed before the trip.(2 days out)-complete the list of ""Honey Do's"" and listen to wife complain about my pile of gear in the game room.(1 day out)-Drop gear at buddy's house to be loaded onto trailer.-Listen to wife complain about how long I've been at his house drinking beer.88 days and counting"
1447725,new hips,2012-06-11 11:04:00,498,"One we have done for years...........If the night is clear, can't go to bed until you spot at least 2 satellites crossing the night sky."
1446099,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-07 08:26:00,298,"Everyday when my wife and I get back to camp from fishing she immediately heads for the cabin while I go to the fish house to clean supper. She fixes drinks for both of us and then drives back to the fish house and brings me my drink. When she walks thru the door and hands it to me the comments and looks on the other guys faces (especially the ones with wives in camp) is ""priceless""."
1446155,Babamel2,2012-06-07 10:52:00,414,one of the traditions that used to be done by a group I knew about. was that a person could not shave until they caught a walleye
1446177,Guest,2012-06-07 11:51:00,0,"a prize goes out to whoever lasts longest into the week without doing a #2. we tent camp for a week and live on shore lunches, so its not the most pleasant experience. also, whoever catches the biggest fish on the trip gets a wall mounted trophy as bragging rights for a year until the next trip."
1446184,Lovetofish,2012-06-07 12:24:00,458,Another tradition is our all-camp meal one night. We have a big group which will be about 30 people for this summers trip. We eat on our own for the most part but for the feed every family brings a dish to pass and we make fish about 4 different ways. Then those of us still able try to beat the kids in a whiffle ball game.
1446208,JayM5209,2012-06-07 13:13:00,1050,"Each day my group observes a solemn religious ceremony in camp. The first five or six years (starting in 1979) several of the guys brought their own case of beer along. In asddition, one of the guys always brought a bottle of spirits to pass around. Where he got some of that kerosene-like stuff I'll never know. The one specific I remember is the year of Yukon Jack. Finally I decided that if there's to be a bottle to pass around, it should be sippable, so I started bringing a fifth of Old Grandad bourbon. Grandad has accompanied us each year for at least 25 now.When we get to camp and the trucks are unloaded, rods are rigged, and everyone's ready to get on the water, I break the seal and the Old Grandad gets passed around the group for a sip per person - accompanied by appropriate whispered incantations to the gods of the water invoking their kindness and mercies for the week. Then, every evening when the last boat has straggled back to camp, but before going to the fish house, Grandad goes around again with several ""Great day of fishin'"" comments or some other appropriate acknowledgement of the gifts the spirits of the waters have granted us.We used to pass the bottle for the last time Friday evening, with the sips being very, very small! Don't know why, but in recent years there's been dust at the bottom of the bottle by about Thursday.P.S. In those early years several in our group brought a case or two of beer along (per person). Now only two of us remain from the original gang, and the other three or four are newcomers of only 10 or 12 years running. I always bring a 12 pack of Pacifico along for the group . . . . . and by Friday evening there's always four or five bottles to leave on the cabin table for the camp owner."
1446220,Golden Eagle,2012-06-07 13:40:00,2642,Is that Grandad strong enough to kill off whatever comes with the backwash?
1446270,JayM5209,2012-06-07 14:56:00,1050,"The 100 Proof is!! But I never buy that, only the 80 Proof for me. My preferred way is on the rocks with just a splash of water, and s-l-o-w-l-y sipped while rocking on the porch . . . . preferably looking out over a Canadian Shield lake when the loons are calling!For the camp ritual, even the 80 Proof will take care of anything left on the bottle before it got to you. . . . at least, I've never noticed any ill effects!"
1446386,Bill Krejca,2012-06-07 20:15:00,6107,"I didn't know that Yukon Jack could be drank any other way than by passing the bottle around. Also, I didn't know they made anything other than 100 proof. Bill"
1446425,Guest,2012-06-07 21:29:00,0,We get drunk for five days and argue and then pass out then get back on the plane and look forward to next year
1446718,jas4412,2012-06-08 14:59:00,15,I take 2 cases of beer across the border and then I buy 2 more cases of Canadian beer.... I don't know what I would do if I went on a trip longer than 4 days!!
1445436,btmbncr,2012-06-05 23:31:00,492,"My late father hated to throw the first walleye back(unless it was a dink),He said it caused bad Ju Ju with the rest of the fish.No can eat anything in the boat until walleyes are caught.You must take coffee along in the boat to insure a good bite.Walleyes over 6 lbs can be induced to bite by drinking coffee and having a chocolate chip cookie.He loved Lake of the Woods,Lake Seul,Berry Lake and the English River by Halley's Camp.He was a big walleye magnet."
1445437,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-06-05 23:46:00,235,"Those of you who drive highway 53 in Minnesota towards International Falls will probably know of the big walleye statue right by the turn-off to Lake Kabetogama. That walleye has a saddle on it, and you can climb up some steps and actually sit in it like you're riding the walleye. We stop there on the way back, and whoever catches the biggest walleye will pose for a picture atop the giant walleye. Yes, it's kinda dumb, but it won't die. We'll stop even if its raining. One year, there was a tie for biggest walleye, so the two co-champions (both in their late 50's/early 60's) got on the one-man saddle together and rode the walleye with glee. Pretty fruity looking - I can only imagine what the passers by thought. I still crack a chuckle thinking about that."
1445456,wallydave,2012-06-06 05:16:00,2151,"On my first trip to Ontario I bought a wide brimmed hat at the hardware store in Ear Falls. Ever since that is the first day, first fish hat. Its getting pretty faded but it will be going fishin,g again this year! My wife will buy a fish themed t shirt for me too! The latest one is on top of the pile to be packed!"
1445843,Jiggin_Rob,2012-06-06 17:08:00,26,Pray to the walleye gods the night before departure around a firering burning in my back yard...
1445886,Bob_Loblaw,2012-06-06 18:49:00,109,Stopping at Tim Horton's in Dryden (usually at about 4am) has become a delicious tradition on the trip up to Savant Lake!
1446060,Lovetofish,2012-06-07 07:28:00,458,On the return drive we stop in Grand Marais for Sven & Ole's. After a week of fish the kids want pizza.
1446073,wallydave,2012-06-07 07:41:00,2151,"We used to stop at the VC every trip north on the 105. A shame it burned. Now we stop at Dutchies for Cuban cigars, Kokanee, and licenses. We stop again on the way home for dry ice. Nice folks, originally from Iowa, now living the dream!!"
1446077,LOW1,2012-06-07 07:48:00,2828,"The Great Chicken Contest. Immediately before departure one Canadian Looney is conspicuosly placed in a sun visor bracket of the travel vehicle. This is the prize money for whoever spots the first live chicken on the trip. (There are fewer visible live chickens out there than you think - recent winners have frequently come from small ""flocks"" spotted in towns. Just don't go into the otherwise great hardware store in Cloquet on Highway 33 - the darn place sells live chickens in early spring.)"
1446083,beerman69,2012-06-07 07:57:00,15,I like the Chicken Game on the drive up. Sounds like something that would keep my 12 year old sun busy on our 16 hour drive to Cochrane Air Services!!PS...He is soooo excited!
1446093,jimirjr,2012-06-07 08:11:00,1149,"WEIRD ONE but.... first trip up years ago, first day fishing was wiped out by torrential rain and wind. Ended up sitting it out in the houseboat. SO... being the camp chef, I cooked up MEATLOAF and HOT BREAD, VEGGIES etc.... for dinner. Skies cleared about 7:30 pm and We got out to fish a bit and Buddy gets a 44"" PIKE, I get a 25"" Walleye, My other Buddy gets a 5lb Smallie, all within a half hour...NEEDLESS to say, our first nite meal ALWAYS consists of MEATLOAF, BREAD and VEGGIES!"
