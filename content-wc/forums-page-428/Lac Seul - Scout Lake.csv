Any suggestion on the areas, islands or bays to focus on or how far away to roam? I am not sure if I will make it to the East side as that woudl be quite a daily hall.Thanks!"

Head out to the bay of islands, fish the humps, points, wind swept shorelines and you should be good to go. Remember the less time running the more time to fish. Do not be afraid to fish shallow in 4-6 feet. Now for the best info on SCL. The water depth off their large dock system is about 14 feet. Bring a slip bobber and a bunch of leeches and do the slip bobber thing and some days you will kill the eyes doing this very simple method. I will never forget the look on my son's face when he caught a 29"" eye off the dock. Say hey to Lizzie."

A map is helpful and GPS along with a Navionics chip is a huge plus."
