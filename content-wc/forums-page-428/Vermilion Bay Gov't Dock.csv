1448412,swany_jd,2012-06-12 14:42:00,9,Curious if the government dock in Vermilion Bay on Eagle Lake has an access fee to launch your boat? I know there are daily/weekly passes required up on Lac Seul public launches (Hudson/Deception Bay). I wasn't sure if that was specific to that area of lakes or if the pass was required on all Ontario lakes. Anyone know? Thanks.

Lac Seul permits are required because the city took control and will cite those without the permits. $30 fine. I did cross paths with one of the control agents last year and he and I had a great little chat. He also cleaned up the men's potty at Deception which had been hold trash for more than a year from those who travel to resorts (outposts ) and are too lazy to take out their own trash so they stowe it in the john. Please folks whether you are from the or not, Canadaian or American please leave it as you found it if not better. Thanks to all who do."
