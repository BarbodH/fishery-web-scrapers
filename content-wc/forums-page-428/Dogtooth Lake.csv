Not really Minnesota Vikings purple, more like the purple color of a Crown Royal bag. Don't know if you are familiar with that color or not?"
1443247,Guest,2012-05-31 14:58:00,0,"I have been up there about 13 years in a row but not going this year for many reasons. Mostly, it has become just too expensive for several in our group just to get there. Some have taken on new jobs with limited vacation time. Also, many of us became tired of the mice infested, run down outpost cabin. I think we trapped about 15 (two in one snap of a trap - crazy). If the mice were running wild laying their droppings everywhere, it made us wonder what other critters were crawling around. We did notice a drop in the level of service with the new management team running most of the day to day operations. Of course, it is hard to keep up the standard that Wayne and Patty set. It was strange though that when we didn't reserve for 2012, no one ever asked why. I guess our business was not that important? I am going to miss being on the lake chasing the trophy walleyes for sure. I've gotten to know that lake very well over 13 years and will always have the itch to ""hit the next' spot. There are so many to hit and so little time. Many great memories of this favorite lake! Best of luck to any Dogtooth fishermen out there. Keep a tight line and toss back a 30 incher and a cold Labatts for me!"

My usual boat mate uses a blue and silver lure called the blue doos and you can use it everywhere on that lake. This year he was unable to go and my fill in was sub par, we usually go in august but one of the guys coaches football so we go early now.The best thing about dogtooth is that every time you feel that tap, tap on your line it could be the 30"" walleye."

1448917,Guest,2012-06-13 15:16:00,0,"Sheriff (Randall), we use to exchange info on Dogtooth and I have some new stuff for you if you're looking for a new lake that has big fish. hopefully, by username you know how to get a hold of me."
