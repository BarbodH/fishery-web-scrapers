I've been up in NW Ontario where you can't go two feet without having to slap a mosquito off of your forehead, then other years you barely even see them. Same with the dreaded black flys and no see ums. Get a good bug spray with the highest amount of deet you can find. There's a few good threads going on that have plenty of advice."

Fewer bugs one main reason. Would I leave the spray at home--no way. Do I have several cans left over from previous years--most definitely. Only one year when mosquitos were bad-a very rainy week, but no black flies.Main reason for going that time of year weather is more predictable and so are the fish. Fish are less scattered and easier to target."
