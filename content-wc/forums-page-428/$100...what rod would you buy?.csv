1448240,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-12 09:31:00,803,"Due to this thread, I went to my local retail store and took a look at all the rods under 40$. I was actually amazed at the variety and quality of rods under 40$. There are quite a few from a bunch of companies that are light, sensitive enough and feel pretty good. I take a lot of people fishing, and often lend out equipment, So, I bought two along with two Shimano Sahara reels, and am super happy with the set ups I got. Now, I love my loomis jigging rods, and st. croix's, but one doesn't have to spend big bucks if they want to have a pleasant experience anymore. Technology is good out there."
1448249,Lovetofish,2012-06-12 09:51:00,458,I have 3 Fenwicks which I like. But I also have a couple $60 Guide Series rods from Gander and an Outfitter from Sheels that I like as well.
1448346,81Saluki,2012-06-12 13:09:00,97,"If you live near a Cabelas, Bass Pro Shops, or Scheels store ... I would recommend going with a store-branded model that has a fairly stiff shaft and sensitive tip. From personal experience, that's good for fish as big as a nice muskie all the way down to crappies/blue gills. Why a store-brand rod and not something like St. Croix or Ugly Stick? They sell for around $60-$90 and iIf you break it, the store will replace it for free on the spot (no shipping costs involved). We've broken 3 rods in recent years ... all were clearly our fault. Each was replaced for free at the store, no questions asked. Two were Cabelas rods and the other was a Scheels, but I understand that BPS has a similar ""you-break-it-and-we-replace-it"" policy. I'd give you the names/model numbers of our poles but they're at the cabin right now, awaiting our next visit later this month. Just my 2-cents, for what it's worth."
1448760,jswinter40,2012-06-13 09:54:00,127,bang for your buck. Cabelas Tourney Trail rod with shimano sedona reel. Do not chince on the reel! You will not regret it! shimano all the way and the sedona is hard to beat at that price point. personally i'd save $50 more bucks and get the St. Croix Eyecon with Shimano Sedona reel. If you have time i would wait to see if you can get a higher end cabelas rod (ie: prodigy or XML) in their Bargain Cave online. Some times they come way down in price.
1447397,Obabikon,2012-06-10 18:02:00,2370,"Yes... I lost one, and actually had the head eyelit crack on one of mine... could've figure out why my line kept cutting when I went to set the hook.... lost 2-3 fish before I found it."
1447458,phishfearme,2012-06-10 20:06:00,1242,"i'm 100% with obabikon here. go to any dick's sporting goods and look at the sale racks (or keep looking - remarkably good ones go on sale regularly) - i was amazed at the great rods - graphite, ceramic guides, solid/deep ferules and cork handles - you can get for $30 or $25 US. i bought a fenwick many years ago when graphite first got big for over $125 - it broke and since then i havn't spent more than $30 for a rod. one thing i know is true - the fish do not care what rod you have - only other fisherman care and you're not after them - or are you? phish"
1447485,Thunderbucket,2012-06-10 21:00:00,323,That's got my vote
1447554,bassface44,2012-06-11 05:50:00,96,"If you want to go way less than $100 the previous suggestions of BPro Bionic Blade or checking the Dicks Sporting Goods sales racks are good ones. The old Field and Stream Series and new Tec Spec, I believe that's what they are called, from Dicks are pretty solid rods. My current love though is a BPro Carbonlite 6'8"" M extra-fast tip. This thing is almost medium light in action but not quite. It makes an excellent jigging rod, can throw all sorts of crankbaits and jerk baits as well. Excellent mutlitasking walleye rod. Bonus is that it makes a great dropshot rod for bass as well. You have to wait and watch the sales at BPro though to make your $100 price tag. They go on sale quite often though. Happy hunting"
1447556,2746,2012-06-11 05:54:00,3206,"With the advent of the super lines sensitivity has increased dramatically, even with lower end rods, so 4 $25 rods has some appeal. Having said that I have always enjoyed owning and using quality tools and, as a result, own several higher end Fenwick and Lommis rods. Don't catch more fish but they sure are a pleasure to use."
1447621,octanehi5,2012-06-11 08:20:00,1104,"I do not know if they still sell them ,I use cabelas IM 7 tourney trail rods, have one piece or two 6' - 6'6"" #601 or#602 or 701-2, had them for yrs any were from $59 to $69 I broke the tip on one they replaced the rod no questions asked. for that kind of money its hard to beat"
1447689,MidWestFishman,2012-06-11 10:21:00,44,I can second the Cabela's Tourney rod. I have one that is about 6 yrs ald and it has worked very well for me and is a very good value for an IM7 rod. They do still sell them- $64.99. I also have some St. Croix rods- they are all over $100 but I have never had one break on me and used one for NWT Lake Trout fishing. If one was going to break I would think it would be while trying to bring those horses in the boat.
1447808,jkwildhunting,2012-06-11 12:34:00,361,Check with reeds sporting good they have jason mitchel rods for sale right now buy one get the other one free. I am thinkin getting two everyone i talked to loves them just a idea.
1447865,[emailÂ protected],2012-06-11 14:10:00,21,"Maybe not the prettiest, but I too prefer The Ugly Stick! I always buy two piece ones to make it easier flying in. Thing about an ugly stick is you can count on them, and at a reasonable cost. In many years of fishing with the ugly stick I have broken one tip off, and damaged a couple of inner rings in the guides. I have fished with guys that have paid $1,000. plus and broke them in half. I have tried other rods beside the ugly stick and they all broke."

1447103,unclepaully,2012-06-09 22:55:00,112,"I will be primarily jigging with this rod. I've read a lot about the St. Croixs but my chosen price range pretty much limits me to the Triumph. $100 is at the very top of my range. Would I be better off with a top tier rod from a ""cheaper"" brand or an entry level rod by one of the premium brands. Thanks for the responses so far."
1447105,RapShad,2012-06-09 23:10:00,76,"Really good question. I personally would go with whatever you are most comfortable with. Usually asking the guy at Bass Pro, Cabelas, Gander Mtn... is a good way to go. Personally I would go with the more expensive brand. Typically they are made with great workmanship, better materials, and have some sort of warranty. Rods break it's bound to happen, last year we had two break on us, one was an inferior rod which my dad was experimenting with that he brought up from Tennessee which was meant for largemouth and could not handle a strong hookset on a bigger Pike broke right in two (I've never seen that happen before). We also had a run in with a big wave on Minnitaki and one of the tips of our rods broke. We had a warranty on that one and now we have a shiny new rod to replace it, and we only had to pay the shipping."
1447198,adempsey,2012-06-10 08:59:00,963,"Sorry, I assumed the Premier and Eyecon lines were cheaper in the USA than here in Canada, especially with lower sales tax etc..I think your price range is one of the most difficult [or easiest, depending how you look at it :P] to pick a rod. There are so many to choose from. The low end lines of the ""premium brands"" or the relatively high-end house brands? I think most of these will have a sizable fan base. So, to me that means you probably have to go to the store and try a few out. Warranty can help make you decide as well. The house brands often give you the least trouble when there's a problem. If it were me, I'd go handle some of the 6', 6'3"" and 6'6"" Medium Light and Medium rods by Fenwick, Abu Garcia, St. Croix, Shimano and the house brands within that price range. I think the BPS house brands are currently on sale."
1447211,wallydave,2012-06-10 09:34:00,2151,"A couple years ago I picked up a Guide series light rod and reel at an end of the season sale at Gander. I really like the combo, for jigging it has served me well. You might check St. Croixs website, they have a clearance link. This spring the local Bass Pro had a tradein program, I picked a couple St.Croix rods.The Gander add in today's paper had the St. Croixs on sale. Check here for some ideas, then find the one that fits you and your budget. If your happy with what ever you buy, nothing else matters! Good luck and happy shopping!!"
1447227,Obabikon,2012-06-10 10:04:00,2370,"4 - $25 rods is the direction I go. I'm not sold that there's a large difference in high end rods. Unless you don't keep your finger on the line. Then the sensativity is important. But, point is, your finger should be more sensative that the most expensive rods out there."
1447251,unclepaully,2012-06-10 11:02:00,112,"Wallydave-Thanks for the heads up about the Gander Ad, there are some really good deals in there. I think I might head over there today and pick one up. They have a St. Croix Premier 6'6'' light, for $78.96 and after rebate it's only 63.96. Seems like a really good deal. Either that one or the medium light. Thanks for the help guys."
1447274,JETSTER,2012-06-10 12:13:00,448,"Falcon Buccoo rod from Cabelas $99,I am not complaining a bit about this rod....Tough and looks nice with the open ended handle!!!Would not ever waste my money on a Abu Garcia,no-way no-how....."
1447278,JETSTER,2012-06-10 12:16:00,448,"Just a heads up on St. Croix,there tips break easily.....Seen it done 3 times on each replacement but the guy wouldnt learn,St. Croix is the best they say correct and still believed it!!!!"
1447317,wallydave,2012-06-10 14:18:00,2151,"Has anyone else had this problem with St. Croix? I am new to owning their rods, if this a problem it's something I will want to be aware of."
1447342,Guest,2012-06-10 15:24:00,0,"ive seen fenwick come up a bunch. from what i understand gander mountain uses fenwick blanks in their rods. i have an arsenal of gander mountain series rods as well as some st croix and some cheaper rods. if i could only use one, it would be a 6'6"" medium (fast tip) baitcaster rod from then gander mountain series. their cheapest line is the advantage series and they are really nice rods. for an extra couple bucks you get a no questions asked replacement warranty. definitely worth it."
1447002,unclepaully,2012-06-09 15:24:00,112,"If you could bring only 1 rod for walleye on your trip north what would it be? Oh and the kicker is you only have $100 to spend. I've decided that I want a new rod specifically for the walleye in Ontario; however, I don't want to break the bank when in all reality it might not get used as much when I'm back home. Here in Michigan I spend more time chasing bass & panfish and I've always been an ugly stik guy. Thanks for the advice guys."
1447005,JoeWho14,2012-06-09 15:48:00,20,"I know this probably won't sit well with a lot of the die hard's out there, but I've used Shimano, Abu-Garcia, Quantum, etc. But personally a 6' to a 6-6"" medium action Ugly Stick is hard to beat for the price!!"
1447015,Jiggin_Rob,2012-06-09 17:00:00,26,"If indeed it was the only one, I would buy the St. Croix triumph series spinning rod 6'6"" medium light action. this Rod can provide you with a variety of presentations, Including light trolling.. I own 3 of them.."
1447018,eyemike,2012-06-09 17:33:00,233,A Berkley Lightning med. action. For the price I'd get 2.
1447028,JayM5209,2012-06-09 18:23:00,1050,"Fenwick 6'6"" ML. If you're doing a fly-in, get the 2 piece model. And, you'll a couple o' bucks left for some new jigs and a couple of Tail Dancers."
1447047,Glenman12,2012-06-09 19:59:00,762,I'll secong that..St Croix all the way..
1447057,ILScott,2012-06-09 20:29:00,139,I like the bass pro bionic blade and the bass pro signature series jigging pole.
1447065,elway12,2012-06-09 20:46:00,335,Another vote for St. Croix Triumph. I have 2 6'6 fast action-mediums that I love!
1447091,RapShad,2012-06-09 22:13:00,76,"I fished with the bionic blade series for years. Then I was introduced to Loomis and St. Croix... Haven't looked back. It's hard to beat lifetime warranties. The bionic blades still serve as my backups though and are still great rods especially for bass, but I really like the sensitivity I get with Loomis/St. Croix for walleye."
1447094,adempsey,2012-06-09 22:18:00,963,"St.Croix Premier, St. Croix Eyecon or Shimano Compre. Of course, it depends on what method you're going to be using the most. For example, you can get a less expensive rod if you're just trolling."
