1448059,nd89sc88,2012-06-11 21:31:00,92,"A few years ago at Witch Bay on LOTW, we had exactly these conditions in late July. Close to 100 degrees. They told us about the shallow water shad rap bite. Find a rock pile that comes close to the surface, but does not break it. Throw a shad rap up into 1-3 feet reel until you feel the rocks, then just pull the lure over the rocks, giving slack when you got hung up. Most bites came as the lure floated up and back from the rocks. And it was a BIG fish tactic. We caught 5 over 24"" one afternoon, with the biggest being 27"". Some other folks in camp got fish over 30"" doing this! Strangest walleye fishing I've ever seen, but it really worked. Good luck, Bill"
1448073,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-11 22:28:00,803,"yep, weeds. Guaranteed to be in there and biting."
1448118,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-12 06:25:00,298,"My wife and I have fished Lac Seul the end of June or first part of July since 1997. A few years ago we started making a second trip the middle of August. When we pulled into camp for our first August trip the weather was hot and sunny and dead calm. We were told that we needed to fish in 25'-30' of water as the eyes were deep. While trolling a shoreline, using spinners and minnows and trying to stay at the suggested depth, we came up to a small rocky point. While swinging around the point we got into 3' of water so we headed straight out trying to get back deeper. We found that there was a shallow bar running out from the point for several hundred yards and suddenly the eyes started to bite. The weather stayed the same for two more days and everytime we worked that bar we hammered em in 3'-10' of water.Another year with the same conditions we found them along a weed bed just off the edge of a sandbar in about 6' of water.The lesson we learned was regardless of weather conditions try all depths and stucture because you never know where you might find them."
1448132,Bigfishhunter,2012-06-12 06:43:00,803,"WalleyWally, it is funny you say that. The lake that I primarily fish for eyes (at 55' latitude), in August all other fisherman focus on deeper holes, whereas I find mid lake reefs that come up shallow. I catch more and bigger fish when I come to the fillet shack than the other guys do. It seems to me that the hotter is it the more the fish like to feed."
1448163,WalleyeWally28,2012-06-12 07:27:00,298,"Although we really enjoy our early trip, we have found that we catch more and larger fish in August."
1448433,REG,2012-06-12 15:09:00,445,"Just want to echo what some have already said. We were fishing Pakwash during that very warm, very calm period last week and found Walleyes right on thick cabbage patch weed edges. In fact, it was almost unbelievable since the water was only about 3 ft deep and the water was much warmer this year than what we expect for the first part of June."
1448683,Bill Krejca,2012-06-13 07:38:00,6107,"Besides the weeds, find a shore area with a relatively steep sloping bottom. The sun must be in a position such that a shadow is projected down along the slope. Rock bottoms work best. In the spaces between rocks, the fish like to lay in wait in the shadows. If you run a bait down along the slope, it makes a nice attraction for the walleyes. Bill Krejca"
1448727,dan cardinal,2012-06-13 09:04:00,64,"You are right on again Bill. Sun positioning is a key, and I find the same applies to main basin reefs, points, rock piles, etc. with steeper breaks. These underwater features will cast a shadow also, and often on slick days I find walleye positioned in those shadows."
1448737,SinOrSwim,2012-06-13 09:23:00,1528,If you look like our group......for the love of pete......keep your shirt on!!!!!! The fish will not bite with the bright reflection coming off your back and stomach. And I second whoever said.....DRINK! (but not in the boat as that would be illegal)
1448755,Manitou,2012-06-13 09:48:00,125,"I find the bite turns on just after the sun hits the horizon.Fish all day in an area, nothing, but then the light changes and boom you're into them."
559617,retire55,2006-07-21 14:59:00,1029,"Assistance required please. Just returned from a week (Sat to Sat) in Canada fishing for walleyes on a big deep shield lake. From the Monday until the Thursday, we couldn't buy a bite during the clear calm sunny weather - not a cloud in the sky and the lake as flat and smooth as glass. What tactics work best, if any, to entice walleyes to bite in such weather? We marked lots of walleyes where ever we fished but were unable to net any. I read in Greg Bohn's slip bobbering book that with the weather as described, walleyes head for cover. Are there any tactics that can produce walleye in such conditions? Thanks in advance."
559621,Guest,2006-07-21 17:50:00,0,We have fished Lac Seul for several years and many times found walleyes in less than 3' of water on a 95 degree day. They will go to shallow water when hot and calm. One year we flipped plastics in water less than three feet and absolutely hammered them. The next year on a similar day we casted #7 shadraps up against rocky shorelines or ripped them through cabbage or bullrushes with great results. When it gets hot and the water lays down on lac seul dont be afraid to go shallow. Hope this helps and good luck in the future.
559624,phishfearme,2006-07-21 18:12:00,1242,"walleye getcher has a very good point - shallow and shallower. most of the lakes in the schield are heavily tannin stained and visibility dies off rapidly - belive me, i've snorkeled in many of these lakes trying to recover lures or anchors. in my experience the ""sweet spot"" is from 5 to 8 feet of water over rocks with deep water nearby (which may only be 12ft or so). i see many reports on this board of eyes taken from deep water but my bet is almost always on the sweet spot - espcially in smaller lakes - rough or flat - cloudy or sunny. - phish"

Some guys in our camp fish exclusively at night when the weather is calm and sunny. They stay close to camp and get fish in water the rest of us ride over during daylight. Makes sense to me, fish are always hungry, if they aren't eating during the day maybe they'll do it at night. I'd be interested to hear how others do at night in the heat of summer, both up in Canada and elsewhere. General tips for night fishing would also be welcome, like how to know where the ---- you are if the moon is not up. The other suggestion for daylight is fish in or on the edge of deep weed beds, if your lake has 'em."
559637,retire55,2006-07-22 12:29:00,1029,"Thanks everyone for your input. For RSH8 We have fished the lake we fish for walleyes in north western Quebec for a number of years. Consequently, we always have a pretty good idea where we are on the lake while we're fishing in darkness. We have always stayed with an outfitter and used his boats and motors. I keep a battery powered lantern on (fluorescent light) in the boat to let others know our location. One fishing method we use during darkness is slip bobbering using Nite Brite Thill floats. To facilitate safe navigation on the lake in the dark, we use portable battery powered 10,000,000 candlepower lights to assist us in getting back to camp."
559703,Guest,2006-07-24 12:47:00,0,"We are stuck with what nature gives us. I try to save these days for Pike fishing when possible. So what if it's not possible? Then I'd try to get out on the water before dawn and again at dusk. I would start with areas that marked fish in proximity to shallower water. In general the active walleyes will move from the deeper water to the shallow water and back again. These active walleyes are the ones you want to try and hook up with. Bouncing your jig in front of a bunch of suspended inactive walleyes is just plain unproductive. Pay attention to shadow lines from the trees, casting a crank bait into these shadow lines can be very productive during the dawn & dusk times. I once filled my limit with a good friend fishing in the exact same spot, while he went without a bite. He hadn't caught a fish until I told him to cast his crank bait into the shade and work it back to the boat. Fishing Lake Erie on a calm sunny day and we had only caught a couple of fish when a storm front came in. All the charter boats pulled up and ran for port. We continued to fish and the darker it got the hotter the bite. We got a little wet but we filled 6 limits in less than an hour after being out in the sun for almost 4 hours. Areas that produce fish at dawn and dusk can just go stone cold in the light of the day."

1448028,JayM5209,2012-06-11 20:30:00,1050,"I go shallow and in the weeds. 2'-6' of water, small jig, like 1/16th, and half a crawler. Work it right in the weeds or tight against the outside weed line."
