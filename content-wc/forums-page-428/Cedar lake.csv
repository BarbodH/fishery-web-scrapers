1441308,cedarlakelodge,2012-05-27 15:32:00,2,"Thought you would all like to know the report section is up and running again. To bad we lost all the past info! It will take awhile to build up again. If you like the site help us out and post some pictures asnd reports.Our opening day was mid 70's with high 50's water temp. Pretty cool weather since then with some much needed rain.Today May 27th we have approx 50 degree air temp and water temp from 53 at noon today.Fairly good walleye fishing last week at 6 - 10 ft...approx 12 feet right now.Incredible amount of Northern,Smallmouth and young Muskie hitting Mepps spinners last week.....the star of this week has been a bear so far....just a couple of brave souls braving the weather but are reporting a decent walleye bite.I sincerely do not endorse targeting Muskie out of season...I'm glad we had very responsible and carefull fishermen here last week!Looks like we have better weather coming mid week.For almost daily updates please check and Like our Cedar Lake Lodge facebook page as well as my personal site Al Rempel(Cedar Lake Lodge)It's not to late to join us this year at the Lodge!Hope this helps planning your trips....Al"
1444088,Terwalleye,2012-06-02 23:47:00,166,"Come on, somebody, ......Anyone???? Bueler? Bueler? Someone back from Cedar recently?!?! Talk to us poeple. It is what we live until until our lucky day. I will pay it forward upon return."
1447655,Terwalleye,2012-06-11 09:23:00,166,Anyone just get back from Cedar latley? Curious how the weed growth ahs been. Read elsewhere the water temps were as high as 65 degreees. Gonna be a good Musky opener this year!
1447662,Glenman12,2012-06-11 09:31:00,762,"Sorry I cant help as I leave in 41 hours..on the Cedar Lake Lodge website they posted yesterday that theyve been getting a lot of rain and the water level has risen 6"" from being down a foot on the opener..also said water temp was 64 as of yesterday.."
1447697,zman8701,2012-06-11 10:36:00,100,"I also am departing for Cedar in 4 days. Glenman stays on the west arm and I fish the east arm. When we return, the both of us should be able to provide what the conditions are for all of Cedar."
1447698,Larry Mac,2012-06-11 10:37:00,530,"Hi Glenman12, have a great trip!!!!!!Thank you,Larry mac"
1448613,Terwalleye,2012-06-13 00:38:00,166,"I'll be sure to post too. 2 more days of work and then heaven begins! Shore lucnh, what else can you say. Dinner in God's kitchen! 370 days since the last one. mmmmm walleye!"
1448637,bigdaddyguns,2012-06-13 06:13:00,608,"Safe travels up to the Perrault Falls area, just heard they had quite a bit of rain recently with some washouts on the roads. Hopefully the weather stabilizes for some great fishing. Best of luck."
1302181,Glenman12,2011-05-02 18:26:00,762,"Al posted some pics on his website of the ice on Cedar as of 4/21..its in the fishing reports under ""2011 season""..also read on here that the ice is out on lakes in Kenora and Dryden so Cedar cant be far behind"
1439700,Terwalleye,2012-05-23 19:39:00,166,All righty guys. It's 2012 and the lucky ones fishing the opener are up there now. Our group is headin back up for year 3;in 3 weeks. I just thought Iwould bump this thread back to the top and try to stir up some conversation. Anyone going to Cedar or just getting back; the rest of us would love to read about your exploits. Looks like conditions will be similar to two years ago. That is fine by me. We had no problem finding most species in the weeds. had to go deeper for bigger eyes; but that weed edge in Hatfield Bay was good for dinner sized Eyes every evening.Can NOT wait
1439724,nitroman,2012-05-23 20:27:00,368,Heading up June 1st just gotta get thru this weekend and then a busy week then bam on the road! Looks like water temps are running 58 or so and they are catching walleyes according to al's FB page. 4-10 ft seems to be where they are but no news about wether they are scattered or not. Just checked the forecast and looks to be warm up there for the next 10 days or so. 8 and a wake up!
1439732,Terwalleye,2012-05-23 20:50:00,166,"Good for you Nitroman. Yeah, I notice CLL's fishing report forum has been down for a while now. Hope he gets that fixed. ANY source for Cedar Lake info is a good one. I am really curious what the weed growth is like so far this year; with the ice being out so early."
1439739,Glenman12,2012-05-23 21:02:00,762,Yeah I emailed Al about that and he is having problems tracking down his IT guy..best you can do is click on the Facebook link cause he posts reports on there..As of last Sunday the water temp was 58 so I would guess that weed growth is minimal so far...also looking on Accuweather theyve been getting some rain with more to come..he told me the water level was down about a foot..
1440290,Glenman12,2012-05-24 19:31:00,762,he has it back up an running but you have to register again...
1440330,walleyeguy1988,2012-05-24 20:54:00,14,"I was in Ontario on Cedar Lake, Cedar Point Resort back in 2005. The best 8 days of fishing in my life. I miss the place everyday and cannot wait to go back there again!"
1440613,kseye,2012-05-25 11:53:00,7,We will be leaving for Cedar on Thur be fishing by Friday morning. Two more days of work but the only thing I will be thinking about is the taste of those first fresh walleye of the year. Is the water level and temp much different from last year?
1440759,Glenman12,2012-05-25 19:21:00,762,water is down about a foot and the water temp today was 57..
1440765,Terwalleye,2012-05-25 19:35:00,166,GlenmanYour ARE Johnny on the spot! And thanks for the heads up on Al's forums working again. Can't read too much about Cedar between now and when we leave.
1300027,lonewolf73,2011-04-27 14:36:00,17,We will be staying across the lake at Jerry & Ellie's. I think this is our 9th year there and we can't complain. They are fantastic hosts. Looks like the timing of the ice out should make for good fishing again hopefully as fast and furious as it was in 2009. Good Luck!
1300034,nitroman,2011-04-27 14:57:00,368,"Yes I do this will be year 10 for me! I fish the east arm mostly but have a couple ""spots"" on the west arm."
1300044,zman8701,2011-04-27 15:26:00,100,"Nitroman you must have stayed when Roger&Carol owned CPR. I went the 2 wk in june then, but dropped down 1 wk when they sold. Warmer water higher weed growth. Lot better fishing"
1300107,Glenman12,2011-04-27 18:39:00,762,Our owner is up there but staying at a cabin about 20 miles north of Cedar...with the ice not out they get to the island yet..he said he would let me know when the ice went...
1300289,jerrynbailey,2011-04-28 06:52:00,4,"Lets hope we get a great week for catching lonewolf. This will be our sixth year on Cedar Lake but due to a wedding and a baby due our group will be a twosome. Have any of you done a fly out trip from Cedar Lake? If so, what did you think, and who would you recommend?"
1300572,nitroman,2011-04-28 19:51:00,368,"Cedar Point Resort, Cedar Lake Northwest Ontario We finally made it back into camp yesterday - April 26th. The last two miles of the road still had a good amount of snow on it. Lots of ice still on the lake at this point. We are gearing up for a Great season this year. Can't wait to see everyone. From Cedar Point Resort Facebook!"
1301172,Terwalleye,2011-04-30 11:51:00,166,"JnBOur group stayed at Northern Lights last year. We hired Wilderness Airhttp://www.great-fishing.com/flyin-fishing-camping.phpFor a one day fly out / in deal. It was no cheap date. Like $250 per guy. But they flew into to Cedar at 8 AM picked us up; we fished for 8 hours on Boot Lake and then they picked us up and flew us back. We had 5 guys. I was in the boat with 3 guys in it. We brought a little hand clicker to count fish so it wouldn;t be a ""fish tale."" We boated 257 walleyes between the the three of us.Doing it again this year but gonna try a different lake. Amazing time and highlight of the trip last year."
1301272,Glenman12,2011-04-30 18:39:00,762,Wow..$250..my first trip to Cedar in 1981 and it cost $75 to fly out..went to a lake called Vaughn Lake..killed the eater walleyes...that was the only time in 29 years of going up that Ive ever been checked by the MNR and we were the only boat on the lake
1301615,Larry Mac,2011-05-01 14:24:00,530,"Hi Glen, I hope all is well with you and yours. All is well here. When are you going up?Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1301697,Glenman12,2011-05-01 17:06:00,762,Every thing is good...we head up June 10th
1270388,nitroman,2011-02-11 14:11:00,368,I have a few pics from last year!
1270477,Terwalleye,2011-02-11 19:24:00,166,"Glennman and lonewolfHappy New Year!! lonewolf, that middle picture you posted has actually been my screensaver on my work computer for about a year now. Ever since you emailed them. Too funny, our group took some very nice pics to; but somehow that one kept me sane during our busy season at work last spring and has special meaning for being the light at the end of the tunnel.Nitroman, here is my version of hotsteel. The sunset pic attached is from the very beginning of Hatfield. That is where we would fish last light each night. Nice safe ride back to Northern Lights and always caught fish."
1299855,jerrynbailey,2011-04-27 08:39:00,4,"Hey guys,I really start to get amped up after Easter. Has anybody had a report of what the winter was/is up at Cedar/Perrault? Due to a wedding and a baby due date, our group will only be a twosome this year. We will be on the water June 4-10 which should be the same time as you Lonewolf. Are you at Cedar Lake Lodge? Here is my favorite picture which is is my desktop on my computer and the backscreen of my cell phone."
1299919,Glenman12,2011-04-27 10:42:00,762,That looks like the tiny island right outside Sawmill Bay
1299923,jerrynbailey,2011-04-27 10:50:00,4,"that's correct glenman12 - taken as we had just limited out on our last day back in 2007. If I recall, you typically go the week after us. any word from up there yet?"
1299926,nitroman,2011-04-27 10:55:00,368,It looks like heaven! 30 days! Going thru the tackle box today set up the meal and grocery lists yesterday. There is still ice up there but it's starting to go now. When does Al get up there he always posts the conditions when he gets there.
1299939,jerrynbailey,2011-04-27 11:30:00,4,Not sure - I believe he actually wintered in Manitoba this year.
1299999,JayM5209,2011-04-27 13:32:00,1050,"Here's a report on the status of the ice on the north shore of Vermilion Bay, as of this a.m., 4/27/11. I'd suspect Cedar looks about the same.http://www.electricbeaver.ca/"
1300006,zman8701,2011-04-27 13:43:00,100,Looks like a lot of you fish the west arm. Anyone stay at Cedar Point Resort?
1300017,zman8701,2011-04-27 14:15:00,100,"Just read a report from fishguide on Cedar, and everybody feels prety good about ice being gone by May 10-15. They are expecting warmer weather. It is a good thing for all of us that the season opened 1 wk. later this year. Good fishing everybody"
1269463,nitroman,2011-02-08 21:38:00,368,So who is headed there this year? We have a very small group of only four this year headed up memorial day weekend. This will be my 10th season on cedar and I am as excited as ever seems like we do a little better each year as we learn more about the lake. Can't say enough about the things I have learned from others on this forum as far as tips tricks and techniques. Here's to another great year on cedar! Where ya at glen man I know your getting the itch also!
1269474,Mike Borger,2011-02-09 03:49:00,1554,"There's a lot of Cedar lakes in ON, which one?"
1269485,Glenman12,2011-02-09 05:53:00,762,Perrault Falls
1269576,Glenman12,2011-02-09 11:31:00,762,sent you a PM
1269752,Rich B,2011-02-09 20:23:00,1081,"A group of us from Ohio, Wisconsin and MN will be up that same week (over Memorial Day). There will be 8 of us, and we'll be bringing up our rigs. This will be our 3rd Spring trip at Cedar Lake Lodge, and most of the other boys were also up last Sept (I had planned on that trip, but tore up my quad, so I ended up having surgery the same week my buddies were fishing Cedar Lake - yea, life ain't fair - ha !). Glenman gave us some great advice when we were considering Cedar Lake a few years back, and that was appreciated. Beautiful chain of lakes, and easy to get around.....fishing ain't bad either ! End of May can't arrive soon enough (ha) ! Take good care, Rich B"
1270033,nitroman,2011-02-10 16:56:00,368,15 weeks 1 day and 1 hour till we leave! Tick tock tick tock! We are in a deep freeze here in central Iowa may just get the tackle box out tomorrow and clean it out!
1270048,Terwalleye,2011-02-10 17:27:00,166,"18 weeks and counting for our group's 2nd year. What an awesome trip last year. Fishing was outstanding, the weather cooperated and what a beautiful lake. Thanks sooo much to the awesome folks on this forum. We were able to start out on a not so small lake with several good places to try. All produced and from there we were able to find 'em on our own. Can't wait to get back. Can't imagine it getting any better......but we'll take it if it is."
1270120,Glenman12,2011-02-10 19:59:00,762,Hi Terwalleye Glad to hear you did well on Cedar last year..my countdown software says 3months and 27 days..we cant wait..
1270292,lonewolf73,2011-02-11 09:54:00,17,I've got the itch just like everyone else. June 4th can't get here fast enough....might have to dig out the tackle box too. Actually found some jigs on clearance last week and I need to put them away so they don't get lost!
1270297,lonewolf73,2011-02-11 10:02:00,17,Just a few of the reasons why June 4th can't get here fast enough.....Anyone have any other favorite pictures of Cedar Lake that they would like to share?
