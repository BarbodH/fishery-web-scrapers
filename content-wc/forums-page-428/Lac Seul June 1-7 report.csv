1447013,bpetersen,2012-06-09 16:47:00,251,Fishing was slow and spotty on Lac Seul for us this passed week. Water level was very low from two years ago. Our camp members were not having any luck unless they went to Mackenzie Bay. The report I was given about Mackenzie Bay was some slot fish were being caught but not much keepers and a lot of boats. I personally didn't want to travel that far so my group went below the Ear Falls dam and had pretty good luck with all sizes of walleye and northerns. Fish were still scattered below the dam. We used jigs and minnows with some success but were catching too many northerns. Started to use crawlers with rigs and did very well on walleye with some northerns. Weather was hot and very calm water below the dam. Biggest walleye was a 27 and several 21 to 25's. Several slots and a bunch of small 12 to 15 inch walleye. Hopefully someone will chime in on their success.

1447037,Bitinlight,2012-06-09 19:14:00,95,"Just got back from Lac Seul from our 4 guy June trip. Fished the Northeast Section near the Bear Narrows Area from June 5-8. Tuesday through Thursday, warm in the high 70's to low 80's with just a small breeze. Still caught a ton of walleyes with one of our guys catching the biggest at 28"". Friday, windy and rain with more fish caught. Overall, numbers and action were excellent, but size seemed to be a little smaller this year--didn't seem to catch as many slot fish as usual nor as many over 20"". Did catch many healthy 15-16 inchers and some in the 20-24 inch range so that looks good for the future. Water seems to be about 4 feet low. Ran through the Rags with no problem. Most interesting thing was that the majority of our fish came out of 3-5 feet of water. Got some in 6-8, but we didn't find much in deeper than 8 feet. Jig and minnow was best. The few that we cleaned were filled with some kind of bug, but we didn't notice any Mayfly hatch on the service while we were there. Highway 72 has some wash outs that have been repaired, and it looks like some major road repair is scheduled, as there are stakes and markings on the roadside. Heading back July 10 for five more days."

Fishing was very good but fish were not in traditional locations. Multiple bug hatches resulted in fish being in sandy/mucky bottom shallow water with many fewer off of typical rocky structures common to those waters. Most of our fish were caught in 2-4 ft. Crankbaits and jigs/minnows both worked well. Purple was the color to have, as has been the case in our experience for years. Lots of slot size and many over slot. Great numbers overall."
1448861,IMSPIKE,2012-06-13 13:03:00,12,Fishing was great out of the bays for us in the Ear Falls area. The fish were moving from the spawning areas out to the main lake. husky jerks / smithwick rogues were the key. lot's of fish over 25. 3 at 27.5. Got lots of videos and picutes out on walleyewisdom.com.
