1447794,REG,2012-06-11 12:16:00,445,502 is in very good shape. Just drove it Saturday. Good luck!
1447847,tv4fish,2012-06-11 13:42:00,2694,"Don't know if you saw my post (Lac Seul) - but, be prepared for some traffic delays due to construction - they are milling/resurfacing on 17 going east of Dryden. When we came through they were working just east of Wabigoon. Also, maybe they weren't working on 502 on Saturday, but they are also doing ditching and some repairs on 502 between 17 and Dryden. And 72 is in its usual ""bumpy"" condition. (We were shocked - they were NOT working on the ""causeway"" east of Fort Frances."
1447859,Mark R,2012-06-11 13:59:00,1538,I drove that going in on June 1st and came back on June 7th and din't have any delays or construction on 11 e/b or 502
1447866,tv4fish,2012-06-11 14:14:00,2694,Mark: You ARE correct - no work on 11 - not even on the bridge/causeway.
1447932,jimmie,2012-06-11 17:25:00,123,"If you drove it last year then you know of the improvements made last year from 2010. About 10 years ago they began improvements in different sections and have neaerly resurfaced all the lenght. I noticed about 7/8/9 miles not far up after the ""s"" curves for the worst section but the res is the best that it has been! Just remember to gas up before you get on the way up if you are even marginal on fuel otherwise watch for moose especially if it is dark and all have a safe trip up and please let us know if you left any 'eyes for the rest of us to catch. LOL!"

1448419,81Saluki,2012-06-12 14:48:00,97,"I returned home yesterday via 502 and it's in GREAT shape. One word of caution ... If you're a veteran of 502, you know the posted speed limit is only 80kph (50mph). While that was a good rule to abide by way back when the road was in terrible shape, I have a really hard time these days driving under 60mph since they improved the road. I've seen more police on the road in recent years and have been lucky that I haven't been caught going over the limit. A buddy of mine was ticketed a couple of weeks ago for doing 65mph. So beware ... you've been warned. Funny story ... a few years ago I was heading home on 502. Normally I can drink a couple cups of coffee and make it past the border into I'Falls before I have to pee. Not this time. The pressure started building after passing the old Mallard's Nest (now Timber Wolf Lodge) location. I knew time was of the essence so I hit the gas. Probably averaged about 75-80mph until I was about to burst and knew I wouldn't make it into FF. So I pulled over at the next ""pulp check"" spot. No sooner had I trotted to the side of my SUV to relieve myself out of view of traffic did a police car go by. *Somebody* was looking out for me that day!"
1448437,RoughWaters,2012-06-12 15:13:00,98,"Thanks for all the updates. Much appreciated. @81saluki- I know what you mean about the improved road and ability to go a little faster, it's difficult to drive slowly when you wait all year to get up there. Haha. I'll post a fishing report when I get back. Thanks again."
