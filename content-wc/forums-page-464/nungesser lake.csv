1341842,jjwritz,2011-08-19 13:30:00,12,the camp is owned by the people at Goose Bay Camp on lac seul---don't know if it has a name----
1342262,BuckeyeATC,2011-08-21 11:30:00,88,Been to Goose Bay numerous times and also to one of the other camps on the lake. Haven't been to Goose Bay for 10+ years though. Have fun dodging the rocks on the river during the portage into the lake. Some of the best fishing is right around Goose Bay Camp.
