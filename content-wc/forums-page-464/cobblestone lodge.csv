1345756,Guest,2011-08-31 21:19:00,0,Wrong. Cliff is very clean cut and normal looking. Very into his lakes. He did not pay to have the 34 N road built. Nice (tho intense) guy who apparently has some tackle fetishes I was not aware of
1349682,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-14 15:08:00,725,"We returned from our fun but short trip up to Cobblestone Lodge and the lakes where Cliff has equipment. I will try to not make this too lengthy, but here goes. When we first arrived and unloaded, Cliff was anxiously awaiting our visit to the lodge area to give us the lowdown on what to expect. We really wanted to have a beer first, but we went there instead. He sat us down with a paper map of Kukukus Lake and started with telling us why back trolling with keel sinkers and spinners with a minnow was the only way to fish. He insists that he has tried every form of fishing and this is the only consistent method to catch walleyes. ""When they are biting you can catch them on dragonflies, but when the bite is not strong, this method still works."" He then went on to draw a diagram on the back of the map that would put John Madden to shame when describing a Brett Favre touchdown play. There was so much red ink on it we couldn't decipher it, but it included a picture of a boat with how to back troll, a diagram of fan casting and a visual of what our bait would look like in the water. Then, we drank the kool-aid. He has four colors of rigs and suggested we buy a chartreuse and a gold spinner, we bought four or five of each ($2 apiece and $1.50 for each keel sinker) and the 1/4 oz. keel sinkers. He assured us he was not in the minnow business or the tackle business, but we spent $50 each in four days on tackle and minnows. We came to the conclusion that Cliff is just intense and has himself convinced that he is right. He really grew on us through the week and we parted friends. Admittedly, we back trolled the whole time and he let us trade in the chartreuse spinners when we realized the gold worked the best. We didn't really have too much time to experiment and always had a slow troll going, but my BIL did throw a jig and troll a flicker shad, neither of which produced anything. When we returned from Arethusa Lake (third day) and had not done too well, his first question was, ""you were back trolling, weren't you?"" Oh, yeah,"" we replied, ""we know the drill!"" Cliff can flat clean a fish and seemed to enjoy cleaning our fish for us, which was fine with us. We typically don't mess with pike but he convinced us to bring one back and we had a 25 incher for dinner one night. Cliff got all of the bones out and it was delicious. I think he probably does it to make sure he knows what is being taken out of the lake, but we appreciated him doing that for us. Fish finders are kind of a necessity when you are fishing a new lake every day and of course, i realized mine was sitting in the garage when we arrived in Canada. He only charged us $10 to use one, which was really reasonable. About the camp...Cliff and Denise run a nice tidy clean camp with all the amenities you expect and more (towel service, for instance). However, no fireplaces or stoves and we did not really like the camp arrangement. In the evening when we sit on the porch, you can see everyone else sitting on the porch. In addition, the cabins are close and you can see into the windows of each other. Not much privacy in the camp. About the lakes...The drive each day was long. There is a small but productive lake pretty close (Sally Lake), but most of the lakes are over 20 miles each way over narrow washboard roads. That experience is hair-raising as you need to go 35-40mph to smooth the road out, but fortunately we didn't run across anyone else. Of the lakes we fished, Kukukus had a few other boats in it, Sally had one other boat come in, Arethusa had a bunch of boats in it but they all went to the other end of the lake (I wonder why?) where Cliff prefers you not go. Hawk Lakes were private-no one else there. About the fishing- We caught plenty of walleye and a few pike, but nothing big. Cliff assured us that we everyone gets a 27"" walleye and a 40 inch pike, but we didn't. I began to realize that he stretched things a bit when he said 51 inch pike were common in these waters. (the north american record is 55 inches). All in all, we had a good time, enjoyed Cliff and still use catch phrases when talking about him. Enjoyed fishing a different lake each day, but not the drive and enjoyed the delicious walleye. I would recommend Cobblestone for those that might like a little adventure-just hide your jigs!"
1350066,Guest,2011-09-16 07:53:00,0,"I have been anxiously awaiting your report and it is about as expected. I hope you can see how if you don't land with both feet and shut up when Cliff is telling his tales, that it would be a long week. I think my biggest problem was that one of the first things I said to him when Kukukus was brought up was that I had been fishing Kukukus since 1982. Which was true but was not the right thing to say to a guy who knows everything and assumes everyone else knows nothing. We never bought or used his spinners and had a great fishing trip. And we did catch a 40-inch northern (out of Hawk Lake) but no big walleyes. It also really freaked Cliff out when he found out that we had been fishing northerns by casting spinnerbaits and caught several walleyes by slow rolling spinnerbaits along the deep cabbage edges. Man he just couldn't take that. The day we went to Kukukus, we found a ridiculous topwater bite going for smallmouths, and caught several from 15-19 inches on skitter-pops. We did not tell him about that. My son caught a 20-incher on a spinnerbait too. One more story before I let this go. We had caught several lake trout on Raleigh lake one day and I left my marker buoy out there where we caught them. The next day after supper, I asked a couple of the guys if they wanted to go with me to pick up that marker bouy and maybe troll for an hour in the evening. Well, Cliff saw us going out and we told him what we were doing and he just rolled his eyes like we were stupid and told us that the lakers do not bite in the evening. He then walked back to the cabin and told the other guys that we were just wasting our time and ""just going for a boat ride."" Anyway, we got out there and put out the lines, but we were not marking any fish at all. I got to thinking about where they might have gone and decided to try something. The sun had just set so we had may 30-45 minutes of light left. I took the weight off one of the my trolling rigs and put it back out and sure enough, it was only about 3 feet below the surface and I caught one right away! I put it back out and caught another. That's when I realized that the reason we were not marking them was because they had all come to the surface in the evening. I looked ay CJ and said ""Dude we are going to go back to camp with our limits and Cliff is going to blow a gasket!"" CJ just reeled in his line and refused to put it back out!!!!!! He said if we do that Cliff is going to throw us out of camp again! Long story short, the guys talked me into going in and not pressing the issue. While I was cleaning the fish in the fish cleaning building, I could see him watching me out the window of the office but he never did say anything about it. The one thing I will say about Cliff is that his boats and his set-ups for keeping the boats at the remote lakes are top notch. He really has a good system."
1350079,Guest,2011-09-16 08:17:00,0,"One more comment if you ever go back there. Here's a tip if you ever go back there. Those places where you caught the fish with the keel sinker rig are even more effectively fished with a bottom bouncer and a spinner. You can use a crawler or a minnow or Gulp. We never take live bait anymore, we catch all the fish we need on Gulp. When you are going along with the bouncer and spinner you will notice that there are places that you tend to catch a fish each time you go through there. If you stop on those spots and drop a jig down you will probably find there is a pretty good sized pod of fish down there. I'm expecting to spend 9-12 days on Kukukus again next year and I am already looking forward to it. And when we drive by Cobblestone Lodge we will all laugh and talk about ""Dangerous Cliff!"""
1350124,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-16 11:04:00,725,"With our encounters with good ole Cliff, I can sure believe everything you say. The last day while on Hawk, we literally caught every walleye on a pass by the same submerged rock. I think his point is that keel sinker rigs probably produce pretty consistently, but we knew if we stopped and jigged around the submerged rock we would have caught plenty. Trouble is that he will not provide you an anchor. We asked for one but he said ""You dont want to be hauling an anchor you don't need. We had one, but didn't throw it in the boat and it wouldn't have held us that day anyway since it was quite windy. Our approach of being agreeable and friendly served us well during our short visit. I honestly think he just wants people to be successful and can't comprehend a better or as effective way to fish than his method. I don't buy the idea that these lakes are so much different than any other lakes in Canada, though. As you said before, walleyes are walleyes. We will go back to our old but productive ways of jigging and trolling next spring, but I will try the keel sinker rig i have left over a couple of times!"
1338200,buckx37,2011-08-07 18:51:00,7,"fish_on UL, was the other lake you were on indian lake, that is one of the other lakes he has boats on. We did not have much luck on this chain of lakes. I would agree with your rating scale on the other lakes. We were there 2nd week of july and fished mostly walleyes all we had to do was find weeds and troll the edges or even slightly in weeds and had no trouble catching fish."
1338268,Guest,2011-08-08 06:04:00,0,Yes I believe it was indian. This year the walleyes were in the weeds pretty much every where we fished. Find the cabbage find the walleyes. Bottom bouncer and a spinner with Gulp on the weed edges or a jig and twister tail in the holes in the weeds. We haven't used live bait up there for many years. Gulp and Powerbait.
1338572,kansasity,2011-08-08 21:48:00,80,"I don't think I would work out with this guy, we would butt heads right off the bat. Sounds like it's maybe changed hands recently?"
1338600,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-09 05:31:00,725,"KC, he has owned the resort for many years. Like my fishing buddy says, we live among crazy people, so if he is as described, we'll be fine. I will certainly post when we return. We are going in Sept. Still welcoming further input. thanks in advance"
1338713,Guest,2011-08-09 10:32:00,0,"I have fished Raleigh. Good numbers but trout are very small. If you want to fish trout there are far better options in the Ignace area. In terms of the other lakes that Cobblestone has boats on, there are better options in terms of getting to and fishing these lakes. The map on his website which shows a gravel road going directly north from the lodge is very deceptive. There is a road there but it will not get you to Arethusa or Kukukus. The lakes that you will primarily be fishing are accessed by a gravel road that runs directly north of Ignace, just off of Highway 599. The road is called the 325 Road by the locals. The map error is not by chance. You will end up spending an additional 45 minutes driving each day getting to the 325 Road when you leave from Cobblestone as opposed to resorts like Agimac River Outfitters or Rousseau's Landing which are either on 325 or at the start of it. Can't comment on the new owner of Agimac River Outifitters but I have not heard bad things yet. John Rousseau, the new owner of what was formerly Flayers Lodge always treated us very well when he ran the bait shop in town. 325 is typically very rough and is one long stretch of washboard because it is not being graded anymore. Arethusa and Kukukus have good walleye fishing. Both of these lakes have public access points but Kukukus it getting to the point where it is almost too rough to bother. Rousseau has boats on Kukukus. Anyone who tells you that you should not be using jigs when fishing walleye in the Ignace area either does not fish or has another agenda so read whatever you want into that. As stated previously in other responses there is normally a good walleye bite happening in the pondweed at this time of year and jigs will work great."
1338784,Guest,2011-08-09 15:20:00,0,"We have always called pondweed cabbage. I spent nine days on Kukukus this year and I have been taking that 325 road for more than 30 years. It is rough and that helps keep the riff raff out but there are more people in there than ever it seems like. The willows have overgrown the last seven miles of road so bad that they scratch the sides of your truck the whole way. We caught probably 80% of our walleyes out of the cabbage this year, there was a huge number of small perch in the weeds and the walleyes were in there with them. Yes there is a road that goes from Cobblestone to Arethusa and Kukukus, I have taken it many times. I just came out that way with a group two weeks ago. Cliff claims that he paid to have it built himself, but I wonder. Maybe that's one of the reasons why he gets so crazy when people go that way that are not paying to stay in his lodge. There is a lot of tension between the resort owners and the do-it-yourself fishermen who go to these remote lakes. The resort owners have tried to get the roads closed and the lakes desingated walk-in or fly-in lakes. The high price of camping permits was the crown's response to that. Some compromise. The resort owners do not realize that the campers spend a lot of money in town and they aren't going to stay at resorts if they can't camp, they'll just go somewhere else."
1342726,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-22 19:49:00,725,I just wanted to get this thread back on the front page one more time. We are two weeks out and I wanted to see if any newbies or casual lookers have any further input about Cobblestone. I will definitely post upon our return. Thanks in advance.
1345357,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-30 18:47:00,725,"I admit, I am a little scared,"
1345418,h8go4s,2011-08-30 20:58:00,1673,"I was there last week and was pretty disappointed. The fishing probably could be better other times of the year, but we were not impressed. The first thing Cliff does is sit down with you at a table and demonstrate how to put a minnow on the hook of his spinner rigs. He has a tray with 4 different colors of spinners and says you should have at least 2 of each. Cliff kept saying we should be catching 60-70 walleyes apiece each if we'd just listen to him. Listening to him means fishing with his spinners and his minnows. Says these lakes are too clear and cold, you'll catch 3 to 1 more walleyes with minnows than crawlers or leeches. We used our own spinners and crawlers, thank you. As far as temp and color, other than Raleigh, I can't see that his lakes are any different from the many fly-in lakes around Ear Falls and Red Lake I've fished. Luckily, he was pretty busy with bear hunters that week. I asked him how often he gets to fish and he actually said he hasn't fished walleyes in 10 years. His wife also told us we need to switch from braided line to mono because Cliff says braided line floats and you don't get your bait down to the bottom. Credibility zero as far as I'm concerned. We also got tired of driving 20+ miles (one way) daily on horrible roads, then packing in our gear to fish in a 14' boat with a 9.9 hp motor. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I'd much rather have a boat on the lake at the resort. I don't see much sense in having a resort on a lake with nothing but small lakers. I hope you have better fishing than we did; just smile and nod at Cliff."
1345702,go dart,2011-08-31 18:31:00,77,You have got to post a picture of this guy when you return. My imagination is running wild. I mean I'm picturing Andy Worhol.
1317748,HeHooksHimself,2011-06-13 11:17:00,725,My fishing buddy and I have a trip planned here late in the year. First timers at this lodge. Anyone having experience with this camp willing to share? I like the idea of a different lake each day. Lodge owner suggests that the walleye fishing is unique and what works other places may not work here. Any feedback re: Raleigh Lake? It sounds like it may have a lot of pressure. Thanks in advance
1317878,buckx37,2011-06-13 15:37:00,7,"We were there last july, We had a good time caught good numbers of fish on some of the lakes and not as good on others. They have a mid week fish fry that was nice. The one thing we didnt care for is raliegh lake only has lake trout, it would have been nice to be able to go out early morn. and fish walleyes. We did no that ahead of time but I was up earlier than all of my group and I was after walleye. As far as nontypical walleye bite I caught them with some of the same technique we normally use."
1336925,Guest,2011-08-03 12:58:00,0,Our group has stayed here twice.We prefer the outpost cabin on Kukukus Lake.Excellent northern fishing with some nice walleye as well.Three lakes to fish from the outpost.We have not fished Raliegh but were told it has good lake trout and a few pike.
1336975,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-03 15:40:00,725,"Thanks Robert, I was about to post this again since we are 34 days away from our fall trip. If anyone else has any information about cobblestone lodge we would appreciate it!"
1336994,Guest,2011-08-03 17:02:00,0,"I stayed there one time. NEVER AGAIN. The guy (Cliff) who owns it is a nut case. Most days he is fine and then he just goes off. He really needs counseling or something. We were really scared when he freaked out. Seriously the guy is not all there. He went off on us for not fishing the way he told us to and where he told us to. I mean really freaked out. One day I told him that my boys just wanted to cast spinnerbaits for northerns, and he SCREAMED at me that I was going to ruin the trip for those boys if I did not buy the rigs he wanted us to use and 12 dozen minnows. One day he pointed his finger right in my face and accused me of being a jigger! That was bizzarre. Seriously the boats on his outpost lakes are very nice and he has a good system, but if something goes wrong, look out. The guy is a certifiable kook. I'll never go back there."
1337000,Guest,2011-08-03 17:17:00,0,"I just went back and re-read your post and I see the warning signs. He truly thinks that if you do not fish his way you are not going to catch anything. He tries to force you to buy his special rigs and a LOT of minnows each day. Depends on the day but he may just freak on you if you explain that you are going to catch them someother way. Whatever you do, do not tell him you can catch walleyes on jigs. Walleyes are walleyes everywhere you go. We caught them on everything from bottom bouncers to spinnerbaits, to jigs to crankbaits. We just lied to him when we got back in camp each evening about what we did so he didn't start screaming at us. It was the carziest five days I ever spent in a resort. Here's the scoop on the lakes that we fished: Kukukus: great smallmouth, great walleyes and lots of northerns with an occasional one over 35. I have fished Kukukus for 30 years but not out of his lodge (that really pissed him off) When he found out that I was going to Kukukus and not using his boats, he threw me out of his camp. I went back to the cabin and told the other guys about it. We all started packing and then he came to the cabin after he settled down and told us we didn't have to leave. We almost did anyway. Hawk, Small lake with nice notherns. I caught a 40 incher. Sally good walleye lake, mostly small walleyes. Arethusa, tons of walleyes, we caught several on spinnerbaits while fishing for pike. I have fished this lake before and knew it to be a great walleye lake so I knew what to do. We caught a lot of bottom bouncers and spinners. (and jigs) Raleigh only has lake trout and they run small. We had no trouble limiting on 12 inchers. We fished one more but I can't remember the name of it. I would love to hear your stories after you get back. If you just do everything he tells you to do, or better yet pretend that you did, you'll probably be fine. If not, it will be a bizarre week. Hide your jigs!"
1337025,trapperbob,2011-08-03 18:38:00,45,Wow I have never heard about such antics from an owner. With all the lakes to fish in Canada I would never subject myself to that kind of abuse.
1337196,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-04 08:55:00,725,"I realize that you are only one guy with one opinion, but that is interesting. We actually talked to some friends of friends that went there two years ago and said it was good, that the owner (Cliff) is very helpful. In his confirmation letter he is pretty adamant that these lakes are different (the claim that I heard was that the water is clearer than most) and you need to fish different. I will be sure to post a report. We are generally just jig or troll guys, and we like to use artificial when we can. Anyone else have any experience with this camp? Thanks for your input."
1337267,Guest,2011-08-04 11:26:00,0,"I know of one other guy who went to the camp and thought it was great. But he is not a serious fisherman and the just did everything the way Cliff told him to and everything was fine. The water clarity varies from lake to lake, but mostly they are the typical Canadian lakes with some tannic stained water, some a little less than the others. Cliff really has no clue about how to fish these lakes and I don't think he even really fishes much if at all. He just is so friggin adamant that you do it his way that if you don't he goes off on you. I know it sounds too crazy to be true, but just ask the six of us who were in camp for a while... it was really weird! Maybe he was just out of his medication when we were in camp."
1337295,jambi,2011-08-04 12:41:00,504,This should be interesting. Can't wait for the follow up report!!! Hope it turns out good for you though.
