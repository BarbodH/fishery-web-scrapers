1273296,EddieNorth,2011-02-20 17:21:00,32,"I beg to differ,I have driven the backroads to nakina at least 50 times,when you turn off the main hwy # 11 take the first road on the left ,its called the crib road,drive for 20 minutes through real nice country until you hit the newly paved road and stop sign,hang a right to nakina,we save at least a half an hour and most of the time 45 minutes,the backroads have been in great shape the last few yrs becuase the logging has been shut down.Cheers,Eddie"

1273397,Jack77,2011-02-21 05:20:00,168,I spoke with Kyle up Brace Lake and he said that he takes the roads all the time and they are fine and shorter. When in Rome.............

1350039,onetimedave,2011-09-16 06:09:00,502,Stay on the BLACKTOP road. Much easier and better.
1271681,Jack77,2011-02-16 09:54:00,168,My buddy and I were thinking about taking the logging road in from Longlac instead of coming in through Geraldton. We did this once before but it was about 10 years ago and the condition of the road was fine. There aren't any signs or directions of any kind but as long as you take a left at every major intersection you are ok. Has anyone been this way recently? if so how was the condition of the road?115 days until we board the plane for Brace Lake Outfitters..........can't wait.
1271692,Mike Borger,2011-02-16 10:20:00,1554,"Don't do it, the highway is way faster."
1271891,Mich_Fisherman,2011-02-16 19:31:00,292,Don't take the Manitouwadge trail.....stay on the highway
1272099,onetimedave,2011-02-17 11:06:00,502,Use the main roads. BLACKTOP IS THE ANSWER!!!!!!!
1272120,Jack77,2011-02-17 12:06:00,168,Where is your guy's sense of adventure? LOL
1272166,Mike Borger,2011-02-17 14:11:00,1554,Mine fades after hour 10 of a 15 hour drive. At that point it's get to Nakina asap so I can kick back and crack open a beer.
1272191,Fisherman1792,2011-02-17 15:13:00,927,Stay on the main hiway. I think they redid the surface up to Nakina a couple of years ago. Being a while since I have been there.Fisherman 1792
1272194,Crede,2011-02-17 15:15:00,134,"Had a friend take that ""shortcut"" 2 years ago. He spent the week referring to that decision as ""Not one of my smarter moves."""
1272214,mbay1455,2011-02-17 16:14:00,25,"Fishing the Nakina area means you'll spend some time on gravel roads for a few miles at a minimum at least. That doesn't mean you have to spend all that time if there is an alternative. To me, the choice is partly dependent on what you are driving and what you are pulling. If you are pulling a loaded boat or trailer you will either have to drive slowly which takes forever or put unnecessary wear on whatever you are hauling. Drove an older motor home up there on one of our many trips to that area and the shakin' and rattlin' was a true beating...and unnecessary. Going back in July. Can't wait. Good luck."
1272254,Mike Borger,2011-02-17 18:02:00,1554,"No it won't, unless you're continuing on past Aroland."
