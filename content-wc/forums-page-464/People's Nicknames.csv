1345468,81Saluki,2011-08-31 06:10:00,97,"The thread about naming holes got me thinking about the nicknames given to our group. We have ...

Makes some crazy calls with seemingly little in the hand, but many times ends up outdrawing his opponent! So now, when you lose hand that you maybe should have one, we call it getting ""johnnied""! We have a big group taking a late fall Lac Seul trip in a few weeks, maybe some new names will be given out!"
