I have been going to Gold Pines since about 1985 and couldn't imagine going anywhere else! Bill, Helen, and Peter are the best lodge owners a person could possibly want. They really will do whatever it takes to make sure everyone has a fun and productive visit. They make all the guests feel like family.The fishing was much better than the same week last year. Last year we had frost every morning and rpidly falling water temps to contend with. This year we had relative stability and I think that made the fish more predictable. One oddity though.......I have never spent a week on Lac Seul that didn't include a fair amount of time with whitecaps.........the lake was FLAT the whole week. Absolutely glass calm all day thursday and friday. Really weird for that lake. Didn't slow the walleyes though......just moved them a few feet deeper.First five days the walleyes were found at 16-18' and most were caught vertical jigging or trolling Flicker Shads and Jointed Shad Raps. No trouble catching all the slot fish you wanted with a few below and a few above. Last couple days the fish moved to 24-32' with warmer temps and calm conditions. Caught more fish these days on a simple walking sinker/float/hook/worm or walking sinker/floating jighead. Last day I trolled bottom bouncers fairly quickly and did really well. The fish were scattered and not bunched up on any particular type of spot.......but if you saw them on the finder, it was almost a sure bet they would bite. We would pull up on a spot, catch 2-5 fish, and move on to another spot. Did most of our fishing in the Goose Island/Lunker area since we did as well there as we did in Steamboat and Mackenzie and used a lot less gas! I know a lot of you aren't big on pike, but I love them and Lac Seul steadily has gotten better for large pike IMHO since the slot was instituted. My best for the week was 41"", but I caught several high thirties fish that were super fat and healthy. Even caught some over-the-slot walleyes on a Shallowraider fishing for pike.Can't wait to go back!http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0155.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0142.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0137.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...7/100_0165.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...9-04123146.jpgMatt"
1349451,tlars,2011-09-13 20:50:00,137,Looks like fun. I leave with 11 other guys for SWWL at noon on Friday. On the lake by 1:00 PM Fri. Home on Thursday. The 4 days in between are some of the best fishing times of the year. Brett and the rest of the staff treat us like royalty.
1349464,MorganMan,2011-09-13 21:24:00,341,Thanks for the update....still couple weeks to go for us!
1349521,wallydave,2011-09-14 07:23:00,2151,"We were up in June fishing out of Goose Bay Camp, Saturday, our first day, was windy and the waves were rough, like usual. Most of the rest of the week, like posted above, the lake was flat and calm for several days. Our group has been fishing out of GBC for over 10 years, we had never seen the Lac that calm for that long! We did have some variation in the temps and fronts moving thru, with slowed the fishing, but we still caught enough for a daily fish fry, plus we brough home our limits! We will be back next June!"
1349981,fire105,2011-09-15 18:51:00,40,flntkp17: just checking on the water levels at the other side of Lac Seul. We were at Pelican lake just out side of Sioux lookout and the water levels were down 4'. I'm just looking to see if the second turbin that they installed at Ear Falls is really causing the water levels to drop.
1350038,flntknp17,2011-09-16 06:01:00,151,"Water level at Ear Falls was down about 14-18"" below normal IMHO. It has been very dry there lately. Water was definitely not more than 18"" down. I was there one year in the late 80's and the water was down about 4' on Lac Seul. Made navigation a nightmare. Matt"
1350061,tv4fish,2011-09-16 07:40:00,2694,"Matt: I/we remember that well. When the water is low - you have to watch for ""new"" rock outcroppings. When the water is high - you have to watch for floating timber. The wood isn't so bad, unless you have good sized waves to ""hide"" it."
