1349670,tv4fish,2011-09-14 13:37:00,2694,"Good on ya' (Although - that trip that you make by yourself) -- as you do get closer to 100, you just MAY want to have a partner with -- as you never know what might happen."
1349953,lcwhit,2011-09-15 16:40:00,104,trying to go more. can't find anyone to go with. the young ones are broke and the old ones are arthritic. took my wife this year for first trip. hope it will turn into a regular event. my sister in law went also and all she did was complain so i cannot see her returning. oh well.
1350051,Stu,2011-09-16 06:59:00,472,"I have been going every-other-year since 1993. Now that I have a son, we are going to start going once a year. However, our group size has dwindled considerably. Mainly due to the DUI restrictions. The economy has never really been a factor. Even when gas jumped to $4 a gallon, we just had to save a little more money."
1350295,Pat,2011-09-16 19:19:00,203,Been going almost once a year for a week to 2 weeks since the 1960's. Now retirement is in sight and hope the length of time and number of annual trips swells significantly!
1349221,LOW1,2011-09-13 08:28:00,2828,Currently we go 3 or 4 times per year. I anticipate a time when there will be only 1 trip-from May 20 to October 10.
1349225,nitrodude,2011-09-13 08:36:00,60,"We've been fishing LS, 'Taki, Abrahms, Pelican and the area for the last week of June since '95. In the past four years we've stretched our week to a 10 day trip and still can't get enough. Looking forward to next June already!"
1349228,3M TA3,2011-09-13 08:42:00,2846,"More. Lots more, because I retired 3 years ago."
1349230,Babamel2,2011-09-13 08:52:00,414,"going more, as I have reached retirement age. was up for three weeks this year."
1349232,WalleyeWally28,2011-09-13 09:02:00,298,More since I retired. Twice a year for the last four years. Once a year prior to that.
1349238,tlars,2011-09-13 09:21:00,137,Twice a year since I started going 8 years ago. One trip with my wife and one with the guys. Looking forward to possibly adding a 3rd trip after retirement in a few years.
1349392,Fishin Fun,2011-09-13 17:34:00,218,"Definately more. I was going every year until 2002 when my dad passed away. After that I didn't want to go back because the previous trips were ""dad's"" trips. But I started going back again in 2009 with my father-in-law and my mom's new husband."
1349421,AllenW,2011-09-13 19:21:00,11482,"Unfortnately less, having made a 30+ year run of hitting Red in late Sept, time has taken it's toll, many of the guys are either gone, don't fish much anymore, or don't seem to have the time.Haven't made it in a couple years now.Retirement is in a year, hopefully things will change then.Al"
1349642,drlee,2011-09-14 11:13:00,409,"I spend from 3-4 weeks in northern Ontario annually. I spend 1 week with my son, grandson and 3-4 other guys; I spend 1 week with a fishing buddy from my hometown. I spend 1 week by myself, which I really enjoy. I have spent a 4th week in the past and am planning to again next summer. I have been going to Canada since 1987 (maybe missed 1 or 2 years...can't remember). When I was still working, it was for a week. Now I have been retired for 5 years and have spent the 3-4 weeks mentioned above. I will continue to go (I am 66) until I simply cannot make it anymore. So, I figure I only have about 35 more years to fish."
1349653,cast_and_blast,2011-09-14 12:41:00,1098,"Less to Canada, but just as much fishing. Used to do a fly-in out of Red Lake, then that his $1K per man (up from $575) when fuel prices jumped and Ontario had their insurance issue. Then we did houseboats for a few years, now we rent a place on Rainy. As happy if not happier with this and we don't have to fish out of crappy fly-in boats. Doesn't help that the CAD and USD are about at par or even a slight advantage to the CAD. Don't miss paying duty on extra liquor either. Scott"
1348971,Mike Kansas,2011-09-12 13:26:00,1463,Wondering how many of us are going to Canada more or Less than we did 5 years ago? What is the your reason for more or less?
1349055,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-12 18:15:00,235,"Seeing as I've only gone twice out of the last five years (having made eight years straight prior to that), I'm going less now - at least on paper. However, I missed three of the last five years due to special circumstances (started a new job one year, and had to support my wife while she went back to grad school for the next two years). I plan to go at least once a year, and may even add a second trip for the first time ever. Can't get enough of that (relatively) untapped fishing and wilderness experience. I'm 34 and have started a retirement savings over the past 10 years - my goal is to be able to enjoy Canada at least once a year for as long as I can physically do it. Hopefully, with advances in medicine, I'll be 100 years old and posting pictures of my 30 inch walleye in 2077."
1349064,JayM5209,2011-09-12 18:48:00,1050,"More. Been doing an early season week with the guys for 32 years - always the week of Memorial Day. Retired five years ago and started doing a 2nd trip in August each year. The second trip is just my son and me. He started going along when his 1st trip was a birthday present for his 16th. Ten years ago he started teaching and can't go with the gang of old guys, so he and I started our August trips. Next year I plan to add a 3rd annual excursion . . . a solo trip in September.Neither the HST, nor exchange rate, nor waits at the border will deter me from at least two, and hopefully three trips north each year to enjoy the solitude, good fishing, and warm hospitality of our neighbors to the north!"
1349070,Moondog,2011-09-12 18:59:00,362,More. Retired in 2000 and have been spending progressively more time there every year.....This year 7 weeks straight. Continues to slowly creep up from those #alls to the walls trips we used to make before we retired. Can't even imagine what it would be like to only fish there for a week now.
1349083,Golden Eagle,2011-09-12 19:42:00,2642,"Shoulder surgery kept me from a fall trip in 2010. Up there 15 days in May 2011, 8 days in August 2011 and will fly in September 24 - out October 4. September 2011 is a pretty good year.Won't be making it up yonder in 2077."
1349187,orchard frank,2011-09-13 07:17:00,1900,"Spent most of my adult life from high school on traveling to Canada on fishing trips, wife and I spent both our honeymoon and 25th up there. Often 2-3 weeks/yr. Retired to a fishing paradise (BaydeNoc area), have family (and grandchild) in Florida, so our travel budget sends us there. Turns out there is some pretty cool fishing there too! Actually, I miss some of the friends we made up there more than the fishing, but the fishing was great too. I think fall of 2004 was the last time we've been up. Some of the best and most memorable times of our lives."
1349194,wallydave,2011-09-13 07:43:00,2151,"My first trip up North was in the late 90's, we had a large group, 10-12. Over the years the size of the group is now down to 6. With a smaller group, it seems the motivation to plan a trip, the scheduling of time off, getting on to your lake of choice, and travel time, has also been reduced. After a couple of years of not going, boat/cabin buddy recovering from back surgery, and changes in careers, we have always had our plans and memories on the ""back burner"". At times it is hard to put together a group that works together for a good trip, a good trip is much more than just the fishing, it is the travel, the time with friends in the cabin, around the camp fire, in the boat, and the fish cleaning house that make the trip, great fishing never hurts either!For now we have a small but stable group to make memories up North with, I would like to grow the group, but that takes time. For now we had a good trip this year, we have our cabin and boat reserved for next year!"
1349196,tv4fish,2011-09-13 07:45:00,2694,"More actually ""double"" -- Have been going at least once every year since 1985. Had a couple of years when I had a ""bonus"" trip with just one of my buddies (instead of the usual 2 buddies that go once EVERY year). This year had an extra with the Son and Grandson - next year will have another extra with the better half (she also has gone with me before for an ""extra"" trip). Still working - but upon retirement I see at least 2 trips every year."
1349204,bcmss396,2011-09-13 07:55:00,296,"I grew up going to Canada with the family. As I started working with people in adult world, we had a group of guys that went every year (between 8 and 15 guys - depending on schedules). Slowly that group dwindled and eventually disbanded after 12 annual trips.My trips continue, but now with my family (wife and 3 kids -10, 7 & 3) and my folks. Sometimes my brother will join us, but not regularly.Big groups of diverse personalities take alot of planning to ensure everything happens. If no one is interested enough to ask anymore, I'm content not doing the work to put it together.Two weeks of Family time is better than any men's trip ever was.Blair"
1349215,vteye,2011-09-13 08:07:00,812,I love Canada and the 8-10 trips will never forget. I am on back side of educating 3 sons and that has been the recent holdup but working through these years.
