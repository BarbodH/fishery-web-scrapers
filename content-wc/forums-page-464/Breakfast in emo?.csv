1347594,chevtow,2011-09-07 14:27:00,691,Somebody new bought that rest. in Emo and fixed it up a bit. I've only eaten breakfast there and it's pretty good and reasonable.
1347638,ManitouBass,2011-09-07 16:27:00,201,"Yeppers, I live just down the road and we eat there a few times per month. Breaky is good, but so are the lunches and suppers. Again, it's nothing fancy, but the servings are good, the food is good and its pretty cheap. There is also a place called CanAsian about a half block down too, but its not my cup of tea."
