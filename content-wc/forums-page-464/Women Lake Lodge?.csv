1320623,teddi,2011-06-20 17:10:00,349,great place to go. good people and good fishing.
1342315,stinkycat,2011-08-21 16:08:00,2018,Heading up to Women Lake Lodge Ontario on 9-6-11. Hoping to find some Lake Trout and eyes. Any suggestions on methods and tackle? I have never fished for lake trout and I have heard they should be in shallow again. I would also assume for the eyes that jig & minnows would do well. Any suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks!http://www.womanlakelodgecanada.com/
1342357,HeHooksHimself,2011-08-21 18:36:00,725,"We have fished the system, but have always stayed at Woman River Camp, which accesses Big Woman Lake. I have caught trout in Big Woman in the shallows in the spring and pulled a 42"" northern out a few years ago. Shanty Bay produces nice walleyes in spring but our fall trip produced sporadic bites there in the fall. Nice smallies in Little Woman down the river a bit. it is a beautiful system, but there seems to be a fair amount of boat traffic with a public ramp. Best of luck, please post a report.JW"
1342458,Mohleye,2011-08-22 08:12:00,368,"Boat traffic should not be a problem in early Sept. WLL is a long way from the public landing. There are several good spots for trout fishing near WLL. Your camp owner should be able to help you with spots and methods to try. They may be up a bit shallower by early Sept, but not up in the shallows spawning. That would be a little later in the fall, I'd think."
1342638,stinkycat,2011-08-22 16:35:00,2018,Thanks to the info guys. I will report any and all when we get back! Can't wait only 14 days to go
1349179,stinkycat,2011-09-13 07:04:00,2018,"Had a great time at Women Lake Lodge We were up there only three days but caught to many walleyes to count. The biggest being about 22-23"". All caught on a jig/minnow combination. Jig color that seemed to work the best was green/chartreuse Oddball jig. Most fish were caught in 8-12' but that is just a guess because we hardly ever used our depth finder. Seanerey was unbeleivable. To get to the fish camp it is a 26 mile boat ride. Very remote and private. Besides the Women Lake Lodge boats we only saw 6-8 other boats all three days. They have several remote portage lakes and we went to one of them and had a great adventure and caught tons of fish. I think a guy could spend an entire summer at this fish camp and only see/fish half whats available. The new owners are planning and already starting some great improvements. Can't wait to get back next spring. I have already booked for next June. Total"
1349197,Mohleye,2011-09-13 07:48:00,368,Did you do any trout fishing?
1349200,stinkycat,2011-09-13 07:52:00,2018,Trout..... tried for a couple of hours one morning. We we in 60+ feet of water with down riggers pulling a minnow or spoon or rap. We had one hit but no fish. I saw tons of fish on the graph from 35' to 65' but not sure if they were trout or eyes. Another group said they were catching some bigs eyes out in the deep water and pulling them up from 35+ feet. Hope to find some trout next spring.
