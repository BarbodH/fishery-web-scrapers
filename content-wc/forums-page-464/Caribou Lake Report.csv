Then the smoke moved in for a bit and then a little rain, wind, and some cooler weather. All in all a great trip. Caught a couple 25 inchers, and lots of eaters. My dad caught a great walleye. On the last day and last hour of fishing, he hauled in a 31 inch Walleye, 8 pound, 7 ounces. He did not catch many fish, but sure ended the trip with a great fish."
