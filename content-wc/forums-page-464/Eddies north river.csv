On day one eddie took us out for a ride to show us the area, which i have never had an outfitter do, so that really helped. Eddie was there all week with us. The boats ran good, the cabins were in excellent working order. His generator blew up, so he rigged to small generators up to allow the camp to run without a hitch....eddie came around every night to our cabin, and even met us after fishing every day. If we needed anything he was right on it. The walleye were a little slow, but we ate fish 5 times while in camp. We had a problem getting small fish to eat. We caught at least 4 walleye over 31 inches and to many to count 22-26 inches. The pike fishing is out of this world. It is a big fish river. We caught 12-15 over 40 inches, biggest 48, with a few more monsters unable to be boated after a long fight. After day 3 we stopped counting the fish over 35 inches. To many to keep track of. This was for us a fishing trip of a life time. I have been going up north for 10 years and have never had fishing like this. I will be going back for years to come. I can not say enough of how eddie treated us in before our arrival and while we were there. This is the best place i have been to by far.. Thank you eddie, you have a wonderful place. Look forward to seeing you next year."

1348872,Falcon1,2011-09-12 09:39:00,3,"I had the pleasure of being at Eddie North with GoBig, and a pleasure it was. I had caught the second largest pike of my life. It was 48"". We had netted so many pike over 30"" that we stop counting them. I lost three lures, because the pike had pulled open the clasps on the leaders. Of all the years of fishing in Canada, I have never had any problems with this happening to leaders before. So if you go to Eddie's, make sure you have super strong and long leaders. A couple of other items to have are a large net (Eddie does have cradles.) if you want to net your fish, and a larger than normal mouth spreader. I had several fish in which a normal size spreader would just fall into their mouth. As for the walleye, they were supersize. I had hooked one walleye, and my boatmate and I thought it was a carp. The walleyes were huge. We did not catch a lot of walleyes but had more than enough to eat. Imagine if we would have been at Eddie's during their annual run. You will not get a better person than Eddie. He was constantly around to see if he could assist us in anyway. Eddie, I will be back. Thanks again for the shore lunch."

1349815,Mike Borger,2011-09-15 06:17:00,1554,"Having fished Beteau in all seasons including the first week of the season, the walleye fishing seems to improve as the season progresses. By all accounts late summer is prime time up there. Not sure what the early season pattern is. We figured the same, that it would be ridiculously easy with all the fish being in obvious current areas. That wasn't the case though, it was very strange. Hopefully a better man than me can crack the early season walleye code up there. On the plus side, early season is just spectacular for trophy pike. They're large, abundant and predictable."
