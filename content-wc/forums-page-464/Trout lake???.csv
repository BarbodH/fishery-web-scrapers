1349833,mroyle,2011-09-15 07:46:00,74,I've been to Booi's and Cat Island Lodge but not Trout Lake Lodge. My buddy organizes an early June company trip every year for about 30 guys. They've been going there for over 10 years and are obviously happy as they continue to return. Since it's a corporate trip they use guides and have meals prepared by the Lodge. They catch tons of Walleye in 6-8 feet of water & also quite a few Lake Trout & Pike when they fish for them. I believe Green Airways operates Trout Lake Lodge so an internet search for Green Airways lodges should yield some results. Trout Lake Lodge is on the far north end (I believe) of the lake & quite a distance from the other lodges I mentioned. For whatever reason I believe they stay open for only a brief period in June/July. Hope this helps. If you have any specific questions I may be able to get answers from my buddy.
