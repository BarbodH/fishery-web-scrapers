1350309,remmy,2011-09-16 20:21:00,6,"I started going to Minnitaki around age 10 with my family. I continued until just out of high school. About 5 yrs ago (I'm 32 now) my parents talked my brother and I to go back north with them for a ""final"" family trip to a fly in outpost for their 30th wedding anniv. Both my older bro and I just had a great time, and my folks.... After that trip, we were able to talk a few friends into going back up with us. My bro is getting married this fall so he was not able to go this year but our group found another to go our age who is hooked for life. This year our group of 4 was approx 32, 31, 31 and 28. All of us will be going back next year to a different outpost to try to see if we can outdo this year. Just a very enjoyable trip to look forward to every year now!!"
1350426,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-17 13:08:00,235,"Here's a question: how early of an age is it right to take a kid up to Canada. I would guess around 12 or 13, or as soon as they're able to handle themselves with a rod and reel. There's something about them being a little older when you can let them sip a beer, say a swear word or other ""rites of passage"" that are milestones with your old man."
1349724,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-14 17:49:00,235,"Two guys in their 30's, and four in their 60's. Fathers/sons accounts for the age difference. I'm 34 and trying to arrange a trip with fishing friends my age. My friends already go to the Boundary Waters and/or Sylvania Wilderness each year. I'm trying to sell them on the comforts of a solid roof over your head, a motor boat to get around, and available cold beer. Problem is, most of my friends don't want to spend the extra money."
1349794,SinOrSwim,2011-09-14 22:35:00,1528,I don't know all the ages. I do know we have gotten fatter and balder as the years have passed.
1349836,falkopat,2011-09-15 07:50:00,44,"yeah this last year he shows us up pretty good, beat all of us by at least 50 walleyes. it might also help he spends about 5-6 weeks a year in canada fishing or hunting no that he is retired."
1349853,nitrodude,2011-09-15 08:50:00,60,"Our core group of six consists of ages 73, 54, 51, 44, 22, 16, and 12. We have had additions to our two cabin minimum over the years, but have always had a wide age range of fellas. Our yearly ""Guy's Trip"" dates back to its' origin in 1963 at the same place, same time. For me, it's been consecutive trips to the LS area since 1995. I'm already anxious for next June!"
1349866,jfsh,2011-09-15 09:49:00,13,"Most years we're a group of eight with the age range of: 58, 56(2), 52, 30, 27(2), 20."
1349873,SteveJ715,2011-09-15 10:17:00,59,"This year it was just me (30) and my Dad (69), so the average age is 49.5. I've been trying to get a group of my friends to go for years -- I've been taking trips almost every year since I was 9. All but two have been with my Dad. Like Ten Horse Johnson, I keep running into problems trying to get guys my age to commit to going. I know a few of my friends would love it, but between the cost and the vacation time and the time away from the family, it's tough for them. Now that we've started going to a drive-to lodge, the cost shouldn't be as much of a factor. Gotta just start leaning on them, I guess. (Not that I don't want to go with my Dad -- I'd just want a bigger cabin with a bigger group.)I agree with the central idea of the post, that it seems like the average age of the guests at a given Canadian lodge is up there in the 50s or higher. I think at least part of that, though, is your relative station in life -- maybe it's a little easier to come up with the bucks and the vacation time when you're more advanced in your career and your kids are a little older, etc.I have a son who's 1. I've already told my Dad he needs to take good care of himself so the three of us can pile into a boat together up in Canada in about nine years. If there's any trip I'm looking forward to more than next year's, that's it.- Steve"

1349631,Guest,2011-09-14 10:53:00,0,"Birds of a feather flock together. In this case I believe our ages overall dictate who we hang around with and usually, not always, we gravitate toward those with simalar ages because overall we have more in common. Kids and grand kids tend to skew those 'averages'. I will say though that I fish regularly with my son in law. We both have similar feathers when it comes to fishing often."
