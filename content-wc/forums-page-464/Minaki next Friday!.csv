1349559,camp chef,2011-09-14 08:23:00,915,"Check with Big North Lodge.They are south of Minaki and I know when we were there, several groups launched and parked there before heading out to their private cabins"
1349578,Aaron-IN,2011-09-14 09:02:00,500,"No overnight parking at Pistol lake? I parked there for a week back in July with no problems, is this new? My dad parks there all summer and has for the past 20 years."
1349888,briand,2011-09-15 11:17:00,48,"I havn't looked for years but there was a sign for the longest time about no over night camping, not sure about parking.All summer long there are trucks & cars parked"
1350081,TerryTacklebox,2011-09-16 08:27:00,6,"Unfortunately, there was a sign at the launch indicating no overnight parking. My buddy did park for 2 nights and nothing happened. There were a couple of trucks parked there the whole time we were there (3 nights)."
1350211,Aaron-IN,2011-09-16 14:48:00,500,I'll take my chances
1344026,TerryTacklebox,2011-08-26 12:55:00,6,Hello fellow Walleye Central folks!As a first time user although many times visitor I really enjoy reading your posts.Next Friday I'll be on the river a few miles south of Minaki. A friend has a cabin that his grandfather built about 50 years ago. It sure is a great place to fish and enjoy the outdoors!If anyone has advice on walleyes and smallmouth south of Minaki I would really appreciate it. We've been to big sand before but usually fish areas within a few miles of the cabin. Thanks and I'm looking forward to your comments!
1344080,Campcountry,2011-08-26 15:31:00,164,"Hi Terry,I fish a lot in the area south of Minaki and this time of year I am usually fishing for Walleye in 25 to 45 feet of water - usually bottom bouncing. Bass can be found gorging on crayfish in the rocky shallows in the afternoon / early evening. Also bass at the weed edges and adjacent areas.I have a number of walleye and bass fishing videos all shot in the area south of Minaki that you may want to check for some tips. - http://www.youtube.com/user/CampCountry"
1344550,TerryTacklebox,2011-08-28 09:38:00,6,"Thanks for the reply and info CampCountry! I have been watching your videos over the last few weeks and have really enjoyed them. Please keep making them.In fact, when I pick up a little heavier fluorocarbon I will try making a few of your spinner rigs.Tight lines,TT"
1344611,KSauers,2011-08-28 15:41:00,385,"I'li be up there in about a week and a half. Fish mostly Big Sand for eyes and what's it like in early Sept.? Will be there thurs, or fri. after labor Day. Will they still be on the reefs? Most of my time will be spent musky fishing."
1344651,TerryTacklebox,2011-08-28 17:56:00,6,The few times I've been out to Big Sand during early September the walleyes have still been on the reefs. Campcountry recommended bottom bouncers in 25 to 45 feet. That sounds about right. Although we don't typically fish muskies sometimes we'll get some incidentally. There are some big ones out there! Good luck!
1344744,Campcountry,2011-08-28 22:19:00,164,Thanks for letting me know you enjoyed the videos!
1344776,Campcountry,2011-08-29 06:31:00,164,They will still be on the reefs in September during the middle of the day anyway. Yesterday morning I was finding them in 20 to 25 FOW off points and saddles. In relation to when the sun rises and when I rise - that would have been earlier in the day than a couple of weeks ago. (I usually don't start fishing before the crack of 9:00).The days are noticeably shorter now than they were just a couple of weeks ago and the fish. A few weeks ago the sun was so high by 9:00 am that it was like mid day in September. Depending on the time of day you are fishing you may have to experiment with depth a bit.
1344931,briand,2011-08-29 11:46:00,48,"The last 2 weekends we've been fishing the bottom end of little/big Sand.Trolling with bottom bounces, spinners tip with a 1/3 of a worm.Last weekend was the first time fishing in minaki that we didn't have a fish walleye fry. ( we had to pull trout out of the freezer )Every fish was over 20"" with the biggest being 27""18' - 22' was our magic depth"
1349323,TerryTacklebox,2011-09-13 13:40:00,6,Thanks again for the suggestions. Although it was short we had a great time in Minaki.The smallies were excellent and the walleye fishing was good. Most of the walleyes were 14 to 17 inches. Crawlers with jigs or spinners with bottom bouncers did the trick. Fish were mostly 14 to 30 feet. We remained south of Minaki fishing the reefs and current areas around the islands.I noticed the public launch in Pistol no longer allows for overnight parking. If anyone has any suggestions on where to park a truck and trailer let me know. Although I understand the local businesses need the revenues it sure has been nice to park for free. Our group does enjoy stopping in for bait and some other essentials that the excellent local bait shops and marinas supply.
1349330,Reels,2011-09-13 13:49:00,2876,"The marina will let you park in their locked fenced in lot. I think I paid 5 bucks for the week. Not sure, but it was cheap."
