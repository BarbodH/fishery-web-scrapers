1350575,Angry Minnow,2011-09-18 08:35:00,14,"Thanks for the input guys got a e-mail from Lac Seul Lodge there booked out thru the 1st week of sept. Lac Seul Outpost has a awsome web sight and probobly does a nice job but for the price it would be a tough sell over the fly-in. Mahkwa I never herd of I need to look at yet, does anyone know how many miles that road is? Also I have to say (being a guy thats into maps) LSO has the best map so far on there sight. Anyone know how to get my hands on the other three sections?"
1350621,JDP,2011-09-18 10:49:00,1457,"Regarding Mahkwa, keep calling....leaving messages often does not work. Info on the road: The last 21 miles are gravel, of that 21 miles, 7 miles are on the ""new road"" that is about 3 years old. This road can be fairly rough---anyway it has been for us in May the last 3 years. Check this link for maps: Map"
1349994,Angry Minnow,2011-09-15 19:44:00,14,"Looking for a camp on Lac Seul, We have a group of about eight and we have been doing fly-ins for eighteen plus years. In all this time only one or two of us have ever fished Lac Seul. So now that we've decided to go for it, were do we go? One thing they all want is to still be remote, so I'm thinking boat in outpost. Appriciate any info."
1350004,rdbalmer,2011-09-15 21:15:00,279,"It has been a few years since I have been up to Lac Seul but I do remember seeing an outpost cabin up near Little Chamberlain Narrows. At that time I believe it was run by Anderson's Camp just out of Sioux Lookout. I am sure if you google it you could get their phone number ore-mail and check it out. It is in a very good area for fishing but honestly you would have to expect to see some boats once in a while, not like a fly in where you have a lake to your self. To my knowledge there are not any roads close by so yes it is remote. It would be about a 1 1/2 hr boat ride to get there. There may be others also but that is the only one I know of on the east ind of Lac Seul. Good Luck Rob"
1350009,Hawkfan,2011-09-15 21:41:00,237,"We are going on our group's first trip to Lac Seul in a little over a week. We came across this one when we were looking for a place to go, but the outpost was not big enough for our group. It sounds like it would be just big enough for yours. http://www.fishlacseul.com/outpost.html"
1350078,falkopat,2011-09-16 08:16:00,44,"if you are looking for a different experience we have been doing houseboats for year. you can park it anywhere, next to other fisherman or in the middle of no where. The only downfall is spending the time driving your lodge up there(we enjoy the drive its relaxing)Lac suel floating lodges is a great opperation. Tell andrea that the falkowski's sent you if you decide that route. we have a video posted from a few years ago on their website- be warned we swear alittlehttp://www.lacseulfloatinglodges.com/comments.htmlpatrick"
1350126,Steve Ediger,2011-09-16 11:10:00,97,Lac Seul Lodge has two outposts on Lac Seul. One is up in Sunlight Lake and one is in Black Bay. Fishing around both is great. Give them a call @ (807) 222-2107.
1350130,dan cardinal,2011-09-16 11:20:00,64,"Thus far all the suggestions are good ones. All though there may be a bad option or two, hard to go wrong on Lac Seul. I have done much research on Lac Seul for the same reason....wanted a remote place accessible to great fishing. I have a friend that has fished out of Scout Lake Resort's McKenzie Bay Outpost for 25+ years in a row.... he highly recommends it. Although the only camp in McKenzie Bay, there are at least 6 other camps in the west section of Lac Seul that frequent that area....but still a good choice.Lac Seul Outposts is fairly remote. It is a 45 minute boat in to Chamberlain Narrows...northeast section of Lac Seul. Great fishing in this area also, but this area of the lake fishes a lot smaller to me....take a look at a map...small in comparison to the main basin. Very well run operation. Nice facilities and very comfortable. But in my opinion have gotten a little pricy over the years. But still a good option.Williams Lake Lodge is in the south central part of Lac Seul....one of 3 camps in this huge, spread out section of the lake. This camp is quietly and remotely situated on Williams Lake...has a drive-in landing and a 10 minute boat-in to the facilites. Williams Lake and Williams Bay are connected by a creek, which is one of the few draw backs to this camp. It is necessary to travel the creek each day to reach the main basin. It is a 20 minute trip each way. Once you get to the mouth Williams Bay (about 45 minutes from camp) I found the lake to be huge, spread out, remote, and endless fishing opportunities. I did see a few other boats each day, but I fished each day experiencing the quietness and tranquility that I have so much come to respect in the wilderness of Ontario. Lord only knows how many walleye are out there. I found them all over the place....good ones!If you are considering a early June trip, Williams Lake Lodge may not be the best choice. Lake levels in the early season can lend to Williams Creek being too low in water level to navigate. This camp does offer a portage, but not a good option in my opinion. Typically mid to late June through the rest of the season the creek is good to navigate. Ken and kathy are great host, and are working hard to update Williams Lake Lodge. The New Trappers Cabin would be a good choice for a group of eight. They also offer a single outpost cabin at the south end of Williams Lake, but I prefer the main camp....bigger boats/motors, etc. This camp is a great value. If you talk to Kathy tell her the Cardinals sent you.Another option is Mahkwa Lodge at the mouth of Vaughn Lake???? It is a drive-in, but another remote area of Lac Seul east of Williams Bay. This is a camp I would love to visit. Problem is they must have all the business they need. A member of our group tried booking for August 2012 and 2013...received no return phone calls, and only 2 return emails offering little hope that space would be available. Thoughts were we might get on a list in case of a cancellation...not the case."
1350188,tv4fish,2011-09-16 13:30:00,2694,"(Unless something has changed) It's a drive in on pretty rugged roads and then a short ferry crossing to get to the Mahkwa camp.Quote: Lac Seul Outposts is fairly remote.

1350196,dan cardinal,2011-09-16 14:09:00,64,"It is also my interpretation that the road to Mahkwa is a very rugged one, but also my understanding that a new road (also very rugged) takes you right into the lodge??? Can anyone comfirm that?In regards to remoteness of Lac Seul Outposts....I agree the Chamberlain Narrows area is fairly popular. However, I spent a week in early August fishing areas of Pecker Point and north and never saw another boat accept for a couple passing floating lodges and a few guys from our camp. The OP being committed to Lac Seul I was only attempting to point out areas less likely to have company...maybe there are ""completely"" remote areas of Lac Seul...I just haven't discovered them."
1350240,Bitinlight,2011-09-16 16:19:00,95,"You can't go wrong with Lac Seul Outposts at Chamberlain Narrows. One hour boat in, professionally run with top notch equipment, friendly and helpful staff and nice facilities, and tons of excellent fishing options from right off the dock to as close or as far as you want to travel from the camp. Ken and Brenda and their staff will take care of you. Chris,who is their right hand man, knows the lake like the back of his hand and will give you all the information you want on the fishing."
1350401,Rodney Bondele,2011-09-17 10:36:00,73,Mahkwa has a road all the way to camp. I believe there is no place on Lac Seul where you will not see boats on ocasion. I fished out of mahkwa last year. It is in the middle of the lake so less boats. The road to it is gravel for miles. If you have questions you can message me.Rodney Bondele
