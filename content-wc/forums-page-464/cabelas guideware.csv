1349766,Jigger1,2011-09-14 20:03:00,234,"I love my guidewear. I make two annual fishing trips and the guidewear is in the washing machine almost as soon as I walk through the door. No fabric softener, just detergent, wash warm. As soon as it comes out of the dryer it's hung in the closet and ready for the next trip. They say after time a topical water repellency for outdoor fabrics can be used. I've not reached that point with my gear."

1349898,Mike Kansas,2011-09-15 11:55:00,1463,Wife and I both have a set and all we do is wash them in warm water with minimal soap and hang them outside to dry. They are a great value and we have been 100% pleased with them. Last year my wifes jacket had two holes at the seam at the top of one of the sleeves. She took them to Cabelas and they replaced with no questions asked. Mike Kansas
1349917,zooks,2011-09-15 13:50:00,169,"Keeping it clean is really important, too. Anything that soils the fabric (dirt, fish slime, blood, etc.) breaks down the DWR coating that products like NikWax and ReviveX restore. The cleaner you keep your suit, the more durable it will be. Wash it using the recommended cleaner, reapply the recommended spray and tumble dry on high. Warm iron if you choose after completely dry. Do not use fabric softener under any circumstances. This goes for all your polypro, fleece and/or wool clothing as well. Softener breaks down DWR coating and plugs pores so clothes aren't as breathable. I do this 2-3 times a year or after a period of extended use for all my waterproof clothing. Hope this helps, good luck."
