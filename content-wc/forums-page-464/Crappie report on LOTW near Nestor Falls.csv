1348908,steve.a,2011-09-12 10:44:00,274,Has anyone heard if the crappie have turned on around Nestor Falls or Obabikon Lake? What about the walleyes?
1348950,Bill Krejca,2011-09-12 12:36:00,6107,"Sounds like the water/air temp is very warm, Obab. is slow. Water level is down. It is starting to look like a repeat of 2009, not the best for the time slot I have planned. Hope it changes by Saturday! Bill Krejca"
1348991,Hntnfsh4evr,2011-09-12 14:45:00,5,Next three days (Tue through Thurs) won't see highs above 60 and lows around 40. That should cool it quick. Next week has highs effectively normal but lows above normal with temps not anticipated to fall below 50.
1349015,steve.a,2011-09-12 15:52:00,274,Sounds like it might be a good year to try new spots and different tactics. But we say that every year and go back to the same old same old. Still beats working.
1349067,Obabikon,2011-09-12 18:54:00,2370,Obabikon Lake was very slow today. Sunken trees in 18-22 feet of water were very affective almost all of last week.
1349112,Rgate,2011-09-12 21:19:00,14,We just had a party check out who caught 50 large crappies - up to 14 inches - out west past North Island - Not much in the old holes yet - I caught 10 in Obabikon in 20 minutes a couple of weeks ago.
1349148,steve.a,2011-09-13 04:48:00,274,Is North Island in Miles Bay? How has the walleye fishing been?
