549278,JackSalmon,2005-06-15 01:33:00,169,"Thanks for all of the replies! This really helps us get started and we do appreciate all the help. We'll let you know where we eventually go. Thanks, JackSalmon"
549474,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-06-20 08:15:00,110,"Try AWO (Arctic Watershed Outfitters) out of Nakina. They have two outposts geared for small groups of 2/4 people. Price is right, fishing GREAT, great service. We have used these people 10 times. I have marked maps of several lakes. WWW.AWONAKINA.com web address."
549480,Guest,2005-06-20 10:26:00,0,Why are Artic Watershed Outposts somuch less money than other outfitters in Nakina and Armstrong?? Looks like their camps are on some good water and they use good baots and motors.
549525,jigman 2003,2005-06-21 05:58:00,981,"Check out www.matticelake.com Excellent outfitters, been using them for 6 years. First five was just my father and I. They have several camps where they will take a party of 2. One of the very few I found that would do so without an additional charge. Good luck and what a gift!"
549619,ONE TIME DAVE,2005-06-22 10:41:00,110,"AWO is a small family run operation with their main concern, ""happy customers"". They break their back to contain their costs, and therefor your cost is less. Most cabins have running water, showers, fish cleaning house, propane heat, lights, refrig, etc. Cabins are rustic but very serviceable. We have used them 10 times with number 11 next year. One nice thing is that you know within 30 minutes your departure time to lake and same for return to Nakina. Good people, service and fishing. Need any more info e-mail me direct, [email protected] or [email protected]."
550223,JackSalmon,2005-07-09 09:06:00,169,"We appreciate all the replies thus far. We have decided that we want to primarily fish for walleyes, but would like to go somewhere that has smallmouth, too. Any more comments or recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks, JackSalmon"
549110,JackSalmon,2005-06-12 19:46:00,169,"My son will graduate from HS in two years, and he has requested a Canadian fly-in for a graduation present. It will probably be just him and me. Any recommendations for a fly in of this type, and any places that will take just two?? Any help will be appreciated, JackSalmon"
549118,Guest,2005-06-13 07:13:00,0,What does he want to fish for?
549123,phishfearme,2005-06-13 07:54:00,1242,"jack - an excellent gift! the restriction of having just two people may result is significantly higher costs or force you to do the trip in the summer. this is for the ""one cabin on the lake housekeeping"" situation - lodges could possibly work better for you - it depends what you want with respect to privacy. also, some new outfitters will probably take two while they're getting established. the new outfitter we're using this year may accomodate you for two. his web site is: http://wesleyoutposts.com/. his name is charles wesley, an ojibway entrepreneur who is starting to take guests to his personal fishing and hunting lakes. there's lots of other possible outfitters who would probably work out something for you in july/august. we do our housekeeping fly-in the first two weeks of july, the fishing is still great with much more stabler weather and frequently, there's no one flying in after us resulting in a dead head flight which outfitters would love to fill. another option, check out this trip report from a few years ago:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...ng_type=search best of luck, phish"
549128,Guest,2005-06-13 08:37:00,0,"Try Chimo Lodge (www.chimolodge.com)out of Red Lake, the Roderick Lake camp. I'm pretty sure they have a housekeeping cabin to handle just two. Walleye, pike & lake trout."
549138,Guest,2005-06-13 11:03:00,0,TRY CHIMO LODGE ON RODERICK ISLAND. NICE PLACE LOTS OF FISH NICE PEOPLE. OUT OF RED LAKE. RESONABLE PRICE. JUST GOT BACK ON SATURDAY HAD A GREAT TIME. CHECK IT OUT ON THE INTERNET AT CHIMOLODGE.COM
549141,IaDave,2005-06-13 11:20:00,476,I would check out Albany River Outfitters. I know they have a 2 person camp on Leckey Lake and it is the only cabin there. I think it is nothing fancy but the lake had been closed to fishing until about 5 yrs ago so I bet the fishing is great. I have used this outfitter quite a bit and he is very reasonable. See the posting from phishfearme. They have a website albanyriver.ca.
549147,Gary_IA,2005-06-13 12:39:00,144,www.slatefallsoutposts.com supposedly will make arrangements for two. Be sure to read their trip planner. It is humorous and informative. I understand that Uchi Lake is a short plane flight without much in the way of weight restrictions. It is both housekeeping and American Plan lodge. I think you just as well go American Plan if you are flying into a lodge. For a slight increase in costs you can avoid cooking. My uncle has gone to this resort and likes it. I know they have a website. Good luck
549178,Guest,2005-06-13 19:36:00,0,"Kashabowie is a good place to go. Been with them before and they will take 2,3,4 people. http://www.kashabowieoutposts.com/"
549184,Hammerhead Herb,2005-06-13 20:07:00,259,"That is a fantastic gift to give your son. Both of my sons graduated in the early 90's and I gave them each a trip for HS graduation (91 and 94). They have come back with me many times since then. We use Showalter's just north of Ear Falls. They have about 8 lakes to go to. With just 2 people, you may find that you'll be more succesfull getting a booking in the later part of the season. You can find Showalter's at http://www.fishshowalters.com/ Our group has been using them since the mid 80's."
549186,Guest,2005-06-13 20:15:00,0,"I know you are looking for a fly in but have you thought of a boat in lodge. The lodge where I have gone is a 22 mile boat in trip with rustic cabins, with no electricity ,outhouses but there is warm showers. It is called wine lake camp and this is the website www.winelakecamp.com"
