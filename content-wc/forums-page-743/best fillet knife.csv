The first time I used it, I was walking back to the camper (about 300 yards) and noticed in the bucket I was carrying there was a bunch of blood. I had cut myself (not even a very big cut--on the back of my finger-- but it bled a long time) and didn't even know it!! VERY SHARP and I am told it will stay that way too...that was my goal. I am also not going to use it for cutting through the scales/bones...only meat cutting/filleting. It should last me many years that way."

I get mine sharpened 1 time per year at the sports show in the Twin Cities. Cost is $1 at the Leech Lake Knife booth. Good stuff! Scott"
550215,rebelrn2001,2005-07-08 18:07:00,1563,I know about the back side but it really doesnt seem overly sharp. There is certainly a difference in 'sharpness' between the two. My 'old' knife still is kind of sharp so I've been using that.
550361,Wables,2005-07-14 21:13:00,125,I have an Easley custom and it has been amazing! I have had it for 3 years and clean over 100 salmon and walleys per year with it. I have never touched the edge.
