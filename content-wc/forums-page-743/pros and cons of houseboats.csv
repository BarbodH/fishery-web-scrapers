550306,IaDave,2005-07-13 09:27:00,476,Our group is considering a houseboat trip on Lac Seul next year. We have been doing fly-ins the last couple of years so I don't the think cost will be a problem but what are some of the pros & cons for you guys that have been on a trip like that? Also- any experiences with the 2 places out of Hudson that do it- good or bad.

We always had a great time with the houseboats. Some of the pros: you can get away from people, pull up very close to where you are going to fish so you cut down on travel time to and from camp, and you can re-locate if you want to do so. The down sides are you have to do everything yourself like cleaning, cooking, etc. (not a big problem for most of us), and usually they don't have very good fishing boats/equipment for rent. Now for a few comments/suggestions: The boats that run everything on electric power are more convenient than those that run on propane -- everything from charging trolling motor batteries to playing your CDs. Make sure the outfitter will bring additional supplies out to you if you need them -- such as more fuel for the houseboat and/or the fishing boats, or more booze. See if the outfitter will drive the houseboat out to a spot for you ahead of time so all you have to do is get there by fishing boat. That might save you the better part of a day both ways, which means more time fishing. Just like picking a tent size, get one that is ""designed"" for more guys than are in your group. If you have 6 guys, get one that sleeps 8 people or more. The more room the better. As I said, we loved our houseboat trips, and might do more in the future. HOwever, we found a camp that has great rental boats and equipment, service, food, etc., so it's hard to go back to doing everything for ourselve. Good luck."
