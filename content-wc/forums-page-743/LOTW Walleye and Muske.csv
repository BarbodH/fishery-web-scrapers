550232,Guest,2005-07-09 23:58:00,0,Anyone have any words of wisdom for Walleye and Muskie in Lake of the Woods this time of year? Heading up there this week..
550242,rockpt,2005-07-10 22:48:00,589,"Walleye should be on the deep water reefs, in 18'-35'. Jig with minnows or leeches, or bottom bounce. Muskies should be on rocks near deep water, saddles, and points. Bucktails, spinnerbaits, jerkbaits and topwater. Find what they like. Me - I'm off to the Florida Keys tomorrow for some flats fishing for tarpon, bonefish and permit. Will be up to LOTW in three weeks. Let us know how you do."
550280,Guest,2005-07-12 11:58:00,0,Just wondering if anyone is noticing any difference in the fishery because of the netting that has been going on for the last two years. Do you think the fishing quality is about the same or as it began to slide? Is anyone seen a lot of nets out there? Just curious to know the effects. Has there been any movement towards resolution of the issue?
550291,rpieske,2005-07-12 16:19:00,1276,"I haven't noticed any difference this year due to netting. I haven't noticed any more nets than usual. Muskie fishing is doing pretty well this past week with many fish being taken. Ski's are on the rocks, points and saddles with wind or current. Hot lure for us has been the #5 Mepps, silver blade and red tail with split grub. Also, twitch baits with lots of flash. Water in Sabaskong is unusually clear for this time of year due to the high amount of water coming into the lake. With weeds, it's feast or famine. Some areas great and others non-existent. Water is high, temps were 75.6 today. Beautiful resort weather."

I'll email you and maybe we can get a half day on the water together this year. Didn't see any activity around the cabin back in June when we were up. I'll look for your red cap on the water or stop by for a cup of coffee. Tight lines, Brad - Omaha"
