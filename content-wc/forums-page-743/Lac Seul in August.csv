550279,Jimbobwee,2005-07-12 11:27:00,9,Heading up to Mahkwa last week in August. Little nervous about the fishing and was hoping all you experts out there could put my mind at ease. Any helpful tips or experiences in this time frame? Thanks much.

Last Aug, I ended one day using any piece of plastic I could find after I ran out of minnows and leeches. If you are that unsure, hire a guide. Best investment you will ever make..guranteed!"
