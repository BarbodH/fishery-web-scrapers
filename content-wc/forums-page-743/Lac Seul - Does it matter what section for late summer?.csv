I hope the availability is better during this time. Does it matter what section of the lake we book for this time of year. I'd hate to get up there and find out the fish migrate during the summer ( Lake Erie ). Thanks again, JS"
550254,Guest,2005-07-11 15:32:00,0,"No, there are fish all over the place all year. If it's late July, you could find fish from 4 feet to 45 feet, but for the most part will probably fish around 15-30 feet. I prefer the southwest-central section of the lake, because it sees relatively little pressure, much less boat traffic. NWO Fishing Bum"
550255,Guest,2005-07-11 16:03:00,0,NW corner in 4 - 15 ft of water much less travel time to fish. Very consistant time of the year. It truly is a personal preference.
550257,Guest,2005-07-11 17:12:00,0,Would recommend further down the lake ie... Scout lake/Lac Suel Lodge/Silver Wheel areas. Less pressure and the QUALITY of fish are better.
