549665,WIPP,2005-06-23 09:09:00,75,Gary: Search recent threads for them - Ojibway outfitters. Should be quite a bit of info. Been there 4 times. We will be there July 9-13.
549783,Guest,2005-06-27 09:17:00,0,Been there three times. Fishing was always great. They will give you a map with some good spots on it and you should do great.
549831,Guest,2005-06-28 07:17:00,0,Have always done well catching fish there. They are a great help when it comes to putting you on fish....I guess that is because the fish are everyplace. It is very likely that each person in your party can catch 75 to 100 Walleye. You will also have a Pike come up and try to eat a Walleye or two off your jig...maybe even a Muskie.
