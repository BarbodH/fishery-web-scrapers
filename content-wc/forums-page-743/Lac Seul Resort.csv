550224,Guest,2005-07-09 10:48:00,0,"Pete, if you're staying at Timberlane Lodge, is the area hit hard by other fishermen? From what others have said it seems like Lac Seul has a lot of fishing pressure and I would think that a resort close to Ear Falls would have LOTS of boat traffic. Please correct me if I'm wrong, so that nobody gets the wrong impression if they are considering Timberlane Lodge in their vacation plans."
550227,Guest,2005-07-09 16:22:00,0,"On our spring trip you can see a bunch of boats. It's nothing like state-side, there are tons of great fishing spots so you don't have to fish around anyone else. The fall trip is mid-September and it isn't very busy at all. I've fished both sides, my personal favorite is the NW part of the lake. I drive pavement the whole way and pull right up to my cabin. I'm close enough to drive into town for supplies and far enough out to relax. I do miss the Muskie fishing on the east side though, it's great!! If you haven't tried LS, you must! It may not be for everyone, but you won't know until you've tried it."

Thanks for the info Pete, I'm set up for next year but will look into it the following year. How is the road from Dryden on? Mahkwa has about 28 miles of dirt road to there launch area, took out my side lights on the boat trailer this year. I believe Lac Seul Resort is close to Hudson and the Resort is land locked, so that will eliminate hauling all the supplies in by boat. Ron"
550231,Guest,2005-07-09 21:48:00,0,Dryden to V.Bay and north to Ear Falls. All pavement!! I love it because I bring my own boat.
550238,Guest,2005-07-10 18:49:00,0,"EEewww! No dish soap.....you poor darling, how did you cope with such adversity?!"
550239,Guest,2005-07-10 20:24:00,0,">EEewww! No dish soap.....you poor darling, how did you cope >with such adversity?! I would rather have my family eat off dishes that are washed with soap, especially not knowing who ate off of them last. Sounds like Mahkwa would be a perfect place for you. Ron"
550259,Guest,2005-07-11 18:07:00,0,"No offence intended Ron but I think if you want to get on a site like this and make negative comments based on your experience then at least be fair. No dish soap and lack of an extra roll of toilet paper..??....come on, I am sure if you had asked for the above items you probably would have received them. Sounds like others who have been there enjoyed the stay........perhaps it was just time for you to move on. And yes, it probably would be a place I would enjoy staying at.....seems like a nice relaxing atmosphere where most of the guests (excluding some who must whine) can cope with the harsh reality of no dish soap.

550263,Guest,2005-07-11 20:49:00,0,"You may want to check out Goldpines camp at the end of Hwy 657 out of Ear Falls. The owners know how to run a camp. The only problem you may have is finding an opening. There is a waiting list for return customers. We couldn't make it this year for other reasons, but I believe we lost our cabin for a specific week. Most of our fishing was done in less than 10 miles from camp. There is a playground set and sand beach for the kids. Have fun, catch fish."

I have relatives that have stayed at this lodge for many years, some still go there and others don't. Things can go great for them one year and then fall apart the next. My understanding is that they are alot better than they used to be. I wish them my best and hope that things run smooth for them. There were many empty cabins when I was there this year, that speaks for itself. Ron"
550187,Guest,2005-07-07 21:25:00,0,We will be going to Lac Seul Resort next year for the first time and would appreciate any info on the Resort and the area for fishing. Have been going to Mahkwa but am fed up with the poor management and want to try a new area. Are there any Walleye spawning areas coming into Lost Lake? Would be interested in areas with 5 to 9' with grass or weeds near these areas. How many miles do you usually have to travel from the Resort for decent fishing? Am taking Grandchildren next year and would like to show them a good time and hopefully see them catch some fish. Ron
550188,Guest,2005-07-07 22:28:00,0,"LS is a great choice but you are looking for a great deal here. Depending on the ages of your grandchildren you will want to stay at a place that cater to those ages. LS is very large and depending on where you stay depends on where you will fish. The Ear Falls resorts offer what you are looking for. Evergreen Lodge, Lac Seul Lodge, Fishermans Cove are all places that are very well run and cater to the family. Most of the others are strictly fishing lodges that cater to the fisherman and do not have the amenities that a family might be looking for. Book later in July or Aug. the weather is settled and the fish are on summer patterns."
550191,RB,2005-07-08 06:27:00,32,"rmack, I'm going to Mahkwa for the first time in a couple weeks. What kind of managment problems did you run into? Any tips for that area for that time of year, not exact spots just trends and depths. Thanks RB"
550193,Guest,2005-07-08 07:31:00,0,I will be going to mahkwa as well the first week of August for the first time. You have my attention now?? Any helpful hints on dealing with the fish and/or owners would be great...
550196,Guest,2005-07-08 07:55:00,0,I think Evergreen offers a family package rate in July and August. It's a fishing camp. No pool or swim beach or playground
550198,mwal,2005-07-08 08:36:00,151,Just Returned from Mahkwa last nite. We had good trip and caught lots of slot fish 19 20 inchers. Located fish with bottom bouncers then jigged with crawler piece or salted or live minnow. A jig with power minnow or gulp twister in white was very effective also. The fish were in the depth range of 15 to 23 ft on windward side of structure. Vaughn lake was also good. Mahkwa is run by the First Nation and they can be a little relaxed. They have made improvements on the service they had good supply of minnows at a resonable price they also had a small store with some snacks etc. We stay on the american plan and the meals were good and the cabins were cleaned daily. Our friends stay on the housekeeping side and the cabin was old and rustic but it worked. We rebooked again for the same time next year. I have been up there 4 times and wouldn't hesatate to go again. Mwal
550208,Guest,2005-07-08 10:58:00,0,"I was up to mahkwa 2 weeks ago and am going back next week. I have been there since the early days. They are more relaxed but the fishing is great! I have always stayed in housekeeping and the cabins are clean with hot water,shower, refrig, electric stoves,pots pans ,bunk beds . you need to bring your bedding(sleeping bag). If you like to fish and can enjoy the outdoors , Mahkwa is great. Percy and Roger are easy to get along with if you can smile and be friendly. Remember this is vacation and not work."
550209,Guest,2005-07-08 11:15:00,0,"I didn't want this to be a post about Mahkwa, but will address some of the problems. They have a problem with booking cabins to more than one party at a time, I would recommend calling just before you go to make sure they have you booked properly. I know of one group got all the way up there and there cabin was rented to someone else, they had us booked wrong but there was empty cabins so it worked out okay. Our cabin had no dish soap, and one roll of toilet paper for 4 adults for 2 day's. We brought extras with us so this was just an irritant. The fishing was good so I hate to leave the area, I hope they straighten there problems out as I would like to fish that area again in the future. Ron"

550219,Guest,2005-07-08 20:13:00,0,Messed up on the last message! I have and do stay at Timberlane Lodge just east of Ear Falls. They have a Family package which includes a upgraded boat for a very reasonable price. They run a top notch facility and are upgrading every year. You'd have great fishing and very good people taking care of you!
