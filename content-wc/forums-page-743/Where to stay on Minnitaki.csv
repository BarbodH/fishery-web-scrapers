550138,IaDave,2005-07-06 15:38:00,476,Does Timber Edge Camp have a web site?

550142,MN_Moose,2005-07-06 16:56:00,965,I found this for Timber Edge. http://virtualnorth.com/timberedge/locations.html I haven't stayed there. Don't even know where it is. How do you get from Butterfly Lake to Minnitaki?
550148,BuckeyeWilly,2005-07-06 20:43:00,41,My wife and I stayed at a cabin on an island in the middle of Minnitaki a few years back. Patricia Fly-in Outposts ran the camp. It was a very nice cabin complete with generator. Great trip and lots of walleyes where the English River (only about 15 minutes from the cabin) comes into the lake. http://www.patflyin.info/minnitaki.html

How do >you get from Butterfly Lake to Minnitaki? Timber Edge is just off Rt. 72. You can drive straight into the camp and from there into Sioux Lookout or Dryden. The road entrance is right across from the provinical pary, I think it is called Ojibway PP. There is a small stream that runs from Butterfly Lake into Lyons Bay, the northwest part of Minnitaki. It takes us about 20 minutes to get from Timber Edge to the main basin of Minnitaki, in the vicinity of Burnthut Island."
550213,Guest,2005-07-08 15:10:00,0,I have stayed at Donnelly's 5 times and once at Nortern Sunrise outfitters. Donnellys is right off the highway and northern sunrise you stay on a Island that is a couple minutes from the Rice river and 10 min from the english. Many people prefer to be very close to the English river. I like both lodges and had similiar results on catching fish on either side of the lake. Donnellys is closer to Redpine bay sanctuary and the lodge is located on Pickeral arm which is also very good fishing. Northern Sunrise is the more rustic of the two Camps by far. The power for the cabins comes from solar or propane.
550222,Guest,2005-07-09 06:42:00,0,"Before we got our place in Sioux Lookout we stayed at Donnallys and also at Patricia Fly in camps which is now Northumbriam. Dan Baas who runs it has a cabin for rent on minnataki about 1/2 to the english river that was nice and pretty big. if you want something closer to sioux lookout, you can try mooshorn. i have rent our cabin to a few folks over the years and occassionally they need boats to use that i dont keep at my place. i have sent them to moosehorn and the people there have taken great care of them. it is a real good area for canadian exposure and good fishing. Good luck"
