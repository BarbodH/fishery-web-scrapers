We have NEVER had a bad, or even average experience with this outfitter! Verne is very professional and runs a great organization. We have always flown into Lake St. Joseph, which I would highly recommend, but I have heard from others that all of his outpost lakes are top shelf. I would strongly encourage you to go with Slate Falls...you will see them cheaper, but not better! If you want more info, reply on this post and I can send you my email address."
550380,DaveIN,2005-07-15 12:52:00,191,I have been to Maskara twice. We were very satisfied with the service and equipment. Verne runs a good operation. We stayed in his bunkhouse at Red Pine lodge the night before we flew out. Much cheaper than the local motels. Bunkhouse is brand new as of 5 years ago. Friend that put us onto Verne has been going to Red Pine Lodge for 20 years. Maskara is a small lake but you will be the only ones on the lake. Lots and lots of 16 to 21 inch walleye. Biggest northern was 36 inch. Cabin is ok and my wife got a big kick out of the shower being on the porch. There is a very large hump in middle of the far end of the lake that is always loaded with walleye. One morning I caught 90 walleye in 90 minutes using plastic grub. My hand ached for two days. I will be leaving for Canada one week from today. I don't do fly-ins after I bought new boat and camper. Could not stand to leave them at home.
