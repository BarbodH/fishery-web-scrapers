Although we only caught about 25% of the walleyes we usually get due to the mayfly hatch we had the best year for big fish. Lakers were hot as well. Compared to other years it seems like there is a much higher level of inspection both at the border and on the lakes. When entering at Pigeon River we have always claimed our crawlers but have never been checked. This year they pulled every truck over that had crawlers. The gentleman inspecting ours spent close to five minutes digging in our flat but we were clean. Others were not as lucky. The first day on the lake there was a warden out flagging boats over in the middle of a thunderstorm to check fish counts and licenses. Later that week they came into camp, checked the fish registry and then went through all the cabin freezers. Guess we didn't mind as we go up to have a good time and not bend ther rules. My only point in sharing this is for anyone who has thought of cutting some corners, you may want to follow the laws. Safe travels"
