550301,Norseman,2005-07-13 04:21:00,24,Anybody know the best way and/or where to get Lake Trout in Whitefish bay on LOTW? Going to be in the area at the end of July and would like to have some info on how to get them. Any information would be great. Thanks
550329,fishinnut,2005-07-13 22:50:00,642,Downriggers would be a great help. I have fished for L. Trout in Whitefiush and caught a few. Blue rapalas worked well. We also used 8 oz. snap weights to get our lures to the bottom. Fish the 100-120 ft holes and you should find them. Also early and late in the day unless there is a lot of cloud cover. Jigging with buss bombs and Bomber slab spoons should work too.
550330,Norseman,2005-07-13 23:37:00,24,Thanks! We usually fish Crow lake in Nestor Falls for the Lakers but were thinking of trying something new this year. Buzz bombs work well for us in Crow so it is nice to know that I won't have to buy a bunch of extra tackle for them on Whitefish.

We used both buzz bombs and trolled spoons using clip-on weights and caught some pretty nice fish. Not lots of numbers but good size. We would motor around looking for the big schools of bait fish on the depth finder and then drop the lures right down through the schools."

It looks on the map like whitefish bay is a big area, are you specifically talking about that deep water area southwest of sioux narrows that goes down to 200 feet? thanks alan"
