Passport works the best and if you intend to bring your kids without both spouses being there, you need a notorized letter from the other spouse that it is ok for your child to leave the country."
550205,Gary_IA,2005-07-08 10:05:00,144,"They can ask for proof of citizenship and driver's license doesn't show that. To be safe bring a certified copy of birth certificate and driver's license. For children: certified copy of birth certificate and photo id if one is available (many schools have this). Traditionally many people have been able to go through on driver's license but you can be required to prove citizenship. On the Just Fish Ontario Board, Wanda Pitcher has posted an Email from NOTO (Northern Ontario Tourism Organization-I think) that indicates proof of citizenship has always been the law and that the authorities are more likely to enforce it now."
550246,walley250,2005-07-11 07:54:00,161,I am 21 and I might possibly be bringing my brother over the border this fall. He is 17. What would be the best preparations to make it over the border smoothly.
550247,Guest,2005-07-11 08:06:00,0,"Just off the top of my head, I'd say have him come with his drivers license, birth certificate and then a signed and notarized permission letter from both parents...."
550256,MoWalleyeguy,2005-07-11 16:04:00,409,"Just went through the Internatinal Falls/Fort Frances crossing last Sunday morning. They were checking very closely. 4 of us in vehicle including one 12 year old. We had all paper work, including notorized letter for the kid and they had us pull over and walk inside to check it all out. They wanted to see all of our I.D. etc and ask questions... not much of a hassle but that was the first time in 7 trips north for me. They did give a couple of other guys some big time hassling because there info and reasons for going through didnt add up and really sounded ""fishy"". We did see them turn back one younger gu too but we don't know the reason. Bottom line... have your I.D., birth certificate, Passports if you have one and any notorized paper work and don't goof around. They are cracking down and they are very serious about there job. Coming back through was a matter of LOTS of questions but within 5 minutes were on our way. Again, more intense then past years."
