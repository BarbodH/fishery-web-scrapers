550230,Inconnu,2005-07-09 19:46:00,21,Is there a site that explains the requirements for a tournament legal livewell? I was looking at a Princecraft with a 17gallon livewell. Thankyou!
550265,Guest,2005-07-11 20:53:00,0,It's probably best to post this on the Boats and Motors section or even the General section.
550268,Inconnu,2005-07-12 04:38:00,21,Thanks! I was going to remove the post but apparently can't. I bought a different boat yesterday so the question is no longer relevant. Thanks though....Kerry
550287,Guest,2005-07-12 14:31:00,0,"The issues is not the size of the livewell, its the condition of the fish at weight in. If you can keep them alive and healthy in a quart jar, great. You get docked points for dead fish. The question you need to ask yourself is how should I out fit my live well to give me the competative edge. If size is an issue, you will have to answer that one for yourself according to the amount of risk you want to run"
550288,Reels,2005-07-12 14:47:00,2876,Larger tourneys you have to show your livewell running durring boat check. <{{}}><
550292,Guest,2005-07-12 16:29:00,0,"Thanks guys! I kill very few fish through the year. Mostly I catch and release, which may sound passe here because of the regs, but I am from B.C. where we could keep walleye etc. I did keep a few, but my prime concern for those I released was their well being. I have been doing alot of reading on this site and others, regarding the health of fish in livewells. You are all giving me alot to work with and I thank you for that....Kerry"
