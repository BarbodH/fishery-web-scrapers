550264,Guest,2005-07-11 20:51:00,0,Just about any bare hook will do. You'll have fun.
550271,Guest,2005-07-12 06:48:00,0,"I like to bottom bounce with a minnow or leach until I find a large concentration of fish, and then I go with a 1/4 jig or bigger with a minnow or leach. I do not fish much with crawlers because small fish seem to pull them off the hook. I do hear from neighboring cabins that they love to fish with crawlers, and some use salted minnows, so it is your own preference. Just about any peice of meat on the end of a hook will produce."
