6356558,JJLundo,2019-09-07 12:26:00,8,I've been to both with Northern Outposts several years ago. I believe both camps have been closed for a few years now. Is a different outfitter going to reopen them?

Its in that same area as the others mentioned on this thread. Anyway whoever I spoke with claimed that Shouldice was a top notch trophy pike lake, I remember asking them to specify what they meant in terms of size and they said 40"" which I would agree is a trophy pike. Curious if anyone has ever fished that body of water?"
