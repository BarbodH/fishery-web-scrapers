6354822,Shotgun,2019-09-01 07:55:00,759,"My hands get numerous small cuts on a long fishing trip. Leaving Friday for Lac Seul and I keep a bottle of new skin in my suit case and boat first aid kit. Seals up minor cuts great and is somewhat water resistant/proof. You can buy it under several different names/brands, i.e., Walgreens, Walmart, etc..https://www.newskinproducts.com/"
6355796,Rock Hound,2019-09-04 15:25:00,51,"I have had the same reaction with the skin on my hands getting hard, drying out, and then peeling. It will take about a month for the skin on my hands to peel after a fishing trip. I have had this issue after a week long fishing trip for almost 30 years. It has to be some sort of allergic reaction, or the fish slime dries out my skin and I get a reaction, not sure, BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING. I also get a mild case of it fishing locally if I put a ton of fish in the boat, even in just one day. I have had great success the last couple years with less peeling (almost none) with regular washing of my hands while on the fishing trip and more importantly, using Udder Cream daily on the trip. I had tried regular skin lotion, and that didn't work, but Udder Cream (and Working Hands) balm has worked very well for me . . . try it."

6358552,NM_Trout,2019-09-15 15:48:00,1094,"Yeah, my hands get torn up on a regular basis too. I hate the skin cracks that hurt like ****. When I know I am going to be in the thick of it, I always keep some cheap harbor freight nitrile gloves and I put them on right before bed. It is a little uncomfortable, but keeping the moisture in really helps the healing process."
6359854,Mojo-NC,2019-09-20 10:49:00,1929,"Right before our trip last week we purchased a couple of Rapala Performance Tool Combo sets - one set for each boat. The grips were worth their weight in gold (and they float too). The braid scissors cut braided line like no other braid scissors I've ever used. Needle nose pliers are a requirement for all of my fishing trips. These are somewhat unique because they also have a belt holster. The combination of these tools reduced the amount if time we had to handle fish with our hands and the cuts and scrapes I did get are almost all healed already when we just left the lake on Monday. Most of my hand injuries occurred while getting measurements on fish. Apparently, they do not much like being laid down on the boat seats for measurements. A great investment for all Canada trips in my opinion. The grips were pretty torn up by the end of our 9 day trip, but once you've got 'em, they don't get away until you're ready to release them.https://www.rapala.com/rapala/fishin...t=true&start=5"

6353932,Obabikon,2019-08-28 15:13:00,2370,"This isn't uncommon. Fish slime dries out your skin, and then accompany that with all the abuse that your hands take in a week. In and out of the water, running the tiller, hook pokes, line cuts... etc. It is just a healing mechanism. Most likely, it isn't even an allergy. You just beat the crap out of your hands last week."
6353984,DaBirdman,2019-08-28 19:06:00,164,"I catch plenty of fish each year, and a wide variety. I get the same thing as the original poster. Skin on my finger tips gets hard, then starts to wear and peel. For me, it goes on for a good month. But for me, my fingers crack and split a lot as well. Can be painful at times, especially since I use my hands a lot at work. Don't know what it is though. Reaction to fish slime in combination with bait slime? No idea. I also get this condition throughout much of the winter months, so maybe handling all the fish and bait draws out the moisture in my fingers? It sucks, especially during the winter. But getting it after a Canada trip... it's well worth the discomfort!"
6354270,Obabikon,2019-08-29 20:41:00,2370,"For the record... cornhusker lotion works great to prevent this. Take better care of your hands, you only have two of them! https://www.google.com/search?ei=WYt...4dUDCAo&uact=5"
6354512,oldlund,2019-08-30 19:13:00,209,Just walked in the door from a week in Canada. Was looking at my torn up hands that sting in 20 places when I wash my hands and wondering how the heck the guides do that every day. Tough work!Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
6354578,Mojo-NC,2019-08-31 06:20:00,1929,"I took your advice and ordered a bottle. We're heading up to Canada for 10 days next Friday. I figure 50'ish fish per day equals a lot of sticks, cuts, scrapes, etc. I might even wear a glove sometimes. Any help is appreciated."
6353210,jigfisher9,2019-08-26 12:56:00,23,"Wondering if anyone else has had a problem with their fingers peeling days after a fishing trip? For the last 10+ years when I get back from a week in Canada, my skin on my fingers gets tight and soon after starts to peel. It takes a few layers of skin off but not to the point of being sore or bleeding. Started putting Aquafor on and it helps smooth the skin out and heal pretty quickly.Is it the slime on pike/walleye? Is it that my hands are wet/dry/wet/dry for 8 hours a day for a week?Is it a bacteria that causes this, kind of like athletes foot.I hoping its pike slime.... if middle aged women will pay thousands of dollars for chemical peels on their face. For half price and I will smear pike slime on your face."
6353304,Ltrain,2019-08-26 17:36:00,4145,"My sister gets like that but a little worse, she has started wearing latex gloves. Believes it to be an allergic reaction, she had alot of allergies growing up"
6353346,HeHooksHimself,2019-08-26 20:39:00,725,"this also happens to me but I always attribute it to a week of wet hands, never really considered the slime to have anything to do with it. Maybe I am just a ***** Fish On! Hooks"
6353370,dschiebel,2019-08-27 00:44:00,85,"1 st you need a 1 gt of windsor, take a big gulp, next mix 1 pt windsor with 4 cut up night crawlers. When thoroughly mixed rub all over your hands and let sit for 17 minutes this is very important. While this is happening, drink the other pt of windson while screaming I am not a p-----, continue screaming until the windsor is empty, then this is important, run up to the loud mouth that gave you the worse time and rub your hands in his hair.Works 100% every time, your hands will be like a baby's butt in the morning."

6353432,jackpotjohnny48,2019-08-27 07:14:00,153,"I wouldn't necessarily use the word ""peeling"" to describe my hands. When I think of peeling skin, I tend to think of what happens after a sunburn. But I would say that my hands, after just having returned from 12 days in Canada, are dry, and cracked, and generally beat up. I think it has something to do with hands constantly getting wet, then dry. And doing dishes in the sink at the outpost cabin. And getting cut on the fishing line when trying to get line untangled from a tree branch, while using bare hands on 15 lb superbraid. Or getting cut when holding a fish under the gill plates for a fish pic. I think all of those things take a toll, and although I've been back for 10 days now, my hands aren't yet 100% healed. I think 2 or 3 more days of Jergens Ultimate healing lotion should get me back to normal. But I've noticed that every time I take a trip to Canada, I come back home with dry, cracked, beat up hands. (But I don't think fish slime is a contributing factor. I think the other things mentioned above have a lot more to do with it)."
6353450,Esoxmike,2019-08-27 07:49:00,114,"Sounds like u r not catching enough fish back home the rest of year to condition your hands,it's something I've never had to deal with,lol."
6353464,Mojo-NC,2019-08-27 08:46:00,1929,"Everyone I know comes back after a week of fishing in Canada with torn up swollen hands from getting stuck with fins and hooks, cut by gill plates, and whatever. I don't ever recall my hands peeling but it does take a couple of weeks to get back to normal. It's a good problem to have after catching a boatload of fish over the course of the week."
6353608,Ricky Spanish,2019-08-27 15:30:00,1298,"I bet it is some type of allergic reaction, especially if it's an all over peeling. I drive a keyboard for a living so my hands are not very seasoned, despite fishing at least a few days every month, year round. I have found O'Keefe's Working Hands works fast enough to keep it from getting too bad on our 7-9 day trip every June and in winter I use it a few times a week or else my knuckles crack and bleed."
