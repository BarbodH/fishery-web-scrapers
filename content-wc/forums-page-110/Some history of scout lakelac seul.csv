6357152,Goat,2019-09-10 08:00:00,23,"Now scout lake resort. In 1949 my dad ,Joe Moore,built a cabin just east of what was then Durochers scout lake camp. He got the land free by homesteading and improving it. I was 5 years old. This was shortly after the dam at ear falls raised the lake level by 20 feet. The shoreline was nothing but stubs and dead trees. Lots of snags but the fishing was incredible. We could cast off of our crude dock and catch northerns about every third cast. The cabin he built is long gone but the bout house by the lake is still there. Art Durocher is a good memory as he and my dad enjoyed a few beers together. Art sold the resort to Harry and Helen yoachum from Kansa city. Very nice people. I think it was in the early 60s that Harry accidentally drowned in the lake. Hellen kept running the place, even staying there in the winter. For how long I don't know. The nearest store was dinties trading post at Perrault falls. A small store with gas pumps, groceries, and they sold blocks of ice that we used in our ice box. At that time Jan (Dutchie) lohman was one of the guides at the camp. Good memories. He has since become a local business man and community leader in ear falls. I remember the guides coming in just as it got dark in the 16' cedar strip boats with 25 hp Johnson outboards. Never nothing under 20 pound northerns and several good walleyes. Back then it was a gravel road from vermillion bay all the way to red lake. 50 miles from vermillion bay to scout lake camp. I am 75 now and wondering if anyone else remembers those times."
6357176,Weby13,2019-09-10 08:43:00,57,"My dad who is now 82 started fishing scout Lake Camp in 1970. He tells stories of how great of people Helen and Harry were. In his recollection he remembers a boat getting loose off the dock and Harry going out in another boat to get the loose boat. He said he supposedly had a foot in each boat and slipped hit his head and drowned. My dad was the younger guy out of a group of 10. All the older guys were world war 2 vets and all were tradesmen. My father said Helen would need work done throughout the camp and my dad and a couple other guys would not fish a day or 2 and take care of helens to do list because they knew Harry wasn’t around. Helen would take care of part or all of the trip for the couple guys that did work. They refused but Helen insisted. Helens house still stands about a half mile behind the main lodge at Scout lake. I had the privilege to fish with all the older guys when I was 18 for 2 years and then they started to have heath issues or pass away. The photos my dad has of Northerns and walleye from the 60’s and 70’s are unbelievable! Huge huge fish! He told me about the wooden boats and they would bring their own 15 HP engines. He said a Broad lake trip would be a solid 2 to 2.5 hours depending on waves but it was well with it. We stayed with Roland, Sara and Lizzie Shriner for years. We created a new group with friends and family and then moved onto Onaway Lodge. We now have a group of 15 with 6 of them being my dads grandkids. Next year will be my 26th year up there and God willing my Dads 50th year. My dads health has been deteriorating for the past couple years and we have been dragging him along but just last week we found out my dad was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer. Hopefully we can get my dad up for the big 50! Thanks for sharing your story! It brings back a lot of great memories and stories my dad has shared with me since I was a little boy and now he’s sharing with his grandchildren."
6357206,Goat,2019-09-10 10:35:00,23,"Your dad has good memories for sure. I remember when harry drowned. Helen continued to run the camp even staying there through the winter. Shortly after that she had a hired man that helped her run the camp. I don't remember his name but I think he was from Kansas City. Same area Helen and Harry were from. My dad sold our cabin to Helen in the 1960s. The camp had a generator for electricity but only in the evening. They had a log built ice house down by the lake. All the ice blocks covered with sawdust to insulate them. The ice lasted all summer. We had no electricity but used a mantle lantern that hung over the table in our small cabin. My dad built 4 plywood boats in the years we were there. They were great fun for my 2 brothers and me. He bought a new 33 hp Scott Atwater with bail a matic a few years before he sold the place. I think it was the fastest boat on the lake at that time being on a light plywood and pine boat. We also had a 3 horse evinrude, an old 5 horse Johnson, a 7 horse Martin, a 16 horse Elgin, and my favorite 15 horse evinrude. There was another cabin just east of us owned by Phil burbich, a grain belt beer distributor from Minnesota . He liked to hunt wolves from an airplane and hunt black bears. He was up there with a friend and they died in their cabin. RCMP thought it was from food poisoning. His cabin is still there. You can see a pretty good view of the area showing buildings and docks using google earth."
6357240,Weby13,2019-09-10 12:21:00,57,Great memories. I'm visiting with with my dad now. He said he remembers a native guide named Percy who helped Helen a bunch. He guided for my dads crew in early years. Percy has a son named Eddie who guided my first trip in 1994. We were told during the winter about 15 years ago Eddies car broke down and went to get gas. I guess the gas tank had a leak and leaked all over his leg and he got hypothermia and lost one of his legs. He lived in a house 100 yards from Onaway Lodge. The man could catch walleyes 10 to our 1. A pole in each hand back trolling using his knee to work the tiller in 2 foot waves.
6357250,Goat,2019-09-10 12:50:00,23,I remember Percy. He was also one of the guides when it was Durochers scout lake camp. Very smart and helpful. He let our family use his trappers cabin on our excursion to broad and sunlight lakes for an overnight stay. The cabin was back from the narrow river that led to broad and sunlight. It was kind of a dugout with 3 foot walls and about a 5 foot ceiling. Like many natives at that time he would trap and hunt during the long cold winters.

You can typically find used copies on Amazon. That whole area has a rich history that I think most who fish up there would love learn about. Thanks for sharing your stories."
6357258,stumcfar,2019-09-10 12:58:00,451,Are there any pictures from around that area before the dam rose the lake level?
6357272,Goat,2019-09-10 13:37:00,23,I have found a few of the Hudson's bay store on the shore at gold pines before the dam. Not much else.
6359114,Aspencreek,2019-09-17 15:29:00,2911,"It has been quite a few years now, but Kathy at Onaway Lodge would visit Percy at the nursing home in Red Lake. Percy was our first guide out of Onaway in 2001. Not much of a conversationalist but he could find fish. But at the shorelunch he answered some pointed questions that I had and let me in on what he said was his biggest secret......""you gotta think like a fish..eh"". Over the next few years after that we would see Percy take out other groups or head out early to some other camp. His house is still there, at least last time I was there, I had heard some of his nephews or other relation had taken up residence. Maybe some one else knows more of the story."
