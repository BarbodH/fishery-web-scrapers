I was hoping to head there (on the Canadian side) on our Thanksgiving weekend. I'm trying to follow the water temps, but was wondering if that is too early or not? Also, do the shiners and big Walleye make it up as far as Barwick and Manitou Rapids or do I need to go further west? Thanks for any help."
