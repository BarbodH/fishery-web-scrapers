I have some questions for you folks.... 1) How is mid to late August in terms of possibility of rain? Does it dry out then? I've been on 5 trips to this area from late May through early July, and 4 of them we had lots and lots of rain. Only one trip was mostly dry. It makes for a long week at an outpost when you are fishing under gray skies and hauling butt back to the cabin getting chased by a storm. I'm trying to find a time which I'd have better odds of having good weather. One trip I was up there with one of my kids and it rained every day, all day, except for the very last day when we had 4 hours of clear sky at sunset. 2) We have started doing a lot of fly fishing for pike. However, mid June the bigger pike are already headed to deeper waters. When do the lakes up there start to cool off a bit? We like fishing the shallows with streamers as even with weighted streamers and sink tip line the streamer comes up too easy when stripped in. Thank you for any guidance! Trout"

A few storms might roll through during the week, but most days are very nice. Cool nights, no bugs, stable fish patterns .... makes me wonder why anyone would ever fish early season. Whether or not the pike have come shallow all depends on the lake and the water temps. There will ALWAYS be shallow pike in weeds, but maybe not the size you want. Although there are definitely lakes where the big pike stay in weed beds all year long. This year we fished the first week of September. We caught big pike in 30' of water, and also in 2'. Go figure."

The number of days with rain follows the same pattern. The difference isn't really that big though.I think you have just been unlucky. It's not like it rains all month long in July. Luckily, I don't recall ever having rain every day on any trip....strong winds (which is worse if you ask me) is another thing though. In my experience July/Aug rain tends to consist of short storms with heavy rain, while May/June/Sept seem to have more overcast light drizzle days. My May and Sept trips did have some miserable cold wet days, but also many warm and sunny ones. You just cannot predict.If you want to fish shallow trophy pike, you generally have to focus on Springtime. When we fish end of May and early June (at or within a few weeks of ice out)we catch plenty of trophy pike in 1-2 feet of water and focus on water <6 feet. All depends on water temp though. As mentioned, smaller pike will always be in or near shallow weeds at most times of the year.Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"

The weather changed from summer to fall on the day we arrived. We experienced a little bit of everything while we were there - cold, rain, wind, and finally beautiful short sleeve weather the day before we left and on our day of departure. Water temps were in the mid to high 50's all week. We caught a bazillion fish, but no monsters. The magic depth was 27' but some fish were caught deeper as the boat would get blown out to deeper water while handling other fish. Very few fish were caught shallow and the few shallow fish we did catch were caught in a bay that didn't have any deep water near by. Humps and deep points were the ticket."
