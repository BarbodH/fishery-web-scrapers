It had been closed for our next few years visits, and now I'm not even sure the building is there. I'm sure he is gone. It was pretty interesting thing to do on a terrible rainy day in Ear Falls."
6359166,Pooch,2019-09-17 20:27:00,4618,"There is a book written by Rae Kiebuzinski titled ""Yesterday The River"", A history of the Ear Falls District. A very detailed read if you are a history buff. There are a few photos, but I don't remember of what other than local buildings and settlements. I found a new copy signed by the author several years ago.Look here: https://www.amazon.com/Yesterday-riv.../dp/0919212794Pooch"
6359312,stumcfar,2019-09-18 13:13:00,451,I got that book a few years ago. Found it on Amazon. It was a great read and there were a few pics. Anyone that likes history and fishes that area would really enjoy it.
