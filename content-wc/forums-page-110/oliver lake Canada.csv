Sit on top of them and catch as many as you want jigging. Use a stinger hook. Lots of small ones mixed in and can burn through your minnow supply quickly Trolling- troll divers that will literally bounce off the rocks. You'll get a mix of pike and walleye but every walleye will be over 20 inches. You'll lose some lures The seagull's name is Pete. Mike runs a great show up there"
