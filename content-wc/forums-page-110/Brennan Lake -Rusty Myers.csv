6331294,RKG,2019-06-15 11:07:00,248,"Heading out on my first fly-in Canada trip to Brennan Lake with Rusty Myers. Anyone ever been there before? Just wondering what to expect as far as fishing goes, are there any particulars about the lake? Been to LOTW a few times, thinking it will be similar. Any fly-in secrets I should know as far as things to take that you veterans know about? Weight saving tips? Thanks in advance RKG"
6331336,kona77,2019-06-15 13:45:00,236,Have not used Rusty Myers so I can not help you on the fishing. There have been a number of threads over the years on packing tips that you can search thru the site (one from Adam Dempsey is real complete).. A lot has to do with weight limits set by the outfitter and what is included in the package.. Our outfitter supplies water and minnows and has a 100Lb limit (pretty common number). We also have our beer flown in ahead of time..One of our keys is to make sure we do not duplicate items.. Keep the fishing stuff simple and do not have guys bring up their whole tackle box.. We spend 70-80% of our time jigging so we bring up a selection of jigs and plastics. We do some trolling/drifting with warm harness/bottom bouncers/crawlers and bring some spoons and minnow type baits for gators.. Our leader packs all the food/misc paper products/oil etc.. Once again I know some outfitters have a stocked pantry with these supplies.. If you do not have bottle water you will need to either boil some everyday or get a good filtration system (that has also been covered on other threads).. We also weigh all our stuff right before the trip to make sure we are close to our weight limit goals.. Our outfitter is Ok if the total weight is a bit over the 100lb goal but it has to be within reason.. Have seen guys show up with everything but the kitchen sink.. Hope that helps

Thankfully Rusty uses the 9.9 so when, and I mean WHEN you hit a rock you should be ok, and not mess up the lower unit or shear a pin! I am joking....somewhat. Brennan was my least favorite lake of Rusty's I have fished. It was windy and crummy weather the whole trip. Our best spot was straight out from the dock to a rock face in the early morning. Then we headed toward the other camp (I believe it was the Tony's pizza guy) and near a bean shaped island in the fast water we did well also. One perk on Brennan are the extra cabins, so snorers are able to be separated One of easiest ways to save weight is have drinks flown in.....its expensive, but worth it. Also make sure you are not doubling up on things...divy up the goods. It sounds like you have some experience, but sometimes the simple things get overlooked. Good luck!"

Still it is fishing and we had to figure out where they were. Big body of water with lots of dead spots, went out the last day before our flight out and caught 50 fish in an hour with several over 21 inches. Was breezy every day and never got a day to cast for Northern. Saw a moose and a bear swimming while we were fishing. Accommodations are great, we had 11 people and had the whole place to our selves, Beautiful sunsets off the deck of the main lodge. They give you plenty of food, although we did run out of potatoes....they were the best huge reds I have every had! Pilots and flights were on time and accommodating. Will be going back for sure.
