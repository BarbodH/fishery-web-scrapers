6360454,BornToFish,2019-09-24 10:08:00,1224,"Greetings,I recently returned home from my last fishing trip during 2019 in NW Ontario. I reflected upon my 2019 fishing season during the long drive home. I started wondering about the experiences of others during 2019.This was my fifth season fishing two lakes north of Red Lake, Ontario. I made four trips to these lakes this season, fishing for a total of about six weeks: two solo fishing trips this season and two trips with my wife. My summary thought for these four trips is that the season was different from my preceding seasons fishing these lakes. The fishing wasn't poorer or better than previous seasons, rather simply being different.I fished the first ten days of the fishing season. Ice-out was about normal this season on these lakes, but the air temperature did not warm up as usual. Consequently, water temperature was cool, bordering on cold. The places that I have normally fished during opening week were not showing fish. I searched for the fish and located them in places that I had not previously fished during the early season. I did very well one I located the fish.My wife's and my trip during the first week of July was different than previous years. Things seemed to be running two weeks or so ""behind schedule"" compared to ""normal"" years, in view of the decidedly cool springtime weather. We encountered a full-blown mayfly hatch that coincided with the walleyes moving to off-shore structure. The walleyes near shore weren't active given the abundance of mayfly larvae. Many of the walleyes had left the shoreline, but weren't yet on structure. We scratched out fish during the first few days of the week, and then put up great numbers once the walleyes reached their typical destinations off-shore. We contended with mammoth wild-fires during this trip.Our trip during August was also different than previous seasons. Many of the places that we typically fished during August of preceding years were not consistently showing fish. We searched out new structures that were showing fish. Once located, the fish offered a fabulous bite during the first few hours of the morning, and then went into a neutral/negative mood during the remainder of the day/evening. Things returned to ""normal"" by the middle of the week, such that we put up great numbers of good sized walleyes throughout the daytime/evening.My fishing trip during September seemed to be an extension of fishing during August. The places that I traditionally fished during September were not showing many fish. I searched out some new places that showed fish. Those fish were scattered and definitely on the move. I would catch several nice fish and then wonder where they went. Most of my fishing in September was in 20-24 fow or so, shallower than in previous seasons.I checked my fishing journal and noted that the lake's peak water temperature was barely 70 degrees F. this season. I wonder if the relatively cool water temperature was the driver of the season being different than previous years.All in all, my wife and I were entirely satisfied with this season's fishing. Our numbers were down somewhat compared to previous seasons, in view of needing to make significant adjustments during the first few days of each fishing trip. A hidden benefit of this season is that I learned a few new places to fish, such that there are now more tools in the toolbox.How was your 2019 fishing season?Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6360460,eyecatcher1,2019-09-24 11:38:00,323,"My wife and I made two trips to the Sioux Lookout area this season. We've been going there for 27 years usually two or three times a season. I agree with you that the fishing was still good this year, but different. We mostly fish Lac Seul, but also fish Abram, Minnitaki and Pelican Lakes. We were there June 22-29 and found the water temps a little cooler than normal for that time of the year. 66-68. We found the fish still relating to shoreline structure rather than having moved to midlake reefs. There were no fish there at all. We were back up there last week Sept. 14-21 and fishing was really different for that time of the year. Water temps were 62-65. Usually we fish a lot of the same spots as we do in June or July, just a little deeper. We were finding fish in 20 to 26 feet, but not big numbers like usual. We also didn't catch any big fish. 21.25 inches was the biggest fish of the trip. We also ended up fishing new spots just to see if we could find bigger schools of fish. I'd say our summer numbers were normal, but the fall numbers down a little. People that I talked with at our resort and at the boat ramps were saying the same things. I also noticed a lot more baitfish in the water than we normally do. That could also be why our numbers were down. It's harder to fool them when they have a good supply of natural food down there. All in all we were happy with our trips also. We'll be back a few times again next year."
6360476,BornToFish,2019-09-24 13:47:00,1224,"Greetings, EyeCatcher: You raised an excellent point that I neglected to mention. The volume of baitfish (e.g. shiner minnows) was off the top of the charts this season - most notably in August and September. I'm sure that this affected our fishing in August and September as well. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6360480,prov1800,2019-09-24 13:53:00,5010,"definatly will agree with you guys.I get to fish a number of lakes including the west side of lac suel and fish were holding shallow till the end of july.I like it when when things change.But I know from experience not to fish humps in lac suel till water temps hit 70 f that's when I go try a few spots on the main lake.The fishing when its shallow is better than when they go deeper.Normally catch way more fish and larger ones plus I normally get my spots with no other boats in sight another bonus.But my year is almost over,few more trips but fishing is still awesome right now and a lot of shallow fish again."
6360492,Mojo-NC,2019-09-24 15:11:00,1929,"I definitely agree with y'all about your conclusions. We typically don't fish the fall in Canada, so I don't really have a point of reference to assess this year as ""normal"" or not. However, I can say the depths we fished were about 10' deeper than we generally fish and the magic depths we found last week were 25-30' with water temps consistently in the mid-upper 50's. We are all very flexible and are willing to move wherever we need to go to find the fish. We actually caught fish out to 40' (accidentally) as we would sometimes get blown out off of our reef or point out into deeper water while the driver was unhooking his own fish and reloading. The clouds of baitfish were so thick that sometimes our fishfinders would temporarily identify the school as the bottom. Over the course of the week we caught way too many fish to not have ""accidentally"" stumbled upon at least one biggun, but we never found him/her. In my boat we caught maybe 5 or 6 that measured 24"", with maybe a hundred or more others in the 20-23"" range. I can only imagine that the larger fish were either traveling with the bait schools or out in water deeper than we were willing to fish due to the dangers of killing them by bringing them up. All in all a great trip with great numbers, but the really big ones we had hoped for were able to elude us. I guess we'll have to go back up in June 2020."
6360500,Golden Eagle,2019-09-24 16:36:00,2642,"Went in 2 days prior to walleye opener and stayed 9 days. Fish were confused. They were not in usual locations and strayed from usual patterns. We found fish, but needed more ideas then usual. Falling in love with last year's good spots didn't work. Fished week of July 13 and, again, fish were not were we found them in previous years. Several in our party had their best ever week, but I didn't come close to matching same week for me on other trips. Probably skipping a usual October trip this year due to goofy weather and low water level. But, I've made a handful trips when I didn't decide to go until the day before. I'm packed. Thanksgiving dinner with camp owners and family works for me."
6360606,MrSimon,2019-09-25 09:38:00,922,"We only fished one week in Ontario this year and everything was awesome. The fish did exactly what they normally do in late summer. No surprises. We always fish new lakes so we couldn't get caught fishing memories, but it sounds like many folks did. Locally here in southeastern PA the trout fishing was phenomenal all year long, but the smallmouth fishing in the big rivers has been abysmal. Still, taking my kids to local ponds and catching bluegill throughout the Spring and Summer is the highlight of 2019!!"
6360624,Camoclad,2019-09-25 10:53:00,628,"Hopefully, everyone was ok. Stuff is replaceable, people are not."
6360518,Pooch,2019-09-24 18:04:00,4618,"Only made two trips this year and fishing was off or just different this year. No large fish to speak of on either trip. Numerous 25"" fish, but nothing larger. That was a little strange. Over all size was up this year in general, but numbers were down.Few ""regular"" spots produced like past years. You could not fish memories this year, if you did you were probably disappointed.I enjoy hunting new fish so I saw a lot of the lake that I had never seen before and very much enjoyed it. We found fish everywhere we looked and caught them. Many new waypoints on the memory card.The year was just ""different'. Neither poorer nor better. Just different. Most had to work harder for fish and most learned more about locating fish.Pooch"
6360528,martinbns,2019-09-24 19:33:00,1520,"We have been fishing the northern waters of LOTW every weekend since ice out. It's been a funny year, caught lots of walleye while bass fishing, normal areas were slow all summer until last weekend when we had an excellent day. One of the very knowledgeable guys I know in the area said the late iceout and slow warming into very hot weather just threw them off all summer long. We had a good season overall, but fished for walleye a lot less than previous years."
6360582,kona77,2019-09-25 07:41:00,236,"Like many folks I just get to take my one yearly trip north of the border (usually early June).. We fished our 5th different lake thru Clark's Resorts and had a great time with great fishing. Average size was one of the best for all of our trips and while we did not catch many big walleye's we boated lots in the 20-22 range (Wright Lake).. As most of you experienced the water levels were low so we could not explore one of the portage lakes but the water temps were normal for early June.. The gators were really ""neutral"" but we still caught numerous fish over 30"" on mainly walleye gear which is always a blast.. The amount of minnows we saw in two of the creeks going to two of the portage lakes were unreal.. Not sure if that was normal or not but we will verify next year (same time and lake in 2020). Some year I will do two trips and I envy you guys who can pull that off.. I know it just has to be a priority and I need to make it happen.."
6360586,lenray,2019-09-25 08:15:00,467,"My usual trip to north of the village of Pickle Lake. Went with the nephew of my wife and his 3 sons. After a 3 hour trip up the River and getting into the lake; I noticed the water was some rough. I headed to near shore with one of the boys and the other 3 headed straight up the lake. In short order their boat took on water and went down. All heavy stuff--stove cookware etc. sunk and all the light stuff floated off and went down river in a strong current. The boat popped back up with the motor end straight down. All their passports, phones, money, and BOTH KEYS in a tote went out floated for a short time and then went down--never to be seen again. Not my usual trip for sure....A lot more to the story. Could have been a lot worse................"
