Self-guided fishing, huge numbers of lake trout with potential to reach record sizes, the experience for everyone there was incredible. Our group of six boated 800 lake trout give or take, with a number of big fish personal bests. Not kidding, my wife and I caught the least numbers, as you can see tallying over 200, and I often pulled the lure away from smaller fish just tired of unhooking them. Soooo... crammed as much into the story as possible, 100+ photos, video of the biggest fish, drone shots, and there's lots to read of you like... http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/fishing...-circle-lodge/ Bunk"
