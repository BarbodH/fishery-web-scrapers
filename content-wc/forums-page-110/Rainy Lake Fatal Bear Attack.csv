6358938,youngknight,2019-09-16 21:29:00,228,No doubt sows with cubs is not a good situation however a 2011 study of bear attacks showed 88% of such attacks are by males. I think many of them were not fully mature males. As for sows with cubs...I share the following story. A forestry friend of mine was doing surveys and brought his dog along. The dog ventures away a bit constantly and returns. However on one return his dog shows up carrying a small cub by the cuff of his neck. Needless to see he got the dog to drop the little cub and used discretion as the better choice of valour and got the **** out of there!
6356018,Ogoki,2019-09-05 11:05:00,291,"As for bears being more afraid of people in remote area ,I use to think that . Watched several bear hunting videos ,where I changed my mind . Saw several acts of aggressiveness towards hunters . One guide drove boat up to shore and bear charged hunter as he got out of boat. That was in northern Saskatchewan. Seen another act of aggressiveness in a video at northern Alberta. Both fly in bear hunts . Sow bear with cubs REALLY PUTS ME ON ALERT ."
6356024,vteye3,2019-09-05 11:18:00,496,"I love floating Alaskan rivers unguided. I've never had a problem. The bears are there to eat.We keep a very clean camp, no fishing clothing, gear etc in the tent. Evening meal iseaten at a prior stop on the river. No snacks were we sleep. We always make a smokey fire. We see a few bears to as many as 10 per trip. They are all individuals with there own personalities. Yep, momma with cubs is a scary combination."
6356028,vteye3,2019-09-05 11:24:00,496,"We learned on an early trip that bears will travel up the river bank despite our pot banging, yelling, etc. I much prefer the bears that cruise through the area rather than the ones that hide at our sight."
6356072,Ogoki,2019-09-05 15:15:00,291,"While talking bears, I have pass this on . A guy I know and his 3 some use to visit a fly in outpost that I did. He came to my shop ,after a trip and said ,do you ever have bear issues at that camp . I replied no and started quizzing him ,about a clean camp . His reply was """" yes we keep a clean camp , we burn our bacon grease every morning after we eat """" . Well for people who don't know ,burning bacon grease or honey ,is a bear baiters trick to pull bears to a hunter. He didn't know ,but thought he was doing the right thing ."
6356224,stumcfar,2019-09-06 07:46:00,451,"Some of you may remember hearing about this. Several years back we pulled into the Trillium in Ear Falls and got talking with a few guys out front. A member of their fishing party had been taken by ambulance to Red Lake earlier that evening after being attacked on the side of the road near Ear Falls. They had gotten out to take pictures of a bear. The not so smart member of their group brought some candy to give to the bear when it attacked him. Earlier in the day though, that bear had an encounter with a school bus and was very aggressive. The RCMP were called to dispatch it, but it had disappeared. Even though rare, attacks do happen"
6356640,Whopper,2019-09-07 17:20:00,340,"This year on our annual spring trip to a lodge north of Red Lake we had a guy in camp that did something very stupid and put out treats to bring in a couple bears. He was showing off for a couple of real nimrods in his group, all of them thought it was pretty cool. Long story short the bears became a nuisance for not only the rest of the week we were there but for the next couple weeks after. Camp owner told the guy to stop and had to deal with his stupidity."
6357458,prov1800,2019-09-11 07:07:00,5010,That's about as dumb as it gets.
6357490,vteye3,2019-09-11 08:35:00,496,Just like the idiot that recently was gored in Yellowstone trying to take a selfie with a Buffalo. Darwin at his finest..
6357996,Captain Donn,2019-09-12 16:27:00,6,The attack was only about 5 miles from where i live on Rainy. We went by the island on the following Wednesday and saw chopper and 2 OPP patrol boats looking for the other 2 bears. Rumor has it that they did find and kill them. Some of our friends have cabins less than a mile from there. Sad deal for sure.
6358774,Guest,2019-09-16 12:46:00,0,"My first instinct when I see a bear is to look for cubs. Cubs change everything. Without them the majority of bears (there are always exceptions) would rather just go about their business. If cubs are around, the situation is unpredictable and volatile. I was at Yellowstone and Glacier this summer. I watched numerous morons get out of their cars to take pics a a black bear and her 2 cubs. They got within 50' and were too far away from their cars if she charged. They were lucky, she was in a a tolerant mood. I let my kids watch out the window for a few minutes, shook my head and got the **** out of there. In Glacier on the same trip my daughter and I had a 500 lb grizzly come within 25' of us in a meadow. I had the bear spray out, but if was obvious within 5 seconds he had no interest in us, other than getting past us to his feeding spot. The only time he got agitated was when I yelled for my daughter to get behind me. He was startled by my yelling. I started talking in a soothing voice ...... Good bear, Nice bear, don't eat me bear (literally what I said). He got our scent (it was raining, he had not got our scent, which is likely why he was so close) and visibly relaxed. He skirted around us at 30' (I backed off but had a creek to my back) cut in front of us, and started turning over stones for grubs. Best part is my daughter took a bunch of pics, as she had her camera out taking pics of flowers. I took a 10 second or so video, counted my good fortune, and we headed down the trail a good clip, with me walking backwards keeping an eye on the grizzly. He never looked up."

6355760,Juls,2019-09-04 12:39:00,13414,What a scary and horrible way to go....
6355840,That Minnesota guy,2019-09-04 18:37:00,8293,Almost worse then being killed at 62 years old by a bear is having your 80 year old parents there. Sad story.
6355896,Fishwitit,2019-09-04 23:31:00,46,Iâ€™ve been charged by a bear on an island while having shore lunch. Scary situation.
6355920,jfaisten,2019-09-05 04:36:00,1060,My daughter lives in Asheville NC and black bears are frequent visitors to many of the subdivisions. Not uncommon for them to walk down the street in the middle of the day or raid garbage cans at all times of the day or night. The people that have lived their for some time treat it as no big deal -- black bears aren't aggressive. This horrible death proves you simply can't trust an animal this large in the wild.
6355926,Ogoki,2019-09-05 05:38:00,291,"Very sad situation . I just returned from 20 days bear hunting at Armstrong . Bears have personalities just like people do. I have been bear hunting since 2005 and have observed many bears ,but none like one I watched this past week. This bear might have been 125 to 140 lbs. Had a small brown patch of hair between his shoulder blades. My wife and I watched him run much larger bears off the food . Stood on his hind feet swatting larger bears. Had a real attitude . Even spotted my trail camera secured to a tree and walked over with one swat and ripped it off the tree. Was secured with a ratchet strap. Watched 8 bears that evening . Driving back to camp ,we discussed that this bear may be one that would attack. Never seen one that size with such an aggressive attitude.I"

6355968,Mojo-NC,2019-09-05 08:27:00,1929,"Yeah, thanks for sharing this little tidbit the day before we leave for a 10 day stay on a remote lake in NW Ontario. Luckily the place has indoor plumbing or I'd be holding it all night."
6355980,LOW1,2019-09-05 08:59:00,2828,"I wonder if a person is safer from black bears in a more remote area? Rainy Lake is not when compared to fly in lakes, etc ""remote."" Does remoteness give bears more ability to avoid and fear people? Does being on an island increase or decrease the risk? Do bears even think like that? Obviously its a rare tragedy. Condolences to all involved."
6355998,Mojo-NC,2019-09-05 09:45:00,1929,"Good question. My only experience with black bears is from the Great Smoky Mountains National Park where the bears are very used to being around people. We had a bear visit our tent camp site every night and it did not bother us inside our tent. We were advised not to bring any food inside with us. Our neighbors kept their food inside of their VW Beetle. The bear climbed on top of their car and dented it all up trying to get at their food. We had a zip-lock bag on our picnic table with matches, dish soap, and insect repellent inside. The bear bit a hole in the bag. Other bears I've seen in the park during the daylight hours seem to carry on with their business without paying any attention to people at all. If a bear gets aggressive or becomes too much of a nuisance in a campground, the rangers will live-trap them and relocate them to a more remote area of the park."
