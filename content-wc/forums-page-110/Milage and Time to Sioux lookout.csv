6358340,elway12,2019-09-14 12:24:00,335,Looking for any information on how long in real time and mileage it takes to travel from Minneapolis(airport) to Sioux Lookout? I have looked at Google Maps but sometimes the times can be inaccurate and of course the border crossing times can be a big factor. Also the mileage/time to going the Pigeon River/Thunder Bay route. I know it's longer route. Thanks.

It's 450 miles and about 10 hours including a stop for breakfast and a couple other quick stops. I just drove across at the border. No line at all and that was at 12:30 pm. When you turn up 502 there is about 12 miles of dirt road, but they were working so that will be shorter with time. The rest of the road is in good shape. Not much traffic at all."

I always figure about 10 hours and I am 45 minutes from the airport. Google maps says its 8 hours 11 minutes however I always add around 2 hours if you are stopping for breakfast, gas, and the border crossing. Depending on the time of day I would figure about 12 hours."

6358946,elway12,2019-09-16 22:16:00,335,"Thank you all for the helpful information!martinbns - Short answer is money. The RT bag fees alone on those 2 airlines cost more than the gas to get way up there. I also like the drive, it's part of the experience for my group."
