6360472,prov1800,2019-09-24 13:34:00,5010,Well we got to head back into Clarks Okanse Lake for our moose hunt.Myself my wife and bill and jeff went into the camp in a beaver and a Cessna the beaver taking the brunt of the load.Great flight in and great weather for fishing but a little on the warm side for moose hunting at 90 f for 2 days and then the wind and rain started.Had some decent weather in between storms.We got the 80-90 plus km winds or more on the Thursday night that Red Lake got and take was a spooky night but everything hung in even the boats that were tied up to the dock.The rut seemed not to be happening as we called all week with no answers and the tracks we saw 2 weeks ago were gone and no new ones all week on the beaches.Saw one moose one morning but to dark to tell what it was and it vanished.Thursday Jeff had a young bull come to feed or drink 200 yards from the small island he was watching from and made a perfect shot so we did manage to get one.We spent a lot of time fishing the lake and trying a lot of new areas and we caught fish everywhere so that was a lot fun.Best seemed to be in the 4-8 ft of water which was running around 59 f.If we found a weed line there were tons of walleye and found some real decent perch in those areas also.The shallow rock piles also produced tons of fish.Did not matter which part of the lake we fished there were fish everywhere.Definatly a fun lake to fish as it was 2 weeks ago the first time my wife and I went there.Caught a bunch of pike also but so far a 33 incher is the best so far.Would highly recommend Okanse Lake as a fishing and hunting destination.Our flight in and out takes about 45 min.Geared for 6 people.
