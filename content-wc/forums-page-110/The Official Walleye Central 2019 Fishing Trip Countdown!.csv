6274354,Mojo-NC,2019-01-02 07:44:00,1929,We're doing our first fly-in trip in 246 days! It's going to be a long summer as we usually go up in June and this year we decided to go the first full week in September. We'll have to live vicariously through all of the WC'ers who post summaries of their trips throughout the early season and summer months.
6274358,Jwendt15,2019-01-02 07:51:00,72,"217 days until we had to Lac Seul. Had to skip the 2018 trip so it's been two years for us, can't wait!"
6274374,pjshorthorn,2019-01-02 08:31:00,5654,"Two trips are planned and confirmed for this year......a third is most likely going to be on the fly....so to speak. Just setting up the first two trips with the owners has been a bit of a logistical dance; with a lot of conversations surrounding behavioral patterns, that aren't true, before my deposits would even be accepted. So conversations included: - Minnow Molestation -Crawler Cruelty - fishing in a birthday suit....ok I can see that as a possibility, but not on these 2 trips..too cold! - accused of being a Vikings fan.......I resent this vehemently ......I know my handle has horn in it, but that ain't what it means - fraternizing with Chicago guys in camp.....ain't happening unless they have good beer - poor pee aim in both a rental boat and in a cabin fixture....not true....ever. The stream is straight and true. - moonlight marauding....I'm not even sure what this means unless clothing is optional with a young lady who wants to fish under a moonlit night. I guess skeeter spray would be optional too. - accused of trying to change the Canadian word eh to A. - beaver shaving We shall see how these trips go with some new group members. It could be great......it could be a trip where the struggle is real ....... Best of luck to everyone on their 2019 trips. PjShorthorn"
