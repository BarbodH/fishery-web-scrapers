6359822,ehelt,2019-09-20 09:19:00,3,My dad is turning 60 this year and my brothers and I would like to give him a memory that will hopefully last a lifetime. We are considering doing the all inclusive bus trip (from Madison) to Temple Bay Resort to fish Eagle Lake. The two trip options we have are either a 7 day trip from June 15-June 22 or a 5 day trip from July 16-July 21. Are either one of these dates better in regards to fishing? We will primarily be looking for walleyes and occasionally perch and or small mouth. Any other tips and or pointers from people who have fished this lake at a similar time would be more than appreciated. Thanks!

IMHO, I wouldn't give up the mid-June spot if you paid me as it's a great time of year for all levels of fishing. Beginners or experienced Walleye, Smallies and Pike will all be available in 15' of water or less for the most part. Great time of year in NW Ontario."

I would suggest the 4 days fishing stay and take a guide for days one and two then going exploring on day three and take a guide the last day. It's nice to take a guide the last day as you can relax and they do the fabulous shore lunch for you. The one comment about being crowded or busy is not a problem as all the guides are busy and working the lake and know where the fish are , and better able to put you on fish. Jigs and minnows are the bread and butter for that lake. Chartreuse and plain jigs work well. Sometimes a little orange color on chartreuse jigs is a go to color. It's a huge lake with 400 islands and many small bays so you can almost always find a spot to fish if weather is rough. Good Luck and enjoy."
