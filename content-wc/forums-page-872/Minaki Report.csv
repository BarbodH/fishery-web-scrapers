We are planning to come up for some Northern/Walleye fishin next week, and I am very curious to see how things are shaping up. Any thoughts would be greatly, greatly appreciated!Also, any word on a good guide for that area?Jon Zimmerman, Rochester, MN507-261-4207"
531415,Guest,2003-05-21 22:06:00,0,"Well, to be blunt. SLOW. Fishing has been tough. Working hard to find fish. I have heard no great numbers & sizes. No current in the river and the weather has been very un stable. The water levels are about 6 1/2 feet below ""normal"". I do not know water temps. (just never checked) I think in the next few days that I'll check out the bottom of Little Sand / Big Sand maybe the fish moved out there. To answer the question..... yes we did hire ""River_Eye"". He's a ok guy...........Good FishenRob"
531416,Guest,2003-05-22 06:49:00,0,Rob.....the fishing is going to suck right up until a couple daysbefore I get there :)
531417,Illini Bob,2003-05-22 09:31:00,16,"Five weeks left until our week in paradise.Does anyone know if 'The Throat' is still navigable at the current water level?This will be our ninth year on the Winnipeg River and I don't think the water has ever been as low as I'm hearing it is now. Kinda a got used to the high water of the last 2 years.Thanks, Bob"
531418,Guest,2003-05-22 11:21:00,0,Bob..........I don't know for sure but I'm guessing it is navigatable. Going out on a limb here but in five weeks I'll bet you the water level is about normal.
531424,Reels,2003-05-23 07:29:00,2876,"Thanks Rob,Last year I was up the week before the flood, and the same thing, unstable weather, low water, no current, and fishing was tough... for walleye at least, but it was some of the best northern fishing I have seen in a while up there.If it stays like this, your right, your probably going to have to go up to BS. The less we depended on current last year, the better off we were.See you in a few weeks.<{{}}><"
531425,River_eye,2003-05-24 13:10:00,1486,"Thanks for the statement of approval Rob and not telling everybody about how much of a jerk I am. :-)Most things seem to be shaping up at Minaki, although we could always use more guide bookings. Hopefully we'll be getting keys to that bait shop so we don't have to wait for you return to get our minnows :-)."
531419,Guest,2003-05-28 11:19:00,0,"At the throat on 05-23, got to 3.2 ft. turned around. no current low water, water temps 50.1 05-21to 58.4 05-26."
531420,Illini Bob,2003-05-28 12:19:00,16,"Thanks JP, Did you turn around because you didn't think there was a chance to make it thru(or back)? How deep do you think it was, at it's shallowest point?Thanks, Bob"
531421,Guest,2003-06-01 11:11:00,0,chickened-out when I saw the rocks. talked to some guys who had made it through in small boats.rocks under my gelcoat makes me nervous.
531422,Illini Bob,2003-06-02 07:11:00,16,"Can't blame you there. Rocks and Fiberglass are not a good combination.We'll be in 16' aluminum 'Bass' boats, so we'll have to check it out when we get there.Thanks for the info, Bob."
