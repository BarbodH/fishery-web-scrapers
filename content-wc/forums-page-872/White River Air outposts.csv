531698,Eric,2003-05-29 10:37:00,114,Anyone with comments on the outposts that White River Air has? What about their two outposts on Esnagi Lake. Wife and I are looking for privacy and a few walleye to eat. Thanks !!!!
531699,ggg,2003-05-31 17:52:00,115,"How much privacy are you looking for? There are 2 lodges on Esnagi, Mar Mac Lodge and Esnagi Lake Lodge. I am going to Mar Mac sometime in Aug. with 20 some guys, so there is not a lot of privacy."
531700,Guest,2003-05-31 19:12:00,0,Went there ( Mar Mac ) 3 years ago. Typical privacy for a lodge type operation. I believe thay have two outpost units which are typical outposts.
531701,Eric,2003-06-01 09:42:00,114,Mainly interested in the outposts that are on lakes without other camps. Been to any of them? Was wondering of the quality of walleye fishing.
531702,Guest,2003-06-01 17:30:00,0,"Have been on 3 flyouts with White river air.2 to lake Mccoy and 1 to lake Jembi. I went with friends who have used this outfitter for many years. they like lake Shekak a lot.Walleye fishing is very good, by this I mean approx 30-50 per day. Usally 16-17 inch range. An occasional 20 and my best was 26.Pike fishing also good. 20-40 pike per day. most about 24-28 inch . Usally 1-4 over 36"" and maybe 1 of those at 40"". Cabins have been cleaned up and upgraded. Propane lights and fridge (if it works) and propane cooking and Grill. pots pans and plates are spartan. Outhouse and no running water. Bring a shower bag or you will smell by weeks end.Boats are 14foot lund and naden. Motors are 5 and 6 HP merc 2 strokes that are 1-2 years old and start easily. Plenty of gas and propane.Flight servives are very good and professional.Overall a good and reputable outfit. Not luxury by any means but good fishing for a fair price. Also all 3 lakes mentioned above are small but you are the only people on the lake. Ericemail me if you need more [email protected]"
