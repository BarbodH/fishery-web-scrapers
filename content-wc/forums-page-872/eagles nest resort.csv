531177,chrism,2003-05-26 15:23:00,429,"SteveI am not sure if River-eye is in civilization right now or if he is out at the lake - I hope I can help...I'm sure eagle nest landing can supply you with a guide for a day, as well as ""Trail End Camp"" which is located just past the boat launch in Sawmill bay.I would highly suggest that you get a guide for a day, and supply each boat with the Winnipeg river marine map which is available at the gov't map store on route 90.This is not a water that you want to be on unless you know it very well, to get to Eagle nest you have to get through 4 rocky areas that have a 15ft margin of error between port/starboard reefs. The maps will show most of the danger zones.There are gov camping spots back on Eagle nest, some are quite nice - camping is not an issue if you stay at one of these sites - and they too are on the map. If you have a GPS email me and I'll give you the #'s to some of these camp spots.The water has risen a bit, and now a lot of the reefs are at water level or slightly below - be careful! If you haven't taken your boat there before, make sure each boat has a spare prop. It is a long way back to the boat launch.Don't mean to sound negative, but I've lost a few hours of fishing towing uneducated people back to the launch!"
531178,Guest,2003-05-27 17:52:00,0,"River_eye and Chrism We are going up to Eagles nest's Landing the first week and half of July. We are doing some food and beverage planing. Dose Pointe du Bois, have a Grocers. And is a Beer store close. If not I know my way some what around the east and south part of Winnipeg and Ft. Gary. My grandmother lived on Somerset offPemiba Hwy.Eric you may have seen her A few years back. She was the 98 year old that walks out in to the pemina hwy, and puts her had up and expects you to stop. She caused 3 Rear enders to happen. so they put in a PED cross walk By the Drug store. Sorry For the Rambling. We will be crossing the border very early before any thing I think will be open their.also we want to pick up some leachesany good place to pick some up. River_eye I forgot to ask you when i e-mailed you back in march dose Eagles nest sell the frozen salted shiners. and do they keep them at the Landing. Are Shiners the way to go or do any other salted minnowswork I find the shiners we get here seam to not last long. We use fat head's and Red tail's here. I was going to bring some up to get us started. Also do you ever use night crawllers. I have the boaters map and have been looking it over. Do you have any general area's for us to look at at the Landing end, We love to find the fish but will take A Heads Up any day. Thanks For Your's HelpGarth Merrick"
531179,chrism,2003-05-27 23:07:00,429,Garth email me please and I'll try to answer your question.I think Eric is at the lake.chris
531180,Guest,2003-05-28 18:56:00,0,CHRIS M I could not find your E-mail ADD. Mine is [email protected]Thanks again for any info.Garth
531184,Eye Wish,2003-06-01 14:42:00,5,I am heading up to Pointe du Bois June 11 staying at Trails end this time. Any of your please post a report on how you did and I will do the same.
531183,River_eye,2003-06-01 14:58:00,1486,I sent you an e-mail.
531181,River_eye,2003-06-01 15:01:00,1486,"There is a small grocery store in PDB that also sells beer and liquor. My advice is to pick up groceries in Lac du Bonnet, you will have to drive by the town anyways.Shiners just happen to be the most popular bait to sell around here. Yes we do have problems with them getting soggy, but it depends on how old they are when you buy them. It's kind of a hit or miss type of thing. Try some other frozen baits and tell me how they work."
531182,River_eye,2003-06-01 15:08:00,1486,"Yes Chris is right, I've been in the bush for the last while.Eagle nest won't offer any guides at the landing unfortunately. Trail end camp across the bay will, but they might want to use their own boat and will probably not go overnight, but it never hurts to ask.I am somwhat of a freelance guide at the moment, employed partly at Minaki lodge and am doing a trial at Totem lodge, so I don't know what my schedule looks like, but I'd be interested in a trip like yours and would charge you less than anywhere else."
531185,timeout,2003-06-02 05:31:00,28,"My father came back from eaglenest on saturday. He was somewhat surprised as the pickerel ( walleye) were down at the 40 foot level. The usual spots for this time of the year were not producing,probably a result of the low water level. They ran out of salteds and were picking them up on plastics after that. they were only fishing for the eyes and he was fairly pleased with the results."
531167,Guest,2003-05-17 18:04:00,0,"Hello, everyone a group of us are heading to eagles nest in 10 days and was wondering if any one had recommendations on bait, jigs and lures for my first time in manitoba.We have been going to wawa for several years. Cant wait to go i could always use tips, and love buying more tackle. Thanks, andy"
531168,DonC,2003-05-17 21:05:00,93,"I recommend tube jigs for the smallmouth. No live minnows allowed. The fishing is well above average. You can troll against the current with deep baby normans in 8 to 12 feet of water and catch all the fish you want, mainly walleye with some smallmouth. Don"
531169,BD,2003-05-19 05:12:00,739,IMHO: In 8 to 12 feet of water nothing can beat trolling Mirrolure jointed crankbaits in the 2 3/4 inch size for eyes. www.mirrolure.com
531170,chrism,2003-05-19 19:20:00,429,Eagle Nest in Manitoba or Ontario? Which one???I just spent three days at the Manitoba lake - may be able to help you a bit...cm
531171,timeout,2003-05-20 18:46:00,28,"Chrism, how is the water level? Are there lots of formerly submerged rocks and reefs out of the water?"
531172,chrism,2003-05-20 19:04:00,429,"Yup, there are a lot of reefs showing that we haven't seen for some time - l have seen it lower though, think it was back in 1998. The PDB dam is holding water back, so the main lake is relatively full, but once you get past Lamprey, you really see the drop. From Kendall to Eagle nest lake is something else right now, as there were lots of reefs just below the waters surface - serious boat busters!I was lucky enough to remember these from years gone by, but if you haven't seen them before, you are in for a scarey surprise when you see just how many there are! I would guess the water is down 5-6 feet from last year.Water temp was high 40's, and the big pike were hitting hard. Didn't really try for walleye. Bass was marginal. Little echo is impassable.All this rain should help a bit.It will only get better as it warms up!cm"
531173,timeout,2003-05-20 20:47:00,28,"Is the water level low enough that one could walk out to the last rock of the reef at cabin cut. Is that last rock about 30-45 yards past what appears to be to be the end out of the water yet. I wanted to go up last week but even with insurance I just wasn't ready to rack up my new motor. A 2 1/2 hour trip back on a 9.9 cursing those shifting rocks (lol) is not all that relaxing.Were you working the bays and creeks north and east of the campsite on the island or is it too shallow to get up the creek, past where it forks. (north of bass island)The creek into little echo is impassable? Does that mean Green bay is inaccessible as well? Thanks for any info as I really have to try and get up there more often this year."
531174,chrism,2003-05-21 05:46:00,429,"Yes, I worked the islands and creek mouths in the area. The creeks you mention are about 8"" deep at the mouth, echo is about 2ft at the entrance, and 1 ft deep further up. You would get your ankles wet at both reefs at cabin cut."
531175,River_eye,2003-05-24 13:21:00,1486,"Hey Andy. I guided and worked for Fred at Eagle Nest for the last 6 years, but I'm not up there this year. You picked one of the best camps in all of Manitoba and NW Ontario in terms of value for your dollar. Fishing is getting better by the year since they made new walleye size limits a few years ago. I'm guiding with a different lodge this year, but wish I was back at Eagle Nest.Anyways, jigs tipped with frozen shiners are the go to bait for walleye. Colours are white yellow and pink in that order. In 1/4 and 3/8th oz sizes. Water is low and current is slow this year so you will probably get by with just 1/4 oz. Pike, anything shiny. Try to have a selection including spoons, mepps spinnners, spinner baits jerk baits, and one of the guides, Pat, will swear by the buzz baits. Make sure you have a couple weedless baits like spinner baits and johnson's silver minnows.Bass like small 1/8th oz jigs black or unpainted with dark coloured twister tails, as well as other various crank baits.Hope you have fun, I know you will."
531176,Stevie B,2003-05-26 12:52:00,157,"River_eyeI'm going up to Eagle's Nest in 4 weeks. I hope that the water is a little higher by then. But I was wondering, we are going in as a group of about 3-4 boats. What abouts would be the charge for a guy to show us up the river. We want to camp somewhere on the lake. Or how do they feel about that, if we aren't staying at their camp but asking for services to get up the river? Give me an e-mail of you want.Fish ON!!"
