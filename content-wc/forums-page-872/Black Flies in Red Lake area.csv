I said ""who cares there's black flies all over my cattle as we speak"" he said ""I don't think we're talking about the same black flies, these things can absolutly drive you nuts. So my question to you is, does anyone know if the black flies will be a problem on my upcoming trip and if so what can I do to prepare myself and my group. Thank you Farmboy from Nebraska."
