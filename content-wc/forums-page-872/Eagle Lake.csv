531405,Guest,2003-05-22 07:57:00,0,"Eagle is a very large body of water, where will you be staying?"
531406,catchNrelease,2003-05-22 08:09:00,157,And...when will you be there?
531407,Guest,2003-05-22 17:31:00,0,I will be staying at eagle lake lodge in late August
531408,catchNrelease,2003-05-23 09:41:00,157,What part of the lake is that on?
531409,Guest,2003-05-23 10:24:00,0,I think the south I am not sure though and it is legal to use planer boards
531410,catchNrelease,2003-05-23 10:52:00,157,I'm only familiar with the north part of the lake. I'll also be there in late August. Jigging over a 27-33ft rock reef works well while in lowlight pulling cranks on the sandflats produces nice hogs.Good luck
531411,fishmaster,2003-05-31 06:28:00,209,Fished Eagle Lake for the openner and fishing was great once you figured out what they wanted.Walleye fishing on rough points and wind blown shoreline was the best also caught northerns. Perch fishing was the best ever this year filled up in about an hour(100) 2 guys.Lake trout fishing was good on Clearwater but good luck getting there if your camp owner does not have a boat on the lake.Wind was blowing every day during the trip but what else is new at least the temps were not bad.
531412,Guest,2003-05-31 09:11:00,0,"Just got back from Eagle. Walleye's were in Lost Bay, Muskeg [spelling] and Trout Hole 1 (just a few). We used Little Joes with minnows or leeches slow trolled. The bite was best around 10:00am and 3:00pm."
531413,Wisconeye,2003-06-01 10:56:00,79,What were the water conditions in Muskeg like? I've heard things are really low and thought that maybe Muskeg would be really hard to fish.Did you try around the island right outside the entrance to Muskeg?Not going until the 13th but always found Muskeg good and would certainly go there if the water is up enough.
