531550,JackSalmon,2003-05-29 19:25:00,169,ncsds: I would appreciate any comments that you could make about Monument Bay. You can e-mail me at [email protected] I would really appreciate your comments. JackSalmon.
531551,Guest,2003-05-31 20:45:00,0,"We are going up this weekend 6/4/03. I will let you know how the fishing is? It should be good? It is a good time of year to go up. We go up about 6-7 times a year stay on Oak Island. Monument Bay should be a nice place never stayed there but have been there. All the resorts up there do a really good job. If you are not getting a guide I would bring an extra prop water is low but not to bad. All you should need for tackle is some spinners and jigs of variuous colors. (pink,gold,chartuse, red&white)I will let you know when we get back.Good luck"
531539,JackSalmon,2003-05-26 05:55:00,169,"In just over two weeks, we are heading to LOTW, in the Northwest Angle, for a week of fishing. We are primarily looking for walleye and smallmouth. Any tips re tackle, etc, where to find fishing reports, etc. will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, JackSalmon."
531540,BD,2003-05-26 15:28:00,739,"The eyes should still be oriented to the shallower structure. Trolling in under 12' of water with L&S Mirrolures, River Runts (you can tell I'm an OLD timer), and other cranks can pay off big. When trolling use a leader. When the eyes are in shallow so are the big northerns and muskys. Slip bobber rigs in the shallows and jigging the dropoffs just off of the shallows can also pay off."
531541,JackSalmon,2003-05-26 18:24:00,169,"BD: Thanks for the info. Just a couple of questions. What size, model and color of L&S Mirrorlures? Also, what size River Runt. I remember them from years ago and was not aware they were still made. If so, where can I get a few? Again, thanks for the help. JackSalmon."
531542,BD,2003-05-27 06:22:00,739,"The Mirrolure jointed crankbaits only come in three sizes now. I prefer the medium size, 2 3/4"", what used to be called the OOM or Panfishmaster, allthough the other sizes have, at times, been better. For colors , I have had the most consistant luck on LOTW with #23 (black back, yellow belly, gold scale), and RT (rainbow trout). Sometimes another color will work better but I start out with these two. You can check out the lures at www.mirrolure.comRiver Runts are available on ebay, at garage sales etc. They aren't made anymore and can be expensive to buy. I've picked up some on ebay and elsewhere really cheap because they had badly chiped paint and / or rusted hooks so collectors didn't go for them. New hooks will put them back into fish catching shape. I usually use the floaters for long line trolling.In the last eight years that I have gone to LOTW in early June, my partner and I have won the big walleye of the week contest four times. This was in a group of twenty plus guys. Three times the big eye came on a Mirrolure and once on a River Runt. Two other years we took second place in the weekly contest. In addition the big walleye of the day contest was also won by us numerous times. The jiggers and slip bobber fishermen seem to catch more than we do but we seem to get into more big fish while trolling.Other lures you may have and like to try out are Flatfish, Lazy Ikes, and OK-Dokes. Hanging a crawler on the back hook of these banana baits can drive eyes and smallies wild. Sometimes it's fun just to experiment with what's not ""hot"" these days."
531545,Guest,2003-05-27 06:35:00,0,"I will also being going to the angle in 11 days. If you want quanity or quality Jack is right.Artificials will catch you the quality but a jig will get you quanity.I""m changing colors all the time so it is hard to tell which color is best.White,gold and viking purple are my favorites.If you use artificials use any of the shad raps orr wally divers they work great. Myself I strictly jig and and do quite well with some pretty nice fish. What resort are you going out of? We will be out of Youngs Bay so if you around look us up.We are Team Fish Guts."
531546,JackSalmon,2003-05-27 10:28:00,169,We will be at Monument Bay Lodge. We are going to start fishing on June 15 and have a week of fishing. None of us have ever been to LOTW and we are fired up about this trip. Thank you so much for the information. JackSalmon.
531543,JackSalmon,2003-05-27 10:36:00,169,"BD: Do you troll, cast, or both? Thanks, JackSalmon."
531544,BD,2003-05-27 15:52:00,739,"I ""long line"" troll most of the time. Using boards on the small areas we normally hit would be to much goofing around reseting boards each time we make a pass. There are times when the wind is right, I will drift with a a chromium color Lazy Ike with a crawler on the back hook or a Lindy Rig. I will jig or use slip bobbers but that is usually a last resort and has happened only a couple of times in fifteen years."
531547,Guest,2003-05-28 10:50:00,0,"If you're going to Monument Bay Lodge, be sure to spend a lot or most of your time up at Bishop Bay fishing the rock reefs. Bishop is about 5-6 miles Northeast...worth the trip. We've stayed there six out of the last seven years and have had our best luck for walleyes at Bishop."
531548,JackSalmon,2003-05-28 15:54:00,169,"ndscs: Thanks for the information. We have never been to LOTW and are really looking forward to this trip. If you have any recommendations of things that we should take/things not to take, I would really appreciate it. Again, thanks, JackSalmon."
