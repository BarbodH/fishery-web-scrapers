I have no idea what the concern is. But, I guess we will purchasing our potatoes in Canada. Does anyone know what the deal is?"
531820,jzstiff,2003-06-01 21:50:00,188,"I just got back from Ontario and brought potatoes. Never got asked the question. Perhaps it's a ""mad spud"" scare? Sometimes people will fertilize their potatoes with skins from other potatoes and then all heck breaks loose. Seriously though, I wouldn't worry about the spuds. If there is any truth to it, they won't turn you back. They'll make you leave them. Perhaps the pay for border guards ain't that great and it's just a way of supplementing income :P"

Very remote chance but but better to be safe than sorry.The same goes for veggies entering the U.S.Besides, you can buy 20lbs of potatoes in Ontario for $2.99 anyways so why bother."
