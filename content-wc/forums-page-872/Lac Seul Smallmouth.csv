531718,Mike KS,2003-05-30 05:49:00,18,"Been fishing Lac Seul for several years and the Smallie action gets better every year. We catch a few Smallies while Walleye jigging and when we actually fish for Smallies we do good. The ones we catch run between 15"" and 18"" and make a great bonus fish.....Good Luck"

Our resort owner grew up on the lacke & said he's never caught one on the lake. 2 years ago we landed 1, last year none. now 5. looks like they are getting more numerous. Last one came up to the boat 3 or 4 times with another smallie zooming along with it each time. Never seen anything like that. Anybody seen it before? A nesting pair maybe?"

Smallies are competitive for food, and sometimes catching one fish will trigger others to bite."
