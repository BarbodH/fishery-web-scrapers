531872,retire55,2003-06-02 09:10:00,1029,"Jessica:My recommendation for the best way to cook ""sweet"" walleye fillets to ensure the flavour is the ""least"" disguised is simply to cook them in a little butter (touch of olive oil) in a cast iron skillet with salt and pepper to taste. Those 16 to 19 inchers cooked this way are ""food for kings""."
531873,Guest,2003-06-02 09:19:00,0,"Try this.....boil the Walleye until it is white....chop it up into little pieces....mix in salt,pepper,onion,raw eggs and cracker crumbs and fry in oil. WALLEYE PATTIES...ummm good"
531874,Guest,2003-06-02 09:56:00,0,"I take along a zip-lock bag of crushed cracker crumbs with a little salt and pepper added, and some cans of carnation milk. Simply dip the filets in carnation milk and then cracker crumbs and pan fry in some oil. You can do the same thing with corn flake crumbs or flour."
531875,phishfearme,2003-06-02 14:12:00,1242,"jess - for years we did the frying routine but good old wil gangloff changed out cooking habits when he brought up one of those fillet holders for the grill (where you open the holder, lay on the fillets and close the holder onto the fillets). after spraying the holder with PAM, he spreads butter on each side of each fillet the sprinkles lemon-pepper seasoning on each then cooks quickly on a hot gas grill or open fire with hot coals. try it. you won't be dissappointed. phish"
531877,BD,2003-06-02 15:02:00,739,"IMHO; The best premixed fish breading is ""Bookbinders Fish and Seafood Breadcrumbs"". The local country stores do not carry it but the IGA orders it for me. The best home made breading I have ever had is a recipe given to us by an old guide out of the Atikokan area. To bad its a secret I can't devulge :)"
531876,ankorklankor,2003-06-02 18:04:00,273,I'm with you on the basket over the fire. I prefer cooking them over a bed of hot charcoal. I spray the fillets with pam also then sprinkle them with your favorite cajun or blackened fish seasoning. It don't get any better than that.
