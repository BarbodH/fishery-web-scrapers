I really enjoy reading all the places that people go and would like to get a few ideas on good fly in outfitters.There are a few items that we are looking for.Needs to a max of 12 hours from Western New York, so western Ontario would be too far.We want to target Northern Pike, with the chance to get some in the 12 to 15 pound range. The lake also needs to hold walleye for a few meals.Cabin will need to accomodate 8 to 10 guys.We like the idea of a Sunday to Sunday trip. This works good for us so that we can drive up on Saturday and fly out on Sunday. But if a lake is really good, then we would consider other timing.Send me an e-mail at [email protected]ThanksJay"
