Believe it or not, one of the best spots is just out from the lodge. Stonehedge (island with rock fence) is also producing bigger fish. Have no reports to confirm, but there has been boats heading off to the Gunn Lake region, (Cobalt Narrows ?) I personally have not been out due to work demands but HOPEFULLY soon ! Water temp is 52 - 54, have also heard of a temp of 62 (this I doubt) SLOW presentation is working best. All is well @ the lodge & am still waiting to actually meet some of y'all ! Good news, the Lodge is offering a GREAT deal on rooms etc & shall shortly be advertising right here on W.C Good Fishen'Robwww.minakilodge.com"

Tells me they are starting to migrate back into Little Sand. Another week or two, traditional spots should be hot.<{{}}><"
