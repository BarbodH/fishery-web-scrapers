531513,Guest,2003-05-25 15:45:00,0,How about an update on the lake itself as well as fishing patterns? We have 8 more days before we can leave and hope all of you that were able to get up there so far had great fishing.
531514,Guest,2003-05-26 15:48:00,0,"gary,,Lac Seul is down about 8 to 10 ft of water but dont let this worry you...fishing has been fantastic just be sure u have a detailed map as there r lots of shouls and hidden rocks ...you might wanna try the mouth of the wenesaga river or head up to sawmill bay big lunkers up there..a little early for steamboat narrows though and if you r real adventureous ya might wanna try Mckenzie bay.... Heard that access to broad n sunlight is a no go cause of water levels but that should be more than enough places to try... the spawn is over for the most part..but guys r still finding them in 3 to 8 ft of water... as for pike..well they r always around and im sure u wont have any problems using your new spoons good luck and good fishing....

Lots of action reported in the mouth of Altimiter Creek though. Looks like the Walleyes are well on their way out to the main lake. Water was down 5 feet from the same week(2nd of the season)of last year. Lots of fish on the move, Find 'em one day then not much from that spot for the rest of the week. Lots of Pike but enough Walleyes to eat every day, plenty of slot fish & quite a few between 4 -5 lbs. Water is warm for this time of year, checked a few places & it was all @ 58 deg. Largest Walley was 26""-4.9 lbs, Pike 38""--14.5 lbs. A nice surprise was 5 healthy Smallies. A first for me, although a boatmate landed a big one in 2001. biggest chalenge was navigating the low water channels. Too many of our familliar spots were too shallow to get to. lots of info for future years though."

531518,Guest,2003-06-02 11:55:00,0,"Just got back from Lac Seul. The fishing was awesome. We caught loads of nice Walleye with the biggest being 29 1/2"". Lots of nice slot fish. Found good action on main lake with some fish still picked up in transistion areas. Best bite on jig and minnow. Caught two big pike (36"" 38"")and several others while Walleye fishing also got some bonus smallies....Watch for rocks we towed in one boat that lost its bottom unit...sad day for them."
