530483,Dan,2003-05-03 16:17:00,325,My wife and I want to plan a trip to Canada this year. We do a lot of Bass and Crappie fishing at home but my wife wants to go North and catch a large Pike. We live in the Northwest part of Illinois and would like to go to Ontario. Would appreciatte it if you Canada experts could tell me of a Lake that we can drive to that could yield some good Pike fishing for us. She would love to catch a 15lb plus Pike...Thanks Dan & Sandy

Many other lakes in the area produce well too. The big ones tend to hang around reed beds that are close to deep drop offs, suick's work well."
530487,Guest,2003-05-03 18:55:00,0,Try Caribou Lake in Armstrong. This lake is loaded with BIG pike and nice walleye that will keep you busy non-stop.
530488,Guest,2003-05-03 19:39:00,0,"Try Wabagon/Dinorwi, you can catch smallmouth bass, pike, muskie and walleye there. I really like fishing pike there as Dinorwic and the adjacent lakes are shallow lakes with lots of wild rice and weedy bays that tend to hold a lot of pike. Top water plugs, spinners and spoons all work well for pike there."

530491,Guest,2003-05-30 06:33:00,0,Oh boy..My favorite fish to fish for.I ply Lake of the Woods. Look into http://www.ashrapidslodge.com if you are looking for large pike. The best time I would suggest too if possible would be in August. I know spots their where they rang from 15 lbs and up. Like to 20 lbs on a consistant basis. Right now they have been catching good northern in the 15lb average in a few spots.
