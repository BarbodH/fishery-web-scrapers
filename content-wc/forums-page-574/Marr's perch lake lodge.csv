They were nice enough to let us stay the one night. The cabin we stayed in was new prefab, very large, very clean. People owned the place were very nice ! Also seem to have a lot of long timers as guest. Never went back because we travel through Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota now. I not sure I would go all that way for pike, bass, and walleye. Got to have a shot at some muskies ! Bob"

Very nice cabins on the water. Each year there's new upgrades to the camp. We've only done housekeeping but they offer the american plan as well. We fish mainly walleye and also catch a good number of northern and smallmouth. Not a lot of lunkers but good quantity by our standards, i.e. a few 100+ walleye days on jig & minnow. The chain of lakes have great structure, very limited shoreline dwellings and, after a few pointers, comparatively easy to navigate without a guide. In the past we've fished LOW, Minaki.... but this system works for us. Never been to Lac Seul. We always fish in the fall = few bugs and very few boats. Its not unusual to see perhaps only 2 or 3 other boats a day in the fall. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions. [email protected] Ken"
