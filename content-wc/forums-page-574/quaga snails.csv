1111560,alanexpup,2009-06-06 22:38:00,278,HI. I am just wondering what canada is doing to stop the quaga snail from getting into canada? I see they are all over the midwest and now they are out here in lake mead. it seems the only sure way is to dunk the boat and tow vehicle in a poison bath and run the engine and everthing else that water gets into. oh well just wondering. I was going to take my boat to canada and dont want too much of a hassle. thanks.
