I've never been to Canada fishing, and I am trying to find some place to go, but not really sure where to go. Any information would be helpful.Thanks for the info. I have no idea where to go for our first trip. My husband used to go to Lake of the Woods as a child, but his brother says that the area is all fished out. I would like to go where the meals are cooked, but we can do shore lunches. Would also like a place that has electrical and indoor plumbing. Again, thanks for all of your help. I was completely overwhelmed when searching for a place, as there are soooo many."

The resorts listed above are all good, but the one we stay at is Whitewing Resort by Ear Falls - the grounds are well kept, the cabins are modern and well maintained and they do have the option of an american plan.Good luck wherever you go!"
