1111778,Baitslinger,2009-06-07 19:59:00,93,"Travelling to Ontario from Montana for the annual walleye fix in late June. We have a cooler with about 50 pounds of frozen elk meat that is being taken to Wisconsin AFTER the canadian walleye trip ends. I need to find a place to leave the frozen meat for a week on the US side of the border while we are in camp. Need to drop it off on a thursday evening, and pick it up the following friday afternoon as we head south.Anyone have any good leads (name and or phone number) on a meat processor or locker plant that would rent out some freezer space for a week in or near international falls?"
