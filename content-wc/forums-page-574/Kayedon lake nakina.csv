In 2006 we caught and released in excess of 1500 fish. This year near 500. I contribute this to high water 2/3' above normal and VERY bad weather. Only one day did air temp exceed water temps. Water temps were in the high 40's. Lost one complete day of fishing due to 30/40 mph winds, 2/3' waves and blowing snow. It rained or snowed on us every day we were at Kayedon. Largest pike 42"" caught the last day and walleye of 21.25 inches. Many eyes in excess of 18"". Cabins, air service, boats, & moters top notch as usual."
