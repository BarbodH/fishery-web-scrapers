Just about any long points/ islands in the wind can harbor fish that time of year. If this year shapes up like last year ( similar unstable weather patterns and late spring) the fish will be scattered and you will need to run and gun . I will be in the area from June 23 - July 4. best regards, JBP"
1111044,bensen,2009-06-04 21:56:00,155,I am going with a group to Lac Seul on June 12. We plan on parking the house boat on Taylor Island like always. Can anyone tell me where there is a good spot to go when out in the middle of the lake already? We fish Walleye only. Thanks.
1111055,Guest,2009-06-05 01:24:00,0,Where is Taylor island?
1111083,Guest,2009-06-05 07:27:00,0,"Ogema, Bear Island, Bananna Island......pretty much any wind driven point"
1111125,jswinter40,2009-06-05 08:53:00,127,"I am not sure what you mean when you say good spot to go when in the middle of the lake?? If you mean to find walleyes then you must know some being you sound like you have been to Taylor Island before. But wind blown points and islands are always good. BUt windy narrows, pine point, mcleans narrows, spider island, or drive up to bear narrows area. All good spots especially if the wind is right. good luck, houseboats are a blast. I will be up there starting on June 24th, no houseboat this year though."
1111127,jswinter40,2009-06-05 08:56:00,127,"East central/northeast portion of Lac Suel. No resorts very close at all, mostly fished by houseboats, boat in fisherman, or guides."
1111194,Steve of Madison,2009-06-05 11:15:00,230,"Sorry, but is that south of Windigo/Manitoba/Stoney Point areas? I don't find them on my map."
1111203,Guest,2009-06-05 12:03:00,0,"Taylor island is where the current/flow changes, as do the navigational markers. South of Taylor, it's left of green and right of red going upstream. Still going upstream, ""after"" Taylor, it's left of red and right of green."
1111397,Steve of Madison,2009-06-06 07:57:00,230,"Sorry again, my map doesn't show current direction. HUH!"
1111417,Guest,2009-06-06 09:58:00,0,"From manitoba point, head south to windigo point, then go east across main basin until you hit the narrows past wesely point. go north to pine point, head east to windy narrows, go southeast thru macCleans narrows and you'll run into taylor island. it has a monument on the nw corner."
1111418,Guest,2009-06-06 10:01:00,0,"you can also go to trakmaps.com and search lac seul. click on southwest map and use the zoom feature to familiarize yourself to the location you know, you can drag the map up/down or across. the go back to search and get on the southeast map and do the same thing."
