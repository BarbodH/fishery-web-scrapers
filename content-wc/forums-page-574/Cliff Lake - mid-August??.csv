This year my son and I are going back for a 2nd trip during the second week in August. Anyone have tips on jigging some lakers up from the depths? I'm assuming an assortment of larger jigging spoons or big jig/plastic combos might work. Also, need tips on locations preferred by the trout in mid-summer. We'll be in my boat with the Lowrance, but thanks for any help in eliminating areas that will clearly be nonproductive at that time.Thanks in advance........."
1112041,v-bay gord,2009-06-08 15:46:00,3168,I would check out the deepest section of the lake first. Using your locator you should be able to key in on fish and depths......any suspended fish etc. Generally some of the bigger trout will be on or near the bottom with others suspended at varying depths. Two methods I would use to catch them......firstly if they seem scattered you may need to cover some ground by trolling. A three way swivel setup with 4-6 oz of lead (depending on your speed and line diameter) and some thin flutter spoons (ie Sutton spoons) or thin Doctor spoons would work. You can backtroll or slowly forward troll. If you locate some concentrations of fish you can vertically jig them with jigging spoons. They don't have to be large and you can use an ordinary walleye rod to fish this way. A good one that I have had success with is the Little Cleo spoon in blue and silver. Use the wind to drift and jig to cover some ground as well. A white jig is also a productive method.......either a bucktail jig or tipped with minnow or plastic.

1112191,sptrix,2009-06-09 06:43:00,175,"I've not fished Cliff Lake, but we have found good success on various lakes by seeking out structure that emerges from deep water. Typically if you can find a hump that comes out of at least 90' of water and peaks anywhere from 25'-50', you should find trout. Also, if you can see clouds of baitfish on the sides of those humps, there will absolutely be trout there.With respect to fishing for them . . . Downriggers, of course, work well for controlling depth, etc. But I prefer to use in-line sinkers (6-9 oz) and troll large crankbaits (we've had our best luck with anything with silver, blue or purple) right into the side of those humps (oftentimes the humps are clay so you don't get hung up too often). When your crankbaits slam into the structure, hold on. If you can really dial in exactly where the fish are on the hump, get your anchor away from them and float directly over the top of 'em, then it's worth jigging. We use 1 oz - 2 oz bucktails from www.slevad.com. My best color has been white and blue, but my fishing partner swears by green and white. It probably doesn't matter. Just be aggressive with your jigging pattern and it seems to trigger strikes better than a non-aggressive approach. If you can tip the jig with sucker belly, all the better. If not, we've had good success with white shad bodies.Good luck.Steve"
