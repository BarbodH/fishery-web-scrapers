The fish are moving slow and want the minnow right on the bottom. They don't want to run with it. Friday night I went fishing on my own becuase my parents wanted to get some painting done in between the rain. When I hooked into a small walleye I as reeling it in and all of the sudden my pole went strait down. At first I didn't know what happened but when I got it up beside the boat I saw a pike had latched on to my walleye. The pike got away becuase I couldn't net the fish on my own. The pike got away with my walleye. It is ilegal to keep a fish caught on a game fish in case anyone didn't know this. I didn't want to keep the pike but I did want to get a measurmet. It would have been my 45 min. I had boated 25 walleye and would have stayed out longer but I only took 30 minnows with me. I had a good night. Other guys fishing reports were doing good. One group (2 guys) caught an average 80 fish a day. We know they arn't lying becuase they bought about 60 dozen minnows. They Did tell me something interesting, they tried using ice fishing poles with a ice fishing jig minnow for a new twist. They were having fun with the light action fishing equitment. Yes it was cold but not ice. Blackflys Are getting thicker and are biting now. Mosquitoes arn't bad though. We haven't seen many but they will be here. The blueberries are blosming. The mayflies are still small, brown, and few the large green haven't started. The dragonflies still arn't hatching and we need them to get rid the blackflies. Last week I had i Nice pike at the falls that i lost along with my red hook. This week one of our guest caught a 31 inch pike and found a red hook in his mouth,my red hook. I told him that it was my hook from last week. He relesed the fish so I can try again.A trophy fish is to valuable to only be caught once Youngcanadianguide"

Not only am I a fishing guide in training I am also in training for the bear hunts. They were friday bears. This means that we worked all week to try to get the big bear in early enough but we couldn't. So they shot the secondary bear we had for them. The 2 guys that had to settle for smaller bear shot theres in 45 minutes after we set them. They were still happy even though their bears only weighed around 160 pounds. I was happy becuase I got to go help track, field dress the bear, and take the pictures. Nobody has ever left our camp without shooting a bear but sadly it will hapen some day and my dad will feel bad for whoever it is. Happy Hunting. YOUNGCANADIANGUIDE"

I trust you will have them eradicated from the entire region by the time I arrive.Seriously, you guys just haven't had any stretch of warm weather yet, have you? This usually thins out the flies and thickens the mosquitoes, no?"
