1111326,Guest,2009-06-05 20:14:00,0,I don't know the law but common sense would tell me you can't cut down trees regardless of what it is for. If the trees are already down and dead I doubt it would be an issue.
1111465,Beechnut,2009-06-06 14:59:00,8,"That's pretty much what I was thinking as well, I'm just trying to avoid any headaches on my trip. Has Anyone had any experience with the MNR and this issue??"
1111483,lund rebel,2009-06-06 16:25:00,138,"As far as I know camping on Crown land is not legal, so I wouldn't go clearing any land, as far as fire wood we always have cut deadfall."
1111492,v-bay gord,2009-06-06 17:05:00,3168,Do a Google search for the MNR District office closest to the area you are going. Give them a call and pose those questions.
1111514,youngcanadianguide,2009-06-06 19:48:00,60,Hey BeechnutIt is ilegal to cut down trees on crown ground as is it ilegal to clear a campsite. You can trim the branches of a tree but you can't cut it down. However it is not ilegal to cut up the dead trees around. The MNR charges us as camp owners to cut wood. We are only allowed to cut the down trees. These are the rules for the Chapleau/Wawa area.Hope this helps. Youngcanadianguide
