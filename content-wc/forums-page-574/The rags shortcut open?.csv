I found a web site where they show stats on water levels for Lac Seul. As of 5/23 the water level report from Hudson was showing 1168 ft elevation. I am going in 11 more days! WOOHOO!!!! Lookout Wallies!"
1107900,rnnonmt,2009-05-25 13:14:00,992,"http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.htmlOn the Left side of the page click the ""Lac Seul Graph"" under the heading ""Water Levels & Flows Primary Sites""As of May 25 2009 the Hudson area level is just about 1168 ft elevation and the historical graph for end of June 2008 (last years trip time)was at 1171-ish ft elevation. Last years trip my gps was showing 1171 ft elevation at the rags location."
1107902,rnnonmt,2009-05-25 13:18:00,992,Just spoke with LSFL....Rags arent open yet but hopefully it will be soon. Waether for the next 10 days is showing 10-30% chance rain...probably not enough.
1107990,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-05-25 19:27:00,100,"I am currently running the rags and shortcut, and pelican rapids wide open with a 21 ft/150...so are others. I passed a houseboat in the shortcut. The water of Seul is rising daily, all tributaries are very high and don't crest until mid June. I'm sure that in 11 days the houseboats will be running the rags too.The water levels should be average or above all season...unless they crank the Dam wide open again..."
