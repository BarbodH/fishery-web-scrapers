1105332,GatorGuy,2009-05-15 18:29:00,15,I have but I live here. LOL
1105372,adempsey,2009-05-16 01:11:00,963,"Lol. Drinking in the boat isn't really worth it. Although I haven't had the privilege of going to jail for drinking and operating a motorized vehicle, it really seems to me a slap on the wrist. They do seem to make a big deal of it, but ultimately it doesn't seem like much happens if you get caught drinking and driving a car. So, I doubt doing so in a boat would amount to much. Maybe a fine, but I doubt any jail time."
1105394,1shooter,2009-05-16 06:57:00,1493,Why would you even chance it? Don't get me wrong our group likes to drink our beer but there is plenty of time after the fishing is done.
1105404,JAY221,2009-05-16 07:51:00,877,"My question is what do you have to do to get arrested? 3 times the limit on fish or fishing out of season or what? Later, Jay"
1105449,Obabikon,2009-05-16 11:14:00,2370,"Smuggling drugs or firearms would probably do it. I've never heard of someone getting arrested... I did hear a story of them taking someone's boat, because the fines that the guy had accumulated were like 5,000 bucks. I can't say it's true or not, just a story I heard. Dropped the guy off at the dock, and impounded his boat."
1105480,Jimmy Jig,2009-05-16 15:12:00,1905,"Jay, you could go into a bank in Canada to exchange some money with a pistol stuck in your belt......"
1111375,Jimmysjigs,2009-06-06 06:20:00,1,"You can't drink and drive in Canada. You will get arrested.You can't drive a car, boat, or fly a plane and expect to get away with it. You might not loose your drivers license if you have alot of cash for expensive laywers, but all that would be more expensive than your trip. Is it really worth it? Plenty of time for beer when the fishings done."
1112002,Guest,2009-06-08 13:20:00,0,Anyone arrested for DUI goes to jail if you are a non resident. The judge will decide what guarantee you need to put up and when you will be released. You could spend several days in jail if you are arrested on a weekend. They are looking at impounding vehicles and equipment now for drunk driving.
