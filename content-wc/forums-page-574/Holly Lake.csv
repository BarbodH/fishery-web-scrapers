1111569,J.Iverson,2009-06-06 23:36:00,64,"thanks. Dug up a couple posts from 5-6 years ago, but I'm definately not computer savvy. Not much info out there about Holly. We have fished with NWO now for 14 trips, I have total confidence with Vic and the crew, just can't find much about this lake. Now that we travel with the little ones I wanted to come ""prepared"". Can't wait!"
