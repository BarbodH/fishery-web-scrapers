1109785,drydock,2009-06-01 10:03:00,10,Can anyone tell me if crossing the border with a double edged knife like the leech lake knife is a problem. I have heard that it can be. Any advise?
1109800,Fishoil,2009-06-01 10:58:00,1277,I've always taken mine and have never been asked about it. It's obviously a fillet knife so I don't see why there would be a problem. I've crossed in both directions at Pigeon River and International Falls already this year and many times in the past without anyone asking about fillet knifes.

1109975,Fishoil,2009-06-01 20:24:00,1277,"I have a flare pistol on board and have never been asked about it in the 20 years I've been going to Ontario. I guess I never thought about it, but I suppose it could be considered a handgun."
1110146,cast_and_blast,2009-06-02 08:40:00,1098,It's a fillet knife. I've been taking mine to Canada twice per year for many years - no worries. Scott
1111330,JinxCanada,2009-06-05 20:35:00,1306,"please see the Criminal Code of Canada for specifics as to which knives would be illegal, but to make it simple for you i'll break it down.it is illegal to possess:butterfly knives (or any knife that opens by centrifugal force)switch blades knives (or any knife that opens by depressing a button to release a spring loaded blade)any knife which has a handle perpendicular to the blade (push daggers, constant companions such as in a belt buckle etc)any knife which has spikes on it or on the handle (same as push dagger)knives concealed within inoccuous objects such as a brush (handle pulls out to be a knife plastic or otherwise) swords concealed within a cane for example as well.there are NO restrictions on length of blade, double edged, **** you can bring a sword with ya if you want. it is fine and dandy.some other prohibited weapons that will get you arrested when crossing into Canada:stun guns/tasers of any kindthrowing starsnun chaku (nun chucks)morning star (dunno why you'd have one but there ya go)pepper spray or mace etc. i hope this helps"
