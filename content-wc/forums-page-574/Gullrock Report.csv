This is the first time I have caught males that are still milking. Fished liked minnows, the crawler bite was a little slower. We did get some females towards the end of the week. Several northern over 40"". The water temp was still in the upper 40's. We had frost several mornings. Numbers of fish was about the same as the past several years."
