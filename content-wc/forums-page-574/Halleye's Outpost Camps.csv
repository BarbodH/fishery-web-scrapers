I have been going to the All Canada shows and a couple of camps looked good and I wanted some opinions. First of all, we are looking for walleye/northern fishing. Smallies OK too. Don't have to be wall hangers but want action with the chance of a trophy. We also want a remote camp where we are the only group on the system. The Halley's Outpost camps seem to fit the bill. The log cabins look unbelievable (and modern)and there are several options that have the target species were looking for. Not too worried about the price because we are all happy just to be above ground. This company seemed to have everything were looking for. Nice cabins, fishing smaller systems, target species, etc. Any comments good or bad.? The Long Lake Outpost specifically looked especially good. Thanks again Mully"

I have fished that area several times on Moar Lake and Sharpstone (Norse Lodge - which is out of business due to health problems of the owner). This fishing was unbelievable up there. Best lakes I have ever been to in Canada for both quality Walleye and Pike in the same lake."

Later got married and took the family there when it was owned by Ashambie Outfitters. Went again in '96 with the guys. Can't vouch for it now obviously but it was the best lake I had ever fished when we were there. I must say no trophys but Wallys, northern and smallies in abundance. I don't think they are the only outfitters on Salveson now however. You may want to check that."

Gene, Wanda, Chris, Amber... they are all great to deal with! I have seen a couple of their outposts and they are top notch. I really dont think that you can go wrong with Halley's. Leaving for Caribou Falls tomorrow for a week!"
1111407,Mully,2009-06-06 08:44:00,145,"Thanks for the information. The outpost camps seen incredible with the solitute of being the only outpost on the lake with the facilities which appear top notch. We also wanted to fish smaller systems that you can find fish easily and even find places to fish in poor weather. I have fished Eagle Lake and Lac Seul and sometimes I had long runs to find fish or get back in a storm. We don't want to have to travel on the water as much. Thanks again and if there are any more info, keep it coming. Mully"
