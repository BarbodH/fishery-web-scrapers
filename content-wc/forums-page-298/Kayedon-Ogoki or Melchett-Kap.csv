3430298,Mike Borger,2015-01-08 17:46:00,1554,Don't think you could go wrong with either but I'd choose Kayedon/Ogoki.I love fishing big water.
3431010,onetimedave,2015-01-09 06:07:00,502,I have fished all the above except Ogoki. PM me for more info.
3431362,adempsey,2015-01-09 08:19:00,963,"I've never been to either lake system and would love a chance to go to either. Definitely a difficult choice. However, if I were making that decision, I'd probably go to Kayedon since there is the potential of Brook Trout. Of course, not sure what that would be like in July. Other than that, all the positives and negatives seem equal to me."
3431490,oleJoe,2015-01-09 09:12:00,114,"Hands down I would choose Melchett-Kap. Its easy fishing with numbers of walleye between 16"" to 22"" and a good chance to get a pike over 40"". You won't get lost on the lake and very few hazards. You probably can't go wrong with either. Just what you would prefer to fish. What you need to do is just go, you won't be sorry."

We just went slow thru the skinny water in th inlet outlet areas. great fishing. Melchett is also good fishing ;You can also experince low water here but same thing slow thru skinny water when going into and out of the lakes .We have caught nice walleye here.The largest pike around 40 in.Any questions drop me a email. onetimedave is also a good source. Great fishing both places! WE fished Kayedon the last week of July. Melchett in July and Sept and Oct."
