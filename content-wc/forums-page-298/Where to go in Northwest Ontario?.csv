3302386,jveri,2014-11-12 13:52:00,70,"Check out Mattice Lake Outfitters, www.walleye.ca. Top notch operation run by Don and Annette, fishing and accommodations are awesome."
3358674,Fish Finder,2014-12-10 22:05:00,13,"I would recommend Whitewing Resort on Lac Suel. I have been fishing Lac Suel since 81 and have always caught fish. Dave and Bobbie run a first rate clean resort in my book with modern cabins and good equipment. I believe its the only one in the area that has a restaurant and bar as well. It's worth your while to look them up. If not, stop in while your up and take a look for yourself! www.whitewingresort.com Good Luck fishing!"

3364050,WalleyeWally28,2014-12-13 09:18:00,298,I second Whitewing. My wife and I have fished out of Whitewing for the past 12 years and really enjoy it. Dave and Bobbie run a great camp and keep it exceptionally well maintained. For the last three years our Grandson has been with us and calls it his home away from home.

3425466,kcguy68,2015-01-06 22:30:00,51,"South Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake is absolutely fantastic.. Prime spot on the lake, great fishing, and Gord is the best. I would suggest packing a pair of big pants for the trip home because you will eat very well. Can not say enough good things about this place. Looking forward to heading up ther again in 2015."

3429258,Steve Ediger,2015-01-08 11:22:00,97,"I would suggest a call to Lac Seul Lodge. You may have a hard time getting in, but if you do I am sure you will enjoy your stay. I have made over thirty trips there and have enjoyed every one of them. They have very clean and nice modern cabins and a first rate fleet of Lund boats if you need to rent one. Plenty of great fishing close to camp or you can take trips to McKenzie Bay, South Inlet, Sunlight & Broad Lakes just to name a few. Rod and Lorita will take good care of you."
3429346,Mike Kansas,2015-01-08 11:39:00,1463,We have had a group going to Lac Seul Lodge for over 30 years. I too would say that it is great but hard to get in because of so many repeat customers. Mike Kansas
3293954,dan lollar,2014-11-08 17:58:00,10,"Need some honest advice. I have been going to Ontario yearly from Toledo for the last 12 years, mostly north of Sudbury and Beardmore area. I am 56 and have a wife and daughter and don't want to trailer boats and frankly, am tired of working all day for a few pike and walleye. Therefore, I want to try the Dryden/Lac Suel area. Obviously, looking for modern cabin, decent owners and lots of fish. I want to catch a volume of fish, walleye, perch, pike, bass, crappie, not out for trophy only. I can be happy catching perch or 15 inch walleye. I have looked into Dinorick and Wabigoon (Huber's, Pine Sunset, Merkle's) and Lac Suel (Fisherman's Cove, Onaway, Gold Pine). I want a drive to lodge where I can walk down to the boat, go out and catch fish. I am willing to go to Lac Suel, Souix Lookout, Dryden or Eagle lake. Any help will be appreciated on area and Camps. If you don't want to post, my e-mail is [email protected]. Thanks all."
3294042,bergsh,2014-11-08 18:11:00,183,A bit further up the road but can't really go wrong with Red Lake or Gull Rock. Walleye factories for sure.
3294082,SinOrSwim,2014-11-08 18:18:00,1528,If you are taking the wife Onaway has fantastic cabins.

3295122,CKM,2014-11-09 08:00:00,3836,one year we drove to Red Lake and then flew into Savant lake. It's a huge lake. They have lake trout. But man we caught many nice walleyes. Not the best trip for numbers that I've had to Canada but good size.
3299730,gmakara,2014-11-11 11:31:00,2,"Check out www.southshorelodge.com on Eagle Lake in the Dryden area. This gem produces the eyes. Fall 2013, five anglers boated a confirmed 1,300 walleye in 4 days of fishing, and Eagle is only 100 miles north of the border and a drive to. In 2012 they caught soooo many fish they decided to bring clickers for 2014 so the numbers are 100% accurate, and in fact they decided to stop walleye fishing at 1,300 and chased muskies for the reminder of their last day. Problem is the counting became an obsession... the clickers are staying home for 2015. Best walleye fishing is July through September for numbers, and you will still catch some nice trophies but the consistent pig fishing is Spring."
3300706,paulie,2014-11-11 19:05:00,2337,Beardmore?? Why aren't you just hammering the fish on Nipigon?
