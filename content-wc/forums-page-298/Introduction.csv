3425506,Bayou,2015-01-06 23:32:00,52,"Hello everybody, just wanted to introduce myself as I've been lurking here quite a bit. I'm from Ohio and have been on 6 or 7 fly ins with a couple drive ins as well. I've also did the Boundary Waters and while unique and beautiful, you can keep the canoes. I'm in the middle or hopefully the end of picking this years trip and may have a few questions. Seems like a lot of places have filled their cabins, economy must be on the up turn. Thanks, Bill"

As a relative newbie and especially a novice fisherman, I can certainly confirm the previous posts regarding how generous the posters on this site are. I can't imagine how I'd have made some of the recent decisions I've faced including camps, boats and electronics without the incredible generosity of posters on this site. I look forward to reading your future posts."
