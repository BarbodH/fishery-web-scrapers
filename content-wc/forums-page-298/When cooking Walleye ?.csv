3407346,rockrunner,2014-12-30 19:11:00,205,"I don't know , because I have never let the canola oil get up to 350-375 degrees but would ""BREAD CRUMBS"" not burn at these temps ? I do cook French Fries though at 400 degrees."
3431938,Bill Krejca,2015-01-09 11:53:00,6107,"I fry by bringing temp up to 375, then put in the fillets .It is interesting to observe the temp drop after the fish are put in, drops maybe to 340 or so,in my iron fry pan. After a turn and short wait,I remove the cooked fish. Again, have to wait a little for temp to go back to 375, then repeat. I would be cautious pouring in anything except perhaps additional oil, when needed. An acquaintance was severely burned by dropping in ice crusted french fries, causing the hot oil to more or less explode. Bill"
3432258,packpro,2015-01-09 15:11:00,695,"We deep fry, but learned the hard way that it is too hard to get the oil to temp (350F-375F) if you use too much oil in the pot. Better to just have enough in there to cover the filets and add as need. If you keep the oil at the right temp very little will get absorbed in the batter/breading. Crisp on the outside, hot and tasty on the inside."
3433098,ohiojmj,2015-01-10 06:35:00,1262,"Plug in electric deep fryer, add canola oil, set to 375. A good 1800 watt fryer can handle a good size load of walleye or fries. I gave up burning oil on propane burner. Never considered bringing the kitchen out on the lake."
3433146,LLewellin,2015-01-10 07:00:00,1790,"Back in the day, early 90's, when I sold fryer shorting to restaurants the ideal temp for deep frying was 375 and not going lower than 325. Tips that I remember: 1) Don't over load the fryer with product, temp will severely drop well below 325 and absorption of oil will increase. 2) Never poor product straight from the bag, ice crystals and crumbs dropped in the oil will break down the oil much much faster and can created a potential dangerous situation if to much ice is dropped in at one time. Plus once again oil temp will drop accordingly. 3) Use a thermometer all the time and keep temp between 325-375 if possible. I prefer a digital type thermometer from Cooper brand. 4) Filter and skim as much loose particles from the oil as soon as possible. 5) Store oil in a covered container, O2 is not so good for the oil for long periods of time. Well thats what I remember hope it helps."
3433690,rockrunner,2015-01-10 11:19:00,205,"Thanks for the replays guys. I will try cooking fish at 375 degrees. I'm not feeling it but will try. I never bled out my walleye until three years ago and that works fantastic. Which was a great tip from this site and I'm thankful for that. I won't be frying until May long weekend. Lol. I do fry French fries though at 400 degrees and they come out great. I will also add that from our experiences in frying fresh potatoes cut into French fries. The Best potatoe is the Red Potatoes, that's what we decided is the best after trying several different kinds. Anyone have a favourite type of potatoes ?"
3401434,rockrunner,2014-12-28 22:50:00,205,"Hey guys quick question. When frying Walleye do any of you use a thermometer ? I use a thermometer faithfully and have noticed different temps when pan frying and deep frying. I will add, this is when the fillets are dipped in egg and then placed in Italian ""Bread Crumbs"". Two methods I use. One method is with my 17"" Lodge Logic cast iron skillet over a Propane style burner you would deep fry a turkey over. When I use this method I cook at 225-245 degrees. Method number two is straight up deep frying with a pot and basket at 315 degrees. I find I use less heat when the fillets are closer to the pan and more heat when using a larger quantity of oil in a pot and the fillets tend to roll around in the oil. Are these ""Temps"" in the ball park in your experiences ? Also what temp do you fry at when using ""Batter"" ?I might add... When my buddy is frying Walleye he just pours beer into the oil to see if it's ready."
3401474,michigan walleye guy,2014-12-29 00:01:00,95,"An unsophisticated, but effective, method for determining when oil is at the right temp. is to drop a sulfur match into the oil. Sulfur ignites at 350 degrees, so when the match ignites, you're ready to cook fish! (fish the match out of the oil first) Although some would say that the oil should be 375 degrees. I never use a thermometer, and this method works great for me. The key at this point is to be able to keep the oil from getting too hot, or cooling too much."
3401490,Juls,2014-12-29 01:06:00,13414,"350-360 degrees here. Doesn't take long to cook fish, so to get that golden crispy outside in the time it takes to cook the fish (without over cooking it), you need to use hot oil."
3401498,Da' Walleye Assassun,2014-12-29 01:07:00,358,When pan frying I toss a small piece of bread in the oil. If the bread sizzles the oil is ready.
3401769,Guest,2014-12-29 07:40:00,0,"Oil frying 350 on battered fish, but most of mine I egg dip,season with crushed saltine cracker and a little shore lunch and fry on medium heat in Butter."
3401825,Fishoil,2014-12-29 07:59:00,1277,"When deep frying I keep the oil between 350 and 375 if possible. Below that and the fillets come out greasy, above and they sometimes get to dark before they're cooked through. When pan frying I don't use a thermometer, I drop a piece of breading in when I think the oil is ready. If it sizzles and turns brown quickly I put the fish in and adjust heat depending on how fast they fry. Pan frying is something you'll only get good at with experience but I think the fish taste better and less greasy than deep frying."
3402209,Kansas Bound,2014-12-29 09:58:00,152,I saw someone on here recommend using popcorn to tell when the oil is ready. It has been working for me.
3402265,Golden Eagle,2014-12-29 10:13:00,2642,Same here. Attempt to maintain temperature between 350 F. and 375 F. Doing only a few fillets at a time helps. Straining my peanut oil allows me to use the same oil for a dozen or so meals. Cleaning it a couple of times by cooking French fries helps. Allowing oil to get too hot is a deal breaker.
3402458,dkrusin,2014-12-29 11:26:00,97,"We always carry one of those infared temp guns (about 20 bucks at NAPA) to check wheel bearing on the way to Canada. This year we used it to check oil temp at shore lunch, worked great. Like most said 350 to 370 and don't over load the grease with too many fillets. Temp will drop too much and you'll have greasy fish.Our secret breading mix...3 parts ""Shorelunch"", 2 parts ""Zataran"" and 1 part ""Andys Red"" and a little garlic."
3406602,3 Z's,2014-12-30 14:56:00,133,Also best to let your oil come back up to temperature after you remove a cooked batch.
