3433674,Mike Borger,2015-01-10 11:18:00,1554,"Mentioned to you already, but I'll say it again, Slate Falls Outposts based out of Sioux Lookout. Verne will give you a very good discount for kids and he's a great outfitter.Perhaps there's some other Walleye Central folk who can chime in about Slate Falls."
3434114,maddogg,2015-01-10 14:36:00,178,We used Verne for decades. You won't be disappointed. Great guy great service.
3434770,GNO,2015-01-10 20:00:00,153,CFO will give you very good service and has good equipment.

Ended up using John at Red Pine after Verne sold those cabins to John but you will not find a better outfitter than Verne. I think in the 17 to 20 years we have been going up (we drive in now), Verne has been the best and most consistent outfitter we ever had. He doesn't have weight limits either as long as you work with him. He will mock the crap out of you LOL but will fly it in later."
