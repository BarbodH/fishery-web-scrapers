3421938,forgop,2015-01-05 15:11:00,880,"http://do-it-yourself.viralnova.com/toilet-paper-hack/I attempted the shore lunch last summer and ran into some hassles. Oil easily gets too hot, fire took a long time to get going even with help of some kerosene, you name it. I'd just look for some sort of ""stand"" to sit the skillet on, but will certainly give it a try. I think it's quite possible that more than 1 can may be necessary, but seems like a quicker way to do the cooking and back in the boat. I'd try it now, but maybe would be better when its not near 0 degrees out. What say you?"

Tried closing the page and it kept opening like 5 times. **So be careful with that link**That said, we take the propane fish cooker from camp. PUt in a garbage bag so it doesn't get all messy. Cooking is simple. Temp control etc."

3422154,Fishoil,2015-01-05 16:26:00,1277,A group of my relatives used to do that to stay warm in their deer blinds until one of them got severely burned and spent several days in the hospital burn unit. DON'T DO IT!!!
3426378,roscoe33,2015-01-07 10:32:00,653,"Keep it simple. A small propane camp stove, a pan, a stick of butter. No need to deep fry, just pan fry. Quick, easy, clean up is a breeze, taste the fish for what it is, instead of a gob of seasoned breading and oil. You can put some potatoes, onion, corn, in the pan at the cabin. Cook them, then remove them and cook the fish in the same pan. just my opinion."
3427018,Fishoil,2015-01-07 14:35:00,1277,"For a small group I use my Coleman stove and a cast iron fry pan that fits on it. For the larger groups I take a 20lb LP can, the burner from my deep fryer, and a large cast iron pan. I can fry fillets in that pan almost as fast as I can deep fry them and they taste a whole lot better."
3427330,ohiojmj,2015-01-07 16:58:00,1262,"We keep it simpler; fry fish at camp every evening, eat cold pre-made cold cut subs or a cold walleye or pike sandwich at lunch time, with or without a shore. Ok, we occasionally stop on shore for a little #2 duty, to brew a pot of coffee, or to explore for blue berries, but we go to Canada to fish primarily to we are ready to drop..."

3431578,bigwalleye1,2015-01-09 09:23:00,2632,"Does sound interesting, but I'm with Johnboat. I'll watch from a distance. We've always carried an LP bottle and burner. It's clean, safe, and when the fire's out, it's out."
