Fishing was slow, numbers we caught were small--13""-14"" walleyes...Now, with that being said our group pulled out a 30"", 29"", 28"" over the years but they were few and far between. Those fish were caught on Edwards and not the other lakes in chain. It does have musky so that helps but I do not miss the place and will never go back. Just my opinion and my preference and that's it. I have found much better fishing further north in red lake area and choose to go there. Take it for what its worth."

3428034,IAWally,2015-01-07 23:43:00,38,We have stayed at KCs landing the last 5 years and the fishing gets better every year both size and numbers. The Clarks are great host with outstanding accommodations. I am planning two more trips this year. You can find better fishing but we catch enough to keep us going back. One of the things we like it not many other boats you wont have someone come push you off your spot.
