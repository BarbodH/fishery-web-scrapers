3431146,walleye22,2015-01-09 06:52:00,59,fisherman ted....sent you a PM.
3431394,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-09 08:26:00,461,"A couple of comments on some of the previous responses. I completely disagree with the mortgage comment. You can hold a mortgage and be successful. If you could not make any money with a mortgage then you wouldn't carry that debt when you bought it. I am talking about new purchases here. One of the very first things you do when purchasing a lodge (along with your realtor and accountant) is pull financials and see what your carrying costs are as compared to past and more importantly projected revenue. If you cannot carry that debt load and still make a profit (as defined by the buyer) the sale is dead in the water. Think about it. When you buy a house your banker has to make sure you have the money to pay the mortgage and you have to know you can feed your family. If that revenue can't sustain the mortgage then guess what happens....the sale price drops until someone (the buyer) feels comfortable that you can make it successful with the new numbers. That sale price is largely based on revenue (in reality there are two sale types, asset sale versus share and it is usually a combination of the two). You can have a wonderful lodge with $1 million worth of boats and $250,000 cabins but if your revenue can't support that asset value then the price won't either. Revenue is the driver here. That is why when the recession hit and the US dollar collapsed lodge prices collapsed. At the end of the day this is a business. Without profit banks don't give loans, my kids don't eat..... I know of very few new acquisitions where they were paid 100% in cash and run as a business. Maybe 1 in the last few years in my area. Like any business you finance the acquisition and carry debt. That simple. Now yes, if by some miracle you are able to inherit a camp for nothing and not carry any mortgage you could, and I stress could have a nice advantage over others. If you are a very inexpensive camp its probably a wash as your mortgage would have been small. But it its worth millions then sure, like any business your expenses are cut significantly. However a few things on this subject. One, any advantage you had would just be price sensitivity. But here is a tip. If your lodge was worth millions and you had NO mortgage payment you would very likely be going after a much higher end clientele, one that is much less sensitive to prices to begin with. If your fishing still sucked, you didn't know how to market or others had this same low or no mortgage then you still need to be on your game. Just because you don't have a mortgage doesn't mean you can't go bankrupt. Secondly, a mortgage is just a small piece of the expense pie. I know plenty of operators that have little to no debt and still got crushed when gas hit $6 a gallon and food prices doubled. Oh, and then all the regulations that change from year to year. Want to bring a lodge owner to his knees, have the TSA inspectors show up and lock up your gas tank because its not up to code. Want a new one, that will be 15 grand. Oh, and you are shut down until you get it. Or how about a surprise inspection on your septic field. 50k for a new one and that doesn't get built overnight. My point being that while my mortgage is every month I have more pressing and sometimes far more expensive things to deal with. If you want to go fishing do NOT buy a fishing lodge. I would say go work at one in the summer. Best job in the world if you like to fish. And finally, contrary to what you might think lodges are starting to do pretty well right now. I know many who had incredible summers last year, even with the late start. In my opinion this is due to the contraction of the industry a few years ago when everything collapsed, plus the strengthening of the US economy (our primary market) and the surging US dollar. And one other thing. At the end of the day and after many years of a tough economic climate I think people said, you know what life is too short, let's go on vacation. But that is just my own personal thought. -FT"
3431482,rzep,2015-01-09 09:11:00,1196,yes ... do not understand why would you want to buy a cow if you like milk .....500K-1M buys a lots of fishing trips ....
3431506,LOW1,2015-01-09 09:14:00,2828,"Wonderful advice/personal experience from FT. I would add this: You need to decide if you want (1) to buy and run a business or (2)if you want to buy (and can afford) a lifestyle. Although there can be some overlap between these two, unless you are very independantly wealthy most people who choose (2) (or their heirs) eventually give it up. If the prospective seller won't give you copies of their books and tax returns I wouldn't pursue it. And numbers that are provided to you which are inconsistent with the tax returns should be considered as fictional. Also consider carefully your living situation at the resort. What are you going to do for health insurance? Do you really want to live where you vacation? How far will your kids have to ride the bus to go to school? Where's the nearest physician/hospital/specialist? Is that cute little grocery store in the nearby burg which has everything you need for a two week fishing going to be adequate for you year around? Do you really like freezing your tail off 7 months of the year? And if you don't know how to weld, make an electrical repair, repair a small engine, and hang a door I would start to learn now because you can't afford to hire someone to do all these things. And as FT says you need to very carefully investigate the physical condition of the resort and factor in the cost of needed upgrades. And working at the resort you want to buy before the sale allows the present owner to get comfortable with you and you to understand the operation."
3431586,SinOrSwim,2015-01-09 09:26:00,1528,"I agree with Ted. Look at how many resorts and lodges there are in Ontario. Someone is making money. Not that it isn't a ton of work. I think I even told Ted when we were there last summer, I could never do what he does. I own my own business, so understand the amount of work it takes. But, I'm not a jack of all trades. I think you need to be to own a lodge though. Or, have a relatively large and quality staff. I have done fly-ins, drive-ins with food provided and without. One thing that always goes through my mind is how different businesses make money doing what they are doing. I go through how they operate in my head and ponder those questions. They all amaze me. The outpost operators dealing with scheduling, flights, etc. The drive in camp that doesn't offer food but has basically no staff. Where we go the owner has been building all new cabins by himself over the last few years. They are beautiful. Then, seeing Ted's operation and the number of staff he has and all the other things that go with it. Point being, there are many different types of operations. So, not only the camp but the type of camp that fits your abilities would be huge.There is a lot to think about before doing it. But, the people that have a passion for it and work their a s s e s off will be successful.Just like anything else. If it were easy, everyone would do it. It also seems like the successful operations are the ones that upgrade things before they break or deteriorate.I've always wanted to own a little bar/restaurant. But, I realize how difficult it would be. So, I stick to eating and drinking there instead of owning it."
3431610,rzep,2015-01-09 09:34:00,1196,"Most business owners will show minimal profit or even loses on their tax returns to decrease tax liability ....when you talk to them to buy their business .... "" .. oh ...it is best business you can own ..."". I bet you is similar with lodges/resorts ... if you simply do the arithmetic, it will not work out. Few years back I stayed on Eagle Lake resort with new, two year owner, young family with a kid. Weeks I was staying (July), I was the only one using cabin and there was another couple in lodge...hope it worked out for them."
3431978,Obabikon,2015-01-09 12:15:00,2370,"If you're going to purchase a resort, the idea of not having a mortgage isn't very realistic. While it would be nice to be rich and not need one... that doesn't happen very often. Most of us who ""take the plunge"" into the resort business work with large payments. We have to work very hard to stay afloat the first few years. My suggestion would be, when getting your mortgage, try get enough to pay for the resort, and at least two years worth of payments. That also may not be possible, but it would be a huge help. I've had a lot of these conversations in the past few years. How do you get into this business? Well, you decide you're going to do it, and dive in head first. Worst that can happen? You lose everything. Luckily, I was young, and didn't have much to lose. Now my wife and I have two kids... could I have made myself pull the trigger at this stage in my life? It would've been much more difficult. Here's my suggestions if you're dead set on buying... 1st - if you can't afford the camp outright, don't buy one that needs a ton of money/work poured into it. It is cheaper, of course, to buy a resort that is run down. However, those resorts are usually also not very busy. Basically, it becomes twice as difficult to make it if you have to build the business AND spend a ton of money on renovations. 2nd - have an ""emergency"" fund. Don't leverage yourself to the gills. If something goes wrong (and it will) you don't want to be without a slush fund. There will be things that pop up that are very unexpected. Banks would be very hesitant to give a second mortgage, and rightfully so. 3rd - this quickly becomes a ""lifestyle"". It is like farming. You work non-stop, and when you're sleeping, you're still ""on call"". Every time you go out, you represent your resort. If you struggle to have a smile on your face at all moments in time, you may not want to do it. You never know when you'll talk to a potential customer, and you're always working. (trips to walmart, church, out to dinner with the family...) Always be prepared to promote yourself. Humility is a great asset, but courage to make a sale is greater. 4th - make as many friends within the business as you can. There are a lot of owners out there that have been around for a LONG time. The most successful ones... everyone loves. The business really isn't that big. The reason that is important is referrals. I've had several instances where ""my guests"" have needed to come at a time where I just can't fit them in. I have a handful of other resorts that I am willing to stake my reputation on. Those small ""favors"" are always returned in some way shape or form. But, there has to be mutual trust and appreciation. 5th - if you aren't an electrician.. learn. If you aren't a carpenter, become one. If you're bothered by septic, get over it. You have to do it all. Salesman, accountant, guide, public relations, electrician, carpenter, plummer, cook... and many many more jobs. It is very intimidating at first, you get used to it. But, especially in the beginning, you often can't afford to hire those things done. 6th - and lastly... If you don't like fishing, don't get in the business. If you can't live without fishing... DO NOT GET INTO THE BUSINESS. There's a fine line. You have to love it, and be willing to make it your life. However, you have to be able to watch other people enjoy it, and have passion about THEIR experience. I'm not meaning to preach or sound uppity in any way. I was too young when my wife and I purchased the resort (25). This will be year nine, and a lot of my views have changed. It isn't at all like ""working"". You live your life on the resort. There's no clock to punch. You just do what needs to be done, and have a smile on your face while doing it. It is an amazing lifestyle. It isn't a get rich life, but it is a life full of riches."
3432098,v-bay gord,2015-01-09 13:38:00,3168,"Obabikon has another great set of points that are ""right on"". I would add to the mix of all that has been said that you need to consider the role of your partner (in this I mean spouse) in all of this. Running a camp is full of work, and it seems that the women's role is at times the least glamorous. Make sure your spouse is committed to the idea. If you have some vague notion of yourself being on the water and sharing cocktails in the evening with guests...while your wife cleans cabins, cooks and does laundry....then slap yourself. Consider if your wife wants a career away from camp, then be prepared to work that into the mix. Other incomes when starting out can make a big difference......whether this is during the camp season or in the ""off"" season. There is a reason they say ""happy wife, happy life""."
3432138,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-09 14:04:00,461,To add to that if you have a younger family they too need to be on board. I brought the whole clan up on several occasions before buying so they knew what it was all about. Kids may not be on board either. They too will need to work. Again. Lifestyle.
3432162,dkrusin,2015-01-09 14:09:00,97,"I have soooo much respect for you camp owners. Was always my dream, my wife not so much. Getting too old now.There is one thing I'd like to mention to the fisherman reading this post...Remember we are their guest and if you really want to do your resort owner a favor, leave your cabin like you found it. Pull the bedding, sweep the floor, take out the trash, do the dishes, wipe down the stove, clean out the cupboards, clean off the counter, clean out the frig wipe down the frig., clean the bathroom. We even leave a little tip on the table. There are nine guys in our group (1cabin) takes maybe 10 minutes before we leave. You treat your resort owner right, they'll treat you right. Guaranteed!"
3432242,v-bay gord,2015-01-09 14:50:00,3168,"Very true. There is something disheartening when the cleaning person mentions how much of a disaster a certain group may have left their cabin. The same group you have been bending over backwards for all week. No one expects a pristine cabin at the end of the week, but some evidence of an effort to tidy it up is certainly appreciated......and the majority do (thank you!)"
3432274,Manitou,2015-01-09 15:32:00,125,"This is an idea that interests me as I am a property owner on LOTW.I have a few lots for sale but am not actively listing.I've always been interested in the idea of some type of ""rod and gun club"" that would be able to accommodate seasonal visitors.The property is basically raw land with hydro and an old camp at one end, and I'm planning to put a travel trailer out there this winter/spring. And develop as money and time permit.As Americans do you not have to hire a guide or stay at a lodge to fish up here? What are the regs on that?I wouldn't want to try to compete with existing services, just provide a spot for guys who want to be on their own."
3434354,v-bay gord,2015-01-10 17:08:00,3168,Check out this opportunity to manage a camp for this season. It's the second post down on this blog... https://www.facebook.com/gordon.pyzer?fref=nf
3435642,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-11 08:40:00,461,"Again, search for the thread with tons of critical pieces of information on how to buy one. But to add to Obabikon’s great points here are a couple more pieces of advice:- In your first year or two you will need access to capital and quickly. Even if your resort is perfect (and to be honest, how do you really know it is?). As Obabikon said, things go wrong. All the time. And at a lodge you aren’t talking about your normal run of the mill items. When things break they are almost always very expensive and of a time sensitive nature. My dishwasher at home is what, $400. At the lodge it’s like 4 grand. Also keep in mind you potentially have a HUGE asset pool that can break as a nature of the business. Everything in the kitchen is of commercial quality (read expensive). But you have boats, docks, septic systems, water systems…… - Which leads me to Obabikon’s next point. Study up on everything from wiring to small engines, septic lines to water filters. Honestly, this part scared the heck out of me. But you know what. It shouldn’t. Once you get some hands on experience its not that tough and many items that seem complex (installing a septic field for example) aren’t. The internet is a great way to learn up on this stuff. I found that I could learn so much about things I never would have done at home. This has been a very rewarding piece of the business for me personally. It is kind of cool to know how to diagnose a water heater failure, drain and swap out elements in a matter of minutes. 10 years ago I couldn’t tell you where my heater was in my house….I’m not going to drone on but two more things that may seem obvious but aren't.- Network. You may think you are the best businessman in the world, and you just may be. But a smart businessman knows they don’t know everything. There is so much knowledge out there at your disposal. Use it. Join lodge owner organizations and go to their meetings. You will be blown away by their knowledge and more importantly their willingness to help teach and guide you. They have seen more than you ever will. Get to know them.- And finally you have to like to fish but have to be able to live without it (credit to Obabikon). Think real hard about that. This caught me a little off-guard my first summer or two. Here I was with all this great fishing around me and I kept getting stuck….WORKING! That was a tough thing to swallow. Hearing guys tell stories of huge walleye, incredible hatches, fish jumping into the boat. Hey, this sucks I said to myself…….. But something interesting happened. Their stories and successes started to turn into my success. Their excitement was mine. And what it turned into is that I fed off of their happiness and wonder. It is exactly like Christmas for a parent. Watching your kids joy is far more rewarding than experiencing it yourself. This is why I got into this business. Every day is Christmas for me and I get to see my guests experience it first-hand. It is a business like few others. -FT"
3438842,skindzier,2015-01-12 11:51:00,137,"My understanding is that non-residents can stay up to 6 months a year. There are no requirements for using local resources - you just have to have a valid non-resident fishing/hunting license and follow the regs associated with those. As long as the camp itself is not generating income, there shouldn't be any limitations on owning it & having multiple guys stay there. If you start charging guys you have an issue. By all means, if anybody sees it differently, please chime in..."
3431658,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-09 09:52:00,461,"Ummm. Not really. What your tax return says is nearly always NOT a representation of the strength of the business or what you make personally. Our goal is to minimize corporate taxes plain and simple. Businesses are able to write-off soft numbers that have nothing to do with cash flow, most notably depreciation. Also as any small business owner will tell you there are lots and lots of perks not normally seen if you are an employee. Hypothetically I could write off $200,000 in depreciation to make it look like I lost 50k last summer when in fact I made 150k. And that doesn't include all the personal things I can expense my company for that looks like my company lost even more money than the 50k but drop my personal expenses considerably, acting as tax free salary. Things like cell phones, internet, company trucks/cars, expensed health care, ""business trips/vacations"", clothing (to an extent)...trust me the list goes on and on. Not to mention a salary, equity payouts or even interest expense on your down payment for buying the lodge. These all affect the TAX gain/loss of the business but have a direct effect on MY bottom line. When you buy your business you and your accountant will rip through the financials and extract all of these items out which will essentially give you a second set of numbers from which you will work with as you purchase the business. As I said on another thread years ago, this business is unlike few others and is not always about the money. Many owners take lower margins and crazy work hours because they are living a dream few will ever see. It is indeed a lifestyle and in the end isn't that what life is all about? -FT"
3431738,rzep,2015-01-09 10:05:00,1196,"yes it is about lifestyle .... I try to stay away from ""creative accounting"".. not sure I would want resort even if I was to inherit one (unless would sell). From the couple resorts I stay in each year, seems as it is A LOT of work for the owners. And if owners are hands off, there is A LOT of work watching/managing others to make sure work gets done."
3431754,SinOrSwim,2015-01-09 10:11:00,1528,"Ownership is not for everyone regardless of the industry whether it be a lodge, being a landlord or buying a restaurant.If an owner has an exit strategy, many times they will show as much profit as possible the years leading up to a sale. Forgo the tax breaks on certain things to show as much profit as possible to increase the value for an eventual sale. But, even if they don't, like Ted said, you can look into those numbers and see how they will impact your business plan moving forward."
3431866,v-bay gord,2015-01-09 11:17:00,3168,"Ted knows his stuff.....and SinorSwim has good observations as well. As for rzep, that lodge on Eagle Lake is now subdivided and a private home."
3429386,walleye22,2015-01-08 12:03:00,59,How to go about looking for a fishing camp in northern Ontario? What about seasonal working a camp? Websites or any other info? Word of mouth? Just curious as to where to look. Thanks Boys.
3429490,skindzier,2015-01-08 12:49:00,137,"I nearly pulled the trigger on one in 2005 - there was only one that I looked at that I really thought would be profitable & the owner ended up taking it off the market. My best advice to you is do your homework. Don't expect to make a lot of money and be careful, because you can lose your shirt. Look beyond the camp's books and look at the living situation of the owners. Why are they selling? If the camp is failing, do you really think you can succeed where they didn't? My current fantasy is to buy a smaller camp & turn it into a private compound with some other guys. Probably will never come to fruition, however I keep tabs on what's out there... Here's some sites:http://borderlandrealty.com/listings.php?ltype=21http://austinrealty.on.ca/realty/ind...pclass%5B%5D=1http://screalty.on.ca/index.php?acti...results&pclass[]=8http://www.latitude50.on.ca/Resorts_...e_1652571.html"
3429554,SinOrSwim,2015-01-08 13:09:00,1528,"I've always wondered if the good lodges end up being sold before anyone every sees them on the market? sort of like good rental properties here. I know one of the places we used to go was sold to one of the employees. Well, part of it anyway. So, many of the good ones go to someone working for the business or that has possibly been visiting the lodge for years and let the owner know they have an interest if they ever sell. I couldn't do it and I own my own business. I can't imagine working as hard as some of those guys do. Plus, I am not handy enough. You would have to be a jack of all trades. I know MorganMan would love to own one someday."
3429578,Obabikon,2015-01-08 13:19:00,2370,"To be honest... many lodge owners are very careful in how they try to sell their resort. There can be a concern about repeat guests ""jumping ship"" if they hear that the resort is for sale. So, you're right in saying that some are sold before they are listed. Many are for sale, even if they aren't listed. As far as camp work goes... I would suggest building your resume and just start sending it to resorts in the area you're looking for. There always seems to be positions available. There isn't as much money in this business as many think, so don't expect to ""get rich""."

There were a couple of great threads a year or two ago and page after page of advice on getting into the business, risks, rewards etc. I bought 6 years ago and would be happy to talk with you 1/1 and answer any and all questions I can. I can also direct you to a top-notch realtor that has sold hundreds of lodges over the last 25 years and is just an incredible resource for locating the right lodge for you and then structuring a deal to make it happen. Lodge acquisition I have found can be somewhat daunting for many reason. A good realtor is key in navigating through the process (and an accountant and lawyer). In terms of working at one in the summer yes you can send your resume out to individual lodges but a better approach is to look on the job boards. Many lodges, including my own post positions looking for their summer help. One popular board us indeed.ca. And then there is job board through the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA). Can't remember exact one but just Google. Lodges are starting to hire now so if you really want to work this summer time is of the essence. Again, would be happy to help. -FT"
3431065,walleye22,2015-01-09 06:38:00,59,Thanks for the help. Been going up since I was 7 so about 36 years now and sometimes a few trips a year. I know the Ontario area fairly well. You guys are right and can be tough to get a good camp as the owners like to sell to folks they know and can trust and have worked for them in the past. My gramps and dad always wanted to a camp but both passed on. I am ready for a life change and have been looking and thinking for the past couple years about this more seriously. I also wouldn't mind just being able to buy me a cabin on red lake or gullrock area and spend all my summer there but wouldn't mind owning me a nice little fishing camp.

I imagine working at one wouldn't be a lot different. I wouldn't buy a resort expecting to get much fishing in or working short hours. Can't imagine things are any different now. I think Shellback hit it right, hard to make money with a resort with today's economy. al"
