They asked (told) me to thank the contributors again for a fantastic time. I had a computer issue and lost some data on the trip so I only have the names of the guys who I had a personal address for. I apologize to those that I miss who also contributed. Mark Kominkiewicz, Sirmanski Lures ( Mike Saresky), Scott Gruns, Larry Schroeder, Jay Wilson, Dave Mercer, Ed Kovach, William Bess, and John Lawrence. As I said, some are missing but you know who you are. Also attached are links to the Cleveland Plain Dealer front page article and the CBC news article from Thunder Bay. Thanks a million again..http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunde...trip-1.2625572http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index...et_hooked.html Joe T"
