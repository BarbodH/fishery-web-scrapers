3421050,smbrickner,2015-01-05 09:33:00,276,So for the first time in 10 years we are trying a new spot. I always wanted to explore a bit more and try some new water. I have fished Minnitaki for the last 10 years.This year I am going to try the Indian Chain. Anybody fished both? What can I expect in terms of water size/hazards?
3423562,TD 4,2015-01-06 09:18:00,5,I have been going to Minnitaki for 29 years this june number 30. We fish in the Moonlight and SWBay area so we do some traveling. I know the lake well and we do well so I'm a little afraid to move . I know we are missing some wonderful lakes to fish but we are happy . We fish 2nd week in June . Nobody seems to talk much about Minnitaki . We have stayed at PAC all 29 years.

3426322,srj,2015-01-07 10:17:00,971,"Two totally different lake systems. The Indian chain is small water, Minnitaki big water. Very good numbers on the Indian chain but not great size. One unusual thing is no northerns (unless they have found their way in there...Haven't been there in a while), but good numbers of muskies that don't seem to get too large. Quite a variation on the lakes from shallow with cloudy water to deep and clear. The western most lake, Cobble, has a nice population of whitefish and trout. Whitefish were our favorite fish to target. Minnitaki on the other hand has lots of fish and big fish. Big water, small water, take your choice and have fun."
3428042,IAWally,2015-01-07 23:50:00,38,We have stayed at KCs landing the last 5 years and the fishing gets better every year both size and numbers. The Clarks are great host with outstanding accommodations. I am planning two more trips this year. You can find better fishing but we catch enough to keep us going back. One of the things we like it not many other boats you wont have someone come push you off your spot.
