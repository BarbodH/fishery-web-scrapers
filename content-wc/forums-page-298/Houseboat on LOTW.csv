3426130,Ebarnett,2015-01-07 09:06:00,60,"Thanks guys for all your help. I did call Floating Lodges and talked with Jim(?). He said that such a trip is doable but uncommon as most are trying to get away from people not go to them (kenora). It would also probably be twice the expense in gas and also cut into afternoon fishing time. However with the wives and kids on board sitting in one or two spots watching the men go fishing all day may not fly, so im still not certain how this trip might pan out. It may be a concession of both agendas."
3428362,SinOrSwim,2015-01-08 06:54:00,1528,"I've never done a HB fishing trip up there but I have owned 3 different houseboats with the current one being about 60 ft long. You may be underestimating the difficulty in moving and anchoring. Weather, wind and quality area to beach can have a major impact.What about having a couple different plans? If you move it once and it's not hard do it again the next day. Or if not, have a plan where to move the following day, skipping day 1 plans. Plus, wouldn't you rather fish an area more than just a few hours? There is a lot of water to explore within a 30 to 60 min boat ride from your location. Just seems like you would spend half your time moving the HB. Plus, I know my group would all be drinking while we moved it during the afternoon and wouldn't get squat done after that. LOL"
3428562,Ebarnett,2015-01-08 07:44:00,60,Yes I think that this might be the better idea. Another poster also mentioned moving every other day and going further when we do move it.
3428658,SinOrSwim,2015-01-08 08:04:00,1528,"I have a 9, 6 and 4 year old. My kids are always sort of excited to take the houseboat out........but get very bored while underway. It's not an exciting thing to do. LOL I love it. I enjoy driving it and docking it etc. (well usually enjoy docking it) They are very difficult to maneuver in the wind. But, I'm not sure the wives and kids will get much more excitement moving it vs staying put and figuring out things to do. But, if you are wanting for them to be able to take a boat to town, maybe not going as far from SN could be an option? Someone could make a run with the fishing boats to drop them off in town etc.I don't know your wife and kids obviously. I just know mine would be bored to death unless they fished. Which my 9 year old would. The others, not so much."
3396466,Ebarnett,2014-12-26 19:56:00,60,"Newbie here....have taken several fishing trips to Ontario but have been looking at renting a houseboat on LOTW. Never fished this lake but know it is huge. My question to those who have done it is what are some of the costs involved? For example, I am thinking of renting a houseboat at Sioux Narrows for a week. Working our way up the east coastline and be in Kenora by midweek, then working our way back down the west side and across back to Sioux Narrows. Moving roughly 12-18 miles per day, finding a nice spot, parking and fishing for the day then move to next spot the next day (thinking of moving the boat in the afternoons to utilize the mornings and evenings for fishing) I've calculated about 100 or so miles round trip. Is this too far to go in a houseboat? What would the cost in gas be? It's a family trip, so a stop in Kenora for the wives to get off the boat, eat out, get a few gifts etc. would be nice. Anyway, any advice would be appreciated."
3396690,Blades-n-Beads,2014-12-26 22:40:00,484,Sounds like fun when you picking me up. I've fished the north end for many years but have never done a houseboat trip so I'm no help here. I'm sure there's a few will jump in with info shortly.
3397554,jimirjr,2014-12-27 10:10:00,1149,"Great plan, BUT, I would suggest NOT moving every day. Pick out a nice area and spend some time fishing THAT area. Don't know what time of Year you are going, but The time of year and weather will dictate the location of the fish. Also, when moving the HB, You might make maybe 3.5 - 4.5 mph on a calm day... depending on the size of the HB, how many boats You tow, how many people onboard, etc, etc. AND, you will use a BUNCH of gas... I would pick a day, fish for about 5-6 hours, and THEN move the boat toward Kenora.... maybe travel 20-30 miles in one feld swoop. You will find that it's a bit of a chore to tie up the HB.... Thats why I suggest doing it every other day, or even every 3rd day depending on the length of Your trip.... If you have a 7 day trip, You will be pressed for time to travel that far and ENJOY the whole experience.... and that's why You do the trip.... to have a good time and minimize the ""work"" part of it..."
3397690,unclejoe,2014-12-27 11:23:00,22,"I think most guys set up camp in one spot for the week and just run to areas from the HB. If I were going to move it would be once and I would go to the furthest camp first and when I move it would be half way towards your take out as you head home. I know guys on Lac Seul that venture 8-10 hours one way so you almost lose a day up and day back. The other choice is 2 guys man the HB and the other guys fish on the way up,etc. Lots of ways to do it,but I think the main benefit of HB is to camp right by your spots and to cut down on drive time. If your are constantly moving that big behemoth 4 mph you are going to really cut into your fishing time."
3399562,ftfarms,2014-12-28 08:16:00,444,From my experience that's a lot of moving that takes a lot of time and gas. Your probly looking at spending 25 hours of fishing time just to move and get set up. I prefer to park it in a remote spot and stay there. It's not like you can just park a house boat any place
3399882,Ebarnett,2014-12-28 10:48:00,60,Thanks for all your input. This will help me plan better.
3401665,Jatar,2014-12-29 06:19:00,169,"I have done the Houseboat trip several times, Out of Kenora. 1st day, 3-4 hours and find a spot to beach the boat. ( everybody wants to fish right away) We would usually stay 1-2 nights then move on during the afternoon. Due to the amount of people camping, you might have a hard time finding a suitable beach. Moving the Houseboat around eats up a lot of fuel, resist the temptation to cruise as fast as the boat will go, and back off and enjoy the day. Maps are a must and follow the routes. PM me if you want more info."
3425978,Blue walleye,2015-01-07 08:18:00,29,"Been out of Kenora a few years back and the houseboat was a blast. But if you want to fish a lot I don't think it's a good idea to travel that much every day. If you want to sight see it would be a great trip. Lake of the woods is a beautiful place to be. Also driving a houseboat can be a little stressful at times if you get into a little traffic. A houseboat is a big vessel to be on the water with and if you are making a turn, start the turn early and ease into it. Try not to make a fast turn. When docking your houseboat make sure you dock on the calm side of island, stay out of the wind if possible. We had a little issue with that, the wind at night pushed the boat sideways and we had a **** of a time getting the back of the boat out so we could leave. We went on a 4 day trip and moved twice, we moved the second because of the wind. From Kenora we went 9 miles and it was almost 4 hrs to go that far. We went at the end of July and the fishing for walleye was great we also caught some nice perch and northern. No matter what you do you will have fun the houseboat is a great experience. Don't know what time of year you are going but pm me if you want some info on fishing the time of year we went......Good luck and have fun"
3426050,38bill,2015-01-07 08:43:00,331,Have you checked with the rental place about your plans? Could be they wouldn't want their boats that far from them in case there is a problem.
3426090,LOW1,2015-01-07 08:53:00,2828,"Tomahawk Resorts in Sioux Narrows has some lake maps on their website that will give you some ideas of distance, etc. I agree with the others that your initial plans may involve too much travelling with the houseboat. Perhaps you can find a good sheltered anchorage in the area west of Yellow Girl Bay. Tomahawk rents houseboats and they can give you more info I am sure.http://www.tomahawkresort.com/lakeofthewoods/You will want to get paper copies of the charts for Whitefish Bay and for the Aulneau Peninsula to Kenora sections of the lake.Here is a good guide to get for more mooring locations and other information on various parts of the lake, including the area that you are interested in.http://www.mcnallyrobinson.com/97809...e-of-the-woods"
