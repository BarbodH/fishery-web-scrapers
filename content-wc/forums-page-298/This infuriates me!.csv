3432290,LOW1,2015-01-09 15:32:00,2828,"I would think (and hope) that lying to a national customs/border protection officer would be taken very seriously. Vehicle forfeiture perhaps? It's because of yahoos like this minnow smuggler that many of us may be subject to closer inspection and delay when we cross the border and/or may encounter tired/cranky border agents. Let's try and give them a break, considering that they may have just dealt with a jerk like this in the vehicle in front of us."
3432330,P&y only,2015-01-09 15:49:00,133,"When I was a teenager I was fishing with a very old man. He was a friend of my Dad's and was a great man. One day we were sitting in a backwater cove trying to fish. The bay was absolutely choked with weeds.The Old Man gets in his tackle box and takes out a pill bottle. He opens it up and pours the contents into his hand. It looked like charcoal to me. Then he throws it overboard into the weeds. Not one word spoken.Finally, I just gotta know. "" what was that?"" he says it was aquacide. A weed killer that would kill weeds but not hurt fish, etc.... I just laughed at this dumb old man. ""What good would that handful do in this bay?"" What he said next rings in my head to this day.Boy, I can't afford to fix the whole bay. But I'm doing my share. If everyone did their share, we wouldn't have the problem.Now, I'm not saying the aquacide was a good or bad idea. But the concept was, and still is HUGE!. If we all just do our share, we won't have the problem.This is true of preventing invasives, picking up our trash etc.. You don't have to fix everything. JUST DO YOUR SHARE!"
3432866,AllenW,2015-01-09 21:32:00,11482,"Introducing a species that wasn't there before, no different than what them guys are doing only legal, but the results are the same. fwiw we took frozen smelt to Canada when live bait was hard to come by, I think smelt are illegal now though maybe? There's way to get around no or spendy live bait, trying to smuggle them in should result in loss of equipment and vehicles. al"
3432890,bigwillies,2015-01-09 22:00:00,515,i agree with the b.s. minnow trappers on my lake have introduced rudd into the lake.would love to go on a rant but they advertise on this site so i can't
3431314,rzep,2015-01-09 08:06:00,1196,Are minnows that much more expensive in CAN ?
3431354,bigwalleye1,2015-01-09 08:15:00,2632,"Yup, upwards of $6/doz for walleye sized minnows, and there are lots of places they're not even available at all."
3431474,v-bay gord,2015-01-09 09:02:00,3168,"I understand the subtleties of bait fish crossing the border, but I don't think you are comparing yourself to someone who hides 50 dozen minnows in gas cans and lies to border officials......are you?"
3431530,sloughboy,2015-01-09 09:17:00,13,"The lodge owners and residents can't just be upset. Alliances need to be formed to stop this problem at the border. Stronger regs, inspections and penalties all need to be put in place. You have extremely well managed fisheries and your waters are pristine and offer something very special to those who want to come and experience your natural resources. Special places need special rules."
3431602,3M TA3,2015-01-09 09:31:00,2846,Not at all. Just pointing out no matter where you are fishing be sure to have your bait receipt. Should clear things up quickly...........most times.
3431674,Mike Kansas,2015-01-09 09:57:00,1463,A smarter man would have those gas cans filled with Crown Royal. That would save a lot more money than 570 minnows would. Mike Kansas

3432178,Mark R,2015-01-09 14:11:00,1538,Kind of like putting musky's in a lake that never had them huh? al __________________ I'm not sure how bringing minnows across the border in a gas can compares to the DNR stocking muskie in a lake where they aren't currently swimming.
3432186,dkrusin,2015-01-09 14:18:00,97,"Know of a guy so talented he can take the cap off a coke bottle and not break the seal. Puts Kahlua back in, screws on cap, seal not broken. Saves about 10 bucks, oh well."
3432218,billy weaver,2015-01-09 14:37:00,470,"In a recent thread on a fishing violation the DNR took the guys boat and fishing equipment (Minnesota). I think this would be more serious than a violation of ""over the limit"". There is several groups of fisherman in my area that fish Canada every year and support any effort to maintain a healthy fishery."
3429970,v-bay gord,2015-01-08 15:33:00,3168,"I know some on this board like to say invasive species spread is inevitable. ""The turtles and birds do it"". I say B.S. It's trash like this idiot that is the problem. http://www.ckdr.net/news/94829634/fi...h-fort-frances I'm I irritated.....you bet!"
3430130,fishron,2015-01-08 16:45:00,317,"Many good fisheries have been ruined by individuals (I won't call them sportsmen), that thought they were helping the fishery by introducing carp species (including goldfish), white perch and others that have degraded the fishery. It's inevitable that our species will mess around with the natural balance an ignore the rules."
3430154,Blades-n-Beads,2015-01-08 16:52:00,484,"And a $1,500 dollar fine! Like that's going to deter anyone. I'm sorry but that is just not enough. He was well aware of what he was doing. $20,000 dollar fine will make a statement!"
3430178,Aspencreek,2015-01-08 17:00:00,2911,"I wonder how long he and possibly others have been doing this. I'll bet you last month's paycheck this is not the first time, just the first time getting caught.How much is 47.5 dz minnows worth theses days. I'll also bet they weren't for his consumption, he was selling those."
3430354,KraTToR,2015-01-08 17:56:00,681,"You can bet they're stepping up their checking anything that holds a significant amount of liquid. IE Jerry cans, coolers,.... its late, that's all I can think of for the moment....."
3430458,Fishin Fun,2015-01-08 18:47:00,218,"Idiot. They should fine him and ban him from entry into Canada for a period of time. I agree, $1500 isn't enough."
3430802,Obabikon,2015-01-08 21:22:00,2370,I agree 100%. I will also say that banning live bait in Ontario won't deter jerks like this from breaking the law.
3430954,Pooch,2015-01-09 05:10:00,4619,"That was innovative of the guy. Too bad jerks, schmucks, whatever like this can't use that same resourcefulness towards something productive. I've known people like this and always considered them somewhat of a social-path. It's always about them with no regard for others or the law.I can't think of a punishment other than loss of all his fishing connected ""stuff"" as in boat and gear plus a fine that would be appropriate enough. I don't understand why these guys are not barred from returning for life. I also wonder how long and how many others get away with this?I really agree with V-Bay. Really ticks me off. Look at the Illinois river and see what bucket stocking can do to a natural resource. Destroyed a fantastic and improving fishery. Guys used to catch large mouth bass in the river and sometimes small mouth in the feeder streams around here. Not anymore.Pooch"

3431298,3M TA3,2015-01-09 07:49:00,2846,"Not much to read, 3 sentences of the article, I am guilty though of transporting minnows into Ontario waters. I often fish the Boundary Waters, Lake Erie waters too, purchasing minnows on the US side and invariably those minnows wind up catching fish in Ontario. Purchased bait on the Ontario side too and surly they have caught fish on the US side. Enforcement is the same though, even if the bait is native to the water, it is illegal to use imported live bait. I think enforcement is the same only for consistently applying the rules. I understand the logic but hard to swallow sometimes. Always be sure to carry your receipt when transporting and using live bait."
