3432154,lakerbreaker,2015-01-09 14:08:00,253,People were getting crappies there when we were up last weekend. Sounded like they were in all the standard spots in Sabaskong.
3436874,Sunset Cove,2015-01-11 15:57:00,9,"Sorry for the late response, things have been quite busy around here. Travel on all the local lakes is good for snowmobiles, just a little bit rough from the frozen drifts. Crappies fishing right close to Nestor Falls has been a little bit slower than when we first started out. They are still getting them just have to put a little more time in. As far as Hay Island, I just spoke to a friend today who was out to Hay on Friday and they caught 5. That is the only report I have heard from that side. Lake trout reports has been a bit spotty with some groups doing very well and others doing poor. So I am assuming it will depend on the fishermen I guess. Hopefully I can get out this week and let everyone know from first hand experience."
3352522,Sunset Cove,2014-12-08 08:24:00,9,"We have been fishing on the ice for around a week or so. Have 6 to 9 inches of good blue ice, quads and snowmobiles are good to go but trucks will be a while yet as we have been having some pretty warm temps. Crappies have been biting great so far and averaging around the 11 inch mark. Walleyes are doing fairly decent and also catching a few mixed in with the crappies around the 30 foot mark. Ice roads are being plowed with quads so hopefully will build some ice quicker so we can get the vehicles out. Will try to keep everyone up to date as things progress."
3359482,Sunset Cove,2014-12-11 09:58:00,9,We have stalled out at 10 inches with all this warm weather. Crappie fishing is still hot. Small jigs with grubs or minnows seem to working best. Walleye have turned on also in the same spots. Will keep everyone posted as to when the ice roads will be open for vehicles.
3375514,Sunset Cove,2014-12-17 20:33:00,9,We are up to between 11 and 14 inches pretty much anywhere on this end of the lake. Fishing is still hot with lots of crappies and walleyes. there are a few good perch being caught but not the steady run of jumbos yet. Basically no snow left on the lake so make sure you bring some traction for your boots if you are going to be fishing outside.
3388874,lakerbreaker,2014-12-23 14:22:00,253,Any snow updates? Getting concerned for laker opener and sled travel-
3391402,Sunset Cove,2014-12-24 10:08:00,9,"Havent made any more ice on Lake of the Woods, was up to Whitefish the other day and there is anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of ice. We avoided all the channels and neck downs but trout holes are good to fish. Just make sure you take the proper routes to get there. Crappies and Walleyes are still going good on this side. Second hand info from Rowan and Crow is about the same as the conditions on W F Bay."
3391418,lakerbreaker,2014-12-24 10:16:00,253,The snow is what I'm concerned about-is there enough for sleds?
3391474,Sunset Cove,2014-12-24 10:27:00,9,As of right now you are good to go. If it turns cold and freezes you will be in trouble. We will definitely need some snow if it turns cold.
3391514,lakerbreaker,2014-12-24 10:39:00,253,"A couple of us have wheelers so we won't be completely stranded, will have to make the call on New Year's Eve -"
3391986,Sunset Cove,2014-12-24 15:09:00,9,give us a ring before you head up. will have a definite report for you
