3429562,Weby13,2015-01-08 13:18:00,57,I have a group of 10 adults and kids heading up to Eddies June 20-27. We were there a few years ago on a reccommedation from Solopaddler and had a blast! Mike was generous enough to send me a detailed map. Just checking to see if anyone else is heading up to Eddies in 2015? Last time we were there it was mid August so I know fishing in June will be different. Can anyone share info or tips I need to know about fishing in June? Good luck wherever you decide to go! Fish on!!!

There's lots of water both upstream and down that's never been fished. Will be fishing Blackbirch this year in September with Eddie, can't wait!"
3429954,Weby13,2015-01-08 15:32:00,57,Mike when we were there water was really down. We couldn't get to alot of spots we would of loved to. Some that you marked out. I hope the water is up so we can explore! Thanks for all your help and posts! I enjoy everything you bring to this site!!!
3430090,Mike Borger,2015-01-08 16:37:00,1554,"Well hopefully you still have the marked map, I doubt you'll have any issues getting to any of those spots in June!Thanks for the kind words, I'm always happy to help."
