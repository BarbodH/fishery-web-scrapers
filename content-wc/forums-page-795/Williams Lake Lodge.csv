I will stay at main camp next year. As far as the fishing goes. Great!! Caught many, many large walleye. The biggest was 28 1/2"" and many 24's & 25's. Our average was probably 21 to 22 inches. No problem with numbers either, we averaged 40 to 50 per day. We used nothing but 1/4"" to 3/8"" jigs with minnows, twister tails, crawlers and leeches. Most important was to work slooooowwwww. Good luck! Fixer"
