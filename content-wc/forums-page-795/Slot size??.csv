542399,retire55,2004-08-06 10:00:00,1029,"Walleye6: Take a look at page 14 on the following reference:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...p_E_fr2004.pdf The following is stated for Minnitaki Lake as well as other lakes: ""Walleye and sauger must be less than 46 cm (18 in.) or greater than 53 cm (20.9 in.) and not more than one (1) greater than 53 cm (20.9 in.) in length."" ""No person shall possess any live fish taken by angling other than bait-fish."""
