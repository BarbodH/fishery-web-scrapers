542289,fishstalker,2004-08-02 14:58:00,54,I live in Chicago. The #1 tip is hitting Chicago (it doesn't matter which expressway) around 3AM. usually the traffic isn't too bad then. usually. The only worse traffic I have seen is Toronto and Los Angeles.
542293,Guest,2004-08-02 18:36:00,0,i have driven both ways. from the east coast and from central illinois. i would definately opt for the rockford route. all big cities are a pain.
542340,Big Tim,2004-08-04 03:50:00,63,"I live very near where 294 starts on the south end. If you have any other choices, Stay off 80/94 in Indiana. Even @ 3AM they close off(some nights) all but one lane to do some major road work. 294 has a few road work areas, but if you can avoid it in daylight , you should be fine. Going up thru Michigan, or south to 39 will make you happier. We leave in 16 days & we time our departure to miss the worst of the trafic. Good luck with the fishing!! Wishin' I was fishin'"
542359,Guest,2004-08-04 16:11:00,0,"Dearest Chester, you now have over twenty suggestions on what to do, and none of them really matter because anything can happen on the road. I hope you don't spend the week of your vacation worrying about the ride home. If you have to sit in traffic for a hour or two its no big deal. Don't be in a big hurry to get to the lodge at noon when they wont let you check in till 3 or 4. Have a nice vacation"
541934,Catman59,2004-07-22 18:41:00,345,"whoops I screwed that one up.....take 61 US to 17 Ca, then at Ignace take 599 to Savant Lake. 642 from a little north of Savant Lake right to Sioux lookout. Hope this helps"
541938,chester,2004-07-22 19:31:00,9,"Thanks Catman, I think im with you. The only thing i noticed is on the map im looking at, 642 cuts across just north of Silver Dollar. Is this the road you take. I think i like this route better, glad you took the time to help me. chester"
541939,Guest,2004-07-22 20:23:00,0,"Just got back from Soiux Lookout this week. We live in Indianapolis and drive through Chicago. This was the 7th year and we havent had a problem yet (well one year there was a high speed chase on the wrong side of 94 that passed us, but we only had to stop for a minute). The toll roads are not that bad and the drive from International Falls to Dryden is a piece of cake. It sounds like you are leaving kind of late though, I would not want to be on 502? at night. We did that one year and it is scary. All of the eyes you see in your headlights looking back at you. Lots of moose and bear. I will get the route we take and post if you need me to."
541942,Catman59,2004-07-22 21:34:00,345,642 is good. our camp owners told me of this route and it seems good.
541944,bellbuoy,2004-07-22 22:19:00,490,"Chester, I don't know where you are in NW OH but I stopped going thru Chicago a few years ago. I live in Indianapolis and take I-74 west to Bloomington, IL and then take I-39 north to Rockford, IL, it's only about 30 miles farther and a lot less traffic headaches, especially with towing a boat. And if it is raining in Chicago, forget it, traffic backs up because of accidents. Took me 3 hours once from out by O'hare to I-65/I-90 and with a manual transmission, that was a lot of pushing the clutch. Also I think there is some MAJOR construction going on in IN on the 80/94 stretch. They have signs posted down here in Indianapolis to avoid the area. You might check the web for construction there.http://www.in.gov/dot/div/traffic/const/nw.html If you do insist on going thru Chicago, I always preferred to go right thru downtown unlike your previous instructions, too many tolls and stops for me on I-294, and then I got off on I-290. I always took I-65 to I-90 west to the Dan Ryan (I-55) and headed north into downtown then west again on the Kennedy (I-90/94). I-94 turns off and goes to Milwaukee, stay on I-90, and use the express lanes whenever possible. My fishing buddy grew up in Gary, IN and usually would drive that part of the trip, but is has become too congested over the years, especially when one is towing a boat. If nothing else, drive north along Lake Michigan to Ludington, MI and take the SS Badger across the lake, I think it's michigancarferry.com. There are only a few areas I have experienced where traffic is worse than Chicago: Washington D.C., Toronto, & Boston, not necessarily in that order. Bellbuoy"
541945,downriverbob,2004-07-23 05:57:00,880,"Chester, I have been going to Lake of the Woods from southeastern Michigan for the past 10 years, I have never gone through Chicago. I go through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Northern Wisconsin, then Minnesota. It might seem to be slower but there is a heck of alot less traffic and the scenery is so much better. I have made it to International Falls, 900 miles in one day and towing a boat with no problems. I go I-75(north), to US-2(west), to M-77(north), to M-28(west), back to US-2 west(through northern Wisconsin) to M-53(Minnesota) which will take you all the way to International Falls."
541951,chester,2004-07-23 08:55:00,9,"Hey New One Thanks!! Yes, if you could give me the route you take it would help in my decision. Thanks for everybodys helpful replys. (priceless) chester"
541953,Guest,2004-07-23 11:46:00,0,"Let me see if I can help. Been going to Minnitaki ""every"" year for more than 25 yrs. I live in Rockford IL. I have gone both ways thru Minn.. This is the best. Int Falls, (53 is very nice four lane from Wis. almost all the way up. fill up with gas here)I always pass through the border on Friday mid-day. Take 11 east out of Fort Francis to 502, 502 north to Dryden (nothing on 502 that is why you fill up at Int Falls.). Take 17 east to Dinorwic, 72 north and you are there. It takes 13 hours from where I live to being in the boat on the water. I am going up mid-August like always."
541971,oldlogin,2004-07-23 19:40:00,22,"Well Chester---a good time and a diversion around the Windy city is the ""Badger"". "" If you've got the bucks, we'll miss Chicago"". It 's a car ferry to the East coast of Wisconson. Since your comupter literate just google and you'll find all the info you'll need."
541988,Guest,2004-07-25 08:45:00,0,"There is a new High Speed Ferry that crosses Lake Mich. to and from Milwaukee. I think that takes only about 2 hours. I'm sorry that I can't give you the name at the moment. I'm sure if you ""google"" Milwaukee that you could find it."
541918,chester,2004-07-22 14:50:00,9,"I will be heading to Int. Falls in a week from N.W. Ohio and wonder if someone can give me some help getting around Chicago. Best route, least traffic. Any help is greatly appreciated. Chester"
541919,Guest,2004-07-22 14:56:00,0,what day and what time will you be hitting Chicago? fish24/7. where are you going in Canada?
541920,Guest,2004-07-22 15:03:00,0,LOL....good luck. If I were you I would go out of my way to avoid ****cago at all costs. Where are you driving from?
541921,chester,2004-07-22 15:07:00,9,psrome We will hit Chicago about 11:30or noon on Friday. Going up to sioux lookout for first time?? Kinda scary but exciting. We will be fishing Minnitaki.
541922,Guest,2004-07-22 15:27:00,0,"That is about the best time to go through Chicago, during the day. Try not to be any later than 1:30 or you will have problem. The optimum time is a little bit after the morning rush hour. 10:00 until 12:00 is when you want to go through. You probably won't hit any traffic in Chicago, but Gary, IN(Highway 80 West) is the spot you have to worry about. If you are going through in the middle of the day it should be all right. Don't take 90-94 through the City. You can do a couple of things. Take 294 north to 90 or you can stay on 80 west and go to 39 north to 90(might take a little longer though). Good luck fishing. Let us all know how you do when you get back. Fish24/7"
541928,Guest,2004-07-22 17:42:00,0,hey aaron lighten up about CHICAGO as bad as it is its better than where you live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! h
541929,Catman59,2004-07-22 17:53:00,345,"I was through there last week , road construction and idiots everywhere. Try to stay off the toll roads , it takes forever to get from 5 toll lanes to 3 travel lanes.......a lot of crap for a $.30 toll. The best time to go through was before 7 AM ( on the way home. ) Im not sure if you have considered it , but the crossing at Thunder Bay is a lot quicker and the road from TB to Ignace is 50 times better than from I Falls. Go north at Ignace , past Savant Lake on 599 .Then just north of SL head west to to Sioux Lookout. Its the same mileage from Thunder bay to Duluth as it is I Falls to Duluth. We go up through I Falls from Iowa and return through Thunder Bay coming home andf the miles are within 20 and the road is lots better. My simpathy to have to go through Shicago."
541930,chester,2004-07-22 17:58:00,9,psrome Thanks for the help. It makes me feel better taking a route that someone is familiar with. may save me alot of frustration. I plan on taking 294 like you suggest. Will report on the trip when we get back.
541932,chester,2004-07-22 18:17:00,9,Hi Catman Man that throws me a curve. To tell you the truth the only reason I thought Int Falls is most of the lodges suggest this way. Plus it sure seems farther by looking at a map.(deceiving)but I can see what you mean. Can you take 642 across to sx lookout or not good.Also a rough idea on the route from daluth to TB would be appreciated. Thanks again
541933,Catman59,2004-07-22 18:36:00,345,"Just take 35 to 61 in Duluth. You cross at Grand Portage and can go straight up to 17 without even going into TBay. Its even better cuz there aint a tole at the bridge and with less traffic , it takes about 1/4 as long to go through. Its a good road north of Duluth , quite a few towns , but still better than all the Indians and slowpokes on 53 ( my opinion). It runs along Superior , but a nice road. I am real happy with the way it works out. We stay at a camp where some Wisconsinites stay every year at the same time and they too say its actually quicker through TB. 622 is as good as any Canada logging road, rougher than #### in spots , but they all are. Its as good as 599 and 17 . get some fuel in Ignace , cuz thats it until Sioux Lookout. ( there is a trading post in Savant Lake with gas , but lots cheaper before you get that far.) Good luck and wish I was going back , our trip ended 2 weeks ago and it wasnt long enough."
