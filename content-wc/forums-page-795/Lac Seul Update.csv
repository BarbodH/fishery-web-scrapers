Caught many large walleyes and averaged 50 per day per person. Used mostly 1/4oz to 3/8oz jigs (pink, white & yellow seemed to be best) with twister tails and/or jigs tipped with minnows or leeches. Most fish caught were over 21 inches. Largest was 28 1/2"". Fish SLOW!! and fish the wind blown shorelines for best results. Fixer"
