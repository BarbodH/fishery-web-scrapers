542393,Guest,2004-08-06 07:07:00,0,we fished it five years ago in july. When we were there the lake was down about 10 feet and the ten of us that fished averaged well over 100 Walleye a day. The other lakes that you could normally boat into were not accesible because of the low water. It is a simple lake to fish since it is more like a river...in fact it is a river ( Pigeon River). The outfitter should be able to put you on fish rather easy. Fish it like a river and fish the holes especially upstream towards the first rapids. We caught a lot of fish in the current in the mile blow the rapids. Good Luck
542395,Larry S,2004-08-06 07:21:00,666,Fished it twice in 1997-1998When Pete and Gery Czorny ran the lodge. Got hundreds of walleyes and in two years 5 pike over 40 inches It fishes like a river and you can't get lost When we went the lodge was excellent a nd food great I still wonder how Pete and Gery are doing Larry S
542397,Guest,2004-08-06 07:29:00,0,We fished it the last year Pete and Geri were there. They bought another Lodge in Manitoba but lost it and I think they are working for another outfitter in Manitoba but I dont know who. They ran a great place and they are good people. Would love to hear from them.

Heard they lost the lodge,talked to Pete on e-mail early 2003 that is last time I have heard from them. They are great people ,and I had a really great time at both the lodges they ran Larry S"
