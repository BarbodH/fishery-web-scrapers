Can anyone give any info on prospects for big fish......what kind of boat we should take with us, a good place to stay and what kind of techniques work best, and where a good place to start fishing would be. I would appreciate any info that anyone can give. Thanks, Eric"
542363,jimbo,2004-08-04 21:51:00,223,I have fished Tobin for 15 years. It should be good in Oct. I go the first part of Oct for a week. I stay at SilverTip Outfitting. Good people to work with give Gary or Zaye a call. They are in the village of Tobin Lake at 306 862 5954. Tell them Jim E. sent you. I am in no way connected to SilverTip Outfitting and do not recive any compensation Jimbo

You will be fishing in the river between the dam(Francois Finlay Dam...I think? )that forms Codette Lake and downstream to the start of Tobin, itself. You will be fishing structure and current breaks. The most popular methods are: Lindy Rigs with very long leaders, using leeches, fishing vertical while floating downstream using the current and boat control to keep vertical over the break lines or in the current break. Or: The other method is trolling cranks....and this has gotten to be very popular at night, during the past 5 or six years. As far as boats go, you don't need a huge boat here. The longest run you would make would be about 7 miles and this would be in the river. Rough water conditions never get very bad in the river. You want to make sure you avoid the week of and the week preceeding the Vanity Cup, unless you like fishing in a 6 mile long crowd. The tournament is usually the weekend closest to Oct. 1. Nipawin, Saskatchewan has a web-site, I believe. You can get phone numbers for lodging, there. There are numerous places to stay in town and at least 3 resorts outside of town near the water."

There is a not so good ramp on the north side of the bridge, a better one on the south side in the park. After putting in, head east past the bridge, the next 5 miles of water are really good. Most of the large walleyes out of Tobin come in the river stretch before the lake opens up. Jigging or Lindy's with live bait is productive. Boat control is difficult at times with the current, but a must to stay on top the drops. Another spot toward the large lake is by Tobin Lake Resort out in front. The grass island in the large lake is a good spot for big pike (>15lbs). If the water is high watch out for floating trees, the lake is full of them. I think the fishery is in a slight decline, but still one of the top ten walleye spots in NA."

I've seen 20ft boats come off the big lake when really windy because the passengers couldn't take the pounding anymore. I've been run off myself with a 1750 Tyee more than once, but due to comfort more than safety."
