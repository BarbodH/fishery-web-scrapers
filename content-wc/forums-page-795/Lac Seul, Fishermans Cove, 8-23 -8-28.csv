542370,Guest,2004-08-05 08:20:00,0,Been there done that. Go to Onaway. Blair and Kathy or excellent. Boats are nice. Honda 50 hp run great. Cabins are nice and clean. Grounds are well kept. Blair knows where the fish are.
542377,Guest,2004-08-05 13:26:00,0,"Fisherman's cove is an excellent choice. As mentioned above the grounds are nice. Dock space is good. Keith and Dan are great guys and they do put on a nice dinner on wednesday's. Have stayed there the last two years and will be back again next year. Fishing will be good no matter where you stay. Also gas and bait will be expensive everywhere.... remember you are in the middle of no where. This year we had motor trouble and Dan made one call and had us in the following morning, and when they couldn't repair us Dan had a rental ready to go for us. Great service! Have fun get them back in the water quick! Eric Peterson"

542225,Mark R,2004-07-30 07:17:00,1538,Don't expect a discount for bringing your own boat.
542237,thknboutretireinnfishn,2004-07-30 13:29:00,4,I sense a bit of frustration with place? Is it a good place to stay and fish out of?
542238,Guest,2004-07-30 15:10:00,0,"The resort is in great shape. Cabins and the grounds are very clean. On Wednesday they have a nice cookout for everyone. They give only a $20 discount for bringing your own boat. They still give you the gas (30 gallons)and minnow package (14 Dozen). The price is high for housekeeping plan, but if you check out Onaway Lodge, Lac Seul Lodge, or Scout Lake Lodge, you will see that their price is about the same as the other three resorts in that area of Lac Seul. If you want to fish that area of Lac Seul (and the fishing is great) I have visited all four of these resorts and Onaway, Lac Seul Lodge and Fisherman's Cove are all good. The cove might be the best of the four. Stay away from Scout Lake unless the other three are booked up."
542240,thknboutretireinnfishn,2004-07-30 15:49:00,4,"Thanks for the response Bor. I did have to pay for the full week, even though we are only going to fish 4 days. I found out later I could have fished out of Evergreen for a bit less, but the Cove got back to me sooner. This late in the game I guess I was fortunate to find a spot at all. Thanks again."
542271,Guest,2004-08-01 18:13:00,0,"I have been going to Lac Seul for 8 years. We stay at Scout lake resort but trust me,no matter where you stay at Ear Falls you will be fine and I have never been there that the fishing isn't great. I'll be there the week before you and the way I fish there's no problem with there being plenty of fish left. Have a great time."
542362,Guest,2004-08-04 21:10:00,0,"have made reservation at scout lake resort for 2005. Was a little worried when I saw the suggestion to stay away from Scout Lake Resort. Being you have stayed there, is it worth the trip? Hoping for details"
542365,Guest,2004-08-05 03:58:00,0,"Our group fished out of Scout Lake Camp for a few years; now we stay at Onaway. Onaway is much nicer, better advice on where the fish are bitting, and much better hospitality. Blair and Kathy really know how to run a resort. I am sure the others are great as well, but I also recommend avoiding SLC. Best of luck! Save some walleyes for us!...we go ont the opener every year when there are no bugs! and the air is crisp and cool."
542366,Guest,2004-08-05 05:45:00,0,Well I can see why some people may not like Scout Lake Resort. Rollie the owner can be grumpy but then I'm married so nothing scares me. The thing I like about it is the motors are new every year the boats are extremely well maintained as well as the cabins. Most of the people staying there have been there many times before and are more then willing to help with fishing spots although I've found that once you've found them there in the same place each year. Scout lake is really a fishing camp not a family fun things to do camp. I'm very happy with it.
542367,Guest,2004-08-05 06:14:00,0,"I stayed at Scout Lake last year because the other three resorts were booked up the week I could go. We rented four of the large boats and spent over $600 per person. One of the boats died, and died, and died.... whild backtrolling. We complained several times and he never fixed it. The docks were also an obstacle course. Some were floating high, and some were almost submerged. Up, down, climb up, climb down to get to your boat. We spent over five thousand at that resort, and the owner was about as rude and unfriendly as I have ever seen a resort owner being. If it rains, the resort is mud city, cuz their ain't no grass anywhere. Watch your gas...he is very expensive if you go over...also watch how much he puts in daily. Mistakes happen, but...watch closely! You can get the same large boat package at Fisherman's Cave for $100 less. You will also have nice landscaped grounds, a nice whole resort cookout on Wednesday, and friendly service. I have not stayed at Onaway, or Lac Seul Lodge, but their grounds look nice also. I would never go back to Scout Lake. We did have five of six days last year that we brought in over 100 walleye per day per boat. great area of the lake for fish, but better resorts."
