542349,Guest,2004-08-04 09:44:00,0,"WAS @ OGOKI/MOJIKIT 7/24 - 7/31. HAD ALOT OF ROUGH STORMY WEATHER MOST OF THE WEEK. FISHED THE CHANNEL AT THE MOUTH OF THE CHANNEL NORTH OF OUR CAMP (MOJIKIT CHANNEL S. CAMP) AND WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL USING 1/4 OZ. CHARTREUSE JIGS, MR. TWISTER 3"" CHARTREUSE TAILS, AND LIVE JUMBO LEECHES. ALSO DID WELL USING POWER LEECHES. FISHED THE DEEPER HOLES 20' - 30'. ALOT OF STUMPS!! PLAN ON LOSING ALOT OF JIGS. BY THE TIME YOU ARE DONE, YOU WILL BE AN EXPERT KNOT TYING SPECIALIST!! WHEN YOU FIND AN AGRESSIVE SCHOOL OF WALLEYE, YOU CAN THROW ARTIFICIALS LIKE WALLY DIVERS, REBEL CRAWS, OR SHAD RAPS. FOR THE NORTHERN PIKE, WE DID NOT FIND ANYTHING TOO BIG. LOT'S OF SMALL FISH IN ALL OF THE BACK BAYS. THEY WERE HITTING LOUD SURFACE BAITS, BUZZ BAITS, IN LINE SPINNER BAITS, BUCK TAILS, CRANKBAITS, AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE YOU THREW AT THEM. THE AVERAGE WALLEYE SEEMED TO BE IN THE 18"" - 19"" RANGE. I HAD MANY THAT WERE 20"" PLUS WITH MY LARGEST BEING 22 3/4"". LOOKED ABOUT 4-5 LBS. WISH I HAD THAT KIND OF AVERAGE WHERE I FISH AT HOME!!!! LOT'S OF FUN EVEN WITH BAD WEATHER. BEAUTIFUL LAKE/RIVER SYSTEM. MOSTLY TREES AND UNDERWATER TIMBER. I AM MORE USE TO ROCKY LOCATIONS. WHEN I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE ROCKY POINTS OR EDDIES, I FOUND ALOT OF WALLEYE. GOOD LUCK AND GOOD TIMES!! M.T."
