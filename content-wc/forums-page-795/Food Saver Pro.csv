542417,Guest,2004-08-07 10:19:00,0,Have been trying a paper towel to catch extra juice and it works real good make sure to place towel in bag deep enough to allow sealing and you should have no problem. Any suggestions on how to add a marinate to meat.
542428,Guest,2004-08-07 18:52:00,0,"The only way I can think of marinating meat is to get one of the vacumn jars, place the meat and marinade in and vacumn. Don't know if it would work but it sounds good."

541963,Guest,2004-07-23 14:44:00,0,"My father in law just purchased a ""Food Saver Pro"" and we thought we would take it on our trip this year to wrap the fish in. Has anyone ever used a FOod Saver for Fish? We usually just freeze them in freezer bags with water. But thought this might be handier? Any thoughts on this?"
541973,Guest,2004-07-23 21:31:00,0,I highly recommend it. Just ate some Lake Erie perch from almost 2 yrs ago and they tasted like we caught them last week. No freezer burn at all. really makes a difference with fish. Can't go wrong w/ it and its idiot proof(good for me).
541974,bubba800,2004-07-24 07:01:00,559,"Highly recommend it, no air and the fillets freeze nice and flat with the patch of skin exposed for identification."
541981,Guest,2004-07-24 16:31:00,0,"I second the previous responses. One of the best investments I've made in a long time. One hint though, I partially freeze the fillets, just to stiffen them up, for about an hour before putting the vacuum to them. This way no excess juice is sucked into the machine. winneconne"
541986,Guest,2004-07-24 20:38:00,0,all good ideas. no comparison to bags of frozen fish in water. been thing since the wheel. good ideas to frost the fish a little first. water at the seal can mess it up.
542005,Guest,2004-07-25 13:29:00,0,That sounds like a grat idea! thanks!
542024,Guest,2004-07-26 06:58:00,0,"Used to freeze in water all the time. Kept fish wonderful but took a lot of time to unthaw. We tried the foodsaver and it works wonderful. Second plus is that the fillets are easy to see with the patch of skin, if you get stopped coming back from Canada. Last year we were in Alaska and learned a trick from a neighbor at the campground. Take a light plastic bag like the produce bags on the roll at the supermarket (I use gallon Baggies bags) and wrap the fillets in this light bag first, then place the fillets inside your foodsaver bag....vacuum pack and seal. Works like a charm and you never have trouble sealing the foodsaver bag because of wet fillets. Takes about 5 seconds more to do and you can process the fish right away without partially freezing. We're still eating halibut and salmon from the trip without any freezer burn. Tastes great."
542041,Smitty,2004-07-26 09:33:00,1934,"I do basically the same thing with Cling Wrap or something similar. It's almost ""double protection"" and no waiting to vacuum seal. I used to do the water thing as well, but this certainly takes up much less room and as others have said fish identification is much easier."
542043,Guest,2004-07-26 10:27:00,0,Do you still get a fishy taste by leaving on the skin patch?
542412,Guest,2004-08-06 22:13:00,0,"Instead of double bagging, why not take one section of paper towel and roll it so that it fits the bag from side to side. Freeze your filets right away and the paper soaks up any excess liquid so it will not get into the vacumn packer. Works on any type of fish - walleye, panfish, salmon, pike, etc."
