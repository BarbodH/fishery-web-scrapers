542392,Guest,2004-08-06 07:07:00,0,"We are going up to Thaddeus Lake Lodge (in Ontario). Haven't been there yet, but have friends who go every year and usually catch 3-5 fish over 28"". We are going up 8-14-04 - 8-20-04. In fact, I think they still have room. Their 6 day rate is $540. I have also been to Anishinabi (in Ontario)(sp?) Duncan McGreggor was real nice and the walleye fishing was good on the portage lakes. No huge ones, but his rates are probably lower than Thaddeus. Been on 3 fly-ins, but that would be out of your price range. Anishinabi has good lake trout fishing (even in August),it also has northerns, but we only fished for Lake Trout in the main lake. Spent most of the time fishing the portage lakes for the eyes, which were plentiful. Good luck"

542433,Stu,2004-08-08 21:29:00,472,"Hey buddy, check out tall pines camp on Wabaskang. It is pretty close to Lac Seul. They have a house keeping plan that is around $400 (I think?) Saturday - Sunday. Boats and gas included. I've had really good luck w/ walleyes. I've also seen some BIG norhtern but we don't fish hard for them. If you have 2 adults in a boat, they have a good deal for kids under 16 - Good luck"

542314,Guest,2004-08-03 12:19:00,0,"Hello, I am hoping to get a trip in to Canada hopefully for the last week of august, and I was wondering if anyone had any lodge recommendations? I have been to Canada many times, but this year me and my partner's budget will be very tight, so I am looking to spend around 500 for between 5-7 days fishing for lodge and a good camp boat. I have been mostly to lac seul and stayed at Chamberlain Narrows, but with lodge and boat Chamberlain is 150$/day. How is does the the other end (ear falls) of lac seul compare with Chamberlain? Anyone with any suggestions for good deals (and good walleye fishing!) at Lac Seul, Lake of the Woods, or somewhere else? Thanks in advance, Poor Student"

542338,Rich J,2004-08-03 21:30:00,65,Check out Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. There rates are in line with what you are looking for and include gas and minnows. Cabins and boats are excellent. If they don't have any openings they may be able to direct you to someone who does. http://www.lacseulwalleye.com/
542357,Guest,2004-08-04 14:24:00,0,poor student I am always amazed that most everyone is talking lodges etc. fishing on lakes with many others and putting up with what all that comes involved with. If ya got the big money maybe that is for you folks. I have been in the rental business and other businesses for over 30 years and I can afford to fish those places--but I never have and never will. I fish some very remote lakes that are full of walleyes and pike and some lakes with lake trout and big very big pike. We sleep in tents if we camp on islands in the lake or a pickup camper if we are going to quad in for a few miles. We pay 10.00 for Crown land and on some Indian land it is 3.00 per night. These are remote lakes in Ontario that most don't want to drive their new truck on the terrible trails but that it what I bought the vehicle for and enjoy it in that manner. I have a Ramsey winch mounted on the front of the V-10 that came off a side boom of a pipe laying crawler. Have pulled the truck thru some interesting places. That is what makes fishing a little more fun for me--being on water where we are the only ones fishing. I realize this is not for the majority and that is as it should be. len
