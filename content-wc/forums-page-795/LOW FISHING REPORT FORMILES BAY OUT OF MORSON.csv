Have fished out of Sioux Narrows, King Island, but first time on Miles Bay. Lots of structure as in Sabaskong Bay. Any ideas of where to start in the middle of August. What type of presentation, baits, reefs or flats. Owner mentions North Island in Miles Bay, but my map does't show North Island. We have a group of 5 couples that are really looking forward to this trip Thanks"

If you want to travel I would definitely head west to the Firebag area. Work all the points and rock piles. Shouldn't have a problem finding the eyes middle of August. If you need more info I'd be happy to help you out."
