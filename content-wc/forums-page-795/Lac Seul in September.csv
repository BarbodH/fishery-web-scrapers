Fishing is good as usual, water temps are around 60 degrees and the fish are moving back to spring locations. June and Sept are about the same, my guess is May and Oct should be about the same fishing locations. In Sept, spinner rigs, jigs and cranks all boat fish. To me the fishing is better due to the fact the fish seem to be bulking up for the winter. I'll be back!"
542203,Guest,2004-07-29 12:41:00,0,"last year I skipped my annual Saskatchewan Goose hunt to fish Lac Seul the last week of September. The fishing was outstanding. We caught tons of fish with good size. The walleye were in more spring like locations with a few bigger fish on main lake points. Jigs out produced all other techniques for numbers. Trolling crank baits produced our biggest eyes. Notherns were on the outside edges of, what was left, of the weed beds. The northern were also on some of the points. Not too many fish on the offshore breaklines. There was hardly anyone up there. It was wonderful, however be prepared for some drastic weather. Things are changing up there about then, and we had some really nice days, but got a little snow one day. With the right gear weather shouldn't be a problem. Good luck"
542339,Guest,2004-08-03 22:19:00,0,Hi. we were up there once in the middle of september. We could not put on enough clothes. windy cold and rainy. only ones in camp and on the lake. I can see why no one goes up ther then.
542342,Guest,2004-08-04 06:26:00,0,We go up every year in May and again mid September. The weather and fishing is about the same both times. Cool days. Sweatshirt weather and not as many people to contend with. Perfect...enjoy
