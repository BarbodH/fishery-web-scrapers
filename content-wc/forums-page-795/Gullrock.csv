541677,Guest,2004-07-14 08:42:00,0,"Hey Vant, How many years have you fished Gullrock? What is the biggest fish you have ever caught on Gullrock? Has anybody ever showed you how to catch really big fish? Does it upset you when some idiot spills coffee in your boat? Are you really the second best fisherman to ever fish Canada? Is the name of your boat really ""Jimmys Bullhead Express""??????"

541711,Guest,2004-07-15 07:44:00,0,"Vant, You are my hero. I have never fished with anybody who has more natural fishing ability and such a fine touch with a hunk of IM-8 in his hand. Take it easy on Gullrock and leave some fish for the less fortunate."
542347,Guest,2004-08-04 09:29:00,0,WHERE ARE MOST OF THE BIG WALLEYES CAUGHT IN THIS AREA.
541444,Guest,2004-07-06 07:36:00,0,"We are heading up the week of 7/17, are there any recent reports out there? I was also wondering in the may fly hatch has occured yet? Thank You Jeff"
541469,Guest,2004-07-06 14:06:00,0,"Check the Red Lake post. Let us know how you do. I would like to know about the mayflies also. Last year we had a hatch, plus temps from 86 one day to 48 the next. Still caught fish. good luck, let us know, i go the 29th of July."
541560,Guest,2004-07-10 07:29:00,0,May flies are just starting we had 5 on the the lodge window this morning. Jeff have a safe trip up see you in a week.
541562,VANT,2004-07-10 07:37:00,68,"Hump 1, We will be at Gullrock 7/31 thru 8/7/04. Where do you stay? We stay at what used to be McEwen's on Two Island. Will be our 7th year there on the same week. Can't wait. VANT"
541565,Guest,2004-07-10 08:01:00,0,"Vant, Do you do any casting for pike? How do you do (size and quantity)?"
541566,Guest,2004-07-10 08:12:00,0,"We will also be at Gullrock the first week in August, staying at Poplar Point. This will be about my 20th trip, but first time in August. We do not typically fish for Northern, but will have several young men with us that are planning on doing some evening casting for pike. Any suggestions as to where might be a good spot on the south part of the lake and what lures might work the best. Thanks, getting goose bumps just thinking about it."
541567,Zim1,2004-07-10 09:36:00,17,Well there are going to be quite a few of us up there the first week of August. I'm taking 2 of my boys up there for our first trip to Gullrock. We will be staying in the Poplar Point campground.
541574,Guest,2004-07-10 19:22:00,0,I stay at what is now Wright's camp. I have been at Weaver's for 16 years. I go the same week as you. I fluctuate between the third week iof Jue and 1st week of August. Normally the first week in August is good.
541654,VANT,2004-07-13 15:00:00,68,"Hey Guys, Sorry I am so late with this post. Been busy. We mostly fish for walleye. Always seem to catch biggest northern while fishing for eyes. I know a lot of people fish the weedbeds around the Clay Banks area for northern. There is another big weedbed north of the Gull Rock itself that we sometimes go to throw iron. I usually keep a rod ready for northern in case one grabs a walleye on the way in. That happens to us quite often. And they are some big boys. I will have my boat up there. It is a black & silver Alumacraft Navigator 165 with 60 horse Mercury. If you see us come on over & say hi. Maybe we can share some hotspots. We fish the main lake humps and reefs mostly. Only 17 more sleeps before we leave. Took some younger boys up with us for a couple of years and they were always so excited to go that they referred to how many sleeps before we left. It has kind of stuck. LOL Later, VANT"
