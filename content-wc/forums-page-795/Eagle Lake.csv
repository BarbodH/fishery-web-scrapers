542282,Guest,2004-08-02 08:23:00,0,I need help. My husband and I are heading to the West arm of Eagle Lake for the first time. We are going to try for lake trout and walleye. I would appeciate any information you could give me on fishing for these two species on this body of water. Thanks in advance for your help.
