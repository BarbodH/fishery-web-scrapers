521441,Guest,2002-06-20 13:46:00,0,I am going to Grassy Narrows Lodge on the English River system the first week in July. I was wondering if anyone had a good lake map of Grassy Narrows and surounding lakes? Also if anybody has some tips on places to fish ect. I've never been up there before and would appreciate any help thank you.
