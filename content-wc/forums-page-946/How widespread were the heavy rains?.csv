I will say, although we have not been to Hamilton for the last two years as my Dad passed away and he was always there so we kind of lost our interest, but the last few years we went to Hamilton we caught many large walleyes compared to years past. By the way are you aware that camping on Crown Land now allows only a conservation license, meaning two walleyes per person each day? At a resort or north of Pickle Lake on campgrounds run by the town of Pickle, the traditional license still applies. Where is Separation Lake? The island camping is wonderful, although haven't done that since I was a child. Forty plus years ago we used to camp on an island on Wabasgang, up Red Lake Road. Went one year and someone had built a cabin on the island, we were devastated and the next year started going up 599, north of Savant.Happy planning."
521394,Guest,2002-06-19 19:43:00,0,"Was wondering, I know there is a campground on Hamilton, can anon resident pay to camp there , then go find a more private location, like an island on Hamilton, or do youhave to stay at the grounds."
521395,Guest,2002-06-20 03:03:00,0,"There is a campground at Hamilton, as in space to camp and place to launch boat, nothing official. You have to buy camping tickets in Savant Lake, or Ignace or Sioux Lookout, and they give you camping rights to any Crown Land. It is $10.00 per person a day for nonresidents. Sure you could find an island on Hamilton to camp on, not many that are comfortable for the purpose, but there are a couple."
521396,deehawk,2002-06-20 21:36:00,178,"bigwalleye, I was not aware of the license restriction for that area. Thanks for the heads up on that one! The conservation license is the only license I ever buy when I go there but need to pass that info along to the rest of the group. Separation Lake is on the English River near Kenora. They have a lodge or a campground where you can stay. We camp in tents when we go. Very good fishing but not as private as Minchin."
521383,deehawk,2002-06-14 05:43:00,178,Just wondering how far north the heavy rains fell. We go to a lake approximately 125 miles northeast of Sioux Lookout {20 miles north of Savant Lake} and the access there would be greatly affected by that much rain.Thanks for any info.Brian
521384,Guest,2002-06-17 19:25:00,0,"Just got home from white dog, rain was very heavy lake came up 5 feet while we were there. roads where open but some one lane travel we left on Sat the 16th lake still coming up, fishing was good lots of stuff in the water, I knocked my skag off."
521385,Guest,2002-06-18 03:30:00,0,"What lake do you fish? We are going about 50 miles north of Savant the last two weeks of July, was also wondering how much rain the area received?"
521388,Walleye Wacker,2002-06-18 05:28:00,6,Fished Lac Seul last week. Had rain the first three days but it only amounted to a couple inchs nothing like they had south of us. Fishing was great...two 30 inch Walleyes.
521386,deehawk,2002-06-18 05:46:00,178,"Bigwalleye, we fish Lake Minchin. It has a steep gravel access that could easily wash out with a lot of rain. What lake do you fish? Keith and Walleye Wacker, thanks for the replies and info!Brian"
521387,Guest,2002-06-18 11:42:00,0,"Hamilton Lake, just a few miles north, east side of 509. We have fished Minchin years ago, not the best camping accomodations, as you know unless island camping. Some of our party with small boats have portaged thru a tube under road into Minchin a few times. Beautiful lake. Great fishing the last few years on Hamilton."
521389,Guest,2002-06-18 15:43:00,0,"deehawk,Correction from earlier response, I meant Hwy. 599. Hamilton is approx. 5 miles n. of Minchin, access east side of road. We have also fished Fitchie, years ago which is south of Minchin. Do you camp out on an island?"
521390,deehawk,2002-06-18 21:09:00,178,"Yes, we camp on an island. Put in at the access and then boat to the other end of the lake. A nice little island there to camp on with a good place to dock the boat. Its not all rock so you can pound in tent stakes. I didn't make it up there last year but 2 years ago was there in early June and didn't do well at all compared to past years. This will be our first time there in early July. Normally we go in August. I'll have to check out my map and look for Hamilton. Do you camp there?"
521391,Guest,2002-06-19 05:02:00,0,"Yes we camp there. There are probably seven individual camp sites, some not too rocky, then also a large clearing, flat with sand. At one time, it was kept up, outhouses built etc. Last we were there, three years ago, outhouses pretty well dilapadated but still usable.When you first drive in you see a couple of cabins, locals live in.then keep going down road to the right. Great lake, really seems like three lakes after you know your way around. Not a shallow lake at all. Went there first about 25 years ago, was brimming with activity for awhile, but it has dwindled quite a bit as many people were bothered with theft, liquor theft. Talked to the conservation people in Sioux Lookout a couple of weeks ago and was told no one camping there has been bothered the last couple years. Can't wait to get out on the water again."
521392,deehawk,2002-06-19 15:53:00,178,"Evening bigwalleye. Say, do you happen to remember how the guys did that portaged into Minchin?? We usually get good numbers of walleyes but not a lot of size. The guys I go with on that trip don't fish a lot so they don't care. They just want to catch fish! It is nice camping by yourself on that island. We always wondered about theft problems leaving our pickup/trailer there by the road all by its lonesome but have never had any problems. Almost time to start the planning process. Also have a trip with some hardcores to Separation Lake in August. That is a good trip as well. Brian"
