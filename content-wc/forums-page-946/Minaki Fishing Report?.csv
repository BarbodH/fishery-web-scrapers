521503,Guest,2002-06-17 11:28:00,0,Me too.....what water level can I expect. Hopefully not as high as last year?
521504,Keith,2002-06-18 06:35:00,48,"I came back on Thursday of last week. Water levels were down about 4 feet from last year with very little current. The storm was interesting. Several docks were broke free including mine and boats were put on rocks. Fishing was good before and after the storm. The walleyes were chasing bait onto shelves in about 15 feet of water. Several people said it was the worst fishing but our group thought it was one of the best. Burnt Island, West Harbour, the Hat rack and the wash tub all had fish on them."
521505,Guest,2002-06-21 13:25:00,0,I fished from 6/14-6/19 and it was the best walleye fishing I've had since 1995. It didn't matter where you were. I caught all of my fish in under 10 feet of water using leeches and crawlers. The water level was super low on 6/14 but on Sunday 6/16 they opened the dam and now it is at record high levels with no end in sight. It went up 6-12 inches every day I was there. The consistent sw wind really hepled fishing and the increasing water level only seemed to help as well. Hated to leave!!
