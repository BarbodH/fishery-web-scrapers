You can even specify what city you will make your purchase in and the web site will provide the types of beer sold there. You can then click on the brand to get to pricing.http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ultimate/types_of_beer.aspThe following web site for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) can be used to determine prices for all size products.http://www.lcbo.com/Tight lines!
