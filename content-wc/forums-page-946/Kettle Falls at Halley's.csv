521711,Guest,2002-06-21 12:02:00,0,Was wondering if anyone stays at the Kettle Fall's camp. We have fished around the place and would like to explore a little further. We stay at Caribou Falls. I have seen places like sunburn island and that on the map.Any good spots to try would be appreciated and would help ease the long trip.The closest i have been is Poplar bay. Went into tourist lake for the first time this year but didn't have enough time to really fish it....Thank you.
