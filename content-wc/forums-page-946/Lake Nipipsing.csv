521595,Guest,2002-06-19 04:45:00,0,I will be heading to the West Arm of Nippising in about 3 weeks. The last couple years the water level has been pretty low. Boats UNDER the dock low. What is it like this year?Thanks!
521596,TangledAngler,2002-06-19 06:19:00,65,Just got back from there on Sunday. Water level is fine. Rained like crazy the whole time we were there. Fishing was a bit slow but I've been in contact with someone who stayed a couple extra days and said it has picked up. Pike are everywhere. Had to work a little for the eyes.Where ya staying?

521599,Guest,2002-06-21 04:42:00,0,"I really can't help with the walleye, we never find them in the same place from year to year. A good place to start, look for weed bays adjacent to deep water. We pull a lot of eye's from the weeds. Also look for the breakline between weed and rock. For walleye's I have had a lot of success with the color combo of black jig and gold fleck plastic. For smallies, start hitting any of the rock islands. Start shallow and work deeper til you find them. Try tubes, jig inside, crayfish colors. If you just want to catch fish, a white spinner bait with gold blades will catch pike every other cast!!Good Luck"
