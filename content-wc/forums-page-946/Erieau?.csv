521707,Homer,2002-06-21 08:38:00,1127,"The fishing report for Erieau ( http://www.erieaumarina.com/report.htm ) lists hot steelhead action, along with the occasional 10# walleye; however, this report has been known to be a little ""optimistic"" in the past. Has anyone been over there recently for either steelies or walleye?"
