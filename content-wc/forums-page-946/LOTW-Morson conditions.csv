We'll be comming thru Baudette & would like to know the road conditions on 72 going into Baudette then the roads from there thru Sleeman and then to Morson.We were there last year about the same time & the lake was high then. I had heard that the lake was low this year untill the storm came thru but haven't had a report since.Any info will be appreciated, Thanks"

All the roads were passable and I would expect they still are. There are about 4 spots between Sleeman and Morson where the water washed out the culverts and road. There was only one ""rough"" lane open in these spots and there was a 4-5 mile detour, so I'd allow extra time, but you should be fine. Highway 72 is open all the way to Baudette. When we arrived on June 9 the lake was about 18"" below normal, and it came up 2' during our stay, so expect the lake to be slightly above normal level. Amazingly, the fish bit fairly well throughout the storms and water level changing, so I would expect you'll do well if you get stable weather."
