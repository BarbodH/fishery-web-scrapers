521669,FOOTDOC,2002-06-20 19:42:00,139,I am heading up to this resort on July 2nd and am curious if anyone who uses this great site has any information regarding the lodge and the fishing. Any suggestions regarding gear for walleye and do you have any opinions on the quality of the guides? I appreciate the information.
