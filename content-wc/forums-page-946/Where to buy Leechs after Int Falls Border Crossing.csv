521024,Guest,2002-06-03 13:57:00,0,"Would appreciatte info on best place to buy Leechs after we cross into Canada at Int Falls....Thanks in advance,Todd"
521025,Guest,2002-06-03 18:55:00,0,"Is this the same Todd that finished in 2nd place last year on Dogtooth? If so, The Sheriff has the bait shop list ready to go. If anyone has a favorite shop that has the largest leeches, I would love to hear which one you recommend. I know of Witherspoons, Rainy Lake Sports, and The Great Bear Shell.The Sheriff"
521026,Guest,2002-06-04 06:08:00,0,Sorry Sheriff this isnt the same Todd. This is the Todd who will be going to Canada for the first time and needs any info that will insure some Walleye for a shore lunch.
521027,lunker99,2002-06-04 07:01:00,236,What area of Canada you heading to?
521029,Dave,2002-06-04 08:28:00,258,I'd recommend Rainy Lake Sports phone 807-274-6429. Mark Fontana has been good to us.
521030,Fishoil,2002-06-04 10:14:00,1277,"I'll second that, I get a big batch of minnows & leeches for our group every year. He always has them ready when we get there (I call ahead, it's a big order), and he gives us a very fair count on the minnows."
521031,Guest,2002-06-04 19:09:00,0,Which direction is Rainy Lake Sports from the border crossing.We head up toward Sioux Lookout and have always stopped in Dryden for our bait. Can't say I'm real happy about the leech size we have to deal with. If they are right in Ft. Frances I may be making a move this year.7 out
521033,Dave,2002-06-05 07:40:00,258,"Guide 7,Rainy Lake sports is east of Fort Frances on Hwy 11 before the bridge going over Rainy Lake. I forget the name, but they sell gas in front, big yellow sign."
521032,Fishoil,2002-06-05 11:55:00,1277,"After you go through downtown, you'll come up to the lake and make a 90 degree left turn. About 1 or 2 blocks further on the left."
521028,Guest,2002-06-19 10:42:00,0,"Second in quantity, but ahead of the Sheriff in biggest fish caught (and released).You can hold on to that Sheriff badge for another year, but just make sure you don't lose it - it'll look good on my chest next year."
