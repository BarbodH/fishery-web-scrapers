In regard of fishing all the guys (clients) that are back are saying fishing is the best they ever seen. Catch & Release was the way to go. Not that I had any doubt but McQ you were perfectly right with your previous reports; yo got a very reliable network. Thank you. So for those who wants to have the walleye trip of their life; Gouin is the way to go but just ask the outfitter that you're going to do business with, what did he do to counter-act the situation and the impact for his client if any impact."
