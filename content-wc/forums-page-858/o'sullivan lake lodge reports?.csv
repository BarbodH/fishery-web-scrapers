533348,Guest,2003-07-08 21:33:00,0,bruce - did you post a report on how you did at o-sullivan- if you did i missed it-please repost- how was the clova road? we are leaving for flyin out of clova next week- thanks for the info!!
533352,Guest,2003-07-09 03:00:00,0,"Just returned from a week at O'Sullivan. Lots of weather but mostly good as was the fishing. No wallhangers, walleye or pike, but plenty of numbers. Since most of the winds were Westerly, most of the usual spots were productive. Got into Clatouche four times. Got 4 pike in the 15 lb range and lots of walleye. Got the added benefit of encountering a black bear a moose and an eagle on various days. Already planning on next year's trip. As for the Clova Rd., because of the rain we encountered for short periods nearly every day, there were some rough stretches of washboard and a few washouts, but not as many as we expected. It took three hours from the main road to the camp which is just about average (for American drivers and about 1/2 hour longer than a Canadian driver in a Ford Escort might take)."
533362,Guest,2003-07-09 08:44:00,0,"we had a great trip to o'sullivan. we caught short (<17"")walleye everywhere and my two buddies caught trophy eyes on the last day. 1 34"", 10 lb. 10 oz. and another 31.5"", 8 lber. after pictures, both were released in good shape. we still caught enough keepers to eat daily and bring home our limits. we also caught a 38"" and 36"" northern. for our trip the clova road was fine after the first 10 miles which the last 2 years have been a little rough. of course we broke a spring on the trailer on the way in that russell repaired while we fished all week!! russell also retrieved our boat with a trailer of his own (we slid the boat off ours and onto his), and ""jury"" rigged our trailer so we could tow it into camp. this all happened at around 10:30 pm on the night we arrived and occurred 24 miles from the lodge..............he ordered and had 2 new 3-leaf springs brought into camp, installed them, welded the trailer back together and only charged us for parts. that is some extreme service and very kind. he really goes out of his way to help his customers. it seems every year we find him repairing someones ""bunny"" trailer. i guess this year it was our turn. Thunderstick, did you get walleyes up at clatouche and if so where abouts? we get up there one day each year but this year we didn't as we were concentrating on learning new water on the main lake. as always it was a great trip for us and we can't wait to get back next year!!"
533384,Guest,2003-07-10 04:36:00,0,"Clatouche, to me, is the essence of fishing in Quebec. Big and small pike are all over the place, with the bigger ones seeming to come in proximity to where the river opens into the lake. Walleye seem to be east, where the big rock sits, and points south of there and along that eastern shore and the islands. We have, on occasion, found bigger fish near the outpost cabin, in the current from the inlet but those times are rare and we concentrate on the main body near the river. We've encountered many moose on our way up the channel and this year was no exception. As an added bonus, we were headed to the outpost and just past the entrance to Beaver Lake, where the old picnic table sits, we encountered a black bear foraging near shore. Clatouche, this year, also happens to be the home of some eagles, and we saw their nest on one of the bigger islands. Just part of the fringe benefits. Other productive areas for us were Smith's Bay and the areas behind the big island. Just too many places to fish and too little time. We're already pencilled in for 2004. I do have a question for you. Why do you drag your own boat up that Clova Road? I've heard more horror stories about trailer and boat damage regarding that haul and for the price of a sportsmen's package ($530) you get a boat, motor, as much gas as you can burn, a license (and no busted springs)."
533392,Guest,2003-07-10 10:22:00,0,"thunderstick, thx for the input on clatouche. now i even more so wish we had made the trip up. as i said we have every other year. but like you said, to much water and to little time. we take our own boat simply because it is so comfortable. swivel seats w/arm rests, larger boat, and with a 25 horse motor we can really move around the lake. like most we fish pretty hard and after a week our weak backs would be quite sore w/out the seats. plus we have a trolling motor which is a great peaceful way to drag bait (bottom) on a beautiful quiet evening. it is alot of work to prep the boat (and trailer........)and as you've seen it can be pretty tough getting in and out. but we still bring it along. we have spoken of one day doing without all the car travel, boat and everything and flying from philly all the way up. nice to dream bout it anyway. as far as walleye in clatouche you mentioned where the river comes in. you mean at the big rock at clatouche ""main body"" just before you would head up the rest of the way to the outpost? i had hit them there one time years ago and always try it but never had repeat success. thx again for the report/advice. we can't wait...........at least we have the eagles season between now and then!"
533393,Guest,2003-07-10 10:44:00,0,"...and on Sept.28 the ""Iggles"" come to The Ralph to face our Bills. Hopefully this year's team will entertain us into January..."
533395,Guest,2003-07-10 11:21:00,0,"thunderstick, i'm sorry to hear your september 28th will not be pleasant."
533399,Guest,2003-07-10 19:15:00,0,I can't lose. That's the first full day of our annual week long trip to the St. Lawrence River for smallmouth. A Bills win is merely icing on the cake.
