Another guy at camp, at the same time as us caught over 400 as well, with four of those fish measuring 23 inches. Email me at [email protected] and I can give you more details on the lodge and the area."

It is a ""drive to"" lodge, but they are the only lodge on a series of 18-20 lakes. They specialize in smallies and have some fantastic fishing. Facilities and meals and first rate. Spend a few minutes on their web site and then call to have them send you a brochure. Tight Lines !!"

533343,Guest,2003-07-08 16:24:00,0,I was wondering the same thing!
533363,Tom502,2003-07-09 09:10:00,118,"Hawk Lake Lodge is about 15-20 miles east of Kenora along the main highway, I think it's 17. The lodge is south of the highway 3-4 miles on their private road. I haven't been there for a couple of years, but do want to get back for another visit. What I liked best was the fact that you could fish a different lake every day. Last time I was there they had 18 lakes where they kept a boat/motor. You would leave the main dock in the morning, motor to a marked trail, carry your tackle and lunch into the second lake and fish all day being the only person on that lake. Some of the lakes you access using a Kawasaki Mule down old loging trails rather than boating to the portage. I can't begin to describe what a class place this is."
