533365,Guest,2003-07-09 11:23:00,0,"Flying out of Ear Falls to Loree Lake on July 17th. Youngsters and 1st timers in group and anxious for them to have a good trip. Any fishing reports from Loree or nearby lakes would be appreciated. Lures/locations of fish/techniques? Suggested routes through Dryden? Good overnight places to stay in Dryden? Food shopping possibilities in Dryden. Thanks, Billyjo"
533371,Trailerguy,2003-07-09 14:13:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] I've stayed at the Timberland motel on Hwy 17 in Dryden 807-223-5395 it's not a bad value. There is a Safeway store downtown, and another large grocery store across from Walmart out on hwy 17 East. There's a Mc Donalds out that way too. I've never heard of your lake though. We travel Hwy 502 (north), then Hwy 17(East-West)."
533372,Guest,2003-07-09 14:43:00,0,"Trailerguy, Thanks for your response. The information will be helpful. I've seen your postings on the site before, and you seem to have much info re:the area. You are appreciated! Now let's hope we catch enough fish to ""hook"" the newcomers into a lifetime of good fishing. Bill"
533379,Guest,2003-07-09 20:41:00,0,Have not fished the area but have a lot of Canadian fishing experience. If you plan on doing any spin casting for Northerns get some Tiki Spoonfish spoons. Have been using for 35 years and swear by them . they have a webb site now...tikilures.com. Let me know if you want color recommendations as I just back from trying some new colors which worked great.

533426,phishfearme,2003-07-12 07:36:00,1242,"billyjo - there's a hugh, modern safeway in dryden and that'll take care of all your food need. we flew with lac seul/amik last year to their springpole outpost (had a great trip) and had considered loree due to some feedback i got from a ""regular"" customer of this outfitter - it was just too expensive. he rated loree as one of the best walleye lakes he's ever been to. you should have no problems catching lots. they are also excellent outfitters but definitly the ""high price spread"". just bring 1/4 ounce jigs with white or yellow 3"" twister tails and fish over rock piles or flowage and you'll do fine. some nightcrawlers would be good also. also, we usually stay at the trillium motel in ear falls. very nice place with lots of freezer space for your frozen stuff. - phish"
533428,Guest,2003-07-12 14:51:00,0,Thanks to all you guys (gals?) for all the help. You are appreciated!!! I'll post a report on our return. Bill
