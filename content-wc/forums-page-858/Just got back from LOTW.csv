We had trouble getting fish under 20"" (tough problem). Boated hundreds. Muskies were tough, saw plenty...hooked a couple...none in the boat. Still quite shallow. No weeds to speak of yet. WATER IS DOWN OVER 4-FEET! Plan accordingly. If your boat is over 18-feet, use the sand launch at Northern Harbor out of Kenora. The concrete ramp is too shallow. Tons of hazards out there...many rocks just under the surface. Get a new map too, since the buoys have all changed."

533261,Stealth,2003-07-06 21:12:00,93,Hi Mike I'm heading out to Pipestone on 7/18. Is the sand launch right next to the concrete launch?? Thanks
533304,Mike Michalak,2003-07-07 20:02:00,373,"Yep, right next to it. When you launch, there's a large sand bar to your left as you back up. Go straight out about 3/4 of the length of the dock and you'll be able to spin around. Good luck out there! We slayed them on jig/worm combos and trolling spinner baits."
533306,Stealth,2003-07-07 22:12:00,93,Thanks Mike It sounds like it's going to be pretty interesting in getting my 1900 ProV in the water. Isn't the dock next to the launch approx 100 ft or is that the one with the gas pump on it?? Did you have any troubles with your truck wheels getting stuck in the sand? Lin
533310,Guest,2003-07-08 07:30:00,0,Just got back from fishing out of Morson. Very good fishing the humps in about 17-20 feet. Also caught nice eaters in the weeds in 8ft. Only 7 weeks til next time . . .
533345,Mike Michalak,2003-07-08 19:16:00,373,"Lin, Make sure the truck is in 4WD. The big guys (Ranger 621s) were nearly up to their doors in the water. You shouldn't have any trouble. As for the dock, the gas pumps are one set over. Mike"
533349,Stealth,2003-07-08 21:49:00,93,Thanks Mike I just can't get over how low the water is... I'll post a report when we get back Later Lin
