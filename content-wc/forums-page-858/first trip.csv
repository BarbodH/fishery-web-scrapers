We will be staying at the South end of the lake where the Chukuni R. flows out of the lake. Will be there 7-19 to 7-26. Does anyone know what the water level is like? Where should we start off fishing, lake or river? Type bait or lures and presentation? What about running down the river to the English R.? Looking for eyes, smallies and northern. Thanks for any info you can give this Mo. Hillbilly. Brad"

The water is going to be low everywhere, look at the Wabaskang thread, you should have similar conditions. :)"
