Am assuming normal summer pattern by now, but would like to hear how people are doing and whether the low water (exactly how low - I keep hearing different reports) has changed the typical pattern at all. Thanks. Steve"

I think they may need some time to settle down after all the storms that went through the last two weeks. Sounded like Muskies were good. Heard of one group that boated two and had a few follows in one day. As for the water levels. The lake may have come up 6"" since the opener in May. At this time the lake is about 1 1/2 to 2 feet below the Canadian Coast Guard Navigational Charts. Be careful and enjoy. Look foreward to hearing reports when you get back."
533334,Guest,2003-07-08 13:58:00,0,Fished 7/3 - 7/6. Caught nice eyes (3 lb - 7 lb) in humps and reefs W & NW of Maintou island. Also caught nice eaters off weedlines in 8ft.
533337,Guest,2003-07-08 14:33:00,0,I have heard a report that the entrance to Obabikan Lake is difficult or almost impossible to get into due to the low water. Any info on this? Thanks
533346,Guest,2003-07-08 20:36:00,0,"Steve, I'll be with a group at Red Wing the 12th thru 19th. See you there. We'll have 2 Pro V's. Honda 130 and Merc 175. Give us a yell if you run into us. Rick"
533364,Guest,2003-07-09 09:27:00,0,"Thanks guys for all the reports. Glad to hear the water has come up and looks like the weather is stabilizing. We'll primarily be after walleyes, but also trying some muskie. I'll be posting a report after we get back, hopefully lots of good news! Rick, glad to hear you'll be there same time as us. We have 2 19' crestliners with Johnsons; staying in large cabin near the fish house/road. Will give you a holler if I see you. Good luck to you as well. Steve"
