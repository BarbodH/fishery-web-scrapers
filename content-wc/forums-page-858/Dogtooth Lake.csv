I would like to catch/release larger walleyes, if possible. What are my chances of that happening? Thanks!"

I find that the early bird definately gets the worm on Dogtooth in Aug. I fish the windy stuff during the day (only) with deep diving hard minnow baits. I use night crawlers along shallow stuff just after daylight. I never have to venture far from the park campsites to get into good fishing. I can't wait myself"
