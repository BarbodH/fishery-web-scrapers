533368,Guest,2003-07-09 12:09:00,0,Just got back from up north and the water is still way down. Had my boat in the water for 2 hrs and hit a rock and cracked the lower housing. Was able to mend it with JB weld and make it the week. There are lots of rocks showing up. People are marking them with bottles so keep an eye out for the bottles as you travel the lake. Staying on the main channel is a good idea.
