He has listings for all the bait shops in the area, and you can message him for his recomenndations on bait shops. He helped me to find a place to buy a license on a fly-in in June Larry S"

The Mahumba's Fishing Page that was mentioned is mine but I read this first so I can help you here. Or if you want to check out the bait shops in our area you can find my link here in the Canadian section. It's called Mahumba's Fishing Page: https://www.walleyecentral.com/links.shtml Roger Mayer."
