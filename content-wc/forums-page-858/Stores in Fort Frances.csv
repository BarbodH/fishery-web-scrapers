533278,Guest,2003-07-07 10:43:00,0,Will be heading through Fort Frances around 6:30am this Friday. Any stores open at that time for some last minute food supplies and beer/booze. Just need a good store and the hours they are open. Thanks
533313,Guest,2003-07-08 07:45:00,0,"There is a ""Safeway"" ( I think) grocery store that will be open on the 11 heading east from the border crossing. The Provincial liquor and beer stores ( separate stores several blocks apart) do not open until 9:00 a.m. I believe. -JBP"
