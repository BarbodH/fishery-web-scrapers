534905,Guest,2003-09-11 07:31:00,0,"Try Waynes Riverside bait and tackle. They have minnows, leaches, worms and license. The number is 807-223-2113. They are also a gas station, and there is another gas station on the south side of route 17 about a block or so east of the wood mill that has bait. Tackle is pretty slim in Dryden for a larger town that is in the middle of all this fishing,Wall Mart on the east side of town is about as good as any where. I have been at my cabin near Dryden for the last week and fishing has been tough because of the warm weather. A front is going through now, cooling things down and should improve fishing. Good luck."
