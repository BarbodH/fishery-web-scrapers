534932,Guest,2003-09-11 22:18:00,0,I am going to buy the precission trolling book from a online bookstore here in canada and I want to be sure I get the newest edition (number 7). Can anybody confirm these details with the new 7th edition that they might have. Spiral-bound - 152 pages Spiral edition (August 2003) Language: English Precision Angling Specialists ISBN: 0966301722
