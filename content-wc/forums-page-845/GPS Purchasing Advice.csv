534938,Bobby,2003-09-12 01:58:00,211,"I have a Lowrance LC-X15-MT, the model without the GPS. I would like to add a GPS to the X-15 or consider purchasing a stand-alone unit or possibly a good hand held. My main purchasing concern is with mapping. I would like a unit that would allow for a good background map AND, better still, also allow me to add my own maps to the unit. Here's the problem - I live in Manitoba. I see many units with US waterways and a few with Canadian streets. However, I would like one with Manitoba lakes. Has anyone seen such a mapping program and, if so, with which GPS units would it be compatible with? Further, are there any programs that allow you to scan your own paper maps on your home computer scanner and then download them into your GPS unit? Purchasing a GPS unit with Canadian (Manitoba) lakes/rivers would be great. Purchasing a program to allow me to scan my own lake depth maps would be even better still. Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. ""Hold on to the boat, boys, she's gonna ram us!"""

The basic map software was based on a locked in bit of software from info USA. We were told that this fall all Canadian units will come with new map software specifically suited to Canada. It may be wise to drop into your local retailers and check when this newer version will be released. The only shortcoming of the map from info USA was the inability to zoom detail closer than 8 miles - like looking at a better quality paper map. The underlayment was Canada supported enough though for us to use for our purposes. We also had detailed hydra charts from Trac Maps and between the two were very comfortable navigating everywhere. I'm anxious to see the new software and put it to use in more detail. You can use Map 6 to create your own charts for local waters."

I fish the border waters (have an X15MT with GPS) and it's a strange feeling to suddenly go ""off the map"" when I cross the international boundary."
