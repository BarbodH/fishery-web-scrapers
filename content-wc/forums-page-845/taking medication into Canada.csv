Very little diff between borders regarding pharmaceuticals - they may go by different names, but they are the same drugs. The boys at the border do have a CPS guide (a big book with pics of every pill made) in case someone may try to smuggle in a drug in another drugs bottle... Do pack a 'safety' backup just in case if you are taking daily pills, and be aware of the local facilities if you feel you are at any risk - especially those with bee/wasp/peanut type allergies... chris"
