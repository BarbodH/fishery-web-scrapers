The fishfinder I currently have is a Hummingbird Matrix 25 unit, maybe this happening is a good thing cause now i have an excuse to get rid of it, I havent been impresed with its performance since i got it. Has anybody else used this fishfinder (whats your view). So I am looking at getting a new one I would like eveyones experiances with there finders. I am open to suggestions. The finders I am currently looking at are either the Garmin Fishfinder 240 or the Eagle Fishmark 320. I would like to hear feedback on these two finders if you have it positive or negative. Thanks for your help"
