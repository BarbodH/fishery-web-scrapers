534866,Guest,2003-09-08 15:32:00,0,"I'm looking for some tips on fishing LOTW late September early October time frame. I've only fished the lake in May and July to date and have a houseboat trip planned for September 27th. I'll fish primarily for walleye however I wouldn't mind getting into the crappies and also may take a few hours each day to cast for muskies. I'm looking for locations (midlake reefs, shorline, etc.) best bait for this period and presentation. I usually head out to the areas around Cresent Island and Deadbrook however with the houseboat I'm flexible. Any help would be deeply appreciated."
