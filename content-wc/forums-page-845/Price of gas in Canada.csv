How much are you paying per litre in Canada? They are blameing it on the blackout, Iraq, a busted gas line in Arizona and probably Mars being so close to earth! Heading up to Gowganda Sept. 19th. Sure hope the price starts dropping after the Labor Day holiday. Good fishing...Dave"
534639,bigfish1965,2003-08-26 08:14:00,3210,Prices took off this week. Expect to pay about 80 cents per litre ($2.20 US for 1 US gallon based on exchange of 38%) These prices are expected to remain until AFTER Labour Day. Gouging knows no borders.
534698,Guest,2003-08-28 21:06:00,0,Generally expect to pay 33% more per gallon in Ontario in any given year.
534707,Guest,2003-08-29 14:13:00,0,"Gas prices in Thunder Bay right now (Friday afternoon) are 86.7 cents/litre ($Cdn.) Much of the northwest will be the same or slightly higher, though gas is usually cheapest these days in Dryden (high competition). Prices will undoubtedly go back down after the long weekend. Funny how these so-called ""random fluctuations"" always happen around long weekends. Scavengers!!"

534858,hoosiercanadian,2003-09-07 16:31:00,104,"Paid .89 cents a litre last week in Red Lake Ontario and 1.91 in Eau Clare Wisconsin , .85 cents a litre in Thompson, Lynn Lake Manitoba and .75 cents a litre around Winnipeg. Driving a suburban pulling a lund mr. pike, needless to say it was expensive for fuel."
