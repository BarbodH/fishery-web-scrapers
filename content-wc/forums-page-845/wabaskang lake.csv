533908,Guest,2003-07-28 21:50:00,0,"John, Thanks for the great info. I was glad to hear you made it to Keynote as that is one of my Dad's favorite places to go and we were kinda bummed about reports of low water. Staying at Gawley's for first time since our normal camp closed. I was hoping I picked a winner. I'd like to hear more about your trip to Lost Lake. I've never been there. Does Gawley have a store or do you go to one of the store's at the Falls for groceries. We were thinking of stopping at Dryden for Groceries.....Those big ole thrashing pike sure make the hair stand up on the back of your neck don't they? Thanks again for the great info. Andy"
533911,Guest,2003-07-28 23:19:00,0,"you'll love gawley's. ray and shari are wonderful hosts. i've been there four times. the price you're paying includes all the gas and two dozen minnows per man per day. they have a great fish cleaning facility with freezers and paper. if you want freezer zip locks bring your own. they have no sharpners or knives. the units have all the amenities except for tv. all the pots and pans you'll need. we usually take the cast iron ones along for shore lunches. DON'T miss out on lost lake fellas. ray will give you directions and a map. i've got the cordinates for the turns. travel north on 105 out of Gawley's 1. Waypoint TURN 1/ N50 23.542 W93 05.176/ ( once you make this turn you'll see a sign that says enter at your own risk...IGNORE) 2. now you're on an old railroad right of way. go about a mile ( +/-) and take your FIRST right and go to: Waypoint TURN 2 22-JUL-03 N50 21.905 W93 03.235 1275 ft 3. now the drive to parking area is 28 minutes at slow speed. as the crow flys its 2.9 miles from turn 2 to the parking area...i'll bet its over 3 with all the turns. we been there 3 times and always think we're going the wrong way...it's fun getting worries...but keep going to: PARK CAR AREA: 22-JUL-03 07:23 N50 19.445 W93 02.991 while the locals call it Lost Lake, it shows on the map as Dennis Lake. Once you park, you've got a half mile walk down a path to the boats. it's mostly downhill. (WHICH MEANS ITS UPHILL COMING BACK YOU PACK HORSES) we always packed full gear with beer and shore lunch stuff. others take just a pocket full of lures. you decide. its not rough walking at all but when you make two trips to carry all the crap it gets tiring. ray will give you a can of gas to carry. he's got 6hp yamaha's there. they worked great. Fish the rock/boulder shoreline immediately LEFT from the boat landing. ray will give you a map showing the hotspots. we usually did best along the rock/boulder. two years ago it was jigs and minnows backtrolling. this year all we took was crawlers. running back from the main island to the boat landing i noticed a big lake hump...3-5 feet surrounded by 20 feet of water. here's the waypoint for that. Fishing Area KIMS HOLE 22-JUL-03 15:11 N50 18.535 W93 03.094 1152 ft At kim's hole....we used crawlers rigged up on a hook with a brozne stamped blade as well as chartruese blade. we got 20 inch walleyes at 2pm. also some BIG perch 10-13 inches. i'd find ""kims hole""...and fish around that waypoint. you'll see the weeds on the spot and the thousands of minnows swimming around. if you're lucky, you'll snap the dead carp i let loose. LOL. another in our group did well bottom bouncing with crawlers. don't bother going to dryden for groceries. its out of your way. head right into vermillion bay for groceries and license. at Bratland's....ask for directions to the co-op grocery store. it's a block away from bratland's and has everything you'll need. and, their potatoes were excellent! bratlands is about 1 mile past the 105 north. in vermillion bay there is also a gov't liqour store to stock up right near the 105. buy there. in perrault falls, about a quarter mile from gawley's is a convenience store called dutchie's. it'll be on your left just before gawley entrance. they have all kinds of food, booze and fishing needs. booze there is about 3 bucks a case more than at vermillion bay...and bottles are more as well. but when the well runs dry mid week....its VERY nice not to have to drive 40 miles to vermillion bay to restock. if you take crawlers.........make sure they're packed in bedding. make sure there is not one piece of dirt or grass on the crawlers or you'll lose it at the border. but, they never even looked in mine. tell ray gawley you want to go to Lost lake early in your trip. he'll have a truck for you to use. it's tight driving in...and you don't want to scratch up your vehicle. he didn't charge us for using it. we told him we were going to lost on monday or tuesday of our week depending on weather. we had 75-85 everyday so we didn't have to watch the forecast at all. Here's the waypoint to a VERY nice bay where we hammered perch as nice as keynote using the above rigs. PERCH 23-JUL-03 13:25 N50 21.253 W93 13.091 1141 ft head straight out of the first narrows to it. it's about 1.9 miles use above rigs. plant in about 7-9 feet of water. reel slow...they're on the bottom. bottom bouncers work here well to. we got 18 inch walleyes, tons of 9-12 inch perch. good shore lunch spot there as well. there's a red cabin on the reverse side of the little island with a dock well out of the water. we fished about 100 feet off the dock and did well on walleyes at dusk. here's the waypoint to the perch HOTSPOT at keynote. anchor in 6-7 feet and toss toward weedline with above rig. bobbers worked great as well. put crawler down to bottom...about 3-4 feet. if they're not biting....put crawler down further. a foot made a big difference in bite. we fished many other spots on keynote over three days and none produced like this one. PERCH-2 25-JUL-03 13:56 N50 16.436 W93 14.839 1179 ft Here's the waypoint at Gawley's dock: GAWLEY 21-JUL-03 21:39 N50 20.851 W93 08.599 1137 ft tell ray karcher gave you this info. enjoy your trip. if there's anything i left out...i'll check back for your questions. john"
533927,Guest,2003-07-29 20:04:00,0,AB...REROG....I SCREWED UP (just a bit on the lost lake directions. no biggie tho. your first turn is off the highway 105 your second turn will be about a mile turning off of the railroad right of way. your third turn will be up a sandy hill road. then you begin the 28 minutes trip to the parking area. sorry for the confusion. john
533934,Guest,2003-07-29 21:56:00,0,Thanks again for the tips. Sounds like you had a great time. Looks rainy for the forecast for our trip. We're packing our raingear.Did you guys ever go to town for supper? Used to be a nice place in Ear Falls. BTW - Are you a G.B. packer fan?
533935,Guest,2003-07-29 23:16:00,0,"John, Great to hear you had a good trip also. I'm trying to remember where that was at that you had the northern break water by my boat...I think it was on the Big Lake on the North Shore, and you were in a red camp boat if my memory serves me correct. If that wasn't you, those guys looked like they were having a blast with that fish!!! The trip was great for us, with alot of good northerns caught. Everyone in camp was catching walleyes, almost everywhere they tried. I wish I could have went into Keynote but didn't want to chance it after the work it took first week of July. A friend of mine went down there and hammered northerns...several 38 and 39 inchers. Big Mike"
534448,Guest,2003-08-18 07:38:00,0,"heading to wasbaskang on sat. (8-23),i'm a first-timer to this water.any current reports?"
534464,Guest,2003-08-18 16:39:00,0,where you staying bbarn? i think if you read the stuff from trailer and big mike and some of the junk i posted for perch you're going to do well. don't be afraid to get into keynote. as i posted....we ran through there full tilt in 20hp 16 footers on Jul18-26th. it has great perch..and a waypoint is posted where we hammered em. j
534477,Guest,2003-08-19 08:05:00,0,"bbarn, I'm also heading up 8/23...yesterday I heard the fishing has slowed down considerably, obviously due to the high temps. Weather's been hot last few weeks, and the only rain was a 2 to 3 incher over two weeks ago. BUT, things will change drastically with a little wind and some cooler temps, so I expect that fishing will be great by Sat. Big Mike"
534478,Guest,2003-08-19 09:23:00,0,"we,re staying at kingfisher, i took some notes off some past postsand the way it sounds should be able to find fish. big mike, agree with you on how hot weather can turn'em off looks like theremay be a cooldown by the weekend. thanks for the info"

I'm working on a bear, still have a week to hunt, been seeing a lot of sign. It sounds like walleyes are still biting good on Wabby too. :) :)"
534809,Guest,2003-09-03 21:31:00,0,"I'm heading up to Wabaskang next week and we'll arrive on the 13th. We'll be staying at Lundy's Camp. This will be my seventeenth straight year on Wabaskang and I've been counting the days. Looking at the weather forecast for Vermilion Bay on the Weather Channel website, it looks like they are predicting a lot of rain and cooler temps for next week. That should bode well for the fishing."
534815,Guest,2003-09-04 11:46:00,0,"Trailerguy, Thanks for the congrats, but it was a hard to find fish. Week went like this: arrived Sat the 23rd to alot of negative reports on the northern fishing. Some of my buddies were there the week before and usually they hammer them good, but they were pretty tightlipped and not bragging like usual, so I knew the heat had things shut down. So, with mixed emotions I started casting for northerns. I admit that Sat and Sun were HORRIBLE for my boat, not one slot fish. So, Sunday afternoon I came into camp around 4:00 pm, drank a few Labatts and complained to my buddies that this was going to be a #### tough week. Well after a few hours we received a pretty good lightning storm, immediately after I hit the weedbed closest to Jim's camp. It was pretty windy and rough, so I shyed away from the usual jerkbait and tied on a very large bucktail. First cast was a 22"", then the very next fish was the 42"". After I broke the ice with that fish the fishing seemed to get better everyday, especially after the STRONG winds we had on Tues. I finished with three over 40"", not a bad week. The walleye fishing was very good for numbers, tons of 14-16s, but hard to find anything over 17-18 this week. I wish I was there first couple of weeks in Sept because there are alot of these walleyes that I'd bet will have a serious feedbag going. It has been a fun year on Wabby for me this year and hopefully next year I can squeeze one more week up there to make it 4 trips (I'll have to do some serious honey-do list work to make it happen). I am going to miss Dustin on the water next year because I think his job is finished after this year...He's a good kid and I really enjoyed chatting with him and even learned alot about a lake I thought I knew well. Dustin has a great awareness and respect for the lake and outdoors in general and is a great guy to have talking to fisherman on the lake."
534870,Guest,2003-09-08 23:47:00,0,"Big Mike, Years ago it seemed as though someone in camp usually caught a Muskie the two weeks I spent at Wabaskang. One guy even had one hang onto a Laker he was reeling in. The past few times I've been at Wabby have seen nor heard of any caught.Thought since you targeted Northern's you might've caught one or someone in Jim's camp might've caught one. I got to meet Jim this trip while visiting some old friends that were staying at his place. Did he get his dock all finished?"
534876,Guest,2003-09-09 12:36:00,0,"AB, I have never caught a musky on Wabaskang, but I personally seen one caught two years ago back in Moose Bay that was 36"", I also know one was found dead up in Aerobus bay around 4 years ago that was in the 30 pound range. If I was targeting musky I would fish the rock points and reefs in little Wabby, north bay, and Moose bay. I am sure that none of the weedbeds in the Big Lake or middle lake have musky in them...way too many hours spent casting for northerns and have never even seen one follow. However, if I spent a whole week and only casted rocks and island points I might be able to see one. As for the dock...spoke with Jim last night and the new section of dock is in and he's happy with it. How was fishing when you were there?"
534885,Guest,2003-09-09 22:38:00,0,"Big Mike, The fishing was really good the first week then fell off with high temps and full moon. We've always stayed at Jim's place for over 30 years on and off and were shocked to say the least when he called and said he couldn't fit us in due to low water levels and the dock situation.. No blame on Jim - I'm glad he called and let us know. Jim is doing a great job with the camp. It looked great.We went over there one afternoon and spoke to our old friends the Forbes. They have been going there since the 50's and can tell some good stories. We had a good time at Gawley's but it just wasn't the same as you can imagine. Since we stayed at Gawley's and I had some first timers with me that were hungry for Walleye and fishing, we fished big Wabby alot more than usual. Found the eyes sitting in 28-34 ft. of water. I usually catch them in 20 ft. of water. We caught some at 20 ft. but they were the 16 -17"" size.The eyes ran bigger than normal - up to 27"" - but no wall hangers though heard a report of a monster caught in the second lake ( 38"" ). Since we camped up at Gawleys I didn't spend too much time in Little Wabby. Went to Keynote once and got the 3"" of rain poured on us. Went to North Bay our last evening chasing Northerns and caught more pesky 16"" eyes than pike. Didn't fish Aerobus or Moose bay though I would have liked to fish the West end of Aerobus - have caught some nice pike there where the creek runs into the bay. Have also caught some nice pike in Moose bay but with the low water level I didn't get back in there this trip. Did catch some nice pike one morn in Middle lake by the old eagles nest. Had a good trip to wine caught a 34"" & 38"" pike and a 26"" eye out of the same hole within 30 minutes. The same hole has netted my family a 42"" & 44"" pike and a 32"" eye through the years. Indian guide Billy showed us that spot in the early 70's. - I was happy with the catch considering the low water levels threw me off my usual spots. I can remember in 1986 and one year in early 70's that water was low and fishing wasn't that good."
534300,Guest,2003-08-11 19:58:00,0,"bossco For the smallies, I mentioned a bay....it was actually behind a small island to the left of the second narrows. The weeds were scattered and made it easy to throw rattle traps (irredecent and silver). We could see a HUGE smally cruisin under and around the boat and tried everything to catch her but never could make her bite.....she would have definately been a wall hanger! Make sure you work the lure all the wat to the boat and then some 'cause they would follow and hit right at the boat. Most that we caught were in the 3lb range with a couple going 3 1/2. We turned loose a lot of smaller ones and lost quite a few ""keepers"". Good luck! Rerog"
534302,Guest,2003-08-11 20:06:00,0,"163, Tall pines is just a long cast from Gawleys. We drove throughthe camp and it really looked neat. If you're going to camp aka camper/tent be prepared for a steep journey from the dock. Also heard from a guy staying at Gawleys that he used to stay there but they weren't very accomidating for ""famlies"". As for Gawley's, the bathroom and shower facilities could have used some work.....sure don't want to have too many of those Blues before you decide to take a shower cause if you tripped you might roll all the way to the other side of the building LOL! It needs to be jacked and blocked on the shower end...kinda leaned a little. Rerog"
534305,Guest,2003-08-11 20:49:00,0,"TGuy, that red cabin is on a small island in wabaskang...not keynote. to get to it..come out of the first narrows and go straight. pass the big island on your right...and continue to the next. you'll see the maroon/red cabin there with the dock/tire. fish in the bay behind the cabin. we hammered perch there. but, aren't perch everywhere? seems like no one has trouble finding them. j"

534333,Guest,2003-08-12 18:07:00,0,you're correct Tguy. We got some nice 12 inchers there as well as 17 inch eyes and bass. also snagged a clam and turtle. j
534341,Guest,2003-08-12 22:49:00,0,Can't say that I walked up to the Cabin on Keynote this year but there used to be two cabins there almost side by side in the south east bay. They were once owned by Jim of Jim & Gerts Camp then sold privately to a Dr.
534374,Guest,2003-08-13 19:25:00,0,"Trailerguy, FYI - We saw several bears at the dump so they are in the area. One was a big Cinnamon. Good luck - wish I could go."

534380,Guest,2003-08-13 21:35:00,0,"Man! this string has had nearly 1450 views! Trailerguy, what does it take to get a bear tag up there???? Do you know anything about non-resident Moose???? We saw a big one up close and personal last week and my dreams of an elk hunt have suddenly changed to moose! Rerog"
534383,Trailerguy,2003-08-14 06:21:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Bear and moose for nonresidents have to be hunted for the most part through an outfitter. Moose in wildlife units, bear in the outfitter's bear management unit. There is a provision for immediate relatives of residents that allows them to hunt with the resident. Also a little known provision that lets nonresident property owners hunt. I had to provide the MNR with an affidavit proving I was the legal owner, and then a copy of the deed, filled out a form, then paid the nonresident license fee, waited about a month and then they sent me the paperwork and license to hunt anywhere in the wildlife unit. If I want to hunt adult moose, it's about the same thing, just to get in the pool, for a chance to be drawn. Anyone can purchase a license for a calf I beleive."
534158,Guest,2003-08-05 10:37:00,0,"eman, kingfisher is right across the bay from gawley's. its a nice place too under new ownership. here's a link to a lake map. you'll note keynote on the bottom. it's NOT a far ways to go...maybe 25 minutes by camp boat. it's worth the trip.http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/lakemap.html also in my previous post you'll note a waypoint for perch spot not on lost lake or keynote. have you got a gps? if not.......head out of the first narrows straight past two islands that will be on your right. there's a small bay with a red cabin on it...that has a pier thats well out of water. the pier has a tire on it well out of water. fish in the bay opposite the pier. tie up in 7 to 9 feet of water for perch. they nailed crawlers all day...except when it was very hot. the trip to this spot is about 15 minutes. smallies are good near the second narrows along the shoreline. don't go through the tall weeds in the opening...but fish the weedy area on the other side of the second narrows opening. hope this helps. gl. jka333"

534281,Guest,2003-08-11 08:27:00,0,"Bossco, Just got home from Wabaskang a couple of hours ago......Man! 22 hours is a long ride with 4 big guys in an extended cab truck! I'm pretty tired right now, but I will fill you in on a few things. The Walleye fishing was AWESOME Saturday(Aug.2) through wednesday(Aug 6) We got there saturday at 1 p.m. and was on the lake by 2:30. Found fish just to the left of Devil's point in feet of water. All Week if they were in 27 to 32 feet and 3 to 5 feet off of the bottom they were biting. We froze our 4 person limit of over 18 inchers in 3 days. Used a Kramers Lake Jig with a small propeller tipped with a minnow (dead or alive didn't matter) while back trolling. They hammered them all day, cooled off from noon till 2 and back on again (perfect time for that shore lunch). We literally TORE UP the smallies! Look for moving water with rocky shores and they will be there. Caughtem mostly on Rattle Traps and night crawlers with a bobber. Two spots....one is the first bay on the left as you come into big Wabby, it has a hard rock bottom and you scattered weeds, you can actually seemem' smoke the traps! If you are staying at Gawleys or Kingfisher and want to save gas just motor right to the foot of the falls and throw a bobber with a dangling crawler and hold on.....a pumpkinseed culprit texas style works too. As for Pike.....we threw a bunch of nice 25+ and slotters back while trolling for Eyes and was regretting it because the bite was off Friday and saturday. We did haul in a couple of 38 inchers from wine though (plus a few 25's). Perch....we really didn't try too hard, but whenever we were casting for pike and saw the jumbo's chasing the lures we threw out the crawlers and took quite a few. Good luck and if you need more info let me or AB know Rerog"
534283,Guest,2003-08-11 09:28:00,0,rerog...... sounds like you had a good trip! did you make it to keynote or to lost lake? john
534295,Guest,2003-08-11 18:45:00,0,"Didn't make it to lost lake. The walleyes were biting so good early in the trip on Wabaskang didn't see the need. Caught most around Devil's point and Doe Island in 30' of water. They were deeper than I've been accustomed to but better in size. We caught smaller eyes in shallower H2O.Used jigs with minnows and crawlers with same results. Got our 4 man limit of smallies and threw back some smaller ones. They were in the rocks in shallow water.Mostly used rattle traps on the smallies. Made the trip to Wine and concentrated on Pike and landed two 38"" plus lotsa smaller ones and some slot fish.Saw a cow moose with twins on the portage route. Pat's bay didn't produce for us nor did the North shore of big Wabby although two boats were there when we pulled up. Went to Keynote one day and fished for @ 30 min. before a storm rolled in and dumped 3"" of rain on us. Did manage a few pike and some nice perch there. Fished for Northern one eve. In McCleod's bay ( North bay as I call it ) caught more eyes than pike. Saw a big bull moose along hwy. near Sunset restaurant. FYI for anybody going - take a spare prop and a spare gas tank.. don't ask.LOL. Fishing did taper off near the weekend it was hot and a full moon."
534298,Trailerguy,2003-08-11 19:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I just returned from a long weekend. We got our jumbo perch, around the corner, in the bay just beyond the first narrows, no sweat. Picked up our eye's close by also. We made one trip down to Keynote, I think I was down that far only once before. Somebody here was talking about a red cabin with a tire on the dock, and I was curious, because there's only one cabin on Keynote. Sure enough, the cabin is still brown, and no tire. :) But there were nice eye's nearby so we didn't need to stay long. :)"

Especially if AB is around, that guy has some serious issues at times LOL! We sure appreciate all of the info. Andy and his dad have been to Wabaskang many many times since around 1970 or so but this is my first time. I always headed south to Okeechobee Lake on our family vacations. My Grandpa owned and ran Clewiston Marina in Clewiston Florida till about 1987 when he sold it to Roland Martin and retired. So as you can see I'm very excited about switching from Largemouth, Crappie, Bream and S####crackers to Walleye, Pike, Smallies and Perch. Always wanted to go north but family always in the deep south. My uncle still guides down there since he quit trying to win the classic. Lucky guy, Lori Morgan is one of his regulars!!!! Anyway, thanks alot for all of the help! Roger"

533990,Guest,2003-07-30 22:47:00,0,"John, We're from Southern Indiana. I also own a Cabin in the U.P. of Mich. so I get through your neck of the woods often. Green Bay fan from birth and the trips through Wisconsin only fuel the fire. Going to KC game at Lambeau in Oct. Spent the night there (Madison)last month at Holiday Inn. We catch a lot of eyes in the U.P. but Northerns don't stack up to those in Canada. Looks like it's been raining and continuing to rain for next week in Canada. Hope that doesn't throw the bite off.I myself have caught some nice pike off the North shore of the big lake too. Indian guides showed me that spot many years ago. I can remember years that we slayed the walleye in Keynote and other years they weren't there.Our biggest pike came from Wine. Maybe I can give you a few spots on Wine to try for next year. One of these days I'm gonna go hunting up there. A.B."
533992,Guest,2003-07-30 23:23:00,0,haven't heard anything about tall pines but its just a 7 iron away from gawley's. looks nice as we drive by it. here's a link to their site.http://www.tallpinescamp.com/mapmain.html ab.......make sure you try devil's point...right across lake from north shore....not much help...but run over there you'll see guys off the point. very good for eyes and northern. great structure. post your report when ya get back! rain won't hurt ya........but mid day heat shut things down for us on one or two days. even perch shut off. sok tho......we hit the fridge for beer and manhattans. have a safe trip. if you get any spots......mark the gps! john
533993,Guest,2003-07-30 23:25:00,0,my first trip into wine lake ab...........we stayed in the ranger station over night! if you get up there....my business card may be among the collection! along with the can of beans we left for wayward fisherboys. j
534025,Guest,2003-07-31 23:27:00,0,"John, I've stayed in that rangers cabin too. @ 1977 got ate up by mosquitos.Won't do that again. Fishing off Devil's point one year on a clear, windless, day, I saw a variety of lures hung up in the rocks on bottom. Too many soda's in my system - I decide to dive down there and retrieve them. What looked like 10ft of water was probably 15 ft. it was cold down there too. Did get a rusty Cisco kid though. If I can pole that Naden through the narrows to Wine I'll look for your card. -I'm outta here!!! Will report back in two weeks. Nice chatting with you. A.B."
534090,cough6609,2003-08-03 20:03:00,48,"Hey Trailerguy, Been going up to Canada for 32 years. Fished Lac, Wabaskang, Wabigoon, Pashkagogan and flew in a few years to Miniss. Really enjoyed our years at Wabaskang but never got into the big northern there. What's the secret? Most of my group is also from Iowa (Urbandale for me) I understand that the owners of Jim & Julie's Camp are from Waverly. I've enjoyed the ongoing post and makes me think it may be time to go back and give the lake another try. Thanks, Craig"
534095,Trailerguy,2003-08-03 21:15:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Yes, Jim and Julie are from the Waverly area, Jim's brother, Big Mike, posts here too, after he's been up there. The big pike are there, depending on what time of year, they relate to the weeds near deep water most of the summer. If you have a map of the area, there's a lake out on Aeurbus Road. On the map it's either ""hog"" or ""sand"" lake. It's known locally as a Pike lake. It's about 5 miles southwest of Wabaskang as a crow flys. I'm getting organized to head up there again for a couple weeks, I have a bear tag, and season opens the 15th. :)"
534141,Guest,2003-08-05 00:44:00,0,"headed up there the 15 with family. we are from sheboygan, WI (go packers) and will be staying at kingfisher resort. i read all the posts everyone has posted but was wondering if theres anything else i should know. looking at a map, keynote looks like a long ways, is there any place closer without sacrificing the perch output? also, what about smallies, where the hot spots for them. first time at wabaskang and any help is much appreciated. thanx -eman"
533938,Guest,2003-07-29 23:41:00,0,"big mike........ you're correct...it was on the north shore. i'm certain it was a red crestliner with a husband, wife and two kids. i was going to say hi big mike....as i had read your earlier posts about the boat and family....but didn't wanna seem like a dork. we were in the red naden camp boat. AB........we never went to town for dinner. i took my cookshack smoker oven up...and did a 7 pound prime rib one night.....and 6 full racks of ribs the next. if anyone knows anything about restruants in the area it'll be ray. he's been there since he was a kid. gl up there this week...and post your report when ya get back. and you're right........GO PACKERS. where u and rerog from? john"
533940,Guest,2003-07-29 23:42:00,0,"mike, if you go again........try to borrow a camp boat. we ran those narrows into keynote full tilt with a 20hp. barely drew silt. john"
533941,Guest,2003-07-29 23:44:00,0,mike........your wife took a video or picture of you after you boated yours. we were still fighting ours. john
533943,Guest,2003-07-30 00:50:00,0,"Yep, I remember that...alot of high fives and hand shakes...it was an awesome looking fight. Hope my two boys weren't too loud for you guys, alot of my friends said they knew when we were on the lake because of the screaming and yelling (sometimes the boys...sometimes me AT the boys) I'll be back up Aug 23rd and hopefully water doesn't get any lower...might consider shooting down to keynote in a rental if things aren't snapping on the main lakes. However, usually on this trip we never go down to keynote because fishing is just too darn good everywhere else."
533442,Guest,2003-07-13 19:16:00,0,Big mike... we're going up on the 19th for a week. keynote was always fun geting huge perch. we fished just to the right after you got into the lake. we take 20 footers in with 20 horse....that shouldn't be a prob with the low water should it? advise pls. you get up to the northeast on wabaskang near the portage to wine lake at all? wondering how that part of the lake did. we're mostly going to do crawlers and leeches....any adive more than welcome. thanks a lot. john
533487,Guest,2003-07-15 02:13:00,0,"John, 20 ft boats with 20 horse motors should be fine, one trick is to put as much weight towards the front to help keep the prop up higher. I've never used leeches or crawlers alot for walleyes...mostly just minnows up there, but this time of year they are in weeds and probably aggressive enough to take any live bait...don't be afraid to cast rapalas and other crankbaits into these weeds either. Finally, the area of the lake up by the portage is usually VERY good for us on walleyes. Fish the sunken islands towards the middle of that portion of the lake with just about anything, jig/minnow and lindy rigging work best for us. There are alot of 24-27 inch northern that hang out there as well. Good luck and if you see a red crestliner w/wife and two young boys...its me. Later, Mike"
533554,Guest,2003-07-16 23:05:00,0,thanks for the info mike. i talked with gawley tonight. he said fishing is picking up after the may fly hatch. he said some guys did 3 baskets full of perch in keynote although they had to trim up as the stream south to the lake is low. he said forget potatoes....guards will take. if you're taking crawlers he said make sure they are in bedding and not any dirt whatsoever or they will be taken as well. i'm taking up a flat and will give em all a bath and put in fresh bedding before we hit international falls. i'll post the report when i get back on the 27th. heading up on the 19th. we'll be in some sort of 18 footer.......with a 20 horse yamaha. good fishin all and thanks for the help. john
533575,Guest,2003-07-17 18:29:00,0,"John, Can you tell me what part of the lake keynote is? Been going up there for the last 4 years, never heard of keynote. thanks pete"
533581,Guest,2003-07-18 05:37:00,0,"Pete, Heading up in an hour so I won't be able to respond anymore. But here's a link to a wabaskang map. You'll see the lake very easily on this map. we always hammered the perch in keynote. in fact, if they were 12 inches or less........we threw em back! ROUTINE 14 inch perch and I'm not kidding. hit on minnows or crawlers. Gl....and i'll post on the 27th with results.http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/lakemap.html"
533842,Guest,2003-07-26 17:59:00,0,"What's the latest on Wabaskang? I hear the lake is down 5 ft. and Jim & Julies camp is closed due to low water conditions. Other camps have had to extend they're docks way out to access water. Keynote, Moose bay, and wine lake trips are out due to navigation/low water. Going up Aug. 1st would appreciate any info."
533863,Guest,2003-07-27 23:53:00,0,"Just got back from wabaskang and had a GREAT trip. I stayed at Gawley's just off the main highway. I took a 36"" and 33"" pike on a 5 of diamonds. Big Mike....I believe you were right next to me in the crestliner with your wife and two kids and landed one at the same time I did. You commented that you had a twin to mine on at the same time. The 36 incher broke water twice right by your boat. Water levels were down about 4 feet but it had absolutely NO impact on travel anywhere on the lake. Gawley's has 18 foot boats with 20 horse yamaha's....and we ran full speed through the first narrows. We could've gone to Wine lake....but Gawley said it would be a little slow going. He also said that about the trip into keynote...but we ran full speed through the narrows into keynote and had no problem whatsoever. we had two per boat and full gear. we slaughtered the perch in keynote (surprise huh ?) we had our best success on walleyes and perch using a single hook with a any color blade. chartruese and hammered gold worked the best. we used crawlers all week for both species and never used a minnow. We took 127 perch and none kept were under ten inches at keynote. we fished in 7 feet of water and threw to the shore weeds and also used bobbers with bait to the bottom. Here's the waypoint for a HOT spot on wabaskang. we NAILED perch here using bait descibed above. also caught walleyes at dusk: N50 21.253 W93 13.091 Here's the waypoint for the HOT spot on Keynote. N50 16.436 W93 14.839 good luck and if you had any other questions fire away. john"
533864,Guest,2003-07-27 23:59:00,0,One other thing. We had NO problem crossing the border at Fort Frances at 9am. They asked if we were carrying potatoes....of course we weren't as we were informed on this board they would be confiscated. We took in 500 crawlers....they didn't even ask to see them! They were packed in a cooler in bedding.
533880,Guest,2003-07-28 10:24:00,0,AB.... if you're going to gawley's make sure you make the day trip to lost lake. it shows on the map as Dennis lake but the locals call it Lost. ray can set you up with directions. it's just 45 minutes from his camp off the main hwy. use crawlers with gold blades. here's the waypoint for a midlake 7foot hump that produced 20 inche mid day eyes and plenty of perch. n50 18.535 w093 o3.094 GL john
533887,Guest,2003-07-28 11:50:00,0,"just looked in our log book. also hammered walleye and pike on a storm, wild eye swim bait Shad. gettem at gander. john"
533263,Guest,2003-07-06 21:58:00,0,"Yeah!!! Those fish hammer Suicks up there. I mostly chase northerns when my wife is with me, but spend alot of time after eyes when I'm back up the last week of August. Devil's, Birch, basically anywhere out on the Big Lake. One thing interesting last week was the lack of northern activity in Pat's Bay, that's usually pretty good for me this time of year, but didn't raise anything with any size. I'll keep my eyes peeled for you on the water in a few weeks if you let me know what your fishing out of. Later, BigMike"
533302,Trailerguy,2003-07-07 19:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Big Mike, I usually fish out of a 14' boat with a 15 hp merc., or if the family is all there we use my pontoon to putz around on. Pat's bay isn't familiar to me, but maybe we call it something else. I'll be up again sometime in August, but I'm not sure when yet. Good Luck the 19th."
533303,Guest,2003-07-07 19:47:00,0,"Trailerguy, Pat's Bay is the large bay just northwest of the big Indian Cliff in the middle lake. It's got about a 250 ft opening then goes back to the right about 1000 ft. It's usually pretty awesome when the wind is pounding into it. Also, with the low water, ignorantly made a trip into Keynote...bad mistake. I stayed on plane the whole way through the narrows until I got into Keynote then hit mud bad and had to go idle for almost 30 minutes to get into water over 1-2 ft. Didn't catch much either once I got down there. Well, I'll let you know how the trip goes on the 19th...Big Mike"
533312,Guest,2003-07-08 07:42:00,0,"trailer guy and mike....... thanks for the info. i'll try to hit some of the spots you mentioned. sounds like i need a suick as well. color? we're runnin up with crawlers and plan to use leeches. i suspect the eyes will be off minnows. mike, we'll be a galleys on the 19th. they'll be 4 of us in two of his 19 footers. you'll know its us......tippin brews and fishing. i'll watch for your red boat. we got the beer....you show us the spots. if you're near galleys'......stop in. ask for he guys from Madison, Wisconsin. we'll hoist one. you to trailerguy. thanks John"
533326,Guest,2003-07-08 11:36:00,0,"trailerguy, we're heading up through international falls. should we go into dryden then west to vermillion bay (stop for license) OR....is there a quicker way than going to dryden. we're not hauling any boats... john"
533333,Trailerguy,2003-07-08 13:49:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I like to run up 502 then turn LEFT (west)at the stop sign, on 594? It's a little blacktop that turns into gravel for a few miles. There's one corner you follow the left curve again, rather than going straight on the gravel,just follow the 594 signs. Immediatly after crossing a cement platformed bridge (1st one) turn right(north). It will take you to Hwy 17, I think it's called Grifth's road? It's the closest staight through road that leads from 502 to Hwy 17 west. It takes you about as far west as you go east to Dryden the other way. There's a bait shop on the south side at Eagle River, plenty of places at Vermillion Bay, or even Dutchie's store in Perault Falls to pickup a lisence. Have a good trip! :)"
533336,Guest,2003-07-08 14:31:00,0,thanks TG. Are you going to be up there 19-26?
533338,Trailerguy,2003-07-08 15:19:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Unfortunatly not, gotta work to play in August. :)"
533417,Guest,2003-07-11 13:28:00,0,"Big Mike, Finally got a chance to catch up on fishing news and saw your posts about last week. We were at Jim and Julie's also (Black/Silver Lund Pro Sport from Michigan) and talked to you a couple of times down at the dock. Like you, we didn't do as good as usual on pike but did pretty decent on walleyes. 8-10 ft. in the weeds-if you can find them. We should have warned you about the trip into Keynote-it's no fun right now. Fishing was slower than normal for us there, too. Heard you had a little struggle getting your boat out of the water. Good luck on the 19th and tell your brother ####o. realestatedave"
533420,Guest,2003-07-11 16:26:00,0,"Spoke to guys up there that got back today, did really well off weeds and points mainly in the middle lake for numbers of walleye. A couple 40"" northern to boot. Should be good week the 19th as I feel the weeds should be out in full force and active with alot of bigger fish. realestatedave...it was nice meeting you and your wife, hope to see you next year...and your right, that trip to keynote was not fun (but I didn't have my own private tow boat taking me through like you) ha, ha, talk to you later."
532878,Guest,2003-06-25 18:18:00,0,anyone have any reports on the fishing at wabaskang lake in perrault falls? thanks a lot john

532888,Guest,2003-06-25 23:38:00,0,good luck to ya! you staying at gawley's? drop in a line on your results when you get back and let us know what worked. i'm heading up on the 18th of July for a week. john
532891,Guest,2003-06-26 04:58:00,0,Be ready for some extremely low water conditions. We just got back from Gullrock and our camp owner was saying that most of the lakes were down and they were measuring the lack of water in feet not inches. Lake of the Woods is down 43 inches and I heard that Lac Suel is down 52 inches. I realize that this is hearsay but you might want to be prepared. As we went past LOTW you could see the drastic change in the water marks left on the shoreline. Have fun and be safe. Renn
532894,Trailerguy,2003-06-26 06:52:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] I have a cottage on the SE side, we're packing the truck right now. We'll be there over the 4th July week. When I was there a month ago my dock was 4' out of the water. They got 1.3"" rain yesterday so the bush shouldn't be so dry."
533027,Guest,2003-06-30 00:27:00,0,I spoke with ray gawley a few weeks ago and he said water levels were down about 3 feet. wondering what that means for fishing? post your reports when ya get back guys. i'm going on the 18th of july. good luck and have a safe trip.
533134,Guest,2003-07-01 23:36:00,0,Just got back from wabaskang fishing had slowed down due to mayfly hatch and water was still way down.
533251,Trailerguy,2003-07-06 18:44:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] I just got back, fishing was good. Doe Island, Birch Island, and mid lake humps, all produced. One night we had a bad storm, really lit up the sky for about a hour at 2 AM. the next day they were off the bite. Rained a lot last week or so,probably 3"" total. Lots of mayflys in the air at dusk, we still hammered them, 6-10' at dusk and 20'-25' in midday on the humps. We always go up over the 4th, and the mayflies never have bothered us, you just need to find the fish. We had good luck on nice sized Pike the night the eye's didn't bite. 15-18"" Smallies were also hitting in a nearby lake. :)"
533253,Guest,2003-07-06 18:54:00,0,"Hey Trailerguy, i was on the lake also last week...red crestliner fishhawk with wife and 2 LOUD kids...we did pretty well on northern on the big lake, but had to work alot harder for them than other years. Will be up July 19th for another week so I think the northern will be alot better as the weeds were just starting to look pretty good at the end of the week. We seen alot of walleye caught in the weeds along the north shore while casting for northern also. I noticed in previous posts you have a cottage on se side. Do you ever swing into Jim and Julie's camp? He's my brother...later"
533262,Trailerguy,2003-07-06 21:13:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Big Mike, I mainly target eye's, I had a big pike take a 8"" suick so hard it straightened the clip on my ballbearing swivel one night last week, they were wild that evening. I think I met your brother at the Sunset once last year, but I've never been in that camp."
