A couple of boaters have had major damage to their trailers and one had lower unit ruined. The city has put up ""use at your own risk"" instead of fixing the problems at this point. Maybe they dont care about the tourism in their town."
534848,Guest,2003-09-07 00:08:00,0,Hi. where is this place at?
534862,CanEye,2003-09-08 08:34:00,11,"You are correct! The launches at Selkirk are terrible. While pulling up the boat two weeks ago, scrapped the motor on the bottom of the river, very shallow. They must have put some gravel at the ends of the launches but they are still bad. Very un-even, you can easily notice when the trailer goes off the end of the ramp. I e-mailed the city of Sekirk to find out if they are going to fix the launches, no response yet. Caneye"
534863,Stevie B,2003-09-08 08:48:00,157,"The boat launch at Cat's on the Red is a great launch. Even with the low water you can nicely launch there. It's a little more money to launch there but it is worth it. And then you are right at the locks, the gas you burn coming the the locks on the river will eat up any savings launching in Selkirk. Fish ON!!"

534886,Backwater Eddy,2003-09-10 00:46:00,3871,"Stu and Diana's new boat ramp at ""Cats on the Red"" is by far the best on the Lower Red River of the North (Canada), especially this fall. The Selkirk Park ramps are a mess due to low water and a general need for ""real maintenance"". The 2"" rock dumped in may be a short-term fix for smaller lighter rigs, larger rigs should be extra cautious yet. As of today the ramp at ""Cats on the Red"" is very usable and in great shape. The only reason it could become difficult is if we see renewed heavy South winds and the river gets drawn down even further. (The Lake Winnipeg tidal effect on the last 30 miles of the Red River of the North may influence the levels up to 5 feet +/- in a 24-hour period). You may contact Stu and Diana at this address and number for updates on river conditions and the fall walleye bite. ""Cats on the Red"" Stu & Diana McKay Tel: (204) 757-9876 [email protected]www.catsonthered.net Some nice walleye have begun to show already, no big numbers yet, but some nice fish. With a shot of rain and cooler North winds we may see a more substantial bite developing soon. The forage base is high in the river so once the walleye do move in, it should be great. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Upper Red River of the North (USA) Most of the boat ramps on the upper Red are difficult if not impossible to use at this time. Large sections of the upper US section of the Red River of the North is only fit to be run with a specialized boat such as a River Pro jet drive. Conditions are lower then we have seen them since the late 70's early 80's. At present I can wade across some areas below the dams on the Red starting at the headwaters of the Red at Wahpeton ND, to as far down the Red as Fargo ND. Not a good time for large V-hulls to wonder the upper Red River, unless you're very adventurous. Fishing is fair to good in some areas, great in others. Shore casting is producing for those who are not adventurous enough to run skinny river water. The walleye and SM bass fishing has picked up dramatically in recent days and nights. I anticipate it should get even better soon. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"

Put my Pro Angler in, cant power on/off but managed to get the boat in no problem. Both ramps on the south dock seemed usable. Saw a guy try and put his boat in on the north dock, backed 1/2 his van into the water before the boat started lifting off the trailer. There was approx 4ft of water at the end of the dock."
