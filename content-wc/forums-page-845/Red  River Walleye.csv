534904,Backwater Eddy,2003-09-11 05:44:00,3871,"Stu and Diana's new boat ramp at ""Cats on the Red"" is by far the best on the Lower Red River of the North (Canada), especially this fall. The Selkirk Park ramps are a mess due to low water and a general need for some ""real maintenance"". The 2"" rock dumped in may be a short-term fix for smaller lighter rigs, larger rigs should be extra cautious yet. As of today the new ramp at ""Cats on the Red"" is very usable and in great shape. The only reason it could become difficult is if we see renewed heavy South winds and the river gets drawn down even further. (The Lake Winnipeg tidal effect on the last 30 miles of the Red River of the North may influence the levels up to 5 feet +/- in a 24-hour period). You may wish to contact Stu and Diana for updates on river conditions and the fall walleye & cat bite. ""Cats on the Red"" Stu & Diana McKay Tel: (204) 757-9876 [email protected]www.catsonthered.net Some nice walleye have begun to show already, no big numbers just yet but some nice fish. With a shot of rain and cooler North winds we may see a more substantial bite developing soon. The forage base is high in the river so once the walleye do move in, it should be great. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Date: Wednesday September 10, 2003 Just a quick update on conditions on the Lower Red. The water levels are at a fifteen year low, but the good news is it hasn't effected the cats desire to feed. The fact that were now well into September, ol' whiskers has really got the feed bag on! Yesterday one of my guides produced a total of thirty six big cats, many of which were over twenty pounds. In fact the day before his boat produced a ""forty incher"" that tipped the scales at thirty and a half pounds! This pattern will remain for another couple of weeks or until the water temps dictate different. In other words when the water temps drop too low the cats will eventually shut down. Fish ""Hard"" Forever! Stu McKay ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ""Piggy's are my business, and business is good"" ><,sUMo,>"

Tried alot of different presentations and got skunked. I didn't see any of the other 20 to 25 boats catch anything but garbage fish either. Boats were continually moving so you know what that means. I live about an hour from the End of Main and I'm not going back til about the 20th of this month. Hopefully it is better."
