534849,Guest,2003-09-07 07:46:00,0,I was returning from The Pas on friday the 6th and when we were on hwy 10 and 60 seen hundreds of snakes on the road crossing and splattered. Does anyone know what the deal is? I am curious if the rain forced the on high ground or if they were heading to dens for the winter or get on the road for some heat...Wuld be interested if anyone else saw these or knows why..Thanks.

In spring and fall they start gathering; this time of year they are starting to head for their winter dens.
