I did call T.I.P.S. but as I discussed the issue with the person at the other end of the line we both agreed that at such a remote lake and with the Manitoba Conservation officers so far away there was little or nothing that could be done. What we do need however are more anglers with a sense of respect for such a great past time and resource (and yeah if no one is there to give you a ticket it's still wrong). I hope that all walleye anglers out there respect the regs in whatever body of water they fish. Happy lake did have its freer-for-all days and it resulted in many ""few"" fish outings. The two lakes below Happy were once walleye jewels in Manitoba's south east (but now have no where as many ""great"" fish as they once did)..... Now that Happy has returned to better days ........ it seemed to me after this weekend's experience as though we've learned nothing .....when will we ever learn."

The sad thing is,that those poachers will be the first to complain when the fishing is poor again. After working for 33 years in the Natural Resources field with the state of Michigan I saw alot of these types of violations, and at times it would colapse the fisheries on small bodies of water. Even in this day and age we have more than our share of fish and game hogs. That is why it is so important for all honest sportsmen to report all violations. Lets keep our sport available and even better for our grandchildren."
