532007,Norseman,2003-06-05 23:18:00,24,Is it a requirement in Ontario to have a licensed trailer? Just a rumor that I had heard about someone from wisconsin getting a $100 dollar ticket for unregistered trailer in Ontario even tho it is not a law in Wisconsin. Just wondering what I need to do since you can't even register a trailer in WI.

532009,Guest,2003-06-06 08:43:00,0,You can register a boat trailer in Wisconsin. The DMV told me that plates aren't required on boat trailers under 3000 lbs unless you plan on traveling out of state. I keep a plate on my trailer since I go out of state a couple times a year.

In fact pretty much any vehicle that drives needs to be registered, including snowmobiles, ATV's and trailers. However due to the fact that ALL our registration is done through AutoPAC, which is a gov't run non-profit orginazation, the cost for the average guy to register something is usaually lower than most of north america. I do believe that Ont. has private insurance company's for their vehicles but their traffic laws are similar. FYIFish ON!!"

If there is a law requiring that trailers be registered, even those being towed by vehicles with Wis plates, the law is being overlooked if you don't attract the police by breaking other traffic laws. We did get pulled over in the Dakotas for not having a registered trailer. After telling the officer that we didn't need plates in Wis we had to wait a few minutes while the officer checked with someone who knew."
