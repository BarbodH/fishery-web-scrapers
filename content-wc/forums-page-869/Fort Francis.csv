532028,jvfisherman,2003-06-06 08:59:00,15,Can anbody recommend a hotel in Fort Francis that's halfway decent for price and quality? Any help would be appreciated....
532029,Guest,2003-06-06 09:52:00,0,"There is a Super 8 there that is only a year or two old. We normally stay at the one in International Falls, It's not the Ritz but it's clean and the price is right. We have also stayed at the Red Dog hotel in Fort Francis, the rooms are similar than the Super 8 but it has a bar!Make sure you book your rooms in advance 'cause they fill up fast!Good Luck!IPS"
