The depth and style of fishing the crank will dictate the type of crank to use. I've primarily trolled over reefs 10'-20' deep. Bumping Tots and Wallys off the rocky bottom seems to trigger strikes. I have no experience fishing deep like on Erie (Reef runners and Deep Thundersticks) or casting with jerk style baits (Crystal Minnows and Husky Jerks). I hope this helps. There are many more on this site that do a lot more fishing than I do that can help."

We go late June and they ""eyes"" have never let us down. We start about 10-14 feet deep and as the evening progresses we sometimes end up in 3-4 feet of water as they move in. My favorite has been the clown shad rap. #9 for the deep ones then slim down to the #5 when they shallow up. The tail dancers proved quite good last year too. I like the red tail chub color the best. As long as you can keep the nose on the bottom, or near it, you'll have fun. Good luck. guide7"
