531911,iamwalleye1,2003-06-05 18:15:00,1589,How about the Muskies? It is cosed until the 3rd saturday of June!
532058,Guest,2003-06-08 17:55:00,0,The muskies were all caught on 3 1/2 tubes fishing for smallmouth bass. They were all released promptly. Perhaps taking a picture is illegal. DonC
532069,Guest,2003-06-08 20:52:00,0,There are pictures of the trip at a website we made of the trip. It is at teamcorrell.com Don
531901,DonC,2003-06-02 19:18:00,93,"Our group of 8 just returned from last week fishing out of Birch Island Resort. Probably the best trip out of 30 for us over the past 15 years. All caught plenty of smallmouth up to 19 inches. We didn't target walleye much, but caught a decent number shallow. Couldn't keep the pesky pike off the line. While smallmouth fishing one day, I could only manage 2 on a 150 yard stretch of shoreline, perhaps because of the 3 back to back muskies I caught on tender tubes on 8 lb. line. We did manage a few crappie. The weather was great, as the lodge always is. Mike and Wendy do an outstanding job.DonC"
531902,Reels,2003-06-02 19:40:00,2876,"Thanks for the report Don. Were the smallmouth spawning, or are they done?I have been hearing alot of great fishing reports from Canada saying it has been the best in a long time. Couple more days and Im off!Tight Lines,<{{}}><"
531903,Reels,2003-06-03 05:47:00,2876,What was the hot color for the tube jigs?<{{}}><
531904,DonC,2003-06-03 08:34:00,93,"The smallmouth were still full of eggs. Shad or avocado green (with some red flecks) were the best tube colors. White worked some. The best crankbait was number 11 floating rapala minnow in white with blue or black back. Good luck and please post your trip,DonC"
531905,Illini Bob,2003-06-03 14:17:00,16,"Will be on Gunn in 4 weeks.Did you have the best luck with smallies on Gunn or did you head towards Little and Big Sand? (If you don't mind my asking)Thanks, Bob."
531906,DonC,2003-06-03 19:24:00,93,"The smallmouth fishing was excellent in Gunn Lake, though the biggest smallmouths were mainly caught in Little and Big Sand Lakes.Good luck,DonC"
531907,jonzimmy,2003-06-03 22:11:00,2,"how low was the water, was it a problem putting in out of minaki? our trip leaves this weekend, we will be at minaki saturday, june 7th. What seemed to interest the pike?"
531908,DonC,2003-06-04 06:20:00,93,"The water was close to normal, perhaps 6 to 8 inches low. The pike hit all our soft plastics (tubes and grubs) and crankbaits, from rapala number 11 minnows to bandits 200 series. We were fishing mainly smallmouth. The Throat rapids in navigatable, though slowly. Our group caught 5 muskies at least on tender tubes from basspro. I used a 14 pound Stren flourocarbon leader on a small barrel swivel of 12 inches in length, which resulted in only 2 bite offs all week. Usually I will have 15 to 20 bite offs for the week.Good luck,DonC"
531909,brian1785,2003-06-04 06:31:00,1534,"Silly question...someone told me that there is a season on smallies. Does that mean you can't fish for them or you can't keep them? If there is a season, when is it? Please clarify. Thanks, I'm heading up this weekend."
531910,DonC,2003-06-04 06:56:00,93,"The season is open for smallmouth, with the caveat that you can only keep 2 I believe before the late June date when the regs change. We had smallmouth contests over the week. Unfortunately Boat #2 won the main one, I believe through unscrupulously methods, i.e. #11 rapala minnows, white with black or blue backs, and having a driver. They will do anything to win. DonC"
