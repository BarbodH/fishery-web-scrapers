532100,Guest,2003-06-09 19:15:00,0,Just got back from Canada on Sat. As my wife and I drove up hwy 502 on Saturday the 31st I thought I would keep her occupied by having her make a list of the boat brands I saw driving south. At 8 am there weren't a lot of boats but we did get some interesting results. I would say this unscientific study is about 90% accurate. I am pretty good at determining what a boat is quickly by sight but some boats had covers that didn't allow a good visualization and I also had to concentrate at times on keeping my own vehicle and boat on the road!! Lund 24 boats Alumacraft 22 boats Starcraft 6 boats Crestliner 3 boats Tracker/Lowe/Sylvan all 2 boats Smoker 1 boat I may have missed a couple but this is pretty accurate. Noticably absent: Ranger
