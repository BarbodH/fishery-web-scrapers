532043,Guest,2003-06-07 07:06:00,0,"The Safeway is a large store with everything that you'd expect to find. After the toll bridge at Fort Frances, you will have to take the dirction towards Aitikokan for several blocks (the store will be right on the main road, on the right hand side). It is worth going to, since there isn't a store as large until you get to Kenora (which also has a very large grocery). Finding the road back towards Kenora is not difficult since Fort Frances is not a very large town.Good Luck!"
