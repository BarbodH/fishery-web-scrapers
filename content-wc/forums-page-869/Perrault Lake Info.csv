531988,hawkeyewalleye,2003-06-05 10:31:00,2,Wondering if anyone has any information regarding Perrault Lake? How the fishing has been so far this year? Any information on where the walleyes generally are this time of the year? What lures generally work on this lake? Is there any other lakes that are accessible from Perrault Lake? We head up next week. Thanks.

But in the past 4 years I have been at perrault this week. Troll spinner rigs with crawlers(my personal choice) for walleyes at dusk in jackfish Bay. Start on the shoreline and work your way to deeper water. You also can fish big pike right outside of jackfish bay by the island and reeds before you enter jackfish. We always bought live suckers and used big bobbers. Thats a blast, and there's some HUGE fish in there. Church lake and spadina have been a lot of fun jigging.(I only use crawlers) Last year on a rainy day we had 100+ walleye in our boat. Jig the north hump towards the centar of the lake in Spadina and rock dropoffs in Church, the south end of the lake has been best. Finally the last two years the mouth of the Ord river and ord bay are where most big fish were caught. We never tied into a big one but seen a few monsters reeled in in that area. If you can take the ord river to turtle lake, do it.(don't know about water levels) This lake is awesome. Every year we've caught our 50 jumbo perch in a short time and one year 12 of them were over 12 inches. Its a long ride and rocky but time well spent. Oh yea fish the river where it comes into turtle on the other side for walleye.(close to the mouth by a big rock wall) We found this spot on Friday last year and caught many a walleye. with all the traffic gone Friday night on the way out of the river we also saw 4 different moose swimming by us."
