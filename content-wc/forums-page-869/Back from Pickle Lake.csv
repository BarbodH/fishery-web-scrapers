Watch for rocks when traveling by boat. The fishing was fantastic, but slower than other years. We caught 20-40 fish per 4-5 hr fishing day. The weather up there has been very warm and the fish have spawned and are moving out of the rivers and back to the lake. They just are not concentrated at this time. The walleyes we caught seemed larger than other years (18-24 inches), but had to fish a little harder to get them. The Northerns were all small this year. We didn't catch any big northerns this year--largest about 8 lbs where we usually have a few 12-15 lb fish. Locals say it has only rained twice this spring and the fire danger is high. There was a fire north of us while we were there and the copters and tanker planes were flying overhead all afternoon. Lenrtay--there was a guy camping in our camp this year who confirmed what you said about the Pipestone area. He said he spends the whole summer up there including about one month on the Pipestone camping on Horseshoe lake. He was telling me he could show me places where I could catch a fish every cast. Have fun in August. Bring a pillow for your butt--it's a long ride up there. We saw lots of bears and a couple moose on the road up and back."
