532070,Guest,2003-06-08 21:50:00,0,"I am taking the boy scout on a canoe trip to Lake Wasaksina in Temagami, Ont in July. Any suggestions for technique or areas to target on Wasaksina. We have had decent success on smallmouth but the walleye have been more elusive. Any tips or suggestions would be helpful. Is there a topo map available of this lake? Thanks in advance, Scoutmaster"
