It worked great but now it shows depths of 300-400ft at all times.The diagnostic test passes, transducer says connected and the voltage input is good. I have depth range set to auto. No exposed wires or cuts on cable but there is a kink in cable. I need to use this again by Thursday as I'm going on 4 night trip to Sturgeon Lake. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ps if kink in cable is problem any chance of cutting out damaged section and splicing back together. What do you think?"

Unfortunately, the only solution was to replace the transducer (about $45). You should bring your entire unit to the store to verify that the new transducer solves the problem. I would suggest upgrading to a better unit--you can now buy a portable unit with 200+ vertical pixels for about $200. The difference in resolution is unbelievable! Good luck and good fishing."
