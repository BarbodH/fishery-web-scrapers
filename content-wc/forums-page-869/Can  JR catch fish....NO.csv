531956,Guest,2003-06-04 19:48:00,0,We have a guy just like JR on our trip. He is the most pathetic fisherman I have ever seen. We even have to tie his hooks on. About the only thing he is any good at is dipping our Walleyes....even that needs improvement. The only reason we take him is so we have somebody to pick on.

If they are that terrible of fishermen, help them out, teach them how to catch fish, if they are that pathetic maybe you shouldn't take them along just to have someone to pick on. I have to admit that I have done my fair share of ribbing, but have never taken someone along for the sole purpose of taunting them for a week. It is supposed to be fun for everyone. This year my buddy's daughters hand painted some spoons for their daddy's trip. We tried to catch some big pike on them, but somehow it didn't work out on them spoons. We made sure that the spoons were in the pictures with the big fish tho, just to make the girls feel really good. That is what it is all about for me, having a good time, even if maybe the truth is stretched a little. Teach them some of your tricks, they will be better for it, and wont have to worry about using your fish to look good or maybe justify going fishing to their family. Kilroy"
