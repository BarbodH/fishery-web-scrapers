Lots of slot fish. Fish for lunch never took more than around one hour. My wife caught more fish again which made her very happy. The fishing followed the usual pattern in that it was definitely better when the wind was up a bit and blowing into structure. Most fish were caught on 1/4 jigs in less than 12 feet of water with a minnow. A small number of walleyes were still not finished spawning A few fish were caught pitching into very shallow water. Lots of wildlife including a moose in the middle of the road and a very pretty red fox, beavers, a golden eagle and a really huge number of rabbits. The duck population appeared to be up a little.....unless it's just wishful thinking for fall I am patiently waiting to retire and spend more time fishing!"
