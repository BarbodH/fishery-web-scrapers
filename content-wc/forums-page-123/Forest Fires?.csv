6327020,martinbns,2019-05-31 19:41:00,1520,Pretty much guaranteed to have forest fires scattered all across the Boreal Forest every June until Oct.
6327022,Wall-i-Lama,2019-05-31 19:50:00,1524,This interactive map shows the current active fires. There are a couple west of ear falls and red lake. They are small. The big one is north of red lake and is currently 3000 hectare or about 7500 acres.https://www.ontario.ca/page/forest-fires

6327084,wallydave,2019-06-01 04:44:00,2151,No doubt! Recent updates say the smoke is coming from Alberta!
6327100,Wall-i-Lama,2019-06-01 05:30:00,1524,"NP. I few years back we flew out of red lake and right into a gigantic smoke cloud. For quite awhile we didn't know which way was up or down. The pilot finally did a u-turn and went back to red lake. After we were on the ground he admitted that even he was a little worried on that one. Since then, I tend to keep track of the active fires up there!"
