We will be targeting walleye but do enjoy a round or two with northerns. Looking for any input/reviews that have not already been posted on the fishing, equipment, and camp in general. Happy New Year. Thanks"

6327550,TitanD,2019-06-02 17:26:00,43,We went to Cochrane River Camp years ago with Showalters. It was a cool camp with two sleeping cabins and a gathering/cooking cabin. The river system included access to Deer Lake. Eddie Sr. And Jr. were both top notch. We had OK fishing but to be quite honest it was not our best fishing trip but that I would primarily attribute to crappy weather almost the entire week. It is a nice lake/river system and with good weather would likely produce goid results. Just happened to be a tough week for us.Good Luck

Eddie was a great host, and I am glad I went with his outfit, but last year in mid-July South ""Rapids"" was not much more than a trickle, and we suffered through scorching heat to start the trip, followed by a wind storm which knocked down several trees near camp. The forest fires in the Red Lake area necessitated an early flight out for many of the camps in the region, too. We did have good fishing by portaging above the falls and fishing that area, but too little, too late. Live and learn. Am flying in to Onepine Lake with Nestor Falls in a few days, and hopefully the forest fires I'm reading about aren't going to affect us."

Have been gathering information on this lake for the last year and will continue to do so right up through the discussion we have with the outgoing group on the outpost dock, so keep it coming. Still trying to find depth maps for those lakes. Thanks to all who have responded to my post, private messages, and phone conversations. It is appreciated by our whole group."
