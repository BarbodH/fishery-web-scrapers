6328412,Minnie Man,2019-06-05 12:06:00,535,Has anyone been to Kabeelo lodge? Specifically their outpost on Bear Paw lake? If so I'm curious how it went? Anything special we should bring or do? Time of year and best fishing method? How many minnows do we really need? Thanks!!

We went in mid July.The hosts are excellent- and this is a very well run family operation that will make sure that you have a good time.I don't know how much has changed in 4 years, but I think Bear is a very good lake for walleye.We used crawlers, a few salted minnows, and plastics when we got on schools. Quite frankly- it didn't really matter.They provide the food- and are very generous with what they provide and it's very good.Overall- I would recommend them!"

One in our group required a special diet which Kabeelo made sure went with us when they flew us in. Overall, an excellent experience."
