4605761,Fishenforcer,2016-03-03 16:27:00,4,Was at Keezhik last year. Great camp and excellent fishing. Ryan is a great guy and his camp has everything you need. Didn't speak to the folks across the bay but we waved back and forth any time we ran into one another which was very infrequent unless you were driving by their dock. Let me know if you want any other info.
4605777,Fishenforcer,2016-03-03 16:28:00,4,Oh yeah...I'm going back again this year. When are you going?
4607817,cdacker,2016-03-04 10:02:00,6,"I don't have any definite plans yet. If at all, it would be next summer. Have you ventured down the Keezhik River in search of trout?"
4608409,Fishenforcer,2016-03-04 14:23:00,4,"Yes, beautiful river. We were there a couple weeks after ice out and water was very high. We were not prepared for how high the water was so this year we will be better prepared. We did still catch some nice trout and enjoyed exploring the river. Of course the biggest one broke me off!!!"
5005385,Superfluke,2016-07-20 17:37:00,13,"I have been to Keezhik prob about 13 or 14 times...was maybe 1999 or 2000 the first year I went. Jim Corbett was the owner, then Ernie from Huron Air, then Ryan added it to his other camps that he was running at the time. The ""camp"" across from Ryan's cabins at Keezhik literally started as a some tarps strung up between trees. Periodically over the years there was a small native family that was there occasionally and probably more often than not there was no one there during my trips. There is now a small cabin there but again it is not a ""camp"" or another outpost. Never any issues. Ryan, his camp, equipment are all top notch. Fishing is always superb and if you know the lake it is a no brainer to catch > 100 eyes per person per day. A long time back there was a very primitive cabin in the far east arm that was occasionally used by Wilderness North I believe but now that is just a dilapidated shack that is falling down. I remember seeing an orange otter beached there on the sand point by the cabin. On a couple of my early trips I also recall seeing a plane fly into the south bay with a canoe strapped to the pontoons. Assuming someone was going into creek to chase brookies. I'll be up there mid August and cannot wait."
6327472,joeflip,2019-06-02 10:22:00,75,"I will be heading up to keezhik lake the first week of July for a short 4 day trip with one other person, we normally fish out of Almos bay outpost on Smoothrock lake with thunderhook, a opportunity came up for a short trip to keezhik. If anyone has any pointers or recent information on the lake it would be appreciated, as with only 2 of us and a short trip, I would love to make the best of it. Thanks for any insight offered. Joe"
4571545,cdacker,2016-02-22 14:26:00,6,"Looking for some input from those that have been to this camp before. I'm almost certain I would not be disappointed in the fishing ... especially with the option of brook trout in the river (although I can't imagine accessing the brook trout waters would be an easy task). My concern is with there being another camp on the lake, directly across and just over a quarter mile from the outpost. To me, solitude is equally as important as the fishing. I can't find much about the other camp ... other than it is not another active outpost. But it does appear that you'd have a good view of it from the outpost, and it may get used frequently. Any input from those that have been here before? Thanks in advance!"
4571753,Crede,2016-02-22 15:19:00,134,"We were last at Keezhik in September 2008. I doubt much has changed. The other camp is a single small cabin. It didn't look like it got much use. But then again we were there in September. The Northern Outposts camp has 2 cabins plus a roofed/screened in sitting area. Unless you are a party of 8 or more, my guess is that you are much more likely to have another party in the other Northern Outposts cabin than you are to have someone in the small cabin across the bay. The fishing at Keezhik was great."
4571897,Mike Borger,2016-02-22 16:17:00,1554,There is only one outfitter operating on Keezhik.
4572169,Crede,2016-02-22 17:24:00,134,This is correct. The other camp/cabin across the bay is privately owned by a First Nation family who uses it for vacations during the summer.
4572177,adempsey,2016-02-22 17:25:00,963,"I wondered about that camp, but never could get any information about it. Doesn't look derelict, but it's hard to tell from aerial photos.http://binged.it/1OrbZvSJust ask Northern Outposts about it.I though perhaps Wilderness North might own it because they offer guided canoe trips up the Keezhik River from the Miminiksa Lodge, but that's just a wild guess."
4572625,yoopertrout,2016-02-22 19:17:00,1172,"I've looked into that camp, and would like to go there someday. Please post a report. It really looks great. Although there are some dead brook trout pictures (often a sign of it already being too late . . .), I think the outfitter is requiring catch and release on them now, so you might catch some big ones. No prettier fish on earth!"
4572641,cdacker,2016-02-22 19:25:00,6,"thanks for the feedback guys .. I was aware the other cabin(s) was not another outfitter, and thought it may be native owned. I talked with Ryan and his comment was basically ""no worries, they won't bother you"". I got the impression he's a really good dude and I trust him, but I'm picky, probably too much so, about having a lake to myself on a fly in. Just wondering if any others have been there and if they have had any experiences with anyone else being at the other camp ... good or bad. And if you can see it from the outpost ... for some reason, flying in to a remote location and looking across the lake to another camp doesn't sit well with me. Thanks again!"
4573425,Crede,2016-02-23 07:34:00,134,"1. All interactions with Ryan were great. 2. The cabin across the bay is visible from the Northern Outposts camp. For more info about the family and cabin go to:www.matawa.on.ca Scroll down and click on ""Get our newsletter."" September 2014 issue pages 6-7 has an article with pictures written by Kathy Brady of Northern Outposts."
4573457,adempsey,2016-02-23 07:53:00,963,Thanks Crede!
4573497,cdacker,2016-02-23 08:05:00,6,"Thanks for the link. Seems like a good family and a great getaway for them. Can't imagine that they are too thrilled with an outpost camp on their lake, but I could be wrong. On a different note, sad to read of another potential road being built for mining purposes. Another proposed road, accessing the ring of fire, would destroy (maybe a bit harsh, but to me anyway) one of my favorite places, Teabeau lake on the Albany River. The road or railway would cross the river at the outflow of the Albany on Teabeau. I guess all the more reason to get up there and enjoy it as much as possible"
