So I called them and was told it was just as hot, in fact one of their groups spent the day perch fishing in over 90 + weather and caught over 100 fish but also a severe sun burn w/o their shirts. When we got there weather had dropped some (snow on thursday lol) but we also caught a few jumbo's while trolling."
6327994,fishmanric,2019-06-04 05:29:00,219,I fish the Wabigoon system and it has a large population of Jumbo Perch. The biggest surprise on this body of water has been the Crappie explosion of the past two years. Ten years ago our camp was lucky to see two or three in a year.
6327996,big popi,2019-06-04 05:38:00,635,"no, definitely not a rock bass i know what those fish look like. My grandpa always called them perch or ring-neck perch, but that may not be correct."
6328574,Aspencreek,2019-06-05 22:43:00,2911,"I have also caught Perch in Lac Seul, some jigging and a few others drift trolling. Actually you can tell when it's a perch tapping at the jig. We keep them and fry them up along with the walleye."
6328582,pjshorthorn,2019-06-06 04:24:00,5654,Perch have a very healthy population on Eagle Lake. So much so that you often have to move spots to get away from them so you can actually catch a walleye....LOL. I am looking forward to catching a few starting next Saturday so V-Bay Gord has something to do in the fish cleaning house each evening. Perch make a great appetizer while the rest of dinner is being prepared. PjShorthorn
6328644,rockape,2019-06-06 07:40:00,215,"I have fished NW Ontario for a week 17 years straight. I would say I have caught less than 10 perch. I have never caught one in the Sioux Lookout area (Minnitaki, Abram. Pelican, Big V, Lac Seul). However on Cedar and Eagle Lake, there are definitely a lot of perch. We got in this one bay on Eagle, and they were biting like crazy (I was casting for Pike likely in there to eat the perch - my friends were catching them). On Cedar, we would catch some jigging for walleyes. I have heard about and seen the worms in perch. Someone told me that either hard bottom or soft bottom ones have the worms, and the others don't. I can't remember which is which. I have seen the worms while filleting them. I know they don't hurt you, but still... And then we can talk about all of my musky and pike baits that look like perch that get hammered every year. They must be in there!"
6328662,SteveZ,2019-06-06 09:00:00,271,I have been fishing the English River below Lac Suel since 1988 and we catch jumbo perch every year. Last year we saw huge clouds of bait fish in the shallows and with a dip net determined they were perch.
6324356,Jdconins,2019-05-23 14:02:00,62,"Hello to all, I'm asking a question here and hope this does not sound unintelligent. Why are there not Perch in most lakes in Ontario Canada? When viewing websites about species that various lakes have, some being in the same general vicinity have what they refer to as jumbo perch but you can drive down the road or fly for that matter and Perch don't even exist. One of the lakes I fished back in 2013 I was told that the lake only had Walleye and Pike. The week we were there I caught a perch that I would classify as jumbo and threw it back. The next day about a half a mile from that location I caught another one but a little smaller. The outfitter told me I was crazy and that it must have been brought in someone's minnow bucket to be used as bait. First, I thought that was illegal and I did not have any pictures to prove it as I did not have a camera. I get it about bass as you are to far north and they cant tolerate the cold temperatures and you could ask why do some lakes have walleye but no lake trout. I though perch and Walleye are cousins and that Perch are hardy and can tolerate those temperatures. Wonder if those perch got in there naturally by ducks or geese that had eggs stuck to there webbed feet."
6324374,bthomas3333,2019-05-23 14:26:00,465,This is a bit of semantic issue and why you are confused. My two cents:I think almost all of the lakes in NW ONT that have Walleyes have Perch. Now the issue becomes are there fishable numbers and fishable size. In many cases in Canada that answer is no. My experience is based on info from back in the 1970s when you could trap minnows in NW ONT. Back then I would almost always trap a few Perch and release them.. This would happen in lakes where I had never caught a single perch. If the food structure of a lake is such that the perch are a primary food source they might not get big enough in big enough numbers to be fishable.Brett
6324442,Wall-i-Lama,2019-05-23 19:47:00,1524,"From what I can find, yellow perch native range extends throughout Nova Scotia and Quebec north to the Mackenzie River. It is not native to any other areas of Canada. So that could have something to do with the distribution in Ontario. But based on the curent distribution map, they are in a lot of Ontario lakes."
6324476,Pooch,2019-05-24 02:06:00,4618,I've never fished a Canadian lake that didn't have perch in it. A jumbo or eater sized perch is (for me) very rare. They seem to make up a fair to good portion of the prey in some lakes.Pooch
6324604,bigwalleye1,2019-05-24 08:49:00,2632,"I've caught perch in Lac Seul, but never more than one or maybe two per trip. I'd LOVE to be able to find a fishable population of them."
6324610,lionfan19,2019-05-24 08:53:00,41,I would second what Bthomas said. There are perch in just about every one of those lakes but not in size or numbers that the outfitter wants to advertise. Was on Washi Lake out of Nakina last summer and caught one very small perch while jigging for walleye one evening. Only one we saw that whole week but I would imagine there are more there. Not something the outfitter advertises on that body of water. I know the Granite Hill/Obakamiga system west of Hornpayne is supposed to have a pretty good jumbo perch population. When I went there as a kid we didn't target them but always caught some nice ones walleye fishing. I also talked to a guy about fifteen years ago who flew in there to target perch and he raved about all the big perch he caught on that trip.
6324626,big popi,2019-05-24 09:21:00,635,"I have fished near Atikokan since I was kid and no one has caught a yellow perch, but we would catch a fish that silver with black strips and the males would have red under their gill plates. I assume this in not a yellow perch - does anyone know exactly what these are? they looked more sunfish shaped than the typical cigar shape of the yellow perch? they did not get very big, maybe 8-9 inches would be a really big one in my experience."
6324706,bthomas3333,2019-05-24 12:10:00,465,If you want to fish perch I have seen Jumbos in good numbers coming out of LOTW right around Witch Bay Camp. The bay out front is pretty good and another bay (15 minutes away had good numbers). A good number of guest catch a good number and take them home verse walleye as they can take out more lbs. Size was around 12in with really good girth.Brett
6324810,Bill Krejca,2019-05-24 18:42:00,6107,"My guess would be the fish you are describing to be rock bass. Re: perch - again, my guess is that most Ontario lakes have a few in them, and that lakes with minimum weeds have a smaller number, due to there not being enough areas to hide in (seems like most are caught near/in weeds). Also, my experience has been that those caught in shallow water seem to have worms in the flesh, those caught in deeper water, not so much. Bill"
6324850,tv4fish,2019-05-25 05:18:00,2694,"I also think you are describing a rock bass ----- ?? Rock bass also have distinctive ""red eyes"" - do you remember noticing those ??"
