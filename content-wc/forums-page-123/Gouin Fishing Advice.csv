6326670,Hookhunter135,2019-05-30 16:01:00,129,Thanks very much for all of the tips. We mostly target pike so we were hoping to find bigger pike up more shallow than in previous years. I caught some nice walleye last year and had blast going after them. I’ll try what you guys suggested and see how we do.
6327534,Guest,2019-06-02 15:54:00,0,We were there one June. Pike very shallow in woody bays. Had to pole the boat in to fish large surface lures. Did very well and found schools of pike at times eager to hit. Got 60 pike in one bay once. Very exciting and surely would hit other lures that Devils Horse and big Torpedo.
6327752,kegisfly,2019-06-03 08:48:00,22,"I am by no means an expert, but, here goes: Your outfitter should have some good suggestions on where to target walleye. Walleye tend to gather where wind is collecting their food (humps, ridges, points, drop-offs, & similar). Once located, you can't beat a jighead with a worm. Alternatively, we have found bottom bouncers with worm harnesses to be effective when trolling or in strong winds. Drift socks can be very valuable. From the reports I have been seeing of a late ice out, the walleye will still be transitioning to the main lake area at that time. I prefer pike fishing as well. Our group's success with pike fishing ebbs and flows. The ideal area to target pike are bays/coves with wind blowing into them. If that bay/cove has access to deep water, that area should hold some nice pike. Our most consistent pike fishing has been in grassy bays, coves, & flats. There have been some years at the Gouin with almost no grass growth (pike grass), and those have been tougher years. We then turn to wind blown points, shorelines, rock walls, & islands (again, wind pushing food). Areas near good walleye fishing are pike hot spots. Pike lures? Anything!!! Spoons, weedless spoons, top water stuff, soft & hard swimbaits, crankbaits, spinner baits, in-line spinners. I know this sounds cliche, but, the lure & presentation does need to match the situation, but, that could be as simple as spoon vs. weedless spoon or deep vs shallow diving. Sometimes when the bite is slow, you have to pick the more slow moving or subtle baits. Lure color: Maybe it matters some? I prefer gold over silver in the Gouin (but have caught plenty of pike on both). Baits that mimic walleye or pike have been pretty effective. There is usually a hot lure every year and that tends to change every year. I have fished Plamondon bay before with Air Tamarac in early July. It was a tough week of weather and wind and fishing. We found a walleye hot spot, but, we had to suffer through wind & white caps to fish it. Should have had a drift sock! We found some okay pike fishing, but it seemed like there was a lot more pike potential to be unlocked. Have fun & good luck, Kirk"
6328984,rkc118,2019-06-07 09:00:00,15,"we were at that camp in 2013. my brother caught a 40"" pike in the bay to the left of the cabin, the other guys came out on the dock to see it. oliver will give you a map that shows the good spots for walleye. once you find the right depth, you will have no problem catching walleye."
6326320,Hookhunter135,2019-05-29 19:37:00,129,Looking for suggestions on tactics. I am making my fourth trip to the Gouin from June22-29. This is by far the earliest I have ever gone. This is a father son one time trip that is starting to become our new tradition. We are not hardcore anglers by any means but love this area. Our cabin is in a long narrow bay that is normally a shallow bay with what looks like a lot of weed beds. I have never fished this area. We normally target pike but do a few days of walleye fishing as well. What advice do you long time fisherman have for walleye and pike for this time of year. I also hear the Gouin is on the high side right now and it was a late ice out. Thanks I’m advance. I greatly appreciate the knowledge and experience you guys carry.
6326410,tweedrules,2019-05-30 05:05:00,107,Where will you be staying?
6326416,sbe2,2019-05-30 05:38:00,63,"When we go up, we are target walleye so tactics change depending on condition. Pike are more a less a pain in the rear unless they are the only fish biting. It all depends on how you want to fish and what species you target. With walleye look for rocky points and shorelinges where the wind is blowing into at that time 15-20' maybe??? We go earlier so depth may vary. With us, the pike do not seem to discriminate on what they bite, but then again we do not target them. Are you bringing your own boat? What style of fishing do you normally do?"
6326462,Hookhunter135,2019-05-30 08:00:00,129,I will be staying at Gouin 1 with Caesars North Camps. It’s a narrow Bay North of Bae Plamadon.
6326524,vteye3,2019-05-30 09:50:00,496,"We use to fish Gouin years ago and could always locate walleyes with bottom bouncers. Read up on how to use them if not familiar they work well as a locator and can then jig if that is the preference. Good luck, beautiful area."
6326528,sbe2,2019-05-30 09:56:00,63,We fish in and around Hanotaux Bay.
6326536,tweedrules,2019-05-30 10:01:00,107,"When you fly in ask Oliver how deep the walleye are. This is what we do on the Gouin. We are directly west of you at Lac Du Male. There are many ways to fish there but this is what works for us. 1. I would jig at that depth using 1/4 or 3/8 oz jigs (depending on the wind) with night crawlers and leeches. We have found that all colors work. I stick to charchruse, white, pink and blue. We stopped using plastics many years ago and just go with live bait. Last year we went 7/1-7/7. The walleyes were held up around 20 feet. The year before they were at 12 feet so depends on the year. 2. Troll slow with storm thin fins, storm Hot N Tots and Rapala Tail dancers. Some guys in our group use live target shad and berkley flicker shad. You'll pick up Pike and Walleye this way. Great way to stop and drink a few beers. 3. Throw spoons in the weeds for Pike. We use Lucky Strike Half Waves. These are so underrated on the Gouin. great spoon, always produces big Pike. We also use Len Thompson spoons, Sutton Spoons (from finger Lakes NY) and Johnson silver minnows. Good luck, hope this helps."
6326628,clegg,2019-05-30 14:03:00,38,"Hot n tots have given us great results at the goiin, specifically in the evening. Jighead/worm has always worked"
6326658,Freytown,2019-05-30 15:04:00,770,https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...%7D%7DhgHfxgjMFish right where you are! Stay close to the the bank with worms and leeches (0-15ft). Go deeper if you don't find fish....but you should. Have a great trip. FT
