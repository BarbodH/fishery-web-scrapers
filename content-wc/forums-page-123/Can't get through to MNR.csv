6327814,troutwater,2019-06-03 12:21:00,299,I've tried all that but I dont have an account set up apparently. The message I got was that you have had to create one after November 2018 which I did not. My buddy last year ended up with my license last year after the trip and it was thrown away....I'm thinking my card was with it.
