We caught enough to scratch out shore lunch every day by eating a few walleye, perch and northern. found that lindy rig was better than than a jig and it was important to fish prime time. Early morning and sunset were the best chance to catch a few. mid day was really tough to get bit. we also had some success with slip floats. the slip floats really showed how fickle the bite was. the float would go about 1"" below the surface and just sit there. you had to wait a good 30 seconds before setting the hook and you would get them right in the lip. If you set any sooner you would just real in your minnow head. fishing started to pick up Friday but overall it was a slow week for us. you could mark lots of fish but could not get a bite. it was very frustrating but we had a great trip and cant wait to go back."

Anyone have a reading on the current temp of the surface water? Looks like maybe a bit of rain on the Sat before my son and I arrive, followed by a week of sunny and/or partly sunny days. Anyone been out fishing today? I'm so jazzed knowing I'll be heading north soon that I can't wait to hear how things are going. Anyone on this board targeting lake trout? With success? Cheers."

Smallie bite was heating up, got a 30 inch walleye, and a couple medium pike in the 33-35 inch range. I think the bite was improving as we were there, or it seemed to be. LM"
