I think anyone heading up that way in the next two weeks will have lights out fishing. We caught a lot of walleyes, but we did not get into the big girls. Plenty of fish in that 20""-23"" but nothing bigger for us. I think the big ones will really start to bite in the next few days. Our best day was Tuesday when we boated 160 walleyes for 3 guys, plus a number of northerns and a few perch. Jig and minnow was the ticket, along with a jig on a slip bobber. The walleyes wanted the jig moving very slow and dragging on the bottom, even had the slip bobber set so the jig actually touched the bottom. Even when we were catching one after another, the fish were finicky on bait. If the minnow ripped up at all or hung funny on the jig, they wouldn't take it. I wish we could have had a few more days as it is only going to get better. Camp boats sure have come a long ways over the years. Pretty comfortable for 3 guys in 18' boats with 50 HP 4 strokes with auto tilt."

We caught a lot of fish near the stumps area just before Sawmill. Water was very low. We had an amazing afternoon/evening on the point of the sandbanks before you get to Sawmill. There is a log, almost looks like a railroad tie sticking out of the water by the shore. We anchored off of that in 11 feet of water. We caught 60 walleyes in 2 hours, but unfortunately ran out of bait. The key there was the wind was blowing in. The mouth of the Wenesaga was slow, but I think that hasn't happened yet and should get better."
