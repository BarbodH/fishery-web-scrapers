6326124,Bergy,2019-05-29 06:39:00,83,"I have G2 Humminbird Helix units. I am looking for the best map chip for the Gull Rock Chain near Red Lake Ontario. It looks like Navionics Hot Maps Platinum for Canada is best. Can anyone verify this? Are hazards and rocks marked. Does it show lake depth in 1’ contours? Any navigational information? Is the Navionics Information accurate?I looked at Lakemaster for this area, but the detail is not there. Looks like it is 5 - 10’ contours without any hazards identified. Thanks."
6326198,Pezman38,2019-05-29 10:52:00,3196,Navionics is based off of old school maps and I have found it to be way off.....but still useful. This is using maps chips from about 2005 so perhaps I am wrong now with the new live mapping options.
6326378,h8go4s,2019-05-29 21:15:00,1673,"Don't expect a lot. Below are 2 screen caps from the Navionics web app (https://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=e...y=sp_vHd%7BqzP) The first is the Navionics layer which looks similar to the old Minnesota DNR maps done with an ice auger and a weighted tape. The second is the ""sonar charts"" layer which looks like it's computer generated, not natural contours. I wouldn't trust either for hazards but they are useful for general navigation. You be the judge.Humminbird now has an Ontario map card, but I have no idea if it's any better."
6326422,BornToFish,2019-05-30 06:14:00,1224,"Greetings, I fish two lakes that are fairly close to Gull Rock Lake. I purchased five years ago the Canada Navionics card as a depth contour map is available for one of these lakes. I will offer several comments about the map. First, the lake map suggests there is structure in the lake that is not actually present in the lake. Second, most of the structure that I am now fishing is not indicated on the lake map. Third, the actual shoreline and the shoreline depicted on the map were off-set by about one hundred yards. That is, my boat was frequently indicated to be on shore when I was fishing near shore. A call to Navionics eventually resulted in a correction to their lake map that I had to download onto my SD card. Fourth, the fishing lodge puts out about twenty or so marker buoys (painted Freon tanks) to mark known navigational hazards (e.g. rocks). Nearly all of these hazards are not identified on the Navionics map. I am fairly confident that the data used to draw the Navionics lake map, for the lake that I am fishing, was gathered in the 1980s. The purpose for gathering the data was likely driven by purposes (possibly gold mining) other than navigation/fishing. If so, the quality of the data may be limiting the usefulness of the lake map for navigational and/or fishing purposes, regardless of the computer algorithms used to draw the lake maps. That is, garbage in = garbage out. If you choose to go with the Navionics type maps, I encourage you to take the information with a grain of salt. Go with the information if it is accurate and helpful, but don't trust it as you might be unpleasantly surprised. I am now using a Humminbird Helix gps/sonar unit. I purchased the Zero Lines SD card and found it to be remarkably accurate in terms of shorelines. I am building my own depth contour maps through the AutoCharting function. It takes time, but is providing me with reliable depth contour maps. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6326648,Bergy,2019-05-30 14:46:00,83,Thanks for the insight. I think I will pass on the Navionics.
6326822,Bergy,2019-05-31 05:26:00,83,Dates are June 15 - 22
6326952,johnboat,2019-05-31 12:25:00,2014,Your map will be with Ian. Good luck!
