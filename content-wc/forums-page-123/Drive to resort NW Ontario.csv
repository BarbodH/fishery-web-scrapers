6328260,Ndstallmann,2019-06-05 05:29:00,549,I second Witch Bay! Going for the fourth time in July. We go about every 3 years. Still our favorite vacation. Even though one of us doesn't fish.
6328328,IaDave14,2019-06-05 08:01:00,99,Another vote for Witch Bay great owners and service. It is dog friendly which is why I have gone in the past. Feels quite remote and a fair price for an American plan resort.
6327070,dschiebel,2019-06-01 02:31:00,85,"Just came back from Mink Lake with Northern Wilderness.Great time lots of walleyes.Me and my fishing partner are getting up there in age and were thinking of a drive to resort for a week., we like the fly in remoteness and fishingMoney not a real big deal, need a nice 2 bedroom with electricity due to snoring problemNeed a good comfortable boat, and maybe daily bait. Maybe a lodge or just a conformable cabin. Numbers of walleyes are most important followed by size and some northerns. We are 2 old cops and would like to kinda of hang to ourselves, maybe a guide. Would like to stay within 200 miles of fort francis.Good boats, good cabins and great fishing would be good. MIKE BORGER you have any good spots Thanks a lot Dave, don't know how many of these rips we have left."

6327242,TitanD,2019-06-01 13:36:00,43,"Medicine Stone NW of Red Lake. We stayed there last year (normally fly-in). It is a very remote camp with good accommodations, great boats and fishing. Boats have floors, pedestal seats, livewells, 50 hp 4 Stroke electric start motors and deprh finders. Only camp on lake with only private road and landing owned by the camp. Literally no one else on the lake. Very reasonable rates. Also opportunity to fish a musky and smallmouth lake.......we caught a bunch of smallies at this lake. No muskies but we didnâ€™t really try.Feel free to PM if you have questions. Good luck!"
