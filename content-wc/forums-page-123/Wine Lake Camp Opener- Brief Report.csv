Went in Friday to get set up and Nick and crew had done a great job in the scramble to get the camp ready for guests. There were a few cancellations and adjustments so camp was not full like it usually is. We were only three since Doc had to get a couple more stents two days before we left and Sleepy opted out to deal with chemo. It is a little tight fishing three to a boat but Nick was generous and we had another boat at our disposal when we needed it, primarily for trolling. We started Friday afternoon at the falls and Dunkin' Bob pulled up two large pike, 40 and 41 1/2. We pulled up a good mix of smallies and walleye (of course we let them go). Through the week we never saw another pike as big as those but got several in the mid 30's though we never fished for them. Smallies are all over the system now and Dunkiin' Bob caught the biggest at 19"" Walleye were plentiful but scattered. We found a place in Mud Lake that was productive so we spent a few hours on two different days averaging a fish every 10 minutes or so. The closest we ever came to a honey hole. However we caught plenty of big ones. Probably a dozen between 25 and 26 inches with Dunkin' Bob with the largest at 26"" For some reason, I became the whitefish champion with 3 of them all the same size (22""). After a lengthy discussion through the week we reached the decision that whitefish was not a money fish (Dang it!) We tried our preferred method for early trout (trolling crank baits at about 16 fow) all week but could not raise one up most of the week. Net Man Nate pulled one out of the soup of the Portage Falls measuring 31"" (a nice slab). Dunkiin' Bob and I had none.....Until Friday came. On Friday Dunkin Bob went fishing with Mike, a guy who was in camp with his wife who could not keep up with him. They did more talking than fishing. I was with Net Man Nate and we trolled all our favorite spots. The boats had to be in by 3:00 for cleaning and at 2:00 we entered Friday Bay at the back of Dynamite Bay. The weather was turning continually worse and we were trolling with the waves that were white capping. Bam! My perch x rap got slammed and the fight was on. I had trouble gaining on him and after about a ten minute fight we finally got a glimpse of a large trout whose outline resembled a shark. Net Man Nate earned his moniker once again with a perfect net job. Quick measurement and photos and a 34"" was back in the water within a minute ready for another eager angler. Net Man Nate followed up with a 26 incher and it was time to get back to camp for boat cleaning. Friday Bay produced again, receiving its name previously for producing trout for me on Friday after a troutless week. A few kudos for Nick, the camp owner. He is doing great things for Wine Lake Camp. Here are a couple of examples: A. No more pulling boats over the Portage Falls. Nick takes you to the portage and you with his and/or the staff's help load your boats from there to camp. It saves a lot of gas, time and effort. B. Portages- Nick has new systems for Little Trout, Tipover, and Duck Lakes. All with upgraded motors and boats. Biggest improvement- no extra charges for portages. C. Nick has been us. Nick has experienced a great number of excursions to fish camps and fly-ins his whole life. He can relate to what people want. He will freely share what is biting where and on what. He might even go fishing with you if he can find the time. D. No nickle/diming. Only extras are gas and bait and depth finders. No surprises at pay up time, except maybe how much 13% adds up to be! All in all a wonderful week. We missed our usual guys, Doc and Sleepy but looking forward to next year's opener! Fish On! Hooks"
6325660,Lazy Fisherman,2019-05-27 18:59:00,276,Enjoyed your report. Thanks for sharing.
6325762,pjshorthorn,2019-05-28 08:03:00,5654,"Sounds like you had a great trip even though a couple of your main group was missing on this trip. Story to hear that Doc is still having to fight his battle with heat issues,but he is still fighting which is a great thing. I'm hopeful we can get together at ND this fall when I'm there for my niece's wedding on campus. I'll make sure to stay in touch with you as it draws closer. Just about ready to take off for my first adventure this year. We leave on June 14th for Eagle Lake. PjShorthorn"
6325804,jsmyers,2019-05-28 09:42:00,198,"Thanks for the report! Nice pike! I've yet to break 40 inches, but my biggest and my father's biggest both came from Wine Lake.I think this link will work. That's me holding my dad's fish. It was 39"" from Dynamite Bay. I'll be on Wabaskang the week of June 22. My daughter turns 10 this summer and so does my cousin's son. If they do well this trip (their first), then I'll be wanting to talk about Wine Lake Camp next year. We had a great trip at the end of Nick's first season in September 2016.I'm not sure if we'll want to take a day trip over the falls, but I'm curious if it is still an option. I know your point of view about Wabaskangers fishing on Wine, but maybe you can tell us if anything has changed at the falls except Nick's procedures?"
6325904,HeHooksHimself,2019-05-28 13:31:00,725,"Hi JSM, the ramp was still up when we left but Nick has all his camp boats on the Wine Lake side. He said he was going to take the ramp out but offered at least one camp an opportunity to use his dock past the falls to store a couple portage boats, which was refused. He said last year someone took a boat over the portage and cut a nice groove on his dock. He assumes someone will put another roller ramp there but they will have to maintain it, which takes some time and resources. In any case, it just may be harder to get there, but anyone is welcome. However, it is never acceptable to fish on top of someone who is already there. That is my only beef, common courtesy. You will find prices at WLC are competitive and the fishery decidedly more diverse and productive than Wabby, which is why we go through Wabby but don't stop to fish it. That is a nice fat and healthy pike! You should try Wine early in the year and catch a laker, nothing like it! Some concern with lakers in Wine. It seems like no one is catching small ones, which might indicate they are not reproducing. That would not be good.... Fish On! Hooks"
6326042,jsmyers,2019-05-28 20:27:00,198,"Thanks for the info. I have mixed feelings about the portage ramp. On one hand, that spot was a part of my childhood Wabaskang experience. I remember my cousin getting a big pike from below the falls. I remember our trip to ""Forbidden Falls."" I remember the time that I slayed mid-sized pike on a perch shad rap on the north end of Wine.On the other hand, having been a guest of WLC, I have an appreciation of what it takes to run the operation. If I were Nick, I'd probably try to find a way to delete Wine Lake from the Wabaskang maps.I don't remember every finding another boat when we made that trip, so we certainly didn't pile into anybody's spot. We usually didn't get very far out of the river.Quote: Originally Posted by HeHooksHimself That is a nice fat and healthy pike!

6327398,HeHooksHimself,2019-06-02 06:33:00,725,Worked with Nick to get Doc into WLC late July/ Early August. Doc has been so blue about missing two fishing trips in a row due to cardiac issues. We hope he is repaired for a while and he can get himself up to paradise for a date with some walleye. I will sacrifice in the interest of Doc and put off a few honeydo's to escort him there. That will make 3 trips to Canada this year assuming Doc (and me too) will be good for the July-August trip and a September trip to Dominion Lake. What we do for the ones we love! Fish On! Hooks
