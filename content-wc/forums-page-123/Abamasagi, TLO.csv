Wondering if anyone on the board here has fished Abamasagi yet and if so how was the fishing, water levels, temps, etc Our group heads in on the 15th, so just over a week away Thanks"

Been there so many times now, its faithfully predictable on how we will do....i dont say that with cockiness as we all know nature can throw a curve when you get that way...but this lake is fantastic...period. Made up about 20 new slowdeath rigs for trolling...all ready to go now"
