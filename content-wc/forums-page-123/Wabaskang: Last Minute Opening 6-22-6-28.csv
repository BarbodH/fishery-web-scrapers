I can't wait to introduce my wife and kids to fishing in Canada.Unfortunately, some of our group had to cancel due to a serious illness. We were going to occupy two cabins and will now fit into one. I feel bad about shorting Tom and Margaret some of their revenue and am trying to help in whatever little way I can. I figure there is a small chance somebody reading this will be up for a trip on short notice. If your interested, contact them: http://sleepydogcabins.com/location/contact/It will be my first time to Sleepy Dog, but there are others who frequent WC that stay there. Their reputation is impeccable. I can only point you to their reviews: https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Re...t_Ontario.html"
