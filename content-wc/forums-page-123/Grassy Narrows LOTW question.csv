6327784,The tank,2019-06-03 10:37:00,340,If someone knows how to post pictures and can teach me I can put the route on here for you. Or I can send them to a cell phone or maybe a email address. I've got photos of it on my cell. Or if you're going in on August 10th that's when I'll be back. Just trying to help.

6326430,bbheli,2019-05-30 06:52:00,1387,Looking for information on boating from the launch in Morison to the lodge. Is the waterway a challenge and are hazards marked well or what's the general overall hazard level as i'm thinking of bringng a 20' fiberglass up. I normally operate on wide open inland lakes in the midwest so don't know what to expect. The google maps seem sewn together but looks like a ton of stuff to deal with if you don't know the waters.
6326478,BreezyPoint,2019-05-30 08:33:00,1581,"Lots of hazards, mostly well marked on map. There are some buoys as well, but the map is the definitive source and you will have a good chance to hit something if you are not careful.. Get a good map (6214 is the official map). And get a good map chip. I find the Lakemaster to be best for that area.Frank"
6326480,bbheli,2019-05-30 08:37:00,1387,"Thank you, when you say 6214 is the official map, what is the source of that map. The only maps I am aware of are the one published by fishing hot spots. I have the rainy smartstrike chip I think it uses the same lakemaster maps. Thanks again"
6326488,BreezyPoint,2019-05-30 08:45:00,1581,"6214 is the official hydrographic chart from Canada. Search the web for 6214 Sabaskong Bay and you will find a lot of vendors.I like this map a lot better than fishing hot spots...it is MUCH easier to read. Of course it doesn't show fishing spots, but the hazard detail is superior.Frank"
6326494,BreezyPoint,2019-05-30 08:52:00,1581,Just make sure you have the Woods/Rainy edition and you should be good to go with that map chip.Frank
6326516,Bill Krejca,2019-05-30 09:35:00,6107,"Right on with the 6214, much better than the Spots map. Keep in mind that although almost all reefs are shown on the map, many, many, are not buoyed on the water. Best rule is to ALWAYS to check the map before starting out from anywhere, and make sure you know exactly where you are before starting the motor. Every time. Lots of good fishing in that area, you will have a great time if you spend the extra minute to look at the map, and know where you are as you move along. Do not rely strictly on GPS, it can be off enough to put you over shallows. How do I know? Friends who have had problems. Bill"
6326532,The tank,2019-05-30 10:00:00,340,When are you going? I would get a chip if it was me. I fish out of rex toltons right next to grassy. We fished the opener and going back up in August. Not that you cant do it but it's just easier to have someone take you to camp the first time.
6326544,Carnhzkr,2019-05-30 10:17:00,964,"I've stayed in the Miles Bay area twice. It really shouldn't be too hard to navigate from Morson to Miles Bay, but I admit it's a bit intimidating. Luckily for me, I've had my son along who I now admit has a way better internal compass than me. We made it both times to and from on our own, but as Tank suggested, it wouldn't hurt to follow a camp boat. I have the 6214 map as well as the Lakemaster Woods/Rainy chip. The LM chip is awesome for finding the many reefs in that area and the detail is so good that you can often drop right on the spot on the spot."
6326684,Bill Krejca,2019-05-30 16:58:00,6107,"Just another thought re: reading the map - Areas shown as shallow, perhaps in another color, such as blue, perhaps, may not show hazards within that color. The logic here is that one would be going slow anyway, in that area, so reefs may not be shown. How do I know? Just observation, thankfully. Bill"
6326776,bbheli,2019-05-30 21:46:00,1387,"How fast were you going from Morison to get to camp. Did you stay on plane all the way. seems it's a bit of a ride, I know the camp guys usually know water well but at other resorts I saw them do some crazy stuff and if it was just 5' closer could have been a disaste"
