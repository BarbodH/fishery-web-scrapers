Having a beer, meeting the new guys, talking trash, getting ready to go 12 hour drive over night to Red Lake Closer to God now! Float plane is loaded, take off, and the deafening roar of the flight We land, unpack, and are impatient with preparing our rods In the boat now, on the hump, and the first bite ..tentative ..tight line!! Walleye in the pan, great conversation, cold Labatt's, dog tired, grinning After dinner, purple streaked sky, rolling pike breaks the glassy bay Sitting on the dock. At peace. And very, very close to God."

Is it me, but every year I find myself savoring every single minute I'm up there a little more, I even find myself slipping out really early to catch the sun coming up alone with my camera. I bet I take over a 1000 pic in that week because it takes months to pick through them and re-savor the the moments again. well 113 more days but who counting"

When the two weeks comes are coming to a close, I find myself staying up later to savor the experience more. It just know that it will be a whole year before I'm back. It makes for a long ride home. Then a month later we're already planning again!The other place I feel bad leaving is Hawaii - You just can't get there often enough.Blair"
