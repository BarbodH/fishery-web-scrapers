2495194,AllenW,2014-02-27 07:50:00,11482,"Finding it when you need it is usually the problem I have, so I've learnt to freeze everything I can before the trip. We'll mix egg and milk for either french toast, scrambled eggs or egg wash for fish in gallon containers and freeze (fill and freeze in stages works best or the container takes on a new shape) and use block ice as much as we can.

2495282,NARDA 1,2014-02-27 08:29:00,636,"We used it for the return trip from Canada for years but now have been using a 12 volt electric cooler for about 6 years. Keeps the fish frozen solid for the 13+ hour ride home. On the way up we stop overnight in Superior, WI and the bar and restaurant we have dinner at allows us to put our perishables in their cooler and freezer overnight so we just use regular coolers."
2491194,123chadder,2014-02-26 08:07:00,429,"i have been using dry ice successfully for years to keep ice and frozen food frozen....love the stuff,anyone else use dry ice?"
2491370,huntnfish79,2014-02-26 08:38:00,125,every time I kill something out west and need to get it frozen for the ride home I use dry ice. Works as advertised.
2491642,rsiminski,2014-02-26 09:30:00,53,We use dry ice for every fly-in trip. Two days later everything is still frozen.
2491834,btyreprich,2014-02-26 10:16:00,1067,"We always use dry ice on the trip up to Canada. Ideal to protect expensive cuts of meat safe as we do an overnight stay in INternational Falls. I will toss in a few bottles of water in with the dry ice to keep these frozen. You can then place the frozen water in with the refrigerated items like eggs as the blue ice packs start to thaw out. This has worked for us even in the warmer months of late July and August. Helps to have a better quality cooler of course. Check the internet for a Continental Carbonic location near your house or on the way up to Canada. The location near my house sells broken pieces of dry ice at a great price. Even if the location you go to does not have broken pieces, the dry ice here is much cheaper than buying at a grocery store."
2491946,wallydave,2014-02-26 10:49:00,2151,"If we bring fish home, we use dry ice for the return trip. On the way North, we freeze any meat we take for at least a week before we leave, ice it down in a good cooler. By the time we get to camp, things are almost ready to cook. First couple of meals are fresh walleye anyway!This years trip is to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake, american plan, meals included for $620 a week, no worries about ice, except for the beer and maybe a good bottle of Canadian whisky."
2492938,Bill Krejca,2014-02-26 14:48:00,6107,"Usually the intent of putting stuff in my cooler is to keep it from spoiling. With that goal in mind, I normally don't care if I arrive at my destination with the contents still frozen hard as a rock. My plan is to start with everything that is susceptible to relatively fast ruin to be frozen, and packed tightly together. Sometimes I don't use any/very little ice at all. I like to use efficient thick foam coolers which keep the contents cold. This usually will result in arrival after a several day car trip with the contents fresh, ready to be put in the frig and or maybe the freezer. In the days when I used to camp out on the lake and ice was not going to be real accessible, I would sometimes use dry ice to keep my initially frozen food fresh for the week. This kind of situation requires a bit more packing planning. Bill"
2494202,mudpusher,2014-02-26 20:11:00,248,just watch where you put it...dry ice takes the oxygen out of the air. We put dry ice in a gas tank and burn a hole in it with a torch. Doesn't burn till the hole falls in and new air rushes in. No explosion.
2494778,Pooch,2014-02-27 06:19:00,4619,"Dry ice is getting hard to find. Used to be able to pick it up in numerous places on the way from Central Illinois to Canada. All that we knew of are gone.How about a list of where it is available? Don't always need it, but sometimes when the traveling weather is really hot it would be nice to be able to get another day out of our coolers.Pooch"
