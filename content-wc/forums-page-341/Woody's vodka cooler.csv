2495778,NARDA 1,2014-02-27 10:46:00,636,Have you tried calling LCBO's near where you will be?This is a couple years old but might explain why you are having trouble finding it. http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/18...d-from-shelves woodyscanada.ca
2495922,bcmss396,2014-02-27 11:25:00,296,You can access the LCBO online and they have stores and inventory available if you know what city you'd be purchasing in.http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/jsp/Pro...sp?language=ENBlair

2500746,troutwater,2014-02-28 12:42:00,299,Awesome thanks for the links! Too bad there isn't anywhere I can buy it online. Crazy story about the glass in the drinks though.
2500946,Simple Man,2014-02-28 13:36:00,92,Hilarious! Bear Grylls is a sissy boy and probably drinks Boone's Farm!
2502786,walliseeu,2014-03-01 03:27:00,202,Who is this Bear Grylls? Never heard of her!
2503002,515,2014-03-01 06:57:00,254,Unfortunately in Ontario the only place you can buy the hard booze and coolers is from the LCBO store or the LCBO rep stores.
