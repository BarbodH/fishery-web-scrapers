Bass were now going to be open all year long instead of having a closed season.I normally fish for walleyes, though enjoy fishing top water for SM Bass for a change of pace.....has anyone else heard that the Bass regs have been changed for the Central Ontario region ?Thanks,Rich B"

2520866,adempsey,2014-03-05 16:08:00,963,"Open all year round in areas north of Highway 17. So it's open all year in FMZs 4,5,6,7,8 and 9; and most of 10. Might be some exceptions for specific lakes though. You'd have to check.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/business...02_163615.html"
