2492666,P7rancher,2014-02-26 13:38:00,5,"Both are available, both fit our requirements, and both seem like really great people. Looking late June/early July. Any pro/con for either location? They are about 11 miles apart and in different areas of LOTW. Small mouth/Northern are our focus. Have never been to LOTW. Thanks for any help on making a decision. First post and love this forum."
2493890,zeebee,2014-02-26 18:49:00,1144,Ive not been to either resort but my buddies have and enjoyed their stay(s).If it were me and I wanted to focus on smallies and NP's Id consider the Shoal Lake portion of LOW too.
2494042,Ndstallmann,2014-02-26 19:26:00,549,"I have been to Hansen's King Island,Sept of 12. Very nice people, nice cabin, great fishing."
2494434,Obabikon,2014-02-26 22:05:00,2370,Perry and Carol are amazing people and do a great job at Young's! Can't go wrong there...
2494650,Hawker,2014-02-27 04:55:00,3967,"We've never stayed at Hansons so I certainly have nothing of value to discuss in regards, but we have been going to Young's Wilderness Camp for the past 23 years straight and I cannot brag on the place enough. Perry & Carol are wonderful people, are always available to address any and all concerns, and work hard to make your stay(s) at YWC, a trip you will not soon forget.Cabins are rustic (looking) and fully modernized with hot/cold running water, showers/tubs, refrig, comfy beds, fresh clean linens and thoroughly cleaned every day including fresh linens. Camp boats are nice & comfy with elect start 40 hp Yammies or Hondas, TM's, livewells & locators. Food is nothing short of ""over the top"" good, and Miss Carol is one of the best cooks you'll ever find!!You won't have to venture far from the camp island itself to get into some of the best smallie and northern fishing to be found on LOTW!!! Plenty of each species there plus some really good walleye and musky action close by as well. YWC isn't located in what I'd call a high traffic area either, so pretty much your not bothered with lots of boaters, if you even see any there is a week's stay!I can't brag on the place OR the owners enough, and the fishing is nothing short of amazing. Sorry, I'm a tad biased, but look no further, call Carol right now and make your reservation!!"
2495730,jambi,2014-02-27 10:30:00,504,"10 years with my Dad to Young's, 2000-2009. Great people, fishing & food. Only reason I quit going was to switch to a flyins. Boats are 'deluxe' with flat bottom, elec start 40 hp, depth finder trolling motor. Very comfortable for fat boys like us. Dock hands always there to help you in and out, tie up your boat and chat about fishing. We were usually went last week in May mainly for pike and smallmouth. Not sure how pike fishing would be late June. When we went weed growth was still low and we could fish them really shallow. Have a great trip"
2499234,P7rancher,2014-02-28 07:20:00,5,Thank you for all the reply's. Just booked the last of June first part of July with Young's Wilderness Camp. First trip to Canada/LOTW for both my wife and I. Can't wait.
