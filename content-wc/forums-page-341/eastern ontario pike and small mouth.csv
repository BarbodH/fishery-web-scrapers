2467361,PA troutguy,2014-02-19 15:59:00,58,"Zeebee, I am trying to stay within 12-14 hours of Harrisburg, PA. Some of the lodges are around 1000 miles. I am trying to make the trip a one day drive as opposed to the 2 I now do to the Sioux Lookout Area. Having said that I do like the look of the lodge around Chapleau, Ontario. Thanks for everyone's comments, they are appreciated.bill"
2472937,Guest,2014-02-21 12:42:00,0,"Try Gow-Bush-Kon Lodge in Gowganda, great small mouth fishing ( open year round) nice pike and some great walleye."
2474529,zeebee,2014-02-21 19:56:00,1144,"If you are looking for the Cdn Shield sorta experience then the area between Sudbury and Wawa will fit your requirements...the Gowganda area as its known in north central Ont. If your looking for quality and size of fishery then, the Bay of Quinte would rank high."
2479169,stillangling,2014-02-23 10:57:00,149,"Call me biased but I will offer my input. I have had the good fortune of living in many parts of Ontario over the last 4 or so decades. I spent some time living in Timmins and Sudbury. I would describe the fishing in the area around both as horrible. I think it is primarily a function distance to major population centres and a relative scarcity of lakes. Open up google maps. Look at Timmins and then zoom out. Some lakes but generally small. Do the same for Sioux Lookout. Something very obvious can be seen on the landscape or should I say waterscape. About 20% of northwestern Ontario is water. Literally a thousand lakes in a tight doughnut around Sioux lookout, Dryden or any other town west of Thunder Bay. If you were asked to list the top fisheries in the province, nothing from the northeast would make the list. Nipissing? I don't think so. You may drive an extra day on either side but that comes with the advantage of a fruitful week as opposed to a week of washing lures!"
2481177,10point,2014-02-23 19:37:00,102,I've been going to shining tree which is between Timmins and Sudbury for the last 2 years and I'm going back this year. It's not the best walleye fishing but we like to fish smallmouth and the smallmouth fishing can be very good. It can also been done cheaper than those high quality places and I am cheap. I have a small boat which is needed for a lot of lakes in that area. We have had plenty of fish to eat and have always had a good time in that area.
2482145,Superdad,2014-02-24 07:23:00,64,I would agree with ZeeBee about Lake Ontario & the Bay Of Quinte. The pike fishing has exploded out on the Big lake and the small mouths are gorging themselves on Gobies and are HUGE. Last years Bass tournie in Kingston saw daily catches of limits to 25 lbs. It's not a 12 hour drive to this area. Cheers
2483689,doubleheader,2014-02-24 13:51:00,2652,"The west arm of Lake Nipissing is outstanding for smallies, largemouth, and pike. PM me if interested in more info."
2516410,PA troutguy,2014-03-04 15:39:00,58,"Superdad,How far are you fishing from shore in the big lake? I don't want to get into any shipping lanes. I hear the lake can get pretty rough in a short time, don't know if that is accurate or not. How much boat traffic is there?"
2517954,BuckeyeBill,2014-03-04 22:43:00,76,"Just like PA troutguy, I will be fishing on Big V and also Lost Lake in the Sioux Lookout area. I have fished east of Saulte St. Marie and also Sudbury area and the fishing can't compare to Northwestern Ontario. I'm getting older and don't like to make the 20+ hour trip from Ohio but its sure worth it. I feel bad because I love the Lodge and the owners where we have gone quite a few times but the fishing does not compare. Best of luck PA troutguy and hope to see you on the lake!!"
2453825,PA troutguy,2014-02-15 10:16:00,58,I have been fishing the Sioux Lookout area for pike and small mouth for a number of years. Any recommendations for a quality pike and/or small mouth fishery in Eastern Ontario? I have my on Lund Impact 1775. Thanks
2454137,kzoofisher,2014-02-15 12:42:00,5144,"I have heard some good things about this camp but haven't fished it myself. I have had good experiences with the owners at their other camp. Quite a bit closer to you than Sioux Lookout. You might look into the Ontario Quebec border too, some of those lakes have gotten good reviews on this site. If you google up camp names you can do a search for them in this forum and get info that way. Best of luck.http://www.prairiebeecamps.com/"
2454305,67ZL1,2014-02-15 14:04:00,277,Where in eastern Ontario were you thinking? There are literally 1000's of lakes to choose from. I grew up back there so I might be able to point you in the right direction.
2454641,zeebee,2014-02-15 17:03:00,1144,"Bay of Quinte, Lake Ont...doesnt get much better"
2454665,Rich B,2014-02-15 17:14:00,1081,www.happydaylodge.comOnly camp on the Windermere lake system.....and a separate walk-in lake with excellent smallmouth as well....camp is clean and well run....have been there 3 times over the years (it is a family operation).....and has decent walleye and lake trout.Good luck with your search.Rich B
2454841,gordy28,2014-02-15 18:25:00,437,"We liked Brennan Harbour Lodge Great average smallmouth size, good pike and musky, walleye and trout to boot.Www.brennanharbour.com Will definitely be better with a larger boat than the lodges. It's on the whalesback channel of lake Huron and can get rough Gordy"
2454889,67ZL1,2014-02-15 18:50:00,277,"I would suggest Bob's Lake in eastern Ontario. There are a couple of lodges that operate on that lake. That lake has so much structure and shoreline that I think it would take you years to fish it all. Now just a bit further in the Kawartha's you have the Trent Severn. Good bass, pike, walleye and musky up there. We are currently looking to buy a cottage on those two bodies of water FWIW. If you're looking for more of a rustic experience you can check out Land O Lakes area. Lots of clean Canadian Shield lakes to choose from that are loaded with bass."
2455721,PA troutguy,2014-02-16 06:32:00,58,"67 I did some fishing around Gogama several years ago, I fished for a week to catch what I catch in a day around Sioux Lookout. I tried around Deux Riveres last August, and that may have potential. It takes me about 11 hours to make Deux Riveres. You may send a PM if you like.I will check out the other lodges mentioned as well. It takes me 13 hours to make Sault Ste. Marie.thanksbill"
2463177,MrSimon,2014-02-18 09:50:00,922,"This is kind of off topic .... Make sure you get good current info on whatever place you go to. It seems that some lakes in Ontario see their pike population take a huge hit as the smallmouth population goes up. Smallies are aggressive shallow water feeders and can eat a TON of pike fry. Pike don't guard their babies and a couple dozen hungry smallies can wipe out an entire bay of pike fry. As an example, one of the portage lakes at Happy Day Lodge (mentioned earlier in the thread) used to be a top notch pike lake. One of the best around for size and numbers. Now, not so much. There certainly are still pike in there ..... but the smallmouth have taken over - they are EVERYWHERE and BIG! It seems worse on the lakes with mostly rocky structure, like the lake I'm talking about. If there are good amounts of weeds, the pike do better."
2464497,zeebee,2014-02-18 17:09:00,1144,"What do you consider eastern Ont. In Ontario, eastern Ontario is considered the area approaching the Quebec border. Points west of Thunder-Bay are N-W Ontario. The area between North Bay and Thunder Bay is northern Ont. The area west of Toronto is western Ontario...as you approach Lake Huron and the area from Toronto south along Lake Ont is S-W Ont. Seems to be a lot of confusion based on the answers Im reading. Most seem to think central and northern Ont are considered east."
