Can someone suggest a resonably priced (read free?) program for connecting the separate clips into one longer video? I'd like to do the same thing with the short clips I get of the grandsons.Thanks,NimstugStop childhood sexual abuse, NOW!"

Just go to your programs and mine was listed under windows live movie maker. Another option is go to a website such as Sony Vegas, they have several editing software programs listed. You can try them out on a trial basis and purchase later if you like them. There are other websites out there with similar editing software. I use Sony Vegas Pro, which isn't for you, but I do like there line of products. Steve"
