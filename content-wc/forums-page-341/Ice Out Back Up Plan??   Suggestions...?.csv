Having never booked for this early in season we knew there was some risk but never thought it would happen the first year...For those of you in my position for 2014 or those of you that have dealt with this in the past, do you work out a back up plan with the current outfitter, find an alternative outfitter more south the same week? Do you have to send a second deposit? Does the original outfitter refund your deposit? Looking at what realistic options are for a back up plan...Any help would be great. Thanks wise ones!"
2510810,Whopper,2014-03-03 09:42:00,340,First off call your outfitter and see what options you have with them. Last year we had to postpone our walleye opener trip two weeks and took the next available opening with our outfitter. Turned out great for us in the catching department and the weather was a lot better than the typical opening week

If you send in a second deposit to an alternate lodge then back out of one of them at the last minute, I would think you'd end up losing one of the two deposits, and the lodge would be out revenue. Check with your lodge, but I'm sure if you're unable to fish due to ice, they'd refund your deposit. Rain, cold, or snow would be another story, but if there's ice on the water, the lodge won't be open for business. In my opinion, I wouldn't worry too much about it. I've seen from the postings of the folks that live in the area that they believe ice out will be near the normal time."

Of course, I'd imagine the biggest issue is if you want a backup outpost for the same week. Anyway. I really hope it works out for you guys and everyone else with an early season booking."
2514522,JayM5209,2014-03-04 08:24:00,1050,"I know some folks have had the experience of needing to reschedule because of late ice out, but in 36 years of trips to the area you're going to my group has never had to reschedule or miss a trip. For the first fifteen years we always went opening week, since then it's always the 2nd week (Memorial Day week). Last year I decided to do a solo trip the 1st week of the season then meet up with my usual group for week 2. I followed with interest the speculation on WC concerning the late ice out.Because of the depth of folks' concern and the agony of their forced prolonged wait for ice out, I decided a Plan B, or some alternative back up course of action was called for. It took less than five minutes to have it in place . . . . . . . I went to my stack of ""To Read"" books, picked out five or six and carried them to the garage and added them to the pile for Canada, and everything was set.The ice went off the lake I was on Wednesday before opening Saturday. I fished instead of reading books but either would have been a great week. Once my reservation is made, I'll be in camp, ice or not. I go to NWO to fish, but there's a lot more to do and see and hear and enjoy. I understand that a scheduled fly-in adds a bit of complication, but I'd be there as scheduled, understanding I may have to hang out elsewhere for several days.Just last evening I read a line that said, ""We don't go to the green forests and the crystal waters to rough it. We go to smooth it. We rough it enough at home."" A couple books, a deck of cards, and an extra large can of coffee will get ya through a week long fishing trip, regardless of what the gods decide to toss your way."
