2513722,Fisher919,2014-03-04 05:41:00,4,I planning to fly my 2 sons and I to a fishing place in ontario. I have been looking around but there are so many places I don' know where to start. Does anyone have a recommendation for a specific lodge or area to look into.
2513930,prov1800,2014-03-04 06:37:00,5010,"I hear you.lots of places to look at.I can only give you information that I have experience with.I live and guide in the vermilion bay area.we have a lot of great lodges to stay at in this area.depending of course on the price tag.not sure what you exactly are looking for.fly out wise I would recommend clarkes northern lights, they have some fantastic lakes with any species you want or some lakes have multiple species.they are located oncedar lake at there main base camp which is also a great place to spend a week.if you need more specific info just ask or message me."
2513962,SinOrSwim,2014-03-04 06:55:00,1528,"We did fly-ins for about 17 years. In that time we used a few different outfitters. Our favorite lake to go to was North and South Gull through Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout which used to be part of Slate Falls Outposts. Have also been to Minniss through Slate Falls. To be perfectly honest the fishing was better at Gull but Verne at Slate Falls is hands down the best outfitter we had in all those years.Used Slate Falls airways and they fly out and pick up ON TIME. Had maybe twice in about 12 years there was a delay due to weather. CAn't control that. Cabins were always in great shape. Indoor toilets, shower etc., Solar power Decent boats with very good motors. Some very good fishign not far from either cabin. Cost got the better of our group and we switched to a drive in camp about 3 years ago. Cost, plus some don't like to fly and some have breathing machines.So, it's been a couple years but either FishRedPine.com or Slatefallsoutposts.com and you will enjoy yourself.BUt, lots of places to go."

2514002,phishfearme,2014-03-04 07:03:00,1242,"more specifics would help. for example, ""remote outpost"" is different than a ""remote lodge"" - do you want to be isolated with a lake all to yourselves (outpost), or be among a group (or even a crowd) of people (lodge). in much of Quebec and eastern Ontario, there are now so many roads that flyin services are usually not needed. in western Ontario - starting say at wawa and west, flyins are usually needed to get to what can be a huge lake - and privacy if you want it. depending on your level of fishing experience, you may want to be among others to get some pointers and experience. there's lots of free maps listing outfitters - try the free map from: http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/enquiries.cfm browse the web sites looking for what you want then search on this site for reports. phish"
2514410,adempsey,2014-03-04 08:11:00,963,"You need to narrow it down some more first.How far are you willing to travel? Do you want an outpost or a lodge? American Plan? How remote? How rustic?What fish do you want to target? What size lake? Numbers or trophy?Most important of all, budget. Are your children <16 years old? Many places offer discounts of 50% for children. Especially during the summer.I'd recommend contacting Mike on his site as well."
2515034,JohnnyV12,2014-03-04 10:00:00,9,"Do you own your own boat ? A lower cost option would be a boat in Adventure. My Son and I have gone to Pipestome Lake By EMO, Ontario a few times. Gatewaynorthoutfitters run by Lucas and Nicloe Adams have a Boat in Cabin 20 miles up the Lake in the Northwest arm. Great Setting: All species available. Big Muskies , Walleyes , Smallmouth and Lake trout. My 2 cents - John V from Minnesota"
2515402,new hips,2014-03-04 11:38:00,498,"After 30 trips to the far North.......we have done just about every type of trip. You need to more specific........remember you can fly into most any camp.........you have to ask about access.......fish camp?........some have camp managers.......really remote lakes we still saw canoers coming thru. Most of the lakes are connected by streams and rivers. What species ? do you want sheer numbers?..........or trophy. Most trout lakes are clearer and a little harder to fish. What time of year?.......Our first fly in was with Big Hook.......rustic camps but loaded with walleye and Northern. Best to decide on one specific area and ask this forum whose been there. There is a wealth of knowledge and helpfulness here. When picking a new lake I find out as much information about it before putting in a deposit, there are some clunkers out there. What are your expectations? Kind of hard narrowing down your choices when you have a quarter of a million lakes to choose from. WC people are the best at helping you make that decision."
2516170,Fisher919,2014-03-04 14:53:00,4,I was hoping to fish for mainly walleye at an outpost camp. I am not looking for a five star lodge but a place where I can catch walleye and maybe pike as a bonus. Thanks
2516194,Skywagon,2014-03-04 15:02:00,1106,"Most of these guys are posting about spots in NW Ontario, if you are from NJ, are you willing to come this far (long ways from NJ)? You mentioned flying, did you mean commercial or flying yourself? that might have some baring on your choices. Lots of great options, narrow it down just a little more."
