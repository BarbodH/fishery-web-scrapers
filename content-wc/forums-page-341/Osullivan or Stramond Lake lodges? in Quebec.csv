I have researched both and they both sound pretty good.This would be our first trip to quebec after many trips into Ontario. Thanks1-shot"

This will be our first visit since the new owners have taken over. The walleye and Lake Trout fishing can be very good. We do not target northerns, but have caught some up to 15 lbs. I have friends who like to fish O'Sullivan. I have never stayed there."

We met Russell from O'Sullivan and really liked him. There is a lot of positive feedback from his outfit on this forum. (With one exception; something about being charged for ""supposed"" prop damage).If we did not choose the fly-in option, we were going to go with O'Sullivan. The main reason we favored O'Sullivan was the care they seemed to take to make sure the client got the trip they were looking for. The folks at Stramond were really good about responding to e-mails as we researched them. They have newer camps."
