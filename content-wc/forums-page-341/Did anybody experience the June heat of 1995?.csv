2510490,prov1800,2014-03-03 08:45:00,5010,"Welcome to canada.we get heat waves every year.just not always in a certain month.2013 we had it the last week of August. Over 100 degress.I was taking guests out at 5 am.took some muskie boys out from greenbay (ya you guys) at 5 am and were supposed to go till noon.but went to almost 5 pm.hotter than you know what.even caught one, missed one.and kept seeing some later in the day.so what the neck, stay out longer.but man the heat didnt let up for a week."
2511850,Tylumps,2014-03-03 15:18:00,73,"If the nights would have cooled jut a little bit, we would have enjoyed ourselves. My family would always bring ridiculous amounts of beer and bring some beer back most years. Drank every drop of beer in 95 that's for sure."
2496898,Guest,2014-02-27 14:48:00,0,Here's some video from the stormhttp://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/07...wn_anniversary
2497418,tooski,2014-02-27 17:09:00,393,I agree with Skywagon... cooler is better but my question would be were you close to overweight? Even a severe heat wave as happened would still only partially affect lift parameters... Maybe Sky can weigh back in on this as it has been a while since I flew.
2497786,michigan walleye guy,2014-02-27 18:40:00,95,"Remember it very well! We were staying at Wintering Lake north of Ignace. I remember taking a filet knife to my jeans so that I could convert them to shorts, and just soaking in the shallow water during the heat of the day.Totally oblivious to what was going on in the States--as we crossed the border, the OJ Simpson White Bronco fiasco was in full flame, and I remember wondering what the heck was going on.Never knowing the scorching heat of the summer of '95 was going to give way to one of the coldest winters on record, the winter of '95-'96. This winter is reminding me of that one."
2498122,pjshorthorn,2014-02-27 20:11:00,5654,"Didn't endure the summer of '95 heat, but sure did feel the winter effects going into '96. We knew we were in trouble while driving to Sioux Lookout for the opener in May when we got to Duluth and the Grand Lady was still frozen solid. Sat at the dock for two days waiting for the ice to go out."
2498634,Ogoki,2014-02-28 01:48:00,291,"Mk mentioned the straight line winds in 1999. Fourth of July week that year , my wife and I was on a fly in canoe trip about 50 miles north of Armstrong. Tent was tied down very good and we also were concerned with the heavy rains . Spent a day and a half in the tent . Got some awesome pictures of the sky and clouds . We were camped near a two mile long gorge. The thunder would echo down the gorge sounding like a large coil spring boncing . Never heard anything like it before or since. I was thankful I had pitched the tent where I did and away from dead trees. Will never forget that trip."
2499922,Tylumps,2014-02-28 09:22:00,73,"I think the bronco chase was 94. I was home when the chase happened so I think the years might be off for you. Made me think about how the news is really a major deal when we get back out of the bush though. One year we came back to see that Michael Jackson died while we were gone, people like yourself missed the ""Bronco Chase"" in June of 94. Maybe a thread about what you have missed while in the bush is in order!!!"
2500458,ret-ro,2014-02-28 11:24:00,41,"I remember it well, I was up tent camping with a group on the English river. We got cooked fishing during the day. We would find shady spots to eat our sandwiches for lunch and cool off for a bit. A few guys didn't bring enough water with during the day and were drinking the river water. We would cook dinner and then everyone would boat over to a shelfed rock and swim and bath to cool off every night. That way you could actually get comfortable to sleep. Then there are the years that it snowed."
2508618,luv2fishcanada,2014-03-02 17:24:00,41,95 was the year of the heat. Was on Gullrock. Could only stand fishing from about 0500-1100 and then again from about 1900-2200. I was a younger buck then and had to sleep on the top bunk. It was miserable. No breeze no way to cool cabin down. Ran extension cords out onto the deck to cook anything. Remember jumping into the lake a few times trying to cool off. Fishing was good in the early mornings. Barely beat going to work.
2508858,Paul H,2014-03-02 18:50:00,1232,"Dug out my notes from past years. July 29 - Aug 5 New Boat Carpet just before leaving Wrecked = never got there - explanation - spent a coupe long days re-carpeting the boat. Hotter than **** at home in Ohio. - during a thunderstorm near Dunkirk NY - boat got rear ended and totaled. Never made it to Ontario. It was still hotter th Hades at home,ended up spending a week at Va. Beach. A block inland and it would be 110."
2510386,Mike Kansas,2014-03-03 08:30:00,1463,Had the wife with me that year on Lac Seul. After the first day she would not get in the boat until the last hour of the day. I fished everyday but the fishing was tough. I remember that the water was as flat as I had ever seen it. It was definitly a sun screen week even for the minnows. Mike Kansas
2495130,Tylumps,2014-02-27 07:42:00,73,I have a funny video of my dad trying to get the boats off the floating dock and on to the beach. The floating dock was a rocking that is for sure. He could hardly stand up. I think it was 99 or 2001 I will try to look it up on my trip video's. The wind was blowing in so no place for us to hide. Could not get the boats in the water for 2 days. The lake we were at had two camps and the other camp had the wind to their backs so they could fish. The group was with us so we had radio's and we watched with binoculars as they stood on shore and had some luck. Crazy
2495946,oldfart,2014-02-27 11:31:00,21,"Flew out of Red Lake that year...the outfitter had built a new cabin at the lake, and it was sitting out in the open with a southern exposure...ended up trying to sleep in the boats at night to try to cool down...when we flew out on Saturday, the plane couldn't fly until close to sundown because of no lift due to the heat...was still 105 in Red Lake when we headed home...thank God for AC in the vehicles!!!!!"
2496106,Tylumps,2014-02-27 12:17:00,73,"If the nights would have cooled a bit it would have been bearable. Interesting on the lift issue, I always thought it was the other way around regarding lift, hot days better than cold days for the planes. Well your pilot would know better than me. Glad your air worked when you left that day.....air conditioners usually pick the hottest days to fail"
2496138,ftfarms,2014-02-27 12:21:00,444,I remember it well. Fishing from Saturday when we got to lac suel was very very tough Than a storm came though on Wednesday night and fishing on Friday was awesome. One of the best days ever in Canada. But the first part of the week was by far the worst I've ever had. Most people had packed up on Thursday and left so we didn't see many boats on Friday. My 11 year old son caught a 23lb northern and we caught several 5-8 lb walleyes all on Friday. So it was the worst week we've had but the best one day weve had.
2496146,Skywagon,2014-02-27 12:22:00,1106,Cold=better lift.
2496154,Tylumps,2014-02-27 12:26:00,73,With a name like Skywagon...you must be a pilot
2496338,tv4fish,2014-02-27 12:45:00,2694,"Yes, I remember that year all too well. Absolutely miserable. No sleep at night - no breeze during the day. We would move from fishing spot to fishing spot just to cool off a little. We tried to buy ice in Sioux lookout - there was NONE to be had - we had to drive down to Dryden to find ice. No extra fans for the cabin either. We ended up renting an ""industrial"" fan in Dryden. As a result of that trip, we now bring plenty of fans - like 2 apiece for each of us."
2496370,billy weaver,2014-02-27 12:59:00,470,I was fishing close to Ear Falls in 95 and remember the heat well. Is that the year there was so many forest fires?
2496466,Skywagon,2014-02-27 13:15:00,1106,"Yes, it's the model name of my plane."
2496874,Guest,2014-02-27 14:45:00,0,"This describes what I'm talking about: (from Wilderness News Online) ""Tomorrow marks the 10th anniversary of the famed Boundary Waters Blowdown. On July 4, 1999 a huge storm packing 90-mile-per-hour winds ripped through the BWCAW, uprooting trees, blocking portages, and leaving every one of the 3,000 campers in the wilderness that day with one heck of a story to tell. In all 370,000 acres in the BWCAW were affected by the storm. Minnesota Public Radio's Stephanie Hemphill returned to the BWCA with the Forest Service's John Pierce to remember the epic day, HERE. Pierce was fishing on Basswood Lake when the blowdown hit, seeking safety at the waters edge despite trees toppling all around him. Since then, fires have raged through some of the blowdown areas and across the blowdown acres, new tress and new species are taking the places of those lost in the storm."" We were in a cabin on the edge of Quiteco Park when it hit. It lasted only about 5-10 minutes but we were lucky enough to at the cabin when it hit. Lake went from near calm to huge whitecaps in about 2-3 minutes. Strangest thing I'd ever seen."
2494274,Tylumps,2014-02-26 20:47:00,73,"Did anybody else experience the June heat of 1995? My friends and family went on a fly in just northeast of Wawa Ontario in June 1995. We had heat 5 out of the 7 days over 100 degrees. We put all our chairs in the water (we had a sandy beach area) and huddled under a small pine tree for some shade when not in the water. All our refrigerated food spoiled because the propane fridges could not keep up. We caught fish so we ate what we caught and ate dry foods like powdered pancake batter and noodles toward the end of the trip.All the ice blocks we brought were gone in 1 day. We used a cold water spring for keeping our beer and pop cold. The spring was not available by walking, we had to use a boat and go 1/4 mile across the lake to fetch drinks.Sleeping was miserable. The heat never left at night and the top bunks were just unbearable. We survived. Did any one else?"
2494698,Mike Borger,2014-02-27 05:33:00,1554,"Don't remember '95 specifically, but I've had plenty of trips in heat like that.On the plus side there's usually no bugs. What I've always done in a pinch to keep beverages cold is put them in a mesh bag with some rocks and sink them into the lake below the thermocline. Use a marker buoy or jug to mark the line.Water is cold down there and your drinks will be too.I've mostly done this canoe tripping in the summer, but have done it on occasion at outpost camps when the fridge wasn't working.In this particular back lake trip report we did just that http://www.canadafishingguide.net/tr...game-preserve/"
2494714,Skyraptor,2014-02-27 05:41:00,291,Don't remember 95 in particular but have been on trips to Canada where it has been plenty warm. Remember one time it was so hot that within an hour of hitting the lake all the minnows in the bait bucket were belly-up due to the warm lake water. Also in the middle of the afternoon it would get so hot in the boat that we would put the rods down and just jump out of the boat in the middle of the lake to cool off. Of course we remembered to shut off the motor.
2494794,Babamel2,2014-02-27 06:21:00,414,"We were near Dryden On that June. One morning we got up at 4:30 and out on the water by 5:30. In early June at 5:30 am one always has to have a heavy coat, etc. However that year, I had a T shirt and a flannel shirt which was unbutttoned as we were leaving the dock and going the few miles toward our fishing spot. By 11:00 am we were back at the cabin, it was tuesday, by 3:00 pm we decided to call it quits, packed up and headed home."
2494882,Skywagon,2014-02-27 06:47:00,1106,"If this years temperature trend continuous the way it has been going, you won't be overheating this summer. Currently -29F with a wind chill of -47F (and it's almost March)."
2495018,Tylumps,2014-02-27 07:28:00,73,"My Grandfather died years earlier, but if he was on that trip we would have had to go home early. The heat was just so unusual that June. We drive up from Detroit area and the week we were gone was in the high 80's tops. It was a strange unlucky week."
2495026,zeebee,2014-02-27 07:29:00,1144,Coldest winter here in 35 years. Ice out by July.......
2495066,Guest,2014-02-27 07:32:00,0,"Couldn't remember the year but it had to be that one. Unbearably hot. It was too hot for the propane fridge to do any good but luckily we'd taken in one large cooler with nothing but large block ice. It lasted a few days and then, mid-week, our outfitter flew in with another large cooler with ice that lasted the rest of the week. He was hitting all his outposts with coolers of ice. THANK YOU, Canoe Canada! Worse for us was a couple years later when there was a big straight-line wind storm. Late 90's sometime, maybe 98-99? They said the winds were 75-90 mph. All I know is that it snapped a 18"" dia pine tree in half right behind the cabin and it landed on the crapper. Trees were uprooted and snapped in half around the lake."
2495082,SinOrSwim,2014-02-27 07:36:00,1528,"One of the reasons we go in September is to avoid the heat. However, it seems lately that hasn't happened. Last year we went approx Sept 6 to 11th. I wore a fleece and shorts the first night we got there and other than putting on a rain coat in the morning ride out, didn't put long sleeves on again. We had one year on a fly-in they came in to check on us a day before we were scheduled to leave. We asked if we could just go back it had been so hot. Every single day was in the low to mid 90's. Can't sleep in that and half the time we put life jackets on like diapers and jumped in the lake at the end of the dock. It was absolutely miserable. The thing is, we can deal with the heat during the day if it cools off at night. Another reason we go in September. The year we left a day early it never cooled off at night. Would get down to low 70's and maybe high 60's but for brief periods and the cabin NEVER cooled down. No fans to move air."
2495122,tooski,2014-02-27 07:41:00,393,"Yes, I remember that year. We were on a train-in out of Cartier and the heat buckled the tracks causing multiple derailments. The engineer said he had only seen it happen once before....."
