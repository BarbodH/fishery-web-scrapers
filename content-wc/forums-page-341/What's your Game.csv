2514770,Knoxabilly,2014-03-04 08:58:00,225,My family plays Tripoly which I think is a version of this...Great game!
2516866,NathanH,2014-03-04 17:47:00,697,"Right on Mike. Me too. I fish with my dad and since he is retired he fishes 5-6 days a week. I spend the downtime cleaning up his tackle. Org the box sharpen hooks,hook replacement."
2516930,Bowtech84,2014-03-04 18:00:00,572,"Boorah, pinochle, euchre and sometimes hand and foot when the better halfs are around.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
2517498,Glenman12,2014-03-04 20:11:00,762,also known as Michigan rummy I believe...never played it up north but its a family staple on Thanksgiving and Xmas...
2510802,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-03 09:35:00,1460,"Yeah, pretty poorly worded post. Didn't mean to offend you or your raingear, lol but there are times when being out on the water is unsafe. Let me clarify. When a thunderstorm blows in and ya just don't feel like being a lightning rod out on the lake......... Yeah, it's pretty rare to get blown off the lake, but we play cards usually every night between 11:00-midnight or so or when the camp is cleaned and we are packed up or waiting for the float plane to pick us up."
2511410,LOW1,2014-03-03 12:51:00,2828,Not me. If the forecast for this afternoon is for strong rain and wind I am not opposed to staying in the cabin this morning in case the forecast gets the timing wrong. There was a time when I was willing to get frog-sucking wet and cold and miserable in order to catch a fish. Not any more.
2511538,Lovetofish,2014-03-03 13:51:00,458,"Euchre, hearts, cribbage. Depends how many want to play. If we are in the cabin during the afternoon I'm usually taking a nap. A Canadian afternoon rain puts me right to sleep."
2511554,MrSimon,2014-03-03 13:58:00,922,"We like poker, but usually just sit around and talk if the weather is bad. Or sleep."
2512298,Simple Man,2014-03-03 17:04:00,92,"No card games....just good music, tons of booze, some kind of extremely unhealthy food being cooked that our wives wouldnt let us eat at home and many lies about the Glory days of our youth!"
2512330,Tylumps,2014-03-03 17:16:00,73,"The kids love Michigan Rummy. Its easy and involves money. Not sure if it as popular with others as it is with my family, but it consists of a canvas playing surface that is easy to pack. The playing surface has all the hearts 10 and up in a circle to hold chips or coins for every hand. I wont bore you with all the rules but it is easy to teach and any age can play as long as they know what a spade, diamond heart and club are. Great way to get the kids gambling."
2513546,Sportdog,2014-03-04 00:50:00,6735,"Euchre, Spades, or as mentioned zzzzzz!"
2513850,fishinnut 3446,2014-03-04 06:22:00,638,"Ahh yes ! The Son and I were fishing down in Portage Bay and we heard some rumbling, We looked at each other and said WTF! We have Bluebird sky's that can't be thunder! Packed up and headed back and as soon as we made it through the S curve (where you can see Strawberry Island) I knew we were not making it back in 4'-5' er's, So we beached the boat and rode the storm out with lighting all around us ."
2514026,tv4fish,2014-03-04 07:04:00,2694,"Glad to see ""hearts"" mentioned. We also do the ""Mexican Train"" domino game - that WILL burn up some time.......... (I insist that we turn OFF the darn whistle)."
2514066,REG,2014-03-04 07:14:00,445,Another vote for Euchre.
2508810,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-02 18:40:00,1460,"Steller Same with my family.Quote: Originally Posted by Jack77Can't believe that euchre isn't an option.

2509090,JOE WALLEYE,2014-03-02 19:51:00,753,my thoughts exactly
2509850,Obabikon,2014-03-03 06:12:00,2370,We play hearts pretty much non stop.
2509882,Bigstorm,2014-03-03 06:26:00,799,"We've never been blown off the lake, we fish a river system that connects many lakes to gether so there is always some place to fish out of the wind. Every night we do play euchre though"
2509954,Cash,2014-03-03 06:54:00,73,If there's 4 we play hearts or pepper. The last couple years it's just been me and my daughter so we play gin rummy.
2510194,camp chef,2014-03-03 07:58:00,915,If it is just me and my fishing partner we play Gin. If we have more people with us we have a cribbage tourney.
2510242,dog2,2014-03-03 08:06:00,198,We go to fish or hunt not to play ! That play time is for the evening With a cold one.If its light we are on the water might be in or on a low catch area but I didn't buy the foul weather gear to sit in the cabin every time it rains or snows. We fish connecting waters out of the wind
2510258,prov1800,2014-03-03 08:08:00,5010,"I guide on eagle, and we go no matter what.west winds are the worst coming out of our bay.**** of a ride to get out but once out there are all kinds of places to fish.only time we dont leave the dock is if there is a lot of lightning, that stuff scares me.have some great fishing on some of those days.ride back to camp can be interesting to.lol."
2510346,Mike Kansas,2014-03-03 08:22:00,1463,"No games, just making sure that everyone has the lures they want for the next time in the boat and checking the poles to make sure there are no frayed lines or other problems. Maybe a little meal prepping like mixing up a cobbler and slipping it in the oven. Oh yeah can't forget those powernaps!!!!! Mike Kansas"

2508602,97roughneck,2014-03-02 17:20:00,899,"We play 10 point pitch- hi, low, jick, jack, joker, joker, game and the 3 of trump counts for 3 points."
2508658,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-02 17:37:00,1460,"So it's a 10 point/hand game, right, so I take it, in order of power...joker, joker, ace, king, queen, jack, off color jack. How do ya know which joker is power? What do you play to? Sounds fun."

2508762,97roughneck,2014-03-02 18:25:00,899,"There are many variations, this is how we usually play- 4 handed, with partners. Each player gets a chance to bid, min. bid is 4. Bid winner announces trump, play begins. In order of power- ace, king, queen, jack, jick(same color as trump, ie; spades is trump, the jack of clubs is jick) joker, joker, game (10=game) trey, deuce. In the event both jokers fall on same trick, first joker takes the second. Play to 31. In the event both teams ""go out"" (pass 31) in the same hand, the bidder wins."

2508802,97roughneck,2014-03-02 18:33:00,899,"That's one variation of our 10 point pitch. We call it ""racehorse"" and play it if we're short on time."
2507706,Pikeslayer8,2014-03-02 13:24:00,1460,"So you are blown off the water, what's your game till she blows over?"
