Canadian moneyThe government is again allowing us, as tour operators, to credit your tax rebate (half of the tax paid on accommodations) right off your invoice! No more paperwork for you to fill out! No more receiving a cheque from the Canadian government in Canadian dollars! Their only requirement is that ""a deposit of 25% of the price of the accommodation package be paid more than 30 days in advance of the first night of accommodation"". In most cases, our current deposit of $400 will meet this requirement. Guests staying 6 nights or longer, who wish to take advantage of this program, will need to increase their deposit to be in compliance. Reservations that don't meet this requirement can still apply for the tax rebate directly to the government. The rebate form is on the government website; we'll give you the link when you are checking out."""

There you go, If your criteria for choosing a resort is based on the method of rebate used, you would be advised to ask in advance."

Left to do it for ourselves it often is forgotten or, on several occasions, didn't get filled out properly or for some other reason the rebate was never received."
2516738,Obabikon,2014-03-04 17:17:00,2370,"I just got my account number, and am planning on rebating directly off of guests bills this year. In previous years, I had the forms and walked them through the process at check out. I'm pumped that I can take it directly off now."
2516810,Shellback,2014-03-04 17:38:00,8083,Saves a customer paying bank fees. Why give them a few percent when you can keep it between you and the outfitter. Fortunately I have a Canadian friend and we swap cash quite often. We both save on the bank exchange fees. This year he will make out pretty good as there's about a 10% difference. I guess I'll have to suck down a few extra beers at his house. LOL!
