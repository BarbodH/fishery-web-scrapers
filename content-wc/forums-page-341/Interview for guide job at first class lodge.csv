2415377,GuideBoy,2014-02-03 13:24:00,7,"Hi, I have an interview for a guide job for a first-class lodge in Northern Ontario soon. Iv'e worked a few guide jobs before, but never fishing, and never with such a pressure to produce. This is my dream job for the summer and I really want to make a good impression. I get that although I love fishing, I'm there the help you guys land those big ones.Let me know any tips, what you look for in a guide, and any good or bad guide experiences you've had. Any help would be great, thanks!EDIT: Also it's a phone interview haha."
2415393,Obabikon,2014-02-03 13:35:00,2370,"Good luck. Go clean shaven with a clean appearance. Be positive, smile, and use proper/polite English. One of the biggest fears resorts have when hiring is that the person will be unreliable. A professional appearance will put that at ease.Well, phone interviews are different. But, reliability and professionalism is still key."
2415465,mrwalleye5,2014-02-03 13:53:00,1922,"I was at a high end lodge a few years ago. Our guide, a blond haired young fellow, asked us what we wanted to fish for. Both of us replied, walleye. He asked if we were interested in trolling for big northerns, we replied no. Before the day was over he had us trolling for northerns. He used the excuse that we were trolling for walleye with big plugs. For some reason he got real excited when we hooked into northerns vs walleye. He had us fishing for what he wanted, not what we wanted. We were in a 20 person group that year. Each morning we would pick our guides for the day. It ended up he was the guide for the last pair to get to the dock. Some foot races took place to make sure this didn't happen."
2415689,Blades-n-Beads,2014-02-03 14:37:00,484,"Guideboy, my recommendation for phone interview is to be polite and have an honest answer for every question, never say I don't know. Your job as a guide is giving your time and knowledge 100% to your guests for the day. Make there stay and fishing experience the best you can and you will reap the benefits from it.$$$. Your there to make the resort money (bottom line) and make a living for yourself. And the guest are paying your wages, no guest no job! I wish the best for you. Let us know if you land the job maybe some of us will pay you a visit on the job. God bless"
2415697,thyme to fish,2014-02-03 14:38:00,307,"guiding, building, selling, serving,,,,,its all the sameask the questions....and ""listen"" to the answers...do what your client wants.....be honest....smile,,,be positive,,,,glass half full vs half empty regardless of the topicnod a lot and say ""uh huh"" if topic goes to politics or religionlastly. put'm on fish....."
2415705,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-02-03 14:38:00,629,"GuideBoy:I have been a patron of multiple Resort-Camps in Western Ontario, starting in 1985. The majority of my experiences come from trips to Lake of the Woods, Ontario, Canada. These are some of my observations of various guided trips to me personally. I'm sure that as a guide you will have to learn to read your customers as to what they are asking of you for that day. And, the tough part will be the ability to adapt to their wishes. So, from that I will pass-on what impressed me as a customer when spending time with the guide.#1. It will be important to establish & get a feel for what skill level your customers bring to you.(1st timer, Novice, somewhat experienced, fully experienced) Observe the level of equipment they bring to the boat. This will help you understand your client's skill level. Ask questions about their past fishing experiences etc.#2. Ask your client what species they are interested in catching & what style of fishing do they prefer. (Jigging, Trolling, Casting, Live or Artificial baits etc.)#3. No matter what their skill level maybe, don't be the 1st in the water!! Remember, they are looking to you for ""Their"" success for the day. Probably one of the most important aspects of your day guiding and that your customers will appreciate the most, & that is putting them on fish. Probably one of the major reasons for most people's hiring a guide is to have hired you for your local knowledge of the body of water that they are unfamiliar with.I'm sure that you will receive many other opinions as to what is important, observe them all & apply to your best ability what fits the situation @ hand. Your primary goal as a guide is to please your customers for the day & being able to understand their expectations for the day will be your hardest challenge. Put them 1st & you last.Set the Hook & Good-Luck this coming summer, CRJohn"
2415929,Pooch,2014-02-03 15:35:00,4619,"I've watched other folks leave the dock with a guide and it's interesting to just observe the interaction. See them on occasion on the lake and some don't appear to be having a good time while others look pretty happy with the experience.Many years ago we were on a large remote lake fishing in a soaking drizzle in the fog. A boat comes up along side of us and asked if we had a map as the guide had lost his bearings. He was lost. He had an older man and wife in the boat with him and all they had for a rain suit was a garbage bag with a hole for the head. The guide had no foul weather gear and was soaked and shivering. I felt really bad for the older couple and the guide, too. Do everything to not be that guy.Just have good people skills. Sometimes that does not come naturally to most of us and has to be learned. We can only see the world through our eyes. Try to put yourself in the guest's mind looking back at you. Leave your ego in the barracks.People hire a guide for help fishing. Good or experienced fishermen usually go it alone. Actually care about the folks you are helping. If they are not very good, teach them, but keep it basic. They are usually only in Canada for a brief period and need to make the best of that time. You can go fishing anytime, they can't. Just be a good guy. It's not about you, it's about them for that day. Be a good listener and remember their names so the next time you see them in camp you can greet them by name.Don't just work them for a good tip. Sure, you probably will never see them again, but you never know that for sure.Be professional in every way. Imagine ""the boss"" is watching you.When you get a guest who you just can't make or keep happy, grin and bear it. Always take the high road. Some folks are just ""takers"" and will never be happy regardless of how good of a job you do. Don't let them ruin your attitude for the next people you take out.My wife taught school all of her life and these are the things I've kind of absorbed from just listening to her. Teaching and guiding are sort of alike in many ways.This ""advice"" coming from a schmuck who has never hired a guide! Just some thoughts about how I would want to be treated if I ever asked you to guide me.Good luck and tell us where you will be if you get the job.Pooch"
2416065,Golden Eagle,2014-02-03 16:25:00,2642,"GuideBoy, I suggest providing more information about your qualifications. Where are you located? What is your age? Discuss your fishing experience. In many parts of Ontario there aren't enough decent guides available to fill openings. Guides don't have to be accomplished to be hired, but they will need to up their game in order to stay on the payroll."
2417025,Gipper,2014-02-03 20:44:00,76,"I'm stunned by this. If I hire a guide I would expect he would be able to take me to the spots on the lake where I can catch my target fish, and advise on technique, etc. Other than that, I can't imagine why anyone would hire a guide.Perhaps a guide shortage is the reason that specific fishing knowledge is not needed. Again, I'm stunned.Still hope the lad lands a job and learns along the way as long as the client knows what he's paying for."
2417881,MrSimon,2014-02-04 08:33:00,922,"Getting the job is one thing. Being good at it is completely different. Everything everyone said is excellent advice, but at the end of the day, you better be able to find fish and help people catch them. If you do get the job ..... study the lake like crazy ... make sure to have top notch electronics (buy them yourself if the lodge doesn't provide them) and spend lots of time just driving around looking for fish and good structure. Talk to everyone. Read a ton. You want to know the lake and its fish better than anyone else. If you don't have a client - you should be out scouting."
2417945,LOW1,2014-02-04 08:46:00,2828,"I have a couple thoughts. First, as others have mentioned, many people who hire guides are not avid fishermen, have a lot to learn, and hire guides to help this learning process. I am very much part of this group.First, recognize that you have a lot to learn. Volunteer to be an unpaid ""first mate"" with some other guides. Learn the lake. Strive to improve. Every guide had a ""first trip,"" and the important thing to do is to not pretend to be someone that you are not and to improve. Perhaps identify, find, and be able to easily relocate five or ten ""hotspots"" for each species that you plan to fish. Stay within your known area, but always work to expand your known area.Second, learn how to cheerfully and competently cook a good lunch. If lunch is not ""on the menu,"" bring good snacks and liberally share. It is very hard to get mad at someone who is cheerful and who has just fed you.Three, don't think of guiding as a chance for you to fish. Many people won't care if you do, but your fishing has to be seen as a far lower priority than your client's fishing.Fourth, I hope that you like kids and have the patience of Job when it comes to the same. Fifth, acquire entertainment/food service/hotel/tourist attraction customer experience. Being a waiter or a bartender could be very good experience towards being a guide.Sixth, acquire knowledge beyond fishing about the lake. What is it's history? Where was the Hudson Bay post located? What's the geology? Where were the goldmines?What kinds of birds/mammals/trees, etc are there? For example, when on the Lake of the Woods it's interesting (at least to me) to know where the WWII German POW camps were located on the lake and where the steamships are sunk. Finally, you have to have fun or you are not going to be a successful guide.Best of Luck.And for what it is worth, it is hard to find a good guide which fits the above criteria. The two that I use are frequently booked up. So there is a market for your services."
2417993,tackleman,2014-02-04 09:08:00,444,"good luck with the interview, as a part time guide, I have had a lot of experiences with the customers and you'll have to remember, there are all kinds of people who fish.I've had groups that didn't need any help but wanted someone to run the boat, and I've had groups that couldn't put a hook on their line let alone the bait. I've had groups that tip well even though they were on a tight budget and I had a group that once the trip was over, disappeared to their cabin and I had to chase to get paid for the trip even though they said it was the best fishing they had in their trip north. one thing you must know , where the fish go on a daily basis. if you can't find the fish, your guests will be very disappointed and your clientel will drop off."
2418001,v-bay gord,2014-02-04 09:19:00,3168,"if you can't find the fish, your guests will be very disappointed and your clientel will drop off. Tackleman, I assume that's the reason you're down to being part time? (sorry, couldn't resist!)"
2418257,123chadder,2014-02-04 10:26:00,429,is there a guiding school in ontario?
2418601,Mr. Sauger,2014-02-04 12:56:00,285,"Let's hold off talking about fishing for a minute and talk about the first task at hand - doing well at the phone interview. Your goal is to pass the phone interview so you can get a face to face interview and then the job offer. Of course, you will be interviewing them too about the job. What are the hours, expectations, etc? You'll need to know what they want so you can be sure that you can comply.I'm not sure what questions they will ask during the interview, but can make a pretty good guess. In other words, what things do they want to see in their next guide?· Reliability  are you mature and responsible enough to show up for work ready and on time, every time. Maybe mention to them how you have already proven you reliability with real examples.· Working with people  guiding is providing a service to people. You need to be personable and be able to get along with all types of personalities. If you have experience working with people (even if it working at Tim Hortons or whatever) mention it.· Guiding - you mentioned that you have experience guiding (not fishing). I'm not sure what type of guiding it was, but mentioning that experience can help. Remember  the job is much more than just being a good fisherman. · Lastly, is there is some fishing skillset that matches their requirements, talk about that. Remember that you are not interviewing to fisherman of the year, you are interviewing for a service job."

2419297,Carnhzkr,2014-02-04 16:13:00,964,"Fisherman Ted from Hawk Lake, right? Guideboy can disregard everything everyone else has posted and focus solely on Fisherman Ted's response. I'd quit my job today to guide at Hawk Lake. Problem is, my wife and kids have gotten spoiled. They want things like food and clothes."
2419441,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-04 16:58:00,461,"[QUOTE=Carnhzkr;2419297]Fisherman Ted from Hawk Lake, right?That would be me."

2420825,GuideBoy,2014-02-05 08:44:00,7,"Thanks for all the advice everyone! It's been really helpful, and I feel pretty good going into it now.What I got is personality, passion and customer service are at the top of the list, closely followed by a desire to learn. This basically describes me in a nutshell, but I guess now I just have to prove it.Thanks again everyone."

2421665,emma17,2014-02-05 12:25:00,436,"Best of luck to you. You don't need any more advice so I'll just reinforce w my experience. My two sons and I are intermediate level fisherman w a desire to learn all we can- especially from guides. We've been out w 5 guides over the years. Two of them approached the day as though it were a competition between the guide and us of who can catch more fish. Both were completely lacking in effort to get to know us or help us in any meaningful way. Bad. Another guide was really a great help and never put a line in the water. However, I actually prefer the guide fish- at least a while. If the guide catches a fish then we know they are down there- he can then focus on our technique. The other two were a great combination. They showed patience as we learned, they gave suggestions and tips. They shared stories (even though they've probably told the same stories a hundred times- we haven't heard them and it makes the trip that much more exciting) and asked us about our lives and our experiences. Remember you are there every day, every year. Many of your clients are new and have hopes and dreams of catching the giants you've seen many a time. Feed their excitement and always give them hope. I hope to be in your boat someday."
2421745,GuideBoy,2014-02-05 13:02:00,7,"Thanks for your experience, I love to hear the good and the bad of it. Hopefully you'll be in my boat one day too, and I'll do my best to put you on the big ones haha."
2423401,weston,2014-02-05 21:51:00,18,"I've been guiding 20 years, 15 on LOTW, let me give ya a few tips1. Boat control, boat control, boat control. good boat control will help with your guests not getting snagged (which they will do a lot) if your vertical jigging keep the lines vertical, if your casting a shoreline keep your boat far enough from shore so that your guests (depending on ability)are running their baits through the strike zone.2. Arrange your boat prior to leaving the dock, guests and gear placement is important. Balance the weight in the boat, leave your self enough room to work. If your in a tiller boat never put the heaviest guy in the front , you'll get soaked, in a console boat put the heaviest guy next to you , the boat will plane out the best. 3. Don't trust your fuel gauge, don't assume the dock boy filled you up, the guests will blame you.4. Catch fish yourself, your there to enjoy it too. plus you need to know what's going on what's working how are they biting and prove to the guest that the fish are down there.5. Be the captain of the boat not the slave. No one brags about how their guide kissed their a$$, just be genuine and nice.6. Don't bash other lodges or guides, not cool.7. Listen to ALL fishing tips from guest and other guides but don't burn their spots, if you find a spot that's working leave some fish there for another day.8. Don't drink too much, those days are over.9. Preach conservation, catch and release, don't waste fish at shorelunch and don't bring big ones in for limits our future depends on it.10. good luck!!"
2424369,zeebee,2014-02-06 09:01:00,1144,Best of luck. I guided for two summers while doing my undergrad......very fond memories and learned a lot about fishing and about people. Within a short time youll be able to filet fish in your sleep.
2419073,Carnhzkr,2014-02-04 15:27:00,964,"The best way to pass a telephone interview is to be prepared. Anticipate what types of questions you will be asked, and be prepared with your answers. I really doubt you will be asked specific technical questions such as, ""what is the best method to catch walleye in the morning on our body of water""? Rather, I would expect you'd be asked about your experience guiding, for what lodges, what did you like about your previous guiding jobs and what did you not like. Have you been fired and if so, why? Why do you want to work for this new lodge? Why do you think you're a good guide? You might be asked how you would handle certain situations, for example, what would you do if a client wanted to continue fishing after the normal time to return? What would you do if a customer offered you a beer? These are the types of ""soft"" questions I would ask if I were conducting a phone interview. Ask yourself what qualities they're looking for in a guide and demonstrate those qualities with your answers (dependability, ability to communicate well, friendliness, experience). Being prepared with good, solid answers will demonstrate that you can communicate well and be a positive representative for the lodge. Of course, they will want to hire someone that knows how to fish, but I'd imagine a lodge would provide some degree of training regarding locations and techniques.Also, and this is very important, write down five to 10 questions that you have. At some point, you will almost certainly have the opportunity to ask questions. Some of your questions will most likely be answered during the course of the interview, so have enough ready so that when the interviewer asks if you have questions, you don't say, ""no, all my questions were answered"". Think through your previous guiding experience and recall stories that demonstrate your personality or characteristics that make you sound like the type of person they would want to hire and look for opportunities to interject those stories. For example, a previous poster mentioned that the customer is always right, unless they want to do something illegal. It would be great if you had a story where you were guiding and a customer wanted to keep an illegal fish, but you wouldn't allow it. Maybe the client got mad, you apologized but held firm. As long as it was handled in a professional manner, without a shouting match, that's the type of story that would make you stand out if I were hiring.Good luck!"
2419217,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-04 15:47:00,461,"We look at hundreds of resumes and have even more phone interviews every year for the limited amount of guides we hire. The most important thing for a guide from my (an owner's standpoint) is personality, hands down. A guide needs to be intelligent, energetic, engaging and pleasant to be around. The rest can all be taught. If you can't hold a conversation and have little passion and even less energy I don't care if you can out-fish Al Lindner. Nor will our guests. -Fisherman Ted"
2419265,Fisherman Ted,2014-02-04 16:04:00,461,"Ironically we put all our new guides through a 10 day on-site course at the lodge before we open. This includes classroom instruction, on the water instruction and testing. We also bring in old guides that have fished and worked the lodge for years to help train the new ones. As I said, everything can be taught, but not passion."
2416081,kzoofisher,2014-02-03 16:31:00,5144,"Definitely find out all you can about the lake before your interview. A little practical knowledge about the way they do things there or spots that produce in different seasons can show the lodge owner that you are serious about getting clients into fish. Also have a cheat sheet, easy for a phone interview, covering the boating requirements and fishing regs for that particular body of water. The customer is always right unless the customer wants to break the law. Some lodges might be hyper sensitive to that right now. Have you taken a boater safety course or can you before spring? Certifications are both a confidence builder and show professionalism. Very good advice above about finding out what the customer wants, sometimes they say it more with actions and attitude than with words. If there are ever kids on a trip try to make sure you spend more time untangling their messes than Dad does, he's on vacation too. Good luck."
2416249,packpro,2014-02-03 17:12:00,695,"I've done some hiring in my day. Usually we ended up with a hand full of qualified candidates. All would have the requisite, appearance, qualifications, character, skills (people skills), etc. Ultimately one aspect would shine through. In fact, it would even make up for others areas where the candidate would possibly fall a little short. That trait is- passion. Control your enthusiasm, but definitely let the interviewer know how much you love what you do. The joy of the accomplishment of others is what drives you. Training a beginner or meeting the demands of a season vet, even validating the tough customers. (Up managing). Bring the enthusiasm, bring the passion, be sincere in your approach to the interviewer and good luck to you."
