There is a bad storm coming into St. Louis tonight with freezing rain, sleet and then snow starting tomorrow into Monday morning. Be careful traveling. Maybe I'll catch up with you this summer while I'm in Nestor Falls. Always liked fishing muskies in Obabikon Bay and Lake. Some really nice fish near your camp. Have a good show."
