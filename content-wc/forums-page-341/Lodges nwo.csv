Its narrowed down to Bayview lodge in Minaki, Perrault lake camp, Rainbow point Lodge, or Big Pine Lake camp in nestor falls. Does anyone have any experience on these lakes and staying at these resorts? Mainly targeting walleye but wouldn't mind going for crappies if the lake holds them."
2476473,camp chef,2014-02-22 13:35:00,915,"I don't know anything about Bayview but we love the Winnipeg River around the Minaki area. We have fished there a lot . Great Walleye, northern, Muskie and bass fishing.Check out Big north Lodge. It is just south of Minaki and a little more secluded without all the boat traffic you get right in Minaki. You have access to all the same fishing without the hassle of all the people."
2476745,walleyeslayer22,2014-02-22 15:19:00,2,narrowed it down to Perrault falls or Rainbow point lodge. Anyone stay at either? i've heard the lake is hard to fish but people say Brereton in whiteshell MB is brutal to fish. Ended up catching 200+ walleye this fall. Challenge is always good.

2506066,OldRook,2014-03-02 07:06:00,16,"The folks at rainbow point are first class. Stayed there twice and trailered my boat to various lakes in the area. Perrault was tough but we managed a few good ones Cedar, wabaskang, Lac Seul and the English river below the ear falls dam were a blast."
