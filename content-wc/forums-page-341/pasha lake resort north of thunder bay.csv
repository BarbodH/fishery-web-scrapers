2503066,stjoeguy,2014-03-01 07:41:00,979,"There have been many, many posts regarding Pasha Lake. Search the Canada forum. I've only been there one time. Fishing on the Little Jackfish River (an extra side-trip not included in the Pasha rate) was great. That may have approached 35 fish, but none of the other lakes in the area did for me. I didn't care for the different lake every day style of fishing, trailering boats into some lakes, hauling motors or gas into cached boats on others, etc. When I was there nobody fished Pasha Lake. The lakes we went to were anywhere from 5-45 minutes away. The lake has it's fans, so I'm sure they will tell about how great it is. The group I was with was fun and the owner is great. I just didn't care for that type of fishing and was disappointed with the number of fish caught."
