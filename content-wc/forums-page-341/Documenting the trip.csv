2506282,Glenman12,2014-03-02 07:49:00,762,Actually one year in the mid 90's we went to Wabaskang for a change of pace..did the portage down to Wine Lake...we were low on fuel and stopped in at WLC and got the grand tour and some gas to make it back...

2496578,Fish_on,2014-02-27 13:38:00,1856,My son put together this video of his muskie fishing. I realize it is not walleye but I think you will enjoy it. I think he's very talented. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB-G7xRlaPY
2496658,Carnhzkr,2014-02-27 13:55:00,964,I agree with you. Very nice.
2497154,undguy,2014-02-27 15:47:00,920,"Nice stuff. Last time we went to Tobin one of the guys put together a DVD of all our pictures and set it to ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald""."
2498026,Terwalleye,2014-02-27 19:52:00,166,Two years ago I bought a couple of Kodak Playsports on Ebay for $50 each. What an awesome deal in hindsight. They are waterprrof and take fairly decent video and pictures. (Learning to keep your hand steady is an art form though)Gave one camera to the guys in the other boat and we racked up all kinds of footage and pictures. One thing that the folks back home appreciated seeing was the camp and the cabins and the scenery. It's one thing to try and paint a picture with words; but you can't beat the video. Especially if any of y'all do a fly in. My boy was kind enough to combine it all into about a 40 minute collage of video and put it to music.Definietly the way to tie you over when daydreaming about next year. Hope to keep doing this in the future and end up with a quality library of memories. May seem like overkill a few years from now; but with winter's like this one; anything helps.
2498506,Knoxabilly,2014-02-27 21:53:00,225,"I love all the videos- they get me through until the next year. I take lots of photos every year- I want to get more video footage this year, seems like I never get enough. I love Solo Paddlers blogs and Vischouscirquel youtube videos. I live vicariously through these, they make winter a little easier!"
2498698,SPLmax Sam,2014-02-28 04:34:00,6,Videos area great way to remember your outings. Last year I took out a high school fishing buddy who hadn't fished lake erie in over 20 years. So we hoped for a good day and I shot some video for him to take homehttp://youtu.be/mOGREzzjy9c I have been playing around with MIX format - time lapse and live action time lapse was every 5 seconds. Moves way tooo fast
2502626,adempsey,2014-02-28 21:15:00,963,"Documenting life and your adventures in a far more comprehensive fashion is where we are at. Cheap equipment and even cheaper media to record on has enabled that. It's truly amazing and really hard to imagine the content that's been recorded across the globe. A real testament to technology and the ability to easily share this information. Just amazing.I admit, I am guilty of not bringing a camera with me on my trips, but I do plan on changing that. There is no reason not to, given the size and compactness of the current high quality cameras and recording media.Keep it up, I think it's just awesome!"
2503426,Glenman12,2014-03-01 10:09:00,762,"By chance, is that Wine Lake Camp?"
2505290,HeHooksHimself,2014-03-01 20:47:00,725,WLC it is GlenMan. a little more remote for a driveup than your favorite- Cedar Lake.
2505370,boof,2014-03-01 21:13:00,115,"I just got a GoPro for Christmas and am looking forward to getting some fishing and hunting footage with it. I can definitely see a generational difference between the kind of stuff younger guys put together (music, short videos, time lapses) versus what older guys do (longer videos, real audio). Playing around with my camera, I put together a short video of my girlfriend's puppies. This is the kind of stuff I envision my fishing videos will look like.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEEY7tmivxM"
2495274,Bakefish,2014-02-27 08:28:00,1077,"I've been going to Canada for almost 40 years now. Every year I've taken pictures, and in recent years video. Last year we decided to document our trip from start to finish. We brought along a small waterproof digital video camera. We started filming as we were leaving the driveway, and then filmed about 15 seconds or so at every leg of the trip. Pull out of the driveway, 15 seconds. Hit the highway, 15 seconds. Cross state lines 15 seconds, and everything we thought we may want to watch in mid February. Of course we filmed more often after we got into Canada. Once in the boat we left the camera on the console so we could film our fish. We filmed scenery, fish caught, traveling at high speed through rough water...anything we thought might interest us in the offseason. Most people who have seen it think that it's pretty boring. I didn't film this for them, I filmed it for myself. I've watched it 5 times already, and I think I'm ready for another fix. If you decide to do this I have only one tip. Film at 15 to 20 seconds at a time. A two minute battle with a northern is a long time on film. We plan on doing it again this year, with a new and better camera."
2495306,Mike Kansas,2014-02-27 08:32:00,1463,"Sounds like a great way to save your memories. I might try that this year on one of my trips. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
2495338,SinOrSwim,2014-02-27 08:39:00,1528,"We have filmed many trips. Some of the footage taken in the cabin late at night or in teh afternoon, I hope never sees the light of day again. LOL Some very funny stuff"
2495346,MrSimon,2014-02-27 08:44:00,922,"Yup. Same here. We take lots of pics and videos and combine them into a nice 20 or 30 minute documentary of the trip. We just watched last year's video at our planning meeting last week. Great memories. And yup .... definitely have to make two versions of the videos. One is family friendly, and the other one is just plain gross."
2495362,HeHooksHimself,2014-02-27 08:47:00,725,"We had a guy that was into photography go with us in 2012 and he and another guy (Pike Master and Skidwad, if you make it to the end) put this youtube thing up. I go to this frequently in the winter to get the juices flowing! I put this up before, so the regulars may have seen it. Enjoy!http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY9Et...ature=youtu.be"
2495386,Mike Kansas,2014-02-27 08:57:00,1463,"AWESOME Thanks, Mike Kansas"

2495994,tv4fish,2014-02-27 11:42:00,2694,"I would guess that my ""better half"" is a lot like most other guys' better half - she says we ""never take enough pictures"" on our Canadian trip. SOO - Last year, right before we left for our annual trip, I decided to buy another digital camera to take to Canada and take pictures. Now, we already had a nice Canon that we use around home, so I went on eBay in hopes of picking up a cheaper, used camera to have in the boat. I found one that was similar to our existing one, kind of beat up, but cheap, so I bought it. It got delivered about 3 days before we left on our trip, so I just tossed it into the boat.We get up to our cabin at Sioux Lookout and I get the camera out, take a few pix around our camp, etc. and throw it back into the boat. We go out fishing, catch some nice sized walleyes, and I take some pix of my 2 buddies with their fish. I catch a nice one and have one of my buddies take my pix. I just take a few more pix and ""Memory card full"" message pops up. HMMM - it must not have had a very large memory card??No more pix, of course. We get back from the trip and I thought I would share the pix with my buddies, so I download the pix to my computer and get ready to send them out. Of course, I want to preview them first, so I click on each image to check them out. All of a sudden, I'm seeing the nice fish AND then I'm seeing the bottom of the boat, the inside of the boat, the nice blue sky, clouds -- all in a VIDEO!! The darn camera has a slide switch where you can switch to video from a still picture and the switch had gotten moved. I then figured out why I couldn't take too many still pictures!!!!!!"
