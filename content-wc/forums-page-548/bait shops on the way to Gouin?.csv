We use this trick for our fly-in trips:Along the shoreline and away from the hustle & bustle of boats and other shore activity/disturbance, build yourself a ring of rocks under water. It should look exactly like a submerged fire pit in about 8""-16"" of water. When finished, put some uncooked, raw red meat (fresh hamburger or trimmed steak) in the center of your pit and check it every 12-24 hours. The more red the meat (more blood), usually the more effective the trap. As needed, visit your trap and simply reach-in your rock pit for the freshest of leeches!"

I bought leeches last July at a bait shop in Gateneau, Quebec (45.00 LB), they also have nightcrawlers. Gateneau is just across the river from Ottawa. I have the address for the bait shop stashed somewhere with last years trip file. Do an internet search and you should find several. I entered the bait shop address in my Garmin car GPS and it took us to the front door. Seanik"

1175115,5 of Diamonds,2010-03-06 13:17:00,151,Basically all you want to do is build a 'firepit' underwater. Use rocks the size you would use for a firepit. I would say the rocks you would use would be about the size of a square Kleenex box or a softball. You just want to make sure you have an area contained so that your meat doesn't wash away but still have openings for the leeches to get in. It's not an exact science just give it a try and you'll do fine.
