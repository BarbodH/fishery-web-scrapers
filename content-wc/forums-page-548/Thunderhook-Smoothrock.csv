1161204,cowboyd,2010-01-18 15:10:00,33,the water was up pretty high so I guess we made it down oh a quarter to half mile........there are several places that flow in that direction so I am not sure if we are all talking about the same place. This was directly adjacent to the route to lower Waba through the rapid passage and the large stone wall.
1174221,Brandin Iron,2010-03-03 18:45:00,11,"Walleye4life--Went to smoothrock last June. Good fishing and great hosts. The cabins are great. The guide put us on fish everyday. My 10 year old grandson caught a 42"" NP and we all caught some in the 25 to 32' range. We were fishing for walleye most of the time. Good spots are the--Onion patch, the island east of Becky's bay and don't forget to take one day and go to the waterfalls. The guide will help you with all the spots even if he doesn't go with you. We would be going back this year but the younger guys can't be away from work that long. We travel from Nebraska and it is a 2 day drive one way. The plane ride in is great! You made a good Choice."
1158609,walleye4life,2010-01-07 15:49:00,54,"Hey guys. Went to the sports show in Nashville, TN last night to shop around a little bit. I ran into the Thunderhook Fly-Ins / Smoothrock Camp booth and actually ended up booking a trip with them. They have a new owner as of last summer and are really going to be making some big changes (regarding new facilities etc) apparently. Anybody been here before!?"
1160044,walleye4life,2010-01-13 19:13:00,54,Nobody has been to Thunderhook!?
1160232,Guest,2010-01-14 14:23:00,0,"Fished Smoothrock Fly-in last summer. Great people and service. Super cabins and all immenities. Everything was absolutely great but the fishing. Lots of smaller walleyes, no heavies or trophies, though. Weather was rough for part of the week, but no so great fishing."
1160256,walleye4life,2010-01-14 16:18:00,54,"Hey thanks alot! I have never been to Smoothrock myself, but booked with the Thunderhook Outpost portion. Hoping the fishing is great!!"
1160263,Bluff,2010-01-14 16:38:00,152,I have never fished Smoothrock but I do go to Wabakimi every year. I understand the mouth of the river that flows from Lower Wabakimi into Smoothrock can be stacked with fish but I believe it is quite a ways from the outpost where you'll be staying.
1160398,turtle chain,2010-01-15 09:42:00,1398,Is this the same smoothrock lake that pipestone outfitters have a cabin on ??? The smoothrock lake with pipestone is suppose to have really good fishing ?
1160468,cowboyd,2010-01-15 13:29:00,33,they seemed very nice and like bluff I fish Wabakimi lake every year but have thought about giving the other group a chance. Basically same waters with the exception supposed to be lakers on Smooth. Knowing the fishery so well I have to believe there are good fish there seems narrower than Waba but also seems longer. I too would like to hear from anyone who has fished that lake in the last few years.Cowboyd
1160509,Bluff,2010-01-15 15:22:00,152,"I assumed this is the lake where Lower Wabakimi empties into. I have heard a lot of good things about it. I read some article on line it was in one sportswriter's top ten list for trophy pike. Also, abundant lakers. I found a map online in some canoers site about fishing Smoothrock and a trout hole up the western arm. There are also lake maps available from one of the exhibitors at the All Canada show (it's a map company so go to the AC website and follow their link) - kind of a rarity for up there. I have heard several times good fishing where the river comes in from Lower Wab - not possible to navigate to Smmothrock from Lower Wab - I tried."
1160526,cowboyd,2010-01-15 16:35:00,33,lol I tried too but not all that hard after I worked my way back a ways......
1160529,Bluff,2010-01-15 16:40:00,152,cowboyd - did you get down that river? How far?
