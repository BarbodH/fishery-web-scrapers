I had trouble launching my boat on their boat launch ramp so the owner used his truck and launched it. If we still lived in chicago we probably would have gone back. good luck."
1173647,jigmeister,2010-03-02 10:57:00,34,fished out of white pine for two years straight 3 years ago.the meal package they offer is outstanding.boat motor gas all .meals and one day guide.they did lose their camp guide this year(bob elders) some of you guys probably knew him..but jim the owner is guiding. you have to run to yellowgirl to get walleye in quantity(where the guide takes you and is easy to find with gps) northern smallies and some walleye close to home..bonus nice crappie of the docks in evening with minnow and bobber with some bonus northern and walleye thrown in. boats and motors outstanding. id give it a 7.5 out of 10 for fishing and value.not that far of a drive either 12.5 hrs out of chicago burbs..trying some old fishing water this year(lac des milles lacs) will be asking for input on this lake shortly...jig
