Of course, she doesn't really cast it out too much but was getting the hang of it last season. I also let her use my ice fishing rods (32""), but I find they don't work that great in open water. A four foot rod is probably the shortest I would get.I'd probably just go with whatever combo is on sale with the best warranty. Store brands probably are the easiest since you can typically return them without much of a problem. I also find that the top end brands don't really make the best gear at the lower price point. If you want a name brand, I'd consider Abu Garcia, Pflueger or Okuma.I think it might also be good to narrow down a price range and select a bunch of combos for them to choose from. That's also part of the excitement in my opinion. Good luck!"

1173516,Juls,2010-03-02 05:27:00,13414,How old are they?
1173541,JETSTER,2010-03-02 06:24:00,448,"Push-button rod and real combo at Walmart,only around 10-12 bucks!"
1173581,AMPHIB206,2010-03-02 07:44:00,191,"You can't go wrong with the ZEBCO 404; or the Rhino. Just respool it with a bit better quality line and you are good to go. They are inexpensive, they cast for miles, and are very reliable. The reels are about $12. The Zebco 202 sells for $4.99 in you have children that are real young (4-7). Have a great time............"
1173648,eyemike,2010-03-02 11:01:00,233,I started my daughter on an inexpensive spinning combo when she was 4. She took to it like a kitten to milk. You can purchase combos that have a good drag at a real fair price. With the drag systems on spinning reels there is less fear of losing that good fish.
1173650,hoosiercanadian,2010-03-02 11:01:00,104,"It does depend on their ages, but in my experience with my 4 daughters it's the rods that take most of the abuse, rods lying in the boat that might get stepped on, or rod tips that get snapped off, or if one gets hung up, will it snap in half and the reel fall off, so i would go with ugly sticks, they are very durable, can take a licking and are affordable, and will last. As for the reels, just don't buy junk, put some fireline on it , because they are going to get hung up, with fireline you may be able to retrive some tackle, and land some fish, with mono, if the drag isn't set properly it will probably snap, kids tend to want to horse in a fish , if one lucks into something big, you don't want to break their heart buy using junk tackle."" Sorry your minnie mouse rod could'nt handle that 20 pound jack."" I don't care how old they are ,don't buy one of those."
1173663,keek,2010-03-02 11:26:00,1003,"My daughter (5 years) loves her new rod we got last summer. It casts really well, has a pretty good drag and is just plain fun. Plus it's highlighted with pink. Here it is:http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/st..._SearchResultsI also think I am going to put a closed face smaller reel on her ice rod for when she wants something a bit easier to jig with. She went ice fishing for the first time this year and LOVED it. I think the smaller rod was a part of that... or maybe it was the surprise of seeing perch and bass pop thru the little hole in the ice. Either way she thinks fishing is fun and that's what it's all about."
1173675,Knot Tellin,2010-03-02 11:51:00,386,"I would personaly by them a spinning rod combo. I tried the zebco thing with my son and they tend to have trouble with holding the button down on the back cast. Plus the cast like crap and the drag sucks. I hand him a spinning rod and told him to hold the rod and not let it go. Then showed him to put his finger under the line, open the bale, and let go of the line on the foward cast. He made a great cast first try. He was 4 at the time. He turned 6 last summer and can cast a 1/2 oz jig as far as I can cast a 1/4 oz. Not to shaby.You can buy rod combos for $20-$50.http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/te...359&hasJS=true"
1173756,MikeMcC,2010-03-02 15:40:00,72,"I agree with Knot Tellin, get them a spinning rod combo. I never let my kids use a push botton reel. When they were very young I would just give them an ice fishing combo which always worked great."
1173776,celticbass1,2010-03-02 17:03:00,67,I also agree with knot tellin. Go with a Shimano spinning reel with the trigger release and pair it with an ugly stick. Ugly sticks aren't the most sensitive rods in the world but the have a fiberglass tip that withstands some pretty harsh treatment. My kids started casting with spinning reels at about 6-7 years old and caught on very quickly.
