1174741,Larry Mac,2010-03-05 09:38:00,530,"Hi Camp Chef, please add me to your list of prospective fisherman and we will always find a spot for you and your buddy on our trips LOL.Thank you,Larry Mac"

1175292,schandm,2010-03-07 04:07:00,18,"I always take a box similar to the one camp chef describes. I add a small roll of wire, some misc. screws, nails, etc, roll of electrical tape, couple extra reels for spares, screw drivers, small adjustable wrench, channel locks, and a couple spare leatherman tools. We can repair most things in camp from this box. Oops forgot, also some superglue. Hope this helps."

1176630,Tylumps,2010-03-10 15:16:00,73,One item I would recomend is Handi Wipes. The containers just about as big as a 24 oz can of beer work good. They pack nice and are good for quick antiseptic cleaning of the hands. As always be sure to carry out the trash!!! Leave only your footprints.
1173310,adempsey,2010-03-01 13:19:00,963,"That's a great idea actually. Do you have any recommendations for a filter system? [Not to derail your thread, but I suppose it's still useful to know =)]"
1173334,a3dad,2010-03-01 14:26:00,115,"Heres a good page to review. I can vouch for the MSR HyperFlow and the Katadyn Hiker Pro. http://www.trailspace.com/gear/water-treatment/filter/ My buddy and I always pre-prepare dinners at home (chili, gumbo, rice and shrimp, etc) and freeze them before we go. This way we only have to re-heat them once we're up there. Much less fuss and more time on the water."
1173352,camp chef,2010-03-01 15:13:00,915,"My spring trip consists of just me and my long time friend and boat partner.He owns several fine restaurants and appreciates a great meal just as I do.We use to this trip to share some simple but elegant meals.I love to cook and he kibitzes as we enjoy ****tail hour and play Gin while the grill does it's job.Grilled Rack of Lamb,Aged prime New Yorks,properly smoked and grilled chicken.aged cheddar Venison burgers on homemade bread.Grilled cold water lobster tail and even something as simple as Bacon and egg sandwiches really don't take a lot of messing with. Simple,but superb ingredients only taste better with good friends in a Canadian setting."
1173441,prov1900,2010-03-01 19:11:00,544,I think the Brita brand is pretty standard. That is a great idea. Our camp has the standard giardia warnings and one year I was unfortunate enough to get it. I do not recommend.
1173453,a3dad,2010-03-01 19:33:00,115,the Brita filters WILL NOT remove giardia. if you use the Brita filters you should boil the water first. Always a good idea when you can...
1173463,prov1900,2010-03-01 19:54:00,544,"Oops, I didn't know that. I guess I wouldn't bother with that brand then. Thanks a3dad!!!"
1173478,Glenman12,2010-03-01 20:43:00,762,"He owns several fine restaurants and appreciates a great meal just as I do"" If he didnt own some fine restaurants it looks like your grocery bill would be as much as your camp bill.."
1173588,camp chef,2010-03-02 07:58:00,915,"Life is short play hard.......Yes buying at wholesale certainly helps,but my point is that cooking in camp doesn't have to be a chore.We look forward to the whole relaxed process. Other trips throughout the year include more people and a different menu, but the time gathered around the grill at ****tail hour is still something everyone looks forward to."
1173631,keek,2010-03-02 10:09:00,1003,"Add 16 drops of liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water, or 8 drops per 2-liter bottle of water. Stir to mix. Sodium hypochlorite of the concentration of 5.25% to 6% should be the only active ingredient in the bleach. There should not be any added soap or fragrances. A major bleach manufacturer has also added Sodium Hydroxide as an active ingredient, which they state does not pose a health risk for water treatment.Let stand 30 minutes.If it smells of chlorine. You can use it. If it does not smell of chlorine, add 16 more drops of chlorine bleach per gallon of water (or 8 drops per 2-liter bottle of water), let stand 30 minutes, and smell it again. If it smells of chlorine, you can use it. If it does not smell of chlorine, discard it and find another source of water.This is one way of treating BULK water supplies. I have done this for years, using the big blue 6 gallon jugs. Be very exact on your dosage, too much bleach and my stomach starts to feel it. http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/...0089f0870aRCRD"
1173710,eyemike,2010-03-02 13:18:00,233,"For the money that I spend to go to Canada I am going to take my bottled water. Cheap, easy to pack, you can freeze some jugs for ice in the cooler on the way up. I am not going to take the chance of ruining my trip getting sick because of some water. I have been on fly in's, and drive in's and taking water is the way I will go. Mike..."
1173115,stardaddyed,2010-02-28 19:47:00,20,Looking for links to lists (or people lists) about what to bring. I'm going up on a housekeeping plan and have to cross the border.
1173198,Jimmy Jig,2010-03-01 08:03:00,1905,"What sort of list? Fishing equip., food, etc.????"
1173202,camp chef,2010-03-01 08:20:00,915,"Food aside, I have a 5 or 7 gallon rubbermaid container that goes to Canada every trip. I actually had to open it to see what exactly it contained. It is kind of like that kitchen drawer that has all the stuff you only need so often. Playing cards,cribbage board,matches,freezer bags,antacids,fillet knife,sharpening steel,four steak knives,rubber bands,wine opener, can opener,salt ,pepper, a couple EXTRA cans of beans or veggies,a couple EXTRA containers of smoked oysters or snacks of somekind, apen or two,bug spray,scouring pads,extra batteries( D,AA,AAA) extra mini flashlight,compact saw,aluminum foil,tupperware several sizes.

1173203,Mike Kansas,2010-03-01 08:24:00,1463,"I'm in charge every year of the food for our trip of nine guys. I have always done a meal by meal menu and bought the groceries based on that. It is also important to find out what the outfitter supplies, bath towels, toilet paper, dishsoap,ice,paper towels and in other non food items that you might need. I tell my group that they are responsible for their own beverages like pop or booze. That way they can't complain to me about not having their favorite beverage. I do bring all the botteled water and water for cooking. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

1173240,tackleman,2010-03-01 10:03:00,444,"holy smokes some of you guys bring a lot of stuff.I see that some bring everything but the kitchen sink. I would suggest that you could make a grocery list and pick that stuff up closer to where you are fishing / staying.your dollar is worth a little more than ours so the prices should be comparable to home and it's a lot less to pack.When i go fishing with my buddies in the spring, we split the duties, one guy gets the booze, one the food , another the minnows and worms. The camp usually has all the pots and pans and bedding, but i do take a sleeping bag. it makes it a little less stressful if you split the jobs."
1173242,Larry Mac,2010-03-01 10:04:00,530,"Hi Stardaddyed, below is a link to a housekeeping packing list from the All Canada Show info page. Also go to the www.wildernessnorth.com website, there are some excellent videos on preparing for a Canada wilderness trip. Hope this helps.

1173284,plumberjoe,2010-03-01 12:13:00,54,A couple things I didnt see on the lists that are on ours are duct tape and we spent the money on a water filtration(one that removes everything) pitcher so we dont have to bring all the bottled water.
