1174634,Nimstug,2010-03-04 22:54:00,2605,"Jeff,Yes, it is enough boat. Most camp boats are basic 16' tillers with say a 25 hp motor. As with any fishing trip, know the weather forecast for the day, keep an eye on the sky, have a map and compass and always have an idea where you are in relation to camp. Never cut across a point. Always swing wide around a point. GPS's are great but they can poop out or fall in. NimstugWhen I grow up I want to be a little boy."
