1168682,tpr39,2010-02-13 16:09:00,13,I've not fished Baie du Nord. As far as the western gouin is concerned (and my fishing has mostly been late may/early june) the fishing is good pretty much everywhere. We concentrate on walleye. Fishing at th istime of year water temperture is the key. If surface temps. move through the upper 50s to near 60 we will catch more fish. The other key is moving water. If you find a current and structure you're pretty much guaranteed to catch fish.
1168828,a3dad,2010-02-14 09:57:00,115,"tpr39, I use Air Tamarac and we'll be up at Plamodon Bay again this year. I've been to most of their camps but I like this bay a lot. Know of any feeder streams in this area? thanks, Kevin"
1169052,McQ,2010-02-15 07:33:00,615,I'm up at Nemio which is on the river feeding into Baie du Nord for the next few weeks as the owners do a show in Pittsburg. Snow levels are really low this year which may complicate early season fishing - reduced runoff! To the best of my knowledge all feeder waters are closed as per the ministries rules - I've always found the fishing to be excellent at the first deeper pool down from the spawning area. Big hens are around but it takes covering water to get into them. Bottom bouncing harnesses works for me and when I get bit multiple times in an area the jig rod comes out and I slow right down working breaks and edges. McQ
1169442,a3dad,2010-02-16 10:24:00,115,"McQ, You're bumming me out about the projected water levels. I mainly pike fishing when I'm up on the Gouin and like to fish the back bays when they're flooded. In 2006 we hit it just right, end of May and the water level was high. We caught some huge pike back in the bushes! I'm hoping for the same this year. I changed my trip to early June this year so that I can fish the spawning areas. Hoping they'll still be there... Thanks, Kevin"
1169719,McQ,2010-02-17 08:05:00,615,"Kevin, you should hit the fall fish spawn around that time - sand bars and beaches will produce monsters. Had one on last year that bit, ran 100' to the side - thumbed the spool to try and slow it down a little and the lure clip broke. Bummer, but followed up over the next hour with a 40 and a 42. I'm hoping that tank will still be in the same bay. It snowed 6"" overnight and the forecast calls for more of the same for two weeks. A couple of more feet will make a world of difference - before I return to civilization I'll report the conditions. McQ"
1170395,ed08walleye,2010-02-19 17:53:00,27,McQThanks for the weather update. I will be going with Air Melancon and am curious about what the snow levels are/will be as spring approaches.Keep us posted.Thanks
1170410,Andre (wallyandre),2010-02-19 18:49:00,2274,If you want to follow the official flow:http://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/index_en.asp
1171498,a3dad,2010-02-23 19:23:00,115,"Andre, I've been looking for something like this site. Thanks. Unfortunately, my french is not that good and I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at. Is there a page that shows the current water levels at the Barrage Gouin? thanks, Kevin"
1173518,McQ,2010-03-02 05:29:00,615,"Back home after my 2 1/2 week stint at Nemio - there was a minimum snow fall over the period of at least 3' which speaks well for the spring runoff - long range forecast calls for more. On the 50 Km ride out on the snowmobile you could easily see that the accumulation along the side of the trail was from 5' - 7' the result of snowfall & drifting. Opening should be excellent - the draw down is normal for the period, so all who will be going in for the first weekend should enjoy a fruitful trip. See ya there!!!! McQ"
1173775,a3dad,2010-03-02 16:52:00,115,you just made my day McQ! Thanks!!!
1157385,a3dad,2010-01-02 11:11:00,115,Hi Everyone. Great Site. Been reading many of the Canada threads over the last few days. Great information exchange - thanks everyone! I've been fishing the Gouin since 2000 (5 trips) and have been to many of the bays on the western side. User Alces reported in a 2005 thread that 31 spawning areas will be closed through May 31. I have encountered one of these areas in Sarana Bay. I was wondering if there is any official list of these closed areas? I will be be up there the last week of May 2010 in the Plamondon Bay/Lac du Male area. Thanks for any information you can provide. Likewise I'm more than happy to share any of my personal information about the Gouin and will be lerking around the forums. Happy New Year! Kevin (a3dad)

1157470,a3dad,2010-01-02 19:09:00,115,Thanks Andre!
1157605,retire55,2010-01-03 12:41:00,1029,a3dad: A convenient method to look at these restricted fishing areas is via Google Earth. Here's an image depicting the west bank and east bank markers for the beginning of the restricted fishing area in Baie Saraana.http://www.myfishingpictures.com/dat...h_Image3_2.jpg
1157612,a3dad,2010-01-03 13:23:00,115,"retire55, thanks - I've been doing just that all morning now that I have the coordinates. Your pic shows the Sarana River. Air Tamarac has a cabin right in that location. Stayed there two times. Kevin"
1158050,a3dad,2010-01-05 10:11:00,115,"Rich, Here is a picture of the entire Matawa bay showing the location of the cabins and where the closure is."
1158093,Andre (wallyandre),2010-01-05 15:45:00,2274,The west part of the Gouin is probably the best fishing area.
1168362,mikegreen257,2010-02-12 09:30:00,1,"I will be going to Gouin Reservoir on the first week of june. On a spring black bear hunt also fishing as well. I will be with Oasis Du Gouin outfitters. Just wanted to know if you had any experience with this outfitter or the area. also, are the black flies and the drive in as bad as I'm hearing; to get to some of these outfitters? I am new to this forum, trying to catch the hang of it. It would be nice if someone could direct me in the right direction with some information.Thanks"
1168488,tpr39,2010-02-12 20:00:00,13,"It is my understanding that the spawning areas will be open 5/29 this year (http://www.afcgouin.ca/) this is atleast a week or more earlier than in the last few years. We have been fishing the Gouin for the last 20+ years over Memorial week. Would be happy to share some thoughts. a3dad, who is your outfitter and where is your camp, I'm pretty familiar with the western part of the gouin,"
1168583,retire55,2010-02-13 09:11:00,1029,"Thanks for the offer TPR39. In that regard, can you please comment on potential walleye fishing in Baie du Nord. Secondly, what western Gouin locations provide the optimum walleye experience, in your opinion? Thanks in advance."
