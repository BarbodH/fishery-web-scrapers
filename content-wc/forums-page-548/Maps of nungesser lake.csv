1165349,camp chef,2010-02-02 08:32:00,915,If you like I would be happy to look at a map with you over the phone. We were there for a week in Sept.07
1165555,Angler Donny,2010-02-02 20:21:00,11,Kevin does have the best map for the lake and even if you are not staying with him I am sure he will mark the spots for you. Generely its dead bait fishing with 9 inch sucker minnows or bigger for Northerns with either a quick strike rig or a 1 ounce essox cobra jig and stinger for the bottom. For the top us a big round Bobber with the same large Sucker minnow and a stinger. Walleyes will be 3/8ths jigs tipped with a minniw.Best of Luck fishing there. You will have fun.
1165696,kgeary,2010-02-03 11:03:00,88,"Dead bait fishing is one of many very effective methods. There are different methods and locations depending on anglers preferences and time of year. Gather as much info as you can. Then ignore it all and do what I recommend. JUST KIDDING - JUST KIDDING. Rule number one is go where the fish are, so you've already started on a successful adventure."
1166000,IRISHATTACK,2010-02-04 07:51:00,44,That is exactly what I plan on doing everyday. I have been told to ask the owner because he know the lake the best.........
1174325,Brandin Iron,2010-03-04 06:58:00,11,"IRISHATTACK, I fished AK the summer of 08 and had great fishing. Kevin will supply you with a map and he will mark all the spots. We never missed at his spots. I went to a All Canada show in Omaha,Ne. a few weeks ago and ordered a map from Canada Map Sales for $14.95. It is waterproof and all the contour lines are marked. When you look at the map and look at what AK tells you it really comes together about location. Their website--canadamapsales.com----Phone--1-877-627-7226. We liked what we saw so much we ordered one for each boat. Salted frozen minnows on a charteruse jig works great. Brandin Iron over an out."
1175088,kgeary,2010-03-06 10:14:00,88,The maps I give to guests have colored contour lines to make it easier to see the depths. I'll draw out the details of each spot and explain how to fish it when you arrive. thanks kg
