If your planning to go to Mattagami one, plan early and try to get a place to stay if you can, that maybe a challenge unless you have a trailer or like to camp out. Geraldton is a great event, 8 hours for me but worth the drive for sure. Kapuskasing is good if you like river fishing. Timmins is also a good event, well run, my only complaint about that one is how they weigh their fish, but still a good event, fishing can be tough even at the best of times. One event closer to you, a one day event, some of the guys fromt he Soo have been attending the last few years and you can ask them if you bump into them in your town, is the Marble Eyes in Espanola.www.marbleeyes.ca 250 dollars entry per team, over 30,000 in cash and prizes, 3 big fish prizes, on the Spanish River. I am biased of course, i run it, were attracting good quality fishing teams from all over Ontario, we only allow 75 to 80 teams and were close to 60% full now. Hope this helps."
