Fished in late may and 2nd wk of June. Very shallow,rocky,tough on the motor. Hard to give areas to go seeing that always changes. There is a small gap between 2 bodies of waters to the right of camp that always produced.The river also was good. Would definately go back anytime,not sure who runs Hebner now. Camp was always very wet and a mess,but I know Twinlakes did alot of work to fix the cabin and the wet problem."
