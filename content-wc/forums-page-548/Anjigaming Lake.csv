1175894,Cassiu2,2010-03-08 20:29:00,1,We are flying in this May - How did it go? Hopefully the fishing was good. Would be interested in what baits worked well etc.

1176054,Ruddiger,2010-03-09 08:52:00,649,"Howdy, I fished this lake back in 1994, 95 and 96. At the time the lakes were owned by Hugh Kuttner of Pellow’s Cottages in Chapleau. Fishing was good for numbers of smaller pike and walleye, although there were not a lot of large fish. The biggest we ever caught was around 38 inches and we could usually average one of those per week. Most of the fish were significantly smaller. These are small lakes that you can motor across quickly, even with 2 HP motors. I still have some very good memories of the camp as it was my first true fly-in and was worth the reasonable price of admission for a struggling teacher from Ohio. In looking at the website today, I laughed out loud when they described their ""luxurious cabin, second to no one."" When I was there back in the day the cabin was literally an un-insulated, and mosquito infested, tool shed with 2x4 frames for bunk beds and stained 4 inch foam mattresses. Does anyone actually have a picture of the cabin today? The reason I ask is that we still joke about the facilities to this day and, if I had purchased the camp and replaced the old tool shed with a “luxurious cabin"" I would certainly have pictures of it available on my “award winning website.” Having been all over Canada since then, and having been there in the past under previous ownership, I would say that the lack of photographic evidence of their claims is something I would be concerned about. Obviously 15 years is a long time and a lot could have changed, but that website really oversells the fishing and the wilderness experience if things are anything like they were then. Hopefully I’m totally wrong and things are as good as advertised. Part of me would really like to go back for nostalgia purposes, however, I would like to see what the place looks like now. When I was there the last time (1996) you could see and hear the logging roads and trucks that were encroaching on the camps location. Again, things may be much better now than they were then, however, that is usually not the case without extensive regulations and access changes. Feel free to PM me if you want specific details on the fishing. Take care, Ruddiger"
