1175808,Hawker,2010-03-08 16:49:00,3967,"Got an email from lodge owner where we go on LOTW asking for my help. They know when I come up I bring my Lowrance unit which ""was"" an LCX and that I use a Navionics map chip. The one I have is a couple three years old and is the Navionics Hot Maps Premium Canada, SD/PREM-C2, Apr2006. I'm pretty sure there is a newer updated Navionics Map card for LOTW, but have no idea which one it is. The lodge owners have a customer coming in from Europe this Spring and has a Lowrance X-19 Sonar/GPS unit he will be bringing and needing to know what map chip to order.I said all that to say this, can anyone of ya'll help me in figuring out which map chip will work the best for the unit he has???Appreciate any help or advice!!Thanks!!!"
