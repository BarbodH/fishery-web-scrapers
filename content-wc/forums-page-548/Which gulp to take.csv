1174026,camp chef,2010-03-03 10:28:00,915,We used 3 inch minnow grubs in yellow and orange and did quite well. I would use even larger ones if available
1174029,tilldawg,2010-03-03 10:33:00,55,"I like those minnow baits as well (3-4""). But I have had best luck with the black and white or smelt. I also like the curly tail grubs they have.We did a test a couple of times to see if live minnows did better than Gulp. On all 3 occasions the Gulp outperformed live bait by a big margin. I fish alot of saltwater flats for redfish and seatrout and the Gulp does better than shrimp and other live baits there as well."
1174044,bassface44,2010-03-03 11:08:00,96,"I have taken Gulp along for the last several years and seem to keep going back to the 3"" minnows. We have tried the 3"" and 5"" leeches and done OK and also the 4"" minnows but the 3"" minnow in smelt has been the better choice for us. Lakes fished were in Quebec and LOTW"
1174373,stumcfar,2010-03-04 09:02:00,451,"I can say I have never seen ""Gulp"" come close to outfishing live bait. If it works for some of you, great, for me, I'm not wasting anymore money on the stuff. I would bring frozen shiners or something salted before I will spend money on it."
1174391,twobearlake,2010-03-04 09:39:00,379,"I would agree that the 3"" minnow baits are my go-to gulp bait. The Black Shad or Smelt seem to work the best. Gulp works great for bass. I would rank Gulp ""average"" for walleye.The minnows have outfished the leeches by a large margin for me. I also catch more fish with the 3"" vs 4"", but if I am looking for better quality fish (rather than numbers) I go with the 4"". I usually fish the 3"" as I search for active fish and then move to 4"" when I am on them. My experience is that Gulp will outfish live bait when the fish are really, really on (you know, when almost anything will work). At those times I like the Gulp because you can catch numerous fish without rebaiting. When the fish are more negative I think that live bait clearly outfishes the Gulp.One thing to remember with the Gulp is that you have to use the lightest weight possible so that you can really impart more natural looking action to the bait. I think that sometimes people struggle with Gulp because they are using heavy jigs and are not providing the action that the bait needs.TB"
1174405,tilldawg,2010-03-04 10:05:00,55,"You are correct about the weight of the jig. Once I figured out how to fish Gulp, I never went back to live bait. You have impart action with any artificial. Same goes with curly tails."
