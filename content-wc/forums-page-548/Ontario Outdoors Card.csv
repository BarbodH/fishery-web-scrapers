1176237,chevtow,2010-03-09 17:07:00,691,Our cards went directly from the mail to the box holding our passports so we do not forget them.
1176289,jackpot41,2010-03-09 18:59:00,53,"OK.............. a really really stupid question.........what purpose does ""the card"" serve???? I got one in the mail last fall from ontario........have no clue what it's used for...........thanks......."
1176376,Whopper,2010-03-10 05:22:00,340,If I'm not mistaken it was generated so you wouldn't have to give anymore personal information when applying for a license and you would be able to renew your license online with just the card number. I still don't see where non residents can renew online yet
1176383,Glenman12,2010-03-10 05:41:00,762,"I still don't see where non residents can renew online yet "" You cant yet...only residents can...I called the MNR and they said non residents wont be able to apply online until 2011.."
1176511,Whopper,2010-03-10 10:15:00,340,In 2009 they said it would be available 2010 Doesn't matter I'm not going to hold me breath

1173892,El_Bombero,2010-03-03 01:17:00,18,"How long did it take for you to get your card? I haven't applied yet...we are going up the last week in May...wondering if I should try to get it online now, or just wait and do it all at once when we get up there?"
1173915,Golden Eagle,2010-03-03 06:05:00,2642,May as well get it when you buy your new license. My post was to remind fishermen to take their card with them next time they head to Canada. Wouldn't do much good sitting on my desk at home.
1173935,Whopper,2010-03-03 06:57:00,340,"Mine was put in my wallet the day I got it, just hope I get to use it at some point this season. Good reminder though"
