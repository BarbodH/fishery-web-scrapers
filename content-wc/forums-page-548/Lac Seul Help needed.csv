1174336,cspierings,2010-03-04 07:38:00,230,In the years I have been going to Lac Seul I have always only fished as far east as Steamboat bay. We stay up toward Goose Island. This year I am taking the whole family to LS on the weekend of the 4th. To keep things interesting for the ladies I want to do some exploring. We are going to Pakwash at least one day on LS I would like to try heading further east. I would like to try to get to Mackenzie Bay and in reviewing the maps I wonder about how safe it is through the shanty narrows (east and west). Can anyone shed some light on the safest route? If I am going that far I was thinking maybe about trying to head down to the South Inlet and see if we could find the falls down there. Any tips on getting there from Steamboat would be appreciated. Thanks
1174355,teddi,2010-03-04 08:22:00,349,follow the markers in shanty and you will have no problem. getting to south inlet can be a little tricky [bay of islands]. get a good map and maybe a gps. pm me for more info.
1174367,JDP,2010-03-04 08:59:00,1457,"Cspierings do you have a GPS that will take a Navionics chip?If so, Navionics has a chip that has Lac Seul.(Roughly equivalent to many of the printed maps interms of countours, hazards,etc.)But a Navionics chip will really help you know exactly where you are if you get ""turned around"".As far as Shanty Narrows being safe...houseboats travel through Shanty Narrows on their way down the Lac Seul.There are a ton of new spots/areas for you to fish. I encourage you to follow through on your urge to explore!"
1174384,cspierings,2010-03-04 09:30:00,230,I do have the Navionics chip for Canada so finding my way there and back isn't an issue once I am sure the water I travel doesn't have any major obstructions. In looking at the paper map the area between east and west shanty narrows looks like it gets a touch shallow.
1174443,Guest,2010-03-04 12:05:00,0,with your chip you should be fine. The chip should include a line that is recommended for your to travel on your way from the Goose Island area all the way to McKenzie Bay. McKenzie can be excellent fishing. Be careful though as there are a lot of spots that can end your trip in a quick hurry.

Been going to Lac Seul for thirty years now and the 4th is one of my favorite trips !! Would be more than happy to put you on fish. Know the area you want to go very well!! Hope to hear from you."
1174486,cspierings,2010-03-04 14:21:00,230,my email is [email protected] Would appreciate any help. Thanks a lot
1174495,WalleyeWally28,2010-03-04 14:51:00,298,My wife and I will also be staying in the Goose Bay area starting on July 3rd. We have fished LS for the past 13 years and have spent a lot of time in McKenzie and areas south. What camp are you staying at?
1174598,brn2fsh,2010-03-04 19:33:00,49,"If you stay at Goose bay, I'd see if Stan still guides for them. He took us to Ghost narrows about 10 years ago. we used a handheld gps with no maps and found our way back without too much trouble. Now I have a chip for the gps and it is really so much better. He'll also hit other spots on the way and you can mark those as well. Lots of nice fish down that way, have fun!!"
