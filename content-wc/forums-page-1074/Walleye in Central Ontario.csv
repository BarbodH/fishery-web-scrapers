Since the our bass season does not open until the end of June I need to occupy my Time with Walleye Fishing. Lakes I may fish are Glouchester Pool, and Lake Dalrymple. Any tips on fishing for walleye on these lakes specifically would be gladly appreciated, or just any tips concentrating on fishing in a Canadian Shield Lake with lots of steep drop offs, shoals as well as some fertile flats. I am planning on fishing these lakes aroung the middle of May until the end of June. Any tips would be appreciated."

Primarily, I catch wallies trolling spinners in front of the resort (on the east side of the lake), and also along the southern part of Avery point (especially good in the bay at the end of Avery point. Try throwing some stick baits like Husky jerks back in the corner too. Troll nice an slow with lindy rigs, and charteuse spinners tipped with worms. Another trick I find helpful, is thowing smaller rapalas in the narrows by the boat ramp. Throw your lure right in the prop wash of boats as they head out into the lake. I've caught several wallies like that waiting for my buddies to rig up before we head out early in the morning."
