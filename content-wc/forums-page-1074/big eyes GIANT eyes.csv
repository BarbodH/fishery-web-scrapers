Each June I load up the gear and drive to this vast precambian shield lake.We catch plenty of ""mickey mouse"" walleyes (great eating) however, this year I would like to hook into a sow whose protruding gut droops over its beltbuckle.This is not en easy task but these fish shouldnt be as elusive as in the summer.I would greatly appreciate any tips on conditions, depth of water, what to use, and what time to fish to hook into a big one.Thanks-Matt"

In that area, actually any area that far north (54-55'lat), the walleye don't get big because of the shorter growing season/cooler water temps. I was told that a 17""-19"" walleye out of those lakes (LaRonge area) is a good sized fish. There are the odd 5 - 7 pound fish caught, but they are few and far between. The locals I've talked to where I fish also say the same thing - who knows - maybe the BIG northers ate'em all!I'm up there the first week of June - Can't wait!!!"
