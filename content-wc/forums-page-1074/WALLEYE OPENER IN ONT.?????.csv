507727,Guest,2000-04-28 11:08:00,0,when does walleye open in Ontario- I have heard several different dates. THANKS Terry/IOWA
507728,Rick,2000-04-28 12:29:00,226,"You have heard several dates because it all depends on where you are going. For many parts of Ontario, you can fish for ""eyes"" all year round. It's best to check the Recreational Fishing Guide at the address below for the area you are going too.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/pubmenu.html"
507729,Guest,2000-05-02 10:43:00,0,When fishing in Ontario make sure you read the fine print in the regs as well. A lot of the lakes have other regulations tacked onto them. Go into the area where you are fishing in the regs and see if there are any additional regs attached. It's quite common to have a delayed opener and size restrictions or areas of the lake closed to fishing. Your best bet is to use a fishing resort. Good fishing: Frank

In some areas It is different but this is the OFFICIAL OPENNER FOR WALLEYE."
507731,Guest,2000-05-09 10:15:00,0,"You've gotta check the regs.For instance, down Windsor way, you can fish for Walleye all year round in the Detroit River/Lake St. Clair waters."
507733,Guest,2000-05-09 13:18:00,0,"I am also a resident of Ontario out of Thunder Bay. Walleye opens up here always on the third saturdy of May in the Northwest area of the province. However many lakes open later as they have add on regs. Some have size restrictions and others are no fishing at all. The majority of lakes don't have signs posted in this area. It is up to the fisherman to know the regs and which lake he is actually on. Ontario is a huge place with thousands of different regs and lakes. There is no excuse for not having a copy as it is easy to download. As the saying says ""If you fail to plan, you plan to fail."" Good fishing: Frank"
