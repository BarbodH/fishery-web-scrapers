507803,Guest,2000-05-08 13:15:00,0,"I will be going to the Northeast section of Lac Seul during the third week of May. Any tips on how to fish the area around Bear Narrows and Chamberlain Narrows, also Scaler. What to look for this time of year, transition, patterns, etc. Will the fish be in the bays this time of year? I normally use jig and plastics, sometimes with minnows, but would crawlers and leeches work this time of year. What should I look for and where to get into good walleye fishing. Rocky points, sands,etc. Any help would really be appreciated.. Thanks in advance."
