507794,mkebenn,2000-05-08 04:45:00,59,"I have heard of ""ear muffs"" that you attatch to your outboard to allow you to hook a garden hose to so you can run motor for testing, etc. Where would I find such a thing and where to put it on motor? I have a '67 60hp Johnson. any help welcomeMike in E.A."
507795,Iowa Eye,2000-05-08 05:22:00,104,"MikeYou can get these at marine dealers and most major outdoor stores, Cabelas, Gnader Mountain, Bass Pro Shops etc.Make sure they completly cover the water intake on your motor and that you see water coming out the discharge hole when you run the motor."
507796,Guest,2000-05-08 10:22:00,0,I use a saw horse as a support for the outboard and use a large garbage can with a hose in it for the water. I've never had a problem. The nice thing about this setup is that I didn't have to buy anything. Good fishing: Frank
507797,RANGER,2000-05-08 10:48:00,4341,"Iowaeye is right. Any one of those places have them and KMart does too. I prefer the metal bracketed shafts to the plastic ones.As to where to place them - on your motor shaft, just above your cavitation plate (above your prop) you'll find 3, 4, 5 holes in the shaft. The holes will be matched on the opposite side of the shaft. This is your water intake porting. The ""earmuffs"" fit over these holes, on BOTH sides, and the muffs kind of clamp the shaft. Turn the water on enough to have water pouring out of the muffs but not so strong as to move the muffs or blow them off the shaft. After starting your motor make sure you have water coming out of the ""tell-tail"" of the motor (discharge vent). You can run a motor for a long time with this setup.RANGER"
