Would like some tips on the best presentations to use and where to fish, patterns, etc. Without have a map of depth curves it is hard to find the flats and breaks. Would the coves or bays be considered as this type pattern? Any help would be appreciated. Also, where would be the best area to snatch that trophy. Thanks...eyesnatcher"

There are also lots of prominent points with shallow weed beds next to nice drop offs in the main lake within one mile of Camberlin Narrows. Troll spinners with minnows; or, long line naked hooks with leeches along the same weed lines. If the fish have moved deeper go with jigs. Make sure you spend a day or two crankin. There are some nice northerns to be had out in that area. Cranks will also produce some good sized W's. Stop by Ojibway Outfitters and Baits in Souix Lookout for maps."
