(South of Savant) We are staying on the south end of the lake and are looking for walleyes. Several folks shot me some good info last winter and I was wondering if anyone else might be out there that would be willing to help us out. Does anyone staying on the south end make the run to the north end? Cobb bay, etc.?Thanks,Pooch"
