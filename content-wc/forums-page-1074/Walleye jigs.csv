507710,Guest,2000-04-26 08:51:00,0,Don't think you want to target smallies in May.Most of the zones don't open til at least June 24th and some June 30th.FYIDavid aka superdad
507711,Fred_G,2000-04-27 09:23:00,908,We anil all we want every year with pink 3/8 oz. jigs and a white twister tail. Might also use 1/4 oz. in shallower situations. LOL
507712,Guest,2000-04-30 19:42:00,0,"Size and style of jigs depend on where you are going, what is working and how you like to fish. Ask your resort what everybody else uses at that time of the year. They want you to catch fish.I personally like lighter jigs. I am going in mid June to Vermillion Bay. I am taking over 600 new jigs with me this year. I will have 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 and 3/8. I use the plain round heads the majority of time since they are cheap, I don't feel bad if I leave it on a snag. A two tone paint job of orange and chartuese is my favorite, but I also have orange, chartuese, yellow, red, white and blue."

We make our own use a sled jig doesn't snag as easy. If weather is real warm we have had good luck with red & white LITTLE JOE with nightcrawlers. Hope this helps."
