507771,Guest,2000-05-03 09:30:00,0,My life long friend Ronn and I went to the Minaki area last year in June. That was my first time to the area but he has going to the Winnipeg river north of Kenora for over 20 years. Always had good success.We are planning again for this year in mid June. Weather can be hit or miss but if it's good it's really good. Near perfection. Last year we tent camped. It can get a bit chilly. The only problem we had with bugs were the caterpillars.

Always have to look around for a day or two. Then wow! Bugs were only a minor issue one year out of 15. Weather can be beautiful or somewhat chilly some years, depending on what week your there. It is god's country."
