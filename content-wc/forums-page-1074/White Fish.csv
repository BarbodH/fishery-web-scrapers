507761,Guest,2000-05-02 10:36:00,0,I have been spending a week at a lodge on Wobatonguishi lake which has Walleye and Pike and White fish but I have yet to catch a White fish. Can anyone out there give me some tips on catching these tasty critters. The lake has a deep basin (175ft)and we mark fish down deep but no luck when we try to tempt them.SJB.

But in all the times I've been out there fishing, I caught one lonely whitefish. And man o man....let me tell you...they sure do fight.Waxworms on small floats and light line work best I hear.Sit motionless and wait for the float to just move. Then set the hook. Long rods work best.I bought an 11 ft rod and have yet to catch one on it. (I caught my lonely whitefish trolling a jig and minnow. go figure LOLOL)Hey...maybe you should take someones word who does catch these suckers. I got a pailfull of knowledge....but can't say much for experience!Have fun anyways :)"

We were at Eagle Lake, Eagle River Ontario and marked tons of white fish ( according to our host they were white fish) never caught one. Thanks, good fishing, God bless. ps. We were there last year not this."
