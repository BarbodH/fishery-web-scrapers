Next size up seats 15 and cost $1100. Then you have to consider the gas mileage. The larger van get's about half the mini van. I know the pro's will have the answer. Do we cram in and rough it for 10 hours each way, or bite the bullet and spend almost twice as much. We've also considered 2 small cars, but that still adds up when you consider the gas for both vehicles. What's the best thing to do?"

I never did rent anything, I was just trying to see whether we could take one van vs two of our own vehicles, but I couldn't figure a way to get the numbers to work."
575665,Guest,2008-07-01 08:04:00,0,"Thanks for your suggestions guys. I was able to find a 12 passenger van at $900, so I booked it this morning. Better than $1100 I guess. Thanks again for your help."
575670,Guest,2008-07-01 11:34:00,0,"I have done it both ways for about ten years now. Heres some things to be careful of, some rental companies do not readily state that rentals leaving the u.s are not able to get the unlimited mileage deals. Most rentals in canada say unlimited ""within"" the province you rented it. Check with you insurance carrier to see if you are covered in canada. Also,I'm not sure of the 12 person van, but one time a rental company wanted the person driving to have a cdl license!!! that was a 15 person van though but pays to check. Ive found it much cheaper to rent off airport and there are some that will pick you up and take you to the rental office and you come back and pick everyone up then, as much as 40% depending on where etc. You can usually pay a small fee to drop the van off at the airport as it is usually more convenient when leaving. weve had better luck and more fun in one large van but that was just us. hope it helps and hope the fish are biting."

Aaron- just the last two years they have really been harping on this subject. I figure they know most guys are driving from winnipeg to northwest ontario. They were actually asking for the lakes or areas we were going to fish and although i got away with it if anything would have happened i suppose i would have been held to the mileage allotted. First few years no questions but even their websites now state this. by the way saw your posts earlier on your fishing year...congrats. hope your hand has healed! Ha we too had a really good year. our first out of minaki and it took a few hours to relate pictures of maps and islands in my head to reality but once i did we took right off. I did figure out that the most important thing isnt food,vans,cabins, etc but the darn boat!! we rented a decent boat and the guy really wentout of his way for us to let us use a trolling motor, front mounted, but the battery died while on the lake one night and then it used 10 gallons of gas in a half days fishing...ouch.. you may have seen me i was the one who walked from northstar landing all the way back to abby road cause we ran out of gas..!! all makes for good laughter later. see ya"
