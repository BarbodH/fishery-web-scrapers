We were wondering if fishing after dark is even worth a shot given the stained nature of the lakes up there. I am aware of the dangers of boating at night up there and that has already been taken into account. If anyone has information or experience with fishing after dark though I would like to hear it. We will have a full moon while we are there so any clear night will have the benefit of moonlight. Does this help the night bite? Is it a timing thing like go out after 2AM, or is it a moon over the horizon thing? All information is welcome. Thanks guys. Tight lines."
575521,Guest,2008-06-27 08:26:00,0,I fish after dark every year when I'm up there for bass. topwater baits have worked really well for me. I don't know that it's any more productive than daytime but it is productive.
575524,Guest,2008-06-27 09:45:00,0,"I fish some at night. I would do more if the bugs weren't so bad. I only night fish for walleye, and I'm sure it applies to all species that when the fish move into the shallows that stealth is the key to not spooking the fish into deeper water. When the fish are that shallow top water bait is the way to go, and I even up size the lure/bait to give more of a target, and generaly I night fish to target lager fish. If your trolling I find lots of line or side planners to get the lure away from the boat really has helped. Though planner boards I find to be more key as I don't really like running the boat over really shallow water"
575545,bassface44,2008-06-27 17:14:00,96,"Okay. So where we are in Quebec the water is very tannic, there are no bass and we will be aided by a full moon the day we arrive. There are several spots not too far from camp where deeper water that holds fish during the day abuts shoreline sand flats and rocky outcrops. Are these areas worth fishing at night this far north where the bass don't live and the water is that stained? Also, if we were to go out at night should we target a particular time or target when the moon is straight overhead or does it matter? Thanks for all the help."
575550,Guest,2008-06-27 21:17:00,0,"Interesting question - we have fished a walleye only lake in quebec with the stained water as you described for many years- best fishing has been 10 am to 4/6 pm pretty constant depending on the wind. after 6 pm fishing really drops off to very poor even on days when we really caught alot of fish i would concider us better than average fisherman and very versitle. we fish walleye here in PA as well as the lake ontario, and do very well after dark here. we have fished at night in quebec many times with very poor results- next to none- trolling- casting didnt matter and always wondered why - several guesses why - as you suggest the dark water makes it very hard for the fish to see the prey- since they have so little pressure there is know reason to feed at night, they can feed all day- wind patterned feed and most nights wind is not so constant- in dark water lakes fish are primary feeding by sight and easier to see in the daylight and see our lures also-- overall we no longer even try to fish at night- we fish till early eve, eat dinner and relax till bed and start all over next day- we have also tried the very early 5 am till 8 with almost the same results- we dont get up early either- dont really know why but thats why they call it fishing hope this helps - i feel as long as im catching fish i dont care what time it is good luck and let us know how you do wg"

You need to go fast enough so you can feel the vibration of the lure. It gets really eerie when there's no moon.

575627,bassface44,2008-06-30 11:11:00,96,"Thanks for the input guys! We have had similar results to you WG. We have sent night missions out from time to time with little luck up there but I could not think of a time where we were up there during a full moon. We do catch fish early AM on occasion (6-8AM) but like WG, we do most of our catching between 9AM-6PM. We have taken some really nice fish over the past few years up there close to dark, one 30"" and one 28"". These fish were both caught under almost pitch black conditions. This is all probably in my head because our trip is coming up so soon. If we give it a shot I'll post the results."
575644,Guest,2008-06-30 15:50:00,0,"I've night fished for yrs in Canada. The best advice I can give is: keep it simple. 1 rod per person, and maybe a spare if needed, and simply troll w/ a large Rapala like bait. I'd forget about casting, or using boards, etc. One tangle and you're 57 min. getting it untangled, etc. An organized boat is key too. keep the floor clean from tackle and other things, and make sure the net is always accesible and not hung up. Try reeling in a 10 lb eye or a large pike in a nighttime chop while stepping on something misplaced on the floor of the boat, falling over, etc. Not pretty. Obviously a really good flashlight is a must. And don't forget the life jackets. Nighttime fishing can be a blast. But you have to accept there always seems to be a narrow window of opportunity (usually about 45 min in my experience) where the fish are active. The key is finding that time/window, and keeoing it simple to maximize your opportunities. And consider any nice fish you get as a bonus to the wonderful nighttime scenery( a full moon, or the occasional Northern Lights.....)"
575711,bassface44,2008-07-02 15:07:00,96,Thanks for the advice on keeping it simple after dark. I bet it makes a huge difference and probably saves a few rods over the long term. Thanks again for all the advice.
