575773,Guest,2008-07-04 16:34:00,0,i have heard some changes may have happened this year on lac seul. what are the bag limits this year and have there been any nigntmares?
575777,Guest,2008-07-04 18:31:00,0,"I'll ""piggy back"" on this question, what are the possession limits? An example, we have 4 fish each in the lodges freezer to take home, but want a final ""fish fry"" the last night with the last day's catch, is that legal/illegal? I'm guessing that the MNR would say illegal, but here(WI), it's legal(possession limit is 2 day's catch)."
575779,Guest,2008-07-04 19:00:00,0,Illegal. Possession is 4 fish each including what you have in the boat plus in the freezer. Have seen instances where MNR stopped someone on the water then went back to the fisherman's camp to make sure they were not over the limit.
575781,Guest,2008-07-04 19:56:00,0,"Let us not forget that what fish you eat THAT DAY, also count towards posession for THAT DAY. So, if you fry up 4 at shorelunch, the rest better be CPR."
