Water level was about as high as I've seen it but it still may have only been 12-18 inches higher than usual. Late spring made the water cooler - we had very good fishing - but again, that was a month ago. I'm sure you'll have no problems finding fish. Rich"

575732,Guest,2008-07-03 08:45:00,0,I fished Pakwash from June 26th through July 1st. Fishing has been outstanding this year. Many larger fish (walleye) between the 25 and 31 inch range. We fished the beach area near Pakwash provincial park. Water level remains higher than normal.
