575645,mwal,2008-06-30 16:10:00,151,We used them 3 years in a row. 1st they were back up to salted/boraxed fatheads. They seemed to work. The 2nd year they were marginal fish wanted real live minnows. Last year they didn't work well either. Gulp outfished them. This year real live minnows and crawlers or plastics. We still have a bag in case we run out of bait better than nothing. Salted minnows worked better in my opinion. Mwal
575647,Guest,2008-06-30 18:03:00,0,We used the cabelas medium fatheads last year and they didn't work at all. Our own batch of salted suckers worked decent but the crawlers were the ticket for us. Been to Lac Seul 3 times and would never use anything but crawlers for walleye in July and August.
