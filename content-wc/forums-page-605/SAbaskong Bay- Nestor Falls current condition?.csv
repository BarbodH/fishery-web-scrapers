575703,Guest,2008-07-02 10:36:00,0,"SS, I'm heading up July 20th for a second trip, (was At Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock the 1st of June) this time with the family. We will be staying in a private cabin close to Mylies Place in Sabaskong Bay. We went last year about this time and had good luck fishing the reefs, and luck as well fishing the structure. We were going out with a neighbor that lives up there but am unsure if he will be there to ""guide"" us this year. I was ready to post the same questions you had but figured I'd just join in here. Let's pony up the info guys. No need to give up your super secret fishin' hole. Just a few starting points and tips and I'll be happy. I don't get away with the all day of fishing like we do with the guys in June, as I have to grit my teeth and pull the kids around on tubes buring up $6.00 gas most of the day, so I want to make the best of the times I do get to sneek away. Thanks any help! Keep'er on the bottom JohnB.O.A.T."

575715,Obabikon,2008-07-02 17:56:00,2370,"Hey guys, sorry I've been MIA the past couple of days! I've actually been out fishing... (which is something new). Anyhow, we did really well! Nice sized walleyes. 5 over 22 inches in the two days. The big one (I caught :)) 27inches. Both days we had our six fish within an hour and a half. It took me three spots, but I found them in a small cove with a beach... 11 ft deep. Also boated two muskies. 36 and 33 inches... raised a big one, but no luck with a strike. Crappies are biting on the dock, so I'd assume if you find the right spot out on the lake, they'd be going pretty well at the moment. Small mouth and northerns are both doing well... I didn't do any fishing for them myself. But some of the guides said they were catching quite a few. Lots of very nice sized smallies."
575718,Guest,2008-07-02 18:26:00,0,Are the walleyes biting on crawlers yet or what are you catching them on?
575719,Obabikon,2008-07-02 18:29:00,2370,"I only used minnows. I haven't had any guests with crawlers yet. But, I should know more in a few days. (i have a guest bringing up a flat)"
575740,Guest,2008-07-03 12:35:00,0,Be sure to let us know about the crawlers! Did I run into you last year at a beach in Sabaskong? I was with my wife and kids with another couple and you were in a blue bass boat with your gal and a blond lab? JohnB.O.A.T.
575741,Fish_on,2008-07-03 13:57:00,1856,Just got back form Nestor falls late last night. Water temps were from 68-72. Fishing is pretty good but everything is about two weeks behind.
575742,Obabikon,2008-07-03 16:15:00,2370,Not me... I won't be fishing out of anything but am Alumarine 16.5 footer with a yamaha 4stroke on the back of it. 99% of the time I'm wearing a green cardinals hat! If you're up at Obabikon... feel free to stop in!
