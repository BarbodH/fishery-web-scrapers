575570,Guest,2008-06-28 19:56:00,0,How was the fishing in Minaki this past week? We were there last week and fishing was slow.
575572,Guest,2008-06-28 22:39:00,0,"I just got back from Minaki this evening, after spending the last 2+ weeks up there. (We had 6 guys in our first group and 6 in our second.) I assume you were walleye fishing, since the guys we had up there my 1st week reported that walleye was slow early in the week. The second week the walleye fishing sounded like it has started to pick up (and judging by the radio chatter we heard, plenty of 24""+ fish being caught on Big and Little Sand on Thursday and Friday). Even so, we didn't have problems with having a few meals of walleye either week. My partner and I fished almost exclusively for smallies the entire 2+ weeks, and we caught a bunch! We only had 2 days where we each didn't have 100+ smallies in a day (early in the 1st week). We had 3 days where our combined total was well over 300 smallies for the day. The biggest smallie came in at 21-1/2"", with over 75 that were 19""+. The weather during the 2nd week was similar to what we had toward the end of the 1st week -- calm to moderate winds with plenty of sun. This helped warm a lot of the water off the river (e.g. Big Sand), and water temps in many of these areas approached 70 degrees during mid-day. There was a heavy current running through the northern end of Little Sand and Rough Rock the entire 2 weeks, which kept water temps down in the upper-50's and low 60's the whole second week. Although no one in our groups specifically target musky, it seemed musky also started picking up the 2nd week. We only caught 6 total for our group the 1st week but had 10 the 2nd week. Largest musky was 40"" the 1st week and 48"" the 2nd week. I suspect musky will be even more active over the next few weeks. We caught more and bigger pike the 1st week, when compared to our 2nd week. In general, it seemed like pike had started moving from the biggest bays early in the 2nd week, as surface water temps started climbing >70 degrees. The pike we caught in the bays were smaller the 2nd week. (The weeds in most of the big bays was pretty sparse and stunted anyway, and most were relating to rocks or ledges.) Pike fishing on main lake shorelines seemed to be better the 2nd week. Crappie fishing was better the 1st week, and only a couple were caught during our 2nd week. However, we did manage to get into some big pumpkin seed sunfish the 2nd week while bass fishing with small plastic craws -- they were bright gold and orange! There were some monster schools of minnows that began to show on main lake shorelines and some of the shallower bays late in the 1st week -- that kept getting bigger and more common during the 2nd week. I think that contributed to the increase in walleye we caught off the shore while fishing for bass the 2nd week. Chuck"
575589,Guest,2008-06-29 10:37:00,0,"Thanks for the detailed info. We were there the week of June 15th to the 19th. The walleyes were scattered and hard to catch more than one or two in a spot. The weeds weren't up in our usual bays and the big Northerns were't in the bays yet. We did manage two Muskies one 43"" and a 33"". Where did you catch the crappies and what do you use for bait? We have been going to Minaki for many years and this was one of the slowest years for us. Thanks again for the info."
575590,Guest,2008-06-29 10:47:00,0,"Caleb, We found the crappie in Tunnel Bay, in 3 locations. If you look at Tunnel Bay on the map, it looks like an upside down cowboy boot. We found them on the top of the boot toe, in the heel near the trees that were in the water, and top of the foot (following that convention), in 2 to 4' of water; out to 10' of water in these locations. We also tried Hidden Lake, and the far east side and the outlet where Blue Berry Lake enters Rough Rock, without any luck. We caught our first one by accident on a 1-1/2"" silver colored tube while casting the shore line for very finicky smallmouth (that were affected by the bad cold front), that we experienced June 14-16. So we switched to a 1-1/2"" silver plastic minnow about 1-1/2' under a bobber. We cast them to the shore, would let them sit for a bit, pull them back to the boat about 2 to 3 feet, let them sit, etc. They generally ran 8 to 12"" or so. Chuck"
575601,woods,2008-06-29 16:19:00,646,Our group felt that the fishing for walleye at Minaki was the best in 24 years on Thursday and Friday. Each boat caught 30 to 50 large walleys those days. All caught in Big Sand near Trapper's in 10 - 17 ft depth.
575602,Guest,2008-06-29 16:26:00,0,"13-20th and just hammered the smallmouth, lots of big ones, best fishing I have had in a long time up there."
575622,Guest,2008-06-30 00:46:00,0,Was that Thursday and Friday of last week or the week before?
575629,woods,2008-06-30 12:21:00,646,Thursday and Friday of last week.
575637,Guest,2008-06-30 13:44:00,0,I had no idea that pumpkin seed panfish were even the wpg river water system
575649,Guest,2008-06-30 19:08:00,0,"Brian, Yes, we found them down in the bay where the Black Sturgeon River enters the Winnipeg. They were right around the corner of the new dock on the South corner of the bay, along a long rock ledge that had brush and trees in about 2' of water. We had been casting the ledge with 2"" Zoom lil' critters looking for more smallies along the ledge, and were suprised at thier size and how aggressive they were. Chuck"
