574759,DonC,2008-06-07 22:21:00,93,"Well like Wolverine Fan, we just got back from Minaki. The fishing was very good. Had my wife, 2 daughters and others to make a group of 10. Stayed at Birch Island Resort. Very good accommodations, equipment and food. Fishing for smallmouth, I caught a 44 inch muskie and another in our group a 49 inch muskie. My daughter caught a 27 inch walleye in Duck Bay south on a tube in 5 feet of water. We had our best day for smallmouth, catching 145 for our boat. Personally caught 5 smallmouth 18 inches and larger. Largest for me was 19.5 inches. Caught most on tender tubes, color was green pumpkin with orange flake. The largest walleye in the group was 28 inches. Daughter and fishing partner both caught 38 inch pike. The fishing is improving. Not many fisherman out this year. Good fishing for all going to Canada this year, Don"
574767,Guest,2008-06-08 11:02:00,0,"Don, Thanks for the report, sounds like you had a good time. Did you do any good on the chatterbaits, or were the smallies pretty much still in a little deeper water? Did you get down to Adamson? Did you spend most of your time north or South of Minaki? With the season as late as it is, I suspect you found more smallies and pike still in the big coves, rather than on main lake points and shorelines? We leave Thursday and will be gone until the end of the month. Chuck"
574768,DonC,2008-06-08 11:33:00,93,"Chuck, We spent all the time south of the bridge, except for Lost Lake near Minaki. In the large bays, especially those with current, the males and females were in 1-5 FOW. On the main channel and Gunn Lake, the females were staged out around 5-7 FOW. We used chatterbaits without much success. We fished Adamson in a boat one afternoon for 3.5 hours with 20+ MPH winds and caught 32 smallmouth. Largest 18.5 inches. Would have done much better with less wind. Water temp up north of Minaki I heard was 48 degrees, so did not want try there. Water temp south was in the mid to upper 50's, but did come down during the week. Holst was 64 and dropped to 54-56 by the end of the week. Warmest was McFarlane at 68 initially, though it dropped to around 60 later. Tubes worked slowly were effective. One day I had to let the tube sit on the bottom for 10-15 seconds after each time I moved it, which caught females. Good luck, Don"
574769,Guest,2008-06-08 11:40:00,0,"Wow, that is some cold water, no wonder the tubes are working better than just about anything else. Hopefully it will warm up a bit this week. Of course weed growth, current and weather can be major factors as well. Glad you got into Adamson! Thanks for the info. Chuck"
574786,Guest,2008-06-09 06:53:00,0,"Don, Thanks for the report. I leave this Friday (13th). Sounds like the spawn should be in full swing by then."
574799,DonC,2008-06-09 09:23:00,93,"Aaron, Hope you hammer them. They should all be up shallow for the spawn unless the cold weather and water temperatures continue. You should do well and hit it just right. Don"
574801,Guest,2008-06-09 09:26:00,0,"Looks like there is a pretty good warm up in store for next week, can't wait."
574802,Guest,2008-06-09 09:40:00,0,"Aaron, try going into Vermillion this year. The lakers have been very co-operative this year. But after all the rain we have had of late and expected this week it will be a sloppy walk in."
574808,Guest,2008-06-09 11:42:00,0,"thanks.....I can't remember the last time I was in there when it wasn't a ""sloppy walk""..LOL How is the water level this year?"
575038,doc,2008-06-13 15:00:00,143,Any recent reports? I leave Saturday the 21st. What are the gas prices at the boat gas stop by the bridge? What are the prices at the pumps in Canada? Thanks
