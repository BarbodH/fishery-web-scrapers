One guide I talked to today said that fishing has been ""too good"" and considering the camp he was working at had guests fined for over their limit, he was probably right. Back to your question. The camp is very nice and the owners will be there when you need any help.....a small camp atmosphere. I am thinking we are on the verge of the start of a mayfly hatch, which, contrary to many peoples opinion, is not all that bad. Some of the warmer bays will start first with the hatch.....Sportsmans is one of them. Walleyes will be putting on the feed-bag and moving into the shallows to feed on hatching larvae. Target mud flats and weed edges using crawlers or minnows. Trolling with stick baits is also productive.....emerging weeds, etc. At times the hatch is at its peak when the water is the warmest...mid-day...don't overlook the shallows at this time of the day....you might be surprised. Sometimes oversized baits or fast retrieves will trigger some big, fat, overfed walleyes that are lurking in the cabbage or in nearby deeper water. Good luck with your trip!"
