574751,Guest,2008-06-07 09:19:00,0,">Would that be the catch and kill tournament? ............ NO >THANKS. I agree completely with this comment. I can't believe the MNR and the folks in SL are letting this happen. If there are 100 boats with two fishermen/women each, and they can keep four each day, that's 1600 dead walleyes, 400 of which will be over the slot. In mid-June, everyone will quickly get their three fish 17 to 18 inches, the prime eaters, then spend all day looking for the biggest fish over to keep, so the biggest fish that carry the most eggs will get wiped out. Incidentally, where does the MNR come off letting them keep two days worth? The possession limit for me is four; unless I can eat all four in one day, its C&R for me after I have four in the frig. Why not run this tourney as Catch, Photo, Weigh and Release Immediately? Same for all tourneys, for that matter. Then there are many fewer casualties. In my camp on Minnitaki all the cars are from Wisconsin and Minnesota, partly because the fishing down there is not as good as on Minnitaki, partly because they run tournaments on the lakes down in the US. Sure US tournaments are C&R, but many walleyes don't survive the R. It is the folks who go to the camps that run the tourist economy up there, not two day wonders. If this screws up the fishing there, I'll look for someplace else that isn't so much gas to get to."

There are currently about 30 teams entered and they can only have 1 over slot per day and 3 under (per two person team). That means a maximum of 60 over slot walleye and a max of 180 unders. As far as the under slot are concerned that number will be taken and eaten every day in Sioux regardless of a tournament or not. I think it's the over slot ones that concern people. I too wish the MNR would drop the catch and kill reg in Sioux waters. I think that is the issue here. Ontario should have one set of regs for live wells not two."

Waste time running back and forth from weigh stations to avoid loss of weight from shrinkage. Great for spectators too. Let's go sit at the weigh station all day so we can see a bunch of under slot fish. Organizers wanted a hundred teams, and that would have been a lot of dead fish. Sioux Lookout deserves a good tourney and should be allowed to run a C&R tournament."
