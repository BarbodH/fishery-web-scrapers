575787,Guest,2008-07-05 07:09:00,0,We fish it once a year in August. Good lake and we don't see many people fishing there. I wouldn't say it ranks with Lac Seul but if you're staying there it is worth it. We caught walleyes to 6# and quite a few northerns.

We fished Lac Seul from Deception Bay. Thats northeast of town. I fished last year Pelican and did very well at moose bay. Hope that helps some. Jigs and minnows and leeaches."
