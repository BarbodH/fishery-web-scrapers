575764,Guest,2008-07-04 11:04:00,0,"Hi Cubbie, We fished there last week, and the water level was very high, almost flood stage. We got another two inches of rain in one 24-hr period, too. The fish were in the weeds during sunny days, sometimes as shallow as 2 fow, and the pitch bite was good using 1/8 to 1/4 oz jigs (gold metallic or pink head seemed best). Most days, we ran up towards Canoe/Grassy or to Sen Bay, where the fish seemed to be more concentrated, but in the evenings, we did really well on mediums (18-21"") right in Lost Lake. We really didn't find much on the reefs, but that could change right quick. Several spots were good for smallmouth, and the fish were just getting on their beds last week, so sand/gravel with structure was lit up. Good luck! KWN"
