But the resorts I have stayed at only have the smaller minnows so I thought I would buy some larger ones. I bought three sizes but never had a chance to use them. The wind blew up on Lac Seul and the bucket dumped over in the boat pounding the waves back to camp. It was too rough to be crawling around the floor picking up minnows. Spent the rest of the week using the flat of crawlers I brought."
575778,Guest,2008-07-04 18:36:00,0,Anybody know the prices of minnows in the local bait shops or will I be okay with only bringing crawlers?
575780,bpetersen,2008-07-04 19:16:00,251,"Early June, Four Seasons was $3.95 Canadian for a mixed size dozen. More like 15-16 minnows."
575258,Guest,2008-06-20 15:04:00,0,"Pat/Gary, what is the price of minnows in Ear Falls? Can you get a ""discount"" if you buy in bulk?(20 dozen,or so, at a time?) We usually bring crawlers in bedding, but, if the minnows are reasonably priced and out-produce everything, maybe we'll look into buying them. Thanks for the updates !!"
575263,Guest,2008-06-20 19:12:00,0,"Was refering to the proprietor of the bait shop in Ear Falls. IMO he isn't worth the tp I use to wipe with. He tends to rub many the wrong way. To bad for his wife, she is the better half of that pair!"
575442,Guest,2008-06-24 18:59:00,0,"Ok, I just got back form fishing the NW (Rat Bay/Mckenzie/windigo/south bay) love square the week of June 13th-20th. I have been fishing this section of the lake for some time now and I have always been impressed by how the different factors (weather, water level, water temperature) vary from year to year. The location presentation and the hot spots seem to differ almost every year with the exception to those good classic walleye ""go to"" spots. June 13th - 20th 2008 was no exception. The cold spring has played a major role in determining the progression of the post spawn walleye. The fish are still following their traditional patterns however with the colder weather the post pawn transitions have been elongated. The fish are still feeding but require a little more finesse or lack there of. With a couple weeks of STABLE warm weather the calendar period that we know will quickly sink with the patterns that many lac seul vets are accustom to. To sum up the trip... The volume of fish was lower than average years but the size of the average fish was as always, fantastic. * Just a note to any anglers that are getting ready to head up to Lac Seul. With the slightly higher water levels make sure to keep an eye out for floating stumps and logs. Would anyone be able to help? Quick question. Is there a resort or an outpost located in or around the Mcintyre Bay area of Lac Seul? Thanks, Northbound"
575531,Guest,2008-06-27 11:09:00,0,"If your looking for bait around Ear Falls, D & E Minnows had the best selection of minnows and leeches. They are located just north and west of town."

575544,Hump,2008-06-27 16:58:00,578,I think Evergreen sells good bait also.
575581,Guest,2008-06-29 08:42:00,0,"Are the prices ""better"" at D&E bait than the Four Season bait shop? Going to Goldpines resort so the Four Season shop is along the way. Is there a ""bulk rate"" if you purchase several dozen minnows at a time at either place? Thanks for the help !!"
575586,Guest,2008-06-29 09:24:00,0,"I don't know about a bulk rate, but D&E had a great selection. They are a bait dealer and trap the bait themselves. I was able to get larger minnows there, of course the price went up with the size but it's nice having so larger ones in the bucket."
575593,Guest,2008-06-29 12:24:00,0,"How do you get to D&E from the Four Seasons? How far? Did you get more fish with the bigger minnows?(or better sized ones?)

574729,Guest,2008-06-06 07:48:00,0,"Bit of rain this morning so I'll drop a quick note over a cup of coffee. The fishing is going great, walleye are moving to the mouth of the shallow bays and are bitting surprisingly shallow at least for those that are used to the Midwestern bite; can be normal here as the post spawn feeding gets going. Mac bay is doing well also as walleye move out of the creeks. Many customers run short of bait as the fishing has picked up, lots just below the slot and some really nice fish in and over. We have had fishermen that ran short of bait, trolled Raps and have landed 20""+ smallmouth regularly."
574798,Guest,2008-06-09 09:19:00,0,"Gary, Where in your part of the lake have guys been having luck trolling for the smallies?"
575164,Guest,2008-06-17 13:41:00,0,"I just returned from another successful trip to Lac Seul and Evergreen Lodge I was only able to fish for three days and the weather was a half step better than miserable I'm so thankful for my rain gear. In my opinion fishing seemed spottier this year than previous, it seemed like fish were at the spot or they were not, but after a little searching we found a few places in Sawmill Bay that made the trip worth while. 4  10 feet of water most of the spots were between 4-5 feet and orange seemed to be the color of choice. The Sanctuary opened up while I was there so we spent the obligatory 45 minutes there before we decided to leave the boat show some people swear by the sanctuary but our group has never had any luck there. Seemed like the pike and perch population are up significantly Also caught a small musky around 20 or so my fist musky, I don't understand all the fuss :-) Also some threads talked about numbers of boats and anglers being way down from previous years seemed like a pretty average number of boats to me 361 days till my next trip start the countdown"
575167,Hump,2008-06-17 16:49:00,578,"Any other hot spots? Steamboat, fishermans pt, Goose Bay? How is the lake level?"
575185,Guest,2008-06-18 07:59:00,0,"We also did well at the tried and true ""Lunker Point"" We went to the mouth of Steam boat and didnt go any further... never fished in Goose bay There was also a spot right on both sides of the opening of Sawmill one side has a dozen or so dead trees standing in the water... they were there, but unless you anchor you had to be real careful. I talked w/ the guy... I forget his name at Four Seasons bait shop, he was asking me about bait, I told him that we mostlt fished w/ minnows but on guy did ok w/ leeches... then he told me that leeches were his most popular bait... hmmmmmmmmmm"
575186,Guest,2008-06-18 08:11:00,0,"ohhh... also the water level seemed pretty average, I gues it has come up over a foot in two weeks"
575198,Guest,2008-06-18 15:59:00,0,"Fish still biting in and near the mouths of bays. Too early for Steamboat, that's July territory the way things are going this year. Mack bay is always 10 days or so behind Sawmill as it is deeper and cooler. I've fished this area since 1958 and I can tell you that a minnow is the day in day out bait for Lac Seul. Leeches will work quit well during warm weather. The gentleman mentioned is a broker for leeces and sells to the general road traffic going who knows where. I am also a licenced commercial bait harvester and the call for leeches is about a pound for every 4-500 dozen minnow. If you need some really nice big leeches stop in as I always have a few. AVS, hope you had a good time and see you next year, Patty."
575225,Guest,2008-06-19 20:11:00,0,"Bet if you pounded the fish on Leeches, the bait of choice would be something different! Beware, he speaks with forked tongue!"

Two fisherman, same boat, one fishing leeches, one fishing minnows, ALWAYS the one fishing minnows out fishes the leech bait.

Patty I read FLYINONH20 comments as more of an insult to the guy at 4 seasons... always looking to sell you something you dont already have. I would echo your comment about leeches vs minnows... a guy in my boat was fishing them and I saw it first hand! AVS"
574343,bpetersen,2008-05-27 14:24:00,251,"Anybody have a fishing report for the Ear Falls area, yet?? Spots, depths, bait, etc. Pete Fish Hawk/Powered By Yamaha"
574373,Guest,2008-05-28 11:37:00,0,"Just talked to Timberlane Lodge out of Ear Falls. Wendy said the fishing was real good so far this spring. Didn't get much detail, sorry. I just hope it holds up for 23 days. Leaving in 16 for a week up there - can't wait!"
574402,Guest,2008-05-29 07:03:00,0,Even a water temp would come in handy.......
574507,Guest,2008-05-30 19:27:00,0,"Year got off a bit slow with cold water and walleye in the middle of spawn. Early temps were in the very low 40's; they are now up to 50+ with the creek mouths still on the cool/cold side as the bush thaws out and cold water drains in. Bush areas stayed frozen for some time after opener; I trap bait commercially and the leech ponds had frozen bottoms till a week or so ago leeches now coming on and the Dace spawn is over, Golden shinners are in and the Fat Heads are getting active. Back to the big lake, walleye bite is great, the big girls are in a post spawn hunger, this week about 40% or so of the reported catches were in or over the slot, some nice Northern caught, bigest was 18.5#, smallmouth here near Ear Falls were up to 20-21"", getting better each year. We had a 7.5# spotted musky caught near the entrance to SawMill Bay, more seen around here each year. Bottom line, great bite, lots of eaters, weather is mellowing out and we look forward to great fishing for some time. Cycles are 10 days or so behind for those that like to follow the annual cycle, warm weather will close the gap. Gary"
574516,Hump,2008-05-31 08:39:00,578,"I didn't realize that this area had smallmouth or musky. Two years ago , I was reeling in a walleye and a big fish took it. I swear it was a musky, but everyone told me I was nuts. That may be true, but I think it was a musky."
