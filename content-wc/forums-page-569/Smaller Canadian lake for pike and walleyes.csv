1080272,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-11 16:52:00,803,Oh one more thing though - Bill when was the last time you were at Wukusko? Because it has been in a depressed state as far as fishing goes for the last few years. There are reports of it picking up though. The lodge is excellent and there are a tonne of great lakes no more than a 1/2 hour drive so yes a very nice place to stay for sure.
1080330,Northern Manitoban,2009-02-11 19:15:00,195,"Bill fishes Tramping Lake, from what I heard like you mention Wekusko has picked up, I remember back in the early 90's while camping there all most all the sites were full was crazy there, boats all over, then nothing, it died due to the fishing, I fished many days on that lake one summer did not even catch a walleye, i have gone back to camp there as it is an awesome place, but i don't launch my boat there, I go to Tramping, Doubt I will ever fish that lake again (Wekusko). Tramping is another story a great pike and walleye fishery and also Lake trout in there."
1080347,Bill Krejca,2009-02-11 20:32:00,6107,"Yeah, I am aware of the Wekusko Lake fishing status saga, although I thought it was maybe getting better. I have just fished Tramping, as NM stated, and it is pretty good. I haven't been there for 3-4 years, though. Bill Krejca"

1081471,Guest,2009-02-16 10:08:00,0,"Take a look at Jim and Julies website www.wabaskangcamp.com very friendly people and reasonable rates. You'll enjoy the northern fishing as well. This is my brother's place but I'd recommend any of the resorts on the lake, you won't be disappointed. Wabaskang is just south of Lac Seul...where are you driving from?"
1082001,Guest,2009-02-18 15:08:00,0,"Might want to take a look at Cedar lake. It has really nice pike and good numbers of walleye. It's also not that big, only 6K acres or so."
1082015,joeman79,2009-02-18 16:07:00,417,I would like to know where to go pike fishing where it is good in August. (In NWO) All we caught was little pike fishing weedbeds. Bigger Northerns were deeper and had a few break offs fishing for walleye.
1117117,Kevin R,2009-06-29 06:10:00,305,"I think the change in weather is part of the reason Pike fishing is not the same as in the 70's & 80's weed beds are not like they use to be so small pike have less places to hide along with the now present commorants than gooble up small pike & walleye. Some lakes were so loaded with small Pike 18""-25"" you could average about 10-per person an hour. Bigger Pike over 30"" are about as common to catch as 20"" pike now days. Today I catch about 2-3 per hour but the size average is 26""-36"" with a jumbo over 40"" about 1 out of 15. The Walleye fishing has never been better more fish & much larger average size, almost never catch any less than 14""."
1117329,Guest,2009-06-29 18:37:00,0,Take a good look at the Wabaskang. There are several nice camps there and the scenery is beautiful. You can fish alot of water for northern and walleye. Check out SleepyDogCabins.com
560276,DanL,2006-08-12 21:57:00,262,We are looking for a smaller lake for pike and walleyes. We are looking for a drive to lake with nice accomendations. We just got back fron Lac Suel and we were disappointed in the pike fishing. We are looking for a lake with more weed beds as we fish pike about 50 percent of the time. By smaller I mean something in the 10 - 20 thousand acre size.
560314,Guest,2006-08-14 22:55:00,0,Maybe worth taking a look at Manitoba and head out to Athapapaskow?
560369,Guest,2006-08-15 21:18:00,0,Gullrock has a great population of pike. I caught more than i wanted to just fishing for walleye.
560408,Mohleye,2006-08-17 08:47:00,368,"I'd second Gull Rock. We caught lots of northern without ever fishing for them, and a couple 38""ers. I know guys that go there and try for pike, and they always do well."
560412,dollure,2006-08-17 13:14:00,71,Try Stormer Lodge on Kirkness lake. Lots of good size Pike. Great cabins and equipment. Drive in north of Red Lake. A little pricey but good value. Roy
1079531,Captain Ron,2009-02-09 00:55:00,14,"if your looking for great pike fishing try pakwash lake.I fished there quite a bit,we always catch big pike.many are 40 plus inches, there are lots of smaller pike there for eating aswell. the walleye and smallmouth finging is also verry good."
1080000,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-10 16:41:00,803,"You need to get to northern manitoba. From the Pas through Cranberry Portage all the way to Flin Flon you will find the best drive to walleye, pike and trout fishing. Any size of lake, one can always have a good day."
1080031,Larry Mac,2009-02-10 18:46:00,530,"Hi DanL, Boy Bigfishhunter did not hold back and took you right to the Mountain for big pike. I had the pleasure to fish The Pas, Flin Flon area before and it is known for big pike. We travel from Northwest Indiana so the drive was a real adventure. Myself and two 12 year old boys (my son and his friend) in an old GMC One ton dual wheel crew cab pick up with all the food and gear for six guys (they flew). It took us two long days of travel and once you get north of Winnipeg it gets pretty remote. Below is the website of the outfitter we used. It has a drive in lodge and fly-out remote outposts. We flew out to Moody Lake and had a great time. We were only able to go to this camp once because of $$$ but I bring it up because it represents the areas fishing. I forgot to mention the huge Walleye and Lake Trout. Have a great tip wherever you go.www.grassriverlodge.com1-866-BIG-PIKEThank you,Larry Mac"
1080052,Bill Krejca,2009-02-10 19:42:00,6107,"In Manitoba, you might try Wekusko Falls Lodge near Snow Lake. Lots of large walleyes and pike. Drive to lodge is on Grass River, head upstream to Tramping Lake. There is a length limit on pike and walleyes, so the big ones stay in the lake. www.wekuskofallslodge.com Bill Krejca"
1080271,Bigfishhunter,2009-02-11 16:49:00,803,Both of those outfitters are in the area that I am talking about. I just did not mention Snow Lake. Grass river lodge is located right on Reed Lake which is a drive to lake with excellent road access and superb fishing. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you have to fly in to get great fishing until you have visited this area. I have guided around here when I was younger in some of the more remote fly in lakes and now that I am older I just don't see the need to fly in to remote lakes and fish in small uncomfortable boats when I can drive on pavement launch at a decent launch and spend all day in the comfort of my own boat. One of my fav big pike lakes that is a little ways down a gravel road - but still decent- is Cormorant. Excellent pike fishing there. Just remember to let the big ones swim and keep only a few smaller fish to eat and we can all enjoy excellent drive in fishing.
