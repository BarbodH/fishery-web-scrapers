One of the few lessons I didn't learn the hard way.And on a calm night, go out and see if you can see the Milky Way reflecting off the water. It's worth a few bug bites.Have a fun trip.Nimstug"

I've fished for largemouth bass my whole life, but know a lot of my baits and techniques don't apply up there. Hoping to get some advice from you guys (aka Experts) on tips to keep in mind to put more fish in the boat up there. Thank y'all. Ryan"

1117292,snaggletooth,2009-06-29 16:57:00,135,"Berkley's Gulp Alive works as good as live bait. If the water is clear (visibility greater than 5 feet) where you're going, try working deep structure, rocks &/or weeds, with jigs tipped with Gulp. You can catch nice fish vertical jigging directly below the boat. Tube jigs work for smallmouth bass on/along rocky reefs or rocky shorelines. Look for shoreline areas filled with basketball-sized rocks, those are good. If you're a bass angler who has not had some fast/hard smallie action, you're in for a treat!"
1117315,2746,2009-06-29 17:44:00,3206,A bass guy from Dallas went with us last year to Gullrock and was also a first time walleye fisherman. What a hoot! We got him catching walley but once he tied into a northern on a topwater buzz bait all was lost. He spent the rest of the week in the coves and weeds and you could hear him hooting a hollerin clear across the lake. He had a special name for walley fishing that I'll not repeat here but we never really converted him. He did love those pike though.
1117396,texasbassguy,2009-06-29 22:43:00,2,"Ha! That's funny, larrym. And thanks to everybody for the good advice. I'm hoping to bring back some finesse walleye techniques to Texas. I'm assuming drop-shotting a leach and throwing a shakey-head (techniques we down here in TX have borrowed from you guys in recent years) are also good approaches for smallmouth and Walleye?Also - anybody ever heard anything about fishing Shikag? Saw a string on here from 2004 about it, but wondering if there's any more recent scoop on it."
1117544,Paul H,2009-06-30 15:24:00,1232,"Actually - fish a tube like you would for semi-deep smallmouth. Got some of my best walleye one year and would barely hit a jig. Like everyone else says - pretend you are bass fishing - great for pike,, you might want some wire leaders if you value your plugs, spoons, etc. Spinner baits BIG spinner baits do good."

1117664,kyle870,2009-07-01 03:44:00,26,dont try to bass lip anorthern pike no matter how small they can ruin your day.
1117817,boostnut,2009-07-01 14:11:00,9,"Let me be the 3rd to say TAKE YOUR BUZZBAITS! What a blast, the only word I can use to describe catching a nice northern is ""torque"". Unfortunately you're not gonna enjoy bass fishing near as much when you return. We went in August last year, I even busted out a few old moss frogs and threw them on the lilly pads and in the tall grass. If it floats and makes noise take it. My advise, hold on with both hands."
