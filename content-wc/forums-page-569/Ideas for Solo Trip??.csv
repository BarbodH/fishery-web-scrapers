Last year I did a second week in mid-August, as I will this year, so my son and I can fish together. He used to do the early season trips but now teaches middle school math and can't make the early dates.Here's my question.....since I'm retired - and have given up my long held dream of a solo trip in the Quetico - is there someplace I could do a 3rd week each year just by myself and my yellow Lab? In earlier years I'd toss a tent and the camping gear into the truck with fishing gear and head for a state or provincial park for a week. Now, however, a roof when it rains all night and something softer than the ground under me is more appealing. Problem is, I don't want to pay the two-person or four-person minimum charges that camps/resorts need to ask. I'm not complaining about their need to do so, it's perfectly understandable, that just makes it too pricey for me traveling alone.Any suggestions on how/where a solo fishing person can find a small housekeeping cabin for a week during Aug. 1 to mid-September?"
1118032,ukats,2009-07-02 13:46:00,9,"I would suggest you negotiate with the camp you pick to have the extra charge waved. With the economic downturn, camps are very willing to accomodate.I myself, am going with my two sons. They usually charge extra for a single and 1/2 the adult price for each child if two paying adults are going. Long story short, we are going for the price of 1 adult no single person fee and the two children are free.Dave"
1118038,Mohleye,2009-07-02 14:15:00,368,"It never hurts to ask. Most camps are slower late summer anyway, and this year there are probably plenty of openings. Some camps may have an older or less desirable cabin that would be perfect for a guy and his dog that they would be happy to have some revenue from."
1118055,Larry Mac,2009-07-02 15:32:00,530,"Hi JayM5209, I agree with all the responses you have received thus far. I really believe that your preferred outfitter would be happy to accommodate you request if there is any openings. I made a last minute to call to our outfitter for a party of three and they put us into a 12 man outpost cabin with a 1 week notice. Unless it is a fly in I believe you should have no problem finding a cabin for the week. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"

Talk with Pasha Resort over by Lake Nipigon. He is on a nice lake system with very good lake trout, pike, and walleye. He was offering free cabins the whole month of May this year. I can tell you first hand that the lakes in the area are very good, I fished the area for 15 years, sometimes twice a year. There are a ton of small lakes in the area perfect for one person. The area seems very remote, but, you are only a short drive from town. Mike P.M> me if the area interests you."
1118110,Larry Mac,2009-07-02 20:16:00,530,"Hi eyemike, would you please explain how the free cabin deal worked? I find it interesting. We have been offered many different kind of specials this year from free guides to extra days, but this is a new concept to me. Thank you in advance. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1118113,Guest,2009-07-02 20:36:00,0,"You might want to try a late call for a mid week trip...like Monday to Friday.... as the season gets late, and the mid-weeks remain open, some camps will cut you deals...I'm doing a mid-week in July in Ontario ....got a in Tuesday out Friday... basically 3 nights for the price of two and 3 days boat rental for the price of two.... John"
1118182,eyemike,2009-07-03 08:41:00,233,"Hey Larrymac, I often go to the forum idofishing.com. Pasha resorts puts fishing updates on there. This year He offered a free cabin for one week any week in May to any member to the fishing forum. Several people took him up on the offer. What they had to say about their experience was 100% positive. I am sure there were some expenses such as taxes, bait, whatever else, I'm not sure what all, but, still not a hard deal to beat. I can personally tell you Pasha has a fishing gold mine up there. I don't know the owners at all or have I stayed at Pasha, although I have seen their camp, which is very beautiful, I used to stay right across the road at another resort called Endy's Landing. I can tell you that the fishing in the area top notch. Mike"

Hopefully he will be able to take his solo trip with his beautiful canine/friend. Thank you again and have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
