1117021,Obabikon,2009-06-28 17:03:00,2370,"Yes it'll be an issue, your godson needs a passport. It would be easier if he was younger and your child... but, it'll be a bigger issue since he's 16 and not traveling with his parents."
1117233,Mohleye,2009-06-29 13:23:00,368,Question #2....In July sometimes leeches and worms work as well or better than minnows....sometimes not. You can not bring leeches across the border. You can bring crawlers in artificial bedding. Question #3....They do not search every boat or vehicle when you cross the border.
1117464,Babamel2,2009-06-30 09:09:00,414,"Make sure your Godson also has written permission from both parents, which includes the dates you will be in Canada, their home and work phone numbers. You may also want to get their permission to provide emergency medical assistance."
1117468,IowaDave,2009-06-30 09:19:00,69,Just to add to that....have the permission note notorized.
