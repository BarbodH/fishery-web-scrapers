There are very few fisherman, reletively speaking, just because of the long boat rides needed to get to this part of the lake from the East and West sides. The boat ride from the main camp to Williams Bay is approximately 7 miles and takes about 20 minutes. The boat ride is an easy one through the river and you can see Moose and bearsalong the way. Once you get to Williams Bay the possibilities are endless, although I would reccomend not traveling farther than you are comfortable with. The lake is huge and in some places it all looks the same. Good luck. Fixer"

And stayed all day with shore lunch at the Ministries cabin nearby. Williams Bay has some nice areas also. Once you get used to the ride Lac Seul isn't that far away. PM me I can give you good areas to try. Plenty of 21-28 in walleye to be had. There is a public campground nearby, you will see plenty of fisherman, usually hitting the same area's everyday. We've seen Silver Wheel guides in the area also."

Somebody told us it was a campground, and public launch. But we have seen plenty of locals, we had been going that Labor Day week, but at times the boat traffic was heavy. These people will work the same point as you are without hesitation. We've had them snag our markers already. Like I said before, everyone works the same area's because they know it holds fish all the time. South end of Williams Bay"
