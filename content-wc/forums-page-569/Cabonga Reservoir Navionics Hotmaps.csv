1115559,RUDE TROOPER,2009-06-22 13:20:00,65,"joepa, I just bought a new Humminbird 788CI with the Navionics bundle. I also got the Eastern Canada chip just for the resevoir. I am headed up there July 11th. If your up there before me good luck. If not I will let you know how well it works. I read that Navionics did a comprehensive study on the resevoir so I am also very interested in the detail it provides."

He said it works for some fishfinders but doesn't for others. Anyway, he said if successful, the map has all of Cabonga with best fishing areas and marked rocks. I wonder which would show more detail, his or Navionics?"

1115984,still fishin',2009-06-23 23:37:00,69,Steve loaded the map into my Lowrance 522c last year. It's very rudimentary but does have obstructions marked as well as reccommended fishing spots. Has no depth/contour detail but it was helpful. Did not use it this year.
1117542,RUDE TROOPER,2009-06-30 15:16:00,65,"Well I got my HB 788 hooked up and running and just had to throw the SD card of Canada in. Holy smokes boys and girls, if your going to Cabonga you have to have this! Absolutely incredible detail of the entire reservoir. The contour is phenomenal. I cannot wait to get north and start using this. What a time saver this is going to be in targeting optimal locations to try and find walleye. I am very happy. Hopefully we will have some real good reports in about 11 days to go with my excitement."
