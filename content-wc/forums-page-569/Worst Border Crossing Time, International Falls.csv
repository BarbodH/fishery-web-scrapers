1116481,JMKC,2009-06-25 18:14:00,238,"Dutchboy, That's funny, we stopped at that Mobil on the way in and remember trying to talk to that guy, couldn't get a word out of him yet alone a smile. LOL The Ammoco guy told me about the shortage of fishermen. JJ"
1116562,Kevin R,2009-06-26 06:04:00,305,Saturday is the busy day for both ways. I have waited as long as 2hr but last long wait was in July 2005 crossing at Fort Frances border on saturday at 3pm. Out of the way but a pretty ride no wait is Pigeon River not another car in sight in August 2006. You never know though check the website border wait times.
1116563,dutchboy,2009-06-26 06:04:00,5717,The guy has the premier location on the South end of town. Plenty of room to pull in and gas up rigs of any size.A little tar on the parking lot and a huge dose of Charisma would go a long ways.
1116589,Mohleye,2009-06-26 08:33:00,368,"Like someone else said, when we were young and full of p*ss and vinegar, we would leave Friday night after work, cross at International Falls in the wee hours, and arrive at camp Saturday morning. The older we got, the less fun all night driving became, and a near-miss or two with moose finally brought us to our senses. Now we leave early Friday morning, cross late Friday afternoon, and spend the night in Ft Frances, Emo, or Dryden. Long lines on Friday afternoons have never been a problem. We can't avoid the peak Saturday morning rush on the way home, and have had some very long waits some years. We tried Baudette one time, with the extra travel time it was kind of a toss-up. This year on June 6, at 10 AM the wait at ft Frances was only around 10 minutes. Same last year in June and August. I think unfortunately numbers are down enough the border waits are not much of an issue right now."
1116686,alanexpup,2009-06-26 17:37:00,278,Hi. it was the time when those little dolls where all the rage 10 to 15 years ago. well someone got caught trying to sneak a bunch into the states and the line back to the US went all the way through town out to the city limit and then some. thats when we decided to try baudette after all we were almost there already. avoid saturday mornings.
1116767,Larry S,2009-06-27 07:11:00,666,"Your Near miss with a moose ,for me was a Hit with a moose memorial day 1991. It destroyed the wifes car,broke and my buddies arm in two places. My buddy always voiced his opinion that wearing seat belts was bull,but after our close incounter with the moose he will never drive without seat belts. I have been picking out thin slivers of saftey glass from my forhead for the past 18 yrs Larry S"
1117046,BB3,2009-06-28 19:06:00,48,"x2- I only cross there on Holiday weekends, about 20 mins longer to Morson."
1116246,Guest,2009-06-24 21:22:00,0,"My family and I are coming up this next Sat. and are trying to time our crossing. Any suggestions, or this one of the those, you get what you get things."
1116254,JayM5209,2009-06-24 21:38:00,1050,"Try to hit it before 8 a.m. or after 2 p.m. On our annual trips we usually leave from S.E. Wisconsin about 6 or 7 p.m. Friday and hit the Intl. Falls/Ft. Francis crossing between 4 and 5 a.m. Saturday, rarely seeing more than one or two other vehicles at the crossing."
1116347,Guest,2009-06-25 08:52:00,0,"On Saturday I suggest going thru Baudette. Extra miles, but you'll probally save time. John B.O.A.T."
1116349,Guest,2009-06-25 09:05:00,0,"Saturday is definately the busiest day for crossing, I would try to do it before 8 am. I crossed Saturday June 13th at 6 am and there was already a line forming. I would avoid crossing in the middle of the day on a Saturday at the Fort, I've seen that line get pretty long going into Canada."
1116352,joeman79,2009-06-25 09:18:00,417,What about Saturday evening? How would that be? Like say 7-8 p.m.
1116353,elmo,2009-06-25 09:31:00,43,Please do not tell evryone about Baudette it will only slow it down for me. I like the Baudette crossing nice small town and I have not ever had to wait. And I have not paid to cross either.
1116359,dutchboy,2009-06-25 10:09:00,5717,"If you don't want a line at I-Falls I would take Friday off, leave Thursday night and cross the border Friday before noon. Other wise it will be a crap shoot for you. Many people are wising up and crossing Friday's then just hanging out or shopping until they can check into their resorts."
1116394,JAY221,2009-06-25 12:32:00,877,"When I was young & stupid opposed to just stupid we used to leave Des Moines @ 5:00pm & drive all night to the Ear Falls area. We would cross the border between 1:00- 2:30 in the morning with no wait @ the border.Now we go up as far as Dryden & stay the night & drive on in the morning. We cross the border in the afternoon hours(3:00 or so) with little to no wait. Later, Jay"
1116397,alanexpup,2009-06-25 12:39:00,278,avoid saturday morning like the plague for sure at all costs coming and going. baudette is good but its like 40 miles each way. by the time you travel that far you would be accross the border. if possible its best to cross on friday night. there is a web site that gives border crossing times at all the crossing but i forget what it is. you could google it though.
1116403,JMKC,2009-06-25 12:59:00,238,"BS- We crossed on Saturday, June 13th at 2:45 PM. The wait was 10 Minutes, about 20 cars. All four boothes open. Last year same weekend was 1 1/2 hours, go figure. You never know. Gas station owner in The Falls said they were down 40% so far this year at the crossing. JJ"
