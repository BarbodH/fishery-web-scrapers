In the past, we stopped at Dutchie's for a ""introductory"" 6-pack of 'Batts and finished it across the road. Question: Is Dutchie's open on Sundays in the summer and can they sell beer on Sunday's?"

When we crossed on Sunday this year the Fort Frances LCBO did not open until noon and most of the LCBO's further north were closed all day. That said, I am getting to know more about The Beer Store."
1065274,Fred_G,2008-11-20 18:02:00,908,Dutchies opens at 8AM seven days a week during the summer. I'm not sure on the Sunday beer sales question.
