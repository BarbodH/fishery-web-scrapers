1118168,Kman67rsss,2009-07-03 07:18:00,30,I am headed to Gouin reservoir tomorrow night. We are taking my Duramax (Diesel) pickup. I always use power service additive when i tank up. Can i bring my bottle with me across the border or will there be problems? I have a new unopened bottle ready to go. I have also heard that they still run low sulfur diesel up there. any truth to that? Also Does anyone know if the hotel/resturant/fuel stop called mile 22 has diesel? Thanks for the info.
