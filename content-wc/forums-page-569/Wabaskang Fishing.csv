Curious as how the fishing was last week because I will be there next year at this time. What depth's, what was the favorite bait and how was the weather."

1118276,Guest,2009-07-03 19:37:00,0,"quick report from Wabaskang as I am up here now. Sat thru Monday brought torrential rain and wind. Many did not fish sat or sun. Monday was also crappy but the fishing was fantastic for those tough enough to battle the elements. My buddy Chad and his dad slammed the big northern with a 42 and 41 on Monday. My wife drilled a 43 on Tuesday. Many big walleyes are being caught all over the lake. I am fishing from McCloud all the way to the last lake before Wine and catching walleyes in every lake. Most common depth is 12 ft on the edge or in weeds but also all the way out to 20 foot also. Guys in camp are using crawlers alot also, but I use jig/minnow and have alot of success. The weather last two days has been fantastic and I am hoping for clouds as the big northern seem to have slowed down. I'll be up a few more days and give a recap later. I cant speak for Trailerguy but I think you won't be hearing from him anymore he has been busy with things and has not made it up and might not for a long time to come..."
