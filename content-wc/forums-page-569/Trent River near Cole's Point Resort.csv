It's near the city of Campbellford. We used to go there and stay at Cole's Point Resort the first two weeks in June every year for a long time as a family and the walleye and musky fishing was great. We haven't been there since 1999 when the walleye started to really dissapear (I think due to zebra mussels moving in) and Musky were few and far between. I think the musky population went through a spell of ""red spot"" that really hurt the numbers.Has the area made a rebound as walleye and musky are concerned? Other species such as bass and perch have always been good.As I am starting my own family now, I would love to be able to go back and hit'em like ""the old days"".Thanks"
1117740,speck,2009-07-01 10:38:00,13,We just got back from Rice Lake and have some info there if you would like. I didn't fish the Trent river but stayed in the lake and the walleye fishing was good. If you would like more details and can help let me know.
1117944,Rosko2,2009-07-02 05:34:00,4,Sure. I'd like to hear about your stay on Rice lake. Glad ya caught'em. Size? number? water temp? all that kind of stuff would be good.Thanks!
1118011,speck,2009-07-02 11:54:00,13,We stayed at Anglers Retreat near Sugar Island. We have 3 small boys so we spent the majority of the time panfishing which was real good. Most of the walleyes I caught were between the Foley Islands in about 15 ft. of water along the weed beds in the main lake. Deep little rippers about 70-80 ft. back took most of the walleye. I would usually go out for an hour or two in the morning and would come back with a couple each trip. Nothing fast and furious but enough to keep you going back. Our biggest was 5 lbs. I think the water temp. was in the mid 60's. Hopefully we can make it back up there next year-our kids loved the panfishing up there.
