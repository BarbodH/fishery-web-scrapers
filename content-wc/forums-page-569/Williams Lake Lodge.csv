Williams is more of a clear water lake. We always ran up to fish Lac Seul about a 35-40 min run. Run all the way up where Williams Lake merges with Lac Seul (narrows) this is where all the walleye will be, and other fisherman, as there is a public campground not to far away. We also went in September usually 2-3 week, no bugs but cooler weather. I can give you more info if you need it, you will catch alot of big walleye,many in the 21-28 in range, harder to catch small ones. If you have a map I could help you with some spots, my Email is [email protected] I'll be glad to help."
