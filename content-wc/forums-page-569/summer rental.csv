Now we are thinking of staying for 2 to 3 months somewhere up there either in a private home or some resort if the price is reasonable. we have our own boat so we just need a cabin for the summer. any one interested? I know a lot of places dont sell out for the summer and I would guaranty a cabin rented out for the whole summer.
