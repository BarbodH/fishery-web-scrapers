1117410,voyager1,2009-06-30 05:17:00,32,What's ther best way to tip a jig with the Alive minnow? Do you hook it like a real minnow just through the head/lips or do you hook it deeper land thread it on ike a twister tail? Thanks.
1117421,Bill Krejca,2009-06-30 06:37:00,6107,"I usually put it on like a grub. As the composition of the Gulp baits is somewhat harder than normal plastic baits, it doesn't seem to compress as much when bit, thus perhaps hampering hooking. I have found hooking percentage is increased with a larger than normal hook. I pour my own heads and use a number 3/0 hook in most cases where I normally would use a number 1 or so. My worm harnesses get 1/0 hooks. I also super glue the bait to the jig head. Bill Krejca"

1112677,new hips,2009-06-10 15:24:00,498,"Well, tied my gulp alive leeches last year on Red Lake, we had a good bite day going, so why not. They seemed to rap at it fairly consistently but seemed reluctant to swallow it. Finally got one, and then proceeded to go back to live leeches, and started getting them consistently again. Jury is still out for me, I tried them for about 1 hr. I hate to say it but the small price to pay for live bait is worth it. I go up there to catch fish, so whatever it takes. Fly In might be the best choice for Gulp Alive. I will be trying it again this year(it's expensive stuff)"
1112682,Bill Krejca,2009-06-10 15:50:00,6107,"I found one way to increase the leech's action is to use a fairly heavy jig head, maybe 5/8 oz, and just hover the bait about 1/2 ft off the bottom. Try moving the bait up and down maybe an inch. the heavy head will permit the bait to wiggle up and wiggle down, a light head will cause a gliding action, which is not desired. try it, it works! Use the 3"" size. Bill Krejca"
1112715,twobearlake,2009-06-10 17:57:00,379,I have had my best luck with Alive while drop-shotting. I think that technique allows for the most natural action for the Gulp Alive.TB
1112719,CI_Guy,2009-06-10 18:14:00,2118,I've had good results using the Gulp Alive leeches with slow death hooks on a 5' leader. Use a large swivel or the hook will twist your line something fierce.
1112899,rockape,2009-06-11 10:36:00,215,"I used gulp alive 4"" smelt minnows a bit last year. You will catch fish, but maybe not quite as many. You can use the same bait for quite a long time. If you think about it though, it is $20 for the little bucket of gulp. That is like 4-5 dozen minnows. There aren't 48 gulp minnows in the bucket, so the cost difference isn't that much to go with live ones. I keep gulp in the boat if I happen to run out of minnows, or just want to try something different if the 'eyes aren't biting on real minnows."
1113064,hiwayman,2009-06-11 21:25:00,201,"I've not had very good luck with the leeches, but have fished the pumpkinseed crawlers almost exclusively for the last four Canada trips. Only one or two days that the live crawlers or leeches will outfish the gulp! Another plus is that I use JB lures vibra flash spinners. I have our whole bunch converted to the JB spinners as they outfish any other spinner out there! the gulp is good for 4 to 6 fish per crawler so it ends up being cheaper and more effective than live bait for me."
1113073,Steve of Madison,2009-06-11 22:19:00,230,Cheaper than buying a flat of nightcrawlers for $50 for 500?
1113741,WalleyeCrazy2,2009-06-15 13:13:00,29,"Just got home Saturday night from Caribou Falls. I fished with 3"" Minnow Grubs and 5"" leeches on a 1/4 ounce jighead most of the week. I have excellent success jigging with the Minnow grub right over the side of the boat. We had one day when 75% of the fish were caught with the 5"" leech. We were also using minnows and crawlers, but the leech did better. I put them on a 60"" silver spinner behind a 3/4ounce bottom bouncer and had great luck. The last day I cast the 3"" minnow grubs all day and caught about 60 walleyes. This is the 2nd year with Gulp Alive, I will still bring crawlers from Vados next year, but I will definately bring Gulp Alive."
1116966,Glenman12,2009-06-28 09:57:00,762,we fished the Gulp Alive minnows just south of you on Cedar the week of the 13th and did well with them..how did you end up doing with the leeches on Perrault?
