Through Nestor Falls Sunday to White Pines. I have seen several posts about ordering crawlers from various sources (ie. Cabelas, Bass Pro, Vados Bait). I was wondering if there are any sources in Canada on the way up? Makes it a bit easier. Any suggestions? How about leeches? Thanks...Nick"
574474,nicko,2008-05-30 08:43:00,508,There are no places to get bait between Baudette and Sioux Narrows? Must be I didn't ask If I could drive to Canada with a DUI again....:)

""passing through Baudette the morning of the 22nd. Through Nestor Falls Sunday to White Pines."" I don't know where white pines is or what route you're taking. Nestor Falls has some good bait shops. Eastwood's Bait and Tackle, 1-807-484-2401 Anglers Pro Shop Nestor Falls located next to Dalseg's IGA Grocery on Hwy 71 in Nestor Falls, Ontario. Phone: 807-484-2525 [email protected]http://www.anglersproshop.ca"
574506,nicko,2008-05-30 17:25:00,508,"Thanks.....I guess I didn't realize there was more than one way to get from baudette to Nestor Falls. It looks like one main road. White Pines Lodge is between Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows. When I look at a map, I see one road that goes between those places. The Trans Canadian highway. I Guess thats we get such poor scores internationally in geography. Thanks...I'll look those up."
