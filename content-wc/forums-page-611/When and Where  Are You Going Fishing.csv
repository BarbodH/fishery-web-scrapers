Our group is mainly made up of guys who are die-hard walleye nuts. One guy though is really interested in having a chance to catch some large (40""+) Northern's.. I know there are some great northern lakes out there (Wollaston,Lake Athabasa, Gods Lake etc)but they are a bit out of our price range.. Would really appreciate your report after the trip. Thanks; Gene Theisen"

I don't know of any ""deals"" like mine, but I would suggest calling or checking on-line with real estate brokers in the areas you want to fish. They frequently rent properties for owners, or have them to rent themselves. Other than that, start asking around town where you fish, someone might know something. That's how my wife found this place. The Mayor's wife showed it to her. Lucky break for me. It's been about 8 years or so that I have been in this house."

572594,rpieske,2008-04-02 18:27:00,1276,Hey Brad: I live in Nestor Falls for 4 months each year. I started coming here in 1953. Long time ago for sure.
572595,rpieske,2008-04-02 18:40:00,1276,"It's pretty expensive the way I do it. I rent a 3 bedroom/2 bath house right on the water. I rent it by the season and we close it down when I leave. It runs about $18,000 for the 4 months. Included is a boat dock, satellite tv and phone service. I have use of a boat house that sleeps 8 and is air conditioned. I spend around $4,200 per season in gas for the boat. All in all, I guess it costs me around $26,500 per year to be there. That comes out to about $225 per day. I have lots of company and donate a week all expenses trip for two to my cottage including air fare, guiding, license, bait, food, beverages, etc. to a charitable auction each year. It went for $3,300 last year. Let me know if you want to bid. LOL"
572597,CDNWalleyehunter,2008-04-02 19:52:00,17,"It must get expensive, with gas prices and the cost of everything going up. I am very lucky to live in northwestern ontario. I go out every chance I can get. I fish Lac Seul, Wabigoon, and Eagle Lake, alot. But there are some smaller lakes in the area, with access by logging roads, that have Dynamite fishing. I mainly fish for walleye, but when I guide canoe trips to White Otter Castle on the Turtle river system, I know places where 4-8 lb smallmouth bass are caught at a regular basis. Can't wait for the ice to break and to be out there in my boats and canoe. Hope to see you on the water."
