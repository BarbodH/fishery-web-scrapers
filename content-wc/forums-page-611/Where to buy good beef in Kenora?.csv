As a result we take all our steaks, hamburger and prime rib with us. The steaks and hamburger are frozen and I put the prime rib in a cooler packed in ice and it stays good over our trip and until Wed. just in the cooler with ice. Then it's into the oven at 150-200 degrees for 4-5 hours and after a 30 minute rest it's ready for supper. Great for sandwiches the next day as well!"

574500,Guest,2008-05-30 15:01:00,0,"I seldom buy meat, I eat moose and deer, but I think Costco hangs there meat for 28 days. Cantors Grocery it's at Logan and Quelsh is known for good meat. Sobey's i've heard good things. Or just about any butcher in the northend in wpg ( there is lots ) and they have the best kobasa in the northend As well tenderloin meats & sausage at 1483 main st is well know for good meats"
574505,v-bay gord,2008-05-30 17:24:00,3168,Consumers Frosted Foods in Kenora......many of the camps buy all their meat from them. It is just off of the downtown....you could ask for directions as I'm not sure of the street name.
574520,Guest,2008-05-31 13:49:00,0,I agree with gord. The best place to buy your meat is at frosted foods in Kenora. They will cut your steaks the thickness you want. They sell all kinds of frozen goods/have a deli counter for fresh lunch meats. its located by the waterfront(towards the: Inn on the Woods and Safeway store. We buy our steaks for our guests there and they have really thought they are tops. Have a great trip. A.K.
574524,Matches,2008-05-31 14:49:00,236,Don't they sell meat at the Wal-Mart in Kenora? ....(i'm going to be sorry I said that)
