Pike in general were just finishing spawning but some had not yet spawned. Walleye were just entering the spawn but were hitting pretty well so maybe some had finished the spawn. Smallmouth were active inspite of the cold water. By the the time we left the water had warmed to the high 40s in the main lake and up to 60 in some bays. Fishing was very good overall with the fish tending to be shallow with the pike the most active. Biggest fish for the group were 42"" pike, 27"" walleye's and 19 1/2 inch bass. Hot baits were jigs of course and the Husky Jerk and Minnow Rap. Due to the water temps fishing the baits slower rather than aggressively worked best. The border crossings going in at 11 AM on the 24th (10 min) and out 11 AM the 31st (20 min) were much quicker than normal but as we came out on the 31st the inbound traffic was much heavier than the previous week, looked to be a 45 min to 1 hr wait."

574614,PRD1,2008-06-03 09:35:00,458,"We stayed at Caribou Falls and fished Tourist (did not connect with the lakers), Goshawk, One Man and the western areas. You should do well on the walleye and I don't think the lake will warm enough to drive the big pike deep by the time you get there. Smallies were caught in many areas but the Goshawk area was best. Biggest northern was in the One Man area. Walleyes were fewer than some years due to the spawn but still very good numbers and average size every day. The water levels were high but not rushing over the falls at Routine Lake."
