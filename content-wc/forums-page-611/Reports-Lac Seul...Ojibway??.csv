574446,Guest,2008-05-29 19:47:00,0,"Sorry for the late response guys. I've been gone the last two days. Guys in our group did good on Pecker Point, Birch Narrows,Chamberlain Narrows, and Scaler Falls. We did really well off a rock point...don't know the name of it. It is on the way to Pecker Point. There is a rock bar that comes way out with a big rock sticking well out of the water at the end of the bar. It was right on the bend when you turn to head north to Pecker Point. There is probably a name for it but I just don't know, this was my first trip up there. We did catch numbers of fish in scaler were the river comes but no big fish. The sand bar right next to camp produced some big fish 27-29 inches right at dark. I hope this helps you. Enjoy your trip. Arnie"
574476,Guest,2008-05-30 09:08:00,0,"Arnie- Thanks for the post. How did you enjoy your first time up there? How did it rate with other trips you've taken? I'm trying to picture the point you refer to, but am not sure which one it is. Did you catch most fish jigging with a minnow? We leave in a couple of days...am getting excited."
574513,Guest,2008-05-30 22:13:00,0,"We caught all our fish of jigs and minnows. I tried experimenting with plugs and plastic but not much for action. I switched back over to simply a jig and minnow and the bite was back on. The point I'm refering to is going north out of the chamberlain narrows you take a left and go I suppose a half mile and then take your first right. Once you make your turn back to the right (heading what I would consider north towards pecker point)there is a long rock bar off to your left that comes probably half way across the channel. I fished the south side of that rock bar that comes out and they were loaded in there. We caught tons of 20 plus inch fish on the south side of that rock bar. We had 3 over 27 there, caught a northern crowding 20lbs there as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my first trip up there and hope to go back next year. In comparison to other trips, I enjoyed catching bigger fish then normal on this trip. I've fished eagle lake by Dryden and done ok with numbers and a few big fish. The area we fished on Lac Suel consistently produce bigger fish on average. The one day we kept track, we caught 91 walleyes and 73 were over 20 inches between the two of us. I don't know if that is normal or just because of the late ice out, none the less it was a blast. Good Luck on your trip."

574242,Guest,2008-05-23 08:25:00,0,"Just talked to a friend that just returned from Ojibwa Outfitters He said that fishing was good, but spottier than years past, some boats killed em while others were slow (by Lac Seul standards) He told me that the big fish of the trip was 30.25Â”. Caught off the dock! AVS"
574261,IMWalleye,2008-05-23 17:06:00,35,Got an email from the owner this afternoon...indicates lots of walleyes. Says the guest are complaining that they are too big! Hope they save some for me...I'm there on Thurs 5/29.
574272,Guest,2008-05-24 08:24:00,0,The ice went off the big lake on Tuesday. Went up to Birch narrows and did just OK. Within a week should be great as they come back from up north
574291,Guest,2008-05-25 13:16:00,0,"I just got back late last night. I thought it was great. I understand it was a little slow from Lac Suel standards but the ice just went out on Tuesday (the day we arrived) so the water is quite cool yet. Mostly 40-42 degrees. We caught 30 to 90 fish a day. Tons and tons of fish between 21-29 inches. Almost all of them still full of eggs. We netted a 41 inch pike that had a 20.5 inch walleye in it's mouth, kind of a neat experience. Each day the fishing got stronger so next week I would think would be phenominal. Jigs and minnows on points and sand bars. 12-14 ft of water probably produced the best but we caught them from 8ft to 24 ft. I hope you enjoy your trip. arnieMn"
574310,IMWalleye,2008-05-26 07:38:00,35,"Arnie...thanks for the run-down. How was the water level? What about your best fishing locations - north (ie, Birch Narrows, Wapesi) , southwest(ie , Bear Narrows, 3 Sisters), the Narrows ? 2 days to go !"
574333,Guest,2008-05-27 10:21:00,0,"Thanks for information everyone! I too, would be intersted in the hot direction from camp. Anyone hitting the falls at Scaler? We usually hit pe**er point, and then up into Wapesi. Also wondering how much gas is at camp...not that it matters. I have heard the water is pretty high right now? I'll post up on our fishing when we return. thanks."
574340,Guest,2008-05-27 13:08:00,0,Any news out of the Lac Seul Ear Falls area? Wondering what the eyes are up to in that neck of the woods. Water Temp? Spawn?
