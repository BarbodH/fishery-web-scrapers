Lung Cancer has hit one of our guys dad, who has been going with us 2 years. Overall, non-gas related items took it from us. With all of us having young families, I'm sure we'll pick this trip up again in 5-7 years - when gas is $20 per gallon."
574691,MoWalleyeguy,2008-06-05 08:34:00,409,"I have made big cuts in my day to day living to be able to afford or even ""justify"" going to Canada again. Its a way of life for us to go at least once a year and many times twice. We just cut back on all that extra stuff we didnt really need. Like eatting out... We have cut out 90% of that. I went from driving 350 miles a week to driving 100 miles a week. (Where the heck was I going all the time?) If going to the grocery store I stop on the way home from work instead of making special trips... it has been amazing how efficient you can be about driving if you just think about it. As far as fishing goes, we stay on local lakes that are just a couple of miles away instead of traveling hours away on the weekends. My gasoline bill is no more now then it was 5 years ago. My trip to Canada will cost more, but saving up by not spending on Fast Food and needless spending thru out the year will more then cover that. For us we are figuring an extra $400 on gas. Thats about a buck a day over a course of a year."
574294,AllenW,2008-05-25 14:29:00,11482,"Gas goes to $7 a gallon and it will be more than gas you'll have to worry about, cost of living will skyrocket and everything you buy will become way more exspensive. This will kill those on fixed incomes, I'd see them not making the trip or reducing the numbers of times they go, for those who have accounts pay for it all, it won't make a difference. The rest of us will scrap the money together until the cost of living is so high there is no extra money. I'm missing the trip this year, I've missed prob twice in about 30 years of a yearly trip to Canada, but am working on the following year, and will increased costs if need be, I can work a extra Sat or get some OT in, I'll be going, once retired in four years, we'll have to see. Al"
574296,cough6609,2008-05-25 17:01:00,48,"I have to admit, we have gone from a trip every year to one every other. Some of it has to do with the cost...gas, the weak dollar, kid in college and another a year away.:boohoo: Some has to do with finding the right week for brothers from 3 different states and a senior from Florida, all married to women who happen to ""like"" to spend time with their husbands."
574307,fourize,2008-05-26 05:24:00,287,"My Dad and I have been going to Canada on our annual father/son fishing trip for 16 consecutive years. It is a trip that has built alot of wonderful memories and friendships that will last forever. The lodge owners have become our extended Canadian family...we are going up for their sons wedding in July. My Dad turns 78 this year, and we will keep going up for as long as he's able. To give up a fishing trip with your Dad in the Canadian wilderness because of the price of gas is unthinkable. 58 more days!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
574321,Muskygary,2008-05-26 17:32:00,137,"I am booked in july for a muskie trip with my son, but he just changed jobs due to a lay off. If the new company won't give him the time off; I'll have to cancel the trip. As far as costs? Well you can't take your money to heaven. Also you can't take your bills!!! Hear we go Visa!!"

574346,Guest,2008-05-27 18:48:00,0,"Interesting. You're wondering if anybody is canceling, we excited to get back! After 30+ years of going AT LEAST once a year (mostly my dad going, until I got old enough), my dad and I managed to miss the last two years, because of various reasons. My dad had a scare with cancer, and when I found myself thinking that we might not ever get to go together again...it was hard. I promised myself that I wouldn't miss another year, as long as he can go. We finally made arrangements this year to go, and we couldn't be more excited! Expensive? Maybe. I say it's priceless! ;) There's no place like it on earth, and not many where I'd rather be."
574350,phishfearme,2008-05-27 20:07:00,1242,"we're doing a fly-in housekeeping outpost with ""north of 51"" outfitters out of pickle lake. fly-ins are getting so expensive that we're considering a drive in outpost (but not a drive in lodge - usually too crowded for our preference). just hard to find one. thanks, phish"
574542,fishman10,2008-06-01 11:24:00,226,"you only go around once my friend. who knows how long you will be around for? i am a canadian who loves to fish. we are now paying 6.00 a gallon. i save money by making my own ice, and i now pick my own worms, and do not buy bait. this compensates for the rising cost of gas. i am blessed to have the fishing that i do in my area of thunder bay. yesterday i went for speckled trout to lake nipigon, caught some in the 4-5 pound range. stopped on the way home for a limit of walleye and then fished lake superior for steelhead specks, and lakers.i pinch myself everyday as i am living in a dream area. there is very few areas in the world that has the variety and accessibility of fishing that we do. so come up and enjoy as you only live once."
574585,drlee,2008-06-02 17:15:00,409,"I think I have resolved the problem of gasoline costs going to Canada from east central Wisconsin: I will drive up once and stay for four weeks, then decide if I can afford to go back home. Seriously, I am 62, have been going to northern Ontario since 1987, will go until I can't physically make it any more. I retired a year and 1/2 ago and make three trips: One to Pashkokogan just south of Pickle Lake, one to Lac Seul, and a two week stay on Press Lake just north of Ignace. I take my own boat, my dog, and friends if they are available. I spend about $10,000 a year on travel and cut expenses in other areas to make that a consistent pattern. I spend a month in northern Arkansas fishing the White River and Lake Norfork, and then take a 2 week trip to some exotic location...last year southern Utah, this year the northern Rocky Mt.s. I am by no means rich, but comfortable. My kids are grown and own their own, I am by myself these days, so no one to really answer to. I also manage to scrape together enough money to take my kids with me to Canada and Arkansas. Now the grandkids are also involved. Wow! If there comes a day when I can no longer do the things I love, fish walleye, fish trout, hunt pheasants, and travel, plus read about 100 books a year, I hope I go quickly and with as little pain as possible, be that at age 65 or 85. FISH ON!"

574263,Obabikon,2008-05-23 17:30:00,2370,"I can say that we have yet to have a person call and say they won't be coming due to rising costs. The truth is, why would someone not go on a planned vacation, over 100 bucks? You'd have to go through a TON of gas for the price increase to cost a single person more than that. Nobody likes paying the prices (least of all me) but I would be willing to give up many other things in my life before giving up my vacation!"
574264,retire55,2008-05-23 17:49:00,1029,"Regardless rising gas costs, I'll continue to take fishing trips. Here's my rationale. In forty plus years of fishing, I've taken many fishing trips. However, when I turned 65 last month, the thought occured to me that the number of fishing trips I probably had left to take was becoming an uncomfortably small number. Consequently, I'll be taking as many fishing trips each year as I can manage."

As ""Dad"" ---- I am the whole group when it comes to splitting the cost for our family trip. $300 more $$$ is just about $6 per week , so I guess that dont really seem as bad as it sounds. I really cant imagine a summer without a Canada trip.........:badidea:"

Other guys are leaving tomorrow morning and 6 more join me for a second week. Fishing is great. Great numbers of walleyes and huge pike on JSM and Suicks. Bringing my wife up in July with two other couples. Probably heading back up a week during Thanksgiving. I'm more concerned about taxes and payroll tax than fuel costs."
574270,Guest,2008-05-24 07:17:00,0,"Some thing to chew on. this was taken from a lodge in Manitoba's website: One day this summer I was walking up the path from the dock to the cabins with one of our long-time customers. We were talking fishing - what else- when he asked me if I knew what his biggest regret was. I was caught off guard and not prepared for a serious conversation so I stammered a little before admitting that I really had no idea what his greatest regret might be. He just smiled and told me that he really wished he had started fishing at the lodge Lodge ten years earlier. I began to see more clearly as he explained that he had recently been diagnosed with a life threatening disease and, after a number of consecutive trips, the likelihood of his returning in 2008 was slight. His news moved me. This wasn't just a customer. It was a friend and I was touched to think that his trips to the Lodge meant so much to him. He went on to explain to me that he had been on the Lodge mail list for over 10 years when he finally decided to make his first trip. It wasn't that he did not have the money to make the trip. It was that he simply did not think there was any big rush. If I don't get there this year, I can always go next year, was"
574280,Guest,2008-05-25 08:27:00,0,"My father is 73 and we know that each year makes it harder for him to make it to Canada fishing so to me, money is no issue when it comes to spending time with my father doing something that we both love. Life is too short to cut corners or become cheap when it comes to spending time with family. We go no matter what!"
574285,Goldeneagle,2008-05-25 09:19:00,78,"Sidge, 73 is a good age. That's me until I turn 74 in July. Last of the ice went away yesterday. Fish are biting. Weather is good. Lots of fine friends in camp. Life is great."
574235,Guest,2008-05-23 06:46:00,0,Does anyone have any thoughts of cancelling their trip for this year? We go in August. If gas is at $5.00-$6.00 I might pull the plug. This will be our 18th consecutive year.
574236,Guest,2008-05-23 06:57:00,0,The only way I would cancel my Canada trip every year is if my wife or kids were severly ill or I was dead. Just tuck an extra $20/paycheck away to pay to the increase in gas prices.
574238,ebuhr,2008-05-23 07:19:00,20,"We are pulling one less boat one less vehicle. Gonna rent one from the resort. Saves $500 in gas that we will split. Bottom line... We're still going!!!! P.S. Aaron, where in Indiana are you from. Our group is from all over Indy, South Bend, and The Fort."
574246,Guest,2008-05-23 10:10:00,0,"Not canceling, but probably not going up as far next year. I hate to even think about it. My consecutive string is the same as yours. I take my family, which I love to do, but it's getting aweful expensive for four."
574248,Guest,2008-05-23 10:26:00,0,Last year we used 145 gallons of gas. If gas is a $1.50 higher that is $217.50 more for gas. We divide the cost among 4 of us so that's $54.37 more a piece. We will lose more lures and spill more liquor than that so we are going. However if the cost continues to rise it may effect future trips. It's not only the gas cost it is all the other products like food and utilities and any all the other products affected by gas costs. This cost at home may make less Canada cash avaliable next year.
574249,jigman 2003,2008-05-23 10:30:00,981,"If (when?) gas hits $7 gallon in the next year or so as predicted, I think an awful lot of folks will be staying an awful lot closer to home. I hate to think of it, but the cost of everything will go up much higher."
574254,worthsr,2008-05-23 12:24:00,52,"We are still going. The 850 mile drive from Chicago and the 30 mile boat trip to our outpost cabin is going to be more expensive this year for sure. But, this is the one week a year I do something for myself and I won't let the price of gas ruin it. This trip allows me to decompress and recharge my batteries for the next 51 weeks of whatever comes my way. Hopefully it's not ten dollar gas. Scott"

574256,back357,2008-05-23 14:02:00,106,"Would really hate to get to the point where I would cancel my annual trip, but between the gas and the exchange rate, the cost this year will be dramatically different than last year. I know everyone keeps talking about the gas, but thanks to the weak US Dollar, we're getting a double whammy this year."
574260,Guest,2008-05-23 16:34:00,0,"""Being frugal, that I do at home."" It is for vacations that I save my money. The increase in the cost of gas amounts to about $200 for each of us (my wife and I). We go for a week and figure an extra $200 per person and we still spend less than $2000 for a week for both of us. If we went to Las Vegas or some other tourist place a week at that price would be a bargan. THe motels and meals alone would cost almost that much. Gas could go up to $10 a gallon and we would still go."
