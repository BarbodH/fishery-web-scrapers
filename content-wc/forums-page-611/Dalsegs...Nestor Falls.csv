I have been thinking of buying Bread and burger buns there also.( Hoping to get one day fresher on the way to camp) Just wondering if they get fresh bread every day or perhaps not quite that often. Does anybody shop at Dalsegs?"

573807,Guest,2008-05-11 17:27:00,0,Is this a pretty good sized store? Could you buy all or most of your food supplies there? Thanks
573811,rpieske,2008-05-11 19:44:00,1276,"Well, I live there for 4 months each summer and I buy all my food from them. It's a pretty decent sized store with a good meat counter and produce section. The bakery is owned separately but connects inside the store."

574578,rpieske,2008-06-02 14:09:00,1276,"What Selene didn't say is that she is the baker there. And a mighty fine job she does, too. Karen will be proud to learn you are drumming up business. Keep those low carb creme puffs coming. But all you guys will have to hold back.....she just got engaged!"
