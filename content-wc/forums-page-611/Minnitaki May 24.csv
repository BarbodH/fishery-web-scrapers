We will be heading to Lake Minnetaki on May 24 and staying on Twin Pine Island. We are all very green to Canada and will not be hiring a guide. None of us in the group are walleye fisherman, we are mainly cast fisherman for bass and northern. Not that we wont be fishing walleye, we will, just want to let you guys know what our experience is. For alot of us in the group this will be a once in a lifetime trip (like my father and uncles) and we are very serious fisherman. But...This is a whole new beast to us. Was curious as to what can be expected in terms of where and how for walleye, smallmouth, and northerns. Especially the smallmouth and northern as to Im sure most of us will be casting the banks like this is the Bassmasters Classic cause thats what we know. Will the smallies be dormant due to the late ice off, what are our chances of catching large northerns and where, etc?? And I dont have any idea where to start with trout. Any and all info will be greatly appreciated and hopefully make some great memories. By the way we are by no means novice fisherman and are avid outdoorsman. Thanks to anyone in advance!! I just cant control my fishing fever right now!! Just gotta talk some fishing!! When I get back Ill inform you guys heading out in June as to how things went. Hopefully spark your fever!!"

Not quite sure about the smallies, but on warm days, they should be coming up shallow to feed. PM me if you want some more direction. When we are up there, maybe we could hook up and trade lies and beers?"
573808,onemorecast,2008-05-11 18:50:00,23,"I agree with the shallow advice. Shallow bays for pike. Shallow drop offs near spawning areas for walleye(as near as you are allowed, there are posted restrictions). don't know on smallies or trout, smallies may be on beds?"

573997,prov1900,2008-05-17 08:37:00,544,Saturday...hopefully no later than noon!!! I am counting the minutes.
574572,csnez,2008-06-02 13:03:00,9,Any reports on the Lake Minnitaki early season fishing? We are staying in the Rice River area mid-June. Hope the fishing has been good. Rice and English will open a couple days after we get there. Please give a fishing report and water level report for Minnitaki. Year 7 for us at Minnitaki and looking forward to it again and again....
574582,prov1900,2008-06-02 16:21:00,544,"Water is up 3 to 4 feet and rising from last year at this time. No problems getting through any narrow areas. Caught the fool out of the lakers and did well on big walleyes. Had plenty to eat each night plus we saved a ton for you when you get there. Your usual spots should be good to go. We fished in the SW Bay region. Curiously, the pike werent readily available. All vegetation, as of last week was dead. That will change shortly. Good luck!!!!"
574591,Guest,2008-06-02 19:37:00,0,"Caught the #### out of the walleye and northern with good size too! Smallies were picking up too. When we left Sat the water temp was close to 50, but if you found the right bay you could find it in the mid 60s when the sun was shining. Water level was 3 to 4 ft high. Blizzards and 75degree weather. Day after the storm it was miserable but the fishing was the best!"
