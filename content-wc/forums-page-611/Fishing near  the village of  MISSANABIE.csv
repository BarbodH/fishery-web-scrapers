574588,Guest,2008-06-02 18:58:00,0,Hello Phish Good to hear from you. I was looking at a small lake called Colborne Lake was looking for some info. We quaded in but didn't fish. I NEVER fish a lake where others are at. My fishing partner was in an auto repair business of his own for 20 years. Business got so bad here in Mich. for him that he had to close and go to work for another business. NO vacation for him. I have been involved in a few very good business vewntures and funds and the price of gas is not a consideration on my part. The price of gas is a big deal to many of the guys that have fished with me. I guess poor selection on my part when things were better. Fished a small lake out in the bush near Missanabie over the short Memorial day weekend caught eyes and pike not the numbers that we see above Pickle. I know you can't go north of Pickle and be any where near satisified just over the bridge. Just not sure what to do. Took a trip to Seattle with the wife and rented a car and drove the coast to San F. THEN OVER TO Denver --nice trip but not fishing. I kind of have my own ideas so not easy to just fish with anyone. Have two son-in-laws who have very good jobs but between them they have seven young children and just can't get away to go above PICKLE EVERY YEAR. lOOKING FOR SOME GOOD ADVICE. i AM 63 BY THE TIME MY GOOD BUD GETS VACATION worth the time I am just another year older. len
