This year one member of our party has a work commitment that will not allow for a resaonable departure time Friday evening, so we are thinking of leaving early Saturday morning which would put us at the border at roughly 11 A.M. Saturday morning. Does anyone have any experience as to how long of a wait we can expect at the border this time of day/this time of year? Pleae advise, thank you."

It's true that the number may be down due to fewer anglers entering at that time of year (hotter weather, mid-summer bite, etc), higher gas prices, and fall of the US $$$. However, when the number goes down, I've noticed they also have fewer lanes open going into Canada, as well. Chuck"

At 11 am I would suspect about the same conditions. If you dont get pulled over it should be a fairly short wait. 10 - 20 min.
