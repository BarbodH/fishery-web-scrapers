574535,Matches,2008-05-31 22:01:00,236,"This post sounds like total trolling. (Sounds like the old days). But of course I'll bite. Best place to buy beer is at the duty free before going into canada. You will pay about $19.00 per case for REAL Labatts. If you bring more than one case in, they will charge you about $9.25 per case duty. Still worth it. You will save about a $12.00 per case vs. buying it in Canada. Now, can someone answer the question if it is legal to drink beer in the boat in Canada?"
574539,Stu,2008-06-01 04:49:00,472,No of course it's not! Thanks for the info.
574545,Guest,2008-06-01 17:29:00,0,Can anyone tell me what time the duty free store opens? We will be up the week of the 4th. Thanks.

574314,Guest,2008-05-26 10:42:00,0,Our group will be going up next week to Cedar Lake (crossing at International Falls). Does anyone happen to know where the best beer prices are? Thanks!
574316,Guest,2008-05-26 11:04:00,0,buy it at your local liquor store and pay duty it is by far the best way to go.....heading up july 11 have fun
574317,Guest,2008-05-26 11:20:00,0,"Beer prices are all the same. Unless you do the duty free, etc. Buying it at the Beer store or LCBO will all be the same as its government regulated on prices no matter if you buy it in Fort Frances or Kenora, or elsewhere."
574319,straydog,2008-05-26 15:06:00,11,"Use your duty free allowance on ""spirits"" and pay the duty on beer from home. I paid $11.29 per case at home last year and another $8 or $9 duty which made the beer half what it is in Ontario. You MUST have your reciept! I don't know how many cases one person could bring, but 2 of us brought 8 cases last year. My Canadian friends appreciated it. They do pay $40/per case."
574320,Guest,2008-05-26 15:41:00,0,"I've searched for a site that has official duty rates for beer, but have not had any luck. Anyone know where I can get this info?"
574322,Guest,2008-05-26 17:35:00,0,"Lask week at Pigeon River crossing south of Thunder Bay, 24 cans of Coors Light from the duty free at Rydens was $17.00 US and the duty and taxes at the border was $12.00 CDN. $29.00 compared to $44.50 for 24 cans in Ontario with deposit on cans? You do the math! Bring lots, just don't drink and drive, and if you have a DUI then get ready for a long wait at the border if they even let you in."
574337,Guest,2008-05-27 12:01:00,0,"i had a owi almost 7 years ago. they let me in with no problem in 2004, but are they getting harder now? does anyone know if i will be able to get through or just take a little longer while they think about it? thanks for the help"
574349,Guest,2008-05-27 19:43:00,0,"They are most definitely getting tougher on letting people with any sort of alcohol-related offense in! Do your research first! You can apply for an exemption (forgot what they call it, officially), but you have to get it WELL in advance, it costs $200 to apply, and there are no guarantees that they'll give you one. However, they state that without one, and if you have a DUI, OUI, DWI, etc., they won't let you in. ""Members of Inadmissible Classes include those who have been convicted of MINOR OFFENCES (including shoplifting, theft, assault, dangerous driving, unauthorized possession of a firearm, possession of illegal substances, etc.), or of INDICTABLE CRIMINAL OFFENCES (including assault with a deadly weapon, manslaughter, etc.). As well, those who have been convicted of DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED (DWI) are considered Members of an Inadmissible Class. Driving while under the influence of alcohol is regarded as an extremely serious offence in Canada. ""Those who have received TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS (including parking/speeding tickets, etc.) and other minor violations (i.e. littering, etc.) most likely will NOT be prohibited from entering Canada. Similarly, those who have JUVENILE CONVICTIONS (convictions for crimes committed while under age 18) most likely will NOT be prohibited from entering Canada unless they could have been tried as an adult for their offences."" and... ""The Inadmissible status can be removed, after a period of many years, by applying for a Minister's Approval of Rehabilitation. Although, you can visit Canada before the Inadmissible status is removed. This requires you apply for a Temporary Resident Permit. The Temporary Resident Permit allows you to visit Canada for a single purpose or for a limited period. This process requires completion of forms and paying fees."""
