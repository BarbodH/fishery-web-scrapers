574224,Goldeneagle,2008-05-22 22:37:00,78,"Enid, I stopped by to thank you in person last Friday, but missed you. We made it to Little Vermilion when a wind shift moved ice from the dock area. Fishing is outstanding."
574609,Goldeneagle,2008-06-03 06:50:00,78,"This message board weaved magic as I was able to pick up Skylane and Ms Skylane in Dryden to take them to their other place in Illinois. Having an extra driver on a good part of a 1500 mile drive was helpful, especially after spending 15 days on the water in NW Ontario. Thanks Walleye Central."
573796,Goldeneagle,2008-05-11 12:09:00,78,Thanks. You're helping a lot.
573803,Guest,2008-05-11 15:13:00,0,"Has anyone flown over Trout Lake? Since it is so deep, I think it's probably one of the last lakes to lose the ice."
573817,Minnow Man,2008-05-11 20:30:00,85,This afternoon had a north wind & the bay in front of Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake is now 90% ice free. Just a little slush ice left in one corner of the bay. Stoney Bay is 100% ice free. It's great to see open water again. Will put a boat in the water tomorrow & check out the ice conditions on the main lake. It will be ice free for the opener of walleye season.
573819,Guest,2008-05-11 21:31:00,0,"GOOD NEWS!! Craig came back tonight from flying up north!! He called us from the dock at Orono Lake and could have landed at Rheaume. These lakes are 100 miles north of Red Lake. He could have landed at Domain and Optic. Douglas was beginning to open up. These lakes are to the west of Red Lake in Woodland Caribou Park. So..... fishing is a go for opening weekend!! There may still be a few lakes that may be a problem but most will be fine!!! yeah!! Call your outfitter, he will know finally what to expect. Enid"
573872,Goldeneagle,2008-05-14 04:33:00,78,Thanks for putting up with personal messages on this thread by Skylane and me. Our computers have become friendlier and we're now hooked up with some e-mail addresses that work. Earlier this board was our only way to communicate. Thanks.
573881,Guest,2008-05-14 09:45:00,0,"No problem Goldeneagle, just trying this out myself, just a way to get info out on ice and such, and seems to work. You made my stuff look very popular, neat."
574002,Guest,2008-05-17 17:02:00,0,"There are a few ice flows blowing around on Howey Bay, but I'd say the ""ICE IS OUT"". The planes are flying. Greens have their planes at their dock in Howey Bay and there will be more there tomorrow. OH Yes it is fishing season."
574014,Guest,2008-05-18 09:51:00,0,"Tons of thanks to Amik Outposts, Brett's Sportmens Lodge, Larry Herbert, Chukuni River Trailer Park, and everyone who lives near the bridge at Chukuni River for helping all the fly-in outfitters get things going this spring!!! All the docks were in full use and everyone was very helpful."
574070,Guest,2008-05-20 11:17:00,0,Is there still ice on Red Lake?
574076,Guest,2008-05-20 12:05:00,0,"Yes, there is still a bit of ice floating around Howey Bay. However on Sunday, Dan Baughman from Bow Narrows Camp on the west end of Red Lake was able to go by boat all the way from camp to Howey Bay. I see quite a few fishermen out fishing on Red Lake this week. A bit cold but it is supposed to warm up and be sunny all week."
573718,Skylane,2008-05-08 19:09:00,101,"I talked to my wife this evening on the phone, she is at our place on the lake east of Dryden, and predicted the ice would go off the lake tonight or tomorrow. We'll see how good her prediction is."
573731,Skylane,2008-05-09 10:46:00,101,Ice went out on our lake last night May 8th.
573736,Goldeneagle,2008-05-09 11:38:00,78,"Skylane, when will you be on the water up there. I could pick up one guy (without too much gear) next Wednesday for the ride to Dryden."
573749,Skylane,2008-05-09 17:47:00,101,"Goldeneagle, Where are you departing from and what is your route going up. Please e-mail me; sriggins at cell1net.net Thanks"
573757,Goldeneagle,2008-05-10 07:53:00,78,I sent an e-mail yesterday. CI
573767,Skylane,2008-05-10 13:20:00,101,"Goldeneagle, I did not get your e-mail but did just send you one. If you do not get it, try the e-mail address I put on the last post, as the other one is not current."
573768,Goldeneagle,2008-05-10 14:05:00,78,"Sorry, I left out ""net"" before the . trying again."
573777,Goldeneagle,2008-05-10 19:35:00,78,Sent two from two different addresses. Have received none from you. No new word on ice conditions. Hoping to leave Wednesday and fly in Friday.
573779,freespoolin,2008-05-10 21:45:00,472,"Talked to a Lodge owner in Red Lake tonight (Saturday May 10). He said there was 10"" of ice on Red Lake and didn't expect it to go until late next week. he is moving guests around who are booked for May 17."
573795,Guest,2008-05-11 11:49:00,0,Ice is going quickly now. Seems to be melting in place. We will be able to fly into some lakes at end of this week. Going flying soon and will report what we see.
573452,freespoolin,2008-05-03 15:50:00,472,Hugh as in former mayor Hugh?
573462,Guest,2008-05-03 23:13:00,0,yup
573470,freespoolin,2008-05-04 13:51:00,472,"We were speaking with Jake the retired flyer who lives on Skookum Bay on Red Lake, says it still ice covered today Sunday May 4."
573471,Minnow Man,2008-05-04 13:54:00,85,"Decided to check ice conditions on Red Lake this morning, while at Rahill Beach noticed that the ice was starting to move and pile up, this lasted for several minutes, when the west wind died down so did the ice movement. Lake ice is starting to move, it's a good sign."
573504,Guest,2008-05-05 10:46:00,0,Hi Mitch Did u buy a new pro v?
573566,Guest,2008-05-06 14:20:00,0,Any new news on ice? Is it black? Is there still snow on it? I see by forecast weather is mild with cold nights.
573569,Guest,2008-05-06 15:32:00,0,"Yes things are looking much better. Still cold at night, but the sun has melted the snow and is working on the ice now. The ice is still up to the shore and hasn't turned black yet. However it is weak and quite thin....finally. Check pictures on blog.www.viking-island.blogspot.com If you are going fishing the first week of the season, May 17, you may want to call your outfitter and check on your lake."
573689,Guest,2008-05-08 12:23:00,0,"well, still ice right to the shores of most lakes. Several planes parked at the bridge, all dressed up and nowhere to go!! the ice is starting to turn black. We'll be flying on Sunday to see what's happening up north from here. Enid"
573705,joeman79,2008-05-08 15:14:00,417,"saw forecast for next 3 days was high of 48 f. thats not gonna melt much ice very fast, especially with temps in 20's at nite. But at least it's turning black."

573144,Guest,2008-04-26 15:54:00,0,leave your boat at home and bring the snowmachine and Ice auger
573146,Guest,2008-04-27 08:28:00,0,I've seen it iced up to the 3d week of May. In 96 we were dodging ice on the opener.
573147,Guest,2008-04-27 08:30:00,0,Oh...I thought we'd invite Al Gore out for the opener this year. I got some questions on the global warming theory.
573148,Guest,2008-04-27 09:10:00,0,"You jest about Global Warming, but surely you all know that it is the cause of the current winter blast. When it rains - that's Global Warming, too. Sleet - Global Warming. Light breeze and sunshine - Global Warming. Chilly May mornings - yep - Global Warming."
573149,Guest,2008-04-27 11:48:00,0,"4 weeks till fishing Gullrock? You're good. Opening weekend is May 17. For 2 years in a row, sometime in the 90's, the ice was still on Howey Bay for the opening weekend, but you could fish on Gullrock: just navigate around a few patches of ice. So you'll be fine. Plan on some lake trout fishing as they should be on surface while the water remains cold. I'll keep my blog up to date for ice on Howey Bay. http://viking-island.blogspot.com/ Enid"
573186,Guest,2008-04-28 14:28:00,0,"Right on Tony, I wish you were Santa Claus and drop one off on my dock...lol I'll definately look at this one when you trade up again. Man did we get the ultimate snow dump this weekend. This will put us back a week on the ice leaving, my new pro V prediction will be the 14 of May ICE OUT.... And that's hoping for some HOT weather.....[email protected] Mista W"
573444,Guest,2008-05-03 09:38:00,0,"I checked the local weather, now I bet you'll have to push out your date! My family goes to Boois May 31st. They have already cancelled their opening weekend guests. Usually two weeks after opener is safe, now, not so sure!"
573446,Guest,2008-05-03 10:32:00,0,You really should be fine for May 31 - two weeks after opening weekend.
573449,Guest,2008-05-03 12:45:00,0,"Hugh flew on flotas from Selkirk to Red Lake today. He saw water only at Great Falls in Manitoba and at the Chukuni River here! The ice is right to the shore with snow dirfts!! Weather still cold. Breakup WILL be late. Opening week is in question for the deep lakes, I think."
573450,Goldeneagle,2008-05-03 13:11:00,78,Heading to Little Vermilion May 16 and don't expect problems. Hopefully we'll make it on winged aircraft. Hope wind doesn't have ice blocking the camp.
572963,Guest,2008-04-19 10:16:00,0,Maybe he ws trying to write COLD Cold is expected this week.
572964,ebuhr,2008-04-19 10:46:00,20,"LOL! duh, that makes sense. I was thinking ""Clear Of Ice Day"" or something. Thanks, i feel kinda silly."
573038,Guest,2008-04-21 22:42:00,0,LOL Cold COLD
573043,Guest,2008-04-22 07:26:00,0,Hey mista walleye got my new Ranger in the garage look out lol.Thanx for entering us in Red lake
573047,Guest,2008-04-22 08:44:00,0,"Last night rain, 32 degrees right now. Below freezing nights till Monday! As it looks now spawn will be later."
573068,Enid Elizabeth,2008-04-23 12:11:00,59,There was only 2 feet of ice when we drilled today. The ice is candled and weak. Looking good. Hoping for warm weather. Enid:D
573081,Guest,2008-04-24 11:02:00,0,i guess we expected another dump of snow. pretty outside but darn! Enid
573099,Guest,2008-04-25 08:49:00,0,"Snow and rain yesterday, were making ice it's 26 degrees F right now."
573142,Guest,2008-04-26 15:11:00,0,"not a good day to talk ""ice out date"" Roads closed to the south. Maybe 10 inches on the ground and still snowing."
573143,Tonyo,2008-04-26 15:33:00,212,"SOOO, what is the latest you guys have seen the ice go out? I'm not worried with Global Warming in all but it seems a little difficult to get the ice off the water if you are getting another 10-12"" of snow today. Glad I'm in the middle of missouri where we are enjoying 63 degrees with a light breeze. The only problem is we have touble with any quality walleye fishing at Lake of the Ozarks. Hope for warm temps, light rain and some wind to help you guys out. 4 weeks to go until a week on Gullrock, not that I'm counting. Tony"
572842,Enid Elizabeth,2008-04-14 11:39:00,59,"Mid-April and still lots of snow in the bush and on the lakes. Ice fishing still fine. I plan to post updates on how the Spring Thaw is going here. Predictions on ""Ice Out of Howey Bay"" vary but most think LATE. http://viking-island.blogspot.com/"
572858,Pooch,2008-04-14 17:30:00,4619,Enjoyed the link and update of Red Lake. There seems to be more Red Lake area folks on this board than years ago. Or maybe all of you are coming out of the closet! Thanks Elizabeth. Pooch
572884,stevensinks,2008-04-15 11:35:00,330,We are going to Bow Narrows the second week of june. We have never gone this earlly and we have never been to Red Lake. So I will be keeping a close eye on your site. Thanks
572888,Enid Elizabeth,2008-04-15 12:51:00,59,The second week of June is the most popular time to go fishing around here. Walleye are back to their usual haunts and the lake trout are not too deep yet. You will find Bow Narrows friendly and great and you will find Red Lake to be beautiful. The boat trip up the lake is a great way to start a trip. Dan and Brenda will be checking with me too to find out when they can get to camp.
572892,Goldeneagle,2008-04-15 19:05:00,78,"Thanks for the ice information Elizabeth. I'll be taking off at the Chukuni River Bridge May 16. Left from the same spot on May 17, 2002 when most of Red Lake was covered with old ice, with fresh ice around the edges. October 8, 2005 my party was flown back from Sportsman's by a beauty with CF-FQ1 on the tail."
572937,Guest,2008-04-18 10:25:00,0,"Well Folks, Another season is upon us, the sky is blue and the snow has left.
