Smittys or Four Season Sport Shop have been great for leeches, I'm not sure about the other items, but they are both full service bait shops. We order leeches before we leave and pick them up on the way. Hope this helps."

574494,stumcfar,2008-05-30 13:50:00,451,"Rose, you are right, they are great people, but they still are Packer fans. Maybe with Favre gone, we can now convert them."
574511,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-05-30 20:27:00,116,"HEY, I'm a Packer fan too! I bet your from Mn?"
