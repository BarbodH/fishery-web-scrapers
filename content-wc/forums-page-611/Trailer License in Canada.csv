There's a pretty good chance you'll get pulled over at some point on your trip if you don't have a license plate visible. It's not really a problem, providing the officer is understanding, up on the regs, and having a good day, but why take that chance? You'll have to deal with the delay and hassle of being pulled over, explaining the registration system in WI, waiting for the officer to verify an out of country vehicle registration, etc... Not only that, but who knows what else he may find to ticket you for that he would never have noticed had he not pulled you over? Seems like a royal pain in the butt to me. Like I said, I'd get a plate and just avoid the situation altogether. Waxy"

574622,Fish_on,2008-06-03 12:23:00,1856,"Got the plate for my new boat in 2006 but forgot to put it on. Went across the border in Ontario four times (and back) in 2006 and 2007 before I realized that the plate had never been installed, it was sitting in the corner of my office. Even got checked at a border crossing stop where they inspect your boat trailer for exotic vegetation, TWICE. No one ever said a word about the fact that I didn't have a license on the trailer. Fished the FLW tour last year, fished a few other tournaments and traveled to fish quite a bit, all without a license on the boat trailer. Just put the plate on the other day when I got the renewal stickers and went to put them on... there was no plate to stick them to. Gettin' old I guess."
574626,Waxy,2008-06-03 13:52:00,2938,"Well, you guys should count yourselves lucky as far as I'm concerned. I prefer to err on the side of caution when it comes to things like this, but to each his own. Not only is having the trailer plated the law in Canada (not for WI residents obviously), but not having a plate usually attracts plenty of attention with the number of stolen boats and trailers out there. It gives the officer probable cause to pull you over for inspection. Looks like the OPP are maybe a little more lax in their enforcement than the RCMP and local city cops are out here in AB and SK. Even the fish and wildlife officers are likely to hassle you a bit if your boat and trailer aren't properly registered, no plate, etc... I've been stopped a couple times over the years for not having a plate, never anything major, but a pain in the butt nonetheless. Good luck to you all, and hopefully you won't have any unneccesary or negative encounters with law enforcement. They tend to ruin an otherwise great trip. Waxy"

Any fellow cheesehead ever haul a trailer across the border without a license tag on the trailer? Or, is it best to bite the bullet and get a plate? Any hassles at the border? Crossing at Grand Portage in 1 week. Many thanks for any help."
574518,Bill Krejca,2008-05-31 10:17:00,6107,"I never had them look. One year it fell off before I crossed the border and it wasn't an issue. They do check out the vehicle plate, tho."

574556,dave10,2008-06-02 09:15:00,342,"MB - I'm risk averse, and got my trailer plated before I left Wisconsin. Strictly peace of mind - I was never stopped or questioned about them in three trips. Dave"
574557,stumcfar,2008-06-02 09:58:00,451,"Speaking of trailers, do you need safety chains with a clasp or is an S-hook legal in Ontario? The border says S-hooks are fine, but it seems there was discussion on here once before that they need to be the type that snap shut. I tried searching here for that info, but couldn't find anything."
574569,Guest,2008-06-02 12:55:00,0,"The border may not be an issue, but the provincial police could fine you for not having a licenced and plated trailer."
574573,Roger Benoit,2008-06-02 13:30:00,93,The police will not ticket you if a plate is not required where it is registered... Thats like saying that if someone from alberta comes to manitoba they will get a ticket for not having a front plate. In manitoba you get 2 plates...and they must be on the vehicle.... Lets get the FACTS straight!.
574579,dave10,2008-06-02 14:43:00,342,"Good point, Roger, but I wasn't sure how familiar the OPP would be with Wisconsin law. Thus, I followed the ""when in Rome"" adage. On the snap versus S-hook, the last time I checked the Ontario regulations on line, the snap was recommended, not required. Again, I got the snaps only to be sure, and they are safer, IMHO. Dave"

From what I read, no facts were stated. He said that the police ""could""........ I don't think the police would be very familiar with the "" home "" rules of each and every state and province."
574584,Flip Silverlake,2008-06-02 16:47:00,645,"Wisconsin requires any trailer with a capacity over 3000 pounds to have brakes and a plate. Any trailer under 3000 pounds brakes or plate is not required. The law in Ontairo is based on where the trailer is kept, so if plates are not required in Wisconsin they are not required in Ontairo. I've been pulling a boat trailer up there since the early 70's with out plates and have NEVER been stopped. You might be suprised on what the OPP knows when they see your vehicle plate. As far as the ""S"" hook you need to get one of those things that will prevent the ""S"" hook from falling out."
