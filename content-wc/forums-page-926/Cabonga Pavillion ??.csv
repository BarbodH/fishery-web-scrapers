I would like to get into some good pike action as well as walleye. Troll, jig, drift?? Any help will be appreciated."

I called a couple of weeks ago and the res. was 11 1/2 feet high but was starting to drop. If it is still very high, it's going to be tough finding the scattered walleye. Have you been there before?"

I haven't caught a pike since I was up there. Can't wait. We are staying at some cabins, the name I do not know, maybe we will see you up there. Good luck.gb"
