523782,Guest,2002-08-27 18:03:00,0,"Hi,We just got back from Minaki about 2 hours ago, it was great, people were great and customers were very friendly, we caught alot of walleyes in Big Sand, 12 miles up there but worth it when we got there. We fished Gunn Lake also, my first cast was a 43 inch Northern, so I thought fishing was great. The water has gone down 4 feet. Food was wonderful in the lodge. It was our first time up there and we rated it high and we will go back.pikelady"

523784,Swede811,2002-08-27 20:38:00,32,Wondering the same thing myself - do we plan to run to Big Sand every day or will Little Sand and Gun be producing some fish.
523785,Guest,2002-08-28 06:29:00,0,"Good Morning!!!We stayed at Paradise Cove 2, and we ran to Big Sand 2 of the 4 days we were up there, fished Gunn the other one and didn't fish the 4th.The Walleyes are suspended, but we found some nice ones (21 to 24 inchers) in 27 to 40 feet with a plain hook and a crawler, some other people were using a plain hook and a leech. We fished right to the North end of Big Sand, West of the Sand Beach and about a l00 yards west of the little island up there, started in 27 feet and drifted to 45 feet. I guess some were trolling in the deeper areas but we never did. Alot were using down riggers and some were using plainer boards, we just used plain hooks and crawlers and did allright. We talked to some guys that fished little Sand and caught some walleyes but they were smaller. Smallmouth were hitting along with the Walleyes.pikelady"
