523814,IaDave,2002-08-27 14:30:00,476,"I have gone to Albany River Outfitters twice. We always went to Lake Otaskwin and the fishing there was fantastic. The cabin was small but OK. At that time there was no shower but I understand he put in a solar shower. I know 2 groups of guys who went to Bow Lake. They said the fishing was great. I know there is a new cabin there with indoor bathroom and shower. Jerrell is a very nice guy but not too ambitious. He normally lets you stay at the base camp the nite before you fly out which we always did. I wouldn't hesitate to book with him,we quit going there because of the driving distance for us. That and the fact some of us bought new Lunds and we fish Lake Minnitaki."
523815,eyewitness,2002-08-28 19:33:00,680,"Fished Otoskawin in 86' and it was great fishing! Four of us then proceeded down the river in canoes for 40 miles and three days. It was fun, but the owner of Albany at that time didn't prepare us for that trip at all and we almost died. It was a near disaster that rivals some of the stories you would read in Readers Digest.....Did you find the Burial ground up the river a bit?"

523818,phishfearme,2002-08-29 08:21:00,1242,IaDave - thanks for the input - jerrel does sound like a great guy. looks like we're gonna book there for next july - we looked at otoswin lake also but it was booked but it seem bow would offer similar fishing as it's just downstream abit. there's a shower and hot/cold running water at the upgraded bow cabin now. and it IS a long drive - especially from PA.phish
523817,phishfearme,2002-08-29 08:24:00,1242,eyewitness - i'm curious also as we're considering having a canoe flown in for our 10 day trip at bow and go down or up the otoswin river. i've river tripped the albany twice before and assumed that the otoskwin would be somewhat similar. what happened?phish
