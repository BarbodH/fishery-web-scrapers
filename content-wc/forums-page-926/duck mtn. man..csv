522993,Guest,2002-07-28 18:36:00,0,"Kinda hard not to find good fishing in the ducksWellman has rebounded well for walleye from all the work of a variety of sports groups in the area.Wellman has a well kept government campsite with showers and most amenities and a lodge available nerby for any supplies. They are also very helpful in pointing out the top producing lakes at the time.For trout, two mile and east blue can produce some good fishing. Best part of the ducks is if one lake isnt producing just a short distance away you can be fishing for almost any kind of species in another lake close bye. The adventure is in all the different lakes and types of fishing available. Visit the Travel Manitoba web site and check out the stocking lists for lakes that may have also been stocked.WWwww.walleyewarrior.com"

Good pike fishing at the north end along the weed beds. Excellent camp grounds. Another good stop is Laurie lake, about three miles down the road, smaller lakers but usually plenty of action. Just before dark long line with rapala's for some nice browns."

Went to Line Lake and caught a small Muskie, as well as a bunch of Pike. Never fished Wellman, though. Hear that East Blue Lake has lots of big fish. Fishing Laurie Lake, I think my dad caught the world's smallest laker. Lots of good camping in the Ducks."
