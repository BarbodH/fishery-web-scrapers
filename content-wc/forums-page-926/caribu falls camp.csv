523714,Dryfly,2002-08-26 07:50:00,58,"If this is the Caribou Falls Lodge on Tetu Lake, I just got back yesterday from Tetu Lake Lodge. We spent a lot of time fishing the sandbar by Caribou Lodge, the flat just south of the lodge and the spillway at the Caribou Falls dam. We did very well at these three locations, with many fish 21"" and over. Our biggest walleye was 25.5"" and our biggest northern was 42"". We caught our big northerns on jigs on the sandbar in the morning. We had a few big northerns hit walleyes we wer reeling in. Presentations we used were jig(blue, chartreuse, white, and orange & yellow combo) and minnow early in the morning at the sandbar and later in the day at the spillway. We would switch to bottom bouncers with spinners and crawlers around nine o'clock. Most of our better fish were on the spinners. We did pull some reef runners(bubble gum) in the afternoons and caught some nice fish. Hope this helps."
