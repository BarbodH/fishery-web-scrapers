Would appreciate some info: What color pattern and size jig should we use? What works best for live bait, minnows (size), leeches? It would be nice to catch a ""wall hanger"" but we are really looking for the 16-17"" eaters. What depths are we looking at for this time of year? What type of structure should we be looking for, weeds, humps? When is the best time, early morning, midday, late afternoon, evening? Do people do any trolling with bottom bouncers and crankbaits this time of year? Does any sport shop in Sioux Narrows or Kenora have a GOOD map of the Lake?We realize that this lake is noted as more of a trophy lake rather than a numbers lake, but as stated earlier, we would prefer to catch walleyes to eat for the most part.Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated."

I personally caught only 28 walleyes on my last trip end of July and 14 of them were over 26"". The lake is difficult at times. Fish all wind blown points. there are no real good maps of the lake. The resort has maps for free. There are at least four dozen reefs that are not marked on the map, so it is difficult to fish.Stick with a split shot rig, slip bobbers, and the occasional crank. The big fish will bite if they are on the bite or spot you are fishing. We bump around a lot on the lake and keep hitting the same spots all day. We had guys catch no fish on a spot and then some guys catch two over 28"" on the same spot 15 minutes later. The big ones move in and out all day. Let me know how it goes. If you want eaters Kilvert maybe a better way to go. Everytime we have been in there lots of 15-18"" fish."
