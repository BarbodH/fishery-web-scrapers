523768,Guest,2002-08-26 07:18:00,0,Just saw a news story about the lead posioning in are area lakes! They showed a loon diving down to the bottom picking up gravel and swallowing a jig head and later dying on the shore! What is the alternative to lead this story really got to me!

523771,Guest,2002-08-26 13:34:00,0,"If the Loon swallowed a lead jig and then died shortly thereafter, I think it was because of the hook not lead poisoning. I studied aquatic toxicology in college and I would think that a solid chunk of lead would have a more long term effect rather than be acutely toxic. Anyone know otherwise?"
523772,Guest,2002-08-27 10:58:00,0,I think the news story jig head was talking about shows the long term effect of lead poising. They were just showing how a loon picks up gravel from the bottom of the lake to help chew its food and it happened to swallow a lead jig. The loon on shore happened to have a broken pelvis and they checked it for lead poising!
