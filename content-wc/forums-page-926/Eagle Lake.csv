523742,Guest,2002-08-25 11:21:00,0,Does anyone know how the muskies on Eagle Lake are biting? Also what is the best way to catch walleyes on this lake? I do alot of open water trolling here in Wisconsin what depths is the best to work if the fish are supended and whats the most common crank do they troll with on that lake. We are going up there for Vacation next week so any info would be greatly appreciated Thanks!

Give me your email address and I'll give you some hints\ on spots and techniques. I fished the Portage Bay, Viking Reef, Barber Pole reef areas. I fished the north portion by Temple Bay. As for Muskies, the water temp is still high enough for topwater plugs. catchNrelease"
