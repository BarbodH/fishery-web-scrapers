523690,Guest,2002-08-23 05:03:00,0,Been fishing Canada Walleyes for three years and I dont know if it is just the air or the excitment but it seems Canada Walleye fight harder than Minnesota Walleye. Is this just my imagination or does anybody else agree....and if so why does this seem to occur?
523691,stumcfar,2002-08-23 05:26:00,451,"I'm not sure why the walleyes fight more, but they definately do. I normally fish LOW and the walleyes were much more fun to tangle with in Lac Seul than the walleyes on the southern end of LOW."
523692,Guest,2002-08-23 13:09:00,0,Stronger Beer=Stronger Walleye. Also they run a tough weight program north of the boarded.
523693,Walleye Wacker,2002-08-23 17:01:00,6,I have fished plenty of times in both Canada and the 48 states. I think its also worth mentioning that river Walleyes are stronger fighters than lake eyes. I dont know for sure but my theory on Canada Walleye is that they are better fighters because they have more competition for food and they have a shorter forage time than their southren cousins. I have gone to the North regions of Canada and eyes are really aggressive fighters in that water. I also theorize that when you are sitting over top of structure and catching 200 Canadian Walleye in a couple of hours there are hundreds more down there and that makes competion furious. I havent been on a piece of structure like that in the states for years....
523694,Guest,2002-08-26 12:03:00,0,I've fish alot of Minnesota waters and some Canadian. I think part of the reason is Evolution. Walleyes in Minnesota and the lower 48 for the most part have been caught and released over and over for long time and have evolved to accept it as a part of nature. In Canada most lakes and fish have not been pressured like they are here so basically it's a new experience. Well 2 days to Ontario-Dragon.
523695,Guest,2002-08-26 18:21:00,0,Canadian Walleye are a harder fighting fish no doubt about it. They are like the Canadian Walleye fisherman a superior species.
523696,Guest,2002-08-26 18:57:00,0,"Canadian Guy, Do Canadian Walleyes have large egos too...or are they just legends in their own minds?? I have fished with several Canadian Walleye hunters and they do know their stuff about Walleye catching but when it comes to playing poker and drinking beer they need more practice."
523697,Guest,2002-08-26 19:18:00,0,You must have been fishing and partying with a couple of the apprentices ............Oh you are right we do have inflated egos....goes along with catching lots and lots of nice walleye
523698,Guest,2002-08-26 19:45:00,0,"Canadian Guy, They were amateurs at partying...but they knew what ledges held the eyes...egos KINGSIZE...but no aces in the hole and ice all melted in their drinks."
523699,Guest,2002-08-27 03:43:00,0,No Aces and melted ice in the drinks...hmmm....you're right Andrew.....they are a national embarassment....
