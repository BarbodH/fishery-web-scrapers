523071,Guest,2002-08-05 17:28:00,0,Hello BudI read your post about keeping your schedule the week the same and I just want to say thanks. It really works well for our group since we stay in Dryden on Friday night and then come in on Saturday. Next year we are looking to stay in Vermillion Bay on Friday instead. Why this is so nice for us is we are not tired from Driving all night to get to camp. I also noticed for the last couple of years that the border is not so backed up either.By the way did Melinda receive my email about our reservation?ThanksJeff Jasinski
523072,Guest,2002-08-05 19:03:00,0,I would recommend Northside motel in Vermillion Bay. Nice facilities and reasonable
523073,Guest,2002-08-06 06:31:00,0,"oops- sorry I used your name, brain-fart. The restaurant on the north side of the highway, with the gas station is very good for supper and breakfast and as i said northside motel is great."
523068,Guest,2002-08-06 07:43:00,0,John was that the time both of Mike's generators went on the blink Mike had a hard time that week. I did buy a camp that year on Cliff lake it took 3 more years to find one on Gullrock. Don't think I'll leave here.
523069,Guest,2002-08-06 09:30:00,0,"Bud- now that you mention it, I think it was the next wek he had all of the trouble. How did your son's education turn out, I know that was a big concern. I am an elementary principal and spoke to your wife. I know she had some big concerns."
523074,Guest,2002-08-06 10:33:00,0,"Bud,Hope the fishing is still decent next week. Sounds like the weather is a little up and down, and will continue into next week when I'm there (10th through 17th). Weather.com says rain and 70's next week. Really looking forward to it!Paul"
523070,SandPaper,2002-08-27 07:53:00,31,"Bud,Is this cliff lake by eagle lake? We are planning a trip next week and were looking for some information on cliff lake?Thanks,James"
523058,VANT,2002-07-29 04:10:00,68,"WE ARE LEAVING FOR GULLROCK THIS FRIDAY, 8/2. HOW AND WHERE ARE THE FISH BITING? BOTH WALLEYE AND NORTHERN. HOW ARE THE WATER LEVELS? SOME FRIENDS OF MINE WERE THERE IN JUNE AND SAID THE LAKE WAS WAY UP AND THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF DEBRIS FLOATING. I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE WATER HAS GONE DOWN AND SOMEWHAT CLEANED UP. THEY SAID GULL ROCK WAS MARKED WITH A MILK JUG. TWO TO THREE FEET UNDER WATER. CAN'T WAIT TO GET THERE. I NEED THE VACATION. THANKS."
523059,Guest,2002-07-29 11:27:00,0,"I was there in June, last week. Clay banks, and around the entrance to Ranger. Lake was up and debris everywhere. By now i would think that the fish would be in there normal pattern.where do you stay?"
523060,VANT,2002-07-29 16:12:00,68,"JOHN,WE STAY AT MCEWEN'S ON TWO ISLAND. THIS WILL BE MY FOURTH TRIP UP THERE WITH PRETTY MUCH THE SAME BUNCH OF GUYS. A COUPLE GUYS WILL DROP OUT & A COUPLE NEW GUYS COME ALONG. YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES. WE PRETTY MUCH GO UP THE SAME TIME OF THE YEAR. I AM JUST CURIOUS HOW THINGS ARE UP THERE NOW, WITH THE FUNNY SPRING & EARLLY SUMMER WE HAD HERE & UP THERE ALSO. I ASSUME THINGS WILL PRETTY MUCH BE BACK TO NORMAL AND THE FISH WILL BE IN NORMAL PATTERNS, BUT IT NEVER HURTS TO ASK. ARE YOU THE SAME JOHN WHO HAS BEEN GOING BACK & FORTH WITH JEFF ON AN EARLIER POST HERE? WILL POST A REPORT AFTER WE GET BACK. THANKS."
523061,Guest,2002-07-29 16:40:00,0,"Yes, I am. This year was my 13th at Gull Rock. Stay at Weavers. Have a great trip"
523062,Guest,2002-07-30 11:17:00,0,"VantI am the Jeff who was massagiing with John. The one post was from Bud owner of Five Lakes Lodge. When I left 7/20 walleyes were moving onto mid lake structure in 14-18ft off rock piles. By now they should definately be where you expect them to be. We hit the mayfly hatch when I was there 7/13-7/20, I fished hard and personally boated about 350 walleye for the week which I thought was off a bit but it still beats the US fishing. I would imagine you will get into many throw backs when you are up there as well.Best of luck fishingJeff"
523063,Guest,2002-08-03 09:37:00,0,"MID LAKE STRUCTURE AND THE GULLROCK ARE ON, ALSO KEG LAKE 15-30 FT. DID ANYBODY HEAR IF WEAVER'S AND POPULAR POINT ARE GOING TO CHECK IN ON SAT. AND CHECK OUT FRI. MORNING?"
523064,Guest,2002-08-03 14:33:00,0,Hey BudI have been massaging with Malinda we are coming up 7/26 next year. I assuming the big fish will be biting? I have given Paul Schuette some spots when he comes up next week 8/10. They are pretty excited about fishing the Gullrock.Jeff
523065,Guest,2002-08-04 07:59:00,0,Bud: Mike Weaver told me that next year we will be allowed to check in on Friday@8:00 and depart the next Friday morning.
523066,Guest,2002-08-05 07:30:00,0,John thanks for your reply we been having people stopping in from Weaver's and saying the same thing but didn't know if was true or not.We have been asked to do the same the other camps (Sat. to Fri.) on the lake but we don't plan on it.So many of our people leave on Friday now why rock the boat.
523067,Guest,2002-08-05 08:29:00,0,"It won't make much difference to me, because I leave on Friday anyway. I think (and I am guilty of this) that Mike is seeing more and more people showing up early on Saturday and doesn't give him or staff time to get everything done.FYI- i met you and your wife the year before you came to Canada. I was staying at Weavers and you stopped in. You had just sold your home and business and were looking to locate."
