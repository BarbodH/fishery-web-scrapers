523767,Guest,2002-08-26 15:26:00,0,"thanks guys. the castaic seems a no brainer, since i seem to always be the one running the boat, watching the depth finder, etc. i need 3 or 4 hands and it will eliminate the need for 1 of them. i have looked at those bass pro rods and they look pretty good for the price. i've got 1 about an hour from me. think i'll go down there this week. again, thanks"
