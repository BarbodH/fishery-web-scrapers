I'm sure that some people do have problems, and our three rigs were lucky, but it was so nice. The girl working even smiled and chatted. After telling her twice that I had a case of beer to pay duty on she just said ""thank you, have a nice trip."" She asked the usual questions, but didn't even ask for ID. We crossed at about 5:30 on a friday night.Coming back through Thunderbay the US guy was just as pleasent. I was ready to move on and he wanted to chat about our fishing trip.All in all, it couldn't have been nicer."

She checked our licenses and then sent us to the inspection area where they went through the truck and the boat. We had nothing to delcare but it was a delay we could have done without. I purposely buy my beer in Ear Falls to negate any problems at the border, maybe now I will start taking it across.Comming back on 8/24 there was a 1 & 1/2 hour wait to get back across. No problems, but they were taking their time talking to people and it was really backed up.When we went up in May we breezed through both ways with no delay at all."

They had a half dozen people tearing a car down, 1 guy was using a battery powered drill to open cavitys in the back of the car and then put a fibre-optic probe in the hole and was checking it out!"
523855,Goldfish,2002-08-29 13:29:00,6,We crossed with 3 trucks/boats on 8/23 at about 11:30pm and had no problems.It was the fastest we ever got through.The trip back home was just as pleasant on 8/28 - 5:30pm
