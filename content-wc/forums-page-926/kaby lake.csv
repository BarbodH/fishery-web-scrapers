523762,Guest,2002-08-29 08:39:00,0,"Hey KYL, When you get back post a message or E-mail me at [email protected] and let me know how the fishing was down that way. We were told by one of our guides that the fishing down towards Everson's and Kaby lodge was better than near Pine Portage. Interested to hear. We had great fishing, just no size. Thanks Ross"
