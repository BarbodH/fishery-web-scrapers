In addition to our outpost trip this year, we will be at Abrams Camp during the last week of August/first week of Sept. In past years we have done pretty good fairly close to camp, but would like getting over into Minnetaki(spelling?) more and try for bigger walleye. If I sent you a map would you give me some hotspots for that time of year? I sure would appreciate it. Also email me at [email protected]. I thought I was registered on WC and was going to email you, but WC wouldn't let me in. Would Algona Bay be any good at that time? Marty Moreland alas eyesnatcher"
