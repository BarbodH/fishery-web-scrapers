I fished their in late may and the water level was down five feet from the year before. It made navigating a bit of a challenge. I am headed back up in early June and was wondering if the levels have recovered at all."

538126,Guest,2004-03-12 21:52:00,0,"I do believe though that I read somewhere that the Ministry will keep water levels low again next summer. Supposed to have something to do with working on the dam at Ear Falls. Does anyone have knowledge about this issue? I do know when we up there last summer, July, it was LOW. At least got a look at a few more rocks :) Did not hit any, thank God. Thanks, Lonnie"
538175,Guest,2004-03-15 14:17:00,0,"There is a website maintained by lake of the woods water control board that will allow you to monitor levels in comparison to where they have been historically. The site is www.lwcb.ca and it provides up to date levels, inflows, and outflows on several major basins as well as historical graphs that go back for decades. You can find out what the lake level was the previous year during your trip and then see what to expect for this year. silver eye"
538183,Guest,2004-03-16 00:51:00,0,the best place is below the dam. we spent 6 fdays trying to find the fish then went below the dam and dam thats where they were all the time.!!!!!!!!!!!
538212,czy42strokes,2004-03-17 13:38:00,419,I have heard that the repair work on the dam wasn't finished so they will be dumping more water again this year to finish the work. It made for interesting fishing last season. I saw rocks that I didn't know were there.
