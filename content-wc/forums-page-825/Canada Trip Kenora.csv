537940,Larry S,2004-03-05 06:46:00,666,"Jim, The fly-in is through Northern Outposts,they have 3 camps 175 miles north of Armstrong.I went there last year,the guys I went with have gone there 3 years in a row at all three of there camps.We are going to Dearden Lake again ,which they like the best and caught their biggest and most fish out of the 3 camps. You can portage to 3 other lakes and this year the owner has a brand new portage lake we can go to.When I went there last year I caught hundreds of good sized walleyes 20 to 26 inches and 3 pike over 40 inches. I only spent a half day concentrating on fishing for pike,this year will spend a lot more time on pike.Anyone interested? we still have room left for fishermen on this trip."

The nice part about it is they have 7 or 8 portage lakes that one can go into. A different lake every day of your trip, and not even have to hit Lake of the Woods, but I suggest one day on it for sure. The portage lakes all have excellent smallmouth bass, northern pike. One has walleye, bass, and pike. Naturally you can go on LOTW for walleye, bass, pike muskie too. An ideal location, and excellent operators and operation to boot. Offer American Plan packages, guided or not guided.http://www.crowrock.com"

Planning on coming up to the Kenora area for a week, would either like to find a hotel or a lodge to stay at. We are planning on jumping around and hitting a couple different lakes each day. We will be mostly fishing for eyes but would like to have a nice shore lunch of perch. If anybody has any good suggestions on lodging or lakes it would be greatly appreciated. Will be heading up May 28 to June 6."

537883,fishmaster,2004-03-02 13:38:00,209,Eagle Lake has so much to offer can't understand how you could get bored on a body of water that size. I have fished Eagle since 1977 and have never got bored.

537884,Guest,2004-03-02 14:15:00,0,"I was there the end of May is was 80 to 90 degrees for a high each day, the water temp was 70, the lakers were down deep and would not bite aything i put in front of them. The only place you could catch walleye was at 5th and Broadway, along with evey other boat on the lake. Not to mention the water level was 4 foot lower than normal, could not get to a couple of the areas I fished in previous years. But we did catch some pike and perch. And i also dont care for the rule that you have to be back to your dock before dark. What the heck is that about? I guess all fish must feed heavy at night and they dont want us to catch their fish. Well i'll get off my soapbox. If that sounded like a good time, let me know i'll get you the #."

Do a search on Minaki Lodges, and you will get a hand full of them. If you have some questions about the area, shoot me an e-mail. I understand about the getting back before dark thing. That drove me nuts too. <{{}}><"
