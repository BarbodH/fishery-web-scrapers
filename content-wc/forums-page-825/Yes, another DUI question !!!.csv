538122,hawkeye,2004-03-12 19:25:00,112,"I've read all the DUI post over the past year and called one of the posted Canadian phone #. A lady told me that my friend who got a DUI 14 months was inamissable to Canada and he would have to wait five years to apply for re-entery. I told her I've read you could pay $200. at the border or send $200. for a paper which would allow entery. She said NO, he will have to wait 5 years to apply. This is contary to what I have read here. Help!"

538129,Guest,2004-03-13 03:06:00,0,The worst part about it though is that you could get different answers from different agents. It's hard to get the real deal out of them. It sometimes seems the worst thing to do is phone ahead and ask.
538130,Andre M,2004-03-13 04:15:00,86,There is a link that could be helpful for a better understanding on that matter.http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/can-am/...at=84%&did=397
538134,Guest,2004-03-13 08:54:00,0,After reading that I almost have to think that the criminals in this country have it too easy! I wonder if we have those rules for people coming to our country?
538142,bigfish1965,2004-03-13 23:25:00,3210,Alan its even worse going into the US...(or better dpending on your point of view). 9/11 means every border law is followed where before there was a lot of leeway for the officers.
538144,Stillwater,2004-03-14 03:23:00,87,"Hawkeye, I have a DUI. I talked to a friend who works for the Minnesota Department of Justice and he said you have to talk to Canadian INS, not Customs. Your friend will have to pay $200 (Canadian) each year up until 5 years. Then $200 (total) for years 5 thru 10. Once it's over 10 years old you are considered rehabilitated. If you don't get this pass ahead of time, then just make sure you go through a Customs Station that is also an Immigration Station and has an Immigration official on duty (9 AM to 5 PM). Scott"
538154,Guest,2004-03-14 10:21:00,0,I know this might be the law but. I dont remember in all the years of crossing each way and even lst summer twice being asked for ID. they have the license plate but never any picture id. how do they know you have a dui or anything for that matter? just curious.
538157,Andre M,2004-03-14 15:51:00,86,"Right! I cross the border from Canada to the US quite often on summer. Even if I show my passport they will ask for my driver license and more then that, once after all that the officer ask me if I was working and where, I had to show him my business card; and no I'm not looking strange..."
538159,Guest,2004-03-14 21:53:00,0,"We have been going up to Canada every summer for 10 years. Never been asked for ID or anything other than the standard ""where you going, any live bait, tabacco or booze questions"". One thing new this year is I have heard that all border crossings will have the Gamma x-ray machines before the year is out. If so, it will definitely catch anyone trying anything illegal, such as bringing back too many fish etc. Thanks, Lonnie"
