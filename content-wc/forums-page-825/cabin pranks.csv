I was kinda bad when I was younger and we used to do this while people were partying at their camps but man was it funny seeing a person walking at night with their hand outstretched to grab the handle then they disapear and the stink starts! Roger Mayer."
538164,Techmonster,2004-03-15 06:58:00,66,"WE always go up with a group of six people or so. Two people per boat. Usually the same fishing partners. The boats we get are 14 ft with 15hp 4 stroke that are supper easy to start and run in. By the middle of the week. You get pretty comfortable fishing out of them and you just hop in and go. We run a river with a little bit of current. Secertly we will unplug the fuel line near the gas tank, so there is a little gas in the hose(about 5 ft. We do this on the person that runs the middle of the pact. WE all fire up and go for about 1000yds and his motor will die out of no where. Kinda funny trying to watch them figure out what the #### went wrong. Simple yet entertaing"
538209,MrBor,2004-03-17 13:06:00,5,"Simple prank...a short time before lights out, throw a few pieces of Berkley powerbait catfish chunks in your best friends pillow. It will not stink right away, but will start to permeate the room throughout the night. A good variation we just tried was to put the same smelly stuff under the front seat of your best friends car right before you start the long ride home from Canada. They blamed each other for causing the smell until they figured it out."
538213,czy42strokes,2004-03-17 13:40:00,419,Remind me not to go fishing with you guys. :) Worse thing we have ever done in camp is to set off a few stink bombs now and again. Paybacks can be a #### so we keep things pretty tame.
538059,Guest,2004-03-11 14:29:00,0,The worst prank I've ever been in on was on LacSuel a few years back. Houseboat trip with 6 guys. New guy is all gungho full of P&V. Each day he's up early gotta go go go! About the third day one of the vets grabs a jar of Icy Hot type ointment but it's odorless. While the newbie is out getting the fire going he grabs a pair of the newbie's shorts and rubs the ointment in the crotch. That next morning was quite a show after the newbie showered and changed for the day. I fell out of the rack and about didn't make it to the door before I'd wet myself. Still brings a tear to my eye.

538112,Guest,2004-03-11 20:50:00,0,"Every year we have that one person that eats everything but seldom cooks or does the dishes so I decided that last year was the end to that. I took a box of Hostess Ding Dongs and steamed them open. After I had the box open, i unwrapped each one and saved the tinfoil. Next I took a box of urinal mints and dipped them in melted chocolate and after they were dried, i wrapped them in the dingdong tinfoil. Glued the box shut and took them along. About the third day, i figured out which one of the newbies was this person and left the dingdongs on the table in the cabin while me and two others went fishing. When I got back there was a mint bit in half. Dont know for sure who 'ate' it but I laughed so hard i nearly pooped my pants."

538125,rebelrn2001,2004-03-12 20:32:00,1563,"The analgesic balm in the underwear brings back a good story. In high school there was kind of a feud going on between 2 of the tough guys in school. One of them put some balm in the others jock strap before ffotball practice. After he cooled down, a day or two later he got back at this guy...GOOD. Do you know how the straps in the top inside of helmets kind of (used to anyway) form a cross at the top? Well, he went and had a bowel movement in there. Keep in mind this is in late August and the temp was about 85 degress. It didn't take too long before he noticed the smell."
538139,hgf,2004-03-13 13:02:00,199,"My best fishing buddy, now gone for 10 years, told me this true story. He and another friend took their priest to Canada once, first time for the young man who had never been fishing. The priest caught the first fish, a really nice northern, and the two other guys got it into the boat. They looked at the fish, and at the priest, who was so excited he could hardly talk, and said ""Nah, too small, not a keeper"" and tossed it back. Apparently the priest just about went overboard to stop them! Only problem, it turned out to be the biggest fish they caught the entire trip! He heard about that for many years."

Check his hair after lunch, tell him to check his underarms and pubes for ticks. At night, before he goes to bed, sprinkle a few coffee grounds between his sheet. When he wakes up, the grounds will be stuck to him, and he will think they are ticks. Only problem is if he is a screamer, he will wake the camp up in the middle of the night when he goes to take a wiz. <{{}}><"

538049,Guest,2004-03-11 08:04:00,0,"This one works best on newbies. First set the stage on the drive up about bears coming into camp. Then the first night or so tip the garbage can on the porch over. The next morning make sure to point it out that a bear was in camp and got into your garbage. Over cards and heavy drinking that night bring up the garbage and the bear. After the newbie has passed out and gone to bed we pull out an old bear skin rug that was hidden away on the trip up. Then sneak into the newbies room with the rug. Get the bear face up close to the newbie, start snarling and rummaging around on him. Make sure you stand back because when he opens his eyes and starts screaming they tend to lash out swinging and kicking."

538031,Guest,2004-03-10 12:38:00,0,I always enjoy snipping off the end of the hooks on my buddy's lure of the day.....the one he leaves on his fishing pole. Also......if there is one of those floor matts in your cabin that has the sharp pointed backsides to it......take it outside and flip it over in front of either your or your friends cabins...when they go out to take a piss at night they will step on it....OUCH! Also.......If you want to be real mean pull out about 25 yards of your buddies fishing line and make a kick in it about every 5 yards.....after he loses three or four $6 lures in a row he will really be pissed. It's all good.

538035,Guest,2004-03-10 15:47:00,0,"I got my first handheld GPS about five years ago and took it on a trip to LOTW with my wife. She had no interest in what it was or what it did. I never wear a watch and my wife knows it. On about the third day of the trip when fishing was slow I discreetly looked at the GPS to see the time, then got her attention and made a big show like I was looking at the position of the sun to guess the time. I intentionally ""guessed"" about 10 minutes off of the actual time. She checked her watch and told me I was close but about 10 minutes off. By the end of the week I was ""guessing"" the time down to the minute with full cloud cover. She was genuinely impressed with my ability and finally asked me how I learned to do it. I told her an old Indian guide taught me. After returning home she bragged to her family and friends that I could tell almost the exact time just by looking at the sun. That's the best joke I've ever played. Now she doesn't trust anything I tell her."
