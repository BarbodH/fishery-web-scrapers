538145,Guest,2004-03-14 05:57:00,0,Fished there three times and it is awesome fishing. Accomadations could be a little better but who cares when you are catching fish like there is no tomorrow.

Excellent VIP cabins including full size showers, toilets, propane stoves, full freezer on the porch. Generator, which is so quiet you never hear it, runs 24 hours. Bait available in camp. 40 miles from everyone else so not much other boat traffic (a few houseboats move into NE section of Lac Seul pulling some walleye boats). Fishing is unbelievable. Catch up to 100 walleyes (some 24-27 inches) a day per boat. Ken and Brenda do an excellent job of taking care of their guests."
