538143,Guest,2004-03-13 23:28:00,0,Anyone know of any good restaurants in the area or if they have any place you can go and have a drink or two? Is there any night life in Ear Falls or do you just fish and sleep?

We usually make one evening run to the resturant , just to break up the week. Food is ok, decor is nothing to write home about (our cottages have better). If you happen to be there during hockey playoffs---the back room has some big screen tv's & usually a whole lot of screamin' hockey fans. We switched our trip from May to Aug. this year so I guess We'll miss out on that fun! Wishin' I was fishin'"

Wouldn't recommend driving the Red Lake road after dark because of the moose though, especially if you've had a few barleypops."
538168,Guest,2004-03-15 09:24:00,0,yes there is no nightlife there. One thing I noticed is when the weather is too bad for fishing everone must go to town because it gets crowded.
538189,Guest,2004-03-16 14:28:00,0,"The Trillum is okay. Just a coffee shop. I like the breakfasts there better than other meals. Sometimes the bar in back is busy and fun, but it's usually pretty empty. Haven't been there yet, but a lodge owner in the area told us last year that the best restaurant in Ear Falls is at the golf course. It's on the west edge of town."
538197,Guest,2004-03-16 17:53:00,0,The golf course has just o.k. food. Allow 2 hours cause usually they have to defrost it first. The Sunset restaurant about 30 miles south of Ear Falls used to have good food. Haven't been there for couple of years but the logging truck drivers stopped there alot and I believe they handled the American Plan for some resorts around there.
538198,BuckeyeWilly,2004-03-16 18:37:00,41,Don't know how much you want to spend but if its a good meal you want make reservations at Whitewing resort. Bobbie is one outstanding cook and I gurantee that you will not leave their hungry. Drinks are also available. Not cheap but well worth it in my opinion.
