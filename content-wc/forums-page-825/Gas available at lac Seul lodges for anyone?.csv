538199,Guest,2004-03-16 19:59:00,0,Going to lac seul this summer and want to put on a quite a few miles. Just wondering if we are not a guest at another resort and we are low on gas will most resorts sell us gas if we pull up to thier dock? Would we pay the same price as if we were guests?
538200,rebelrn2001,2004-03-16 21:20:00,1563,I don't know for sure but I don't know why they wouldn't. Especially if you are that low on gas. They charge an inflated amount anyway (not that that is bad..they get what they can as a business). How big is your tank? I think I would have to run hard for several hours before I even came close to running out of gas. Do some calculations before you go and figure out your range. If you have a GPS there is a way to keep track of miles covered.
538201,Guest,2004-03-16 23:06:00,0,fill up your tanks in the falls before crossing the bridge and then at the lodge just pay it. I know when you see the price in town its a lot cheaper. I suppose you could take your tanks to town or pull your boat out and take it to town and fill up that way. a lot of trouble though. good luck
538380,Guest,2004-03-22 11:01:00,0,"In response to your question regarding gas - we have a resort in the north eastern section of Lac Seul (you didn't say where on Lac Seul you would be fishing) known as Chamberlain Narrows. We do sell gas to fishermen that are not staying with us - so drop by. By the way, we also have a store right on site which also carries ice and live bait."
538382,Guest,2004-03-22 12:15:00,0,Thank you Brenda. We will be fishing in the North East section at times and we are new to that area. If you can could you give me the coordinates to your dock so I can enter it in my GPS so we can find your place or we may waste more gas trying to find it. Will be nice to stop at your store also.
