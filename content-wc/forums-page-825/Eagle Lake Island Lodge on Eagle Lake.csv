Personally I think your wasting your time fishing Eagle Lake, unless the Water is back to normal level and the water is cold. Fished it last year the end of May into June Water was about 3 feet low and the surface temp was 68. Did pretty ****ty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Then we started goingg to lac saul. its only 50 miles further up the road. It has great fishing. now we are over to LOTW. its good there too. good luck.

You just have to try differant things once in a while and have to adjust to the weather each year,with the season a week early this year and the weather not warming up yet could make for some great lake trout and walleye fishing and fishing the points for big northerns. Perch fishing might be on the slow side unless it warms the water up a little."

I know the first year we went to Eagle, the beginning of the week was a little slow but heated up(lots of fish) by midweek and we have been going back ever since. Once we adapted our presentations to Eagle the fishing was simple. Try throwing spinners, spoons or rapalas at weed beds, troll cranks or spinner rigs over flats and try jigging or back trolling Lindy rigs on submerged reefs. Whenever you are searching for a spot troll something behind the boat (rapala, thunderstick, rattle trap), you never know when or where you will find a hot spot. The smallie bite is a little tough that time of year, but the walleye and pike fishing are great. That is the same time of year we go each year. Our group actually felt like the fish were more concentrated due to the lower water levels last year. Don't hesitate to ask your lodge owner."

I wouldn't waste my time traveling to 5th and Broadway, it would be a long ride from the main lake to the west arm. And might not be worth the effort. Of course one could fish their way there and find a lot of nice spots to fish. Good Luck."
