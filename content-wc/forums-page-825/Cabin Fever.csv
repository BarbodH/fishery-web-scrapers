538133,IA  DAN,2004-03-13 08:09:00,53,I was just wondering where everyone was staying this year on Lac Seul and what time of year you are going.We will be at Black Bay Outpost last week of July.If you couldnt tell I'm alittle bored and counting the days down until were back up there.This will be my 5th year up there and I'm taking my 30 yr. old son for the first time this year.He's never seen or caught the size or quantity of fish that he is going to experience up on the best ##### walleye lake I've ever been on. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.

The facalities at Black bay have gotten better every year just like the fishing. Last year 7 of us bagged 1180 Walleyes and we expect to do it again this year.

Last year, we stayed at Country Camping near Hudson/Sioux Lookout and fished the Lac Seul straights (I guess). None of us have experienced this great of fishing, ever, so we will be back for round two this year - June 26 through July 1. I am sure I will be going somewhere up there fishing every summer, for the rest of my life."
