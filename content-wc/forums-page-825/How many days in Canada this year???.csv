538265,Guest,2004-03-18 19:41:00,0,I fish every day from opening to ice up. The only reason I stop at ice up is my trolling motor wont work.
538266,phern,2004-03-18 21:03:00,151,You could get a chainsaw and cut a very long narrow opening through the ice. You could then walk back and forth along side the trench and troll a lure as you walk.

538306,orchard frank,2004-03-20 08:37:00,1900,"Looks like 24 for me, spread over 3 trips, all to Lac Seul. Last wk in May with my wife, 8 days later with a friend who has had a bad run of luck and needs some fun, then first part of Sept, again with my best partner for 32 yrs. This year it will be with our new boat, 21 Tundra, the walleyes, pike and bass won't have a chance!!"

538233,Guest,2004-03-18 09:01:00,0,Thought it might be interesting to find out many days of Walleye fishing USA boys will spend in Canada this year. I will have 28.
538236,Tyee Guy,2004-03-18 10:25:00,717,"12......so far.......may have to add one more trip, then learn to live in my boat....That does not count the WI and MN days.....Work always seems to get in the way......."
538238,Fred_G,2004-03-18 10:43:00,908,Looks like 21 from here.
538241,Western Walleye Editor,2004-03-18 11:23:00,465,I will go with 16. Maybe more but that covers my 2 main trips up.
538244,Trailerguy,2004-03-18 13:41:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I hope to do better than last year, only 42 days between April and October. :)"
538245,czy42strokes,2004-03-18 13:43:00,419,"Most years 7 days, If lucky maybe a second fall trip for another 7. Work and kids and wife generally take precedence."
538246,Guest,2004-03-18 14:04:00,0,"Going to be a banner year for me....33 days. Lets see 33 days times 200 Walleyes a day/5lb average...thats 6600 Walleyes and 33,000 lbs. I better buy an extra fillet knife and a bigger freezer."
538247,Guest,2004-03-18 14:06:00,0,"Only 1 trip for me this year, up the end of May, go home the end of August! That would be about 90 days!"
538249,Guest,2004-03-18 15:04:00,0,"Twelve, and I'm not sure that will be enough."
538259,Guest,2004-03-18 18:27:00,0,"Wow, we got it made, eh!! 7 on Lac Suel(1st time) and approx. 21 or so on LOTW. Life is good!!"
