There are carp around Bronte Harbour, as I have seen them while Salmon fishing. Try posting as well on http://www.ontariofishing.net/cgi/me...l?board=board1 . You should get a few more responses there."

The carp are quite big and often aggressive feeders. I know no one keeps carp, but in case you were thinking about it, don't. The pollution levels there are rather nasty."

That time of year in oakville I like to use corn, doughballs, and stale timbits. Many 5-10 lbs with the 20lb monster from time to time. Nothing like frying fresh carp with potatoes and a cold blue. Ah, I can taste it now!"
