508708,Guest,2000-06-23 06:58:00,0,Does anyone have any information on Woman Lake Lodge and the fishing there?I am going up there with a group in early September and it is the first time any of us has been there.
508709,Randy,2000-06-23 08:20:00,53,I was just up there in early June. What specific questions do you have? The CNL internet site provides a tremendous amount of information. The fishing was OK but we had to put up with a cold front with rain for 5 days.
508710,Guest,2000-06-26 07:37:00,0,"Hi Randy,My question was really geared more towards how the fishing was and if there was anything in particular that worked better than anything else in that area. I have the flyer from the resort and have checked out their web site so I have somewhat of an idea what the place is like. I was just curious to hear what the fishing and facilities were like from someone had who had actually been there before."
