537547,Guest,2004-02-18 18:09:00,0,"Gold Pines Camp outside of Ear Falls is very reasonable. Owners are there to help and accomadations are great. Our cabin is 3 yrs. old 4 bedroom w/two beds in each room, two bathrooms spacious kitchen with large family room and screened porch. We go opening week, its a no brainer at the mouth of the river for eyes. Can also travel a little farther to lunkerpoint,the narrows, sawmill, and bannatyne. 100 fish a day, no problem the first week. I'll take 6 to 8 people @ about 175.00 per person, which includes docking. Owners are fantistic people. Good Luck. Spudder"

538228,Guest,2004-03-18 07:12:00,0,"jignpig, by reading your response I trust you have stayed at Lost Island Lodge before. Can you provide me with some information on fishing? I am booked there the middle of July and would like to know how the fishing is that time of year. Do we have to travel far for good fishing? Have you used the guides? How would you rate them? What type of bait would you recommend for walleyes that time of year? What is the best presentation, jigs, spinners, 3-ways, etc.? Any info you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"

537032,Whitetail,2004-01-30 12:07:00,25,I am interested in fishing the Lac Seul/Minnitaki area. Any recommendations on a reasonably priced reputable resort? This will be a family trip consisting of 4 people. I have checked many different resorts in the area and they seem to be running about $1000 US. Factor in all the additional costs and I am looking at $1400+. We use to camp but my wife prefers not to anymore. I will be bringing my own boat. We don't have to fish Lac Seul if you can recommend other lakes that will give my kids some walleye action. I appreciate all advice. Thanks!
537034,Guest,2004-01-30 13:24:00,0,"While not in the specific geographic area you identified, I get the feeling you might be kind of flexible on this. You might want to check out www.witchbay.com"
537037,Ia Walihntr,2004-01-30 13:37:00,320,"Here are some other good walleye lakes to go along with Lac Suel: Wabigoon, Dinoric, Eagle, Wabaskang, Perrault, Cedar, Lake of the Woods, just to name a few of the more obvious. There are tons of lakes in the Patricia Region that can offer good walleye fishing. If you need some ideas, check out www.heartland.on.ca website. Sign up for the free map of the area and you will start to recieve resort brochures from almost every lake in the area that has access. The variety should help you find just what you are looking for for you and your family. Good luck Marv"
537044,Guest,2004-01-30 17:00:00,0,"I second LunkerI vote for Witchbay. They have great fishing close to camp, good accomidations, food and excellent service. They also have a fishing program which is included in their package at no extra cost. They have 2 professional guides at the camp ready to help you with where to find the fish and what techniques are working at the moment. We went there for our first time last year and caught lots of fish. Our group of eleven had a great time and are going back again this year. Hope this helps."
537051,Gary_IA,2004-01-31 05:53:00,144,"Six or seven years ago my brother,his wife, and three of their daughters, age 9 and up went to Lake Wenasaga. As I recall the resort is operated by Iowans and is the only resort on the lake that is about 8 miles long. The resort is a housekeeping resort and the motors are 15 hp electric start. The lake is fed by the Wenasaga River and the lake empties into Lac Seul. Wenasaga is a few miles north of Ear Falls. My brother told me the Walleye fishing is good. He rigged up a line for the 9 year old and was going to bait the line for the second youngest but had to land a Walleye before he could bait up. This happened twice in a row. If you don't have a portable depth finder and marker bouys, rent or buy them. I think you will have to call about rates, but you can check out the website:www.wenasaga.com"
537052,Gary_IA,2004-01-31 06:31:00,144,"I see you will bring your own boat. I believe there is a boat ramp on Lake Wenasaga. Something you could ask the resort owner about. As I recall Jay said the rates were reasonable (he used a camp boat). If you get tired of fishing Ear Falls is close by for a Pizza run, etc."
537054,Guest,2004-01-31 08:13:00,0,"Here's one on Lac Seul that will fit your budget, probably less, 1 mile out of Ear Falls, www.lacseulsgoldeneagleresort.com , they have a ""family plan"" designed for the family during July and August. Good clean cabins, good equipment. 1-866-384-0117 toll-free, Can't recommend the pizza in town though."
537055,Guest,2004-01-31 09:41:00,0,"No resort is cheaper than Mahkwa Lodge. The walleye fishing is fantastic, over a 100 a day is not unusual. The lodge is very basic but very nice, not a lot of nonfishing activities."
537057,Gary_IA,2004-01-31 13:22:00,144,Try the following link for a search of resorts in the area. The link is for outfitters in the Patricia Region and is within the website www.allcanada.comhttp://www.heartland.on.ca/outfitters.shtml
537060,Guest,2004-01-31 18:33:00,0,"If you want walleye action and a reasonable price, you need not go any further north than the Morson area of Lake of the Woods. We pay $700 CANADIAN a week for the 4 of us for a super clean cabin with the comforts of home. The wife loves it because it is always well kept and cleaner than any other place we have been been. They have fun stuff for the kids too. Check it out. Mylie's Place in Morson. http://www.myliesplace.com It's almost a steal when you factor in the exchange on the US money."
