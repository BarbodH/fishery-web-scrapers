538081,JoeUpnorth,2004-03-10 14:51:00,17,"Donnie, It is a valid question, but I don't want this to turn into a bash Birchdale thread. Just watch your bill as the week goes along, demand the boats be in reasonable working order (especially if you've paid extra for a ""better"" boat) and make sure the cabins are able to meet your needs based on the number of people staying in them."
538113,Guest,2004-03-11 23:14:00,0,"I have stayed @ Birchdale. It's a top notch place, reasonable rates and good owners. They were really accomodating & Greg is a very good guide / angler. He was very helpful in providing info on what to look for / expect on Eagle Lake. I especially enjoyed the restaurant/steak pit. I'd recommend it to everyone ! Good Fishen Rob"

538127,Guest,2004-03-12 22:16:00,0,"I brought my own boat. I live in Winnipeg so it's not a far drive. I did however see the boats that the lodge guests use & to be honest they looked nice. I usually spend all my time in Minaki & I'd say that these boats looked better than whats in Minaki. NOW, before all ya Minaki types jump me, yes Paradise Cove has nice boats but they are getting old. This past summer was not a good year for Duanes boats....... yes, he does fix them when they break, but it seemed that they were breaking a little more than normal. Having said that, the boats @ Birchdale looked fine & I personally didn't hear ANYONE complaining about the boats / equipment. The only real complaints I heard....... ""These #### frigging flys !"" If you have any more questions, I'd be glad to try & help you out ! Good Fishen Rob"

538153,flatland fisherman,2004-03-14 10:09:00,29,"We stayed at Birchdale two years ago in the first week in July. As luck would have it the May fly's had just hatched and the fishing was not good at all. We camped with friends and the campsites are adequate, however no tree's to provide any shade. The dock boys where very helpful and looked after my boat as it was there own. They did not really help as far as giving advise on hot spots, however where good guys .I asked the owner for advise on some locations, however he appeared to be pushing the services of the local guide. I agree with Joe, watch your bill especially if you are paying in Canadian dollars. Their exchange rate is criminal considering they are located in Canada and everything is priced in US dollars."
538158,Guest,2004-03-14 19:37:00,0,I was just curious how exactly they can rip you off on your final bill? Do they try to pull a fast one on purpose or is there a different percentage of exchange at a resort. Steve
538180,flatland fisherman,2004-03-15 20:25:00,29,"I made the mistake of paying with cash. Once I got home and actually figured out the exchange I was charged, it would have been 5% cheaper if I would have used my credit card and let the bank charge me the exchange. My mistake I guess."

538026,JoeUpnorth,2004-03-10 09:08:00,17,"Steve, We didn't stay at the campground, stayed in one of the cabins and chose to upgrade our boat package. It was our first trip to Eagle Lake and we have been going back to Eagle every since. We just would never return to Birchdale. Fishing has been great, with plenty of nice fish and good stories over the years. I hope you have a good trip and your stay with Birchdale was better than ours. Joe"
