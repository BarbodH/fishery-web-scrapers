531317,Guest,2003-05-22 15:43:00,0,15th year. Probably as close to heaven as I will get.
531316,BuckeyeWilly,2003-05-22 15:45:00,41,"Let me add my two cents. Being from Ohio I have many who ask me why I would travel so far into Canada with Lake Erie so close. To me there is no comparison. Sure, the walleye and smallmouth (my favorite) fishing on Lake Erie is great but it can't compare to the beauty and peacefulness of a Canadian Lake. The call of the Loon, seeing moose, bear, eagles, etc. Nothing can compare to this. I have made many trips to different areas of Canada, stayed at all kinds of camps, and can honestly say I have made friends at all of them. This year I am bringing a couple of young guys (friends of my son) who will be making their first Canadian fishing trip. I can't wait till they experience all that your great country has to offer. Thanks for allowing us to enjoy your great land.Willy"

I too am from Wisconsin, but as the others have said, nothing compares to the Canadian lakes. You can look out over thousands of acres of water and unspoiled timber and truely feel alone. I am leaving in less than 153 hours to go again for 1 week (to Merkels at Wabigoon Lake) (with my wonderful wife). I am also leaving 6 days after returning from there to go again with a group that includes my 2 cousins (to Lac Seul). This fall, my wife and I are returning to Canada again. This time to Rainy Lake. GEEZ, I live a tough life!!!"

It could save you a few bucks. A month ago the exchange was 1.55, its down to 1.36 today and me be as low as 1.25 by July."
531320,Guest,2003-05-27 19:33:00,0,"I agree with Poke, I am from Western New York and have been traveling to Canada for 25 years. I enjoy at least one week long fishing trip each year and could not think of a better place to go. I always feel welcome when traveling in Canada.Our family has been going to the same lake for many years, we are now on owner number four, all have been really nice to us. Looking forward to getting back there again this year. We have many great memories of Canada.Thanks from the deepest part of my heart.Jay"
531321,Guest,2003-05-28 12:19:00,0,I am form Houston and would like to echo Pokes sediments. Me and my family love Canada like a brother. The best neighbors anyone could have.
531305,Guest,2003-05-20 06:32:00,0,"Just wanted to say thanks to my brothers and sisters in the north. With all of the complaining we do about eachother I think it is necessary to express my thanks for sharing these increadible resources. I live in Wisconsin and have access to some great fishing, but nothing like it is over the border. Sure, there have been instances of bad experiences, but none any different than I have come across down here. Some of us need to realize that fishing up there is a privilidge. I know the dollars we spend help their economy, but it still comes down to the fact that we are guests. So I guess I just want to express my thanks for some of the best fishing memories I have. (and hopefully many more to come)Keep the hooks sharp.Poke"
531306,McQ,2003-05-20 06:58:00,615,"Thank You Poke, I am one Canadian who really appreciates your message."
531307,PRD1,2003-05-20 07:12:00,458,"I sure endorse your comments Poke and as an American who loves to fish in Canada and all the folks I have met there in my trips over the past 13 years echo your comments. It is a tremendous resource they have and I am glad to be able to travel there and enjoy it. Americans and Canadians have a lot more in common than any other nations in the world, we could not have a better neighbor.Paul"
531308,Northern Manitoban,2003-05-20 09:40:00,195,Your welcome.Come to Manitoba anytime! NM
531309,Cat Eye Outfitter,2003-05-20 15:35:00,9,I (as one Canadian) appreciate the sentiment....You are welcome to come up and share what truly is God's country anytime!
531310,BD,2003-05-20 16:18:00,739,I agree with Poke. I'm also from WIscowsin and have met many great people and had wonderful times in Canada. Thanks to my northern brothers.
531311,Moose,2003-05-20 16:52:00,248,"As a Canadian I am glad to hear these comments as well.I think the whole Canada Vs. The U.S.A. is a reflection of shows like Cops where we don't see the typical Honest American Citizen.We grow up here with honest gun laws and not used to the ststus Q over there.We know far more about your country than you will ever know about ours and when I think back I too was probably a little anti U.S. but since I have met, Fished and had a few brews with you I can say I was more than mistaken, your actually good peeps and I enjoy meeting you guys during the summer.Have fun guys see you all soon."
531312,Guest,2003-05-21 01:54:00,0,I to would like to say thanks for letting us share your beautiful country.I wish my children and grandchildren (I hope) can enjoy the great times and even better fishing that I have had over the years.I hope that our country's remain friends through these uncertin times.We must be very thankful for the relationship our two country's have with each other. THANK'S AGAIN. see ya in 4 weeks T-BIRD
531313,Guest,2003-05-21 05:38:00,0,"My Dad and I would also like to say THANK YOU to Canada for sharing their beautiful country and great fishing. We have made some great memories that will last a lifetime over the last 7 years. And the people that we have met, have all been wonderful. They greet us with a smile and a firm handshake. The lodge that we stay at really treat us like family those 2 weeks that we are there. They really make us feel at home with their kindness and hospitality. With so much hate in this world, it's a real pleasure to go somewhere knowing that you are welcome. We are proud to call Canada our neighbor. THANK YOU !!!See you in September."
531314,Stehle,2003-05-21 07:03:00,95,My sentiments as well. I dwell on my trip to Lake Kawaweogama from September until I arrive the following June. It has only been 2 trips for me but the ferver to return has only grown. The Walleye fishing is fantastic but the natural beauty is the kicker.
