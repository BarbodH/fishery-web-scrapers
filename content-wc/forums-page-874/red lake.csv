The biggest wallleye from our group was a healthy 28inch, others averaged in the 20's. anybody else have luck at red lake(East bay, Martens bay, Youngs bay). Does anyone have info about the trout in red lake? I talked to a guy who strictly fishes lakers in camp and he said when they trapped a section of trout eggs this past fall,the eggs never hatched. Does anyone know why? was it the acidity in the water?"
