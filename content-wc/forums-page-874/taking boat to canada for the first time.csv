531147,Reels,2003-05-19 18:52:00,2876,"Spare tire and the right equipment to change it!Tools for the boat and a volt meter.Spare fuses, black tape, etc. Most electrical problems happen after days of rain.<{{}}><"
531148,Guest,2003-05-22 21:47:00,0,Ok thanks everyone. thats a good list. I think I got all the bases covered but thing always come up. I am going to include a grease gun with marine grease in it. one more week!
531149,Fishing Junky,2003-05-23 03:21:00,182,"Hey Alan, A good gps wouldn't hurt either. Takes alot of the guess work out when traveling. Good luck with your trip, Junky........"
531150,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-05-23 20:39:00,618,"Your rig is still rather new, but I would still take it to a mechanic I trusted to check everything before the trip. One often overlooked part of the trailer is the springs. Have them checked especially if you have the single heavy spring. It is not a bad idea to pick up a spare set at the spring shop."
531151,Guest,2003-05-23 21:35:00,0,Don't bring a handgun in!!
531142,Guest,2003-05-24 14:01:00,0,">A nice sized cooler for da beers. Hopefully you mean ""in camp"". He probably won't want to have any in the boat.There is a $100 fine PER BOTTLE/CAN if you are caught with it on the lake. Yes, that means a 6-pack will cost you $600.PLUS, if you have bottles, and 3 of them have been opened and you cannot produce 3 tops, that is littering. You can be nailed for that, too. The fine for that, I am told, is also $100 per instance or $300 in this case.One more thought ... if everyone in your boat has their limit of walleyes in the freezer at camp, and the warden asks you what you had for lunch 2 hours ago and you say ""walleye"", you are over the limit and can be ticketed as well. I had 2 buddies get nailed that way.I get checked on the waters about every 2nd summer or so. The wardens are business-like but not aggressive. They have never entered my boat. They HAVE asked to look in the live well. We keep our life vests on the backs of our seats and readily accessible so they did not ask to see them. They usually DO ask to see our licenses. They also ask which camp we stay at so they can radio their on-shore co-workers to check how may fish we have in the freezer. Hopefully you won't have any problems. Oh, and check the fishing regs. In Wisconsin an angler can have TWO lines. In Ontario it is only ONE. I had a buddy get a ticket for that one a few years ago.Have fun. I can't wait to go myself. New boat this year. The motor is nearly broken in and ready to roll."
531152,old fisherman,2003-05-25 19:09:00,545,"Everything here is good just don't take another couple because you don't think you can handle the boat alone. I did this several years ago and it was a trip from #####. The guy was suppose to be a good fisherman, a good cook and know how to clean fish. His wife was suppose to be a riot, She was, the wrong kind. He couldn't do any of the above. I'd fished with him before and knew his wife but I'd never been around them together. Enough said. Have a good trip."
531153,Guest,2003-05-26 19:42:00,0,"Alan, maybe some of the Canadian guys on board here can back me up, but one salient piece of equipment you must have on board that the US Coast Guard typically does not require is to have a paddle on board. Depending on the size of boat you have, it may seem rather useless, but I think it is a requirement. Have a good trip."
531154,Reels,2003-05-27 10:25:00,2876,"I think it is an alternate propulsion device. Paddle, trolling motor, or kicker. Not 100% sure though.<{{}}><"
531155,Guest,2003-05-27 22:46:00,0,OK thanks everyone. Just yesterday had to change brake cylinder and shoes on the trailer. thankfully it was bad enought to leak sunday and not this friday. thanks.
531136,Guest,2003-05-16 23:54:00,0,"Hi. Got a new boat last year and taking to lake of the woods for the first time in about 2 weeks. what I need is anyone with experience with taking their boat up to canada. what to do ,what not to do, things to take with, things not to take with, and any other ideas that experienced people have learned the hard way or the easy way.. Thanks a lot. Alan"
531137,lt,2003-05-17 05:55:00,13,"Keep an extra prop and tools ""on board"". You never know when a rock will float to the top and nail you.Make sure you have all the safety devices required by Canadian law. Whistles, throwing devices, flash light, ropes etc. Check the regs.And most of all, if you are inclined hone up on the alcohol regs. There is another thread out here that addresses that matter very well. Good luck and good fishing."
531138,bigfish1965,2003-05-17 07:01:00,3210,"Actually, your boat only requires the safety equipment that you would normally need at home. Make sure you have that stuff. The Canadian Coast Guard is well versed in US safety reg's."
531139,Guest,2003-05-17 08:08:00,0,"While channel surfing on TV, I noticed there is a floating prop wrench. Kind of hard to change the prop when the wrench is at the bottom of the lake. (I don't know where you get it or how you change a prop.That would be nice to know) Also I note there have been discussions of steel versus aluminum props. I believe the argument for aluminum that less damage to the drive and gears because the aluminum will absorb and the steel will transmit."
531140,Guest,2003-05-17 17:50:00,0,"If you are not familiar with the lake you are on, especially if it is a tea stained lake, go slow, as you cannot see reefs that may be just inches below the surface, and when there is a chop on the water, be extremely cautious, even if you are in the middle of the lake, if you don't know the water, don't open her up! Learned this the hard way! Cost me a lower unit!"
531141,Guest,2003-05-17 19:31:00,0,A nice sized cooler for da beers.
531143,Jesse-WI,2003-05-17 20:10:00,534,"Trailer extra hub, set of bears with seals, extra cap or bearing buddy make sure spare tire is in good shape with proper pressure check current tire pressure make sure you have a jack that will work on the vechicle and trailerBoat extra pug for livewell and boat drain extension cords and battery charger if necessary all safty equipment required by your state good first aid kit marine radio, be aware of the weather spare propThere are some excellent boat dealers in the area that can provide an amazing amount of help"
531144,VMS,2003-05-19 05:49:00,1103,"Anytime you are in a remote portion of any major body of water, it is always good to have a second method to get home if needed. If you have one available somehow, a good kicker motor can save the day. I had one up on Clearwater/pipestone chain, and was very happy I had a way to get back to camp...all 12 miles of it with a 6 hp, but I made it backSteve"
531145,Guest,2003-05-19 11:19:00,0,I second the extra means of transportation!Twice I have had motot failure and had to resort to other methods. Trolling moter the first time... got a kicker on the new boat and used it too. 25+ mile out>sure beats sleeping on an island
531146,bubbalou,2003-05-19 14:34:00,29,"Personal experience says make sure your tires are good to go and the spare has the CORRECT air pressure. I have lost tread on trailers 2 out of last 4 trips. Put the spare on only to find it had enough air pressure to fell solid when hit with a hammer but, when the weight of the boat hit was put on it the thing squatted to an inch. I always load my floor jack and tool box last. All I have to do is drop the tailgate and everything is right there. Took less then 10 minutes the last time I had to change it. :-)"
