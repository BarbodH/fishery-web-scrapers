531536,Guest,2003-05-27 13:38:00,0,"There is a LCBO in Emo, they sell both liquor and beer. I believe it open at 11 am and closes at 6 pm."
531537,Steve,2003-05-28 15:07:00,259,You can buy hard stuff and beer from Larry and Mary @ L&M. And they other items that you might need. I have been in the place and it is a lot better than going back to town!
531538,Guest,2003-05-28 15:21:00,0,"Thanks, I just heard about L&M's store...are the prices in line??"
531524,Guest,2003-05-25 20:18:00,0,"We are headed that way in a couple of weeks to the Clearwater/Pipestone chain. It's been years since I've gone West from the Falls, and can't remember if there are stores in Emo. If so where and hours???? Thanks....."
