531607,Guest,2003-05-27 20:42:00,0,"I can't be a lot of help on smallies, I have caught them later in the year in Butler over weed beds and in the channel between Wabagoon and Dinorwic. I have also caught them in Minnehaha by the falls from Peak Lake.Most island points in Dinorwic will hold walleye. Some good places to try are Turtlepond and Minnehaha. When entering turtlepond go the the left and fish the point along the se shore. I have caught walleye there including one 27"", also try along the west shore, I have seen a 29"" walleye taken there along with many others. Minnehaha, along the east wall below the falls is also excellent. However, you have to fish this fairly early as the water here is clear and once the sun reaches that shore line the walleye quit biting. On the way to turtle there are some stumps before you enter the weedy area, fish around these stumps we have caught a number of walleye there. Do go down the channel between Dinorwic and Wabagoon, in going to Wabagoon you will go past some private homes. At the point of the last home there are 2 islands in the channel. Fish the south side of the north island along the weeds. You will pick up walleye and pike. The north side can also be good but has a lot of rocks and you get snagged a lot. What ever you do hit some of the weed beds and back bays in the evening for pike, the action is great even if you don't keep them. There are lots more but this is already geting too long."
