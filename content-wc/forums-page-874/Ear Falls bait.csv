530046,Guest,2003-05-16 12:27:00,0,"That's what I like about this site. It seems like everybody says it the way it is. Personnally, I like 4 season's big.........minnows. I don't know if it's an ad or not but Smitty's does have good bait and tackle."
530047,Guest,2003-05-17 05:35:00,0,Smitty's has free coffee too.
530049,Guest,2003-05-17 17:17:00,0,Pam has had a good business for years. I don't think there is any jealousy of Mike. Too bad she lowered her standards to pick up a bum that is her leech!
530050,Guest,2003-05-20 14:51:00,0,Didn't know fishermen were into fashion! There really isn't much to see there.
530048,Guest,2003-05-20 14:53:00,0,I've seen bigger minnows!
530034,Guest,2003-05-21 16:26:00,0,"Hey, ""done had enough"". Me too! As a resident of Ear Falls and a non-business owner I truly enjoy the pleasant visitors that frequent our community and truly appreciate the impact within our community. As for your statement in regards to the aboriginal fishing/hunting regulations, maybe you too should run for political office. We are always looking for a new master baiter every now and then. Myself being a non aboriginal I strongly believe in their rights ands ways of life and am more than happy to accept and RESPECT this. As for my fishing enjoyment, there is nothing better than a color photo to show all my HOGS I have caught, Taking these hogs out of the life cycle do you not feel this has an impact on future walleye populations. Yes you are correct in your rights to keep one fish over the slot size and if you choose to eat a fatty filet hats off to ya but a picture is worth a thousand words. Simple self control and a disposible camera by us avid outdoors people will eliminate the need for catch and release to be regulated. As for your verbal trashing of one of our local businesses, I feel this is totally un-called for and feel your total disrespect for mankind and our enviroment you should go to somewhere else. Whether it be a camp owner and or a bait shop these folks bust their butts every year to give great service and better memories to all, show some respect ""FLYINON"". Happy Fishing! PS if you need to really catch a hog, call me"
530035,Guest,2003-05-21 16:39:00,0,"""WAY TO GO IZUMI JUNIOR"" Sometimes people forget that being rude and obnoxious doesnt make for good reading.... I too, am a resident of Ear Falls and love the tourist season!!! I not only am a customer of Four Seasons but also to all the other Businesses as well... they all work hard and are pleasant people to deal with on a daily basis. I too love to catch that HOG, but you can bet your last dollar that a picture sent to a taxidermist will bring me a beautiful mount and the pride that i had the good sense to release a breeder back into the chain of spawn life....If everyone took a hog there would not be any piglets left for future fishing..... grow up n stop bashing people that u dont even know......"
530036,Guest,2003-05-21 20:05:00,0,"See I hit a nerve with you all. If you read my posts regarding the famous ""FORKED TONGUED"" tackle shop owner, you will notice that I DO practice C&R when it comes to fishing. To set the record>I purchase a conservation license to allow me a few fish meals while enjoying the incredible fishing. Not only do I respect the fishery, I also respect the environment. I'm a firm believer in packing out more than what I bring in. After shore lunch you will find me picking up others trash and hauling it out. Upgraded both of my motors to DFI/4 stroke to help the air/water quality. The point of the whole post is I don't need or want a arrogant business owner telling me>What bait to fish with>I use minnows>he tells me leaches are it. Tells me that the resort owner is screwing me cause those minnows are junk and over priced. My choice to stay there and over the last 9 years, don't feel ever being taken advantage of! They are there to make a living too!Where to fish>fish Lac Suel>tells me to fish the English River or Pakwash lakeThat I'm using the wrong tactics>Use bottom bouncers w/spinner>tells me that I should be jigging What fish to keep>won't even address this again!What type of boat to use>I like my boat! Work my rump off to have it>tells me that I should buy brand X boat/motorWhat type of equipment to fish with>prefer baitcasters>tries to sell me a spinning setup. Using the wrong fishing line, bottom bouncer, spinner, rod etc.It is annoying to be subjected to that BS... I shop for a reason and it's not for his opinions. Realize he is in business to sell merchandise but there is a point when enough is enough. He would be better off keeping his mouth shut unless asked. It is very funny that what ever is said he will steer you in another direction. Now if you ""locals"" still think I'm barking up the wrong tree, so be it! My only intention was to express my dissatisfaction with that particular individual and that my business goes elsewhere in Ear Falls. As for TC>I don't need HIM telling me what to do either! In 2 1/2 weeks I'll be back again to enjoy the beautiful setting and hope to catch a few fish! Hope to see you on the lake!"
530051,Guest,2003-05-28 13:23:00,0,"wow, didn't realize that this was such a controversy. i just go in there to buy bait and tackle. always have been pleased with the quality, prices and service. never have placed too much credence on fishing tips handed out in bait shops. it's usually about a month out of date."
530031,Guest,2003-04-30 05:54:00,0,flyinonclueless I'm sorry that Nike hurt your feeling when trying to tell you to be a resposeable fisherman and throwing the over slot fish back.I hope that some day you'll be able to sleep at nite for his intrusion on your right to keep big fish.
530032,Guest,2003-04-30 10:15:00,0,"Doesn't surprise me that you would get on the soapbox with ole ""Forked Tongue"". Are the 2 of you related??Why are the natives allowed to fish where ever/when ever/ and keep what ever and there isn't a peep out of any of you? Wonder why the regulations state 1 fish OVER 21""? Bet it is to piss the lake owner association off!If you lake owners would suggest and encourage C&R, you would probally would get better results. Guess you all should change thefishing regulations to total C&R. Wouldn't that be even better for the fishery? Maybe you all are afraid that the almighty $$ would go else where!What camp do you run/own...Like to stop by so YOU can take a picture of my hog!"
530038,Guest,2003-04-30 10:26:00,0,Leeches and eggs is good fer my brekfest but I likes sum moose milk to wersh it down.
530039,Guest,2003-05-11 18:14:00,0,"With 20 years of fishing experience in the Ear Falls area, I am amused with Fork Tongue's vast knowledge of the fishing area. If talk made you a fisherman, he'd be a pro! So Fork Tongue, go to your favorite spot by the rock, and catch fish, because with your knowledge, it may be the only place you could fill a limit. Better take the woman of the house to catch them for you!"
530040,Guest,2003-05-14 08:14:00,0,We have been stopping at Four Seasons for years. They have a great business and will continue to get ours.
530041,Guest,2003-05-14 09:09:00,0,"If you don't like shopping at Four Seasons...don't forget there are other businesses in Ear Falls that sell bait, tackle, souviners, and licenses!!! We aren't all ""know it alls"" like Mike. Some of us look forward to summer and the tourists. If not for you some of us wouldn't be in business...like Four Seasons! Don't forget that!!"
530044,Guest,2003-05-14 10:57:00,0,NICE AD
530045,Guest,2003-05-14 14:01:00,0,"We all know why the fisherman stop at 4 Seasons, it's to see Pam and some of those great shirts she wears. You just have to tolerate Mike cause he comes with the package. Could it be there's alot of guys jealous of him?"
530042,Hammerhead Herb,2003-05-16 10:00:00,259,So where else in Ear Falls can you buy about 40 doz minnows? There is a place just down from (east) the 4 Seasons off the main hiway. Any place else?
530043,Guest,2003-05-16 11:26:00,0,"There is a gas station, SMITTY'S, on the north edge of Ear Falls run by fantastic people. They have minnows, tackle, licenses, and dry ice. Some souvenirs and fantastic mounts of some of the native animals. The outfit just east of 4 Seasons is always badmouthing Americans. He'll gladly take your greenbacks then cuss you as you drive away."
530023,Dave,2003-04-22 10:30:00,258,"If anyone has been trying to contact Four Seasons Sports via e-mail they have a new e-mail address, [email protected]. The phone is the same 807-222-2200 We bought 6 lbs. of leeches from them last Sept. and plan to return after Labor Day this year."
530024,jigger,2003-04-23 05:50:00,55,NICE sales pitch. I hope you don't get any bites!!
530025,Guest,2003-04-23 06:18:00,0,Would have been a better sales pitch if they would have included a DISCOUNT COUPON for Leechs.
530026,Guest,2003-04-23 18:47:00,0,I heard leeches are going to be hard to get this year? We're telling the guest that come to our camp to stop at four season to get their bait. we'll pass along that e-mail address thanks
530027,Guest,2003-04-27 06:15:00,0,I would'nt buy anything from old fork of tongue.You will get screwed as soon as you walk in the door.
530028,Guest,2003-04-27 20:18:00,0,"Can't believe your really trying to hock you business on this site! It's bad enough when your in the store having to listen to your arrogant wisdom. Must have been a long winter and are tried of counting the ways to take someone's money. I always wonder why the methods/lure/line/rod/boat are never correct when I've been there in the past? Real funny... seems MY methods do produce what I come there for... to catch fish. Oh, and by the way... If I want to keep a hog, it's my right based on the regulations the Canadian Government have imposed. Not the regulations that some bait shop owner has come up with. Maybe you should tone down your opinions....Funny, I'm not the only one who has made these observations!The rest of you have a choice... I prefer to have everything that is needed prior to getting to Ear Falls when it comes to tackle/bait.Will give my bait business to the camp owner without hesitation vs giving you a dime!Done had enough!"
530029,Guest,2003-04-28 05:38:00,0,"Hey flyinonstupidty sounds like your the hog, a fish hog and if the resort owner lets you keep big fish then he's not much of a businessman. You people that think keeping big fish just to take that extra couple inches of fillet home crack me up."
530033,Guest,2003-04-28 20:35:00,0,"If you've been here before you already know how you like to fish and what to use, if not, talk to your camp owner. I have found their prices reasonble and the leeches I have gotten from them are decent size and healthy. When the law changed and you could not bring leeches into Canada any more I bought leeches in Ft Francis and Dryden and they were small and many were in poor shape. Yes its legal, but I would never filet a hog and turned back a 6lb blue walleye last August. 2 weeks, hope for ice out."
530037,Bruce,2003-04-29 09:12:00,48,"We have bought leeches from 4 seasons for many years and have been veryhappy with the service and quality of the leeches. Not cheap but what isup there?Always enjoy talking to Mike, never had a bad experience there.Will be stopping again this year on our way to Pakwash.Good Luck to everyone heading to God's country!!"
530030,Guest,2003-04-29 10:59:00,0,"I don't recall responding to your post. And you are who?Anyways...The point I made in the prior post is IF I choose to keep a HOG it was my right based on the license that I purchase. When one purcheses a license it stipulates what the regulations are. The last time I checked @ LS it was 4 fish, 3 under 18"" and 1 over 21"" or 4 under 18"". Based on the regulations I am entitled to take the above combo(s), like it or not. If you don't like it, change the regulations @ the govermental level and not the local level. If the speed limit states 60 kph>can't you go 60 kph?Sure you can encourage C&R but to demand is totally off base.Now, for the record...I do practice C&R at LS and any lake I fish. It is unfortunate that YOU missed the point of my previous post and aren't much better that the mooron @ 4 Seasons Bait Shop!"
