531587,Guest,2003-05-27 16:48:00,0,"No offence to you Chuck personally, i'm sure I wouldn't catch you throwing away dead fish, but maybe you will see me on the lake when your up and see how big a fella I am .Look for the Pirate flag on either of my 2 boats and you will find me as I live on the lake and fish almost daily.Good fishin to all.."
531584,Guest,2003-05-27 11:54:00,0,Going to Lac Seul this summer and I heard that Walleye in your possesion must be dead. Is that true and if so WHY? The guy who told me said it was because it would stop culling.....I think some people would throw away dead fish. Besides that unless you take SPECIAL care fish out of a livewell or off a stringer die any way......
531585,Guest,2003-05-27 12:28:00,0,"Thats right. Any walleye in your possesion on Lac Seul have to be dead.Snap there necks back and throw them in a cooler after you check to see if they are not slot size.This does prevent culling, and any responsible fisherman would never throw away dead fish.Besides, If I saw you throw a dead walleye our of your boat I would be the first to kick yer a$$."
531588,Stevie B,2003-05-27 12:49:00,157,That's the first that I have heard of a rule like that. I like it!!! I think that they should do that on more bodies of water.Fish ON!!
531586,Guest,2003-05-27 13:01:00,0,How Big A Fella Are Ya??? ......I agree that no one should throw back dead fish...but I bet you that some idiots do.
531589,bigfish1965,2003-05-27 13:23:00,3210,""" No stringer "" rules are becoming more and more popular. We converted the livewell in my boat to a big-azz cooler by putting insulation on each side wall and filling it up with ice. Now it keeps crawlers, fish and sodas cold."
531590,Guest,2003-05-27 13:33:00,0,"Any walleye kept on Lac Seul must be dead, most camp owners provide ice to put in your livewell or cooler. This does help to prevent culling and you will be surprised how fresh these fish are at the end of the day."
531592,Guest,2003-05-27 14:57:00,0,"We have fished Lac Suel for several years and you will find as we did that if you throw the walleyes on ice they will keep alot better than they do in the live well,especially when its hot out,and it is a good way to keep crawlers or leeches. That way you can use your live well for your minnows. Good Luck"
531591,Codydawg,2003-05-27 14:58:00,14,"IMO there is no way this prevents much in the way of dead fish. If you have the culling mentality, you will do it regardless. I hate the rule. However, I have never broken the rule, and never will. I abhor those that throw their dead fish back, but unfortunately some do. I personally feel this results in more dead walleyes than before. Ice has historically not been available to me, so now what do I do? I really dont believe people cull very often on Lac Seul. I have been fishing the lake for 17 years and can NEVER remember either seeing or hearing about someone culling. I am a big fan of catch and release, buy the conservation license and am as big of a fan of conservation as you will find, but this one baffles me. My brother tried to snap back the head on a walleye and cut the heck out of his finger for his trouble. Do the math. Only a % of fisherman cull and only a % of fish that are culled die. Only a % of those that cull will follow the rule and kill their fish. Subtract the dead floaters you see (and yes, I have seen the evidence floating belly up from this terrible act). What is left? Not much if anything, maybe a negative number. How many people fish Lindy Rigs and belly hook them and the fish die? I say way more than this dead fish rule results in. Why not ban this type of fishing?"
531593,Codydawg,2003-05-27 15:02:00,14,"Jeff,I respectfully disagree with you. There is no way a dead fish on ice is better than a live fish. You can use your live well for minnows with water with a thing called a minnow bucket if you dont have a bait well and they will live much better on a continual supply of fresh water than the same water that you have to remember to change.I would vote for extending the slot from the current 18-21"" to 18-29"". Now that would help the fishery. I couldnt hope to count the number of filleted 23-26"" I see in camp every year."
531594,Guest,2003-05-27 15:19:00,0,Jeff is right. Fish on ice keep better than a fish in a livewell with warm water. The meat doesn't deteriorate like it does in warm water. All the guides at the camp I go to keep their fish in a cooler filled about 1/3 with ice. Easy to transport up to the fish house at the end of the day too.
