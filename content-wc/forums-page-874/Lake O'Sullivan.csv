531636,Guest,2003-05-28 15:23:00,0,So how was it?? I'm heading up on 6/11. Appreciate any information!
531637,Guest,2003-05-28 15:40:00,0,"I checked your arrival date and the date you posted; I think you meant ""6/9"". Have you been to O'Sullivan before? Our group is usually up there the same week in Cabin One; Bruce, Andy, Mark etc AND WE ARE PUMPED. drop a line let's talk fishing...Andy"

This has always been a pretty good tactic for mid-June at O'Sullivan. Other than that, 1/4 oz. jig with a light colored twister tail and crawler has nailed tons of 'eyes in this lake. Northern should still be lurking emerging weeds and points. The usual suspects (big sticks, spoons, spinners and topwaters) should all get the job done. Dress a Johnson Silver Minnow with a white or yellow bass strip and pitch the shallows. Be sure to make the trip into Clatouche once or twice since it's smaller and shallower and the water should be a bit warmer and the fish a bit more active. Have the camera ready when moving up the river. We've spotted moose up there three years in a row, now. The big sand bar on the western shore of the northern portion of the main lake usually holds an abundance of walleye and northern and if the wind is right could be real hot. Smith's Bay and Raymond's Bay are always pretty hot, too. We'll be heading up the last week in June so have fun but save a few for us, eh. And...a thorough report would be appreciated upon your return.Thunderstick (A 23 year O'Sullivan vet)"
531640,Guest,2003-05-29 10:27:00,0,"That's good advice for O'Sullivan. And always follow the wind to the walleye. Most times I bring tons of stuff and end up using the same white, pink or chartreuse jigs 1/4 oz with worm some times a small twister or lighter for the light bite and stick baits for trolling. Try for eyes on the shoreline on the northern side of the camp peninsula and troll as slowly as you can!! and troll right into the cut into Pike Bay. SLOWLY is the key. Last year bugs were a bit tough so do bring the Off etc. The staff there will help with questions--ask Russell where he is hiding all the fish; he will help you with whatever you need to have a great time. See you 6/12 on the water!"
