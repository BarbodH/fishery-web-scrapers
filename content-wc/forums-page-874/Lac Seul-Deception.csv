531463,Karl,2003-05-22 19:44:00,63,"As of this past Monday, Lake Minnitaki is down 7ft from last year. Since this is the major feed to Lac Seul, I'd guess it's down a similar amount. Some rain today, but mostly sunny an mid 70's rest of week. good luck"
531464,Guest,2003-05-23 14:08:00,0,"Lookout for rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!! just came back and it is very scary. There is a bridge that goe's over Loon rapids now so they can clear cut the big island. So what is pristine now, will look like a battle zone one of these day's. Fishing was good, not great. Was not like last year for big fish. The ramp at Deception is actually pretty good. The water is down 7-8' there are reefs that we did not know ever exsisted after 18 years of fishing there."
531465,Guest,2003-05-24 06:47:00,0,"so jabs whats parts fo ther lake did you fish? did you go as far as bear narrows, and did you find a pattern for eyes?anie from the beer store in dryden"
531466,Guest,2003-05-24 14:48:00,0,"We went all the way up to Birch narrows and caught quite a few, but not as big as last year. We found the big ones on the way back to the big lake by 3 sisters. 10-20'. Live minnows did fine but not as well as borax minnows.They were all gone from Pelican rapids too. I would say you will most likely find the bigger ones in their pre-summer spots. forget the shallow bays because unless you have a canoe, you just can't get back in there. We tried, but got stuck a few times."
531467,Guest,2003-05-24 20:22:00,0,"have fished 3 sisters alot know that area well, so you fished the current break on birch narrows, was thinking of going up to perch ripple.you had know problem going thru the rags? thanks for the info, on the depth you fished, did you notice what the water temp. was.anie for the beer store"
531468,Guest,2003-05-26 07:54:00,0,"I've never had to go as far as perch ripple but I think all the fish have moved out. As far as the rags, it only had 7"" of water in it. The water temps were 52-56 degree's"
531469,fishnut,2003-05-27 11:05:00,46,"Just got a note from Chamberlain Narrows that they are using a dif route (prob to avoid the rags). Do you know what's dif? Also as I am going up in 2 weeks, does anyone know how route to China, India lakes is? How about Wapeisi?Is the Birch Narrows you talk about north of the turn into Wapesi?Where is three Sisters? Perch Narrows?Thanks.If you prefer e-mail to [email protected]"
531470,Guest,2003-05-28 05:22:00,0,I did not try this year but I don't know if you will be able to go to china or india with out a small boat because it's real shallow getting there through Scaler. The other route to bypass the rags is going around Devils elbow which will add about 4 miles on your trip. Three sisters is the 2nd reef on your left going north through Bear Narrows. Hope this helps.
