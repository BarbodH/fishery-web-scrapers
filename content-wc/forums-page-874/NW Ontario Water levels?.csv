531597,Trailerguy,2003-05-27 15:48:00,1407,"I just returned from Wabaskang this PM, it is part of the Cedar River system, and is as low as I've ever seen it. However I fished several smaller lakes that are not part of a ""river system"", but rather are at or near the beginning of the watershed. These were about what I would call ""normal"", I've seen them a lot lower. Almost everything that is part of a river system is likely to be low until suificant rains fall. However low water seems to bring with it a good bite. They are in the same depth water as normal, but obviously your faverite spots may be too shallow and the eye's are holding in a new area. It was very calm all week-end, but we found the eye's on the shade, at about 8'of water and an awesome bite."
531598,Steve CO,2003-05-28 10:09:00,267,Reports from our outfitter in Minaki is that water levels are at an all-time low. We might not even be able to take our boats up the small stream that connects the two lakes we usually fish. These lakes are up by the Woodland Caribou Park in NWO and are pretty much at the top of the river system. Hope we get some rain before we go in two weeks.
