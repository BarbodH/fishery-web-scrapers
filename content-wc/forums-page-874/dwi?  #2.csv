You may get asked if you have any live bait, alcohol, firearms and where you are going and maybe that's all...or you will get asked if you've been arrested, or fingerprinted. Rolling the dice involves risk. I got asked two years in a row: the first year was a nightmare and last year I just whipped out the form I got from immigration and he looked at it and said have a nice day...and I did.Good luck, whatever you decide to do."
