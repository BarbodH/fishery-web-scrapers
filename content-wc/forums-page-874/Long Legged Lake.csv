531573,Guest,2003-05-26 17:53:00,0,"I saw them at the Milwaukee Canada show 2 years ago and was also wondering if anyone had gone there. My impression was that the walleye fishing in Long Legged was poor, but that the pike and lake trout was good. They now have a road that you can drive all the way to them. Hope someone can comment that has been there."

Sizes were comparable to Lac Seul but numbers not as high. We used bottom bouncers mostly, along with jigs with minnows in about 20' when they were stacked on a point. Lake trout were fun. Bring very large blue blade baits and a stiff rod with no-stretch line. You can also troll for them if you have about 6 oz. of bottom bouncer or a diver. The lake trout show up well on your electronics. We didn't catch any muskie, but the owner of the south camp caught a bunch on the rocks.A pretty good trip but pricey. We stayed at the north lodge and could not get through the narrows to get the south lakes. But for a four day stay, the north lake was enough."

I would be very interested in hearing about this road that has been put in to the lodge. When we were there, they met us at a bridge on a logging road and were motored in."
