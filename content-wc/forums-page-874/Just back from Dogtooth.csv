Fishing was tough depending on what you were fishing for,eater walleyes were hard to come by.Most of the walleyes we caught were 21 to 26 inches my best was 28.5. We fished mostly thru Kilvert,getting up the creek is really slow the water is so low.Lots of props and lower unit damage at least six units went down while we were there.The water temp 58 to 63 degrees. Buy your bait at the Pro Shop in Nestor Falls he doesn't count them out one at a time and the price is right.I'm sure the fishing will pick up,their not jumping in the boat but it sure beats working.
