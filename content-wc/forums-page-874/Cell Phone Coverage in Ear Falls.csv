Because it is such a big lake, I would like to have my cell phone along just in case. Any help would be appreciated.Otts"
531582,Guest,2003-05-27 15:00:00,0,Do a search on verizon cell phone. There were some posts about using cell phones in the Ear Falls area. Verizon will work there if you have canada added to your package. I doubt that you will get coverage in sawmill. If they don't get rain it won't matter as there isn't much water in sawmill now.
