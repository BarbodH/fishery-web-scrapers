6604900,Pooch,2021-10-21 11:30:00,4618,"I think the All Canada Shows were dying in the early 1990s.There are far fewer of them today. Internet killed them along with the cost of travel gong, paying a union guy to set up your folding table and hang your banners, etc.. All of the camps we used back then stopped going after a couple years as the return on investment netted few bookings."
6604908,Camoclad,2021-10-21 12:01:00,628,"This is on point, I have a trip scheduled and cannot find a 6th member to round out the group. We have a solid core of guys who make our trips but had one of our upcoming trip (was for 2019 but now 2022) members pass away and it has been tough to get someone else to step in."
6604910,Walleye2242,2021-10-21 12:01:00,263,We use to go to all canada show every year. For us...i could spend time with my dad and gramps and also friends. Was a way for us to talk about canada in the middle of winter as we drove to the show. We usually knew where we were going though for the next year. I loved collecting brochures as a kid and reading them all. Would keep them all year and get them out and look them over. I will go again this year as I am 50 now but still have that young heart and love. I know where I am going next year but will buy a ticket and walk around and talk with past camp owners that I have visted over the years.
6604918,RichA$1970,2021-10-21 12:24:00,1159,Fully agree with you as I already 2 trips planned but nice to get out in the dead winter and at least dream of being up there.
6604942,Bill Krejca,2021-10-21 15:16:00,6107,"Re: Folks in group dropping out(or just dropping). It is true that age takes a toll on the folks going up. A partial answer is to start taking up a youngster to insure continuance of an ever changing group. This fall, one of the 14 year old sons went with us,and he had a great time, in other years other youngsters came along. Going with, depending on age may result in some amount of extra work for the dad, but what a way to enjoy, and to create memories which linger way after Dad's time north has ceased. I personally have brought up a bunch of young lads over the years, many of which are still going up, my son and his best friend, being among them, these guys did the driving this fall. Paying it forward does have its benefits, too!! Bill"
6604944,Walleye2242,2021-10-21 15:35:00,263,When I was a kid and my dad brought me up and other dad's brought their kids....the rule for the group was....the dad paid for his trip and then 1/2 of his kids...the rest was divded up between the group. this was fine with all the guys in the group and it took away maybe too much of a finacial burden that might take away from bringing up your kid. That is just the way the older guys in the group handled it long ago.
6605102,jambi,2021-10-22 10:08:00,504,"I bring four to six guys from Oklahoma each year. As of now there is only one of us that has the shots to cross the border. I dont have dates for next year because of this, I am loosely tied to a group that is also struggling to put a trip together. Hopefully the share a seat board is full i may need to tag along with someone. I cant go another year without Ontario. I do have an Alaska trip planned so that is good."
6605206,Pooch,2021-10-22 18:56:00,4618,"Vaccine reluctance has taken a toll on all groups, I have seen a re-shuffling of guys within our own groups and talking to others it appears to be common. Once a new group forms it probably doesn't revert back to the old group. Groups spin off and morph ever since I've been going to Canada. I'm glad I'm part of several groups. Almost like investing.... spread your risk of missing a year. Pooch"
6605258,Wawajake,2021-10-23 05:27:00,413,I agree fully !!!
6605324,LoDo,2021-10-23 08:13:00,721,"My dad got me into this experience at a young age. I think I was 8 when i visited Lake of the Woods for the first time. Every year since outside Covid years I've visited Canada to fish. We met a few other cabin owners this fall near our cabin. They couldnt believe how young we were. I'm 42. The other owners are late 30s, early 40s. The cabin owners we met in/around our area are late 60s and 70s. They asked us how we got a group together to build this cabin. Why are you guys doing this? Very surprised, yet excited to hear this experience hasn't died. Like you'll on this site, most families with young kids look for the All Inclusive, pool, Wi Fi, experience. Us guys that own this camp are going the other way. Wi Fi for emergency use, no All Inclusive, pool, etc... Has this vacation/experience plateaued? Yes, however as US population continues to grow (90m+ since 1990) at the rapid pace its growing, there will always be growth with this vacation."
6604812,Bill Krejca,2021-10-21 06:01:00,6107,"I expect less ""what happened this trip"" posts over the winter, due to the reduction this year (and last) because of border closing. In the past, folks sometimes get too busy immediately after their trip north, but find time to share their trip experiences later during the winter slow time. Since so many did not go this shortened season, it appears posts have already slacked off. 'Jis sayin'. Bill"
6604822,LOWrider,2021-10-21 07:06:00,40,"I've noticed the lack of posts too. For us since the border has opened we've been busy both enjoying being back on the lake and working on all the cottage projects that we've dreamt up over the last 18 months. I like reading the trip recap posts so I'll put one out there for others that may like reading them as well. So far we've made 4 trips across the border. There has been lots of info on the mechanics of border crossing, I'll avoid all the details and just say they've been really easy. However two weeks ago I got selected for the random test. Border agent hands me the blue box and says follow directions'  see ya later! No problem  except the camera on my phone stopped working so the nice folks at Switch Health couldn't see me circle my nostrils for 15 seconds. After some reattempts she just made a note on her computer she couldn't visually verify. The only thing I can say is that she didn't think there would be a drop box for the completed tests in Rainy River because it is so small (she was wrong it is right next to the highway). I'm betting there are drop boxes close to every crossing. On to the fishing  generally speaking it has been really good, but unpredictable. Water temps have been pretty consistently higher than expected, and we couldn't always count on mid lake summer spots or a fall patterns. It all depended on the day and area we were fishing, but we always found good fishing just by being flexible. I'm learning that wind has a far greater impact than I ever gave it credit on LOW  but for unexpected reasons. Wind on the large open bodies of water can actually reverse or enhance currents to a degree that fish seem to be in spots on windy days just because of the current fluctuations. On a very windy day one narrow area we tried actually had current flowing backwards, and on that given day the fish were piled in along a shoreline that hasn't produced since. I've never considered the wind impact on currents, just tried to get out of the wind to find fishable spots. Water levels remain low, and algae growth was high in many areas, but never really seems to impact anything. Weather has been turning colder, shot a few ducks and getting things ready for ice season. Really looking forward to that."
6604848,Bakefish,2021-10-21 08:35:00,1077,"Not to be disrespectful, but I think there are fewer posts because of the heavy handedness of the mods during the border shutdown."
6604850,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-21 08:39:00,8293,Partially. Some posters also showed their true colors and reasons for being here.
6604856,pjshorthorn,2021-10-21 09:09:00,5654,"Nah....the Mods have just been enforcing the site rules that are clearly outlined. Keeping the “ naughty kids “ in line by putting them in a short time out , or a nuked thread, is a mild way of keeping things from spinning out of control where folks still do want to frequent this site for good information.Yep, I’m sure I have skirted the edge of being put in “time out “many a time, which is a me problem, but I respect the process that the site continues to monitor daily so we do have a site like this to visit and learn from.The way I see it......this site is no different than Facebook with the exception of one thing. The Mods on this site are not paid and do it voluntarily. On Facebook, they have an entire paid group on staff to monitor posts that do not conform to the site’s rules.Just some random thoughts on the subject.....not that they are correct by any stretch of my feeble imagination.PjShorthorn"
6604864,RichA$1970,2021-10-21 09:50:00,1159,"I think the numbers are dwindling. Covid was a major setback but look at the camps and docks and >80% of who I see grew up with Vinyl records, pumping leaded has, drinking from a garden hose and 3:2 beer just to date ourselves. It’s so special to be up there but the future wave wants All Inclusive, WiFi, health club and other BS (probably a Participation Trophy) that I don’t see a backfill replacing the originals who no longer can hack the journey due to age. When I was up there this September a guy asked the owner if he’s doing the All Canada Show and he said for the expense and he’s got Covid carryovers it’s not feasible. This is a great forum to hear other's trips, experiences and thoughts along with meeting some people. I enjoy reading this site in the fall tree stand to pass time and after deer season then it’s a slow crawl to ice out."
6604866,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-10-21 10:12:00,358,There's less and less of the old timer crews. Who's gonna fill their shoes?.
6604884,Yellowfin123,2021-10-21 10:45:00,2182,"another thing i always notice is all the infrastucture everywhere no matter where you go, bull shoals lake in akansas, still has old wooden docks everywhere that fit the boats of the old days, 6ft wide, east into tenn, kentucky,, down in arkanasas, north into minnesota and on up into canada, all the resorts and lodging on those 100's of lakes is older than dirt, its like the older boys went overseas, whipped everybody, came home and started the good life on all the lakes, and by 1975 all the building stopped"
6604890,Eckohlt,2021-10-21 11:00:00,3685,"I'm hoping everyone is saving the good stuff for the dead of winter,if not we'll get something going on in here.There are plenty of clever minds on this site"
6604898,griff,2021-10-21 11:21:00,40,"Speaking of which...Mr. Eckohlt, we are still awaiting a very detailed trip report(s) from your trip(s) this fall."
