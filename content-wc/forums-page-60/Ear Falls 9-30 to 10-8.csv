Caught some very nice walleyes and pike just not in numbers like the past. At least we didn't have to deal with snow this time. Crossing the board was a piece of cake. Just make sure you have all your documents. Shout out to Collin at Little Canada Camp for the hospitality.

6603778,SteveZ,2021-10-15 09:27:00,271,It was about a foot low. Not much flow coming out of the dam.

Pink jig, big minnows was the lure of choice. No trolling, no rapalas, no crank baits, etc.. None of it worked. You had to get deep and practically vertical jig. We caught enough to eat and take home. Numbers were def down for Ontario fishing. Our trip was 50/50 work and fish. Cabin is almost ready."
