6602622,7 Mag,2021-10-10 12:55:00,1887,Going to the Moosehorn Lodge the end of August and i'm looking for suggestions for a new Muskie rod/reel. Thanks!
6602654,Riding high,2021-10-10 17:04:00,69,I don't think for the money there's any better rod then tackle industries. All around rod would be the med heavy. And reel the shimano tranx is the best I've found. The 400 is perfect fit for that rod.

6602724,Larry S,2021-10-11 06:44:00,665,7 MAG Go to Muskie Central on the Message Board and ask same question You probably will get a lot more answers to your question
6602736,prov1800,2021-10-11 07:29:00,5010,If money is not a object I suggest looking at the Chaos rods.I had a chance to use them a few weeks ago with a couple i had out on Eagle.Will say those rods were the lightest I've ever felt.They had 2 each mounted with tranx reels.think they mentioned 350 US for each rod.So reels and rods add up.Off course st Croix has a great line up as well.Go check them all out throughout the winter.You will have a great time at moosehorn.I have some buddies that guide there and they all will take good care of you unless your on your own.You will have to trailer daily for muskie fishing to either Lac Suel or Big Vermilion.
6602802,7 Mag,2021-10-11 10:19:00,1887,Thanks i'll check them out.
6602804,7 Mag,2021-10-11 10:20:00,1887,"Thanks Larry, i forgot there's a muskie central."
6602810,7 Mag,2021-10-11 10:28:00,1887,"Thanks John i appreciate the rod/reel advice! I'm not much of a muskie fisherman so i am planning a one day guided trip to Lac Suel with my boat. As of now i'm planning to walleye fish Pelican, Abram, etc. by myself, really looking forward to it."
6602830,prov1800,2021-10-11 11:44:00,5010,Great area.Great fishing.Definatly be carefull boating on those waters.Hopefully the water will be higher at that time of the year and you will be able to run the Abram shutter to get into minitaki
