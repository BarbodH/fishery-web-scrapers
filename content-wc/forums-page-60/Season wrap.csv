6605030,Wallguy123,2021-10-22 05:19:00,13,How late do you usually keep your boat out?
6605098,prov1800,2021-10-22 09:55:00,5010,Depends on bookings.Not many fisherman up now.Few muskie guys but iam done for the year.Just put my boat away and getting my deer hunt going.We are going below 0c now.So would need to be a hardy fisherman now.Next week has some decent looking days but I'll be in the bush.Ice fishing will be next.
6605136,Eckohlt,2021-10-22 12:52:00,3685,"I'm hardy,and not the hardy from laurel n hardy"
6605148,prov1800,2021-10-22 14:04:00,5010,i have a canoe ready to go
6605150,Eckohlt,2021-10-22 14:15:00,3685,"With a canoe you can really sneak up on the fish,almost grab them with your bare hands"
6605634,NM_Trout,2021-10-24 19:04:00,1094,"Man... for a crappy year, with a short timeframe to get up to Canada, this sure went by fast. Good riddance to this one. Here's hoping 2022 is a lot, lot better."
6605712,prov1800,2021-10-25 06:19:00,5010,Here's hoping.must say the month we had was good.But looking forward to a full year.
6603584,prov1800,2021-10-14 10:50:00,5010,Many places to choose from.Cedar good but maybe to busy for you.Next year will be busier again.Lots of time to look around.
6603594,Eckohlt,2021-10-14 13:04:00,3685,"Well busy or not,not all places stay open into oct so sometimes you can't be to choosy,I would give cedar a go,lots of good reviews,your probably the best source of info .We may never see weather again like we did this year first week of oct."
6603596,prov1800,2021-10-14 13:18:00,5010,It was definatly some beautifull weather.Still used sunscreen lol.Can remember some other October's like that.Your right.lots of places close.And not that busy then.Variety of fish lake trout across hwy.heaven to me
6603708,Bigtaproot,2021-10-14 19:51:00,900,Sounds like a great season
6603710,prov1800,2021-10-14 19:58:00,5010,Been a amazing ride for a year and a half.Had a amazing month and a half after the border opened.lol.Glad I got to experience it but hope it doesn't happen again.
6603712,prov1800,2021-10-14 20:00:00,5010,Keystone was closed in October I know that.Was closed last time I went by there
6604232,prov1800,2021-10-17 08:45:00,5010,Everything goes in and out either on my back or on a sleigh.Gets cold here so i like to be comfortable as do my hunting guests.So bring in heaters that run off of 20 lbs propane bottles and chairs.No tv yet.Allthough theres cell service and can catch a football game if you like.I just like watching the wildlife that usually shows up.my new Browning sniper seems to have some good trigger speed capturing a blue Jay in mid air.
6604418,prov1800,2021-10-18 18:23:00,5010,Well I didn't get the boat put away.Glad it was ready to go.Went out on cèdar today for some muskie and walleye.Weather just beautifull so had to go.Thumb is prettý decent but tender.Can cast and retreive no problem.Saw 3 fish.2 small ones and pulled lure away on those and another decent fish but my lure got wrapped up in my line when it hit water.Followed it to the boat but was nust looking at it.Caught a small pike that had hooks in its Gullet tough time getting that out with one and a half hands.Walleyes really bit good and went through 3 dozen or so minnows in a hurry and then used my Vibrato to catch some more.Love the way they hit it so hard.walleyes I caught were in 25 ft.Smallies were fun to.Found lots in 13-15 ft really aggresivecon the vibrato to.Water temps have dropped to 55 f.Sure glad I never put my boat away.Needed a fishing fix.
6604422,Eckohlt,2021-10-18 18:50:00,3685,Looks like some place I ought to be now
6604428,prov1800,2021-10-18 19:04:00,5010,Didn't go far today from camp.Only boat out there today.Wont be any out tgere anymore this year.Fished 4 reefs all good.Few points also good.Fished a rock wall that has a flat out front about 12-16 ft about 75 yds long was loaded with smallies thats where I saw the muskies.Weather littke iffy looking next week but still pretty good.
6603360,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 18:20:00,3685,"Right at the south end of muskie narrows it looks like a resort, plenty of buildings n docks?"
6603378,prov1800,2021-10-13 18:57:00,5010,Cliff Lake your talking about.
6603380,prov1800,2021-10-13 19:00:00,5010,Nope.Didnt get drawn again.thats 16 years now.
6603382,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 19:08:00,3685,"Nope it's on cedar,it looks like you go past the turn into Clarks on the gravel road,but you keep going for along ways on gravel road I can see the place on google earth.maybe you don't know about it or they build it yesterday lol,just north of peep hole lake where the narrows start"
6603384,prov1800,2021-10-13 19:11:00,5010,Must be talking about keystone lodge.and further yet there are a dozen private cottages
6603434,Eckohlt,2021-10-14 03:43:00,3685,That's the one
6603476,prov1800,2021-10-14 07:34:00,5010,Glad we got that figured out. How was your trip
6603532,prov1800,2021-10-14 09:36:00,5010,Here are the deer I took last year.We had a good season and nice mild weather.Bit of snow to help sliding gear in some 500 yds and deer out.All big bush pretty remote hunts.
6603558,7 Mag,2021-10-14 10:07:00,1887,That's a nice buck! I've dragged a lot of deer out of the woods so i know how much work that was!
6603562,Eckohlt,2021-10-14 10:19:00,3685,"Trip to press lake was good but hot weather,it's a long trek on a gravel road back to the resort,very private place.fishing was good not great but good,average size was alittle small,but great owners and very well run,now I'm searching for new water for next oct,might try cedar or maybe give gull rock another shot"
6603278,prov1800,2021-10-13 14:25:00,5010,Well halfway through October and weather is starting to cool off and some rain.My thumb still kinda sore and with deer season iam going to put my boat away while the going is good.Had a great 2021 season and had a great run since border opened.Cant complain.Caught a few thousand walleyes and put 54 muskies in the net.Time to move on to deer season.Have some baits out and deer are already coming.Will be looking forward to that and will be back on here when the ice fishing starts.Got to love all the seasons.Catch you guys sometime in the new year.
6603284,RichA$1970,2021-10-13 14:48:00,1159,"Hope the thumb heals quick and although it probably wasn’t too hard for you, thanks for the posts on your time on the water while many of us were just dreaming on getting up to God’s Country. I hope next year you have to deal with a little more traffic from the sanctuary you had the past 2 seasons and everyone can enjoy the gifts of Sunset Country."
6603286,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 14:57:00,3685,John do you also get free bait for the deer?lol
6603288,7 Mag,2021-10-13 14:59:00,1887,Thanks for the all the reports and pictures John! Looking forward to some deer pictures!
6603290,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 15:00:00,3685,"I'm hoping to put a few thousand in the boat next year also,starting in June then July then sept then oct,john is that a resort in Muskie bay on cedar or private place?"
6603324,prov1800,2021-10-13 16:42:00,5010,No.lol.Just bought 1000 lbs last week.Last me a while.Buddy from Madison will load up what he can to.
