6603450,Bigtaproot,2021-10-14 06:02:00,900,Take off 30 years and add 150 pounds and you are close. Does anyone know if the trades are hiring near Branson. Thinking of taking on some weekend work
6603570,Eckohlt,2021-10-14 10:31:00,3685,Probably for your fishing skills
6603612,Bigtaproot,2021-10-14 14:58:00,900,Here is a picture of my lady at work. She is a hard worker and knows how to handle a rod in her hands. I will look for a picture from the famous drinking fishing trip. Might convert some of the old folks on the board to party on their next trip!!
6603626,gbin,2021-10-14 15:40:00,1384,"Not likely! She feels bad for the fish I catch and the game I shoot because of whatever suffering they might experience. Eats them happily enough, though.Gerry"
6603632,Yellowfin123,2021-10-14 16:14:00,2182,lololol that was classic big root
6602328,sheepman,2021-10-08 18:48:00,98,"Big Tap, I had a meats class in college and to this day I gag when my teeth snap trough a natural casing on a dog or hit a bone chip in ground product, I know what you mean. Unless people have been through multiple packing plants they cannot relate. If you work there daily booze helps the cause."
6602954,Bigtaproot,2021-10-11 20:06:00,900,Sheep Thanks for the kind words. The old lady and I eloped in high school and never finished. Would keep the same gal but would have finished high school if I had it to do again. Have always wanted a class ring
6602956,Bigtaproot,2021-10-11 20:07:00,900,Fin man sounds like a real fun guy to hang out with
6603218,Bigtaproot,2021-10-13 09:03:00,900,I think the voting is now closed. I will gladly accept the second place trophy for alcohol consumption during a one week fishing trip. Next year we are going for the record
6603220,Bigtaproot,2021-10-13 09:04:00,900,i disagree as it is possible that you could be on the trip!!
6603228,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 09:29:00,3685,"Hope you break that record cause that's what this site is all about,see who can drink themself's to death.good luck n hope your around next year to give the report."
6603234,gbin,2021-10-13 10:12:00,1384,Found a video snippet online of Bigtaproot and his lady on one of their fishing trips. She's pretty!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WiiPrOtAFIGerry
6603248,Eckohlt,2021-10-13 11:39:00,3685,"Always have liked liz shut,I would shut drinking down for her.lol"
6603250,Bigtaproot,2021-10-13 12:03:00,900,"If my old lady looked like her i would not be: 1. hanging out on a walleye fishing board 2. working at a pork processing plant I will be honest, when the old lady hits the scale, you just hear a thud. I am no carry grant myself but i do know how to drink, fish, hunt and play the market"
6603262,Ricky Spanish,2021-10-13 13:05:00,1298,If I hadn't pawned mine to buy a bag of weed soon after graduation I'd give you mine.
6602044,FinmanPoozie,2021-10-07 17:06:00,696,Staying sh*t faced on a fishing trip? You can do that nonsense @home Not something I'd be bragging about!! I'm all about the fish on trips. Period. Happy fishing!

6602058,bbheli,2021-10-07 17:53:00,1387,Says who ?
6602078,goldman,2021-10-07 18:57:00,1036,"Meh. I hope you enjoyed yourself, that wouldn't be for me. I go fishing to enjoy the outdoors, the sunshine, the wildlife, and catching fish. This is Â“therapyÂ” for me. Alcohol has never left me any better off than when it found me. Or I it. Whatever."
6602080,Eckohlt,2021-10-07 18:58:00,3685,I'm getting sht faced just reading this
6602112,Bigtaproot,2021-10-08 05:07:00,900,"I like beer because it makes me a jolly good fellow. Listen, before you make any judgments, the old lady and I work at a pork processing plant. If you work there you would drink to"
6602174,Wallychowder,2021-10-08 08:48:00,1567,I'm all about Beer Battered walleye cooking in my outdoor fryer while chugging an ice cold Labatts Blue or 2 or 3 or 4 or more&#x1f923;
6602190,fishman10,2021-10-08 09:05:00,226,"Old lady and I, sounds like a great fishing trip! Nothing worse than looking at a drunkin old lady! A drinking competition on a fishing trip? &#x1f926;&#x1f926;"
6602254,Guest,2021-10-08 12:59:00,0,would anyone want to try to top that?

6601100,Eyesore,2021-10-03 16:33:00,455,I can't contribute a personal story but I remember a thread here on Walleye Central about 20 years ago of some guy who posted him and his buddies did a Canadian flyout and had the plane overloaded with beer. It took the pilot 3 or 4 attempts to get airborn. Send it!
6601106,NARDA 1,2021-10-03 17:38:00,636,There NARDA Group record at Birch Dale Lodge is 29 1 liter bottles. A photo of our dead soldiers of a later attempt at breaking our previous record.
6601120,Riding high,2021-10-03 18:40:00,69,He didn't say they drank it all. They just took that much with them.
6601404,Bigtaproot,2021-10-05 05:11:00,900,We did drink every drop of it and caught over 950 fish. I agree that alcohol can lead to problems but it is sure fun.
6601470,Bigtaproot,2021-10-05 08:27:00,900,"If you are ever in Branson, you can stay at our time share as the old lady and I want to party with you!!"

6602030,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2021-10-07 16:23:00,18,"Back in my younger days, there were 14 of us that took 2 65' houseboats on Lac Seul for a week. We stopped by the beer store on our way home, we had around $67 worth of deposit return. In the neighborhood of 1350 empty bottles. Sorry, I don't remember the exact numbers. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. In addition, I brought a case of Absolt vodka, there were a few 750's of Crown and other miscellaneous liquors. It was a **** of a week to say the least."
6602038,rebelrn2001,2021-10-07 16:37:00,1563,I refer to my wife as my wife.
6600988,Bigtaproot,2021-10-03 05:14:00,900,Old lady and I went to Old Post three years ago with another couple. 13 cases of beer and 4 750 of booze. That is our record. Can anyone top that?
6601006,Wallychowder,2021-10-03 06:00:00,1567,was it Budweiser zero ?
6601010,Clairebear,2021-10-03 06:09:00,937,Not sure why anyone would want to. You talking 6 packs or 24's?
6601012,Wallychowder,2021-10-03 06:17:00,1567,is this it ?
6601014,That Minnesota guy,2021-10-03 06:48:00,8293,"No, you are the king!! I can drink at home."
6601032,gbin,2021-10-03 08:22:00,1384,"I did all of my heavy drinking when I was a teenager. Now I aim to enjoy the drink rather than the drunk, and correspondingly consume far less.One of the things that taught me to ease up was spending years working as an orderly in nursing homes as a young man, reading the charts of the residents to stave off boredom during quiet times, and seeing that heavy alcohol use and the health problems it causes were very often the primary cause for their being there. Seems to me that cirrosis of the liver, dementia, etc. are the real prizes of informal drinking competitions.Gerry"
6601036,maddogg,2021-10-03 08:25:00,178,We usually spend our time fishing.
6601056,Wallychowder,2021-10-03 10:41:00,1567,"13 cases (24) is only approximately 12 beers a day for each person for 7 days ! Now the Hard stuff, I think they used for fish batter&#x1f923;"
