6602828,Hillbiehle,2021-10-11 11:17:00,66,Following as we have reservations for next August as well.
6602908,RichA$1970,2021-10-11 15:35:00,1159,June 11 for me. Wish the place would have burned this or last summer so they could rebuild it as it’s a tired outpost along with a fish cleaning house would be a huge plus compared to the little table on the dock.
6603036,Hillbiehle,2021-10-12 08:22:00,66,"I agree, it is past its prime. My first to Hornby was 1992 when the cabin was relatively new (hard to believe). I'm confident the new owners have every intention to upgrade at some point and I'll be excited to see that happen."
6603042,RichA$1970,2021-10-12 09:27:00,1159,They built a nice ramp walkway at Marvin that they need at Hornby based on the roots all over on the way to the ramp and docks. I wonder how many trip a/ fall a year there as if you are not paying attention it can happen. When I was there last they flew a chest freezer in and I still don’t know why. I’d rather see a real dinner table with chairs vs the old card table / folding chairs or a couch and or some new mattresses as it’s pretty much a box spring they have.
6604544,Pink Unicorn,2021-10-19 15:36:00,83,Hornby did not open for the 2021 season and I have no idea on updates to the cabin. Assuming with the loss of Daniel along with Keeper Lake and Pine Island outposts there will be no updates. They were flying in material to Keeper when I was up in Sept and trying to get that one built. Agree on the condition but it is a great lake!
6604556,TMF89,2021-10-19 16:56:00,77,"We'll be there the first week of August next year. Best fishing I've ever had on a fly-in, and I'll say that I've stayed in plenty worse, as far as cabins go. I know at least three of their cabins on other lakes burned down this year, that's why they didn't bother opening for the end of the season, too busy doing damage control."
6604654,RichA$1970,2021-10-20 07:43:00,1159,"I also enjoy Hornby, easy and good fishing. It is so sad on Daniel as he was a very nice man. I wish they flew out on Saturday/Sunday vs Mondays but understand their logic. Heading there early June and chartreuse is the key color for me there. So weird that it has been idle for 2 years so looking forward to it and the Beaver Dam lake which is an experience and great fishing. Always wanted to hike the 1/2 km to Culvertson but easier said than done."
