6605300,eyecatcher1,2021-10-23 07:00:00,323,"I think that I've used that one if it's the one that I'm thinking of, but it's on Abram Lake."
6605304,prov1800,2021-10-23 07:17:00,5010,Yes that one is on Abram.Good launch.Hopefully we get some higher water levels next year.

Even made it twice this fall after the border opened in August. The main lodge is on an private island about a quarter mile or so from the landing. The cabins are all very modern and the location is perfect whether you are there from early spring fishing up to late fall. Reach out to Troy and he will get you set up. Happy to answer any questions you might have. Good luck!
6605052,RLundin,2021-10-22 07:51:00,22,I have a friend that is wanting to go to Winoga Resort on Abram Lake (close to Sioux Lookout Ontario) next Summer. I am traveling from North Carolina so its a pretty good commitment. Does anyone have experience with this resort or fishing this chain of lakes?
6605078,Skywagon,2021-10-22 08:46:00,1106,Check your private messages.
6605092,prov1800,2021-10-22 09:47:00,5010,They run a good place.Fishing in the whole Sioux lookout area is great.
6605122,eyecatcher1,2021-10-22 12:04:00,323,"I have never been to Winoga, but a friend really likes it there. As said before, you can't go wrong on any lakes in that chain. I've been going there for about 30 years now."
6605132,prov1800,2021-10-22 12:37:00,5010,Winogas main lodge is on a island short way from there main base on shore on Abram Lake which has vreat fishing.Access is through the shutters into Minnitaki lake can also access Pelican lake and if water is high (if) you can run through pelican falls and access Lac Suel but mainly have to trailer there.They have a great place and take care of you.
6605142,eyecatcher1,2021-10-22 13:55:00,323,"I was up there last week and my resort didn't recommend running the Abram Chute into Minnitaki yet due to the low water. I fished at the bottom of the Chute a couple of times and never saw a boat run the Chute which was odd. Then again, there weren't many boats on the lakes at all. I guess that everyone is moose hunting now."
6605146,prov1800,2021-10-22 14:03:00,5010,there is a public launch on minnitaki
6605162,eyecatcher1,2021-10-22 15:29:00,323,"I didn't know that. Where is it? We caught plenty of fish on Abram and Pelican, but it would be good to know where there's a ramp on Minnitaki just in case."
6605166,prov1800,2021-10-22 16:07:00,5010,Ima not absolutly sure of the rd you go down as i dont pay much attention but iam pretty sure its Drayton Rd.Good sized area to launch and gets you past the shutters.Also the ice rd is there in the winter.
6605262,Skywagon,2021-10-23 05:34:00,1106,"The boat landing to Minnitaki is the first road to the east, 1/4 mile south of the Hudson junction on highway 72, the road is marked as a boat landing."
