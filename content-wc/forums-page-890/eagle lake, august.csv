Anyone give me any tips on what to exspect fishing wise.I understand the Walleye,Muskie,Smallmouth fishing should be pretty good that time of year! I hope so.Any tips? I like to cast, any river inlets or outlets I should be looking for? Or would weed beds be better? :) dutchboy"
529145,Guest,2003-03-31 06:42:00,0,That time of year the fish will be deep relating to underwater structure such as reefs and sunken islands. You'll want to concentrate on those areas in August. The fish can be schooled so sometimes one has to move around alot to find the active fish. River mouths and inlets probably won't produce much. Those are early season spots and by August the fish will be out deeper in their summer patterns.
529146,Guest,2003-03-31 07:52:00,0,What part of Eagle Lake. Were are you staying?
529147,catchNrelease,2003-03-31 11:26:00,157,"I've fished Eagle in August the last 3 years. Let me know what part your staying at and I might have a few GPS coordinates that will help. I'll be there again this August 17th - 23rd. I agree with last post, most walleyes we caught were in 22-32ft of water holding onto structure. Let me know what lodge you're staying at.C&R"
529148,dutchboy,2003-03-31 14:14:00,5717,"Thanks for the replys,I'm staying at Sportsmans Lodge the week of August 9th.I should have stated the Walleyes are LOW priority on this trip.I'll be fishing for Pike,Muskie and Bass mostly. ( BTW is it against the law to list Walleyes as low priority?):) dutchboy"
529149,catchNrelease,2003-03-31 14:41:00,157,"Where on the Lake is Sportsman's Lodge? Bass, through any type\color crankbait at anyone of the 7,000 islands, you'll have luck. To catch Pike try to fish for Walleye:) Let me know where on the lake your at. I fish mainly north, Temple Bay, Portage Bay, Viking Reef areas. Have a buddy who hits Eagle for Musky with great success. He's helped me with locations on the map for fishing those."
529150,dutchboy,2003-03-31 15:06:00,5717,LOL I don't know where it is!!!:) It's west of the main lake it looks like. The directions say 30 miles west of Dryden on 17 to Hanslip road.It looks like it's an arm off the main lake. :)dutchboy
529151,Guest,2003-03-31 15:14:00,0,"That would be in the Vermillion Bay or Waldhof Bay area, nearly centrally located on Eagle. Fishing Hotspots Maps have detailed maps of Eagle. I think they do two maps that cover the entire lake.Good luck...have not fished Eagle for a few years, after many years of fishing there."
529152,Guest,2003-04-01 06:18:00,0,"I would highly recommend picking up a copy of Dick Pearsons book ""Muskies on the Shield"". He details the type of water you will be on and strategies that will work....for musky that is. Another suggestion would be to keep an eye out for weed beds...on flat calm mornings or evenings look for the tips of cabbage weed protruding from the surface. You can discover a lot of good areas to fish for both northern and musky by just paying attention...some of these weed beds will be in areas that are not obvious. The deeper weed beds would be my recommendation.....not the back end of shallow stuff...access to deep water is critical for big fish at that time of year. Don't overlook rock and reef structures as well....there is plenty to choose from...good luck."
529153,dutchboy,2003-04-01 08:34:00,5717,That's the type of info i'm looking for .Thanks guys!! :)
