I am going the first week in June and am always searching for the bigger post spawn females. Last year I identified a likely site.The main in flow to the lake is a creek about 6-10 feet across. It has formed a shallow bay/delta 6-8 feet deep of soft bottom mud that stretches for 1/2 mile either side (and out from the shore) of the main creek inlet. Last year while trolling across the delta we picked up 3 large Northerns over 36 inches in less than an hour. I also found that if I followed the creek towards the main lake bed the creek bed cut through the delta and was deeper (12-14 feet). My question is should I work this deeper area for bigger walleyes. Is it more likely they cleared out entirely of the area and would be found further away....ie a beach that is 1/2-3/4 mile away.If I work the deeper channel should I be bottom bouncing...jigging...trolling? What do you guys think? Good place to look or should I find a hard bottom further away?Bob"

FISH ON."
