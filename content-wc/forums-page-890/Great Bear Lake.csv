529445,Guest,2003-04-04 10:41:00,0,I was wondering if anyone has ever fished great Bear Lake in the NWT. I have fished Great Slave lake for the past three years and am looking to try something new just what some info on how people have done up there.

529447,Guest,2003-04-04 13:55:00,0,"I am currently researching the N.W.T. for a trip in 2004 and the fishery by all accounts looks incredible and well protected. Besides the Great Lakes, Great Bear is the largest freshwater lake in the world. It seems that Great Bear receives substantially less pressure than Great Slave, yet both produce trophy fish in vast numbers. I am very interested in the trophy pike fishing on Great Slave I would love to hear your thoughts about it based on your last 3 trips.Chromer"

If you are going up there make sure you bring a big enough rod and reels. I used a heavy heavy flippin stick with 80lb. test with 50lb leader, sounds overboard but thats what you need. Not saying little stuff catches fish but I'd sure be kickin myself if caught one over 50lbs. and broke off. email me your addy and I'll send you my maps of Great Bear, don't think I'll go back."
