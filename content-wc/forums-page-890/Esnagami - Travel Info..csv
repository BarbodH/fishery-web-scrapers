Never paid attention to fueling places along the route when traveling before - stupid me. Based on the fololowing route, could anyone help me out with good information. Truck range is about 500 miles, give or take a few miles. From Sault Ste. Marie - Rt. 17 North through Pancake Bay, Wawa, to White River. From White River - Rt. 631 North through Hornepayne to Rt. 11 West. Rt. 11 West through Longlac to Rte. 584 North through Geraldton to Nakina (on Rt. 643)."

Therefore, where you fill up mostly determined by time you are driving thru. SSMarie to Nakina approx. 465 miles. Am certain the following have diesel - the only question is hours of operation : Wawa - Driftwood travel centre (705) 856-2299 White River - Husky (807) 822-2441 Geraldton - Dan's General Store (807) 854-0600 I'm sure that diesel is also available in Hornepayne and Longlac, but don't have the names in my files. I'd suggest you call and find out who will be open when you will be going thru (learned that the hard way about 10 years ago)."

That puts us in Nakina somewhere between 4:00 and 6:00 pm. That means we do all of out traveling through Ontario during the daylight hours, so fueling up during closed hours should be no problem."
