529201,PJM,2003-04-01 21:36:00,3516,JohnL The resort is in a nice location and docking and cabins are nice but the guy who runs it was not very friendly when we were there. Buena Vista is nice and I have been over to Mylie's to get gas and both resorts will tell you where people are catching fish. I have never stayed at Mylie's but the people are friendly.
