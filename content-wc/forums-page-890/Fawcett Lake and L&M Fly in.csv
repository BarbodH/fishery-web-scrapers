528627,Karl,2003-03-17 14:03:00,63,"I can't understand why no one has replied. Fawcett Lake is one of the best lakes for walleye (and BIG walleye) in NW Ontario. I have never been there myself (have been to Blackstone Lake), but I know about the lake because Pickerel Arm Camps (based in Sioux Lookout) also has a cabin on Fawcett Lake. It's their most sought after lake of nine outpost lakes they have. My info is from people fishing in mid-June thru July. Your trip is very early in the season, so fishing locations/presentations are not going to be the same. Bring neoprene gloves. Good chance at some trophy northerns????Good fishin......"
528628,Guest,2003-03-18 10:45:00,0,Bring your ice drill and tipups!
528629,lobo1,2003-03-18 23:56:00,734,"no kidding........!! We got ""iced out"" of a trip last year in the last week of May - not too much further north than your area.Good luck on the melt. I'm hard headed and booked the last week of May again myself so my fingers are crossed too.lobo1"
528630,Guest,2003-03-19 16:23:00,0,"ThanksIce out is always something to consider at that time of year, but I was told that a river flows through the portion of the lake that we will be staying, so I hope that means that I don't have anything to worry about.?."
528631,Karl,2003-03-20 12:45:00,63,"Last year planes couldn't land at Fawcett until about June 1st. The outfitter I stay with had to cancel the first two parties going into Fawcett (and Springpole and Blackstone). They couldn't even land in Sioux Lookout until after May 21st. The Cat River didn't (doesn't) make any difference when it stays as cold as long as it did last year.But last year was the latest ice-out in at least the 11 years I've been up there, so I'm statistically guessing that ice out isn't going to be as late this year."

MY CANCELLED TRIP LAST YEAR WAS ON A BIG RIVER SYSTEM. LAST YEAR WAS RARE - DON'T START WORRYING YET, I'D SAY THE ODDS ARE 80/20 IN YOUR FAVOR THAT YOU'LL BE FISHING.lobo1"

528634,ChuckD,2003-04-03 10:48:00,1581,"I use Land M every year. Great people been to Fawcett two years ago right after opener. Walleye fishing was great on the points. Largest was almost 28"". We caught 2 pike around 40"""
