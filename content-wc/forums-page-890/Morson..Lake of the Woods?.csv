529099,Pacific Blue Marlin,2003-03-28 11:07:00,1,Does anyone have any info on the best resorts in Morson. I want the best and dont care about the price. I want to sit on the reefs in July and catch those big walleye I keep hearing about.
529100,Guest,2003-03-28 11:34:00,0,"Mylie's Place Resort and Buena Vista are both nice resorts based in Morson. There also are a few nice island resorts in that part of the lake that are based out of Morson. See the LOTW website for more info and contacts. If you're looking for ""deluxe"" accomodations you might be better off looking at resorts in a different part of the lake. The Morson resorts are clean, well-maintained fisherman's lodges, but they don't exactly have country club furnishings. But, they have courteous staffs and they will put you on the fish. Good luck."

Great Place! It's not crystal and lace, but they know how and when to catch fish. Look up their website, I don't have it book marked on this pc, but it's worth hunting for. They have a list of hundreds of wallyes caught over 4.5lbs last year and when they were caught. I wouldn't put too much stock in ""where"" they were caught, but you can get an idea of when they bit best last year. Ideally June 10 through August 1. Best year ever last year."

Just another fishermen have another good time catching fish without high prices of staying at resort, cause so much in your price has nothing to do woth fishing."
