529320,Guest,2003-04-02 14:32:00,0,How soon will the ice be off the lakes in NW Ontario? How soon do fisherman start showing up to fish for walleyes and northerns in NW Ontario?
529321,River_eye,2003-04-02 16:34:00,1486,"Ice goes anywhere from the end of April to mid-May, probably closer to mid/early May this year depending on weather. The most popular time for Americans to come up is starting the first week of June. Nice weather, not too cold, not too hot, and not many mosquitos and good fishing."
529322,Tom,2003-04-02 20:18:00,1063,I would plan on going anytime from early june to early july. June being better. Depends on where your going.
