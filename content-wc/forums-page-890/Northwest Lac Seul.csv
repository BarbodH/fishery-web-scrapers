529323,Guest,2003-04-02 14:41:00,0,"Thought I would switch things up a bit and ask a question about fishing Lac Seul. I will be at Evergreen at the end of June and being a first timer would appreciate any help I can get.Are there places relatively close to Evergreen where one can catch some ""eyes""? Or is it going to be a lengthy boat ride?What size jigs should I be looking to get? Any particular crankbaits you would recommend?Thanks for the info - Keep on reelin"

There are rock reefs on both sides of the river on each side of the bridge. I'd say roughly a 1/4 mile boat ride from the dock, Gary will have some spots marked on the map that arn't too far away and you won't get lost. Jig size mostly 1/4 and 3/8 will do the trick. For a real adventure, book Gary to guide you a day or two."
529325,Guest,2003-04-02 15:26:00,0,"You don't have to go far from Evergreen to find walleyes. The camp is on the river (which holds fish) and it's less than two miles to the main lake. If the waves aren't too big, you can get to lots of good spots relatively quickly. Gary will help you.As far as the right size of jig and what crankbait...I wouldn't know. We caught all the walleyes we wanted (and enough over the slot to keep it interesting) with a spinner/crawler combination. Good numbers from 8 to 12 FOW off points and sandy shorelines; bigger fish from slightly deeper water and mid-lake humps. Our group was there the first week of July last year. Good luck. You've made a great choice."

529327,Dave,2003-04-02 20:16:00,258,im goin there at the same time too but at Golden pines. I'v been to lac seul once before. Had a lot of luck with yellow jibs 1/4 or 3/8. We also used feather jigs too. We used bottom bounces also seemd to hook a few more with jigs though.
529328,Guest,2003-04-03 05:57:00,0,We'll look you up as we are also from Wisconsin. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions!
529329,Guest,2003-04-03 07:34:00,0,"I used to live in Ear Falls so I know Lac Seul quite well. It is a huge body of water that was created by a hydro electric dam, so watch for deadheads popping up all over the place. Last summer 2002, was a phenominal year for the lake, lots of walleye and big fish. Try fishing around Goose Island. There is an abandoned railway bridge 1/4 mile from Evergreen Lodge. Try there too. You may see my buddies 50ft houseboat 3 houses north of the bridge, we caught many fish off that boat. The lake has so many island and bays that giving directions would probably result in getting lost. You may have to rely on these islands and bays for relief from high winds that quite often occur on the lake. Just look for drop offs, sand bars, weed beds. Remember this is fishing in remote Canada, it ain't Rocket science..........Greg"
529330,Vitreum,2003-04-03 08:44:00,221,"you'll catch all the fish you want within 15-20 minutes of the camp. you really don't have to go that far. some guys like to run down the lake about an hour to the mckinzie bay area. i think they run over the top of millions and millions of walleye on the way. i like to fish and not boat ride, so i have never ventured that far. gary will help put you on fish. you'll be fine."
529331,Tom,2003-04-03 19:32:00,1063,Yellow is Lac Seul walleye fishing color right?
