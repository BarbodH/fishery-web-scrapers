528908,BGunn,2003-03-29 07:09:00,880,"I just returned from a trip to Nester Falls area (long ride for me...1400 miles!)We stayed at Muskie Bay Lodgehttp://www.muskiebayresort.com/Great people, and good food! My one buddy has been going there for 13 years straight. You can fish either Crow Lake, or LOW.Paul (the owner, and one of the guides)took us out on LOW one day, and we REALLY got into the walleyes! He said the area we were in, it was common for him, and another guide to put people on 100 Walleyes a day. Our group got well over fifty (Ice fishing) and one was a 28""er. (We threw back all the breeders).The only complaint I had was that we stopped at a bait shop in town and a SMALL scoop of minnows was $16.00 (Canadian). If that wasn't bad enough, at least 30% of them were Stickle-Backs that NOTHING would bite on!Other than that it was a super trip that I hope to repeat next March!"
528904,AL,2003-03-29 20:32:00,89,Had a less than favorable experience with Al.
528907,old fisherman,2003-03-31 16:16:00,545,No place prettier than White Fish Bay. We go in at Vic and Dot's and fish up towards Alfred's Inlet. The fishing has not been as good for sometime as it once was. Any thoughts? I love the place.
528896,bubbalou,2003-03-24 12:11:00,29,"We are heading up to Nestor Falls at the end of July. I would like to find a guide who is interested in helping me learn where and how to fish that area this time of the year. We have been fishing Sabaskong Bay for many years now during that time and the numbers and quality of fish has been going downhill really fast. We have had a little better luck on the south end of Whitefish Bay with quality and quantity but not what it should be. I would like to find a guide who doesn't have the ""screw the Americans"" attitude so my trip would be at least enjoyable. I am taking my teenage daughter and son along in hopes of maybe finding some better fish, they are tired of the dinks. I would love to take my own boat out if possible too. I have a few names but don't know anything about their personalities or ability to find fish. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

528906,Guest,2003-03-28 09:55:00,0,"Bubbalu? How far North into Whitefish did you get? As you can tell by my name, I fish Whitefish Bay all the time...more towards the south end. Just wondering if we could swap info. Drop me an email if you get a chance.[email protected]"
