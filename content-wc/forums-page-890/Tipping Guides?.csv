528797,Guest,2003-03-25 06:27:00,0,"I been guiding for 13 years now and still don't get tipped sometimes especially from guys with television shows, they think its enough of a tip just to fish with them, some of them I wonder how they even got tv show in the first place. but it all depends on where your guiding, if your guiding in NWT it wouldn't be unusual to get a 600.00 tip at the end of the trip but then again if you get a farmer from SD or someplace who's been saving up for 10 years just to get there (NWT) don't expect a huge tip from him cause he spent all his money on the lodge. Serious fishermen know how much and when to tip. Thats what I like about some guys, you can tell how serious they are by the gear the bring in the boat. If you have a guy with a Wal-Mart special rod, guides know what to expect then. Sometimes guests will ask whers the fish, lol were fishing for them now...lol they expect you to put them on a hungry school of fish first spot. If they don't know how to fish maybe they should put some practice into it like the rest of us. I was trolling one time and this guys couldn't set the hook and kept missing the fish, he would ask why are you running forward so fast when I get a bite, I said well I'm setting the hook for you believe it or not but he didn't miss anymore fish that day."
528798,Guest,2003-03-29 05:42:00,0,We usually do about $20 American for a half day of good fishing. More if it's a great half a day. Trout
528799,Guest,2003-03-29 09:21:00,0,I worked as a guide for years and took my stock market courses. I think a great way is just to give a signed blank cheque and get the guide to fill in the amount. Thats the way we do it with management expenses in mutual funds. It works great for me.
528800,Guest,2003-03-30 17:12:00,0,I don't tip because I feel that nowadays everybody wants a friggin' tip. Well...I've had it. The only people I will ever tip are waiters and bartenders. To the rest I say...get a real job if you don't like it.
528801,Guest,2003-03-31 05:50:00,0,"Mike, can see why maybe you've been burned by a guide. In my boat I'm the boss and what I say goes. Sometimes when I get a real good angler in my boat(guy that can catch walleye alone) I will let him check out the map and find a spot. But when I get a guy who always complains and is mouthy, well lets say I put a early end to the day. Some guys come up here to catch fish, and when you put them on fish their next complaint is where are the bigger fish, no making these guys happy expect a ****ty tip, actually the guest better be ready to eat walleye ##### in his fish and greasy potatoes and cold beans, so they will be going to shore all day in the bush with roll of toilet paper. Point is, tip your guide cause he had bad guest too and would love a true fisherman who knows what to tip for the occasion. Hope you don't plan on hiring a guide Mike, sounds like your a pro who doesn't need one or who doesn't get along with people."
528802,Guest,2003-04-01 15:56:00,0,"Point taken Harv,But you missed my point. Let me simplify it for you...yesterday I took a taxi to get my haircut. I tipped the cab driver...cause he expects a tip, then I tipped my barber...cause he expects a tip, then I took a cab back home and again tipped the driver...cause he expects a tip. Just as the taxi pulled away from my house, a UPS truck pulls up that had a package for me so I tipped the driver...cause he expected a tip too. Get it...nowadays everybody wants a tip. Well I say forget it. Waiters and bartenders...those are the only ones worthy of a tip. Besides, you guides charge enough as it is...and then you expect a tip on top of your overpriced rate!!! Ha, what a laugh. I'm no pro but I'm not stupid either Harv."
528803,River_eye,2003-04-01 17:25:00,1486,"Most guides work for a lodge and don't get paid what the lodge owner charges for them.It would not be worth it for me to be a guide if it weren't for the tips.I agree that the UPS driver shouldn't be tipped, and it's kind of iffy for the barber and the cab driver, but tips allow the really good guides and waiters to be rewarded for working harder. If guides weren't tipped, then the guide rates would be even higher, and the service wouldn't be as good, because what's the use of trying really hard if you are guaranteed a certain amount of money.Tipping gives you the power to make sure a guide get's paid exactly what you think he's worth."
528804,Guest,2003-04-01 19:11:00,0,"I will preface this my statement by saying that I usually tip guides, but, it makes me wonder when a guide states he is going to mix walleye $### into shorelunch because he is not expecting a tip."
528787,Mark_NE,2003-03-18 11:08:00,58,What do you consider a fair tip for a day long guide trip in Canada? Any ideas from guides as well a fishermen would be appreciated
528788,bbakes,2003-03-18 11:14:00,121,"I am on the guide side of this question. I would say the average daily tip is around 20-25 dollars. I have had many days of good fishing without a tip, and I have had many days of good fishing where I have been rewarded with $100-$300 tips. Also I think it all depends on how much the whole package costs. The lodges I have been guiding for have upped their price to around $250 a day. When I was guiding for $100 a day I was certainly getting more $50-$100 tips then nowadays."
528789,Mark_NE,2003-03-18 11:24:00,58,"Bret,Is that per person or per group of 2-3?"
528790,bbakes,2003-03-18 11:39:00,121,"Per boat full. I usually am guiding 2 people. I guess if I had 3 in the boat and we hammered the fish you wouldn't have to bend my arm to accept another $5-$10. Also another thought. If you are going to be with the same guide for 2-3 days, it will be to your benefit to let them know that you are planning on tipping them at the end of the last day if you are not tipping them day by day. Another neat idea I have had happen a couple of times with the same guy is that he places a crisp hundred in the brim of his hat. He says if you put a 28+ fish on the end of my rod, it's yours! Makes the day more interesting. By the way I have cashed in on this both times!"
528791,red_river_fisher,2003-03-18 12:01:00,24,on the angler side i think it depends on the guide if heis good and informative then tip accordingly i have tipped up to 50% of the cost for the day.
528792,bbakes,2003-03-18 12:11:00,121,"Certainly, you can always have a rule of thumb, but let your day on the water determine your tip."
528793,River_eye,2003-03-18 12:25:00,1486,I have guided at a Canadian lodge for five years and tips range from $20-$60 US a day (2 people).
528794,Guest,2003-03-18 16:10:00,0,We are also on the guide side. We charge $150 a day and usually receive a tip of between $50-$100 per party of 4. We don't expect anything cuz we have as much fun as you do.
528795,bubbalou,2003-03-24 12:21:00,29,"I agree with the last post. I am paying a pretty good sum of money to them in the first place. If I get a guide with a ""hate Americans"" attitude, doesn't talk to me, has no interest in teaching me about how and why he fishes the way he does, nor catches me any fish I get out of the boat with a tip of the hat and hope I learned my lesson for the next year. If the guide is the opposite of all the above then I will give him at least $20 tip. I am not a rich man by any means so a $100 tip is out of the question. I save all year long to be able to afford this trip!!!"
528796,Guest,2003-03-24 14:57:00,0,I have tipped Guides anywhere from 10% to 100%....caught a 13 Walleye with a Guide one day and gave him my 401k plan....he wouldnt take my wife.
