529060,Guest,2003-03-27 20:24:00,0,"Was looking for someone who has stayed at the RedDog in Ft Frances. What is it like? Is there a bar?I once heard that there is place near by to see ladies of the scantly dressed,,, is this true? This is our first time there, looking for some information on the entertainment before heading in for a week of fishin,,,,,,Krank em, and Yank em"
529061,Guest,2003-03-28 06:36:00,0,"Been staying there the last 5 years. Before that, some shady motel downtown. I think it was called the Midway or something like that. The price at the Red Dog is reasonable and the rooms clean. There is a large bar, pool table, big screen TV and a restaurant. Try the chicken wings from the bar menu and ask them to dial them up a notch. Guaranteed to leave you spraying the toilet the next day!When we stayed at the shady motel there was a strip bar within walking distance. My grandma was better looking and had more teeth then those strippers. If you are planning on going staying there the weekend, of My 24th I hear they are booked up. Some fireman convention or something. We got the last room 2 months ago. When are you going?"
529062,alan ex pup,2003-03-28 10:40:00,126,"generally the motels are booked a year in advance. We stay at la place reandevoux- spelling?- its nice, quiet out of the way, dont have to worry about your boat being pilfered and good restaurant. we stayed at red dog once. not bad could have been better. better to cross the border on friday than saturday though no matter what."
529063,Guest,2003-03-28 11:41:00,0,Thanks for those nauseating mental images Farm Boy. Now I'll avoid chicken wings and Canadian strip clubs for the rest of my life.
529064,Guest,2003-03-28 20:33:00,0,"Well thats interesting cause my brother reserved a room last week. Two double beds and a cot, you say it was booked?We will be there the weekend of Memorial day. Going on to RoughRock near Minaki.,,, Where are you fishing?I'll have to remember that about the wings,,, last thing I need is a case of the slingshot"
529066,red2,2003-03-28 21:43:00,16,"why not stay on the U.S side?? Stayed at the Falls motel a number of times, nice place. Tim"
529067,fishmaster,2003-03-29 15:02:00,209,"Have stayed at the DOG a few times and have been staying at the La Place a much nicer place and you don't have to worry about you stuff out-side they keep an eye on the place and they have good food.Try the chicken strips while you are sitting at the lounge they are good, along with BQ sauce and some deep fried shrooms.Price is the about the same as the Dog."
529071,Bruce,2003-03-29 22:11:00,48,Stayed there last year.High priced drinks and it was so noisy nobody got any sleep.this year we'll sleep in the truck and save a couple hundred bucks. No scantly dressed women and the ones there you wouldn'thave wanted to see scantly dressed.
529072,alan ex pup,2003-03-30 01:28:00,126,the joke is canada is where the men are men and the woman are too!
529065,Guest,2003-03-31 06:38:00,0,"I have to apoligize if I gave some incorrect information on the room availbility at the Red Dog. I was only repeating what my fishing partner had told me when he recerved the room Perhaps, the conference that was scheduled was cancelled. We need to call and see if we can upgrade our room anyway. They stuck us with one that was smaller than we wanted. Maybe we will check out this place called La Place.We are also going up to Minaki on Memorial day weekend, staying at a place called Cygnet Lake."
