529176,Devil55,2003-03-31 13:14:00,16,I've been to LOTW a few times but have never ventured out to Miles bay. I heard it was a good place to fish and was wondering if anyone could give me some info on where to fish it. It looks fairly large on the map so any info would be great. Thanks

529178,Guest,2003-03-31 20:22:00,0,We get up there 3-4 each year. Get a nav chart and have a resort owner or guide show you a few spots. Find out if the fish are on the rocks or sand. Usually sandy bays earlier part of year and reefs as it warms up. Watch the rocks though. There are a few with lots of aluminum on them! The new hots spots maps show several good spots that we fish. Have fun!
