Cold nights and predicted cold front - but the fishing seemed to just overwhelm the weather. Tues and wed (6/18 and 6/19) were warmer. The surface water temp went from ~59 to ~65. And there was a full moon in there someplace. I ate fish twice each day - fried in the bacon grease from my 'bacon only' breakfasts. Oink, Oink. My biggest was 28"". I had a 27, two 26, some 25s and 24s. Many in the 18-22 range. I think I'll go back again in August or September. I may go both months. OH CANADA! What fun!"

Got my biggest muskie on a jig rod and we caught less than usual, but overall more slot sized fish. My wife caught more than I did eight out of nine days out there, which I will never live down. I taught her too well. Might have to start teaching her some goofy stuff in the hopes she likes trying tactics that don't work as well. Most walleyes were in shallow weeds, which were few and far between, and off wind blown islands and points. Nothing consistent on most of the humps, but that should change soon."
