It would have to be a fly in preferably an outpost. The issue we will have is that there are only two of us remaining with kids graduating from college and now with full time jobs. Any suggestions on a good outifitter. Primary would be Walleye, Pike secondary. Thanks, John the janitor"

It has been a few years since we flew with them but I think that there have been some recent favorable reviews that would echo my statement. We flew to Wanzatika a couple of times and the walleye fishing was great, but more numbers than size. It is a relatively small body of water so not a lot of exploring to be done. Have fun with your search!"
