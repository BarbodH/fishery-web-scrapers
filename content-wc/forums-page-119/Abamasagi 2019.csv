But ill always toss kudos to Chad and his wife Dawn who operate TLO and cant suggest this operation enough. Flying with Greg and his Nakina Air operation is always a safe, reliable way to go as well.This was our 9th trip to Aba. Our group has settled on this lake as opposed to popping around to others....and the 8 of us are good with this.We went in on the 3rd week of Jun this yr...so 15th to 22nd. Always a safe reliable week...no iceout issues, no mayflies(LOl..more on tht), usually good solid weather, so no snow, etc. And always good solid fishing.The north is amazing. How each and every yr can be different. Rainfall, snow accumulation equals water levels...always different. Ice out equals water temps...always different. Ya never know what youre gonna get, but this lake always produces no matter.This yr was low water levels...or maybe more normal compared to the last couple yrs. Water Temps were abt 56-63F throughout the week.Air temps....40-70F but never 1 overly hot day.Wind every day which produced a great ""chop"" every dayAll this lead to our most amazing fishing ever!!!! BY FAR. We arent # counters. We always realize by the end of every day each boat basically catch&releases 100 fish easily. This yr we started to realize we had days of over 200-250....it was crazy. Not being summer, with fish held up on humps in certain temps, we predominately troll windblown shorelines, bays, points,etc. Always scoring a double header is a good sign youre onto fish, their bite is on....but when you enter a windblown small bay, and begin from point to point and youre scoring 2-3-4 double headers from point to point THATS crazy good fishing.When we eat, each boat only brings in 3 fish. We ate 4 fish meals. Out of 1000s of fish, 48 fish taken isnt bad....and no pike, all walleyes.Nothing big, max was 23"", but id say this yr was the best fishing for the 19-21 size...young females in feed frenzy.This went on ALL week. Thurs night we noticed mayflies up the NE arm, not the main lake body.By fri we noticed the main lake was also get the hatch as well. This past week was supposed to hot, calm. Im guessing the hatch was gonna come on in full. We have never experienced the hatch in June. Nature is amazing. The stories on the 1st couple weeks were very very low temps, tough fishing, we get the week we did, then the hatch happens weeks ahead of schedule. For those look for a great outfitter, a great lake to fish, TLO and Aba!!!"
