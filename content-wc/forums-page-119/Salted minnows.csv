6334550,SWM08,2019-06-25 19:29:00,10,My group is headed to Cobham lake the last week of August and we are in need of some salted minnows. Does anyone know of a bait supplier between International Falls and Redlake that could help us out? I'm hoping to buy them after we cross the border so we don't have to worry about the ten dozen limit per person crossing the border! Thanks

The minnows I did up a couple weeks before the trip using the Borax/Salt method that was on this site had great results.I had preserved various minnows that were left over from different trips over the winter but definitely preferred the ones I did just before going.

You're welcome to have them as I'll probably end up throwing them out. Send me a PM and I'll figure out a way of getting them to you.
