6334672,lawson2343,2019-06-26 06:42:00,459,"Yes, the Helix 7 has that capability. I have a GEN 1. It is called Split Position and it defaults to 50. Split Position is found on the Side Imaging X-Press Menu. Meaning, when you have side imaging displayed, hit the menu key and you will see it as the third entry down - at least that's where it is on a gen 1."
6334680,lawson2343,2019-06-26 06:54:00,459,"I think the above comment is in error and I apologize. I read further and the Split Position is only for Combo Views, meaning if you have Sonar/SI or something like that on the screen. For the gen 1 I don't see anything that lets you change the SI distance separately side to side. There is the SI Range, but that sets the same value for left and right."
6289466,dmairs,2019-02-13 15:06:00,5,I am considering the upgrade to a Humminbird side imaging but am unsure of how accurate it works when installed in a portable application on the standard lodge provided boats on a Canada fly in trip. How have your past experiences been? Is it accurate on both sides of the boat? Does the boat prop get in the way? Is it worth the $?
6289536,bigdaddyguns,2019-02-13 18:56:00,608,I run Helix 7 on a lodge boat which may not be the same as a boat available at a fly-in camp but close enough. The main difference will be where and how you mount the head unit. The transducer mount should be the same. I bought this mount from Cabelas https://www.cabelas.com/product/Port...7.uts?slotId=2 and it works fine. You will have to fine tune the transducer level to get depth readings on plane. I placed the transducer on the right side of the transom as far from the motor as possible. You can see in the images more turbulence from the propwash (brighter yellows) on the left side below the surface. The SI and sonar images are very good on my unit. I have attached an SI image of a reef we fished this past summer. The image shows a rock top crown on a reef with schools of walleyes that are present in the transition and side of the reef down into a saddle. I was fishing with my brother and he was new to side imaging. One several occasions we where pulling hardbaits for northerns and I pointed out the bigger pike on the SI and told him which side of the boat the fish would hit. After calling which rod would be hit 3 or 4 times he was amazed at that. Anyway the bottom content and fish show up pretty well in the images and how the fish are relating to structure. As a side note these recordings were taken with a 2-3 chop on the lake and a variable speed between 0.2 to 0.8 mph. The slower speed regions elongate the images and cause some distortion. Overall the image is very readable. I suspect the wave action over the reef top is the cause of the turbulence/variation in the DI part of the water column. To me it is worth the $$.
6289538,x4flatfish,2019-02-13 18:57:00,319,"I don't have experience with a lodge boat, but why would it be different than any other boat? Just nee to be careful where you mount the transducer. Yes the prop and or lower unit can cause interference. Yes side imaging is worth the $$$..."
6289588,Skywagon,2019-02-14 05:00:00,1106,"You might want to consider the amount of battery power a larger screen and side imaging will need. A lot of fly-in camps don't have electric start outboards on the typical 14'-16' boat (thus no starting battery), so you will need a good charging source for your battery back at camp."
6289658,BornToFish,2019-02-14 07:40:00,1224,"Greetings,I run a Helix 9 on the lodge boats that I use each summer. I mostly use the regular sonar, down imaging and gps features on my unit. I sometimes use the side imaging, but readily admit that I should be using this feature WAY more than I do. My portable electronics are the second best money that I ever spent to fish in Canada as it allowed me to take my fishing to an altogether higher level.I also use a Cabela's standard/regular portable transducer bracket to mount my transducer. It is a slightly different version of the unit reported by BigDaddy.The only modification that I make to the bracket is to swap out all of the zinc plated hardware for stainless steel. The directions for assembly that come with the unit aren't the best, but the picture on the outside of the package is very helpful.I am currently mounting my transducer bracket on the starboard side of the transom, so that my transducer does not conflict with the boat's original transducer mounted on the port side of the transom.It seems that each boat is somewhat different from the next boat. It normally takes me a few tries to get the height adjustment ""just right"", so that I don't lose bottom when the boat is on plane and to minimize interferences.All of the boats at the lodge that I fish from have 12 V starting batteries. I just hook the alligator clips of the electrical leads onto the battery for my power source. SkyWagon offered great advice about thinking ahead with regard to powering your unit.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6334316,andreindy,2019-06-24 22:08:00,308,I too am wondering how my Helix 7 G3 Side Imaging unit will do on a portable bracket mounted on a 14' Naden that has 9.9s. On the 9.9s are pretty robust rock guards. This unit is brand new and what I understand is that the down imaging picture is a composite of the side imaging. I am hoping that the lower unit does not interfere too much with the ability of the transducer to do side scanning/down imaging.
6334332,kzoofisher,2019-06-25 03:25:00,5144,I love it. Also use a mount like the one above and tweak it to get the best picture possible. Sometimes I have to trim the motor up a bit to get good si at lower speeds and good 2d at speed. It has been invaluable for finding structure and fish.
6334596,PhilTickelson,2019-06-25 22:53:00,84,"I had an older aluminum boat where the motor would get in the way of the SI. It's not ideal, but if your main purpose is to locate structure, then that is okay. Let's say you have it on the starboard side and the port side is 'blocked'. One option is to change the SI 'Split' in the menu so that it's 10/90, then up the distance of the SI return. It's not perfect, but having the full screen dedicated to one direction allows you to better see what's happening on further distances. I did this for a long time and just adjusted how I 'scout' areas a bit. It wasn't ideal, but still better than no SI ."
6334656,bigdaddyguns,2019-06-26 06:22:00,608,On some HB SI units the transducer does not have a dedicated DI element. In those cases the head unit displays a DI image extracted from the right SI channel. The DI image is the water column portion clipped out of the SI channel and rotated 90 degrees.
6334666,andreindy,2019-06-26 06:31:00,308,"This has been helpful and the trick about increasing or decreasing the side imaging from one side or another sounds useful! I am not sure if the Helix 7 has that capability...I will go play and find out. The wild card will be how it works on those little camp boats that do not have trimmable motors. Just the small 9.9s. I know I do not need the SI from the Helix 7 to catch fish in Canada. Or the DI. But it would be a slight bummer if this new toy has really compromised capabilities on the camp boat. I will know in a few weeks. But then again, it's Canada and I will be thankful regardless."
