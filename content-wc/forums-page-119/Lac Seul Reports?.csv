6332706,IaDave14,2019-06-19 17:23:00,99,Just curious why you trailer to Lac Suel and not fish Minnitaki. From 2001-2007 it was great fishing but the last few times I have gone it is not even close to what it was. It could be me as I always go the spots I did before. Heading to Red Pine the end of August so maybe time to look for new spots. I'm considering hiring a guide the first day.
6332708,eyecatcher1,2019-06-19 17:43:00,323,"I do fish Minnitaki, Abram, Pelican and Big Vermillion when I'm there also and all of them are great, but I love those 100 fish days on Lac Seul as well as the scenery. You can do that too on the other lakes, but it's not an almost every day thing like Lac Seul is. Hey, even 50 fish days are better than what I usually get down here. I do try to learn different spots all of the time because the popular spots get hammered by the resorts. Even up there a guy has to move around a little. Over the past 27 years I have seen hot spots be good then cool off for a few years and then come back again. We'll be heading up again in late August or early September, so let's keep in touch. Maybe we'll be up there at the same time. When are you going in August? I don't have a reservation for then yet."

6332792,eyecatcher1,2019-06-20 06:27:00,323,Replied to pm.
6332842,IaDave14,2019-06-20 08:48:00,99,I must be having issues with sending a pm. We will be there Aug 24-31 in cabin 2. Let me know if you will be there the same time.
6332874,eyecatcher1,2019-06-20 09:23:00,323,"OK, I'll let you know when we'll be there again. I'll see what is available next week when I'm there. Cabin 2 is the one that we usually stay in also."
6333674,lazermule,2019-06-23 07:35:00,86,"Hello Guys, I will be there Aug 15th - 19th and staying at Abrams RV Park. I have always stayed there and fish LS but would love to lear Minnitaki and Abrams and others. LM"
6333680,eyecatcher1,2019-06-23 07:48:00,323,"Abram and Minnitaki aren't as good as Lac Seul, but you can still catch plenty of fish there. In August you'll probably be looking for midlake structure. For starters there always seems to be fish at Frog Rapids and the Abram Chute and that's a short boat ride from where you're staying. Try the edge of the fast water. Lots of snags in both places though."
6335188,Bob/MN,2019-06-27 13:09:00,178,"I got back on the 26th, fished for the most in the Sen Bay area. Caught most of the walleyes in 6 to 14 FOW using a spinner rig.Water temps went from 62 to 65 degrees.My best fish for the week was 27 inches C&R. Hit some tough weather Mon. & Tues. with rain and thunder storms."
6335242,eyecatcher1,2019-06-27 16:07:00,323,"I fished the Bear Narrows area Tuesday and Wednesday with water temps 61 to 66. The fish are still relating to shoreline structure. We caught tons of walleyes in 12 to 14 FOW. Even got two bonus pike 34.5"" and 38"" as well as some in the mid 20s. We checked midlake structure and there weren't any fish there. Only four slot fish with the biggest being 20.5"", but lots of 14 to 17"" fish. Tomorrow is my last day, so we're heading back up there."
6331084,Bob/MN,2019-06-14 11:00:00,178,"Any reports on water levels,water temp., what on and how deep?Thank you."
6331802,Bob/MN,2019-06-17 09:17:00,178,Nothing going on?
6331936,stjoeguy,2019-06-17 15:26:00,979,Check this site for lake levels:http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html Looks slightly higher than last year:http://www.lwcb.ca/pdf/2-YEARGRAPHS2019.06.17.pdf Water temp on Lake St. Joseph last week was 58 on bigger parts and 60 in smaller bays. Lake St. Joseph is similar size but roughly 100 miles north of Lac Seul. We started fishing St. Joe in 6-9' last week but wound up getting fish everywhere from 5-22'.
6332118,eyecatcher1,2019-06-18 07:55:00,323,I'll be heading there Saturday Bob. I'll post a report when I'm there.
6332278,Northwoodswalleye,2019-06-18 14:39:00,262,Main lake water temp is 60 degrees today. Fishing has been decent. Wenesaga has mostly small males in it-much bettter average size in Steamboat
6332634,walleyeguy3,2019-06-19 12:54:00,42,"Best wishes to you eyecatcher. Have a safe trip up and back, plus lots of fish catching. Can't wait to read how things went for you and your group."
6332636,David Anderson,2019-06-19 12:58:00,2073,"Just got back from Chamberlain Narrows. Boat was still in shop so had to use a camp boat. Fishing was pretty good considering one get's used to using electronics so much. Found most of our fish on the points and shorelines. With no electric trolling motor we drifted a lot of stretches of shoreline in the 12 -18 feet of water, did pretty good using that method. Did our best near Bear Narrows, a fairly fast drift using Chartreuse curly tail or B Fish N paddle tail or Moxi in Orange core, chartreuse or brighter, even got a few on pink/white"
6332640,eyecatcher1,2019-06-19 13:35:00,323,"Thanks walleyeguy! We stay at a resort on Abram Lake, but spend most of our time on Lac Seul. I'll let you all know how it goes."
6332692,walleyeguy3,2019-06-19 16:34:00,42,"If you're staying at Winoga, say hello to Troy. If not, check them out if you have the time. They run a nice place, and Troy will help you find fish if that is ever a problem for your group. Love that rapids from Abram to Minitaki. Just remember to stay to the right as you shoot up the rapids."
6332696,eyecatcher1,2019-06-19 16:44:00,323,"I know where Winoga is and have heard good things about them, but we stay at Red Pine Lodge. The Abram Chute is always good and so is Frog Rapids. After 27 years we know a few other spots there too. LOL! Lac Seul will always be my favorite though. I've fished it from Lost Lake all the way up to Perch Ripple. It's an amazing body of water!"
