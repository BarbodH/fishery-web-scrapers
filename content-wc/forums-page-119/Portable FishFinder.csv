6301230,adempsey2.0,2019-03-17 19:38:00,611,"A new 10Ah battery should provide the same amount of power regardless of battery type. The age of the battery and how it has been maintained as well as the air temperature will affect this though. The Helix 7 draws 800 mA, so the 10Ah battery should last you over 10 hours. Longer if you keep the backlight off and even longer with the GPS off. Not sure why Nocquo claimed 6 to 8 hours.Easy enough to test at home."
6301430,rutter,2019-03-18 14:29:00,19,"Lithium ion should achieve almost 100% discharge vs. 80% for a typical lead acid. Additionally, lithium typically maintains constant voltage level over the entire discharge cycle. Lead acid typically experiences a constant drop of voltage, I would expect both these as factors in a longer life for a lithium ion. I would guess NOCQUA's estimate is based on their experience. Perhaps you can't quite achieve 100% discharge and the 800ma current draw listed for a Helix 7 is on the optimistic side in the real world. I was hoping to get some feedback to see if this was consistent with what folks were really seeing for battery life before making a final decision on battery size."
6307328,Shore_Lunch,2019-04-03 12:58:00,1,"I am thankful for the insight in these posts, as I am also looking for a portable fish finder. I have an older (15-20 yrs or more?) Eagle FishEasy unit with a portable kit and suction cup mount that still works reasonably well, but in the event it stops functioning, I am looking to buy a newer portable unit to take to Canada and use on a camp boat and also looking to upgrade with newer technology. I'm interested in the Humminbird Helix 5, but the suction cup transducer mount from Humminbird says it is to be used at trolling speeds only? Never had any problems with my old Eagle unit coming off on camp boats. Is the concern that they will come off at speed and be lost? or be damaged at higher speeds? Even in a camp boat with 50 HP? It just seems like an incredible pain to have to remove it from the transom with traveling on a larger lake in Canada, multiple times throughout the day. My Eagle had a cord connected to the transducer that you could tie to a cleat - does that solve the problem (i.e. is this really a problem with the Humminbird transducer mount on camp boats?) Thanks for your continued insight! SL"
6335878,kona77,2019-06-29 13:03:00,236,"Update from this thread I replied to earlier in the year.. I had bought a Garmin/strike unit (old Eagle unit failed after 20+ years) this year and I was very happy with the performance/battery life. We run a Honda generator every evening so I just recharged daily but I know it could have gone longer between charges.. I mainly just use the basic functions (water depth, temp etc) but did use the GPS mapping process the first few days until we got to know the lake.. Overall happy with the purchase and will see if it lasts 20+ years."
6297490,Jeler,2019-03-09 08:20:00,92,Thanks so much for the info and links! Very helpful. You just solved the issues for mounting my RayMarine Dragonfly Transducer!
6297824,hoppy63,2019-03-09 20:47:00,367,"Another question that came to mind is I have an old hummingbird that I use....not sure of model anymore but it works for what i want, which is showing me the bottom. Question is, when I am running I lose my signal/screen. I adjust transducer and can sometimes get it just right to where I can run half power/speed in boat and still have signal. Is this just an issue with older models or are new ones the same?"

6299088,Bstar,2019-03-12 13:38:00,564,Your welcome. My HB Helix transducer is similar to your Dragonfly so you should have no problem with those mounts.
6299092,Bstar,2019-03-12 13:46:00,564,My experience even with a relatively new HB is that placement of the transducer can make all the difference. Even a 1/2 adjustment. Motor interference and cavitation from the boat/motor at higher speeds can effect resolution. My HB picks up the interference but I can still see the depth changes. I just slow down if I want to investigate a spot. I'm more concerned about hitting rocks on an unfamiliar lake.
6299094,Jeler,2019-03-12 13:47:00,92,Awesome! I have the 15MM X-Power Mount for the transducer & Nocqua 10ah battery ordered and they are on the way!Thanks againJeff

6300540,Twins_dad,2019-03-16 06:08:00,38,"We have a group that goes to Ontario to a drive in camp. I made the mistake a few trips ago of portablizing my Helix 9, so now I can't go back to a 5 screen!. It draws 1 amp per hour but recharging batteries at a drive in really isn't an issue. Our trip this year is a fly in so weight is now my challenge. We will fish a new lake to us so sonar and GPS will be a necessity. The other challenge is recharging batteries. I am investigating swapping out my heavy sealed lead acid battery for a lithium replacement. Expensive but about half the weight. And a 10amp charger so the generator can fully charge my 10 amp hour battery while we are making lunch or dinner. I welcome suggestions from any of you who are experienced with fly in challenges."
6301198,rutter,2019-03-17 18:18:00,19,"I'm currently looking at making a Helix 7 with GPS portable, so I'm also looking at battery options for a fly in. NOCQUA has indicated for the Helix 7, I'd get 6 - 8 hours with their 10ah lithium ion battery which should be better than what you would get with a 10ah lead acid. Of course NOCQUA indicated battery life is highly dependent on the settings especially brightness. I'd really like to see at least 9 to 10 hours to cover a full day of use. How may hours have you typically got with the Helix 9 and a 10ah lead acid?"
6295536,Bstar,2019-03-05 07:08:00,564,I have the HB Helix 5 GPS DI and really like it but as others have said you will need to have a way to charge you battery. If you make sure you disable all of the views that you don't use the battery will last longer. I also turned off tracking and dimmed the screen as low as I could tolerate to conserve the battery. I really like the down imaging on the unit especially when were fishing deeper water in August. As a side note I just ordered a Nocqua 10AH Lithium Ion battery kit. It only weighs 1.5 lbs and comes with a charger and all connections. https://nocqua.com/product/pro-power-kit-3/
6296876,labatter,2019-03-07 17:46:00,8,I have been using the portable Garmin for fly ins for 2 years. Terrific. 6 days on a charge if you shut it off when not using it.
6297050,jermck,2019-03-08 07:31:00,12,My brother in law has used the Raymarine for the last two years and loves it. Two 8 ah batteries will power it for our five day trips.
6297236,Jeler,2019-03-08 13:17:00,92,"I own a Dragonfly and like it alot. I have thought about taking it on a fly-in but haven't quite figured out how to install the transducer out of a camp boat. They are not a typical transducer and are around 6"" long."
6297404,Jack68133,2019-03-09 00:21:00,14,I am going to order an extra battery so that I can charge one while I am fishing with the other. I am looking at the exact model that you mentioned. Does is come with a suction cup to attach the transducer or do I have to order that extra as well?
6297412,Wade B AKA: Ruger2506,2019-03-09 02:06:00,5533,I mounted a Humminbird 788 HD DI on a Vexilar carry tray. Ran it off the Vexilar battery. Highly portable and highly functional.
6297440,Bstar,2019-03-09 05:30:00,564,"If you buy the portable model it should come with a suction cup. I had a bad experience several years ago with losing a transducer with a suction cup so I would recommend a Sully transducer bracket. You can get them at Cabela's https://www.cabelas.com/product/Port...7.uts?slotId=1. This year I'll be using a Fishfinder Mounts XPower magnetic mount. It's very lightweight and has some really powerful magnets. I have to give a shout out to my nephew,Allen, for buying it for me! You can find it here https://www.fishfindermounts.com/pro...ansducer-mount. If your unit comes with a 7ah battery I would upgrade to a 10ah with a spare or check into the NOCQUA 10ah lithium ion. Good luck!"
6297476,Guest,2019-03-09 07:00:00,0,Even if my suction cup failed on my Garmin i still wouldn't loose the transducer because of the cable and how its held in the mount. I guess if it fell off and i drove at high speed and didnt notice the cable and transducer bouncing behind the boat for a length of time.
6297478,Bstar,2019-03-09 07:09:00,564,That's exactly what happened to me. I was running back to camp on Lac Seul and looked back and seen the transducer cable flying in the breeze with no transducer. This was at the end of a ten mile run and of course I had no idea when it came off. Went to the Sully mount and never have to worry about it.
6297482,Limeyangler,2019-03-09 07:47:00,563,"I have a Helix 5 chirp. Fantastic unit. I would recommend this unit if you can charge at camp. The suction cup works fine and I've never had an issue with it, like others have said the issues arise if you are travelling at speed and don't notice, having said that I doubt flying are running much more than 25hp on their boats so no worries there. You will get longer battery life if you opt for the unit without GPS, but an advantage to have the gps unit is you could buy the Autochart Live chip and map the remote lakes you will be on. good luck on your search and trip."
6294728,Jack68133,2019-03-03 07:22:00,14,I am leaning towards the Helix 5. We do have electricity in camp. Asked my camp owner and he suggested the Helix 5 as well.
6294736,spurs101,2019-03-03 07:55:00,635,"Well worth the extra bucks for the Helix 5. I returned a Hook2 portable. Absolutely no comparison. Brightness, clarity and accuracy is impressive. I was always a Lowrance guy until I ran this unit. Suggest you play with it before your trip to get the settings. It's pretty self explanatory and intuitive."
6294896,ILScott,2019-03-03 14:52:00,139,Looking at upgrading finder and wondering if you can hook the striker 4 up to a 12 volt battery. Looking for portability for Canadian trip that boat has electric start tiller and want to hook finder into battery.
6294934,hoppy63,2019-03-03 16:53:00,367,"Does anyone use a vexilar/flashers? I have old hummingbird fish finder that works just fine for me but have always wondered about using a flasher. Have never used one out of a boat. Have also wondered about using an underwater camera.....any thoughts on that??? Also not being so familiar with the electronics, do the portables ie helix 5 come with transducer with auction cup, or do you need to adapt or buy one for it?? Thanks for any info."
6295086,Mojo-NC,2019-03-04 07:14:00,1929,"I started a similar thread on the Electronics page last week. I was inquiring to see if anyone has brought along a small solar panel for charging their fishfinder batteries on a fly-in trip and I didn't get a single response on the thread. I think I'm still going to give it a try this year and bring two batteries. I'll try to charge one while using the other and switch back and forth. Lowrance sells a suction cup mount for their transducers and just about any of their units can be converted to portable. The battery draw will depend on the size of the screen, whether it is color or black and white, ping speed, and the brightness of the screen. My previous portable unit was Garmin and they make a suction cup mount for their transducers as well."

6295102,Mojo-NC,2019-03-04 07:30:00,1929,"Yes, you can connect any fishfinder to a 12V battery as the power source. You can use a separate battery like a 12V 8.5 AH SLA battery (see link below) that will last all day, but you'll need to have a way to recharge it. This is what I used last year and it worked great. I charged it every night and it was good for the whole day.https://www.chromebattery.com/12v-8-...connector.html Another option is to use one of these little gadgets and power your portable unit using D-Cell batteries. You'll likely go through several sets of batteries over the week.https://www.superbrightleds.com/more...lder/982/2399/"
6295208,wmd,2019-03-04 11:40:00,388,"SAs long as you have a high speed transducer the Vexilar will work. I used one for years the only draw back was being able to interpret bottom readings and drop-offs, that could be me not knowing how. No guessing with a flasher when you mark fish. The underwater camera I would think would be a problem because of the dark water in most Canadian lakes but I have never used one in Canada. wad"

6295346,adempsey2.0,2019-03-04 16:09:00,611,"You need a pretty decent panel to charge a battery. A typical battery for fish finders is 12V 7 Amp Hours, which is 84 Watt hours. So, a 7 Watt solar panel would require 84/7 = 12 hours of max sunlight to charge the battery from empty. Unfortunately, the process is not 100% efficient so let us assume 80% efficiency as well, so that is now 15 hours to charge the battery . It is also unlikely your battery will be completely depleted, so let's assume it is only 70% depleted. That is still over 10 hours of max sunlight. I think you might be lucky to get 5 hours/day in the summer here in Canada. There is also a point (over 10W? I forget, sorry) in which you need a decent charge controller as well. In the end, it will be cheaper to just bring several batteries even if you have to pay overage charges. Heck, even renting a gas generator is probably cheaper."
6294388,Jack68133,2019-03-01 17:21:00,14,Looking for a decent portable fish finder that comes with a suction cup transducer. This is obviously for a fly in trip. Taking all suggestions and I'll sort them out.
6294390,Guest,2019-03-01 18:24:00,0,Garmin Portable great little unit with great battery life. Or now that alot of finders are on sale. Buy the portable unit and then buy one that's on clearance. I see alot of 7 inch screen finders at really good prices.
6294392,Jack68133,2019-03-01 18:31:00,14,Thanks Garmin.............. not even trying to hide it. I respect that.
6294556,kona77,2019-03-02 12:25:00,236,"Jack- I was in a similar situation as you. Have been going to Canada for 25+ years and my old Eagle unit started failing last June. I researched and looked at various portable units..(Lowrance Hook 2..Humminbird Piranha and Garmin Strike).. All these units run from $99 (sale price) to $139 and they have similar features.. None really jumped out as a superior unit and I ended up getting the Garmin Strike unit that came with a Portable Kit that included the battery, bag, suction cup. Ended up at $174 after a $25 rebate at Cabela's. I can not give you a review yet on use, battery life etc. but I have been playing around with it and it seems like a pretty easy unit to use. There are quite a few on-line reviews for all three units (most good but some negative). I hope the Garmin unit will be a great unit for me. Good luck on your search and maybe some other WC members will give you feedback"
6294564,Jack68133,2019-03-02 13:45:00,14,Thanks. I was looking at the Hummingbird Helix 5 as well. I will definitely check out the ones you mentioned.
6294590,adempsey2.0,2019-03-02 15:56:00,611,"What is most important for me is how long the battery will last. The Garmin Striker 4/Plus 4 draws 230 mA, so a typical 7A/h battery will last 30 hours at most. The Humminbird PiranhaMAX 4 at 280 mA is about 25 hours. Lowrance does not give the specification for power consumption without the backlight on (with backlight its 9 hours), but I imagine the Hook-3x is similar to the Garmin/Humminbird (probably 250 mA) without the backlight on.Those units offer the best longevity on a single charge. They all seem to be pretty good units, especially for a fly-in.The Humminbird Helix 5 G2 and Chirp GPS G2 will last 10-11 hours. Also, very nice units and still portable enough.As long as you can recharge batteries [and bring a spare] you will be just fine with any of those. Upgrading your battery to a 9 or 10 A/h is always a good idea too. You can get a nice 10A/h lithium battery from Dakota (they weigh half as much as the standard lead acid batteries), although check the air service regulations about lithium batteries first."
6294592,emma17,2019-03-02 16:03:00,436,"I bought the Garmin last year and brought it on a fly-in and loved it. The unit is easy to transport, easy to use and held a charge for the day. I've not used other models so I can't offer an opinion."
6294604,andreindy,2019-03-02 16:42:00,308,"While I do not have the years of experience of many, I recently picked up a Helix 5 CHIRP DI unit with GPS. After the $50 Helix rebate, I am hovering around $230 for a unit that can AutoChart (I already had the zero lines card) and mark waypoints, etc, etc. Probably unnecessary, but it was hard for me to pass that up. However, the draw on the Helix 5 is 600mA, which you need to think through how that translates with batteries on, for example, a fly-in."
6294626,spurs101,2019-03-02 19:07:00,635,I sprung for the Helix 5 Portable Chirp. Fantastic unit. I got about 10 hrs on a battery but didn't work with the settings to get better battery time. I bought 2 extra batteries. Generator at camp ran for approx 7 hours a day so was able recharge. The clarity of this unit is outstanding. Highly recommend.
6294670,Eckohlt,2019-03-03 05:08:00,3685,"I have a helix5 its an awesome unit for fly in but u must have a power source at camp for charging,it does a great job marking fish and wen u do mark fish squeeze your pole alittle tighter coz your going to get throttled lol,good luck on choosing a unit"
