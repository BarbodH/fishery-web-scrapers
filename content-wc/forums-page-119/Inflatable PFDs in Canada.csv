6333900,eyecatcher1,2019-06-23 21:11:00,323,Just an FYI: I was checked by the MNR today while on the water and learned that a self inflating PFD does NOT count as a PFD in your boat unless you are wearing it.
6333940,h8go4s,2019-06-24 05:51:00,1673,"It's not just Canada. From the Minnesota DNR Boating Guide:""Some inflatable life jackets are required to be worn in order to be counted as one of your U.S. Coast Guard-approved wearable flotation devices—check the label for indication. Inflatables are not approved for use on personal watercraft or while water-skiing or similar sports. Always read the label for intended use and follow any restrictions.Before purchasing, make sure that “U.S. Coast Guard Approved” is visible somewhere on the package or on the device itself"""

6333970,The tank,2019-06-24 07:06:00,340,We found that out last year. I have both pfd and regular jackets in my boat but one of our other boats only had pfd and the MNR checked us and told them they have to be worn if that's all you have in the boat. No tickets just a warning.
6333990,Huntindave,2019-06-24 07:30:00,2194,I believe you will find this to be true on almost any waters in the US and Canada.
6334006,eyecatcher1,2019-06-24 08:02:00,323,"I have 4 inflatable and 2 regular, but I had the inflatables ones out. He told me it had to be worn if that's what I was using. No fines, just info."
6334558,valley366,2019-06-25 19:57:00,193,Bought a Cabelas inflatable about 5 years ago. Auto type. Best purchase I ever made. Having kids in the boat it does not raise a question about wearing them all the time when mine is on. I don't even realize it is on half the time.
6334570,kliph,2019-06-25 20:17:00,2337,"Same here in NY State, it maybe a Coast Guard thing. I got stopped by the Coast Guard for a ""safety check"". He asked for PFD, I showed him the inflatable one I had on.He asked me to take it off so he could see it. Once it's off it's notlegal. I guess he didn't know that. Besides, I had other PFD in the boat.BTW: Since when do you need ID to drive a boat?"
