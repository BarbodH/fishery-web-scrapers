6334392,stumcfar,2019-06-25 08:06:00,451,I have never hired a guide. What does a guide cost per day before tipping?
6334412,MagMarco,2019-06-25 09:13:00,15,I have seen 180.00 to 400.00 per day depending on lodge.
6333042,MagMarco,2019-06-20 17:27:00,15,"I am never quite sure on what to tip. Usually have guide for a day but springing for 4 days this year. So much a day, 10%? I always offer a new best record for walleye, but 32.5"" will be very difficult to beat. Thanks for the help."
6333092,MN_Moose,2019-06-20 19:47:00,964,"I think a few things may factor into it. Is the guide the owner or are you paying through the life due / outfitter. If direct then maybe not unless you have an exceptional day. 10% may be on the low side. I'd say 20% for good service. 25% for exceptional day. How big of a group? Dads and a couple kids? A lot you can tell by how much bs they're feeding you. Catch a little dink, ""oh, that's a nice one. You want your picture taken with that one?"" Is the guide teaching why the spots sure good or what's going on? Good luck."
6333100,Obabikon,2019-06-20 20:14:00,2370,"I tell guests who ask that $50/day is an average tip. If he's exceptional, tip accordingly. As mentioned, lots of things (especially his performance) go into what you should tip. But, if you make his day more difficult, please tip accordingly. Guides are used to difficult days, but one guide on a group of 8 guys should be getting tipped at least $100... simply for cleaning all the fish. If you go out and catch a limit of pike, and the guide cleans/packages all of them for you... tip better. All that said, I'm a firm believer that a tip is earned. If $50 is average... don't feel bad if you got a crappy guide to tip less. We employ 5 full time guides at this point, and have another 5 part time guides. My #1 guide is one of the best on the entire lake... but he informs me of groups he'd prefer not to guide again. If you want the best guides, year after year... generosity goes a long way."
6333118,MagMarco,2019-06-20 21:14:00,15,Thank you for the replies
6333150,jfaisten,2019-06-21 04:16:00,1060,We start at 20% and it's a sliding scale -- more or less depending on effort/performance.
6333200,Baseline,2019-06-21 07:19:00,3207,"One thing to remember it the Guide has a limited season and usually lives in a rural area where good paying jobs are not plentiful or they would be working somewhere else. I never use a guide when I have my own boat, but when I travel and take charters I think that $50 per person is appropriate. If I'm a single and hook up with on a group charter then I tip 25% of the my personal charter fee or $50 whichever is greater."
6333622,SeulAreaWalleye,2019-06-23 04:45:00,100,"Well said, most guides keep track of each trip for future reference. 50 a day per group keeps you low on their priority list for the future. Do you want your guide to start the next year's trip happy to be there, or in a state of depression to be stuck there?"
6333722,Fisherman Ted,2019-06-23 10:18:00,461,$75-$100 per day
6334384,MagMarco,2019-06-25 07:37:00,15,Thank to all for information being that is what I asked for. Sorta settled on 30% and adjust from there. Vacations are year long savings on limited budget so need to take that into account. Only vacation all year.
