To my partners and I, this makes it a much more pleasurable ride. About ten and a half hours from Southeastern PA to the airbase. Sand lake in the Moselle territory was our destination. Sand is not a large lake but sports a lot of water a hundred or more feet in depth and its the first time we ever fished there. Our cabin was on a rock. Good in one sense because when the wind blew the bugs were few. Only one other cabin on the lake and occupied by a friendly couple that had fished the lake for 22 years. Wind and walleyes was the theme for this trip. We found great fishing in bays and on points when the wind was there to help. A good strategy on a first time lake. We enjoyed two great walleye dinners, one with an added red fleshed 2 pound brook trout and everyone took home their limit of walleye. Generous sizes up to 20 inches at the fork. At our urging the outfitter had installed a shower and running water in the cabin. God bless them. PA to We had a great trip and at seventy-five a five day is just about right. Good fishing to all this year. Ron"
