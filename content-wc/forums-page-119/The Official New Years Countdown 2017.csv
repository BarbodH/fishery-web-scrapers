5251826,bearfvr13,2017-01-03 18:16:00,174,"That would be Perrault Lake Camp,...Mark and Amy Tycholis run that camp. It on the right just b4 Rainbow Point. I've been fishing this lake for about 4 years now and it's been great so far,...heard a lot of people call it the Dead Sea,....but if a 4 year newbie can catch all kinds of fish,...then I'd hate to see what I'm capable of on a better lake!!! The only thing I don't like about it is there is no lake trout. But all I got to do is jump on the other side of 105 and hit cliff lake if I want to catch those!!! Chuck Bearfvr13"

5253873,LoDo,2017-01-04 18:47:00,721,"Back to Lac Seul for the first time in 9yrs. I've had to privilege to fish private water in the Woodland Caribou Prov Park the last 9 yrs with friends. This year will be with family on the west side of Lac Seul. Fishermans Cove had a last minute opening and we were lucky enough to swoop in. I've stayed at Fishermans Cove before. I've also stayed at Lac Seul lodge and Onaway, all of which are fairly close to one another. It'll be long boat rides to all things MacKenzie Bay."
