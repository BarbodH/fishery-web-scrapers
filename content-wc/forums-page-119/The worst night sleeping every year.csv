6335796,SteveJ715,2019-06-29 09:19:00,59,"100% with you on it being the worst night's sleep of the year. Usually have some dialogue about how early to blast off Friday AM, and at some point admit to myself it doesn't really matter since I will sleep like crap anyway. Have a great trip! Still two months before we head north..."
6335812,kettyspanky,2019-06-29 10:10:00,271,"We leave in a month and know what your talking about. As long as I can sleep good the first night we get there I'm okay. The 10 hr drive on minimal sleep isn't fun, but the reward of sitting in the boat for a week is worth it."
6335824,law57,2019-06-29 10:46:00,1147,"HA! I live in N. MN - only 285 miles from where I fish in Canada. I usually leave a little later on Saturday morning to miss some of the line at the border. This year they had all the lines running and it didn't take that long to get thru. I return on Thursday and never have more than a car or two in front of me when I cross back to the USA. I went for two weeks this month (June). I may go back for a week in August or September - maybe both months. All my friends are too old and sick or have passed on me. I do have one friend who's healthy but he went once and said it costs too much. He goes with some other guys and catches eaters and maybe a 22"" 'trophy'. I go alone and catch 28""+ trophies and all the eaters I can down. The two week stay in June cost me $1020. I think that's cheap. It included a 25% discount on the second week. So I'll get that same discount in Aug/Sept. Oh Canada!"
6335916,ILScott,2019-06-29 14:48:00,139,We always left early in the morning but nobody ever slept the night before. So now we leave at 9 at night and avoid traffic and get the same type of sleep in the car. Then we have a nice relaxed day before we go to camp.
6335994,Hook_settr,2019-06-30 05:25:00,127,"I hear ya! I'm not a seasoned vet but I have been to Canada more times that I can count and Canada Eve is still the worst night of sleep. For me it is the culmination of months of preparation: stocking up on gear, making lists for menus, groceries, equipment, etc. and I'm all fired up. Doesn't matter if I take an OTC sleep aid or not. Last year we decided to blast off at 4AM but agreed to keep cell phones handy. If anyone woke up in the middle of night they were to send a group text to see who else was up. If everyone was up we would blast off early. Well, we were on the road at 2AM. LOL"
