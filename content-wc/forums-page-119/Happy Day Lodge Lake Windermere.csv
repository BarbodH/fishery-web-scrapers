6334724,MrSimon,2019-06-26 08:27:00,922,"Just go with standard late summer tactics. Walleye will be on deeper structure, mostly in 18-22 fow, close to deeper water. By then I'd focus primarily on the main basin areas past the narrows. Smallies will be in and around boulders in 4-10 FOW. Pike will be deeper and might be hard to find. Look for good green weeds if you can find them. Wind is important! Wind blown points and bays with rocks can be amazing!"

No surprise given the depth of the lake. The trolling motor was well used. The weedbeds were also very productive for all species. I lost a trophy pike in a large weedbed not too far west of camp that still haunts me (47.928569, -83.693721 ?? Not certain of exact loc). I believe the narrows west of camp was also a good Walleye spot (47.919611, -83.726341) but the boat traffic there can annoying. Thats all I recall, sorry!Sent from my SM-A530W using Tapatalk"
