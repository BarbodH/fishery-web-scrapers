The weather was cool with lows in the 30's and highs in the 50's, this kept the bug level very low and sleeping in the tent was good. We only got rained on once during the day and 2 times at night and the wind was bearable most the time. Fishing for the most part was fair for us but with that we were not hitting it as hard as we should have and did a lot of searching for better spots rather than sticking to an area and making it pay. We caught fish in nearly all spots fished and there were several areas that every time we trolled by we would double and occasionally triple. Lake is known as a good trout lake but we did not chase them, the fisherman that were targeting them talked like they were doing well. We mainly trolled for walleye and spent an hour or two daily casting for pike. As for walleye our largest was 27 inches with a fair 8 or 10 24 to 26 inches and a fair amount over 22 inches. We did boat 4 pike over 40 inches up to 44 inches. Reed has a lot of quality fish and their high level management for trophy fish shows, I am sure the right area and group of fisherman could rack up 100 fish days with several trophies daily at times. Dave was at his seasonal site while we were there and his soon to be wife Kerry was there some also. They are both very helpful, friendly and fun to converse with. Dave has a lot of knowledge of the lake and can answer many questions on it. It was a defiantly a plus to the trip being in the same campground as these two."

Haven't fished Reed, reputed to be a very good, large water. Have fished a bit farther east at Tramping for 3 years, good area with lots of large fish. Bill"
