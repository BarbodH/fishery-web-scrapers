No, I'm not looking to do work, just would like the weather radar. I might also post a fishing report day by day. I like reading others' daily reports from the north, even on lakes I don't know."
1471955,Guest,2012-08-07 18:27:00,0,"For me, the noise outweighs any convenience. Our group has gone to about 10 different fly in outposts (plus some repeat visits). One had a noisy generator for lights and fridge/freezer. We hated it. Had to run the noise machine for evening lightning. Had to leave it running during the day to keep the fridge cool (freezer did make ice nicely though). Even heard the blasted thing across the lake (I prefer to hear loons). The following year we brought lanterns for quiet evening lightning so we did not have our Canadian experience disturbed. Going outside to turn the generator off at night would cost you 7,456,499,532 mosquito bites. To get around that, we would fill the tank with only enough gas for a few hours so it would run out of gas by itself. I can still remember lying in bed waiting for silence. I think if we had a QUIET generator, we would like to use it. Being a fly in, we did not have trolling motor batteries to recharge. No microwave, etc. Some water pumping systems may require electricity to run the pump. Propane fridges do have a slight hum, and barely make ice."
1469815,MorganMan,2012-08-02 18:00:00,341,"I did a search to see if there was as much controversy about when you had to row a boat and some camps went to tiller motors but I couldn't find the thread! Lol, this has been an interesting thread.....thus many different camps I guess. Common demoninator is we all love to fish for walleyes!"
1469829,Hawkfan,2012-08-02 18:19:00,237,LOL...not to mention when they ditched the machete (sp?) for those fancy planes to get to a new lake! P.S. that guy that may or may not have talked in his sleep sounds like a pretty cool guy.
1469846,Aaron-IN,2012-08-02 18:45:00,500,"We did a fly-in to an outpost camp for the first time in years this past June. The cabin had a nice solar setup that ran the water pump, lights, and electric fridge, the only propane was for the water heater and stove. Granted it was sunny all week but that solar setup seemed to work perfect."
1469928,BennieS,2012-08-02 22:32:00,108,"Oh my Lord that makes me laugh, and smile. My son did the same thing one night for half the night oohing and ahhing the night away telling me, ""Pops get the net"", and ""oooooh this is a nice one"" and ""oh man what a pig"", and such. I told him the next day that he sure makes the most of his fishing time in Canada fishing all day, and all night and never losing a wink of sleep. That is the kind of stuff right there that makes walleye fishing in Canada special."
1469956,Skywagon,2012-08-03 05:50:00,1106,"Revitup: I use a cpap when at the outpost (solar), even in the winter when we are ice fishing and there is limited day light hours to charge the batteries. We are frugal with lighting, but power has not been an issue. I have also rigged a 12 volt cord up for my cpap and used a heavy duty 12-24 volt jump start unit to power it, before I figured the solar would handle it. I get the feeling the cpap's don't pull as much power as one would assume."
1469960,octanehi5,2012-08-03 05:59:00,1104,"The outfitter that I go with has a solar panel on the fish house that lights that at night and pumps the water,charges 12 volt batts,lights,water heating,cooking and fridge are all, propane no noise the way life should be in the north country"
1470002,Hillbiehle,2012-08-03 07:23:00,66,"Walleyski---- yes, Winoga Lodge - St. Joe. The outpost is just about nicer than my own home. That was the first time having such luxuries for me and it certanly made the trip that much more enjoyable."
1470011,tooski,2012-08-03 07:35:00,393,"Yes, Winoga on St Joe's was a great set up. Had a generator to re-charge the solar power if needed. I think we only started it once during the week. Quite the accomodations as Hill said."
1471818,MrSimon,2012-08-07 13:23:00,922,"I'm headed to a boat-in outpost cabin in a few weeks. The owner asked us if we wanted a generator for the week for an extra $50. I hadn't even considered it, but after thinking it over, we decided to rent it. We take tons of pictures and videos and it will be nice to re-charge batteries and run a laptop to download pics and videos off the cameras. It will also be very nice to have fully charged trolling motor batteries every day. And if we want the ever-so-coveted Canadian quietness ..... well, we can switch the darn thing off."
1471825,Hillbiehle,2012-08-07 13:35:00,66,"If I was taking a trolling motor battery, I'd definatley want the generator. I think $50 is money well spent."
1469462,revitup,2012-08-02 07:02:00,140,I've only done a fly in once--about 30 years ago. Now I use a cpap machine and figured i just couldn't do a fly in any more. These with solar--do they generate enough to power up a cpap machine for the night and do the cabins have outlets or do you need to come up with something of your own?
1469508,EddieNorth,2012-08-02 08:10:00,32,"We run our generator all night when people request it for the same purpose as you would need it,our cabins all have electricity run to them with outlets.We also have wireless internet,I know some eole dont like the internet in the bush but we need it to run the whole operation.Cheers,,,"
1469694,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-02 14:22:00,1460,"Yea Eddie, I talked with Vic Davis about the CPAP machines. He said that it's starting to be a regular occurance to fly in a small generator to accommodate all the snorers. I'm guessing that it's not only his clientele, eh? Maybe at all the high end camps, you install CPAP machines on every bunk. Maybe I can get some sleep."
1469713,tv4fish,2012-08-02 14:46:00,2694,"True story: One of my 2 buddies found out that he needed a CPAP machine on one of our trips to Canada. My 2 buddies both snore (of course, I don't ) and they sleep in one bedroom. Anyway, one night, the ""other"" buddy couldn't sleep and he was ""listening"" to the other one breathe. The other one stopped breathing and the awake one thought the other one had died. Scared the heck out of all 3 of us. Sooo - when the ""dead"" buddy got back to the states, he went in and got checked - sure enough -- sleep apnea. CPAP now goes with us every trip."
1469715,EddieNorth,2012-08-02 14:47:00,32,"Theres been a few people comlain about my snoring 3 cabins away,im not sure what all the fuss is i never hear a thing,,,,."

1469721,SinOrSwim,2012-08-02 14:52:00,1528,"We have one guy that knocks the walls down with his snoring.Then, you have my brother who talks in his sleep. One year, he started yelling (talking loudly) in his sleep.....NICE FISH.....OHHHH That's a nice fish!!!! LOLOLOL"
1469723,wallydave,2012-08-02 14:54:00,2151,Sooo does the snoring attract or scare away the bears??
1469757,5 of Diamonds,2012-08-02 16:01:00,151,revitup: It sounds like there may be some fly-ins again in your future!
1469789,Walleyeski,2012-08-02 17:04:00,40,"Hilliehle, is the ""Hilton"" you are referring to at Lake St. Joe's, Winoga Lodge Camp, sounds like the exact set up they have. Have taken my CPAP machine on every trip for the last 10 years. Never leave home without it! Going to a place this fall that I might have to bring a small generator along."
1469210,EddieNorth,2012-08-01 15:33:00,32,"We made a few changes at our Beteau Lake camp this year,we now have 3 solar panels that keep our batteries charged that run our 12 volt water pump and our on demand heater.We also have changed 16,,, 60 watt light bulbs to,,,, 16,,, 45 watt led bulbs that draw 7 watts each,thats 848 watts less power draw,we run the complete camp now off of a 2000 watt honda inverter/generator.We run 2 fridges,1 freezer,2 tvs,2 sat dishes with wireless internet all off the inverter and it never comes off of the eco throttle,super super quiet,,it only runs when we need it and it burns approx 5 gallons of fuel a week.When you live in the bush as long as I do believe me you want some TV and a few comforts of home.The plan is to slowly add a few more solar panels every year with a couple new propane fridges,freezers and eventually use the Inverter less and less.Cheers,Eddie"
1469226,SinOrSwim,2012-08-01 15:53:00,1528,"I always get a kick out of the ""anti"" generator crowd who look down their nose at people who enjoy the comforts of home WHILE they are fishing in Canada. Why is it bad to like both? God forbid we use an electric knife and charge our fish finders. lolOh and as solopaddler said, tough to see my cards when it's dark. I lose enough money, I don't need another handicap. LOL"
1469245,tooski,2012-08-01 16:38:00,393,"Sin, I am not anti-generator. As I was advised in the best beer thread- to each his own. I flew Eddies generator into Richter last year and we almost never used it. I just happen to prefer the quiet of the old propane camps. As far as seeing your cards, we use a coleman lantern and it serves the double duty of zapping skeeters. C'mon Mike, I have you by 20 years and the coleman is fine for cards and late reading. Plus when you turn it off you have a minute to get yourself to bed. What brand of generator did you take on all your solo canoe trips?"
1469252,tooski,2012-08-01 16:55:00,393,"Eddie, ""When you live in the bush as long as I do believe me you want some TV and a few comforts of home."" That's your view. My view is "" when you live with the comforts of home as long as I have believe me I don't want TV.""... Cheers, Joe T"
1469259,SinOrSwim,2012-08-01 17:11:00,1528,"Hey, I'm with ya on the propane camp and solar part. I just don't like to ""rough it"" so to speak. We go in late august/early september so we don't have to sleep in really hot cabins. I don't want to listen to a generator either. But, would take a little to have some comforts of home. Also, I was speaking in general and not directly toward you. Sorry if it came off that way."
1469266,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-08-01 17:33:00,235,This. Although I would try one with a generator. If the noise wasn't overbearing I would favor it.
1469268,phishfearme,2012-08-01 17:37:00,1242,"i think this thread is about outpost cabins - which to me means a single cabin on a lake - ie: isolation. needing a generator at an outpost cabin rules that cabin out for me. eddie north is supplying power for a small ""village"" - of which he is a part - for an entire season - i can't blame him for wanting AC electricity. we go to these outpost cabins for a week or so. i just don't think that those of us who want the isolation of the bush would ever want the noise of the city. even ""super super quiet"" is loud when you compare it to the ""green dark forest was to silent to be real"" as gord lightfoot puts it (canadian railroad trilogy) - and, it drowns out the loons. furthermore, the new DC/Solar technology with appropriate car battery energy storage rules out the need for any AC generation for lighting and water pumping (and using the new design propane fridges requires minimal propane). NO noise, NO moving parts, and the days last forever in the summer so any consumption for lights/pumping hardly touches the battery capacity. a noiseless inverter (12V DC to 110V AC) could be used to charge batteries. moose season may be more of a challenge - but coleman lanterns should suffice for these times. maybe we should also do a pole asking outfitters how many times someone used mixed gas (for 2 stroke boat motors) in his four stroke generator. my point is that the DC/Solar should be MUCH cheaper to operate in the long run for the outfitter of outpost cabins - and yet provide the quiet of the bush AND the comforts of home. phish"
1469275,Pikeslayer8,2012-08-01 18:04:00,1460,"Really good question/thread Campchick! Let me first say that I stand firmly with the anti-generator crowd. I like change in my fishcamp about as much as I like havin a blister on my casting thumb. Back when my outfitter brought running water into camp, we thought it was strictly for sissys. Carrying up water in a leaky 5 gallon bucket has always been ""what we do"". Then, couple of years later comes solar lighting. Oh man, was I up in arms over that one. Who doesn't like to light the gas lanterns when ya get back to camp after a long day's fishing. Oh, did I miss lighting and changing mantles, now all ya got to do is flick a dang switch. Gone are the easy days of cheating at cards cause the guy next to you has to hold out his cards just to see what he's got. On the plus side, lot less misdeals. The next thing that my outfitter had the gall to do, was to install a shower and bath sink. Almost a deal breaker for us. Whoever heard of such a thing in fishcamp? It has always been the program to trudge down to the dock in the morning with your towel and dopp kit. Nothin like that on one a those cool mornings in a drizzle or soft rain. Brrr. I tell ya what, if my outfitter even thinks about an inside toilet, I'm lookin for another lake. So yea, generator, just cause ya haven't seen the sun all week, come on, somebody has a flashlight."
1469311,5 of Diamonds,2012-08-01 19:31:00,151,"Been doing fly-ins for over 25 years. I can function fine w/ out one in the bush but the new Honda's you never hear running. Typically, we'll run the generator only a brief time. An hour or two in the morning and in the evening we'll start it up for 4 or 5 hours. Having the extra light to clean fish, prepare food, eat, all the activities that follow and the ability to recharge batteries in the evening is nice. The generator also eliminates our need to fly in excessive amounts of ice too keep the food fresh and the beer cold. The generator is turned off when we go to bed as it's not needed unless someone has to use a breathing machine for sleep apnea. This year I purchased and used a new Nebo rechargeable (wind-up) lantern. Very impressed as it gives off a decent amount of light, NEVER needs batteries or bulbs, very light for it's size and priced about $30. NO MORE PROPANE AND MANTLES. I'm looking forward to using this lantern for more fly-ins. Check Nebo out. I highly recommend them."
1469443,Hillbiehle,2012-08-02 06:19:00,66,"I think there are a few that are anti-generator either never expereinced how quiet and unnoticable or they simply went to camp where they were not installed with that peace and quiet in mind. I can take it or leave it, but I wouldn't let a generator turn me away from awesome fishing. Being able to charge my sonar batteries at night was great.Now...on another note, I took a firm stance when our outfitter was considering installing satellite internet. That I can do without and would most likely deter me from going to that particular outpost. I have no problem restraining myself from using, but listening to others in my party do office work is intolerable.Back to a generator...it's a non-issue, particularly if they are a Honda or Yamaha and installed with peace and quiet in mind."
1469139,campchick,2012-08-01 12:52:00,96,Needed some feedback on generators at outposts. Are you in favor? What about the noise? Do you feel being able to use electric appliances outweighs any noise? What about gas consumption? Ever have any maintenance issues? I know quite a few operators are going the generator route so it must be a good thing?
1469142,Mike Borger,2012-08-01 13:07:00,1554,"Most better camps have them these days, usually for suplemental lighting in the evening. Being able to charge a battery is a big plus as well in my books.The smaller units are already super quiet as it is, but I always bring a 50' extension cord and run it back in the bush a bit. That pretty much eliminates the noise completely.I'm definitely in favour of having them.Cheers"
1469143,tv4fish,2012-08-01 13:07:00,2694,"campchick: It looks like your questions are geared more for camp ""operators"" rather than outpost ""users"" ???I can only relate a personal experience. Years ago we signed up for an outpost ""experience"". The cabin that we were given was ""rustic"" (as the camp owner described it ). Our rustic cabin was right next to the camp's VIP cabin. VIP cabin had the one and only generator placed right by OUR cabin (of course - WE did not have electricity). **** generator ran all night long.SOO - if you want my feedback -- I would say that if the people want all the ""conveniences of home"" at an outpost --- than maybe they SHOULD just stay home."
1469150,Jig Man,2012-08-01 13:28:00,95,We rent a generator every year for our outpost trip. Use it to charge batteries for CPAP machines as well as batteries for depth finders. We only run it during the day while we are out fishing so the noise is not a problem.
1469151,a3dad,2012-08-01 13:32:00,115,I would not like to have generator noise in my camp. I can do without power for a week and actually prefer the solitude that it brings.
1469155,SinOrSwim,2012-08-01 13:44:00,1528,"Never been to an outpost with a generator. Ours always had solar electricity for lights at night, water pump and everything else was propane.I love having electricity but don't think I would want the noise. I can see the pros and cons though. Might be nice as a back up just in case the batteries don't charge from the solar. We always used the house batteries to charge our batteries. Took an inverter with us and plugged it to the battery with alligator clips. Worked great. Charge cordless knife and fish finder batteries etc."
1469156,jambi,2012-08-01 13:46:00,504,"Ditto this - My depth finder uses AAs, no need for electricity"
1469158,tooski,2012-08-01 13:48:00,393,"I'm in with TV-- if you want the conveniences of home, stay there. For Solo's pro-generator stance, they make a variety of solar panels that are very capable of charging most devices. Lord help us if we can't charge our electric filet knives...."
1469197,Mike Borger,2012-08-01 15:12:00,1554,"My ""pro"" generator stance LOL!Hey like I said the nosie isn't an issue and there's definite benfits.Have any of you ""anti"" generator guys tried to play cards at night in a shadowy, propane-lit outpost?These old eyes of mine appreciate the good lighting."
1469207,Hillbiehle,2012-08-01 15:29:00,66,"We stayed at a place last year with your typical solar electric. After the power was drawn down due to a couple of cloudy days, we fired up the Honda generator as instructed and didn't even know it was running. It was 50' from the cabin and under shed with the opening pointed away from the cabin. I will admit that the cabin we stayed in is called the ""Hilton"" as it was just like being at home (complete with an electric vacuum cleaner etc...). That being said, I wouldn't turn my nose up at cabin without a generator, but it was nice to fire up if needed. In actuallity we only ran it the day before we left, so the next guests had 100% supply just in case they expereinced a few more cloud days....."
