The wind has been a different direction every day and switching during the day.Steamboat is kicking out smaller fish than Mc Kenzie.Bouncers,spinners and crawlers have been the big fish ticket.Black flies were horrible,if you missed a spot with bug spray they found it quick. P.S. Bright yellow beads and a number 3 or 4 hammered silver blade have been the biggest producer so far.Bill.I am one with my bottombouncer."

1469083,WalleyeWally28,2012-08-01 10:58:00,298,Thanks for the report. We are headed up Friday with our Grandson (his 1st trip) and will be staying close to you at Whitewing but usually fish McKenzie and areas south into the main basin. You have really gotten us excited. Thanks again.
