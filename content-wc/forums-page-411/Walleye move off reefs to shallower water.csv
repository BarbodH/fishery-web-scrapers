1472163,Campcountry,2012-08-08 08:13:00,164,This past weekend I was catching good numbers of walleye down deep (30 to 45 feet) where I usually fish but I was also catching them casting off the dock in shallow water in the early evening. Many of the deep walleye had been eating crayfish - don't know if they found then down that deep or they had just been feeding in the shallows before heading deep. The could be just about everywhere you want to fish right now.
