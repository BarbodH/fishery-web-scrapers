Today run past Manitoba and Stoney Point to the main lake basin.Got on schools of big walleyes.Only caught 4 walleyes less than 18 inches,had 30 plus slot fish and a even dozen over the slot.Found islands with the wind blowing in,marked them in 16 to 18 ft.Bouncer,spinner,1/2 crawler and hang on.My wife kicked my fat rear end on big fish today.It's a long run from Goose Bay but well worth it.Back in the A.M. weather permitting.Bill,who is one with his bottombouncer"
