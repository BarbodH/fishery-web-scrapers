1472248,"6'3""",2012-08-08 11:15:00,47,Been going up for 26 years and I am not one to take many pics but thankfully one of our group has kept an album from the very beginning and I sure enjoy looking through that thing. You could change the faces on your pics to our faces and not know the difference from our trips and your trips
1472249,HeHooksHimself,2012-08-08 11:16:00,725,"I am sure every one of those pictures tells a story, don't it? (Props to that old Rod Stewart song). Just get ready for some busy bodies to tell you your walleyes are too big! Great memories."
1472274,MrSimon,2012-08-08 12:14:00,922,Oh the stories are endless! I guess I should put in my disclaimer that all pictures were taken before I joined the enlightened ranks of C&R fishermen. Back then we just ate everything we caught and didn't think twice about it. Live and learn I suppose.
1472292,Fishoil,2012-08-08 12:43:00,1277,Awesome pictures!! Thanks for sharing.

1472848,Mr. Muskellunge,2012-08-09 15:30:00,1,Great pictures! My dad tells me stories of when he used to go up to Canada with his grandparents and just park the camper at a lake and keep wheelbarrows full of northern and walleye. And that's why there are limits and slot rules...
1472861,JackSalmon,2012-08-09 15:56:00,169,Thanks for sharing that!
1472173,MrSimon,2012-08-08 08:36:00,922,"I recently found a stack of old photographs from some Canadian fishing trips my Grandfather took us on years ago. These trips had it all ... float planes, jacked up Jeeps, bush lakes, old motorhomes, outboards that never worked right, spam sandwiches, leaky boats, portages, river runs, and of course, loads of pike and walleye. Me, my brother and cousin didn't know it at the time, but Grandpa was exposing us to world class experiences that most people only dream about. Granted, he did everything on a shoe-string budget, but we didn't care. Its funny, the first trip was over 22 years ago ..... but I still remember it like it was yesterday."
