1472850,revitup,2012-08-09 15:33:00,140,Zman--did the new bridge making it accessible now for everyone the reason you say it USED to be a honey hole?
1472968,Glenman12,2012-08-09 18:41:00,762,ok..didnt realize after all these years that there were 3 lakes..maybe I was paying attention to the water hazards in the Ord too much...lol..fished the falls a few times and did real well..as for St Clair itself..lots of small walleyes and snake northerns as I remember it..
1471855,revitup,2012-08-07 14:36:00,140,"I will be fishing this area next year in June out of East Cedar Lake. I have an 18 ft. Lund with 115 Yamaha. Only other motor is my 80# Terrova on bow. My question is this--will I be able to get into Wabaskang, and if so how about lakes from there? Also the Ord river? Dates next year for my group is June 8-15. Thanks for all the info. BTW we are almost exclusively walleye fisherman. Which lakes/areas would you say are a must for a day of exploring?"
1472053,bigdaddyguns,2012-08-07 21:51:00,608,There is a series of waterfalls between Perrault and Wabaskang so no navigable water path is available.
1472160,zman8701,2012-08-08 08:11:00,100,"Rev it sounds like this is the first time fishing Cedar lake and my guess is your staying at either Keystone lodge or Cedar point resort. Now I am not trying to be a smart a$$, but are you going to Canada for a boat ride or to fish? All of Cedar is very easy to navigate with hazards marked by all the lodges. You don't have to travel out beyond Cedar to catch fish of all species. Learn to fish Cedar before you venture out looking for new spots on surrounding lakes. You can't fish all of Cedar in a week and when you find fish remember never leave fish to find fish."
1472239,revitup,2012-08-08 10:43:00,140,Hi zman. No this is not the first time I've fished cedar. Spent 5 years there a while back. Returning after a couple year absence and feel comfortable with many spots on east cedar. Thanks for telling me how I should spend my week though. Much appreciated.
1472451,go dart,2012-08-08 18:45:00,77,"Hey Rev. If your talking about Cedar that meets Perrault you'll cross at the burnt bridge ( with your motor raised a bit ). Shoot with a 115 you can fish Cedar-Perrault-Turtle-Spadina, and the Ord river. Do go easy in the river but there will be enough boats in there you won't go very fast anyway. Early June often finds the Walleyes in the river or points close by. Cedar's awesome but so are all those lakes. The falls would stop you before Wabaskang."
1472488,revitup,2012-08-08 19:31:00,140,Thanks a bunch. We've got a younger one in our group this coming year so a little exploring might be enjoyable. I appreciate all the comments. I'm new to this forum and have found it to be very informative and helpful.
1472524,Glenman12,2012-08-08 20:33:00,762,hey Dart..Ive been fishing Cedar for over 30 years..never heard of Turtle Lake..is that the lake under the road that goes to Cedar Point Resort?
1472603,zman8701,2012-08-09 06:10:00,100,The bridge you go under on CPR road is to Richmond lake. Turtle lake is the 2nd lake as you go down the Ord river. I believe the 1st lake is called NO Name lake.
1472727,Glenman12,2012-08-09 10:08:00,762,"fished Richmond for the first time this past June..caught several walleye in the 20-22"" range..wow were they dark..also caught my first Cedar Lake crappie in there I always thouht the 2nd lake on the Ord was called St Clair..at least thats what our old lodge owner called it about 20 yrs ago.."
1472736,zman8701,2012-08-09 10:30:00,100,"St Claire is the last lake of the three possible down the Ord river. The waterfalls ends all navigation by boat. That bridge is newly constructed this year. I used to portage across the road because you could not get under the old bridge by boat. That lake has been my honey hole for years, but not anymore. I've had several walleyes in the high 20's off the rock ledge on the NE side."
