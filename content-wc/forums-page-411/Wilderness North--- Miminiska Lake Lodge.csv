Probabably late in the season. Gulp would seem an option. Comments please . Paying a premium to be there so would like input as I don""t want to make a committment for four with open questions. Thanks in advance.----oldgordo we are experienced and this will be self guided."
1472541,adempsey,2012-08-08 21:37:00,963,"At that price it should include the bait. Most American Plans include the bait from my recollection. Wilderness North always looked like a nice outfitter though, but can't say I have any experience with them. A group of guys that stayed at the same lodge as us one year ranted and raved about Hawk Lake Lodge. It's also an upscale fishing outfitter. Might be worth a look. I'd love to go there myself."
1472548,Crede,2012-08-08 22:04:00,134,"I have never been to Miminiska but have been with Wilderness North a number of times and am booked with them again for 2013. 1) Wilderness North is a professional well-run business. We don't have to worry about things when we go with them. Things run smoothly and as advertised. 2) Their trips certainly cost a premium. Miminiska costs a significant premium. 3) They have always had minnows, crawlers, and leeches available for preorder at additional cost. Haven't heard that this would be different for next year. 4) Not sure when late in the season is. For 2012 Miminiska was only listed as available for June and August. 5) By reputation, Miminiska is a very good lake for both walleye and northern pike. Similar to Whitewater, Keezhik, Kagianagami, Makokibatan, Machawaian...i.e. good sized lakes in the general area, on or draining into a major river system, with the potential for both good size and numbers. On any given week, one of these lakes may be better than the others, but overall, I think they average out to being about the same with regards to quality of fishing. 6) Therefore, I think the cost difference among the above lakes (almost) entirely reflects differences in amenities. 7) If I ever go to Miminiska, I will get a guide for a day or two early in the trip. Your group may be different, but we have never regretted doing this on new, larger water."

1472590,Mike Borger,2012-08-09 05:21:00,1554,"I have fished Miminiska before as I paddled the Albany river. In my opinion Miminiska is nothing like the other lakes mentioned. It's a large widening of the Albany river and much of the best fishing is in current areas both entering and exiting the lake. The only comparable would be Makokabatten lodge downstream on the Albany.If you head upstream on the river from the lodge you'll come to Snake falls, a gorgeous spot for sure. The lodge used to maintain a trail around Snake falls with a boat/motor cached on the other side.Hopefully they still do as this enables you to motor upstream to Eskakwa and possibly Upper Eskakwa falls.Great brook trout fishing up there along with the walleye.The lodge itself is very very nice. I was running low on supplies when travelling through there and the lodge manager was incredibly friendly and helpful.So was a young blonde who worked in the lodge kitchen, but that's another story LOL!"
1472836,sansmoniker,2012-08-09 14:55:00,2,"I've stayed at Miminska twice and Striker's Point twice over the years through Wilderness North. Miminiska is pretty easy to fish for walleye, just go to one of the 4 or 5 river inlets that come into the lake. With all of the river inlets, locating fish wasn't too hard; I wouldn't bother with a guide if you are experienced. That said, the walleye fishing was ok for a fly in, but not spectacular numbers or size. We also had very little luck finding large northern pike. The cabins at Miminiska are very spacious and nice looking Â– nicer than anything I've stayed at in a drive-to camp - however, mice were a real problem on both trips to Miminiska. A combination of poor pike fishing and seeing multiple mice every day led us to try Wilderness North's Striker's Point Lodge a few years ago. The first trip to Striker's Point was great; much better pike fishing, good service, and quality cabins without mice. It was a great value. However, after a trip back to Striker's Point this year, I don't think we will be going back in the next few years. The fishing was adequate, but everything else was chaotic and not run like a premium price camp. Without going through all the details, the camp was understaffed and ill-prepared, the motors had multiple mechanical issues (and not just our group), and the meal offerings dropped a few notches in quality. Wilderness North also used to operate their own air service but have now since contracted that out. Wilderness North is a big operation that significantly expanded just before the recession; I wonder if money problems may be cutting into operations. Maybe my last experience was just localized to Wilderness North's Striker's Point operation or just happened to be a bad week, but I don't know. I'd be interested in hearing if others have had better experiences with them this year."
1472869,phishfearme,2012-08-09 16:09:00,1242,"let me add some thoughts to the posts by solo and sansmoniker first - i think the ""sansmoniker"" handle is right up there with other great handles on this site second - i've done two canoe trips down the albany thru miminiska lake. on the first trip in 1991 - BEFORE the lodge was open - we had some of the most incredible walleye and pike fishing right where the albany river comes into miminiska lake. literally hundreds of walleye to maybe 20 inches and a good many trophy pike hanging around to dine on the walleye. it was almost too effortless. we decided to do another albany river canoe trip a number of years later after the lodge opened - same time of year as the first. the lodge had designated this area as the ""walleye mine"". well, when we got there - after days of building excitement - the walleye mine was mined out!! not a fish to be had and constantly two or three lodge boats there trolling back and forth have little luck also. we left almost as fast as we got there and had the type of excellent fishing we expect down at petawanga lake just down river from miminiska falls. the above - and many other examples i could provide as well as the other two posts mentioned - show clearly how fishing pressure can impact these lakes. it's a beautiful lodge and i'm sure the food and service is wonderful - but that's not why i spend big buck to go to the great white north. so, caveat emptor - ask the lodge owner for a number of names of guests who've been there before the same time as you are planning to go. and ask each of these people what their experience level is concerning flyin canadian fishing. some people are happy with a dozen fish a day. and like solo said, this lake should not in any way be compared with something like keezik. hope you have a great trip, phish"
