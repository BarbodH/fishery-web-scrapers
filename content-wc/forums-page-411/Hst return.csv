1468770,GNO,2012-07-31 18:17:00,153,"For the outfitter/resort owner to do the on the spot rebate, a deposit of 25% is required. I do not have a link, but I do have the paperwork stating I must collect it to give the rebate. Any resort, outfitter, or guy that runs tours can give the rebates if they have a tax number and collect HST as long as the packages they sell qualify."
1468989,phishfearme,2012-08-01 07:59:00,1242,"a number of other outfitters we've used have also used the 25% deposit value - it's interesting that the link that TV provided says that 20% is the number - i don't think it's even remotely possible that there could be two government documents that conflict with one another. the key point is that there's no reason why an outfitter should not offer this service (with due respect to Vbay) - and i plan to make it a requirment for future trips. i'm simply tired of getting run around by the gov: - refusing claims for no reason, - reducing claims for no reason, - simply ignoring claims (when you send in the original receipt and it gets ""lost"", you are SOL) and - back when the US$ was much higher, we would pay in US$ but get the rebate check in canadian$ with no rate correction - then have to let the US bank take their fee when cashed. i figure my group is out over $2000 in the last 7-8 years - and for no good reason. and, concerning tooski's correction of my aledged mistakes - payback could be a biitch!! i'll be watching!! and besides, nothing could possibly beat the errors associated with living in and rooting for teams from the ""mistake on the lake"". phish"
1472315,flipdip,2012-08-08 13:17:00,27,"TIGHTLINER,I sent you a PM. Shoot me an e-mail when you get a chance.[email protected]"
1468464,tooski,2012-07-31 08:25:00,393,Absolutely agree with Phish (and apparently GNO). If the outfitter isn't willing to do the paperwork then I'll find one that will. Going into Larus in a week and Nestor falls is doing exactly that.
1468467,tv4fish,2012-07-31 08:29:00,2694,"I don't think John is classified as an ""Outfitter"" (plus we don't pay 25% down, either) - he runs a resort and does do some fly-ins. As I said -- years ago they handled it, then when it was changed to HST - they DID try to do it themselves for us. And they ran into the same problems as others have stated on this thread - some got OK'd - some didn't. If you use an ""Outfitter"" and he does the rebate for you (and they all go through) --- great!"
1468471,phishfearme,2012-07-31 08:36:00,1242,"if he has to collect taxes (and i assume forwards them to the gov) then he is in the outfitting business. call him what you want - he's in the outfitting business. as far as i know, there's nothing to ""go through"" for the outfitter - he only collects 1/2 of the HST and sends that much to the gov - nothing more. the only thing i know of is that he has to collect a deposit of at least 25%. i have no idea why this ""deposit thing"" should be as such. phish"
1468515,tv4fish,2012-07-31 10:00:00,2694,We MAY be doing this to this topic - But where are you getting the 25% from? The following is one of the best info. sheets I have found on this subject. (Go to Page 6)http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gi/gi-032/gi-032-e.pdf
1468527,tooski,2012-07-31 10:24:00,393,"TV, I don't think we are beating it to death. Your info page has this quote ""a deposit of at least 20% of the total price for the eligible tour package is paid by the non-resident."" as a requirement, so Phish is a little off on his 25% guess. I think it is an interesting thread and definitely helpful. Nestor Falls required a slightly higher deposit for us to qualify for the ""instant rebate"" and it is certainly worth it."
1468533,tv4fish,2012-07-31 10:34:00,2694,"tooski: appreciate your comment - But phish said he ""knew"" it was 25% - and I think others have posted that same 25% - so I was just curious where that came from. Quote: the only thing i know of is that he has to collect a deposit of at least 25%"
1468538,v-bay gord,2012-07-31 10:41:00,3168,Phish....possibly I could but the 25% deposit is a stumbling block for me. I do the paperwork for my guests (all they have to do is sign it) and mail it in for them. Seems to work fine so far. I would not consider doing the instant rebate and being left to hang out to dry if something was to change down the road.

1468640,tooski,2012-07-31 13:40:00,393,"TV- maybe this helps explain Phish's comments.. ""joe's right - that's the second time joe's properly corrected me."" So I guess now it's three times. And if he wasn't a Pittspuke fan I wouldn't bring it up."
1468656,tv4fish,2012-07-31 14:10:00,2694,tooski: LOL -- I appreciate your sense of humor -- (hopefully phish will also )

1466729,Guest,2012-07-26 16:56:00,0,What 2 services do you use for the claim?
1466832,v-bay gord,2012-07-26 21:48:00,3168,"You only need one eligible service......I use ""fish cleaning'"" which I highlight on my invoice. So far it has worked fine."
1468267,bigwalleye1,2012-07-30 18:53:00,2632,Inquirin' minds want to know.....
1468276,phishfearme,2012-07-30 19:09:00,1242,"v-bay - could you provide the rebate directly? that is, you offer one eligible service and if you request a deposit of 25% or more then you should be able to refund the rebate directly.(?) it seems this would be MUCH easier for the government and you AND ESPECIALLY the customer. thanks, phish"
1468357,GNO,2012-07-30 21:49:00,153,Phish - It can be done. I do it all the time for the packages we offer that meet the requirements. I sent in and got written clarification which of my packages qualified and which ones did not.
1468388,phishfearme,2012-07-31 04:50:00,1242,"thanks GNO - i think you are right on the money here. i noted from one of your previous posts that some outfitters may feel uncomfortable doing this as the gov may come back at them later. if they feel that way just think how we feel being totally at the mercy of the government with no recourse at all - at least you have some leverage. i've had some of my rebate applications ignored, denied or reduced - and there's nothing i can do about it from the states. i think from now on i'm going to insist that the outfitter provide the rebate on-site and if they don't want to do it then i'll go to one who will. this is NOT an insignificant amount of money. thanks, phish"
1468452,tv4fish,2012-07-31 07:52:00,2694,"All I do is submit the Invoice that we receive from John/Alina at the Red Pine Lodge - John has all of the services listed that ""can"" be provided at the bottom of his Invoice. I don't add anything in addition to what is shown on the Invoice. I think a few years ago John ""checked out"" what would be the best way to handle the HST rebate and found out that it was better/easier for the groups to handle their own rather than for him to do it. FYI - Back when it was the GST/PST - Verne/John WOULD credit us with 1/2 what we had paid and then deduct it right off our bill. Just another reason why we keep going back to the Red Pine."
1468455,phishfearme,2012-07-31 07:56:00,1242,"""I think a few years ago John ""checked out"" what would be the best way to handle the HST rebate and found out that it was better/easier for the groups to handle their own rather than for him to do it."" how could it POSSIBLY be easier for clients to handle it this way??? it's only easier for the outfitter - but he has direct links to the gov while we have none. phish"
1468460,GNO,2012-07-31 08:04:00,153,"It is definitely easier for the customer if the outfitter does it and you are credited the money instantly, no waiting. I believe it easier for the me to do it as a service for the customer rather than make the customer do it and then have to fill out the form, send it in, wait, maybe have the govt make adjustments or possibly refuse, then receive a Canadian funds check. If the rebate gets adjusted or denied, I sure do not want to have to spend time trying to explain to my customer why they did not recieve what I could have done for them on the spot."
1462091,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-16 09:33:00,223,just wanted to let everyone know that i filed for my groups hst on june 4-12 after we got back from our week at melchett lake with awo. I just got the check today in the mail it was printed on july 9 th and today is july 16 th. I mailed the printed form in and attached the original bill and let them take it from there. I have found this is the best way to do it that way there are no questions as to what we are going to get back. In years past my figures were not the same as theirs but within $5.00 so this is the best way i have found. Also remember it cost close to $1.00 for postage.
1462094,hoppy63,2012-07-16 09:44:00,367,Where do you get printed form? I still have last years to send off. I believe you have 1 year?
1462100,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-16 09:56:00,223,I THINK I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH FOR CANADIAN MINISTRIES AND FOUND IT UNDER CANADIAN REVENUE AGENCY. I PRINTED ABOUT 10 OF THEM OFF BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING FOR HOURS. KEEP WATCHING THIS THREAD SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE THE WEB SITE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ASKING THIS SAME QUESTION.
1462145,jimirjr,2012-07-16 11:31:00,1149,I wonder if We can claim this credit with a HOUSEBOAT Package... vs cabin / boat package?
1462160,tsquared,2012-07-16 11:51:00,57,my houseboat HST was refused as it did not include a service. Would like to hear if others have had any success on the houseboat....
1462162,Guest,2012-07-16 11:58:00,0,the website is www.cra.gc.ca 8005659353 I mailed my form and copy of bill from goosebay camp on 6/11 called today claimed they do not have copy of bill (I placed it in the same letter with form how could they lose it) what a joke called today and said they will checkout folder and call me later in week will keep you guys informed james wolf fort lauderdale florida $42 rebate
1465750,hoppy63,2012-07-24 16:33:00,367,What is postage for mailing from US?
1465759,TIGHTLINER,2012-07-24 17:04:00,223,I think it is about 85 cents give or take a nickle either way. The first year I mailed it I needed 11 cents more than what I had on it and it was returned to me that lost about 2 weeks just in mail time.
1465795,hoppy63,2012-07-24 18:01:00,367,Thank you
1466120,maddogg,2012-07-25 12:05:00,178,Remember your outfitter must supply some type of service such as fly in or boat shuttle is ok. Lodging and boat and motor do not qualify.
