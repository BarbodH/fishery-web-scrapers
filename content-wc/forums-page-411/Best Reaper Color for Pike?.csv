I was wondering what my best choice for color would be? I was thinking Pearl or Black. Thanks. Here is the link: http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Minda...html#multiview"

Natural are all the various earth tones and bright are yellows, pinks and neons. Arguably you could say the white is bright and black is natural. If I really like something I buy one color from each category - or sometimes just two (white/bright and natural/black).So, if it were me I would get the black neon, meta pearl and maybe the watermelon candy, but I bet black and white would cover you just fine."

1470388,Mike Borger,2012-08-04 06:47:00,1554,"I use black, white and chartreuse for pike, that's it. Overall white has probably been my best color with black a close second.If it's a jig head you're using to rig them, make sure to use an appropriate size.I use Esox Cobra Head jigs, they're pretty sweet.Most of my shallow water fishing with reapers is done using a variety of weighted swimbait hooks. The ones with weight on the shank and the screw in eye."

Choose 3 from this list:http://www.ebait.com/BaitRigsEsoxCobraReaperTails.htmlI was thinking Black Chartreuse, Firetiger, and White. They come in 3 packs, so that's the reason for 3.Not to beat this topic like a dead horse, but for those who have used this rig in the past, did you go with the 1/2 oz, 3/4 oz, or 1 oz? Anything more than a 1/2 oz for late May pike in the shallows seems too heavy."
