Yesterday morning dad caught a 42"" northern and I wanted to weigh it so I grabbed my bran new digital scale. After this thing not zeroing right and the load cell giving up I grabbed my brothers and his new one did the same thing. So I tell my story at camp at lunch time to Gail and by supper I had a new analog scale sitting in my chair. I told Gail to put it on my bill and how grateful I was. She said steve ran in to Kendra and grabbed one for us. This is the type of people they are. Words cannot explain how much I love this place. I was here one month ago and was suppose to go to a different place this week but I told my dad and brothers how much easier it is here and all the work we will have to do at the other place. So we canceled, lost our deposit and rescheduled here at witch bay for another week. I believe their motto is to do all the work for you so you can spend as much time on the water as possible. Here is some of the things that are super nice to me Reserved spot at the dock so I can put tackle that I don't want to use Clean towels every day Dock boys come and talk to you about your day, will get you bait and take your fish Free ice They clean the fish for you and freezer wrap it, however yesterday morning we brought in so much that me and my brother cleaned them just because I felt kinda bad dumping that much fish on them. Besides I needed to break the rust off my cleaning skills Breakfast, lunch and supper is served to you. You get a big meal with seconds if you wish. Today for lunch we had camp fish fry and tonight we had BBQ chicken over a wood grill. Tomorrow for supper will be steak. Of course you get soup and salad before you meals. People are friendly if they chose to be. Last month we had a state I will not name, a few older guys that didn't say hi, didn't say thanks, didn't wave out on the water. I guess they thought their chit didn't stink. We get Internet at the restaurant if you want which is where I am now. They give you welcome gifts consisting of a coffee cup and towels They have guides that will take you out and show you where to get smallies, eyes, northerns, muskeys and perch. Tips welcome but not needed. They will set you up with shore lunch if you want or sandwiches if you don't want to come back in for lunch. How this place is over booked is beyond me. I don't think a lot of people know about it. If you are looking for a place to go and want to take your family or just guys trip, check out their web site and give them a call"
