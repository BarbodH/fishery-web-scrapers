Lots of good communication with the owners but wondering if any WC recent visitors have any fishing reports/hotspots that they would like to share.It's an all brother and son trip with 3 of the 7 having never fished in Canada before this trip.Thank you in advance for anything you can share

I don't have a good map but what I can tell you is to move constantly. If you aren't catching fish move somewhere else, doesn't have to be far, just varied structure. I'll be going in a couple weeks, over Labor Day week, so let me know how you did up there!Mack"
