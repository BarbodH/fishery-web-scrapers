1471107,houndog,2012-08-06 05:35:00,365,"It's been a few years since I've fished Gull Rock. The last few times we actually had a rough time catching eaters. The lake association started a slot well in advance of the OMNR. I've taken many large walleyes on the lake. I would with out a doubt fish it again. You have access to 5 lakes by water, excellent structure and can usually get out of the wind!"
1471206,johnboat,2012-08-06 09:14:00,2014,10 years in a row at Gull Rock for me. There is a ton of info in the archives as it is a quite popular place. Check them out. There will be some good reading and plenty of good advise. Go. You won't be dissapointed. Couldn't be happier with Five Lakes Lodge.

We usually catch as many walleye as we need to eat (and to keep from getting bored) and sometimes a supprise northern. 40+ inch northerns are not that unusual on Gull Rock. They are a lot of fun on light gear and it might take 45 minutes or so to land one. Make the trip, it's worth it."
1471313,Guest,2012-08-06 13:47:00,0,Just got back from there and the fishing was good. Best bite was early AM to 10:30ish and then again from 5:00 to around 8:30 PM. Caught fish all day but those were the optimal times. Blueberry picking is just reaching it's prime and the mushrooms are popping also right now. Great lake and wish I was there right now instead of typing this. Good Luck if you go up. The fall fishing only improves as the season progresses.

1471435,jkwildhunting,2012-08-06 18:31:00,361,"copy what everyone else has said.....excellent fishery you can pick and choose how,what structure, and where you wanna fish. Quite a few islands to pick from, there are shallow bays if you go early or late in season for northern/walleyes, deep water reefs it has a variety of structure you can pick a choose from.Five lakes is the camp we stay at and it a top notch resort.If you want some other info bout the camp feel free to drop me a message.Joe"
