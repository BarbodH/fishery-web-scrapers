570338,Richard B,2007-12-30 21:55:00,735,Has anybody stayed at Happy Day Lodge on Windermere Lake? If so how is the lake? The resort owners? Were they helpful about putting you on fish? What were facilities like? How busy was the lake? Thank you for any information.
570339,Guest,2007-12-31 01:00:00,0,"My wife and I was there for 10 days the last of July and first of August in 2006. Walleye fishing was great up at the waterfalls 6 miles from camp but only for 1.5 hour after daybreak and 1.5 hour at sundown. If you don't have a plotter and GPS navigation, your 6 mile return at night will be out of a horror show due to hard turns, rocks and look alike bays and side channels waiting to take you to places that won't return you back to camp. Never caught a pike the whole 10 days. The walleyes we caught were really on the small side and you couldn't buy a walleye on an trolled artificial lure. Crawlers and minnows worked but only early and late. It was a nice place but only average. We probably won't return due to below average fishing results but the owners are great people."
570343,Rich B,2007-12-31 20:52:00,1081,"Richard, I've been up to Happy Day Lodge 3 times (twice this year) and have enjoyed each visit (Sept '06, June '07 & Sept '07). To answer your questions: The owners (Bob & Sondra) keep a very clean camp, and the cabins are well maintained with electricity, decent ramp if you bring in your rig (I brought in my 1900 Pro-V each time). Good dockage, and most of all the guests keep coming back year after year. Bob will take you out to show you good spots to fish, and you have a lot of back bays, etc to fish by yourself...you will see a few other boats from the camp from time to time, but most of the time if you want to get away, you can do so. This is a beautiful lake surrounded by a Provincial Park with only Happy Day Lodge (and a handful of private owned cabins) guests. My wife and I saw a bear and several Moose on our June trip this year. I also found the fishing to be ""average"" most days, with almost all the walleyes to be 10"" - 14"" or so....we've caught a few decent pike, (3 - 6 lbs or so) though didn't fish for them. Caught all the walleye we needed for large fish fries, and plenty to bring home. To catch the walleye in this lake, you need to fish a jig and minnow (or half a crawler) on the bottom; or use a bottom bouncer and worm harness. I will say that guys that have fished this lake for years had better success than we did for larger walleyes (3 lbr's+); and there are a lot of large fish in this lake (though we didn't tie into any of them - unfortunately). All in all this is a very nice drive-in camp on a good fishing lake, that is priced right. The one down side is that if you are a new customer (such as myself) your week goes from Sat - Friday, as they need you to leave Fri am so they can clean the camp (guests that have more seniority can stay Sat - Sat). If you're seriously interested in this camp, book early as this camp does fill at about 100% each year. They are putting in a slot limit on the walleyes this next year, which should help this lake improve the size of the walleyes (there are plenty of small ones). Email me if you have any other questions....and yes, take a GPS with you....it will save you a lot of time and possible grief trying to find your way back to camp. Faith, Family, Friends......and Fishing ! Rich B"
570379,jerry bark,2008-01-03 08:07:00,822,"I've been going there for quite a while and I can tell you that the walleye fishing is pretty much like the above posters mentioned. though i have learned the lake over time and we catch a lot of fish up into 20-22"" in some of the out of the way spots. henna lake for example can produce some really nice fish. as far as trolling crankbaits goes my best day for numbers last summer was trolling a shad rap and we had steady action on eaters all morning. probably 30 fish for two of us, the same spot was on FIRE the year before on rainy morning when an f-7 rapala in orange would hardly get wet before being bit. jig and minnow is a good producer there, a lot of folk slip bobber with minnows, so is trolling with a crawler harness. I have found that on windy days the eyes will pile up in certain spots and i can often find a spot that will produce 100 fish if the wind is just right. if the mayflies are hatching you can troll the rock piles out in musk bay and hook up two walleyes every pass of the pile until the sun clears the trees in the morning. this last summer i did really well running a 3 ounce bouncer with a large minnow on a crawler harness. we ran these over some rock piles with real good success using the bow-mount on setting 1, i would get hit each time the bait came down the shady side of the pile. this lake has amazing smallmouth fishing if you like that. i have caught many 4+ pounders. the pike fishing on windemere is not hot and heavy, but there are many nice pike in there. you won't find any (well i have not found one yet) of the pike filled weed beds that some canadian lake have. there are some scattered weedbeds that hold pike out on the flats and out past nicholson on the way to the outpost. I'm sure there are plenty i have not found. I mainly catch pike while fishing for walleyes. If you go there and want to go pike fishing then you can portage over to goldie lake. in early spring goldie lake is amazing! just cast the shoreline structures and you will catch all you want. nice smallmouth in there too. all in all its like any other lake: you have to learn the lake to do really well. some lakes you can learn easily, others not so easily. I will say this, if you get there and its sunny/high pressure all week you might as well fish for smallies, portage into goldie for pike or go exploring. i have never had more than a few fish per day when the weather is that nice, and those fish will be at dawn and dusk. the comments on traveling the lake are right on. you can get lost real easy when all those bays and openings start to look the same (even during the day...). a handheld gps is very helpful. I do not stay out after dark anymore unless i am very close to camp, i did stay out too late once and had to follow the shore for an hour to get back because i could not figure out where the heck the right opening was to get back tot he channel. lesson learned! the lodge is the only lodge on the lake, and there are 15 or so private cottages on the lake. if you travel more than a few miles from camp you will not likely see anyone all day unless you are fishing one of the spots marked on the camp maps. the owners are great and will do anything reasonable to make your trip enjoyable. they also do not oversell the fishing if you call and talk with them. they are making lots of improvements expanding cabins and adding better bathrooms, Sondra believes that clean bathrooms is what brings back the wives and wives bring husbands! the one year when i ran short on time i emailed our grocery list to sondra and she bought all our groceries in town on tuesday and had them in the cabin when we arrived. I guess i would say that if you measure your trip by the number of walleyes caught look elsewhere, but if you measure by other factors as well you might like it there. of those who i have referred to HDL all have gone back like rich b and his group. that says something. cheers jerry"
1420229,Guest,2012-04-12 16:54:00,0,Fishing is great and all depends on the weather. Sometimes they advertise for trophy fish but won't let you keep them. Also they give preference to repeat customers. I think that all customers should get the same consideration.
1458426,MrSimon,2012-07-06 12:02:00,922,"Why would you WANT to keep a trophy fish? They don't taste nearly as good as smaller ones, and replicas are a much better way to mount the fish than traditional taxidermy. There is absolutely no reason to keep a large fish. A lodge that understands this and promotes C&R will certainly get my business. Regarding customer consideration .... its good business and common industry practice to allow guests, at the end of their stay, to reserve a cabin for the same week next year. Its good for everyone. Repeat customers are the best customers, so fostering those relationships is a good thing. I've enjoyed reading this thread and hope the info helps me do well in six weeks when I spend a week at the Happy Day Outpost cabin. Yes, it was tough getting a reservation, but I called early (meaning last fall) and was flexible with my schedule. I've talked to Bob a couple of times and he seems like a stand up guy who knows his stuff. I will post a trip report when I return."
1471662,Frankie65,2012-08-07 09:07:00,9,"I agree 100 %. The size restrictions that the Zimmerman's have worked with the MNR on are all about turning Windermere into the trophy fishery that it has the potential to be.I spoke with Bob last year when our family was up for a week (returning again in less than three weeks) he is passionate about the lake. It is great to see an operator genuinely care about the fishery. Seriously there are plenty of walleye in the lake under 18"", and, they are the better eaters. They don't oversell the fishing on the lake, and, never have I seen or heard them ""promise"" trophy fish. They DO provide great hospitality, reasonable rates, great accomodations, a fantastic family setting (if you wish to bring children) and an absolutely beautiful northern lake to spend your vacation time on.Cheers,Frank"
1471668,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 09:15:00,1528,"I agree and don't understand why people feel the need to keep the fish? Our local bait shop encourages people to bring in their big fish to take pictures???? In the last month there have been pictures of a 27"" and 29"" walleye. As soon as a fish in our local lake hits the size limit, it's pretty much gone."
1471695,tv4fish,2012-08-07 10:03:00,2694,Did Southpaw's original post get deleted??? All I see is the lodge giving him some grief?? It would be nice to see WHY???
1471802,MrSimon,2012-08-07 12:54:00,922,I think its water under the bridge now. Everyone has different opinions ... and that's fine .... and that's why there are lots of different lodges in Ontario with a variety of approaches to fishing and resource management. There is something for everyone.
1471922,IA JOE,2012-08-07 17:40:00,35,"I believe that as people (lodge/camp owners) become more educated on fisheries management and angler pressure increases taking of a trophy fish will(should) be a rare event. The options to lodge owners are simple (but not easy) limit the number of anglers or limit the size and numbers of fish harvested. Once angling pressure reaches a braking point old fish can not be replaced as fast as they are harvested. Yes that 30""er maybe on her last leg but its a sure bet if she is harvested no one else will have the thrill of bringing her to the boat. I fished a little known public pond for years. My buddy and I both caught and released a 24"" large mouth several times a year for three years. Then one day we noticed her picture at the bait shop. It was truly a sad day. We thought she would die of old age in that small pond. Back to the issue. Even lodges on the mighty Lac Seul have no fish over 18"" rules. Lets save/improve the fishery ""let her go so she can grow""."
1472117,MrSimon,2012-08-08 06:32:00,922,"I agree. But its not just the big ones that we should let go. For many decades, guys have been going to Canada with a main goal of bringing back as many fish as their trucks can haul. I remember my first trip as a boy with my grandfather. There were five of us fishing and we each kept six walleye and six pike per day. Do the math, that's 300 fish killed during that week. If you do some extrapolation, assuming not everyone limits out every day, and assuming 5 groups at the camp per week for 20 weeks ..... that's somewhere between three and four thousand fish getting killed each year. Even the big Canadian shield lakes can't sustain a good fish population under that kind of pressure. Now imagine a really big lodge that can hold 40 or 50 people per week. It's conceivable that one lodge could result in 50,000 fish getting killed per season. I'm a huge fan of slot limits, but I'm also a HUGE HUGE fan of significantly lower creel limits. If I were in charge, I'd institute a combined 2 fish creel limit across all species ... well, maybe not for perch, crappie and other panfish. But for pike/walleye/bass/trout, I just don't see a need to keep more than two fish per day."

In most cases in Ontario the amount of walleye you can legally have in your posession is equal to a one day limit. So truckloads of fish should not be happening.I completely agree with you, though, keep a few for some meals during your stay. Take a few home with you if you so desire, but, don't decimate the fishery.Back to the original subject of this thread. One practise that Happy Day uses is a reduced rate for guests that have a conservation license. Just another way to keep the kill numbers down."
1472167,MrSimon,2012-08-08 08:23:00,922,I believe they also offer a free photo-book to conservation license buyers.
1338040,jaggersr,2011-08-07 07:52:00,44,I spent a few weeks at happy day lodge last year and will be there for my second and third week later this month. Your responce is missing some info that I think warrents being said. The Zimmermans are working very closely with the MNR and the district bioligist for Windermere. I personally have had many conversations with Bob and Sondra about what the MNR recommended and Happy Day Lodge are trying to create. The Bioligist recommended they shut their ramp off to campers and manage the lake by the number of clients they have at their camp. The slot limit on Windermere was voluntarily inacted by Happy Day lodge in an effort to improve the fishery. It was a big concern of both Bob and Sondras that they would upset people if they followed the bioligist recommendations. THey knew very well that it would cost THEM money in the short term and even friendships. I applaud Bob for having a set and being willing to forgo their personal short term gain to invest in the future of Windermere and ultimatly create a top quality fishery.
1338195,jaggersr,2011-08-07 18:21:00,44,"Out of respect for the Zimmermans I will not post any longer to this thread. Southpaw, I see you are new to Walleye Central. Welcome.....I would recommend Prairie Bee, Wakami, Wennebegon to your friend if he wants to camp. As you probably know Prairie Bee and Wakami have ramps. Wennebegon needs an ATV/Rack/Boat, unless you come in from the north. I will be fishing Wennebegon starting Friday for a few days then trying to catch up to a bear starting the 15th."
1338401,southpaw,2011-08-08 13:16:00,2,"Good luck to all your fishing and hunting there this year. I didn't mean to upset you. I know that they are trying to do the right thing, but guess just think that sometimes rules can be broken under right situations."
1338569,Guest,2011-08-08 21:40:00,0,"Southpaw, We will forward your concerns to the MNR and OPP for their review and records. I would recommend that you personally call the Chapleau MNR office and share your opinion with them. The MNR's Phone Number is 705- 864-3139 Att: Tim Mutter  Conservation Reserve Manager. We are a family that will not be intimidated or change our policies due to threats. Our family has strong values and beliefs and we run our business under these ethics. We have posted the contact number for everyone to view in case there are any questions regarding the recommendations that were given to us. We as a family will not live in fear and shame of anyone who feels the need to threaten us to concede to their will. As you may or may not know, our lodge is located on private property. Therefore, we do have policies and rules for our guests to follow. In response to us trying to be a 5 star fishery, we will never know if we do not first try to achieve this goal. A man who can only complain of not reaching his goal is a man who doesn't give an initiative in reaching his goals. A goal is only achieved thru hard work, sacrifices, dedication, self discipline, and the support and love of his family. We are a family owned business and believe me I, Bob will continue to keep my family and their ethics in line with mine. I will not disrespect my wife or sons in the way that you have suggested. They have contributed and sacrificed in the building of this business, that we have today, and in no way could I possibly find it in my heart to disrespect their efforts and contribution as you have asked me to. Remember a smart man will not disrespect the hand that assists him. Yours truly, Bob Zimmerman Happy Day Lodge and Prairie Bee Camps P.S. Southpaw  I will be contacting John C. and Bob W. in respect to your post."
1338593,Mike Borger,2011-08-09 03:40:00,1554,"Nice reply Bob.Personally I can understand both sides of the coin here.Effectively cutting off lake access to many people especially locals can't possibly foster good will.On the other hand adhereing to the MNR's policy is in your own best interests and the long term health of the lake. And as you mention it is private property.dam ned if you do, dam ned if you don't.In any case it speaks volumes that your establishment is constantly booked with repeat customers when many other outfitters are struggling.You and your operation are held in very high regard by a lot of people so you must be doing something right.Cheers, Mike"
1339181,southpaw,2011-08-10 19:09:00,2,"Bob,I think that you may have mistaken me for someone else!!! I have no idea who John C is or Bob W is. that you put in the PS."
