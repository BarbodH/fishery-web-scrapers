1468795,nwont,2012-07-31 18:54:00,16,"Water is gonna be low unless we get some rain soon, it is up river anyway. Haven't been to Melchett, but it should get a little pressure this weekend with the Aroland Fish Derby going on."
1468839,flipdip,2012-07-31 19:52:00,27,"Thanks. Sorry, but what do you mean by pressure this weekend?"

1471747,flipdip,2012-08-07 11:21:00,27,"Thanks and good to hear. We have experienced both high water and low water levels in the many trips we've had to Melchett. As you said, the fishing has always been fantastic. Low water just means we'll have to be little slower boating in a few spots.Which part up river were you in?"
1471849,nwont,2012-08-07 14:24:00,16,"I was on Stewart, about an hour boat ride down river from the bridge."
