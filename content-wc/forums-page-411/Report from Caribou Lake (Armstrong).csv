Fish were mainly 18-22 feet deep. Mainly used gold whistler jigs, gold fuzz e grubs, and orange or chartruese fireball jigs tipped with a leech.Still think it's the best walleye fishing for the money. Stayed a week, rented a Lund 1700 with 60 hp 4 stroke, cost split between 3 was at total of $390.60 each including tax. Could save a little more by renting a smaller boat and motor, but to me it's worth the extra 100 bucks per week."

Any lakers on your trip this year, or did ya even try for em? Caribou Lake Lodge sounds like a very good place to fish on great water for the money. Sounds like your upgrade boat was a gem. Congrats on your great trip to Caribou!"

One group fished Outlet Bay, but paid for it by taking out a lower unit from their boat.Sounds like you've fished Caribou before--pretty good lake for a drive to and we catch lots of different year class walleye. Should be a great fishery for years to come."
