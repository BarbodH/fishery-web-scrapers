The roads in were in great shape and everything went smooth. We found our fish in 18 to 30 fow.In terms of volume, this was the best fishing trip I have ever been on. We fished for five days and boated 832 walleyes between two boats and six guys. The fish up there must have plenty of forage because they were very fat, very healthy, and very strong. It literally was like catching fall fish, as many of them spit out smelt or shiners as they came to the boat. We tried a little trolling and a little bit of pulling blades to switch it up, but 95 % of our fishing was jig fishing. We fished both minnows and crawlers, but it really didn't seem to matter. We caught fish in every class up to 27 inch.This was a great trip and I hope to go back again in the near future. You have to literally be there and live it to comprehend how unreal the bite really is. We didn't run into a trophy but a ton of quality fish.832 fish/5 days = 166.4 fish a day166.4 fish/9 hours a day =18.48 fish and hour The highlight of the trip came when Sean hooked his three big fish. Sean has not spent a whole lot of time walleye fishing so this was a new experience for him. He was able to land a 25.5 incher, a 26, and a 27 (with a 36 inch bonus pike). The smile on his face was priceless.Until next time - tight linesAlready planning our trip for next year. We may go back to Lac Seul but I am also considering going else where. Anyone have any suggestions for chasing trophy eyes in Ontario? Really am open to any suggestions..."

It also sounds like you may NOT want to do a fly-in?? I don't know - for us to be able to use my own boat and catch the amount/size of fish - I'm plenty happy with Lac Seul."
1469483,vteye,2012-08-02 07:30:00,812,Wondering if there are any outfitters on Lac Seul that offerEuropean style outpost camps (boat/motor/cabin no meals)group from the East coast with a tight budget. Thanks
1469494,joeman79,2012-08-02 07:47:00,417,They have 2 Outpost camps on Lac Seul.
1469497,wallydave,2012-08-02 07:51:00,2151,"http://www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge/Here is one than offers a boat in out post. I have never been there, but others may have been. Try the search function, google and wait for more replies!"
1471359,Steve Ediger,2012-08-06 15:09:00,97,vteye Lac Seul Lodge has an outpost on Sunlight Lake and Black Bay - both on Lac Seul. I believe the Outpost at Sunlight will handle six and the one at Black Bay will sleep 8. They are both in the heart of Lac Seul's walleye and pike fishing and 20 - 25 miles from the nearest camp. Call Rod and Lorita to see what they have for openings. Tell them Steve sent you.

It is awesome fishing and very modern for an outpost. This year 9 of us fished for 5 days and caught over 2700 Walleyes with a lot of fish in the 22"" to 25"" range , biggest being 29"". Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
