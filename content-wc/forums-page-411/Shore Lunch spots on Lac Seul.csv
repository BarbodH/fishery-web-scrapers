1472690,NWwalleye,2012-08-09 08:58:00,223,"Have a great time !!! I am busy that week , but not on Lac Seul .. I will be out the following week guiding some great people, so save some fish for me ..."
1471471,MorganMan,2012-08-06 19:38:00,341,We are headed to Lac Seul for only our second year and wonder if there are any shore lunch spots that are commonly used in the northwest to central area for shore lunch? We are not looking for sites that have equipment or anything. Some lakes have areas that groups commonly use that are group friendly as far as easy access for many boats and open to get a nice shore lunch depending on wind. Any info on site you have used is appreciated. Can't wait!

I didn't stop but while fishing around the island a noticed a sizeable flat rock area on the nw side. Not very far above the water level maybe 8-12"". Not sure about access up to the rock but it was after 1 oclock and still in the shade. If you check it out please report back."
1471491,Guest,2012-08-06 20:16:00,0,In my 20 years of roaming around I vote for the spot in sawmill bay
1471509,rather-be-fishin,2012-08-06 20:49:00,429,Where are you staying? What areas do you fish? If you head down to Ghost Narrows there is a nice sandy shore on the west side of the narrows that is protected. I can also give you some more sandy beach areas in McKenzie bay area. What's your email address? We just got back from Lac Seul Saturday & had a fantastic time once again! Already counting down the days to next years trip! RBF
1471646,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 08:40:00,1528,"Morgan will be staying at Onaway Lodge. We typically stay on the NW side or the central area. At least last year we did. Furthest we traveled was Sun Light Lake.We had done fly-ins for years and there were always a few spots that were sort of already set up for shore lunch. People had been there and there were already rocks stacked for a fire etc. Plus, they usually had nice areas to park. We actually prefer rock islands vs sandy beaches. We are usuing aluminum boats so we try to let one guy off and then pull the boat up a little and tie it off to a tree or a rock. Sandy beaches just get sand everywhere in the boats. I think the point is our other lakes always had areas where it was obvious other people had used. No trash or anything, but you could tell. We didn't see any of that on Lac Seul. But, with so many people fishing it, I assume there might even be some places set up with a picinic table or something. I have seen other outfitters do that."
1471680,NWwalleye,2012-08-07 09:34:00,223,"The is a decent spot (rock) between West shanty and East shanty narrows, has a rock fire ring. NO table and chairs though ;-p ...............It is jsut past the West shanty on you right if you are heading East .."
1471683,SinOrSwim,2012-08-07 09:39:00,1528,"I should probably clarify, we have never found a site with table and chairs but I have seen websites advertising that sort of service. Sitting on the ground or a rock is perfectly fine."
1471687,NWwalleye,2012-08-07 09:45:00,223,Then you might like this spot ..Have a great time ..... When are you going to be there ?
1471708,KTroller,2012-08-07 10:18:00,237,Radar Island just into Sawmill. Rocky shore and a shore lunch spot up on a small hill on the point nearest the entry to the bay. Nice breezes up on the hill and an easy spot to tie off the boats just off the point.KT
1471975,MorganMan,2012-08-07 18:58:00,341,"Sorry, we are staying at Onaway and this info helps a lot. We will have six boats and it's not always easy finding areas. Was hoping there were spots on a big lake that others use to accomadate us."
