All my life (60yrs.) we were told that two full moons in one month was a blue moon. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it"
1471960,IA JOE,2012-08-07 18:37:00,35,"Use the Old Farmer's Almanac not the Farmer's Almanac. The Moon may have an impact but other factors like temp., wind, the hatch and B. pressure all pay a roll in the bite and bait fish location."
1470896,Gipper,2012-08-05 15:32:00,76,"This year the walleye bite on out favorite hump started and ended almost exactly at the time specified a a moon table I had. It was almost eerie.Also, in the few years since I started looking at these tables, I've planned musky trips to No. WI on weekends, only where we had a moon influence and we've done well.In the 20 years prior, without paying attention to the tables we did well sometimes and got skunked others but I don't have data to see what happened.I'd love to hear opinions as to whether I'm getting carried away or not."
1470913,octanehi5,2012-08-05 16:38:00,1104,"the solunar tables do work, I have used this for yrs. This yr up north we had a full moon the second night there and the fishing got better everyday after that. Next yr we have a new moon or no moon so to speak, the fishing will be at its best that week, the week before we got to the lake ths yr 10 days before the full moon the guys in the camp killed em. A long with weather you can figure out how you will do"
1471006,Obabikon,2012-08-05 19:26:00,2370,The moon means an absolute ton to the muskies. The Walleye bite isn't as important (from what I've found).
1471023,Golden Eagle,2012-08-05 19:49:00,2642,Two full moons this month (August).
1471051,Gipper,2012-08-05 20:28:00,76,"I believe I agree with what you say about musky. Last fall on a full moon we had 10 in a day and a half in WI. This year in Canada we had one with alot of near misses. Another group got 5. The next week's report from our lodge had no musky action in it (no moon week) but last week, a moon week, one group got 5 in one day.Is this a real deal?"
1471060,Gipper,2012-08-05 20:41:00,76,"The reasom I'm asking for input is that our group has decided on 3rd Week in July after trying 4 different weeks. All previous weeks had a moon influence and we've done well. The 3rd week in July 2013 is between moons and we are old, retired, tired, and flexible people who want to catch big muskys as well as waldos."
1471066,Golden Eagle,2012-08-05 21:03:00,2642,My ideal fishing trip is for 3 weeks. Includes a new moon and a full moon. Middle week is for both fishing and exploring. And maybe wash clothes during middle week.
1471105,octanehi5,2012-08-06 05:25:00,1104,"Two full moons in this month, once in a blue moon. Yes you can catch fish anytime. the solunar tables tell you the peak times to catch them on any given day, cold fronts, wind direction , have alot to do with the bite. for walldo. On the lake we fly into, a bad day is catching only 50 walleyes in the boat with two people.on a good day we have caught 150+ walleyes. I am strictly a walleye fisherman. I do catch a few toothy criters. If walldo is biting I will find them"
1471438,3M TA3,2012-08-06 18:33:00,2846,"Just a tidbit from Farmer's Almanac and Wiki Using the Farmers' Almanac definition of blue moon (meaning the third full moon in a season of four full moons), blue moons occur November 21, 2010 August 21, 2013 May 21, 2016 Note that by this definition the months of July, August, and September in 2012 contain four full moons, and August 2012 has two full moons. However, the period from the summer solstice to the autumn equinox in 2012 contains only three full moons, as the September 2012 full moon comes after the equinox. Similarly, the December full moon in 2012 comes after the solstice. Thus calendar 2012 has 13 full moons including two in August, yet it contains no blue moon."
1471562,Obabikon,2012-08-07 04:22:00,2370,"Blue moons are also defined as the 2nd full moon in a month. Not the farmer's almanac definition, but calling the full on the 31st a blue isn't wrong either. Either way... moons are great!"
