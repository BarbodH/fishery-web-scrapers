1469994,Aaron-IN,2012-08-03 07:05:00,500,I wasn't there myself but I have a reliable source that says the crank bite is on in the big lake.
1470065,DeBo,2012-08-03 09:09:00,211,Got back from a 10 day trip on Wednesday. Wish I would have been up there a week later as the muskies finished way better at the end of the trip. Never caught a pike over 30in until the Storms/Front rolled through Wednesday night the 25. Some nicer ones started showing up in the casting depths after that storm and especially early this week after the storm/front on sunday the 29th. I only fish muskies so the bigger pike are a bonus.Water was 75-76 in the main channel at dawn. Fish seemed to be a bit deeper than usual cranks were good and blades run a bit deeper than normal.If you're fishing muskies the main river channel areas were by far the best. No idea about walleyes or smallies. Fishing pressure was light but the cottagers were out in full force. Don't fish cummings island as they will scream jingle bells and make the dogs bark trying to get you to leave. The only dark cloud on an otherwise great trip to the 'peg.
