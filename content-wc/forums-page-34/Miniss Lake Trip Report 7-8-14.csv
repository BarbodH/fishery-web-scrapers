My mom even made it across without having a Passport (Birth certificate & Driver's license). We stayed at the Miniss East camp owned & operated by Slate Falls Outposts. It was our group's 1st time using S.F.O. and 1st time fishing Miniss. Both were outstanding. Ryan at S.F.O. runs a great operation. All facilities and equipment were in great shape except the docks which, like most all others in N.W.O., needed heavy repairs even to function. They were usable but were being repaired to perfect condition as we left camp. The fishing was great. We caught fish at almost every spot. No big ones were hauled in this trip, the biggest pike being just over 31 and the biggest walleye being 24. But we caught high numbers of fish each day and mostly good size walleyes in the 17-21 inch range. Caught our fish mostly from 3-8 feet of water which I had never experienced on a Canadian lake in July. Bright colors (orange, pink, silver ) seemed to work the best. We used all types of bait but plastics did just as well as leeches, worms etc. We mostly used jigs and also had success trolling BB spinners. Weather was great with only one day of rain and that didn't affect the fishing. Bugs were as bad as we have ever experienced in Canada but the Thermacells worked well. Twice we saw a moose crossing the bay in front of the cabin but too far for any pictures. Had a bear come through camp while we were out fishing and took a taste of my cooler (teeth marks) but didn't do any other damage. It was a great trip and we are planning on doing it again next year!!A shout out to all the people who recommended the Canada Topo app. on a cell phone. It worked flawlessly and is an easy and great way to navigate on a lake. As a backup I used my Garmin GPS64."
6674472,IaDave14,2022-07-22 05:57:00,99,Thanks for the report one of my favorite trips was to Miniss in 2018. Would love to get back for a second trip.
6674638,Bstar,2022-07-22 14:53:00,564,Glad you had a good trip. Looking forward to our trip to Miniss in two weeks. The Topo Canada app is the bomb for navigating the bigger lakes. I'm surprised the fish were that shallow.
6674692,gordy28,2022-07-22 20:17:00,437,Sounds like a great trip. Interesting the fish were that shallow. We will be there in a few weeks as well. Canâ€™t wait
