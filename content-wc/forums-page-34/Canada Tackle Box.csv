If you have that kind of rain gear, then you’ll probably need a larger bag if you want to put other stuff in it. I believe the next size up that Bass Pro sells is a 55L, which is huge."
6676188,Mojo-NC,2022-07-29 12:31:00,1929,"I agree. I use a 40L duffle style bag and it holds plenty of stuff. It has plenty of room for a fairly large tackle box and rain gear. In case this is more helpful, a 40L bag is slightly over 10.5 gallons and a 30L bag is just under 8 gallons (7.9)."

6676422,Camoclad,2022-07-30 20:41:00,628,"This is what I use: https://www.academy.com/p/h2o-xpress-utility-tackle-bagI add an extra tackle tray so that there are three trays, one for jigs and terminal tackle, one for cranks, one for spoons. I also put a multi tool, a small pair of pliers, and a pair of side cutters in there. Lots of pockets for plastics, spinnerbaits, etc. It definitely isn't the best of the best but has worked really well for me. I have made 4 trips with this particular bag. For the commercial flights, I have been putting the jig tray in my carry-on since it is the heaviest and that has helped what I can pack in my checked bag. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/202...6c07f80c7d.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6676436,Mike311,2022-07-31 03:11:00,40,You listed about everything you need in your original post but many great suggestions have followed. I paired down years ago. Anymore my Canada tackle kit includes three 8”x5”ish Plano boxes in a small canvas bag. We quit using any live bait 15-18 years ago. Couple these two things together and I’ve dramatically reduced cost’s and the work involved.

6675998,stjoeguy,2022-07-28 14:58:00,979,"Your post got me to drag out my Canada bag and go through it all again. I managed to shave off a pound, but it's still too much. It's still just over 10#, so I'll look at leaving more jigs and a daredevil or two behind. I've got a bag similar to this one. Mine holds 2 3600 full size boxes and 2 3600 slim boxes in the main section. The front pocket of mine holds all my tools etc in a box similar to a 3600 but only 5.5"" tall. I'm not sure what this bag holds in front. It looks the same but doesn't specify.https://www.scheels.com/p/plano-week...start=84&sz=23"
6676004,Mojo-NC,2022-07-28 15:12:00,1929,"Thanks for those specific recommendations. I especially like the A-Series bags, mostly because of the quick top option for easy access to a few jigs and a spinner or a crank or two. The quick top would also be especially convenient on those rainy days that are all too common in Canada. The rest of my tackle could be placed in the various 3600 boxes. As long as the entire tackle box fits in my waterproof boat bag, it looks like it would be a great option. Now if they would just go on sale between now and next year's trip..."
6676008,SweetD,2022-07-28 15:19:00,243,"Anything with a zipper I would throw away. Every soft sided bag that has zippers has 100% failed me at some point. Finally moved to a couple of reallly good boxes with tight seals that I put in a wet/dry bag. It has served me well for at least 5 consecutive seasons now and ZERO zippers to stick, break or just generally be a PIA to open.Good Luck"
6676014,SweetD,2022-07-28 15:28:00,243,"Two of the tackle boxes fit comfortably and securely into the wet/dry bag. Validate size of box and bag size to be sure but packs well, waterproof (I leave tackle boxes out 95% of time while at outpost through rain etc.) and keep rainsuit in wet/dry bag AND no zippers!!!!"
6676072,Old Timer,2022-07-28 21:22:00,255,You don't need much. I made a bunch of trips to fly-in outposts with nothing more than one of those little Plano type boxes with the waterproof snaps.
6676136,Mojo-NC,2022-07-29 08:02:00,1929,"Those tackle boxes are a good idea. Regarding bags with zippers, I've had the same problem, but usually when taking zipper bags to the coast where they are exposed to saltwater and salty air. Now I treat the zippers on all of my bags with a bit of silicone grease without any problems. I got that idea from the RTIC zipper coolers. It works great. I also switched to a waterproof duffle style bag instead of the tube type waterproof bags. It always seemed like whatever I needed was always in the bottom of the tube style bag and I had to pull everything out to get to what I needed. Here's an example of a duffle with easier access:https://www.amazon.com/Gonex-Waterpr...8-4&th=1&psc=1"
6676146,SweetD,2022-07-29 08:14:00,243,"Mojo - love that bag vs the vertical version i have for the reasons you mentioned. So it folds over to seal horizontally vs vertically, right? No zippers although I do like your idea of the lubricant to help with that. My bag did get a very small cut somewhere along the way so may be time to upgrade to this bag. Thanks for sharing."
6676152,Mojo-NC,2022-07-29 08:38:00,1929,"Yes the duffle types of bags seal vertically to allow easier access to the contents. I used to bring my binoculars, a 35mm camera, a zoom lens, a rain suit (if I wasn't already wearing it), and all of my tackle with me in a waterproof bag. The tube bags became too much of a PITA, so I switched. I'm not recommending the specific bag from the link I provided, it's just an example of the style of bag I like. I've given thought to all of the recommendations that have been mentioned so far and will come up with something that will work better than what I've got now. I've been packing all of my tackle into a Coleman Steel-Belted cooler, along with my portable fishfinder, battery, charger, filet knife, fishing tools, filet glove, etc. I then strap it closed and check the cooler as one piece of luggage, so I have to keep the total weight under 50#. Once I arrive, I take everything out and use the cooler as a cooler for the week we're there. It's been difficult to keep it under 50# with all of the unnecessary tackle I've been bringing with me. My pared down list of tackle with a new bag or a few 3600 boxes should be just the ticket."
6676176,Walleye2242,2022-07-29 10:23:00,263,"Is the 30L bag big enough to keep rain gear, another jacket or sweatshirt, small 1st aid kit, maybe some snacks? Thank you."

6675914,Mojo-NC,2022-07-28 10:02:00,1929,"I am looking for some suggestions/recommendations for a relatively small but efficient Canada-specific tackle box for next year. We have to fly to either INL or Winnipeg for every trip, so my tackle size/weight limit is a concern for us flying, but is not really applicable to those of you who are able to drive to Canada. I'm planning to seriously pare down the tackle that I bring up to Canada next year. Once again this year I brought so much tackle and only used maybe <5% of what I brought. It just doesn't make sense to bring 150 or more jigs when I only use maybe a dozen at most, and that includes bite-offs and break-offs. The same goes for my crankbaits and spinnerbaits (not spinner rigs). I know I brought over 100 crankbaits with me and only used about 5 or so. This year I also brought about 75 spinner rigs and I think I maybe used 5 of them (the same ones I use every year). I only used 1 of all of the inline spinners that I brought up with me. So far the baits I have chosen have worked so well that I have not had the need to switch them out very often, that is unless I was trying to mix things up just for fun. The bottom line is that the fish in Canada are typically neither picky nor very difficult to catch. I think I could get by with a few SR09 Deep Diving Shad Raps, a few various Doctor and Dardevle spoons, some Flicker Shads, and a few Hot 'N Tots for trolling. Casting hasn't really been much of an option for us to date because we typically have had to use basic camp boats. Do you have any good suggestions for me to consider? Thanks in advance."

6675930,mctbone,2022-07-28 10:47:00,26,"Sorry, this isn't going to hep you but I'm laughing at your post because I have a similar problem every year and I'm currently going through it right now as we leave in a few days. Unlike you, we drive up but we do fly-ins and we never ever make weight (not even close). So every year I (unsuccessfully) try to cut back on tackle. Typically I lose less than a dozen jigs, but what size will I need this year? 1/8, 1/4, 3/8? Maybe a few even bigger (we go in mid-August)? And what will be the hot color this year? Then a variety of bottom bouncers, several each from 1-3 oz. Might want to do some Lindy rigging so need a variety of boot walker sinkers for that. This year we have lake trout available so I'll need some heavier trolling weights to get baits down deep for that. And crank baits? I will only use a couple since we don't do much trolling, but what depth, color and action will be working this year? So at least 50 of those (they don't weigh much and they're just too **** good looking not to bring). And then there's the heavy metal for pike. Got to have a good variety of those. So I always have way more than I will ever use. Good to have options, although if I had fewer it would take me less time to pick which one to use while sitting in the boat drifting half way across the lake indecisively. Then there's stuff kept in a separate boat bag: plastics (don't get me started), marker buoys, flashlight, bolt cutter, spinner harnesses, spare batteries for depth finder, etc. How do I cut back on fishing gear? That's the whole reason I'm going up there. Maybe I'll just wear the same clothes every day."

6675954,adempsey2.0,2022-07-28 12:06:00,611,I see no reason to use anything but Plano trays and a holder. Just pick your desired size trays and soft sided bag. I like the Plano Guide series bags myself.https://planomolding.com/collections/guide-series The Plano A-Series looks good too.https://planomolding.com/collections/a-series The 3600 series are probably the ones you would be looking at.
6675958,Crede,2022-07-28 12:47:00,134,"I agree with using a 3600 size Plano tackle bag and boxes. We fish walleye 90% of the time and pike 10%. Rarely brook trout. Personally, whether I am flying commercially to Canada or driving to a fly in I take my tackle in a Plano Weekend Series 3600 Tackle Bag. In it I have: 1 3600 size Plano box which contains all of my crank baits, spoons, and spinners. 1 3450 Plano bog which contains my jigs plus clippers, sharpening stone, and eye buster. 1 gallon Zip Lock which contains my bags of plastic tails. 1 Lindy fish handling glove. Pliers, Leatherman, compass, 3 rope stringers, 8 titanium leaders, 2 oz sunscreen tube, 1 extra headnet, small flashlight, extra set of flashlight and GPS batteries, extra pair of cheap reading glasses, and 1 lighter (purchased in Canada) go in the pockets. All together weighs around 9 lbs."
6675966,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-28 13:27:00,240,"Hi--I had mentioned this to someone else today--Cabela's has a real nice little box/kit of walleye plastics for $24.99. You could easily fit a few dozen jigs in there as well. 150 plastics in the kit would more than suffice for probably a few seasons. Jointed Rapalas in the 3 1/2 inch size (black and silver, black and gold, red and gold) have become my go-to bait when trolling for walleye. I have a few Husky Jerk (Rapalas), too. Pike? Doctor Spoons. But, my biggest 4-5 pike I have ever caught were on walleye jigs. These fish were all over 40"", which I know does not impress the guys who really target the bigger pike. I just really never choose to target pike when I am in an outpost setting with lots of walleye to be had. I saw on Mike Borger's facebook page that he just received a shipment of probably 3 dozen Doctor Spoons. Myself, 2-3 spoons suffice. But, again, Mike prefers big pike to anything else he chases. What is much more important are the rods and reels you choose. I bring two Abu Garcia Revo spinning reels + 2 Daiwa SS 700 reels for walleye, paired with a few St. Croix Eyecon rods and a Cabela's XML (the ones they made 10 years ago). For pike, I bring a Revo MGX casting reel and an old-school Cabela's XML medium-heavy rod. I have been putting more money into replacing my duffel this past year. I love the KUIU guide pants, their long-sleeve shirts, and their base layers. Huge upgrades over what I did have. Had a knee replacement this past winter, so I also ponied up to get a pair of Kenetrek hikers. Expensive, yeah, but they are the absolute best boots made. Stuff like this is half the fun of actually going. Enjoy!"
6675992,SweetD,2022-07-28 14:37:00,243,Leave 5lbs of potatoes and the 3rd gallon of oil that you will never use at home. Inevitably we all take waaaay more stuff than is necessary but I say no way to reducing your fishing tackle box!!!! That’s the primary reason we go North……to fish. I would cut corners elsewhere but that’s just me!!!!
