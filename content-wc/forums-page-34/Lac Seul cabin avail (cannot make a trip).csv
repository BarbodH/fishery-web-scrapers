6675820,pjshorthorn,2022-07-28 02:51:00,5654,Interesting to hear. Anderson's has/had an outpost cabin in Tuk Bay. Wondering if they sold that to PAC. Learn something new all the time. PjShorthorn
6675822,pjshorthorn,2022-07-28 03:10:00,5654,PAC has an outpost on Wapesi River. You canâ€™t get to this outpost from Wapesi Lake or Wapesi Bay as there are rapids at both ends of the river connecting both bodies of water. Sounds like an interesting place to try.PjShorthorn
6675824,Eckohlt,2022-07-28 03:27:00,3685,That's right!
6675866,danvan18$,2022-07-28 07:59:00,67,Yes PAC has had that location in Tuk Bay for nearly 30 years since I have been using them for that long. Have not fished at this outpost but would like to try some time. A friend of mine went there pre-covid and another party I know goes there 2x per year and say the fishing is great- well it's Canada and Lac Seul right? I have fished both the Wapesi Lake and Wapesi River locations with them as well. Fishing was great in the lake but not so much at the river location- but we went in the fall and the water levels were super low and you have a limited amount of water to fish.
6675280,p0007,2022-07-25 21:04:00,78,"We have a cabin reserved Aug 3-8 in NE Lac Seul and cannot make the trip, if someone is looking for a great last-minute destination for walleye and/or muskie, let me know and I'll get you details. Obviously not looking for anything for this and just want someone to be able to use it. Message me if interested."
6675316,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-26 04:57:00,8293,This a resort cabin or private party?
6675386,p0007,2022-07-26 09:40:00,78,"It is an outpost cabin (boat in) owned by a resort. It is a 4 bedroom and sleeps up to 8 people comfortably. Solar power, gas water heater, gas fridge/freezers, etc..."
6675592,jimirjr,2022-07-26 20:15:00,1149,Can You be a bit more specific as to the name of the resort ?
6675622,Pooch,2022-07-27 04:25:00,4618,"Sounds a lot like Lac Seul Lodge's outpost. If it is, that is a great location, but a long boat ride from base camp. Just speculating. Pooch"
6675628,pjshorthorn,2022-07-27 05:12:00,5654,"Unless a new outfitter opened up in the last 8 years, the only two in the NE section of Lac Seul are Anderson's and Lac Seul Outposts. PjShorthorn"
6675664,p0007,2022-07-27 08:38:00,78,"Actually neither, it is an outpost cabin owned by PAC in Tuk bay, so not quite as long of a boat ride as the other two. It's a big beautiful newer cabin on a sand beach."
6675726,Eckohlt,2022-07-27 13:18:00,3685,"Pickeral arm camps has a outpost in wapesi bay,I believe that's n.e section."
6675732,walleyecheek,2022-07-27 13:51:00,2231,"Yep, Thats what PAC would stand for !"
6675774,Eckohlt,2022-07-27 18:21:00,3685,"I thought PAC was pound another coldone,I Learn something new everyday."
