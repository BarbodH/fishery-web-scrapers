The high water along the Rainy River and LOTW was still very evident and my best wishes go out the the businesses effected by it.The water level was up from last year which made running the channel into Kirkness Lake easy. The water temp and weed growth were about 2-3 weeks behind normal. In many area's weeds were up only 2-4 feet. It took a day or two for us to realize that that was going to be a critical point when looking for walleyes. Our usual style of fishing is jigging mid-lake structure which can be unbelievably productive. This year we only had a short window on a hot clear afternoon when a reef bite took off and we caught fish 19""-24"" as fast as we could get a jig and frozen minnow down. Plastics did virtually nothing fished vertically. I had years worth of way points on my GPS for. reefs and drop-offs that produced very few fish during the week. On our ""milk run"" we passed a bay that always produces pike and a few smallmouth, and we needed to get a few bites to get some confidence back. My go to bait for weed fishing is a natural colored tube jig with a spinner blade attached. It looks like an over grown Beetle Spin if you can picture that. The first couple walleyes seemed random, but as we worked shallower it turned into a frenzy. And that became the pattern for the week. Three to eight feet of water with weeds and boulders/sand held what seemed to be every fish in the lake. If the wind was blowing into the area the fish were biting. On the windiest afternoons the walleyes got extremely aggressive. I started throwing a Ripping Rap that was intended for deep jigging( based on a Al Linder video). The bait had to be cranked in at high speed to keep from getting snagged but the fish were smashing it. We could watch the walleyes come up out of the weeds next to the boat to hit the bait. I even had a fish hit while I was jokingly doing a figure eight. Plastics on jigs did work very good, but I really enjoyed the super aggressive hit we had tossing other baits. The lesson we walked away with was that we couldn't fish the style we wanted to use, which in our case was jigging. We had to find the fish and adapt to a method that would get a bait to them. I think people who stuck with trolling harnesses or other deep water systems had a few more challenges to come in contact with large numbers of fish. The lodge is very nice and the boats are 17.5 Lunds with a few G-3s. All with pedestal seats and dry storage. Booked for next year."
