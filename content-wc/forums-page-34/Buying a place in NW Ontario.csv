6675220,SweetD,2022-07-25 18:20:00,243,Save your $ and enjoy your time hitting all the beautiful lake you can while you still can! Fishing the same lake all the time would be super boring IMO but that’s just me!!!!!
6675222,Cgillespie,2022-07-25 18:25:00,120,My plan is to get a place that has several lakes nearby so I can mix it up. I'm not going to be tied down on one lake. Plus there are large lakes like Eagle and Lac Seul that would take years to figure out.

6676086,kettyspanky,2022-07-29 04:18:00,271,"I'd say if you have the time and money, go for it. I looked at a camper at the resort we go to. I'm not quite ready to buy now but a couple years I will be."
6674656,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-22 16:00:00,151,"This has been a really interesting thread. Just one final thing I'd like to mention if you look for a place in Ear Falls. Frost heaving/frost jacking is the bane of unheated dwellings in NW Ontario. Full basements are problematical unless the house is kept heated enough that frost doesn't heave the walls. The resort owner of the cottages we stay at in Ear Falls has told me that frost heave can lift his ""post-and-pad"" foundation cabins anything like 4-6""! When it comes to land, you often have to take what you can get. But if there's a choice, I'd go for ones with frost-heave-resistant soils (gravel, sand) over frost prone (clayey)."
6674664,walleyecheek,2022-07-22 16:33:00,2231,How about Slabs ?
6674706,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-22 21:26:00,151,"I might be wrong, but I have the impression concrete is really expensive in Ear Falls, but if not, a floating slab might be the way to go. I've heard some people report decent results with concrete filled sonotubes. I know from experience crawling under the family deer camp to jack up and relevel sagging floors isn't a lot of fun (it's in a rattlesnake area)."
6674720,Skywagon,2022-07-23 06:04:00,1106,"Concrete is terribly expensive, transportation costs are the killer, I can't even imagine cost of that much concrete in Ear Falls. My gut feeling on a slab is though it may float, think about what would happen to the septic and water pipes that don't. I have had poor luck with sona tubes on my hangar, 6' in the ground and they still heave, the whole building is slowly coming out of the ground, have seen even worse results elsewhere. If on clay, the best results I have had is to have the least amount of points on the ground, less to get out of kilter. Build heavy enough floor beams that the only cabin supports are on the outside where you can get at them (less points). Pour concrete under where each support will go and make it wide enough to support a jack. There is nothing easy about any of this, you have to have the cash and the will to do it."
6674722,RichA$1970,2022-07-23 06:37:00,1159,"I’d reconsider and just estimate $200k as your budget to buy without maintenance, furnishing and taxes in a fixed location. 2 options for a ROI would be buy a camper and have a friend haul up your boat or rent one from the campground/ resort or just find several camps for a monthly cabin rental and haul your boat up there. No equity but no taxes, contractors, maintenance, break ins and other risks such as locking down the border for 2 years."
6674736,walleyecheek,2022-07-23 07:21:00,2231,Isn't it funny how easy projects get with the more money a person has.....hence MEGA MILLIONS !
6674760,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-23 09:49:00,151,"Spot on! Over the last 20 years, I've looked at many cottages/houses from Pakwash Lake down to Vermilion Bay. A majority had substantial structural issues because people try to build them on the cheap, which I fully understand. Full span joists are expensive, and the temptation is to use short joists that rest on internal beams on post-and-pads. While this might be fairly easy to build level, it seems to be a bugger to keep level. I have come to the same conclusion as Skywagon - keep the points of contact to a minimum - use heavy enough joists to achieve full span so at least you can jack the thing up without having to crawl under it. I heard a story about a guy in Ear Falls who accidently dropped a cabin while jacking - I think on his thumb! Ouch!"
6674830,Cgillespie,2022-07-23 18:36:00,120,Sounds like a lot of planning will have to go into this. Glad I've got plenty of time to think about it! The weeks of 100+ temps here are about more than I can handle.
6675146,ziemann,2022-07-25 10:48:00,641,"A FEW THOUGHTS TO KEEP IN MIND: We're WI residents who recently sold a our Canadian Cabin that had been in the family since the 1950's (Atikokan, NW ON). If you're thinking that CA property is a decent short term investment, keep this in mind: 1. When you sell, you pay your realtor. 2. Canada will tax your income from the home sale. 3. You then need to get those $$ home- The current exchange rate is $0.77. 3. The income will then be taxed in the US. Ultimately, I feel that we didn't end up with NEARLY what we should have from the sale of the property. But sometimes, when you need money, your choices are limited....."
6675148,Cgillespie,2022-07-25 10:55:00,120,"I'm not planning on this being a short-term investment. We don't have any kids to think about, only us. This is for us and a few friends that we invite up. Our enjoyment of the property is all that matters to us."
6674158,Cgillespie,2022-07-20 19:03:00,120,That's a good website. Thanks!
6674182,alanexpup,2022-07-20 22:16:00,278,Who has not thought of this. I always thought the easiest would be to find a resort in need. Offer to buy a cabin for your sole use and when you did not use it the resort could rent it out like normal. This way the resort owner gets help and you get a break.
6674202,Skywagon,2022-07-21 05:01:00,1106,"In this part of Ontario it is very difficult to split/sever property. A good thing, as that combined with the fact that most of the land around the lakes is owned by the Crown (Government) keeps cabin numbers down, otherwise the lakes would be littered with cabins like they are south of the border."
6674232,LOWrider,2022-07-21 07:15:00,40,"The main reason we went ahead and purchased in NW Ontario was mostly about friends and family. We came to the realization that holidays, weddings and funerals were becoming our way of staying connected to people. So, we purchased and have become the vacation spot for those that mean the most to us. Our summer is a busy schedule of visitors, those that we see regularly and those that we only see once a year up here. My advice (amongst the other good advice in this thread) is to consider more than proximity to fishing as to why you might or might not buy a place in Ontario, or any lake home for that matter. There are far easier and cheaper ways to satisfy a fishing habit. On the point of how much time you spend maintaining vs. enjoying a lake property, my experience is that I've actually started to enjoy projects making improvements with the goal of making visitors even more comfortable on their stays. I may be in the minority here on that point. We definitely spend more time maintaining than we thought we would, but I could see that changing as our project list is shrinking. Good luck & good fishing!"
6674246,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-21 08:31:00,151,"Excellent point, and ""littered"" is the right word. I think this is why many of us visit the area. To get around the subdivision difficulties, I've heard of resort owners who will sell a cabin to you, and then lease you the land on which it sits. This is fine as long as one is comfortable that the lease will be renewed for as long as one wants."
6674292,Obabikon,2022-07-21 12:17:00,2370,"Yeah, without being a part owner in the ""business"" you are putting your faith in a lease being upheld for long periods of time. Another thing about splitting up land, especially if you're an island... different properties are not allowed to share a septic system. So, if I tried to subdivide our island, each division would have to have it's own system."
6674300,Cgillespie,2022-07-21 12:48:00,120,"The more I read, the more I think a little lot with a small A-Frame in Ear Falls seems like the best idea. They already have electricity, city water, and I believe sewage already run to the lot. I'm just looking for somewhere that's close to good fishing. Property taxes are high in town, but being in town has some advantages. I could always pay somebody to keep an eye on the place and install cameras to keep an eye on things from down here. Plus, if I wanted to experience Canadian winter, I could go up over Christmas and our spring break (March) as well."
6674416,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-21 20:54:00,151,"All good points. I think many of their lots have natural gas as well, which is a major plus. For us older folks, having a health care clinic in town is a consideration, too. If you go up over Xmas, have someone warm the place up before you arrive;-)"

6674578,Cgillespie,2022-07-22 11:18:00,120,Ear Falls is close to a lot of good fishing. I'd make a move today if I could! Gotta save some money over the next couple of years.

Id guess its ~$650k today."
6673228,Skywagon,2022-07-17 06:43:00,1106,Just the price of having fun! The cost of getting material in and labor costs is more than significant on a project like that if you don't do it yourself. The cost of Starlink internet for a year alone is as much as a lot of US fisherman pay for their yearly trip.
6673248,Baseline,2022-07-17 08:57:00,3207,"In my younger years (1980's) my fishing buddy and I hashed out the pros and cons of buying a cabin or piece of property. Pros were - having a place to call our own; that was it. Cons were - purchase and ongoing cost - number of days we could or would actually use it - problems with joint ownership - work required for upkeep - limit alternative trips to fish other areas - how to pass the property on or sell because nothing lasts forever. We finally decided that joint ownership wasn't a good idea. What we were already doing suited the type of Canadian trips we were doing. We both had pickup campers and traveling all over northwestern Ontario. We were also taking separate trips with other groups. We could use cabins at resorts when desired which provided lots of flexibility for travel. We would be more likely to take trips to other locations like Alaska, South America, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, Gods Lake, etc. all of which we eventually did. I often think that if I would have invested in the cabin we found on Rainy Lake or the Manitou I would have missed out on many of the fishing and travel experiences I went on because I would have been traveling to the cabin to take advantage of what it provided and my extra cash $$ would have gone into maintenance and other costs of ownership. I made the best decision for me and everyone has to make their best decision for themselves. I thought I would comment some of the factors I considered when looking into ownership."

It might sound expensive at first and yes there is no equity, but also think of no maintenance, no break ins, no taxes, no contractors, try new lakes and there’s help near you.

Is it even possible to get electrical power to the rural location you might be considering? if so the cost of running the power lines there is on you, any solar system that does much more than run a few lights is costly. In the end owning a cabin on the lake is great if you can afford it, but if not on the lake would you really be happy having to trailer your boat every single time you want to go fishing? Just some things to consider."

The lodge I stay at on Lac Seul (Fisherman's Cove) does this. They have about 6 or 8 seasonal spots they rent out to the same people year after year. Most of the renters have 5th-wheels, but the newest one has more of a actual cabin. It looks like it may have been built from a kit and sits atop large timbers and isn't actually grounded. I think Goose Bay rents out seasonal spots too, but not sure. There must be others in that area. BTW, if you do this, I'm in need of a new best friend. I'm getting tired of that other guy."

6672438,Cgillespie,2022-07-13 15:55:00,120,I’d buy the materials locally and hire a local builder to do the job.
6672442,djk50164,2022-07-13 16:15:00,370,The moratorium is not for recreational land so yes you can buy now. Have a cabin in the sunset region and I am a contractor locally in the state of WI. I am not sure what cost are were you are but anytime I need something done in Canada from a contractor is about double of what it would cost here. I'm guessing land that is only 25k in canada is not on a lake or is very difficult to access.

As others have said, new construction can be expensive. Buying a small place say in Vermilion Bay or Red Lake Road might be a cost effective option that still puts you in striking distance of pretty decent fishing,"
