6676160,Mojo-NC,2022-07-29 08:46:00,1929,"I've recommended these before, they are just the ticket for Canada. They weigh almost nothing and make awesome hash browns. Just add some hot water, let sit for 10 minutes, and cook with a little oil in a pan. I add some butter and seasoning (and maybe some onions and/or cheese) once they are cooking.https://www.amazon.com/Idaho-Spuds-P...9105655&sr=8-3"

6676036,walleyecheek,2022-07-28 17:12:00,2231,we kind of prefer the Canadian rye bread with the Malkins jam in the morning
6676040,Eckohlt,2022-07-28 17:42:00,3685,"I'll fry up some eye then cook some walleye a different way n have that for my side,that's what you call a side by side eye fry."
6676044,PelicanPoint28.5!,2022-07-28 18:20:00,9,Are there any of these things that cannot be taken across the border into Canada? Thanks
6676046,Eckohlt,2022-07-28 18:38:00,3685,"I'll tell you one thing,don't even think about trying to take a worm across the divided line between usa n Canada!!!"
6676048,drew59,2022-07-28 18:46:00,87,Am I the only one that thinks Kraft Mac n Cheese (aka Kraft Dinner) is great in Canada? Nice break from potatoes and onions. And the definition of easy.
6676050,Pooch,2022-07-28 19:24:00,4618,"Buddy of mine says that ""store bought"" Mac & Cheese is one molecule removed from recycled plastic. He may be right, but I still like it with fish and green beans. Pooch"
6676070,BigBadBucky2,2022-07-28 20:57:00,4,We always make an ice cream bucket of macaroni salad before any fishing trip.
6676076,Old Timer,2022-07-28 22:12:00,255,Great topic and a bunch of interesting menu items. One thing I like after a fried fish and potato meal is a small dish of canned mandarin oranges or grapefruit. The citrus seems to cut the grease pretty well. And a crisp oatmeal/raisin cookie compliments the deal. Doesn't take much effort to fix this.
6676106,Timmer92,2022-07-29 06:28:00,451,"Maybe you are looking for homemade stuff so my suggestions may not be great. Back in the day I did some fly-in fishing and weight was always a concern, so we went with a lot of light packaged dry food. Dried hashbrowns are super light and easy to make. Just add water and let them sit for a while, then cook. https://www.amazon.com/Idaho-Spuds-P...14159190&psc=1Same thing with all things prepacked flavored ""rice"" which generally contain little to no rice these days and is pasta pretending to be rice."
6676110,bfish,2022-07-29 06:37:00,1096,"Quick/refrigerator pickles goes great with fried fish but also good with a sandwich. I mix the vinegar/spices/salt/sugar beforehand then add water when I get there. Bag of apples, if they don't get eaten by mid-week then fry them upBag of oranges/grapefruit. Nice for snack but also good for breakfast (typically oatmeal or bagels for us).Can of 3 bean salad"
6675886,Walleye2242,2022-07-28 09:08:00,263,there are only 2 of us that go. We eat alot of fish. Pot of chili. Steaks for a night. We are very easy on food. Looking for some easy and quick side dish ideas. Also....we are staying in fort francis at the Bayview.....diinner and next morning breakfast suggestions are welcome. Leaving Aug. 12th for Gullrock.
6675900,Camoclad,2022-07-28 09:27:00,628,"We usually do coleslaw for a side (2 bags of shredded cabbage, 1 bottle of cole slaw dressing). We mix up a bag at a time and half bottle of the dressing and store in the fridge. Boiled sweet corn (fresh or frozen) is almost always a side for our trips. Also do a foil packet with potatoes, carrots, and onions (4 taters, 4 carrots, 1 onion) Cut up in chunks, add about 1/2 stick of butter cut up and scattered throuhgout, seal up the foil and put it on the grill or in the oven on 350 for about an hour or so. Very easy to do, we serve it right out of the foil pack so the clean up is really easy. Another side we do is bagged salad and ranch dressing. It is a little more cumbersome but nice to have some ruffage through the week. We also typically take a few cans of peas, green beans, etc that we can open and heat up. I am not a huge fan of pork-n-beans but several of the guys on our trips like them so we do have those occasionally too. While not a side, we also like to make easy dump cobblers for something sweet. A stick of butter melted in the bottom of a cake pan, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup self rise flour, 1 cup milk, and 1 can pie filling. Mix the flour sugar and milk, pour on the melted butter, add the canned pie filling on top, bake 350 for about 50 minutes or until browned around the edges. Good for breakfast with left overs too! We also take some chips and dip that can be added as a side for sandwiches or those days when you just don't feel like cooking. Hope you have a great trip!"
6675916,MN_Moose,2022-07-28 10:12:00,964,"Old World Polish Salad. Darn near as good as Canadian coleslaw. Not quite. But very good. Available at Menardshttps://hw.menardc.com/main/items/me...ge/5749343.jpg we also like to make easy dump cobblers easier than that. Boy Scout Method. butter up the pan. Dump in the pie filling (Cherry, peach, apple) and pour on top one box of white cake mix. super easy! great in a dutch oven"
6675920,Twodogs,2022-07-28 10:18:00,115,"For breakfast you can't go wrong with Harbourage Restaurant... it's within walking distance of Bayview..Downtown Ft.Frances try Flint House for dinner, we were there in June and all four of us had a fabulous meal... little pricey but worth it."
6675922,Bstar,2022-07-28 10:30:00,564,Try the Rendezvous hotel for breakfast. The blueberry pancakes are awesome. You only need one.

6675962,valley366,2022-07-28 13:25:00,193,"We make up cheesy hashbrowns before the trip. In fact just did them this past weekend for our aug trip. Bag of southern hashbrowns, can of Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken, 1 large onion diced 1/4 cup sour cream and a bag of shredded cheddar. Mix all together and bake at 350 for about 45min to hour. Let it cool and transfer to disposable foil pans. The small 2x3 pan serves about two. We vacuum seal and freeze. Defrost the day before and throw in oven for about 30 minutes.If looking for veggies they have the small steam fresh and mixed vegtables that can just throw in microwave.We also stop in Dryden at the Safeway and get a loaf of fresh french bread. They also have it fully seasoned up with butter in a foil bag. Throw it in oven for a bit and ready to go.For a quick breakfast biscuits and gravy is good. About the time to fry the sausage it takes to bake canned biscuits. Very easy. https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21...-and-biscuits/Good luck"
6676002,kettyspanky,2022-07-28 15:09:00,271,We make bisquits and gravy ahead of time. Also do bbq. Make it ahead of time and freeze it and take it along. Happy fishing
6676034,Fishquest,2022-07-28 17:05:00,89,"We don't have many easy sides but a few they seem to like are the flavoured noodle side dish packages, stove top stuffing and some nights pre cut up fresh veggies with ranch dip. Our favorite side with dinner this year was potatoes small cubed in tinfoil with garlic, onion, butter, chopped jalapeno pepper and seasoning. We would make a small package for each guy throw them on the bbq so we didn't heat up the camp and in about 35 mins they were good to go which gave us time to prep the fish for a fry."
