6675348,JDP,2022-07-26 07:34:00,1457,X2 I spoke with a Kwik Trip representative a couple years ago. This is exactly what he told me. Maybe someday though....
6673532,bigwalleye1,2022-07-18 09:32:00,2632,"I use the small Shell station a bit south of the holiday. Small operator, used to be a BP. Easy in and out, and the street side of the diesel pump tips away from the pump a bit. Get a really full fill for heading north."
6673550,N_of_Quibell,2022-07-18 10:11:00,151,"The same thing happened to me this spring at Bobby's in VB. Really busy, I wait patiently in truck with trailer while guy in front gases up, and then disappears into the store for 20 minutes for who knows what. I've given up on the IF Holiday - I gas up at the Cenex at the top of the hill before 53 hits downtown. Lots of space, easy to navigate with trailer. I think to their credit the IF Holiday does have free air if that is ever an issue."
6673556,Knutson21,2022-07-18 10:30:00,348,"I agree that people that tie up a pump for extended period of time other than pumping gas gets annoying, especially when pulling a boat and there are limited pumps you can even use at a specific station. As for the New Holiday, I have only been at it at 4AM and obviously haven't experienced the situation that you have encountered. Normally we use the Cenex at 6th Ave and 3rd Street across from Smokey Bear Park. It use to be a BP when we started using it, but it is a small place 3 blocks off the main run so traffic is light, not much of the border traffic. I also like the fact that I can pull in and fill the truck and boat at the same time. Also friendly staff and clean bathroom."
6673568,Hewhocookstomuch,2022-07-18 11:40:00,66,I think must of these customers are returning from Canada. Like us it their first stop since Dryden with near empty gas tanks and full bladders. Yes bad manners not to have one person in party pull away form the pump so others can fill-up and drain. Our last trip saw we could not get in line so went down a couple blocks to the Shell. In and out easy peasy.
6673606,Carnhzkr,2022-07-18 14:35:00,964,"Once I discovered the 332 route around IF, that's the only way I'll go unless I need to grab a bite at the Moose. No stop lights on this route and for fuel, you'll go right by the large truck stop off 332 a of course the Duty Free station."
6673676,bbheli,2022-07-18 19:51:00,1387,Good one less person i'll have to wait for to use the latrine!
6673718,Pooch,2022-07-19 05:27:00,4618,So.... you're the guy tying up the latrine making everyone lined up wait!? Pooch
6674992,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-24 15:14:00,240,"A good option. I didn't realize there was a new Holiday in town until this year. I was there on Friday, June 17, and it was packed, but I didn't notice any logjams. Of course, I was only driving a truck, not towing a boat. Why is there not a Kwik Trip in town? Or did I miss it. They are building two new ones in our little neck of the woods here in Bessemer and Ironwood."
6675002,walleyecheek,2022-07-24 15:43:00,2231,Kwik trip & Kwik shop is the worst for parking & getting fuel. Very bad design !!!!!
6675018,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-24 17:12:00,8293,They don't have any stations North of Cloquet where they have (3). International Falls is the end of the road for Minnesota. I don't see Kwik Trip getting any further North than Virginia on Hwy 53.
6673420,Pooch,2022-07-18 03:14:00,4618,"Nice place, but a real challenge on Saturdays. Tried to get diesel while pulling our boat from Canada two weeks ago. It was a cluster to say the least. Once you turn in, you can't get out. People getting fuel then going inside to use the latrine or buy food and leaving their vehicle parked a the pump blocking access for people waiting for fuel. Nearly impossible to get in or out with a boat when busy. Once in, you cannot make the turn into the pumps nor try to get out. I wanted to leave but could not.Why can't people get their fuel then pull over and park without blocking the pumps while they go inside? People are so unaware of what is going on around them or just don't care about others anymore. There are options other than the Holiday. My first and probably my last time there.Just a early morning rant about peoples lack of common sense. I think I forgot to take my meds last night...Pooch"
6673422,Tonyo,2022-07-18 04:21:00,212,"Downtown International Falls has always been a challenge. If you are looking for a quick stop, bathroom break and back in the road I would use the truck stop on 332. It’s wide open, clean and no one around and you can avoid downtown. Oh, by the way, it’s much faster to and from the border crossing. TonyO."
6673424,walleyecheek,2022-07-18 04:32:00,2231,"So.....after these people fill up ! Where do you suggest they ""pull over to"" remember it's so congested, and also remember there are other options !"
6673446,btyreprich,2022-07-18 05:46:00,1067,"When we were going to Canada, we'd always fill up at the Holiday station closest to the border. As we would stay in town on Friday nights, we'd be sure to gas up that night after dinner - or when the station wasn't too busy. I know what you mean about these stations being busy and people leaving their cars / trucks / boats blocking several pumps while they were inside using the bathroom or grabbing a snack - sometimes for an extended period of time. We did have one adult move our truck & boat so as to free up the pump, but it can sometimes be a challenge given how crowded these stations can be. Sometimes you get stuck and feel bad for those waiting in line. Sure you can run across people who either don't realize what they are doing or just don't care. You would like to say something to them at times, but it's just not worth it."
6673458,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-18 06:30:00,8293,#1 option.
6673484,steve.a,2022-07-18 07:39:00,274,I fill the boat and truck at Virginia or Cook to avoid the congestion. It is enough to get me to Nestor Falls and back.
6673488,camp chef,2022-07-18 08:01:00,915,"We stop for gas, snacks, bathroom at the Ash river trail...Nice store and lots of room."
6673494,Lovetofish,2022-07-18 08:13:00,458,I stop at the station that's south of town a couple miles. On Friday's it's not real busy. Last fall it was closed but you could pay at the pump. Did that station open up again?
6673500,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-18 08:16:00,8293,"Just a heads up. He closes the store (Jims) in the winter so the dry goods on the shelves tend to be old. The prices across the board are also higher but I suppose that can be forgiven since it's a tourist stop. The locals only shop there if they have to. While the diesel pumps are easier to access the regular pumps really aren't much different than those in I-Falls. As far as Holiday goes, I never buy gas there I use other options but I'm also not towing a boat."
6673506,Hot Runr Guy,2022-07-18 08:26:00,16061,"just sayin' Hahahaha, HRG"
