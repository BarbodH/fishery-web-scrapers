6676098,kim n indiana,2022-07-29 05:45:00,62,why is it called the 'pin cushion' ?
6676102,stjoeguy,2022-07-29 06:03:00,979,"I think it refers to using pins on a map to mark where fish have been caught. So many people put pins there that it's like a pin cushion. That's my guess, anyhow."
6675008,SweetD,2022-07-24 16:01:00,243,"Just returned from our trip to Root Bay. As we had previously experienced Ryan and crew at Slate Falls Outpost were very accommodating. The trip started with some unseasonably warmer than normal weather even for July. Temps were in the 90’s I think for 3 consecutive days which may have slowed the fishing just slightly but we still caught all the fish we could handle by focusing on current areas areas where fish remained active and feeding. The infamous “pin cushion” did not produce like it is known to but not because of the warm temps but rather the high water. The water on the lake remains approximately 8’ higher than normal pool which all but eliminated the current from pushing through the pin cushion. We did find the neckdown/narrows closer to the dam produced significantly better as there was more current nearer to the ****. At any rate the aquarium like fishing that so many have talked about at the pin cushion before was hard to come by. The “revised pin cushion” area we found did produce very well but was closer to a 20 min run vs 5 min.A few of us made a couple of trips North to the Cat River inflow and had good success above the neckdown area on the fastest flowing section of the river. No monsters but lots of quality fish caught there up to 23 3/4”. We also found of quality producing spots a bit further East of the camp.“Wes Birthday Pleasure Point” produced lots of nice fish in the 19-22” range.“Taylor Island” was absolutely on fire with fish catching ranging from 15-24” in size……most were in that 17-21” range.“Rocking Rod’s Narrows” was also ablaze with solid quality fish being produced in that 18-23” range.“Dave’s Eater Fish Island” did just that produced quality eaters in the 17-19” range and was near the camp.“Below The ****” fishing was stupid. Throw a jig, catch a walleye between 16-19”. It also produced a 41+” Pike. It almost was boring after catching fish after fish after fish.We had 3 great guys from Walleye Central join our crew this year and while they were not near the fisherman we were it all worked out OK as 3 of the “Captains” from my normal group were able to put them on fish repeatedly throughout the week &#x1f642; Pete and I boated probably 150+ fish the last day of our trip thanks to my exemplary boatmanship and captaining!!!The docks were functional but in need of repair and Ryan and crew already have lumber and supplies on site to make the necessary repairs needed. The cabin and sleeping cabin were functional and comfortable. Finally, the food and ESPECIALLY the Award Winning French Toast was a hit! We had fresh from the Iowa field peaches and cream sweet corn coupled with famous Iowa Pork Chops one evening that was delish. Also on the menu was Walleye Jumbalya that was well received. Finally the freshly fried parmesan/kentucky kernal flour crispy crusted Walleye was off the hook delightful. To say we ate well would be an understatement! With that said there were a few complaints lodged regarding missing food/condiments items including Miracle Whip, Tobasco and last but certainly not least Oreo’s!!!!That was about it in a nutshell. Great outfitter, great lake, great fishing!!!!!Can’t wait until next year. Good luck to all of you still headed North this year. If I can assist any groups heading to Root Bay still this year feel free to give a shout!"
6675014,stjoeguy,2022-07-24 17:06:00,979,"Thanks for the great report. We're headed to Root Bay on Aug. 27. It's disappointing that the pin cushion didn't produce as expected. Our June trip to St. Joe also had a couple of ""sure thing"" spots from the past that weren't at all good this year. High water changes everything. I'm glad to hear that fishing below the dam produced well. We did it once last year and plan on it again. It's a bit of a chore to get there, so I'm glad it was worthwhile for you."
6675114,kim n indiana,2022-07-25 08:11:00,62,"Another point of view from this trip is below from one of the 3 'newbies'. we crossed border thursday AM at 6:30ish. easy. only car in line, 4/5 questions, 30 seconds later we are in. i've crossed at Sault St Marie before, this crossing was like going into Mexico. Driving around cement barriers, over RR tracks, behind buildings, was crazy. difference between 2 crossings locations is like nite/day. coming back on saturday, had 3 vehicles in front of us. maybe 5 min wait. 2 questions, and we are back into USA. The line of truck/boats on Sat AM to get into Canada was CRAZY. guessing 100+. We couldn't see end of line. Pity anyone waiting. Root bay cabin was great. nice setup. Skeeters were not near as bad as it was make out to be. We sat on deck and ate supper at nite several times. dock setup with 'slips' and handrails help old men get in/out and is appreciated.... Remember the water level is up 7+ ft above normal. changes every honey hole, and creates new ones. catching fish in 10' water last week becomes 3' at normal pool and is probably not hot spot. as mentioned, fishing below the cement structure holding back water was INSANE. A fish on almost every cast. upstream from there was another hot spot with wind blowing into point. 7 fish on 7 casts at one point. points all over lake produced. I didn't go hungry. Dave can cook. Any way walleye is cooked is also a positive on these trips. i'd rather have walleye every nite that eat hot dogs, chili dogs or brats. The French toast was little overrated and the green bread the one morning didn't help. catching the largest walleye at 25"" was also a plus to remind the boat captains about daily. enjoyed getting away with new guys on this trip. needed to get away for personal reasons and the beautiful water and scenery along with fresh pine smell was perfect. Off with Air Ivanhoe in another month with my wife. targeting smallies more on this trip. plus i will have a leg up on packing after this trip."
6675124,SweetD,2022-07-25 08:47:00,243,The green texas toast bread was definitely a bummer but we made an on the fly adjustment and had to use “regular bread” which definitely impacted the award winning french toast &#x1f60e; That and the fact I forgot my powdered sugar which would have easily camouflaged the green antibiotic rich bread!!! BTW Kim definitely showed the captains how to fish a crankbait……..he caught many many nice fish using crankbaits on our trip!!!Fun group and fun trip!
6675126,kim n indiana,2022-07-25 08:51:00,62,Big baits = bigger fish....
6675134,pnnylfr,2022-07-25 09:17:00,114,Thanks for the report. Sounds like a good trip had by all.
6675152,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-07-25 11:00:00,240,"Thanks! I've been waiting to hear the report. I was up in the boundary waters area part of that week, and I know how hot it was. I was one of those guys on the fence about going with--this outfitter/outpost has been on my radar for a while now. I think the need to reach out to others to fill a group, like you did, is going to be the norm going forward, for any outfitter that requires a group of six guys. I am going to be flying in with Nestor Falls Outposts next month, and we were only able to scratch together 4 guys, due to a few guys dropping--which our outfitter accepted due to the re-opening dynamics, but I know that will not fly for next year. Nice to be reading these reports again!"
6675154,stjoeguy,2022-07-25 12:03:00,979,Thank you to SweetD for sending me some new locations to try at the end of August!
6675792,gordy28,2022-07-27 19:44:00,437,"Thanks for sharing, sounds like an awesome trip. Can’t imagine the water levels that high. When we were there two years ago it was the opposite and the pin cushion was the ticket. Below the dam was also great but not as good as it sounds like it was for youCheersAndrew"
6676028,Fishquest,2022-07-28 16:51:00,89,Thanks for the report and we were up the same week and it sure was warm in the north but the fishing always impresses.
