6674932,hawks_rule,2022-07-24 10:28:00,115,"I was at Crawford's Camp in the middle of June. We stayed in one of the newly remodeled cabins #10 and it was very nice, first time for us staying at the camp. In the past years we would stop at Crawford's for gas in the morning. We were surprised that it had air conditioning as well. The air conditioning was needed for the first 2 days for sure. I've been fishing in Canada for the last 30 years and this year was among the best ever. We did very well on numbers and size with 2-27's and a 28 being the largest. We don't do much fishing close to the camp, we travel about 25 miles for the vast majority of our fishing. Well managed camp and great location."

6675122,Bill Krejca,2022-07-25 08:32:00,6107,"Yup, it was there as long as I can remember, 1940's, probably longer. That camp is still there, but the name has been changed. Bill"

6675258,alanexpup,2022-07-25 20:26:00,278,We stayed at the fathers camp. There are 3 or 4 of them. Each son has one.
6675982,proguidedream,2022-07-28 13:50:00,345,"cabins are decent. id give it a 3 out of 5. we had a small cabin and it just lacked a bit of comfartable chairs to sit in the evening. had a couch-tv but the wood chairs didnt cut it ... fishing is good depends what your looking for and how far you want to go. water is maybe the clearest on the whole lake, like crystal clear. Bass and trout are right there, musky around the corners, just had to put a couple miles on for the walleys."
6676154,Fisherman Ted,2022-07-29 08:40:00,461,Matt and Karley are just wonderful hosts and owners. Can't say enough about them. They put me and my entire staff up for a week last year when we were evacuated due to forest fires. Nice clean cabins. Great boats. Can't say enough about them -FT
