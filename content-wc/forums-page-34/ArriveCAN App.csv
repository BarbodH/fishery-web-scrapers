6673790,Cgillespie,2022-07-19 08:24:00,120,"When we went through customs last month at the Winnipeg Airport, it was no big deal. The customs agent was very business like and asked a lot of questions, but nothing really about ArriveCAN. I get the feeling they will keep using it for a while, since it keeps some people that they would rather not have in the country, out. The agent asked detailed questions about where I lived, what I did for a living, and what I was doing there. I'm sure being from Arkansas raises red flags."
6673796,Mojo-NC,2022-07-19 09:14:00,1929,"I guarantee you that the border agents are aware of the information that you submit via ArriveCAN. Your passport is linked to ArriveCAN and the photographs that you take of your vaccination card are available to confirm that you have been fully vaccinated. They also know that I crossed last September and was fully vaccinated then. This year I was concerned that the border agent would inquire about why I stated that I would cross the border on Friday but we didn't actually cross the border until Saturday. Delta Airlines made us miss our flight to INL on Friday after I had already submitted my information. There is no way to update the information once you submit. I would have had to delete everything and start over, so I took a chance. He didn't even ask about it. He asked where we were from, where we were going, and the purpose of our trip. He asked about firearms, if the truck was a rental vehicle, and if we would be bringing anything back from Canada. He asked about our beer/liquor and indicated where we needed to park to go inside and pay our duty. Super friendly - easy peasy. He even joked with us. In all the years we've been going to Canada, we've never had a difficult time crossing the border."
6673914,guidedfishing,2022-07-19 14:20:00,531,"Mojo-NC. Very easy to delete and resubmit, there is a little icon once you submit that allows you to delete and basically just put the correct date and time in without a total do over. Brother did it in June when he put in the wrong date. Happens all the time. Glad you had no issues."
6673970,Esoxmike,2022-07-19 19:08:00,114,Good info
6674114,fishingfever,2022-07-20 14:51:00,85,I uploaded my vaccination card to ArriveCAN last year and had no problem crossing the border. Does it have to be uploaded again this year when filling out the ArriveCAN app? I've had 2 booster shots since I crossed last year.
6674144,Esoxmike,2022-07-20 18:28:00,114,"2 boosters,probably why you got a fishingfever,lol"
6674952,Shellback,2022-07-24 12:19:00,8083,"When you fill out all the info required on the arrivecan website, does it save it? I'd like to fill out the forms for my wife and I, then plug in the dates when I know for sure."
6675052,combine_billy,2022-07-24 20:56:00,151,"it does on the app, assume it would also on the website"
6671910,glncanada99,2022-07-11 17:18:00,13,Same here too. Passport only. Fort Frances
6671942,kettyspanky,2022-07-11 19:04:00,271,Last year I had to show my arrivecan receipt. I'll bring it again this year but maybe they have relaxed some things.
6671962,AsianAngler,2022-07-11 20:47:00,67,We used Rogers cell service and ArriveCan today. No issues.
6672004,Golden Eagle,2022-07-12 06:08:00,2642,Where did you cross the border?
6672580,SweetD,2022-07-14 08:04:00,243,"Just crossed Fort Frances. Asked to see passports but did not look at ArriveCan or vaccine cards etc. Strange. Oh well, we are in and flyin this afternoon"
6672596,combine_billy,2022-07-14 08:58:00,151,"That is normal, the only reason they would ask to see this is if there is an issue with the app. And there are issues with the app, one in our group kept getting emails the entire time we were up there asking about his quarantine. When he got back in the states he called them and they told him not to worry, it is just a bug in the app."
6672730,BreezyPoint,2022-07-14 21:54:00,1581,"If you filled out Arrivecan and provided your passport number the system will automatically pull up the Arrivecan info when they scan your passport. We actually asked the border agent why he didn't need the Arrivescan receipt and that is what he told us. They have not relaxed things, just improved the system."
6673680,AsianAngler,2022-07-18 20:09:00,67,"We crossed at Baudette/Rainy River, but in May we crossed at Intl Falls. No issues there either."
6673724,Shellback,2022-07-19 06:12:00,8083,Any news on Canada dropping the arrive Canada requirement? I usually stay in Gananoque on the St Lawrence. It's about a 10 minute drive to the border crossing at the Thousand Islands. My wife has MS and is prone to requiring medical treatment which previously was no problem. Just run across the border to the hospital in Alexandria bay. We gave up our trip last fall and this spring due to the need for app. We have had the need to do multiple trips for treatment or checkups. Don't see how that is possible if you need to give advance notice on your crossings.
6673776,guidedfishing,2022-07-19 07:51:00,531,"Shellback, you can literally do the ArriveCan app 5 mins before you cross as long as you get the confirmation receipt. There is no requirement to do it any specific time. The only limitation is you can not do it more than 72hrs in advance of your crossing."
6671642,dakota eye,2022-07-10 06:28:00,69,It looks like it is temporarily not working everyone. Has anyone used the travelers document from the Canadian Govt instead?
6671678,reddemon2,2022-07-10 09:19:00,255,What you mean it's not working? Sometimes you need to uninstall and re-install the app
6671686,Golden Eagle,2022-07-10 11:18:00,2642,Is Rogers Internet service still down? The outage is causing major problems.
6671692,dakota eye,2022-07-10 11:58:00,69,That is exactly the problem. Apparently you have to fill out paperwork to get across the border now.
6671698,Golden Eagle,2022-07-10 12:29:00,2642,When will you be crossing the border? Hopefully a fix will happen before you cross.
6671700,reddemon2,2022-07-10 12:39:00,255,You can print all your info from the App beforehand
6671702,reddemon2,2022-07-10 12:43:00,255,"Upon arrival, a Canadian Border Services officer will ask to see your ArriveCAN receipt. If you're not carrying a smartphone or other device, be sure to have a printout of our ArriveCAN receipt ready Right from the Border Patrol page"
6671750,Knutson21,2022-07-11 05:29:00,348,"I have never been asked to show Arrivecan receipt via paper or smart phone crossing into Canada. They scan my passport and say looks like you filled out your Arrivecan app correctly, thank you."
6671760,whyknot,2022-07-11 06:03:00,141,Same here!
6671770,guidedfishing,2022-07-11 06:34:00,531,Up until my last trip I had not been asked to show an arrive can receipt either.. Crossing in June the border officer says to both my brother and I looks like you did not complete your ArriveCan app. He was nice and says that sometimes happens that it does not show up in our system if you did it just before arrival. Both my brother and I had completed it independent of each other 48hrs earlier so it certainly had plenty of time to hit the system. He asked if we had our ArriveCan receipts which we did. He looked at them and 30 sec's later we were on our way with no further questions. So yes I was glad I took the 2 mins to print out the receipt even though in two previous crossings I had not been asked.
