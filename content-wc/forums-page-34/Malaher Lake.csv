That's where I would go first. Jon and Dave at the base will mark your map with plenty of good spots, and, because these lakes are all fairly small, your odds of getting on fish right away will be pretty good. Cabela's, right now, has a sweet little Walleye Plastics box/kit for $24.99, that will provide you with all the plastics (150+) you will need for a week up there. I used them on my last trip, and they are excellent. Bring Gulp or Powerbait if you prefer their line of plastics. You can bring crawlers, if you want live bait. I've never been to Malaher, but I've been to 3 other lakes with Nestor Falls Outposts, and I'm confident they will show you a great trip. Good luck."

Dave will mark a map and you won't have to travel far. I don't remember any bait restrictions when I fished there shortly after Dave acquired the cabin. I don't go on a trip without bait of some sort. In the fall large chubs are my favorite. If not permitted I'd take plenty of crawlers. Leeches become unavailable sometime in early August. You might ask Dave about frozen or salted minnows. If allowed, you'll have to call around to the local bait shops up there. They work well too."
