Fishing for walleye was very tough as we didn't catch the numbers that we have in past trips. Of the walleye we did catch I bet 90% of them were under 13 inches long. We fished crawlers and minnows (equally), mostly with bottom bouncers and some with jigs. We fished submerged reefs and shoreline structure (shallow as 15 feet down to 30 feet deep) with little to no change in the overall size of the walleye we caught. Color didn't seem to matter nor did the style of the spinner blade. One bonus for our group was the jumbo perch that were caught while chasing walleye. We boated numerous perch in the 12 to 13 inch range. Our weather was too good on Friday - high sky, no wind, HOT, and then Saturday was overcast with a passing thunder shower that forced us to shore seeking shelter from the winds and driving rain. We're hopefully heading back in September and looking forward to more and bigger fish then."
6673584,Old Timer,2022-07-18 12:50:00,255,"I fished the Morson area July 8th and 9th. We fished a few miles south of Rubber. Maybe lucky, but the two of us thought our fishing was pretty good by LOTW standards. We dealt with a soft mayfly hatch and still caught in the range of 40-50 each day. Many were over sixteen and quite a few in the 18-22 inch range, with several topping out at 24 inches. No perch however. Our most productive method was slow trolling humps with a spinner and crawler, right on the bottom. To our advantage was the stable weather for the days before we arrived and during the days we fished."
6673846,walleyeguy3,2022-07-19 10:22:00,42,There was still a hatch of some sort going on as the surface was littered with hatch remains. I hope we weren't moving around too fast. Maybe we were too impatient and should have slowed down some. Hopefully we get a chance to catch more and bigger fish in September. Gotta change gears now and get ready for a trip up to Scout Lake on Lac Seul in a few weeks.

6674134,walleyeguy3,2022-07-20 16:47:00,42,Thanks for the link. I definitely need to get more comfortable with plastics. It sure seems like this is a growing method of catching walleye.
