6674924,dmorgan4,2022-07-24 09:21:00,14,"From the 2022 Ontario Summary of fishing regulations, Ontario is divided into four bait fish management zones which affect the transportation and management of baitfish and leeches. Nightcrawlers are not addressed. Would suggest that all non-residents read the complete portion of these regulations as there are a few gotcha's included. Probably wouldn't hurt the resident license holders either as there are limits imposed on bait for them, also. Enjoyed our early July trip but it does pay to know before you go! Leeches were small and costly but we did have 2 stay at home summers to prepare."
