It's still not a bad lake, besides the scenery being beautiful there still are fish being caught. But work and patience is involved. Small Mouth are a under fished resource here and the Pike fishing can be outstanding also. But make no mistake, this isn't a 500 acre Canadian lake with one out post cabin on it."
6673212,btyreprich,2022-07-17 05:50:00,1067,Need help / directions on Rainy Lake please. Trip will take place from August 6th thru 13th and we will stay at Camp Idlewood out of International Falls. This lake is new to us so I would like to ask those with experience on this section of Rainy what areas to target for fish. I thank you in advance for all responses.
6673218,reddemon2,2022-07-17 06:06:00,255,"I'd just pay the extra $$ for a guide for the day, There are so many areas to cover on that lake, Along with Navigation Buoys and other obstacles"
6673226,btyreprich,2022-07-17 06:39:00,1067,"Financially, this option would be very hard for us. You don't have to convince me on the benefits of using a guide - especially on a new body of water. Plus the guides have to make a living and cover their expenses. Should there not be enough responses to my request for help, we might hire a guide for a half day."
6673280,Jakerides,2022-07-17 12:00:00,223,"First you better have a lake map chip, lots of unmarked rocks and hazards. Even more difficult this year because of flooding! In August Walleyes are usually on the open water humps. Generally the furthest east you go the better. Sometimes trolling spinners with crawlers near shore in the evening can work really good. I don't sit on a spot unless I mark fish they can be on the shallow peak or on edge of drop off. Also try slip bobbing with leeches if jigs aren't working. Last resort try Lindy rig, short leader tail hook minnow while dead sticking with. Good luck it is a beautiful lake."
6673308,Baseline,2022-07-17 16:51:00,3207,"Rainy has some rocks, but is well marked with navigation markers. Just be careful when you venture off the Nav routes. You can buy nav maps which will give you the location most rocky areas and submerged reefs. If you have a chip all the better. In the area you are going to be in you will find several mid lake reefs on Seine Bay. Reef tops go from 20 feet to 35 feet and dropping off to 90. This is where the guides will take you. Jigs and minnows fished slowly are the way I fish in mid August. Keep knocking holes in the water until you locate fish then hover over them. Lots of people drag crawler and bottom bouncers too. You can work your way down to Olson's reef which is well known and there are usually boats on it. These are big reefs so there is lots of room. You can go to Brule Narrows and fish out in front of the entrance around several islands located in this area. Be careful not to cross into Canada. You can also shoot through Brule into South Bay and fish the big reefs located near the south entrance to the narrows. Brule is well marked with Nav buoys. One note it is a long haul to Brule from where you are staying and the route is well marked. Also pay attention where you see groups of other boats fishing and try those when they are clear. There aren't many secrets on Rainy. Once you locate some fish you can usually find them in the same place for a few days."
6673512,Old Timer,2022-07-18 08:48:00,255,"BTYTRE: I don't want to be a Debbie Downer on your first trip to Rainy and then taking it in August. But Rainy is a BIG lake and, for me, it took quite a bit of effort to get started and begin catching fish. I'm a DIY sort of guy, but for Rainy I began with a couple of guide trips and then fishing with knowledgeable locals. There's a learning curve with Rainy that you don't encounter with fly-in outposts and an outfitter's map. I believe you're staying at a camp that is a long boat ride from where many anglers fish Rainy this time of year the humps on either side of the Brule Narrows. I suspect Seine Bay is not on your radar as that's a further trip and on the Canadian side. I recommend that you reach deep in your pockets and pony up for a good guide. And I suggest you use the guide for the first two or three days. Yes, expensive. But you're going on a fishing trip and nothing is worse than not catching fish. I've had a number of friends who didn't take this advice and most had disappointing trips to Rainy. Those who did hire guides for their first trips never complained afterwards. If the cost of a guide is beyond your means I would look to the camp owner for some tips on where to start. Also, drop by the cleaning shed and see what you can pick up there. And departing guests may point you to spots where they had their best luck. Good luck on your trip and give us a report."
6673516,Jakerides,2022-07-18 09:02:00,223,"PLEASE NOTE; As of last Friday only the main routes are marked(red and green cans) all the markers for rocks and what are now submerged reefs are not placed yet, theses are the smaller white markers. Wayne"
6674152,Sylvanboat,2022-07-20 18:48:00,94,We fished Rainy Lake last summer due to Canada being closed. Even with a guide fishing was a challenge.
6674250,ChuckD,2022-07-21 08:45:00,1581,"Been fishing Rainy for many years. Before these incredible maps, and sonar technologies, the fishing was really good. It seems every year the fishing becomes more difficult. Last two summers during our trips have been quite poor. Our group dissolved our camping trip because the fishing was quite difficult (and worsening), and last year we experienced the worst wind and waves on our final day with 15 miles to get back to our vehicles. Every year we seem to have some really rough wind and waves, so if there is stiff west or east winds in the forecast, don't travel far from camp. We almost didn't make it last year, but our boats were heavily loaded and not ready for the massive waves we encountered in the open basin of Rainy. In August, find mid-lake humps, drive around, and if you don't see obvious signs of fish, keep moving until you graph some. If you see fish, and don't find that they are interested in your presentation, leave. This happens a lot. Fishing in August can be a challenge."
6674258,Old Timer,2022-07-21 09:41:00,255,"For years Rainy was one of my spring destination trips. No more. Unfortunately, that lake has taken a recent beating because of Covid. Fishermen who couldn't get into Canada landed on Rainy in droves with their sophisticated electronics. Rainy now needs a rest. Some guides are saying the same thing."
