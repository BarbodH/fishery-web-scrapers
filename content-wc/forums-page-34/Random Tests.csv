6676206,Old Timer,2022-07-29 13:58:00,255,I think it's strictly random so they get statistically valid results. I heard they hand out so many randoms depending on how many cross over at any given customs station. A knowledgeable outfitter told me last week that they're concentrating more at air terminals than at auto crossings. Even if true that doesn't mean a thing if you're tagged. We were nailed last year and low probably didn't make me feel any better.

You must complete your arrival test with an approved test provider. Your test provider is based on where you entered the country. The test is free. Who must take an arrival test if selected to do so upon arrival Already recovered from COVID-19You are exempt from arrival testing if you: provide a positive COVID-19 molecular test result, conducted at least 10 calendar days and no more than 180 calendar days before entering Canada. A positive antigen test is not accepted. Counting starts the day after your test. for example, if your positive COVID-19 molecular test was taken on January 1, then January 11 would be the first day you could use it January 11 would be the earliest scheduled departure date of your flight to Canada, or the first day you could use it to enter Canada by land or water if your positive proof is accepted you won't have to take an arrival test It looks official to me, but who knows. In any event don't sweat it. You probably won't be selected. If you are, just find a place with a table and internet connection, take the test and drop it off at a collection site. Where are you crossing?"
