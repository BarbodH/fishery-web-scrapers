Walleye fishing was marginal at best and we could only find a few spots. The smallies in the narrows were pretty feisty. Whitefish were a bonus.What I didn't like: There is a train track that runs on the (south, I think) shore of the lake. A train seems to go through every 30 minutes. Hard to feel isolated with that happening. The lake is east/west, so it can be come a fierce wind tunnel at times.Fish On!Hooks"

Canyon is a clear water lake and as such, the bite tends to be early and late. Can be difficult to find walleyes mid-day, especially if the sun is out. This lake contains a lot of really big walleyes. We've caught many over 25"" with the largest being just shy of 31"". On our best trip, three of us boated around 60 walleye over 25"". As HeHooksHimself mentioned, there are muskie, which is a nice bonus. Someone in my group would manage to catch an accidental muskie each trip, and it's common for a muskie to steal your walleye as you bring it in. Oddly, there are no pike in the lake. They have a really nice family package rate, and the Lecots are fine hosts. When I stayed there, they did a nice potluck dinner where they provided the main course. For our trip, it was a moose roast, which was terrific. It's not a numbers lake, but I'm sure if they sit down with Wayne when they get there he will be able to help them put together a strategy to put fish in the boat."
