5559089,West Newton River Rat,2017-05-21 10:49:00,128,I have fished Onaman a few times for Lake Trout in the early spring but have never been there when the walleye season is open on Nipigon Lake. A friend wants to go up there in July and try for Lake Trout and walleye on the big lake. However I have no experience with fishing walleye on Nipigon. Does anyone have any experiences with fishing walleye on Lake Nipigon in the summer out of Onaman Resort they could share? We realize there are a lot of small lake to go to around there but we would like to stay on Nipigon for our fishing. Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Best spot is where the Little Jackfish river enters in the far north end of the bay. Also the river itself (you can navigate upstream a fair piece from Nipigon). The Little Jackfish is a long run though, at least 57 km's one way from the mouth of the Onaman River where it flows into the lake."
5559145,Mike Borger,2017-05-21 12:09:00,1554,"I know you said you want to stay on Nipigon, but a day trip to Onaman Lake would be your best bet by far for large numbers of walleyes without making an almost 120km round trip by boat."
5573793,West Newton River Rat,2017-05-27 17:03:00,128,"Yea, I'm not going to go that far north to fish walleyes. That would be one long boat trip. Onaman lake sounds like what we need to do."
5573889,Moosebunk,2017-05-27 19:31:00,211,"There's good reason some charters will run from the Beardmore launch to the Jackfish, but to go from the mouth of the Onaman River to there isn't really that big a deal on a good weather day. At 30-35mph you're there in an hour and half and fishing amazing walleye waters. A good time to enjoy a coffee or two and the ride there... But you could cut it down to about a 12 mile boating distance. Just don't use your bigger boat. If July or August is the plan you could likely trailer and launch one of O.R.R.'s 14 footers into Ombabika Bay itself. Fishing alone in one a couple seasons back I went out on the big lake to the Murchison at 29mph on the GPS... O.R.R. has rentals that on a calm day would suit any walleye fishing needs. Your buddy wants lakers and eyes and that combo would be best served the closer to June opener as possible. This year the suckers in Onaman River have spawned two weeks later than usual, and the eyes will be late too. Early July could be solid for Onaman eyes in the river, at the mouth and where many like to fish them too, out in the shallow bay. On a one week trip splitting the two species, I'd recommend every calm water chance you get, take advantage and fish lakers out in the big water and choose a solid one full day run to Jackfish on the best day. In the dirtier weather, fish the Onaman River or the Humboldt back bays, or take a day no one would regret at Onaman Lake. Big west wind you won't be happy on Nipigon but you will on Onaman Lake. Other walleye optional lakes as well could be Northwind, Frank, Babika and I think you can even get into Toronto. Cool thing about anything you could catch in Nipigon is, it could be a giant. The walleye fishing there is great too. It's generally not ""fly-in fishing"" great on the main lake but it can be as good or even better, in some of the places mentioned above."

I am happy with the Lakers myself but it is a good idea to get to know what the entire area has to offer!! If the wind keeps you off Nipigon, fishing walleye in a smaller lake would be far better than playing cribbage all day."
