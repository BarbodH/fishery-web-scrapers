5668826,fishpoop,2017-07-17 09:02:00,630,I've got a 6 foot piece of solid aluminum pipe that I use as an extension handle for my socket torque wrench. The added length acts as a lever and makes loosening a lug nut easy. It just rides around in the pickup truck bed. Not sure anymore where I got it. I think it's supposed to be a conduit pipe for electrical wiring.
5657274,Bitinlight,2017-07-10 18:34:00,95,"Just drove 502 today, July10. Road outside Construction Zone seems OK. Not great, but OK. When you enter the Construction Zone, watch for the orange signs with black bump symbols on them. SLOW WAY DOWN when you see those signs. If you aren't pulling a boat, still SLOW WAY DOWN. If you are pulling something, SLOW WAY DOWN to a crawl. The bumps are really bad. Also, I experienced one 10-15 delay where they were working where there was a flagwoman. Only one way traffic. Drive safely."
5658226,Lovetofish,2017-07-11 09:03:00,458,"Thanks, I'll be on it Friday afternoon."
5658290,bigwalleye1,2017-07-11 09:12:00,2632,I'll be in front of you. I expect to be in Dryden by noon.
5658394,fishmanric,2017-07-11 09:43:00,219,"Yes, there are many bad spots and one can be fooled after going over a few that are not really bumps but are posted. We stopped after going over one waiting for the rest of my party to catch up. We witnessed a near miss, as two trucks pulling boats slowed to take the bump and were almost rear ended by a speeding mini van. Turned out my sons tuck lost boost do to a clamp coming off. He was still working on it when I got there. If you go to fast some boat trailers are going to bottom out. Be safe and slow down."
5658946,packpro,2017-07-11 12:55:00,695,"We went through there awhile ago. Just a warning, some of the bump signs were placed far enough back to give you time to slow down. Others were very close to the bump. When you see one do not wait to start the process especially if you are pulling a boat."
5668146,Rich B,2017-07-16 20:27:00,1081,"Just returned from a Vermilion Bay area fishing camp, and took the 502 north. Some of their construction areas were just loose gravel and a little bumpy, and others were large pot holes and large ruts. We were in an Excursion pulling my Lund Pro-V and it was a rough ride even when we slowed way down. This is the worst I have ever seen the 502, and I could see that those ruts and pot holes could easily snap a boat trailer axle if going too fast. Then we drove through the construction on 17 from Dryden to Vermilion Bay. Took me an afternoon to get off the worst of the blacktop shavings that blew up on my Lund, and my trailer is still coated and needs cleaned. We returned to Int'l Falls via the Sioux Falls western route, and it was a much better road which we will take on future trips. Rich B"
5668442,kevinvjacobs,2017-07-17 06:19:00,48,"Since 502 is in such bad shape, would it be about as fast to go west of Fort Frances and then north on 71 to 17 and then back east to 72?"
5668498,fishmanric,2017-07-17 06:41:00,219,I'm heading back up next Thursday and am thinking about taking 61 up the north shore of Lake Superior. About two hours longer but much better road conditions and no congestion at the boarder crossing. Beautiful to.
5668578,Plotman,2017-07-17 07:16:00,394,"We brought 502 up on Saturday enroute to the Vermillion Bay area and saw 2 boat trailers roadside suffering damage from ""the bumps"". One had blown a tire and once at camp learned that the other had broken their leaf springs. I found that most were marked well enough and that when I read of all the problems prior our trip knew ahead of time to take it slow. The problem I found was those following, running right up your outboard when I tried to slow down for the rough spots. Even though I was exceeding the speed limit a bit to try to avoid being rear-ended, I am guessing had I not been the ""pace car"" they would have probably suffered trailer damage as well. In the event I use 502 to return home I will be utilizing the pulp check pullover areas to let the tailgaters pass. We will be looking over a map for our return trip in hopes of finding a better route back."
5668610,kevinvjacobs,2017-07-17 07:24:00,48,"Looking at Google maps it looks like it is around 1 hour and 12 minutes longer to go west from Ft Frances and then north versus using 502. Our trip is several weeks away, so I will be checking on 502 conditions later."
5633362,fishmanric,2017-06-27 05:44:00,219,Some years ago I blew out a trailer tire after hitting a sharp pot hole on 502. I was eating those little pesky bugs while changing the tire out. At least they weren't mosquitos.
5633562,IronDioPriest,2017-06-27 07:36:00,96,"I also had a spare, but since we were still on the way to Dryden and then to Mahkwa, I didn't want to put it on and have no spare, so I made the decision to replace both tires right then and there, since I was a mile away from a tire store."
5634306,Bakefish,2017-06-27 13:08:00,1077,This is why I carry two spares when I travel to Canada. I had a flat one year before I carried two and was freaked out the entire time. Couldn't find a store that had my size trailer tires in stock. Now that I carry two spares I haven't had a flat. So there ya go.
5634346,IronDioPriest,2017-06-27 13:14:00,96,Not a bad precaution.
5634794,fishinnut 3446,2017-06-27 15:42:00,638,I have never had to replace a blown tire yet.............. But on the long journey I always take floor jack/4 way and my 18v Mil.impact
5634842,law57,2017-06-27 16:21:00,1147,"I had two spares with me this year. I also take an impact wrench, 4-way, and a floor jack for the truck and a smaller one for the trailer. Everything is right there in my garage anyway. I also have a 3-gallon pail with a gasketed lid - I have bearing 'stuff' in there. Extra (used) hubs, old bearings that have been re-packed and put into small zip-lock backs, latex gloves, grease, cotter keys, channel lock, some emery cloth, I don't remember all that's in there - paper towel... Anyway, anything needed if a bearing goes - unless the spindle is completely destroyed. I have never had to use any of it - for myself. Twice, over the years, I've stopped to help others that have a bad bearing. They generally offer my their first born after I get them going again! It only takes a few minutes and usually it's on a Saturday when auto parts stores are closed. People are in a hurry with a long way to go."

5635434,BornToFish,2017-06-28 05:14:00,1224,"Greetings,I have a question for FishNut. You mentioned a great idea about carrying with you a Milwaukee 18v Impact Wrench. Hopefully you won't need it, but if you do, you sure will be glad to have it with you. You caused me to think that I might want to carry one of these with me as well, as we go well beyond ""services"". My question is as follows: how long will the 18v battery hold its charge? I was wondering if I should need it, will the battery even have a charge left to power the wrench?Kindest regards...."
5635770,law57,2017-06-28 07:57:00,1147,"My 20V DeWalt will hold a charge for a long time - and I take it to Canada with me. I also have a 20V DeWalt flashlight - that's my back-up battery should I need one. Obviously it depends on the health of the battery. But knowing Milwaukee quality the battery charge should last a long a long, long time. Certainly for a trip of a week or two.Edited to add: If you have a flat and can't loosen the lug nuts with your wrench. Try this - it works best with a 4-way and a pipe cheater - Put as much pressure on the pipe as you can and have someone strike the socket 4-way, with a hammer, opposite (180 degrees) from the nut you are trying to loosen. It's the same principal as an impact wrench and works wonders. Obviously it's best with two people - but it does work."
5645761,Slim03,2017-07-04 15:09:00,159,Just coming back today from Lac Seul and it is still in really bad shape although looks like they maybe getting closer to resurfacing. It was raining so hard on the way up you couldn't tell where the potholes were and we took a couple really hard even though we were being cautious. The culvert replacements are awful. One is ok the next is so bad it can break your trailer so have to slow down for all of them. Edge of the road in the southbound lane is really bad too. Lot of times had to drive in both lanes just to be traveling without worry of damaging the trailer. Hope they get it fixed soon.
5612953,law57,2017-06-15 19:17:00,1147,This will be my 36th year - probably 50 trips. We used to go west from FF - north thru Nester Falls and back east to Dryden. 502 was a god send. I just drive the speed limit. Maybe a little more (55-60mph). There's nothing to be gained by trying to make time on that stretch. I try to let people pass when there's an opportunity. A couple of years ago I was south bound and some morons passed me on a yellow line - it was really a bad move. If you know 502 there is no place to go but down or into a rock face. I stopped in I-Falls at MacDonald's for a coffee - I was standing right behind the morons. Their aggressiveness and inpatients gained them not a thing.
5622546,bigwalleye1,2017-06-21 09:18:00,2632,"Just returned from Sioux Lookout through Dryden to I falls by way of 72 and 502. Going north, there is about 10 km of sporadic construction on the 502, begins about 90 km north of the Falls. Looks like culvert replacement and posts and cables. Multiple crews working. This is also the worst road stretch of 502, road edges deteriorating. Lots of stakes in the ditches. My guess is the culverts go in first, then the cables and posts, and they're preparing for a resurface, as they are replacing the cabling anchor blocks as well, and aren't very careful about ripping up the roadway to get the old ones out and the new ones in.Alternating lanes during daylight hours with flaggers. The construction on 72 is a bridge replacement several km south of the Hudson turnoff. They were laying in the foam on the northbound side, and the sheet pinning is in place. That one looks like it's going to go all summer. Alternating lanes on way at a time, flaggers during the day and a signal at night."
5624202,tv4fish,2017-06-21 20:28:00,2694,"Hey Big SOOOOO - How was the fishing in your ""usual"" spots???"
5624586,bigwalleye1,2017-06-22 05:41:00,2632,"Fish seemed really scattered to me, with a bite that seemed to get tougher as the week went on. Our last day on the water was Monday, the 19th. Lots of short hits and small fish, more this trip than in the past. Seemed like we were living in the middle of a giant cold front. Some rain every day. Solid 62 degree water temps everywhere we went, so the fish weren't congregated. Managed a shore lunch or dinner every day except the last, and our take home fish as well, but they weren't giving them away. Did manage some over slots early in the trip, and a nice fat 29"" on the last day. All are still there. Looking forward to the next trip in 3 weeks."
5626186,law57,2017-06-22 18:55:00,1147,Went up 502 Saturday (5/17) and returned today (5/22). I thought the road was good - a few bumps. There were 'bump' signs. That means if you slow down your truck and boat won't suffer. If you go fast they will bounce. To complain about the road and also complain about the construction makes no sense to this old geezer...
5630282,Bullman,2017-06-25 08:34:00,17,"Went up 502 June 16th and saw many of the bump signs. Most of the bumps were not very bad. Returning on the 23rd, there was a semi flipped over in the ditch and they were about to shut down the road to try and flip it back over. We got by just in time. Then we found out the they decided to tear up the road at each of the bump signs, putting in flag men at each one, one lane only. This on one of the busiest weekends. Felt sorry for all those heading up late morning. Not sure how long they were going to be delayed."
5630362,ogilville,2017-06-25 09:29:00,262,"I drove North on 502 and 105 on 6/17 and back South yesterday 6/24. The previous reports were accurate. I made note that around the 50 mile point driving North on 502 for about 20 miles the construction was ongoing. It was mostly culvert replacement, new wooden post and cable guard rails and cleaning out the ditches. The bumps at the signs varied from not bad to kind of rough. Like it was mentioned if you slowed down for each one the bumps were tolerable. From Vermilion Bay North on 105 for approx. 15 miles the construction was ongoing also. They seemed to be mostly cleaning out the ditches and had flaggers controlling the flow to one lane around the equipment in each direction. I can only say what I saw for about 40 miles I drove up 105. In both cases the crews were working on Sat. in the rain to get the jobs done. A little patience and common sense made trip not bad at all."
5631674,rockape,2017-06-26 07:46:00,215,"We saw the flipped truck on Friday afternoon. WOW! I wonder how it happened. I didn't see a dead moose or another vehicle. There were several construction zones where it was down to one lane. Pay attention so you can stop in time. My biggest issue on the 502 this past Friday was a young lady in a minivan traveling below the speed limit. Very frustrating! Our fishing was great last week. One slow day, but the action was really good otherwise. 29 was the biggest. Caught a TON of big pike too."
5633090,IronDioPriest,2017-06-26 21:01:00,96,"I blew my trailer tire on 53 in MN. That road is in awful shape. Lucky for me, it didn't explode, it just warped. I noticed it in my mirror as I passed through the customs lane, and made a 1/2 hour stop at the Goodyear store in Fort Frances to get two new replacements.I'm really glad I noticed before I hit the 502, but bad roads are everywhere - not just rural Canada."
5633258,tv4fish,2017-06-27 04:56:00,2694,"Wow: Talk about a ""coincidence"". That exact same thing happened to me a few years ago (well, ALMOST exactly). We had stopped to gas up in Dryden at the big truck stop on the way back home. They have portable signs with concrete bases ""scattered"" throughout their gas up area. I must have hit one with a trailer and damaged one of the tires. When we got to the border crossing at Fort Frances and were waiting in line - the guy behind me came up and said ""You have a bad bulge in one of your trailer tires"". As soon as we crossed the border, we pulled over and changed the tire. I did have a spare on the trailer tongue."

5604409,Bakefish,2017-06-12 11:15:00,1077,"Secondary Highway 502, commonly referred to as Highway 502, is a provincially maintained secondary highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. The highway is 151.7 kilometres (94.3 mi) long, connecting Highway 11 east of Fort Frances with Highway 17 in Dryden, via Highway 594. It also carries the Great River Road designation. The route was constructed throughout the mid- to late 1970s as a new connection between Highway 11 and Highway 17, known as the Manitou Road. It opened in 1980. Another Highway 502 existed between 1956 and 1973, a short alternative route to Highway 2 near Napanee.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Highway_502"

First is approx. 50 miles south of 17. Rebuilding the road edges. One lane traffic with a flag person. The other is 10 miles further down the road. Replacing a culvert under the road. They had 3/4 of the road removed down to the bog. Had to drive on shoulder (?) and what little road was left. That also was an area with a flag person controlling one way traffic. You will lose time waiting to be waved through, and you will lose time as traffic congests 10-20 vehicles long. You will only be able to go as fast as the slowest car in the group with few passing opportunities. There is orange paint on the road in many other areas where the road edges will need to be rebuilt. They are also replacing wood and cable guard rails along the entire stretch. We had no delays going up, but we hit that stretch around 6:30PM last Friday 6/2 . No work being done at that time. Time difference was about 35 minutes. Hope this helps and hope others update as it looks like their is more 502 work to do though the summer. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"

Thinking back to August 1972 (my first trip to Red Lake), I believe our camp owner must have told us 502 was being constructed and would soon be open, saving us travel time. There was talk and excitement about the new road. Now there's talk of a future road connecting Red Lake to Winnipeg. I've heard no date and will not, at this time, inform others that I've driven on it."
5606073,Bakefish,2017-06-13 06:55:00,1077,"We heard those rumors also, but could not get hard information, so we decided to give it a shot. The entire road was gravel with workers on a good portion of it. We flew down that road, knowing that there weren't going to be any speed traps. We never knew if the road went through or not, and were sweating that we'd have to turn around and go back.We were towing one of those short U-hauls, brand new, never been used before. By the time we hit the end of that road the plastic hub caps were ripped down to just the rims and the front of the trailer was taken down to bare metal. It sounded like a machine gun with the rocks slamming against it. Ahh, to be young again."

Saw a few shattered trailer fenders on the sides of the road from tires blowing.

The 502 is built over such inhospitable terrain that it's constantly breaking down. Big trucks on the road hauling goods and logs don't help. Don't know if there are weight limits on roads, can't say as I've ever seen a scale. The cost at this point to do what really needs to be done, tear it up, smooth the corners, widen the shoulders and improve drainage would likely shut the road for years, and it really is the only travel route north and south in the whole of the region. Agree, some years better than others, but never completely good."
