Looks like that projects will go on for quite some time. To avoid this and Hwy 502 ( quite a few folks don't like this road) you can take Hwy 11 west out of Fort France's and then pick up Hwy 71 north towards Kenora where you will pick up Hwy 17 east of Kenora. Take 17 east to Hwy 105 north in Vermilion Bay. Folks say this route adds 30 minutes or so from the 502 route.We have always brought our own crawlers over the border as we had around a 7-9 hour drive and didn't have to worry too much about tending them if the drive was really long or required an overnight stay. I'm not sure where to pick them up in Canada.Veggies and other perishables can be picked up in many towns along the route you choose,but not knowing which way you would go makes it a little difficult to give you the best options.Money......conversion can be done at Border Bob's in I-Falls or just hit an ATM in Canada and use your debit card.PjShorthorn"

As far as groceries...Dalseg's in Nestor falls is right on the road ,....nice selection,fresh bakery goods and the y also sell beer and liquor."
5655906,Bill Krejca,2017-07-10 07:55:00,6107,"I like the large grocery store on the right as you enter Emo. Can't miss it, right across from the police and adjacent to the adult beverage outlet. Grocery has plenty of fresh bread and a large selection. Nestor Falls store is also handy. Bill"
5655946,bthomas3333,2017-07-10 08:09:00,465,Hey - Here is what I do. I buy everything in Red Lake proper. Keeps it simple and everything is fresh.TJ's Esso on the right side of the road right in Red Lake sells bait. I normally go with minnows (packed with O2 in bags) but have occasionally picked up flats of worms. No border hassles and good quality bait. I normally call the day before so they have everything ready to roll for my float plane flight in. I call on the way up. Ask for the minnows and worms to be ready at 5a so I can grab and go to the floatplane dock.It has been a few years since I did the shopping in town. My outfitter normally just has me fill out a form with what I want and they shop at West End grocery. I used to shop the IGA also right in Red Lake. It is on the left up above the road as you roll into town (can't see until past it). Also next to the booze store.If you want Lonnies I normally hit a ATM. Before ATMs I used to stop by the bank in Red Lake. Anyway my go to places in Red Lake are:TJ 807 727 2752IGA 807 727 2855West End 807 727 2806Have fun! Fishing in that area is amazing!B-

Not sure if I want to deal with transporting live ones, especially due to airplane and weight limits. Maybe I get some pre-package blood shad etc locally ... just to try something else .."
5656778,outdoorsron,2017-07-10 13:10:00,843,"Hello rzep: Check with your outfitter to see if he can help , sometimes they can get your bait and groceries in camp before you get there. Have a great time. Good Luck . O - R"
5656834,The tank,2017-07-10 13:39:00,340,I usually go west to 71 and than go north. It's 28 miles (about 15-20 minutes) farther. But it's a nice road and a couple of small towns to drive though encase you need something. I've gone up 502 enough in the last 30+ years don't need to go that route anymore.
5657810,martinbns,2017-07-11 06:20:00,1520,That's what I was going to say. Get your stuff fresh and support the local business.
