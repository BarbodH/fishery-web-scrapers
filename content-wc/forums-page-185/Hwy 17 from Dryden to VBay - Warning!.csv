5655826,troutwater,2017-07-10 07:33:00,299,How is 17 east of Dryden? Leave for Huber's in 11 days and now I'm kinda concerned over the construction!
5655842,pjshorthorn,2017-07-10 07:39:00,5654,There was no significant construction on Hwy 17 east of Dryden . How far east of Dyrden are you asking about? I drove 17 to Vermilion Bay all the way from Sault St. Marie . Approximately 1100 km worth of driving PjShorthorn

5655954,troutwater,2017-07-10 08:10:00,299,Awesome thanks! And not that far LOL
5655986,pjshorthorn,2017-07-10 08:22:00,5654,"Good sailing on your trip. The construction on 17 west of Dryden was a pain because of heavy rain and severe rutting. It was much better on the return trip home the following Saturday morning after having been graded and dry. I would guess we were going 45-50 mph. Dependent on the weather, I'm not sure I would take an alternate route to just avoid this one stretch, knowing what I now know after having done it. PjShorthorn"
5656506,Iowa4ND,2017-07-10 11:26:00,35,"We took this route as well this year and it wasn't bad going up but they had done culvert work while we were in camp and there were some rough areas on the way back. I imagine this has since been completed since we came back June 23rd. I think it shaves time off the trip but google maps indicates only a couple minute difference than hitting VB, wonder if anyone else disagrees with google maps trip time difference?"
5656730,port1042,2017-07-10 12:55:00,509,"We gave up on Hwy 502 years ago. Try taking Hwy 11 west out of Fort Frances to Hwy 71 through Nestor Falls to Hwy 17 and east to Vermillion Bay is the way we go all the time. It adds only about 30 miles/minutes to the trip. All very good road and it even has a few places to get gas or food. Pretty drive too! Try it, you'll like it!"
5656946,bearfvr13,2017-07-10 14:43:00,174,"Hello Canadian road makers,......I'm just thankful for any road (no matter how bad it is) that I can be allowed to come into your country and use!!!!! Thank you very much----no complaining here!! See ya next year Canada/Canadians Chuck bearfvr13"
5669314,41jims,2017-07-17 12:25:00,30,Hey I am leaving Indiana on the 21th to head up to Vermillion Bay any update on highway 17 and the construction would be helpful. Thanks
5643089,Carnhzkr,2017-07-02 15:15:00,964,"There was a previous thread regarding the current condition of 502 between Ft Francis and Dryden. If you've read that, you already know to take caution on that stretch, but I wanted to provide ample warning to anyone heading from Dryden to Vermilion Bay. I drove that direction on Saturday, 6/23 and I must say that on that particular day, there was a stretch of about 10 miles that was one of the worst roads I've ever had the misfortune to drive on. It was raining hard at that time, so that probably had a lot to do with the poor (as in horrible) condition.The road was fine at first but where construction began, they'd completely removed all pavement. Being Saturday, there were no workers present. There were no markings of where to drive, just a wide-open expanse of pot holed dirt & tar. Pulling my boat, I had to slow way down for the bumpity, bumpity pot holes and roam from side to side, searching for the smoothest path, which I found only on the eastbound lane. I found the best path was to drive down the eastbound (wrong way) lane until another vehicle approached then I'd slide back to the right. Whenever a truck would pass, it would throw a tidal wave of mud and muck covering my vehicle. I found it hard to believe they could leave Hwy 17 in that condition. That road is the main artery connecting the country. It's like I 80 is in the US. For me, it was a long stretch of white knuckle road. On the return trip, I avoided that stretch altogether by detouring through Eagle River to 502. I don't really advise that though, because that's not the best road either, so ****ed if you do, ****ed if you don't I guess.I just returned home last night and figured that whole experience was now history, but today I went to wash the road grime off my truck and that's when I noticed the entire tailgate and rear bumper was coated with tar. I scrubbed for an hour and have gotten most of it, but I'm afraid to even look underneath. I do use a Tow-Tector and it looks like that may have saved my boat and trailer from most of the damage.Good luck if you're going that way. It may be okay by now, but if I had to do it again, I'd head west through Nestor Falls."
5643153,Carnhzkr,2017-07-02 16:56:00,964,"And if ^^that^^ weren't enough, three times along the stretch between Dryden and V'Bay, there was a deer in front of me running parallel to the road. I'd make eye contact with the deer and could see they were flipping a mental coin in their deer brain to decide if they should dart left to cross the road or right into the trees. Evidently, the coin came up tails each time because no damage was done, but it just added to the white-knuckleness. I was never so glad to make it to V'Bay and turn north to the safety of 105.Good luck if you're heading that way!"
5643561,Stringbean,2017-07-03 07:42:00,279,"I have first hand knowledge of what you're talking about. I drove through there last Saturday afternoon. It was raining and there were 2 ruts in each direction. The mud seemed to be the consistency of mayonnaise and the tires just slung the mud all over. I get home, unhooked the dirty trailer and headed for the car wash. It didn't come off. I unroll the garden hose and spray down the areas with Simple Green. The detergent seems to dissolve the tar under the dirt and with more elbow grease, it finally came off. I still have several spots to redo later."
5643713,pjshorthorn,2017-07-03 09:45:00,5654,"We drove the same section of Hwy 17 on Saturday June 24 around 2 pm. It was pouring and the section of road was in poor condition in both directions. There were two road graders working to smooth out the ruts in both directions ,but as fast as they leveled the road, semis and other vehicular traffic just caused ruts again. We drove the same stretch on Saturday July 1st and the road was fairly smooth with no major ruts. The road was compacted from traffic and without any significant rain in the prior couple of days, it was in reasonable shape. We weren't pulling a boat and it was a pain to navigate during the heavy rainstorm. PjShorthorn"
5643729,btyreprich,2017-07-03 10:02:00,1067,"We drive up to Ear Falls on August 5th and I'll travel this route. To those Walleye Central members living in this part of Ontario, might you know when the road work will be finished on Hwy 17? I hate going on highway 502 but will consider it people keep on posting imilr experiences on Highway 17. Taking the wife's truck and she's pretty particular on the condition of her car. I can and do clean out big splats but tar and chips in paint are a different set of problems."
5644665,Skywagon,2017-07-03 19:24:00,1106,"My wife drove that stretch of road that Saturday, she was not a happy camper after discovering all the tar on her Ridgeline. She had to wax the whole truck to get the gunk off (I was fishing, otherwise would have been more than happy to have waxed it for her ).I have not heard when the completion date is anticipated."
5644961,pjshorthorn,2017-07-04 05:42:00,5654,"I spoke with some Vermilion Bay residents while visiting last week and they indicated the project has been going on for possibly as long as two months. Their confidence in the road being completed anytime soon was pretty low, but they didn't know for sure. My BIL was hoping it would be done by the time we were heading home.....I told him there was no way that would happen . I asked him if the road was in Ohio would it be done in a week ? He said no way would it be done PjShorthorn"
5653698,NWwalleye,2017-07-09 05:59:00,223,"As a local who has to travel Hwy 17 several time a week ( or who use to !! ). I would recommend taking Hwy 594 to Eagle River and connect to Hwy 17 past the construction .. OR .... If you are heading North on Hwy 502 , turn off at Ogibawa Drive and travel to Hwy594 to Eagle river. There is construction happening on Hwy 594 as well, not nearly as bad as Hwy17. Taking Ogibawa Drive will detour you around all construction . Just be prepared as this road is narrow and has more curves .."
5654186,bus33,2017-07-09 11:41:00,289,This is the route we take off of 502 to get to 17 then to 105 to Ear Falls. It does shave some time off and is a pretty little stretch of road.
5655722,law57,2017-07-10 07:06:00,1147,"Here's some information from Ontario Ministries... As NW walleye said, it might be best to bypass the construction on Hwy 17 - via Eagle River. Go slow and enjoy the trip thru Ontario. 502 is a beautiful drive - especially in the fall. http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...hwestern.shtmlhttp://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...tract2016-6270"
