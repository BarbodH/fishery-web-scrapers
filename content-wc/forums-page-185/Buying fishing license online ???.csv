5663106,Guest,2017-07-13 15:52:00,0,"Actually, buying on line costs an additional 2.26 service fee."
5663114,Wedge,2017-07-13 15:53:00,270,That is still way cheaper than paying a lodge for it in American. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
5663130,Guest,2017-07-13 16:01:00,0,huh? So that's what deerlake meant? You have telepathy I guess. And the lodge is charging you $10 more than they should. I see. Not very nice of them. That just doesn't make sense but that must be what deerlake meant. It happens to everyone too.
5663146,Guest,2017-07-13 16:02:00,0,"Bought my license in May for end of June trip. Cost was $55.80 Canadian, put it on my Visa card when the bill game the cost to me was $41 and some cents. Saved almost $15 - back then the dollar was worth $1.35, now its down to $1.28."
5663154,Wedge,2017-07-13 16:06:00,270,"First off, only a pu$5y posts under an unregistered account. Troll moron. Second, yes many of the lodges charge you $53 American, but if you purchase online, you will pay $55 Canadian (with service fee). That is $42 American. From the $53 that was mentioned, it is safe to assume he meant that for the $10. Idiot. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"

5663890,Obabikon,2017-07-14 05:41:00,2370,"For the record... I charge in US. 8 Day sports have been $40 US most of the year. I just recently bumped it up to $43 US, so I wasn't losing money on the transaction. Maybe some resorts over charge for the licenses, but that would be illegal. I personally don't think making a couple extra bucks per license is worth the consequences if caught. As a registered license issuer, you are directed to charge what the MNR tells you to charge."
5662634,Plotman,2017-07-13 12:32:00,394,"I am looking at buying our Ontario fishing licences online ahead of our departure however, I cannot seem to find the answer if I am able to specify the start/stop dates on the 8 day license or, does it start automatically as soon as the purchase is made online? The info on the site says I must print immediately or save for later but, I will not have access to a printer once I leave home.I want all 8 days the license provides and do not want to waste a day of it while I am making the drive up. Anybody know the answer??"
5662666,Wedge,2017-07-13 12:51:00,270,You specify the first day of the license on the site and it auto-fills the last daySent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
5662674,Wedge,2017-07-13 12:53:00,270,"Also print it right away for everyone. I also made PDF copies so we could re-print if needed. They do not email them and they are not re-printable on their site, so just be prepared when u purchase it. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
5662762,troutwater,2017-07-13 13:29:00,299,"X2 It works great, bought mine a few months ago for my trip next week. I also saved it as a PDF in case I lose it or something."
5662818,Fishin Fun,2017-07-13 13:42:00,218,"I've been using the online system for about 3 years now. I love it. But yes, make sure you print it off right away. My father-in-law didn't do that thinking he was going to get it sent to him. Then he forgot about it until we made it to camp and then had to buy another one."
5662826,Baseline,2017-07-13 13:49:00,3207,You may need to buy an outdoor card with your license if you never had one or the one you have is more than 3 years old. You will have to print the card and license. A plastic outdoor card will be mailed. I put a copy of the license on my desktop and can print a copy if it is ever necessary. I also have a copy of the license on my phone.
5663058,Guest,2017-07-13 15:37:00,0,"I print three copies of license-right away when prompted on the site. One goes in passport, one in tackle box and one in wallet. You save money by buying online at home with the exchange rate. The exchange rate is not as good as earlier this year but you would still save over $10 per license."
5663074,law57,2017-07-13 15:44:00,1147,Yes - print it right away. A PDF copy is a good idea - email it to yourself so it can be printed from any library computer if you are away from home. The expiration date of my Outdoor card was past. But the number on it was still valid. I think I re-upped it last year. They didn't send me a new card but the old one worked as it has the same number. Just another FYI.
5663082,Guest,2017-07-13 15:47:00,0,oh oh. here we go. How does one save $10? The price is 53.54 on line or at the bait shop.
5663090,Wedge,2017-07-13 15:49:00,270,"Well the lodges charge you in American, but then pay for them in Canadian. I don't know if bait shops do that. You do get the most up to date conversion by buying online. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
