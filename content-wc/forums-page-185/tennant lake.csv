When we go up to Tennant we usually fish the incoming river mouth and up the river and catch a lot of nice fish. As far as pike go someone in our group usually catches an over 40"" with a lot of fish in the mid 30's I have also fished Kayedon and it was good but my choice would be Kap, Tennant, Melchett and do not forget the little lake called Tester which you access from the river headed to Melchett from Kap this makes for a fun day exploring and fishing. River mouth's both ends of Tennant River mouth into Kap River mouth into Melchett Island's in the middle of Kap Neck down on Kap 3/4 way to river to Melchett all great spots No live bait needed just plastic's for walleye and spoons and spinner baits for pike ""pink"" Jig 1/4-3/8 with white paddle tail's Good luck"
