5659410,emma17,2017-07-11 16:53:00,436,"My sons and wife will be disappointed to find out that their biggest fish don't count since I drove the boat, found the spot, bought the bait and the poles, and who knows, maybe suggested a jig weight. It seems this thread has gotten off track into a battle of what people should like and not like. Why is it necessary for any poster to comment on Jigger's preferred Canadian Walleye trip? Is it petty jealousy that he can afford such a trip? Holy cow you'd think Jigger paid his guides to encroach on your favorite spots. By the way, given the amount of times Jigger has been up to SWW, isn't it likely he could hop in a boat alone and find good spots- maybe even with his own fishing pole? Jigger, my wife is a great fisher woman but unfortunately has some dexterity issues, requiring me to fix and bait her line while maintaining boat control. I would love to have a guide in the boat to help out. And when we return from a full day of fishing I'd love to have someone prepare our meals for us so that we have more time to enjoy Canada and each other's company."
5659874,NLpike,2017-07-12 00:29:00,28,"Well Emma, if they are going to be that disappointed then you probably shouldn't tell them. Or maybe you can teach them where to go on a lake depending on wind and sun; what lures or bait to use; what kind of presentations are best for different times of the year. Then the next time, ask them ""where do you want to fish?"" My guess is they already have an opinion and would be happy to participate in the process of hunting fish. If you fell that you can compare fishing with your family with paying a guide to take you to a spot, hook the bait and tell you what to do then I think you aren't teaching your family. Life is a life lesson. Don't miss it."
5660410,emma17,2017-07-12 09:05:00,436,"It seems like this is an all or nothing issue to you. Or perhaps you've had a horrible guide experience? My kids have learned from me, and they have learned from guides- the best of both worlds I'd imagine. Surely you don't imagine that every day of fishing we've had as a family involved a guide in the boat- do you? Surely you don't imagine my sons (20 and 21) need the guide to put a minnow on their hook do you? Surely you don't imagine that my sons weren't curious why the guide took them to the wavy side of the shore line do you? My life lesson is this: Balance is the key."
5661610,Timing,2017-07-12 21:24:00,95,"Right on forums are to share information, tell stories and help others. Number or size of fish are just part of the experience for me. Hanging out, sharing stories, eating, naps, playing cards, talking smart and tipping a few beverages are more important than size and quantity of fish. Of course do love to brag if caught big fish of the day..."
5661962,Northpoint,2017-07-13 07:26:00,38,Thanks to all of your comments and suggestions I now have a reservation for next opening day and the week following on LS. Finally decided to stick with the fully guided and full meal plan for another couple of years. This exercise has shown me that there are lots of options out there to consider. Good luck to all of you for the rest of the summer!!
5645449,Skywagon,2017-07-04 11:59:00,1106,"If I did not live here and was in need of a camp to fish out of, Silver Water Wheels would be by far my first choice. As always you get what you pay for, this camp produces what we are looking for."
5648049,Aspencreek,2017-07-05 18:08:00,2911,"Jigger, Good for you, you have the socioeconomic circumstances to afford going to SWW. But you are also under the impression that your most recent results are something special, it is not, and NOT by a long shot. By your numbers that is an average of only 14-15 over 18"" per day per guy. By our standards that is really SLOW! And your results with over slot fish is also pretty pedestrian. Let me give you an example; 1 boat, my brother and I, started fishing at 8am, by noon when the wind blew us off the mid lake hump, we had boated 72 ALL over 18"" and most between 23 and 26"", with 6 at 27, 4 at 28"" and 2 at 29+"", but no 30. That was 1 boat 1/2 day. We don't keep track of exact numbers for our group for the week but if it's not close to 50-60 per day it is considered slow and we have had several 100+ days. I have not stayed at SWW but my BIL has on 2 other occasions and now he goes with us. His reasons are simple, at least 1/3 the cost, nicer cabins, and we fish where we want to not where the guide takes us."
5648337,Jigger1,2017-07-05 20:24:00,234,Congrats on your success Aspen. Those are the days memories are made of.
5648721,tv4fish,2017-07-06 05:49:00,2694,"Aspencreek - I'm with you 100%. After having fished Lac Seul for many years (like 30+) - a huge part of the fun is catching a bunch and bigger walleyes ""on our own"" (as in not guided) and on our own schedule. Kind of nice getting a ""master angler"" award now and then."
5649793,prov1800,2017-07-06 13:00:00,5010,"tough to get bookings on lac suel.check out lac suel lodge,onaway lodge and fishermans cove,all great camps and the fishing in there area is just as good as anywhere else on the lake.i know cause ive fished it every where.just fished it for 4 days days and it was awesome.with plenty of fish in all sizes.all these camps are within a 1/2 hr of Manitoba point but you wouldn't need to go that far to catch fish.fish within 5 minutes of any of these camps."
5650569,rather-be-fishin,2017-07-06 22:31:00,429,AGREE!!! 15 days & counting down to our 13th year of fishing Lac Suel out of Scout Bay Area!!! Can't wait! üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£ RBF. üòé
5651618,I Wire Em,2017-07-07 13:42:00,16,Well said Jigger 1 You are right on about SWWL !!! <*((()))<>
5656554,Northpoint,2017-07-10 11:36:00,38,"Another huge price difference is the decision that many make to not use a guide. The rental of the boat and motor and services of the guide and tip add a fair amount to what is a reasonable price. I have owned and sold some nice boats because they simply did not get used enough and thus can choose to buys another boat, rent a boat and risk damaging the motor or hire a guide or fish on the dock. I have opted to use a guide because that means I get to enjoy fishing more and not net and bait and unhook the fish for my wife. For me it has been money very well spent not to have to run the motor and stay on the spot and do everything else the guide does. (It's so easy to take that all that work for granted until you encounter the reality of doing it for yourself.) I was once young like many of you and enjoyed the challenges and the hunt. In fact, even with a guide, I enjoy the hunt a bit.....like knowing one particular sand point will be staked with smaller walleyes at dusk or that another bay is great in early spring. I have never been disappointed with the results and one three day trip stands out where we caught 40 walleyes over 24 on a corner of a sand bar in the middle of nowhere. I would have stood a very small chance of even drifting over the spot once let alone staying on it. Catching two 29"" walleyes and a 41"" northern on other trips would have never happened.....and didn't happen in over 40 years of being my own guide. The relationship between the guide and the customer has to be a huge risk for the guide. I just read a article title ""Why your guide hates you"" in a magazine and I must say the picture painted could have been me. All of the above factors into the decision on cost.....which many have focused on in this thread. For now I just need a resort with a long dock where I can toss out a slip bobber and sit in a comfy chair with my food and pop nearby."
5657034,Jigger1,2017-07-10 15:18:00,234,"Northpoint great post and was very similar to the one I had been thinking about. I certainly didn't mean to turn this into a competition, it was not the intent of my original post. I had intended to simply provide prospective from a different vantage point and one I feel strongly about as I'm sure everyone does regarding their particular Canadian trip. I no longer own a boat, sold it over a decade ago when we moved south and haven't looked back. The boats at SWWL are fantastic to fish out of and I have no ownership responsibility, so I love them even more. The guides, these guys aren't just guides, they're fishermen who really love what they are doing and I'm proud to call many of them my friends over the years. Their professionalism and demeanor are a direct result of the Willems ownership and their commitment to excellence at their lodge. Regarding results, I guess it's primarily determined by what your fishing goals are. My goals are not to catch as many fish as possible in any given day. My daily goals are to see how many over 27 I can put in the boat and to beat my personal best. I have had 100+ fish days, in fact pretty sure I had one on June 17 this year topping out at 27.5, we had 45 on the sheets by 9:30am and it was a double and triple fest. The next day was a slower day with an ultralight bite but I caught 4 over 27 so it was a blast. On any given trip, you can experience exceptional days and then there are grinder days, weather being a primary factor. My overall comments are that I'm simply blown away by the productivity while targeting large walleyes, not volume, out of SWWL. I also don't believe there's any difference between catching a fish of a lifetime with or without a guide, it's still you hooking and catching the fish. I use a guide so I can do one thing enhance my odds of beating my personal best and catching another fish of a lifetime. And in the process, I don't worry about boat control, I don't worry about staying on a contour or structure, I don't worry about anything, I just fish. Combine this together and I think SWWL is hard to beat. But to each his own, we're all on this site because of our love of catching walleyes, where, how, when and why we catch them is all up to the individual and personal choice. Glad to hear the passion behind your trips, wishing you all great success this season, back up in a few more weeks for round #2."
5657642,NLpike,2017-07-11 00:28:00,28,"I 100% agree, but I only fish with very seasoned people. We also have our own boats we want to use. We also don't go in for lunch. We pack sandwiches, shore-lunch on beaches and just fish through the hunger if we have nothing. We also make our own dinner and our own schedule.I don't have any issues with people who don't have a boat or don't know how to find the big girls on their own, but I also don't really count those pictures of people in guide boats holding 29"" walleye. Those people were taken to a spot, given a rod and were able to real in a fish."
5590929,Northpoint,2017-06-05 11:05:00,38,I am used to fishing a nice resort in the southern end of Lac Seul and toward the middle. Unfortunately the resort is small and if you don't stay the same time every year if becomes difficult to find open slots. I am very near retirement and need to find someplace to go for two weeks at a time. When we retire we would be open to doing some of our own cooking and fishing without a guide. I would like to find information about places between Manitobia Point and Vaughn Lake. Chances for fishing this summer/fall appear very limited at this point. Suggestions would be much appreciated for next summer. Thanks!!
5591041,Pooch,2017-06-05 11:33:00,4618,"There are a couple camps nearer to Vaughn than Manitoba Point. The only one who's name I know is Mahkwa and it has housekeeping and American. There is a very nice operation called Silver Water Wheel that is about midway between Manitoba Pt. and Vaughn, but they are only American Plan that I'm aware of.In reality there are very few camps in the area you speak of. Or at least I can't find them.What small camp are you talking about that you have stayed at?Pooch"
5591273,MikeMcC,2017-06-05 12:57:00,72,Black Bay Outpost via Lac Seul Lodge but filled up most of the time.
5591513,Aspencreek,2017-06-05 14:02:00,2911,"Silver water wheel is American plan only and guided only if I recall. Pricey too! Pooch is right, there are almost none in that area, which makes it pretty remote. There are 4 camps up lake toward Ear falls that are all nice, Onaway, Scout Lake, Lac Seul lodge and Fisherman's cove, but you may find yourself in the same boat with reservations. These camps don't have to advertise much and have a great deal of repeat customers every year. It is a good boat ride to manitoba pt from each one but there is also great fishing closer to the camps, plus access to McKenzie bay is also easier."
5594817,Steve Ediger,2017-06-06 19:50:00,97,"Lac Seul Lodge is close to the area you are looking for. My wife and I have been going there for two weeks in June the last 17 years. This is my first year of retirement and am fortunate enough to make four trips this year. The camp is modern, clean, with top notch equipment. If you can, stop in and let Rod and Lorita show you around. I bet you would really enjoy a stay there. The camp is about 12 miles south of Ear Falls. Steve"
5595969,dan cardinal,2017-06-07 13:37:00,64,"I would recommend Williams lake Lodge...access to Lac Seul at Williams Bay. Nice camp... adequate cabins... great equipment. Kathy and Ken run a good camp. It would be closet in proximity to Black Bay. We typically fish the Williams Bay area and the main basin south of Manitoba Point. Likely could get a reservation here mid to late August or early Sept. It would be worth contacting Kathy... sometimes they will have a party cancel, making a cabin available in July. August is when we go. Always have great success on the walleye."
5596033,Northpoint,2017-06-07 14:23:00,38,Thank you for your responses!! A couple of you mentioned SWW and so I have to add a couple of comments about them. We have stayed at SWW several times and found the amount charged to be a bargain. I realize some can do it cheaper and I respect that. I have also compared other places where the base rate appears to be cheaper until you add in the extra's for gas and bait that SWW builds into a base rate. My issue is that SWW (like lots of other places) has few cabins that are designed for only two people and if you have one of those coveted spots you dare not change much between years as you want to be locked in. If you have a bigger group I would highly recommend SWW as our fishing has been nothing short of spectacular over the years. With retirement looming I need to find that place I can go stay for several weeks next year and into the future.
5598449,Aspencreek,2017-06-08 21:42:00,2911,"I understand that if you want a guided, and American plan and have the where with all to pay for it great. I don't, Part of the experience for me and my group is that finding fish is part of the adventure, I will not leave fish just because the dinner bell is ringing, and we cook our own food, and we eat REALLY well (and not fish every night or sandwiches for lunch). And we pay WAY less than SWW and are in better cabins than SWW. The boats at SWW are awesome but they better be when you have 3 and 4 people fishing out of them. Don't get me wrong to each their own, if you think it's a bargain great, but I'm paying less than 1/3 for a full week and the most I've ever gone over the included minnows, and gas allowance was by $50.I am also on Lac Seul and while fishing certain spots have had the boys from SWW show up with their clients, they have always been respectful and give everybody their space, but I'm on the same water."
5598865,Larry S,2017-06-09 08:00:00,665,"For me going to SWW is Way Too Expensive. If you like having it all done for you Fine Spending $2,700 plus tax for 5 days to fish with 3 people plus a guide in one boat is a little too crowded for me. If you want to only fish with 2 people plus a guide then the cost goes up to $ 3,350 plus tax I enjoy hunting for fish and eating whenever I want ,not following a schedule every day I can pay for 2 to 3 weeks at an excellent lake for what SWW people pay!"
5645321,Jigger1,2017-07-04 10:13:00,234,"I respect each person's thoughts and their decisions for a fishing trip as we all have different and unique socioeconomic circumstances but here's the view from a long term SWWL guest and while the price may be more than others I doubt the productivity can be matched. This year our group of six spent six days in mid-June and we put 532 walleyes over 18¬î on the sheets with 149 of them exceeding 24¬î. That's 60-4's, 42-5's, 29-6's, 12-7's, 4-8's and two 9's topping out at 29.25 this trip. Weather was unsettled, cool and wet yet we found and caught fish for most of the trip. As said by others, no offense, but I spent the earlier years of my life finding or hunting for fish whenever I want, catching an inordinate number of smalls, not following a schedule, cooking our own food now I spend 9 quality hours a day doing nothing but fishing big walleyes with a remarkable success rate and it seems every year catching another fish of a lifetime. It's a very special place, run by fantastic owners on an unbelievable body of water. And for my dollar, I believe the productivity of the SWWL system outproduces anything I could do on my own by a mile and has remained that way for the last 18 years. Hope I can continue for the next 18 years which is what started this dialog in the first place. Best of luck Northpoint, hope you find a great spot."
