5662250,Los Pollos Hermanos,2017-07-13 09:42:00,10,"I am heading up through Dryden next Friday. As I am in Michigan frequently, my kids have found the Tim Hortons Canadian experience as joyful as I. We don't have Tim's in the Chicago area yet. Now I really want them to experience Canada at it's best.....with an artery clogging Poutine lunch!! Even though I have shown them pictures on the internet, they think I am making up this meal. ""Gravy and cheese curds on fries?"" Yes, and add some vinegar to it as well!!! What is the best place in Dryden to get this treat?"
5662298,Guest,2017-07-13 10:06:00,0,Swing on over to Quebec. You go to the Casse-cro√ªte to get real poutine.
5662354,Los Pollos Hermanos,2017-07-13 10:23:00,10,I mapped it. It adds 1500 miles (or 2414 km) to my drive. Is it worth it? Kids will just have to suck it up if you say it is worth it.

5662474,Ricky Spanish,2017-07-13 11:08:00,1298,"x2 Buster's was the best food I've had on my fishing trips, but my Canadian cuisine experiences are very limited. The lodge has great cooks, who make fine meals, but to please a large group of guests, there's never anything too ""exciting"". I'd never heard of poutine before I tried it there."
5662546,martinbns,2017-07-13 11:46:00,1520,"I have yet to see an impressive looking poutine in NW Ontario, the closest I have seen to what I would classify that way was at the Lake of the Woods Brewing company in Kenora. But even that after living in the francophone part of New Brunswick for three years hasn't prompted me to order it."
5663282,Skywagon,2017-07-13 17:15:00,1106,"As a Dryden area local, I highly recommend the Twin Towers restaurant (less than 10 miles east of Dryden on the Trans-Canada highway 17 on the south side). They have something what they call Towering Taters, it will fulfill all your Poutine needs, very good and will fill your arteries."
5663306,Mike Borger,2017-07-13 17:22:00,1554,"As an aside, the proper pronunciation is ""poot-sin"". In some locales it's pronounced ""poon-sin"", and in some places it's called ""poon-tang"".Finding quality poon-tang in Dryden is next to impossible."
5663322,fishron,2017-07-13 17:35:00,317,"I recommend you ask Octanehi5 for his recipe. Ron showed up with a huge tray of Poutine at one of our shared walleye exchange shore lunches on lake Hebert. If I didn't have a heart after that meal, I'm probably going to live to 100."
5663402,Blue Lk,2017-07-13 18:30:00,269,Kokooms Bannock Shop in Dryden has Great Poutine & their Bannock burgers are also excellent!
