5658154,mrpike24,2017-07-11 08:35:00,54,"Shoal is an awesome area to fish, beautiful scenery, very few houses/pressure, and great fishing. I've been heading down there the past 5 years or so.....The walleye definitely seemed to be at a peak when we first started going and has seemed to drop off each and every year since I started fishing down there. We typically are out casting swimbaits or other soft plastics looking for pike/smallmouth on windblown shorelines/points/reefs. We know **** well we are going to run into our far share of walleye as well. The first year we encountered tons of upper 20"" with 2 or 3 at the 30"" mark but everything seems to be down to mid 20""'s at best now with the volume of fish down considerably as well. WE have also seen a decrease in size on the Pike and have seen a fair share of musky and boated one over the past couple years. In talking with a couple of the guysin the area, it sounds like there has been a forage (Smelt primarily) crash that attributes to the number/quality going down, as we have seen much skinnier fish when we do get them to bite. I would still consider the fishing good but definitely not ""world class"" like it would have been when we first started making the trip through the rapids. Anyone else have any insight on the fishing down there as of late? We also don't see near as many guide boats heading down every morning like previous years which tells me the same thing."
5658898,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-11 12:37:00,124,"What we may be witnessing is not so much a natural decline in the forage fish that the game /predator fish rely on but rather an overabundance of Walleye due to the 30+ year fishing closure for that species.The natural state of the ecosystem has been put out of balance due to forage fish competition as a result of extremely high Walleye populations in Shoal Lake and surrounding waters on LOW.There is a fine line between what the bait fish populations can supply as food to not only the Walleye population but also all the other competing species of fish such as Muskie, Pike, SM Bass and Lake Trout.So, what eventually happens is a noticeable decrease in the population of Walleye due to natural die off because of malnutrition.This would also explain why you have been experiencing less Walleye being caught with each successive trip along with noticing that the fish look thin and or unhealthy.This is why I would support an open season to some degree which would act as a sort of cull to decreae the Walleye population to a more sustainable healthy number.Also, the average life span of a trophy female Walleye for those waters is 12 to 15 years and any fish falling in the 30 plus inch range would most likely fall in that category.If we consider that the season has been closed for 30+ years then we are also experiencing the second generation of trophy size Walleye that spawn in that area coming to an end since the ban for that species.We witnessed this same scenario happen in the Kenora area with the Whitetail Deer and Black Bear populations.The female deer were over protected by decreasing the number of hunting tags for many years which eventually resulted in an explosion of the deer population. It was great if you were a Deer hunter but Moose in the area could not compete with the Deer for food and were pushed out of the area by the over abundance of Whitetail.So, to find the Moose we would have to travel quite a bit farther north as the years went by.This situation still exists today as many may notice when visiting that portion of Northwestern, Ontario.There is a Deer on almost every street corner in town and also many standing by the roadside on the highways.There was a time not too long ago where you could harvest 7 Whitetail every hunting season but would have to purchase 7 individual tags to do so as the MNR was trying to put balance back into the wildlife management units.Same thing happened with the Black Bear population back in the 1990's.The Ontario Provincial Government decided to close the spring Bear hunt due to an outcry by some southern Ontario animal city activist groups who know nothing about what goes on in the north.In just 5 short years the Bear population exploded and in around 1996 we had Bears roaming the streets of Kenora like stray dogs and cats.During that year alone over 400 Bears were live trapped in town and taken back into the wilderness.However, many would return to the point where they would have to be destroyed.The problem was that the sows were beginning to den and give birth to their cubs within the green pockets of the town.Then the cubs would learn the behaviour taught by the mother of finding their food source in dumpsters and garbage cans.I experienced this more than once during that time as a couple of Bears liked to make a stop in my backyard occasionally going after my garbage pail in the shed.They would literally use their paws to peel back the panels on my aluminum shed like a banana peel and grab the garbage bags before I could put them on the road for the weekly disposal pick-up,Unfortunately once man starts poking his fingers in the natural state of things you can be assured something will be put off balance to some degree."
5652026,Further North,2017-07-07 20:37:00,2008,"That will not be any kind of problem for this fisherman...I target pike, musky and smallies...if I trip over a walleye, it is what it is.I am delighted to see aggressive management practices like that though. Shows long term thinking that will benefit the resource.I fished some other lakes in Ontario where the same sort of management was in place...and while we didn't target them...the size of the walleyes we encountered was impressive."
5652266,martinbns,2017-07-08 05:52:00,1520,"Just a note on the CO's on the water, we were stopped and searched a few weeks ago on the route into Poplar Bay and they asked us if we had the receipt for our minnows. Not law yet, but they said it was probably going to be."
5653226,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-08 17:56:00,124,"Yes they do, I have two friends that are CO's in that area.I also worked for the MNR out of Kenora during the mid 80's to 90's.You are right, if it can be proven that someone is intentionally targeting Walleye then you are in a heap of hurt by the CO's.However, due to the Walleye fishery being so productive in Shoal Lake and just east on the lake on LOW it is simply impossible not to accidentally hook into a large Walleye while fishing for Muskie, Pike, Bass or Whitefish.When that happens take a quick picture and release the fish immediately and if a CO happens to be watching you from a distance they will not approach or charge you. A friend of mine owns and operates a camp just around the corner from Shoal Lake and he gives each of his guests instructions of what to do if accidentally hooking into a Walleye as it happens almost daily when his guests are fishing for all legal species.Perhaps they should consider charging the Walleye for taking the bait as an illegal angling species, LOL,"
5653514,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-08 21:19:00,447,I have a trip to Shoal booked for Sept and have been wondering about picture taking if we catch a nice walleye. Seems that a CO could interpret keeping a fish long enough for a picture as not being an immediate release if he/she wanted to.
5653602,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-09 01:36:00,124,"From the time you net the fish to the time it takes you to take it from the net and shoot a photo should be no more than a few minutes,... you'll be within a reasonable amount of time and their will be no concern,... I've done it much more than once when fishing that area.An example would be when my son and I where fishing for Muskie and a 33"" Walleye with a 16"" girth weighing 15lbs hit a 10"" black bucktail.That fish was measured while still in the water in the net, not taken out until the camera was ready by me to take the photo and the scale ready to weigh it.The entire process took only a few minutes tops before that fish was released and back swimming in the lake.That is a reasonable amount of time and no CO will even entertain the thought of pursuing to charge you with any infraction of the fishing regulations,... they are looking for much bigger fish to fry in terms of those who are intentionally poaching.It just can't be helped that the occasional Walleye will take your bait while fishing for other species in that area.If the MNR was overly concerned about the fact that this happens much to often they would just close angling in that area all together,... but there is too much at stake when taking the tourism dollars into consideration.Actually, I am somewhat baffled that the MNR has not already opened even a partial Walleye season with reduced limits in Shoal Lake and the adjacent LOW waters considering how much the Walleye fishery has improved after being close for more than 30 years."
5653610,Thompmd,2017-07-09 02:26:00,320,"Curious, generically what percentage of people do you/CO's believe are either illegally keeping walleye? I realize the percentage is likely much larger than they actually catch. Just wandering. Do you/CO's also believe that guests staying at local camps close to Shoal Lake stay there so they can target the Walleyes?"
5654930,kayakmatt,2017-07-09 19:38:00,105,"Our fishing guide at Crow Rock whom used to guide Shoal Lake said if the they open walleye fishing to recreation / sport fishing, then they would also then have to open it to First Nations netting. So, given that choice, they think it is best to keep the total ban to ALL walleye fishing. He said the walleye populations had been decimated in the past when netting was allowed in Shoal."
5655130,martinbns,2017-07-09 21:30:00,1520,Most of the land access to Shoal is through a couple of First Nations.
5657186,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-10 17:22:00,124,"The anglers who may be intentionally targeting Walleye and keeping them are a small minority as explained to me by CO""s I know working that area and probably amount to less than 10% who fish that area.Anyone would be a **** fool to try and get away with fishing for and keeping walleye in Shoal Lake and south of Ash Rapids in that area of LOW as it is patrolled heavily by the MNR.As you may know if anyone is caught poaching say good-bye to your boat, vehicle, fishing privileges and a large portion of your savings account.Guests staying at camps close to Shoal Lake are specifically educated by the camp owners as to the Walleye regulations in that area as their business can be literally shut down if the CO's suspect illegal angling practices.I have a friend who owns a camp just around the corner from Shoal Lake on LOW and even though I have fished those waters while staying at his camp many times and when living in Kenora he always makes a quick mention to me of the closed Walleye season just so I am aware that the regulations have not changed from year to year. Bottom line is read the Fishing Regulations and know exactly what the rules are for the Shoal Lake and surrounding areas on LOW because I can assure anyone out their if caught with Walleye in their possession by a CO he or she will not accept the excuse of ignorance with regards to the annual Ontario Fishing Regulations.I have witnessed anglers and camp owners charged with poaching fish, small game and big game in the past and watched people lose their business and possessions over it in some cases. Also, many years ago in Kenora the MNR would a hold an annual auction of possessions that were confiscated from poachers and sold to the highest bidder.I and many others would benefit greatly by paying very reduced prices on rifles, fishing gear, boats, motors, trailers and even small fixed wing aircraft occasionally if one was interested.I also watched some of the poachers try to by back some of their confiscated items and be very disappointed when another bidder would snatch it right from under their noses,... for a second time."
5657242,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-10 17:54:00,124,"True that the Walleye fishery had been decimated due to commercial fishing in Shoal Lake.However, 30 years has passed since the season was closed to all Walleye angling and the population has now exploded making it almost impossible not to accidentally catch these fish while angling for other species in that area.It would make perfect sense to me and many others if they allowed the Aboriginal people on the Shoal Lake Reserve to fish for an annual set quota of Walleye and have it regulated by either the Provincial Government MNR department or the Federal Government Fisheries and Oceans department and also make it at least a one catch limit for anglers by special tag purchase or at least a strictly catch and release policy for anglers. In Clearwater Bay which is just north of Shoal Lake the MNR had closed the Lake Trout season for I think what was 15 years to allow the numbers to regenerate.When it was reopened a special tag system was put in place to allow anglers to catch and posses one fish but that one fish now can be of trophy proportions.It seems to be working fine by still protecting and maintaining a healthy Lake Trout population for that area.Any angler can also fish for Clearwater Bay Lake Trout with a single barbless hook when holding a Sport or Conservation fishing licence but the possession limit still remains at zero."
5642313,Thompmd,2017-07-02 02:22:00,320,"We just returned yesterday from a 6/23-30 stay. We have been going almost every year since 2004 but first year at this particular area and all our trips were in June.Water temps were 63-65Lots of Rain(weatherman in Kenora said on the radio as we left that this was the last day of the ""June-monsoon"". Resort said the month had been cool/wet in general. The lake appeared to me to be down about 12-15"". Water clarity was about 10' which I thought was pretty clear. We had no trouble running the rapids into Shoal Lake. We did see law enforcement drive into Shoal one day, I assume checking people.Fishing for my wife/I(and our dog) was better during early mornings/late evenings or during the rain/wind. There was a good early bite for smallmouth on a strike king spit-n-image(think the color was sexy shad) and I have to say there is nothing more for than catching smallmouth on topwater!! There were a few(very few) still on beds but they are done and a few fry-guarders around. The majority of our fish were caught in 10' or less and mostly on boulder shorelines but a surprisingly number came on shale banks and this historically hasn't been the case for us. Virtually no fish were caught on laydowns/weeds. Besides the spit-n-image we also caught them on small jigs, crawdad colored crankbaits,white or chartreuse 3/8oz spinnerbaits, rattletraps. Our largest smallmouth I doubt would have weighed 4lb but lots of what I call nice 2-3lb fish.Northern we caught mostly on 1/2-3/4 tandem spinnerbaits with a few mixed in on larger 3/4 rattle-trap type baits and spoons. We had no trouble catching Pike mostly 24-30"" and our largest was a 40"" and I'm guessing 18-20lb? The larger fish preferred the deeper edges of the bays out past where you could visibly see weeds.Muskies, we didn't catch any and only saw one follow and actually didn't hear anyone in camp mention any.Walleyes, we didn't target them but caught them up to about 23-24"". We only caught about 10 all week. We caught them on the above mentioned baits just randomly casting so I'm not much help. From speaking to the other guys in camp they said they were catching them in 12-20'.We stayed for the 1st time at Ash Rapids Lodge and they were great. We are definitely low mtce customers but both Andrew/Tannis were great for anything we asked/needed. We were on the housekeeping plan but did go up for breakfast 1-morning which was great and judging from the other guests that were on the American plan their boats seemed to move a little slower each day and I'm sure it was from all of the excellent food. I did hire a guide Shane for a day to take me into Shoal to show me around and to learn a little about the area and he too was great. I have only hired a 1/2-dozen guides or so in my life but was surprised that Shane didn't bring a rod to fish(at his request). This was perfectly fine and we had a great time and Shane drove my boat and ran the trolling motor. BTW, I tried to continue this rest of the week with my wife driving the boat and running the trolling motor while I fished but that didn't stick? Shane did show me a new technique I had never used and has really opened my eyes up but out of respect to him I won't mention it. Did see them towing in a boat one day that had hit a reef and tore off a lower unit so PLEASE be careful. Both LOTW/Shoal are very dangerous. Just driving in the ""middle"" of the lake doesn't even begin to mean you are safe. Last year at Crow Rock I was fishing a reef in the ""middle"" of the lake and noticed something ""shiny"" and when I trolled over it was a lower unit that is now sitting by my burn-ring at home as a talking piece. BE CAREFUL.Gas in Kenora was $111.9 liter. I'm sure I will think of a couple things but I wanted to get this out there and if you have more questions let me know or PM.Goodluck to all"

5642617,Rich B,2017-07-02 08:02:00,1081,"Appreciate your comments on the fishing, the camp and one's safety out on the water. Sounds like you had an excellent (though damp) trip...great you were able to enjoy it with your wife (and fur buddy)."
5642665,Thompmd,2017-07-02 08:25:00,320,"She did a fabulous job, couldn't ask for more. It's only her 2nd trip but she is ready to go again next year. It's really interesting to see her perspective on the trip since she isn't into the fishing as much as I. We bought some nice binoculars for this/future trips and she loves taking pics of different things. One of the things the camera has is a silhouette feature and it has a couple of pics of me catching a fish and the dog always has to check them out and it shows our silhouette and the background, its amazing. The best part is that it was together."
5642865,Further North,2017-07-02 11:15:00,2008,"I've looked at that resort in the past, but chose not to go there because the cost per person was more than twice other LOTW lodges.I get the impression you went with a plan where you did your own cooking, which isn't something I see on the web page - I see the $165 a day package with your own boat, but it looks like that still includes meals. Shoal Lake interest me for the pike, and Ash Rapids Lodge is in a great place for accese ro Shoal Lake as well as a lot of the rest of the Northern part of LOTW.EDIT: Never mind. Found the housekeeping rates on the Cabin page ( http://ashrapidslodge.ca/cabins )...they are competitive with others, and I will check it out for next season when I get back in a couple weeks. Odd that they don't have that set up as a link on their ""Packages"" page."
5643017,Thompmd,2017-07-02 13:07:00,320,"The entrance to Shoal is literally right across the bay, 1min. We prefer hsk and they only preferred a days notice if you wanted to eat at the lodge. Their sign said they open the restaurant to the public on July 1 6days/week and heard they do an excellent business.Seemed like all the camp boats ran to Shoal everyday. We actually stayed on LOTW 90% of the time. I think map#6217 covers Ptarmigan bay/Shoal lake. Probably 15-20min boat run from the ramp to camp."
5643065,Lake Of The Woods,2017-07-02 14:53:00,124,"Hey Thompmd, good to hear you had a enjoyable trip.Did you hear of anyone 'accidentally' hooking into one of Shoal Lake's giant Walleye? Did you get a chance to stop in at Northwest Outfitter's camp and say hello to Don Sauve on your way to Shoal Lake or did you see his camp as you would have had to boat by his place if you headed south from Ash Rapids towards Shoal Lake.Also, was anyone fishing for those chunky Lake Trout in Clearwater Bay? Should be heading up later this summer to visit some friends and hope to work the area for Muskie around Don's camp and hunt for those big Pike in Shoal Lake.May even come across some of those unexpected rather large Wallies while jigging for SM Bass south of Ash Rapids,..."
5643345,Thompmd,2017-07-03 02:17:00,320,"When Shane took me over to fish Shoal for the day for Bass I did catch a walleye about 18"" on a crawdad colored crankbait and we released it. I wouldn't want to get caught fishing for them. I actually didn't notice another camp. The only people I saw in Clearwater were just passing through.I don't think you can help but catch them occasionally. Goodluck and I'm sure you won't have any trouble finding fish. The area seemed to have very little pressure."
5651882,reconssd,2017-07-07 17:27:00,147,Be advised that conservation officers abound on Shoal Lake. Any interpretation that you are fishing for walleyes specifically will get you in trouble. The walleyes in shoal are big. That's what decades of closed walleyes will get you. We have had walleyes hit Muskie baits on Shoal. The northern pike are really big on shoal too. A couple years ago a fisherman fishing for smallies landed a 52 inch Muskie. No doubt shoal is a trophy lake. You just can't go there and target walleyes.
5652010,Further North,2017-07-07 20:33:00,2008,Thanks for the info. I'll take a look at it for next year when I get back from this year's trip.
