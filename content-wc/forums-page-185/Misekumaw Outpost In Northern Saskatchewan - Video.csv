5665386,BrianE,2017-07-14 18:59:00,98,This is what i need to learn as it can be overwhelming. Looking forward to see how you attack large bodies of unknown water which by the way i love and prefer.
5665514,spoonchucker,2017-07-14 19:55:00,82,"Mike- To think we turned down going to Misekumaw the week ahead of you! But the fact is we were skeptical about Sask weather in mid June. We were looking at the 4 day trip and I know (the hard way) that in that region you could miss two days getting in because of bad weather only to have two days of bad weather when you are there. We had thoroughly researched Misekumaw and got some great reports though, so we asked Maxine about coming in mid July and could she just get us a reference of someone who fished it in July. She could not, and now I guess I know why she had no references. We also pulled back on Misekumaw when she said they had only four boats and I had 11 guys, and I was told 3 in a boat with 15h and two in the other boat with a 10h. I still though think my group will try to get up there in July this year or next. One of the guys I spoke to about Misekumaw swears he saw a pike close to 60 inches follow a small (I thought he said grayling) when he was up there. I do look forward to meeting you when you fly in to Edmund, as my group of ten will be flying out. My son, the editor of On the Water magazine, a mostly east coast fishing magazine where the mainstay is striper fishing will be coming with me as always. He got his start on the walleye pike trips we did in Canada. I am anxious to see how you attack Edmund and the adjoining waters. I don't quite understand why the Master Angler program shows no masters at Edmund since 2014, but I was told it has something to do with a dispute between the lodge owners and Tourism Manitoba. We love your videos and your reports. I also know how great it is for you to to fish with your son, as I have had the opportunity to fish with all three of my sons and my daughter on various occasions."
5665530,kona77,2017-07-14 19:59:00,236,"Mike;Look forward to seeing how you breakdown a lake for potential fishing spots. I am never ""breaking ground"" and fishing new or unexplored lakes like you but I still enjoy finding spots that are not marked on the map provided by the outfitter or past guests. Never too old to learn new techniques."

I also know how great it is for you to to fish with your son, as I have had the opportunity to fish with all three of my sons and my daughter on various occasions.I totally understand why you might have been hesitant, but I'm hear to tell you it's a lake you should definitely fish!! Please call me direct to chat about Misekumaw, anytime, 905-630-8045. I have some info for you. As far as Edmund goes I'm looking forward to meeting you and your son as well! I pretty much already know how I plan to attack that lake in mid August, from my perspective I'm curious about how/where YOU guys are fishing it. If you can remember I'd like you to do something for me when we fly in. Upon arrival can you point out which boat I should be taking?? There's usually one that's a little faster, doesn't leak a drop, has better boat seats, etc. Usually I end up getting stuck with the dog of the bunch LOL!I'm amazed that you guys do these trips with such large groups! 10 is a huge number for a trip like that! I guess it's safe to assume the cabin at Edmund is large enough? (didn't think it was that big). Anyhow, looking forward to it big time!!"
5659962,Mike Borger,2017-07-12 05:16:00,1554,"The full report will be done in a few days, but I thought you guys might like to see this 24 minute highlight reel video.In a nutshell:The camp is very remote and has barely been fished in recent years. When I left last week they closed it up for the season because they have no more bookings. This camp still has that ""new car smell"" and the fishing reflects that.The camp is NOT 5 star. It's a basic fishing camp with 3 small A Frame sleep cabins and a larger central kitchen/lounge area. It does have a very rustic flush toilet/shower house in behind the sleep cabins which was nice. Boats were good - 16' Lund SSV's with floor inserts, electronics and 15hp 4 stroke electric start Yamaha's. There was a camp manager on site to assist, clean and gas boats, etc, he was cool. It's a really great camp for bigger groups.The trip is inclusive from Saskatoon. Getting to the outpost was fairly smooth, a charter prop plane to Points North, then a float plane direct into camp. The outpost is operated by Milton Lake Lodge and at Points North most of the people on the charter flight with us went on to the lodge. My ONLY complaint was the apparent disorganization at Points North by the baggage handlers. Stuff was being unloaded and delivered to the turbo otters and I had a very bad feeling at the time because none of our gear was marked. As it turned out my bag with my video camera went to the lodge by accident, a situation that was immediately rectified the next day thank goodness. Now to the important part, the fishing. Misekumaw is a world class trophy northern pike fishery. There is lake trout and grayling as well, but trophy pike is what it's all about. My group of four anglers caught 51 pike between 40 and 451/2"". That was amazing, but even more amazing imo were the vast numbers of mid 30 inch fish we caught. Solid fish that ranged from 34-38"". We caught those all day long. There literally were no small pike. I can count on one hand the number of hammer handles I caught all week!Water temps the last week of June into early July were 58 and reached as high as 61. Pike were stacked in shallow bays like cordwood and hit pretty aggressively. No subtle plastics required on this trip, it was all spoons, spinnerbaits and a bunch of fish on topwater (that was a blast!).There are few camps I would return to as I like fishing new water, but this is one of them. I'd go back in a heartbeat!Anyhow like I said the full story will be done in a few days, but until then here's my somewhat crude but hopefully captivating video. Cheers, https://youtu.be/-ZuIK0e_Mbg?t=1s"
5660914,BornToFish,2017-07-12 12:42:00,1224,"Greetings Mike,The video was fun to watch. Did I hear you say ""donky kong"" in the video? I think it was you that mentioned to me a while ago that I should get a copper colored Doctor spoon with an orange stripe. I picked one up and did very well with it last week while fishing for northern pike. It looks like I need to watch for some new color schemes.Thanks for sharing the video!!"
5660954,Mike Borger,2017-07-12 13:10:00,1554,"Yes, ""the fish are On like donkey kong!"" I know, I know I'm old LOL!That copper/orange Doctor is my favorite, probably because most of the water I fish is tannin stained. On this trip that one worked, but the pink/white with a silver back was on fire. Probably because it was a clear lake with almost no stain."
5662466,Jeler,2017-07-13 11:07:00,92,MikeThanks again for a great video! Always top notch (even though they endup costing everyone here $$$ for their next trips. LOL)Donkey Kong? What ever you say!Just ordered some Dr. Spoons and excited to give them a try next month!Jeff
5662514,Mike Borger,2017-07-13 11:31:00,1554,"You're welcome! I'm sure you'll love the spoons too.As far as the saying go, when excited a number of them tend to crop up.The fish are on ""like Donkey Kong"", ""like white on rice"", ""like a bum on a baloney sandwich"", etc, etc,..."
5662994,Bstar,2017-07-13 14:49:00,564,"Mike, that is some awesome pike fishing! Another great video. I must say the only things that was over exposed in that video we're your white legs! You need to hit the tanning booth!"
5663042,Mike Borger,2017-07-13 15:10:00,1554,"I know! I'm a hideous, hulking pale skinned monster. I can only hope people will get over their revulsion so they can watch the video."
5663122,Bstar,2017-07-13 15:57:00,564,lmao!
5663698,BrianE,2017-07-13 22:43:00,98,"Mike thanks again for sharing, got to say you seem to know and find those awesome lakes, so cool letting us know about them. Very classy of you and great job telling the story."
5663850,Mike Borger,2017-07-14 05:31:00,1554,"Thanks Brian! The story hasn't been finished yet. I'm actually doing something completely different with this one. Rather than my usual day by day recap I'm going to explain precisely where and how I fished every day. With the idea being, attempt to explain how I systematically break down a large, unknown lake."
