5658002,troutwater,2017-07-11 07:23:00,299,"Thanks for the share! How can that be though? I mean whenever I've asked them before about boat traffic and fighting for spots I always get ""60,000 acres"" blah blah blah. Ok I better shut up before I get in trouble..."
5658130,kcguy68,2017-07-11 08:29:00,51,"I have had the experience where I was fishing with a guide, and the guide would yell at people who fished near us, and in my opinion those folks were by no means crowding us at all. Later that same morning, that same guide put us into a spot to where you could almost shake hands with the folks that were already on the spot, and he didn't say a thing. To say the least it was very uncomfortable, and after that day, I would not use that guide again. There are certain spots, on certain lakes that tend to attract large quantities of fisherman (Eagle Lake / Viking reef). The last few years my group has expanded our range to find other areas of Eagle that have proven to be just as, if not more productive than Viking. One of these spots produced both a 29"" and 30"" walleye within 5 minutes of each other."
5658482,MrSimon,2017-07-11 10:12:00,922,"It seems the vast majority of incidents like this involve guides. Man, if I paid a few hundred bucks to spend the day with a guide, I would expect him to take me to little-known spots that he had found himself .... not community holes that are plastered all over the internet. On the flip side, if I'm out fishing in my own boat and choose to fish a well-known community hole, then I wouldn't complain if it got crowded."
5658506,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-11 10:19:00,447,"I'm not defending bad behavior by anyone, including guides, but there are no little known spots anymore. People see a guide boat stopped on a spot and they decide to give it a try there to. Either right then or at a later time. Frustrating to put in the time to find new spots and then have what amounts to unpaid follow boats crowd in on you. Again, not defending anyone who crowds another boat."
5658538,MrSimon,2017-07-11 10:31:00,922,That's interesting you say there aren't any little known spots anymore. I'm starting to realize there is a BIG difference between high-access popular lakes and remote lakes. It seems the experience you get on those two different types of lakes are hugely different.
5658546,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-11 10:40:00,447,"Yes, I was referencing lakes like LS and LOTW. Heck, I remember a thread or two on this site where people asked for fishing advice and we're told ""Just follow the resort boats."" Remote lakes are a different story."
5658658,v-bay gord,2017-07-11 11:31:00,3168,Shocking!!!!
5658938,packpro,2017-07-11 12:51:00,695,"On our Lake we know the guides and they know us. The spots we fish......they gave us those spots so many years ago. We have to respect that. So........... we talk it out when we know they are working. They are getting paid to put their clients on fish. They usually communicate where they are going to be fishing and what days. We stay off those spots on those days. We can hit those spots on other days. For that consideration, they may give us 5-10 other spots to pre fish. The fish are always transitioning. Later on at night over a cocktail we trade information. We fished 4 new spots this year we never fished before, all with pretty good results . All given to us by our friends. We have four other spots we never got to. Plenty of spots to go around. Respect begets respects."
5659058,DaBirdman,2017-07-11 14:10:00,164,"This is why I like the north arm area of Rainy Lake. Few resorts, few boats. Sooooo many spots to fish. Closest I've ever been to another boat in Canada is maybe 100yds working the same large reef. When they came, we just reeled in and moved a couple miles down the lake. Not to be rude or make a statement to the other boat, just that I know of plenty other spots that hold fish and we can all enjoy the sounds & sights of nature and still have that feel of seclusion."
5659690,BrianE,2017-07-11 20:31:00,98,"People come in all shapes and sizes and unfortunately not everyone is respectful, not much one can do. Our group has only seen one other boat in Canada and it came from our outfitter's other cabin several miles away. We only do fly in trips and will never change that, we love that peace of mind. If you want to see boats just come to Lake Michigan here in n.e. IL & s.e. WI, they are everywhere and sometimes will get nervously close but it's a big body of water and despite that the fishing this year has been awesome and makes it worthwhile."
5656330,IMWalleye,2017-07-10 10:28:00,35,"I ran into this same on NE Lac Seul first weekend of June. First encounter was at Pecker Point - he and his buddy got to within 15 feet of us using his trolling motor. He didn't stay long, heading off toward Birch Narrows. Two hours later, they showed up again trying to crowd me out at Tom's Cabin. I didn't let that happen - then I netted a 26 incher right under his nose. No words exchanged - didn't need to!"
5656442,Iowa4ND,2017-07-10 11:11:00,35,"There are a few like this everywhere. Fishing Nungesser this year had some pull into our line of 3 boats as we back-trolled toward a point, I told the BIL not to vary one inch off course, they got the message and pulled off but just ridiculous on that big a body of water to get that close to someone. I go fishing to get away from people, why would these type even want to be that close to someone not in their group?"
5656498,Pooch,2017-07-10 11:23:00,4618,"Four years ago on LS we had a white Lund with bimini top keep showing up everywhere we fished. He was obviously tailing us as I saw him going up the lake and he made a hard right and came over and fished by one of our boats. Our boat was anchored and when they pulled the anchor there were three jigs hooked to it. PITA to get them out. So those fools were pitching towards buddies boat. Truly with enough cash or credit to buy such a nice boat, but not smart enough to find fish on their own. Good grief.........Pooch"
5657202,vteye2,2017-07-10 17:29:00,123,Not dealing with any knuckleheads other than the ones in your party..
5657362,v-bay gord,2017-07-10 19:35:00,3168,"I think the best thing to do is what the poster has done.......take a picture of the idiot and post it in as many places as possible. I've heard a report from Eagle of someone posting similar idiot behavior to their fb page.....apparently guides from a ""well known"" resort. I'm hoping to find it and post it on this thread............."
5657394,martinbns,2017-07-10 19:59:00,1520,"So yesterday, my wife and I were exploring a part of Lake of the Woods we had never been to before, after a terrific lunch at Wylie Point Lodge we decided to fish around little rope island. We came near the island and the hump we were looking to fish, there was a guy on the other side trolling spinners back and forth in about 15' of water, we were maybe 75 yards away when I stopped and began jigging. By your definition other than the yelling did we violate his space?"
5657450,pjshorthorn,2017-07-10 20:38:00,5654,"I wouldn't have been upset if I was pulling spinner rigs with the scenario you described. Just a couple of weeks ago I happened to find an 18' contour line that held fish and we had a pretty consistent bite. Another boat from our camp was fishing in the same general area ( similar to your scenario), but they were struggling due to a main motor issue. They were drifting more than trolling. As we came closer together, I suggested they use their trolling motor and make passes around the marker bouy I had dropped and give it a try. Over the next hour my son and I caught fish and they caught fish working in tandem on our trolling passes. The best part is that Grandpa and Grandma had their grandson out with them. The grandson made sure to tell us what he/they caught every time we passed one another. That was a good memory from our trip. Yeah, folks can be ignorant. Guides can be under the gun to produce fish for a client,but that doesn't reserve them the right to horn in on others who are enjoying their day just to put someone else on fish. I think that type of guide is definitely in the minority..at least from my experience over the years fishing in Canada. In my opinion, a person will most likely tend to show their true self ,without provocation ,when catching is more important than just fishing. PjShorthorn"
5657474,Aspencreek,2017-07-10 20:51:00,2911,"To answer your question.....no. You were on the other side of the island, and by coincidence you discovered him. If it were me I would have waved, asked if he was doing any good and asked if he was trolling my side too. Good friendly interaction is usually welcomed.Actually while backtrolling and rounding a point or bend to find another boat is not all that unusual, I just go back from where I came from and try to get that one I just missed to hit again."

5657802,martinbns,2017-07-11 06:17:00,1520,"Just to clarify, I wasn't on the other side of the island, just the other side of the hump. We were stationary, he was going back and forth with his spinner. We were about 75 yards away."
5654778,fisher_i_am,2017-07-09 17:56:00,498,"Been going to Canada, Sioux Lookout for over 20 years. Although we have had at times people come right up to us to fish the same spot, I have never encountered such a jerk as I did this year. If it weren't for his particular actions below I would just brush this off but feel I should be sharing this. We were fishing a well known mid lake hump in Minitaki SE bay on Monday July 3rd in the morning. We had been there for about an hour and had several markers out when a black lund roared up on us and started fishing about 50-75 feet by us. This happens from time to time and although I think it is rude we never said or did anything until he proceeded to get within ~ 10ft of one of our boats. At that point our party in the boat had told them to back off they were too close to their boat, we were slow trolling lindy rigs. The idiot in the lund proceeded to tell us quote ""go back to blankety blank Illinois, this is my lake and my spot""At that point a few other words were exchanged and we picked up and left. We did have several kids on the boats. I proceeded to pull up my marker which was about 20 ft from them and asked if there were any other spots on the lake that were his which we needed to stay away from and thanked him for the hospitality. He did tell us he owned the english river also and to stay out of it. I did take his picture that shows him clearly with his Ontario boat registration.Usually when people fish the same spot I think they are idiots but never really exchange any words and if we do it's usually ""how's it going"" and pretty pleasant after that as everyone is just trying to catch some fish and have some fun. This guy, who our group now calls Mr. Ontario, was an exception and a complete a-hole. We laughed about him all week and couldn't but help think one day he'll run across someone else and may not have such an uneventful outcome. Mr. Ontario had 4 others in the boat and almost looked like a guide. I still wonder if he was a guide or just a fisherman. Nevertheless, I could see the disgust and embarrassment in the faces of the other on the boat."
5654882,Pooch,2017-07-09 19:00:00,4618,"I thought ""The Crown"" owned the land in Canada. Maybe he considers himself part of that lineage?Guess there are chumps north of the border, too. Pity, as I thought we had most of them south of the border. Might be an invasive species?Just a little tongue and cheek.....Pooch"
5655074,prov1800,2017-07-09 20:23:00,5010,Unfortunately we do have a few of those here too.must have been the only spot he knows.there is a lot of us that would never to that but some guys just dont have much class.hope you still enjoyed our great country.
5655098,Aspencreek,2017-07-09 20:46:00,2911,"There is one in every crowd I'm afraid. It seems that throwing out a marker or 2 is an open invitation to any and all unfortunately. I have told the story here several times already that we use a marker to see how many fishermen we can catch now. Painted bleach bottle with a rope and anchor, throw it out in some not-so-special spot away from where you are fishing and just watch the parade stroll in. Our personal best is 7 within a morning, with one picking it up only to find our message written on it, explaining it's use, that guy was pissed but we got a heck of a good laugh."
5655218,pjshorthorn,2017-07-09 23:14:00,5654,"That is wrong on so many different levels........funny,but just wrong. PjShorthorn"
5655234,outdoorsron,2017-07-09 23:47:00,843,Hello: A few years ago I ran into the owner of Wenasaga lake. We were drifting jigs and lindy rigs as the wind was blowing us right down the shoreline when this guy comes trolling heading straight for us. He starts yelling at us because we were in his way. We had been fishing there for almost an hour and never saw him around. He told us it was his spot. We just kept fishing and stayed out of his way. It was not a camp boat and no registration from the states. I thought such a fine citizen to represent Ontario. He was lucky I was having a good day. Good Luck . O - R
5655434,Fisherman1792,2017-07-10 05:40:00,927,There are a few up here. LOL!I hope you still had a good time anyways.Fisherman 1792
5655690,Multispecies Guy,2017-07-10 07:01:00,447,"On 2 occasions in NE WI I've had a local guide cut me off (casting a weedline for muskies and he pulls in 1 1/2 cast lengths in front of me and starts working the weedline in the same direction I was) and then tell me he has priority because he's ""trying to make a living."" The first time he did it one of his clients actually apologized to me."
5655898,HeHooksHimself,2017-07-10 07:54:00,725,"I resurrected the ""THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED"" thread when I discussed a similar incident that happened involving a guide on Eagle Lake. It is worth the read and proves that your incident was not an isolated event. Fish On! Hooks"
5656106,Mojo-NC,2017-07-10 09:10:00,1929,"O - R, I think we must have run into that same guy on the same lake few years ago. It was one of those early-season days where the fish were all stacked up near the mouth of the river. All of the boats were trolling spinner rigs around in the same general area and some (Canada boat registration) blasted profanities at one of my friends for ""following too closely behind his boat"". We missed the actual encounter because we had already headed out of the area to search other parts of the lake for fish, but we heard all about it back at camp. He apparently considered those of us who were fishing from camp boats as lower life forms. The guy doing all of the swearing also had young kids with him in the boat at the time. Some people take this enjoyable and relaxing sport too seriously I guess."
