Bring a small piece of plywood/thick rubber/carpet to put between the clamp and boat.5) the portable units are convenient and all the brands are good..although the Garmin units have a higher listed power Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk"
5664882,troutwater,2017-07-14 12:58:00,299,Totally agree on the no hand held units comment. I bought one like 10 years ago....total POS!
5662786,bearfvr13,2017-07-13 13:37:00,174,"I know ZERO about fish finders,...is there a fish finder that I can purchase and bring to my Camp boat and use instead of the ones that are supplied? Something portable I'm guessing? Jus looking for some input for next years trip. The one on my boat kept showing 99 degrees ‚ùì I was waiting all over the lake for them to go belly up so I could jus scoop some up with a net and start eating!!! But no such luck!! Chuck bearfvr13"
5662938,Mojo-NC,2017-07-13 14:26:00,1929,"Garmin, Lowrance, and Humminbird all make nice portable fishfinders. They vary in price depending on the bells and whistles, but all come with a suction cup portable transducer that you can attach to the transom of any boat. Some have built in GPS. Most come with a bag or case to contain the unit and attachments while traveling. I would not recommend one of the little hand-held units or ones that look like a bobber. Mine is a Garmin and can use either 8 D-Cell batteries or a single rechargeable gel cell battery. My specific unit has been discontinued. I use the rechargeable battery and charge it every night. The color units and larger screens use more battery. A fast screen speed also uses more battery, so make sure you adjust accordingly. Lots of choices out there. I wouldn't go to Canada without one unless they were already provided in the camp boat. My buddy bought an extra transducer and converted his boat fishfinder unit into a portable version using one of those plastic shoe boxes you get from the hardware store. It works great and the price was right. Note: Make sure you secure the unit to your boat because at one point or another you will take off with the outboard and your transducer will let go of the transom. With enough cord out it could yank your entire unit right out of the back of the boat."

The real plus is they run on 8 AA batteries and on a 7 day trip a fresh set lasts about 75% of the trip. Only challenge is finding them. We bought one when they were in stores but got the other on eBay for $60
5663458,btyreprich,2017-07-13 20:02:00,1067,"More likely to have the propellor cut off the transducer. Don't ask me how I know this. Seriously, it might be worth buying a replace,net transducer for portable units. We bought ours on eBay."
5663498,bigdaddyguns,2017-07-13 20:21:00,608,Here is a WC thread a while back that discusses transducer mounts for a sonar unit on camp boats https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=502889
5663794,vteye2,2017-07-14 05:02:00,123,I tried my Marcum flasher designed for ice fishing. It worked great at marking bottom shooting straight through the hull of a camp boat . All I care about is marking depth. I turned it off and on and never changed the battery - 7 volt that comes with that flasher.
5663818,East coast,2017-07-14 05:18:00,32,I use the Sully Transducer mount from Bass Pro with any fish finder. I mount my screen to a board and secure it to the seat with bungee cords. I hook it up to my trolling motor battery. The only thing you have to play around with is the angle of the transducer and depth (both are adjustable) otherwise you running with a rooster tail or not marking bottom properly. I wouldn't go without it.
5664042,Bstar,2017-07-14 06:56:00,564,"X2 on the Sully mount. Most of the FF mfg have portable models. I have had Humminbird fish finders that I've used on fly-ins and they have worked well. I have a new Humminbird Helix 5 now and will be using it next month on a fly-in. If I were you, I would take a ride up to the Cabela's in Hammond, In and look them over. There is an older gentleman that works in that Dept that is very knowledgable about the fish finders without being intimidating.And they carry the Sully transducer mount too. Watseka isn't that far from Hammond."
5664194,BornToFish,2017-07-14 08:06:00,1224,"Greetings,I have my Humminbird units set up to be completely portable. I have alligator clips on the +/- electrical leads, such that I can connect to the lodge boat's starter battery. The transducer is mounted on a Sully bracket from Cabela's. All hardware is swapped out for stainless steel. I have a board with a RAM ball mounted on it, with the other ball mounted to the back of the Humminbird. I mount the board to a flat surface near the boat operator's position, such that it can be easily viewed.Set up this way, I can install my Humminbird unit in just a few minutes. The Lodge owner doesn't mind that I bring my own unit.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5664698,papadave,2017-07-14 11:56:00,151,"I take my Helix 7 for rental boats in Canada. I bought a soft sided carrying case from Reeds and mounted my Helix on a 3/4 inch thick piece of plastic that I cut to fit the bag. There are a couple ways to power the Humminbird. If you use an electric motor just run the power wire to that battery (make sure to fuse the line). Or take along two 12V 7A batteries so you can put one on charge while you are using the other. Clean off a spot on the transom and use a suction cup transducer. (They stick surprisingly well). The Humminbird suction cups come with a special rubber piece that clamps around the transducer cable and will keep the transducer out of the prop if it comes loose. I used my suction cup for two months solid once and it never came loose. I also take a 40 gallon tote bin with latch handles when I'm using rentals to store everything I might need while in the boat like pliers, scale, sunglasses, towels, small box of lures, sunscreen, bug spray, camera, etc. I can also put the Humminbird and my Mustang jacket in there at night to keep them dry."
