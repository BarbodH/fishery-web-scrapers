5660866,mms3rd,2017-07-12 12:26:00,148,I'm embarrassed to admit that I check other forums. Two that I have used are http://hotspotoutdoors.com/forums/http://fishingminnesota.com/forums/ Google is now warning me about deceptive practices on these sites and scaring my pants off. Anyone have recent experience with these sites?
5661578,h8go4s,2017-07-12 20:48:00,1673,I'm on both regularly and have had no problems. I use Firefox. But I recently had an issue with Google and an email account that I couldn't access for a couple of days because Google said it was compromised. Somehow it miraculously got fixed. I think Google had a snafu at their end.
