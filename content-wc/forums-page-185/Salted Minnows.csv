5664066,hoppy63,2017-07-14 07:09:00,367,Take out on boat with you what you think you'll need. Lay a few out on seat to dry out. Once they dry they stay on hook very well and work just as well.
5664082,DavKin,2017-07-14 07:13:00,104,I have used salted frozen fat head minnows with very good success the last two years. I put them on a screen before adding them to a zip lock bag with just pickling salt to thoroughly coat them. I have not had a problem with them getting mushy.
5664274,fishmanric,2017-07-14 08:34:00,219,We used Magic Emerald Shiners bought at Mills Fleet & Farm and they worked great. Caught all my biggest walleyes on them this past trip up on Lac Seul the forth of July week. I highly recommend them.
5664370,rzep,2017-07-14 09:25:00,1196,where can I buy salted minnows in international falls ?
5664442,Guest,2017-07-14 09:48:00,0,"What size shiners did you buy? small, medium, large? Did you also have live bait?"
5664634,fishmanric,2017-07-14 11:22:00,219,"Hey linebreaker, large emerald shiners are what we had. We also had minnows, crawlers and leeches. We caught fish on all baits but it seemed the bigger fish came on those shiners. The down side was I wasn't catching as many fish as the others using live bait. At the back of the houseboat there were schools of emerald shiners the same size as in the packages. I'm going to give them another try on another lake I fish in two weeks."
5661082,moneyman,2017-07-12 15:03:00,3,Has anyone taken these across the border before? Any restrictions? Do they work well and how do you do them?Thanks!
5661186,camp chef,2017-07-12 16:18:00,915,I have used them....No problem at the border...they work great.....I have just bought them.
5661218,BornToFish,2017-07-12 16:29:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been using salted minnows for the last several seasons. They worked well for us. One thing, I started using salted fathead minnows on a lake that has shiners as its forage base. It was a tough sell. Then, I switched to salted shiner minnows and the race was on.Last year, the Border Services Officers enforced a law that limited each angler to 120 (10 dozen) salted minnows. I wasn't asked about the quantity of salted minnows that I was bringing into Canada this year. There is another thread on this forum that offers recipes for salting minnows. I recall that it was started by a gentleman named FishOil.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5661266,yoopertrout,2017-07-12 17:00:00,1172,I've used them in canada twice and found that they worked as well as live ones. I've also heard about the limit on what you can bring in.
5661290,BornToFish,2017-07-12 17:20:00,1224,"Greetings,I found the link to FishOil's recipe for salting minnows:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...salted+minnowsI suggest that you read through the entire thread for ""improvements"" to the base recipe. It's pretty straightforward. I believe that a key to my success with salted minnows is NOT freezing them. I simply keep them in a covered plastic box in our refrigerator.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5661370,jaym,2017-07-12 18:39:00,89,"Just got back from Canada, was asked about salted minnows when we crossed going up but not about quantity. Didn't matter, got to the camp and found out they were left in the freezer at home."
5662034,Lovetofish,2017-07-13 07:58:00,458,Made mine last night will rinse them tonight and heading north in the morning. Just follow Fishoil's directions. He was taught by a wise old fisherman.
5662098,Bill Krejca,2017-07-13 08:09:00,6107,I usually dry them for a while after rinsing. Don't freeze. Bill
5662378,mms3rd,2017-07-13 10:36:00,148,"I used frozen minnows provided by a fly in camp. They worked well, even using a part with jig (walleyes and northerns). However, they did soften up and got difficult to stay on the hook. Do the salted minnows stay pretty firm?"
5664050,BornToFish,2017-07-14 07:01:00,1224,"Greetings,I have used frozen shiner minnows for walleye bait. They work fantastically well, but the downside is they get very mushy when they warm up. It can be difficult to get them to hold them onto the hook when they warm up.I've been completely satisfied using salted minnows. They just catch fish! When making my salties, I run them through a first batch of salt + borax, as FishOil describes. However, I do not rinse the salties after twenty four hours in the mixture. I take them out of the first batch, and put them into a second new batch of salt + borax for a few hours. I then put the salties in a colander and shake off the excess salt + borax. I keep this salt + borax mixture as the starter for my next batch of salties. I store the salties in a sealed container in the refrigerator until we go fishing.The salties have a dry, leathery texture at first, but soften when in the lake and take on the look and feel of a live shiner minnow. The one downside is that the salt will transfer to your hands and let you know if you have a cut on your hands. I keep a coffee container with water near me to periodically rinse my left hand. This keeps the salt from transferring to my reel and causing pitting.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
