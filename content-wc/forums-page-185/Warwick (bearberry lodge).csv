5662082,middle son,2017-07-13 08:07:00,15,Not a report as such but I was there briefly on 6/26; we had a 3 man group that stopped there to pick up a couple guys that they couldn't fit on the plane (large group) - they told us they did real well - they were primarily after walleye. Sorry but that's all I've got.
