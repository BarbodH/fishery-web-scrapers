507818,Guest,2000-05-11 11:33:00,0,I'll be making a trip to Ontario in June and have been hearing a rumor that nightcrawlers packed in bedding will not be allowed to cross the US/Canada border this year. Anybody know the scoop on this? Thanks.
507819,Barb,2000-05-12 06:13:00,41,"According to the regulations, worms in bedding material can still be brought into Ontario. Live leeches, minnows,crayfish and salamanders can not. For complete info check out the MNR site posted in an earlier posting."
507820,WALLEYE EYES,2000-05-12 14:59:00,20,Nightcrawlers can be in peatmoss or bedding. They can not be in dirt or soil. Look on the Canadian MNR site.
507821,Randy,2000-05-15 13:08:00,53,"I looked at the Ontario MNR site. The only thing I could find stated that it is illegal to bring live fish, cratfish, leeches into Ontario. it doesn't state anything about worms or the type on bedding that is allowed. What type of economical bedding do you guys rtecommend to transport a couple hundred worms?The MNR site also states that ""non-resident anglers cannot take bait-fish for personal use by any means"" I assume this means traps, throw nets, etc. Has anyone experienced this? I was going to bring a throw net along to catch a few minows around the dock."
