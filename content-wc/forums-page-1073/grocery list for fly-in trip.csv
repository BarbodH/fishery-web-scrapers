507746,Guest,2000-05-08 20:01:00,0,"Over the years, I've been the designated organizer of our numerous fly-in and drive-up canadian fishing trips. It finally dawned on me to keep a list of specific items (Grocery, Clothes, Fishing Gear, Miscellaneous) to make sure that we didn't forget anything. If you would like the list, I'd be happy to email it to you. Anyway, tight lines!Mark."
507747,Guest,2000-05-10 12:54:00,0,"Hey there,Never done a fly-in, but did 5 canoe only days in Quetico Park and couldn't leave ANY trash behind..We really like the dryfrozen meals like chicken and rice, chili, beef stews, etc..Then take your pancake mix and oil for frying fish, get some freeze dried veggies, eggs and sausage, and whatever sounds good..The freeze dried stuff really is a quick and simple meal that tastes a lot better than any MRE I ever had..Have a nice trip.."
507748,Guest,2000-05-12 03:42:00,0,"About twenty years ago four of us took our first fly-in trip to Quebec and we were green as grass. We'd brought ten cases of bottled beer and the pilot's eyes bugged out when he saw us begin loading up the plane. He didn't say anything but let us pack way too much in his De Havilland Beaver. We finally climbed aboard and he revved the engine up and steered the mighty float plane in the correct direction. On the first pass he couldn't get the plane out of the water. He simply shook his head, turned the plane back and tried again. Same result. Finally he mentioned that if, on the third try, he couldn't get it up we would have to drop some cargo. Naturally, our first thoughts were ""Who would we leave behind?"" (The beer was coming with us.) Needless to say, on try number three he pushed the engine to its limit, headed into the wind and began rocking the plane to get the pontoons out of the water and reduce the drag. Up she went and, after clearing some trees by what seemed like inches, we were off. The next trip we wisely brought only a party of three."
507749,Guest,2000-05-15 17:04:00,0,Yikes!!!!!
507750,Brownie,2000-05-17 13:13:00,12,"We've been doing trips (fly-ins, canoe-ins, houseboats, etc.) for 20+ years. A couple of standby's for us are the boxes of hashbrowns you simply soak in water and fry up in a pan, pancake mix you only have to add water to, country time lemonade mix in the small plastic containers, and hard liquor instead of beer. Whiskey and lemonade is a nice end to a long day on the water. I'm a beer lover, but I would rather have spare batteries for my fish locator than a six pack of beer. Good luck!"
507751,Guest,2000-05-18 09:36:00,0,"I have been flying into Northern Canada for years and can honestly say that shore meals rock both for comraderie and for ease of preparation. A propane hibachi, stadium kilbassa's / all beef hot dogs, buns, and cold BLUE's rival my moms christmas dinners. Kraft Velveeta and shells, peanut butter and jam, and fresh walleye fillets also make great meals that dont take much time to prepare. Pasta and a jar of sauce makes for a quick dinner as well. Remember, your goal is to fish so the ideal meals can be made simply by grilling or boiling water...good luck bro!!"
507752,Guest,2000-05-18 11:04:00,0,"The best advice I can give is to plan out a menu. figure out how many breakfasts, lunches and dinners and plan a menu for each one. After you've made your menu go through it item by item and substitue Instant whenever possible. When you go to pack, anything that is in a box should be repacked into a zip-loc bag. Freeze any meat before you leave your house, and loose the ice from your cooler before you load it into the plane. When you go grocery shopping, stick to the list. When you're cooking, stick to the menu. I strongly suggest designating one person responsible for menu planning, grocery shopping and cooking. The old saying about ""too many cooks..."" really applies here. If you plan right, you should have no problem."
507736,Guest,2000-04-30 08:17:00,0,"anyone have some good ideas on what to take and what NOT to take? 4 guys going into northern ontario for 5 days. the place does have a refrig. i think i can figure out how much booze to take, but could use some ideas on food. we have a 100 lb limit per man for everything. anyone know where you can buy condenced vodka? anyother suggestions are quite welcome. thanks!!"
507737,Guest,2000-04-30 13:01:00,0,"John i have been on 7 fly ins best advice is keep it simple. plan your meals how many meals of fish do you plan . do not take large size anything when small will do , canned beer wieghs less,We transfer all we can to plastic containers,you get the picture I still take too much tackle HAVE FUN"
507738,River_eye,2000-04-30 15:12:00,1486,"Try to avoid stuff with bulky packaging. I guess it all depends on what you guys feel like cooking up, and are able to. Pick up some packages of soup, that you just add water to, not cans. Like I said, you just have to think about what you want to eat, and how much fish you'll be eating.By the way, what place are you staying at?River eye"
507741,Guest,2000-04-30 16:19:00,0,"The re-pack suggestion is #1 - Figure out each menu, - count it up plus some extra. we actually count out how many eggs.Pancake mix - can use for fish breading - repack in Ziplocks - can re-pack LOTS in ZiplocksCan beer weghs less - 16 - 24 oz cans weigh even less per oz. of beer :)Take highest proof vodka - then just use less :)"
507739,Guest,2000-05-02 08:18:00,0,thanks for the useful hints. we are flying out of Wawa with Dale Air and going into Redwood Lake. Know anything about it??? the trip is july 19-24
507740,Guest,2000-05-02 10:23:00,0,I Fly-in with Hawk Air which is located down the road from Dale. If you need accomadation while in Wawa I have found the Sportsman Motel to be quiet and clean and Wally's restaurant has a great breakfast menu and it's within walking distance of the motel. If you would like the Sportsman's phone # let me know and I will e-mail it to you.SJB.
507742,Guest,2000-05-03 19:54:00,0,"John:For your meats, buy dry ice for the meat cooler and pack it separately from your vegetables,espec. if you don't know how big your freezer is. will last a few days longer than reg. ice. Secondly, you'll find a large variety of rice/beans/noodles that are lightweight and much better than hauling canned equivalents. It takes alot of advance prep. plan out a menu w/ someone (e.g. the better half if she's not too mad you're going!)who knows how to cook. A good simple meal might be some chicken breasts and rice or take a pre- cooked ham, surround it w/ some carrots and cabbage, and instant(boxed)potatoes, for ex. Also, stick to juice concentrates(1 can makes 2-3 quarts) and powdered drink mixes. Instant pancake mix is good too since all you have to do is add water,and it doubles as coating for your fish.I inherited the camp cook job a few years ago and have learned these things the hard way. I have some sample menus and grocery lists if you want them. let me know."
507743,Mr Pike,2000-05-04 13:49:00,3,Don't forget you have limits on alcohol and cigarettes that you bring with... I recommend light beer if you only have a 100 Lb limit :) Good Fishing
507744,Guest,2000-05-07 20:38:00,0,"I've been on 14 fly-ins throughout Northern Ontario and I am FIRMLY convinced it is impossible to enjoy fishing and eating and while staying UNDER 100 lbs. My philosophy is simple. Take anything you want and split the overweight charge equally among the members of your party. We have found this to be about 25.00 bucks American per man between a party of 6-8. We take everything we need including boat seats, clamp-on rod holders and a small Honda generator for charging sonar batteries. Don't deprieve yourself, pay the overweight charge and enjoy yourself."
507745,DaveIN,2000-05-08 14:50:00,191,"Several good posts on this question. I have done a fly-in each of the last two years from Sioux Lookout. The outfitter does not have a limit but asks to keep it reasonable. I weighed out load last year and it was 102 lbs per person. Lot of resorts have a great suggested list of what to bring, I think L & M Fly-ins was the best. Try that out.Enjoy the trip."
