507189,Jesse-WI,2000-05-15 20:12:00,534,Specifics would be appreciated. There is nothing wrong about giving bad press but reasons are desired.
507180,Guest,2000-05-16 05:10:00,0,I'm going up to this area with a group in early September. Can anyone give advice on location and baits for this time of year? How will locations differ from July/August. This is first trip to Lac Seul for my group. Anyone know of a good map available?
507178,Guest,2000-02-20 14:38:00,0,"Hi we fished Lac Seul last year at Pickeral Arm Camps fly-in cabin. We did GREAT there. We got so sick of getting walleyes we went for northern. We didn't get a whole ton of northern, but the one's you got were all in the 25""-36"" range. We also wanted to get some bigger walleyes so we are thinking about going somewhere else on Lac Seul. Our biggest walleye of the group of 6 we had was 24"". We are looking at staying at Whitewing Resort south of Ear Falls, Fisherman's Cove, Evergreen Lodge, or Timberlane Lodge. We are looking at a place to stay in July sometime. Does anyone have any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch!"
507179,Ron,2000-02-21 06:04:00,387,"We fished Timberlane Lodge in July in 1998 and 1999. In 1999 we had to fight with weather patterns, wind, lightning and rain. Still was able to catch a lot of Walleyes. Nothing real big. Some days had a hard time in getting fishout of the slot to eat. Basically we used jigswith minnows and or leeches. Biggest Northernwas around 10 lbs but we did not fish for them a lot. We are going to LOTW this year in order to get more variety of fish. If I can be of any further help, send me an e-mail and I have a mapthat I can copy and mark soem spots for you."
507181,Guest,2000-02-24 21:08:00,0,"WhiteWing Resort is a really nice place to stay. The resort is ultra deluxe, cabins have everything you have at home except it on the lake. The camp is maintained very well. A place that any female would enjoy, if by chance they are going! In July, the fishing is better down the lake as the eyes migrate. To get into the bigger schools you'll probally have to run 15 - 25 miles down the lake. Fisherman's Cove will get you closer to those July areas. Can't speek as to the accommadations for that camp or any of the ones south of WhiteWing for I have only stayed at Whitewing and Goosebay camps. If you are looking at getting closer to the better fishing, go with the other camps. If accommidations are important, then WhiteWing is primo deluxe! There are fish to be had at that end of the lake but it is more difficult to get into the mutha-loads."
507182,Guest,2000-02-28 11:01:00,0,"We fished Fisherman's Cove for 4 years. Good accomadations, but the co-owner - DAN, has a rotton attitude! We, along with 2 other groups I have sent there, had problems with him - concerning where to fish. He feels that if you don't know where to fish, you should hire him. He will not give out any info (we were just looking for GENERAL AREAS, NOT SPECIFIC). He is very concerned that you buy all of your bait, and supplies from him, and if you happen to bring in some bait, be ready for a lecture! Prior to Fisherman's Cove, we spent a year at Lac Seul Lodge. Old buildings, but nice people. We have settled in on Scout Lake Camp (just south of Fisherman's Cove).807 529-6126. 4 years with them, GREAT PEOPLE, GREAT FACILITIES, and they have no problem suggesting places to try. Two years ago, Roland (the co-owner) suggested just going accross the bay for walleye. I did, first fish - 29"". NO RESORT OWNER has ever given me a tip that was so right! 9 years on LAC SEUL, every year in JUNE. I am told by Roland, that he has folks coming up in JULY and they catch all the walleye they want, right in SOUT LAKE (a bay off of Lac Seul). If you want to travel to the main lake, it is about the same distance as Fisherman's Cove (approx 5 miles). GOOD FISHIN!"
507184,Guest,2000-02-28 15:45:00,0,"I've stayed at Timberlane and Evergreen; both well-run camps. I haven't been to Timberlane since Glen Anderson sold it, (1995) and last year was my first and last at Evergreen. I guess I ran into Gary on one of his bad Saturdays. His camp is well equipped and staffed though. It really depends on what you want out of your vacation. We generally spend as much time on the water as the weather allows, so all of the amenities aren't that important. A friendly host and staff and good equipment are most important to me. I've been going to Lac Seul for 15 years now and will be staying at my fifth resort this year. All have been great and I'm sure you'll enjoy your trip to the Ear Falls area as well."
507183,Guest,2000-02-29 10:10:00,0,"#####, I'll be making my first trip to Scout Lake Resort this July. Thank you for confirming what I had already suspected, that the Scout Lake folks are good people! I've traded a few e-mails with them and I already feel like I'm going to visit friends. Any information or tips you could give me on the resort or Scout Lake would be greatly appreciated. E-mail me at [email protected]."
507185,Guest,2000-02-29 17:49:00,0,"Mp35, what time did you stay at Whitewing Resort? We were told by the resort that most of the fish are in that area at that time of the year because of the weedbeds. Were there a lot of quiet bays in that area or is it more of the main lake? How big are the fish in that area? We booked the July 29-August 5 week. Did you guys get lots of pike and walleye as well? Have you ever been to McKenzie Bay from the resort there or did you stay mostly near the resort? Where is more of the better fishing, north, east, or south of the resort. and finally did you guys deal with other boat traffic in that area? You have already been a big help thusfar, I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. Thanks a bunch!"
507186,Guest,2000-03-16 14:04:00,0,Try Goldpines Camp. They have housekeeping and RV units available. Opening to mid June the travel time to excellent walleye fishing is 20 minutes max with very good fishing within 5 minutes of camp. Well protected from wind in the early spring.
507187,Guest,2000-05-12 18:00:00,0,"anyplace but scout lake camp. goldpines,lac seul lodge, white wing. trust me. d.j."
507188,Guest,2000-05-15 10:59:00,0,I've heard nothing but good about Scout Lake Camp. What's the problem?
