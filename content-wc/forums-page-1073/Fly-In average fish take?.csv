Ont. trip (this August) and I am curious as to what other groups pull in. So, here are my questions:1.) How many fish do you catch (this includes those kept and C & R). Include species, average size, and hawgs.2.) What technique did you use, i.e. trolling, jigging, casting...etc.3.) What month did the trip occur.4.) What time of day was your most productive.5.) What lure/lures were the most productive.My buddies and I (there are six of us) average around 200+ fish in a week. 96% of the time we are trolling Rapalas or Hot-N-Tots. The past year firetiger Red Eye Wigglers were HOT! If memory serves our last three trips have been mid/end-June, mid-July, and this year's trip is going to be mid-August. No real monsters yet, although I did get a beautiful 8lbs walleye mounted, and one member of the group caught a 36"" pike. Average walleye size last year was 19-23"", pike...28-34""."

507923,Guest,2000-05-17 15:15:00,0,"Well we have been going now for six years.First time mid-july, then for the last five years opening week.Opening week has NOT been the DEAL we thought it would be, average fish catch per day 50 to 60 fish per boat, mostly going after walleyes, some pike,size 16"" to 20"" walleyes, 24"" to 30: pike. At least the weather is better in July, can be raining all week in May!!!Every year always get a few 40"" or better pike but no hawg walleyes. Mostly trolling, jointed minnow cranks colors gold/black back, firetiger, as slow as you can go!!!!! depth 6 to 10 feetThe first year we averaged 100 fish per boat so are going back this year mid July.We don't go that far to fish with live bait, somehow it takes some of the fun out of it."
