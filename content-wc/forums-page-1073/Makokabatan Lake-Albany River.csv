How many did you catch and what were they? What did you think of the lodge and outpost, etc? Any informatin would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

If you stay at the outpost, I caught the biggest walleyes in and around the river next to camp(SE), using gold and blue Hot-n-Tots. Trolling harnesses did well. Caught the camps biggest Pike on the western shore north of the lodge. Sorry I can't give you any updated or detailed info, it's been awhile. Wonderful time though, beautiful lake. Maybe i'll get a chance to go back someday. (P.S. don't get too close to the rapids down the river)"
