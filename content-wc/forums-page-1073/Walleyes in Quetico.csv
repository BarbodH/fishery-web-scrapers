Very good for the eyes-but I have met guys going to or coming from the Quetico area and have heard them talk an awful lot about eyes in Argo Lake? If you see it on a map spelled anywhere close to that, then that is definitely the lake you want to hit for some time. Email me with any other questions regarding survival camping/fishing excursions...I have many years experience and would be happy to assist if you aren't an old hand yourself at this.See ya'-and tight lines...Tom Hudson[email protected]"

507601,Guest,2000-05-16 10:19:00,0,"Been to Quetico many times. Argo is a great lake trout lake, clear and deep, good sm Bass also. Not a great walleye hang out. Try places with current. Inlets, outlets and narrows are good. Also, reefs that top out at 15-20 fet for July. Fish earlier and late and travel or try for Bass, Trout, and Northern in the day.There is a book called A Boundary Waters Fishing Guide that can help. However, Walleyes"
