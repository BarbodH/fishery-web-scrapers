507883,Randy,2000-05-15 12:23:00,53,I will be fishing the Women River and Confederation Lake area (North East of Ear Falls)from June 7-13. I will be fishing for Walleye (light line) and Northern Pike (heavy line) What color of fishing line should I use. I wondering between green and clear.
507884,Guest,2000-05-15 19:49:00,0,It doesnt matter. Caught a ton on both colors. If you feel it might make a difference use clear but don't loose any sleep over it.

Every cast caused a backlash on spinning reels! Didn't catch any more (probably less) than with regular line, and at twice the price it just isn't worth it."
