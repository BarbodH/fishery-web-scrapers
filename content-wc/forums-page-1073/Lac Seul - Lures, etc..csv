507799,Guest,2000-05-08 11:42:00,0,"I am going to be fishing on Lac Seul in mid-June and am trying to get things planned for the trip. We will be staying at Evergreen Lodge so I'm sure we will be mostly fishing the north-western part of the lake. I am planning on bringing a large assortment of colors of spinner blades and jigs, but I'm wondering if there is any particular color jig/grub combination or blade size/color that I should stock up on for this trip. Also, I understand Muskie season is closed at the time of year I plan on being there (June 10-17), but I'm wondering if it is worth bringing the big jerkbaits and crankbaits for northerns. Any comments are much appreciated.Thank you,Erik"
507800,Guest,2000-05-08 21:30:00,0,"EricStock up on florecent colors (orange, chartruse and red) or combos of those colors. Sometimes brass or lime green does the trick. If I only had a limited amount of $$ go with the first 2 colors above. Sizes 2-4 in colorado or indiana. I have just about any color you could imagine and orange or chart. do 85% of the catching. I use #2 or 3 when trolling with electric trolling motor and the larger sizes with outboard. Seem to catch more fish on the smaller size blades. Minnow size didn't really make much difference just liked the smaller blades. As for Muskies.... probally not going to happen. Most of the Muskies you hear from LS are from the east side of the lake. I've never caught one on the west side in 16 weeks of fishing LS. At least never got one to the side of the boat to identify. Many lost unknowns! Northerns on the other hand are a different story. There are some nice toothy critters running around. My biggest is 44"" with numerious +38""ers. The big hogs were caught on either crank baits or spoons.I'll be up there 6/10 - 6/24 so, if ya see a red boat cookin along... I'm off in search of ""Walter the hog""Good Luck.Can't wait!!!!!"
