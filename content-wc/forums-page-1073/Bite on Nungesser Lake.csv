507838,Guest,2000-05-15 20:29:00,0,When are you going to Birch Point? I'm going the first week of August. This is my first trip. Yours? What have you heard of the fishing? I heard walleye is very good early in the year but have heard nothing about late summer. Also heard an occasional large northern can be found. Good luck.
