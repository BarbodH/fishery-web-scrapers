507827,Guest,2000-05-12 06:58:00,0,"man, you must have one big frickin minnow bucket."
507828,Steve W.,2000-05-12 07:30:00,99,Actually I've got 16 small ones (if nobody forgets theirs) LOL.
507829,Guest,2000-05-15 10:50:00,0,"Better check your regulations. You are only allowed to have so many minnows in possession. I believe it is 10 doz. per person. Check with your outfitter to see if he can help you. If you're going to stay on crown land by camping out check your regs., you will need a permit. Why so many minnows? Frank"

The camp we are staying at has been unreliable as a source for minnows, therefore I want to ensure an adequate supply before we get there. Thank you for your post, we'll certainly be within the limits of the MNR. I wouldn't have it any other way. Steve W.PS. I have a supply lined up already. Thanks again."
