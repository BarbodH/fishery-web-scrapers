507886,Guest,2000-05-15 12:43:00,0,"I was wondering if anybody has fished Northern Lights Lake. Especially this past weekend for opener ? I am trying to get a read on this lake and if the 'eyes are in their regular locations or in June+ spots already !?!As you can tell ... this will be my first trip to N.L.L., staying at the Resort. Should be a great experience. We used to fish Saganaga and portaged over to N.L.L. a few times in the past.Any assistance is appreciated. Thank you."
507887,Guest,2000-05-15 13:26:00,0,My mistake ... opener is May 20th. My apologies.Any hints for walleye spots would still be appreciated. We will be up on N.L.L. May 29th through June 3rd.

If you are staying at Bob Miller's camp this will be a pretty good distance to travel but should pay off. Go west around Arrow Head Point and head north up Nelson Bay but be VERY careful of the two big rock in the middle of the channel as they lie just inches under the water and can really ruin your day!!!!! From Nelson Bay you will enter Trafalger Channel, enter the first large bay to the east. You will find several small islands in the area and they have all produced eyes and smallies. If you feel real adventuresome and have the fuel, make a run to Hoof Creek in North Tackle Buster Bay. Bring plenty of leeches and crawlers and you should be in business. Don't know if you are bringing your own boat but if so take it s-l-o-w the last several miles. It is a logging road with big holes and ever bigger rocks, it shook the guts out of the stereo in my travel van and I never did get it to work again. Hope you have agood trip."
507889,Bill Coomes,2000-05-17 19:40:00,70,I used to fish Saganaga also until I portaged over to Northern Light. I haven't been there during May since '95. Try bays when the wind is blowing in. We caught several using this method up by the portage area. You might check with Steve Foster or Mike Berg over @ Seagull Creek Camp over by the Seagull Landing. Or Roger Mayer (The Great Mahumba) who has his own page. I forget the address but go to the links section of Walleye Central and he should be noted there.Good luck to you.
