Just wondering if anyone could give some good sound advice on hot pike and walleye lures at that time. We predominately troll for our eyes, but I love castin to pike. Just wanted to hear from some people who have experienced August fishing in Ontario."

Our group caught 20 pike over 35"" last August on Lake St Joseph on these lures. Cabela's has them or you can get them through LeBaron in Canada. Their web address is www.Lebaron.on.ca. LOL Fred"

For the pike we had great success with large tandem spnnierbaits (Bionic buck tails from Northland tackle) tipped with walleye gullets and Large (1 1/8 oz.) johnson silver miinows tipped with a walleye gullet or power grub. I would recommend fishing the cabbage Weed beds in 6-12 feet of water just outside bays and rivers with deep water access if you can find them. These baits work really well in deep weed beds. I would try to fish the edges of the weeds without drving through them. Boat control is key. Last year we had 43 northerns between 37 and 45 inches in one week between the four of us using these methods. We also caught all the eyes we wanted up to 12lbs by vertical jigging the edges of the weed beds and wind swept points. Hope this helps. Where are going this year? Good luck."

507835,Guest,2000-05-16 11:04:00,0,"Thanks for the responses, I really appreciate it. We have been going to N. Ont. for the last 3 years. Two years at Esnagami, and last year to the Albany River. We usually do pretty good. Typically we troll (we hate jigging!) for walleye and cast/troll for pike. I just can't help feeling like we should be landing more fish. We usually average about 200 for the week (between six guys). Just trying to improve the odds. What do you guys usually average for a weeks worth of fishing? Again, thanks for the advice.!"
