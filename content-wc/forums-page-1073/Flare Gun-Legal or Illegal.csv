I've been coming to Lake Ont. for a few yrs. and never had any problems, but with it being capable of discharging a 12ga. we've been wondering if it is considered illegal. Please only answer if you know for sure. Thanks...."
507855,Rick,2000-05-14 15:56:00,226,I just checked the Canadian Safe Boating Guide and yes you can use a flare gun here.

507858,Guest,2000-05-15 10:23:00,0,Plastic Flare guns of the 12 Ga type are common in any safety supply store where I live in Ontario. You don't need a special permit to buy them.If you have Flare gun that will fire regular 12 ga shells or flares and it was designed for it you have a problem. If this is the case check with the RCMP or OPP firearms people. They will advise you.Good fishing: Frank
