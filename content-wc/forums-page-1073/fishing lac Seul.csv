507859,Guest,2000-05-14 13:01:00,0,We are thinking about fishing Lac Suel area at the end of this month for a few days. We will be staying in the Sioux Lookout area and are wondering if there are places to catch walleye that are not as far as the Bear Narrows area. It just to far to travel there.

507861,Jeremy,2000-05-18 09:13:00,76,Launch your boat at deception bay and fish loon rapids it is only a short distance from the ramp and there are some spots along the way to try also. Also a little further is the Zig Zags this is another good area to try. These areas are fairly easy to get to if you have a good map
507862,KnottyBuoy,2000-05-18 13:18:00,110,Excellent Post........we have caught tons of fish 5 minutes from the langing at Deception Bay......Loon Rapids and the Zig Zag are both excellent spots too.! Remember to check the regs about the slot size and no live fish in the boat....they love to nail you for either infraction!
