1858897,hoppy63,2013-06-12 07:38:00,367,Hey Dave...went to kap two years ago. Water levels were about four foot below normal. Remi said lack of snowfall. We could not get to tenet and could only get to melchett via south pass. Was pretty rough going all around. Was wondering what levels were like last year and this year. Am hoping to make it up this year but so far only two will commit.
1860345,dog2,2013-06-12 14:29:00,198,"last year two of us hit kap last of August water levels were down.They had another low rain year but we caught plenty of fish.The only problem was the wind it started @ noon and lasted til about 8pm. everyday .. So we fished a little earlier in the am and a little latter in the pm.My fishing buddy and I got tired of tring to get people to go ,said the h--- with it we are going cost us about 200$ more ,$100 extra for only 2 people flying and adout $100 for fuel and tolls. So go enjoy yourselves and let us know how it went!"

Great walleye fishing as it was last year. party of 6 boating a lot of fish. had a 27, and lots of 26 25,24, etc with a very hard time catching 16-17 eaters. thats a walleye fisherman's dream....LOL. shure had a **** of a crop of skeeters for august but a man has to do what he needs to do. in my boat with my son we went thru 60 berkly ripple shads on 1/4 oz jigs in 3 days and you can get about 10 fish on each rubber shad. We dont count fish but I,m shure we smoked onetimedave and that old Tightliner by meeny meeny fish. also we dont write our numbers in the rafters of the screended in porch as not to embarass them. I was was Impressed by the entry on the blue outhouse door by Jerry B with a 12-3/4 dog log LOL. Hey another great year with FAT walleye,s and AWO thanks Remi and Chris. Also had a visit from the BIG yellow Bird (MNR) at camp and we were all legal as usual for the campbell party. one stray blue empty can in a boat at dock ....no problem . NO dought will have to go back up in 2014 from the great college football state of MICHIGAN and clean up melchett of all the walleyes them Buckeyes leave behind in May. ...............Halfmoon and the Campbell party"
1829145,onetimedave,2013-06-02 10:38:00,502,"Short brief report on trip to Melchett Lake with AWO. Flew in on 05-24-13 and out on 05-31-13. Great weather except on Thursday and it rained all day. Temps at night in the 20's F and day in the 70'sF. Our group of 6 totaled 1820 eyes and pike. One fisherman did not fish for a day and half due to being sick. Five pike over 40 inch with many between 35 an 40"". Many eyes over 20"" with largest being 26 inches. As usual equipment superb."
1829185,dog2,2013-06-02 11:22:00,198,glad to hear your group had a great trip. nice pike great walleye numbers also . what was the wildlife like this year.
1829193,1jigfish2,2013-06-02 11:34:00,110,"Great report, glad to hear that you did so well. That is a trip to remember."
1829241,tooski,2013-06-02 12:43:00,393,Thx Dave-
1829425,josheupmi,2013-06-02 14:44:00,1,Nice job Dave! We fly out to hebner on the 7 next week. What was your best baits?
1829433,Larry Mac,2013-06-02 14:51:00,530,"Hi Dave, Thank you for the great report. I am glad to see your group had another great trip with AWO. Thank you for sharingThank you,Larry Mac"
1829449,Ogoki,2013-06-02 15:10:00,291,Thanks for the report !! Am curious of what were the best baits for walleye and also for pike . Did you get the bigger pike casting or trolling ?Thanks ! My truck is packed. Like a kid at Christmas . My wife and I along with the two labs are staying nine days. Sitting here debating if I want to order 10 dozen minnows or just go strictly artificial .
1833665,onetimedave,2013-06-03 19:41:00,502,"We don't use any natural baits, only artificial. We use jigs with twister tails for eyes. Cast Johnson Silver minnows with twister tails into the reeds and close to shore for pike and trolled minnow type lures along with hot n tots for eyes & pike. Did not see much wildlife. Only one moose at lake. Bears on way up. Eagles at lake."
1834433,vteye,2013-06-04 06:32:00,812,Congrats Dave sounds like you had a great trip.
1834481,vteye,2013-06-04 06:42:00,812,"Our group met OnetimeDave & tightliner at the dock in Nakina. First trip to Ontario for our group went into Kayedon with AWO and boat/motors/fuel/facilities were excellant. Hats off to Remi & Christine who did not bat an eye lash when we arrived with group of 3 rather than 4 as deposited. One fellow was not issued a passport. Conditions were: brilliant sun, back bays with ice, full moon, no wind for first 4 days made finding fish a challenge. We caught over 400 pike and 100 plus walleyes. Best pike 41.5 a PB for that fellow. Best walleye a 22.5 male (could not find the ladies) we were very happy with 19 inch average size walleye. Eagles, peace, cold beverages, bird life, weather and good fishing = a great trip."
