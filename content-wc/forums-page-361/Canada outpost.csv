1992817,Newfisherman,2013-07-30 10:46:00,4,"I know you metioned using spinners or bottom bouncers but do you think using jigs with minnows or grub tails would be just as effective? Also you think I should buy a depth/ fish finder for the trip? if so, any suggestions? Thanks"
1993033,SinOrSwim,2013-07-30 12:33:00,1528,Jigs and minnows will work fine. Whether someone takes a depth finder is completely up to them but personally I couldn't imagine going to a new lake without one.
1993697,2746,2013-07-30 17:06:00,3206,X 2. Get a portable sonar. Eagle makes one for $50 and you can find several for under a $100. They only need to show the depth so don't go crazy with features. They can make the difference between a dismal or successful trip. Cheap insurance!
1998250,wannabefisher,2013-08-01 09:23:00,3,What are baja walleye tacos? How do I make them and what do I need?
1998370,Hawkfan,2013-08-01 10:22:00,237,"The Baja walleye tacos are in the video Sin posted in this thread. We fry the tortilla shells a little to firm them up, add fried walleye chunks, some cabbage and some Baja sauce. The sauce is a sour cream and mayo base with some chipotle, adobo sauce, shallot, garlic, lime juice and cilantro. Its delicious. You just have to be VERY careful with the food processor blades. They are very sharp and you will have to fight the urge to lick them."
1998682,SinOrSwim,2013-08-01 11:31:00,1528,"Just like Hawk said, put a taco size flour tortilla in your oil and with the tongs fold it in half like a taco shell. Do these before your fish. Then when frying your fish, just chunk them up into smaller pieces or slice them up in longer strips. Batter, fry and put them in the taco shell you made. Add some lettuce or some cabbage and some of the baja chipotle sauce. If you love shore lunch adding some twists to it makes it even better. We got tired of fish planks with beans. So, some days we take buns for a walleye sandwich and most days take tortillas with because they are easy to pack. Even if you don't fry the tortilla, we make wraps. Just throw a bag of shredded lettuce, some onions and before we go up, we fry up a bunch of bacon and crumble it up. Take it out in a ziplock bag. All, easy to pack and stores well. Add some fried fish to a tortilla, some lettuce, onion and bacon. Add a touch of tartar or ranch dressing along with some buffalo wing sauce and you have a walleye wrap that is absolutely amazing. Some of the other things we do are walleye chimichangas and cajun seafood/walleye pasta. These are in the cabin vs shore lunch. It's a little ore work but like I said, we got tired of just plain fried fish, beans and potatoes. We still do the beans and potatoes, we just spice it up a little."
2029586,wannabefisher,2013-08-14 19:47:00,3,"We are heading there next week. We were supposed to stay at North Gull but the outfitter changed it to Lake Zionz.Has anyone been there? Is the fishing comparable? How is the cabin, etc.?I have read about having problems with the first nation, is that still a problem?Is this a very shallow lake, what is the depth?"
2029922,SinOrSwim,2013-08-14 21:38:00,1528,"Never stayed at the Zionz cabin but we have been to the lake. To be honest I don't remember the fishing being very good but we weren't there very long. It's a long trip with 10hp motors at the time. I think they are 15 now? I don't know the depths there. Gull isn't a very deep lake either though. There are only a couple spots and small that get to 40ft. I'm pretty sure Zionz is where we tried to stop for shore lunch and we pulled up on an island, my brother (MorganMan on this site) got out. As we were pulling our boats up the two people were jumping back in their boat waving their arms yelling ANTS ANTS ANTS hahahahahahahaah Apparently there were A LOT of ants on this island and they borderline attacked them when they got out of the boat. Why did he switch you and did he switch you last minute??"
2030178,wannabefisher,2013-08-15 05:27:00,3,I am a little concerned because the switch happened 2 days before we depart. We were told that north gull is under construction. Seems a bit off to me.
2030410,SinOrSwim,2013-08-15 07:17:00,1528,"That does seem odd. You will be able to drive into Gull and go take a look if you want. It's a ways but not that far. That is odd though, no matter how you slice it. I wonder if something happened or if they had a bunch of stuff fail? You would think if they were doing a major overhaul, they would wait til the off-season. It's not that far away?Who knows, maybe he sold it? John bought Red Pine from Verne several years ago along with about half Verne's outposts. Verne kept the other half and I thikn still operates them under Slate Falls Outposts. Verne was/is easily the best outfitter we have had. We switched to a drive-in about 3 years ago, so I don't have any current info on the camps or the lakes. Let us know what you find out because we have been talking about going up there again."
1988194,Newfisherman,2013-07-28 15:51:00,4,Has anyone been to Gull Lake north outpost with outfitter fishredpine? We are going third week of August and any feedback would be great!
1988802,Hawkfan,2013-07-28 21:00:00,237,"Our group fished Gull for a number of years. We have stayed at both the north and south cabin and gone through John at Red Pine and Verne with Slate Falls before that. We have also always gone at the end of August or early September. You will not be disappointed. The cabins have all you need with solar lights, propane fridge, deep freeze, and also indoor toilet and shower. Fishing is outstanding. I've seen multiple walleye over 27"" come out of there and even over 30"". The only reason we changed our trip to Lac Seul was the cost of a fly in. Our group was dwindling down to four or five and now with the drive to camp we are at 15 this year. But there were rumblings of getting that trip organized again and I have a feeling some in our group will make it back next year. If you have any specifics you want, just holler. Myself or one of my brothers can probably help out."
1988914,Newfisherman,2013-07-28 21:42:00,4,Thanks for the review. Every couple of years me and my buddies like to try different ouposts. This is the first time they are suggesting to use live minnows. In the past we have always use jig heads with grub tails. Do you think it is a must at Gull lake that we use live minnows? Also do you know is the north and south cabins the only cabins on the lake or are there other outfitters that have places on Gull lake? At that time of the year how deep were you fishing for walleye? Thanks for the advice.
1989178,GNO,2013-07-29 06:14:00,153,"They are probably reccommending minnows to improve success as not all fisherman are equal. There are only 2 cabins on Gull, there are 2 cabins on Fawcett, and 1 on Zionz. The lakes are all interconnected on the Cat River system, but those lakes give you almost 40 miles of fishable water. You may never see the peopl from the other cabins."
1990322,SinOrSwim,2013-07-29 11:57:00,1528,"Yes, there are only 2 cabins but like the previous poster said, there are cabins on adjoining lakes so you will periodically see people. You won't see a ton of people though. We went to either North or South Gull for about 10-12 years. I am part of the Hawkfan group and MorganMan and I have been discussing getting a fly-in back together. It's been a few years since we have been there but the cabins were always clean, the equipment always worked, the boats were always in good shape etc. Whether you stay in the North or the South the narrows you will fish a fair amount are similar. Each cabin has an island or two within just a couple minute ride that is basically a guarantee if you haven't caught lunch. There is a river coming in right next to the North cabin. WE have gone up that thing a couple times. Never had great success fishing it but was really fun going up the couple rapid areas. We usually did that on really windy days when it was too choppy for those little boats on the main lake. My biggest fish ever came, a 30 incher, came from the narrows but also Islands around there have gotten us countless fish in the 24 to 26"" range with many 27's and a few 28's. One things we always noticed is many of the 24 inch range fish were really fat too. Here is a link to a youtube video I made a few years ago. I'll try to post a picture of the replica I had made from the 30 incher. All fish are catch and release so there is very good fishing to be had. We always used live bait. I don't think you would have to but it's basically a guarantee. For years, we had a tough time keeping fresh minnows. We would keep them in the oxygen bag as long as we could in a cooler but still had heavy amounts of dead minnows in our buckets. A few years ago I took a mesh minnow bucket with me and we put all the minnows in there, put a rock in it and sunk it to the bottom. Could do the same thing with a 5gallon bucket with a lid, drill holes in it etc. tie a rope to the dock and lift it up each morning. We have had guys go with us who never fished and didn't know the slightest thing about fishing and they still would catch many walleye in the 20 to 25 inch range. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLYYpbILr4cAbove is ours. Below is another of the fire which we were apparently there as that fire got started. But, we were at the north cabin and this was at the south. Not much in fish but was more about the experience. Here is the fire link. Some really cool footage these guys have.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZbNBXrq6qkhttp://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z...06-06_0055.jpghttp://i193.photobucket.com/albums/z...06-06_0055.jpg"
1990330,SinOrSwim,2013-07-29 12:01:00,1528,I should add the frying in the dark that is hard to see are Walleye Chimichangas. Easily my favorite meal up there next to shore lunch with some baja walleye tacos.
1991266,Newfisherman,2013-07-29 18:47:00,4,"Thanks alot guys- I just have a couple other questions... As you can tell Im a novice fishman. What do you mean by ""fishing the narrows""? Also at Gull lake did you mostly troll or cast for walleye? And about deep were the walleye in late august? Are there are any special/ hot spots around North Gull lake that you can remember and pass on? Thanks!"
1991402,MorganMan,2013-07-29 19:36:00,341,"Dang, Sin. Now I have to go back to Gull!!!!"
1991674,Hawkfan,2013-07-29 20:45:00,237,"There is a narrows, or narrow area of lake, between the north part and south part of the lake called Sparks Narrows. It will be on the map they give you. Its a deeper part of the lake and has some points and underwater ridge areas. A lot of structure that will hold fish most any day and any wind direction. Depth can vary, but most times between 12-20 FOW. As far as closer to the cabin, there are some islands around the corner as you come out of the bay that Sin was talking about. Always good for lunch but have had success catching size there as well. We mainly troll spinners with minnows, but have also jigged and trolled cranks. We have seen all types of weather at that time of year. Have seen flurries and have also been so hot we took a dip at the dock. Fishing flucuates from year to year as well, but not near as much. Have had a slower year, but never bad. Almost always good if not great."
1992233,SinOrSwim,2013-07-30 07:55:00,1528,"Like Hawk said, there are 2 spots on your map where North Gull and South Gull meet essentially and it will say right on the map ""narrows"". Probably the deepest area of the lake in those areas. Backtroll or drift if windy spinners with bottom bouncers with either worms or minnows mainly. I know some people used different colors but the weeks we were there I fished predominantly silver spinners and sometimes gold. Jigs are good tooThere are some big rocks usually hidden as you come out of the bay where the cabin is. They will tell you to go out and around but if you go slow, there is a more direct route that is plenty deep. But, it curves like a half moon. I use a humminbird with GPS and marked the area with waypoints so as long as I stay on the line can buzz through there pretty fast. Saves some time when going to the bigger island just outside the bay. There are not a ton of hidden humps etc but you will find some nice points and structure around many of the islands and none of us would be considered experts by any stretch and we always did very well up there."
