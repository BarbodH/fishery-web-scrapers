It's not directly on the lake, but have a boat launch about a half-mile away, and you can drive to it."
1481052,Guest,2012-08-29 20:13:00,0,"That Wabatong place looks pretty weathered, what about the rest of the outfitters?"
1481170,hoppy63,2012-08-30 08:41:00,367,"Ive heard lochalsh lodge, and Erringtons are both very nice. Just dont get much feedback on WC about this lake. What little ive heard, the fishing is good. I know my buddys' daughter pulled a 30 inch eye out this year. On a zebco 33! Lol"
1481180,adempsey,2012-08-30 11:05:00,963,"Nice to read you had a successful trip! Not sure if you already mentioned this, but did you fly, train or drive in? The idea of the train-in sounded fun (and old school!), but the price didn't seem much less than chartering a plane in. The drive-in sounds pretty dicey too, lol! Anyway, always thought it looked like an interested place to visit."
1481211,Jaskonie,2012-08-30 12:04:00,80,"We drove to the narrows it was the easiest outfitter/logging roads we have ever used to get in to a bush type camp you can average 45 mph most of the way with slow downs for railroad tracks or curves. From there you unload easily onto a pontoon and go 5 miles to the camp. THe best part of the trip was the way we were handled by the dock/guide staff and housekeeping. First class all the way, all your gas bait and fish cleaned no cost except tips of course."
1481215,Jaskonie,2012-08-30 12:08:00,80,Not sure if its actually a lodge or what but they seem to have a hotel by the tracks and a duplex. No formal website that I can find but a facebook page with some info on it. Sean is a local who runs it. Im gonna check it out as I am headed to Lochalsh in September.
2027082,BubbaB,2013-08-14 05:59:00,41,Jaskonie - did you ever check out Wabatong? What did you think?
2029618,Jaskonie,2013-08-14 19:55:00,80,"No I have never met him, he is a local that knows the lake as well as anyone from what I can tell though. I am headed up to Lochalsh in the fall maybe I will check out the lodge."
1452645,hoppy63,2012-06-22 10:44:00,367,Has anyone any info on this lake and/or lodges?
1453691,hoppy63,2012-06-25 07:33:00,367,Figure id give it 1 more try bringing this post back. Has no one ever fished here? Someone must have some info......
1453742,Ogoki,2012-06-25 09:10:00,291,"I knew a guy (now deceased) who fished it for years . He quit and started doing fly-ins out of Armstrong .Not much info ,but why does a person stop going to a lake they had fished for years ??"
1455566,chris.brock,2012-06-28 20:45:00,112,"I think the only option is this fly-in lodge, http://www.lochisland.comI think Ã’pen Season Sometimes Snowed Inn is toast, but would like to hear from anyone who knows for sure"
1455573,Jaskonie,2012-06-28 21:08:00,80,We are headed up July 7th to Loch Island. We are driving to the narrows in the center of the lake and they will be boating us in 7 miles to the camp. There are 4 videos on youtube under lochisland that are informative. Its our first trip in and looking forward to the daily shorelunch served up the camp. There is another camp on the North end of the lake ran the Erringtons.
1455632,hoppy63,2012-06-29 06:55:00,367,I thought there was a lodge that you could drive straight to. Looking for some kind of fishing reports for here. Jask i sent you. PM. Good luck up there!
1456867,hoppy63,2012-07-02 19:14:00,367,Talked to a guy that said walleyes could be non stop and nice pike. Available too. But he hasn't been there in several years. Any recent reports?
1457302,hoppy63,2012-07-03 17:28:00,367,Should have first hand report in week to ten days. Friends own cottage up there leaving friday.
1461290,Jaskonie,2012-07-13 21:22:00,80,"Just got home tonight from Wabatongushi. Fished out of Loch Island. The Walleye were non stop, all small up to 16 inches the first 3 days with as few plus 20 inchers. The winds turned around west and south on Wednesday and Thursday and the big walleyes heated up. 29.5, 28.5, 28, 27, 26 2x, 25, and multiples of 22 and 21 inchers from our group. Plenty of pike scattered in the mix as well. Not uncommon to boat 30 to 50 walleye in average conditions if you put in the work. Loch Island is a first class outfitter that knows how to handle fisherman with good dock hands and a friendly staff. We will be back."
1461890,hoppy63,2012-07-15 18:47:00,367,Thanks for report. Sounds great!
