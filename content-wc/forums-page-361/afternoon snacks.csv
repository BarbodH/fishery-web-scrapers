1993809,Mike Borger,2013-07-30 18:03:00,1554,C'mon man you must have some suggestions of your own.I was waiting for you to chime in.
1994041,fishinnut 3446,2013-07-30 19:20:00,638,HOLY ! How on Earth have I never tried something like that !I will be trying both in a couple weeks ! (if the fish are biting)
1994097,Rich B,2013-07-30 19:37:00,1081,"I bring up a large block of mild Amish Swiss cheese as well as several large links of Trail Bologna (as found in Ohio Amish country though sold at Walmarts and other grocery stores).....also bring up ""hot pepper"" cheese and different crackers.....make up ""meat and cheese"" plates and these get ""slammed"" and by mid-week are normally gone. As well, I'll bring up 2 dozen or so casing wieners and Tony Packo's coney sauce, and several bottles of Tony Packo's pickles (both regular and the sweet hots).....we have a meal of coneys with coleslaw and/or potato salad....a favorite of the boys every year. Rich B"
2000817,Pikeslayer8,2013-08-02 10:26:00,1460,"Lol I have a hard time with this afternoon snack concept as it is. I know my crew is usually pretty dang stuffed from lunch and I can't begin to describe the coma induced by a good walleye chowder and a few cold ones. Pretty tough as it is to crawl back into the boat without just a little nap much less worry about making a snack.That said, I'll throw a few of those good Canadian candy bars in my boat cooler for on the water but I suppose if we are weathered in camp for the afternoon and drinkin beer and playin pitch. I'd just start out with some sharp cheddar on a triscuit and throw it under the broiler till melted. A few years ago, my nephew, Bob, was assisting making the trisquit appetizers and instead of going by the recipe, he decided to sneak in a salted minnow under the cheese. Man o man, did the cabin just reek for hours. I do like halfmoon's idea with the Walleye Salad, I think I would go with a ""Walleye Melt"" also prepared under the broiler. Toast the bread you want to use, smear some dijon mustard on the toast, throw on some walleye salad and top it with sharp cheddar and broil till melted and hot."
2000913,jimirjr,2013-08-02 11:13:00,1149,"See, We keep it simple... Sweet Rolls and coffee for ""early' breakfast, Come back in for Lunch (or a BIG, normal, Breakfast) around Noon or so.... and Dinner around 7 or so.... Usually too tired to go back out after a BIG dinner and cocktails.... sometimes We go back out after Dinner, if We eat earlier. Then We suck down some sort of dessert.... and a Nitecap.... Do it all over the Next day.....Since I do 98% of the cooking, I call the shots... Matter of fact, I do 98% of the driving, also.... AND run the boat 100% of the time...I'm good at multi-tasking... lol!"
2000921,Lovetofish,2013-08-02 11:20:00,458,Do you do dishes too?
2001209,jimirjr,2013-08-02 12:46:00,1149,No.... Thank GOD !!

1988602,JayM5209,2013-07-28 19:24:00,1050,Yes and yes. Can't leave for NW Ontario without 'em. A goodly supply will be there in a month.
1988650,reconssd,2013-07-28 19:56:00,147,Venison Hot Sticks!
1988698,Glenman12,2013-07-28 20:16:00,762,"While 9 times out of 10 all of our boats are fishing in the afternoon we don't get too ""exoctic"" on our snacks that are mostly eaten when we come in at night..including packets of cheese and crackers, salted peanuts in the shell ( 2 -5lb bags) and assorted cookies made by some of the wives and bite sized candy bars...close to exotic is firesticks made of duck and goose breasts and homemade salsa made by one wife who is part Mexican..its the best.."
1990242,Aaron-IN,2013-07-29 11:14:00,500,"The only ""snacks"" we ever need are BEER."
1990354,camp chef,2013-07-29 12:06:00,915,"Cocktail hour varies daily but includes at least 2 of the following items. Aged cheddar cheese Aged brick cheese Smoked oysters smoked salmon Pickled herring, northern or whitebass Venison Sausage peel and eat shrimp and rice crackers or saltines"
1990362,Jimmy Jig,2013-07-29 12:13:00,1905,Snickers candy bars and a 7-up
1990450,Lovetofish,2013-07-29 12:59:00,458,A candy bar or cookie for a sugar kick. Usually have a package of beef sticks in the cooler that will last a couple days. The family likes chips and salsa for happy hour back in camp. Salsa on cold fish the next day is good too.
1990810,NARDA 1,2013-07-29 15:04:00,636,"That would be ""Hiram Walkers Special Old"" and we would never forget that!!!! Mass quantities of Rye does not effect my sense of smell however."
1991530,halfmoon007,2013-07-29 20:06:00,121,"We have poor mans lobster which is a nice size walleye chunked up into about 1 inch or so chunks dropped in boiling water for 3 min then refrigerate till cold . dunk in melted butter or cocktail sauce. But i save some and make wally tunie just mash up and add miracle whip, onions, sweet relish, salt and pepper and serve with crackers or make a sandwich. lettuce and a slice of cheese is a bonus. All good stuff from the camp cook give them a try........Thanks ...Halfmoon"
1992481,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-30 09:08:00,1460,Sounds like a winner to me. Gonna give er a try. Thanks for sharing.
1987002,labsrus,2013-07-28 06:26:00,557,"OK guys heading to Canada this week for a long anticipated trip. We do various things mid afternoon other then fishing of course, Looking for ideas to make for a mid afternoon snack while sitting on the dock making worm harnesses to match the colors that worked in the morning. Traditional snack have been Duck breast poppers pepper rings wrapped in bacon after marinating in italian dressing. Stuffed peppers Just looking for ideas Thanks"
1987714,TinmanDon,2013-07-28 11:34:00,194,bacon wrapped walleye.....you won't want anything else after eating this tasty treat
1987738,NARDA 1,2013-07-28 11:50:00,636,"Wrap bite size pieces of walleye with bacon, brush on some BBQ sauce and grill."
1987882,JayM5209,2013-07-28 12:37:00,1050,"1.) Pickled eggs!! Two or three per person. Not those white things you find in the gallon jar sitting on a bar somewhere, but the real Pennsylvania Dutch style pickled with beets and onions and in the fridge for two or three days before eating.2.) Accompanied by a good quality almond/swiss cheese spread with crackers of your choice.3.) Beverage of your choice. I recommend Shiner's Bock from Texas."
1988106,v-bay gord,2013-07-28 14:45:00,3168,Hmmm....sounds like a good apr√®s lake trout fishing kind of snack. Do you share?
1988154,NARDA 1,2013-07-28 15:09:00,636,I wouldn't want to be in that cabin.
1988242,jignminow,2013-07-28 16:27:00,168,"We like tender young muskie strips, baby loon teriyaki and bald eagle eggs....."
1988274,Knoxabilly,2013-07-28 16:45:00,225,Hahahaahahah jiginminnow
1988482,jignminow,2013-07-28 18:29:00,168,Can't believe I forgot about the beaver tail soup and bear kidney pie...my bad
