Mt son and I tent camped one year for our father son trip. Walleye Pike and Perch can be found near the camp. Ear Falls is just a few miles away, if the kids need a break from fishing. Good luck and good job bringing the boys up on the water!!"
1507704,BornToFish,2012-11-27 13:56:00,1224,"LOW1 and Tackleman offered some great advice. There are MANY lodges throughout North West Ontario that are on great lakes full of fish. Every one that fishes on the Canada Shield has their favorite lodge and will freely recommend it to you. I encourage you to give careful consideration to what you and your sons will want during your vacation in order to have a good vacation together. Consider thinking about the types of cabins that you want, your fishing temperment (e.g. run and gun versus slow and deliberate), how far are you willing to drive, do you want American versus Housekeeping plans, what size of lake in terms of having to travel to fishing spots, are you comfortable boating on lakes with unmarked rock shoals, the type of boats/motors provided, guides and the like. Many, but not all, lodges in Ontario are family friendly. Weather tends to be as stable as it gets in mid-July to mid-August. Bugs tend to more tolerable after mid-July. Wherever you choose to go, be certain to set realistic expectations for your first trip on the Canada Shield. Otherwise, you may set yourselves up for disappointment. There are differences between lakes in the mid-west US and the Canada Shield. Understanding these differences and what to do about them is often the key to fishing success on the Shield. I hope that you and your sons have a wonderful experience."

1507771,fishmaster,2012-11-27 17:26:00,209,Sounds like you described a trip to Eagle Lake. Try www.vermilionbvaylodge.com You won't regret it
1507801,2746,2012-11-27 18:47:00,3206,"While it sounds like you have experience fishing BornToFish gives some good advice about expectations. No matter how good the canada lake is you still have to know where to look and how to present your bait. I learned that the hard way on my first trip to Canada on a fly in over 40 years ago with my boys. The fish didn't jump into the boat the first day and it took some learning. For that reason, going to a good drive in with a camp owner that will take a little time to get you on fish is worth the effort. I can't count the number of times we've met first timers on our trips that were getting skunked while the rest of us were bringing in fish. Lots of enjoyment in helping them out and seeing the look of ""now I get it"" on their faces.....particularly when it involves a family. Consider a good camp and explain what you want for your boys before signing up. Most will help you out but you gotta ask."
1507839,castnblast,2012-11-27 20:02:00,111,"You could tow up that 14' boat and the three of you could tent camp on an island or beach. Alot of options, remote, cost effective, unique Canadian fishing experience. Can't beat it. Have a great trip with your kids...whatever you do!"
1507882,adempsey,2012-11-27 22:05:00,963,"Given your location, definitely head somewhere NW. Plenty of popular drive-to lakes and resorts.Sunset Country - http://www.ontariossunsetcountry.ca/accom.cfmNorth of Superior - http://www.nosta.on.ca/tourism.asp?page=29"
1507943,MrSimon,2012-11-28 07:51:00,922,"Along the lines of what others are saying ..... make sure to call the lodge and actually speak with the owner. Once you read reviews, check out the websites, and speak with the owners .... just pick the one that ""feels"" fright to you and go with it. Spending too much time obsessing over where to go will just leave you overwhelmed and frustrated. Most likely you can pick a great lodge without spending too much time in the research phase .... there are a whole lot more good lodges than bed ones in that part of Ontario. Once you and your boys get your first trip under your belt, you can start refining your criteria seeking out specific types of places."
1508018,LOW1,2012-11-28 11:27:00,2828,"Excellent advice, especially the PS section. And consider hiring a guide for at least the first day. He or she will give you much useful information which you can use for the rest of your trip. And get one that makes a shore lunch-your kids will remember that forever."
1508029,MrSimon,2012-11-28 12:10:00,922,"That is mostly good advice, but don't limit yourself to walleye and pike .... in fact, its a great idea to go to a lake with good quality smallmouth fishing. Smallies are easy to catch, jump a lot, and fight like tanks. They are an awesome fish for kids to target. You don't hear guys admit it too often, but smallies have saved many a day or trip when the eyes aren't biting."

2023978,Blades-n-Beads,2013-08-12 18:52:00,484,"Great advise from Tackleman. Make a list of top things you want on your trip, make a list of things you can do without. Number 1 for most is cost. What do you want to spend. A buddy and I take a cheap as you can go trip every June and sept to remote spot on Lac Seul, it's a blast. We go twice cause it fits our budget. I also go to Lake of the woods twice, July and in August once with my wife and older boys and daughter, the other with a big group. This is a nicer boat to camp with awesome cabins, meal plan, boats, etc. a lot more $$ but very relaxing. Great camp staff and fishing is out of this world. Make yourself a list and start another thread with your top ten your wishing for. There are a bunch of great people here just waiting to help you pick some really great places for you and your family. It's crazy how far this site reaches. Good luck."
2026170,Guest,2013-08-13 15:57:00,0,Sorry to hear that your trip was not great. From many different camps I can only say that is the exception not the rule and every business has the good and bad operators. Most camps ill go out of their way to accommodate first time customers. Hope this doe not prevent yu from trying again.
1508013,Guest,2012-11-28 11:04:00,0,"Picking a Canadian Fishing resort  where to start. First off, we know you're talking about a Canadian Shield lake and will probably want to go to NW Ontario or Eastern Manitoba. OK, we've narrowed it down to about a half million lakes. Now let's analyze your search criteria to narrow it down some more. A drive to lake is a good option because; its less expensive than a fly in, you can bring more stuff, you can bring your own boat option and often (not always) the resorts have more amenities I assume another adult with fishing and boating experience will be joining you and your sons. That means at least two boats (so you will have to rent at least one). As you already know, a 14 footer is a tad small for larger waters, so that will limit your search. I love Lac Seul, but I wouldn't want you to get caught far from the lodge when the lake kicks up. Keep in mind that rental boats usually do not include trolling motors, depthfinders, rod holders, etc. You will have to provide portable equipment. Walkie talkies are fun and useful. Consider targeting fewer species Being your first trip there will be a learning curve  meaning not catching fish until you get it figured out. It might take a day and then hopefully hot action. Once you start catching em, you won't want to say, OK boys, let's stop this fun and not catch any more fish for a while until I can get a new pattern figured out. Kids might mutiny. Pike and walleye are usually found in the same area, and often on the same lures. Less tackle simplifies things (costs, room in boat ). These two species will make you resort search much easier. A winning week would be catching a boatload of wallies, hammerhandle pike for more fast action and big lures for giant pike. You can jig, cast or troll  whatever the fish want and the kids can handle. As the week goes on, the boys will need less support from you making you week easier and more fun for them. They might start suggesting fishing sport or lures. Sounds like your bluegill bustin boys already can cast and bobber fish. They will also need to know how to keep a lure (jig, spoon) off of the bottom when casting or jigging. Trolling spinner rigs is easy and effective. While I haven't been able to recommend any particular resort, we're narrowed it down your search criteria to:  Drive to resort on Ontario/Manitoba  Walleye and Pike  Boat rental at least 16'  Convience. You and the other adult have a ton of ""work"" to do. Finding fish, reading maps, prepping boats, tackle, fixing meals, cleaning, safety. A rental boat waiting for you at a good dock is great. Confortable cabin, good equipped kitchen. Try searching the archives here on walleye central for comments on the various fishing resorts. You can also search the web. The fishing shows have gotten pretty weak. Many good lodges don't participate any more due to repeat and referral business. The sooner you try to book a trip, the better your chances of getting a good week are. Try to book a trip before January. You'll need a letter from Mama giving you permission to take the boys out of the country. The border agents will be asking. PS  Don't forget to let the kids be kids and have some non-fishing fun. Check out the beaver dam, explore on shore, play with the minnows, drive the boat, etc. It's not a tournament, it is a great father /son vacation meant to be fun and full of memories. Maybe take a $50 and say goodbye to it. Buy some lures with it and expect them to get lost due to snags, bite offs, stray casts into trees and who knows what. Maybe buy a duplicate or two to avoid heartache."
1507585,helle29260,2012-11-27 08:22:00,4,"Here is the deal, I have two sons that love to fish the small lakes of Southwest Wisconsin. They are old enough now to take them on a Canadian fishing trip. We are looking for a remote drive in lake with access to other lakes. We plan on going up in late July early August. We want to hit the walleye, pike, perch and maybe some lake trout. I really just want to give them the opportunity to catch some fish. Remember a good day at an area lake in SW WI is catching 20 4-6 sunfish. We have our own boat 14' Lund but I guess I would rather rent a boat. There would be 4-6 in our party. I have done some research but honestly don't know where to start. I have a buddy that swears by the forum so please help."

He is now in college and we will have to plan around both our schedules. Lac Seul is a large lake but there are tons of places to fish where you don't need to get on big water if the weather is threatening. Fishing that time of year is great for walleye, pike and smallouth - lake trout, not so much. The cabins and boat are all first rate. Give Rod or Lorita a call, they may have an opening."

But in order to see what you are needing and can afford,. a little research is needed. go to google and for our area, Northwestern Ontario, you could probably type in ""Sunset Country,"" and get a pile of results, then pull out a map and see how far you want to drive for your Canadian experience. Let me tell you that going to a remote lake, isn't all it's cracked up to be, i've fished some remote and even fly in lakes that can't hold a candle to some of the road access lakes in this part of Ontario.I've also researched several lodges in the area and there is a large difference in pricing so make a chart and compare to get the best bang for your dollar.good luck."
