2022706,pikeandtina,2013-08-12 10:40:00,145,"Snowpro, We stayed there in 2011. We thought it was slightly overpriced ($90-100 w/tax per room), but it was clean. I saved their business card so that we could stay there again when in the neighborhood, so must've been satisfactory, LOL! Btw, there's a great bbq place nearby which I would highly recommend...good food! John"

2022898,jimmie,2013-08-12 11:31:00,123,Pine grove just east a few blocks is okay too. Have stayed there many times over the years. Have motel rooms and cabins to rent 1-807-227-2013! Nice family run deal. Just a few dollars cheaper I think.
