Turned out that my buddy got his passport in the mail the day before we left, so it was not an issue! Our biggest walleye for the week was right at 26"", but we caught 13 other fish between 25 and 25 1/2 and countless fish over 20"". We never had any 100 fish days in the boat, but we averaged about 30-40 fish per day (3 guys) and the overall size was better than I had experienced in past trips. We didn't catch as many northerns as we had in the past, with the largest one of them being around 34"". We did most of our fishing on a reef, northwest of pine island, in 33 to 40 feet of water, with leeches on a fairly long snell and a floating bead. We stayed at Carol's Cabins and were happy with our accommodations. Oldccm told me in a different post that some of his friends would be staying at Carols Cabins during the same period. We were fortunate enough to meet Vic, Jim and their wives and had a great time being neighbors with them for a week. Good bunch of people. Turns out that my son and I have an ice fishing trip planned to Lake Winnipeg next March and they both fish it regularly and will probably be able to help us out on our first trip up there! In all, we had a great time and are looking forward to next year."

The walleye's were healthy. Looks like they spent too much time watching football and drinking beer...they all had that big gut hanging out there. LOL Real quality fish. You might want to buy your leeches before arriving at the lake as they get a premium for them there. The area has way too many good areas for a weeks worth of fishing. Someday we'll go back for a couple weeks...but we still won't hit them all. Good luck everyone."
