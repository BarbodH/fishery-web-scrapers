Going June 19-25 for Wifeys 50th Birthday she has never done a trip to Canada, we have passports and no criminal records so should be good to go mainly wondering about bait availability there, best tactics that time of year, any HOT SPOTS you want to share LOL Thanks in advance"
1199390,Bill Krejca,2010-05-11 19:52:00,6107,"I have not fished Jan, but for a number of years, I stayed at the campground across the road. At that time, the camp was called Bayview, on Mirond Lake. It had a beautiful campground high above the water. My favorite bait was a black and white feathered jig, usually 1/4 oz, tipped with a walleye gullet or strip of belly meat. At that time it was legal. I believe Jan flows into Mirond. The narrows, much like a stream, was a good place to catch walleyes from shore. Let us know how you do. Bill Krejca"
1199518,jwhite58502,2010-05-12 07:42:00,199,Thanks for the tip(s) Will report back anyone else?
1199535,oldblue2008,2010-05-12 08:44:00,313,"fished Jan for about 10 years, last time 2008. always stayed at Jan Lake Lodgehttp://janlakelodge.ca/ probably nicest place there. can't use live minnows in Sask. and only leeches purchased in Sask. Can bring nightcrawlers from ND, if they are packaged in something other than soil.. We have never found live bait in Jan, so buy your leeches somewhere south. Lake is quite rocky, so be aware. A very pretty lake, good walleye, but we always went early June. have fun."
1199568,jwhite58502,2010-05-12 09:48:00,199,"Thanks for the info on the leeches and crawlers, they say water is down so am going to go real SLOW since I will be at a new lake sounds like lots of reefs/rockpiles Thanks again"
1215505,jwhite58502,2010-07-02 15:46:00,199,"Well we went week of 6/19 and had a great time at Three Lakes Camp lots of 50-75 Walleye fish days off of jigs on windblown points and rock bottoms. Windblown is overstatement had great weather and wind wasn't at most 10mph on any given day so it was a great trip. One day wind quit completely/glass surface pulled out crankbaits and went casting back bays for PIKE and caught over 125 that day mostly 18-24 inchers with one over 30 and the biggest was 40 1/2 inches caught and released. Walleyes liked yellow jigs crawlers, and mango ripple gulp, pike loved shad raps #9 and # 11 floaters and #5 SRS, most colors but LOVED Firetiger and Citrus/Pearl. Great weather/fishing/and hosts will definintely go back. Thanks to Three Lakes Camp Ryan and Jasmine."
1216486,oldblue2008,2010-07-06 13:59:00,313,"How was Three Lakes Camp?? was the wife satisfied with accomodations? Glad to hear the wind did not get up, it can get pretty rough on the main parts of the lake at times. Was the water level down, according to locals."
1221553,Trev,2010-07-22 13:58:00,8,"Jan lake is down from a few years ago, I would say it is at normal levels this year.A jighead with a minnow is all I have ever used there and I have always had as much success as the next guy. Always say I am going to try for big Pike, but never seem to get around to it.Just got back from there on july 10. Fishing was decent for july, didn't try too hard (family vacation with 2 kids and a wife lol) and we were able to limit out."
1221563,uzzi,2010-07-22 14:31:00,349,"Wish I'd seen this sooner. I fish Jan twice a year for the past 15 years. Awesome place to go. Have stayed at 3Lakes and JLL. JLL has nicer accomodations, but they are starting to show their age. The owners/staff at 3 lakes are always friendly and helpful. Inlaws have their camper at 3 lakes all summer and they go back and forth. I am heading up there on Aug long with my 2 boys, they love the trip as well, great fishing, great times, beautiful country."
1444816,garnet/barb,2012-06-04 18:38:00,1,hi i am sure you will like fishing at jan lake we have fished they 3 times this season as we have a trailer in the campground. fishing has been slow so far but i am sure it will get good real soon. three lakes camp is very good and they have bait at the store. we us jig heads and a mirrow that seam to work for us. i am sure your wife will enjoy her b'day at jan lake.as for where to go the second narrow is good but the camp will help you with that as where the fish are at that time of the month/day you just never know (lolLOl). so have fun fishing and a happy b'day to your wife
