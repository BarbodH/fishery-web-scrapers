2024554,Troy Mansfield,2013-08-12 22:36:00,22,"LUP means Land Use Permit. It's a permit from the MNR, outfitters have them for outpost camps which usually are classified as commercial LUP or consumptive. And people can aquire or buy a cabin on the lake that's a LUP but if its not already a resort of if its not designated commercial or consumptive you can't rent it or outfit and that's usually where the outfitters license comes in With a LUP you don't own the land, you just own any structures on it. This usually is referred to ""the 99 year lease""."
2029290,115 optimax,2013-08-14 17:50:00,650,Are you talking about the cabins with the old steam train on the point?..
2030498,ScottL,2013-08-15 07:47:00,733,"Yup, that is the one I'm talking about. I think that is actually a garbage burner designed to look like a steamer."
2032154,115 optimax,2013-08-15 20:13:00,650,"One of the cabins used to belong to my ex-girlfriend's dad.We spent a lot of time out there in the summer and made a few trips in the winter.He owned the smaller log one.A bear broke into the cabin and destroyed the inside so he built a new one and used Solar power instead of lugging the giant Suzuki generator around.After his Daughters moved away he didn't go out there as much so he sold it.Seen some giant Muskie over the years out there!We also used to go to the giant sand banks down the lake and climb them.Lots of fun out there!! I remember catching tons of Walleye off the end of the floating dock just before dark all of the time,it was unreal.I sure miss those days(1992 -1999)"
2009185,Warrior56215,2013-08-05 21:22:00,46,Wondering if anyone knows if the cabin at McClean's Narrows is available to rent?
2013034,Woollybob,2013-08-07 11:59:00,158,Not legally at least... It's a private cabin - cannot rent without an outfitter license. Not like the US where anyone can rent their cabin out. I saw (I presume) the owner on the dock once - still regret not stopping to ask him his price... Great location.
2013042,bigwalleye1,2013-08-07 12:03:00,2632,"I have dreams about that cabin.... Woollybob, you better see him again before I do. C'mon, lottery tickets!!!!!!!!"
2014977,ScottL,2013-08-08 07:48:00,733,"I've wondered the same thing. This summer when I came by, there were people and luggage on the dock and it looked like one of the big unpainted aluminum boats that the lodges use to transport customers was at the dock either loading or unloading. Makes me think that one of the resorts must lease it. I should have stopped and inquired. Either way that is a great spot."
2015129,v-bay gord,2013-08-08 08:49:00,3168,"Unfortunately there is no such thing as an ""outfitters license"" anymore."
2017874,Woollybob,2013-08-09 11:59:00,158,"If it is an outfitter that leases it, they do a terrible job making it known. I have countless hours into finding every known lodging spot on the East end of Lac Seul. I believe it's a old private cabin that has been grandfathered in.If I see anyone up there next week, I will definitely stop this time"
2021810,scar,2013-08-11 21:26:00,196,I went by the cabin yesterday and was impressed with it. Fishing was superb in that area from 9am - 2 pm and then the wind turned unbearable. I am pretty sure that it is an outpost cabin owned by a resort.
2023874,BenBeattie,2013-08-12 17:55:00,232,I'm positive that neither of the cabins in McClean Narrows are outpost cabins owned by a resort.
2024418,Troy Mansfield,2013-08-12 21:31:00,22,"That cabin belongs to a local doctor from sioux lookout. It's not a LUP for consumptive use of natural resources, so it cannot be rented"
2024490,ScottL,2013-08-12 22:09:00,733,I've never heard that term. What does that mean?
