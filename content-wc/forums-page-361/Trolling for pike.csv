2021298,reconssd,2013-08-11 17:12:00,147,"I would definitely do a leader. In the past, I have done Tygear, and Fluorocarbon. This year, based on a couple recommendations on WC, I used a product called AFW Surflon Micro Supreme. I had two leader failures this year with this product. I went back to fluorocarbon and didn't have a single problem. I would never fish for pike without some kind of leader."
2023354,lassh,2013-08-12 13:58:00,553,Could you please explain what type of failures occurred? Where did the Surflon failures occur? Did you use knots or crimps? I appreciate the info as I have some leaders made with Surflon.
2023898,reconssd,2013-08-12 18:17:00,147,"First, let me say I have been making my own leaders for about 15 years. Failures occurred at the knot, and at the mid point of the leader. That was just my experience. My fishing partner had at least 3 failures with that product. 2 of the failures occurred while casting and he lost 2 buck tails. My #1 preference is fluorocarbon. Primary reason why it's my go to leader is because I have never had a failure."
2024210,zeebee,2013-08-12 20:17:00,1144,"I have been using the tiable surflon and Tuf-line with no issues. I crazy glue the knots and tie them with great care, starting over if it doesn't appear perfect."
2024802,Kevin R,2013-08-13 06:55:00,305,"I have lots of cut offs last couple years was using 17lb leader so upped to 30lb same thing cut offs. I have been very confused steel leaders have failed, mono leaders have failed & super lines cut fish when they roll up as they often do but catch fish."
2024978,MrSimon,2013-08-13 07:54:00,922,"Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've been using cheapo Eagle Claw 12"" steel leaders from Wal-Mart for 25 years and have never had a failure. They get twisted all to heck, but they don't break. Some of the higher end stuff looks nice, but at this point I don't see a reason to switch."
2025178,GWC,2013-08-13 08:49:00,1021,"I use 10 pound fireline or braid with either a bandit 200 or 300. I've caught several 40 to 46 inch pike on Gullrock Lake. Takes about 45 minutes for me to land one. I use one of my seven foot bait casting rods & troll for them. Walleye will hit bandit lures as well. Yes, I use a swivel snap but no leader. Have had no problems with them cutting the line. I do check the line for damage each time I catch anything with teeth & cut off anything that was nicked or damaged in the process.Corrected size, sorry about that. I've caught a number of pike & maybe I've been lucky. Yes, thinking back I've had a my line cut several times but I haven't found a steel leader that I like so far. What do you recommend?I normally fish for walleye when in Canada but a big pike is definately a bonus."
2026274,lassh,2013-08-13 16:38:00,553,"I think you meant 40 inchers. Those fish were likely hooked with the line outside of their mouths. Fireline and braids cut rather easily when they are pulled across pikes' teeth. Yes, I've landed big pike while fishing with 6# mono and a jig, but they were lip hooked. Use a leader with quality hardware unless you want to tell stories about the one that got away."
2012506,LAURASDAD,2013-08-07 08:33:00,19,"Hello,Will be on a Fly In trip in a few weeks in Ontario. Plan on trollilng LARGE jerk baits for large pike Some baits are 10"", some are 7"".Do you suggest using a snap swivel or tie directly? ThanksLarry"
2012530,octanehi5,2013-08-07 08:38:00,1104,suggest steel leader
2012562,chico,2013-08-07 08:47:00,506,Trolled 11'' Rapalas and landed a #16 and #23 on the weekend along with a bunch of smaller ones this weekend. Snaps is not the critical question but speed.Did not have any luck until I hit speeds from 2.8-3.2 which is faster than I have ever trolled.Good Luck Chico.
2013450,brochet,2013-08-07 14:50:00,88,"cant beat a 4 inch spoon,6inch steel leader,if your fishing lakes with low fishing pressure,such as a fly in.i caught many large pike up to 52""."
2013522,pitbull,2013-08-07 15:26:00,45,"I have always used steel leaders attached to snap swivel, helps to prevent line twist and not as big chance to loose. Remember those large teeth. Catch a BIGIN"
2014489,zeebee,2013-08-07 22:38:00,1144,This time of year I target NP's in depths of 15-25ft when trolling. One of my favorite lure is the deep husky jerk in the large size...# 12.
2017586,pike50plus,2013-08-09 09:49:00,584,"Totally agree on increasing speed when pike trolling! Even in heavy cabbage with large silver minnow spoons, I call it Power trolling!"
2018841,pikeman14,2013-08-10 06:32:00,144,I also agree with the speed comments. That's half the battle.I like the steel leaders with snap swivels. Shallow raiders/depth raiders did well for us this year. A nice lure to give a try.
2019049,Freytown,2013-08-10 08:45:00,770,One thing for sure is that northern pike are not fussy when hungry. I remember a trip to the Manicouagan reservoir (Quebec) back in the late 70's when a northern tried to eat a floating beer can multiple times.My best was a 23lb on a #5 Mepps trolling a shallow cove. My son's best was 25lbs on a 1/4oz jig w/twister tail. Ya never know!
2020818,walleyeduran,2013-08-11 11:30:00,286,"Agree with the leader, but I quit using steel yrs. ago. Go with a floro-carbon or titanium. Much more durable and will last 10 times longer than a steel leader getting the kinks."
