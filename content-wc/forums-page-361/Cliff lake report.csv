2032458,JayM5209,2013-08-15 22:09:00,1050,"craw, good luck on Cliff. It's one of my favorite lakes. I'll be just south of you on Eagle Lake the week you're there. Sorry I can't give you a current report. I was there the 1st week of the season, just six days after ice-out, and the fishing was slow. The next week I was with my annual group at a camp ten miles north of Cliff, but I went down to Cliff two days for lake trout fishing. It was some of the best laker fishing we've had in many years, both as to numbers and size. Hope someone can give you a more up to date report.Check out Lost Bay Resort's Facebook page for some pictures - https://www.facebook.com/lostbayresort?ref=ts"
