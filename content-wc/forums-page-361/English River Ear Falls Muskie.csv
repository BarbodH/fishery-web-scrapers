2029098,Bigstorm,2013-08-14 16:28:00,799,"I fish downriver from there (below Maynard Falls) every year and we have only ever seen 1 Musky caught and head of only a couple others in the past 10yrs. We have seen 50""+ nothern though"
2029162,BreezyPoint,2013-08-14 16:36:00,1581,Thanks for your response...I had thought there were quite a few musky in Oak and Maynard Lakes. I have also heard there are some good musky in Unexpected.

By my old maps that they had marked the major area was upriver from Unexpected through Wilcox & up the river almost to Goose Lake. Before you get into Goose my map is marked both sides for Musky. I think the one that was mounted in the case was 54""? Later, Jay"
