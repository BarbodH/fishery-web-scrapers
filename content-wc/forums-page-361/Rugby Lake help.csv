Might stay at a deer camp a few miles away, put boat in and pull it every day. I have bigger boat (2025 Pro-v). I have walleye fished many Canadian Lakes, but know nothing of this lake. Can anyone help with public ramp info, fishing info, map info, anything that might be helpful info, etc. Thanks !! Habitual Eyer"
