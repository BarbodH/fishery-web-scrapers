It seems there are mostly expensive main lodges catering to upscale clients in this area with some outposts for half the cost thrown in there. Unfortunately for us the fishing had shut down 2 weeks prior to that and was slow for everyone in the area, plus the water is pretty low and a forest fire closed at least one of the camps. Earlier in July it was really hot there and the water warmed up to a point that the fish went deep. We only managed 4 walleye all over 20"" and about 125 pike in 3 1/2 days of fishing. Only 5 pike were 35-40"" with the rest under that. There were many repeat customers at the lodge and one reported that a few weeks ago they had caught 2700 fish in 5 days at the outposts. Others reported similar results with as many as 3000 fish with 10-15 master Angler pike per person, with many walleye 22""-29"" caught on pike lures. So I guess it shows that even in far north waters lightly fished there can be slow periods, no matter how much you pay. It also takes about 3 hours to row a 17 ft boat 7 miles after hitting a rock, with a slight tailwind."

Just slowed down in that area for everyone, guides etc.... I did have 3 Master Angler fish on, but did not land them, just the 40 incher. Single hook barbless makes it tougher to get a hook in em. And some other guides reported some Master Angler pike landed as well in the area."
