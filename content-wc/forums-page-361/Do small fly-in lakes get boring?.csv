2024202,zeebee,2013-08-12 20:16:00,1144,"I prefer the larger lakes however when my boys were younger the smaller fly-ins were ideal. Variety of fish species, size and exploration opportunities are tied to the larger lakes in general. However, if its your first trip to the lake I'm sure you will thoroughly enjoy it."
2025802,MrSimon,2013-08-13 12:43:00,922,"Thanks for the replies. I changed our reservation to a larger lake, Quantz. Its still not a ""big"" lake by Ontario standards, but it should provide a lot more room to stretch out than Wanzatika. We will have six guys in three boats who like to explore, so I think this was the right decision. Not to mention Quantz is supposed to have much bigger pike! Thanks again for the input."
2026058,Mike Borger,2013-08-13 15:15:00,1554,Quantz is a great lake!
2022138,MrSimon,2013-08-12 07:26:00,922,"My group is used to fishing very large expansive lakes with limitless water to cover. We also like to fish lakes with access to smaller bush lakes. With that said, we booked a fly-in trip to Wanzatika Lake through Hearst Air. Its a very small lake .... not even 2 miles wide. With no access to other lakes. I have no doubt that the lake is filled with fish, and we would have fun catching them ..... but I'm a bit worried that the lake will feel too small for us ... we'll get bored ... or feel limited in our options. What do you guys think about fishing really small lakes on fly-ins? Thanks."
2022162,packpro,2013-08-12 07:53:00,695,"In a perfect setting you, I hope you have a variety of species and a variety of structure. Changing target species, or presentation tactics may keep the interest up."
2022290,Mike Borger,2013-08-12 08:45:00,1554,I have to admit I prefer larger water when I'm there for a week. The smaller lakes like Wanzatika are great for short trips as you really maximize your time. They're also really perfect for kids.Size of the lake aside the fly in experience alone is worth the price of admission.
2022578,Aaron-IN,2013-08-12 10:14:00,500,"I've been on a number of fly-ins over the years. One thing I like about the smaller lakes is they tend to be easier to fish and a lot of times more productive when you only have a short amount of time. I have a couple of ""favorites"" and have learned over the years to only book them for 4-5 days instead of a 7-10 days. Usually I'm so tired of catching fish by day 5 I'm ready to head home."
2022786,hoppy63,2013-08-12 10:52:00,367,"Aaron......tired of catching fish on a fly-in?????? You are a sick individual!!! Haha. I have only been fortunate enough to make one trip...(and got hooked), but we flew out of nakina to small lake..1 mile wide, 7 miles long I believe, but had access to two other lakes up, or down river if water levels allowed. Just can't imagine getting bored if you are catching.....there were so many finger bays to explore and the structures islands etc....small water was fine for me!"
2022882,dutchboy,2013-08-12 11:25:00,5717,"If you get bored then take a nap. It's a fly in vacation not a tournament. Enjoy yourself, try different techniques, baits, species."
2022890,adempsey,2013-08-12 11:27:00,963,"Well, I am getting tired of the large lakes lately. I spend half my time looking for fish! Of course, that can be half the fun, but some days it's incredibly frustrating. At least on a small lake I know I've tried my best and I can blame it on something else =)I think if I were to go to a relatively small lake, I'd like to have options with respect to fish species and perhaps some portage lakes or rivers to try out. Of course, maybe I just wouldn't fish 18 hours a day either....Also, looking forward to your report from Wanz. It's one of the lakes I was considering for next year."
2023050,Nimstug,2013-08-12 12:28:00,2605,You didn't say how long the lake is. Lets say it's 2 miles by 3.5 miles. 7 S.M. = about 4500 acres. I wouldn't mind having one of my local 4500 acre lakes to myself for a week.
2023306,lassh,2013-08-12 13:51:00,553,"If you really like fishing, you probably won't get bored on Wanzatika Lake if it is your first time on the lake. There looks like there are several large distinct bays, inflows and outflows etc. to explore. You can also concentrate on discovering mid lake structure etc. Try to find the larger eyes and pike, don't just sit on the smaller fish and you can stay busy fishing 14 hrs. a day for a week. I do prefer larger lakes than this one, but its not just a round lake. Not much for islands but hopefully there are humps etc. underwater. One advantage is that you are pretty close to the camp no matter where you are on the lake, so it makes for flexible fishing and eating schedules and not a lot of transit time. If you go year after year to a smaller lake, they tend to shrink and become repetitive but for a first time just thoroughly explore and have a great time!"
2024178,phishfearme,2013-08-12 20:07:00,1242,"Do small fly-in lakes get boring? YES!! and you cannot assume that if a lake is 4500 acres that it's all fishable. many lakes have expansive shallow flats that freeze solid on the winter and just don't hold many fish in the summer. this makes a small lake even smaller and you'll end up fishing the same spots over and over. of course the duration of your trip matters - for our 10 day trips we insist on a large lake (8-10 K acres)with a portage lake or two available. and it's generally accepted that smaller lakes do not produce larger fish or at best only a few of them. and, if you want a private lake (only cabin on the lake), larger lakes frequently have numerous cabins on them making selection even more challenging. the quest is fun though! phish"
