6642972,staker1875,2022-03-25 06:43:00,13,"So you are saying I should buy a new toy!? We do have 2 or so group backups which are of questionable quality so may look into an affordable backup jig stick. Interesting all the mono jiggers that have chimed in. I switched to braid last season and liked it, didn't seem to have any issues with hooksets etc with my XF action. Still use mono when ripping jigging raps."
6643002,Eckohlt,2022-03-25 08:43:00,3685,"I've used mono n braid for many years,but they don't even come close to nanofil from my point of view."
6643326,Mojo-NC,2022-03-26 14:27:00,1929,"I am, yes. I already have several back-up rods and reels to choose from, but if I didn't I would buy another. I'm with you. I love braid with a P-line Floroclear or fluorocarbon leader. The only application when I don't like braid is when ripping jigging raps. Too much line wrap around the rod tip."
6643372,RichA$1970,2022-03-26 17:31:00,1159,"Maybe for nostalgia but I always keep 1 spinning reel with mono as that’s what worked for years. If someone needs it, the simpler the better. I get laughed at deer hunting as I will take a recurve out some days based on the stand / draw I’m hunting. Sometimes less is more."
6643442,Eckohlt,2022-03-27 07:12:00,3685,"Recurve,,,last of the Mohicans."
6643460,RichA$1970,2022-03-27 09:06:00,1159,I use a late 50’s Ben Pearson recurve (my buddy Fred’s dad actually beat him to win the Arkansas state archery championship and they were friends for years) and then an old timer in Iowa built me a bubinga wood recurve in the mid 90’s that I need to get back shooting. I mostly use braid with Fluoro leaders but nothing wrong with mono and always have 1 reel on a trip with it.
6642692,staker1875,2022-03-24 08:05:00,13,"I've been going through my gear in preparation for my fly in trip this summer. Perhaps I am just itching for a new rod, but feel there is maybe a gap in my walleye rod lineup. We typically drift/drag/backtroll jigs in anywhere from 10-30 FOW, pull spinners, and last year had good success with jigging raps and cranks. Rarely do we set up for solely for vertical jigging. 6'8 MXF Eyecon - mainly used as jig rod for 3/8 oz on up & jigging raps 7'0 MLF Avid - primarily used as rigging/light BB rod - have used with jigs 6'6 MH Pike Rod Thinking the 6'8 is pretty stout for a jig rod and may be missing bites (also use it on Detroit River) and I don't have a dedicated crank casting rod. Thoughts on if I have a gap in my lineup or if my rods are sufficiently versatile for a fairly deep structure shield lake? I've looked into a 6'3 MLXF or 6'9MLXF, but not sure if those will yield anything better than what I have now. Appreciate the input!"
6642708,prov1900,2022-03-24 09:37:00,544,"Your MLF rod IMO would be better suited for jigging than for bottom bouncing. Your MXF definitely is good for jigging raps, but I might convert the heavier one to BB. Your Avid 7 should be perfect for casting cranks as well, however if you want to dedicate a rod to cranks, look at something with a little more glass in it for that softer parabolic bend."
6642714,bthomas3333,2022-03-24 10:11:00,465,Oh boy...Here comes the MLF jigging verses MXF jigging discussion that pops up every few years.My two cents which seems to be in the minority is that MXF allows you to transfer the bite to the handle with more sensitivity and the XF allows for a better slightly faster hook set.To each his own.Brett
6642738,staker1875,2022-03-24 11:02:00,13,"Thanks guys. I didn't buy any of these rods specifically with Canada in mind but sounds like maybe I am set. Probably overthinking things. Maybe I use the pike rod as a BB, the avid as an all around, and stick with my 68MXF as my primary jig rod. Brett - I agree with you on the MXF, you really do get immediate feedback from the line. Wife will be happy there isn't another rod showing up at the front door, unless some can sell me on something different."
6642744,maddogg,2022-03-24 11:16:00,178,Take what you have and use what you got. Enjoy your trip.
6642756,Net_Man,2022-03-24 11:47:00,580,"I think the type of line that is planned to be used should also play a role in the thought process. I personally do not like braid with a XF action rod. However, either F or XF actions are not the same from manufacture to manufacture or even between different models from the same manufacture."
6642762,bthomas3333,2022-03-24 11:58:00,465,Excellent point Net Man. I don't jig with braid. I either use Mono or 100% floro depending on depth and water clarity. Maybe for guys doing braid to a Floro leader the feel of ML/F works better. I have hundreds of days fishing MXF and MLF with mono veritical jigging and I prefer MXF for that specific application.Brett
6642788,RichA$1970,2022-03-24 14:45:00,1159,"Unless you want to boost the economy, you are set"
6642802,prov1800,2022-03-24 15:10:00,5010,"Went to braid long time ago.Will never go back to mono.Floura on a spinning reel is a nightmare.I use a med x fast 6'8"" mojo for about everything and when bass casting its a mojo mf.But must say a tournament 6'8"" ml is definitely worth it as my wife has one and I do use it and the weight and feel is something else"
6642918,Mojo-NC,2022-03-25 04:12:00,1929,"You are good to go as is. The rods I bring are very similar to yours, except I bring two baitcasting rods, one for casting and another for trolling spoons and crankbaits. You might consider bringing a replacement rod just in case. On our first fly-in, I broke a rod and my fishing buddy broke one and had another pulled overboard by a pike. That pike is probably still swimming around towing a St Croix Eyecon and a Shimano Sahara. By weeks end, he was down to 2 rods; I had 3. It never hurts to be prepared if you have room in your rod carrier to bring an extra."
