6645522,Jwendt15,2022-04-04 20:09:00,72,We’re heading up to Onaway at the end of May and counting the days. I’ve always considered trying to get a transom mount trolling motor to bring along. The boat we will have for the week is an 18ft Lund with a 70hp motor. Minn Kota had a 55lb thrust motor for around $250. Seems like that is the highest thrust you can get on a transom mount. Anyone have luck using something like that on a similar boat? I imagine it would be underpowered but would it still be manageable?
