6642638,ukats18,2022-03-24 04:25:00,4,"Been to Scott Lake Lodge, fantastic fishing, with Spa treatments and Eco tours (musk ox sightings in the tundra etc…) wine at dinner, with choices like filet mignon or duck l’orange. Then a slide show of the trophies caught that day by the guests (this can be long).If money is no object, then that would be the place."
6642646,Eckohlt,2022-03-24 05:04:00,3685,"I'm glad my wife likes to go out and piss pound the eyes,I'll be the spa guy for her."
6642674,fishron,2022-03-24 06:32:00,317,"I have never stayed at the Opinicon but I've toured the hotel and grounds. It's on the Rideau waterway in Southern Ontario. Stunning old Wood lodge from a bygone era. Somehow this one didn't burn down. Fishing is bass, pike, panfish. Wallye would be a surprise. This canal-side resort in a 19th-century former boarding house, offering cottages in a private grove, is 8.4 km from Highway 15. All cottages are warmly furnished and have minifridges. Some feature fireplaces. Free Wi-Fi. There's an heated outdoor pool and hot tub, as well as a pub, restaurant and a seasonal ice cream café & patio. Kayaks, canoes and stand-up paddle boards are available. Event spaces can host up to 100 people. Nearby Westport is an interesting tourist town. Not far to get a Thousand Island tour and there is a Casino near Gananoque Good Luck"
6642742,maddogg,2022-03-24 11:13:00,178,It all depends upon your mate.I would hope you know her pretty well. Does she like to rough it a bit or does she need pampering? It makes the difference between a good trip or a trip from you know were.
6642874,Springstead,2022-03-24 20:19:00,12,Check www.totemresorts.com They have a number of resorts and it sounds like their Wiley point lodge has amenities above and beyond typical. I've never been there. Maybe search this forum or maybe others can comment. I was looking into this for my wife and I and maybe our pups. Good luck!

6642562,ErieTroller1958,2022-03-23 16:26:00,23,"Without doing a rehash of the ""favorite Canadian trip ever"" thread, what's your best fishing lodge in Canada that also caters to the non-fishing adult female? I'm talking amenities that you might find on a cruise ship. I'd love to book a place where my son & I could spend the day catching walleye and the wife & daughter-in-law can enjoy a day at the spa or something similar."
6642568,Eckohlt,2022-03-23 16:36:00,3685,Now that's a tough one.
6642570,adempsey2.0,2022-03-23 16:40:00,611,Probably cheaper [and better] to book two separate trips.
6642574,Fisherman Ted,2022-03-23 16:56:00,461,"I agree with that. Especially if you are looking for some really high quality fishing that will potentially put you in a more remote setting. The more remote the fewer tanning salons, spas and nail salons. Tough mix. A spa? That might be tough. Now, if you were going to Cabo that could work. Stay at the Ritz. With Spa while the boys go out on the 54 foot Viking. But Canada would be a little tougher. Maybe out in the Vancouver area or some place near a major city? -FT"
6642580,SweetD,2022-03-23 18:28:00,243,"Maybe Wollaston Lake Lodge in Saskatchewan. Chef prepared meals, Guided fishing, and an onsite masseuse. Never been and probably never will but if that is what you are looking for and willing to pay for it might be the ticket.Good luck"
6642582,prov1800,2022-03-23 18:39:00,5010,Agree with that or a fancy lodge in BC like Painters Lodge very close to Campbell River.All amenities.Lodge has everything.Fishing charters at there dock.Pretty awesome place.Qe went in Sept and caught a lot of salmon along the Campbell River.short walk off highway.
6642588,bthomas3333,2022-03-23 19:02:00,465,"Well there are three I know have spas. The prices are crazy but if what you want is just a spa experience in the Canadian wilderness... Scott Lake Lodge North Have Resort Wollaston Lake Lodge I have no experience with any of the above. If I was trying to spoil the wife and daughter...I would just send them on a trip to a nice hotel in Hawaii while I fished somewhere with fantastic fishing during the same week. I think it might be cheaper, easier, and less risky that something goes sideways like the one spa employee takes a week off or something, but the above lodges have the services you asked about. Brett"
6642596,Baseline,2022-03-23 19:56:00,3207,"My recommendation isn't going to be catching walleyes, but you need to book an Alaskan cruise. Fishing charters for you during the day and they roam the ship or do a land tour at your port stop. Eat, drink and be merry at night Another alternative would bee Door County WI or a tourist area along Lake Erie."
6642614,bbheli,2022-03-23 20:50:00,1387,"Lake St.Clair, Canada Side, Rent an airbnb, Send them off with spa and shopping passes for the afternoon."
6642618,Yellowfin123,2022-03-23 21:07:00,2182,"yea i gota agree with this, i cant think of a resort up north that would work for my girls, wife and 3 daughter in laws, you can go around to the quiet east cape, boys have a ball in 28-34ft sportfishers with fly bridge, girls can beach and and sip umbrella drinks by the pool, everybodys happy and its cheaper than way up north, cold and bugs wont work for my crew, bummer!!"
