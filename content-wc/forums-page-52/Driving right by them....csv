6643358,That Minnesota guy,2022-03-26 16:35:00,8293,If it was about catching fish I guess where I decided to park would matter. But it's not & it doesn't.
6643370,RichA$1970,2022-03-26 17:26:00,1159,"I usually don’t fish the huge lakes so I troll to where I want to end up. It does take awhile as I will hit islands or reefs on the way, but it’s not a race and the lake is the main attraction of the trip."
6643378,prov1800,2022-03-26 17:49:00,5010,No matter what your a happy dude.
6643380,prov1800,2022-03-26 17:54:00,5010,I find no matter where I fish wether big lakes or small ones you never have to go far.
6643382,Obabikon,2022-03-26 18:19:00,2370,"I do like this topic. We certainly all have had these thoughts. Without a doubt, we drive by LOADS of hungry fish every single day. Is it worth it? Absolutely... When I fish a spot, I spend a lot of time reflecting on the amazing memories I have had there. Conversations with wonderful friends. I can remember finding humps out in the middle ""triangulating"" with my Dad. I remember teaching my daughters how to drive a boat. I regularly fish the spot that my little boy (4 at the time) caught a 28"" walleye by himself. I remember telling my little girl ""you've got this one on your own"" when my oldest daughter was asking for help with a big pike... 8 at the time (measured 37""). Now she's 14 and throws musky baits, and has a better figure 8 than most of our guests. Every now and then, I try new spots. Maybe hoping to catch a little magic in the bottle or create a new memory. But really... my spots are mine, not because I'm the only one allowed to fish them... but because nobody can take those moments away from me! Those moments are why I love fishing, and why I love Lake of the Woods. They're the best moments of my life... and worth the extra drive!"
6643384,muskyman73,2022-03-26 18:35:00,401,That's what I love about Canada. Every spot has a family member tag to it. That's where the musky bit me. That's where my cousin caught the biggest rock bass ever. That's the reef named after my uncle and his son - both of whom hit it doin 40. That's the cove where my cousin ate a leech for 20 bucks. 3 months and counting .........
6643390,Golden Eagle,2022-03-26 19:09:00,2642,"When the wind is blowing in, the dock can be a great fishing spot."
6643494,MikeAnkeny,2022-03-27 09:57:00,67,"From Ear Falls to where I want to go in McKenzie and back probably burn $50 of gas. Divided by three in the boat we're talking less than two beers at the ball game. No big deal. That being said I am sure we passed up 50 good spots,"
6643504,Eckohlt,2022-03-27 10:23:00,3685,"Now that you know you went by 50 good spots stop and fish them,then you'll have enough money for 3 beers at a ball game."
6643544,prov1800,2022-03-27 15:18:00,5010,More like hundreds.lol.
6643298,Pooch,2022-03-26 11:12:00,4618,"In another thread Prov1800 mentioned stopping at spots instead of driving by them all the time. Got me to reflecting. Every time I'm boating a long distance to get to a particular spot I think of all the ""sweet spots"" I'm driving past because I've not taken the time to look an area over. Driving past good fishing just to get to good fishing. My favorite fishing comes in little obscure spots that others drive by all day long. I've been fishing river systems with camps on both ends and meet guys from the other end of the lake headed to ""our end"" of the lake to fish while we are headed to ""their end"" of the lake to fish. I always scratch my head and go ""huh?"". Am I the only one who thinks about this stuff? My brain is more than ready for trips north....... Pooch"
6643304,Walleye2242,2022-03-26 11:37:00,263,"Great topic. We stayed at a different camp this year on a lake we always fish. Of course being on a different part of the lake we have our sweet spots that we would travel too everyday. 1 day we were just relaxing on the drive back to camp and my buddy looked at me as we drove past island after island and said....i wonder how many spots we fly by everyday just to go to the spots we know. I stopped and looked around and said....probably a ton. So i rolled up to a random island...found a nice point drop off from like 8 feet down to 25 feet and sat there and jigged up walleye in 18-22 foot. probably 100 more spots i flew past everyday just to go to where we ""know."""
6643316,prov1800,2022-03-26 12:46:00,5010,It's amazing what you can find.I fish a area on Lac Suel headed out of Onaway and head toward steam boat narrows but don't go that far but from where I stop and fish I see 50 + boats going by from Earfalls heading to McKenzie Bay.lol.Now that's nuts cause I have guided from Earfalls and catch alk kinds at that end of the lake.LOL.
6643322,Pooch,2022-03-26 13:47:00,4618,"At times I've done well in McKenzie Bay, but it is over rated and there are usually boats camped out on every little rock pile, sand bar, point, etc.. I usually avoid it as the whole bay is ""public spots"". Nice area to fish, but usually feels crowded to me. At any moment you look up there are several boats in transit coming and going. I learned that there are catch-able fish pretty much every where on most all Canadian lakes. You just have to stop fishing memories and go look around for new scenery. Pooch"
6643324,prov1800,2022-03-26 14:24:00,5010,I just don't go there period havnt for years.To many boats.Its a long way back in there and I can travell same distance toward Earfalls and catch just as many and no boats.Love going to Broad and sunlight and I have guests that want me to take them there but that's turned into a circus back there to.Glad I've done my homework and can fish without seeing a boat.
6643328,Golden Eagle,2022-03-26 14:41:00,2642,"Our local university fishing team was entered in a fishing tournament a few years ago. OB motor quit less than half a mile from the dock. Yep, they won the first place trophy. Made it back to the dock with the electric motor for the weigh in."
6643334,prov1800,2022-03-26 14:59:00,5010,Good for them
6643336,Mojo-NC,2022-03-26 15:19:00,1929,"Great topic! I think it might be kinda like the ""you can't vacation near home mentality"", even when you live near a place where others come to vacation. Most guys seem to want to fish far away from camp. When you fish a lake that you've been to several/many times, you can always identify the places where many boats congregate. We often like to try to find other places where it is more secluded, even if we end up catching fewer fish. We like to pull spinner rigs in the depth zone where fish are currently being caught along places where others do not usually fish. Once we catch a few, we go back and try to pick the area apart with jigs. We've found a few really good spots using that method. One year in particular we were going from one location to another and I happened to be looking at the fishfinder and noticed that we just drove over a hump that we didn't know was there. We went back and fished it while it was windy and h3ll and fairly quickly caught about 25 walleyes in about an hour while struggling to keep the boat on/near the hump. We went back and picked it apart later that evening after the winds laid down and set a few waypoints. Now we can go right to it. I'm sure there are a bunch of other similar places on the lake we still don't know about."
6643338,Bill Krejca,2022-03-26 15:20:00,6107,"Yeah, one of the best eater walleye spots on LOW was right in front of the camp, another spot in front of another camp always shows fish in the bay on the depth finder. Generally, tho, my observation has been that the best fishing to be farthest from an access point, it just normally getting the least pressure. So many factors to consider, so little time! Bill"
6643342,prov1800,2022-03-26 15:33:00,5010,Bill when I woukd being my boat to Sioux lookout and launch at deception launch there can be 50 plus trucks and trailers parked there.Its about 5 mi across deceotion before turning to go north.so close to the access and not a boat in sight yet some if the best fishing you can imagine.Where I out in on Lac Suel north of my house I rarely go farther the 3 mi to fantastic fishing with my wife.Guests want to go further but generally I don't need to go far.good to know close spots this year with fuel costs here.
