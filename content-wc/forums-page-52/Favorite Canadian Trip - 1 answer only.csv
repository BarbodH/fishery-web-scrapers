Couldn't wait to go back and have every year since...except for **** covid years and cant wait to get back there in 84 days......"
6643254,pjshorthorn,2022-03-26 06:18:00,5654,"I've run by Hole -in - The Wall so many times and never stopped there. I bet the fishing is great in there. Yeah.....Bear Narrows is a bit further north than Banana Island....LOL. I've often wondered how many millions of walleyes I have boated over going up to where we fish. It is hard to believe that this Lac Seul journey for me started 40 years ago this season. I'll make sure to wave at Deception Light, Banana Island and Bear Narrows as we pass them this July. Best wishes, PjShorthorn"

6643268,prov1800,2022-03-26 07:53:00,5010,I have a lot of friends up in Sioux lookout that have taken me fishing from deception bay but have always bloated past the rags before we would start to fish for walleye or muskie.On one of my many trips to Sioux I put my boat in at deception and told myself I was just going to fish the deception area for both species.I was pleasantly surprised to find one walleye spot after the other as well as Hole in the wall.Its amazing how big it is once you putt in there.Huge weed beds in there in fairly deep water and full of fish.Caught 2 muskies in there that day as well and one more back on the deception side on a rock pike just past hole in the wall.Nobody really fishes that area it seems as all the boats I saw travelled through that area without stopping.Also checked oùt the zig zag area one day and also had great fishing through there.

Returned thru 1968, along with grandparents, relatives and/or friends. Frank and Eleanor were superb, always helpful and fun- loving. The walleye fishing was spectacular. I still remember the layout of the lake and the spots we caught the most, or largest fish. College and work ended our annual trips, darn it!"
6644900,tly,2022-04-01 13:03:00,1900,"It turned out to be more of a camping trip because a front shut everything down. Impromptu planning, a crude map from friends who had been kind of in the area earlier in the year and it was LATE in the year. Three of us went for a 3 day adventure. Got some further advice from Ken Robbins, who had the bait shop & gas pump on the highway. Have done alot with him since also. Missed the designated islands, chugged around and found Taylor so we set up camp there. 2nd night it started with rain, changing to snow. A night I wouldn't trade for anything. Like Currier & Ives. Tarp to shield wind, a roaring fire, steaks/spuds/wine and large snow flakes to set off the scene. In AM the boat had washed well up on shore and a mess getting loaded, fuel was considered an issue since we wasted alot going out. Never was happier to see Deception."

6641796,SweetD,2022-03-20 19:06:00,243,"First Fly In to Joyce Lake Outpost with my dad (passed last March) and my brother nearly 30 years ago. Booi’s ran the camp. It was a pretty run down camp compared to today’s standards. No running water, saggy beds, partially leaking propane stove and a black bag hanging from a tree to shower under. Funny thing is we didn’t know any better and had the most spectacular fishing we had ever experienced and man we were novices!!! We literally fished with 1 oz daredevil spoons the entire week and mostly slowly trolled around the lake. To this day was our best Pike fishing trip we have ever had for fish over 40”. Literally caught 10+!!!! We also boated piles of Walleye on the Devils &#x1f60e; It was truly one of the best weather weeks we have experienced in my over 30 years going North now. At night we slept in the saggy back breaking beds like babies with the exception of the mice scurrying about on the counters doing their best to tear out the bottom of every box and bag of food we had brought. Who cares, we thought as we had plenty of fish to eat. What a week and one I think about often especially now that my partner (my Pops) for that trip and so many that followed has exited for greener pastures and clearer blue waters. I sure hope he continues to enjoy whatever fishing excursions are available with the big man upstairs! I will never forget that 1st trip into the bush with my Pops and my brother as it set the stage for a lifetime of great times North of the border exploring spectacular scenery, fishing and comraderie that cannot be matched anywhere else on earth (maybe in heaven????).Until we meet again Pops!!!!"

6642372,Jwendt15,2022-03-23 07:00:00,72,"2019 - Onaway Lodge. We had 8 of our family and closest friends, just the perfect group. Fishing was incredible all week. There was the exception of about a 24 hour period where the biting just died for everyone. After fishing for hours and catching nothing, we tried one last spot on Broad Lake. For the next hour, we experienced walleye fishing that I never had in my life. About 60 walleye netted between the three of us and most were slot and over. It was getting late, but with fishing that good, we just couldn't leave. Ended up navigating the creek leading to Broad in the dark (very stupid, I know) and made it back to camp with the biggest smiles on our faces. That night it was myself, my dad and cousin in that boat. Unfortunately we lost my dad to COVID in 2021. Still hard to believe that was my last trip with him. No one in our group loved those trips more than he. There will be many more in the future, but I'll never forget that last round we had with him."

6643208,Jabs,2022-03-25 17:52:00,24,"That was our first year too. On the opener, we made it as far as Hole in the wall on deception. Never had to go any further. There was 13 of us. Now there is just 2 of us. Then going to Deception light point was an hour to get to. Now it's 20 minutes. We went to what we thought was Bear narrows, It ended up being Banana island. We were running out of gas and had to turn around. Now we can go to perch ripple or past the mission.39 years later I can't feel more blessed being able to go every year but two thanks to Covid."
6643210,Fisherman Ted,2022-03-25 17:57:00,461,"I was 16 (decades ago) and went to camp Wabun, a camp on lake Temagami. You canoe for 8 weeks, into the wilderness. Never see another person. Portage miles through deer trails. Carrying all your food for 2 months. Shoot the rapids. Go all the way into Hudson Bay. 1,200 miles paddling. In God's country. That's when I fell in love. Fishing lakes few if any had ever seen. I remember one lake where we threw lines in and didn't catch a pike less than 40 inches. For over an hour. The world could have blown itself up and I would have never known, or cared. Fast forward 40 years and I will never leave this place...... -FT"

We spent our normal 8 days on Donald and crushed 'eyes, snakes and lakers. We leave in 81 days to visit our cabin, workshop and property for the second time. Only 2 of us 8 owners were able to visit our property last fall, I was one of them. Excited to take all 8 owners this year."
6641268,teebeej,2022-03-18 18:55:00,47,"This one's easy. 1975. Our elder son was just a year old and nonverbal. I was fresh out of yet another calculus class one year after we spent 2 years with Peace Corps, in Colombia SA. We were broke, as many of my grad school colleagues were. In fact, we were on food stamps that year. My research and teaching assistantships just did not pay the bills. But I wanted to do a ""Travels with Charlie"" thing and my Dad had an old pickup he would loan us. Fuel, at that time, was not as costly as apartment rent and we figured we could camp-cook and pay very little by staying in free campgrounds (those were the days!). Best of all, it would give us 2 months of complete isolation with our son, a language -learning opportunity beyond belief, and experiences we would never forget. So, in June we left grad school behind in Tucson AZ, swapped our tiny Nissan for my Dad's truck in Oklahoma, and headed north. Straight north, having never been to Canada, a lifelong Bucket List adventure! We hit Manitoba and kept going a few hundred miles north on gravel roads. We finally turned left toward a signed lake, campground and fishing lodge. There, we stood on shore and watched boated anglers fish a paradise of which I had dreamed forever. Finally, a kindly man and his wife took mercy and asked if I would like to go with them the next day. Daylight finally came and off we went, leaving my wife and son standing on shore, him waving and her with a worried look. We spent what seemed like hours crossing the huge lake (I was a farm pond bass angler, from shores and my bellyboat). Soon, we were catching pike and walleye one after the other. Incredible! But, sure enough, black clouds roared in on us. John turned that little 17 foot v-hulled metal boat into the wind and we set sail for the Lodge. But, towering white-capped rollers above, us in the trough bottoms, we knew it was hopeless. The 25 hp outboard just did not have the muscle to hold us steady, let alone make progress. Besides, despite John's amazing driving skills, we were filling with water and had only a coffee can for bailing. Mary and I held on for dear life, as I pondered my wife and son being informed of my demise. How would they get home? But we came upon an island and John beached on the leeward side. We sat and shivered for a few hours, till after the storm broke. Then we slowly returned to the Lodge, which had fully expected we were lost at sea. The lodge owner could not believe John had been able to keep us afloat as the storm was exceptionally wicked. All I could do was say thanks to John and Mary for the trip of my life (my god the fishing was beyond belief), and especially for returning me safely to my son and wife. I will NEVER forget that experience, but now when storms are imminent, I am one of the first bass boat captains to run for cover."
6641360,pjshorthorn,2022-03-19 06:27:00,5654,"Lac Seul -NE section 1982. This was my first trip to Canada. I was with my grandfather, father an uncle and two of his friends. We camped in a tent on Taylor Island for the week. We launched from the public boat ramp at the end of Deception Bay and hauled all our gear, food and fuel in three 16 ft boats. The trip in was very scenic but longggggg......approximately 25- 30 miles up the lake. Fully loaded we putted along, navigating with only a map that we got through the MNR in Sioux Lookout. Six hours after launching we made it to Taylor Island. Beautiful sand beach and a great camp site for the tent.. We had to build our own outhouse ( no sides) between two trees with small tree limbs used for the seat....an empty beer box served as the weather proof TP holder. We didn't catch fish right away as none of us had ever fished this vast body of water. Eventually we figured that out and the meals over a campfire were amazing. Baths in the lake were the only choice for knocking off some stink with a big rock being a towel holder and shower caddy so to speak. We saw nary a boat the entire week so it really felt like a remote fly -in trip via boat. Sadly, it was my only Canadian trip with my grandfather before he passed. He still makes every trip I take to Canada now as I bring a picture of him from that trip. I can't wait to pass Taylor Island this July and relive that trip in my mind's eye once again. PjShorthorn"

The most influential trip had to be my first trip to Lake St. Joseph. I'm not sure of the exact date, but it was somewhere between 1998 and 2001. A client invited me to go along with his group to Lake St. Joseph. It was late May or early June and I had no idea what to expect. We had a late snow storm and I had to borrow a warmer jacket. The phenomenal fishing was something I had never experienced before and from that point on I was hooked.

Went with my 2 unlces, my dad, and grandpa - all the people that made me love fishing and the outdoors. One of those uncles and my grandpa have since passed away, but I think of both of them everytime I go fishing. The other uncle, his son, and my dad now take a yearly trip to Ontario. I remember the float plane flight in and teaming up with my dad to do the cooking for the week, a task we still do on every trip, and something I take a lot of pride in. It was great to share an experience with the people who taught me to love the outdoors. I do not recall a single fish I caught that week, but I can tell you every detail about the one that got away. I was fishing with my uncle and hooked into a huge pike. I battled it for what seemed like 30 minutes. It made multiple long runs and I probably didn't know how to really fight it properly. We got it to the boat and it was for sure 40+ inches and fat as can be. My uncle missed it with the net twice, and then the third time knowcked the hook out. I came close to crying and didn't speak to my uncle for a few hours. I'm so glad that I didn't catch that fish. It has provided so many stories and a bond between my uncle and I. To this day I do not let him net my fish! Oh and that 40 inch pike is now at least 45 and goes about 25 pounds in the stories I tell."
