I know there's a HB Live Share website where people have uploaded their data so that others can download and take advantage of it. There is some data there for LS, but not much. If I download this data and copy it to a Zero Lines SD card, then pop that card into my Helix and start recording, will it record over the data that I've downloaded onto the card? When I look at the Live Share data online, I see some interesting looking humps that I had no idea were there. So, I guess what I'm wondering is, if I download this data, can I use this map to locate those humps then my Helix will start recording over the top of the old data with new data? Also, do I put the Zero Lines card in one slot and my Lakemaster card in the other slot, then use the LM map to get to my location and switch back to the Zero Lines slot to record once I get to where I'm going? Sorry, these may be stupid question. This whole feature is a bit of a mystery to me, having never used it yet. I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go."

The lack of data on the live share site I believe is due to the fact that most users do not want to share the data in fear that the public will learn where their favorite hotspots are. From what I have been reading is any new data will add to current data on our zero lines card and not a re-write but I could be wrong. I believe we can use the 2 cards at the same time but again I may be wrong. like you said I will learn as I go but am trying to find/read all I can before I go. I do plan to give it some dry runs on the areas I fish around home to lessen the learning curve. There is another site I look at for some great info, BassBoatCentral.com has threads dedicated to just this type of thing. 3 of us that go up have this capability so when we get back i plan to take all 3 cards and DL the data to build us all more detailed maps for the next trip."

6644346,Ricky Spanish,2022-03-30 13:20:00,1298,I've never downloaded anything to my ZLC but if you visit a mapped out area again and turn AC Live on it will overwrite the data that was already there.
6644396,Fisherman Ted,2022-03-30 17:06:00,461,You don't have to worry about losing data. You download the data to the card. Then put it into your unit. And there is the map. But let's say you turn on autochart live record. All that means is that it will take a new reading and update your card/map that is in the unit with perhaps new and more accurate data. Its not like it wipes out the card. This is useful because what you will find is that the swath that is made when its recording is fairly wide as you criss-cross the lake. So its not always exact. But if you hit that same spot from a different direction it gets even more accurate.I just did this for my fleet. I mapped my entire lake (took three summers) then copied that map to blank zero line SD cards and deployed in my entire fleet (18 boats). Worked like a charm.-FT

So a hump should still be a hump and recognized as such in relative relation to the surrounding water, if your recordings are being made with a notable difference in water level, it could distort depth readings and contour depths. I believe that Autochart allows for you to account for that with a depth offset feature."
6645112,bigdaddyguns,2022-04-02 11:54:00,608,"No. The Live Share data, AutoChart Live, AutoChart+Pro, and LakeMaster each have their own separate data layer with no connections or interactions. So the data for those layers is recorded, massaged, displayed and managed individually and have no impact on each other. Think of them as completely distinct areas with no possibility of corrupting or modifying any of the other data layers.

Consider The LS as a display only element that you can toggle on/off in user settings.

Sorry, these may be stupid question. This whole feature is a bit of a mystery to me, having never used it yet. I'm sure I'll figure it out as I go.The LS data will be stored on your ZL card so that must be present in the control head to get those map features displayed. Assuming you are recording in AutoChart Live mode, those recordings default to being stored in the control head memory. You can transfer to a ZL card at a later date to archive if you want. No need to switch any configurations or swap cards on control head. The LS data and AC Live features work independent of one and other and it's basically a set and forget operation once you get things the way you like."
