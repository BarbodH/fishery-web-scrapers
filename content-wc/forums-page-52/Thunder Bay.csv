6643978,Pooch,2022-03-29 07:18:00,4618,"Too bad about Valhalla. We last stayed there six years ago and it was dated, but clean with spacious rooms and parking. Things change. Thanks for the heads up.Pooch"
6644006,bcmss396,2022-03-29 08:43:00,296,"Stay just out of town in Neebing at the Best Western Nor'Wester. Pretty nice, great pool, sauna and hot tub. Roadhouse Bar and Restaurant is a quick walk across the highway. Also, plenty of parking for truck/trailer comobs. Kind of a nice way to spend your last night in civilization. Blair"
6644072,bode,2022-03-29 12:30:00,39,Thanks for all the input. Not pulling a boat. Had hoped to stay at something more mom and pop type place as I figured they had a tough couple of years. Anybody know about Nights Inn near Blackfoot Baits?
6644250,Thunder Bay Walleye,2022-03-30 06:56:00,56,"Knights Inn should be ok. I see lots of construction type vehicles parked there overnight. There is a bar in the front half where you can get some food, relax play pool, whatever. The bar is popular along Cumberland St (used to be the main hwy through town when it was Port Arthur) and will be noisier than the other 8 motels along the street. They are all mom and pop motels. Several owned by the same person I believe. You should be fine at either. They are all decent for an overnight stay and not as pricey as others near the airport. If you don't want the noise the Voyageur Motel a 2 minute walk away might suit you. The motels along Cumberland St can get busy so book early."
6642644,bode,2022-03-24 04:57:00,39,Plan to stay overnight in Thunder Bay. Would appreciate any suggestions of a decent motel. Great to be heading north again.
6642658,Twodogs,2022-03-24 05:34:00,115,Have stayed here numerous times...clean and right off the highway. Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Thunder Bay
6642664,Ogoki,2022-03-24 05:49:00,291,"https://www.strathconamotel.com Plain ,simple and clean ( last time I stayed there anyway). Right off 17 ,just west of 527 . North east side of Thunder Bay."
6642670,Larry S,2022-03-24 06:22:00,665,"Have stayed here ,Valhalla Inn many times . Right by airport they cater to fishermen Larry Schroeder"
6642682,Pooch,2022-03-24 07:03:00,4618,"Pulling a boat? Valhalla my first choice. Good restaurant and plenty of parking. Large lot for trucks and boats. Not pulling a boat? Best Western Crossroads is clean and walking distance to a few restaurants. Not room for parking a vehicle and boat. Parking is tight and by late afternoon, usually full. Both are good choices and access is easy. Pooch"
6642716,Crede,2022-03-24 10:14:00,134,"Have stayed at The Days Inn and Suites by Wyndham Thunder Bay many times. Clean. Seems like safe area. Free breakfast. Shares a parking lot with a Tim Hortons and Montana's restaurant. If you want higher end dining, The Keg and Caribou restaurants are across the road."
6642954,guidedfishing,2022-03-25 06:18:00,531,"Have stayed at both the Hampton INN and Valhalla, they are basically right next to each other and adjacent to the airport. A little more parking at Valhalla, prefer the rooms at Hampton. Its a wash either way. I see trucks with boats at each, but don't leave expensive gear unsecured you are in a urban area with a lot of traffic. Valhalla's nice with the restaurant right there. If at the Hampton we will still walk over there and eat. They are also adjacent to Canadian Tire, coffee, liquor, and Wal-mart all within a few blocks. Canadian tire is the equivalent of your Farm & Fleet, or Fleet Farm, and they do sell fishing licenses over the counter as well. Also very easy to slip out to the west and get back on 11/17 if heading west without backtracking from that location. Typically we take the bypass and exclude T-Bay, but sometimes the timing just works better with a lay over if we get a late afternoon start."
6643788,Mike Borger,2022-03-28 12:45:00,1554,"Valhalla has gone downhill big time in the last couple of years, never again for me."
6643862,drlee,2022-03-28 17:33:00,409,The aforementioned Hampton Inn is just fine.
6643948,Fisherman1792,2022-03-29 04:43:00,927,"If your pulling a boat the Days Inn off Sibley Dr is a good choice. Plenty of parking, nice clean rooms and close to restaurants. If no boat or trailer the others that were mentioned are good. I find the Valhalla kind of run down, just my own opinion. Just dont stay in a motel off Memorial Dr, they are all pretty much fleabag motels. There are plenty off Arthur st. Fisherman 1792"
