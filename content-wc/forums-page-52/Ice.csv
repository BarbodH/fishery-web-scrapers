6645948,LoDo,2022-04-06 19:16:00,721,Bad news is late ice off this year. Could be as late as May 15. Good news is the lakes should fill up nicely.
6645960,prov1800,2022-04-06 20:44:00,5010,Yes we will have higher water and historically ice usually leaves us around end of first week of May.All depends on temps.We are having lots of rain today so that will eat surface snow down.Going to be a slushy mess.will see in a month from now.Supposed to do a trout day Saturday.
