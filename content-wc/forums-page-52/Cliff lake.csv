6643042,prov1800,2022-03-25 09:42:00,5010,I was there.One if those weeks.Happens.You need to come back chances are that won't happen again.Ive had a few slow days there but not often Has allowed down a bit know.Mornings and evenings are good still but never go then.Afternoon tougher bite but fun to try lures and see what triggers them.Good stuff to know in midday in summer.

6643058,prov1800,2022-03-25 09:56:00,5010,First ice is the best.Dec/Jan/Feb usually awesome.March still good but has its moments.By April we will be heading down lake a bit as the will start moving to spawning grounds.But will only catch them in evening so late nights but crazy fishing and happens like now.Hard to manage 2 lines so just use one.Basically over in few minutes to get 4.Then it's far.lol.Have to run ATV and turn lights on to see or a headlamp but lots of fun.
