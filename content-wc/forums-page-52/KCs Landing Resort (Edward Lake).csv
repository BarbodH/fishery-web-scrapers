6643754,prov1800,2022-03-28 10:22:00,5010,The easiest crappies to catch are when they spawn and of course that's when the water surface temp is in 70f.They still taste pretty good though I have no complaints.But pike have to come out of cold water. I never bring one home during mid summer.Usually mushy meat and a strong taste.Early spring at ice out and winter they are the best and late fall.
