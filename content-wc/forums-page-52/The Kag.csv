Hoping to catch some trout but mainly walleye. Any info would be appreciated, pm's welcome. Thank's in advance. Stay Safe"

One advantage to Kag is that Leuenbergers have marked most of the reefs and hot spots with big orange bouys. Some of the spots in the south end and Humble Bay are not marked though so keep eyes open for hazards. I have been in Van Poele lake twice while staying on Kag just to check it out and it fishes like any other lake in the area find the humps, points and saddles and you'll find fish. I spent most of my time fishing the west side of Kag lake as it is most productive and a better fit to my style fishing but there are fish everywhere on that lake. Its a big lake but with the motors Chad has at his camp we covered alot of water and barely used two tanks of fuel all week. I haven't planned my trip yet for this year but either of those lakes are a great choice."
6645252,Fishquest,2022-04-03 12:11:00,89,Sorry I forgot to mention we didn't fish more then 30 mins each trip for Lakers as we all perfer the walleye fishing so can't offer much help there.

When you say the west side are you referring to the shoreline west of Dorey and on a good day whats the travel time as it's not long getting out of Van Poele. The Kag was booked so as we have supported Chad and Dawn we choose Van Poele. Again thanks for the info:bowdow Stay Safe"
