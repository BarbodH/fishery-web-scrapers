I fully support a camp having a sharp website with plenty of pictures of the camp, boats, lake and fish along with rates, availability and contact information. But being able to talk to the owner over the phone (when they have time) means a lot. A guy in my crew has a deposit with an owner from Jan ‘20 who jacked up the price by 20% this December, wants to be paid in full 1 month before the flight and won’t respond back to us since December with multiple calls and emails. we have sent. In 60 days we will be driving past his base on another trip so I think we will be pounding on his door if he can’t respond, but has plenty of time to be featured on the Ontario Experience show."
6645754,Obabikon,2022-04-05 19:32:00,2370,"I always have my phone on me, and try to answer/return calls whenever possible. However, I am also working 2 jobs, raise 3 kids, be a husband... while also trying to manage the resort. So, right now, sending emails at midnight (often a few days late) might be the best some can do. I'm not saying that's true for everyone. Just wanted to say that could be an issue for some people right now."
6645756,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-05 19:42:00,8293,I'm thinking if somebody wrote a e-mail requesting a phone call concerning a booking you would find a way to respond.
6645762,prov1800,2022-04-05 19:57:00,5010,Which show.
6645770,RichA$1970,2022-04-05 22:00:00,1159,"January 2020 All Canada Show in St Charles. Last December was an emailSaying they raised the price by >20% (prior to oil skyrocketing), wanted payment in full1 month before departure and wanted to split the deposit for 2 years. Emailed, called and left messages but they won’t respond to the group leader so worse case we will stop by their place in 59 days to have a discussion as it’s not until late September. I totally understand how busy a camp owner can be and it could take a couple of days to respond, but 4 months is not a good sign."
6645772,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-04-06 00:16:00,240,I think John's question was regarding which episode of the Ontario Experience this camp owner appeared in? There have been 10-12 episodes of this show since January. I know I have watched all of them except for those in which bass fishing was the topic.
6645788,prov1800,2022-04-06 05:56:00,5010,That's what I was after.Watch them to.except for the bass stuff.lol.
6645820,Old Timer,2022-04-06 08:59:00,255,"I suspect Rich doesn't want to publicly share the name of camp. I get it. Yes, bang on his door this summer when you drive by to your other camp. Maybe you'll get answers and maybe not. But regardless, and if it were me, I'd be looking for a different September destination. Like I've explained in earlier posts, deposits going forward are going to be a thorny matter."
6645828,Eckohlt,2022-04-06 09:18:00,3685,"It's really hard to look for another destination when you have over a grand in deposits down,I would want answers,it's a different story if the outfitter died and know one else to take over,I think I would do what rich plans to do,,,bang hard on the door!!"
6645852,RichA$1970,2022-04-06 10:48:00,1159,"You guys are right on holding off on the name of the camp, hopefully it gets resolved and if not I will share the details and there’s always 2 sides to a story, it’s just they won’t respond to emails or calls for now 4 months after they changed the terms & conditions drastically in December. Pretty poor way to run a business especially when they are giving out free trips to producers for marketing. I do agree deposits are a “Buyer Beware” based on a couple of outfitters’ behavior recently and my plans are to wait for the last week or two and then just start calling who has a last minute opening. There’s plenty of camps and I might not get my top choice, but having the flexibility works for me."
6645324,Laketripper,2022-04-03 20:46:00,103,"I just finished reading the 2022 countdown thread ...many excited folks and rightly so. There was one post put out by V-Bay Gord that was some what deja-vu for me on his thoughts about... non returning past guests.. fine with a few less anglers..enjoying the less busy experience of the past few years...balance that needs to be found. These thoughts are very similar to those of some of the camp owners I have come to know in NW Ontario, most being owners that are well established in their camps and able to ride out the last couple years. Now that being said...I can see some of these more established camp owners wanting to continue on with not having a full camp.They will still put out the full quality experience for their guests but choose to not pursue a fully booked season, and why not...enjoy the fruits of their labours all the more...which will in turn possibly lead to a longer countdown time. I'm referencing drive to camps and the easy access boat-in camps with these thoughts....Outpost fly-ins will be business as usual."
6645420,prov1800,2022-04-04 10:13:00,5010,Personally knowing a lot of camp owners i have not heard one of them looking for a quieter year.More the opposite.They all need to recoup the last couple of years.
6645460,proguidedream,2022-04-04 14:37:00,345,we had some drinks at one of the biggest LOTW lodges .. and trust me no one there wants it to be slow again. they put the boats in the water just so the gel-coat didnt start to crack .. it felt like doomsday there
6645478,Golden Eagle,2022-04-04 16:17:00,2642,"Camp owners have had it tough. Many are seeing 2022 as a chance to survive, hoping to get into profit in 2023 and 2024. I suggest that we encourage friends to fish Canada in 2022."
6645488,RichA$1970,2022-04-04 17:51:00,1159,"If I was a camp owner who had at best 25% revenue for the past 2 years I’d want a full camp and even let extras sleep in my cabin to recoup the debt. Also, even if a camp is only 50% full there’s always a “To Do” list for an owner. Time off is very rare during a season as most guests are good but there always seems to be a camp idiot requiring attention."
6645506,Obabikon,2022-04-04 18:35:00,2370,"I think many camp owners are trying to be optimistic. Would I like 100% occupancy, 100% of the time for 22? Yes. Am I incredibly excited to have 75-80% of the 2019 numbers? Absolutely! That's what many are looking at. 80% will be so much better than 1% in '20 and 15% in '21. If vaccine mandates go away, we will see another surge of bookings, and we're rooting for that. But, most (including myself) are very optimistic."
6645516,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-04 19:32:00,8293,"If the vax card goes away I know at least one who might venture North. But, I won't belittle Canada or complain if they keep the requirement. Their country, their people, their choice."
6645564,REG,2022-04-05 06:37:00,445,"I was lucky enough to get up last fall and I'm really excited about getting back in June, but know that some won't be going this year that normally would have due to the vaccination requirements. So would I like to have fly-in numbers of fish and fishermen on my drive to lake? Sure. But I'd like my resort to stay open and do well and that takes full cabins. So here's hoping the resorts are full all season - we'll find plenty of fish and have a great time!"
6645666,Old Timer,2022-04-05 12:22:00,255,"It's a tough market out there, and inflation, gas prices, old age and Covid are not increasing the pool of would-be Canadian fishermen. I'm not saying I know how to run a resort, but having been in business for fifty years, and when it comes to marketing, it's hard to beat a phone call and/or a hand-written letter to confirm a customer intends to fulfill his/her commitment. With the phone call I might offer my returning guests a spiff, like a free bucket of minnows every morning. IMHO the Internet and email are way overused."
6645672,That Minnesota guy,2022-04-05 12:37:00,8293,"Yikes!! You aren't saying we should actually speak to a person are you? I agree this internet thing is over rated when it comes to shopping, nothing beats personalized service."
