6644962,prov1800,2022-04-01 15:50:00,5010,Was planning on a trout day today but 40 km winds so turned south on #105 and headed toward Edward Lake instead.Shack was good for a hour.Caufht my 4 keepers in less than 5 minutes.Should have went earlier but that's how it goes.Drilled 2 holes one for walleye fishing and one for pike.Solid hour of catching walleyes and they were all over my sonar screen.I had a couple big fish go by just under the ice but no bites but third time I saw one it hit my home made jig with some silver tinsel I had on and good size minnow and the fight was on.Took 10 minutes to get it up into the hole and it was a muskie.Quick pic and quick release with only single hook. Just fished 9-11 and packed up.Last hour was pretty slow.Today the walleyes would not take my hair jig u√±less I put a freebie minnow on.Will try tomorrow for trout if winds drop off.was really hoping for a trout dinner so will have to suffer eating walleye again.lol.
