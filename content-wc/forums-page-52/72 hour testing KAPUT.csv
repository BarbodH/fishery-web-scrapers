6644800,the_bronco,2022-04-01 07:38:00,86,Couldn't agree more!
6644814,guidedfishing,2022-04-01 08:19:00,531,I did go to the app store and did not see an update for ArriveCan. The question is still present in the arrive can app. And states you still need to show negative covid test even if fully vaccinated. Hopefully that is updated soon.
6644820,maddogg,2022-04-01 08:42:00,178,Do we still need the ArrivCan app if we have our vaccination card and passport?
6644830,guidedfishing,2022-04-01 09:13:00,531,"Everything is subject to change, but based on what I read on the Canada.gov site that ArriveCan is not going away, and is and still will be required."
