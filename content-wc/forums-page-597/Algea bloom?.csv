1053271,Obabikon,2008-09-04 10:21:00,2370,The Algea bloom is at its worst right now. Which is very late in the year to be at it's peak. Hopefully it'll be gone quickly though.

1053289,Obabikon,2008-09-04 11:31:00,2370,It's not nearly as bad as it was last year.
1053509,Guest,2008-09-05 12:59:00,0,"Obabikon..... do you think the cooler weather will disperse the bloom somewhat? I notice you guys have had a little cooler spell the last few days....does rainy weather disperse the bloom? Do you have a water temp (average over the areas)? Thanks, again.... Jimi"

1053530,Obabikon,2008-09-05 15:50:00,2370,"I'm not sure. The bloom is usually gone by now. I've actually been told that when the bloom is going on, the algea is actually dead. So, cold probably wouldn't make much difference. Sorry I can't be much help with that. I can say that the bloom has not reduced over the past 4 days... if anything it's grown some."
