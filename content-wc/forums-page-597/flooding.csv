Anyway, the guys you replace will probably have good advice for you. At least they could tell you where they ain't.I agree with hitting moving water. Also expect fish to find the same reefs and points where they were last year. You won't be able to see cabbage, but your trolled lures will.Have a great trip."
1053485,Guest,2008-09-05 11:36:00,0,What camp are you going to? How did you find out about the rain? Fish will definitely be moving shallower with warmer water. Jigs on the bottom. The bottom 12-18 in. of water is the cleanest. I'm going up sept. 20th to sharpstone lake about same distance northwest of red lake.

While it has been few years since we have been to Hornby, we have had good luck when the wind is blowing. I'll post a report around the 17th. Good luck to all."
