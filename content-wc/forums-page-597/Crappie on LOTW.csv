1052714,Guest,2008-09-01 21:08:00,0,Over this long weekend we've had three parties say they caught about 20 crappies each in Miles Bay and other parties have picked up scattered crappies all over the lake. Last year Obabikon Lake was best in September and Hay Island was best in October.
1051412,Obabikon,2008-08-25 16:01:00,2370,"we never use slip bobbers. We use the crappie rigs... I call them ""texas-T"" rigs. They're a swivel attached to mono that will have a T shaped piece of metal with the jig on it. Holding one one weightless hook. Further down is another T holding a similar hook, and then further down that is the weight (often substituted for a 3/8ths ounce jig). Look them up... they're also called christmas tree rigs, and I believe pickeral rigs."
1051460,Matches,2008-08-25 20:42:00,236,"Obabikon, I met Buddy (as well as your dad) at your resort in 1996 or 1997. (Which ever was the first year your dad passed the resort to Steve). Could you tell us how Buddy died? Thanks"
1051467,Guest,2008-08-25 21:13:00,0,"I believe Buddy passed in a snowmobile accident. Apparently, he was by himself late at night and was out on his snowmobile and hit either a pier or a downed tree and was knocked unconcious in the middle of winter. He was not found until the next day and may have froze to death if the accident hadn't caused his death prior. I fished with him one week a year for about 10 straight years. He was just a lot of fun and was very mechanically knowledgeable. He also was a good fisherman and liked to trap in the winter. Told us a lot of trapping stories and his wife was the cook at obabikon along with his brother in law Larry. He would seldom use live bait - his technique was a pink jig with a white twister tail and he caught more than his share. Cool guy!"
1051543,Obabikon,2008-08-26 08:17:00,2370,"Like stated above, Buddy was killed in a snow mobile accident. However, I was told that he was riding with two other sleds, and they didn't notice until they had stopped that he was missing. I also was told that it was determined he died instantly from the impact. He honestly was a very good fisherman, a fantastic mechanic, and a wonderful person."
1051946,1shooter,2008-08-27 21:32:00,1493,I have no idea what your talking about. Your going to have to show us how to set our rigs up this fall.
1051970,1700SS,2008-08-28 05:59:00,104,"1shooter,Just a 1/8 or 1/4 oz. jig and minnow will work also. That setup will have you catching all the crappies you need in no time. Thanks for the responses Obabikon, I will make it a point to stop in and check your place out. Two more weeks from this Friday, can't wait.Brett"
1051994,Bill Krejca,2008-08-28 07:42:00,6107,"I, too, am planning on being in the area the week of Sep 13. We will be staying at Young's Wilderness Camp. I like to fish the Hay Island spots for crappie and walleye, but will take several journeys to Obabikon during the week, weather permitting. Jared, I'll try to stop over on the way back from Obab, maybe I can drop off a book. Brett, we missed each other last fall, please remind me what you are running, so maybe we can chat a while if we run into each other. I have a red 20' Lund Alaskan with windshield, 115 Yamaha with kicker. It's what I think about all year long, Bill Krejca"
1052006,Obabikon,2008-08-28 08:14:00,2370,"Bill... I'll have a crisp $20 bill here I'll trade you for that book! I look forward to meeting you! Shooter, I'll be happy to show you! Here's a picture of what they look like... http://www.jrsports.ca/pickerel-rig.jpg 1700, please do stop by! I'd be happy to give you a tour and exchange fishing stories!"
1052026,1700SS,2008-08-28 09:16:00,104,"Bill,I have a 17' red Lund Angler, 115 Yamaha, no kicker. 3 total in the boat. Will be hitting the Elbow and Thompson Creek area a couple times during the week. Also look for me in the channel going west out of Burrows for walleye. I will keep my eyes peeled for ya. We caught a few in the Hay Island area last September, but just do not know that area all that well for crappies. When we catch up to each other, maybe you can point me in the right direction for that area. We are staying at Red Wing Lodge. Good luck Bill. See ya soon Jared.Brett"
1052059,Guest,2008-08-28 11:36:00,0,$175 per person Special now applies for September. Is that for a week?
1050629,Guest,2008-08-21 08:14:00,0,Hey Obabikon how long before the crappie start going on LOTW. Can't wait for some of those king sized slabs!!!!!
1050882,1700SS,2008-08-22 10:21:00,104,"Obabikon,Should we still be able to get into them the 3rd week in sept. this year? Have in previous years.Thanks,Brett"
1051122,Obabikon,2008-08-23 16:25:00,2370,Hey guys... I'd assume that they'll be going by the 1st week in September. The cool weather will drive them to the fall/winter spots. Definately by the 3rd week!
1051127,1shooter,2008-08-23 17:39:00,1493,Perfect. I'll be there the last weekend of September. Please leave a few for me.
1051138,Guest,2008-08-23 19:06:00,0,"I went to the Obabikon Bay camp for about 10 straight years with 9 other friends during the first week in October. This was from about 1988 until about 1998. My buds would hunt ducks in AM and again in PM and I had one old retired guy who would go out with me and a guide named Buddy (since deceased) and we would fish traditional crappie rigs in north miles bay and also at the elbow in the obabikon or around the cribs (fish attractors) on the right had side after you entered the obabikon on the way to the elbow. After my friends and I stopped going (they all got too old) I would take my two sons and my brother-in-law and his sons up for 4 days in August and we never really got into the crappies around the ""famous"" crappie dock there at the camp but my sons and I would troll cranks (Kevin Van**** bass cranks - crawdad or perch color) very close to shorelines and pick up about every species including enormous crappies. I think the crappies are always going on up there just some times of the year are a bit better than other times of the year. Just the other day, my oldest boy (just graduated from a 6 year pharmacy program) asked me when we were going back to the Obabikon. Have not been up that way in a couple of years. Soon I hope, but realistically, who knows?! Have fun and you will catch a lot of crappies!"
1051205,Obabikon,2008-08-24 10:33:00,2370,"Footdoc, Give me a call sometime to talk. Buddy was a wonderful man, and that was just an aweful accident. He and his wife Jannet helped to raise my brother and I on the island. He is a man who will never be forgotten at Obabikon! The crappies always move out of the dock in August. They are headed to deep water, but always stop at the 18ft+ deep trees (that's where they are right now) before they go to the September spots. The dock had very good crappie fishing this summer, but there's no place or time better than the elbow in late september/early october!"
1051210,Bill Krejca,2008-08-24 12:17:00,6107,"I, too, remember Buddy, although did not know him as well as you, Jared. I always enjoyed talking with him. He had a good feel for the fishing and all that goes with it. He ferried us out to the Channelview cabin a number of times. I was sorry to hear of his death a few years ago. Bill Krejca"
1051216,Obabikon,2008-08-24 14:05:00,2370,"haha... Bill, you never told me you stayed at Channel View! My dad kept that cabin after he sold it in '97. I came up every year and stayed there until we bought it again last May. That's the true definition of ""roughing it"". However, some of the best times I've ever had on LOTW's were spent at that cabin. I think it's a great testimony to a wonderful man that more than 10 years after his death, people still remember him. And, they still cherrish the memories they have with him!!!"
1051353,1shooter,2008-08-25 11:50:00,1493,This will be my first time up there in the fall. How do you fish for the crappies? Slip bobber?
1051380,Guest,2008-08-25 13:46:00,0,"I suppose you could use a slip bobber but I never tried that tecnique. We mainly used traditional crappie rigs until we figured out what we were doing. A traditional crappie rig is either purchased with a weight on the bottom and two separate hooks staggered about 12"" and 18"" off the bottom in line or simply tie your own rig. Be prepared to donate a few of these rigs to the rocks below. After you get the hang of it and fishing in general, we used 1/16 oz jigs/minnows with or without plastics and vertically jigged them. Also, we caught a lot of them dragging cranks close to shore but that technique was very sporadic. It is great fun to get over a school of crappies and hammer them. That resource, meaning lake of the woods is phenomenal when I think about 10 guys going up there and every fall each taking a limit of very large crappies home with them. Have fun and research crappie rigs."
