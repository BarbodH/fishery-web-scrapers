571144,Obabikon,2008-02-01 13:59:00,2370,">Just to be smart. I can count to 2 without any help. lol... wether or not the guide could count, it's definately a luxurious resort, and has good fishing. It may not be the best ""fishing trip"" out there, but if you're looking a pure luxury... totem definately should be listed... along with North Star (Knee Lake)"
571157,Guest,2008-02-01 20:23:00,0,"this is JMHO...whether it be a fly in or a drive to, I feel that by going to 5 star Canadian resorts you are not getting the full Canandian experience. To me, and again this is just my opinion, there has to be a little bit of a degree of ""roughing it"". I dont need a meal cooked by a culinary school trained chef and the meal doesnt have to look pretty. The boat doesnt have to be an 18ft Lund with a 50hp motor..there doesnt have to be a Canadian Indian in the back driving it...there doesnt have to be a hot pot of coffee on the porch in the morning..There doesnt have to be a pool, a sauna or a hot tub..there just has to be a resort with great fishing, comfortable cabins with most of the anemities of home, tasty home cooked meals..boats with good motors that work and get you around the lake youre on..having said that, to each his own..its your money and you can spend it the way you want..I am far from being cheap and can afford these ""luxury"" trips..but to have someone I dont know driving the boat, baiting my hook, releasing my fish, cleaning my fish, making my shore lunch etc, it just wouldnt be the same.. sorry for the rant but like I said, its JMHO"
571184,Stu,2008-02-04 01:59:00,472,"I agree w/ kbkakes. Wollaston Lake Lodge is always listed as one of the top resorts in Canada. It's an Orvis endorsed lodge, which should speak for itself. I have never been there, but I have a friend w/ deep pockets who has fished there alot. BIG northern and good walleye fishing. They post their catches on their website. I think their packages are fully guided also. Good luck - Stu"

571434,Guest,2008-02-15 21:24:00,0,"Totem has been an incredible experience. I have been in the hosptitality industry for 20 years and Totem delivers a 5 star experience. The food and service is top notch. The guides especially Shaun makes it a memorable experience. I have been to many resorts in Ontario and Totem has been the best so far. North Shore lodge on Eagle was great and so was Huber's on Wabigoon, but if you are looking for 5 star accomodations at a great price, Totem is the way to go. 96 days to go !!"

1054471,orchard frank,2008-09-10 20:52:00,1900,"For our 25th Anniversary, wife and I spent 8 days at Hatchet Lake Lodge in Saskatchewan, definitely a high-end operation. Great meals, guides, boats, etc, couldn't ask for anything more. We flew out several days to outpost lakes, had incredible fishing, northerns (11 between 20-28# on a good scale), tons of 15's-19's, lakers up to 22#, fast walleye action, no huge ones, maybe 5# tops. But pricey. We spent 2 weeks a year for 13 years at Lost Island Lodge at Lac Seul, great memories, huge numbers of fish, American plan caters however you want."

571132,Guest,2008-01-31 18:34:00,0,"make sure you count your fish limit at totem,and not the guide..had an accounting issue with the dnr a couple years ago."
571138,Guest,2008-02-01 09:46:00,0,"Was that cheap shot required ? Yes, I'm a totem guide. The post was asking for input on ""luxury resort"". Your little brain decides to bash a camp for the mistake made by ONE person / ONE day. I'd bet a summers salary that every other camp has a guide who has made a mistake. I know even I have. I'd even goes as far to say that a percentage of us who frequent WC have done so. Does that make us ""bad"" to the point that we would never recommend ourselves to anyone? If it was a ""perfect"" world, I'd never fish...... it'd be too easy. Good Fishen Rob"
571139,Goldeneagle,2008-02-01 11:59:00,78,"I'm with Rob, as I've had great experiences with Totem over the years. Eric Brown has a great operation going and unfortunately a small mistake, by one person, made it to the message board. My first time up there we had 48 in our party and we ate pike for shore lunch the last day because we had limits of walleyes in the freezer. Extreme care was taken in packaging fillets to be sure we were not over. The guides did their job. The only complaint I'd have with Totem is that they pampered this depression baby more than he requires. But, I didn't turn it away."
571059,Obabikon,2008-01-28 12:52:00,2370,I'll second Tetu... it's more of a vacation resort vs. a fishing resort... absolutely mind boggling.
571060,Obabikon,2008-01-28 12:53:00,2370,"Gangler's looks amazing! Actually, before he got into the resort business, he went to Obabikon... my dad knows him pretty well! I'd definately recommend them if you're looking for a top shelf fishing resort!!!"

571076,Guest,2008-01-29 07:12:00,0,I do not have to come on here for any advertisement and it is hust a coincidence. Best walleye lake in the world baby. Why on a WALLEYE message board are we getting so many trophy pike lakes as our dream trip. Go to a northern board---Just kidding ya.
571077,jigman 2003,2008-01-29 07:23:00,981,"Okay, my mistake. The original question was not which lake has the best trophy walleye fishing. The question was which lake has the best fishing. Many of the trips posted do offer monster pike and laker fishing, but most also offer fantastic walleye and some offer grayling fishing. Personally, I can find unbelievable walleye fishing for a lot less than $3500 a week."
571079,Guest,2008-01-29 08:43:00,0,No question about that--I am as poor as they come but will always make enough for canada fishing trip. Would be nice to be catered to like for a week though. I usually go to gullrock or fly in with gawley(best walleye fishing i have ever had in 25 years of going) with little beaver/woman river fly ins. 750-800 bucks will take you with him. Not bad.
571082,jigman 2003,2008-01-29 10:30:00,981,"I pay more than that, but not even half of what Bud's charges for a week. I certainly wouldn't turn down an opportunity to go there, but to me a ""dream trip"" is one where the only way you can experience the fishing is by staying at a high end joint."
