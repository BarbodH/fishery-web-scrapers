1050972,Baitslinger,2008-08-22 16:33:00,93,"Am considering a trip to Nungesser next summer, and am wondering about crowds in early July. I realize there are three camps plus some outpost cabins on a very large lake, but what is realistic to expect in the way of crowds? I would certainly expect to see other boats, but I have no desire to fish within talking or shouting distance of other anglers. Are the better spots dispersed enough that we would have reasonable amounts of space to fish ourselves, or is it ""bumper boats and combat fishing"" with everyone concentrated in a few choice spots?Any other info about fishing, especially times of the summer to do the trip- will be much appreciated. Cant get in until the last week of June, but am hoping to still hit some decent fishing for my kids. This trip is a relatively big investment for our family, and I want to do all I can to tip the odds in our favor. Any insights on what to expect in the way of fish & patterns for late june early July?Finally, I did a search on this site already, and saw that Nungesser Lake Lodge had some problems last year, and their website now says ""under new management"". Anyone been there this year and care to share their experience? How does it compare to Birch Point? Unfortunately, Anglers Kingdom is out of our price range.Thanks in advance!"

One or more might have a special price for your children, depending upon their ages. I fished Nungesser the first week of August 2007 and we weren't crowded."

Plenty of places to fish without running into other boats. It was our first time up there, and it won't be our last. Fishing was great, and Birch Point did not dissapoint at all. Highly recommended."

I have always been able to find a place to fish without other boats. Sometimes someone is on a spot I want but I just go to a different location. The first few weeks of the season can be really crowded with everyone wanting to fish the river. But after that, things spread out.For walleye, jigs always work, but after that it depends. One year Shad Raps killed them, the next year it was Walley Divers that worked. This year trolling large 5"" plastics caught the big Northern.Nungesser lake lodge has some family advantages, nice lodge with a, pool table, satellite TV, horse shoes, and a nice ""green space"" for kids to play. Anglers, is really setup for the fisherman and has the nicest boats. I have stayed at both and both are well run camps."
1052469,Guest,2008-08-31 08:56:00,0,I fished nungesser the first week in june this year . We did see boats from time to time but there is plenty of lake to find a spot for yourself. We stayed at nungesser lake lodge the new owners are great easy to find and always there to help out. Just talk to the dock hands they know where the fish are they get info from all the fisherman all week. Walleye fishing on this lake is awesome for both numbers and trophy sized fish. We got walleye from 15'' to 29'' on jigs and livebait fishing islands and wind blown points. Pike were alittle tricky at first we got alot of pike while walleye fishing. With little or no weeds we went to trolling and we got into them pretty good. We trolled large minnow baits and got pike from 24'' to 41'' fishing in the bays in water 10' to 15' outside of the reedbeds. So if you good luck you wont be disapointed. Pike pro
