1052556,SinOrSwim,2008-08-31 22:38:00,1528,"Are you going with Slate Falls Outposts? If so, they will have detailed lake maps for you when you get there. Just be sure to ask. If you indeed are going with Slate Falls, I can personally vouch for them as we are heading up in less than 2 weeks and have been with Slate Falls for about 10 years now. First rate all the way. Enjoy!"

1052704,SinOrSwim,2008-09-01 20:03:00,1528,We are in North Gull this year but have been at South the last several years. Holy High Water!!! When was that? We wanted to try Root Bay as well but it was booked the only time we could go. We leave the 11th to fly out the 13th. Can't wait!!! I'll try to post a trip report as we'll be back before you leave.Enjoy!
