I heard a rumor this weekend that all boaters in Canada will need a boaters licence sometime next year. Doesn't matter if your a resident or a nonresident. Just the other day there was a post about business being dramatically down in Canadian waters and resorts. Hopefully this bullet doesn't hit there foot, again. Have fun with this one!http://www.safeboater.com/"

Operator card or equivalent issued to a non-resident by their state or country will be considered as proof of competency."" So, doesn't appear to be an issue for non-residents unless you take really long vacations in Canada."
1052855,Guest,2008-09-02 13:08:00,0,I read it the same way. The only requirement is proof of residency onboard.
1052857,Guest,2008-09-02 13:28:00,0,Thanks for clearing that up. The other site didn't say anything about the 45 days.
1052860,Catman59,2008-09-02 13:34:00,345,.......... man I sure wish I could spend enough days up there to need a card !!!!
1052864,Richard B,2008-09-02 13:47:00,735,I live in Ohio and anyone that was born after 1/1/82 must have a boating licence. My son and I got our boating licenses this spring. The course was a lot of fun especially with my son. For me it re-enforced my boating knowledge and taught me a couple of things. It was an all day course with a test at the end. The cost was approximately $45 including lunch and snacks.
1052905,bob oh,2008-09-02 18:23:00,3936,"Ohio law is a good one but everyone should be required to pass a test. At least 20 of the boaters I run across on Erie have no idea what the rules are, especially guys with small Johnsons and very big boats!!!!!"
1052913,Richard B,2008-09-02 19:17:00,735,THAT IS A FACT!!!! I have been on lakes all over the country and I have not seen anywhere the boat drivers are less considerate and more dangerous than on Lake Erie.
1052951,tackleman,2008-09-02 22:02:00,444,"The law only applies to Canadians who operate boats in Canadian waters. It is up to the camp owner to provide the guests of their establishments with a lesson on how to operate the boats they rent out safely.There is also a grey area, if you are aware of it, the card is called the recreational boaters card. If you are a guide working , then you are not being, ""recreational"" and according to some cops i've talked to, there might be a case made that you don't need the card since you are working not relaxing."
1053051,Flip Silverlake,2008-09-03 12:03:00,645,It applies to Canadians and any non Canadians who are in Canada for more than 45 days. SInce i spend most of the summer on LOTW I went ahead and got a boaters safety card from the Wis DNR. If you rent a boat your susposed to be given a brief lesson on boating and the document you get when you rent a boat serves as proof. If you own your boat the 45 day limit comes into effect. But since the boat is not regestered in Canada the on board equipment rules with the excption of PFD'S does not apply. But like i said if your in Canada for more than 45 days you need the boaters class.
