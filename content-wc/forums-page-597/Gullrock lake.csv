1049086,Guest,2008-08-13 18:32:00,0,Just looking for some updates on gullrock. Heading up to wrights in a couple weeks and already cannot sleep at night. Just wondering how the fishing is?
1049249,BigBadBucky,2008-08-14 11:18:00,3,"I'm heading up tomorrow. I'll try to remember to post a report when we get back next weekend. (Heck, I may even see if I can fire up the wireless internet at camp and get a post in during the week.)"
1049322,2746,2008-08-14 16:51:00,3206,"we were up the first week of August. Weather was nearly perfect and fishing was good. Lot's of eaters and plenty of 20"" plus fish with one at 27.5"". Northerns were cooperating as well (we spent a few early afternoons fishing for them) with Keg being particularly productive for them. We had a Texas bass fisherman with us on his first trip to Canada and, while we never really converted him to Walleye, he loved catching those Pike!"
1049323,tackleman,2008-08-14 16:55:00,444,"I've been out most days this week, gotta tell you, it was tiring to keep catching those fish.my buddy from Mn. is up and he has been using gulp to try and save on minnows, seems the eyes like that stuff too, but I tried it yesterday morning and he used minnows and outfished me 7 to 1.we were on a hump the other night, 5 of us and we caught in 2 hours around 80 walleyes. not bad for 2 hours work."
1050185,Guest,2008-08-19 07:15:00,0,"we were there the 1st week in august and had easily our best trip. As said, weather was perfect and lots of fish over 20"". 27.5"" was the biggest. 18-25 fow."
1052663,BigBadBucky,2008-09-01 16:52:00,3,"I tried to post from camp(Five Lakes Lodge), but for some reason couldn't log in. Wireless didn't quite reach to my cabin, but if I went outside and sat by the lake I was fine. Had a great week of fishing. Our numbers were way up, but the size we were catching was down from other years. We were catching primarily 13-17"" fish. We did catch a number of 18-19"" and had about 35 fish over 20"" for the week with 25 1/4 being the largest. Some said they were catching larger fish deeper (but they weren't getting numbers like us) which makes sense as most years when we've caught a lot of larger fish we are fishing 22-28' of water, but this year we were getting ours in 13-22' and not having much success in deeper water. Had some pretty big wind Tuesday night through Friday. We started fishing Saturday afternoon and Sunday and ran out of bait both days so our numbers were good. Due to the 100 fish/day debate on here I had put a golf score clicker in my tackle box, but hadn't used it in previous years. Started keeping track on Monday. For the rest of the week our numbers were 135 on Monday, 136 on Tuesday, 144 on Wednesday, 124 on Thursday and 77 in three hours of fishing Friday morning before hitting the road. That was for two of us (my dad and I) in a boat. Our numbers could have been better. Monday we again ran out of bait twice. Tuesday we lost a couple hours when we stopped to help a couple of fisherman that had been thrown out of their boat. (Fortunately they were OK. The boat was still running wide open in circles, but they had been thrown far enough out that they didn't get hit by boat or prop. Shook them up, but thankfully no serious injuries and our boat and another were close enough to see it happen and offer assistance.) Wednesday the wind forced us off the lake about 5pm plus we were running short on bait. Thursday I had had enough of battling the wind by 2pm so that was a real short day. I position fish and you can only take so many waves over the back and be battling the tiller for so long before you get tired of it and it stops being fun. When I started getting water from head to toe and one wave went far enough to catch my dad in the front of the boat, it was enough. I can't remember what our minnow count was for the week. Sometimes you'd get 4-7 fish on a minnow so you think you were doing good, but it always seems to average out that you get about 1.5 fish per minnow or a little better. Even a bit of head or tail after one had been ripped apart would generally work. Friday for awhile we were making minnows as the walleyes were spitting up minnows when we caught them. We had most of our success on Keg. We were the only ones fishing the banana reef all week so it was also nice to escape the other boats. I like Gullrock because it isn't too big and there is generally enough protection to fish somewhere and the waves don't get too big. However, Wednesday night, Thursday night and Friday morning I was glad we had the upgrade boat to battle the waves coming back in as they had built up pretty good on the main lake due to the sustained higher winds. Just took the boat off of plane and let it plow along as the waves were big enough the boat couldn't get back up on plane. Even with that, I don't think my dad could have taken it without the pedestal seats to cushion the ride. Tackleman--I was looking for you on the lake. I ran up on a boat a couple times I thought might be you, but each time it ended up being a black Lund that had a high canopy."
1052666,Golden Eagle,2008-09-01 17:03:00,2642,Do very many good fishermen live on Gull Lake and is that where they fish?
1052862,tackleman,2008-09-02 13:39:00,444,"I was out yesterday for a couple hours and fished a flats area around Round Island and got about 30 walleye ranging in size from 8 to 23 inches. Big Bad Bucky, I looked for you too but I had to go out of town on Wed & Thursday of the week you were up. Maybe we'll meet up next year,"
