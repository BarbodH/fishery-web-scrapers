However, due to work issues, I am leaving on September 14th. Are the fish moving to their fall haunts? Or, are the fish still out on the reefs? How about water temp?? Thanks in advance for any information."

1054442,stcriox,2008-09-10 17:03:00,78,"Dewyg--Thanks again for the update. Have you found the bite to be best with jigs and rigs and live bait, or spinners and live bait? Any suggestions on bait type?? minnows, crawlers, leeches? I usually have all, but minnows seem to be the ticket in October. Thanks."
1054818,MN_Moose,2008-09-12 13:56:00,965,I didn't get that far down this year but we were on LOTW first week of Sept. We were in Bigstone and Andrews bays and all the way across the North end no further south than French narrows. We found the fish 25 to 41 ft. Typical summer pattern at that time. Minnows didn't work all that well for us but we didn't really give them full effort. Crawlers and leeches of Lindy rigs and spinners. Tough getting leeches now as the bait shop owners tell me they have a white fungus on them. We had fun finding and trying new spots. Caught at least 100 walleye a day.
