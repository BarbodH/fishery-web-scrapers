1051548,dwrisch,2008-08-26 08:38:00,13,"Just got back from two weeks of fishing in Minaki. I beleive the fishing up in Minaki is the best I have seen in the last 15 years. It was nothing to catch 40-50 Walleye a day. Appears the slot restriction is working to make a better fishery. The Walleye ranged from 6 inches (which is good seeing reproduction) up to the biggest, which was 27 inches. I did see some questions on the thread that I posted in late July. but was unable to answer due to being in Canada. The water was very high when I arrived on July 31st and by the time I left the level had dropped by a 1 1/2 feet. Water temp. was in the low 70's. Fishing was good on all of the humps about 32 to 35 feet deep. Weed Walleye did good with jigs and leeches in 6 feet of water or less. I did fish the Gary Roach Pro-Am, so if you have interest in finding out the results, go towww.paradisecoveminaki.com I will be going up again next year the second week of June and again two weeks in Aug. Anyone have any questions can e-mail me at [email protected] and in subject line put Minaki so I am able to get you past my spam blocker. Deisel"
