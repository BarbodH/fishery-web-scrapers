When I travel from home to Lake of the Woods, I am traveling over 1000 miles, not carrying all that fuel saves on wear and tear on my trailer. I just have to be careful where I buy fuel from, had a bad expereince last year. When I get to International Falls I buy fuel, it isn't worth taking a chance with all that extra weight over a long distance. BOB"
1048833,bpetersen,2008-08-12 17:54:00,251,"I am not sure if you were given the anwer to your question. The one post was right about being asked several years ago, how much extra gas containers were being transported. I haven't been taking extra just because the resort I go to doesn't allow extra cans, insurance issue. I asked at the border this year about your question. The answer was very vague. They said you may take a reasonable amount of gas across with no problems. Like I said very vague. Reasonable to me means the vehicle and boat tank filled. Pete"

It is way too dangerous, besides, you my be a risk taker, but why jeporadize the other driver who may hit you accidentally. Spend the extra money for a safe enjoyable trip. The kind of savings we're talking about, only makes a dent in the total cost of the trip.Skiball"
1052683,Reels,2008-09-01 18:02:00,2876,I believe the free trade act allows you to bring more gas than before. 16 years ago or so it was only what you can carry in the original tanks.
1052687,Obabikon,2008-09-01 18:17:00,2370,"You can bank on a savings of $2-$2.5 per gallon. Always ask your camp owner first, and do not smoke... not just don't flick your butts out the window... DO NOT smoke with a bunch of gas in the trailer. Anyhow... it's up to you."
1052734,2Labs,2008-09-02 05:55:00,685,"Actually, gas is 6 pounds per gallon. 42 x 6 = 252. The specific gravity is less than water, which is why gas floats on top of the water.I had always figured it as 8 pounds per gallon also. But, it ain't.Just FYI."
1052736,2Labs,2008-09-02 06:14:00,685,"I take along 4 5-gallon containers filled with gas every year. I carry them in my boat rather than the truck bed so any vapor will dissipate. I put each gas can in a 14-gallon Rubber Maid and put a dock bumper along side in each Rubber Maid so the gas container doesn't slide around and possibly tip the Rubber Maid over. I also position the other cargo I am carrying in my boat cargo around the Rubber Maids to keep them from moving during stopping and acceleration.Been doing this for 15 years now.Never been asked at the border. Never had a problem with leaks, gas smell, etc."
1052921,Guest,2008-09-02 19:51:00,0,One other thing about bringing gas. I have watched as more than one group pulled back their boat cover and discovered their gas cans had leaked and soaked everything they owned in gasoline. Except for the beer thank goodness!! Be careful where you store the gas you transport
1048336,Guest,2008-08-09 20:41:00,0,"I look to all of you experienced Canada travelers to answer yet another question. How much gasoline, if any, am I allowed to bring into Canada. My boat has an internal tank, and my pickup runs on diesel, so I was wondering if I would be allowed any extra gas cans for my boat. Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance, Al"
1048337,Guest,2008-08-09 20:46:00,0,Fill the truck up with diesel and fill up the boat with gas before you cross the border. The risks involved with carrying extra containers of gas is not worth it. Its like a bomb waiting to go off.
1048354,Catman59,2008-08-10 04:44:00,345,"I always bring 2 spare cans of gas along . I have never had an issue at the border and our camp has no problem with me having the extra gas. If I dont use it in the boat , I dump it in the truck ."
1048541,Guest,2008-08-11 08:44:00,0,"If you bring more then the gas that can fit in your internal tank you are subjetc to paying duty on that extra gas. In addition many camp owners will not allow you to bring ""extra"" cans of gas into camp. In addition it is very dangerous."
1048556,SSH,2008-08-11 10:17:00,526,"I usually bring 5 6-gallon cans in addition to my built-in tank. Years ago the border folks would ask if you had extra gas and would make you pay duty on it, but they haven't asked this question in quite a few years (probably ten years). I am a bit on the thrifty side, but bringing the 30 gallons save me about $75 over purchasing it in Canada. But as the prior poster indicated, there is some risk involved. But having been a teenager in the 60's, I still have a little risk taking in my blood.."
1048565,Guest,2008-08-11 11:08:00,0,Bring your own gas!! One trip and the savings will pay for your gas containers. Never been asked to pay duty for gas. Been asked if I will be using it all while in Canada.
1048584,Guest,2008-08-11 13:19:00,0,What vehicles do you guys drive and which routes do you take? I want to be sure not to rear end your vehicle or smoke near it. ( just kidding) Good Luck
1048597,Golden Eagle,2008-08-11 13:58:00,2642,To me the most important part of any trip is getting there and back safely.
1048751,walley250,2008-08-12 11:26:00,161,You need to bring a lot of extra fuel along to see any type of savings. Its just not worth the hassel or the risk. Pay the extra couple of bucks. I guarentee if you have a fire you would have been willing to spend even 50 extra dollars and I think you be hard pressed to save that much.
1048774,Guest,2008-08-12 13:14:00,0,"I believe that gas is so powerful that two 5 gallon containes exploding would be enough to wipe out a pretty good size rig its tow vehicle and anyone within range. So, adding another few more cans of gas wont make much difference, I'll be roasted either way."
