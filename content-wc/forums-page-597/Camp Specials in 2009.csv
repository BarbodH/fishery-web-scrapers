1053995,Guest,2008-09-08 13:13:00,0,Does anyone know of any camps that are offering special rates to attract fisherman to there camp next year? It sounds like a lot of camps were down and I didn't know if any of them were going to try something like that to get people back.
1053996,Boots,2008-09-08 13:20:00,19,I see my outfitter raised his 2009 prices about 3 percent for 2009. I doubt prices will be lowered but heard some outfitters will keep 2009 prices same as 2008 prices.
1054031,Guest,2008-09-08 15:49:00,0,I don't look for any prices coming down. They have to make a living also. I'm sure they would if they could in order to attrack more business but not at the expense of losing money. Just have to save a little here and there and hope the gas price keeps dropping.
1054061,Obabikon,2008-09-08 18:40:00,2370,"I'm not allowed to discuss rates, but we will be running specials. However, you won't be able to ever find a special rate in the first two weeks of June. Most will be in July or August... or later. I would expects camps across the board to raise prices, especially for the popular weeks. (late may/early june)"
1054091,1shooter,2008-09-08 20:56:00,1493,"Obabikon, I heard you have a special running the last week of September where you greet anyone arriving at your camp in a Crestliner with a cold beer. Is this true?"
1054172,rockpt,2008-09-09 10:44:00,589,Last month anyone who arrived in a Crestliner was greeted by Otis who promptly marked the boat.
1054182,Obabikon,2008-09-09 11:33:00,2370,"I'll just say watch out for Otis. He's the boss, and doesn't take well to riftraff off the lake! haha Beer's too expensive in Canada... hot cups of coffee!"
1054207,1shooter,2008-09-09 13:39:00,1493,It's cheaper than gas though.
