1050761,JAY221,2008-08-21 18:46:00,877,"The wife & I were up the week of August 9-16. Got most of our walleyes in the weeds back in the bays. Not much in the way of big fish but plenty of fish by her standards, I felt it was a little slow. The camp owners(Kingfisher) say it is up about 2-3 feet. I was last there in 2001? & it is up about 5 feet from then which could have been low. The weather was actually to nice with lows in the 50-52 range & highs of about 72-74 without a drop of rain all week. Never got whitecaps on the lake just a little chop. Later, Jay"
1050773,Guest,2008-08-21 19:55:00,0,Jay You are lucky you had nice weather. When I was up in early June it rained a lot and had a lot of wind. On the way into the camp I go to we had 4 to 5 foot waves boy was that fun.
1050797,Guest,2008-08-21 21:47:00,0,"Jay, Holpe your wife enjoyed the lake. I am up there right now. My wife and I arrived on Thursday the 14th. 25 miles south of Jim and Julie's driveway we struck a deer and basically totalled the car. Got into camp somehow and pounded down the hood and pulled back the radiator and hoped for the best on the way home. Drove home yesterday and actually made it back to Iowa with no problems just alot of dumb looks. drove back up today will be fishing until labor day weekend with a group of 3 other guys in my boat and two other boats of guys, 10 total in my group. a quick recap of the 14th-21st...weed walleyes!! almost everything we caught for walleyes came out of weeds. Did really well in the evenings, one night I caught a 25, 26, 27, 27, and a 29 inch beauty...all casting cranks in the weeds. I've noticed that daily the eyes are starting to appear out on the reefs though so this week should get really good for the jig fisherman. Norherns were just the opposite as we caught all of our big ones out in deep water trolling over and around traditional walleye structure. I think the hot temps and blazing sun has pushed them away from the weeds, for now. My niece boated a 41 1/2, and my 7 year old son got a 40 incher. I'm looking forward to fri/sat as its supposed to be overcast and I think we can start to hit them hard again in the weeds. I'll post a report after the weekend and I get things figured out a little more after the quick trip home to bring the car back has me a little groggy tonight."
1050819,ajbuff,2008-08-22 05:00:00,11,"Big Mike, Sorry to hear about the car, hope everyone is okay. Jeff, Bob, Eric and I should arrive in camp about 0830 saturday morning. We're taking 71 instead of 502 because of some of the reports in WC. Only adds about 20+ miles. Make sure you get the eyes figured out for us, we'll probably hit the north end right away and try our luck around the reef. Looking forward to having a cold one or two with you guy in about 36 hours. Tight Lines Buff"
1050999,JAY221,2008-08-22 19:15:00,877,"Mike, Sorry to hear about the wreck. I just dread driving those roads for that very reason. If anybody talks to Dave @ Peffleys ask him how he made out with his Crestliner for me. We had to tow him into Sleepy Dog Camp on the 15th. He said the motor was making strange noises. I told him I always interpret them as Expensive noises! Later, Jay"
1051023,Guest,2008-08-22 21:50:00,0,"Jay, I;ll talk to peffleys this week if I get a chance...today the walleye fishing was very good. they are starting to set up on the reefs and along the weed edges which makes them easy to catch. we had clouds, rain, and strong winds which really helped. me and 3 others in the boat caught our 16 fish limit easily within the first hour and had a great fish fry. hopefully it willl be cloudy tomorrow. norherns still not too good as they don't seem to be in the weeds yet Mike"
1052248,Guest,2008-08-29 12:11:00,0,any update on how the fishing is now I am heading up in a week.
1052391,Guest,2008-08-30 16:03:00,0,"Just a quick recap of last weeks fishing, just returned home yesterday (8-29). If you enjoy catching walleyes your in luck! They have moved out of the weeds in enormous numbers and very easy to catch, no matter what part of the lake, Big Lake, Middle Islands, and Jim's part were all kicking out huge numbers. My minnow bill for myself and 3 other guys was close to 150 bucks as we used 8 to 10 dozen a day and still ended up running out daily. I t was a blast catching so many, just be prepared to catch alot of 12-14 inchers as they seem to be the dominant year classes. Fish have migrated out to the 23-32 foot drop offs where there are rock and they are in 12-16 along weedlines. We caught most just using a plain jig/minnow although alot were caught by groups pulling spinners/minnows along the weeds. The northern fishing remained fairly slow for us as it just seemed that the big fish are out in the deep water (possibly feeding on all the 12-14 inch walleye) and just weren't chasing lures in the weeds. All of our big fish (over 38 inches) were caught either walleye fishing our pulling deep diving crankbaits over deep reefs. Our biggest (43"") was caught over top of 38 feet of water on a shad rap. Things should stay good for walleyes expect them to be moving even deeper and if its cloudy/rainy they will move shallower. Northern should pick up anytime soon as the water cools look for them to come back to the weedbeds even though they are really starting to lay down. Good luck and let us know how it goes...Mike"
