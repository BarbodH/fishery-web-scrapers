1052380,KidWalleye,2008-08-30 14:05:00,557,I was planning a trip to last mountain next weekend but turns out the fall walleye classic is being held out of G&S marina. so lake is going to have alot of boats on it and no place to stay. are there any other nice marinas/camp grounds on the southern end of the lake. If not are there any other lakes that a person would have good odds at getting a 10lb walleye on. within about the same distance from US border. I am looking for a new lake to fish. ive fished Raferty and Alameda so far in souther saskatchewan. any ideals on any others would be awsome. they dont have to hold 10 lb eyes just some good fishing lakes would be ok. any help would be great. thanks Gary
1052394,Larry L,2008-08-30 16:52:00,335,You might want to take a look at Diefenbaker.
1052402,KidWalleye,2008-08-30 18:46:00,557,I know that there are some huge rainbows in this lake but what am i going to be looking at for walleye size. I have this lake on a navionics card so I should be able to figure it out but if anyone has any spots they would like to give up or tips i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks Gary
1052465,scott_r,2008-08-31 08:21:00,88,"Im up in that neck of the woods, Im actaully fishing that tournament. There are a few places to stay on Last Mountain. I would check out Regina beach, its south of Rowans but if you've got a big enough motor you can get to the good fishing spots. Etters beach is a bit North of Rowans, you can camp there as well. As mentioned above Dief has some amazing walleye as well as rainbows and huge pike. I would also Look at Fort Quappelle, its has a 4 lake system that is conected by small river and can be really fun to fish. If you're looking for the heavy weights I would hit Last Mountain and then consider Dief. Another option to consider is Tobin or Nipiwan, big beasts come out of those water in the fall every year. Cheers!!"
1052468,KidWalleye,2008-08-31 08:56:00,557,I am going to tobin middle of october durring the full moon. Tobin is just a bit far for this trip. How far north on the water would the good fishing be from regina beach. I wouldnt even have to camp I could stay in a neiboring town or anything. I wouldnt be afraid to through my tent out right on the beach away from the campgrounds and rough it with no power. Etters beach sounds like it would be a better option as my truck gets allot better milage then my boat. But i cant really find any info on who to call to make reservations. I have a plenty big enuf motor-boat package to run as i was going to enter that tournament also but just couldnt find anyone that would fish it with me. thanks for any help Gary Cayko
1052902,Gooch88,2008-09-02 17:57:00,58,"Gary,I fish this lake steady and I would stay away from the north end of the lake during the tournament. All lodging in the area seem to be booked by those of us in the tournament and the marina will be full and a real gong show during the days leading up to and including the tournament ( Friday & Saturday) Sunday should be open. The south end of the lake is still producing big fish and qty as well. Pelican point, the rocky shoreline straight south of pelican and the 15-18 feet of water right off of Solomans point (private marina just down from the Regina Beach point) are great. You can stay in Regina beach or their is camping their as well. You could also find accomodations in either Lumsden or Craven, for that matter stay in Regina it's only 35 minutes to the Regina Beach launch anyway. If you are really itchin to hit the north end or can find a partner here is the link to the tournament info.http://www.saskwalleyetrail.ca/Tournaments/rowans1.htmI got an e-mail last week from the SWT stating that the tournament was full...although there was talk of expanding the feild as there is a lot on the waiting list.Just out of curiosity were did you get the lake on a chip?Kerry"
1053049,Waxy,2008-09-03 11:58:00,2938,"I agree with the above, unless you're fishing the tourney (and you can't at this point, it's full), I would avoid Last Mountain that weekend (and maybe the weekend after too). It's a zoo, and the best spots will be seeing intense pressure. Lake Diefenbaker is likely about the same distance for you, has just as many, if not more, big walleye in it, and there's lots of nice accomodations there, including marinas at Sask. Landing and Elbow. Waxy"
1053071,scott_r,2008-09-03 13:32:00,88,"Im in the tourney and staying in the campground and there are lots of electrical sites available, just spoke with the receptionist. There's alot of water to fish and I would stil fish it if I werent in the tourney but nothing stops me from fishin"
