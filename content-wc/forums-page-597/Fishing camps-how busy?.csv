1052738,2Labs,2008-09-02 06:34:00,685,"The camp we go to was down about 25%.Many camps were down MUCH more than that.Most years we would go on the water and be able to see 8 or so fishing boats around us on the horizon at any given moment. This year we saw 6 to 8 boats TOTAL each day and half of those would be cabin cruisers or house boats traveling the navigational routes. We were usually pretty much alone. That was actually a bit disconcerting as it is a huge body of water with some reefs that didn't make the official navigational map!For the camp we go to, I have to add one interesting point. Some of the regulars who had been coming year-after-year didn't come this year and were switching to every-second-year. Normally the camp had to turn away potential guests mid-June to the beginning of August. This year it could let those new customers in. MOST of those new customers booked immediately for next year when their week was over this year (it is a great camp!).That means the camp expanded their ""regular customer"" base. Hopefully that means the downturn is just temporary for the camp and the larger overall base will make up for those folks who were coming every year but who can now only afford to come every other year. At least that is what appears to be happening. Time will tell."

One thing I did notice was that the summer homes on the lake did not have much activity. Most of those folks are from Manitoba."
1052770,Guest,2008-09-02 08:11:00,0,2Labs What lake do you go to. I heard LOTW has been down 50%.
1052881,2Labs,2008-09-02 15:15:00,685,I go to LOTW. Been going to Witch Bay Camp there since 1993. This was my 27th trip (I am retired and get to go as often as I want which is usually 3 times a year!). The fact that they are down so little speaks to their loyal customer base. Great owners + great staff = loyal customers.
1053138,Flip Silverlake,2008-09-03 17:36:00,645,We're on LOTW on Pine Portage Bay which is east of Kenora. Spent 10 weeks up there this year and plan on 11 next year.
