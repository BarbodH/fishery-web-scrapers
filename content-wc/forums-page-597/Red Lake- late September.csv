1053107,Guest,2008-09-03 16:00:00,0,Going up around the red lake area Sept. 20th walleye fishing. Any tips or tricks what to look for ie.. Certain patterns this time of year? Are most of the fish deeper on the points or shallower. Anyone fished up there this late? Jigs-Jerkbaits or Cranks? thanks Tony
