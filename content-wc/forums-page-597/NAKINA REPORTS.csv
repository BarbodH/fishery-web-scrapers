1054381,Guest,2008-09-10 12:08:00,0,Had a great trip to Melchett in mid August. Report posted on this site under a different heading.
574419,Guest,2008-05-29 10:53:00,0,Any fishing reports from flyins out of Nakina?
574426,Guest,2008-05-29 12:58:00,0,I'm curious as well. We fly-into Simm Lake (Timberidge Outfitters) on June 22. What lake are you flying into?
574465,Guest,2008-05-30 06:48:00,0,We are going to Melchett with Arctic Watershed Outfitters. Have fished Melchett before with good success. Trip this year is in August which is different than the past as we usually go in late May or early June. Might experience different fishing this year in August. Already booked for '09 with AWO at Kayedon Lake. Post a report of your trip when you get back.
575011,Guest,2008-06-13 07:29:00,0,Surely someone has a report from their fly-in out of Nakina. Why not a post?:rotflmao:
575023,Guest,2008-06-13 09:47:00,0,"Dave, We corresponded last year before my trip to Melchett with AWO. Hope you have a nice trip. The fishing was even better than normal last August. The water level was much higher. Plus, you probably already know, Remy added a second fridge. Very nice!!"
575331,Guest,2008-06-22 20:36:00,0,"just got back from Abamagasi, cought loads of walleyes and some hamer handles - I didn't have the time to fish for big pike. Very windy, rain 5 out of 7 days and in the low 50's. Great fishing. Water level up @ a foot"
575349,Bill Krejca,2008-06-23 07:57:00,6107,Am heading to O'Sullivan's Lake in several weeks. Any report on the water level there?
575352,Guest,2008-06-23 08:30:00,0,met a guy that came to abamasagi from there because the water level was up so much
575377,Bill Krejca,2008-06-23 12:30:00,6107,"Thanks, hope it isn't a repeat of last year, we had almost 8"" of rain the week we were there, fishing was only fair."
575850,Guest,2008-07-07 19:07:00,0,"Just returned from a 7-day fly-in out of Nakina (Timberidge Air & Outposts) We were on Simm Lake which is 14 air miles NW of Kagniagami. There were 8 total in our group. We caught 1156 walleyes and 88 northern. Our largest walleyes were 25"" and had one northern at 43"". The average walleye size was smaller than we experienced at Kag but a lot of fish in the 20-23"" range. Water level was up and the weather was pretty decent. A few days the wind was non-existent and our numbers definitely suffered. Nearly all the walleyes were caught on night crawler harnesses including the largest northern which was caught on an ultra-light with 4lb. test. The no-seeums were the worst we have ever experienced but not a problem out on the water. We had a great time and am already looking forward to next year."
