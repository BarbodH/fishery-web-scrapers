1054939,Guest,2008-09-13 06:35:00,0,"Understand your frustration with this idiot who shouldn't be out on the lake in that condition. The point of my post was, who has the right of way in the channel and there are other areas to fish to aviod boats. Don't understand, the lake is approx. 150 miles long and boats will congregate on one spot. Many times it is where major boat traffic is located. Sorry my estimation of how wide Steamboat Narrows is, was incorrect. Guess we all need to respect each others pursuit of fish!"
1051362,Prescott John,2008-08-25 12:36:00,1,"Hey LoDOI will be heading upto Lac Seul on Saturday and would love to find out where Ghost Narrows is located.Plus if anybody is looking for a decent map of the North part of the lake, down to Steamboat - send me an E-Mail.[email protected]ThanksPrescott"
1051663,Guest,2008-08-26 17:52:00,0,"Hey South Dakota, My wife and I are from Sioux Falls and have fished Lac Suel every year for the past 12 years. This year we got lucky and made two trips - the last from Aug. 16 - 23. We stay at Whitewing by Ear Falls, but fish Steamboat, McKenzie, Ghost and south past Windigo Point into the big lake. Our Aug. trip was fantastic - great weather and lots of fish. We also found fish in the 8'-20' depths fishing mainly with spinners and minnows. Do you have another trip planned? Love to hear about your ""honey holes"" and experiences."
1051922,Hump,2008-08-27 19:45:00,578,"Was Steamboat good for you? Where in Steamboat. Was Whitewing full? what about lake traffic, etc. We were on that end of the lake the last of July and thought that tourism was really down."
1052187,Guest,2008-08-29 06:35:00,0,"Hey Hump, You're right about tourism being down. Whitewing was full the 1st of July but many other resorts were hurting - one we heard about didn't have a single booking for a two week period. The word was that some of them were thinking about shutting down early and at least one fly-in service was going to close mid July. Last week Whitwing had one of it's houseboats booked with 13 people, but only two cabins had fisherman in them. Several other cabins were occupied by Ear Falls Dam construction workers. Most of the resorts are renting some cabins to the construction people so they don't just sit empty. Whitewing also had five bear hunters coming in last Sarurday. Last week Steamboat had really turned on. You could pretty much fish anywhere and find walleyes. We found them on the reef marked with the red buoy on the south end, around the islands and shoreline at the opening half-way down, and on the points along the opposite shoreline. Some people were doing good right in the narrows and along the adjoining shoreline. In McKenzie the small islands and reefs were good. Pretty much the same down thru Ghost - islands, points, and reefs. When is your next trip scheduled? WP - Sioux Falls"
1052490,Guest,2008-08-31 11:21:00,0,"hi , i was wondering about ghost narrows . i have not fished there since the early 90's and i been on lac seul for 20 years. my group is going sept. 5 . we are not sure about going there at this time of year. i think it's worth a shot. we fish mostly south bay, manitoba point, sunlight, and different islands in the bay of islands. is mckenzie bay not a good choise for this time of year? we stay at fisherman's cove any info would be great . thank you. jerry"
1054586,cspierings,2008-09-11 12:21:00,230,"Fished LS from 9/4-9/9. Fishing was hit and miss for us. We didn't have any day with more than 30 walleye in the boat between 3 of us at least until the last 2 days and the weather was less rainy. Then the fishing picked up. Nothing real huge this trip, the biggest was about 26.5. Nothern were spotty too. Had our best luck in Steamboat narrows but nearly got killed there too. If you are in the narrows toward dark definitely make sure you have your lights on. We had a big crestliner dual console, green, with a 200 HP Merc just about kill us. They came at us full bore. Our lights were on, we screamed yelled, blew the horn shined lights at them... nothing until they were right on top of us. When they finally realized they were going to hit us and backed off they did it so quickly the guy in the back of the boat fell on his butt. He was wearing a green rain suit. Get the idea how close that boat was? I thought the smart comment the driver made after he stopped was a nice effect. If you are the guy driving that boat all I can say is you are lucky we didn't get your boat number and I couldn't remember it well enough from earlier in the day to turn you in to the OPP. The smell of beer in that boat would have interested them considerably had we reported you. Nice Lowrance too. Maybe next time you could spend more time watching where you are going and less following the little purple line on your GPS half of the screen (get the idea how close?). The best part was the guy in the back was just getting up off his butt when the crestliner took off after the smart a** comment and the guy nearly fell again. Judging by where we didn't find you I'm guessing you were at goose bay or gold pines. BTW the smallest guy in the tracker you almost hit was 6' 220, the largest 6'9"" 260."
1054662,Guest,2008-09-11 19:38:00,0,"Curious... Steamboat Narrows is about 50-60 wide and being the ""channel"", who has the right of way concerning this area? Not defending the idiots who should stay @ camp to drink, but think than a lake that is that big there are many places to avoid issues like this. I was up the 2 weeks prior to your trip and found decent areas to fishing elsewhere that avoided joining the ""party of fishing boats"". Many times boats ""block the passage through that area and safety to me is the biggest issue!"
1054695,Steve of Madison,2008-09-11 21:24:00,230,"Too many guys think that if you have a big boat w/ big engine you can go full out anywhere you wish, but at the same time if you are going to park in an area that you have boat traffic you had better be prepared for the parade."
1054696,cspierings,2008-09-11 21:42:00,230,"We were the only boat in the narrows that evening in addition to being within about 20' of shore. It is also much wider than the 50-60' feet you qoute and we weren't in the narrows itself but were in the area where things begin to narrow. It was easily a hundred yards or more from where we were to the opposite shore. There was plenty of room for anyone mildly alert to avoid any sort of safety issue with us. We were lit up like a Christmas tree with the boat lights, lights on our hats, the glow of the fish locator and ultimately a very high candlepower spot light to help the boys in the Crestliner keep our spouses and kids from collecting on our life insurance. Using your reasoning we shouldn't fish the Wenesaga river, Sawmill bay, Lunker point or between a number of the islands because they are smaller restrictive areas that I know on that end of the lake. I have to admit that those are areas we often concentrate on because wind and current moving through those areas help concentrate forage and ultimately the fish we pursue. I'm not an expert on walleye fishing or any other by a fair measure so maybe there is a better way but personally I prefer to jig or throw cranks rather than trolling up and down a shoreline. I guess breaking out the planer boards and staying moving out in the main basin areas might be safer but on LS I'm not sure that would be all that productive but it is definitely food for thought. I guess I did get carried away in the hope that my post might help someone else be aware of a potentially hazardous situation or even better have the guy driving that boat reflect on how close things really were and whether the behavior he exhibited is really all that bright. I have also never been on LS when the boats traversing the narrows didn't slow down and more or less proceed at no wake or slightly above speed when other boats are present, simply as a courtesy. We do but I guess that may not apply to all. The good news at least from my perspective is that I'm still around to grumble out what happened. Maybe I will learn how to locate fish in other places provided I don't get clipped by fools like the ones I described before I learn."
1054859,lcwhit,2008-09-12 16:51:00,104,i believe a boat at anchor always has the right of way. only makes sense.
1050484,dwink,2008-08-20 14:19:00,2,"Just got back from fishing out of Evergreen Lodge at Lac Suel. It turned out to be the best week of walleye fishing I had ever experienced. The fish were on most all of the islands south of Goose Island. We found them in 8 feet to 14 feet of water. Caught everything on minnows and a Lindy rig, with a short snell. Weather was perfect, no wind past 6 mph. August is a great month to come up here, as the weather has stabilized. We had two days that the fishing was nothing short of unbelievable, one day I know I personally caught 15 walleyes over 22 inches, and a bunch smaller, basically we were boating a fish every 5 minutes. Boy when you would hook a big fish, they would take line like crazy and you would swear you had hooked a northern, but it would come up at a 20+ inch walleye. The best depth for us was 9 feet. We had great fishing down in Steamboat, off the points as you travel south. I would rate the trip as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Can't wait to go back next year. Lac Suel is uncrowded, and the fish are not hard to find. It beats the heck out of my South Dakota fishing. Once you locate the fish, they are aggressive, and you have to set the hook immediately to avoid them swallowing the bait. Good luck. Later Don"
1050491,Guest,2008-08-20 15:03:00,0,"Don, Is that your first trip to Seul? Glad you experienced what many before you have discovered and keep coming back for, despite the lousier exchange, increased gas, increased border hassle, etc. Congrats! NWO Fishing Bum"
1050538,joeman79,2008-08-20 19:25:00,417,348 days and I will be on Lac Seul for the first time. I wish I could make another trip again this year!!!!!!! Someday. Glad to hear you had a great trip.
1050592,Guest,2008-08-21 04:33:00,0,"Thanks for the report. Leaving Sat for 2 weeks on LS. The points in Steamboat, on the south shore? Did you fish around Cox's Island or in McKenzie Bay?"
1050927,davenathe,2008-08-22 13:48:00,113,"Just back from 4 days on Lac Seul. Too our surprise fishing was better than last year. High numbers of about 50 to 75 walleye per guy per day and size was improved. One morning I personnelly landed 5 of 7 walleyes over 24"" with a couple 27"" inch fish. Rock structures generally held the bigger fish though sand has high concentrations with fewer large fish. Bottom bouncer with floater was best on rocks. Bottom bouncer with spinner and jigs where best on sand. Crawlers were primary bait but did have luck with preserved minnows on jigs. Only another 355 days till next trip!"
1050971,Guest,2008-08-22 16:32:00,0,Dave We're heading up in 2 days. What was your best depth ? Thanks
1051202,LoDo,2008-08-24 09:54:00,721,"I fished Lac Seul Aug 16 - 23. We stayed at Lac Seul Lodge. The fishing was incredible! We fished several areas on Lac Seul, but, the Ghost Narrows small islands around the ghost narrows that are not named on map produced the largest walleyes. Largest walleye was 26inch and largest Northern was 39inches. The Walleyes were caught in 8 - 20ft using spinners and bottom bouncers. The weather was beautiful the whole week, highs in the mid 80s during the day and lows in the 60s at night.I was told fishing in July was poor because the walleye hatch was behind due to high water levels. Let me know if you want more info spots in the Ghost Narrows.LoDo"
1051235,Guest,2008-08-24 17:23:00,0,"To the folks that just got back from LS, did you find any walleyes with little green leeches on the tail fins of your fish? When we were up in July, we caught quite a few small walleyes(under 14"") with these ""creatures"" on them. I emailed the MNR but I haven't heard anything back from them. Glad to hear someone had a good trip and the fish were cooperating !!"
1051250,bpetersen,2008-08-24 18:59:00,251,"Mickey, We had some of those in June. Didn't know what they were. They did look like a small leech. Pete"
1051360,South Dakota,2008-08-25 12:19:00,24,"Hey LoDo email me at [email protected]. I would love to discuss Ghost Narrows with you. We also found some great spots on Lac Seul. Thanks, South Dakota"
