The Doctor claims I have caught too many Walleye this year and it has caused a serious inflammation in my elbow. Has anybody else ever had this problem or any other serious injurys from catching too many Walleye????"

I had to go and get a brace for my forearm. It helps some, but the pain still shows up after a couple of days. In Canada the tendonitis in my hands usually flares up after 2-3 days of catching 75-100 walleyes a day, but I'll take that pain any day ;-)"

552711,Guest,2005-10-18 15:19:00,0,Dead Serious...of course the Doctor I go to likes to fish but he doesent go as much I do. This gives him the opportunity to blame every ailment I get on walleye Fishing. Just last year he told me I had Walleye Hemmoroids.
552715,troutaholic,2005-10-19 05:40:00,827,"Yep!!! Went to the doctor because of serious pain in my elbow. He asked if I played a lot of Tennis and I said no. He asked what I did repetitively with my right hand (no jokes please!!). I said that I do a lot of jig fishing. He smiled and said that I had to change my style to avoid the pain - it worked!! Now I have to adjust my techniques/angles on how I hold the rod. Another gentleman that I know loves to throw crankbaits - to the popint where he developed a large growth on his cranking hand. He went to the doctor to see if he could get the calcified grawth removed. The doctor said no problem and set a date for the surgery. The day before the surgery, the doctor discussed waht my friend would be able to do after the surgery. When the doctor informed my friend that he could fish for six(6) months, my friend walked out of room!!! I still laugh when I remeber how he told the story and what he thought of modern day medicine!! Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
