Number one, thanks to Laurent & Darlene, owners of the Papertown and Manitou. Great people and great hosts. Thanks for inviting us into your home, sharing a meal, and meeting your family. You are a lucky man! Thanks also to the ""Sioux City Crew"", Jeff and Dave, and Cornhusker. Always fun to share reports. Your guys were better than mine. We also made a lot of other good friends up there. We heard good and bad reports before leaving last Friday. With that in mind we hedged our bet and fished the Red and Traverse bay on Saturday. We caught some nice 24's on Sat on the Red trolling but didn't do anything much jigging, lots of smaller fish. At noon we pulled up and went to Traverse (We really prefer Pine Falls and trolling, some prefer Selkirk - to each his own). One boat with good jiggers fished edges and piles and we trolled Sat PM-Monday. The good news was we caught a TON of fish most of the time. We did not get a master at Pine but did get a 26. Seemed like every crank we put out did well, but we kept looking for better ones. Fished the mouth of the river out to Devil's, anything from regular flats, to boulder fields to the channel edges, humps, etc. As I understand it the water dropped 6-8' from the middle of last week to the weekend so some guys did well, some struggled. We were in the middle. It was nice to see a phenomenal class of 21-23"" fish at Traverse. The water was coming back up but more from a lack of wind than a good needed N wind. We haven't taken much time to fish the river at Pine and that probably was a mistake that we keep repeating. On the advice of the above we pulled stakes and moved to the Red and jigged mud bottom areas 13-18'. I think a lot of everything worked but our crew did get 4 masters in a 1.25 days jigging 3/8 or 3/4 oz Walleye Flashers and a few other guys picked some up too on them. Regular jigs in small and LARGE sizes also worked with salties. Pink, Glow, Firetiger, yellow - it all seemed to work when the fish moved through. Two of our 5 guys got their biggest walleyes ever and Master's fish so we were pleased. Alas, the guy that fishes the most in our group did the worst - me, but I genuinely was pleased to see the number of large fish we saw and caught. To give you an idea of the shape the fish were in, one of the 28"" fish weighed 11 lbs!!! That's NOT a typo and my scale works perfectly. It was to see them all released except for some eaters for a fry back here at home. Local estimates have the commercial harvest at 20 million pounds so we didn't hurt things much! Water is 47/48 at the Red and 51-53 at Pine depending on where you're at roughly. She's a beautiful fishery and seems strong this year again. Hope it continues and wish everyone going up light to moderate N winds, no precip, and balmy afternoons. One reminder, make sure you leave your skin patch and and don't freeze fillets if you keep any fish. There was a roadblock by Stead and the US border was also inspecting fish. Another thing is there was a lot of talk about how big fish should be handled among some of the boats. Be ready to take your pics, measurements and weights ahead of catching your memory. A good idea is catch your fish, leave it in the net over the side of boat with enough freedom so she can breathe and not be scraping on the net. Weigh her IN the net or measure her by laying her down on your tape or ruler in the net - perfect length isn't expected and you round up anyway :)) just teasing and know the net weight ahead of time or deduct it later (put your weight hook though the bag at the top, if you can, remove the handle. Put her back in the water for a bit then remove the big girl, unhook her, get your quick shots/video while supporting her and avoiding the gills and make sure you release them upright. Hold them for a moment and do not let got until they steam down on their own. Just some ideas. It can be hard handling these girls but it's nice to try and do it right. I would welcome better ideas, we can all learn, particularly me. Ramp at Pine was fine, ramp at Selkirk was fine IF you used the S end, also use the S half of the ramp at Cats on the Red Until next year... Todd Spanish!

552633,Guest,2005-10-13 11:02:00,0,Thanks Todd. Did the big fish come from Miracle mile are?
552634,Todd_NE,2005-10-13 12:10:00,1330,"I heard reports of good/great fishing all over the Red including the MM. Out of respect from those that trusted me with reports and for you the reader who can do I don't want to give any specific spots. Personally, I think you could do a lot of things and be successful but choose what you are good at. If the bite isn't good after an hour or so move to a new spot. I do think the old 15 minute rule is premature. Honestly, 5 guys on two boats isn't a fair representation. We basically picked a spot because I saw a bunch of great marks and fish were breaking the surface at sunup so we dropped anchor and it worked out from there. Todd Spanish!

552636,Guest,2005-10-13 13:09:00,0,"We snuck up on a couple a nice pigs last weekend on the Red. Had two right at 30"" and another dozen or so smaller ones. Got them all on jig/salted minnow, 12 to 18' water. Morning bite strong both days."
