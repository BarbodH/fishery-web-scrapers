552481,Guest,2005-10-03 22:22:00,0,"Fishing is good and optimistically improving. Based on personal reports, fished a little on Sept 29th and caught a few nice 20-23"" fish. Friday was real good boating approximately 45 fish. Primarily fished with #9 shad raps, colors of Baby Bass and Fire Tiger. Saturday resulted in the largest fish and still caught in the neihborhood of 40 fish. Biggest was only around 25"" but there were many from 20-25 so I feel the big fish are around the corner. I am excited for the upcoming couple of weeks as there was more bait fish in the bay then I have seen in years. Numbers were way up but the size is down a little. I think that is due to the warm water temps. Temps ranged from 58-59 degrees for water temp. I will be back up on Thursday October 20th hoping to hit the big run. I am very encouraged that there will be a good year this year. Appreciate any progress reports... By the way, thanks for the great hospitality Laurant, I'll see ya soon! By the way, how did you do Gary?? Good I hope! Hawgeye"

Shouldn't be to long before we start to see a lot more bigger fish being caught. I only see good weeks to come with the way things are shaping up!"

Lots of 16-18"" fish, and we had 5 master angler walleyes in our boat over 3 days. 2 28's, 2 29's, and a 30. The big fish seem to be heavier than they even usually are. 28's were going 8 to just over 9, the 29's were 9 and 10, and the 30 was 11."

He said they are starting to see more masters coming out every day. He said from now until the end of the month will really be good. He was out this last weekend and caught 4 masters in one outing. Just a little update from what some one said, I personally have not had to much time to fish, would like to here some more on how others are doing."
