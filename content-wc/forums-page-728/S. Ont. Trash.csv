He didn't say refuse...he said hazardous waste. According to the Illinois state Senators office Michigan exports several thousand tons of waste to Ontario annually.IT pales in comparison to what Ontario sends to Michigan, however.http://www.glc.org/advisor/03/mj_pointcounter.pdf Michigan 'exports' alot of air pollution to Ontario as well. Call it even Steven."

Ontario are cleaner and have more fish for several reasons, one of them being less garbage, pollutants, etc. News reports showing the US closing the border to a significant amount of S. Ontario trash is worrisome. I just hope the back up plan isn't to dump it in N. Ontario."
552688,bigfish1965,2005-10-17 20:57:00,3210,"There has been alot of poor planning on the parts of several big municipalties in Ontario for refuse disposal. I was surprised when Michigan started taking Toronto garbage. We Ontarians have to deal with our own mess and not dump it on anyone elses porch no matter what the cost savings are. It is not right to expect Michigan to take on our problems. Locally my municpality has been doing great things with recycling. We have a pick up for paper, one for plastics and one for food waste. I rarely have more than a single bag of garbage anymore. A reduction of 40% was reported in the first year and it is hoped that a reduction of 75% can be reached."
552690,Guest,2005-10-18 05:40:00,0,The State of Michigan would love to tell the Canucks to take the Toronto trash and shove it but this is not Michigan's choice due to NAFTA and international trade agreements between Canada and the U.S. Poor planning on Canada's part for refuse disposal.
552691,Guest,2005-10-18 05:43:00,0,I am told there is a bill in the U.S. Congress moving rapidily to end this Canadien garbage dumping practice. If I was 'trash REAL QUICK because the Michigan plan is soon to be ending.

If I >was 'trash REAL QUICK because the Michigan plan is soon to be >ending. Although I concur that many Canadian municipalities need to better address refuse disposal, I would contend that your choice of words is unacceptable. There has been no ""Canadien garbage dumping practice"". Michigan contracted to incinerate Toronto's garbage for a price. Canadians living in South Western Ontario haven't been too happy with that contract either as much of the air particulates resulting from the incineration of the Toronto garbage fall on that area."
552717,Guest,2005-10-19 06:33:00,0,"I say business is business, it would be pretty easy to get out of that deal if they wanted to, increase the prices to the point it is no longer economical for us Ontarians to send our garbage there. If the price is right, I say keep sending it their way, they CHOSE to deal with it. Good day."
552720,Guest,2005-10-19 12:40:00,0,Sorry but you must be talking to someone that has no knowlwdge of how Michigan gets rid of Toronto's garbage. GARBAGE IN MICHIGAN IS NEVER INCERNERTED OR BURNED. THEY BURY IT IN LANDFILLS UNDER STRICT GUIDELINES. BURNING GARBAGE IN MICHIGAN IS NOT ALLOWED NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE.
552722,Guest,2005-10-19 13:46:00,0,Toronto pays to have its refuse hauled into Michigan.Refuse disposal is big business on both sides of the border.
552725,bigfish1965,2005-10-19 21:26:00,3210,"No one is forcing it down their throats, so it must be good business which is why it will never be outlawed.You likely get more resistance from the people in Windsor who have to suffer the trucks driving through their town."
552729,retire55,2005-10-20 08:10:00,1029,"Thanks WIGWAM for clarifying my misunderstanding. For further clarification, I requested some information from access Toronto. Here's their response: Since the closure of Toronto's local landfill at the end of 2002, Toronto has sent all of its residual waste for disposal to the Carlton Farms Landfill owned and operated by Republic Services in the State of Michigan. This waste is not incinerated, however. It is a landfill operation. Trans-boundary movement of waste is part of the solid waste management industry. Not only do other municipalities in Ontario export waste to Michigan, so do such American states as Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Similarly, Michigan itself is a major exporter of hazardous waste, sending as much as 55,000 tonnes of this material annually to Ontario."
