551853,Guest,2005-08-31 00:38:00,0,"Hi. It was just my wife and I so we always asked for the honeymoon suite. Its the little cabin off by itself. we found it quite nice, good boats and motors."
551886,Guest,2005-09-02 08:13:00,0,"The fishing will be great, same area as several other lodges, Evergreen, Timberlane, Gold Pine and others. I stayed at Golden Fawn in 2004, everything was fine, not great but adiquate. the cabin (I can only speak for the one we stayed in) was ok it needed a little TLC, the boats were ok. From what I understand the lodge is up for sale, seems the owner has been stricken w/ a brain tumor or brain cancer, something serious like that"
