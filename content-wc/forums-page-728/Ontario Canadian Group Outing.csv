We've had great action fishing structure with the wind blowing in. Jigman: I have to give you your props on the the jigs! I'm waiting to hear from two guys in my group. Because of job changes, we might have room for two. I should know pretty soon. Have you sent in your deposit for Ogoki yet? Would you be interested in going with us?"

552606,jigman 2003,2005-10-11 06:35:00,981,"Nope, not playing hookey. Just using my job site's resources inappropriately. No, I meant do you have an extra two guys who were interested in your trip that you didn't have room for. I already sent in my non-refundable deposit for Ogoki. I'm looking for a couple of guys to go with us. Ogoki is great, I may have found the lake I will always return to. It is so large that you can find new areas for many years. I was just kidding on the jigs. Although, anyone who is interested in some jigs could contact me ;-)"
552607,Guest,2005-10-11 06:39:00,0,"thanks for the info.we arehaving problems keeping a group together also and could use some people to go to windsor lake in june,2006.20 miles of lake all to yourself.brand new camp.we have only 3 for sure and need 6 to hold booking.have been to ogoki twice.the place is full of fish.thanks,tim"
552609,Guest,2005-10-11 18:03:00,0,I'll let you know if I think of anybone to help you out. I'll stop by one of these Fridays for a cold one or two. Later.
552518,phishfearme,2005-10-08 06:21:00,1242,"hey mr. walleye - my group is booked for dearden in late june/early july. would you mind sharing your experience there? thanks, phish [email protected]"
552530,Guest,2005-10-09 17:07:00,0,"Dearden has unbelievable walleye fishing. Have been there 5 times and was never disappointed. Averaged at least 15 walleyes per boat per hour. Average size just under 19 inches. Biggest we've ever got is 27 1/2 inches. Don't get much bigger that far north. Many, many 23 or bigger. This past year one of our guys caught a 25 incher off the dock. Excellent fishing also in portage lakes (LaVoie & Springer), although I personally didn't go to either last year because of the great fishing close to camp on Dearden. We don't fish pike, but have caught many over 35 inches over the years while fishing for walleyes. Several over 40, with the biggest being 45-46. Have been to Canada over 20 years, and Northern Outposts is easily the best outfitter with the best lakes we've had. Ryan and Kathy are awesome. Live bait is not necessary, although we do take some night crawlers just in case they're a little finicky. Bright colored 1/4 oz. jigs with 3 or 4"" twisters or half a crawler is all you need. We've been going in the middle of June, and usually catch most fish in 8-10 feet of water. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions."
552532,phishfearme,2005-10-09 18:48:00,1242,"mr walleye - thanks for the feedback. we were at obashi lake with kathy and ryan two years ago and were abit dissappointed on the walleye size (nothing over 18 inches) and actually the walleye numbers too. but we did catch 72 jumbo (>11 inches)perch - some of the best perch fishing ever - including lake erie. obashi seemed too shallow and weedy though. based on feedback from bigfoot (tim jias), the year we were at obashi we tried to get into dearden but no luck - got in this year when someone cancelled. i was going to ask you to mark up a map with hotspots but it sounds unnecessary!! thanks again, phish"
552540,jigman 2003,2005-10-10 06:33:00,981,"Hey Mr. Walleye, where'd you get those bright colored 1/4 oz. jigs? ;-)"

552542,jigman 2003,2005-10-10 06:37:00,981,"Tim-fishing on Pringle was fantastic. Vick was not as good, but still ok. Many more pike on Vick than Pringle, but they were smallish. The pike on Pringle were larger, but less bothersome. Walleyes on Pringle averaged around 19"" with lots of them up to 22"", our largest was 24"". Most of the best spots on Pringle are within a 5 minute boat ride. Kind of a funny lake, the 'eyes did not relate to shoreline points at all, and the largest reef in the lake was dominated by pike. Would definitely go back to Pringle with a group of 2 or 4, more than that and you might run out of ""hot spots"" Hey, Mr. Walleye-you don't have a couple guys too many do you? My group fell apart and I'm looking for two guys to go to Ogoki."

The price of the fishing trip to Windsor Lake is $950 plus tax.I have been to this outfitter(Northern Outposts) several times and his camps are excellent,campwise and fishing qualitywise. Got 4 pike over 40 inches at Dearden 3 years ago.Walleye fishing on all his lakes is excellent.Windsor will be an excellent lake Larry S"

552435,Jesse-WI,2005-10-01 12:38:00,534,"I think it would be nice to get a group of Walleye Central folks together for a Ontario Canadian trip in 2006. At this time, I would like to gauge people's interest in the ideal. I also need to know general dates, lake requests, price range, boat needs, etc. Assuming the numbers are there, I would put together some proposed trip(s). The overall numbers and votes would determine if 1 or more trips were possible. We would negotiate with the lodges in the various areas to get a group rate. The trip(s) would be a group function. People would be expected to share cabin space where needed. People would share fishing information on the bite, during the trip and from years past. The goal would be to have a great time and catch many fish. Where possible, maybe we can hook up some boaters and non-boaters. Well, anyone interested? Jesse"
552440,Jimmy Jig,2005-10-01 19:29:00,1905,You got to be kidding.
552441,Jesse-WI,2005-10-01 20:09:00,534,Why do I have to be kidding. I have been on several outings of this type from another site and had a wonderful time. What's wrong with trying to get a walleyecentral type outing going?

552514,jigman 2003,2005-10-07 06:26:00,981,"I fished Ogoki last year, Pringle for 4 years straight before that, and Vick the first year I went with MLO. GREAT outfitter. Can't not go with them, afraid of what I might get ;-) Have heard good things about Northern Outposts and Wilderness North out of Armstrong. I think the outfitters in that area are all reputable and provide good service-unlike SOME of them in other areas. What lake are you going to with N.O.?"

552517,Guest,2005-10-07 16:31:00,0,"We've gone with Northern Outposts for the last 5 years or so. Ryan and Kathy are awesome. On our way out of Dearden last year we stopped at Windsor so Ryan could leave some supplies. As with all their camps, it looked awesome there. We're going to Blackbirch with NO in June. Opened for the first time last year along with Windsor. Anybody go to Blackbirch with NO in '05?"
