552739,Brax,2005-10-21 05:12:00,52,I have not found any sort of electronic map of Lac Seul that show water depth. Last year a guy showed me a Lowrance freedom map he had in his Lowrance. It does not show depth but is a topo style map. The shoreline and island detail was impressive. The drawback is the chip is expensive. I see lowrance has a Canada map create disk. I was thinking about picking one of these up and making my own maps of the area. If you have an accurate detail of all the islands and shoreline that would be half of the battle. I just wish I could find someone that has this disc to let me know if it was as detailed as the freedom chip.
