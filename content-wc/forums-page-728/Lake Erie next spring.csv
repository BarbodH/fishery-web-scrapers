Sure, there is a picture or two for the bulletin board, but might as well go for salmon on a hot summer day on a great lake. It is crowded, some jigging, mostly drifting big flats in the rod in a rod mount for the big ones and you'll take your turn to reel one in .... and that is if you are lucky. If your not you'll be sitting on shore, or like us one year, puking while reeling in fish...after an hour or two even iron stomached folks head in. Go north."

It also much more affordable than a Canadian trip. In terms of timing, the two best months for catching a big Lake Erie Walleye are April and October. April is good for numbers as well. The downside, as Juls mentioned, in that the weather can sometimes be difficult. In my opinion it's definitely worth taking the chance. The best charter I have found on Erie is Rags to Richs. He runs with a group of other charter captains who always seem to know where the fish are. He also has a nice cabin that he rents that sleeps up to, I believe, 12 guys. I attached a link to his website. http://www.captain-rich.com/"
552669,Guest,2005-10-15 17:38:00,0,"Oh Yeah, April can be a great month on Lake Erie. Like Juls stated, weather can be a real challenge a the time. Big fish are caught, both trolling and jigging. Early in he month charter captains will concentrate on the reefs. There are days when you can catch walleye hand of fist jiging, vast majority are males. The downside to March and April on Erie is the limit. Two fish per day. May can be a very good month and the limit goes back to the normal of five or six (don't remember this year's regulations as I did nt make it due to back problems). If you are in to trolling look at the message board fishing repors, two very good boats are ETT and FreeByrd, many others are very good. If these two are booked, either can recommend some very good captains. If you are into casting and feeling everything immediately, then I would recommed Jerry Abel of Headhunter charters. Captain is one of the best for throwing, never trolls, fishs Ohi adn Canadian waters througout the spring and summer. I have been with four or five different charter captains ad for knoweldge and getting the bigger fish he produces best. Tis captain will tell you what, when, where and how. Once you get to know him he really opens up. My recomendation is late may or early June, cast with Headhunter. Go dring the week if possible. He will fish Canadian reefs, shalow water stuff and you will get a bigger limit. If you want that one record fish, go in late March through Late April with either the casting or trolling. Casting will be jigging and trolling will be deeper water flats or of the reef complex. If you want to contact me feel free. Rick Fredbloom Wannago[email protected]"
