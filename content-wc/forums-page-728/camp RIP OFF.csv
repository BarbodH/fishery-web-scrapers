552507,Guest,2005-10-06 10:22:00,0,I have it stated that my rate is in Cnd. funds but I think I will be changing that to US funds soon.. My first deposit came last week.I had asked him to get a canadian money order for $400.00.. He ended up sending me an american money order worth 340.00 (he was told it was just over $400.00 in cnd.funds.).Well that is for buying..cause when I go to the bank to sell it to the bank that is a different rate also..so by the time the money order came in the mail and I deposited it it was worth 391.00.. so I am short $9 (which they said is not a problem and will pay when they get here) For this instance I watched the rate for a day or so to see if I could get him a better rate..but it was starting to go down so just cashed it in.. I am here to help and be more than fair..being new at this I am sure I will not be able to please everyone all the time..
552615,Guest,2005-10-12 10:44:00,0,This is no different then my going to Grand Forks for the weekend and paying cash for my hotel. I get charged at a higher exchange rate then I would at a bank. There are two choices. Exchange money at the border and pay in US funds or pay with a credit card. The Hotel is not a bank and into currency exchange and neither is the Lodge owner. This is a common practice on both sides of the border.
552485,Guest,2005-10-04 08:51:00,0,"Trophymuskie, Thanks for your info. I dont have any problem with a Resort Owner charging a 3% exchange rate surcharge in order to keep him complete but in my dealings with our outfitter I felt that 9% was excessive. If I could generate an additional 6% revenue with no overhead in my business I could spend 6 weeks fishing in Canada instead of two every year and retire 5 years earlier."
552488,lenray,2005-10-04 13:51:00,467,Thanks MINNOWMAN I understand that stuff can happen--thanks for the link to the newspaper. I enjoy reading the news from up there. Do some fishing north of the village of Pickle Lake 100 miles north of the village. Plenty of bear and moose up there. I am 60 and the dirt sleep doesn't scare me but that going by a bear attack wouldn't be pleasant for sure.
552492,Guest,2005-10-04 19:38:00,0,"len ray....while your preference of the adventure fishing vs the ""camp"" alternative is admirable (because face it most people these days are just too #### lazy), you are a minority. Most people who travel to Canada to fish do not have the same expectations...most want a level of service that the ""camps"" provide. Plus the fact that the ""camp"" atmosphere is a long tradition amongst anglers. So, before you become any more negative to the ""camp"" patron, just remember that no one is critisizing your decision to do what you do. Although, as a Canadian, I think you are getting a lot of ""bang"" for the ""very few"" bucks you are spending in my country....I hope you appreciate the priviledge."
552493,Guest,2005-10-04 22:10:00,0,our outfitter only accepted us dollars.I tried to pay gor a cap with Canadian Money and got ripped . Seems like in Canada they would accet Canadian currency!
552495,Guest,2005-10-04 23:02:00,0,"In July 1999 near White River, we were on a fly-in which had a camp that bears destroyed everything and even tried to rip the screen door off to get inside our cabin with me inside among others. In 2001 the same thing happened. We complained to the camp people and were told there was nothing they could legally becuase the goverment protects bears more than people, BUT if we wanted to do something about it and had a concern about out personal safety, all we had to do was pay the the 50.00 fee to bring in a rifle of our choice to protect ourselves. No problem. In 2001 I paid the the 50.00 fee and declared the 308 Winchester and we flew the rifle and 180 grain Hornady Ballistic Tip SST bullets in with our fishing stuff. Sure enough the departing party warned us of the marauding bears and their damaging antics. I just smiled and said, ""the bears won't bother us now"". On the morning of the second day the two bears came in for the normal morning attack looking for free food. After ripping down the clothes line and ripping two cooler tops off, the big bear of the 2 decided he wanted to come inside the cabin to look for additional menu entrees. First the screen door was ripped off the hinges and then he kept banging his butt weight against the flimsy plywood door. BAd idea for the bear because I had just about enough with this Canadian Bear Krap. I loaded up the 308 and told my buddy's kid, who was on the top bunk bed to reach down and knock out the chair we had wedged up against the door handle. Short story....Door opens after the bears weight pushes the chair away, Big bear #1 comes slowly in and I nail him twice, once right underneath the throat and another time in the middle of the chest at a distance of 10 feet. HE never took another step and the BAD thing about the whole situation was the ringing in my ears of the BLAST of a high power rifle inside a building. We all were deaf temporarily for about 3 hours before the ear ringing went away. We dragged the SOB out of the cabin and down to the lake and hooked 2 boats/ropes on to his carcass and towed him across the lake into a bay which we now call Bear BAY. The dead bear was somewhere between 300-400 pounds and after the shot we never saw the smaller bear again. End of bear problem in Canada. We told the pilot that flew us in the bear problem has been taken care of and he said, 'it's about time, eh""?"
552497,lenray,2005-10-05 07:38:00,467,ben dover jr. Good to hear from you. You make a very good point. I try to spend as much money up there as I can but as you know there is no way that I can spend what others are spending if they go to a camp- lodge etc. I wqs stirring the pot a little and was surprised that I wasn't kicked around more. Your note was very considerate and showing another point of view. Thanks for your thoughts and THANKS for your great country that we can enjoy. lenray michigan
552498,Guest,2005-10-05 08:30:00,0,"What am I missing here?? When I call to plan a fishing trip, I call the resort owner and have him explain the cost to me. I like to understand the cost in total before we even go. Most have a rate sheet in both US or CND amounts. The resort owners will tell you how much the cost is depending on you plan and stay. Therefore, when I get the bill I compare it to the rate they originally gave me. If the charge was in US then I pay them in US with US money or by check. If they told me they would charge me in CND then I pay them in CND money. If it is Canadian money then I exchange US money at the border. Therefore, Why do I care what the Exchange rate is?? The cost is the cost?? As long as they hold up to what they where going to charge me. I surely wouldn't buy something until I knew what the cost is. The only aguement I would have is, if they told me it was going to cost $100.00 US and when I got their they would charge me $150.00 US. In all the years I have been going up to Canada, if I was told It cost $100.00 a weeks US to stay there, I was charged $100.00 US. If I was told the charge was $150.00 dollars Canadian I was charged $150 dollars Canadian. No problem here. I think you have to do your home work before you go!."
552499,Guest,2005-10-05 15:44:00,0,"I would agree that a camp owner can take advantage of a situation.There are plenty of reputable camp owners in Manitoba and if you inclined not to return to this one there are many more to choose from.Many charge in usd because of the volume of customers from the U.S. and it is up to the customer to pay in the required currency.Most also will take VISA and I feel that is probaly the best way to pay as the rate is determined at the time of transaction by your bank.Do not let this experience sour you on Manitoba as this province has alot to offer.I,like many Manitobans,travel quite frequently to the U.S.and exchange our money for usd locally at our bank or pay by credit card."

552506,TKCENTERLINE,2005-10-06 09:10:00,24,"Yes, like I said the cost is the cost and the deal is the deal. I for one like to know the deal/costs before I get there. Then, I pay in either Canadian or US per our deal. I dont bother with the exchange rates, because that is always flexuating. Besides that, the exchange rate is a deal between me, my US money and the Canadian Gov and not between me and the resort owner! Now, if the resort owner changes our deal and charges me more, be it Us or Canadian dollars, then that's a differant story. That would be somethng we both can control. If he changed our deal by charging me more, I wouldn't pay him. Just like, I wouldn't pay anyone, either US or Canadian, who would want to rip me off. I wouldn't pay until our agreement comes back into alignment. Right!! This is vacation and not a time for fighting."
552437,Guest,2005-10-01 13:27:00,0,"WIGWAM, What resort do you own? If you are not a resort owner and have any other business please let me know what it is and where it is so I wont ever grace your door. I dont mind paying what I owe but I dont like getting taken advantage of and you seem to think taking advantage of your customert is ""Business as usual"". When a resort owner advertises in US funds and CN funds but only charges in CN so he can take advantage of the exchange rate that is borderline theivery."
552439,lenray,2005-10-01 18:15:00,467,Why does everyone go to a camp///??? Do you think the locals who have good fishing are going to CAMPS. We have spent years making contacts and finding VERY REMOTE waters. We tent out under the stars and portage from river to lake to river to lake etc. We fish water where we have NEVER seen another person except those that have gone with us. I would put our fishing-numbers size etc. up against what most off you see at CAMPS. We fish northern waters that flow into Hudson Bay in remote areas and we drive in. We boat many miles sometimes. You call us cheap--go ahead. We want seclusion great fishing and water to ourself. We live in Michigan and the farthest lake we go to is 1068 miles one way and the water that is close to home is 580 miles. We go up 3-7 times per year. If the time comes where I need to go to a Camp that will be the time I sell my equipment.

The US Dollar is not legal tender in Canada and they are under no obligation to give any exchange. The volitility of the US dollar makes a flat exchange rate impossible. That being said I would certainly offer a slightly better rate than him. But, when I go to the Florida Keys i get US cash first....I never travel to a foreign country without using the local currency or credit cards. The advertised exchange rate is not what the resort owner would get at the bank and would also be charged a fee for the exchage."
552444,Jesse-WI,2005-10-01 21:32:00,534,"I had this problem one year. We discussed the issue with the camp owner and he replied his rates are listed in CDN and technically he does not even have to accept US. He used the example how the price of soda or beer varies on where you buy it. At a gas station it is fairly cheap, but at a ball park or convention center where they have you trapped the price is high. The exchange rate at the border is good, but the further north you travel the more trapped you get hence the rate goes up. While I still did not like his reply, I did get the point. We always check these days on rates, currency requirements, credit cards, personal checks etc."
552449,fishinnut,2005-10-02 06:26:00,642,Don't go back. There are plenty of resorts that treat their customers right. Please post the name so someone else won't make the same mistake.
552451,Guest,2005-10-02 09:37:00,0,"My bank has given me 1.15 since the beginning of September, down gradually from 1.22 in June. I try to give guests the going rate but I have lost money several times over the summer when the exchange rate dipped before I got to the bank."
552459,doubleheader,2005-10-03 08:23:00,2652,"If you felt short changed you could have politely asked about the exchange. The first step towards solving a problem is communication. Most of the time problems are solved through polite and respectful discussion. If the lodge owner didn't make a mistake or isn't willing to cut you some slack, well, you have the right not to come back. I've been making my trek to Canada for over 40 years. I don't think many of these owners are getting rich. I usually tip an amount close to the exchange rate anyhow just to show my appreciation for their efforts."
552460,Guest,2005-10-03 08:47:00,0,"We did try to ""Communicate"" with this deaf rip off artist. He just smiled and said ""Thats the way I do it"". He will be doing it without our group in the future. We did tip all his dock help and his kitchen help. Its too bad that he did what he did because he has a nice Camp with good service and the fishing was great. I would much rather see him raise his rates, bill only in US funds. I think his business would grow because outside of his perpensity to use the exchange rate to steal money his camp is top notch. I have a list of some of his customers and I have thought about contacting them and getting their opinions. But I dont think that would be right on my part. I also wont put his camp's name in print like has been suggested. I would caution everybody who has read this thread to do a better job of qualifying a camp than we did. I know we have learned a lesson and will be not so trusting in the future. Our group has been going to Canada for 11 years and we have never had anything like this happen to us before. Probably time for me to let this go and start figureing out where we are going next year."
552476,Minnow Man,2005-10-03 18:34:00,85,"Hello Lenray Goto www.thenorthernsun.com Read about a tenter dragged out of his tent in the Red Lake area. Ever since the spring bear hunt has been cancelled we are having more bear problems, the month of Sept, read stories of two people killed in bear attacks. After reading this story, a cabin sounds like a good idea. Happy Camping."
552483,Trophymuskie,2005-10-04 06:39:00,254,"As an outfitter I can tell you that every time I go to the bank and exchange $$$ ( ether way from CAD to USD and from USD to CAD) they take over 2%. ( At todays rates is I was to exhange 100USD I would be getting 114.7CAD and if I turned around and exchanged the 114.7CAD into USD I would be getting 96.53USD back, the bank just made 3.50 USD. Now that is prefered rates that i am quoting )That been said I now charge in CAD but will take USD from clients at the going rate at the time the moneys are exchanged. This means I am losing over 4% at times, but I do keep a USD account as some of my business expenses are in USD. If the resort only has CAD expenses and has to exchange every USD he gets he will have to pay over 2% above the exchange rate this means he can charge you another 2 % or so for the service and maybe 2% for the fluctuation of that week. This means that lodge owner thought he needed to make another 3% of your back. Over here a lot of Hotels, liquor stores and other businesses post their exchage rates and I notice that most are 5% above the actual rates and sometimes they are a lot more. I just checked todays rates and they are 1.16757CAD for 1 USD, if I am selling I can get 1.147 and if I am buying it cost me 1.1882 or a difference of 4.1 cents for every dollar.

552423,Guest,2005-09-30 11:03:00,0,Having been to many fishing camps in Ontario/Manitoba there is one thing I've learned (moslty the hard way). There are honest camp owners and dishonest camp owners. I just put the screws to the dishonest ones by never going back and chuckle when I learn later that they went under. You got screwed....there is no doubt about it.
552424,Guest,2005-09-30 12:13:00,0,"I agree he got screwed but don't you think there was some culpability on the anglers's part. When your asking for the price of water at the oasis from the only seller don't, be surprised if the price might be a little high when he asks to be paid in rubles and you have only goats skins."
552425,Guest,2005-09-30 13:58:00,0,Whats this Oasis Goatskin crap? This guy and his buddies got screwed by a dishonest resort owner. Thank God that the ***hole who owns the resort does not represent the normal owner. Canada is full of super resort owners who want their customers to have a great time so they will come back to their resort.....its called Good Business.
552426,rpieske,2005-09-30 15:50:00,1276,"Looks like your math is right. Don't go back there, but first tell him why. Next time ask the owner of your new camp what his exchange rate will be and how he indexes it before you send your deposit. Or, only go to a camp that will accept credit cards."
552429,Guest,2005-09-30 21:47:00,0,An informed consumer is the best defense against a situation of this type. What part of this situation don't you understand? It is like a old lady tourist going to a rough part of town with a 500.00 camera over her shoulder and it is Saturday night 11:30 PM. Don't come crying to me when you get ripped off.
552430,Guest,2005-09-30 21:52:00,0,"What you call being ripped off the outfitter calls ""Business as usual"". They were told the outfitter wanted to be paid in CND dollars, the fisherman didn't comply so they are reaping what the outfitter does normally. Because you have to pay extra money that you think is too high is irrelevant. The price of a glass of water in Hades will always be expensive and people like you will always complain about it too."
552432,Guest,2005-10-01 07:52:00,0,"I'm pretty sure that they all love seeing the american money and also sure they all screw you on the exchange to some degree. According to Wiggy it's totally fine,we deserve it,that's what we get, have a nice day and come back soon!!! Lots of the stores, baitshops etc. I stop at the people are about as friendly as a dog bite, but some are fine same as stopping at any tourist trap here in US, but we'll see how they respond to a dramatic drop in business next year, but that'a another topic!!"
552433,Guest,2005-10-01 09:32:00,0,Best advice if you do not have Canadian money ask if they take VISA. You can not be refused if they accept VISA by law and will get the current Bank rate give or take 2% and yes you can use a US VISA in Canada. Best thing would be to get in writing what the difference would be if you use US cash. I used to own a sporting goods business and I can say 9% is a little excessive.
552434,Guest,2005-10-01 10:47:00,0,"Being a Canadian, and having been to a place as close as Minneapolis, they won't even look at CDN funds at the retail level. You have to exchange it at a bank. That is the reality of being in a different country. These camp owners, out in the remote woods, not knowing what the rate will be when he makes it to his bank, is protecting himself.....a bit. Granted, 8-9 % is a tad high, but as a traveller to the US you have to learn to take your own lunch to Disney Land because the McDonalds (on site) charge $1.49 more for a burger than your regular franchise (off site).........live and learn. If you enjoyed the lodge, go back with CDN funds; don't call it a rip off; you got a great vacation,just what you wanted, you didn't read the fine print. Just think how much money Americans are spending to come up to Canada to catch the same ""catch & release"" fish, year after year. Is that a rip off. Kinda ironic..... Another ""rip off""...... The trip you pay $700US for a week in June costs me $250CDN at the end of the year when I dial the lodge owner looking for a last minute under the table cash deal. Just tip the pilot at the end of the week and what a week of memories...........that's what it's all about guys...... Have a great winter......"
552436,Mike Kansas,2005-10-01 12:45:00,1463,"Had a similar situation happen to our group on a trip a while back. After we brought it to the Resort Owners attention he was kind enough to refund us about half of what I thought was the difference between the exchange rate and what he allowed. He most certainly did not have to make a refund but I think he had made a mistake at the time we checked out and was just making it right. The Resort business is tough right now with exchange rates, high energy prices and other inflationary items taking more peoples disposable income that might have ended up in a Canada vacation fund. I told my wife the other day that because we need to maintain my fishing fund deposits that she couldnt buy any new shoes this year or any more jewelery....gotta cut back somewhere.

The current large rate exchange for Canadian dollars is $1.17 Can to $1 US. Or you can multiply the Canadian bill by .854 to arrive at your US dollar charge. Are you saying that the camp owner used an exchange rate of .76? If that is true it is excessive. Credit card it the best way to go or ATM exchange if need be. Sometimes people don't really know what the current exchange rate is. These numbers above are for really large exchanges of dollars and cannot usually be found by individuals, even in banks. That's why credit cards work best. They get the large dollar rates. I know my exchange rate over the summer at the Canadian bank varied from nearly 20% to as low as 15%."

552413,Guest,2005-09-29 20:05:00,0,"Perhaps they advertise their rates in Cdn dollars with a US equivalent based on a certain rate of exchange (which can vary from the time of printing the rate sheet). If this is the case, it isn't a rip-off, you were just the unfortunate recipient of a weakening US dollar. Get used to it, should be at par with the Canadian dollar within the next two years.....unless of course the Asian investors that presently hold 45% of the US debt decide to pull out their cash, then you may be trading chickens for that fishing trip."
552414,Guest,2005-09-29 20:27:00,0,Each $100 CDN required us to give him $94 US. Maybe Im wrong but that looked like a 9% overcharge to me.
552415,retire55,2005-09-29 21:42:00,1029,"With exchange rates at banks @ 1.17, ($1.17 Cdn = $1 US) you would expect to pay 85.50 US per $ 100 Cdn. However, since you were at an outfitter, you would have done well to get an exchange @1.15 or $87 US per $100 Cdn. Since you paid $94 US for every $100 Cdn (exchange rate @ 1.064), IMHO, you got ripped for $7 US (94-87) for every $100 Cdn charged. That's equivalent to a rip of 8% (7/87). However, if the trip cost $1000 Cdn each, that amounts to an extra $70 US per guy. For 6 guys, that totals $420 US extra. How did you calculate a total rip of $648? Did you challenge/question the outfitter regarding his exchange calculation?"
552417,Guest,2005-09-29 22:29:00,0,"I feel sorry for neither of you. You were too lazy to exchange your American dollars for CND dollars and the resort guy nailed you for it. The next time don't be so lazy that you don't stop at a Canadian bank and exchange some funds. Did you forget your beer too? Betcha you didn't, but you failed to exchange your money and now you want to whimper on WC on how not-so-smart you are? Resorts have been charging outrageous exchange rates for years and the smart Americans exchange money BEFORE the get to the resort."
552419,grt1,2005-09-30 07:47:00,259,"you complain about being ripped off but when you went back home you probably filed to get the tax you paid back didn't you? We Canadians are not afforded the same courtesy when we pay taxes in the US, so maybe you should look at the exchange rate as evened off by the return of the 8% tax."
552421,Guest,2005-09-30 08:42:00,0,"I did get the tax back just like I do every year. I also enjoyed the fact that I could buy gasoline, beer, and food for less money when I got home than I could in Canada. Dont get me wrong I love Canada and all it is to fishing and I have had many great experiences with the people of Canada and other Resort Owners. I just felt that this outfitter was doing everything he could with the exchange rate to rip off the consumer. When the exchange rate is .85 and a business only allows .94 I feel that is excessive. You have the right to disagree but I bet you would be a little excited if you went to buy something tomorrow and when you got to the cash register the retailer hooked you a 9% add on just because he could."

When we checked out and paid USA funds we got ripped on the exchange by the camp for 9% less in exchange rate. Is this common or did we just have the misfortune of staying at a camp that specilizes in ripping off customers. The additonal 9% cost us about $648 divided among 6 guys. We caught lots of fish but we wont ever go back. This camp holds about 24 fisherman and if you figure he is open 12 weeks he is banging his customers for an extra $31,000 each season.

552311,Trailerguy,2005-09-29 11:49:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b] Gas stations, resteruants, grocery stores, resorts ect, don't give you as high an exchange rate as a bank or even a credit card company does. They are performing a service to you in exchanging US $. Most resort owners don't get to the bank on a regular basis, something about their business of serving clients 24/7 I beleive. The exchange rate is determined 5 days a week on a system similar to the stock exchange, fluctuating up or down depending on how much of a given currency is being bought or sold at the moment. A business can get burned badly holding currency when the rate drops as it has in last year or so. The smart thing is to exchange your money at a bank to get the current rate, or use a credit card and expect about a 3% sure charge. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

I, being a canadian, have been to Grand Forks on a number of occasions, with only cdn $ in my pocket and for whatever reason had to pay for something in cash. The exchange rate is never as good as what you would get at a bank or exchange house. Now having said that 9 points is a lot. I really do feel for you. I can see a 3-5 point spread...with the way the ecxhange rate changes but 9 is a lot. Funny tho, that most lodges that I know, all advertise in US $. That of course would have solved the problem.

Our borders have been so open, and we cross so freely, we don't tend to give as much attention to many things, currency is one of them. Yet if we were going to Japan, we would plan how to get yen in our pockets when we plan the trip. The two best ways to solve is either bring the foreign currency with you, and pay with a credit card whenever you can. Usually the best place to get foreign currency is at the duty free stores on the border. In this case, good trip planning could have save some dollars, looks like it was known it was going to be a $7200.00 trip. In a way, you could be thankful they provided any sort of exchange - they're not a bank, they're a resort. They did not have to exchange anything."

552317,Guest,2005-09-29 13:30:00,0,I think you got ripped off by at least 6%. I can see a small charge to help elimanate them getting caught in the exchange game. The resort owner I go to said he was going to raise his US$ rates another 2% in 2006 just to cover the weakened US$. He probably will also raise another 5% for inflation. IM STILL GOING!!!!!!
