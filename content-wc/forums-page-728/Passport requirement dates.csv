Travel from within the Western Hemisphere (North, Central or South America) U.S. citizens: * Are exempt from passport requirements. However, it is highly recommended that a U.S. Citizen be prepared to present documentation such as valid or expired U.S. passport, U.S. birth certificate, or Naturalization certificate to avoid delays. * ExceptionÂ—travel from Cuba, valid U.S. passport is required. Important Note: The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative will soon require all travelers to and from the Americas, the Caribbean, and Bermuda to have a passport or other accepted form of documentation to enter or reenter the United States. The program will be rolled out in phases. The proposed timeline is as follows: * December 31, 2005: Requirement applied to all travel (air/sea) to or from the Caribbean, Bermuda, Central America and South America. * December 31, 2006: Requirement applied to all air and sea travel to or from Mexico and Canada. * December 31, 2007: Requirement extended to all air, sea and land border crossings."

Am I reading into this or am I interpretting it right? No need to bear the cost of a passport if it's not really needed. What's your opinion?"

The person I talked to was not very pleasant to talk to and told me to contact my congressman with any suggestions, I believe they are getting many calls pertaining to passports and American sportsmen & women who travel across the border each year. He did state that other accepted documentation would be embassy travel papers, or native American travel documents, the rest of us would need passports to get back into the US. Ron"

You'll have publicly funded health care, cleaner air, cleaner water, and way better fishing, not to mention a higher quality of life, and you'll be far more respected by the international community."

He thinks living in Canada would be a joke and that he would need to wear his hip waders around town to fit in!! I don't blame him...he has been brainwashed by the American governement and the media to believe he lives in the best country in the world. He lacks the will power to think for himself and realize that there is a better way of life in lots of other countries. Somebody else thought that paying $100 for a passport was steep for a one week trip to Canada each year. To them i say how about travelling somewhere else in the world, a passport can take you anywhere. Learn about a country outside the US for once...or maybe you are scared that you will see that it is a very nice place and will be disappointed upon return to your own country...but that isn't likely because you live in the greatest country in the world!!

Things like this have happened before (remember they were going to require visas for everyone entering the US at one point)and are usually beaten down at the last minute. It is unusual to the rest of the world that Americans don't have passports, but it is what it is."
