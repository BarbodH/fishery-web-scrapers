552500,swandog,2005-10-05 15:48:00,1,I have stopped at the duty free in Fort Frances on my way home to pick up a bottle or two but I've always taken my own into Canada...I've seen where people stop at the liquor store right before the border...Is it the same sort of deal where you can get a good price on stuff going into canada?...How does that work?..Do you pay for it and then they hand it to you once you've reached the point of no return in going across the border? thanks Doug
552503,Guest,2005-10-05 20:04:00,0,"It works pretty much the same way. You do not pay any tax on the bottle when you buy it at the international Falls Duty Free. They have a little shed just over the border (but not yet in Canada...kinda in that no man's zone) that is stocked with liquor. After you pay at the Duty Free, they send the order to the worker in the shed and you stop at the shed and get your bottle."
552610,Guest,2005-10-12 01:14:00,0,Hi. I would stop an get a bottle of tanqurey and thought i was getiing a deal then i compared prices at sams. guess what it was cheaper at sams paying all the taxes than the scam sale at the border. maybe you can get a deal there but i think the border sales people are laughing all the way to the bank on the suckers they get to buy their tax free stuf. for me it was no deal. if bought at the border ou cant bring any back without paying taxes on it. I dont worry about it any more.
552611,Guest,2005-10-12 06:18:00,0,"It is not cheaper at Sam's. We were paying about $14 for a Liter of Absolute Vodka at the Duty Free shop before we go over into Canada. I pay about $19 plus taxes for that in Chicago for a fifth, which is smaller than a liter."
552614,Guest,2005-10-12 10:21:00,0,"Duty free means you do not pay Canadian (or duty) tax on the items being brought across the border. These items, in this case liquor, are still subject to the state and federal US taxes. This is a common misunderstanding of the term ""Duty Free"". Depending on where you're from, you can find beer and liquor at an equal, or even cheaper price, than you can find it at a Duty Free Store. I never could understand the advantage of buying items at a Duty Free Store, that often charge more for their items than found in other comparable areas. These comments refer to items bought crossing the border from the US into Canada. Going the other way, yes there seems to be some advantage, cost wise, in buying liquor and bringing it back into the US."
552618,Guest,2005-10-12 13:42:00,0,"Duty free means tax free. Paying Duty means paying taxes. If it says Duty free, then that means TAX FREE. Here is the definition of ""Duty"" from the Webster Dictionary. Look at #4 Main Entry: 1du·ty Pronunciation: 'dü-tE also 'dyü- Function: noun Inflected Form(s): plural duties Etymology: Middle English duete, from Anglo-French dueté, from Old French deu due 1 : conduct due to parents and superiors : RESPECT 2 a : obligatory tasks, conduct, service, or functions that arise from one's position (as in life or in a group) b (1) : assigned service or business (2) : active military service (3) : a period of being on duty 3 a : a moral or legal obligation b : the force of moral obligation 4 : TAX; especially : a tax on imports"
552621,Guest,2005-10-12 14:44:00,0,"You're missing the point. In this context it means you are not paying the importation tax on goods going INTO Canada that were purchased in the US. For alcohol, as most know, you do not have to pay DUTY on 1 liter of liquor, or a case of beer per individual to the Canadian Government. Anything over that, you have to pay DUTY on it. Same is true coming back to the U.S. as far duty free items as concerned. Duty free doen't mean ALL taxes on these commodities are exempt, just allowable importation taxes."
552624,Guest,2005-10-12 15:40:00,0,"If I am buying it in the US and am going over the border with it, then I am not paying any U.S. taxes on the liquor. There is a huge savings. I do not know how you can say there is not a savings. Right now at my local Jewel or Dominicks in the Chicag area, I will pay over $20 for a fifth of Absolut Vodka. I paid $14 for a Liter bottle at the International Falls Duty Free border a month ago. A lot less money for more product seems like a deal to me."
552626,Guest,2005-10-13 00:49:00,0,like I said it depends on what you buy. for me the same size bottle of tanquray at sams was cheaper than at the tax free store and I did not have to worry about having to drink it all up or pay taxes on what was left.
