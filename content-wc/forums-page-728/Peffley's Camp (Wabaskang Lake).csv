I talked to a guy in August who had alot of great things to say about the new owners, so I'm sure you wont be disappointed. I have never heard anything bad about any of the resorts on the lake, most of the resorts are nearly full for most of the year, and most of those are repeat customers. I can pretty much count on seeing the same faces and boats on the water every year I go. It seems like if you can find a resort with an opening...you better book it because it will probably fill before spring comes. Anyone have any reports from how the fishing was during Sept?"

Dave is a very good guy and the camp is in good hands. He's a hard worker and will definitely do right by his guests. He's done a great job of maintaining the excellent facilities there. The boats and motors are always clean and in good working order. There is great fishing on that end of the lake for all species and we seldom stray more than a ten minute boatride from camp. The smallmouth population has exploded over the last several years with many in the 16-20 inch range. The walleye fishing is great with all the 15-18 inch fish you want to catch and a good population of fish exceeding 18 inches. You can't go wrong booking a trip into that camp. We do very little northern pike fishing but there are plenty of good-sized fish and the trophys are there to be caught. Check out the new website at www.peffleyscamp.com.

Big lake still didn't turn at that point, but we had no problem filling our 18 1/8"" fish by 2nd to last day. There were times it was slow though - I was catching walleyes everywhere from 16 - 48 ft. Big fish of the week was only 26"" though. Northern fishing was slow too - they didn't turn on until Friday, but they were really shallow (6-9 feet), we all came home with 3 a piece. Nice fishing down in Keynote as well - ran out of 8 dozen minnows down there one morning early in the week. :)"
