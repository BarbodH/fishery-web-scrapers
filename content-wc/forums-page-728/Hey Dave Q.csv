( staying at Nip. motor inn ) I see you say the lake?? why not the river... something I should know?? I checked a web site and it ""looks"" like the flows are down about 650, was as bad as 1300. A few weeks back we fished about 800 and it was almost unfishable dirty/fast.I thought 650 would be good?? Hey what are you fishing out of these days?? Dave ( same boat, 16ft angler/f50 ) P.S. ""trolling"" any eyes yet, heeee. Hope to here from you ...asap"
