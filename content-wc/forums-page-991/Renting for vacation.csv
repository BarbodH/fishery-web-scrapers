515275,Guest,2001-11-28 21:59:00,0,"WE STAY AT SUNSET COVE CAMP AND IT IS GOOD FOR THE MONEY. MIGHT TRY SPLITROCK LODGE, IT IS ON A SMALL ISLAND 5 OR 6 MILES OUT IN THE DIRECTION YOU WOULD TRAVEL TO FISH SO NOT A BAD SPOT. ALSO LAKE OF THE WOODS LODGE IS ABOUT 3 MILES OUT AND LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD SPOT. HILLIARS RESORT IS RIGHT AT THE FALLS. WE USUALLY ARE THERE THE SECOND WEEK OF JUNE AND THE 2ND OR 3RD WEEK OF SEPTEMBER."
515276,dlhomes,2001-11-29 05:54:00,62,"Check out my site www.lyberghomes.com, this is a very affordable hideaway and the fishing can be great. June is usually good fishing within mile of cabin. Last June we got approx. 30 eyes a night- 27"" biggest within 1/4 mile of dock! The smallmouth are all over at this time also!!!!!!"
