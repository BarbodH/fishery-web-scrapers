515455,Guest,2001-11-25 13:30:00,0,"Yes, River-eye,the traffic was down to 12 boats on Mon. and about 20 on Wed.I guess good news travels fast.The fishing was quite good.Best fishing times were between 9 am and 2 pm.No fish caught after 2 pm.If you know where the middle hump is near ""T-14"" marker,---that was the best area. (16-25 ft. depth)Also did well on the N.W. side of Treaty Rock area.35-40 ft. depth.clancy - Wpg - [email protected]"

I was out at the mouth, and although I caught a fair number of fish, they weren't the sizes you managed to get. My largest was 23 inches. Are we going to be able to get our boats out into Dec?? If the weather doesn't get too bad, I'm still hoping to get out this Sunday, Dec. 02. Will post here if I do get out."
515456,Guest,2001-11-26 22:44:00,0,Putting the boat away tomorrow going to Florida on wed. for some sails.As long as the ice doesn't biuld up to bad on the launch exit you should be able to fish for a while.The water was 41 degrees on 23rd.Was hammering them greenbacks for the last 2 weeks 30 to 50 a day past robberson rock cranking.Was getting a master or 2 every other day.Biggest 30 1/2 but most between 22 - 26 ins.Was having a hard time getting eaters.Only 1 to 2 boats out past the rock pile.It's been a late fall run but for the die hard it's HAMMER TIME
