I have heard its a great walleye fishery, with good pike and smallmouth action. True? Where can I get info on accommodations, as the internet has turned up zero. Thanks."
515441,Guest,2001-11-21 15:12:00,0,"Crowduck Lodge is owned by ""Bill"", you can reach him at (204) 222-7307This is a great Walleye Lake, catch and release only, there are plenty of ""Smallies"". Beautifull lake in the Whiteshell Provincial Park. If you can't make arrangments with Bill and you are determined to go, Crowduck is accessible overland from The Big Whiteshell Lake. Carry in a canoe or find out who has a boat in there that you can work out a deal with. Good Luck"
515442,Guest,2001-11-22 07:23:00,0,do a search in the archives on this site for cd lake. there should be information there.

515444,River_eye,2001-11-22 21:52:00,1486,"I think of this lake as an aquarium for walleye's. There are so many starving fish in this lake that a lot of basic walleye behaviour is simply not shown. It is a very simple lake to fish, and it's impossible to not find feeding walleye's. I've experienced some really slow days in there where we only caught 40 walleye's per boat. I've also experienced very good days where you can pick up in excess of 150 walleye's per boat per day. Also, the average fish length this summer was about 22"".I think it's a really fun place to try and experience, but it isn't really fishing, it's mostly just catching."
