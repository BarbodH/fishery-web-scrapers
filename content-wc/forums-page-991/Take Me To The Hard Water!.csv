515591,Guest,2001-12-07 09:30:00,0,"Dear Canada Friends,I commuted this summer from Florida to French Quebec for my first Walleye fishery. Needless to say, I throughly enjoyed it. Truely, there is no finer tasting fish.I would like to return to Canada to ice fish for this species.I am looking for any recommendation of a package program that will include everything needed. My gateway city could be any major Canadian centre that services international arrivals and departures. I have nothing but warm clothes and cold cash. That should be more than enough, eh?Please respond to me directly via e-mail if you have any information.I'd like to do it this season...[email protected]"
