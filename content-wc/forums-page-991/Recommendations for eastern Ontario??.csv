The last couple of years we have gone to Lake Temagami 100 kilometers north of North Bay but have been rather disappointed with the quality of the fishing. A cottage is fine or we can camp,it doesn't really matter. Our primary consideration is outstanding fishing preferably for walleyes with pike and lake trout a possible bonus. Any help would be greatly appreciated."

If you really want to rough it you might try Lake Wickstead off the Martin River, no cottages on the lake just a very rough boat ramp, and you camp on one of the many islands on the lake. But you have to bring everything in with you, and your washroom could be two logs side by side.There is a general store 10 min. drive by truck for fuel, food, bait, and Wobbley Pop.If you want to try something further south check out quintefishing.com ~~~~~~TIGHTLINES~~~~~BUD~~~~j<}}}>< OLEPHART"

There is excellent fishing on the St. Lawrence around the 1,000 Islands as well as on the many inland lakes. US #81 ends at the border where you cross the bridge and you're there. A lot of Americans either fish or have cottages or retire here. I researched the whole province of Ontario which, believe it or not has 250,000 lakes so there was a lot to choose from. I've met a lot of people who like me moved to this area and I literally have yet to meet even one who regretted the move. You can check ""Kingston, Ontario on the net and I'm sure you can link all over to see if the area suites you."
