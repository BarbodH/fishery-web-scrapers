Anyone have a recommendation for basing out of Sioux Lookout end or Ear Falls end? Where is best fishing, easiest navigation, etc? Also, various web sites indicate that we could get a pilot to take us out & bring us back. Would we then roam around a ""confined"" area with the houseboat until we are picked up? Any/all information would be appreciated."
515473,Guest,2001-12-04 11:15:00,0,Try Whitewing resort. It is on the ear Falls end of the lake.

515476,Guest,2001-12-08 06:51:00,0,"I am not an expert on houseboats but I have went on one trip to Lake of the Woods and have booked with a company out of Hudson for this summer. I have researched quite extensively the different houseboat resorts. As far as I can tell Lac Seul has 3 houseboat outfitters, 2 in Hudson and 1 in Ear Falls. Lake of the Woods has at least 6 based out of Morson, Kenora and the Nestor Falls/ Sioux Narrows area. If you plan on going in June I would make a decision soon because they book up quickly. As far as operation, you usually take the houseboat to a secure location (protected beach) and tie up and then fish from the boats you tow along. You can fish from the houseboat when its beached but I think it would be a little difficult when you are moving. You could move the houseboat to different places but some locations on Lac Seul want you to have a guide to move if you are unfamilar with the area. What I did was use the smaller boat and locator and scouted a safe passage from unfamilar spots. It costs alot to repair a lower unit or tow the boat off of rocks and the extra time doing this is worthwhile.I feel I am taking up too much space here so if you have any other questions try to e-mail me at [email protected] and I'll be glad to try to answer any questions I can."
515475,Guest,2001-12-09 13:37:00,0,Whitewing Resort is a class act. Would consider it a 5 star resort for Lac Suel lake. You won't find nicer accomidations anywhere else on that end of the lake. Stayed in cabins and looked @ houseboats and both are very nice. Probally won't get a houseboat this close to June but might get lucky.
