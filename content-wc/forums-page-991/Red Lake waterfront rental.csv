She is considering turning the place into a weekly summertime rental place. It's a two storey building such that the second storey is at street level occupied by a shoestore. It's right across the street fromt the Red Lake Inn. The lower level is at lake level with a beautiful deck and dock. She would probably put in bunks so as to sleep about 6-8 with two bedrooms. The place is completely furnished, with all appliances. She hasn't set a rental price yet, I imagine it would be between $1600-$2000/week US based on a full place. If anyone's seriously interested, you can e-mail me at [email protected]"
