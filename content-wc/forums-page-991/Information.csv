If no one knows anything about this lake, i would take any info on fishing walleyes and pike in canada. Making my first fly-in trip late July 2002. Have fished walleye many times but never in Canada. My pike fishing has been limited. Any lures, jigs, or live bait inforamation would be greatly appreciated. Flying out of Wawa. Thanks"
