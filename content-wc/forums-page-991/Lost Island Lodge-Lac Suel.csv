Never stayed there, but boated past it several times. Babe Winkelman has stayed there. Heard only good things about the place."
515429,Kaz,2001-11-18 20:23:00,643,"JMKC: I have stayed there several times. Jim Hayes is a great host!!! The place is newer and everything is first class. The docks are very well kept and the FISHING is excellent. Jim is almost always there if you need anything and the guides are well seasoned and have been there for several years, not kids either. Every night after dinner most of the guests come down the the big deck by the docks, and have a get-together with a few brews to discuss how the day went and to compare notes. They will park your cars at one of the houses in Hudson so you don't have to worry about damage. Jim lives in EMO Ont. in the winter months and I don't have his phone number now area code 807, try information. I would still be going there but I have my own place on the Rainy River at Wheelers Point MN. If you do go there you will not be disappointed. Many good Walleye spots and there is a lot of Smallies too. It's a easy drive just south of Souix Lookout. Give Jim a call and he will set you up. They don't do shows and all of their clients are comebacks. Good luck BOOKING...Kaz"

Fishing is fantastic, I prefer August over June, but have had great success in both months.Cabins are very clean, hot showers, fridge, stove, etc. Docks are top notch, with the ability to charge up batteries when needed. I have not used the guides, but would not hesitate to do so if needed. I do bring my own boat, but the rentals are Princecraft, with 50 horse Evinrudes.You will enjoy the stay.Wade"
515431,Guest,2001-11-30 19:22:00,0,"Wade: I brought in my own gas too. Jim had no problems keeping it on the dock. I would strongly suggest anyone staying they do the same. Wade, what do you think of Basil, the guide? Great stories about Nova Scotia if you get him to take a few beers, Canadian of course. Great TIME THERE.....Kaz"
