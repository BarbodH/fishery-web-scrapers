514785,oldlogin,2001-09-05 09:25:00,22,"From the Kenora daily newspaper.Nault willing to listen to outfitters By Melissa RidgenMiner and News StaffLocal tourist outfitters will bend the ear of the region's MP, Bob Nault, later this fall regarding Americans being turned back at the border for dated criminal offences. A meeting was to be held on Friday but was cancelled so area camp operators can accumulate data to present to Nault to illustrate how the border issue has affected their businesses.Many feel border officials are following the letter of the law too closely this year but staff at the border say technological advancements have simply allowed them to redflag more people.Gerry Cariou of Ontario Sunset Country says camp owners aren't asking the federal government to allow hardened criminals into the country, just to be more lenient on those who have minor, dated criminal histories.""Everyone makes mistakes and I don't consider someone with a 20-year-old drunk driving conviction to be a threat to our country. Those with felony convictions are a different story,"" he says.And when a group is headed to Canada and one person is denied entry, most often the entire group heads back.""When people lose $15,000 parties you're talking a material impact on their business,"" Cariou says.Nault says he'd like to sit down with customs and immigration officials along with tourist outfitters to determine what, if anything, has changed this year. He doesn't fault border staff for following the letter of the law but wonders if the laws need to be changed.""It's a sensitive issue because it's one that impacts the local economy and public safety. If we let in the wrong person and something happens who would be criticized? The government would be for not following its own laws. I'm curious to know if it's any different at the border this year than in years past and if we need change, what would it be? We have to ensure security at the borders to ensure public safety while being sensitive to tourism and the economy,"" Nault says, adding the issue isn't specific to this region. ""It affects anyone who depends on Americans' business."" Cariou says area tourist associations have requested information regarding the number of people who entered Canada at the International Falls crossing this year as well as the number turned back along with the same stats for past years. Border officials haven't provided that data.What is known is that 17,000 fewer U.S. vehicles crossed at International Falls in May, June and July compared to last year. Cariou blames a slower U.S. economy for the most part but is sure other variables on the Canadian side had an effect.""The spring bear hunt cancellation, new firearms legislation, the border issues - it all has a cumulative effect,"" Cariou says, along with the age-old complaint that the fish possession limit for American anglers on Lake of the Woods is too low.Cariou says another bitter pill to swallow is the $200 fee those with a minor criminal histories are subject to if granted a 30-day pass to enter the country. The government says money covers the paperwork cost of allowing that person into the country but opponents argue filling out and filing a couple of forms does not cost that much. ""All of these things combine to leave a negative impression with tourists and that impacts businesses,"" Cariou says."
514786,Guest,2001-09-05 09:32:00,0,"I have no arrest or conviction records, but how would anyone at the border know? Having crossed many times and into several different Provinces, I've never been asked about criminal record.Is Big Brother really that big?"
514787,bigfish1965,2001-09-05 10:32:00,3210,"Our Canadian Customs officers rely on information supplied to us by your government for convictions. We in turn supply them with the same info. I was turned back once when it turned out that a person in the car had a criminal record in Canada, and the US border guards would not let him in."
514788,Todd_NE,2001-09-05 10:42:00,1330,"I'm very interested in how our party will be treated when entering Manitoba this October. I have been in Canada perhaps 10 times and have with one exception, been treated extremely courteously and professionally. My trips to Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan have been fantastic! #####, I even have some pictures from when I was aobut 12 years old with a border guard who went through everything we owned, our lucky number was up. I just remember even my dad liked the guy, it was his job, but he made jokes, treated us great, and I thought the whole thing was actually cool at the time.Unfortunately, the one exception was this past April in BC when I and a companion decided to take in a day of fishing west of Vancouver before a presentation at a Vancouver hospital. When crossing the border, we were treated extremely rudely and detained. The border guards separated I and my fishing partner and asked us extensive questions about our past and future activities. They also repeatedly tried to trick us into admissions of drug possession, past convictions, etc. They would say things like, ""When you were convicted of a drunk driving, what year did you say that was?"" It was the way things were done, not what was done, every country has a reasonable right and obligation to keep the rifraff out.We were incensed and I did inform the area Chamber/Retailer group, our motel owner, our guide, and the local outfitter about the incident. All complained about this particular crossing and said numerous booking turned around and canceled trips, they said a letter to the province would not help, I was willing to follow-up.I'm more surprised the US lets us back in... lolTodd"
514790,Keith,2001-12-03 12:54:00,48,"Could you tell me if this meeting ever took place? Has immigration decided to be a little more leanient on DUI'S. We had two guys in our party of 12 that had DUI's back about ten years ago that had to pay the $200.00 last year. They are suggesting that they are not coming with us if nothing has changed. Thank You, Keith"
514791,Fitch,2001-12-03 22:48:00,75,It is terrible you are being black mailed into paying the money. If you are a bad guy $ 200 shouldn't buy your way into the country. It is really an insult. But I believe that you can apply for a pardon for life. And that costs about $ 200. To my understanding the Canadian customs were not relaying that message to the people coming in. Here is a site with more info. There is a form for resorts to fill out but I think it would be great if non-residents filled it out too!
514792,bphunger,2001-12-04 08:00:00,28,"We own and operate a camp in the Nestor Falls area. Let's not have any knee-jerk reactions at this time about your trip to Canada. The tourism operators are working very closely with Canada Customs. We attended a NWOTA meeting in Emo, Ont. two weeks ago (our annual fall meeting) and a great deal of time was spent with Customs and Emmigrations supervisors to help deal with the concerns. Yes, there have been some folks turned back. Yes, up-dated info is becoming more available going BOTH WAYS. NWOTA is meeting with the Ft. Frances office in the very near future to Work through these concerns. We live in Minnesota and our business is in Canada. Of course we want the boarder crossing to be as easy yet protective as possible. The new offrice at Ft. Frances will provide more lanes of traffic and our organization has been assured the Folks coming into Canada are welcome. Give it a little time to work it through. New laws are coming into effect and all camp operators will be helping you get across. Keep in touch with your camp operator. Bob"
514793,Guest,2001-12-04 17:10:00,0,"So, what about the helicopters and the national gaurd at crossings now, what is it going to change for the people going fishing? with more personel on hand does everyone get checked?"
514795,Keith,2001-12-05 13:07:00,48,"The word I got was it takes 7-8 months to get the DWI pardon through. If that is true than there isn't enough time between now and June. So, although we will wait I am not sure how long we can hang on.Thanks, Keith"
514796,bphunger,2001-12-05 13:36:00,28,"Yes, do wait before giving up on a trip. I6t also depends how long ago it was. There is no way I am able to answer every persons situations. If it was more than 10 years ago it should be easy. Get the forms from immigation. The counselets, like the one in Mpls, do not hand the work but may have the forms or where to get them. We have had quests in the past who have done it and it went well."
514794,bphunger,2001-12-05 08:18:00,28,"at this point, I do not see how the guard will change anything at the boarder. They will be on the U.S. side and are there to assist the US Customs folks. There is no intimidation involved. Going fishing? Just go fishing. It is that simple. Chech with your camp owner for questions you might have about your specific situation. Remember that some offences in the US are viewed differently in Canada. DWI is one of these and only one as an example. More info will be available after an up-coming meeting with our NWOTA group. Have fun planning your trips and then lookforward to a great time."
514789,Guest,2001-12-05 08:41:00,0,"This is routine practice for US border guards at the Fort Frances crossing. Any construction worker can attest to that. I have been detained by US customs,interrogated, filled in forms ect ect. Held up one time for over an hour.Seems they can impound and sell vehicles and possesions that are used or have any drugs in them. This is used to augment their budgets. I have no criminal record and have never ""been before a judge"". A lot of construction workers ""have a past"". Sort of like racial profiling is being done by these guys. Extremely intimidating. The same methods you mention above were used by your guys. Seems all these guys go to the same school."
