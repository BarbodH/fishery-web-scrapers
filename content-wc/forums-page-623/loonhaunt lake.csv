We were there for a week and during the trip we talked to other guests that were staying at 1 of the other 5 outposts on the lake and they were all having the same bad fishing. We expressed our displeasure with the camp owner of the outpost and they gave us a free trip for the next year(we just had to cover the plane cost), so we took it. We were hoping it was just a bad week. In 2005 we went in June and it should have been prime time from what we were told, but it was the same as the year before and again we talk to others on the lake and they wern't doing any good. My advice stay away from this lake."

571351,Guest,2008-02-12 21:08:00,0,"I have never fished Kariskons, it is a wide open lake and I don't want to fish a lake that I can get blown off or loose fishing days because of wind."
