571364,Guest,2008-02-13 09:51:00,0,Planning a trip for this spring to Canada. Looks like after the first day of driving we'll end up somewhere between cloquet and orr minnesota. We will be traveling in motorhome with boat in tow. Does anyone know of a good place to stop and park overnight in this neck of the woods? Thanks!

In the morning, we'd just walk accross the street and have breakfats at one of the several cafes. I have not been there for a few years, so it may have changed. There was plenty of parking right alongside the road."
571372,Guest,2008-02-13 12:27:00,0,There is stll a pretty wide shoulder along the highway but I'm not sure I would park there overnight. Besides there is a tarin that is right by the highway comes by so often you hardly know it's there till the horn goes off.
571373,Guest,2008-02-13 12:32:00,0,That should read train not tarin. There is also a nice place called the North Country Motel and RV park in Orr 218-757-3778. We have stay there sevral times and never been disappointed.
571374,Guest,2008-02-13 13:57:00,0,"We stayed in Orr last year. We had always eaten breakfast at the ORR cafe. It is closed, however there is another cafe that is available in Orr. I second the trains are a bother. have a good one"
571379,Guest,2008-02-13 15:57:00,0,"Orr, is that the town with the big perch at you enter town from the south? I think they have a visitors center at the south end of town you could maybe park in."
571381,Guest,2008-02-13 16:06:00,0,"Here is a novel thought, keep going....you are less than an hour to hour& a half from the border. Cross with NO LINE in front of you, and park at any number of the hotels in Ft Francis. It really suprises me the number of groups that decide to stop short and deal with the line to cross in the morning. While you are waiting in line, I'm motoring up and wetting a line in LS by noon."
571385,Guest,2008-02-13 16:31:00,0,"We also travel in a motorhome with boat in tow. Although we head up to Thunder Bay, if we can't make it to Grand Marais, we stop in Cloquet and spend the night at the WalMart Super Center. Good restaurant across the street (Applebee's) Liquor Store close by, gas and a 24 hr shopping opportunity. They have a pretty good tackle department. Planocat"
571386,Guest,2008-02-13 16:48:00,0,"There is always the rest area at Anchor Lake, located 10 miles south of Eveleth on the east side of Hwy 53. There is usually a watchman there when I pass thru late in the evening."
571388,Guest,2008-02-13 18:11:00,0,A lot of options. Thanks for all the info. Good fishin!
