571401,Obabikon,2008-02-14 04:17:00,2370,"I use braided... you can fine relatively thin and very strong braided line. But, that's just a personal pref."
571403,v-bay gord,2008-02-14 06:35:00,3168,"Nicko....braided line would be great. You don't need to go ultra heavy. The reason most musky guys use the big rods, big reels, is to be able to cast the huge baits all day. It has very little to with the fighting ability of the fish. Huge musky have been caught on small baits and regular rods and reels (example..O'Briens 65 pound musky was caught on spinning tackle using a 3 inch Rapala). Fishing June, the fish will not necessarily be looking for big baits anyways. Just make sure you have a good quality leader....and check you line frequently for weak spots. Sharpen the hooks on whatever bait you use. If you haven't had much experience releasing big fish I would suggest sticking with baits that have one treble...such as the bigger Mepps or any spinner bait. Nothing worse than having to deal with 3 trebles planted solid inside a big pike or musky. You don't want to ruin your first musky experience by leaving a ""floater""."
571405,REG,2008-02-14 09:37:00,445,"I'm guessing you already know most of the extra ""stuff"" you'll need. Roads in Canada can be rough and a long way between point a and b. Make sure your trailer spare is in good shape and have the right jack for your trailer axle. I even like to have a little foot pump for extra air along. I also was saved one trip by the security cable that I use on my spare. The bracket that held my spare on the trailer actually broke off clean and the security cable held it on the trailer and probably saved me losing it or running over it as it fell off. Carry a small flashlight in case of a night change. We try to limit or eliminate night driving because Moose are large and black and sometimes like to walk where I want to drive. Don't ever leave the dock without the raingear in the boat - even if it's sunny when you leave. And pack plenty of your favorite jig heads and curly tail bodies. The rocks can take more than a few and in June, all sorts of fish should be fairly shallow and aggressive enough to go after jigs. You may catch one of those big muskies on anything you're throwing - including the ultralite stuff. You'll have your hands full but if you get lucky and hook them in the corner of the mouth, you can get them in - just may take awhile. Always wear the lifevest and keep the kill switch hooked up - God put rocks in the darnest places so be careful and have fun. Rich"

We fish for everything from panfish/muskie. I will go against the grain and tell you what we use and how we have done. We have zero tackle specifically for Muskies and take our regular baitcasting gear and take a maximum of 12lb line on a medium action rod. We have caught muskies by accident up to 49"" on these and actually last year caught one about 15lb on 6lb line and a walleye jig and we never use any type of leaders. We typically have a couple of fish bite-off each year but we just are not comfortable using leaders. We try and use baits that we can catch a variety of fish on(bass/walleye,northern & muskies)like spinnerbaits,rattletraps,crankbaits,etc and they work well for us. The spinnerbaits/rattletraps in 1/2-3/4oz have been good to us. Colors vary like anyhere else but white/chartreuse,perch and red and crawdad(for bass) usually work well. Also, I think I would consider taking a day trip and trailer your boat to the public launch on Crow Lake near Nestor falls and try for Muskies there as well. This is a beautiful lake and full of muskies to. Like LOTW though you need to be very careful navigating the lake. Sorry for the rambling and if you need more information,just ask. Max"

571368,nicko,2008-02-13 11:15:00,508,"Need some help.... We are taking our first trip to Canada and will be fishing LOTW the first week Muskie season opens in June. Never fished for Muskie and would like give it a try. I need to know what equipment to buy/bring in case I hook one of these things. Any rod/reel combo's you can recommend? I am not looking at spending big bucks on a killer rod/reel combo. Just looking for a basic setup to give it a shot. I will also be trying to perfect my baitcaster technique as well. Do most people use baitcasters? Spinning? Type of Rod? 6'6"", 7'. While we are on the subject of what to bring, anyone have any general info on what they bring?

571370,Obabikon,2008-02-13 11:53:00,2370,"Well... here's what I would bring... Bait Casting reels... I use a calcuta and 3 abu garcia's Rods in the 6'6"" or 7' range. Line 40+ lb braided... it's extreme, but no point in losing any of your $18 lures. Lures- Mephs #5, Giant killers, double cow girls... get a wide variety of colors and sizes of shiny stuff! I prefer the traditional orange and black, but sometimes it doesn't work. I then will bring a handful of topwater, suicks, and cranks. Have multiple rods equiped with different lures, so you can easily switch. Also, remember the more casts you get in, the more likely you are to land one! Good luck!"
571371,Obabikon,2008-02-13 11:53:00,2370,oh... also heavy or medium heavy at the least on the rods!
571380,Guest,2008-02-13 16:01:00,0,I think muskies are a real specilty item. In the 30 years we fish lotw's we never hooked one that I know of. thats why they call them fish of a thousand cast and thats when you know what you are doing and are looking for.
571384,v-bay gord,2008-02-13 16:25:00,3168,"Unless you are really looking to get into musky fishing in a big way I would suggest forgeting about getting any specialized musky equipment. Just the learning curve on how to use a bait caster with some big baits and a rod you are not used to may be time better spent on another option. My suggestion would be to use your heaviest spinning rod setup (it doesn't have to be a broom handle, just what you would normally fish pike with)....make sure you have some decent line and quality leaders. At that time of year you could be casting for pike, having plenty of action, and as a bonus stir up the odd musky or two. You don't need the giant baits either....some single trebled Mepps musky killers....perhaps some bigger Husky Jerks etc. Just make sure you have the equipment for releasing anything you might tangle with......hook cutters, hook-outs, a decent net that can corral the fish ""in the water"" while you unhook it. If after the trip you find yourself hooked on musky then that would be the time to consider spending the extra bucks. Thats just my thoughts."
571390,Guest,2008-02-13 18:22:00,0,"Nicko, I've got a string of Canada fishing trips going, and hope to keep it running. I usually fish medium/large to medium size bodies of water. Last year on my second trip up I was at LOTW, haven't been there in a long time.....Needless to say it's not a medium/large size lake by any stretch of the imagination. To me, it's HUGE! Your first trip there...... My suggestion for equipment is the most over looked peice of ""fishing equipment"" there is......A dash mount VHF radio and a 6-8 foot antenna! Not a hand held, an in dash radio. (MUCH better range) You can buy all the fancy smanchie lures, rods, and reels in the world but they aren't worth a hill of beans when an emergency comes up on a large body of water like that. A GPS is'nt a bad idea either. Even if it's just a little hand held. I know some folks think I'm nuts or going overboard, but at least if I do you can bet your bottom dollar I'm hitting the emergency button on the way out and waiting for the Coast Guard! If you already have a VHF, good for you. Then get headed to Sabaskong (sp) Bay by Blueberry Island and I hope you get a 50 incher! Better SAFE than sorry. JohnB.O.A.T."
571396,nicko,2008-02-13 21:29:00,508,"Thanks John. You've hit it on the head I think for general gear. I do have a VHF mounted radio with a 6ft whip. I have 3 GPS units on board. 1 LCX-110, LCX-11CHD and an LCX-15MT. That I think I have covered. I also plan on getting the Navionics Canada chip. Appreciate the info....and Yes LOTW is a huge lake. Nick"
571397,nicko,2008-02-13 21:32:00,508,"I like your idea. I'd hate to spend a ton of money. I was thinking of just buying 1 rod/reel to try but if I can get away with just using my heavy spinning gear that would be awesome. Can I use a braid or would you suggest a mono/flourocarbon? I have a 6'6"" MH and a 7' MH rod. I can rig it heavy if needed. is that doable? Thanks...Nick"
571398,nicko,2008-02-13 21:33:00,508,Thanks....I would be up for maybe buying 1 reel.. If I can replace one of my low profile baitcasters and use the same rod that would be great. Thanks...Nick
571399,nicko,2008-02-13 21:35:00,508,On the subject of other stuff..... What else do people bring? Spare pumps? Hubs? bearings? What gear do I absolutely have? What is fluff? Thanks.....Nick
