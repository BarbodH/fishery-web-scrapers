(not that it puts the kabosh to the trip) Like all others that go there, we know there are plenty of other spots, but does anybody know if the MNR has any dates set yet? Just wondering................... Keep'er on the bottom, JohnB.O.A.T."
571436,Guest,2008-02-15 22:32:00,0,I have the new regulations in front of me. The new dates for the sancturary is April 1 to June 14. So I guess the earliest you can go into ranger is April 15.
571437,Guest,2008-02-16 05:36:00,0,Do you mean June 15th? Thanks for the info. JohnB.O.A.T.
571440,Guest,2008-02-16 07:11:00,0,"yeah, sorry for the screwup I meant June 15. Old age makes it tough on a guy sometime."

571493,Guest,2008-02-18 13:51:00,0,If you recall last year the MNR didn't print the regulations because they were waiting for approval from the Federal Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. The Feds finally approved the new regulations which included the additional 2 week sanctuary period and these are now included in the newly published regulations.
571500,Guest,2008-02-18 15:20:00,0,"June 15th is what I read. Just means you'll have to get up earlier to have a spot to fish at the Sanc. signs or the mouth of Starrett channel. Myself at that time of the year, I like dog dick point, Java point the rocks at the boot and the list goes on and on. Gullrock is a great lake, you should not have any touble catching fish as long as it's not a late spring."
571507,Guest,2008-02-18 17:44:00,0,"Hey Bud, whats with these names, dog dick point and java something, Have you been holdingout on me?"
571510,Guest,2008-02-18 20:14:00,0,"Now Billy, I would tell you about those spots, but they are only good in the spring and I know Linda won't let you away from the docks till June20th something. Next time we're having some wobbly pops I'll give you a hint."
571511,Guest,2008-02-18 22:18:00,0,that sounds like a plan
